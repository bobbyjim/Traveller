Usually reliable sources in the Imperial government made available a report
revealing that, in the last weeks before the signing of a separate peace
between the Imperium and the Sword Worlds, several deep-penetration raids
severely damaged major naval installations and manufacturing capacity on the
industrial worlds of Gram and Sacnoth.
The Imperial government reportedly rejected requests from Sword World
negotiators for financial and technical assistance in rebuilding the ruined
facilities.

Vice-Admiral Elphinstone's staff announced that the last members of a small
group of Vargr renegades remain at large in the Spinward Marches. Approximate-
ly 20 Vargr and two starships escaped capture and eluded pursuing forces after
the destruction of a hidden resupply base, located on a small planetoid in the
outer orbit of the Heya system (Regina 0802).
"The vessels were unarmed transports," reported Captain Bolinghurst of the
Admiral's staff, "and pose no serious threat to shipping. Despite this, the
Regina subsector remains under martial law until we can kill or capture the
last of these criminals."

Imperium and Zhodani Consulate emissaries formally closed their conference
today, after having overseen the administration of the cessation of
hostilities between all belligerents which began 001-1111.
All military forces have been withdrawn to behind their respective pre-war
borders. All colonial forces have returned to their home worlds. Selected
Imperial military forces will remain active to deal with various renegade
military personnel.
"This is not uncommon after a war," a spokesman for the Admiralty stated.
"Some personality types get so keyed up that it takes them time to settle down
again. Anyway, a lot of these people were criminals before the war, and are
simply returning to their old occupation with some new equipment."
The Imperial government has declared Regina, Jewell, and Lanth subsectors
to be amber travel zones. All other Imperial territories in the Spinward
Marches revert to their pre-war travel classifications.

A group of renegade Vargr operating as freebooters in the Spinward Marches
continues to elude capture. Despite reassurances by Naval spokesmen that they
pose no serious threat to shipping in the region, insurance rates for vessels
operating in the sector remain at war levels.
A representative of Hortalez et Cie (which underwrites a major fraction of
mercantile security policies in the sector) agreed to comment briefly when
questioned about this. Although no ships have been lost to the renegades since
the destruction of their supply base in the Heya system, Hortalez feels that
"a number of unexplained or incompletely explained disappearances have given
us cause for some concern."
Asked if they felt the Imperial Navy was not doing its job properly, the
Hortalez spokesman responded: "We believe that the navy is doing all that can
be reasonably expected under the circumstances. We are merely exercising
caution until it is verified that the renegades have been dealt with. This
action is not a reflection on the Navy. We are merely acting in the best
interests of our stockholders by keeping our risks at a minimum."
