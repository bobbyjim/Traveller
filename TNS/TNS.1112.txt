Informed sources leaked information indicating that the group of renegade
Vargr has probably fled the Spinward Marches for parts unknown. Several
alleged members of the group were captured late last year when they tried to
hijack a merchant ship near here. They have been held incommunicado since
then.
Admiralty public relations officer Captain Gaviin Ammern refused to comment
on why the capture of some of the renegades has been kept secret for so long.

declared all worlds in the Regina, Jewell, and Lanth subsectors to have
reverted to their pre-war travel classifications.
With this proclamation, the last of the emergency proclamations promulgated
during the recent war are withdrawn, and life in the Marches returns to
normal.

A dispatch from Terra/Sol (0207-A867A69-F) dated 121-1111 reads: "The first
known victim known to survive direct exposure to hyperspace arrived at Terra
today, suffering from what medical experts are calling "Hyperspace sickness'.
Naval Commander Ansel Churner, an engineering officer on his way to retirement
on Prometheus, is being held in strict quarantine until specialists can
determine the specific effects the exposure will have. Doctors working on the
case are quoted as saying that preliminary tests indicate that Commander
Churner is in good condition, but is not mobile.
"Three members of the engineering department on the Tyrol, a Rome, Inc.
luxury liner, were killed. Circumstances of their deaths have not been
released at this time."
Admiralty spokesmen at Regina refused to comment on the dispatch.
