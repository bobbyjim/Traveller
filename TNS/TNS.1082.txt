1082

Quar/Cronor (0808-B532720-B) Date: 309-1082
An incident near Quar/Cronor unintentionally began the Fourth
Frontier War. A series of battles ensued in the Jewell and Cronor 
subsectors. Neither side was prepared, and the war was little more than 
a skirmish-compared to earlier conflicts.

Esalin/Jewell (0204-C565673-8) Date: 323-1082 
Esalin (Jewell 0204) fell in the opening weeks. The Vargr and the
Zhodani jointly assaulted Jewell and Regina subsectors, but the initial
assaults stalled at the borders. Most of the later fighting occurred in
Jewell subsector.

Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 345-1082
4518th Lift Infantry Regiment is imperialized to assist Regina
subsector border worlds against Zhodani invasion.

Jewell/Jewell (0306-A777999-C) Date: 350-1082
154th Battle Rider squadron deploys in Jewell subsector for the
war.

1083

Quar/Cronor (0808-B532720-B) Date: 120-1083

1084

Ganulph/Trojan Reaches (1307-???????-?) Date: 065-1084
Manouvre of Ganulph destroys the biosphere and atmosphere of Ganulph.

Efate/Regina (0105-A646930-D) Date: 096-1084
        The final battle, the Battle of Two Suns, was fought midway between
Yres and Menorb. Losses on both sides were heavy, but the Imperium held the
field. Had the battle gone the other way, the loss of both Yres and Menorb
would have forced the evacuation of Efate and the collapse of the coreward
end of the Regina subsector. Instead, lengthening supply lines prevented
further outworld advances.
Kinunir class colonial cruisers "Allumu" and "Ninkur Sagga" were lost.

        Emperor Strephon had delegated war powers to Norris, Duke of
Regina. This brought a speedy end to a conflict that otherwise could have
been hampered by long delays in communications between Capital and the
front. An armistice ended the war after 18 months of fighting. Instructions
and reinforcements had not reached the Marches from the Imperial capital.

        The war resulted in some realignment of accepted boundaries, but in
no real gains for either side. The Imperium lost Narval/Chronor, but it
regained two worlds from the Sword Worlds.

1098

Jewell/Jewell (0306-A777999-C) Date: 45-1098
A joint communiqué by the Imperial and Zhodani governments declared Esalin 
(Jewell 0204-C565673-8) a neutral world.  It was formerly an Imperial world.
