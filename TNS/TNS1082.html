<P>1082
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Quar/Cronor (0808-B532720-B) Date: 309-1082</B>
<BR>An incident near Quar/Cronor unintentionally began the Fourth Frontier
War. A series of battles ensued in the Jewell and Cronor subsectors. Neither
side was prepared, and the war was little more than a skirmish-compared
to earlier conflicts.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Esalin/Jewell (0204-C565673-8) Date: 323-1082</B>
<BR>Esalin (Jewell 0204) fell in the opening weeks. The Vargr and the Zhodani
jointly assaulted Jewell and Regina subsectors, but the initial assaults
stalled at the borders. Most of the later fighting occurred in Jewell subsector.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 345-1082</B>
<BR>With great fanfare, the Duke's own Huscarles, the 4518th Lift Infantry
<BR>Regiment,&nbsp; was imperialized to assist Regina subsector border
worlds
<BR>against Zhodani invasion.&nbsp; Its target worlds include Yres (0202),
<BR>Menorb (0203), Efate (0105), Alell (0106), Uakye (0205), Whanga (0206),
<BR>Knorbes (0207), and Forboldn (0208).
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Jewell/Jewell (0306-A777999-C) Date: 350-1082</B>
<BR>154th Battle Rider squadron deploys in Jewell subsector for the war.

<P>1083

<P><B>Quar/Cronor (0808-B532720-B) Date: 120-1083</B>
<BR>'Tenuous' Imperial naval base constructed on Quar.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Garda-Vilis/Vilis (0308-B978868-A) Date: 280-1083</B>
<BR>Ine Givar attempts to recruit the Tanoose Freedom League on Garda-Vilis.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Jonkeereen (Deneb/1324-???????-?) Date: 307-1083</B>
<BR>First uprising of Jonkeereen over forced transplanting; Tribes unite
under Chief Tabali.

<P>1084
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Pax Rulin (Trojan Reaches/0604-A402231-E) Date: 065-1084</B>
<BR>Imperial forces assigned to the Egyrn subsector of the Trojan
<BR>Reaches have allegedly engaged some Zhodani ships.&nbsp; Though far
<BR>from the main battle lines, the Zhodani are suspected of having
<BR>contacts in the Tojan Reaches; to insure against raiding by Zhodani
<BR>sympathizers, the Imperium deployed some of its reserves to patrol
<BR>along the Pax Rulin, Egyrn, and Menorial subsectors.
<BR>Skirmishes were reported near Walei (0102-E7B4776-5) and Nabeth (0402-D326579-8).&nbsp;
The Imperial forces successfully repelled the
<BR>cruisers.

<P><B>Efate/Regina (0105-A646930-D) Date: 096-1084</B>
<BR>The final battle, the Battle of Two Suns, was fought midway between
Yres and Menorb. Losses on both sides were heavy, but the Imperium held
the field. Had the battle gone the other way, the loss of both Yres and
Menorb would have forced the evacuation of Efate and the collapse of the
coreward end of the Regina subsector. Instead, lengthening supply lines
prevented further outworld advances. Kinunir class colonial cruisers "Allumu"
and "Ninkur Sagga" were lost.

<P>Emperor Strephon had delegated war powers to Norris, Duke of Regina.
This brought a speedy end to a conflict that otherwise could have been
hampered by long delays in communications between Capital and the front.
An armistice ended the war after 18 months of fighting. Instructions and
reinforcements had not reached the Marches from the Imperial capital.

<P>The war resulted in some realignment of accepted boundaries, but in
no real gains for either side. The Imperium lost Narval/Chronor, but it
regained two worlds from the Sword Worlds.

<P>1089

<P><B>Regina/Regina (0310-788899-B) Date: 150-1089</B>
<BR>Scout teams, economists, wealthy industrialists and construction
<BR>company representatives have arrived on Forboldn (0208) to locate
<BR>and tap its resources and lay down an infrastructure.&nbsp; Between
20
<BR>and 30 years from now large numbers of colonists will begin arriving
<BR>from the Imperial core, ready to develop this pristine world.
<BR>Critics claim the project has a flawed recruitment program.&nbsp; Since
<BR>virtually no amount of money will entice an individual to leave his
<BR>home and livelihood for the bleak desolation of a colony world,
<BR>the Ministry of Colonization has established several programs to
<BR>produce colonists, including colonisation in lieu of a prison term;
<BR>however, several beneficial programs provide opportunity as well
<BR>as security to offset leaving for the fringe of the Imperium:
<BR>unemployment insurance programs for high population worlds can
<BR>send the unemployed out as colonists; likewise medical insurance
<BR>programs for indigents; and a special anagathics program available
to
<BR>qualified, retired individuals with skills in administration, mechanical
<BR>crafts, or medical expertise.&nbsp; In addition, land grants are available
to
<BR>retiring veterans to help for the new colony's military and police
forces.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>1098
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Jewell/Jewell (0306-A777999-C) Date: 45-1098</B>
<BR>A joint communiqu&eacute; by the Imperial and Zhodani governments declared
Esalin (Jewell 0204-C565673-8) a neutral world. It was formerly an Imperial
world.
