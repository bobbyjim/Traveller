<br><b>Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 021-1109
</b><br>
In a recorded message to the press, the office of Admiral Lord
Santanocheev announced that the Naval Base at Ghandi (Lanth 0205) is
under attack by Zhodani naval and ground forces, including several
units of the elite Zhodani Consular Guard. The statement indicated
that the garrison at Ghandi had recently been reinforced because of
the Zhodani presence at Calit (Vilis 0705).
This announcement has fuelled speculation that a major Zhodani push is
underway, with Rhylanor as its most likely target. If Ghandi falls, it
will be a major blow to the Imperial war effort, possibly a fatal one.
<p>
<br><b>Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 029-1109
</b><br>
Operation Iedshrpr, several months in secret preparation, was launched
by elements of the Imperial Navy's Corridor Fleet in a drive to break
the siege of Efate and force back the Zhodani forces currently
operating in Regina subsector.
Commander Aia Resortin, fleet press officer, stated, "Admiral
Santanocheev has planned a brilliant campaign for the relief of Efate.
Denial of Efate to the Zhodani means denial of the whole subsector.
This operation is the turning point of the war."
Regrettably, the meeting was cut short by a Zhodani hit-and-run raid,
which partially damaged some buildings, but had no other effect.
<p>
<br><b>Inthe/Regina (0810-B575776-9) Date: 059-1109
</b><br>
A ship from Imperial Scout Squadron 497 (recently based at Jewell)
arrived at Inthe after successfully running the Zhodani blockade.
Military security would not permit interviews with its crew, but a
statement was later issued that Jewell has not fallen, and continues
to defend against Zhodani attacks.

<br><b>Kinorb/Regina (0602-A663659-5) Date: 083-1109
</b><br>
Operations against the Vargr force invading Yorbund and Heya achieved
a considerable success recently. It was announced today that Battle
Squadron 203 and several cruiser squadrons, under Vice-Admiral
Elphinstone, were able to destroy a Vargr battle squadron after a
prolonged engagement.
Having regained orbital supremacy of the world, the Imperial 85th
Infantry Field Army was moved in to secure the surface of Heya. 
<p>
<br><b>Lanth/Lanth (0109-A879533-B) Date: 096-1109
</b><br>
Only days after the Imperial 193rd fleet left Lanth for a reported
assembly of Sword World forces at Tavonni the Sword Worlders appeared
in the Lanth system and immediately began landing forces. Local
resistance was fierce, but futile.
The return of the Imperial fleet after failing to find the enemy in
Tavinni, however, caught the Sworld Worlders by surprise, and resulted
in severe losses to the enemy. Imperial forces continue to mop up in
the Lanth system. 
<p>
<br><b>Beck's World/Regina (0604-B883349-D) Date: 122-1109
</b><br>
The last remnants of the Vargr battle fleet from Yorbund were run down
and destroyed in the Beck's World system today. Although all enemy
forces are not yet accounted for, Vice-Admiral Elphinstone's staff was
optimistic that the threat from the Vargr forces has been countered.
<br><b>Rhylanor/Rhylanor (0306-A434934-F) Date: 128-1109
</b><br>
Dispatches received from Regina indicate that a major Imperial raid
against Zhodani military and industrial installations at Ninjar
(Chronor 0608) has been accomplished by means of secret caches at the
old Imperial naval base in the Quar system (Chronor 0808).
No further details are available at this time.

<br><b>Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 132-1109
</b><br>
In a terse communique, his Grace the Duke of Regina announced that
Admiral Lord Santanocheev has been relieved of command immediately.
Acting with the authority of an Imperial Warrant, the Duke has taken
personal command of the 1st Provisional Fleet.
Members of the Duke's staff declined to comment further other than to
confirm that the change of command has taken place. Nothing is known
as to the reasons for Santanocheev's relief, or his present
whereabouts. 
<p>
<br><b>Rhylanor/Rhylanor (0306-A434934-F) Date: 147-1109(delayed)
</b><br>
Imperial naval forces and attached army and marine units have retaken
Calit (Vilis 0705), according to a highly placed source at the
Admiralty. News of the victory was delayed because the local commander
did not feel he could spare any vessels to carry the news out of
system until recently.
No reports of the battle, or of any casualties among the forces
involved are available.
<p>
<br><b>Lanth/Lanth (0109-A879533-B) Date: 241-1109
</b><br>
The commander of the Imperial 193 Fleet has officially declared the
mopping up of Sword World forces in the Lanth system to be complete,
after months of heavy fighting.
"Reports of atrocities against the civilian populace are unfounded,"
the fleet public relations officer declared in a press release, "The
enemy forces were too heavily involved in fighting us to be able to
have committed any crimes against the locals." The officer went on to
note that rumors of atrocities are common after any battle, because of
the high degree of emotion generated.
No information is available on casualties, either military or
civilian, but a highly placed source indicated that 193 Fleet has
requested large numbers of ground reinforcements, indicating heavy
casualties, at least in its ground forces.
<p>
<br><b>Porozlo/Rhylanor (0305-A867A74-A) Date: 231-1109
</b><br>
According to unofficial reports, a major battle is taking place at
Rhylanor, involving both fleet and planetary elements of Imperial and
colonial forces.
<p>
<br><b>Porozlo/Rhylanor (0305-A867A74-A) Date: 239-1109
</b><br>
Informed sources have revealed that major fleet and ground forces
arrived in this system last night, and are presently refuelling and
refitting for immediate transfer to Rhylanor, to reinforce Imperial
forces there.

</b><br>
All Vargr forces allied with the Outworld Coalition have been
instructed by their supreme commander to cease hostilities and
surrender to the Imperial military or present themselves to a neutral
power for internment. Unconfirmed rumor states the Vargr forces have
withdrawn from the Coalition, and are now negotiating a separate peace
agreement.
Speculation is rampant in all governmental circles as to the
ramifications of this action, both with regard to the war and with
regard to post-war policies in the Vargr Extents. 
<p>
<br><b>Rhylanor/Rhylanor (0306-A434934-F) Date: 310-1109
</b><br>
Rumors continue to circulate concerning a major assault by Imperial
forces in the near future. No single objective is noted in any of
these rumors, and official sources have refused to comment on any of
the rumors, but experts believe that an attempted relief of Jewell is
in the offing. 
<p>
<br><b>Rhylanor/Rhylanor (0306-A434934-F) Date: 312-1109
</b><br>
The battles for Rhylanor are over. In an official press release dated
today, the Imperial Navy announced that enemy action in-system had
ceased, with the exception of minor engagements in the outer fringes.
"Mopping up of these forces is proceeding apace," one official stated
off the record. 
<p>
<br><b>Rhylanor/Rhylanor (0306-A434934-F) Date: 348-1109
</b><br>
A major Zhodani task force was badly mauled in the attempt to retake
the Calit system (which was liberated by Imperial forces earlier this
year.) Enemy forces were "dealt a serious blow" in the words of one
officer. Imperial and Colonial forces in the Calit system were
evidently heavily reinforced after the battle to retake the system.
No information is available concerning the battle or any casualties
among the forces involved.
