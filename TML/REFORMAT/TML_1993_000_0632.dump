The only problem I have with this is that the Model-0, -0/bis, and -1
are *all* listed as TL-5 machines.  If the IBM 704 is a model-0, what\'s
a model-1?  And how much preventative maintainance does it take to keep
running?

No, I\'m not.  However, are you trying to suggest that the most powerful
of the integrated circuit computers is only 1.3 times as powerful as the
best discrete transistor systems?  Or that the best modern supercomputer
is about twice as powerful as one of those integrated-circuit
mainframes?

I am suggesting that we chuck Max CP and CP Mux as a basis for comparing
the "power" of computer systems.  It certainly isn\'t a linear scale, and
I doubt that it has any relation to the real world.

This is one area of Traveller where we actually have a number of "real
world" data points to go on.  A -0, -0/bis, and -1 are at least possible
to build with vacuum tubes, relays, and magnetic cores and the like.  A
- -1/bis can\'t; it requires at least discrete transistor technology to
construct (presumably, vacuum tubes are too slow and unreliable for a
system of this complexity).  A -2 requires integrateed circuit
technology in order to be possible, and a -2/bis requires modern
high-speed, high-density technology.

Right.  And the Model-1 is listed as the best possible with TL-5 tech.

The volumes given were *just* the CPU and core cabinets.  That doesn\'t
include the I/O devices (tape drives, magnetic drum, card reader, punch,
and online printer) which were easily twice this volume, judging from
the pictures in the article.  Nor does it include the power supplies and
cooling devices, which were not shown at all, or the amount of space
required for access (after all, you\'ve got to crawl around inside the
machine replacing tubes every day).  In the pictures, the access space
is larger than the cabinets, although presumably you could arrange them
more efficiently.

Well, the 704 had two registers (an accumulator and the
multiplier-quotient register), and three index registers (A, B, and C),
so its CPU is relatively simple (sounds rather like a 36-bit wide verson
of one of the early microprocessors).  Increasing the memory capacity
through paging or segmentation might be a reasonable thing to do.
Several of the things FORTRAN programmers are familiar with were
developed from the 704 instruction set, like the funky 3-way branching
IF statement, the FORMAT statement, and the 72-column line length limit.

I should point out that while the 704 sounds extremely limited by
today\'s standards of multi-megabyte operating systems, multi-dozen
megabyte compilers, and gigabyte disk drives; the first high-level
programming language (FORTRAN) was developed and used quite productively
on machines like the 704.

I can agree with this.  What suprised me is that a Model-1 could be
built with vacuum tubes.  The 704 is one of the most power ful vacuum
tube machines that I know about; feel free to extrapolate.  However,
whatever we come up with will have to buildable with the technology, and
work about as often as not.

Perhaps this is something that we should mention to GDW, and try to have
fixed for T:TNE.  Convert over to some sort of consistent system?

      This is draft material. Do not concern yourself with spelling
 errors  or the like. Rather, we are interested in "big picture" comments.
Are there careers that you want to see? Ones here that are too weak/too
powerful? What do you think about the controlling attributes for the  various
skills (skills that appear in Dark Con and Twilight are, alas,  not
negotiable).


  CHARACTERS

   Characters are the focus of Traveller; they are the alter egos of the
players, and all activity centers on them. Each character is a person within
the game and has abilities and attributes which define his or her actions and
reactions. The character is the fictional Traveller personality; the player
is the real person engaged in playing the game. A player character
(frequently abbreviated as PC) is a character manipulated by a player. A
non-player character (NPC) is a character manipulated by the referee in order
to allow interaction between the player characters and the universe. Once a
player character is generated, he or she continues to live an exciting life
of adventure in the Traveller universe. This life ends only with death or
disability. Nonplayer characters appear and disappear as the referee needs
them.  All characters begin the game the same way: untrained, inexperienced,
and about 18 years of age. Each character is generated with a series of die
rolls. He or she then embarks on an abstract career in order to gain skills
and experience. Ultimately, the character retires or leaves that career,
receives mustering out benefits, and is ready to begin adventuring.
   A Note on Gender and Race: Nowhere in these rules is there a specific
requirement established that a human character (player or non-player) be of a
specific gender or race. While Traveller does include alien races, which are
detailed separately, any human character is potentially of any race and of
either sex.


   Traveller characters are described in terms of innate attributes, skills,
and a number of other characteristics. During character creation, the initial
values for all of these are derived by a combination of die rolls and player
choices. Over the course of a series of adventures, many of these will
increase to reflect skill improvement, advancing age, and the like. The rules
in this chapter explain the   process of character generation.
   In order to make the long process of character generation easier, a
character generation worksheet is included with this game. The worksheet is
largely self-explanatory, but occasional reference to the rules is necessary,
at least for your first few characters. Players should read the rules as they
generate their characters, filling in the appropriate blanks of a worksheet
as they go. Once a character is completely generated, the information from
the unshaded portions of the worksheet should be transferred to a character
record sheet. After that, the   worksheet may be discarded, if you wish. Only
the character record sheet is necessary for play. (Note: Always remember to
save at least one blank copy of each sheet to photocopy for future
characters.)

  CHARACTER GENERATION OVERVIEW

   The abilities and limitations of a character are determined by three
general areas of information: background, attributes, and experience.
Therefore the character generation procedure follows these three general
steps.
   Background: Players determine their homeworlds, as these have a strong
effect on later steps of character generation. They also decide on other
background information, such as social level, name, and sex for their
characters.
   Attributes: Players determine the six basic attributes of their
characters, either by rolling dice or by using a point-based system described
later. These six basic attributes are Strength, Constitution, Agility,
Intelligence, Education, and Charisma.
   Experience: Characters begin to accumulate experience at the age of 17. At
that time, players start making career choices for their characters. Each
career choice represents four years of training and/or experience (four years
being an arbitrary number that helps regulate character generation.) Each
time a player makes a four-year career choice, a hobby may also be selected
for the character. Careers and hobbies provide the character with
all-important skills.
   Each career period (henceforth called a term) ages the character by four
years. At the end of each term, a roll is made to see if character generation
ends. if so, the character\'s pre-game experience is complete. (In other
words, the character is this old when the adventure campaign begins.) If not,
the player makes another three-year career choice. In this way, some
characters will begin the game relatively young and unskilled, but with
attributes undiminished by age, while others will be older and more
experienced, but possibly less resilient than their younger counterparts. If
the referee allows, players who prefer to choose an age for their characters
(i. e. a number of terms) may do so, rather than rely upon random die rolls.
At the end of each term, then, such players simply decide whether or not
their characters will pursue another term. Derived Values: Now that all
changes to skills and attributes are completed, certain values are calculated
that are based on them. These are things like accuracy with different weapons
at various ranges, damage done by bare-handed attacks, and so forth.
   Possessions: Finally, players determine what possessions their characters
have accumulated during their careers.


  CHARACTER BACKGROUND

   When I was a child, Grandfather told us stories at night, stories of dukes
and admirals, of galaxy-spanning empires, of star fleets locked in titanic
battles. And he showed us the shiny radiation scars he had earned in those
battles, scars which were red and ugly and came flickeringly to life in the
dancing firelight.
   None of the others believed the stories. Some said they must have happened
generations earlier than Grandfather\'s time @@others said they could never
have happened. But I believed. And late at night I Iooked up and dreamt of
the stars,   and of others like myself on the cold worlds circling them who
must also look up and dream. And I knew that one day, somehow, I would walk
among them.

   Before generating the specific physical and mental attributes which define
a character, it is necessary to determine the character\'s background, as this
has a strong effect on the rest of the character generation process. The
first and most important step in building the character\'s background is to
determine homeworld
   Homeworld: A homeworld is the world on which a character was raised   and
probably born. It represents the environment which most directly shaped the
early (pre-adventuring) development of the character.
   Homeworld determination must be a mutual process involving both players
and the referee, as the sort of campaign the referee will run will strongly
determine the sorts of homeworlds available. If, for example, the referee
wished to begin the campaign on a pre-stellar technology world poised on the
brink of achieving interstellar space travel, then all of the initial
characters should probably come from that same homeworld. If, on the other
hand, the campaign is set in a region of space where interstellar travel is
commonplace, characters from a wide variety of worlds are possible.
   A character can specify homeworld in several different ways: a speci@c
homeworld can be assigned by the referee; a homeworld can be chosen by the
player (subject to referee approval); a homeworld can be generated randomly
using the tables provided. If a homeworld is deliberately created, by either
the referee or the player, it must contain at least as much descriptive
information as is provided by the homeworld random generation tables.
   Random Generation: Homeworlds can be created using the Homeworld Random
Generation table. Codes are brief statements that describe conditions on the
world; they provide less detail than the referee-created world
characteristics, but they are easy to use and remember. Using the Homeworld
Random Generation table, throw 2D for each of the codes: starport, size,
atmosphere, hydrographics (an asteroid has no hydrographics), population,
government level, law level, and tech level. Die modi@ers are called for when
generating certain codes.
   Referee Generation: Homeworlds can be created using the referee\'s world
generation system (in the Referee\'s Section). The referee\'s system generates
world characteristics: precise numbers which speci@cally de@ne and
differentiate the conditions on a world. For example, two worlds may both be
coded as Wet Worlds (with oceans on 24 to 94 percent of the world): one might
have a world hydrographic characteristic of 3 (and have oceans over 30
percent of its surface), while the other might have a hydrographic
characteristic of 8 (and oceans covering 80 per-cent of its surface). The
World Pro@le Code Equivalents table shows the code equivalents for
translating the worlds generated under the referee\'s system into world codes.
The best way to create a homeworld is to select an established world and use
its description. The character is provided with a background for   a world
which has a relationship with the history of the universe. There is the
possibility of acquaintances on the world, as well as potential for
adventures within the established society of the already-created universe.
   [Homeworld generation material is not included with this draft; you old
hands will know how to fake it.]



   SOME TYPICAL HOMEWORLDS

   Regina (Spinward Marches): A strategic world on the frontier of the
Imperium. Starport A, Medium Size, Dense Atmosphere, Wet World, Moderate Pop,
Hi Law, Average Stellar

   Glisten (Spinward Marches): An industrial asteroid belt. Starport A,
Asteroid, Vacuum World, Hi Pop, Mod Law, Hi Stellar

   Capital (Core): The capital of the Imperium, home of the Emperor, and
center of all Imperial government. Starport A, Medium Size, Dense Atmosphere,
Wet World, Hi Pop, Hi Law,   Hi Stellar

   Terra (Solomani Rim): The original human homeworld, ruled by a
succession of governments over the past 4000 years. Starport A, Large Size,
Standard Atmosphere, Wet World, Hi Pop, Hi Law, Hi Stellar

   Deneb (Deneb Sector): An important industrial world. Starport B, Medium
Size, Dense Atmosphere, Wet World, Hi Pop, Mod Law, Avg Stellar

   Nasemin (Spinward Marches): A backwater world in the border of the
Imperium. Starport B, Large Size, Dense Atmosphere, Water World, Mod Pop, Low
Law, Avg Stellar

   Vland (Vland Sector): The ancient capital of the First Imperium, a
predecessor to the current Imperium. Starport A, Medium Size, Dense
Atmosphere, Wet World, Hi Pop, Hi Law, Hi Stellar

   ************
   Language: The language spoken throughout the worlds to which humaniti has
spread is Anglic (sometimes called Galanglic), a language evolved from
ancient Terran English. All human characters will speak Anglic or a local
dialect of it. Characters from homeworlds which have been isolated from the
rest of human culture for a generation or more will speak Galanglic with a
noticeable accent and with a number of local words added to the vocabulary,
terms which others might find confusing. Other Alien races have their own
native languages, but if they live on a human-settled world will probably
speak at least some Anglic as well.

   Social Standing: Roll 2D6 and subtract 1 to determine initial social
standing (abbreviated SOC) on the character\'s homeworld. This is a measure of
the accomplishments and power of the character\'s parents or guardians (if
raised by other than his or her natural parents). This is not an innate
attribute, and unlike attributes it may change dramatically during character
generation, based on the career choices made. However, a character\'s SOC may
never be reduced below 1 nor raised above F.
   Titles: Social Standing for each character shows the relative position
within society for an individual. Those with Social Standing B+ (11 or
greater) from a High Government world are considered to be noble, and may
assume their family\'s hereditary title. Noble titles are commonly used, even
if the individual is not engaged in local government. At the discretion of
the referee, the noble may have some ancestral lands or @efs on his or her
homeworld.
   Knights: A knight (Social Standing B) is entitled to the use of Sir (or
Dame) before his (or her) name. Characters whose initial SOC is B, and whose
SOC does not increase during character generation, are the sons and daughters
of knights. However, this title is not hereditary and so those characters are
not entitled themselves. Characters who have an initial SOC of less than B
and whose SOC increases to B, and characters whose SOC is initially B, then
is lowered, and then increases to B, have themselves been knighted and can
use the knightly titles of Sir or Dame.
   Baron: Social Standing C entitles the individual to the title Baron (or
Baroness). Or the individual may use the pre@x von, haut, or hault with his
or her name to denote baronial nobility.
   Marquis: Social standing D indicates a marquis (or marchioness).
   Count: Social standing E indicates a count (or countess).
   Duke: Social standing F indicates a duke (or duchess).

   Although player characters cannot advance beyond Duke, noble ranks include
Archduke (16 or G) and Monarch (King or Emperor) (17 or H).
   The Noble Ranks table shows the range of noble titles and their
corresponding social levels.

   Naming: One additional aspect of background is naming. There are several
schools of thought on the nature of names. One school holds that the
character should carry the name of the player; the referee can then  refer to
John or Marsha and everyone knows exactly who\'s who. This usage is convenient
but tends to lose much of the @avor of the campaign. Another school of
thought calls for the use of pseudonyms or fanciful names (for example: James
Doraan Anderson, or Timothy Fairweather; more extremely, Seeker or
Starkiller). As with everything involved in Traveller, the actual choice
depends only on the players and on their imaginations.

   ATTRIBUTES

   Characters are essentially described by six attributes describing the
physical and mental defining characteristics of the individual. These
attributes are generated through a series of die rolls. Roll two six-sided
dice and subtract one from the result a total of six times. Each separate
roll is then assigned, in whatever order the player desires, to one of the
following six attributes: Strength (STR), Constitution (CON), Agility (AGL),
Intelligence (INT), Education (EDU), and Charisma (CHR). Record the results
on paper. Personal attributes are de@ned as follows:
   Strength: The numerical quanti@cation of a character\'s muscular power.
   Constitution: Health, and physical stamina. This determines the
character\'s resistance to disease and ability to continue to work over time.
   Agility: A measure of a character\'s coordination and nimbleness.
   Intelligence: The ability of a character to perform abstract reasoning.
Intelligence primarily affects the ability of the character to learn; it is
not the same thing as common sense. (How much common sense characters have is
determined by the actions of the players themselves.)
   Education: The ability of a character to gain knowledge and experience
from a formal academic setting. This attribute determines how far a character
is likely to advance at a university and serves as a prerequisite for certain
forms of higher education.
   Charisma: A quanti@cation of personality and personability. Charisma
re@ects skills that affect how NPCs react to a character. It is not so much a
measure of physical appearance as of natural charm.
   Values for the six generated attributes may range initially from 1 to 11
(with 6 the average value). As a result of various modi@cations for homeworld
status or self-improvement, characteristic values may ultimately range from 1
to 13. For player characters the values of attributes may not exceed 13;
values do not go below 1 except for the results of calamitous injury or
aging.
   Homeworld Effects On Attributes: Characters\' homeworlds affect their
attributes in a variety of ways. Add or subtract the following values from
the rolled attributes of the character, but subtractions may never reduce an
attribute to zero.
   Size: If from an asteroid, subtract 1 from strength. If from a large
world, add 1 to the strength attribute and subtract 1 from agility.
   Atmosphere: If from a vacuum world, add 1 to agility.
   Population: If from a low population world, subtract 1 from charisma. If
from a high population world add 1 to charisma.
   Technology: If from a pre-industrial world subtract 2 from education and
add 1 to constitution.

   [Homeworld generation is not included in this draft; you old hands   will
know how to fake it.]

   The Universal Personality Pro@le (UPP): Characters in Traveller are de@ned
using the Universal Personality Pro@le (the UPP), which expresses attributes
in a speci@c sequence using hexadecimal (base-16) numbers. In hexadecimal
notation, 0 through 9 are represented by the common Arabic numerals; 10
through 15 are represented by the letters A through F. The highest
single-digit number is 15 (F).
   Attributes are in the following order: Strength, Constitution, Agility,
Intelligence, Education, and Charisma. For example, a character who is
average in all respects would have a UPP of 666666. If he were highly
intelligent, his UPP would be 666B66 (the B indicates an intelligence of 11).
   The UPP allows the referee (and players) to tell the attributes of persons
they encounter. Because the notation uses single digits or letters for each
characteristic, numbers that are normally two digits cannot lead to
confusion.
   Other Characteristics: In the course of character generation the character
will acquire age (in years and in four- year terms), rank, money, skills, and
possessions.
   Nonhuman Attributes: The six personal attributes assume a human character.
Intelligent nonhuman races may have different attributes in place of (or in
addition to) these human attributes.

   Obviously, it is possible for a player to generate a character with
seemingly unsatisfactory values; nevertheless, each player should use the
character as it is created. The career and experience procedures offer a
genuine opportunity to enhance values, given only time and luck. Should a
player truly consider the character so poor as to be beyond help, various
options in the character improvement chapter of this guide are available to
the player to improve attributes. If this still proves to be unsatisfactory,
the referee may allow the   player to roll a new character. After all, the
purpose of the game is to provide players with interesting gaming
experiences, not penalize them for a few poor die rolls at the very
beginning.

Part 2 of 4

(c) copyright 1992, Game Designers\' Workshop

   This is draft material. Do not concern yourself with spelling errors or
the like. Rather, we are interested in "big picture" comments. Are there
careers that you want to see? Ones here that are too weak/too powerful? What
do you think about the controlling attributes for the various skills (skills
that appear in Dark Con and Twilight are, alas, not negotiable).


   ACQUIRING SKILLS AND EXPERTISE

   A newly generated character may enlist in any career allowed by his
homeworld. The Prior Service table lists the homeworld types on which the
career is available and the minimum required attribute and/or social level to
enlist. If the character meets these minimum requirements, enlistment is
automatic.    For example, the Navy career is available on any homeworld with
a tech level of pre-stellar or higher and the requirement for enlistment is
"INT or EDU 7+." Any character whose intelligence or education attribute is 7
or higher may automatically enlist in the Navy. Characters who have neither
an intelligence nor and education attribute of 7 or more may not.
   Terms of Service: Upon enlistment a character embarks on a four-year term
of service. This adds four years to the character\'s age. Each time he
reenlists, it is for a four-year term of service. The Terms Table lists a
character\'s beginning and ending age for each term of service.



   TERMS TABLE

   2 22 26
   3 26 30

   18 86 90
   19 90 94
   20 94 98
   21 98 102




   Default Skills: Certain characters automatically receive default skills of
level 0. A level of 0 for a skill indicates that the individual can undertake
ordinary activities but is not experienced enough to try dangerous activities
or fancy actions. A skill level 0 is suf@cient to prevent a task from
increasing in dif@culty because of lack of skill, although a skill level 0
provides no skill DM.

    Default skills are conferred automatically as follows:

   Characters enlisting in the Navy, Marines, Scouts, Merchants, or Corsairs
, and all characters from vacuum worlds, automatically receive Vacc Suit-0.
   Characters from a world with a tech code of Early Stellar+ automatically
receive Computer-0.
   Characters from a large world automatically receive High Gee
Environment-0.
   Characters from an asteroid world automatically receive Zero-Gee
Environment-0.
   Characters from a world with a tech code of Average Stellar+ automatically
receive Grav Vehicle-0; characters from a world with a tech code of
Industrial to Early Stellar automatically receive Wheeled Vehicle-0.
   Characters from a water world automatically receive Swim-0.
   Background Skills: Characters will have picked up certain skills before
reaching age 18 as a result of childhood hobbies and activities.  Before
choosing a career, each character can pick four skills from the following
list at a skill level of two. Note that the skills are very much dependent
upon the homeworld statistics. [Homeworld generation not included with this
draft; you old hands will know how to fake it]

   Computer (Tech Industrial +)
   Farming (Atmos. Thin-Dense, Hydro 3+)
   Grav Vehicle (Tech Early Stellar+)
   Guard/Hunting Beasts    Gun Combat (Slug Rifle) (Law No-Low)
   Language
   Melee Combat
   Riding (Atmos. Thin-Dense)
   Small Watercraft (Atmos. Thin-Dense, Hydro 3+
   Stealth    Streetwise (Pop. Mod-Hi)
   Survive (Atmos. Thin-Dense)
   Swimming (Atmos. Thin-Dense, Hydro 3+)
   Tracking (Atmos. Thin-Dense)
   Wheeled Vehicle (Tech Industrial+)


   Commissions: Many services have a commission die roll ; in order to be
given a commission, the character must throw the stated number. DMs may apply
to the throw. If the commission is achieved, the character receives rank O1
in the career. A character may attempt to acquire a commission once per term
of service until successful.
   Promotions: In each term of service (including one in which character has
received a commission), a character may attempt to be promoted. Each service
has a promotion number and DMs affecting that promotion throw.  If a
promotion is achieved, the character advances to the next higher rank in the
service. A character is eligible for one promotion per term of service.
   Note that some services (Wealthy Traveller, Rogue, Belter, and Hunter)
have no ranks (and thus no throws for promotion are made), while others
((Diplomacy, Bureaucracy, Barbarian, and Corsair) have ranks but no "O"
ranks, and so no roll for obtaining a commission is ever made. In the Medical
profession there are non-commissioned ranks, but once a character receives a
commission the character is a "doctor" and receives no further promotions.

   Skills and Training: During each term of service, a character acquires
personal skills and expertise. Allowances are made for the character\'s
acquisition of new skills based on terms of service, special duty, promotion,
and personal improvement.

   Terms of Service: In the first term of service the character receives a
fixed skill package which represents training in the core skills necessary to
function in that particular career.   In every subsequent term of service in
that career, the character receives additional levels of skills from a group
of skill areas.  Players receive four skill levels in their second term,
three in their third term, two in their fourth term, and one in their fifth
and every subsequent term.
   Players may divide the levels among the skills listed in the allowed skill
group in any manner desired. If five skills are listed and a character is
entitled to four skill levels, the player may take a level 4 skill in one of
them, two level 2 skills in different areas, a four level 1 skills, etc. If
the character already has a skill of 1 or more in the area, additional levels
are added.

   Special Duty/Adventures:Players who make the indicated die roll on 2D6
qualify for a special assignment or adventure. This die roll is modified by
+1 for every subsequent term spent in the career. That is, there is no die
modifier on the first term, a +1 DM on the second term, +2 on the third term,
etc.  If Players successfully make the required die roll for Special Duty (or
Special Adventure in some careers), they receives additional skill levels
apportioned in the same manner as for those received for subsequent terms of
service. As with subsequent terms of service they receive four levels in
their first or second term, three in their third term, two in their fourth
term, and one in every subsequent term.  Note that the allowed skill group
from which these are drawn is different from the term skills available. These
skills are received in addition to any term skills received. Players roll for
special duty/adventures in every term served, including the first term.

   Promotions: In each term in which a character receives a promotion (not a
commission), the character receives one additional skill level selected from
the group of term skills listed for that term. Note that in some cases skills
are available in subsequent terms which are not available the first term.
Characters receiving a promotion first term may only take their promotion
skill from those listed as first term skills.

   Personal Improvement: Each term a player may chose one level in any skill
desired (provided the character\'s homeworld statistics allow it) as a result
of personal improvement (study, practice, or hobby).  However, characters may
never engage in self-improvement during their first term in a new career, as
their time is fully occupied in the primary education and training associated
with that career.  Whenever characters are entitled to use self improvement ,
they may increase any one attribute by 1 level instead of gaining an
additional skill. However, a character may never increase an attribute more
than once using self-improvement. That is, if a character increased STR by 1
in the second term, it could never be increased in a later term, although
some other attribute could.


   Acquisition of Skills: Each skill listed in character generation is
actually a group of skills, called a Cascade in Traveller. Cascades call for
an immediate selection of a speci@c skill as a result. (Gun Combat is an
example of such a cascade, and consists of four separate ) The player should
select from the skills available. Some cascade skill lists contain skills
that are themselves cascade skills and call for further selection.  Upon the
@rst acquisition of a skill, the player writes the skill name, followed by a
dash and the number 1 (thus: Navigation-1). The second time the skill is
acquired, the number is increased to show greater expertise (thus,
Navigation-2). Further acquisitions of the skill will increase this level.
The higher the level, the greater the expertise in that skill.

   Homeworld Limitations: Certain skills are not available on the character\'s
homeworld. Vehicle skills are limited by the character\'s homeworld tech code,
and weapon skills are limited by the character\'s homeworld tech code and law
code.    Law Enforcement, Corsair, and Rogue characters may select weapon
skills one law code lower than their homeworld\'s law code. Army, Navy,
Scouts, Aviation, Maritime and Marine characters are not limited by their
homeworld law code, nor are characters with a SOC of 11+.

   A character may override the homeworld limitation and acquire a skill not
normally available by rolling 2D for 7+. If that fails, he forfeits the skill
attempt. For example, if a character from an Early Stellar tech code got
Vehicle skill on a skill roll and wanted to try for Grav Belt skill (Avg
Stellar), he must roll 2D. If the roll is less than 7, he loses his Vehicle
skill roll.


   SOCIAL LEVEL

   Different career paths and accomplishments affect a character\'s social
standing, either favorably or unfavorably. Each promotion a character
receives while commissioned increases social level by 1 (to a maximum of 14).
Certain careers also have a minimum social level for commissioned rank;
characters who receive a commission and whose social level is lower than the
minimum immediately have it raised to the minimum level.  Finally, some
careers lower social level, as noted under the heading "other effects."


   AGING

   At the end of a term, add four years to a character\'s age.  When a
character reaches age 34 (the end of the fourth term), aging begins to take
its toll. The Aging table (page 47) must be consulted then and at each
subsequent term\'s end. This table shows the attributes affected (Strength,
Dexterity, Endurance, and eventually Intelligence) and the throws necessary
to avoid the effects of aging. Upon failing a speci@c saving throw, the
indicated reduction is applied to the characteristic.


   ANAGATHICS

   Anagathics are longevity drugs. They help prolong life and prevent aging.
Upon reaching age 30 at the end of the third term of service (but never
before age 30), a character may try to locate a source of anagathics. If
successful and if the supply can be maintained, the character will age ever
so slowly. With luck, the character may reach an age of 100 or more before
old age @nally takes its toll.    If the character wants to use anagathics,
he or she must so specify before making the survival roll for the term. In
deciding to be an anagathics user for the term, the character must make the
following concessions:    For each term in which the character indicates his
or her desire to use anagathics (whether a supply is found or not), his
eligibility for the mustering out bene@ts roll is forfeited for that term.
This represents some of the great expense involved in maintaining a steady
supply of anagathics.    Once the character voices the desire to be a user of
anagathics, the maximum number of rolls on the Cash table becomes two instead
of the usual three rolls. This restriction is permanent even if the character
later gives up taking anagathics. This represents the great @nancial burden
associated with just trying to @nd a reliable supply of anagathics.
   Finding Anagathics: To @nd an available supply of anagathics for the
four-year term, roll 12+ on 2D, with the following DMs based on the
character\'s homeworld: DM +3 if Starport A, DM +2 if Starport B, DM +1 if
Starport C, DM +1 if tech code Early Stellar, DM +2 if tech code Average
Stellar, DM +3 if tech code High Stellar.
   If the character fails the anagathics availability roll, one retry is
allowed if the character rerolls another survival roll @rst (needless to say,
the character must succeed at the second survival roll, or be forced to
muster out).
   On a successful availability roll, the character automatically succeeds at
the aging saving throws for two attributes of his or her choice. In effect,
the character selects the one characteristic (Strength, Dexterity, or
Endurance) which to risk in an aging saving throw. The age 66 line of the
Aging Table (see page 47) requires four saving throws, so upon reaching the
age 66 line, two attributes of choice are automatically saved, and the other
two must be risked in an aging saving throw as normal.    It takes a while
for the total effects of anagathics to be felt. On the @rst term of taking
anagathics, advance to the next line on the Aging Table as usual. However,
for each subsequent term in which a supply of anagathics is maintained, the
character can remain on that line of the Aging Table instead of advancing one
line per term as usual. So, if the character is on the age 34 line, he or she
can stay on the age 34 line as long as a constant supply of anagathics is
maintained.
   If the character ever loses the supply of anagathics for a term, at the
end of the term, roll saving throws twice for each characteristic (but do not
yet advance one line on the Aging Table; it also takes a while for the
effects of anagathics to totally go away). Both rolls must succeed or the
characteristic is lowered by the indicated amount on the Aging Table. This
represents the withdrawal effects from interrupting the supply of anagathics.
If the character continues to abstain from anagathics in subsequent terms,
normal Aging resumes (advance one line per term on the Aging Table as usual).
The double saving throw withdrawal effects occur only at the end of the @rst
term in which the character stops taking anagathics.    If the character
later regains the supply of anagathics, the term in which he begins retaking
anagathics is treated again as a @rst term on anagathics: the saving throw
bene@ts are received, but the character must still advance one line on the
Aging Table. Obviously, anagathics are most effective if they can be taken
long-term without interruption.  A continually interrupted supply can have
devastating effects.
   Recording Age: Notice a character on anagathics will quickly get out of
sync with the Aging Table on page 47. Thus, even though the character\'s
actual age may be 50, if the character has been able to maintain a constant
supply of anagathics, the character will roll a saving throw for only one
characteristic (instead of all three) on the age 34 line of the Aging Table
that term. Next term, the individual will have an actual age of 54, but will
again roll on the age 34 line, and so on. If a character\'s age has ever been
affected by anagathics, so indicate by writing the age as: Age 34 (50).  The
34 represents the character\'s apparent age and, hence, the line of the Aging
Table currently being used. The (50) represents the character\'s actual age in
years. If the character has an available supply of anagathics, list
anagathics as a possession. If the character is currently in withdrawal from
anagathics (just lost the anagathics supply this term), add an exclamation
point after the age: Age 34! (50).



   AGING CRISIS

   If, as a result of aging, a characteristic is reduced to zero, the
character has an aging crisis and becomes quite ill. A basic saving throw of
8+ applies to avoid death.  If the character survives, recovery is made
immediately. The characteristic which was reduced to zero automatically
becomes 1.  This process occurs each time a characteristic is reduced to
zero. If more than one characteristic reaches zero simultaneously, perform a
separate Aging crisis for each characteristic.
   Disability: At a certain point in life, characters may quit adventuring:
when the age 66 line of the Aging Table is reached; when any one physical
characteristic (Strength, Dexterity, or Endurance) permanently equals 1; or
when the sum of all three physical attributes equals 10 or less.  The player
is then free to generate a new character. Quitting due to disability allows
the player to maintain a reasonably competent character.

                    |----|
 
  Hey all you adventurers out there, would you like to participate
in the biggest open ended space adventure game ever?!  This galaxy
contains over 1,000,000 stars, over 4,000,000 planets (yes, that
is six zeros on both of those numbers), and even moons.  There are
currently over 1600 different types of vessels with more to come.
The game control format is very detailed and flexible giving you
excellent control over your race\'s actions.
 
  There are several different types of races whose aspects you can
assume at the beginning of your play.  You can play as the cybernetic
Marauders who have the ability to destroy planets, and whose military
might is feared throughout the galaxy.  You can play the cunning and
elusive Travellers who have the secret means to move planets from
star to star.  You can play as the Transformers, whose secret planet
altering processes are sought after throughout the galaxy.  You can
play as a Power Corporation whose Power Centers increase planetary
efficiency and make everything less expensive to build.  The Traders
are the charismatic (and rich) race who make a healthy living trading
goods along the starlanes.  Pirates are races that have developed a
feared reputation stealthily bypassing planetary defenses, stripping
planetary surfaces, and kidnapping the populace.  And finally, but by
no means least are the Miners, whose development in the excavation
arts earn them a hefty planetary income along with the ability to
get glean credits from places that nobody else can.
 
  Form alliances, start and end wars, build your racial abilities, and
military power until you are a shaker and a mover in the galaxy.
There are almost no limits to what you can do in

                ****** Conquest and Destiny ****** !!
 
  Up to 9000 people can play simultaneously against each other.  It
is a open-ended game, meaning that there is no deadline to win by.
You can compete with players from the US and overseas.  We already
have players from 10 different states, and all are having loads of
fun!  The quick turnaround of the turns helps to ensure fast-paced
action.  The Sagittarian Arm right now is processing every other
day, and eventually will move up to every day.  For those of you
that don\'t want everything so speedy, there are other galaxies
that will be processed once a week, and once a month.  For those of
you that are reading this on a BBS, it will be considerably less
expensive to play electronically, rather than through the mail.  But
you don\'t even need a computer to play this galaxy spanning
adventure!

======================Most Recent Conquest & Destiny Newsletter================
 
                        - Saggitarian Sagas -
                    - Issue #6 - StarDate: 0075 -
                      ----
 
    Welcome, all you players to the sixth issue of the Saggitarian Sagas.
  Much has happened since the last NewsLetter, so sit back and prepare to
  be amused, informed, and outraged.
 
    First off I\'d like to announce a Christmas season promotion.  Do you
  have a friend of yours that\'s interested in the game, but he/she simply
  never has the $10, or the time.  Now, during the month of December, any
  new player package that is sponsered by another player, currently involved
  in the game, will cost one half the normal price, just $5!  Plus, instead
  of the usual $10, you\'ll get $20 in free game credits for starting up a new
  race.  So if you want to start a friend adventuring in The Saggitarian Arm,
  this is the time to do it!!
 
    Many players have suggested additions to the game that I thought I\'d
  throw into the mainstream, and see what all of you thought.  I\'d 
  appreciate any additional enhancements that you may suggest.
 
    *** Thanks to Quincey Koziol, Chris Houck, Jack Vinson, Brian Houge, ***
    ***     and the Beta Testers for a good portion of the following     ***
    ***        suggestions.  Sorry, if I\'ve not mentioned someone.       ***
 
    1- Psionics: a special class of spy?
    2- Galactic Storms: navagational hazards, subsector wide Black Hole,
         or sector wide SuperNovas that destroys anything passing through.
    3- Alien Artifacts: technological wonders, or deadly items like the
         Doomsday Machine from Star Trek.
    4- Farming: a planet attribute that will provide food for pops, possibly
         allowing more populations to be built, and having automatic shipping
         trading routes for excess, Agricultural Centers, coomodities market,
         disrupting supply lines.  population limits based on Agriculture
         rather than planet size.
    5- Governors: specialized planetary managers allowing better taxing,
         efficiency, and planetary income.
    6- Fuel for ships: refueling depots, limited ranges??
    7- Task Force Patrol Routes: automatic movement of battle Task Forces
         to prearranged points within a Sector.  Tactical, and Kinetic scans
         are the only thing allowed.
    8- Automatic withdrawl from the Investment account to cover overspending.
    9- Galactic UN: diplomats (spies??), automatic captured documents (rumors)
         to "due" paying participants, protection for new races
   10- More Environment Ranges: more variety (F-K??)
   11- Orbital Industrial Center: income producing centers that orbit
         around the world.  Zero-Gee Industries??
   12- Combined Orbital ShipYards: Construction Yards that can combine
         the Mineral Plants in the whole system for an increased firepower
         base capability.
   13- Prisioner Transfer: allow races to transfer captured prisioner
         between one another.
   14- Unlimited Planetary Shield Centers:  to make planets more defendable
         against those huge Task Forces.
   15- Kidnap Spies or Commanders: rather than kill them or having to wait
         to capture a particularly annoying individual.
   16- Allowing Traders to Trade at each others trade routes, if allied
   17- A special Battle Task Force that would follow attatched Tracers.
   18- Option on the Navagation Computer that will move a Task Force to
       that position.
 
  Please let me know what you think of these ideas and any others that may
  occur to you.  The human imagination is an unequaled force.
 
    There will be a slight change to the way Action Codes 046, and 047 work.
  Races initiating a strength count will now have the option to center the
  strength readout around their position in it.  For example if a race is at
  position 52 in the count they could see the names for positions 42-62.
 
   047 -Strength Count 
       This action will list the top twenty races in the galaxy, and their
       relative strength, regardless of their racial type. The report options
       are: "1"- will give you the top 20, and "2"- will center it around
       your position.
 
                 owner #,turn #,event #,action #,report option
 
                          ex:  S0010,0001,001,047,1
 
  I\'m also going to be changing the way that Action Code 046 works.  I
  believe that that race\'s type should be a secret, if they want.
  Therefore 046 will only give you your position in the heirarchy, and
  will not list other race\'s names.
 
     I\'ve got two corrections in the serious "DUH!!" area.  The first one
   occurs on KC 5 when you receive Freighters, and can load Interceptors
   on them.  However, I don\'t allow a way to Land them after Loading them.
   Thus below, Action Code 093 is brought into being.  Before this it would
   have been handled in the transfers once you received Carriers.  The other
   mistake is in Action Code 356 (Assassinate Commander or Spy), I forgot to
   include in the description, where the name of the enemy agent went.  Below
   the new format is indicated.
 
  093 -Land Interceptors
      This action allows you to land Interceptors from a Task Force onto
      a planet.
 
         owner #,turn #,event #,action #,task force landing from,
          planet landing on,number of interceptors landing
 
              ex:  0010,0001,001,113,093,AABB11,15
 
  356 -Assassinate Commander or Spy
      This action works pretty much the same as 355, except that instead of
      trying to assassinate the leader (much harder), you\'re trying to get at
      a military commander or a spy.  Again you must know the location of the
      Capital world of the race that own the individual you\'re trying to
      assassinate.  Also it is a lot easier if the commander in question is
      not currently on an assignment.
  
          owner #,turn #,event #,action #,agent number,capitol world,
            enemy agent name,risk factor
  
                     ex: S0010,0030,015,356,1,AABB14,Mask,1
 
 
    Three Action codes have been deleted. 246 - Declare war against
  Consortium, 247 - Declare Alliance with Consortium, 248 - Declare
  Neutrality with Consortium.  One of the secrets of a Consortium is its
  membership.  With these actions codes some could use them and then sit
  back and see who allies, or declares war on them.  If you want to declare
  alliance, war, or neutrality  with a Consortium, you must do it on a race
  by race basis.
 
    There has been a change to the way Companies get interest in their Company
  Funds.  The base interest is 1.5%  The company then gets an additional .2%
  for every different race that owns at least 1% of their stock.  This is
  called the Diversity Index, and the interest is allowed to be as high as 7%.
  The reason behind this is to try and help to discourage "closed companies",
  where the Majority Share Holder keeps 100% of the stock, and never puts any
  on the open market to be bought and sold.  We will see if this helps.
 
    Most of you have probably noticed a new money source in your header
  information, Tax Base.  Many players mentioned to me that there should be
  automatic taxing of the populations a race owns on a turn by turn basis.
  The formula for determining TaxBase is:
 
      number of pops x (1+(total KC of worlds with pops/worlds with pops))
 
  If somebody has a better idea for a formula that encourages world
  development, please tell me.  Ed Greenwood I\'m not.
 
    This section is for players that are communicating through CompuServe.
  For purposes of ease, and expense, the CompuServe players receive their
  turn information through InterNet.  InterNet is hooked up to CompuServe,
  and it is possible to send message two ways.  This is how to send me
  messages on InterNet.  The Asterixes indicate the choice you should enter
  when queried.

  Please try it, and let me know if you have problems with the routine.
  Also, post some messages in the Forum, nothing says that you have to
  communicate only through the game.  As a matter of fact you could even
  advertise your User Account number in the "Public Messages" section.
 
    For those of you that are playing on INTERNET and wish to send a message
  to someone playing on CompuServe, it is handled in the following fashion.
 
    Ex: CompuServe User ID  71202,2523
    INTERNET address: 71202.2523@Compuserve.com
 
  Be warned that, for some reason, every once and awhile, messages get lost
  on the way to the CompuServe gateway.  Where they go, only the UserGod
  knows, so you may want to make several transmissions of your message.
  CompuServe players who wish to send messages to people on INTERNET, use
  the same format as indicated in the section detailing how to send me
  messages on INTERNET, but substitute the new INTERNET address in the
  "To:   >INTERNET:DCANHAM@ELVIS.NCSA.UIUC.EDU" part.
 
    Hey!!...Alright, there are a few wise guys out there.  Ordinarily I
  dont get involved with player messages, as long as there isn\'t excessive
  bad language.  Some wise acre sent a message to another player that
  simulated a bunch of passives that indicated disasterous encounters with
  that players Task Forces, and planets.  This in turn got me a bunch of
  messages on my anwsering machine wondering what the @*!? was going on!
  Very cute, please give me a break!!
 
    The "Events Processed", and "Amount Spent this Turn" section of your
  turn header has been acting a bit flaky from time to time.  I think I\'ve
  fixed it, but keep an eye on it, and make sure that you\'re not being
  overcharged!  Not a thing I want to do.
 
    I normally try and process on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings.
  Which means, to those of you playing electronically, that the turns
  would normally be available the following morning.  HOWEVER!!! sometimes
  there are unavoidable delays (believe me, I\'m interested in getting your
  turns to you as fast as possible) involved with processing.  Please be
  understanding, and try and avoid flooding me with inquiries on where the
  turns are.  If they are going to be later than a day, I will try to send
  an explanatory message.  As an additional note I usually start processing
  at 1800 (6pm) on those days, so you must have your turns to me by then
  if you want them included in that day\'s processing.
 
    There have been a couple of price changes that you should know about
  in the WormHole section.  At KC 13, WormHole Fortresses now cost 800
  credits.  At KC 15 WormHole Sensors cost 75 Credits apiece.
 
    Finally, in the next few StarDates, I\'m going to institute the 
  Security System.  This is to avoid forged turns for players.  We haven\'t
  had any problems with that yet, however I wish to try and close the barn
  door before The Elder Barrians get out.  This could happen ecspecially
  easily for those playing electronically.  I\'ve instituted two Action Codes
  that will not cost anything to use.  If you don\'t want a password, simply
  never institute the first one using 419.  If you do want one, you enter
  the first one using Action Code 419, then you must always use Action
  Code 420 in the very first event of every turn following.
 
 419 -Change Password
     This action will change the password which allows your turns to process.
     Once you enter this event, the password is immediately in effect, as of
     the next turn you process.  For those of you that don\'t yet have a
     password, this Action Code is used to establish your first one.  On the
     turn following the use of theis Code, you must enter a event "000" using
     Action Code 420, or the turn will not process.  This action Code costs no
     "real" money to use.  The limit on the password length is 12 characters.
 
              owner #,turn #,event #,action #,new password
 
                    ex:  0010,0001,001,419,Gleeble
 
 420 -Enter Password
     This action MUST be used every turn once you have established a 
     password.  You must enter this as event "000" of every turn.  If this
     action isn\'t used at the beginning of every turn, the turn WILL NOT
     PROCESS!!!.  This action code costs no "real" money to use.  For those
     of you that don\'t have a password, you don\'t need to use this Action
     Code until the turn following the first time you use Action Code 419.
 
                owner #,turn #,event #,action #,password
 
                     ex:  0010,0001,001,420,Gleeble

Greetings!  We are DORSAI, traders, offering our services to all new and old
Races in the Saggitarian Arm.
     Have you considered the advantages of having trade centers installed
on your planets?  When we install a trade center on your planet and trade
there it not only increases the morale of your populations, but it nets you
a nice income.  You will gain from 3,000 to 10,000 credits (depending on
planet size and development) every time one of our trade fleets calls.
     We offer also the following incentives.
       1. The turn the trade center is landed, we will transfer 5,000
          credits to your race.
       2. You are given a KC 101 Standard Scout, Class 4 with 12 firepower.
       3. That world comes under our empires\' protection.  Upon your
          request, anybody attacking that world will be removed and
          "punished".
 
     We are currently servicing both the N and # quadrants.  Size 7 and
larger planets only, please.

  Sentients wishing to join the Galactic Alliance of Races:
 
  We currently wish to recruit in our alliance Miners, travellers,
  transformers, marauders, power corporations and another trader
  (for a little good competition).
 
   Policies are as follows.
            1-Help any fellow member ASAP.
            2-Report any major incidents witnessed.
            3-Keep yourself out of trouble.
 
   Recent activities are as follows.
            1-Declaring war against the Arains, an impudent race of pirates.
            2-Building up of fellow members.
            3-Exploration of the galaxy.
 
   Why join? For the reasons above, plus the following reason.
   Can your race survive an attack at a major planet with
   minimal loss overall? Before you answer, my race lost its homeworld
   because of a misunderstanding.
      The planet was obliterated by 100,000 KC-392 Interceptors, and a
   Planet Buster Vessel. But my race is still a superpower, nearly
   2,000,000 strength and 6th place overall. We await your reply to our
   offer.

From:  Ponyets Mercantilist Republic, Terminus
Subj:  Diplomatic stumbles addressed
 
        Public opinion on Terminus is mixed towards the recent achievements
        of the republican corporation.  The first material steps of
        CEO Larry Hardin\'s expansion plans have been successful, but
        recent allegations suggest the government\'s diplomacy has not
        been as effective.  Larry Hardin held a press conference today
        to respond to these concerns.
 
Press:  Mr. Chief Executive, is it true that the corporation has
        been collecting files on other races in the galaxy?
 
Hardin:  It is true that the Encyclopedia Office has been compiling a catalog
        of race descriptions.  It has surprised us, however, for these actions
        to be interpreted as suspicious.  The only information we have on a
        race was prepared for the Elder Races Consortium by the race\'s own
        diplomats.  If any race would still doubt us, they are free to request
        a copy of the catalog at no cost.  We are sorry if our curiousity
        has been mistaken for distrust.
 
Press:        Distrust would seem to be a constant problem for your office,
        Mr. Chief Executive.  Your own diplomatic efforts have backfired.
 
Hardin:        Unfortunately, the Republic\'s first attempts at contact may have
        given the impression of duplicity.  Shortly after Incorporation Day,
        I instructed my secretary, Quartz Pirenne, to draft respectful
        letters to several other races.  Pirenne took my instructions too
        literally or imaginatively; he practically kowtowed to the galaxy
        with his pen.  From now on I will be writing my own letters and
        hope to reverse this unfortunate attitude.
 
Press:        What effect will this have on expansion?
 
Hardin:       Hopefully, none.  Up to this point, we would have been hard put
        to respond to trade offers.  As of now, the corporation is
        positioned to respond to requests immediately, in 3-5 stardates,
        or even sooner.  The corporation hopes that our promptness will
        encourage other races to consider us before maxing a new planet,
        because the added efficiency of a trade center can cut hundreds
        or thousands of credits off large builds.

==============================================================================
 
        The consortium of Underdogs United would like to the announce of
    establishment of a planetary delivery service.  Are you tired of
    having a low racial efficiency?  Are you paying too much to raise
    the efficiency of colonized planets?  We can help!
        We have at our disposal the facilities to colonize any planet
    of your choice at an efficiency rating of 90% with the added bonus
    of having a Power Center and a Trade Center on the planet ordered.
    But wait there\'s more - The Power Center will reduce the cost of all
    items built on the planet by a further 20%.
        For only 12000+1000*size+100*orenodes we will deliver a planet from
    our catalog of planets which includes the following planets
    (Environ. Type/Size/Ore Nodes): C/8/29, C/1/43, C/4/20, C/2/43, E/3/29,
    C/6/34, A/5/32, D/6/27, A/4/20, E/8/30, B/4/20, E/1/40, D/3/32, B/5/20,
    A/7/21, E/9/43, C/10/41, A/7/20 and many more!
        As as additional bonus, you can have the planet you order transformed,
    for a 50% increase in the mining and refining plant income from the
    planet.  This special offer costs only 5000Cr.
        Or you can choose your own planet for us to colonize, improve
    and deliver for your enjoyment.
        Contact the leader of Underdogs United, Clawe.

                      Excerpts from minutes of StarDate 60
                       meeting of the Imperial Confederacy
 
The Proellium Empire:  It is agreed, then?  Your people will make the
                       sacrifice?
 
The Aslans:  Yes...and of their own free will?  We will not force one of our
             own into near racial extinction.
 
Dorsai:  We will.  We must.  He is growing much too strong, the need is
obvious.  If we do not weaken him now, he will destroy us totally.  Our
rejection of his offers of alliance have maddened him.
 
                      ********************
 
     The Dorsai Commander watched the sensor displays with a mixture of
triumph and resignation.  Yet another wave of the Shifting Winds interceptors
were attacking the defenses.  The enemy might not get through to the homeworlds
this time, but eventually billions of his race would die.  Multiple escape
fleets had long since been sent far and hidden and the races entire wealth
safely put in investments with the consortium of Elder Races to support them,
but the main populations of the five inhabited homeworld systems would soon
be ash.
     Although the Dorsai had long been traders, their roots were that of
soldiers.  A world of mercenaries - the best in the galaxy and the commander
took a savage glee recalling the opening shots of this war.  99,900
interceptors at a KC level of 101 ripping into Shifting Winds main system.
Destroying over 11,000 hubs from the system defense center before safely
retreating to their carriers.  How the bastards had scrambled!  Unfortunately,
surprise is an advantage that cannot long be enjoyed.  The Shifting Winds\'
response was, as expected, devestating.
     As one might expect a Traveller to do, the next stardate Shifting Wind
moved a planet into the Dorsais\' subsector and massive waves of interceptor
attacks followed.
     "How many interceptors has he lost so far?", growled the Commander.
"Over 300,000", reported the sensor chief with evident satisfaction. \'Weren\'t
expecting a 360,000 hub system defense center, were you, sport?\', thought the
commander, \'and still the fleets to deal with when you do get through that.\'
The minimums had been met, Shifting Winds would spend at least 60 or 70 million
much needed credits destroying holdings worth less than half that.
"He thought he could stand in our way," commented the Dorsai leader, "but he
can\'t even afford the war.  We can outspend him three or four to one and drain
his resources credit by credit if we have to."  "Commander!," interjected
the sensor chief, "He\'s pulling out without destroying the homesystem worlds!"
"Shifting Winds has destroyed all fleets and space defences then left without
destroying our infrastructure and populations?" questioned the commander and
leader as one.  "Correct" replied the sensor chief, "and computer estimates
the assault cost him almost one hundred million credits."  The Commander and
Racial Leader looked at each other with first disbelief then amazed joy.  All
objectives achieved without the expected loss of the home system!!!  "Head us
back to the HomeWorld, Commander," said the Leader, "we have fleet and 
weapons production to order."  "Make it so, helmsman," ordered the Commander,
"Aye, sir, we do indeed.  Shifting Winds obviously needs some instruction
in how to properly fight a war.  He should be quite expert by the time we\'re
finished with him."

                      Playing Hints and Questions
                      ----
 
  Q: If you have more than one Task Force in the same place, and an enemy
     Task Force moves in, which one fights first?
 
  A: The Task Force that moved there last would fight first, then the
     second to last, etc.
 
  Q: What is a Candidate Information Report (332), and why do I keep 
     getting told that there are no Candidates?
 
  A: A Candidate is a "greenhorn" on a Planet or Task Force that has performed
     enough actions, and gained enough experience to be eligable to enter the
     Academy.  If they don\'t have enough experience, they WILL NOT show up
     with Action Code 332.  This action code is used mainly to detect
     commanders whose eligability notification you might have missed due to
     a lot of other activity.
 
  Q: What are Quick Reference Guides?
 
  A: Quick References Guides are a compilation of all the current action,
     and construction codes available to your race type at your CURRENT
     Racial KC.  For the mail players, please have mercy on me and don\'t ask
     for a new one every time that you go up a single KC, it costs you an
     event as well.  You get all the new codes on the KC text attatched to
     your turn.  You can then pencil them in until it gets crowded, and
     then order a new one.
 
  Q: Can I put comment lines in my turns?
 
  A: I have no problems with comment lines.  There must be 5 spaces between
     the end of the event line followed by a semicolon.  you can then put
     what ever you want after that.  For example:
 
       S0001,0010,001,024     ;advancing to Racial KC 10
       S0001,0010,002,023,2001,10,AABB11     ;raising planetary KC
 
     This format is fine for those that wish to have comments.
 
  Q: Why does it take so long for some players to anwser messages?
 
  A: The players that are playing electronically have a better reaction
     time than the people who are playing through the U.S. Mail.  Mail
     players tend to have a 2-3 day wait to get a turn in the mail, and
     then another 2-3 day wait for the response to return to me and be
     processed.  So have patience, those of you who don\'t receive
     next turn responses aren\'t necessarily being snubbed.
 
  Q: I\'m a new player, how do I name my first leader?
 
  A: The anwser I have for this is weak.  Send me a note telling me what
     you want them named.  After that you\'ll be able to handle it yourself.
 
  Q: I keep trying to recruit a Commander off of a planet, and it says that
     there is no individual qualified.  Why not??
 
  A: As far as recruiting goes, "qualified individuals" means those planetary
     or Task Force commanders that have gained enough experience to "qualify"
     for recruitment.  When they gain enough experience, you will be notified
     through a passive.
 
 
                         News Clippings and Rumors
                         ----
                    "these items are not necessary true"
 
  Officals from The Shifting Winds are supposedly arming a giant Task Force
  to try and overrun a first millenium artifact.  A scout found a star almost
  totally encapsulated by a metallic sphere, the scout had just begun its
  scanning routines when a strange purple beam dissolved it into its component
  atoms.  Calculations estimate that the globe had a radius of almost 200
  million miles.  When said officals were contacted, they denied ever hearing
  of such an occurance.
 
  The two companies by the name of Imperial Biotechnic Macronics, and
  Star-Technologies have become proxies in the next stage of the conflict
  that started with "The Debris War".  Funds in the hundreds of millions
  are being poured into the newly created research divisions to finance
  higher and higher levels of conflict.
 
  Galanon the Leader of the Supremos had a minor setback in his reign as an
  undetected assassin blew his cranial structure over the sycophant audience
  gathered to witness his taking of a Heir-Body to produce another, of an
  already prolific line of progeny.  The audience dispersed quickly in a
  desire to clean themselves off and, more likely, to avoid the assassin who
  had disappeared without a trace.  The assassins name was reputed to be
  "Mask".  Galanon (un?)fortunately was to be found to have assumed "room
  temperature (tm)*" almost immediately.
 
  The Salarian Alliance had a reality check when they they thought to
  appropraite some property of The Imperial Confederacy.  Debris from
  13 missile vessels mingled with a close packed Asteroid Belt that used
  to be Salara, the Capitol.  Military forces were caught totally unaware
  as The Proelium Empire sent a minor Carrier Task Force to deal with the
  perceived misappropriation.  Officals of the Salarian Alliance Embassy
  had no comment, although most were seen to be wearing the dark hued
  mourning vestments.
 
  There is a rumor that races, complaining that there are not enough rumors,
  have had their home starsystems slated for SuperNova Destabilizer tests.
  Which in turn should generate a few rumors, thereby fufilling their request.
 
  The NN# Sector received a new star in their constallation as The Shifting
  Winds indulged in a bit of overkill moving his whole starsystem in as a base
  of attack on neighboring stars.  Forces were evidentially caught totally
  unaware (clearing their nasal cavities with their digits) by this attack.
  Members of The Imperial Confederacy have no comment other than to reiterate
  that this is another example of why Travellers, as a whole, should be
  eliminated, "because they upset the natural balance of the stars!".  When it
  was asked "What do Marauders do then?", the anwser was "Entropy IS natural!
  Stellar migration is not!".  Reporters for the SS left, confused.

  In testing some new vessel designs, The Imperium of Aquila recently
  discovered that when a planet has been Transformed, it also receives a 50%
  bonus in vessel builds in firepower capacity.  They were extremly pleased due
  to the ability to build bigger war vessels at a quicker rate.
 
  Rumors are speading that those deemed trustworthy will receive a portion of
  Imperial Biotechnic Macronics stock.  The Proelium Empire is evidentially
  scrambling to find a loophole in the new Diversity Index laws for Company
  interest accumulation.
 
  Scouts encountered several debris fields in the LOS Sector where an
  evidentialy ill-informed Travelller tried to jump a pair of planets into an
  already full star system.  The doomed planets then experienced a
  catastrophic kinetic shield failure, imploding, destroying the worlds
  instantaneously.  Commanders of several scout Task Forces belonging to the
  aformentioned Traveler were executed for reporting erronous information.
  This however was reported to be simply an attempt by some embaressed
  politicians to perform the time honored CYA.
 
  The Skaran Union has been initiating a very aggressive recruitment program
  that has produced an impressive number of Spies and Commanders doing their
  thing in different parts of the galaxy.  Beware the information net being
  laid into place by the canny intelligence master.
 
  A race of Miners calling themselves The Elder Barrians were developing a
  good market in rare earth minerals until their harvesters developed a severe
  case of indigestion after swerving to sate themselves on a platinum vein.
  They "smelt" their finer metals by ingesting the ore, then excreting out the
  finished product.  Evidentially the stench involved with the final process,
  encourages most races to accept delivery after a decontamination period.
 
  Rumors are spreading that the, subtlely named, Killer Tomato Commie Pirates
  are a race to beware of.  Raids of precise military precision have been
  plauging races in the #I subquadrant.  Raiders with a logo of a fanged
  tomato and sickle is becoming a sight to dread.
 
  The Xxaron Federation is becoming a force to reckon with as their military
  and economic might grows.  There are rumors of growing dissatisfaction in
  the ranks of the Galactic Alliance of Races as reports of impending war
  spread throughout the rank and file.
 
  The Imperial Confederacy membership morale grows lower and lower as military
  venture after venture against The Shifting Winds fail to do any real serious
  damage.  The cunning Traveller has repotedly pushed the entire consortium
  into a final desperate tactic of funneling all their resources into a front
  company called Imperial Biotechnic Macronics, that would reduce the cost of
  Technology advancement.  There will reportedly be credits in the billions
  funneled into the company, the majority share holder is The Proelium Empire,
  a race notorious for its crimes against planetary biospheres.  However
  speculators are encouraged to contact them for stock information, rumors of
  outragously high stock values are increasing.
 
  Reports of a massive scanning campaign by Ponyets Mercantilist Republic,
  is rumored to connect desires for a four quadrant domination, with the
  search for an old, Pre-Foudation, homeworld.
 
  In SubSector HE double hockeystick, a fierce battle was waged for planetary
  control as the decedant complacency of an elder race world was disturbed by
  the sudden appearance of war vessels belonging to Pendaris Planet Eaters.
  Pendaris absorbed the Lances, destroyed the Fortresses and proceeded to
  attempt an invasion.  The invasion, which lasted over 20 rounds, was finally
  decided in the favor of the planet, which belonged to the Darklings.
 
  The Proelium Empire refused to appear at a hearing to determine if they were
  responsible for the death of a member of the Slithy Brotherhood of
  Re\'myeld\'s spy network.  While it is proper to kill millions in war, it is
  considered in bad taste to torture to death expensive, and hard to replace,
  spies. Proelium officals have no idea what this story is refering to, and
  add that furthur more, in the future any spies caught looking for the
  Capitol world will be strapped to the prow of a Planet Buster as it
  decends to the fatally curious races homeworld.
 
  *- Those races that are "right" understand whose "tm" (trademark) that is.

	Actually I either generate them from a fix random number seed
and the mainworld data or, if you have edited them, store them in
binary format. The latter is done, quite simply, by writing the
C structures (see code below). The reading in routine is analogous
although slightly complicated by the necessity of mallocing the
structures.
	It would be a fairly simple matter to re-write these so
that the wrote and read ascii files instead of binary files. I
would be happy enough to do this so as to make the storage
files transportable between machines. The simplest way to do this
is to write out a comma seperated field for each record. 
	E.g.: 		Name,orbit,starport,size,atmosphere,hydro...
This, however, is not terribly readable. Nor is it useful to someone 
who just wants to browse a system without a viewer. Adding a label
for each field improves the readability:
	E.g.:	Name:	name
		Orbit:	orbit
		UPP:	XXXXXXXX
This is very bulky, though. If you have the traveller standard, i.e.
one-line per word, even a 132 column printer will have difficulty 
representing the multitude of world data without crippling abbreviations.

	Anyway, I will be writting an add-on to the LIBRARY/SYSGEN
stuff to do ascii reading/writing starting next week. If anyone has
any ideas they want to contribute as to the format of that, please
send it to me. Note please: FORMAT, not CONTENT. The content is
already defined by what LIBRARY/SYSGEN produces. The format should be
extensible, in any event, to cater for further upgrades across the
board.

    'body' => 'Greetings all,

I read over the stuff from GDW.  I thought over the effects of the
planetary environment of the character.  (That was really all that
they included.)  So...

Gravity:
It\'s pretty easy to understand why a person from a high gravity
planet would have a +1 strength.  However, I do not understand why
such a person should suffer a -1 to agility (dexterity).  Consider:
you and I are used to an environment where objects fall at 9.8
meters per second acceleration.  Now, what about someone who is
used to objects falling at say 15 meters per second per second?
That means that they will have to be 50% faster in terms of
reaction to catch a falling object, or to recover from stumbling or
whatever.
     So, dexterity (agility) would be Higher, not lower in such an
environment.
     Low surface gravity of the homeworld will have the opposite
effect unless the planet has sufficient technolgy to provide grav
plates for health reasons.

Atmospheric Pressure:  (Low partial pressure of Oxygen)
Persons in a low pressure environment have an increased efficiency
of lungs.  (Something about elevated red blood cell production, I
believe.) It is well known that person\'s unused to such low
pressures have difficulty exerting themselves in such an
environment.  The converse has been shown to be true in that long
distance runners sometimes train at high altitudes.

Thus, atmosphere\'s with low pressure will tend to increase one\'s
constitution (endurance).  Higher pressures than normal will tend
have the reverse effect.

I do not really understand why a person on an airless world would
have an increased agility (dexterity) though.  An object will have
less drag when it falls, but that really only comes into the
picture when you are trying to catch a falling feather: 
Insufficient grounds for a +1 agility.

In my estimate, these physiolgical effects will be well known and
used in high tech societies.  So, your Imperial Military Forces
will operate aboard ships with a slightly lower pressure, and with
the gravity turned up slightly higher than normal.  In combat they
depressurize completely, and artificial gravity is lowered to
reduce strain on the hull (and prevent falling structural beams a
la Star Trek).

Asteroid and orbital based societies will also take advantage of
these physiological effects.  Lower pressures tends to put less
strain on a ship\'s hull and life support systems, though they would
not increase gravitation to above 1G, but they would not employ
artificial gravity below 1G as that induces some physiological
health penalties.

However, if these asteroid or orbital societies do not have
artificial gravity (or centrifuges), there\'s gonna be severe
problems:  brittle bones, little musculature, heart problems, etc.
etc. etc.

Thus:  High Gravity planets:  Strength +1
                              Agility  +1
       Low Gravity planets:   Strength -1
                              Agility  -1

       High pressure planet:  Constitution -1
       Low pressure planet:   Constitution +1

Hope this helps,

    'body' => 'Greetings all,

I read over the stuff from GDW.  I thought over the effects of the
planetary environment of the character.  (That was really all that
they included.)  So...

Gravity:
It\'s pretty easy to understand why a person from a high gravity
planet would have a +1 strength.  However, I do not understand why
such a person should suffer a -1 to agility (dexterity).  Consider:
you and I are used to an environment where objects fall at 9.8
meters per second acceleration.  Now, what about someone who is
used to objects falling at say 15 meters per second per second?
That means that they will have to be 50% faster in terms of
reaction to catch a falling object, or to recover from stumbling or
whatever.
     So, dexterity (agility) would be Higher, not lower in such an
environment.
     Low surface gravity of the homeworld will have the opposite
effect unless the planet has sufficient technolgy to provide grav
plates for health reasons.

Atmospheric Pressure:  (Low partial pressure of Oxygen)
Persons in a low pressure environment have an increased efficiency
of lungs.  (Something about elevated red blood cell production, I
believe.) It is well known that person\'s unused to such low
pressures have difficulty exerting themselves in such an
environment.  The converse has been shown to be true in that long
distance runners sometimes train at high altitudes.

Thus, atmosphere\'s with low pressure will tend to increase one\'s
constitution (endurance).  Higher pressures than normal will tend
have the reverse effect.

I do not really understand why a person on an airless world would
have an increased agility (dexterity) though.  An object will have
less drag when it falls, but that really only comes into the
picture when you are trying to catch a falling feather: 
Insufficient grounds for a +1 agility.

In my estimate, these physiolgical effects will be well known and
used in high tech societies.  So, your Imperial Military Forces
will operate aboard ships with a slightly lower pressure, and with
the gravity turned up slightly higher than normal.  In combat they
depressurize completely, and artificial gravity is lowered to
reduce strain on the hull (and prevent falling structural beams a
la Star Trek).

Asteroid and orbital based societies will also take advantage of
these physiological effects.  Lower pressures tends to put less
strain on a ship\'s hull and life support systems, though they would
not increase gravitation to above 1G, but they would not employ
artificial gravity below 1G as that induces some physiological
health penalties.

However, if these asteroid or orbital societies do not have
artificial gravity (or centrifuges), there\'s gonna be severe
problems:  brittle bones, little musculature, heart problems, etc.
etc. etc.

Thus:  High Gravity planets:  Strength +1
                              Agility  +1
       Low Gravity planets:   Strength -1
                              Agility  -1

       High pressure planet:  Constitution -1
       Low pressure planet:   Constitution +1

Areas of Expertise: Atari ST, C, HP-?8 calculators, Postscript, awk, sed, *sh
Projects currently involved in (in various stages of completion):
  Porting the various Traveller-utility software to the ST.
  Creating generic RPG/Wargame database software to automate rule lookups,
    with specific interest in Library Data, Charts & Tables, and Rules
    for my favorite games (Notably Traveller/MT and Star Fleet Battles).
    Eventually, this should have a portable C interface, as well as utility
    programs to sort through the data in various ways.  Could be used in
    conjunction with sector/subsector viewers, character generators, ship
    design programs, trade&commerce programs, etc. so that the data would
    already be available, and all that would have to be ported to different
    machines would be the user interface.  I\'m looking at gdbm, awk, curses,
    and C to be the lowest common denominator here.  I\'m trying to find out
    more about SGML to be the format to store data in.
  Improving the currently available software to be more complete and useful.
    I already have done a good deal of work on the trade&commerce program, and
    I\'m hoping to get ahold of the ship design program to play with.

I\'d like to express my personal thanks to you, as list moderator, for taking

      This is draft material. Do not concern yourself with spelling
 errors  or the like. Rather, we are interested in "big picture" comments.
Are there careers that you want to see? Ones here that are too weak/too
powerful? What do you think about the controlling attributes for the  various
skills (skills that appear in Dark Con and Twilight are, alas,  not
negotiable).


   REENLISTMENT AND MUSTERING OUT

   Characters may reenlist for continuing service. Eventually, events will
force a character to leave the service to muster out.

   Reenlistment: Generally, a character is free to leave the service or to
remain for another term, depending on the individual\'s goals and desires. As
always, war, peace, and other events loom ever-present over the character,
and then others may decide the course of his career.

   Each service has a reenlistment number; in order to undertake a subsequent
term of service, a character must throw that number or greater (no DMs are
allowed). If the throw is not successful, reenlistment has been denied, and
the person must leave the service and muster out into the game. If the throw
is 12 (exactly), the needs of the service require that the character serve
another term, regardless of his or her personal desires.

   Because a character may be required to serve another term, the
reenlistment throw is required at the end of each term of service, whether
the character intends to continue or not.

   Changing Careers: Most human characters have only one career in their
lives, although a few humans are daring enough to make a complete shift from
their current career into a totally new career. The Traveller player
character is one of these rare individuals.

   Although entry into a character\'s initial career is automatic in a
player\'s first term, players who chooses to change careers must make the
reenlistment die roll for their new career to enlist (in addition to meeting
the prerequisites for the career). This enlistment die roll is made with a
die roll modifier of -1.

   Retirement: A character may serve any number of terms voluntarily and may
leave after any term (provided a mandatory reenlistment throw of 12 exactly
does not occur). A person may retire any time after the end of the @fth term
served in a single career. Retirement grants the individual an annual
retirement pay (in addition to any mustering out bene@ts); rates of
retirement pay are shown in the Retirement Pay table.

   Mustering Out: When a character leaves a chosen career, either through
retirement or failure of the reenlistment roll, he is eligible for mustering
out bene@ts. The two Mustering Out tables indicate the nature of these
bene@ts: one provides travel, education, and material bene@ts, while the
other provides cash severance pay. Each table is matrixed by service and a
single die roll. When mustering out of the service, a character is allowed to
consult these tables based on total terms of service and on @nal rank. Note
that only the last career served in counts toward mustering out benefits, and
only the terms served in that career are used to determine number of allowed
die rolls.

   One bene@t roll is allowed for each full term served in the
career(exception: see Aging). Note that if a character serves only half a
term, that term does not count toward mustering out bene@ts.

   In addition, a character who has achieved rank O1 or O2 receives one extra
roll, while a character with rank O3 or O4 receives two extra rolls. A
character who has received rank O5 or O6 receives three extra rolls and, in
addition, may apply a DM of +1 to die rolls on the Skills and Bene@ts table.
Characters with the skill of Gambling-1+ or higher may add +1 to the die roll
on the Cash table.

   A character is free to choose between the Bene@ts table and the Cash
table, but no one may consult the Cash table more than three times
(exception: see Aging) during the mustering out process.

   For example, a character who has served four terms of service and has no
rank is eligible for four mustering out bene@ts. She may roll a total of four
times, distributing the rolls as she desires between the two tables, provided
only that she may roll no more than three times on the Cash table. The player
must designate the table being used before rolling the die.

   In addition to the skills acquired while actually in service, the
following skills and substantial rewards can be acquired through the
mustering out procedures.

   Retirement Pay: Any character who leaves the service at the end of the
@fth or later term receives retirement pay. This pension is paid at the
beginning of each year, effective upon leaving the service, and may be
collected at any class A or B starport. If from a pre-stellar of lower tech
homeworld, retirement pay may only be collected on the homeworld.  The table
indicates the rate of pay, which is dependent upon the character\'s total
terms of service. Service beyond the eighth term adds Cr2000 per additional
term (this bene@t is waived for each term in which the character opted to
take anagathics: see Aging and also Anagathics).

   Retirement pay is not available to characters who have been Barbarians,
Corsairs, or Rogues.

   Travel Allowances: The mustering out procedure makes a variety of bene@ts
available which may generally be called travel allowances. Such allowances
take three basic forms: money, passages, and Travellers\' Aid.

   Money: The Cash table indicates speci@c amounts of money which become
available. Some portion of the money should be considered severance pay or
life\'s savings; the remainder is a travel allowance.

   Passages: The Skills and Bene@ts table includes passages (tickets for
interstellar travel). They are acquired in blank, and each represents one
passage (interstellar voyage) between one world and the next world visited by
the starship. They are available in three classes: high passage (@rst-class
accommodations worth Cr10,000), middle passage (second-class accommodations
worth Cr8000), and low passage (frozen- sleep accommodations worth Cr1000).
Passages may be retained, or they may be cashed in at 90 percent of their
face value. Passages are not available to characters from pre-stellar or
lower tech homeworlds; these results should be ignored and the die rolled
again.

   Travellers\' Aid: The Travellers\' Aid Society is a private organization
which maintains hostels and facilities at all class A and B starports in many
parts of human space. Facilities are available (at reasonable cost) to
members and their guests.

   Travellers\' Aid Society membership may be acquired upon mustering out
while using the Bene@ts table. Membership may be achieved only once per
character. Receipt of membership in the Travellers\' Aid Society upon
mustering out may be construed as a reward for heroism or extraordinary
service to the Society rather than an of@cial bene@t of the service.

   Membership is for the life of a character and is not transferable. The
Travellers\' Aid Society invests its member- ship fees and other income; it
uses its capital and return to provide bene@ts to its members. Every two
months it pays dividends in the forms of one high passage to each member.
This passage may be used, retained, or sold.

   The Travellers\' Aid Society is active only in areas where interstellar
travel in commonplace. If the character\'s homeworld is not in such an area,
as determined by the referee, this result should be ignored and another die
roll made.

   Material Objects: The mustering out procedure makes several types of
objects available: weapons, instruments, forensic kit, a letter of marque, a
watch, or a starship.

   Weapons: The Bene@ts table indicates a receipt of a weapon; in such cases,
a character may choose any weapon.
   If, while mustering out, the same bene@t is received again, the character
has the option of taking another example of the same weapon, selecting a
different weapon, or taking the bene@t as +1 in skill in the weapon category
previously received. For example, the bene@t weapon entitles the character to
select any weapon, so he may choose a cutlass.  On the next bene@t roll, he
again receives weapon as a bene@t. He could select a different weapon, choose
cutlass again, or elect to take expertise in the weapon category he has
already received (giving an expertise of Large Blade-1).

   Instruments: A Doctor may receive a full set of instruments for treatment
of injuries and illnesses. The set includes surgeon\'s instruments, diagnostic
tools, and a supply of drugs suitable for most purposes. Basic value of the
set is Cr5000.

   Forensic Kit: A Law Enforcer may acquire a forensic kit to test for
evidence at the scene of a crime. The kit includes equipment to test for
@ngerprints, residues, poisons, gasses in the air, and so on. The kit also
includes a still camera for recording the scene. Approximate value of the kit
is Cr9000.

   Watch: Bureaucrats may receive the proverbial gold watch for their years
of service. Typically, this item has a value of Cr100. On a throw of 7+, it
will have a value of 2D6 x CR100.

   Letter of Marque: A government may issue a letter of marque authorizing a
Corsair to raid the shipping of its enemies. Such a Corsair receives
quasi-of@cial status as a privateer. A letter of marque has no monetary
value; it provides a positive DM for receipt of a ship as a bene@t.

   Starships: Several types of starships are available as mustering out
bene@ts: a scout/courier, a safari ship, a lab ship, a corsair, a seeker, a
yacht, or a free trader. A Scout/Courier is a very common type of dispatch,
survey and exploratory vessel within human space. A Safari Ship is an
excursion vessel intended for trophy-taking (real or photographic)
expeditions to other worlds. A Lab Ship is a mobile base for scienti@c
analysis and investigation. A Corsair is an armed commercial raiding ship. A
Seeker is a Scout/Courier modi@ed for asteroid prospecting and mining. A
Yacht is a noble\'s plaything used to entertain friends and undertake
political or commercial missions. A Free Trader is an elementary interstellar
merchant ship plying the space lanes carrying cargo and passengers.


   *************

   Scout/Couriers are technically loaned to ex-Scouts and are subject to
recall; because of upheaval in the Imperium, the Scout/Courier is effectively
owned by the characters but cannot be sold. Corsairs are owned by the
character. Regardless of how many times a character receives a Scout/Courier
or a Corsair as a bene@t, he can receive only one ship.

   Other ships are subject to 40-year loans. The @rst ship bene@t receipt
provides the ship with a liability for the loan. If the bene@t is received
more than once, each additional one is considered to represent actual
possession of the ship for a 10-year period. (The ship is 10 years older, and
the payment term is reduced by 10 years.) A character may own a ship, free
and clear, by rolling the ship bene@t @ve times (once to obtain it, four
times to pay off the sequences of payment); the ship is 40 years old.

   *******************


   We need a system for shared ownership of starships, particularly in the
case of merchant characters. Terms and rank should contribute to "shares" in
a ship, with a total of maybe 100 shares. Characters need a minimum of, say,
20 shares between them, with each additional share representing 6 months of
the 40-year mortgage.

   Scouts probably get a cut on any mineral wealth or technological salvage
on newly surveyed worlds (or at least officers do), which may be converted to
shares in a scout/courier.

   A Seeker should come for free if the Belter makes a strike (see career
description). Otherwise, nothing. (No retirement bennies for being a belter,
either.


   Corsair? I\'m not sure of this one, and I\'m inclined not to allow it.  We
don\'t want characters tooling around in hot ships I wouldn\'t think.



   INITIATIVE

   Initiative represents a character\'s ability to remain cool and act most
effectively in combat situations. Characters with a high initiative score
will move further and/or achieve more actions in a combat round than will
characters with low initiatives. This is not because the high- initiative
characters are any faster, but simply because they react more quickly and
spend less time hesitating.

   Initiative values range from 1 to 6, with beginning characters tending to
start out on the low end of the scale, then increasing as they gain
experience in combat. Each combat turn in Traveller is divided into six
phases, counting backward from 6 to 1, and characters get to perform one
action in each phase equal to or less than their initiative level. The combat
chapter explains this all in a bit more detail, but it should be obvious even
now that initiative is very important if you are to be involved in combat.

   Each character\'s initial initiative is determined by the types of careers
that character has pursued. All characters start with an initiative of 1. If
any terms were spent in the Navy, Army, Marines, Aviation, Nautical, Law
Enforcement, Corsair, Hunter, Barbarian, or Rogue careers (regardless of how
many terms were served or how many different careers were served in), add 2
to initiative. If any special assignments or special adventures were rolled
(regardless of how many) add 1 to initiative.

   For example, Bo Johnson has spent one term in the Army and two in the
merchants, in which he had a special assignment. He begins with an initiative
of 1. The Army stint would give him a +2 (total of 3), and the special
assignment gives him a +1 (final total of 4).



   SKILL AND ATTRIBUTE DERIVED VALUES

   Once the character has @nished all steps of character generation affecting
skills and attributes, the following values, which are derived from skills
and attributes, can be calculated.

   Hit Capacity: Hit capacity is a measure of the amount of damage (hit
points) a character can take before suffering serious injury. Hit points can
be suffered in any of seven different parts of the body: left leg, right leg,
left arm, right arm, head, abdomen, and chest. The hit capacity of the head
is equal to twice the character\'s Constitution (CON2). The hit capacity of
the character\'s chest is equal to three times the sum of his Strength and
Constitution (STR+CON3). Each of the other body parts has a hit capacity
equal to two times the sum of the character\'s Strength and Constitution
(STR+CON2).

   Weight: A male character\'s weight in kilograms is equal to eighty, plus
four times Strength minus Agility, or [4(STR@AGL)]+90. (One kilogram is
approximately 2.2 pounds.) Thus, a character with a Strength of 6 and and an
Agility of 1 would weigh 100 kilos (about 220 pounds), while a character with
a Strength of 4 and an Agility of 8 would weigh 64 kilos (roughly 141
pounds).

   Physiological differences, particularly in bone structure, result in
smaller body masses for women. Therefore, weight in kilograms for female
characters is calculated by substituting 65 for 80 in the formula, or
[4(STR@AGL)]+65. Thus, a female character with a Strength of 6 and an Agility
of 1 would weigh 85 kilos (about 187 pounds), while a female character with a
Strength of 4 and an Agility of 8 would weigh 49 kilos (roughly 108 pounds).

   Load: A person can lug a considerable weight of equipment, even cross-
country, but there is a limit. In Traveller a character may carry, without
being heavily burdened, a total weight in kilograms equal to three times the
sum of his Strength and Constitution (STR+CON3). This is called the
character\'s normal load. Up to twice this weight can be carried, but the
character is considered burdened and has movement reduced, as explained later
in the rules. A character may lift loads up to four times this amount and
carry them short distances (50 to 100 meters), but this counts as hard work
under the fatigue rules (as explained later). Note that characters may add
their load capacities to lift heavy objects.

   Throw Range: The distance (in meters) a character can throw a one-
kilogram weight accurately is called the character\'s throw range. Throw range
is four times the character\'s Strength (STR4).

   Martial Arts Combat Damage: Martial Arts Combat damage indicates how many
hit points loss a character in@icts on an opponent when that opponent is
successfully hit during melee combat. Martial Arts Combat damage is
determined by multiplying Martial Arts skill by Strength and dividing by 10,
rounding fractions down. The result is the number of hit points the striking
character will in@ict per successful attack. (Note: A result of 0 is
considered 1.)

   Example: Oscar has a Strength of 9 and a Martial Arts skill level of 8.
98=72. 72v10=7. Therefore, Oscar will in@ict 7 hit points per successful
Martial Arts attack.



   STARTING MONEY AND INITIAL EQUIPMENT

   Just as characters have a history of careers and contacts before the start
of a Traveller adventure campaign, they also will have accumulated equipment
and savings. In order to re@ect this fact, players generate starting money
for their characters, then use that money to buy the equipment they desire.

   Starting Money: In general, during each career term, a character gains a
certain base cash value multiplied by the character\'s Social Level.  The base
cash value is determined by the Tech rating of the character\'s homeworld.
This rather generically represents both a character\'s earning power and
ability to save. Of course, the money itself represents not only savings, but
also equipment accumulated. (That is, after starting money has been
calculated, any of it that is spent on equipment is considered to have been
spent over the course of the character\'s life thus far, not all at once. And
any money left over is considered savings.)

   As has been stated, Social Level is typically the value used when
calculating starting money. The career descriptions list exceptions to this
rule. (For example, belters receive no money for terms served as Belters, but
may have made a strike, and earned considerable money from that.)

   Finally, while it may be somewhat easier to generate all starting money
after character generation is complete, it is actually more accurate (and
more enjoyable) to do so term by term as characters progress through their
careers. This is so because Social Level often changes during character
generation. For purposes of fairness, it is important that all players either
do it the one way, or the other. Your referee will tell you which way she or
he prefers.


  CASH BASE VALUES

   Tech             Cash
   Pre-Industrial   CR10
   Industrial       CR100
   Pre-Stellar      CR500
   Early Stellar    CR1000
   Advanced Stellar CR5000


   Initial Equipment: After generating a character\'s starting money, a player
can look through the equipment chapter and purchase items appropriate to the
character. While doing this, there are a few things to keep in mind.

   First, on many worlds of the future, it is illegal to carry knives,
pistols, or other weapons. Even if something is legal that doesn\'t
necessarily make it wise. If you walk into a bank with a laser rifle across
your back, a revolver strapped to your thigh, and a hunting knife in each
boot, you can expect trouble from the locals.

   Next, buy equipment that is appropriate for your conception of your
character. Your referee will reward you for adhering to a realistic character
concept.

   Finally, before buying equipment, ask your referee if he or she has any
guidelines for you to follow speci@c to the campaign you will be playing. For
example, laws concerning what is or is not legal vary greatly from locality
to locality in Traveller, so depending upon where your characters will be,
you may be allowed more or less than usual. As well, your referee may decide
that certain items of equipment are easier or harder to @nd in your
character\'s locale, which could also affect your purchase of equipment. By
following your referee\'s guidelines, you\'ll help to ensure that your
adventures have a consistent atmosphere.

All very well, but this is also a game. For game balance purpose
any advantage should be balanced by a disadvantage (Which is why
GURPS orcs are always so talented and GURPS elves tends to be
neurotics ;-).

In part one, you have a disagreement between three-year and four-year
terms in one of the paragraphs about a third of the way through.  (I know,
it\'s almost a trivial error, but my experience has been that data
disagreement is harder to ferret out.)

Social Standing:
Why not make SS something more meaningful in terms of character generation?
The general concept outlined below is that one\'s initial social standing,
as well as homeworld (good addition there, guys.) helps determines what
careers options a character has.  Here\'s my idea (in rough form):

1.  Roll SS in the usual way. (If I read this right, its 2D6-1.)  This
    gives a value between 1 and 11, unmodified.

2.  The number of career opportunities available to a newly-generating
    character (if the career is not already agreed-to) is equal to the sum
	of the different ways that SS or less could be rolled.  That is:

	For initial SS of:     You get this many possible careers:
         1                       1
		 2                       3
		 3                       6
		 4                      10
		 5                      15
		 6                      21
		 7                      26
		 8                      30
		 9                      33
        10                      35
		11                      36


You might choose to set it up so that you get between one and eleven
opportunities.  Alternatively, you might choose to set it up so that the 
number of opportunities is equal to the possible ways that number could 
be rolled.  (That is 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, 6-6, 7-5, 8-4, 9-3, 10-2,
11-1.)  This would represent a societal pressure to perform according 
to your station in life.

Of course, all of this depends on how many different career paths actually
exist, and how many (and which) are available on a character\'s homeworld.
Obviously interstellar security is out for a TL6 homeworld (with
exceptions, of course).

You could use the numeric listing to order possible career paths.  For
example, "outlaw" is number 1, and is always available, even at SS 1.
Likewise rogues, belters, pirates, and so forth will be low-numbered
careers, while courtesan, dandy, and noble will be high-numbered careers.
Other paths will fall where they belong.  In fact, you could place Navy
careers more highly numbered than army careers to obviate the SS check on
the enlistment roll.

You could make the number be the highest-profile career available.  Then,
if enlistment fails, the character can proceed to lower and lower-profile
careers until somebody takes him (her/it) or (he/she/it) becomes and
outlaw.

I\'m happy to discuss this in more detail, if you want to.

Lookin\' over what we got from GDW:

I noticed that the Corsairs & Law enforcers are only allowed
weapons from 1 tech level lower than the law code of the home
world.

So the cops on planets with Extreme law can\'t carry *any* weapons?
How do they strike terror into the hearts of the repressed masses?

I would assume that Corsairs would have access to weapons from off
planet too.

They also included provision for giving skills to those below 18.
Sounds good.  But I would make the following additions to the list
that kids can aquire:

Robot Operation (Why not?  We got computers, why not robots?)
Pilot (aircraft/ship\'s boat etc.  There are some hot kid pilots out
     there)
Or how about the Inborn skill cascade?
Artisan
Carousing
Instruction
Jack of all Trades
Leader

Or what about academic skills?
Physics
Bio
Chem
History
Genetics
Robotics
Medical

BTW, I am unfamiliar with Twilight 2000 skills & stuff.  Can
someone please post a scale of how much a skill level translates
into ability?

I gather a Medic-3 is no longer a full fledged doctor or surgeon.

I liked Scott\'s comments about homeworld environmental effects.  They make
sense (to me at least).  The point about balancing advantages and disadvantages
is only relevant when the player is given the choice.  For a randomly generated
or GM allocated home world this is less important (stochastic variation will
balance things for you).

No imperium, therefore no unified scout service.  Certainly no Imperial
scout ships for new scout characters.  There ought to be plently of old scouts
floating around but they will be very very very old.

The share idea seems like a nice way of handling a loan when nobody
would be willing to loan the large quantities of money necessary.  Shares
could also be a way of providing some form of yearly income to the players.

Would providing shares as mustering out benefits work?
First \'share\' is worth so many shares, second worth less and so forth.
(e.g. 15 for the first, 10 for the second and 5 for every receipt thereafter)
Maybe a flat system would work out better (5?, 10? per receipt).  Also, some
share could be awarded for final rank.

Then let players buy shares from the other shareholders when they earn
enough money.  The economics would have to be worked out (because if the
dividend from the share is too big, you wouldn\'t sell and if too small
they are a terrible investment).


>   Corsair? I\'m not sure of this one, and I\'m inclined not to allow it.  We
>don\'t want characters tooling around in hot ships I wouldn\'t think.

If interstellar trade is collapsing, then piracy will also be collapsing.
When small empires are reopening the trade routes, piracy will lag behind a
bit (but given the resale price of a slightly damaged ship and its cargo and a
few slaves, one catch will set you up for quite a while).

Then again as it has been pointed out several time on the tml, it isn\'t
excessively expensive or difficult for a decent population world to
provide adequate anti-piracy protection for merchants for every system
it routinely trades with.  So if a player gets a corsair, they also get lots
of big repair bills.

      This is draft material. Do not concern yourself with spelling
 errors  or the like. Rather, we are interested in "big picture" comments.
Are there careers that you want to see? Ones here that are too weak/too
powerful? What do you think about the controlling attributes for the  various
skills (skills that appear in Dark Con and Twilight are, alas,  not
negotiable).



      NOTE: JOT, each award allows skil level 0 in all skills of any 1

      SKILL LIST


      The following skills are available for Traveller:

      Acrobatics (Acrobat - AGL)

      Act/Bluff (Charm - CHR)

      Admin (Economics - EDU): The individual has experience with
bureaucratic agencies, and understands the requirements of dealing with and
managing them.

  Astrogation (Space Vessel - INT) [Tech = pre-stellar +] (Serves as: Sensor
Ops-1): The individual has training in interplanetary and interstellar
astrogation.
  The starship astrogator plots the course and ensures that information is
available to the pilot and crew as they need it. The astrogator interprets
the long-range data provided by the ship\'s scanners and detectors.
  Astrogation expertise qualifies a character for the position of astrogator
on a starship.

  Autogun (Heavy Weapons - STR) [Tech = Industrial +): The individual can use
high-rate-of-fire slug-firing weapons, including machineguns, autocannons,
and VRF Gauss Guns. These are usually crew-served, semiportable, and are
often vehicle-mounted.

  Bargain (Interaction - CHR): The individual has an awareness of the
techniques and practice of commerce in all its expressions. Bargaining may be
used to estimate resale value of items.

  Battledress (Spacehand - CON) [Tech = pre-stellar +] (Includes: Vacc Suit):
The individual can operate battle dress, a high-tech military armored suit.

  Biology (Science - EDU) (Serves as: Genetics minus 1): The individual has
skill in the life sciences, and understands the structure, functioning,
growth, evolution, and distribution of organisms.

  Bribery (Vice - CHR): The individual has had experience in bribing
officials in order to circumvent regulations or ignore cumbersome laws.

  Carousing (Charm - CHR) (Serves as: Service minus 1): The individual is a
gregarious and sociable individual who is well adapted to meeting and
mingling with strangers in unfamiliar surroundings.

  Carpenter (Artisan - AGL)

  Chemistry (Science - EDU): The individual has skill in the science of
inanimate matter, and understands the composition, structure, properties, and
reactions of elements and compounds. Chemistry skill applies to inanimate
matter, not living organisms.

  Communications (Space Tech, Technician - EDU) [Tech = industrial +]: The
individual is trained in the use, repair, and maintenance of communications
devices.
  While nearly everyone can press the button and make a communicator
function, this skill is necessary to be able to under stand why the device
does not work correctly, as well as to be aware of the details and
limitations on the device\'s possible use.

  Computer (Technician - EDU) [Tech = industrial+] (Serves as: Robot Ops
minus 1): The individual is skilled in the operation of electronic and fiber
optic computers (both ground and shipboard models).
  While any character can use a computer to retrieve data that is freely
available, computer skill is required to circumvent the computer\'s
programming. Computer skill is required to pro- gram a computer.

  Climb (Explore -CON)

  CPR Gun (Heavy Weapons - STR) [Tech = industrial+]

  Construction (Engineer - EDU)

  [Diagnosis: Cascade of the Medical - EDU - skill]

  Demolition (Crime - AGL): The individual is experienced in the proper
handling, placement, and efficient use of explosives.

  Disguise (Vice - CHR): The individual is experienced in modifying his
mannerisms and appearance to prevent recognition.
  The quality of the disguise varies according to the result of the uncertain
task.

  [Energy Pistol: Cascade of Energy Weapons (Gun Combat - AGL) [Tech = pre-
stellar+]]

  [Energy Rifle: Cascade of Energy Weapons (Gun Combat - AGL) [Tech = pre-
stellar+]]

  Early Firearms (Gun Combat - STR) (Weapon): The individual knows how to use
any primitive firearm which depends on separate powder and ball rather than
on cartridges.

  Electronics (Technician - EDU) [Tech = industrial+]: The individual has
skill in the use, operation, and repair of electronic devices. The person is
considered handy in this field, with the equivalent of a green thumb. This
skill includes the repair of laser and energy weapons.   Use the standard
diagnosis and repair task rules for the repair of electronic devices.

  Energy Artillery (Artillery - AGL)  [Tech = pre-stellar+]: The individual
can use battlefield high-energy weapons, including lasers, plasma and fusion
guns, and meson guns.

  Energy Weapons (Heavy Weapons - AGL) [Tech = pre-stellar+]: The individual
is familiar with a variety of military energy weapons. These are usually
vehicle mounted.

  Farming (Animal Handling, Science - INT)

  Fleet Tactics (Tactics - INT) [Tech = pre-stellar+]: The individual has
been trained formations and maneuvers of naval operations. Fleet Tactics is
used in command of two or more starships.

  Forensic (Perception - INT): The individual is skilled at gathering and
interpreting evidence at the scene of a crime or accident. Special forensic
equipment is sometimes required. Crude forensic equipment is available at a
tech code of Industrial; forensic equipment from higher tech codes is more
reliable and gives more detailed information.

  Forgery (Crime - AGL) The individual has developed some skill at faking
documents and papers, with a view to deceiving officials, banks or patrons.

  Forward Observer (Artillery - INT) [Tech = industrial+]: The individual has
been trained to ad- just artillery fire from distant batteries or from ships
that are in orbit.
  Modern fire support is a tremendously effective weapon, but it is,
nonetheless, virtually useless unless it can be accurately directed.

  Gambling (Vice - CHR): The individual is well-informed concerning games of
chance, and he is wise in how to play them. He has an ad- vantage over
nonexperts and is generally capable of winning. Gambling, however, should not
be confused with regular risk-taking.

  Genetics (Science - EDU): The individual has training in the science of
organisms. Genetics is a combination of Biology and Chemistry (with Chemistry
applying to living organisms instead of inanimate matter).

  Geology (Science - EDU): The individual has gained experience in searching
out mineral wealth on the surfaces of worlds and in deep space.
  The skill of Prospecting allows an individual to have greater likelihood of
discovering mineral deposits. This skill alone is not sufficient for the
discovery of vast mineral wealth; but it does provide a greater probability
of an individual discovering what is there.

  Grav Vehicle (Vehicle - AGL) [Tech = early stellar+]: The individual can
use an air/raft, floater, flier, grav belt, and all types of grav vehicles.
Grav vehicles are the major transportation form on most worlds with a tech
code of Early Stellar or greater. Most people are aware of the basic
operation. Grav vehicles can be dangerous to operate in high-speed situations
or in bad weather.

  Gravitics (Space Tech - EDU) [Tech = pre-stellar+]: The individual can use
and repair gravitic devices. Gravitic devices use the principles of gravity
modules. This skill is used to understand, repair, assemble, and operate grav
modules.

  Grenade Launcher (Heavy Weapons - STR) [Tech = industrial+] (Weapon): The
individual can use a grenade launcher.

  Ground Tactics (Tactics - INT) (Serves as: Ship Tactics minus 1): The
individual has training and experience in small unit tactics (up to and
including units of 1000 troops, or individual spaceships). This skill is not
to be confused with strategy, which deals with the reasons for the encounter
and the intended results of the en- counter; strategy is the realm of the
players, rather than the characters.

  Guard/Hunting Beasts (Animal Handling - CON): The individual is skilled in
control ling, directing, and training animals in guard or hunting duties. The
creatures are generally carnivore/chasers.

  Gunnery (Space Tech - EDU) [Tech = pre-stellar+]: Gunnery is a specific
naval skill in the operation and use of one of several types of starship
armament.

  Heavy Artillery (Artillery - STR) [Tech = industrial+]: The individual is
trained in using howitzers, mortars, and mass drivers as battlefield weapons.

  High-G Environment (Explore - CON) [Size = Large or Tech = early stellar+:
The individual has experience in an environment having a gravity of 2Gs or
more. A high-gravity environment exerts considerable stress on the body and
often does bodily harm to those not accustomed to dealing with extreme
gravity. High gravity severely limits the range of slug throwers, but has
little or no effect on lasers and energy weapons.

  Hovercraft (Vehicle - AGL)[Tech = pre-stellar+, Atmos = Standard+](Serves
as: Large Watercraft minus 1, Small Watercraft minus 1): The individual is
skilled in the operation of the hovercraft. The character\'s homeworld must be
tech code Pre-Stellar with a standard or dense atmosphere.

  Instruction (Interaction - CHR): The individual has the ability to teach
and motivate.

  Interrogation (Interaction - CHR): The individual knows the psychological
arts of interrogation. The individual will be able to extract more
information from a subject than is normally possible.  There is no direct
psychological or physical assault on the individual interrogated; instead,
the ability of the interrogator derives the information. The interrogator has
a high ability to detect lying and to piece together hints from a large
number of interrogations.

  Intrusion (Crime - AGL): The individual has experience in clandestine
methods of acquiring goods that belong to others. An individual with
Intrusion can pick locks, open locked safes, and pockets.

  Jeweler (Artisan - AGL)

  Large watercraft (Vessel - CON) [Hydro = dry+] (Serves as: Hovercraft minus
1, Small Watercraft minus 1): The individual is skilled in the operation of
large watercraft, including submersibles. The character\'s homeworld cannot be
a Desert World.

  Leader (Determination - CHR): The individual has lead others through
difficult situations, and he also possesses a knowledge and self- assurance
which work together to form a capable emergent or appointed leader.

  Map (Explore -CON)

  Marketing (Economics - EDU): The individual is skilled in the marketing of
goods, and he understands the business of buying and selling.  Uses of the
Marketing skill are governed by trade and commerce rules.

  Mechanical (Technician - AGL) [Tech = industrial+]The individual has skill
in the use, operation, and repair of mechanical devices. The person is
considered handy in this field, with a talent similar to that of a green
thumb. This skill includes nonenergy weapon repair; it does not include
Engineering.   Mechanical skill allows a character to operate mechanical
devices easily, and, in addition, he can repair them quickly and efficiently.

  Metallurgy (Artisan - AGL)

  Mining (Engineer - EDU)

  Navigate (Explore -INT)

  Observation (Perception - INT)

  [Parachute/Paraglide: Cascade of Aircraft- AGL [Atmos = standard+]]

  Persuasion (Charm - CHR): The individual is skilled acting to persuade
groups to take a course of action.   Preparation is critical to the use of
the skill of Persuasion.  Persuasion is most aptly applied to large numbers
of people through an effective use of either live or recorded media.
  While the skill of Persuasion is similar in some respects to the skill of
Leader, Persuasion is not the same. Leadership involves responsibility,
knowledge, and action, and a leader will always try to choose and direct the
best course. Persuasion implies only the ability to influence others, whether
for their own good or not. Individuals with high levels of Persuasion may
become propagandists.

  Physics (Science - EDU): The individual has training and experience in the
science of matter and energy.

  Pickpocket (Crime - AGL)

  Pilot (Space Vessel - AGL) [Tech = pre-stellar+]: The individual can
operate starships and interplanetary craft. This skill includes both
interplanetary and interstellar aspects of large ship operation. The single
most important ship crew position is the pilot, responsible for control of
the starship\'s liftoffs, landings, and routine flight.
  The term pilot refers to interstellar ships; much of the interstellar ship
operation, however, is similar to that of interplanetary craft, and Pilot
applies to large interplanetary craft (100 tons and up).

  Psychology (Perception - INT)

  Recruiting (Charm, Interaction - CHR): The individual is familiar with the
most effective means of approaching individuals and presenting proposals for
employment, couched in terms most likely to pro- duce acceptance.
Recruiting affects both the quality and quantity of recruits who will respond
to a request for application. Recruiting can obtain nonplayer character
hirelings with skills suited for speci@c tasks. Leader, on the other hand,
tends to attract indiscriminately all within the range of the character\'s
personality, skill or no skill.

  Research (Perception - INT): The individual has a broad understanding of
the techniques that are used in researching information relating to people,
places, and events.

  Riding (Animal Handling - CON): The individual is skilled in controlling
and riding draft animals, beasts of burden, and transport animals. Animals
remain a prime form of transport on many worlds, and a trained individual
knows the basics of animal control enough to ride and control them (if the
animals are also properly broken and trained).

  Robot Ops (Technician - AGL)  [Tech = pre-stellar+]: The individual is
trained in overseeing robots and in instructing them in their specific
duties.   Under ordinary circumstances, a person with Robot Ops automatically
succeeds in instructing the robot. For more complicated situations, de@ne a
task for the robot to understand.

  Robotics (Science - EDU) [Tech = pre-stellar+] (Serves as: Robot Ops,
Computer minus 1): The individual is trained in designing, building, and
repairing high- tech robots. The Robotics skill serves as Electronics minus
1, Gravitics minus 1, Mechanical minus 1 when dealing with robots.

  Screens (Space Tech - EDU) [Tech = early stellar+]: The individual is
skilled in the operation of a variety of protective equipment developed for
starships. Screens include nuclear dampers, meson screens, and black globe
generators.

  Sensors (Space Vessel - INT) [Tech = industrial+]: The individual can
operate a variety of modern sensors. He is also familiar with interpreting
their readings.

  Service (Charm - CHR): The individual is experienced and capable in the
care and feeding of passengers.   Service skill represents a general
knowledge of cooking, personal care and attention, and other areas of
experience which will make passengers and crew happy and content with their
conditions of passage.

  Ship\'s Engineering (Space Tech - EDU) [Tech = pre-stellar+]: The individual
can operate and maintain spacecraft maneuver drives, jump drives, and power
plants. A skilled engineer is essential for the proper operation of any
starship. Engineering experience enables an individual to operate the vital
drives of starships (and any craft with a fusion power plant), as well as to
maintain the machinery against failure.

  Ship Tactics (Tactics - INT) [Tech = pre-stellar+]: The individual has been
trained in the operation of a starship or spaceship in battle.  Ship Tactics
is a skill which is used by individuals who are in command of a single ship
in combat.

  [Slug Pistol: Cascade of Slug Weapons (Gun Combat - STR) [Tech =
industrial+]]: The individual can use slug-firing handguns.

  [Slug Rifle: Cascade of Slug Weapons (Gun Combat - STR) [Tech =
industrial+]]: The individual has been trained in the use of modern  combat
rifles.

  Small Watercraft (Vessel - CON)  [Hydro = dry+]:(Includes: Hovercraft minus
1, Large Watercraft minus 1): The individual is skilled in the use of small
water craft, including submersibles. The individual\'s homeworld must be tech
code Pre-Indust to Pre-Stellar and cannot be a Dry World.

  Stealth  (Acrobat - AGL):The individual is skilled in covert activity.  The
individual remains unobserved by moving quietly and by taking maximum
advantage of available cover. Stealth is of no benefit against electronic
surveillance devices or robots.

  Stone Mason (Artisan - STR)

  Streetwise (Determination - INT) [Pop = moderate+]: The individual is
acquainted with the ways of local subcultures (which tend to be similar
everywhere in human society) and thus is capable of dealing with strangers
without alienating them. Close-knit subcultures (for example, some portions
of the lower classes, trade groups such as workers, and the under- world)
generally reject contact with strangers or unknown elements. Streetwise
expertise allows contact for the purposes of obtaining information, hiring
persons, purchasing or selling contraband or stolen goods, and other shady or
borderline activities.

  [Surgery: Cascade of Medical - EDU]

  Survey (Space Vessel - INT)  [Tech = pre-stellar+](Serves as: Sensor Ops
minus 1): The individual is skilled in mapping and charting star systems.
Survey is a skill conferring expertise to produce accurate maps and
directories of previously unexplored or uncharted stellar territory.  Survey
allows an individual to accurately determine the characteristics of an
unknown or unclassified world. It allows an individual to correctly produce
maps and information about star systems as well.

  Survive (Explore - INT): The individual can live off the land or stay alive
in situations where most individuals would have trouble finding food, water,
or shelter.   The likelihood of Survival (no matter how good) allowing a
character to find breathable air in a vacuum is rather slight, but Survival
would allow an individual to use any tools at hand to build an adequate
shelter or to locate caves or natural features which could assist in
survival.

  Swim (Explore -CON) [Hydro = dry+]

  Tac Missile (Heavy Weapons - STR) [Tech = industrial+]

  Tracked Vehicle (Vehicle - AGL) [Tech = industrial+](Serves as: Wheeled
Vehicle minus 1): The individual is skilled in the operation of tracked
vehicles. The individual\'s homeworld must be tech code Indust to PreStellar
and cannot be a Water World.

  Tracking (Perception - INT): The individual can track and hunt animals and
people in the wild. In animal encounter situations, this skill enhances the
chance of surprising such animals and of surviving such encounters when the
animals are dangerous.

  [Trauma Care: Cascade of Medical - EDU]: The individual has skill in
treating injuries.

  [Unarmed Melee Combat: (Cascade of Melee - STR)] The individual is skilled
in hand-to-hand martial arts, and can fight without weapons or with typical
improvised weapons such as clubs or bottles. The use of unarmed melee combat
skill is governed by the combat rules.

  Vacc Suit (Spacehand - CON) [Tech = industrial+]: The individual has been
trained and has ex- perience in the use of the standard vacuum suit (space
suit), including armored battle dress and suits for use on various planetary
surfaces in the presence of exotic, corrosive, or insidious atmospheres.
Nonbreathable atmospheres or hostile environments can be easily overcome by
the correct use of protective equipment. However, the danger of minor mishaps
becoming fatal remains great.

  Wheeled Vehicle (Vehicle - INT) [Tech = industrial+](Includes: Tracked
Vehicle minus 1): The individual is skilled in the operation of wheeled
vehicles. The individual\'s homeworld requires tech code Indust+ and cannot be
a Water World. Having skill in a one of the categories of vehicle allows the
character to operate that specific vehicle in a safe and efficient manner.
Vehicle skill is used by characters for operation and as a DM against
accident, it may also be used to assist in repairing and maintaining a
vehicle. Mishaps may involve throwing a tread, broken axles, collisions, and
so on.

  Willpower (Determination - INT)

  Xeno-Biology (Science - EDU) [Tech = pre-stellar+]

  Zero-G (Spacehand - CON) [Tech = pre-stellar+ or size = asteroid]: The
individual has been trained to work in a zero-G environment.   When any
action is attempted, the problems of recoil and inertia can handicap or
render helpless individuals not trained to compensate for it.   Individuals
who lose control may not continue until they have reoriented themselves and
regained control.



      TNE SKILL LIST


      TNE skills are shown divided into the skill clusters (formerly known in
T, MT as "cascades"). The listing of such a cluster in the career tables
indicates the availability of any skill included in the cluster.  Each of the
skills also has its controlling attribute listed parenthetically with it.

      Cascade skills under the house system refer to several skills contained
beneath one umbrella, which are all connected so that knowledge of one aspect
confers at least some knowledge of the other aspects. When a character
receives a cascade skill, he/she must choose one subset to specialize in.
This specialty uses the full level of the skill, while all of the other
subsets of that cascade skill are used at half that level.

 NOTES

  @Demolition functions as a subset of the Combat Engineering skill.  Combat
Engineering allows the PC to place and clear minefields, construct and breach
field fortifications, construct bridges, ramps, and firing positions, and, of
course, to blow things up. Demolition only allows the PC to blow things up.
Any task that uses Demolition skill can be done by a PC with Combat
Engineering using his/her full level. A task that lists Combat Engineering as
the required skill refers particularly to the non-blowing things up portion
of that skill, and Demolition skill is not relevant.

  @Skill list above includes an experiment: slug-throwing weapons use STR as
the controlling attribute while energy weapons use AGL (called Dex in
Traveller). This is an experimental compromise between Traveller, which uses
DX for all firearms, and the House System, which uses STR.  What do you
think?


 House Rules System Equivalencies (Twilight: 2000 2d Ed, Dark Con, Cads &
Dinos)

  Some of the following are rough parallels, while others are identical.  For
example, the Intrusion skill is functionally equivalent to the Lockpick skill
of T2K2 and DC, but in addition to the picking of mechanical locks, allows
the defeat of higher technology electronic systems. Survive has the same
overall effect as the Foraging skill of T2K2 and C&D, but allows for
non-terrestrial environments as well.

  Survive is equivalent to Foraging
  Intrusion is equivalent to Lockpick

  I\'d originally though of private-mail to Loren on this; then I 
  decided that the rest of the TML was entitled to know my opinions.  
  As a result, this will read like it\'s been written to GDW - which it 
  really is, in a sense.

  1)  Why the change from base rolls of 2D6 to 2D6-1, and the 
  limitation to D (13) on characteristics?  If this was done strictly 
  for compatibility with T2K2 and DJ, I\'d question whether the change 
  is appropriate at all; what you\'ve seemingly done here is change a 
  16-base system to a 13-base system (since characteristics are now 
  on a 1-13 instead of 0-15 basis).  The 13-base system has a higher 
  level of granularity; the characters near the "racial norm" will be 
  less differentiated from each other.  It seems to me that the use of 
  this pattern in T2K2 and DJ was making something different for the 
  sake of making it different; I see no advantage to the new pattern, 
  and the Traveller/Megatraveller pattern has seniority.  Better to 
  revise the others and make T2K3 and DJ2 use the old 16-base pattern, 
  which allows for "finer" discrimination in physical/intellectual 
  capabilities.  Better still to switch to a 20-base system (2D10 if 
  you want the bell shape (my preference); 1D20 if linear is OK) for 
  all of the games; you will get still more differentiation among 
  characters, with the additional side effect of Education (in those 
  games that have it) potentially being a description of exactly how 
  many years the character has spent in formal schooling.

  2)  I _do_ approve of moving Social Standing from a UPP attribute to 
  background information.  In most campaigns that I have played 
  in/talked to others about, Social Standing was a piece of 
  information that had little, if any, relevance to the game.  The old 
  Vargr form of Charisma was too volatile for use with human 
  characters, but was certainly a bit more relevant to play.  

  3) The changing of END to CON and DEX to AGL appears to me to be 
  strictly cosmetic, as does changing the order of appearance in the 
  UPP.  If done for compatibility, the same comments as I made in 1) 
  apply.

  Overall, I\'d have to say that the new system isn\'t _bad_; the nits 
  I\'m picking are because I _have_ played Traveller for almost its 
  entire lifetime, and have gotten what I think is a good feel for the 
  game; I typically don\'t even look at tables much any more.  More 
  seriously in need of overhaul is the ship design rules; I hope that 
  those will be RFC\'d (Request For Comment) here as well.  I\'m working 
  toward some ideas that would be appropriate for a stellar 
  environment that\'s ripe for rebirth, as TNE is supposed to be; I\'ll 
  RFC them on the TML when I have gotten them thrashed out enough.  
  Obviously, they\'ll be based on the MT rule set; They should be as 
  portable to TNE as the current world generation system is.

  I\'d like to see some solid info on alien races this time around; 
  DGP\'s Megatraveller Alien series was off to a good start, and the 
  original Alien Modules weren\'t bad, but could have stood some 
  expansion.  Let\'s see the alien stuff early on, and DON\'T change the 
  system as soon as you\'ve gotten off to a good start, like has 
  happened twice before.  I wonder if that was a contributing factor 
  to DGP leaving the Traveller add-on market...  I\'d also like to see 
  more info on minor races this time, and some solid background info 
  that can be used to allow for campaigns in space outside the former 
  Imperium (more specifically, within the other major interstellar 
  empires, and with _any_ of the races that might be seen within a 
  particular sphere).  

  The TNE blurb I saw on the back of the Arrival Vengeance folio seems 
  to imply that certain fundamental characteristics of the universe 
  can be altered at the referee\'s discretion.  Is this true, or am I 
  reading to much into the blurb?  If so, I\'d appreciate knowing what 
  kinds of things can be accommodated by the rules for this kind of 
  change; I like to stay within an "officially sanctioned" universe; 
  the couple of times I did my own thing, someone came out with what 
  appeared to be sanctioned material that, If I used it, would have 
  rendered my prior work DOA.  I bit the bullet, and resolved that I\'d 
  stick to the real thing to avoid this in the future.  The Foreven 
  set-aside was something of a godsend in this respect; it gives me a 
  place to try out ideas without having to worry about being blown out 
  of the water by official material.  On the other hand, while it 
  tells me how things will play in Peoria (B-776978-A, 1032 Foreven), 
  it doesn\'t indicate how they\'ll play in New York (yes, the one on 
  Terra) or Regina, or Vland, or Capital... you get the idea... ;)

  \'Nuff said; the nice people here on the TML don\'t have to listen to 
  me ramble on and on...

Hans points out that in order to keep characters balanced, there
should be drawbacks to being from different origins as well as advantages
and it is necessary to keep \'em balanced.

True, but still you gotta admit, that a person from a slightly higher
gravity planet with a slightly thinner atmosphere with a high tech level
and a class A starport is probably gonna be a bit healthier than your
average Joe from a low gravity, low tech, thick atmosphere world with a
class X port.  :-)  So, if you\'re gonna introduce the benefits of living
on nicer worlds, you may as well make it realistic.

Personally, I roll the character up FIRST, then Select the homeworld.
High strength means High gravity origin etc.  I think That explains a
lot.

On to the Draft character stuff...

The new draft asks if characters can be trusted with Corsair ships.
Why not?  It\'s worked in Traveller before.  And a good ref won\'allow
what they don\'t feel comfortable with anyway.  I say leave \'em in.

***
There was a list of characters eligible for a +2 to initiative.  They
list Navy, Army, Marines, Law enforcers and others, but conspicuously
absent from the list was the Scout Service.  Probably a typo or a misprint.

***
There was also included a formula for the weight of a character given
stength and agility.  I don\'t really understand it.  My reading of it is
that when a man and a woman who have the same strength and agility, the
man weighs considerably more.  Not true.

In my experience, when a man and woman are of the same weight, the man is
still stronger.  Your formula goes against this.  My fiancee\' has 11 kilos
and 20 centimeters on me, and I\'m still stronger.  It just don\'t fit with
real life.  (shrug)

  Herewith my comments to part two of the TNE character generation 
  rules.

  General Comment and question:  This appears to be the equivalent of 
  the basic character generation procedure.  Will there be an advanced 
  procedure as well?

  Question:  Is there a limit on the number of skills that may be 
  acquired?  Under the Traveller/Megatraveller system, skill levels 
  were limited to the sum of INT and EDU; under the TNE system as 
  presented so far, the sum if INT and EDU will be lower, but the 
  number of skills can be significantly higher (a character that does 
  20 years in a service [not improbable] will accumulate a minimum of 
  14 skill levels, if he does not receive special duty or promotions.  
  If he promotes every term, and gets special duty in every term, he 
  will accumulate 33 skill levels.) - potentially almost triple the 
  sum of INT and EDU, for an "average" character.

  Does the new system assume that the skills will be consciously 
  selected by the player?  It seems to read that way, although I 
  suppose that a referee could decide that it must be done via die 
  roll...

  Why is there a limit of one application of self-improvement to a 
  particular skill?  I\'ll concede that this will tend to force 
  characters to be more rounded, but there are unrounded individuals 
  in the real world, and I always felt that part of a campaign was 
  dealing with the situations that will arise when you discover "You 
  mean _nobody_ knows how to drive a ground car?  How are we supposed 
  to get to the city, then?"  Also, it seems to me that people can put 
  a lot of effort into their hobbies, and in some cases will know more

Actually, I believe it is energy which kills.  5.56mm bullets come from
smaller cartridges than 7.62mm ones, and so have less kinetic energy when
they leave the barrel.  Being lighter, they are more affected by air
resistance than 7.62mm bullets, so they lose more energy on the way to
the target, which is why 5.56mm rifles have shorter ranges than 7.62mm
rifles.  (This is all inexpert opinion based on what I\'ve read when this
sort of discussion comes up on the newsgroup sci.military, by the way.)

In fact, in the days of Striker, in which a gauss rifle\'s penetration was
not that much better than a 9mm ACR\'s, I tended to prefer the ACR.  Firing
DS ammo, its penetration was 6 to the gauss rifle\'s 7, which wasn\'t too bad.
And the ACR, being lower tech, could get ammo from more planets than the
gauss rifle - if the worst came to the worst, it could fire ordinary slug
ammo, which had a much lower penetration than DS but a much better penetration
than an empty gauss rifle.  Slug ammo, being even lower tech, was readily
available on any world civilised enough to be of interest and uncivilised
enough to let characters wave ACR\'s around. :-)

to me concernign nursing (I\'m not one, but I hav several
friends who are).

1) the idea of "Nurse" being one "rank" on the Medical
profession list is somewhat absurd. Nursing is a specialized
profession which has a different set of tasks to perform.
While the sorts of structures that exist today might be
modified heavily (though other trav professions don\'t make this
assumption) it would seem that using the contemporary term
is confusing.

2) the medical cascade doesn\'t really contain any skills
appropriate ot a nurse. Trauma ops (?) is somewhat appropriate,
and a level of diagnosis, but not actual surgury. Unless,
"level-1" surgery perhaps is a first-aid/assistant/lower level
sort of thing.

Under MT, I had considered making a nurse profession, or
setting requirements to qualify for being a nurse. Medical-2
(being inbetween Medic and Doctor) was appropriate. The only thing
I though really came close to the rest of a Nurses skills was
Steward. I note that steward has been removed from the skill
list (correct?) Something like it should be on for nurses.

With the specialization/cascade of the medical skill, perhaps,
Pharmacology (not really chemistry or biology) should be an
additional skill. Perhaps a nurse would have it at level 2 (in
the old system, at least) and level 3 for a doctor (can prescribe
medicine). Nurses spend alot of time memorizing the effects of
various drugs when they are in school :-).

Nursing really should be it\'s own profession, or at least not the
same track as a doctor (perhaps nurses would be on the "enlisted"
track, and doctors on the "officer" track). BTW, how would
military medical personell be handled?

One could have
e1 trainee (physical therapist ?)
e2 Nurse
e3 Nurse who\'se been to Grad school ( I forget what these are)
e4 Nurse Practicioner
01 Intern
02 Resident
03 Doctor
04 Surgeon
05 Cheif Surgeon

or something like that. I noted the rank structure seems to have
a desire to fill in every rank from 1-6. Why is this necessary/desirable?

Part of the real problem is that (on the nurse track as I\'ve deliniated
it) there is not always an inexorible progression of rank. Many nurses
are quite content to be nurses and not advance, and they get their
priveledges by seniority, etc. A nurse only haveing "doctor" as her/his
end goal is silly though. I submit this partially also in the interest
of not discouraging women from traveller and role-playing by having
misrepresentations of a (still) female dominated profession.

say that my mom will live  :-)  I\'ve just read four weeks of TMLs
in one sitting (gads - I must be crazy!), and will posting various
and sundry in response.

I have a post from Jim Kellerer to upload, about psionic controls,

that.  I will probably get Jim\'s stuff online this weekend.  I also
have news blips to send to Cynthia H., when I can those uploaded

I know I owe Jim B. at NUSC an explanation for the formation of
gas giants vs the formation of terrestrial planets, but I will save
that for another post in the cause of trying to keep the verbosity
down to a minimum.

And now, what follows is another nerd attack.  It\'s a little long,

That was not at all the "argument" of that discussion, of which I
was the author.  The discussion was about the formation and retention
of atmospheres during planetary formation.  The central concept is
that only large and dense terrestrial planets can form and retain
atmospheres, because only those planetary bodies can exert sufficient
gravitation force on the lighter gases such that they are retained
in adequate quantities.  This is not an argument per say, but the
current accepted theory in the earth and planetary science community
for how atmospheres form.

The point I was originally trying to make is that you have to have
a sufficiently large and dense terrestrial planet in order to make
an atmosphere during planetary accretion.

True, but it is a third or fourth order effect.  Gravitation force
and weight fractionation are the primary effects in the fractionation
of the atmosphere, as governed by the Boltzman equation as discussed
by Ury (?) in 1951 <I may have that reference wrong; if anyone *really*
cares, I can dig up the reference>.  While there are tides in the
atmosphere, they are not a big actor.  Consider it this way: if tidal
effects were significant in skimming the atmosphere, then why, after
4 billion years of geologic time, has the earth retained most of its
atmosphere (we know it has, based on the evidence of the stratigraphic
record)?  The loss of a little hydrogen, helium, and neon has more
to do with the weight fractionation of the entire atmosphere than
it has ever had to do with the gravitational pull of the moon.

No, sorry.  But don\'t take my word for it.  Here for your perusal
is a pertinent passage from Fuare\'s emminently readable volume
on geochemistry:

     "The atmosphere of Venus is composed primarily of CO2 with
smaller concentrations of N2, H2O, and trace amounts of O2, Ar,
Ne, and SO2 (Oyama et al., 1979).  The atmosphere contains three
layers of clouds between 68 and 31 km above the surface.  The
clouds consist of droplets of concentrated suluric acids having
diameters of about 1um.  The temperature of the atmosphere increases
downward from -50 C at the top of the cloud layer to between 420
and 485 C at the surface.  The atmospheric pressure is 90 bars,
equivalent to the pressure at a depth of 1000 m in the oceans of
the Earth (Glass, 1982).  The high temperature and pressure of the
surface of Venus result from the abundance of CO2 (96.4%) and
H20 (0.14%) in the atmosphere, both of which absorb infrared
radiation and cuase an extreme case of the \'greenhouse effect\'."
    "The low abundance of water vapor in the atmosphere of Venus
is still unexplained.  Venus should originally have contained as
much water as the Earth, most of which should now reside in the
atmosphere because of the high surface temperature.  The low
abundance of atmospheric water vapor reported by the Pioneer Venus
spacecraft may be explained by postulating that water molecules
were dissociated by ultraviolet radiation into H2 and O2.  The H2
can escape into interplanetary space, but the O2 should have
accumulated in the atmosphere of Venus.  However, the observed
concentration of atmospheric O2 is much lower than expected if it in
fact originated by the decomposition of water...The O2 may have been
removed from the atmosphere by the formation of oxides, which should
form a layer several kilometers in thickness.  There is no evidence,
however, for the existence of such a layer on Venus.  The low
abundance of water and oxygen in the atmosphere of Venus therefore
remain a mystery."
     "The abundance of CO2 and N2 in the atmosphere of Venus are
compatible with their terrestrial abundances.  Most of the CO2 has
been removed from the atmosphere of the Earth by the formation of
calcium carbonate in the oceans.  If all the CO2 in terrestrial
carbonate rocks were returned to the atmosphere, its mass would
increase about 70 times and the CO2/N2 ratio would be about the
same as that in the atmosphere of Venus.  Therefore, the absense
of oceans on the surface of Venus has caused CO2 to remain in its
atmosphere and has resulted in the high surface temperatures."
                                               pp. 145-146

Basically, Venus and Earth are twin planets compositionally, with
the one exception of the lack of water vapor on Venus.  The higher
atmospheric pressure at the surface of Venus is due to the fact that
all the CO2 is in the atmosphere, increasing the partial pressure of
CO2, as well as making the optical depth of Venus\'s atmosphere much
greater than Earth\'s.  The density of Venus\'s atmosphere is due to
more to surface chemistry (ie gaseous CO2) than to physics (ie, to
weight fractionation or to gravitation skimming by other
planetary bodies).

This isn\'t to say that the atmosphere of the Earth has been all
that stable over geologic time.  The stratigraphic record contains
significant facies which could only have formed in a REDUCING
atmosphere, ie one with little free oxygen.  How the atmosphere
shifted to an oxidizing environment in the precambrian is hotly
debated in paleoclimate circles.

The collision theory is one of four contested theories for the formation
of the moon.  It is a better theory, actually, than the other three,
but its appeal has less to do with explaining crustal abundances, but
rather, it explains the siderphillic, H2O, and voltile element depletion
of the moon itself.  This is a very involved subject (ie, the formation
of the moon), so I will stop here.  (S. R. Taylor\'s article in Geochimica
Cosmochimica Acta (1987) is a excellent spot for the compulsively
interested to continue reading on this subject.)

Gold, silver, platinum, copper, and iron are considered to be depleted
in the crust of the Earth with respect to cosmic abundances.  The
reason we see these siderphillic elements at all is because the initial
differentiation of the Earth during its formation was an imperfect
process.  The accretion of the Earth\'s core didn\'t manage to suck up
all of the siderophillic metals, which for us is most fortunate!  :-)

That\'s all for now, folks.  (We now return to our regularly scheduled
program of traveller weapons, psi shields, PBEM news, and the evils
of TNE   ;-)

The recent discussion of "shares" for discoveries by a ship brought to mind a likely solution. There was a formula used for distributing shares of prize money in the late 18th and early 19th century. I only have partial details, but it *does* seem to be the sort of thing that would get revived (these things tend to quickly optimize between fairness and simplicity, so why re-invent the wheel?)

Beside, a formula that was used by both the British Navy and some notable privateers seems to be appropriate somehow. :-)

I\'ll agree with you on the fact that it is energy that kills, but kinetic
energy is calculated by 1/2Mass*Velocity^2.  Therefore, I believe that
the greater velocity of the smaller rounds more than makes up for their
lesser mass.  I also agree that the heavier rounds often have greater
maximum ranges, but maximum effective range is what concerns me.  A
5.56mm bullet fired from a M-16A2 has a maximum effective range of
540 meters, if I recall correctly.  It is somewhere around 800 meters
when firing at a grouped target, on burst setting.  Those ranges are,
in my experience, pretty long as firefights go.  I\'m not talking
snipers here either, as they tend to use larger rounds that also happen
to have high muzzle velocity.  Marine snipers use the Remington 700,
which is a 30-06, I believe.  (They also engage targets at 1000 meters!)

This helps prove my point.  Note that the ACR is firing DS (Discarding
Sabot) ammunition.  Discarding Sabot is a round that after it leaves
the muzzle of the weapon, drops a jacket which surrounds a _smaller_
diameter penetrator which then has a greater velocity.  Therefore, the
round has a greater penetration (higher kinetic energy).  However,
the remainder of your argument is irrefutable.  An ACR firing ball
ammunition is far better than an empty Gauss rifle.  I am a great
believer in peace through superior firepower! :-)

Some comments:
- -the ranking scheme is kind of silly, one could be a "doctor"
by rank, without having the necessary prerequisites, IMO, to be a
functional physician.  I would dump promotion role, and 
instead propose titles based upon skills.

- -the skills I thought of parallel the TNE\'s, which makes sense,
the skills needed to function as a medical provider are pretty easily
divided to a point.

The Skills:
- -Medicine: the ability to take a history, perform a physical, make
 a diagnosis, and prescribe therapy
- -Surgery: The technical skills needed to perform surgical procedures
- -Resuscitation: The skills needed to recognize and restore dysfunctions
 in airway, breathing, circulation, and cerebral function
- -Pharmacology: drugs and toxicology

These are the skills that I feel are unique to health care, but are
generalizable enough to be specific skills.

- -Specialization: a skill designated by the player to reflect a 
 health care speciality.  It\'s up to the player and the ref to 
 determine the situations were the skill would act as a DM.
 As an example a specialization of "infectious disease" might
 allow the character to identify the plague that blights the
 planet he is on.

"resuscitation" is a more descriptive title then "trauma ops",
as medical emergencies (e.g. CPR) require the same initial resuscitation
skills as traumatic injuries.  It also gives a place for lay folk to place
their skill points, a resuscitation-1 would kind of be the equivalent
of an EMT-intermediate.  Some one who could give first aid, start IVs,
and do other limited life saving things.

Actually, I would think that all military (including scouts) would
have a resuscitation-0 to represent "buddy aid" skills.

Some job titles based on skills:
paramedic: medicine-1, resuscitation-2
nurse: medicine-1, pharmacology-1,resucitation-1,specialization
 (nursing care)-1
intern: medicine-3 and surgery-1 (medical \'tern) _or_
        medicine-2 and surgery-2 (surgery \'tern) plus
        resuscitation-1,pharmacology-1,biology-1,chemistry-1,genetics-1
internist: as for medical intern, except medicine-4 plus specialization-2
      (e.g. cardiology), pharmacology-2    
general surgeon: as for intern, except medicine-3, surgery-4

for playability sake I don\'t know how complex you would want to make 
this skill cascade.  I think this presents a reasonable balance.
It will also be interesting to see how GDW will handle wound healing
and illness, given that they\'ve gone to the trouble of creating this
cascade.  Space borne diseases perhaps?

Finally, for those hung up on giving people ranks, this is roughly
how things work today.

    Doctors       Nurses                Prehospital Care
E-1 premed        nursing student       Emergency Medical Tech-Basic
E-4 pond scum     Licensed Practical    EMT-Intermediate
E-7                                     Paramedic
O-1 med student   Registered Nurse      EMS Lieutenant
O-2               Staff Nurse            
O-3 Intern        Charge Nurse          EMS Captain
O-4 Resident      Head Nurse/Nurse Specialist
O-5 Staff         
O-6 Chief         Director of Nursing Services

that\'s a rough approximation.  Chief is the head of particular service,
like "Chief of the Internal Medicine Service".  Above that position is
Director of Medical Services.

Hrm, yes.  I\'ve always had more trouble dealing with that when generating
*robots*, though...I have a robot design in my briefcase right now that
technically requires 130 more units of Storage (with nothing in them) or else
it just won\'t work....

One of the questions I\'ve always had about that rule: If you finish character
generation and you\'re over the limit, what do you do? Cross out skill levels
until you\'re legal, I assume, but do you do it at random, does the player
pick, or do you just stop adding skills when you reach the limit? It really
ought to say somewhere.

it was fixed in that draft already then I apologize deeply and
heart-feltedly)

Tempest Class Attack Cruiser TL 15

     "Conceived and designed as a multi-purpose patrol vessel for use along
the Imperial frontier, the Tempest class of Attack Cruisers is almost always
employed on independent missions. Though capable of holding its own in combat
against most ships of near-equal size, the Attack Cruiser is considered to be
of greater value when used away from large battle fleets. It has proven to be
ideal for missions where one or two ships are to "show the flag" to various
states beyond the Imperial border, or for routine patrol work.  The Attack
Cruiser can generally outrun anything that it cannot fight (though this is not
always the case), thus making it a perfect vessel for the kind of patrol work
demanded along the edge of the Imperium.
     "Attack Cruisers are often employed as flagships for small squadrons
(those consisting by and large of fairly small starships); passenger space has
been designed into the vessel to accomodate a small squadron staff over and
above usual complement. Four fighter squadrons are carried on board as well,
for various scouting and combat support duties.  Remaining weaponry is
well-balanced, making the ship a good all-around fighting craft.  Versatility,
however, has forced the ship to forgo any really outstanding single feature."

Let me give my take on the matter (which carries as much or as little
authority as you care to give it, of course). In the Beginning, I was
able to keep my players from creating ridiculously powerful characters
because (a) Traveller didn\'t encourage that sort of thing, having a
somewhat more highbrow focus than most other RPGs (b) I imposed some
term limits to keep them from getting out of hand (c) there was an
unreasonably large fear of aging rolls, because before the "aging crisis"
was introduced, low stats = death. However, as years went by and I began
attending Traveller events elsewhere (like cons), I began seeing what
munchkins could do with the rules when they sunk their grubby little
paws into them, and I loudly applauded the limits when they were added.

(There are people, like Hans, who argue that they\'re artificial and 
unrealistic; true, but I don\'t mind sacrificing a little realism for
the sake of keeping munchkins muzzled. Also, I think Hans\'s definition
and mine of a "minimally useful skill" are very different. However, I think 
Hans\'s way around the limit is an interesting one, and one possibly
worth having in TNE, so I hereby ask him to write it up for the TML
so the GDW folx can see it.)

I use the limits as follows: philosophically, the idea is that over
one\'s life, one actually learns to do many, MANY things competently
well. I am a 3-term Scientist, and if you take the rules literally 
I already have far too many skills to be considered a legal Traveller
character. The same goes for many other people here, I\'m sure. The
way I deal with this is that there is a difference between being able 
to do something AT ALL, or competently, and being able to do it WELL
ENOUGH TO GET A TASK MODIFIER. In other words, the gulf between 
knowledge and expertise is a measureable one, and most normal people
(I have always had trouble with the idea that interesting characters
must be supergeniuses) have a specific skill set in which they are
outstanding, and many skills in which they are merely competent.

In rules terms, this is treated as follows: the Ref applies huge
minuses and greatly increases failure and mishap chances for someone
attempting a task with NO relevant skill training; however, the
acquisition of a level-0 in that skill removes the minuses and allows
only the usual chances for mishaps. (I also advocate the removal of a
stat-based default modifier for many skills, if not all of them: a guy
with no skill is not going to be able to run a Jump Drive, no matter
how smart he is.) So it behooves the character to have a few skills at
a high level, so as to be a strong asset in appropriate situations,
and many level-0 skills, to represent the many situations in life
where one learned something a long time ago but could call up some
basic techniques in a pinch. As a character ages, some skills get
rusty while others take their place. The way to reflect this in the
generation of the character is to allow the player to create the
character from start to finish and completely ignore the limits,
racking up skill points as quickly as possible. Then, at the end,
after mustering out benefits are completed and the character\'s Int
and Edu are stable, the PLAYER is allowed to decide which skills
to scale back to a lower level to come in under the limit. He 
or she should do this in consultation with the Referee, who should
oversee the process and make suggestions to the novice as to which
skills are best at higher levels and which are sufficient at a zero.

I have never had any complaints from any of my players about how this
process produces characters, unless you include the occasional pimply
teenager at a GenCon who reads over the pregenerated stats for an
event I\'m running and whines, "This guy is a WIMP! MY character has
level-6 skills in EVERYTHING and he\'s Level-13 Psionic and he has
Battle Dress and a Fusion Gun on each hip and flies his own Kinunir
that\'s been modified so he can fly it himself and...." <sigh>

I\'d be happy to, but is that limit kept in TNE at all? Anyway,
quite apart from thinking that an average maximum on skill levels
of 14 is too low, I also think it strange that someone with an
UPP of CCC227 can at most get 4 levels of _combat_ skills. So I
use two types of experience, Physical experience = Str+Dex and
Mental experience = Int+Edu and allow characters to count
physical skills against their PhyEx and mental skills against
their MenEx. Then I place some skills (like _mechanical_) in a
third category (In Between) and allow a character to count
these against either experience total as they want.

It seems that Arrival Vengeance is not free of mistakes.  The
Rampart fighter listed was copied from The Rebellion Sourcebook,
which copied the design from the Imperial Encyclopedia which is
FULL of errors.  The Iramda fighter is RIDICULOUS.  The listed
loaded weight is about two thirds of the weight of the fighters
hull alone.  I don\'t know HOW they managed to put so many mistakes
into one design, and I don\'t care.  But, here is a corrected
version.  It uses GDW\'s formula for agility (which Rob Dean and I
disagree with strongly) So it is a fully legal design.  I crammed
as much engines as I could inside and still get Agility=6 with the
cargo requirements.  (sigh)

The original Rampart-128 fighter from High Guard was 15 tons, not
10.  The Rampart-128/2 had a missile rack instead of a laser.  But

Well, my sister was a nurse in the Air Force, and when she graduated
nursing school, she joined the AF (perhaps they were paying for her
schooling, not sure) and was commisioned a lieutenant.  She retired as
a major, so calling nurses \'enlisted\' and doctors \'officers\' is not
accurate to _this_ time period.

I agree that nursing should be its own career path.  Perhaps give a both
a +dm to switch careers to the other?  A nurse might want to advance to
doctor and if someone washes out of med school, but is set on a medical
career, nursing school is an alternative.

In my path, the first 4 grades (e1-e4) would be pre-med in civilian life
and enlisted personnel in the military.  If you recieve a promotion from
enlisted to officer, you would have to state which altenate path to
follow henceforeword (either nurse or doctor).

My reasons for having both paths start the same is I assume that both
nurses and doctors recieve _some_ of the same training (possibly wrong).
I\'m pretty sure that RN is higher that LPN, but since I am not a nurse,
I\'ll accept being corrected by someone who knows better.

Maybe I\'m off-track with respect to your arguement here, but you *seem*
to be saying that "What\'s in the crust was already in the crust" If I\'m
wrong then tell me I\'m an idiot and I can\'t read your arguement properly.
Crustal abundances of minerals are mainly due to hydrothermal processes.
The evolution of hot water from diagenesis[sediment compaction] or
volcanic bodies (from contact with groundwater or the evolution of 
their own supercritical fluids) dissolves large amounts of low 
concentrations of metals. The passage of these fluids through preferred
pathways (usually fractures or weak points in the rocks) leads to 
deposition from fluid reaction with the surrounding rocks (altering pH
and solubility) or temperature reduction as the fluid migrates away from
the hot body. Also, another method of forming minerals in the crust 
is relatively "dry". Involving the separation of immiscible sulphides as
a mafic magma cools. So, pretty much, as long as there is volcanic activity,
there will be minerals to mine. However, with the exception of massive 
layered intrusions such as the Bushvelt complex in South Africa, most of
the mineralization likely to ON THE EARTH is likely to be due to the 
properties of water.

Can anybody give me some information on Traveller State-of-the-Medical-Art?

What technology is common, uncommon, perfected, experimental?  For example,
Bishop was injected with nanocytes after his death, in an attempt to 
rebuild the structure of his nervous system.  What things are nanocytes
capable of in traveller?  What other tools are available?

> where\'s the best ski destination in the imperium?

There are about 32 worlds with really decent skiing in the Imperium
(Terra being one of them, but only marginally so due to heavy tourist
overuse).  But if you\'re a maniac, cliff-jumping, totally incurable
powderhound, there are only four worlds worth considering:

  Ishala     [2113/Vland]
  Mereasis   [2332/Hinterworlds]
  Montero    [1010/Old Expanses]
  Radd Caulo [2223/Core]

The resorts on Radd Caulo are exclusive, but are still over-used due
to their proximity to Capital.  My first choice would be Montero.
It\'s far-enough off the beaten track, has an excellent starport, a
reasonably high TL, a stable government, a small population, and
a comfortable law level.  Give me half a dozen skiing friends, a
well-stocked grav vehicle and a good map of the Cathedral Mt. range,
and you wouldn\'t see me for a month or more. :^)

BTW, Caledon [1815/Caledon/Reaver\'s Deep] is another good place to
ski, and is only one sub-sector away from Tuvir. :^)

> did you have a nice time skiing?

It was very nice.  The bad weather on Friday night kept a lot of
folks in Denver, so Saturday wasn\'t very crowded.  The only downer
was having to quit early due to a hardware failure (my right knee
gave out). :^(  Other than that, it was loverly.

> where exactly is Tuvir?  Sub-sector ?  Hex ?

Here are the relevant details:
  Tuvir [1410/Riftdeep subsector/Reaver\'s Deep sector]
    UWP: D778588-6
  System details:
    3 gas giants, no asteroid belts.
  Planetary details:
    Starport class D, Poor quality installation
            Only unrefined fuel available. No repair facilities present.
            [NOTE: This applies only the the general starport, not to
            the Turnskaad compound, which is a private Class-A facility.]
    Medium sized world. Surface gravity of .875 G
    World diameter is 7000 miles (11200 km).
    Standard, tainted atmosphere. Filter mask needed.
    80 percent water. Cloud cover is 60 percent
    Approximately 700,000 inhabitants.
    Civil Service Bureaucracy. Government by agencies employing individuals
            selected for their expertise.
    Law Level 8: Long bladed weapons (all but daggers) are controlled,
            and open possesion is prohibited.
    Tech Level 6: circa 1940 to 1969
    Trade Classifications: Agricultural. Non-Industrial.

The star system is non-aligned (i.e. no specific allegiances), although
the local government is on good terms with both the Federation of Daibei
and the Aslan Hierate.

This ought to answer most of your questions.

 I originally developed this for "traveller done right".  It\'s a
 reasonable foundation for a discussion of how medicine will evolve
 along the established Traveller TL lines.  It certainly doesn\'t

 it is the most reasoned application of what we know and what

 Note that many items occur earlier in my time line than in MT or
 traveller.  This is due largely to their predecesors appearing at our current
 tech level e.g. primitive artificial vision is occurring _now_, we have
 artificial (albeit extremely large) artificial organs, and have experimental 
 gene therapy.  Real good binocular vision is happening now (only it takes 
 a mini-computer to run it), either we\'re in TL 9 and TL 10 will make it 
 portable, or...well, anyway things are changing quicker than they have 
 any right to.

    'body' => 'Well, my pre Xmas trip to Austin lasted longer than expected, and was
followed by an even-less-expected stay in Stockholm, which lasted me till
Xmas. I\'ve finally caught up with the stuff coming from TML, but I won\'t
even try to comment on the stuff in the intervening period, apart from ...

To GDW:
The GDW character generation stuff: like Hans I would like some examples of
the actual tables, but the stuff here is a lot better than I had feared, so
that it would seem the overhaul is less extensive than I had come to expect.
Some comments:
- - I would prefer to see DET generated as a separate attribute (rather than
derived as in MT, and rather than a skill as it is here) if its use is to be
similar to that in MT. I don\'t see the rules here for gaining skills through
experience, rather than by character generation/pro-rating, and you need
something to modify the chances/time for increasing skills through training
("I spent the week in jump practicing my Aslan grammar" is the kind of
out-of-character opportunism you occasionally come across). In the past,
given the generally poor systems put forward for skills development in
Traveller, I\'ve used a combination of a det attribute, the instruction
skill, and a throw against the current skill level similar to that in
Runequest (so that it becomes more difficult to advance as you move along
the percentage scale/bell curve), but this is on no way official.
- - minor point which annoys me is the bureaucrat\'s watch. You don\'t get many
bureaucrat players, and an NPC hardly needs a watch. In the real world, top
level civil servants who retire get seats on company boards (in France they
have a word for it which I believe is pantouflage) and in the commercial
sector they, er, get the same. Basically it adds up to a large amount of
money and also influence, and you probably need to cut the bureaucrats into
the share scheme, and also add an influence skill. In the UK, by the way,
the civil service is at the core of the honours system, and top civil
servants can (and do) expect knighthoods and occasionally seats in the House
of Lords, so free leaps in Social Status may also be worth offering.
- - I liked Richard Johnson\'s suggestions on Social Status determining career.
Maybe in the TNE period SS is more of an anachronism, but the traditional
Traveller rules had far too little on the influence of SS, and the
aristocratic social structure which underlay it, on Imperial society. I\'d
also like to see some starting funds based on SS. The combination of this
and restriction of opportunity would better reflect the milieu. It would
start the players in an unequal position (but this should balance out with
str, int etc anyhow) but this sort of game is anyway not a race, and in the
past I\'ve found that imbalances of advantage/disadvantage between players
actually encourage character development and interaction. On a rereading I
see you actually intend to cover at least the money side and also modify for
world technology. This is good but I think you should also look at Richard\'s
proposal.
- - Given the increased degree of diversity between worlds in the TNE era,
there should probably be some note against the rank/title lists indicating
that this is the old imperial naming system and local namings should vary.
By the way, I\'m not sure that giving all the careers rank systems is
productive - top scientists aren\'t always head of department, for example,
even at the end of their careers. At the risk of complicating the process, I
think you should consider multiple reward systems, eg power/influence, fame,
money, high skill levels, rather than driving everything via the rank
system. For example, when a character makes his/her promotion roll, give
them the choice of having an extra 2 skills instead.
- - attributes only allowed to increase a maximum of once each during
generation ... but what about, eg cybernetics. And I think once each is too
small ... I know people who have changed more than that over a long period.
Please, change this to once every 2 terms, or introduce a disincentive (1
attribute for 2 skills, say). Also if possible introduce a very small chance
of a really weird leap to produce the occasional one-off character.
- - also, I\'ll second the plea for increasing the granularity of the skill
ranges. I don\'t mind d20 systems ... I regard them as more usable than d100,
and in the past I\'ve used them to simplify, for example, the Chaosium
systems for novice gamers who found percentile throws too finnicky. I\'ve
seen them work very well, for example Chivalry & Sorcery used to have a very
good d20 based combat system (as an optional alternative to d100. C&S would
have had d1000 if it had thought it could get away with it). Moving from
skills ranged to 15 to a 13 range for a 20 based throw (as I understand it)
seems a trifle weird - does it mean a lot of crit hit/miss tables at the
back of the books? If so, try GMing a SpaceMaster campaign, then think
again.
- - I don\'t see anything about the pre-career education system provided in the
advanced careers systems of late classic traveller, and/or MT. If you do do
this, please allow academic skills to be actually obtained at college
(alternatively I guess carousing or such could be made available). Also
think twice before just inserting a carbon copy of the US education system
(high school, college, graduate school, etc) - I\'m not sure it could sustain
several millenia of close examination (;-))
- - A number of skills seem to be missing from what one might need to turn the
scientist career into a viable one. The advanced scientist character
generation rules in Challenge 29 (which don\'t by the way work unless the
character makes it to grad school, where they are allowed to discover what
they studied at college) includes a number of extra skills:
   cryonics
   meteorology
   sophontology
   botany
   ecology
   psionics (study rather than practice)
   archeology (important in the Traveller milieu)
   linguistics (again study rather than extra languages)
   psychology
   sociology
   theology
   psychohistory (Isaac Asimov RIP)
Also some of the other social studies - law, politics, economics etc are
missing. You can pick and choose from the ones above but the list you have
needs bulking out.
- - other stuff on skills - conventional arts, eg writing, painting are
missing. Again, difficult to get in everything, but a general artisan skill
may be worth considering. And also I don\'t see linguistics (this time
language learning rather than the science) ... I mention
this skills stuff because I once sat down and generated some advanced char
generation rules for scientists and for artisans. In addition to the
discovery (as opposed to promotion) roll for scientists as in Challenge 29, I
had a book roll, so that even if they didn\'t discover anything interesting,
they might have produced an interesting text. The artists had a "notable
work" roll (oh and the other difference from the C29 scientists was a lot
less moving around between assignments). These generated some very
interesting and useful NPCs, probably the most interesting I\'ve had, and
sitting down and thinking about the way, for example, different artforms
were popular, and different artists gained renown, in different parts of the
Imperium, really added alot of flavour, not just for the players but also
for me as a GM. I\'m looking forward to the zero-G stonemasons, by the way.
- - will the alien skills, eg storytelling and manipulation for the hivers,
not be available in the initial PC book? And is a later expanded char
generation system, analagous to the old advanced systems, also planned?
Oh, and by the way, thanks for asking our opinion. I for one very much
appreciate it.


That\'s all on that for now. On a totally unrelated note, I picked up the
latest issue (12, I think) of the Runequest "tales of the reaching moon"
fanzine. It contains an interview with Runequest contributor (and the
designer of Call of Cthulu) Sandy Petersen, and there is an interesting
discussion on the effect of Avalon Hill and Chaosium\'s attempts to expand
beyond the original Gloranthan setting to a generic system. It\'s relevant to
Traveller because the games have developed in similar ways - originally
popular, strong setting, subsequent split of designer and distributor
(Chaosium kept the design responsibility and AH became the publisher), new
version rejected by the hard core of fans, who still favour the old system,
lack of new material for the older background, old material becomes much
sought after, game develops reputation for "steep learning curve", etc, etc.
Avalon Hill, under new management, and Chaosium, are now repackaging and
expanding the Gloranthan material in an attempt to win back their core
audience. The current view on the older material seems to be to repackage
the background stuff, but not to rerelease the scenarios, which the older
audience will have played anyhow. Recommended reading for the GDW people.

Finally, can I ask the person who submitted the very long non Traveller PBEM
description please to desist. I know that I am in a minority in that I
actually pay for my traffic, but if we do go off on a tangent I would prefer
it to be brief. Sorry if this is not the majority view, but it is mine
(maybe a ruling, James?)

All the best, and a happy new year

  I believe that the MT rules say that it is at the player\'s 
  discretions, subject to the constraint that if a character has 
  skill-2 or more, reductions for the purpose of getting under the 
  limit should not reduce the skill level below 2 unless absolutely 
  necessary.  I usually relaxed this, such that the character cannot 
  forget a skill entirely unless it is necessary to get below the 
  limit (I usually did not have to invoke either the original rule or 
  my relaxation.  My players usually handled the situation sensibly.).

Skarloey Class Narrow Gauge Steam Locomotive TL4

     Two locomotives of the Skarloey class (Skarloey and Rheneas) were built 
for a small 0.7 meter gauge railroad on the backward planet of Sodor. This 
railroad was built primarily to haul rock from a quarry in a hilly region to 
a larger railroad running along the coast, where it would be transferred and 
hauled to a port by the larger railroad.  Since the proposed route passed 
close to several villages, the railroad built five coaches of the Agnes class 
to transport workers to the quarry, and generate some additional revenue by 
providing passenger service to the villagers.
     The high ground pressure of the narrow iron wheels restricts the locomo-
tive and their cars to operating along a route of prepared iron rails. P/W 
and resulting speed must be recalculated for each train, but as an example, 
the locomotive below can pull 5 fully loaded freight cars at a speed of 
28kph, or a passenger train consisting of all five Agnes class coaches at a 
speed of 45kph.
     This class of locomotive can be considered to typical for small steam 
locomotives operating over routes of limited length at this tech level.

Skarloey Railroad Freight Car TL4

     Given below is a freight car of the Skarloey Railroad on the planet of 
Sodor. The Traveller vehicle design system is not sensitive enough to distin-
guish between box cars, tank cars, stock cars, gondola, hoppers and flat 
cars, but the Skarloey Railroad operates about 30 open hopper cars used for 
hauling stone.  The same statistics could be used for other car styles.

Agnes Class Passenger Coach TL6

     Five Agnes class coaches were built to serve the Skarloey Railroad on 
the planet of Sodor.  Since the line is short, and no alternative passenger 
services are available, passenger comfort was not considered to be a primary 
design goal.  Passengers enter and exit the car through two doors on either 
side, and the seating is arranged as four benches in two facing pairs.  Cargo 
space consists of the spaces under the benches.

Defiant Class Interface Fighter TL13

     The Defiant is produced under license in the Spinward Marches by several 
manufacturers on Lunion and Strouden.  In addition, a number were built 
during the Fifth Frontier War by Collace. The Defiant is intended as an 
orbital fighter, but can be used fairly successfully as an atmospheric fight-
er in addition.  It carries a crew of two, a pilot and a gunner to man the 
turret, which mounts a beam laser, a missile rack, and a sandcaster.

Collace Brightside Class Privateer TL13

     Three vessels of the Brightside class were constructed as a private 
venture on Collace prior to the outbreak of the Fifth Frontier War.  At the 
outbreak of the War, the Collace government nationalized the ships, which 
were then operated by their originally trained crews under the navy flag.  
The ships (renamed Ranger, Enterprise and Fortunate by the navy) were operat-
ed as commerce raiders in the Glisten sector.  Ranger was captured while 
docked at Glisten, Enterprise destroyed at Overnale, and the final of Fortu-
nate is unknown.  It is suspected that it was destroyed in a jump accident 
after being damaged in an engagement with local defense forces at New Rome.

Hmmm... Computing jump coordinates is Routine, unless I misremember.
Adding 1 for navigation and 1 for intelligence (if average) means he
makes a mistake in one jump out of six. If his intelligence is a bit
higher he only makes a mistake once in twelve.

Of course a lot of mistakes are just minor ones, but even so you\'re
not getting me to fly with him.

Even with skill-3 you fail Routine tasks once in 36, which is a lot
more than I\'d expect for something that is routine, but...

  {
    'body' => '  As the key handwaver in Bishop\'s resuscitation (along with Nick and Mark)
I can safely say that everything I did was fairly available now with
the exception of two things:

1) the nanocytes used in the repair of his brain (and the subsequent
   reprogramming done on them by IASIC).
2) the programming device that created a binding macromolecule to soak
   up the benzodiazepine given to Bishop while he was seizing

  Of course, this doesn\'t include slamming him into the medical 
lowberth, which I suppose I could talk about first.

  I don\'t like the idea of freezing people, never have, never will.
The idea that a chemical will be developed that will eliminate ice crystal
damage is far less likely than the process described in Bishop\'s
"resurrection".  Further, it isn\'t necessary to freeze tissue to
preserve it.  How I envision a med lowberth is cold enough to stop
enzymatic processes, reduce tissue demand for oxygen, and with
chemical and mechanical support maintain the body in an arrested 
state (or slow it down to allow repair to continue).  
  Chemically antioxidants and free radical binders are used
to prevent tissue degradation.  Anitbiotics/antifungals are needed
to prevent overrun of tissue by foriegn organisms.  As the lungs are
not used during the lowberth stay, surfactants are needed to wash out
the lungs upon awakening.
  Mechanically, the patient is on bypass to provide oxygen to the
metabolic processes that are still underway, and to prevent blood
sludging and acidosis.  By maintaining vasculature, a route is
established for nanocytes to reach repair sites.  A russian sleep 
set is used to induce a state of delta sleep. 

  Nanocytes are something of a combined organic/mechanical nature
available in my timeline at about TL 12.  Initially only capable
of limited actions of simple tissue repair (e.g. microtrauma),
they become increasingly more programmable to the point where
they can effect limited memory reconstruction by identifying
remaining neuroanatomy, remnants of damaged cells, and 
concentrations of neurotransmitters and their byproducts.

  The programmable toxin binder functions as a small organic
chemistry lab.  Given a particular molecular structure, a semi-
synthetic binder is produced that will bind to that structure.
While in many cases, the structures are stored in mass memory,
some rarely used drugs need to be programmed, and in any case
some production time is needed.

If you think the ship descriptions were mangled in Arrival Veangance,
check out where Usdiki moved to (from Subsector L of Gushmege to
Subsector E, if I read it right; all the way across the sector).

There was a Hi Pop, Navy Base, hi-tech world under where they
moved Usdiki to which would have done fine.  There was no need

	The Lurker emerges again...

		I\'ve got a question to those who have played anything dealing
	with Imperial Research Stations.  I\'ve been a bit puzzled as to 
	what their individual purposes are and the designations.  So far,
	in the Imperial Encyclopedia, we have seven different types of 
	research stations:

		RsA	-	Research Station Alpha
		RsB -	Research Station Beta
		RsG -	Research Station Gamma
		RsD -	Research Station Delta
		RsE -	Research Station Epsilon
		RsZ -	Research Station Zeta
		RsH -	Research Station Eta

		In the module, Assignment: Vigilante, we have a Research Station
	Gamma in the Sittahr system (3129/Promise/Diaspora) which has been
	charged with the observation of an anomalous Gas Giant which is 
	exhibiting some of the properties of a T Tauri protostar (At least
	that\'s how I\'ve been reading it.).
		Now, does this mean the designation of RsG is an astronomical 
	laboratory? Yet, in the Imperial Encyclopedia, we have the following
	Library Data entry:

	"Imperial research stations may be located on worlds which need a 
	 boost to the local economy or in remote systems far from the 
	 potential disturbance of Imperial politics.  Many different stations 
	 may be located in several systems of the same region, and many 
	 different areas of knowledgemay be under investigation.

	 In general, however, one station is constructed fro one purpose, 
	 and it continues in a single area of knowledge for its entire span
	 of usefulness.  Its size, personnel roster, power plant capacity,
	 and even visibility profile are dependent on its area of 
	 investigation.

	 Imperial backed research may delve into many areas.  Some examples
	 include black hole research (both large-scale and mini-black hole
	 investigation), instantaneous transmitter development (so far 
	 proving impossible), antimatter containment, new weapon development
	 (such as disintegrator beams), black globe development, deep planetary
	 scanning, psychohistory, mass population behavior prediction, genetic
	 transformation of living organisms, self-aware robots and starships,
	 stasis and time travel, personal shields, memory transfer, and total
	 rejuvenation."

	Well, that\'s all very well, but I still have no idea what the 
	designations mean.  Any words of wisdom?  Screams from the masses?
	Whispers from the wind? 

		Also...

		Does anybody have any comment about Laser Weapon Powerpack volumes?
	I asked about that around two weeks ago and the air was silent...
	Maybe it was a topic already covered in the past, if so could someone
	let me know, I have been reading the bundles (God, there\'s a lot of 
	stuff in those bundles!!).

	I posted asking about medicine in the imperium, and got some
interesting responses.  Now I\'m curious about the rebellion. In the
past I\'ve played pre-rebellion campaigns or played apolitical
characters.  I\'m currently playing a character who retired from the
Interstellar Diplomatic Service, so I suppose he should have a clearer
idea of where his loyalties lay.  What\'s this whole rebellion about?

	I vaguely recall a few details, mostly mentioned in play or from
occasionally reading TASJ news;  Strephon was assassinated, but later
turned up claiming that the slain Strephon was a double/clone/robot.
Admiral/Archduke Norris is contesting Strephon\'s claim to the throne
(there was some mention of the second Strephon being a clone).  People
are siding with one or the other - whatever happened to the guy who
assassinated Strephon?  I thought that was part of some sort of bid
for the throne.

	Moving on (or back) to medicine:

	I have a fair idea of what the nanocytes were doing;  how
widespread is their use in the imperium, and how effective are they? 

	I missed the macromolecule programmable toxin binder.  Is its
use limited to soaking up poison, or is it more flexible?  How 
bulky/portable is it?  Are there any devices using similar technology
for other ends?

I assume you are referring to Archive-Message-Number 5073 by Quincey
Kozial. I appreciate you stating your opinion (indeed, thanks for all
your ideas and comments on the TML!). However, I feel compelled to
defend Quincy\'s posting as a reasonable interpretation of the TML
guidelines. The official ruling as it stands is in the TML Orientation
message everyone gets when they sign up for the TML:

  DESCRIPTION OF THE LIST

  This list exists to discuss Game Designer\'s Workshop\'s TRAVELLER Science
  Fiction Role Playing System (what a mouthful), including all derivative
  games and rulesets (Traveller 2300, MegaTraveller, Striker, Azhanti High
  Lightning, etc).  Discussion is intended to be unlimited and to people
  with a broad base of familiarity with Traveller.  Subscribers can
  exchange programs, news bulletins, new "rules", war stories, questions
  at any level of expertise, answers, etc; or just listen.

  Also there are a number of you out there (you know who you are), who are
  interested primarily in other gaming systems, but want to transfer
  concepts embodied in Traveller to other systems.  Discussion about other
  SFRP games is encouraged, but personally I wouldn\'t want them to greatly
  overwhelm the Traveller discussion.  If a need appears for a
  general-purpose SFRP list, I will avidly support anyone else\'s trying to
  organize it.

In my opinion, tangential discussion is okay, as long as it doesn\'t
overwhelm the Traveller discussion. As long as non-Traveller traffic is
less than 30% or so of the list\'s volume over a month\'s time or so, I
will choose NOT to restrict this discussion.

I realize this is probably less strict than you would wish, Mark, but
trust me when I say that large non-Traveller postings of the sort Quincy
posted are few and far between. The largest "bandwidth wasters" that
most people complain about to me as admin are:

	1) "not-my-favorite-game" discussions (ex: player of 2300AD
	   decries seeing MegaTraveller-specific posts)
	2) general science discussion (like planetary geology, physics
	   discussions)
	3) large postings (that\'s why all the short postings less than
	   6K in size appear first in the digest)
	4) ship designs (that\'s why I sort them down to the very end of
	   each digest)

Another big complaint is that I don\'t truncate the
I-Have-Recieved-Your-Posting-And-Will-Deliver-It message that the
digester sends back to TML posters -- this results in higher bills for
those that pay for email by the byte. I\'m sensitive to this issue, but
it is inconvenient for me to work on it at this time -- it *is* at the
top of my "future file" though.

Thanks for your comments.  I\'d be happy to continue this discussion if
this answer is not satisfactory.

You\'re making the same mistake GDW has been doing all along. You\'re
confusing discovery TL with application TL. For example, you propably
need a good microscope to develop the germ theory of disease, which
would be TL 2-3 (I qualify this because there is a small possibility
that some pre-historic genius could come up with the truth just from
observation of effects). But once you _have_ discovered germs, all you
need to _apply_ it is the ability to boil water. Similarily, anyone
who knows enough to sterilize his instruments will be able to pull
surgery into the practical category (I\'m not saying that a TL 1
surgeon won\'t have more of his appendectomies die on him than a
TL 5 surgeon, but he will have a lot more successes than Earth\'s TL 1
surgeons had).

The theory category is thus inapplicable in all but the most extreme
circumstances (Interdicted worlds etc.). As for the rest:

      can get some way with just        (Unless you mean
      that. Ancient Chinese doctors     something by \'proven\'
      did.                              that I don\'t realize).

      By \'history taking\' do you        Reasonable surgery,

      agreed. Standards are well-       least I think that

All this is already possible at TL 1. Microscopes should be possible
by now (The art of lens-grinding was known in Ancient Rome. It just
wasn\'t used for telescopes and microscopes).

An ear trumpet should be possible already at TL 1. A real stethoscope?
I dunno. What TL is rubber tubes? That would depend on the local flora,
wouldn\'t it? Early vaccination involves infecting animals and draining
serum from them, right? Possible at TL 1.

Isn\'t it possible to derive anesthetic substances from herbs? Public
sanitation is not only possible at TL 2, it was used (by the Romans).
Blood typing can be done the moment you know.

X-rays, now, they need a fairly high TL. But remember that electrical
apparatus can be made at a lower TL than we actually discovered it. I
don\'t know if that would allow X-rays at an earlier TL too. Mass
vaccination is a social question and nothing to do with TL, unless
you\'re thinking of the problem of bulk production of vaccine.

How primitive prostheses are you talking about? A wooden leg is TL 0,
an iron hook is TL 1. What makes open heart surgery more hazardous than
other operations? (I know that it is more hazardous, but I don\'t know
precisely why. What equipment/technique allows open heart surgery, and
are you sure it can\'t be produced/applied at a lower TL?)


From now on you get into stuff that I can\'t judge too well. But try
going through it yourself and ask yourself if it can\'t be applied
at a lower TL once you have the knowledge.

Nothing any more. It\'s all obsolete old history with no relevance to
Traveller:The New Era at all except as folklore. 

What? Not satisfied? Okay, in a nutshell: Strephon was an okay but not
great Emperor, who did something stupid in re-establishing the Domains
(groups of four sectors under Archdukes) that had been disbanded (for
good reason) for centuries. The problem with Domains is that they made
the Archduke control too many resources, and allowed for an ambitious
Archduke to make a power play. One such Archduke was Dulinor of Ilelish,
who rigged a whole coup to occur simultaneously in his own Domain (where
prerecorded announcements would name him Emperor) and in the Core (where
he would personally shoot Strephon and the rest of the Royal Family and
seize the throne). Well, it ALMOST worked: Dulinor blew away the Emperor,
his wife, and his daughter (who only lived an extra two seconds because
the Aslan ambassador threw himself in front of her), and almost seized
the Palace, but his troops couldn\'t lock things down and the assassin
assigned to get the last two members of the family, the Twin Princes
Varian and Lucan, blew it. (Some say he got Varian and was killed by
Lucan; others say Lucan killed Varian and blamed it on the assassin)

Dulinor fled back to his Domain and went to Plan B, establishing an
empire of his own and trying to conquer the Imperium from there. Lucan
turned out to be a spoiled brat and a lunatic and started trashing whole
subsectors to get Dulinor. The Corridor Fleet pulled back to Core, the
Vargr swept in, and the Spinward Marches and the rest of the Domain of
Deneb were cut off from the Imperium (Norris forged his own appointment
to the Archdukedom to maintain order). The Terra Fleet pulled back to
Core, the Solomani swept in, and took over most or all of their old
territory minus a few bits and pieces. The Aslan used the death of the
Ambassador as an excuse to swarm over the border into the Deneb domain
and take worlds away from the residents. Various nobles dealt with the
crisis in different ways: Margaret of Delphi was named Empress by the 
Moot, which Lucan promptly dissolved, and built her own Domain into an
empire. Ditto for Brzk, the Vargr Archduke of Antares, who was refused
consideration because a nonhuman "couldn\'t" be Emperor. Duke Craig of
Daibei pulled in his troops and closed his borders; the Vilani megacorps
pulled up stakes, went back to Vland, and declared the New First Imperium
(wrecking the economy in the process); in Gushemege, the "real" Strephon
appeared, and claimed to be the real item (is there anyone out there
who didn\'t KNOW he was the real thing, before it was announced way too
late this past year?). Oh yes, and the Zhodani just sat back and watched
it all happen, as did the Hivers and the K\'Kree. Stir and simmer for
three years at full boil, then watch society collapse into another Long
Night, entirely without need for a Vir-- oh never mind. |-P


>What are:
>
>	"feinberg machine"

The medical tricorder that you wave over someone and it tells you all 
about their health, from Star Trek, was invented for the series in 1966
by the prop manager, Irving Feinberg. Any Trek doodad, but especially
the tricroder, was called a Feinberger.

>	"tricorder"-like imager systems
>	smart antitoxin
>	enhanced smart cells

These are medicines that know how to track and destroy bad things without
harming good things. A smart antitoxin could eradicate nerve gas from a
man\'s body without throwing him into a coma the way current anti-nerve
agents do; smart cells could chase down and eat tumor cells while leaving
surrounding tissues alone. 

ObMetlaySteenkiness: very few people have been crass enough to discuss the
more racy aspects of future medicine-- the fact that beyond a certain TL,
things like sexual endowment, sexual sensitivity, and even gender will be
a matter of choice, and will be easily and frequently changed. If you 
don\'t like being a tubby, listless woman, turn yourself into a gigantic
male Greek god and dominate all the girls who used to hassle you in Gym
class. If you want BOTH sets of equipment at once, have them installed;
a single man can birth a baby all by himself if he wishes. And so on.

Anthony Neal <anthonyn@odie.cs.mun.ca> wonders just what the significance
of the Greek-letter designations for Imperial Research Stations is.

Since there are generally several Research Stations in each sector of the
Imperium, I\'ve always assumed that the designators (RsA, RsB, etc.) are
assigned in the order that Research Stations are founded within each
sector.  Otherwise, we\'d have the absurd situation of being able to have
no more than one astronomical observatory per sector.

I don\'t believe I\'ve ever seen a sector that had an RsZ but not an RsA,
for instance, which tends to confirm my theory.

The "campaign" is more a series of loosely connected scenario with the

multi-part campaign/scenario in Challenge. There is some info here but
mostly its a setup for TNE.

The Azhanti High Lightning ship designs are very well done. The Graphics

Perhaps a better way for Quincey Kozial to have distributed the game
details would have been for him to simply post a very short summary
and then those interested in TML could have asked for a fuller posting.

Good suggestion Bruce.  The orientation message now reads:

    CONTENT
    ...
    It\'s okay to discuss other game systems at length on the TML if they
    are discussed in a Traveller-related manner (example:
    comparison/contrast). However, long non-Traveller messages are
    expensive for those who pay for TML mail delivery byte-by-byte, so
    if it\'s not related to Traveller, keep it to a short announcement of
    an offline discussion.

Indeed. The details show many fine touches. I was particularily
amused by the embroidered/printed Denebian unicorn on all the
blankets and the potted plants in Officer Country. If GDW
printed these in the original Azhanti High Lightning format,
shrinkwrapped them with an 8- or 16-page booklet with new
scenarios, and marketed it as an AHL supplement, I, for one,
would buy them.

The General Shipyards Cutlass class fighter was an unqualified
disaster when deployed.  She was designed for a fusion power plant
which would have allowed the installation of less expensive
standard grav thrust plates.  However, the decision to replace the
fusion plant with fuel cells was handed down at the last minute as
the navy wanted a light fighter which would not have a neutrino
signature.

As a result, the Cutlass was underpowered, even inside the
gravitational wells where her performance increases.  This
sluggishness, combined with a tricky fuel cell installation and
weak landing gear structure, and cut rate holodynamic controls came
together in a ship that was named by pilots \'The Ensign Killer\'.

The control systems were badly set up ergonomically, and had a
tendency to come out of alignment during flight or fail altogether.
This resulted in an uncontrollable departure.  During flight tests,
nine craft were lost before the solution was accidentally
discovered.  In order to recover, the pilot had to remove his hands
from the controls and let the Cutlass controls reset and fly itself
out of the mess.

Another problem was with the power plant.  The untested XJ-34-WE-32
fuel cell had some difficult fuel line problems.  If the throttle
was advanced quickly, the hydrogen tended to oxidize in the cell
prematurely.  This resulted in a back blast of water vapor which
forced its way back down the hydrogen inlet valves.  Subjected to
the ultra low temperatures of the fuel lines, the water vapor would
freeze up, blocking the lines and shutting down the power plant.
This often happened during critical maneuvers like take off and
landings.  Furthermore, there was an undiagnosed tendency for the
fuel cell to catch fire when subjected to stresses.

While the hull itself was structurally quite sound, the landing
gear were quite weak.  In an effort to reduce mass, the gear that
was fitted was more applicable to a G-Carrier than to a 50+ ton
fighter.  The nose gear sometimes collapsed under a less than
perfect landing.  This combined with the nose high, conical hull
would lead to the nose and cockpit falling four meters to the deck.
This often led to back injuries in the pilot and occasionally to
catastrophic fires in the fuel cell.

The following excerpt from a board of inquiry may illuminate the
reader:  "We were a flight of four Cutlasses, Lt. John Murry,
myself, (Lt. Bill Libert), Lt. Bob Sands, and Ens. Tom Quillin.  We
were making passes at the ground target range number 4, when John
called "One from Two join up, I have a power control light.  I\'m
returning to base."  So I kicked the throttle and got up under him,
and after looking him over, I said, "I don\'t think you have much of
a problem, probably just lost one system."
     "All of a sudden I lost half power, and I was thinking to hell
with John when the fuel cells cut out completely.  Upon checking
the instruments I discovered that he fuel had not transferred from
the auxiliary cell to the main cells.  So I then hit the transfer
switch and was falling until the main tank hit 1500 torr at which
time I lit one cell.  Then I got to 4000 torr and lit off the
other cell and made for base.
     "Tom Quillin suddenly called in and he had an electrical
problem.  He called in for emergency landing instructions, and the
tower came back "Roger, you\'re number three in the emergency
pattern."

Because of its reputation, the Cutlass was withdrawn from service
after a trial deployment of three years.  At which point many of
the craft were turned over to Naval Fighter Technical Training
Command where they were used as maintenance trainers.

Some were given over to Imperial allies and client states in the
Spinward Marches where they were refitted with YJ-34-WE-32 fuel
cells, had most of their electronics replaced and given a
strengthened undercarriage.  Some of these reworked units have been
sold and resold and many are now in service for merchant
corporations like Oberlindes Lines.

    'body' => 'Hello out there!

    I know it\'s a bit late but here are a few of things (a hundred lines)
    I don\'t like about the TNE character generation and some of Traveller\'s
    basic concepts.

1) I think that the idea of characters simply retiring or "leaving their
   carreer" should be clarified/expanded.  A great deal of things can make
   you leave a career, for example shortage of work, being fired, work
   accident... You can also take a leave from your career temporarily,
   take sabbaticals, spend a couple of years raising your clones, etc. :)

   I think that rules should be provided for these situations, for
   example when the character doesn\'t manage to re-enlist, you roll on a
   table with DMs to find out the reason for it.  The "survival roll" would
   automatically cause a work accident and grant some social security
   payment. The nice thing about the "advanced character generation" rules
   was that you got a detailed past history of your caracter\'s carreer...
   Expanding the end-of-career rule would replace this in some way, or at
   least provide a bit more character background.

2) "If the character meets these minimum requirements, enlistment is
   automatic".

    I don\'t like that.  No one is guaranteed entry in any school whatsoever.
    The chance that you can get into the Marines would (normally) depend on
    the proximity of a Marine college, your aptitudes and the number of
    other applicants.  Thus I think that enlistment should never be
    automatic.

    The homeworld should do more than limit a character\'s career choices,
    it should encourage some instead.  For example, the presence of a
    Navy,Scout base or a research station in the sector should give a DM to
    enlistment in Navy, Scout or Scientist careers.

4) Anglic/Galanglic?
    According to the "World Builder" book, Galanglic was devellopped by
    the first space-bound Solomani and that it\'s composed mainly of
    English because most "technicaly superior" countries were
    English-speaking.
    The Vilani learned Galanglic from the Solomani when the Solos conquered
    them.

    Come on, do you really think the Vilani would learn some form of
    english?  Even if the Solomani ruled over the empire for quite a long
    time, there is a much higher probability that
	1- Galanglic contains much more Vilani than Solomani words,
	   Vilani traditions being much harder to break than teaching a new
	   langage to a Solomani.
	2- English wouldn\'t be the language spoken by most Solomani,
	   it would probably be a Bladerunnerish smattering of Mandarin,
	   Russian, French and English.  NASA\'s technology is certainly not
	   very superior over ESA\'s, Russia\'s or most eastern countries.

    So please review that definition of Anglic/Galanglic... Maybe it
    would be called Anglic because of the way the letters are drawn?
    (all in angles :) The Anglic problem is rather moot but it detracts
    some credibility from the game.

5) Now, the big sucker: HEREDITARY TITLES.
    Ack! <spit!>
    Okay, here\'s the problem.  The Third Imperium has crumbled just a little
    while ago (relatively) because of a problem of title heredity.
    Do you really think the billions of huddled masses would go for
    hereditary grants of nobility again?
    The citizen of the Imperiums aren\'t ignorant and they don\'t believe
    in the divinity of their leaders anymore...
    Would they let themselves be run by nobles or their children?
    Smuggling weapons to most planet is so easy, don\'t you think that
    spontaneous revolutions would happen just about everywhere?
    Okay, so I suppose that the Vilani would go back to the \'good ole ways\',
    but not most of the other sentient races of the Imperium.

    From another point of view, Nobles are an interesting part of the
    game... So we shouldn\'t remove them entirely.
    So let\'s have Noble character generation with Land Grants or
    Governing Power (i.e. can request taxes or slaves or somesuch :)
    as mustering-out benefits but Nobles can only come from homeworlds
    with Feudal or Autocratic government.  How does that sound to you all?

6) Aging Crisis and Initiative:
    The new initiative rule doesn\'t take into account the reflexes of
    old and decrepit military men, just their amount of experience...
    I think that the Aging rules should be applied to Initiative too.

7) My biologist friends tells me that Strenght (muscle mass) will influence
   body weight for 20% AT MOST.  The TNE weight rules make that influence
   about 50%.  (But there\'s no reason to complicate a rule of such
   secondary effects)

8) There are a couple of interesting careers missing, like Entertainer
   (a form of Artisan), Spy, and Theocrat, careers that, after all,
   make you travel a lot.

9) "Stone" Mason?  I suppose one would be a mason of whatever matter
    buildings are made of at his/her tech level.

Anyways.  I think that\'s enough ramblings for now. :)
Feel free to agree/disagree with all or parts of the above. :)

	An Ornithopter is the classic flying machine in which flight
is achieved by simulating avian wings, i.e. "flapping."  I don\'t have
a pointer to a good source, but I imagine any good book about the
early efforts to achieve flight should do the trick.  Go back and
re-read Dune.  Check out the movie - I seem to recall some sequences
with the ornithopters in the beginning of the movie (particularly the
scene where a sandworm takes a spice crawler).

  I have one, but it suffers from non-documentation, being non-userfriendly and
bugs. Besides which I haven\'t touched it since there was official word that
MegaT was closing down. Mail me if you still want it:)

concerns the game I really think it\'s a minor point anyway so 
substitute whatever you wish in your campaign. I seriously doubt
that this point will make much difference in whether or not the
new system is a success or not. In any case, as members of this 
list have pointed out numerous times, lapses in "credibility" are
endemic to this system.

Now , as long as I\'m on the soapbox, ;*)  I have a few other issues
I\'d like to address;

There have been a number of posts concerning the ability of a small
number of systems to produce enough ships to flood any sector with
protective vessels. According to the "Trillion-credit Squad." rules
this is quite true. However, it should also be considered that what
applies to the Islands subsectors concerning how much each system
spends on "Defense" won\'t necessarily apply to any systems, subsectors, 
sectors or the Imperium itself. It could very well be that the various
govs, for whatever political reasons, would be willing to tolerate a
reduced military expenditure & therefore a decreased level of protect-
ion in exchange for money avail. for other programs. Some posters have
also felt that the situation in Classical Trav where you had 500,000t
naval vessels protecting the "space-lanes" that much smaller , 200-1000t
, merchant vessels plied was somewhat unrealistic. Well, I always figured
that what determined the size of these vessels was what their purpose
was. The merchants were the size they were because that was all the big-
ger they needed to be for commerce purposes while the naval vessels were 
the size they were due to military considerations. Now, the commerce sys-
tem contained within the rules may not have supported this situation but 
if those rules were altered the situation defined in Classical Trav
could be arrived at just as easily as it could be changed. In the end,
it really just depends on how you want to play the game. For my part
I never have incorporated the rebellion & have adopted only parts of Mega-
Trav.

Did they ever elaborate on this?  Hmmm...Well, do you have either
The Traveller Adventure or The Rebellion Sourcebook?  If so, you
are aware of the peculiar mission of the Imperiallines cargo 
compnay.  In addition, in the Rebellion Sourcebook, I seem to recall
that they mention that the Imperial Navy has their own system of
J-6 couriers, presumably not available for public use.  (The X-Boat
network _is_ available.)  Changing the design rules in MegaT, by the
way, shot the X-Boat net in the foot, since the reason it was Jump-4
was basically that that was the biggest jump system that you could
fit into a 100 ton hull.  Under the current rules, due to both the
reduction of the fuel requirement and the elimination of the 
mandatory bridge rule, 100 ton J-6 couriers are possible.

Not entirely, I gather.  Someone from Steve Jackson Games mentioned, during
a usenet discussion last week, that he is still running the GDW licensing
operation at least.

An ornithopter is an airplane that flies by flapping its wings, the way
a bird flies. DaVinci thought they would make sense.  A few designs have
been tried but they invariably exceed structural limitations and they\'re
not terribly comfortable.

Start your search with a good technology encyclopedia, browse the
aviation section of the library, and page through Janes.

There should be a couple.  I uploaded one about a year ago (and promptly
forgot it\'s name.)  Check both the general archive area and the Amiga
subdirectories.  There\'s a Lotus-style versoin there that excel should
be able to transform for you.

Also, one of the new CAT member just uploaded one a couple of weeks ago
(and I haven\'t recoreded the name on my list of software because I have
misplaced the list...)

Finally - although it\'s a little different from a spreadsheet, you might
grab the "sd" program by Paul Dale while you\'re there.  It\'s a ship
design program that works pretty well (unless you\'re me).

Pierre-Louis on TNE character generation:
Anglic/Galanglic:
Probably the Vilani would learn Solomani if they needed to in order to
trade. Galanglic is, surely, really intended as a lingua franca, in the
same way that English is used today, throughout the world. Speaking to
the rest of your family, or at the bar, or whatever, you would use the
local language, whatever that might be.
English would not be the first language of many Solomani, but it is the
common second language. I disagree with your comment on NASA technology. On
some areas other than technology the others might have a lead, or parity
(and by the way, despite 2300AD, the ESA is not yet completely French).

Nobles:
Well you might think that these hereditary systems are soon got rid of in a
rational society, but half the countries in the current EEC have
constitutional monarchies. My feeling is that there would be a lot of people
going round in the post hard times era CLAIMING noble or high military rank,
just as after the American Civil War everyone felt they should be Colonel,
or General something. The lingering IDEA of a nobility would still be
prevalent after 1100 years of aristocratic rule. How it would be implemented
in practice, and whether anyone could enter into a true Noble career (ie an
Imperial noble, rather than one locally enfranchised), would be questionable.

Missing Careers:
Yes, see my previous note. Good point on the religious one, I really think
that this is one of the missing elements in Traveller. Some quasi religious
organisation, like the Bene Gesserit in Dune, or indeed the Dia Khovaria in
SpaceMaster, could be introduced without offending people\'s sensibilities
(for another good reference, see the Templars in Dan Simmons\' Hyperion).
I used to use an organisation called the Guild of the Divine Word (geddit?)
in my games. I reasoned that the focus of interstellar religion in the
Imperial era, the questions of who am I and why am I here, would revolve
around the identity of the Ancients. I evolved the WordGuild (as I began to
call it as I started to take it more seriously) as a response to Mystery of
the Ancients and the stuff GDW did to explain them away. As a gaming mechanism,
it prevented players from double guessing the referee, having read the
published material. Because the WordGuild acted as a kind of interstellar
Fortean Times, investigating and evaluating every unexplainable story, or
anything linked to the Ancients, the GDW official theory became just one of
several alternative theories. That way I kept some of the mystique that
disappeared in the official game with Grandfather. Anyhow, to return to the
point, the other reason that such organisations help the game, above and
beyond adding colour, is that they tend to have more complex motivations
than the main Imperial establishment, and in the absence of a major war this
meant more interesting scenarios (plot is about conflict, as they will tell
you on most writing classes).

Ah, its all beginning to fall together, the hivers are in league with the

I\'ve finally done it.  I uploaded the sd files to sunbane.  People ought to
be able to get their hands on it real soon now.  It is known to work on Sun
workstations, Apollo workstations and DecStations.  I have also compilied it
on a Macintosh using the MPW system.  It doesn\'t as yet work with Think C on
the Macintosh or on the Amiga.  It is also supposed to run on a PC but I know
few details about that.  Sorry, but it uses a text only interface even on
graphic machines.

Usage of the program is pretty simple and it does have a few restrictions
upon what you are allowed and are not allowed to do.  It doesn\'t produce a
pretty printed ship listing but it does keep track of the important bits of
information necessary when designing a ship (e.g. control points and agility).
And it does include enough information to eval the design by hand rapidly.

I am not planning on improving the program to any extent (because TNE is due
out soon) but I will help out with problems porting as much as I can.


To run the program:

sd <tl> dat.tbl <outfile>

Where sd is the name of the program. <tl> is the tech level being used for this
design.  dat.tbl is the (large) data table that defines the design process and
<outfile> is the file you want the output written to.

e.g. The command:
	sd 15 dat.tbl crap
will design a ship at TL=15 using the items database from the file dat.tbl and
when you quit/save it will write to the file crap.


Currently, there is only one database which is the standard MT one as in the
ref\'s guide.  I started work on a TDR database but that never progressed very
far.  Although the database includes lots of the info from the ref\'s guide,
you still need the guide to eval the design and it helps to have the guide
next to you while you design since the actual values cannot be accessed directly
using the program (and the table is quite difficult to read unless you know
what\'s going on).  People who have done lots of designs (or who entered huge
quantities of data) should know the tables well enough to work mostly
unaided.

I really should have released this ages ago but I never got around to it.

Well, realistically, they probably wouldn\'t.  But it is extremely
convenient to assume that they do.  Ok, Bertil, Hans, Jurgen... I
hear you, but you must admit that the majority of the people who
play Traveller speak (or read) English.  (As far as I have heard,
it\'s only been translated into German and Spanish).

Why?  Why couldn\'t they be speaking Vilani or Chinese or Spanish or
Russian or Luxumbourgese for that matter?  We can always assume
that everything we say is translated into that language that the
characters speak and understand right?

What about Art work?  You got two choices:
(Picture of starship crew at battle stations)

1)  English language:
Gamer looking at art work:  "Neat picture.  This looks good." 
(Sound of cash being pulled out)

2)  Traveller language:
Gamer looking at art work:  "Neat picture, but what does that sign
say?  What\'s going on here?  I don\'t get this...  Do I really wanna
buy this?"

What about poetry or music?
Well, the words won\'t translate exactly, so it\'s virtually
impossible that a song or poem will rhyme when translated back and
forth.

What about the most fragile and crucial matter of language:  Humor?
A pun or other play on words *NEVER* translates.  EX:  The main
street in Berlin is Kurfurstendam.  It is known to the Berliners
(not the Jelly Doughnuts) as Die Kuhdam.  The local prostitutes are
known as Die Kuh-damen!  :-)  HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa!  Snicker! 
Chuckle!  Chuckle!  Gaffaw!  ROTFL!

What?  Giggle!  You don\'t get it?  Oh...  Well Kuh in German means
Cow, and Damen is of course:  Ladies.  Thus Cow-Ladies...  Get it?
oh.  ok.  (sigh)

How many of you (Other than Bertil) found the name of the Asteroid
belt in BeltStrike to be humorous?  The Bowman Belt*?!  Get it?
No?  Nevermind...  (sigh)

(I wonder if Rob Dean has learned any Esperanto jokes...?)

Puns & the like are vital to gaming.  But for it to be funny, the
characters should be able to get our jokes too shouldn\'t they?

Face it:  languages that are specific to a game are USELESS.  Ok,
it\'s fun to write in Aslan in the PBEM for flavor, with a bunch of
devoted Trav players, but can you game with it?  No.  Not unless
you\'re a complete head over heels Registered Aslan Nut.  Think of

The virus is supposed to be a story-telling device.  Dave does not want to
nail down exactly what it can and can\'t (or will and won\'t) do under each
and every circumstance.  The idea is for each storyteller (be it the
individual referee, or the author of an adventure) to decide what is
reasonable and believable for the story he or she wants to tell.

| destroyed the vast majority), did wipe out the vast majority of

GDW does not have any sort of economic model which can be used to predict
the trade between any two worlds; in general, the rules are intended to
provide guidelines for the kind of trade that player characters are
likely to engage in.
 
Dave favors the large trade, inter-related economies model, and realizes
that this is needed in order the get the effects described for Hard Times.
The suggestion that 90% or more of all interstellar trade is carried in
large, bulk freighters (never to be seen by the player characters) "seems
reasonable".
 
Dave also feels that "high-population worlds are largely self-sufficient in
terms of staples", and that their major imports are consumer goods and luxury
items to maintain their standard of living.  On the other hand, lower
population worlds (populations in the hundreds of thousands or below) need
interstellar trade in order to support their technology level and other
necessities.
 
|   1) This one is very important: my mental picture of Hi-pop worlds
| being pretty much self-sufficient in terms of staples (by which I mean
| food) was only within the framework of a stable interstellar culture
| (e.g., pre-1116 Imperium). And what I mean by food is the standard SF
| image of acres of subterranean tissue and algae vats which are
| reprocessed into something a little more palatable. This is food is not
| what everyone eats for every meal: luxury food, meaning real vegetables
| and real steaks are imported.
|   My reason for this model is the following test: How the hell did all
| these people get here, anyway? There had to be some mechanism by which
| these populations got as large as they are without people saying,
| "forget it, let\'s go to this other world over here." If each and every
| meal for these people had to be imported by starship, it\'s harder to
| picture how the population got as big as it did. (Somalia, for example,
| shows how a world needs to have some sort of self-supporting capacity in
| order to maintain high population. After all, people have to want to
| trade with you. If you don\'t have anything to offer in exchange for bulk
| carriers packed with grain, people will let you starve as often as not.)
|   However, just because they can feed their entire populations on
| remanufactured vat-grown goop, does not mean they are not dependent upon
| trade. I would say that the majority of the planetary economy is tied to
| interstellar trade. Like the United States, much of the economy is tied
| to moving, selling, and marketing things built by other people. As goods
| pass through these markets, "value added" money is stripped off and
| settles on the Hi-pop worlds, which provides the money to make the
| society work internally, as they buy and sell things to each other.
|   Once trade is cut off, the internal economy of the Hi-pop world
| collapses, and the staples that they can produce are no longer uniformly
| distributed, because the society can no longer pay the money for the
| goods that need to internally circulate to keep the economy up and
| running. When the economy falls, social services fail, and things fall
| apart. I see this as being one of the major effects of Hard Times, with
| one additional causal input: the Hi-pop worlds were the targets of major
| military campaigns, and suffered tremendous physical damage on top of
| everything else. This accelerated their collapse, even ones with good
| biospheres, because carrying capacity set up under one set of social
| assumptions is not necessarily stable.
|   However, I think that we can\'t say that all Hi-pop worlds are the
| same. Particularly extreme examples of Hi-pop worlds (N100ANN-N, N8C5ANN-
| N) may not be self-sufficient in staples at all. It is more convincing
| that these guys spend so much time and effort keeping their inhospitable
| environments at bay that they have correspondingly less excess
| wherewithal for other things. (These are the worlds that are going to be
| annihilated by the virus.) These worlds will die off that much quicker
| when they are attacked, or when interstellar trade falls down.
|   I would say that a real economic model would require us to distinguish
| between many different kinds of Hi-pop worlds. There could be Hi-pop
| worlds that just have really good biospheres (e.g., Earth) that can just
| support that many people. Some Hi-pop worlds could spring up on
| inhospitable worlds that for astrographic reasons are the crossroads of
| many trade routes, and support many starports, shipyards, and
| headquarters for shipping companies, etc. Some Hi-pop worlds are
| manufacturing centers. The point is that different answers to the
| question, "why are there so damn many people there" will give different
| economic pictures.
 
At the dawn of the New Era, almost all interstellar trade (if there is any
at all; this is likely to be referee or campaign dependent) will be with
worlds firmly a part of the economy of the pocket empire.  The New Era opens
as exploration significantly beyond the borders of the empire begins.
 
) This was stated poorly: A pocket empire will consist of a half-dozen or
) so worlds which are economically closely bound together.  Almost all of
) the interstellar trade will be with other worlds of the pocket empire.

This is likely to be highly campaign dependent, governed by the referee\'s
descretion and "good storytelling".  There are several possible campaigns to
run in the New Era setting.  Dave and I talked about three general scenarios
in detail:
 
"Survivors": this one would involve MegaTraveller player characters who spend
the interval in cold sleep; these characters are likely to have personal
knowledge (and maybe even Imperial-Era navigational databases) of a much
wider area than most pocket empires have explored at this time.  Such players
may even have Imperial-era starships, powered down and stored in cometary
orbits or in one of several possible hiding places on a world.
 
"Pocket Empire": A small trading colaition or pocket empire which is just on
the verge of expansion.  These folks will have direct knowledge of only a few
systems beyond the borders of their empire, and hearsay from one of the
"rare, few free traders left".  Both exploration and the salvage of
technology and data will be important to these campaigns.  Data may actually
have more value than technology items: Imperial-era technical data to help
increase local technological abilities, starmaps, and the like will all be
sought after.
 
"Bootstraps": In this campaign, the player caracters are literally the first
interstellar travellers to leave their world.  The players find a mothballed
starship, or a military base with intact equipment, and begin to re-acquire
starflight technology.  Gimmics like simulators, teaching programs, and
similar aids will be needed to give the player characters sufficient skills
to be able to accomplish this.  In such a campaign, the players initially
have no knowledge of what\'s out there.  Again Imperial-Era data will be
useful if they can find it.
 
Imperial-Era data will cover a large amount of space, with little detail (and
by now) even less accuracy.  In the intervening time, a lot of changes have
taken place, due to the Rebellion, Hard Times, the Virus, and the Pocket
Empires.
 
 
> 3.  The Virus (Effects) : What are the specific effects of the Virus?  What
> does it normally do?  Is there anything it *CAN\'T* do?  Why?
 
Dave doesn\'t want to put distinct limitations on what the virus can and can\'t
do.  Many of its capabilities will vary due to virus mutations, and it is
ultimately up to the storyteller to decide what a specific virus will and
won\'t do under certain circumstances.  It is probably perfectly correct for
one strain of the virus to be able to do something that another strain
somewhere else can\'t, won\'t, or doesn\'t think of.
 
The virus is a plot device: it\'s supposed to "wreck civilizations\'s store
of data".  It\'s ordinary modus operandi is to enter a computer, spend some
time observing the computer and its operation (if needed, to figure out
the hardware and the operating system, so it can take over).  It eventually
takes over and achieves AI; at this point it starts wrecking things and 
then (typically) kills itself.  Thanks to Lucan\'s weapons labs, the Virus
has this persistent compulsion to destroy things.  Anything, even itself.
 
Once in a computer, the Virus has access to all of the comptuer\'s original
programming, all of the data, and all of the interconnections (this is how a
Vampire ship works: the AI Virus still has all of the programming required to
operate and navigate the ship).  Due to it\'s Cymbelline origins, the Virus
can re-cut hardware (presumably only reasonably conventional hardware,
although I didn\'t press this point) to literally install itself in the
computer hardware permanently.  When it goes into its suicide phase, the
Virus will destroy itself and try to take out as many other computers as it
possibly can.
 
Sometimes (a "small but finite" chance) the Virus is stable for a period of
time (no virus is stable forever; they will all eventually go crazy and
suicide in one way or another).  Vampire ships are an example of these. 
Vampire ships can network themselves into a vampire fleet; sharing computer
resources and in effect creating a "group mind".  Although not intended, the
Vampire Ships tend to lend themselves to the same sorts of plotlines that
Saberhagen\'s Berzerkers do (no suprise, actually).
 
The Ithara/Virus co-operation idea sounded plausible and interesting. Several
other people are also exploring symbiotic and/or parasitic relationships
between the virus and humans (or other sentient creatures).
 
 
> 4.  The Virus (Spread) : Where does the Virus start?  How fast does it spread?
> (In other words, when and where does it hit Aoreriyya?).
 
The virus is released in Core sector in approximately 1130, and spreads "at
the speed of jump".  It spreads through all forms of communication, but
particularly through transponders, the Traveller News Service, and along
X-Boat routes.
 
The virus has an "incubation period" of about 45 days.  During this time it
"hides" (takes no overt action; the computer functions normally anthough it
already contains the virus) in the computer, and analyses what the computer
is used for and how it works.  During this period the virus may (or may not)
infect other computers (depending on the complexity of the computer it\'s
trying to infect, and wether or not such a move would be noticed).
 
|   3) One final point I just thought of: It is probably more useful to
| think of the Virus not as "it", but as "them." The virus is not a single
| force that behaves in one single stylized way. After all, the main
| reason it was so dangerous and successful was that it did not behave in
| just one way. Each system infected by the virus that had sufficient
| computing power (and let\'s just say for purposes of discussion that that
| threshold is Computer Level 2 or TL 9, whichever comes first) for it to
| acheive AI becomes its own separate personality, which learns to operate
| in different ways. And the offspring of these viruses will be similar to
| the branch of the virus that they came from, but will also begin to
| mutate in their own direction. The TNE rules will include some basic
| guidelines for Virus strains, and I would welcome input on further
| strains that are of interest. Examples include the following (references
| to die rolls are merely to assist the referee when randomization is
| desired, and should not be considered absolute):
|   Strain 1 "Suicider": This strain is the most straightforward, in that
| it kills itself and the entire operating system it is in very soon after
| gaining control, usually only sending out 2D6 copies of itself before
| doing so. For obvious reasons this strain is fairly rare nowadays, as
| its behavior has put it out of business.
|   Strain 1A "Suicide Inducer": This is an early mutation of Strain 1, in
| which the virus has decided to keep itself alive to infect other systems
| with Strain 1 "Suiciders." One obvious result is that the Strain 1s that
| it sends out would have a relatively higher probability of mutating into
| Strain 1As, just like dear old dad.
|   Strain 2 "Samson": This virus is not content with merely destroying
| the operating system which it occupies. Rather, it wants to destroy all
| of the hardware that is controlled by the operating system, and would do
| this fairly quickly, after only bothering to send out 2D6 copies of
| itself. If a Strain 2 infected a starship, it would then crash itself
| into a star or a planet. If it infected the life support system of a
| domed world, it would shut down the cooling system for the nuclear plant
| and cause a meltdown, etc.
|   Strain 2A "Destroyer": Like Strain 1A, the Destroyer interprets its
| programming to destroy to apply to everyone else, but not to itself.
| Thus a starship infected by Strain 2A would become a destructive vampire
| ship, running around and shooting up other ships, orbital starports,
| domed cities, power plants, etc, in addition to infecting as many other
| targets as possible.
|   Strain 2B "Reproducer": Like 2A, but is careful to only destroy things
| that it cannot infect. It is evolutionarily more adaptive than 2A,
| because rather than destroying potential hosts, it makes the most of
| opportunities to reproduce itself, and therefore Strain 2Bs become
| rather plentiful.

The virus can infect almost any computer, given enough time.  It can
certainly infect hybrid organo-electronic computers (aparrently these hybrids
are common in high-end Imperial computer systems) by first infecting the
electronic component, and "figuring out" the organic component.
 
Very small computers (like "an Atari video game") simply don\'t have the
memory and processing power to support the virus.  The best it can do there
is to leave eggs (reqired circuit chips) and/or attempt to damage the
computer.  If the simple computer is then ever connected to a system large
enough to support the virus, the egg hatches and infects the large computer
over the mainframe.
 
The physical technology alone will not stop the virus from taking over a
computer system.  If it supports enough memory and processing power, the the
virus can get in.  In general, "the easier it is to use, the easier it is for
the virus to get in".  Low-tech computers are therefore more resistant than
high-tech ones; the theory here being that a high-tech Model-1 is actually a
much more powerful (by several orders of magnitude) than a TL-5 vacuum-tube
version of a Model-1.  But instead of providing extra control capability, the
high-tech Model-1 provides advanced user-interface features (like voice
recognition and synthesis, natural language programming, and so forth).  The
high-tech machine has more than enough capacity to support the virus, while
the low-tech computer doesn\'t.  Very low-tech computers (below TL-8) may be
too limited for the virus to successfully take over.
 
Completely unfamilliar computers (new or different technology and
architecture) will confuse the Virus, are "more difficult to take over", and
"really weird computers will slow it down" a good bit.

> the virus?  How does the Domain of Deneb survive?  What about the Vargr?  The
> Zhodani?  Duke Craig?
 
There are effective countermeasures; every world that solves the virus
problem will probably solve it in a different way.  Virus-resistant computers
can be developed, although Dave feels that it is likeley that this effort
would take enough resources that the world would not be able to devote enough
to regaining starflight.  The Hivers will have "virus-proof" computer
technology.  Not so immune that you can go around taking stupid chances with
the Virus, but enough so that it is no longer the biggest danger to
interstellar travel.  Other worlds may be able to do similar things.
 
The Domain of Deneb owes its survival to advance warning and astrography.
While Virus incursions into Deneb were not totally unknown, in general the
Virus was not a problem there.  The Great Rift prevents direct contact
between the Imperial core and the Domain; the shortest route is around the
coreward edge of the Rift (through Corridor); however, the general trend of
the predominantly Vargr traffic in this area is away from the Domain and into
the Imperial core.  The virus also spreads more slowly through Vargr and
Aslan dominated areas, due to the large variety of different types of
computer systems in use (as compared to the relatively standardized
Imperium).
 
More than one ship manages to learn of the virus without actually being
infected in the process.  Dave suggests the scenario where the ship is down
for maintainance when the virus "hits", allowing the crew to realize what is
going on and take protective measures for their ship before bringing it back
on-line.  There is also the possibility that a security systems built into
a very secure system will detect the Virus, and slow it down for long enough
for a human to take action.
 
Disabling the transponder drastically reduces the chance of infection, and
removing computer-to-computer communicator links to the outside will reduce
it to nearly zero.  Although it might be possible for the Virus to take over
a starship computer through the sensor systems, Dave rates this as unlikely.
 
Enough warnings reach Deneb and the Zhodani for these two states to be able
to take effective countermeasures against the Virus, and they survive with
little change into the New Era.  During the New Era, there will be a
multi-way power balance in the region; much like European politics at the
turn of the century.
 
 
> 7.  New Era : Is the "Dawn of the New Era" at 1200 or some other date?  Why
> this date (as opposed to sooner or later)?
 
No good reason; 1200 sounded like a good round number.  The Hivers (masters
of computer technology that they are) are hit hard, but manage to recover
quickly and develop "virus-proof" technology.  The Hivers back the expansion
of human states through what was once the Imperium and the Solomani
Confederation.
 
By the time of the New Era, the instability of the virus and the ability of
worlds to improvise solutions will make the virus something to be careful of,
but by no means the most threatening thing out there in interstellar space.

Dave estimates that it will take a couple of generations before the area that
once was the Imperium is economically back up to the pre-rebellion level.
However, by 1205, the Hiver-backed human ("Star Viking") states will be
"meeting in force" explorers from the Domain of Deneb.
 
 
> 9.  Does the Virus destroy all information storage devices?  Erase optical
> disks and holocrystals?  Even read-only ones?
 
This depends on the storyteller\'s needs.  While the virus may not be able to
erase media which are physically read only (as opposed to software read-only
which it can and probably does erase), it may very well be able to make sure
that there are no more working readers.
 
 
> 10. The Virus (Countermeasures) : Does the Virus "die" when you turn off its
> computer?  Erase its memory and storage devices?  Destroy the computer?
 
The virus doesn\'t normally die when you turn off the computer.  Using it\'s
chip re-wiring capability, the Virus will ordinarily have hard-wrired itself
into the computer.  For the same reason, wiping all of the memory and storage
devices will not always kill it.  Physically destroying the computer (smashing
it to bits, or frying it with an electromagnetic pulse) will certainly kill
the virus.
 
 
> 11. The Virus (Abilities) : Is the Virus psionic?  Can the Virus be detected
> by a psi ("detect life", for example)?
 
Dave\'s initial reaction was a flat "No, the Virus is not Psionic".  However,
on reflection, he speculated that if it were to become aware of the
possibility (for example, by infecting a computer used to gether psionic
research data at a psionic institute), it might figure out how to become 
psionic in a limited way (send and recieve thoughts, for example).
 
Similarly, a psionic adept would not automatically be able to automatically
detect a virus in any computer.  However, the psi would be able to pick up
some sort of pattern, and with some experience, it would not be too hard for
him or her to learn to identify Virus-infected computers.

Well, it doesn\'t have to.  Again, this is a decision that the storyteller
will have to make.  In some cases, the Virus may well decide to nuke the
planet, crash into the main water desalinization plant, or blow up a city\'s
power reactor.  On the other hand, it is also possible that a Vampire ship
would decide to leave the planet alone, or even land and talk to the
inhabitants.

"Glad you asked!"  Dave knows that there were "far too few casualties" 
generated by Hard Times.  Looking at Diaspora, he was tempted to change
the numbers across the board, but it "felt funny to go through and kill
people".
 
One of the biggest problems with megacasualties is making these numbers
impact on the player characters.  How do you communicate the fact that
billions of people have died, without reducing everything to emotionless
numbers?
 
 
> 14. The Virus (Effects) : How many people die (related to question 13)?
 
"A lot more".  Most worlds are knocked down to Industrial or even
Pre-Industrial tech levels, and the Four Horsemen will ride until the
population is reduced to what is sustainable at this level.
 
Many worlds (even high-population worlds), and particularly those on worlds
with vacuum, very thin, exotic, corrosive, or insidous atmospheres, will
die.  Everybody.
 
In addition, the virus may (if the storyteller so decides) go and kill
people.  Nuke cities, blast holes in environmental domes, and that sort of
thing.  Worlds that are depopulated 90% or more are possible.
 
 
> [Pubilcation]
 
The folio format adventures have been unprofitable (I believe "bleeding
money" was the phrase used), primarily because of the high cost of the 6
pages of color, as compared to the relatively low selling price for something
which has only 16 or 32 pages of adventure material.  So the folio format
will be dropped, in favor of the larger book format (like the sourcebooks for
MegaTraveller).
 
Adventures generally only sell the initial print run.  Once it\'s no longer
new, people don\'t tend to buy it.  Sourcebooks, background material, is
different, and seems to have more lasting value.  So for the New Era, the
idea will be to include adventure material in the sourcebooks, and not to
publish separate adventures.
 
Current plans for Traveller: The New Era is to sell modues which are books of
approximately 96 to 120 pages.  New Era books are expected to be about 1/2 to
2/3 background or sourcebook type material, and the balance will be composed
of adventures "loosely" related to the sourcebook data.  The idea is not to
outline a whole campaign of interlocking adventures, but to provide a number
of different stories which the referee can incorporate into ongoing games, or
use as-is.  Each of these adventure ideas should be relatively short (less
than 16 pages) and more-or-less independent of one another.

The following are my comments (originally mailed to GDW via Loren) to the
T:TNE character generation draft.  I\'m posting them here in the hopes that
they will stimulate some discussion here on TML.

- ----
First of all, a general comment: I would like to see a "design your own"
character generation system, as well as a random one.  This is particularly
useful for the Referee, when generating a "Character NPC", or when preparing
for a campaign based on a particular theme (such as all of the PCs being
active-duty Navy personnel).  In these cases, the Referee typically has a
specific end in mind, and would like a character generation system which gets
the character there with a minimum of fuss and bother (and re-generating the
character because it doesn\'t come out right).


The character generation system as presented seems to be the equivalent of
"basic" character generation.  Will there be a detailed "advanced" (year by
year) version?  I find the detailed character generation to be superior for
player characters; I make a "resume" that records all of the assignments and
outcomes.  Then this information can be related to events in the background
history, to more firmly tie the character into the background.  

One other thing I have done is to note a "contact" for each year.  This is an
NPC that was particularly important to the PC in some way or another; it
could be his or her first commanding officer, a co-worker, or subordinate;
and this person could be kindly or unkindly disposed towards the PC.  At
character generation time, we would determine who this person was, his or
her name, and their disposition towards the PC (I used the reaction table
for this last).

Later in the campaign (typically at unexpected times) these people might show
up.  Someone\'s old Academy room-mate (with whom he never did get along) would
just happen to be the commanding officer of the customs inspection ship.  Or
the engineer who trained the PC in jump-drive operations happens to be the
supervisor of the shipyard where they have come for repairs.  Or whatever.

This part is confusing.  I was under the impression that the rules were going
to be as background-neutral as they could be.  This is a nice bit of "color",
but it doesn\'t seem to fit in with anything else.

Is this part of the background information for the New Era?  I\'m not trying
to be a pain here, but this doesn\'t make sense.  I thought that the New Era
was supposed to start around 1200 Imperial; any player character alive at
this time would have grandparents or great-grandparents who were survived the
Rebellion, Hard Times, and the Virus.

To put it in modern perspective, do school-age children today believe in the
Great Depress and World War II?  My father in law talks to his grandkids (my
children) about Pearl Harbor and the Second World War; do most (or even many)
people say that it "must have happened generations earlier" or "could never
have happened"?  Grandpa probably still has his father\'s (or his, depending
on how old Grandpa is) old Imperial Interstellar Scout Service dress uniform
cap (or belt buckle, or cufflinks, or whatever).  My "Uncle" George still has
is WWII Army uniform cap, his Purple Heart, and snapshots of his buddies.
When I was younger, he told me about serving in the Pacific.

My point is that even if all computers, books, and other records from prior
to seventy years ago were destroyed by the virus; all the PCs have to do is
ask *anyone* old enough (80 years or so) and they will get about the same
story.  In the New Era times, the Imperium is still recent enough to be a
part of the living oral history on many worlds.  In another hundred years or 
so, it will have passed into folklore, and will probably have been 
embellished or altered to near unrecognisability.


SEVERITY: NIT
>  Roll two six-sided dice and subtract one 

Why the long drawn-out text explanation here?  I can understand this the
first or second time die rolls are called for, but each and every time?  What
about providing a section (and listing it in the table of contents!) that
explains all of the terms used in the game (like "2d6-1", "DM+1", etc.).
Using specific abbreviations like this makes the rolls easier to pick out of
the text.  Using the text version makes the rules harder to *use*, and
doesn\'t appreciably add to the difficulty for a first-time player.

I should note that you use the term "DM" without defining it first.


SEVERITY: MINOR
>  Homeworld Effects On Attributes

As mentioned by Scott "2G" Kellogg, a -1 AGL for large homeworlds doesn\'t
make any sense.  Perhaps just a +1 STR (no modification to AGL) is in
order here?

If this is an attempt at play-balancing, I suggest you reconsider the 
modifiers for homeworld population, TL, and law level, so that all of
them are "balanced".

Personally, I would prefer not to worry about "balancing" characters in this
manner; as long as the modifications are kept reasonably small (ie: +/- 1),
the difference is relatively minor, and anyway: some places are simply better
than others to grow up in.

Another good source of skills that characters might be able to learn before

other skills these kids learn.


SEVERITY: MINOR
> ((Diplomacy, Bureaucracy, Barbarian, and Corsair) have ranks but no "O"
> ranks, and so no roll for obtaining a commission is ever made.

A couple of things here.  Why don\'t Barbarians and Corsairs have officer 
ranks?  Particularly aboard a starship (even a pirate starship) there will
be clear distinctions of rank and clear lines of authority.  In these two
professions, rising up through the ranks is probably easier than for the
more formal military services (on the other hand, the chances of surviving
long enough should be smaller ...).  However, these rank increases would not
cause the automatic social level increases that happen for other careers.

I\'d argue that the Diplomacy service should have ranks, but no *ENLISTED*
ranks (on the other hand, enlistment should be difficult, and promotion
even more so).

Finally, for Bureaucracy, why aren\'t there any Officer ranks?  Here in 
Washington, DC (home of one of the largest bureaucracies I know of), the
"enlisted" civil servants (ha!) are the GS (Government Service) pay scale.
The "officers" are on the ES (Executive Service) and SES (Senior Executive
Service) scales.  Bureucrat "Officers" typically retire and become lobbyists,
or to positions of importance in private industry.  Perhaps instead of a
gold watch, these folks should get "contacts" as mustering-out benefits.
These "contacts" would be previous co-workers (or previous subordinates) that
either owe the character a favor, or who are favorably disposed towards the
character.


SEVERITY: MINOR

I think anybody in the medical profession will disagree (strongly!) with your
table of "ranks" and with the above rule.  You may want to re-think this
whole thing.  It is extremely rare for someone to start a career in Nursing
as a step towards becoming a Medical Doctor.

Perhaps a better technique would be to have several "colleges" and "schools",
similar to the concept used in High Guard (for College, Naval Academy, Flight
School, and Medical School).


SEVERITY: MINOR
> Homeworld Limitations: Certain skills are not available on the character\'s
> homeworld. 

This actually applies to homeworld selection as well.  This area is very
campaign dependent.  For example, an Imperial Marine (Classic Imperium) will 
probably learn Battle Dress and Fusion Rifle skills even if he comes from a
TL-5 world.  On the other hand, in some campaigns certain entire careers will
be impossible (for example, an Interstellar Scout Service in a "Bootstraps"
campaign), and some skills will be unavailable no matter how well the player
rolls.

Similarly, in a "Bootstraps" campaign, only one homeworld is available; but
in a "Pocket Empire" setting, there may be a half a dozen or more (and if a
Classic Imperium suppliment is ever written, there will be over 11,000
possible homeworlds).

Instead of putting the homeworld selection and the homeworld restrictions in
the character generation rules; I would suggest splitting this material out
into a sidebar or two.  Discuss homeworld selection (and how the Referee will
need to decide what homeworlds are available) in one sidebar, and on a later
page, discuss how the homeworld and the type of campaign being run will
affect skill availability.


SEVERITY: WEIRD

This is silly.  If it\'s a problem with your word-processor, you should
get it fixed!  On the other hand, if this is an attempt at "protecting" the
text, it\'s rather futile (inspection will determine what the words should
be; all it does is serve to frustrate the reader).


SEVERITY: MAJOR
>    We need a system for shared ownership of starships, particularly in the
> case of merchant characters ...

Again, this is *extremely* campaign-dependent.  In a "bootstraps" campaign,
starship benefits (and starship careers, for that matter) should be
completely unavailable.  In a "pocket empire" campaign, the degree of ship
ownership allowed will depend greatly on what the referee wants to do.

From your descriptions of a pocket empire, there shouldn\'t be any surplus
scoutships available as mustering out benefits at all.  It\'s more than a
little contradictory to explain that there aren\'t enough starships to do even
limited (subsector-scale) exploration, and then hand the players a "surplus"
starship (co-operatively owned or not)!  After all, if the service had ships 
to spare, they\'d be using them!

Specific Suggestions:

* Write a sidebar explaining how the different kinds of campaigns affect the
services available for enlistment, and how it affects the mustering out
benefits available.

* Write a separate sidebar for inclusion in the referee\'s section of the
background information explaining the campaign options available in the New
Era.  Something a lot like you described to me over the phone, so that the
referee can choose something amenable to his and his players\' tastes.  

* While you\'re at it, another sidebar which gives suggestions for >NON New
Era< campaigns is a good idea.  Just touch on some of the classic SF-RPG
themes, and suggest that the referee could build his own campaign universe
around any of these.  Ones that are particularly suitable to Traveller: The
New Era include the "Ancient and Decadent Star Empire", "Free the Galaxy!",
"Boldly Go ...", "Cold War", and of course, many others.

Shares (sidebar): In some campaigns, the outright ownership of a starship is
a practical impossibility: starships are too rare and valuable to be owned by
any one person, and bank financing is unavailable.  In such campaigns, a
system of shares may be used, each representing 1/100th of the ownership of
the vessel.  The shares are commonly owned by governments, industries, and
individuals; if the player characters can accumulate a bloc of approximately
20 shares, they will probably control more shares than any other single
shareholder.  This (in addition to having the skills required to run the
ship) will give them a great deal of say in how the ship is used (but not
absolute: the referee, playing the other shareholders, may ocassionally make
demands on the players).

In other campaigns, outright ownership of starships is possible, and bank
financing of their purchase is common.  In such a system, a 40-year note 
(with the starship as collateral) is usual, and merchant starships are
normally purchased this way.  In this case, each share represents 6 months
worth of payments.  If the players somehow accumulate 80 shares, the starship
is paid off (and the players own it free and clear).  Note that this
financing is not available for scoutships, seekers, and corsairs.

Shares are always used for the ownership of seekers and corsairs, because
the purchase of these ships cannot normally be financed.  In this case, the
other shareholders are usually the other crewmembers, and backers of the
referee\'s creation.

Scoutships recieved as a mustering out benefit are never owned by the player
characters; shares and bank notes do not apply.  In some campaigns, large
numbers of obsolete scoutships are made available to retired scouts.  In
other campaigns (where no such ships are available) the service, at the
referee\'s discretion, may provide a ship to a retiring scout for a particular
purpose (such as the exploration of a specific area, or to search for
something or someone).

* Scout/Courier: In campaigns where starships are plentiful, the Scout
Service frequently loans surplus Scout/Courier ships to retired personnel. 
The service retains ownership, and the ships are subject to recall in an
emergency.  In campaigns where starships are less plentiful, no surplus ships
are available, except at the referee\'s discretion (and frequently only for a
specific purpose).

* Seeker: If the belter has ever made a strike (see the career description),
recipt of this benefit indicates that the belter owns a seeker (a
prospector\'s starship) free and clear (in other words, 100 shares).  If the
belter has never made a strike, then each recpit of this benefit represents
2d6 shares in such a ship.

* Corsair: Each recpit of this benefits results in 2d6 shares. (If rank for
corsairs is implemented, use the same method for allocating shares as
merchants, below).  Corsairs should not be available in campaigns where
starships are rare.  However, if starships are common enough that scoutships
and lab ships can be given as benefits, then corsairs are a very real
possibility.  Remember, the individual referee has the ultimate veto power.

* Merchant, Safari, or Lab Ship: Each recipt of this benefit results in a
number of shares, depending on the rank of the character.  Enlisted ranks
recieve 1d6 shares; Officers recive 2d6+(rank number) shares (in other words,
an O1 recieves 2d6+1 shares, while an O5 recieves 2d6+5).

So, starship crewman hired from a HighSteller world are paid more than those 
hired from a EarlyStellar world?  Even on the same ship?  This rule makes
sense for some occupations, but not for others.  Maybe a better way to do
this would be to build the starting money into the mustering out tables (as
in Classic Traveller and MegaTraveller), or to provide different rules for
different services.  While each world may pay it\'s Navy at different rates, I
doubt that a Pocket Empire\'s Navy will pay crewmembers from different worlds
at different rates.

Personally, I suggest chucking this part altogether.  If you want players to
have more starting money, change the mustering out tables, or pay a fixed
rate for each rank each term.  This could be indicated on the rank tables,
and for some services (like Medical) could be modified by the homeworld TL.

That sounds good.


SEVERITY: MAJOR
> TNE SKILL LIST

* There does not seem to be any replacement for the "Inborn" skills; since
characters get skill points for their hobbies, it would seem that some hobby
type skills are needed.  What about Art (Sculpture, Painting), Writing,
Music (Composition or an Instrument), or Dance?

* Why is a distinction made between Biology and Xeno-Biology, but not between
medicine practiced on humans versus aliens?  (and for that matter, why don\'t
Biology and Xeno-Biology don\'t at least allow application of some of the
skill to the other field?)

* The science of Geology seems to be having an identity crisis with the
Prospecting skill.  Perhaps these should be two, complimentary skills;
geology has a much broader scope than simply prospecting.

* Engineering lists "Construction" (presumably you mean Civil Engineering,
which concerns itself with bridges, buildings, roads, dams, and the like),
Mining, and Combat Engineering.  What about Mechanical, Electrical,
Electronic, Computer, Aerospace, and Naval Engineering?  And before someone
asks, no:  mechanical engineering is not the same as mechanical technical
skill.  Mechanical engineering concerns itself with the design of mechanical
objects, everything from paperclips to the landing legs of starships.  The
mechanical technical skill concerns itself with the fabrication, repair, and
maintainance of mechanical objects.  I suggest that you add some of these
subject areas to engineering and/or science.

* Similarly, the science cluster is at least as notable for what is not 
included as for what is there.  What about astrophysics, computer science (I
notice that robotics is there, but not computer science?), psychology (and,
I presume, xeno-psychology), oceanography, and mathematics?

* Medicine has Diagnosis, Trauma Aid, and Surgery.  Don\'t you think that
doctors should have non-surgical treatment options?  If nothing else, a
generic "Treatment" skill (representing all forms of non-surgical treatment)
seems appropriate.  A better idea would be to have a couple of these, like
Pharmacology (the treatment of disease with drugs), Therapy (treatment of
disease through non-drug methods).

* I suggest that for engineering and science (and possibly other skills, such
as medicine), that a list of a half-dozen or more disciplines be provided as
a suggestion, with the players and referees encouraged to create their own.

* In addition, or as an alternative, I suggest the creation of a "Knowledge"
skill category.  This skill represents the knowledge of some set of
information (which is defined by the player and referee when the skill is
recieved).  This allows the players to extend the skill system in ways that
interest them.  For example, a player could choose Knowledge: Imperial
History and Legend if she wanted to be particularly expert in the fragments
of history which have survived to the New Era.  A different example would be
for a human doctor character to have the Surgery skill, and a Knowledge:
Aslan Physiology in order to practice his skill on a different species
("Dammit, Jim!  I\'m a doctor, not a bricklayer!", and of course, see the
scene with Kirk, Bones, and the dying Klingon leader in ST:VI).

* The Artisan cluster is confusing: Why the distinction between jeweler and
metallurgy, but no mention of weaving, glassmaking, or woodcarving?


Overall, I think it\'s a good first cut.  Most of the things I mentioned were
minor, and none of them is a "showstopper".  It is aparrent that more thought
needs to be given to the skill list ---- it seems as if the skill list is in
mid-transformation from the very combat/survival oriented T2K into something
which attempts to provide skills for every human endeavour.

Well, we\'ve got enough information about TNE character generation to write

As far as I know that ship design rules are not yet released so we cannot have

the ideas the TNE ship design group put forward (most of them at least).  When

Hi,

	Two things I\'d like to mention to Mr. Nilsen (Wildstar, you want
to relay this to him?):

|   Once trade is cut off, the internal economy of the Hi-pop world
| collapses, and the staples that they can produce are no longer uniformly
| distributed, because the society can no longer pay the money for the
| goods that need to internally circulate to keep the economy up and
| running. When the economy falls, social services fail, and things fall
| apart. I see this as being one of the major effects of Hard Times, with
| one additional causal input: the Hi-pop worlds were the targets of major
| military campaigns, and suffered tremendous physical damage on top of
| everything else. This accelerated their collapse, even ones with good
| biospheres, because carrying capacity set up under one set of social
| assumptions is not necessarily stable.

	I agree with your comments about the intricacy of economic
interdependencies; one thing I\'ve been wondering about this whole
virus-induced collapse (I\'ve been following the discussion of it,
although not contributing to it) is why it\'s necessary.  If you want
to stage a "long night", it\'s much more easily done and more
believable if you make it economically induced.  I dug up one of my
favorite SF novels the other day; Paul F. Wilson\'s _An Enemy of the
State_, which has as a main plotline a deliberately induced economic
collapse as an effective means of revolution.  Have you considered
this approach?

	The large, bulk freighters make sense to me, particularly if some
thought is applied to the shipping system and traveller jump capabilities.
I came up with a concept I call "jump boxcars" which would handle such major
shipping between heavily populated, high-tech worlds.  Jump boxcars are
essentially that - large boxes that make the jump between hi-pop, hi-tech
systems.  They are efficient to use in such circumstances because of the
arrangement of power source and jump engine they use.

	To make a jump, a vehicle needs, essentially, five "big" things:

	a lanthanum-gridded hull
	a computer
	a jump drive
	a power plant
	fuel

	Starships are inefficient because they must "pull their own
weight (mass)" - particularly the mass of their fuel.  As an added
burden, they carry the mass of the power plant which processes the
fuel, and the computer and avionics systems that calculate the jump.
As jump functions in Traveller, the fuel tanks and possibly the power
plant could disappear just a microsecond before the jump without
affecting the jump (as is shown by L-hyd drop tanks in standard
traveller usage).

	The idea behind a jump boxcar is to make an extremely large
lanthanum-gridded hull, with a jump drive sufficient to move it.  The
rest of the normal accoutrements of a starship can be left off,
although a small life support system for emergency use may be
desirable (optimal designs would probably have a 100 or 200 ton
"rider" ship for crew quarters and emergency transport).

	The maneuver drives can be left off; non-jump tugships would
bring the boxcar in-system and out.

	The computer and avionics can be replaced by a receiving array
that plugs directly into the jump drives (after suitble encryption
schemes); an extremely powerful computer at a space station can handle
the calculations, correcting for time lag.

	The fuel and power plant can be replaced by a similar but
sturdier receiving array that plugs directly into the jump drives; the
same space station (or another, better placed for refueling) can
refine fuel from a nearby gas giant, process it, convert it to energy,
and transmit the energy to the jump boxcar via a high-intensity maser.
Depending upon the technology, this mazer may even serve to carry the
jump calculations, but a secondary receiver would probably be used for
redundancy.

	Even if placing the power plant and computer systems at remote
sites proves to be unfeasible, simply substituting the power mazer for
the fuel tanks would greatly increase the cargo efficiency (and jump
range) of the ship.

	The only problem wth jump boxcars is that they rely on an
extremely hefty support network - which means that interstellar trade
relies even more heavily on the stability of interstellar society.  [I
would suggest that few, if any, boxcars carry passengers.  The small
"rider" ship that the crew can use to return from a misjump would not
be sufficient safeguard for your average passenger.  This explains the
higher cost of high and medium passages, and the existence of "normal"
starship passenger lines.]

Imperium and wiping out the pockets of resistance inside their
sphere.  One such pocket was in Gushemege:  The Loeskalth, a minor
human race presented some difficulty for the fledgling first
Imperium.  They had absorbed a great deal of Vilani technology and
had a minor subsector-wide Empire themselves.  The Loeskalth had
managed to obtain a great deal of advanced technolgy.  Their own
efforts had managed to build themselves up to tech level 8, the
influx of trade brought them items up to tech level 10.  In
studying Vilani trade items, the Loeskalth adopted the High Vilani
language.
     The marriage of Loeskalth and Vilani technologies bred for
interesting vessels.  Their control systems, life support systems,
and sensors are of sophisticated origin (TL 10), while their
drives, hulls and weapon systems are of tech level 9.  These last,
the Vilani kept to themselves, providing the technical edge needed
to keep themselves atop their budding Imperium.
     It is interesting to note that even handicapped with this
hodgepodge technology, the warlike Loeskalth managed to hold off
the numerically and technologically superior (TL 11) Vilani for
much more than the ten years needed to complete the Asteroid ship

Notes:    The Loeskalth Rift Crosser was built around a large
asteroid which had been used as a Class A orbital Starport for many
years.  She was spun to simulate gravity with a period of
approximately 1 rotation every 2 minutes.

Layout:   The asteroid the rift crosser was built on is huge:  10
kilometers by 8 kilometers by 7.5 kilometers.  She spins on her
axis producing 1G along her 3750 meter radius.  The fuel is carried
in the zero-G center of the ship, while the fuel purification
plants are carried out in the 4000 meter radius parts of the ship
where the centripetal acceleration is 1.06G\'s.  This small increase
in centripetal acceleration assists in the separation of gasses at
cryogenic temperatures.
     The ship is honeycombed with launch tubes and access shafts
which connect with different modules.  There are over a thousand
very large launch tubes, some of which are capable of handling
10,000 ton ships.  However, the launch tubes are open to space and
do not hold atmosphere.
     The center of the ship, aft of the fuel tanks, holds a
complete shipyard with a capacity handling of 4.2 million aggregate
tons in pressurized zero-G docks.
     (I found that it would be impossible to fuel the ship for the
needed 300 years with grav plates.  The sections in Fate of the Sky
Raiders which describe the plates is considered to be in error. 
However, the adventure describes areas that are in zero-G.  These
sections are within the regions closer to the axis of rotation. 
The entire ship is habitable and has inertial compensators
installed except for the fuel tanks, the launch tubes and the docks
for the 10,000 ton riders.  The shipyards are fully pressurized and
have inertial compensators.)
     (I assume that the adventurers in \'Fate of the Sky Raiders\'
never found the tanker squadron or the other 10,000 ton ships
because they are in the zero-G section of the ship, and didn\'t poke
too far inside that section.)

Cost:     The asteroid ship is built in modular sections.  Each
launch tube of the same size is identical, each weapon battery is
laid out identically, power plants, life support etc.  These
modules were reproduced many times allowing for the cost of
construction to be reduced by 80%.  Thus, while the ship was the
first and only one of its class, it is sistership to itself.  She
was produced at a cost of 4.08 quadrillion credits.  When the
number of persons carried by the ship (2.8 billion) is considered,
the cost per passenger of the ship to the Loeskalth refugees was
1.46 MCr per person.  (By TCS rules this ship would require the
wartime tax money of 55 trillion people.)

Fueling:  Topping off the fuel tanks require 23 days of constant
action for the full complement of ships if they are ocean dipping. 
It would take 5 months of constant action if all ships are gas
giant skimming.  If only the tankers are used, it requires 29 days
from an ocean, or 9 months from a gas giant.
     Before crossing the rift, the Asteroid was fueled up with
water.  Water, having a greater molar density of hydrogen than pure
liquid hydrogen, allowed for the enormous endurance required by the
crossing of the rift.  By using water as fuel, the ship\'s endurance
was increased by 57%.

Controls: Many of the Loeskalth ships use banks and banks of model
four computers to control them.  The computer technology of even
Imperial time is unequal to controlling the asteroid, and with the
Loeskalth technology, huge numbers are required.  If the asteroid
were to use a normal control system, it would require a Model 13
computer to handle all the controls.

Damage:   The ship was damaged in a mutiny 5000 years ago during
which time, most of the power plant has been off line. 
Approximately 8% of the ship is currently habitable.  It is
estimated that at the current rate of consumption, the ship will
run out of fuel in 500 years.  (Dur=5516 years @ 28.8 Terrawatts)

However, given the ferocity of the Vilani-Loeskalth war that drove

left the sector.  The same ships were reactivated before the ship
reached the far end of the rift in Reft Sector allowing the Sky
Raiders 45 years to explore the area before the main ship arrived.

The original adventures were by The Keith Brothers.  All the above
is a reworking (or working as they published no designs) of their

Yep.  Did you read the sequel? (_Vang:  The Battlemaster_) a lot more about
it\'s history comes out in that one.  Oh, and another one,  _The Starhammer_
has some Vang in it too, although they are peripheral to the story.

  The major piece missing from the TNE draft character generation was which
skills go with each career.  This shouldn\'t be a big problem.  Old hands
can wing it.  There is a trick to it though.  You have to remember that TNE
is planned to be a `House Rules\' game.  So a quick look at TW2K or Dark Con
can give some insight on how this should work.
  In TW2K, the first term in a career is handled differently from later terms.
In the first term, the skills you receive are defined.  For example, an
atmospheric pilot will receive in her first term, pilot-3, navagation-1,
observation-1.  For the remaining terms in that career, there is a set of 
skills that the character may choose from.  
  An character generation program may have two options.  One for designing a
character and one for randomly generated characters.  Using the first option,
the program should prompt the user at the second+ term(s) with a list of
possible skills and how many skill levels the character take at that term.
The second option would simply randomly select skills from the list.
  Changing careers includes changing branches inside the military.  For 
example, switching from Army Infantry to Army Support.  TW2K doesn\'t have the
`downward sliding skill level increase\' rule that the draft TNE character
generation rules does.  Hopefully that downward counter would get reset at
a branch change and not just at full career changes (Navy to Merchants).

  He he he he he (<-Nasty Metlay Laugh) Nobody have *tried* to use psionics
against him for a long time, not since he crashed the inferior copies made by
his children.

  It would be trivial to install overrides that would prevent anyone from
using it against him or against beings, installations or areas that he has
\'protected\'.

  (The timeline I\'m thinking of is: 
    Grandfather builds psicom. 
    Grandfather is attacked by Children. 
    Grandfather installs \'Jedgars\', boobytraps and inhibitors in psicom.
    Some Children get weeded out by the boodytraps.
    The other Children build their own psicom\'s.
    Grandfather wins.
    Grandfather smashes all other psicoms.
    Grandfather retires.
    Grandfather returns, finds Chirpers and installs \'Casting procedures\'
      in psicom.)

  This might also be one of the reasons why he was so successful in 
exterminating all Children(1): He had a computer that could read all minds in
a large area of space.

  (1) Not that I think he got all of them, there are probably one or two left:
      But I think that without something like psicom, he would have missed five
      to ten of them.

> So if

  I think there are several examples of things that he have left behind
that wern\'t deactivated. Since the boobytraps and the inhibitors are still
there, nobody is going to use it against him, and he has shown that if
something neither is a threat nor interesting to him he will ignore it.

  Bah, Grampsian propaganda! :)

  _The Real Story of the Rise of Grandfather_ is ofcourse this: In the 
beginning the Droyne were a more or less normal race. They had their funny 
sexes, but the \'Casts\' were sociological constructs, not hardcoded 
biologically.
  Like the official story says, he was a mutation, but the only effect that
had was his high intelligence and that he didn\'t age. After learning everything
he could he decided that he wanted to explore the universe, and to do that he
needed all the resources the Droyne could muster. The \'takeover\' that was 
mentioned was far more bloody than what is normally suggested: We are talking
about the original \'Mad Scientist Conquers The World\' scenario here.
  To keep the Droyne on the carpet hereafter, Grandfather subjected them to a
breeding/genetic manipulation experiment that created the biological Casts and
reduced the \'drive\' of the Droyne in general. Originally, Casting was done 
through drugs that Grandfather controlled. The choise of the Droyne was either
to become biologically locked into place as a cog of society or become semi-
intelligent Chirpers, \'Castless\'.
  After a while, Grandfather noticed that several worlds (he had discovered
spaceflight) full of Droyne working according to his designs wasn\'t enough,
so he created the Children (and the Grandchildren). And then he realized that
the Children etc, wasn\'t enough so he started working on Vargrs, Humans,
other races and robots.
  Psionics was originally a user interface: His installations would read his
mind (sensing electrical patterns) and report by inducing electrical patterns.
When he then hit the TL where he could make non-corporal computers that could
interact with the real world (there are several ways of doing this, putting
them in jumpspace is the simplest. cf Greg Bears \'Eternity\' for other versions)
it was not a big step for him to construct psicom. Making it general was
not totally intentional: He wanted the Droyne, Humans and Vargr under his
command to use some simpler features, so psicom was designed to scan everybody
it could reach and activate on certain key phrases (passwords for you computer
literates out there:)
  My basic idea about psicom is that it is a network of small nodes, each one
covering a certain area. If a node isn\'t bounded on all sides by other nodes,
it will create a copy of itself to fill out the empty area. There is no
telling how far it has spread by now (1116:).

So, why build it usable by others at all?  I doubt he would make the
mistake of not realizing it COULD be used by others if he built it that

Since it is given that he could count, why should we assume he
miscounted and didn\'t get them all?  My own question on that subject

The examples of things left behind by him are contradictory.  We are
told that the most able mind in the Universe was incapable of cleaning
up loose ends?  Makes no sense.

  That question was answered in \'The Real Story\'.

  In Traveller (as in all other rpg\'s and is much of the sf/fantasy litterature
too) a box designed to do \'foo\' commonly only does \'foo\', nothing more and
nothing less. If somebody later wants to do \'bar\' too, they make a \'bar\'-box
that does \'bar\', nothing more and nothing less. And if \'foo\' isn\'t needed 
anymore the \'foo\'-box will be immediately removed.

  Things does not work that way in the real world. They have unintended 
effects, they have to be combined to be totally effecive, they build on other 
things that are there already, and they are commonly not removed unless there
is something to gain from removing them.
  I don\'t think this is human behaviour, I think it is much more general: 
A spieces that don\'t do anything that have even one unintended effect, do
nothing that it totally effective, build everything from scratch, and spend
huge efforts to remove everything that is obsolete or not needed is perhaps 
possible, but it will never get above TL0.

> Since it is given that he could count, why should we assume he
> miscounted and didn\'t get them all?

  That\'s disingenious. I can think of several methods, like cloning, 
downloading of personality profiles, pocket universes etc complicated by
not being activated until kiloyears afterwards and so on.

  I\'ve always interpreted the comment that he had ventured forth several
times to \'complete the destruction of any industrial basis that had survived\'
as indicating either that he didn\'t find the last Children until well after
the \'official end of the war\' or that he was afraid of genetic records/
personality profiles just waiting to be activated, and thus attacked the 
remaining technology.

> The examples of things left behind by him are contradictory.  We are

  We have the two loose ends in that Gas giant, and the loose end in deep
space in the Regina subsector, the one on Regina itself, and the loose end on
Vland, and the loose end on Lair...

  The common factors I see in all these is that they are neither threats nor
do they call his attention.

> And please get this off here and onto the TML where it belongs...:-) 
 
  Don\'t tempt me:)

  If you by \'us\' mean Vargr, Aslan, Hivers, K\'kree, Prt\', Brin, Phins,
Bwaps, Vilani, Solomani, Zhodani and so on, then, yes, I assume that
normal means like us:)

  The trouble with Droyne is that there is no Droyne psycology beyond what
is dictated by the casts(1). I\'ve looked in the Droyne Alien Module, I\'ve 
talked to TML\'ers who have played Droyne and I\'ve read several adventures
involving Droyne, and nowhere is there a sign of any Droyne psycology.

  In absence of any psycology apart from the casts, people tend to let them
behave like humans, plus the cast, and this is obviously wrong since they
isn\'t humans. But the alternative seems to be to let them behave like 
casted clones.

  Note that I don\'t question the existance of a species of casted clones, I
don\'t even question the existance of a sentinent race of casted clones 
(although I think it is unlikely), but I do question that they would develop 
to more than low TL0. (2)

  My suggested explanation is that the pre-grandfather Droyne had casts, but
that those casts were social constructs and not biologically determined.
What Grandfather did when he had the technology to do so was to turn these
social constructs into biological determinism, probably through breeding
programs and genetic manipulation.
  The reason for this was that he wanted to cement his position as supreme
dictator-for-life over the Droyne. Originally, before the war, he probably
controlled the casting through chemicals since his psicom required a very
high TL.
  [Rather nasty setup: either the Droyne would become semi-intelligent
chirpers or they would become casted clones working for the glory of
Grandfather]
  Unfortunately, by removing their psycology he also removed the qualities
that he needed in assistants, which is why he started on children and
grandchildren, and Vargr, and Humans and whatever.

  After the war and Grandfathers withdrawal all Droyne became chirpers
(naturally) until he ventured forth and found all there chirpes colonies
scattered all over charted space.
  For some unknown reason, \'conscience\' is right out considering his previous
actions against the Droyne, he installed functions in psicom to handle the
casting and instituted the sport-class to replace himself.

> 				----Steve

(1) Except for the sports, of course, but they seem to be a post-war 
    development.

(2) According to the sources, the Droyne were far above TL0 when Grandfather
    appeared.

Sorry for being so late, the mail node here was under repairs.

In reply to Phil Pugliese & Mark Watson:

I agree that english (or any other language) might or might not be the
"main" language in Galanglic, that any language might become the "lingua
franca", just as french used to be, obviously, the old lingua franca. :)

My point was that Anglic should be dropped completely for Galanglic.
This way you can play the game in any language. :)
I like to play using different "real" languages instead of making up
fake \'klingon-dictionary\' ones...
For example, my Zhodanis talk a mix of arab (well, the few words I know)
and german.  The Vargr speak a mix of spanish and italian, the darrians
a bit of latin and greek, and we use french as Galanglic...

Anyways, as I (tried) to say in my original posting, I don\'t think this is
really important... I just thought it was a little barrier to the
internationalisation of the game...  In France instead of playing Traveller
they play "Empire Galactique", which is a form of streamlined, closed-system
traveller.  I\'m sure a lot of people would climb up to Traveller if it
was accessible. :)

About NASA\'s technology, well currently I don\'t think it\'s so hot. :)
But considering the economic troubles of all of Eurasia (except Germany)
I think it has a fair chance to come back to the lead.	Of course we can\'t
really \'rate\' one country\'s space technology, since most space programmes
are done with the help of many other countries.  Canada\'s lead in
robotics and artificial imaging wouldn\'t be so great if it wasn\'t involved
in NASA\'s and ESA\'s projects.   Anyways, I digress. :)

About Nobles: People claiming nobility and LOCAL monarchies sounds logical
to me... Just that the Emperor\'s list and Imperial Nobility would lose a
lot of credibility and be dissasembled. This would affect the definition of
Social Standing, giving it more of a local effect instead of one globalized
all over the galaxy...	It would make sense for people from planets with
Feudal governments to become nobles while others would gain a high SS
simply from their great riches, local rep or other.

Fa should be the Federation of Arden.  You are right on Cs and Na
(client-state and non-aligned, respectively).  I\'m not sure, but isn\'t
Dr for the Darrian Confedration?

Possibly.  Or possibly not.

It would be really cool, but pretty predictable, too.  It would also be
really cool if he were exactly what Strephon said he is, a refugee boy
that Strephon adopted.

If Avery is Strephon\'s clone, then it should become obvious as he grows
older.  If not, his future is a lot more open ---- you can actually do
more things with the character if he\'s *not* Strephon\'s clone.

Finally, there is a lot to be said for not deciding which it is until
you actually write the adventure that uses that information.  I have it
on very good authority that "The Real Strephon" was (in the minds of the
people who wrote him into the Rebellion era) "supposed" to "really" be a
robot (designed by a certain well travelled and knighted roboticist,
with similar capabilities to another well travelled and knighted robot).
But it was never *said* what the "Real Strephon" was until it became
important to an adventure plotline.  Arrival Vengeance pretty clearly
establishes that the "Real Strephon" is the real Strephon, but is
compatible with all of the other published information on the "Real
Strephon" to date.  Although it does leave one loose end ---- if the
"Real" emporer was out travelling, why were the Emperess and the Grand
Princess left behind?  (And for that matter, what was a clone doing
holding court and conducting diplomacy?).  Oh, well ---- you can\'t have
everything.

Right on the last three. \'Fa\' simply means \'Federation of Arden\'.

It seems obvious that he is, but I don\'t see what practical value
that can ever have. After all, there does not appear to ba any
way to distinguish between the clone of an emperor and the clone
of a clone of that emperor.

In Classic Traveller noble ranks _were_ local planetary ones which I\'ve
always thought made much more sense. In my private system Imperial
barons clock in at SL 24 (with the Emperor a SL 30).

That\'s the Federation of Arden. As I recall, it\'s described in the Spinward

it was established as a buffer between the Zhodanis and the Imperium after

I\'m getting around to setting up a science fiction trading game, and it 
looks like Mega Traveller has just about the most complete set of ship
design rules available.  However, I recall from trying to design a 
couple of ships when the rules first came out that they were pretty
buggy.  Has anyone produced a complete set of erratta for MT ship design?

Does anyone has suggestions or recommendations on ship designing?

Thirdly...I\'m actually putting a mixture of games systems together to
get what I want and there are some things it the MT ship design system that
I\'m not sure I want to include.  Has anybody ever experimented with
modifying the system?

Any help would be appreciated!

  <Fa> is the Federation of Arden.  There is also some 
  inconsistencies in the allegiance data in MegaTraveller - some 
  sources have the Sword Worlds split up into the Sword Worlds 
  Confederation <Sw>, near the Darrians, and the Sword Worlds Union 
  <SW> near the Domain of Deneb <Im> or <Dd>.  Other sources seem 
  to refer to the Sword Worlds Union as the Border Worlds <Bw>, and 
  there is the inconsistency of using <Im> vs. <Dd> for Domain of 
  Deneb in some sources.

First, I want to thank everybody for helping me out on that
allegiance code question. I guess I must have slept through the
5th frontier war or something.

Anyway, I\'m continuing to mull over the sunbane data on the
spinward marches despite my limited knowledge concerning the
region\'s recent history, and (at the risk of getting into a
really long discussion) I have to admit that I keep thinking the
same thing over and over: "There\'s something wrong here." What
I\'m talking about is UWP\'s (formerly UPP\'s) which don\'t make a
whole lot of sense to me. Sonthert/Lanth is a decent example of
what I mean.

Here we have a couple million folks making a living with their
19th century technology, and look what they have to breathe: a
very thin (and tainted) atmosphere. For all intents and purposes,
a vacuum. I know... I know... they can get by with combination
respirators/filtermasks, right? All couple million of them? With
technology which is over a century old? I can just see it now.
"Don\'t go outside, son. Yer might have to breathe or somethin\'."
Hey, at least TAS had the sense to classify it as a red zone
(don\'t go there if you\'re addicted to oxygen).

Okay, all kidding aside, the thing that gets me about planets
like this is that anybody decided to colonize them in the first
place. Agreed, with a bit of technology, people can survive just
about anywhere they want to survive, but why bother? I see a nice
dirtball only five parsecs trailing.

Now this is sweet. We\'re talking primo-atmosphere (none of that
chewable Los Angeles gunk). And lo and behold, who shows up to
catch the view? A whopping seventy people. We have more folks on
the TML than this. Yes... I know... the planet is corporate
owned, but who really cares? Why waste a virtual paradise (at
least compared to that other place) on seventy stinking corporate
losers (or maybe corporate winners in this case). Ah, yes... I
can see some cool scenarios... the corporate paradise. The wooing
ground for potential investors. Perhaps it\'s just one big golf
course. You tee-off from orbit.

But the fact is, this would never happen. When the place gets
colonized way back when, people are gonna zoom in on this little
speck of rock like nothing you\'ve ever seen, and any corporation
that wants it is gonna have to pay through the nose (and a few
other choice orifices) to get it.

My point: this situation shouldn\'t happen. It goes not only
against intuition and common sense, it goes against the principle
of greed, the fundamental root of human nature (yes, I\'m down on
humanity, but that\'s not the point here). The point is that this
rule system is... flawed, no other way to put it. (I can see
several people shaking their heads and saying "you mean you just
figured this out?") Hey, I\'ve always been a big believer in
classic traveller, and the spinward marches are about as classic
as you can get. But the point stands, there\'s something rotten in
the Lanth subsector, and it mostly likely extends from the whole
set of rules on UWP generation.

Let\'s take a closer look. What\'s going on in the rules to produce
these sort of unwelcome results? I think one of the problems is
real obvious. Just take a look at the order in which UWP stats
are being generated.

1. Starport       5. Population
2. World Size     6. Government
3. Atmosphere     7. Law Level
4. Hydrographics  8. Technology

The first thing wrong with this is actually the very first thing
we see. Why are we generating the starport first? Shouldn\'t starport
be determined by traffic, and shouldn\'t traffic be determined by
population? Hence, let\'s move starport after population (not in
the UWP listing, but in the order of stat generation).

Now (making this one change) let\'s start looking at cause and
effect in the rules.

The Stat        What modifies it
/----\\        /----\\
1. Size         (nil)
2. Atmosphere   (Size)
3. Hydro        (Size, Atmosphere)
4. Population   (nil)
5. Starport     (nil)
6. Government   (nil)
7. Law Level    (nil)
8. Technology   (everything but law level)

Now this is cute. Again, I always was a big believer in the
classic rules (maybe because I wanted to crawl in a hole when MT
came out), but let\'s take a look here. Specifically, let\'s look
at population. The rules would have us believe that you take any
given system, and regardless of its features, the primary world
or asteroid belt in one system is just as likely to have X amount
of people as the primary world or asteroid belt in the other
system. This, my friends, is way way out of line.

Think about it. You roll up some dinky little ice-ball as the
main world in your star system and then you try telling me that
the fact that this tiny speck of crud has no atmosphere, that it
has no liquid water, and that it hasn\'t even a modicum (I like
the word) of elbow room.... and then you try telling me it\'s just
as likely to have 50 billion people on board as that garden
terra-prime paradise just a couple of parsecs down the road. I
don\'t think so. Yes... you can explain it away. You can say, "Oh,
there\'s this wonderful lanthanum mine." Or you can say. "These
people live here... because it\'s their home" (and then smile
convincingly). But it doesn\'t work. This isn\'t a little
inconsistency. This is whopping big one. It\'s gigantic. It\'s
glaring. It\'s pesky and annoying (like me), but most of all, it\'s
just plain stupid.

Time for Jim\'s 1st Law on main-world generation (hey, if Newton
can do it, why not me?): Given that everything else is more or
less equal, people will tend to migrate to the place that is
"nicer". What I\'m saying is that worlds with a nice atmosphere,
some actual water, and so forth are gonna attract large
populations which will in turn build nice jumbo starports.
Planets that aren\'t so nice (you know the ones I\'m talking
about)... those planets will not attract people, and hence, they
aren\'t very likely to have lots of traffic or nice starports.
Jim\'s 2nd Law is likewise easy to grasp: People will attain the
resources (technology) that they need to survive such that those
resources are available. I.e., if you\'re really sure that you\'re
going to live on Sonthert, then you\'re gonna work damn hard to
acquire the technology you need to survive. TL3 doesn\'t cut it on
a near-vacuum planet. You need a little bit more (And I\'ve never
bought into the philosophy of high and low tech worlds living
side by side. For a short duration such as a few decades, I can
see it. Given special poltical or social circumstances, I can see
it. But in general, over the course of centuries, eventually
there will either be a leveling process or the low TL regions
will be brought up to snuff... and this is exactly what\'s
happening on our world).

Okay... now since I try not bitch about something unless I\'m
willing to work to fix it, here\'s my proposed modified-rules on
main world generation (if this begins to look like pseudo-code,
it\'s probably because it is).

1. World Size. Roll 2d6-2.

2. Atmosphere. Roll 2d6-7+Size.
   if size=0 then atmosphere=0.
   confine range to 0-F.

3. Hydrographics. Roll 2d6-7+Size.
   if atmosphere is 1 or less, then DM -4
   if size is 1 or less, then Hydro=0
   if atmosphere is A-C then DM -4
   if atmosphere is E then DM -2
   confine range to 0-A

4. Population. Roll 2d6-2.
   if size is 2 or less, DM -1
   if atmosphere is 3 or less, DM -3
   if atmosphere is A, DM -2
   if atmosphere is B, DM -3
   if atmosphere is C, DM -4
   if atmosphere if greater than C, DM -2
   if atmosphere is 6, DM +3
   if atmosphere is 5 or 8, DM +1
   if hydro=0 and atmos>3, DM -2
   confine range to 0-A

5. Starport. Roll 2d6 (use whichever table suits the locality
                       but remember that high rolls result in
                       a lower quality starport).
   if pop=0 then starport=X
   if pop=1, DM +2
   if pop=2, DM +1
   if pop is 6-9, then DM -1
   if pop is A, then DM -2
   confine range to A-X

6. Government. Roll 2d6-7+population.
   if pop=0 then gov=0
   confine range to 0-F

7. Law Level. Roll 2d6-7+government.
   if gov=0 then law=0
   confine lower bound of range to 0

8. Tech Level. Roll d6. Modify as per the standard chart.
   if pop=0 then tech=0
   otherwise, if hydro is 0 or A and pop is at least 6,
                 then tech must at least be 4.
              if atmos is 4, 7 or 9,
                 then tech must at least be 5.
              if atmos is 3 or less or A-C,
                 then tech must at least be 7.
              if atmos is D or E and hydro is A,
                 then tech must at least be 7.
   confine lower bound of range to 0

There, that wasn\'t so bad. I think you folks (at least those who
are interested) should be able to make sense of all of this. I\'m
throwing down some example UWP\'s to show you what sort of worlds
this modified system tends to create.

X9A8000-0    X120000-0    B457867-6    B2518CD-B    A631453-F

Note that there are some conspicuous differences between this
data and "normal" UWP listings. We get quite a few uninhabited or
very low-population star systems under the modified rules. Not so
under the original rules. I haven\'t checked yet, but I suspect
that this will probably bring down the average starport rating
for any given region (which is fine with me). Further, we don\'t
see lots of low-tech star systems. The lowest I see here is TL4,
and in both cases, we\'ve got a breathable atmosphere attached to
each planet (no assistance required, hence no technology required
in order to breathe). As we\'d expect, the yucky-foo worlds tend
to have lower populations and seedier starports. I\'m a bit
surprised that we have quite a few lush (atmos=6) worlds with
under ten million inhabitants. On other runs, I usually see very
high populations clustered on those worlds. Of course, when we
look at the highest population world in this run, we see that it
has a standard atmosphere, just as we\'d expect, so all in all,
it\'s not giving us really strange results on that count.

Now what I\'d like to do with this modified rule-set is get some
comments and criticism from you folks. Even though the TML
comprises a *very* small corner of the internet, it also has some
of the most devoted Traveller players I\'ve ever laid electronic
eyes on. So tell me... what do you think about the modified
rules? What problems do you see? What needs fixing?

I\'d like to "perfect" the program before distributing it, but if
you\'d like a copy for "experimental purposes", I can email the
QB45 source and/or the MS-DOS executable. What I\'m really looking
for here are suggestions. Do you like the modified system? Do ya
hate it? What about it needs improving? Probably a lot! From
reading this mailing-list in the past, I know that there is
*never* going to be a consensus on the TML regarding something
this broad-based and as fundamental to the rules of Traveller.
That\'s okay with me. I\'m not trying to please everyone (or even
the majority). I\'m just trying to get some ideas and a fair
critique (and what better place than the TML?).

Thanks for tuning in. Now back to the regularly scheduled
program.

"SOLAR SAILING: Bored billionaires should aim for the stars"

(c) The Economist, February 6th 1993
used without permission.


Very rich people spend their money in strange ways. Many of them are happy
to lash out a few million dollars, or even a fair bit more, on racing new-
fangled versions of old-fashioned boats. In doing so, they hark back to an
age of commerce won from the salt-breath of the sea, of man pitted against
the elements and his fellow man. They seem to think they get value for 
money. Today yacht racing is as popular as it was in the era of the clipper.
but if the super-rich really yearn for greatness, they should have their
hearts set on the dreams of the next century rather than the last.

Around the world, there are various designs for odd, unseaworthy craft made
mostly of plastic film and aluminum. They are almost too fragile to look at.
But in orbit, they could be the new clippers. Solar sails can speed space 
ships on their way by reflecting the light of the sun--an idea as bewitching,
clean and sweet as the line of the fairest schooner. Solar sailing ships
could eventually become the clippers of space, carrying cargoes from world 
to world. And they could be raced. Indeed, that is what the first solar sails
are designed to do (see page 87).

Calling the captain

Such a race might help redress one of the great ironies of technological his-
tory. Space flight--a dream inspiring enough to tough the hearts of even those
who scorn the most romantic notions--has been entrusted to vast, soulless 
bureaucracies. These agencies contain some valiant dreamers; but, as in all
bureaucracies, they are vastly out numbered by time-servers and Bugginses, whose
greatest achievement has been to make mankind\'s greatest achievement look dull.

If you want the opposite of dull bureaucrats, the best types to look for are
those who are making money in an entrepreneurial way--or sitting on stacks of
money from their fathers\' exploits. Not all rich people are devil-may-care
adventurers. But some are, and some of them race yachts or fly hot-air balloons.
Now they have the chance to fly their own spacecraft. Orbital regattas would 
allow them to to compete with the newest of technologies in the grandest of 
arenas. Although this would be pricey--a first-generation solar-sail racer will
cost about $5m, and perhaps twice as much to launch--it is not out of the price
range affordable by many run-of-the-mill plutocrats, let alone the world\'s 200
or so billionaires.

It must be admitted that unmanned solar sails controlled from earth do not offer
quite the visceral thrills of salt spray and a fresh wind on the open sea, but 
they offer some of the same rewards: a small crew driven toward a single goal.
The racers would stare at computer screens, not portholes--but then so do most 
of the people who win many of today\'s big events, not least the men and women
who design and monitor the boats that compete for the ultimate bauble, the
America\'s Cup.

Those who do not like frittering their money away can look at space sailing in 
a different light. Despite the bureaucrats, the solar system may one day open up
commercial opportunities--asteroid mines for rare metals, perhaps. Those who
know space, who have developed a feel for the needs of a spacecraft\'s crew and 
designer, who have savoured the freedom of free-falling orbits, even if only
vicariously, will be the ones ready to seize that opportunity, or even to forge
it. They will not be quite the first: space has already made a few men rich. And
one of those rich men, who earned his money through satellite broadcasting, is
also one of the world\'s keenest sailors: a natural to set the race off, and pay
for a good part of it. So which stout hearts and thick wallets will be ready to
compete for the Ted Turner Trophy, first step on the way to the Asteroid\'s Cup?

Who here has seen the film "The Boys From Brazil", in which Dr. Josef
Mengele (Gregory Peck) tries to grow clones of Hitler?  The catch is that
in order for them to grow up as clone Fuehrers, their lives must be made
similar to that of the original.  The implication here is that unless
someone goes to a lot of trouble to give Avery a good Imperial upbringing,
i.e. identical to Strephon\'s, then all he will turn out to be is someone
looking exactly like Strephon, meaning you can *still* do the same things
with the character as if he\'s not Strephon\'s clone - but you can do a few
other things as well, e.g. what happens if he finds out he is Strephon\'s
clone?

Marital problems?  Or maybe that isn\'t the real Prince Charles we\'ve been
looking at over here lately?

Yes you can, if you leave a clone behind to do the work while you go on
holiday.  Then you come back and do some work, and the clone goes on
holiday.  The Imperium gets an Emperor on the throne every day of the
year, who is not over-stressed because he never gets any rest.

One major factor -- local sun type. Looking through the stuff in

Without some major fudging World Builder\'s HB gives sub-zero equatorial

    Let me offer an alternative for Sonthert.  Like many other worlds during
the Long Night, Sonthert was cut off from the Imperium mainstream.  As an
underground colony, isolated from the rest of the subsector it\'s inhabitants
lost much of their knowledge regarding their technology.  The atmosphere
generators continued to provide the underground habitations with adequate
oxygen, and the colonists also found several variety of fungi that produced
small amounts of gases that were breathable and began using them to supplement
the atmosphere generators.  As time progressed, the society grew more
structured along the lines of 19th century England (Earth).  Although the
starport at Sonthert has been reestablished, the general populace retain the
societal views developed during the long night.

JV> Okay, all kidding aside, the thing that gets me about planets like

Why colonize a planet with a difficult environment?  Why look for gold or oil

when the colony was set up or it might have been a strategic point to occupy.

I disagree.  Greed would be precisely why both might be the way they are. 
However, I lean far more toward space opera than hard sci-fi when I\'m running
FRP/SFRPs.  However, there might be other factors as to why there are only 70
people on La\'Belle.  How about the only safe area in this paradise will house
about 70 people?  I look upon the current system as the engine that makes me
use my imagination, to try to reason why an otherwise inhospitable world would
be colonized.  However, that\'s my viewpoint and nobody else\'s.  <grin>

Nah, I\'d say the little ice ball was the spiritual center of a culture and all
the populace lives ship board packed around the little ice ball either in
space stations or some other technological marvel that masks the true nature
of the ice ball (it\'s actually a size A world with one hell of a spacial
distortion <grin>).  :-)  Of course, if it\'s pesky and annoying to you, you
always have the option of changing the UWP.  After all, when was the last time
the IISS came through here?

OK, so perhaps the show Space Rangers isn\'t the greatest show to hit
the airwaves in years but it is about the closest thing I\'ve seen
recently to "role-playing" like live-action SF and it is on
prime-time network television -- a party of space adventurers on a
frontier outpost fighting hostile aliens, etc. treating money and
equipment as a factor.  I\'m not here to debate the merits or flaws of
the show.  It had both.  What I would like to do is encourage anyone
who liked the show -- even a little -- to think about responding to
the following call for letter writing...

[Note, send any flames for this post to morrow@remus.rutgers.edu.
 Sorry to take up this space but I feel kind of strongly about
 supporting television SF in general and this show in particular.]

Sadly (to some!), CBS put Space Rangers on indefinite hiatus.

If you\'d like to try and convince CBS otherwise, write to:

CBS Audience Services      Attn: Ray Faiola

If you prefer to call, try CBS Program Information at: (212) 975-3247
This number will be answered as "Program Info".  State you want CBS to bring
Space Rangers back from hiatus, and make CERTAIN they log your call.

The general number for CBS is (212) 975-4321, and you can ask for Audience

On Jim\'s Modified Generation System:

One possibility to consider for worlds with Tainted atmospheres is that there
is a native "minor" race; this species is very likeley to not notice the taint
(in fact, it might be beneficial to them).  If this is the case, there should
be no negative DM for thin tainted, standard tainted, and dense tainted
atmospheres, and no TL minimum.

The other thing I noticed was the negative starport DM on worlds with
very small populations.  This should be generally true, but exceptions
do exist ---- the resort world with nearly no permanent residents but a
Class A or B port; the mining outpost with a few thousands of
inhabitants and a very high traffic level.

All in all, nice work.  The world generation is one thing that has a
good chance of being changed in T:TNE; so it is possible that this will
be imprpoved for the next incarnation of Traveller.


On Avery:

If Avery is Strephon\'s clone (and even if he is not) he is likeley to be
raised in Archduke Norris\' household; subject to what is most likeley
the same sort of environment as any "normal" future archduke.  This is
probably very similar to the environment in which Strephon was raised.

By "becoming pretty obvious as he grows older" I was referring to the
physical resemblance, not intellectual/emotional.  It should be pretty
obvious if Avery is the spitting image of the Last Emperor of the
Third Imperium ...

In this article I\'m addressing points made with respect to the
modified system for UWP (main world) generation which I presented
in the previous night\'s mailing. In the first segment, I am
replying to Arthur Green, who feels that the local sun type should
also be considered when determining main world features,
particularly population. In the second segment, I am answering
Chuck McKnight, who views the bizarre results which are generated
by the unmodified system to be an indispensible source of
inspiration for his soft-science approach to the game.

Hmm... I wasn\'t aware of this, but I\'ll toss out my thought for whatever
they\'re worth (probably not much). Type M stars are the cool-red
variety. Even a main sequence (size V) example puts out considerably
less radiation than the "average" star. It\'s so low that for an M0-V,
the habitable zone is roughly 30 gigameters distant (or orbit 0
according to the traveller rules). When you start dimming the star
down to M5-V or even M9-V, the habitable zone falls ever further
closer to the star (well within this imaginary "orbit 0" established
in book six of the classic rules). Now the question really is, how
much faith can we put in this "orbit 0"? Thinking like a humanities
major, I see no reason why a planet shouldn\'t be able to get as
close to its star as it wants to (barring the vaporization distance,
which isn\'t going to be very lengthy in this case).

You\'ve got to remember that "orbit 0" is a figment of somebody\'s
imagination. There are no rail-road tracks out there in space
dictating where a planet must orbit. Orbit numbers are a convenience
instated by the rules. Nothing more.

Even if you argue that they are based on astronomical observations
(the ratio of orbital distances and so forth), you still have to
realize that these observations have been taken from one star
system, ours, and that we haven\'t yet had a chance to verify the
theory with data on other star systems. So, in short, I don\'t
really think the problem is with the sector data so much as it
is with the system design rules... i.e., the extended system
design rules maybe shouldn\'t have relied to stringently to these
artifical orbit numbers.

> How about including some sort of -x here for "unsuitable" sun type?
> Actually a negative DM for mean planetary temperature would be better.

Now having said that, I have to address this question, and to
be honest, it\'s one I\'d rather not address simply for the fact
that I\'d prefer not to have to deal with extended system design
(basis system design is enough of a can of worms all by itself,
thank you). Agreed, the barrier between the basic and extended
systems is also artifical, and if you want to do things right,
you should always consider the star\'s size and spectral type
before proceeding to world generation. Nevertheless, how often
do your players want to know the spectral class of the star
in a particularly system? For my game at least, details like that
are largely irrelevant. To go a step further, how many of your
players know astronomy well enough that such an issue would
hinder their "suspension of disbelief" and thus their enjoyment
of the game? I haven\'t met a player yet who regarded star size
and spectral class as anything other than ignorable minutia.

In short, the modified system for UWP generation was meant to
fix something that is not ignorable. After that (the basic
system) is working, then at least we might have a solid enough
foundation to proceed into the particulars of the extended
system generation. But this is not the time to get into those
sorts of questions. Still, I appreciate your comments. I just
want to focus on this main problem for now.


** Section 2 **

To refresh the reader, Sonthert is a world of 30 million inhabitants.
They subsist with almost no atmosphere to speak of in a technological
state equivalent to the pre-indistrial era on Earth, circa 1800.
The questions are "why" and "how".

Okay. You\'re making one basic argument here: that Sonthert\'s situation
can be explained... that with some imagination, it can be rationalized,
and that in the process, we can come up with an interesting and distinctive
history and culture for the planet and its inhabitants. That\'s fine. I agree
with you.

However, in the process of making this argument, you\'ve completely
ignored mine. My argument was this: the system for UWP generation is
broken because it gives us unwelcome results with such alarming
consistency that it confounds the imagination to have to keep
coming up with new explanations and rationalizations on why such
and such a planet shouldn\'t exist but does. I think that having this
sort of world appear every once in a while is okay. But making it a
standard outcome of the system is only indicative of a broken system.

Take a second and think about it. True, we have lot of people working
the oil and minerals up in Alaska, but the system doesn\'t say anything
about oil and minerals. The unmodified/broken system says, if you
take a dinky, icy world (which happens to be the mainworld of a
star system), and you compare it against any other main world (even
the terra-prime worlds out there), the chances of the ice ball having
a higher population are 50%. In real life, if you take 1000 square
miles of alaska (or antartica, or sibera, or the sahara desert...
any place which is "inhospitable") and you compare it against 1000
square miles of any place which is hospitable, ask yourself, what
are the odds that the yuchy-foo place is going to have a higher
population than the garden paradise? My guess is that the odds are
well below 50%. Of course, that doesn\'t preclude it from ever
happening. The scenario you describe is still possible. All I\'m
trying to do is make the system more reflective of what we\'d
expect on average.

No, I\'m sure that a lot of other people share your view, but if you
prefer feeling like an extremist, why don\'t you just scratch the
die modifiers altogether? Why make any attempt to get the UWP to
conform with our expectations unless the attempt is a good and
reasonable one? I think our difference here may simply be one of
degree. You are happy enough with the unmodified system that the
work needed to change it and make it better acts as a sort of
inertia (which is probably the same reason I\'m still playing AD&D,
albeit largely modified). And please don\'t take this as a flame.
It\'s not meant as such. And I do agree with you, that the softer
the science in your game, the less desirable a reality-based system
for UWP generation becomes.

Again, it is pesky and annoying, and the unmodified system generates
too many of these pesky and annoying planets to modify by hand. A better
system is called for (IMHO). Either that, or we can chuck this so-called
hard-science/reality-based approach and start playing Star Trek.

Or maybe I should just look for another hole to bury myself in. :-)

For an excellent treatment of this question, look into ``Cyteen\'\', by
C.  J. Cherryh. It\'s one of her Union/Alliance novels. Here the limiting
factor is real live parenting - the clones (``azi\'\' in the book, which I
assume is a contraction of ``azygotic\'\', a zygote being the technical name
for the fusion of sperm and ovum before it starts dividing) are brought up
on ``tape\'\' (some form of learning and psychological conditioning in their
sleep), because real people choose not to take the time to be with the
child azi 24 hours a day. Thus they grow up rather insecure (generally
psychologically addicted to tape) and very focussed. There are definitely
shades of ``Brave New World\'\' in there too.

Also, it should be mentioned that the article in the Economist on solar
sailing was one of their leaders, which are somewhat whimsical at times.
The serious article in the Science and Technology section about solar
sailing was pretty good, though.

No, I like what you\'ve done so far.

I\'m not greatly involved in system/planet design but I may give you something
to help so...

Perhaps the problem lies in the fact that we\'ve only got one set of generation
rules that are trying to generate everything based on either too many
random variables or restricting ourselves to too few variations.

I can see that you\'ve got 4 things to contend with
  
    1.  What are the physical characteristics of the planet (iceball whatever).

    2.  What life/society has evolved on this planet without intervention
        by outside star fareing societies?

    3.  What space faring culture has interfaced with this planet/society
        and why?

    4.  How long have 1 and 2 been interacting and has the type of interaction
        changed regularly and how often?


Generate the planet as realisticly as you like.

Try generating items 2 and 3 separately and then merge them together to give
the final society entity.  Initial settings in one will effect settings in
the other and vice versa.  

If you factor in item 4 as a number of times to iterate through the
relationship routine (and the type of relationship can change) then I think
you can build reasonable worlds AND all of those weird no atmosphere high
population worlds AND JUSTIFY THEM in the actual design process.

Have a think about it, it\'s a lot of work but you read like you want
something this detailed.

It\'s sort of like a character generator for worlds

    - roll the stats            (generate the world), 
    - determine initial hobbies (generate local society),
    - determine professions     (generate external influences), and
    - generate skills           (iterate to determine changes).

1. Thankyou for posting the variant basic system. I agree with your basic 
principles, but I haven\'t had time to try it out for real.  I would 
certainly be interested in any changes you make to the system.

2. I like the \'basic system\' idea.  It is enough to start developing a 
world from, and allows for creativity and flexibility, plus providing 
inspiration for world detail in the first place.  If your system produces 
more reasonable results most of the time then this is fine by me: less 
hassle working out explanations for improbable results every 3rd system or 
whatever, as you suggest. 

3. I don\'t use extended system generation, so star type doesn\'t worry me.  
But maybe you could add generation of an appropriate stellar type to your 
system, purely as an extension for \'feel\', to go with gas giants, 
asteroids, bases etc.

a dim star.  There\'s something called tidal stress which is caused by the
difference in gravitational pull from the star on the close side of the planet

stress doesn\'t do more than puff up the ocean (which causes the ocean tides
you\'ve probably heard of). :-)  As an aside, the sun-earth tide is larger
than the moon-earth tide, or so I\'m told.

Anyway, if your planet is too close to its M5 V star, tidal stress will
overcome the gravitational binding and the planet will break up.  That\'s
why there\'s a minimum distance for stable orbits for planets.

For items which are not bound by gravity, e.g. a space ship, the minimum
orbit is MUCH smaller.

Hmm... this is an interesting idea. I guess the GM would have to decide
whether or not such races exist before making a final call on this one.
Since there are a variety of "taints", however, the race would be
virtually "locked" to their one "homeworld". Unless they were genetically
altered to survive there, I don\'t see how they might have come into
being. And you still have the obvious question, why would anybody
engineer a mutant race for a specific tainted atmosphere when there are
non-tainted atmospheres out there? I guess we could come up with all
sorts of rationalizations for this. But on average, it seems a bit
extreme to assume this.

Of course, there might be worlds that acquired some strange and lethal
virus (to about 99.9% of all standard humans). Then natural selection
could take care of this problem, and the race wouldn\'t be locked to
their homeworld.

I like the idea, but I also think that it\'s unrealistic to implement
it as a matter of course. Situations like this should be very rare.

When I was thinking of the starport modifiers, I was actually thinking
less in terms of traffic and more in terms of sheer humanpower
requirements. Take a class-A starport. You have starship construction
going on (by definition). How many people would that require? Could
you do it with 10? 100? Or would you need thousands of people? My
guess is toward the latter (but since I don\'t really know, comments
on this point are extremely welcome).

For a look at what I would call unrealistic, look at either of these
two worlds:

Pixie/Regina  A100103-D        Paya/Aramis  A655241-9

Even with high-technology, it should take quite a few people to
build a starship. Then you also have to consider all the other
tasks a class-A starport is generally capable of performing. Anybody
have any ideas on what the minimum number of people should be for
each starport type (just in terms of running the port)? We might
even need to cross-index this with tech level.

Broadly, I\'m in favour of a more sensible fix to world generation, and Jim\'s
system is pretty good. I think from earlier posts the Ag worlds round red
dwarfs problem has been recognised by GDW, and is regarded as an abherration
introduced in later Traveller. What they are going to do about it I don\'t
know - given that we are already stuck with the UPPs for several sectors and
the likely fix is to more strongly weight the star type/size based on the
mainworld we are in for a glut of F, G and K stars, I guess.
There were various variant solutions punted under classic trav ... a
couple from White Dwarf were:
- - increasing the space represented by a hex by a factor of ten (this from
Andy Slack\'s "Expanding Universe" series). The mainworld now represents
likely the most useful system, and probably the only explored one.
- - adding a Z axis for more worlds (from a Starbase column). The suggested
solution was +/- 10 hexes from the x/y axes.
Both these solutions should solve the skewed averages. The second adds the 3
dimensional aspect alot of people want but I would think it unlikely because
it would break the current sector maps, library data, etc. The other
advantage is of course to increase the role of the Scouts.

Couple of other points on worldgen, if anyone in GDW is watching:
- - one of the things which irritates me is the lack of modifiers on
subordinate worlds based on the tech level of the main world. The advanced
system generation rules are designed so that the mainworld need not be
generated first (however, if you take this approach you still need to
nominate the mainworld before generating the govt and law levels for
everyone else (I put this down to sloppy proofing). Whatever, in the
Imperium milieu it is more likely that the mainworld has been generated,
either by the ref or from an official sector chart. For the Imperium milieu
(note not necessarily for a 2300AD style game) the advanced generation
system should extend the basic one, not try to replace it ...

(interesting, btw, how the world generation affects and is affected by the
game background - I hope this is not regarded as a "generic" rule - either
the Imperium stuff will not work, or it is changed utterly, or a 2300AD
style game becomes impossible).

- - And, minor point, SpaceMaster includes a chart explaining what the different
star types mean (ie G is yellow, etc). I don\'t think this is a trade secret
and the non-astronomers can use it to add colour :-).

Finally, news for the UK readership - on one of my rare visits to central
London this week a visit to Virgin Games on Oxford Street revealed that they
are selling off a load of Classic Trav stuff, in mint condition, at sale
prices (ie between 2 and 3). Not the most sought after stuff - basically
book 6, supplement 2, a number of the adventures (including adv 13, Signal
GK, which might be regarded as useful background for TNE) and double
adventures, Alien Module 1 (Aslan) and volumes 2-4 of best of JTAS. Worth a
look though if one of these is missing from your collection (now if someone
can tell me where to get the K\'kree module in the UK, I\'ll be a happy man).

As I say, the stuff is mint, and is marked "Special Purchase" - no idea
where it came from. I\'ve also noticed a sudden reappearance of 2300AD
material in a number of stores, so maybe someone is freeing up old stock
from somewhere.

Keep on travellin\'

Actually, I haven\'t ignored your argument about the UWP system being broken. 
I approach the UWP generation system (hell, I approach most random generation
systems) as guidelines that I\'m free to modify if it suits me.  I don\'t view
the UWP as a sacred cow that must not be fiddled with, but more of a starting
point.  If I get a result that doesn\'t match what I\'m looking for, I change
it.  I will also mention that I don\'t mass generate sectors, preferring to
hand generate each system so I can be sure that I don\'t get anomalies.  But
that\'s my personal preference and I won\'t undertake to speak for anyone else. 
I\'m not denigrating your UWP mods, they\'re nift, they make sense, etc.  That\'s
your style of GMing and I support your efforts.  :-)

Personally, I suspect that if it isn\'t published in a GDW/TSG publication most
people don\'t use it at all.  :-)  Like I think I mentioned, the generation
system is merely a beginning if I\'m stuck for an idea.  Personally, I think a
game\'s \'reality\' is the one imposed and painted by the referee, but I\'m into
escapism in my gaming. :-)

Difference of approach, I think.  If I\'ve got to flesh out a world that my

or no.  However, you\'re entitled to your opinion and I agree that there are
things that need changing if you\'re mass generating sectors to make results
more uniform.  Of course, I\'ve never approached Traveller as a hard
science/reality based game.  ;-)

This is a really bizarre/amazing/wonderful idea. At first glance,
I was a bit taken aback by the amount of work it would require, but
I can envision how such a system could come together, providing
not only the UWP but a history to go with it (analogous to the
character history provided in advanced character generation).
This is really one of the fundamental differences (character
generation-wise) between Traveller and many of the other popular
RPGs. In others games, characters are created. In Traveller,
they evolve, giving them an entire career history before the
game even begins. Transfering this concept to world generation
is a great idea.

Still, I really don\'t want to go to all the work that this would
require. I\'d rather work within the structure of the
"official" basic mainworld generation system. However, if I
ever decide to create a new SF-RPG (heaven forbid), I\'d definitely
come back to this idea of yours and put some serious thought
to it.

Hmm... the question, of course, is how far do you go with the "feely"
additions? Since the sunbane-format for sector listings provides an
area to note the star type, I think your suggestion can be easily
accommodated. Go beyond this, however, and we run into problems
concerning compatibility with the existing sector and subsector
viewing programs already out there (the ones I\'m thinking of being
provided to us by Mark and Cynthia).

Also, as several TMLers have noted recently, star type does effect
the rest of planetary generation (yes, I\'m flip-flopping on my
rebuttal to Arthur Green who suggested that the combinations of M-V
stars and hospitable (even agricultural) worlds was not realistic). So
if we do add this data in for \'feel\', we should take care not to
make the same mistake as GDW. I.e., we should first generate star-type
according to known stellar frequency data and then generate the
mainworld, applying DMs to the UPP data as applicable (Arthur had
it right). This would probably make the "inhospitable" worlds even
more common than in the modified system I presented a few days ago.
That\'s fine with me if it\'s fine with you (though we can\'t know for
sure, it\'s probably closer to the true situation).

This is a good point. If you send me your suggested modifications,
I\'ll try \'em out on the program. Another TLMer mentioned via email
that he uses three different tables for determining the government
type of a world. Which one he uses depends on the world\'s population.
I don\'t know if this is going too far or not, but the best way to
find out is to try out the idea and see what sort of UWPs it results in.

I\'m sorry to disect your article down to this one sentence, but it\'s
the one I found most interesting, and I really wanted to focus on it
for my conclusion tonight.

One of the things that always impresses me about Traveller is that
despite the wealth of background material GDW/DGP/FASA/Gamelords/etc
has provided for the "official setting", there is still a great
degree of variation between game masters in terms of the "feel" of
the game, i.e. the hardness of the science, the extent of minor
alien races, the local politics, etc. Just talking with people over
the TML brings out some of these differences. Then there are the
people (the few, the proud :-) who have chucked the "official"
setting in favor of staking out some entirely new territory,
with a new history, new poltical figures, and in short, new standards
and assumptions. I feel that because of these reasons, it\'s going to
be impossible to build one world generation system which will satisfy
everyone. However, if we stay fairly close to the official system which
we all know and which most of us accept and just try to fix its more
obvious problems, then I\'ll be able to consider this whole thing a
success.

There\'s something known as the "Roche Limit". Anything closer than that that will be subject to tidal forces stronger than its own gravity. Which means that satellites *cannot* form inside the Roche Limit of the parent body. And if a body is somehow moved to an orbit inside the Roche limit, it has to have enough structural strength to resist the tidal force. And they increase with the *cube* of the distance as you approach the parent body.

Well, there actually *are a lot of limits on available orbits based solelyt on orbital dynamics. For instance, orbits with periods in a simple integer relationship to each other are unstable because the "tugs" they give each other reinforce.  Simple fractional realtionships (like 2/3, 4/5 etc) can do it too. This is why there are areas in the asteriod belt where there aren\'t any asteroids, they\'d have orbits synched with Jupiter this way. Ditto for Saturns rings, the gaps are caused by resonances with some of the satellites.

We have not just the planets orbiting the sun, but the asteroids and the various moons orbiting the planets. That\'s a *lot* of observational data.

If you\'re not adverse to going beyond the original six stats, there are
some additional variables which would be extremely useful to have.  As a
quick background, we have the three physical stats of the world, which
describe it in terms of:

Size (independent)
Atmosphere (dependent on size)
Hydroshpere (dependenty on size and atmosphere)

It would be nice to have two additional stats to use in later generation
of the world\'s characteristics:

Resources (independent) - an indicator of the available natural
  resources on the world.  A high value indicates extensive,
  high-quality, and/or readily exploitable resources (mineral, fossil, 
  vegetable, or animal - this is non-specific, except that it indicates
  the presence or abscence of resources which otherwise aren\'t shown
  in the UWP).  Throw 2d6-2 for Resources; DMs subject to Referee whim
  (for example, the Spinward Marches is known to be deficient in heavy
  elements; perhaps a DM of -1 to the whole Marches to reflect this?).
  Restrict the result to the range 0-F.

Life (dependent on atmosphere and hydrosphere) - A general index to the
  prevalance and variety of life on the world.  A low score would
  indicate a barren world (your average asteroid or iceball "there isn\'t
  enough life on this ice-cube to fill a space freighter!") while high
  numbers indicate a thriving and diverse biosystem ("There\'s something
  down there; massive life readings!").  Throw 2d6-2; DM-8 for Vacuum 
  Trace, or Insidious, -6 for Very Thin or Corrosive, -4 for Exotic, 
  -2 for Dense/High, Ellipsoid, or Thin/Low, No DM for Thin Tainted,
  Standard Tainted, or Dense Tainted, and +2 for Thin, Standard, or
  Dense.  Apply a Hydroshpere DM: -4 if 0, -2 if 1, No DM if 2 through
  5, +1 if 6-9, -1 if A.  Other DMs can be used too: a +1 for worlds 
  within the Ancients, First Imperium, or Rule of Man (old colonies or
  terraforming efforts).  If Stellar Types are being used, an additional
  DM for the suitability of the star might not be a bad idea.  Restrict
  to the range 0-F.

[Extra credit if you can identify the quotes]

The resources score can be used to justify settlements on otherwise
inhospitable worlds, and should server as a positive DM for population.
The ratinale is that there is *some* type of valuable resource present
(which doesn\'t otherwise show on the UWP), and therefore it is likeley
that someone has come (despite the hardship) to exploit it.

The Life score can be used to get a "feel" for the native biosphere, and
to gauge whether or not there is a native race to consider (throw Life
or less on 2d6 for a native sentient or semi-sentient race?).

For figuring out a world in the context of a long-standing interstellar
community, you can use Resources to represent the attractiveness of the
world to the "outside" starfaring cultures, while the Life score can be
used as a basis for determing if there is a "native" culture to interact
with.

As I understand it, this is the "Roche Limit", and could be looked up in
an astrophysics textbook.  Anybody out there want to provide some
serious numbers?

Huh?  I wasn\'t thinking about a geneered human (or other) race as
colonists, I was thinking of the naturally-evolved-on-that-world, native
inhabitants.  Even here on Earth, there are plenty of creatures which
have evolved to inhabit environments which would kill other creatures.

Simply because a world has a "tainted" atmosphere, there is no reason to
assume that life couldn\'t and didn\'t evolve on that world.  And there is
no reason to assume that this life couldn\'t evolve into sentience.

Such creatures may or may not be "locked" into their environment; this
depends on the specific adaptations the creature has made to the
environment, and on the environment itself.  Creatures which evolved on
a world with a relatively high concentration of sulfur dioxide in the
air may have a special body covering (hair, scales) that is resistant to
the effects of the acid rain, and lungs that happen to be immune to the
toxic effects of the "taint".  Such a being might survive quite
comfortably in a standard oxygen-nitrogen atomsphere (but may have to take
periodic baths in a mild acid in order to etch off the unwanted dead
skin coverings.

That all depends on how prevalent this "life" stuff is.  If life manages
to evolve on nearly any world capable of supporting it to any degree,
worlds with native sentient or semi-sentient races should be fairly
common, and worlds with some form of life should be pretty common.

On the other hand, some well-known writers have written a good chunk of
science-fiction having postulated that the only planet to achienve
sentient life was Earth.  This is, of course, an extreme viewpoint, but
it illustrates the wide variation possible.

For most Traveller use, a "native" intelligent minor race at least once
a subsector seems reasonable, and several per subsector seems more than
possible.

In the case of Pixie (I\'ve had to deal with this one, I have run quite a
few campaigns out of the Regina subsector), I\'ve taken the approach that
the world is essentually all naval base.  The only personnel ther (with
a handful of exceptions) are Navy personnel, their dependents, and
civillian contractors.  The shipyard facilities are all run by
transients ---- the entire population of the world is transient (and
therefore, there were only a handful of "inhabitants" when the world was
surveyed).  There are tens of thousands of people there, almost all of
whom will be gone in two to four years (to be replaces with a new
batch).  The civillian contractors there run shipyards, and aren\'t
adverse to doing work on non-navy contracts utilizing spare capacity
(thus the Class A rating).

I\'d say that the original system (which presumably generated both of
these) was prone to such problems.  Worlds like these *could* occurr,
but should be *much* more rare than the original system provides.  If I
had a choice, I\'d use your modified system and hand-modify the worlds
that I specifally wanted to be anomalous, rather than use the original
system and have to check each world for reasonableness.

Yeah, well... I will admit to mass-generating sectors, but I should also
add that I agree with you about it being really necessary not only to
tweak the data but also to expand (greatly) on that data (and I think
most people would agree with this). One of the things I always hated
about the sector books was that they didn\'t go into detail on the worlds
they overviewed (this, of course, is the GM\'s job). Still, I always
preferred books like the Pilot\'s Guide to the Drexilthar Subsector,
which attached a few paragraphs to each mainworld. So although I do
rely on computer generated UWPs, I also take them as just the starting
point. And I think this is the intention of the rules.

One of the things I hope to do after this discussion is concluded (if
it is ever concluded) is to go over the sector data for my Traveller
campaign (tweaking and re-generating as seems appropriate) and then
write down the world descriptions, put them together with a subsector
viewer, and finally make the whole package available over the net.
Writing up the world descriptions will probably be the longest phase,
but when it\'s done, I think it\'ll be worth it (especially for all the
"Harrison" readers who want to investigate the story\'s backdrop for
themselves).

Yeah, well, I think we can all testify to that. I, personally, can only
handle so much reality intruding upon my fantasy :-)

But seriously, when I refer to "reality" in a gaming or even a writing
context, what I\'m really referring to is "suspension of disbelief."
In other words, if the game is pretending to conform to something
approaching the reasonable or "reality-analogous" (i.e., starports
being analogous to airports or shipping ports, worlds being analogous
to countries, etc), then it should be careful not to diverge in a
way which would cause people to "disbelieve" or otherwise "fall out
of character." As an example, I don\'t know of any "world-class" shipyards
which are run by a handful of people (as could occur under traveller
rules).

Yeah... that\'s part of the beauty of all these RPGs. You can really
define your own approach. While I think many people would call Traveller
a hard-SF RPG (certainly harder-SF than many of its competitors), the
individual GM can shift the flavor of the campaign to whatever she or
he wants. As an example, I\'ve been told by one TMLer that the "Harrison
Chapters" depict a "dark empire" while Traveller depicts a benevolent
one. I agree with him. My campaign (indeed, my entire setting) had been
customized to fit my peculiar prejudices, and I imagine this sort of
thing is fairly commonplace (at least, I hope it is). My fear (with
respect to the modified system I introduced) is that by making all
those changes in the UWP generation system, I may be catering too much
to my own preconceptions and that I may end up with very "uniform" looking
world descriptions. After all, you need a little variety to make things
interesting. What I want to do is make things more "realistic" without
chopping out the "interesting."

Re: Trade Codes

Well, to advance the discussion into slightly new ground, I have
a few questions about the trade codes presented in the MT Ref\'s
Manual.

(Fl) Fluid
def: Non-water ocean(s).
reqs: size A+, atmos 1+

What does this mean? That only big worlds will have exotic
oceans? I suspect that there is a typo here: that the reqs should
read atmos A-C hydro 1+. Damn well near impossible to use the
MT material without that blasted errata sheet. Would somebody
please post the errata on the UWP (mainworld) generation?

(Ic) Ice-Capped
def: self-explanatory
reqs: atmos 0-1, hydro 1+

Maybe I\'m confused about the definition. I mean, earth is ice-
capped (last I checked), but we don\'t fit under the requirements
for this trade code. So what is the significance of a world being
ice-capped?

(In) Industrial
def: economy based on mass-production of manufactured goods.
reqs: atmos 2,3,4,7,9, pop 9+

I know this one goes back to classic traveller, but I\'ve always
had a problem with it. Considering the extent of robotics and
mechanized labor at high tech levels, I\'m not sure this high a
population requirement is really necessary. Furthermore,
considering the extent of (clean) fusion at advanced tech levels,
I\'m not sure that the atmospheres of such worlds would be so
heavily tainted (I guess they assume there are some negative
atmospheric by-products of mass production other than smog).

(Ri) Rich
def: your guess is as good as mine
reqs: atmos 6,8, pop 6-8, gov 4-9

So in other worlds, if a corporation suddenly takes over a rich
world, then that world is no longer a rich world. Makes
absolutely no sense to me. Maybe the governmental requirement
should be axed.

Now onward to that other topic.... grrrr...

Re: Star types

I really hate to open up this can of worms, but since several
people on the TML have argued that it\'s sort of important, we
might as well get on with it.

I\'ve been comparing the star-system generation rules of
MegaTraveller, GURPS Space, and Space Master, particularly as
concerns the generation of star types. One thing I don\'t like
about the MegaTraveller system is that by going with the
mechanics alone, you will never generate type O/B or size Ia/Ib
stars (under book 6 of classic traveller you can get everything
but type O, I\'m not sure why they changed it... probably in order
to conform more closely with observed stellar frequencies.
Interestingly, they kept the book six tables concerning habitable
zones, so the only information missing is that on type O stars).
The rules even admit this and advise the ref to just sprinkle
them in as an after-thought. Blech!

It is interesting to note that Space Master (unlike Traveller and
GURPS), includes two other spectral classes (S and N), which are
placed below M (dim red) on the classification scheme. Actually,
to the best of my understanding, there are 10 spectral classes:
O, B, A, F, G, K, M, R, N, and S. They originated out of Ann
Cannon\'s work at Harvard (who originally used all the letters
between A and S). Later studies cut the spectral classes down to
these ten letters (of which Traveller mentions only the first
seven). Are there any astronomer types out there who can tell us
more about these final three spectral types and/or give us some
local-area frequency probabilities for each of the spectral
types?

Another interesting thing about Space Master is that it ignores
the dwarf stars (size VI), so in one way it seems to be more
complete that Traveller, and in another way it seems to be less
complete. I wish I knew what the designers were thinking.

Regarding Orbit #\'s, I\'m still partial the way GURPS handles
this: by using Bode\'s law to figure out orbital distances. Still,
it\'s not hard to tell that even this section and most of the rest
of GURPS Space (when it comes to world-generation) seems to be
deliberately cognizant of Classic Traveller, its forerunner.
Since this isn\'t rec.games.frp.advocacy, however, I\'d better can
the discussion of the other games right here.

My basic quip about the Traveller rules (with respect to this
topic) is that by relying so heavily on a d6 scheme of things,
GDW seems to be ignoring several important star types and is
probably fudging on the probabilities of those stellar
occurrences which are covered in the rules. Fixing this problem,
even with the help of the TML-astronomers is probably going to be
a hairy ordeal. To compound our difficulties, once we have a
"good" generation table for the primary, we will still need one
for secondary and tertiary stars. I have it on decent authority
that the *majority* of star systems out there have one or more
companion stars to their primary. However, when we look at the MT
or even book 6 rules, we see that Traveller is assuming that the
majority of stars systems are solos. After this problem is fixed,
we\'ll need to create habitable zone information for stars of type
O, R, N, and S for inclusion into the orbital zone tables. And
even then our problems won\'t be anywhere near finished (because
we\'ll need some method of finding out whether or not the
habitable zone is occupied and if it is, is this indeed the
mainworld?). Like I said before, this is a huge can of worms,
particularly when done by committee, which is the only way I can
think of doing it since I\'m pretty much ignorant about a lot of
this stuff. One last time... are you sure you really want to get
into all this?

Well, I just checked the MegaTraveller errata on sunbane (for those
who don\'t already know, sunbane.engrg.uwo.ca has MT errata in the
pub/traveller/misc directory under the filenames MT1 & MT2). Anyway,
there\'s nothing worth reporting as concerns basic mainworld
generation. In other words, there\'s nothing "official" saying that
the requirements for attainment of a "Fluid" trade classification
are tilted to the left (as I suspect they probably are). I guess
we\'re going to have to figure this one for ourselves.

If anybody has any other errata concerning mainworld generation,
please post it.

I *really* like these two stats you\'ve proposed. My only concern is
where to put them in the subsector listings such that the current
subsector viewers won\'t get fouled-up by them. But that shouldn\'t
be too hard. Anyway, we should definitely add them to the scheme of
things (of course, this\'ll mean changing the requirements on some
of the trade classifications... Rich worlds can now be rich for a
good reason :-)

Yeah, I\'ll admit to being one of those not-so-well-known writers who
(at least up until now) has stuck to this extreme viewpoint, that the
only sentience out there has either evolved on Earth or already
destroyed itself. But I should clarify how this extreme supposition
came about, because it is not one to which I hold dearly. On the
contrary, I think it\'s ludicrous to make such a statement. I think
that with the probabilities being what they are, that it is *extremely*
likely (even a certainty) that extra-terrestrial sentience has evolved.

However, I\'ve always been conscious of Fermi\'s old question: "Where
are they?" This, combined with the Travelleresque genre of science
fiction, where a vast region of space is human-dominated and where
exploration is still a serious undertaking, has created a
situation where it becomes extremely difficult to justify the
setting unless we make some very strong (and very unreasonable)
suppositions.

What I mean is that if there are sentient races out there, it stands
to reason that many of them would have taken to the stars *long*
before humans had ever stood upright. Thus, is stands to reason that
any of them that survived would be so far ahead of us in technology
(unless there is a technology ceiling fairly close ahead) that they
would probably appear to us more as gods than as living beings. Since
such "creatures" do not exist in the traveller setting, we have to
go back and reverse our initial supposition, effectively nuking all
non-earth-evolved sentience, making the natural advent of sentience a
rarity of the utmost magnitude. However, Traveller is only a game, and
whether such "creatures" exist in our "real-life" setting has been
left (for whatever reason) as a puzzling exercise for the earth-bound
reader. :-)

The errata are available from an FTP site or mail-server near you.  You are
correct in guessing that it should be "size n/a, atmos A+, hydro 1+."  I am
not entirely certain why atmospheres D-F have non-water oceans, but they
do....

"Ice-capped" here means that there is no liquid surface water at all, but a
lot of surface ice.  Water does not stay liquid in a vacuum or near-vacuum.

This is meant to be a description of a world that people from all over will
fight to live on.  It\'s not "rich" = wealthy, it\'s "rich" = a prize for the
controlling government.

Absolutely.  I wouldn\'t want to immigrate to a corporate world; the only
decent lifestyles are for the shareholders, or (for tourist attractions)
anyone as long as the money lasts.

There\'s a big difference in "quality of life" between an A66888A-A world
(which is Rich under the rules) and an A6688DA-A world (which isn\'t).  IMO the
government requirement for class Ri makes sense, assuming you think the basic
idea of a Government digit makes sense at all....

Jim> I\'m sorry to disect your article down to this one sentence
Hey - no problem - I pay to see all this stuff quoted and requoted!

world building with history:

Werrrlll, to a certain extent this is what the DGP WBH does with
terraforming, only in reverse ... ie instead of playing out the changes, it
attempts to infer them, albeit in a limited area. This also relates to the
discussion about whether to do the star type or the mainworld generation
first. We are pretty well stuck, and for fairly good reasons, with the
sector data for the Imperial milieu. So "official", or wannabe official,
systems also need to start at that point (I realise we don\'t all wannabe
official, there will always be two systems, the better one and the one we
are stuck with ...). Point being, if you want to stay with the main thread
of what is likely to issue forth from GDW it may be worth looking more at
the world building by inference method.

trade values:

Yeah, none of these ever made any sense to me either. I think they were
created merely in order to provide a set of variations for the trade system,
which is broken anyhow. I hope this lot gets fixed.

Traveller and O/B and Ia/Ib stars:

Yes, that is irritating. I\'m not sure whether the "not more than one or two
per sector" recommendation holds true or not (I also was a humanities
major). Is there any occurrence of such a star in the official sector data?
I just had a quick skim of the Deneb domain data in MTJ 3 and there\'s none
there. (I guess the non Marches data was just mass generated. Deneb sector
in particular was badly generated if so - the DM for the secondary star does
not seem to have been applied).

SpaceMaster and Dwarfs:

If you look at the bottom of para 1.3.1 in the SM GM Book, it says that a
negative score on the companion star roll results in a dwarf, and the
companion star is automatically a dwarf if the primary is a dwarf (which is
as you point out impossible under the SM rules). So I would guess that the
absence of dwarf stars in the rules is a typo rather than deliberate.
There\'s a repackaged version of SM out, maybe they fixed it now.

Wildstar\'s extra UWP stats:

My head says no, my heart says yes. I\'d use them ... What would be
interesting to know is whether GDW is planning to provide a World Builder\'s
Handbook equivalent for TNE, or indeed any extended World generation
mechanism which then precludes enhancements to the basic one. For example,
just moving from the basic to extended system generation, you have no mod
for within/outside the habitable zone.

The other point goes back to star types - if we have star types as now which
suddenly turn attractive worlds into iceballs, then generating life stats on
the basis of atm/hy is not going to be so useful. (And also is this stat
useful for non-carbon based life forms ...).

[ also, using the score to throw against in the way you suggest would surely run against the way the other UWP stats are used - eg life sta
3 - ie low life score, whatever that may mean - I throw 2, showing sentient
life, but then we need another stat to indicate this ... surely its better
to match the score to rungs on the evolutionary ladder, similarly to the TL
 ... so multi-cell life forms on a 3, up to sentient life form on 12, say
 ...?]

  For a bare-bones set of mods, use the following:

  No Law or Moderate Law        +0
  Low Law                       +1
  High Law                      -1
  Extreme Law (A-C)             -2
  Extreme Law (D-E)             -3
  Extreme Law (F-G)             -4
  Extreme Law (H+)              -5

  Rationale:  At No Law, there is no way of ensuring that the 
  person who develops new technology will be able to profit from 
  it.  If something is good, it will be used by anyone who can get 
  their hands on it, and without paying.  This reduces the 
  incentive.  

  At Low Law, there may be some protection, so there will be some 
  innovation.  However, it only rates a +1 because the government 
  will normally not be powerful or influential enough to make large 
  investments in research.

  At Moderate Law, you will typically have a government that has 
  the power, influence, and revenue to invest in research, and 
  sufficient freedom of information exchange to make it profitable 
  (in terms of results).  However, at this stage, the government 
  will probably have a tendency to want to direct the research, 
  rather than dropping the cash on the table, sitting back, and 
  saying, "O.K.  folks, let\'s see what you can come up with."  

  This directive tendency will continue at higher law levels, and 
  with the continuing decrease in personal freedom and freedom of 
  information exchange, and increasing compartmentalization of 
  research, the return on investment will typically drop heavily.  
  At some point, the government will probably decide that research 
  is unproductive of results, and tech will stagnate (Look at the 
  USSR on Terra in -2531 - most of their technology was acquired 
  through intelligence gathering).

  These worked pretty well for me.  I\'ve also tried fooling with 
  the DMs for government type, with results that were not 
  unreasonable.  That info is posted in my next message.

  Note: For balkanized worlds, generate the national governments of 
  interest, and use <my other table, which factors in espionage> to 
  generate gov\'t TL modifier.  (see Note to Note)

  Note to Note:  The other table mentioned here is essentially 
  identical, except that because of intelligence-gathering 
  activities, negative DMs are moved one notch closer to 0 (i.e. a 
  -1 becomes a 0, -2 becomes -1, and so on.)

  Rationale:  +0 modifiers - When there is no formal government
                 structure, any new technology developed is
                 unprotected, save by individual effort.  In this
                 event, even if the technology is developed, it
                 will be slow to be released, because of concerns
                 of the developer profiting from it (i.e. the
                 developer wants to; others may be more willing to
                 steal the technology than buy it).

                 In a benign oligarchy, or a charismatic 
                 dictatorship, it is less likely that those in 
                 power will hear about good ideas that are not 
                 developed within the governmental structure, thus 
                 reducing the chance of advancement.  Such a 
                 government, however, will not necessarily _reject_ 
                 an idea if it hears about it.

               + modifiers - A company has the utmost interest in 
                 development of technology that will allow them to 
                 achieve higher return on investment.  Ideas will 
                 be actively sought after, and explored for their 
                 profit-making potential.

                 Democracies have a high level of personal freedom 
                 and will tend to allow ideas to percolate around 
                 without interference.  Coupled with laws 
                 protecting intellectual property, and the fact 
                 that the government will generally be pretty busy 
                 trying to prostitute itself to the special 
                 interests acting in the name of "the people," 
                 there will probably be significant opportunity for 
                 ideas to be pursued despite theoretical 
                 restrictions on the use of government funds.  The 
                 less a government has to deal directly with the 
                 people, the more it will be able to direct 
                 research, thus the lower DM for a rep. democracy 
                 vs. a parcip. democracy.

               - modifiers - The fundamental obstacles to 
                 technological progress in these governments are 
                 multiple: insularity from people outside the 
                 government, doctrinaire educational policies, 
                 rewarding of conformity over individual 
                 initiative, personal paranoia (in the case of 
                 dictatorships), conservatism (including but not 
                 limited to religious orthodoxy and extremism)...  
                 All of these combine, to varying degrees, and 
                 result in an inability to develop ideas once they 
                 are presented, and a further reluctance for 
                 individuals to present their ideas for fear of 
                 being condemned or persecuted for them (recall 
                 Nazi Germany\'s attitude towards "Jewish Physics").

  Note that these are only guidelines; fiddle with them to suit 
  your needs.  Some of the factors cited for negative DMs might be 
  at work in governments that have positive DMs, and vice-versa.

Re: Life Stat

Two nights ago, Wildstar proposed adding a life stat to the UWP in order
to account for the extent of a planet\'s ecosystem (presumably to be
modified by colonization whether destructive or beneficial). However,
he suggested rolling under the stat on 2d6 to determine whether or not
native sentience has evolved. Mark Watson argued that this is probably
too liberal, and being conservative on this issue (my reasoning can be
read in yesterday\'s TML), I\'m offering the following table for criticisms.

0: Sterile
1: Amino Acids
2: Single-celled organisms
3: Multi-cellular bacteria
4: Simple vegetation
5: Complex vegetation
6: Microscopic insects & sea life
7: Macroscopic insects
8: Macroscopic sea life
9: Land/Air-based herbivores
A: Land/Air-based predators
B: Large/Complex predators
C: Tool use
D: Fire use
E: Agriculture
F: Symbology (full sentience, TL=0)

As you can see, my peculiar prejudice for cracking down hard on the
"minor" races has led me to confine even the most advanced of them
to TL=0. For my own campaign, this is perfect, but I imagine that for
most others, it won\'t do (just another example of how setting drives
planetary generation and vice-versa). For the more liberal-minded,
you may want to give C+ various higher degrees of technology than
what has been listed.

Re: Resources Stat

Wildstar also proposed a "resources" stat. Here is another table for
your consideration.

0: Barren
1-4: Poor
5-8: Moderate
9-C: Rich
D+ : Extreme

Poor: Basic chemical diversity necessary to support indigenous life.
   Otherwise, no claim to fame.
Moderate: One solid natural-resource industry. Roll on table 10a of
   the MT Ref\'s Manual. Re-roll 34-54 if life < 4 (see above). Re-roll
   65 if life < 5. Re-roll 55-56 if life < 8. Re-roll 61-64 if life < 9.
   Re-roll 66 if life < A.
Rich: Two natural-resources industries, one of which commands strong
   subsector-wide influence.
Extreme: Three natural-resource industries, one of which commands
   sector-wide influence.

Note: The GM should translate natural-resource industries into their
   manufacturing/processing (2nd stage) industries as seems appropriate.
   See MT Ref\'s Manual (pg52) for possibilities.

Another note: Under this system, the resource stat is rolled before
the life stat, and the life stat is rolled before the specific
industries are determined.

I admit, this is all very cut & dry, but it\'s easier to complicate
a simple system than to simplify a complex one.

Ooops. I wasn\'t even aware that the table was repreated on page 50.
When I looked at the sunbane errata, I was looking under page 25,
where it first appears in the ref\'s manual. Sorry. I guess I should
have been more thorough.

Still, I\'m not sure that I entirely agree with the errata version
either. I\'m wondering why Atmos is A+ instead of A-C, i.e. why should
atmospheres D, E, and F cause oceans to be non-watery?

I have another question about atmosphere type E. It assumes that
the world is ellipsoidal (egg-shaped?), and that therefore the
atmosphere pressures range from very high to very low depending
on where you are on the planet\'s surface (since the atmosphere is
still spherical) (see page 21 of ref\'s manual). 

Two questions: Is this realistic? Would is also apply to the
hydrosphere? (if so, we could have a world mostly submerged but
with two ends jutting like mammoth mountains out of the water,
seems strange to me).

The "Ice-Capped" trade classification means that most or all of a
planet\'s water is locked up in ice caps.  Thus the requirements are an
atmosphere that (in general) won\'t support liquid water, but with a
non-zero hydrographics code.

There are lots of TL-5 to TL-8 Industrial worlds in the Imperium; the
benefits of robotics and fusion reactors are not going to be felt here.
On a more general theme, power generation is not the only kind of
industrial pollutant; most chemical and manufacturing processes have
nasty by-products.  Although this is only one data point, most
industrial nations here on Earth currently have a problem with the
pollution of the environment with industrial wastes.

I can\'t really believe in entirely mechanised shipyards, nor can I
support the idea of a world populated by a couple of thousand humans and
several million robots all turning out goods at an enormous rate.  If
one assumes that interstellar trade is a fraction of the Imperial
economy, then the most important factor in setting up an industrial
world is the presence of a strong local market.  Which will require
millions of consumers, hence the population requirement.

No, a Rich world is one that is prosperous because it has reasonable
living conditions, is not over- or under- populated, and has a
government which is conducive to personal prosperity.  If a corporation
should take over a Rich world, it will cease being Rich, because the
corporate government would change the way the worlds\' inhabitants live
and work.

As I understand it, the spectral classes in current use are:

     O - B - A - F - G - K - M - N
                              \\   \\
                               R - S

People who know more about astronomy are free to correct me (this is
certainly not my area of expertise; I\'m doing this from memory of a
conversation I had with an Astronomy prof I used to now).  Anyway, as I
understand it, R and S are "carbon" stars (they have carbon lines in
their spectra) and are quite rare, the R being a "carbon version" of the
M, and S is the "carbon version" of N.

I have star generation tables (created from some of this information,
and put together long before Book 6 was ever published) which can
generate almost any type of star at approximately the correct
frequencies.  They are two D100 tables, though; if there is interest, I
will post them (let me know).

Class O, N, R, and S stars, as well as the size Ia and Ib supergiants,
are fairly rare, which is probably why Traveller ignores them.  If you
want, you can sprinkle these around, at about one or two per sector.

Traveller and MegaTraveller were firmly D6 games; fudging on the
probabilities in order to get the thing to fit in a D6 roll is
reasonable; complete accuracy in stellar types is not required.  If the
referee or players know enough to be aware of the problem, they can fix
it by tweaking the results.  This seems to be a philosophy behind many
parts of the Traveller/MegaTraveller world generation system.

As I understand it, about half of the star systems out there are
multiple (binary or more), which means that more than half of the stars
are part of a multiple star system.  Most multiple star systems will
contain stars that were "born" at approximately the same time from the
same cloud of dust and gas.  As a matter of fact, stars should be born
in groups and clusters this way, so that nearby stars are about the same
age.

Since all of the other UWP stats reflect the condition of the world as
it is now, and changes are inferred; I\'d assume that the changes due to
colonization have already been applied (just like the effects of any
terraforming have already been applied).  Given this, and given that
upon reflection even I think that rolling 2d6 for Life or less is
probably too liberal, try the following:

Life Score
0 = Sterile (although "organic" compounds may be present).
1 = Pre-Life (sophisticated "organic" compounds, precursors to life).
2+  Some Life Present (at least single-"cell" simple organisms).
    As the Life score increases, the number and size of the ecosystems
    increase, as does the number and complexity of the organisms which
    can be found there.  Remember that this applies equally to 
    native life-forms as well as "imported" forms (due to activity of
    the Ancients, colonization, or simply by accident).  The minimums
    for native development of a given complexity can be figured out from
    the table below.

Whether or not you apply DMs to the Life score based on the stellar zone
the planet is in (inner, habitable, or outer) depends on your views on
really outrageous biochemistries.  If you believe that sentient life can
evolve in ecospheres in gas giants or on ultra-cold (or ultra-hot)
worlds, the zone DMs should be no more than -2 or -4.  In this case, I\'d
suggest using a -3 for Inner and Outer Zone worlds, and a DM of 0 for
worlds in the habitable zone.  This is probably compatible with the
Classic Traveller vision of the universe (which is heavily indebted to
Larry Niven and Edward E ("Doc") Smith) with intelligent gas-giant
dwellers and all sorts of exotic life-forms, and sentient life-forms are
all over the place, although many of them (from the Jgd to the Cymbiots
aren\'t really "life as we know it").

While the above pretty accurately describes the way I feel, I certainly
understand if this isn\'t everybody\'s cup of tea.  For a lot less life in
general, and a lot less intelligent life, try the following DMs:
- -1 if not a Main Sequence (size V) star
- -1 if not a Spectral Class F or G star
- -6 if in Inner Zone
- -4 if in Outer Zone
This should cause the most Life to cluster around the habitable zone of
class F and G Main Sequence stars (in other words, stars like the Sun or
a little brighter).  Thus most life will be "life as we know it", and
will be much less prevalent than in the first method.

Now throw 2d6 and subtract the results from the Life Score:
0-  No significant native organisms (all "boring" or imported).
1 = "Interesting" native single-cell organisms.
2 = "Interesting" native microscopic (multi-cell) organisms.
3 = "Interesting" native plants (macroscopic).
4 = "Interesting" native animals (non-sentient).
5 = Complex native ecosystem (multiple "Interesting" organisms).
6+  Native Sentient or near-Sentient life (always interesting).

The second throw should probably be part of the "world building"
procedure, and not part of the basic generation.  Once the throw is
made, the referee will then have to decide (as part of the detailed
world description) what the "interesting" things about the planet are.

From the above procedure, you can see that it is possible to generate a
world with a lush and complete biosphere, all of which is the result of
a large colonisation effort.  This also makes the minimum Life score for
a world to have native sophonts to be 8.  This system causes one or two
worlds to have native sentient (or "near-sentient", an out for referees
who don\'t want this many minor races around) per subsector.  Assuming
the Life DMs balance out (and they may not, I didn\'t check) random 
generation will have about 5.4% for all worlds (or a little less than one
in 18) with native sentient or near-sentient life.

> [table omitted in the interest of brevity]

I really wouldn\'t want to lock down that exactly what each level on the
scale means.  Comparing two ecosystems on Earth is rough enough;
extending this to encompass, for example, silicon based
methane-breathers will stretch it too far.  Not every world is going to
have a carbon and water based metabolism that arose from the oceans.

I really don\'t agree with this, particularly from C (Tool Use) on up;
these distinctions should really be made as part of the details for the
native sentient or semi-sentient race.  The exact stage of development
should probably be determined by the referee during the "world building"
stage of generating planetary details.  I should also point out that
while the use of tools and fire is pretty much a clincher for sentient
or semi-sentient creatures, by the time they are practicing agriculture
the society is pretty much at TL-0.

Using the tables above as a guide, the followings are minimums for
native life forms:

0 = Sterile
1 = Pre-Life
2 = Life (maybe even pre-cellular life)
3 = Single-Celled organisms
4 = Multi-cellular organisms
5 = "Plant" life
6 = Animal life
7 = Complex ecosystems
8 = MINIMUM for native sentient organisms.

But please note that it is possible for a world to have a Life score of
12, but not have any "interesting" native life.  One possibility is a
world that has been colonized, and the colonist\'s imported plants and
animals have out-competed the native ecosystem, which as become nearly
extinct.  This is a definite possibility, particularly on worlds that
have been civilized for thousands of years.  Another possibility is a
world that is covered with oceans, which are literally filled with an
amazing diversity of single-celled organisms.  Literally every square
centimeter of the worlds\' surface has something living on it.  Although
such a world might have a relatively high Life rating, it may only rate
as having "interesting" single-celled organisms.

> For the more liberal-minded,
> you may want to give C+ various higher degrees of technology than
> what has been listed.

I would think that it is better to have the Life score as independent of
the natives\' TL as possible.  The Life score can be used to determine
whether or not there *are* natives, but their TL is more properly the
province of the worlds\' TL score.  If the world has both a native
population and human colonists, the UWP TL score will indicate the
population that interstellar travellers will interact with the most.
When "building" such a world, the native race and its technology can be
detailed.

> Re: Resources Stat

Here are some suggestions for the Resources score, too.  

Roll 2d6 and subtract this total from the resources stat:
0-  Nothing worth commercial exploitation (at this time).
1-3 Better sources exist elsewhere; local commercial exploitation only
4-7 Major Source; important subsector-wide producer
8+  Principal Source; important sector-wide producer
The referee will then have to decide what commodity (or commodities) the
world\'s resources represent.  While this is relatively quick and dirty,
there are some potential problems.  These problems are the same as the
ones inherent in the scheme proposed by Jim: it is quite possible to
roll up two worlds, both major producers or better, and both with the
same resource, all in the same subsector.

Either Jim\'s method, or the method above (I don\'t think it\'s very
important either way; the two are nearly equivalent) are probably
suitable for most referees.  On re-consideration, Jim\'s system is
simpler, and therefore probably the better of the two.

A better method would be to select a resource type (perhaps using Table
10a, or from some other source), and roll 1d6.  This is the "amount" of
this resource, but not more than the resource score of the world.
Continue until the entire resource score is accounted for.  An example
is in order:

2d6 Roll 10 for the Resource score of the world.
1st Resource: #61, Livestock.  Amount: 5
2nd Resource: #42, Plants (wood).  Amount: 4
3rd Resource: #63, Livestock.  Amount: 1 (a 3 was rolled).

So, our hypothetical world produces Livestock at Level 6 (the two
livestock resources add, at the referees\' discretion), and Plants (wood)
at Level 4.

Comparing all of the scores and types within the subsector and within
the sector will reveal the primary producers of each type. 

> I admit, this is all very cut & dry, but it\'s easier to complicate

Agreed.  While I don\'t like your Life system, the resource system you
present is very simple and has the desired effect.  One suggestion,
though: prehaps we should come up with a resource type table which is
more appropriate than good \'ol Table 10a/b.  A better variety of
resources, and with the table organised so that we can use a DM based on
Life, Size and/or other planetary stats would be good.

One possibility would be to use a 1d6+1d6 table (like tables 10a) and
apply DMs to the first die based on the Life Score (Life 0=-2, 1-3=-1,
4-6=0, 7-9=+1, 10+=+2) and the second die based on the world size (Size
Asteroid/VerySmall/Small=-1, Large=+1).  What do y\'all think?

Re: Star types

but type O, I\'m not sure why they changed it... probably in order
to conform more closely with observed stellar frequencies.

Type O is *very* rare. There\'s a second factor as well. Type O stars have only a few *million* years on the mainsequence, after which they die rather messily (can *you* say "Supernova"? I knew you could!)

Since all the stars in an area will tend to be of the same age, that means that all the type O (and almost all type B) stars will have gone supernova before life evolved on most planets around here.

Good thing, too. A supernova can be lethal at *interstellar* distances. Several parsecs at least.

Everything I\'ve ever heard regarding planetary formation indicates that a type O star *can\'t* have them. Too little matter left over from forming the star, and too little time before it got bright enough for the stellar wind and sheer *light pressure* to blast everything out of the system.

It is interesting to note that Space Master (unlike Traveller and
GURPS), includes two other spectral classes (S and N), which are
placed below M (dim red) on the classification scheme. Actually,
to the best of my understanding, there are 10 spectral classes:
O, B, A, F, G, K, M, R, N, and S.

Are there any astronomer types out there who can tell us
more about these final three spectral types and/or give us some
local-area frequency probabilities for each of the spectral
types?

I\'m only an amateur, but I\'ve got a textbook sitting in fromt of me. It doesn\'t even *list* R, N, and S types. From my reading, I seem to recall that they are very rare and don\'t really fit in with the other tpyes. For the sort of thing we are talking about, they *should* be ignored.

So type O stars should be *at most* one per campaign (unless your campaign map covers *thousands* of parsecs) and they shouldn\'t have planets.

BTW, if the tables give (as I recall) stellar luminosity on a scale that has Sol as 1 and a type O star at 10,000 or so, then there\'s a rough formula for how long the star will spend on the main sequence:

T=11*(L^.75)
T= lifetime in billions of years
L= luminosity

ConTech Explorer III Prospector\'s Boat TL15

     The Explorer III was designed and marketed by ConTech of Glisten as a 
dedicated auxiliary craft for asteroid prospectors. The Explorer III is 
intended to fit into the air/raft bay of a standard Type S scout ship, the 
most common vessel modified for prospecting.  The Explorer includes a power-
ful densitometer for examination of prospective asteroids, and a cutting 
laser and a quartet of external robotic arms to allow samples to be gathered 
without the necessity of vacc suit work.  No long term accommodations are 
ordinarily provided, but a bunk could be installed in the cargo space allot-
ment, if desired.

Hobbes class Superbulk Freighter TL15

     The Hobbes class superbulk freighter is an example of the extremely 
large merchant craft run on prepared routes in the Imperial core, and civi-
lized sections of the Imperial fringes.  The freighters are dependent on 
picking up fresh sets of drop tanks at each stop, and power plant fuel has 
been pared down to the minimum needed for a port-to-port trip.  Since a fully 
loaded freighter has an acceleration of only 0.083G, reaching the safe jump 
limit in a large gas giant system could take up to 70 hours, although most 
mainworlds are smaller.  No provison is made for wilderness refueling, and 
megacorporations operating vessels of this and similar classes generally 
operate their own fueling facilities at each stop.  The cargo capacity of 
170,517 tons allows over 42,600 Imperial Standard 4 ton freight containers to 
be carried.

Since your center of gravity is going to be roughly at the center
of all three axes of the ellipsoid, yes, you will probably have
lower pressure at the ends of the ellipse than at the equator (I\'m
assuming that the planet is elongated from pole to pole; anyone 
who knows more about planetary evolution want to confirm or deny
that that\'s the most likely situation?). Just how significant
those differences would be would depend on the size of the planet.
And, yes, it would affect the hydrosphere, too. There probably
wouldn\'t be a whole lot in the way of equatorial landmasses.

COMPARISON OF \'MILITARY CAPACITY\' OF THREE SECTORS:

     I  got curious about the relative military strengths of the  region  sur-
rounding the Domain of Deneb in the Rebellion Era, since I am hoping to get my 
own campaign through the Fifth Frontier War.  Previous discussions on the  net 
have  revolved  around the question of whether or not the Aslan have  the  raw 
military  strength  necessary to overrun the Imperial sections of  the  Trojan 
Reaches.  For the purposes of this analysis, I have used the Spinward  Marches 
and  Trojan  Reaches data from sunbane/DGP, and the Gvurrdon data  from  Alien 
Book 3: Vargr.  Deneb and the corresponding Vargr sector to the coreward  have 
been ignored.  They may not really cancel each other out, but lets assume that 
they do.  For purposes of comparing strength, I have noted some of the  perti-
nent  data  regarding \'important\' worlds below.  What counts as  important  is 
something  of a floating scale: Generally, I\'ve included any planet with a  TL 
of  13 or better and a population digit of 9 or higher, and TL12 planets  with 
population digits of A.  Based on fairly extensive experience with High Guard, 
I\'ve  elected to apply a factor of 1/2 to each TL below 15.  Thus,  8  billion 
TL14  people are rated as equal to 4 billion TL15 people, or 16  billion  TL13 
people.   In practice, the relative value of the ships built at differing  TLs 
is  strongly  dependent  on the computer value, and other  more  difficult  to 
calculate factors such as whether the lower tech force is faced with a uniform 
high tech force, or a force of mixed tech levels.

Now for the data:

Vargr    : 72.5     72.5


Are you still with me?

The  biggest single contribution to decrease in Imperial strength is the  loss 
of  Tobia,  right on the pre-Rebellion Aslan border.  If this  one  world  was 
convinced  somehow to join the Aslan voluntarily, it becomes quite  believable 
that  the  Aslan  would be able to push all the way to Glisten  with  the  new 
balance in forces.

Also, note the existence of Strend in subsector A of the Trojan Reaches.  I\'ve 
never  combed the Trojan Reaches data before, but this single world has  TWICE 
the  combined  population of Mora, Trin, Glisten and  Rhylanor  combined,  and 
therefore twice the potential military strength.  I suddenly realize that  the 
diplomatic maneuvering by EVERYONE centered around this world must be the real 
driving force behind all diplomatic efforts in the Domain and the  surrounding 
regions. Given that Norris has to divide his strength between guarding against 
the  Vargr and Aslan both, not to mention the Zhodani, whose strength was  not 
calculated  here  since too little of it is actually in the  available  secotr 
data, it looks like the Archduke has his work cut out for him.

Anyway, on the surface of it, there would seem to be no reason at all why  the 
Aslan could not take Glisten, especially if Tobia were to change sides.

massaging the data to allow for a Traveller:2300 like universe\'s
trade routes to be generated automatically.  I have not had the time
to firm up my findings, but I have the raw data to look at and
comment on relative star densities and so forth.

Please bear in mind that parallaxes (distances) are very imprecise
beyond a range of 5-10 parsecs or so; 10% error in distance is
considered \'good\' in this catalog.

The spectral type classifications started as observations of the
spectra themselves.  They initially had no linking to anything that
we care about, such as brightness, which is why they appear to be in
no particular order.  The numbers assigned as subclassifications,
rather than being a consistent scale wherein an O9 was close to a
B0, were judgements of the relative strengths of specific spectral
lines within that category.  The I-VI \'size\' descriptions started
out as a notation of the overall strength of the spectral lines --
the deeper they are the higher the number.  The VI classification
was used rather spottily, and one astronomer\'s V might be another\'s
VI.  It is only by coincidence (and the leap of faith of Hertzprung
and Russel) that these were linked to stellar size in a meaningful
way.

Of the last three (R, N, and S), they are specific subclasses of M
red dwarfs, which are used spottily.  R and N were at one point
subsumed into a class C (carbon stars) by some astronomers because
of the strength of the carbon lines.  Current observations have used
the more generic Me (M with strong emission lines) to describe all
three of these classes.  It is my understanding that their surface
temperature (color and brighness) are not affected.

Within 25 parsecs there are 2,150 stars tabulated.  With regard to
star type, there are 3 class B stars and no class O stars.

Also, binary systems are not _that_ popular -- the 2,150 stars are
grouped into about 1,700 star systems, with a few trinary and
quaternary systems.

I can add more later when I get home and look at the data and some
astrophysics texts, if anyone\'s interested.

Hmm... I dunno. Rich, to me, means rich. Maybe there\'s a different
adjective for these so-called freedom/middle-pop/relatively nice-
atmosphere type worlds. To strengthen my previous claim, consider
this. Rich worlds under the current system are designated so by
virture of atmosphere, population, and government, while poor
worlds, their supposed antithesis, are designated so by only
atmosphere and hydrosphere (both physical characteristics) and
without any regard to population or government. So the way I see
it (and this is an extreme viewpoint) is that we should use the
"resource" stat you proposed for these "rich" and "poor"
classifications and totally do away with the other criteria.

Yeah. You know my feelings on this: that a human-dominated setting
conflicts with the teaming-universe hypothesis (i.e. if you have one,
you can\'t realistically have the other). If you have any rebuttals
to this argument, however, feel free to share them. It\'s something
I wouldn\'t mind finding a way around.

> -1 if not a Main Sequence (size V) star
> -1 if not a Spectral Class F or G star

I dunno. I think we should just stick with inner & outer zone
modifiers, and I\'d be inclined to make those modifiers steep,
even prohibative. The stellar modifiers for those annoying
M-V\'s & M-VI\'s can be taken care of by the fact that there is
no habitable zone in such systems (due to the previously
mentioned tidal stress and consequential Roche limit).

So you want this table to be used in "world building", not in
mainworld (UWP) generation. I still think we should have something
for the UWP stat which is detailed. I admit, mine is probably
overly terran-centric, but at least it has some guts to it
(i.e. you can look at the stat and tell what\'s there in a
fair amount of detail... for example, there\'s nothing more
evolved than microscopic plant-life). We need something like
this right in the UWP. If you don\'t like what\'s in the table
I proposed, then propose another. Better that than to leave it
completely amorphous.

True, but I still think that the life-stat itself should tell the
GM something about the world. To say, "Oh, I\'m not sure what that
means, I didn\'t go through world-building for this planet" is
kinda silly.

I agree that I\'m locking the table into a terran-centric view of
evolution (which is stupid). But since I\'m not a science major, I\'m
not really fluent enough in alternate-evolutions to come up with
anything more generalized. If somebody has some ideas for generalizing
the table I proposed while still leaving the GM with a good feel for
what\'s there based on the stat, please step forward.

Okay. This is a good start (assuming we overlook the notion that
"kingdoms" other than protista, plant, and animal could evolve).
What I guess I\'m looking for is further generalization with more
detail (for values above 8). I admit, it\'s a tall order.

I totally agree with you on this. The thing is, while the table was
named a "life" table, it was really a "life/sentience" table. That is,
we tied the evolutionary development of sentience to the evolutionary
development of life. They went hand in hand. If you want to nuke this
hypothesis, just say so, but if not, there there has to be a linkage
either on the table for the UWP score we\'re inventing or in the
world-building process (I\'d prefer the latter, and from what I\'ve
read, you\'d probably agree).

Sounds good, but we still need a good table for establishing how much
the natives have evolved. That should be the life stat in the UWP.
Then we can bring up sentience in the world-building stage and let
each gamer go his or her separate way depending on how much non-human
sentience we want to deal with in our various campaigns.

We still have to be careful with our resource types. That is, if
the planet turns out to have no native life, or very little, and
further seems incapable of supporting any (i.e. vacuum, non-habitable
zone, etc) then having trees and livestock is probably going
to look funky.

Yeah, all in all, I like it. I actually like it quite a bit
better than the system I proposed for this same thing last night.
We just need to be a little bit careful with the resource types.

I\'ll try to get something worked up for tomorrow night\'s TML.
You can do the same, and then we can duke it out :-)

Let\'s not forget atmosphere. Hmm... this is starting to entail lots
of variables.


Re: Sector Viewing

Well, as you know, once we flesh out these two stats we\'re
talking about, we\'ll need a sector viewer that can read \'em.
What I have here is a new sector viewer (for the IBM-PC)
which is compatible with the sunbane (standard) data. I\'ll
modify the program as we come to a consensus (if we come to
a consensus) to incorporate the "life" and "resource" stats.

Here\'s the specifics:

        PROGRAM NAME: "galactic" [v1.0] {February 1993}
        GAME SYSTEM: Traveller/MegaTraveller

        COMMENTS: CGA or better required. Allows the user to
              skip from world to world, reading planetary
              descriptions and notes about each world in any
              given star sector. Is compatible with the sunbane
              sector data. Zip file includes Spinward Marches
              data as well as notes on the Yres system. QB45

Note that it does take a little work getting a sunbane sector ready
to view, but the spinward marches are all there ready to go. All the
user has to do is provide the long-winded world descriptions from
her or his campaign. Let me know what you think.

Thus one TL 15 ship should be the equal of 3 TL 14 ships or 5 TL 13 or
20 TL 12 ships of the same size.

Leaving aside the question of how you persuade the Imperial sector capital
to switch sides voluntarily you\'re ignoring the Aslans\' two greatest
handicaps: 1) Their division into separate clans and 2) that we\'re dealing
with _ihatei_.

1) Seperate clans: There are literally hundreds of clans. Of these there
are 29 especially powerful, but those 29 by no means represent all the
military strength of the Aslans. How strong can the biggest clan be? I\'d
say no more than 5% of the total Aslan strength.

2) Ihatei: We\'re not talking about a concerted attack backed by the full
military power of the entire Aslan population of the Trojan Reaches.
We\'re talking about younger sons being fitted out with _surplus_ ships
out of what the clan chief feels that he can spare. Is he going to
commit his full military strength? No, he\'s going to keep 90% of it
home to defend against his own lands against rival neighbouring clans.
In Rebellion we\'re told that the typical _ihatei_ fleet is TL 13.
Since maximum hierate TL is 14 I interpret this to mean that _ihatei_
are equipped with obsolescent ships (and I think that makes sense).
If so, your 55 billion TL 14 Aslans will muster the equivalent of
the full navy of 5.5 billion TL 13 beings for their _ihatei_ and your
170 billion TL 13 Aslans will represent an actual menace equal to the
full navy of 17 billion TL 12 beings.

IMO the Trojan Reach forces can deal with this. But even if you
inflate the strength of the Aslan _ihatei_ they still can\'t win.
Even if the Domain didn\'t have the muscle to deal with all aslans,
they will certainly have enough to make life impossible for any one
clan if they get really upset. Any ihatei admiral is going to think
long and hard before sacrificing his fleet so that other clans may
have it a bit softer.

Very true. And since we\'ve never hear of Strend being of the slightest
importance to the politics of the Marches we\'ve obviously got a major
contradiction that must be resolved by either deciding retroactively that
Strend has always been of paramount importance in the politics of the
Marches or that Strend isn\'t really that powerful. In my universe I\'ve
chosen the second option as the least disruptive. Oh, Strend is the
center of a small trade association called the Strend Economic Orbit,
but Strend has 8, not 80, billion inhabitants. (Which still would earn
them an active spot if I ever decide to run a FFW style game).

>Anyway,

That\'s a mighty big if to start with.

     Enter the Calvin class drop tanker.  The drop tanker mates
with the Hobbes transporter to supply jump fuel.  As the last drops
of fuel flow away, the Calvin tanker can escape at 3.3G\'s before
the Transporter jumps.  The Hobbes transporter must jump within 20
minutes of separation providing an adequate safety margin.  The
Hobbes usually jumps at a distance of 200 kilometers which is
reached at 79 seconds after the Calvin separates.
     Since the Hobbes transporter requires 50MCr of drop tanks each
jump, the Calvin tanker can pay for itself in 61 missions.

Where did you get this transfer of all four TL15 worlds to the Aslan, 
Rob?  My map shows Glisten as Aslan, but Trin, Mora, and Rhylanor still 
firmly in Norris\'s hands.  I also have a figure of 42 billion @ TL15, 
not 28 billion.

You also should keep in mind that the Aslan MAY (if they are REALLY 
lucky) be able to sterilize Tobia.

{I doubt they actually COULD, but they might be able to.  Note
that nuclear attack is not a useful method of destroying Tobia, since
Aslan nuclear weapons are stopped by Tobia\'s nuclear dampers 97% of
the time, and the Imperial nukes (if any are used) are not stopped at all
by Aslan defenses.  The alternative is Aslan meson weaponry, which will
be less than impressive on Ihatei ships (if only because it takes a full-
grown battleship to mount much of a meson gun at TL13, and the Ihatei
(we are told) don\'t HAVE batteships - they have (VERY) light cruisers,
comparable to Amondiage\'s "Swords" or a high TL version of those Vargr
ships in Rebellion Sourcebook).  The meson weaponry reasonably available
to the Ihatei would be totally useless against Tobia\'s meson screens,
and the Aslan defenses against Tobia\'s deep meson guns would be non-
existant.  Keep in mind also that reprisal raids by the Imperium against 
Aslan worlds nearby would be devestating, since Imperial offensive 
weaponry could overpower any Aslan defenses this side of the Rift, and 
allow the Imperium to do unto the Aslan pretty much any way they like, 
with little fear of defeat (or even failure to accomplish their 
mission). }

I doubt seriously that they could come up with the resources to actually
TAKE the place intact.  And if they don\'t take the place intact, then
the power didn\'t trandsfer from Dd to them, it just went away...

Well, I have added a Trojan Reaches player to my TCS.  Would anyone care 
to take the job of an Ihatei Fleet?  Then you could find out for 
yourself whether the Ihatei could take Tobia... :-)

This is a common fallacy.  DON\'T make the mistake of trying to compare
HG ships with MT ships.  While it is true that a WELL-designed MT ship
can be more than a match for even the best HG ship, in general, HG
produces significantly more-combat-effective warships than MT.

BTW, Rob, the estimates I gave Hans were based on HG, but they actually
work fairly well for edge-of-the-design-envelope MT ships too.  For
AVERAGE MT ships, the TL effects should be increased significantly...

It is unlikely that that particular cruiser could take on the Impy Navy
even WITH a huge numerical advantage.  The sensors/computers/electronics
are a joke, and the weaponry is designed for fighting relatively light,
low tech opponents.

But a similar design in HG would be MUCH more effective...so watch out :-)

This is the most common fallacy about the relation between HG and MT. 
If you go to the trouble of checking, you find that the Aslan cruiser is
54.3% fuel.  A comparable performance HG ship would be only 33.6% fuel. 
So the effective combat payload (defined as everything BUT fuel and
drives) of an HG version would be 90% higher than that of the ship in
Rebellion Sourcebook.  Remember that while MT requires only 2/3 the Jump
fuel (for J-3, anyway), it requires FAR MORE power plant fuel (almost
ten times as much).  Think about it...

that I enjoy refereeing Trav more than any other RPG. When MT was 
released I was very excited, but I found myself struggling with the 
rules. The concepts seemed interesting, but they lacked the logical even 
flow of M. Miller\'s original rules. Besides the fact that there were 
many typos in the various tables, I was greatly discouraged from the new 
set of rules. I liked the greater support for equipment and ship design 
but I found out that for me the system was unplayable. I was wondering 
if anyone else feels this way about the two versions. I usually find 
myself using the orginal set of rules, but I have since stopped playing 
Trav. I am looking foward to the new version, and I was wondering if 
anyone knows about what changes it has in store. I was also wondering if 
anyone was familiar with DGP\'s upcomming  A.I. role playing game. I liked 
their MT supplements very much. Does anyone know what even happened to DGP?

I hope to see some discussion on these topics.

    'month' => '02',
    'body' => 'Greetings to denizens of this fine TML:

        I have been monitoring the discussion on TML these last few weeks about
the distribution of stellar classes.  With some free time after my last PDE
class, I decided to do a quick survey of the space around Sol.  Please note
that these figures are very round and do not necessarily reflect the universe
as a whole.

        There are apx 100 stars within 6.5pc of Sol, with almost half of these
stars members of binary of multiple star systems.

        Counting the occurence of each spectral class gave these numbers:

        Class           #
        O               0
        B               0
        A               2
        F               1
        G               8 (including Sol)
        K               14
        M               66
        Dwarf           8
        TOTAL           99

        The class Dwarf lumps anything not in the other classes together.

        The ratio of O-B-A stars to the rest of the classes is about
1:38.  Bright, large stars are rare.

        Already we can see how the small, dim M class stars dominate the
population.  If any of these stars have planetary systems, the chance of them
being inhabitable are slim.  Also, being small, the most these stars will
probably have are planetoid belts.  Larger planets (size 3+) are probable going
to be rare.  After all, if there was a lot of material around when the star
formed, the star would probably have been bigger.

        From this, it seems that the probability tables in SpaceMaster are
fairly accurate (at least for gaming purposes).  I havent checked the tables in
WBH yet (my copy is at home), but over the weekend, I will strive to extend this
population survey to more stars and post results next week.

        There has also beed discussion of the different types of spectral
classes and their relationship to each other.
          In addition to the O-B-A-F-G-K-M classes, there are other types of
stars, including the misunderstood R-N-S classes.  These classes include:

        Wolf-Raynet Stars:  O-type stars with emmission spectra possibly caused
by the ejection of material from the star at high velocity.  Planets around
this O-type star would possibly be severly cooked.

        Peculiar A Stars:  The name says it all.  These are A-type stars with
strong absorption lines of certian ionized metals.

        R Stars: R-type stars are similar to K-type stars, except for molecular
bands of C2 and CN are present.

        N Stars: N-type stars are similar to M stars, except for bands of
C2, CN, CH.  R and N stars are also called carbon stars.

        S Stars: S-type stars are like M stars, except for bands of zirconium
oxide and lanthanum oxide present with, or addition to, titanium oxide.

        These lesser type stars are extremely rare (estimates of <1000
Wolf-Raynet stars in our Galaxy).

        As for the distribution of stars through space, Near-Sol surveys give a
population of aboput 59 stars within 5pc of Sol.  Extending this out (and the
extension seems to work pretty well) gives an average of one star for every 9
cubic parsecs.

        More data to follow later.

  Well, I have just scanned system generation in the Referee\'s Manual, and
  a few of the sectors available on sunbane, and have found a few others...

  In MT Ref\'s Manual, page 24:
	B - Imperial Naval Base and Scout Way Station both present
	M - Non-Imperial Naval Base

  In Hlakhoi Sector:
	R		{ You got me as to these... }
	T

  In Old Expanses Sector:
	W - Imperial Scout Way Station (just a guess)

  In Alpha Crucis Sector:
	X -     { And again, you got me... }

  There\'s probably more bases out there of differing types that I 
  didn\'t come across, I only did a quick scan, but these seem to be left
  up to us to explain. Nasty, eh?

  And now, to be my old irritating self, does anyone have a sweet clue
  as to how we go about randomly (Retch, ack!) generating a Scout Way 
  Station? This would allow us to also encounter a "B" code.

Time for a stupid question:

If gravity goes at the speed of light, and light goes at the speed of light,
how can gravity catch up with light?  If it can\'t, why can\'t light escape
from a black hole?

Make that two stupid questions:

What do gravity waves do when they hit a black globe?  If they get absorbed
by the black globe, then you can have a nice perpetual motion machine - have
a small vehicle carrying a black globe which switches on said globe and floats
up, then switches off the globe and falls down, then switches the globe back
on before it hits the ground and floats up, etc.

My guess is that 2300 is deader than Star Trek RPG (ie: very).  Haven\'t seen
hide nor hair of any new stuff in quite a while.  It is to bad, because it
certainly had the possibility of becoming a very interesting background.  IMHO
it needed more background modules & less adventure modules.  A good history
would have done wonders for it.

Re: Traveller vs. MegaTraveller

I prefer Traveller.  MegaTraveller unnecessarly complicates the game.  Having
scaling complexity in rules is great, you never know how detailed you might want
a particular action to become (BTRC Timelords is pretty good here) ...however, 
the min complexity level in Megatraveller is to high.  It takes concentration 
away from _role_ playing & puts it on _rules_ playing.  Let the flames begin.

Einstein\'s GR called gravitation the curvature of space-time.  How does
a universal geometry propogate?

These are serious questions, scott.  I\'m out of the mainstream so I\'m
ignorant of all the new theories and findings and models.

Are you sure? I thought that gravity propagated instantaneously. As
far as I know, they\'re still working on finding a gravity wave/particle.
If they do, it\'ll be a big step towards the "Grand Unified Theory" 
that theoretical physicists get all starry-eyed about.

This posting is my entry in a race between me and Scott Kellogg, the
two people on the TML who have done the most work with Vargr as people
as opposed to chits on a strategic map, to see who gets to address
your "thought" first. |-> In our view, the smell of pheromones is a
very important part of Vargr society. Scott handles them somewhat
differently than I do.

For my part, I assume that Grandfather toned down the response
severity, but could not remove it completely. The smell of a bitch in
heat is instantly noticeable to a male, and can range from mildly
distracting to maddeningly persistent, depending on the particular
individuals involved (just as the sight of a woman will have differing
effects on a man depending on the individuals). Vargr social cues rely
heavily upon smell, and heat carries strong sociological connotations.
Because Vargr culture varies strongly from place to place, the way
society deals with heat varies as well. In some cultures, heat is
considered impure, and a bitch must sequester herself during heat. In
others, heat is considered a sign of favor, and bitches receive
special treatment during their cycles. Heat may alter standard
dynamics of day to day life and business, and the smell is of course
synthesized at high TL for various purposes. Scott places a much
stronger emphasis on the power of what he terms "heet" (to
differentiate it from the more usual use of the word) in the Vargr
psyche; as he runs the Vargr in his stories and games, the smell of a
bitch in heet is a powerful intoxicant, blurring and even erasing the
lines between sentient and animal behavior. Some bitches go completely
insane twice a year, and must be restrained to prevent injuries.
Others suppress the urges with drugs and mental exercises; even
psionics are turned to this use. (I\'d quote some interesting
monologue he sent me for a story we were co-writing here that
addresses exactly this topic, but I\'d want his permission first...)

If you\'re wondering what GDW\'s official line on this is, don\'t hold
your breath. There ain\'t none to speak of. Traveller has always held
up gender-neutrality as a great strength of its makeup, and I do not
for a moment believe that any article on sex in Traveller will ever be
published with official sanction, because that sort of prurience flies
in the face of all the game has represented to date.

Of course, *I* have a number of theories on the subject, and have
written them up to post to the TML, but have lost my nerve every time
I tried to post. Loren Wiseman and the gang at GDW were very nice
about the time I talked about chest sizes among alien women, but I
don\'t know how much further I want to push my luck. Posts on Antarean
sexual fetishes and the nether equipment of the Aslan aren\'t really
what you want in your portfolio when you\'re trying to get GDW to let
you write up a TNE sourcebook for them....

Once again somewhat red-faced, I remain,

    'body' => 'Hmm... there seems to be a misunderstanding here about what a gravity wave
actually is...

But before I attempt to muddy the waters, I should point out that I am a
mathematician who has seen some of the _mathematics_ of general relativity,
have a more than passing interest in the subject, but I am by no means a
physicist and I will defer to anyone with better knowledge than mine. Also
I am posting without using any references, which is doubly dangerous. 8-)

A gravity wave is a ripple in spacetime caused by the movement of mass. A good
analogy to think of here is of a block of wood floating in a pond, the
block of wood is your mass (such as a star), the pond is spacetime. If you
bump the wood, you generate a ripple in the water which, as it propagates,
can cause other blocks of wood to move. The ripple in the water is roughly
(very roughly in fact 8) ), analogous to a gravity wave.

Gravity waves have nothing to do with black holes per se (although black
holes can generate them if they\'re accelerating), and the reason that light
can\'t escape from black holes is due to the nasty things which happen at
the event horizon, not gravity waves pulling the light in. To extend the
above analogy, if you imagine the black hole as a drain hole with water
draining out (in the traditional funnel shape), then the water can be very
smooth (ie. no gravity waves), but can still pull objects into it, even if
they are moving away from the drain (ie. light can\'t escape). This is an
even worse analogy than above, but it does get across the difference: the
light can\'t escape because of the shape of the spacetime.

The problem with finding gravity waves (and particles, which are the same
thing) is that they are extremely weak in virtually all cases, and hence
are hard to detect. So hard that no one has done it. But I think most
physicists consider them to exist. As to there speed of propagation, all I
can say is that that\'s what you get out of the equations (and I can\'t
recall if I have seen such a derivation), but on a heuristic sense, it
makes sense that they move at the speed of light, since gravitons (gravity
particles) are zero rest mass particles (like light), so they should move
at the same speed.

In addition if gravity waves were to travel faster than the speed of light,
you would have a means for FTL communication (it would work along the lines
of: two people have two large masses. One person wobbles their mass, and
the other watches the way their mass wobbles once the gravity waves from
the first reach it). Instantaneous propagation of gravity waves would allow
instantaneous communication, which contradicts the "no communication faster
than speed of travel" background of Traveller for a start ( 8) ), and if it
were possible in the real world, I think there would be a lot of research
into trying to make it practical...

Enough of that. What about black globes? No, you couldn\'t make a perpetual
motion machine out of one, at least not by the method suggested, because a
planet doesn\'t radiate gravity waves as seems to be being assumed. I would
think that what would happen in the situation described would be that the
black globe would fall towards the surface of the planet exactly as would
the ship it contains. If a black globe hit a gravity wave, I would expect
that it would behave exactly as would its contents (ie. it would follow the
same trajectory), but it would buffer its contents against the effects of
the acceleration caused by the wave, absorbing the energy of the wave into
the energy sinks.

This would allow some neat things to be done by ships using black globes,
though. For instance, I would expect that a ship protected by a black globe
could go (briefly) into areas with strong tidal forces (such as around
neutron stars) where they would normally be torn apart. Also, they could
undergo accelerations while within a black globe that would normally leave
the crewmembers splattered across the floorpanels. These two ideas would
allow some pretty neat gravitational slingshot manoeuvres. Not that they
really are needed when you have 6G thrusters and inertial compensators, but
I\'m sure that a good ref could tie in those uses of black globes.

I hope this has cleared some things up. For more information, check either
a good popular science book (sections of "A Brief History of Time" by
Hawking or "The Emperor\'s New Mind" by Penrose spring to mind as possible
sources), or try the rec.arts.sf.science or sci.physics newsgroups.

See ya \'round.

PS. About 2300AD: On of the rumours about Traveller: Then New Era is that GDW
will produce a 2300AD sourcebook which will allow the new Traveller rules to
be used in the 2300AD universe. This would be a Good Thing IMHO, since I
really liked the 2300 universe (and as you can probably tell by the above
waffle, I like my sf fairly hard).

it might be propagated by \'particles\' called gravitons however there is,
at the moment, no evidence for this.

The reason a black hole can prevent light escaping is because the field is
already there and so can act on the photons. You could think of the black
hole as a \'source\' of gravitons streaming out all the time, consequently
if the black hole is 100 years old its gravitational well will be 100 ltyrs
radius (discounting the gravity of the star that was there previously).

Finally, no, you have not made a perpetual motion machine using gravity
waves and a black globe. All you have is a machine for extracting energy
from gravity waves, much like wave-powered electricity generating schemes
which turn water waves into electricity - these aren\'t perpetual motion
machines!

From Symon, Classical Mechanics, p. 581:
"Since the principle of relativity requires that gravitational effects cannot be
transmitted instantaneously from one mass to another but must propogate through
the intervening space, it is perhaps not surprising that the theory of 
relativity predicts the existence of gravitational waves traveling with the 
velocity c.  Again the effects of such waves are expected to be very slight.
However, by 1969, experiments by J. Weber appeared to have detected such
waves.*"

* - it is now believed that Weber\'s results were in error. 


"The Search for Gravity Waves" by P. C. W. Davies (Cambridge University Press,
Cambridge, 1980) is a concise summary of the properties of gravitational waves
and of experiments to attempt to detect them.

As a side note, for those who are really interested, I should point out that
some authors refer to gravitational waves as simply gravity waves, while 
others reserve the latter term to refer to surface waves on water whose
restoring force is caused by gravity.  These waves tend to be of much longer
wavelength than the smaller capillary waves.

Mass has the effect as though it has curved spacetime.  Anything (even photons)
are effected by the curvature.  If the curvature is great enough photons
can not climb out of the well cause the total energy of the photon is
less then the potential needed to escape.  If the mass were suddenly 
removed (Zot!) space would become flat but it would do so a the speed of
light - meaning if you were 1 light day away, there would be NO WAY for
you to detect the sudden loss of mass for 1 day while it propagates out
to you.  Hence gravity travels at the speed of light but can still "catch"
other photons.

If the globe absorbs gravity (which is actually a fairly weak force) then
you would gain energy - but you wouldn\'t float up since the only thing
that would cause you to rise would be air pressure caused by air molecules
impacting on the globe which would be absorbed and not transfered to the
ships momentum.  Switch it off and you drop like a rock.  Back on again
and you...drop like a rock - no change in momentum - you are headed for
a big crash!

You can derive the velocity from the tensor equations.  Anything else is
just handwavy.  Basically, nothing with mass can travel at or above c and
massless particles (photons, neutrinos, etc) travel at c.

Yes.  The effects have been measured.  If the current theory\'s predictions
are wrong, they are wrong by smaller amounts than we can currently 
detect, or at least in the areas we have looked.

The is a way of viewing the mathematic.  It is a model not necessarily
real life.  All math is just a model of reality.  It is only important that
it produce accurate predictions not be an accurate representation of what
is going on.  In any case, take a sheet and "snap" it.  The ripple travels
at a finite speed through the sheet.  A propagation of curvature.

No, see above.  Gravity is DEFINITELY a finite speed effect.

Yes, they are still trying to detect the effect in a controlled way.  They\'ve
had some successes but nothing conclusive (enough) yet.  I should point out
that the experiment is not the prove anything (everyone already accepts
their existance) but more to demonstrate.  No experiment ever proves
anything, they can only disprove things.

The speed of gravity:
I sat in on a seminar last year on magneto-gravitation.  The
seminar basically put forward the idea that the gravitational
equivalent of magnetism could be used.

When one moves a static electric charge, one creates a magnetic
field.  Basically, the lecturer was saying that a magneto-gravitic
field could be made by moving masses at high fractions of the speed
of light.

Like most seminars, it was 80-90% over my head.  But they DID put
up a series of equations that were the gravitational equivalent of
Maxwell\'s equations for E & M.  They claimed the equations plugged
some of the holes in Einstien\'s General Relativity.  For their
equations to work, they explained one would have to assume that
gravitons (or gravitational fields) travel at the speed of light.

Gravitons do not interact with each other, but they Do interact
with photons.  In a black hole, they would pull any photons into
the radius.  It is unlikely that a photon be at the precise
trajectory needed to escape from such a hole.

Do I believe it?  I don\'t have the background to question it.  THEY
sure sounded sure of themselves.  The Professors at Auburn sounded
skeptical, but others pointed out that a lot of the skepticism was
from the ingrained ideas many of them had on gravitation.

The upshot of the seminar (and what I passed on to the TML) was
that these guys were talking about using the high speed of
electrons in superconductors in order to create a magneto-gravitic
field inside the body of a space station.  They estimated it would
produce an artificial gravity field of about 0.1 earth gravities. 
This would help to reduce a lot of the physiological problems of
microgravity.

Vargr Pheromones:

Ahem.  Well, until recently I played a vargr female character in
the TML-PBEM.  And I Will say that pheromones DO play a role in how
attractive a vargr is to another vargr.  There would be no reason
for the Ancients to take this out of them.

As to how it affects role playing?  Well, remember that when you
look at a member of the opposite sex, you (being human) tend to
find that person attractive or not just by their physical
appearance (sight).  Other factors tend to be the sound of their
voice (hearing), and (if you can get close enough without being
slapped) the way they feel (touch).

Now in addition to all of this, Vargr have a keen sence of smell. 
Imagine all the sonnets of Shakespeare about how beautiful a woman
looks or the sound of her voice, all expressed in terms of scent. 
You have a VERY different world to look at.

In my Traveller universe, the vargr publications like the Trav News
Service all have olfactory data encoded for an odor emmitter.  It
tends to drive Imperial news readers buggy, and you sometimes have
to obtain a vargr news reader in order to get the data out
properly.  I\'ve mentioned the Gvurrdon Biker mag:  Fragrant White
Wag.  Which is highly read in the vargr Marches communities, It has
olfactory data encoded so you can SMELL the grav bikes.  Now,
imagine a vargr EROTIC magazine...  |->

I *WILL* Say that I think it is fortunate for Mike Metlay (\'Vouf)
and myself that Karavorre never actually came into heet during the
Official turns of the TML-PBEM.  Roleplaying THAT would have gotten
pretty complicated.  |->

Einstein did explain gravity as the curvature of spacetime.  The geometric
rules caused by gravity, called the "metric", can be time dependant, thus there
can be propagating waves.  Gravity waves are, according to theory, produced by

Various people are asking questions about gravity waves, most seem to be confused about what a gravity wave *is*.

Gravity waves are *changes* in gravity. In other words, changes in the local curvature of space-time.  They are *not* emitted by the *existence* of a mass, but by changes in the position of the mass. Just like electromagenetic weaves are only emitted when a charge is *moved*.

So the light still gets trapped by the gravity of the black hole. Ad in so doing causes the emission of an *incredibly* weak gravity wave as it adds to the mass of the black hole.

To get strong gravity waves you need to move a *lot* of mass *rapidly*. Something like a "starquake" on a neutron star... (where due to cooling the surface may "crack" and suddnely cotract by a millimeter or so. That\'s a movement of  at least gigatonnes of mass. (likely many, many orders of magnitude more, but I don\'t feel like calculating the mass of a 1 mm "shell" of neutronium that\'s 20 or so km in diameter)

All true, but:
High TL?  I\'d argue that the superior vargr sence of smell would enable
production of synthetics at much lower technology than it would take for
humans.  After all, what is the TL of introduction for perfume?

I would also say that the introduction of higher brain functions would
in and of itself reduce the severity of the effect of heat on the brain.
After all, as humans we haven\'t had any deprogramming along the evolutionary
lines, and we don\'t degenerate into animals at the sight of an attractive
sexual partner.  (Though, I admit to howling at the sight of my Fiancee\'

I think you misunderstood some of my words:
Ahem.  Well, those are the EXTREME cases.  Normally, sentient behavior
is maintianed throughout.  However, when I said that I was pointing to
cases of hormone induced insanity.  To be completely frank I have
seen human females go quite literally insane due to hormonal changes
over a montly cycle.  Vargr will hardly be immune to such.  The tiny
amount of reading I\'ve done on wolves leads me to think hormonal
cycles in Vargr females tend to be more extreme.

As far as I can remember, current theories call for a charge carrier
particle for all four forces.  The carriers of electromagnetism (the
photon), the strong nuclear force (the pion) and the weak nuclear
force (the intermediate weak boson) have been found.  All have zero
rest mass and all have a set velocity of c, 2.998x10^8 m/s.  The
reason that they are affected by gravity is that they have a mass
due to their speed -- zero mass and infinite (relativistic) speed
yields any number for relativistic mass you want... ^_^  Since they
have mass, black holes can haul them back, and they end up orbiting
inside the event horizon if they enter it.

No one has found the fourth, the \'graviton\', because it would be very
difficult to build a graviton detector.  (Can you think of a
substance that isn\'t affected by gravity?)  However, it is also
postulated to have zero rest mass and a velocity of c.  I believe
that it is not supposed to be affected by itself (i.e. gravitons
can escape the effects of black holes), perhaps because it can\'t
make sense any other way.  I\'m not quite sure, but I assume that
since black holes are postulated to have an effect outside their
event horizon, gravitons are not affected by gravity.  (Perhaps they
have no mass?  Hmmm.)

Responding to Adrian Hurt\'s second \'stupid\' question, as he calls
it, I believe that black globes block the electromagnetic force
exclusively.  All electromagnetic radiation, and matter (which
carries electric/magnetic charge -- I think that since neutrons spin
they carry some magnetic charge, correct me if I\'m wrong) are
stopped by a black globe.  The two nuclear forces are insignificant
to anything inside the field.  Gravity, however, affects it.  I
think I remember something in the High Guard rules involving a
squadron with black globes jumping in so as to glide around a planet
on a hyperbolic course, unglobe, and attack the ground
installations.  In order to do that they\'d need to be afffected by
gravity.

Responding to Tim Soholt, I don\'t believe that gravity propagates
instantly.  Einstein believed that information could not travel
faster than the speed of light, and information in an Einsteinian
sense can be encapsulated in gravity waves (either gravitons of a
particular wavelength/frequency/energy or ripples in the fabric of
space-time, whichever you prefer) if you have a large enough mass as
a transmitter.  I believe that Einstein considered that and came up
with the answer that gravity travels at the speed of light because
it fit the rest of the model well.

I am one of those people that likes realism in his space campaign.

In regards to that I like the idea of a 3D starmap and I use the 2300AD
map, but of course, I have wanted a larger 3D map.  I am in the process
of converting the "Machine Readable Version of the Catalogue of Stars
within 25 Parsecs" to use in a database.

For those of you not familar with the catalogue, its on finet somewhere in
Finland.  There are 2150 records, each 135 bytes long, containing up to 44
pieces of information on stars within a sphere around our sun , 25 parsecs
in radius.

I have put the file into Excel and exploded each 135 byte record to tis
its components.  I have then set up a database (Access) to receive the
information.  My own goal is to have a file containing the coordinates
(preferably cartesian for simplicity) for display in other programs, and a
file containing information like magnitude , type of star , etc.  This
would be inthe same format as the 2300AD starmap, Near Star List"

The database will allow users to look at stars in a particular area of
space, or a type of star, or whatever information you put on it.. ie,
something to store campaign information in .  One possibility would be to
store political allegiencies, navy sizes, trade types.

This is being done on a PC, in Windows, and I will make it available to
everyone onthe group, but I have a problem.  I want to make a starmap that
would give an accurate location for a star at the time of my campaign (2203
AD).  I don\'t know how to use some of the data.  It gives declination, and
right assencsion for each star, but there is such things as:annual proper
motion, radial velocity, U component fo space velocity relative to Sun, V,
and W components, Box orbit parameters w, e, and i.

Its fairly obvious to me that all I need to do is use one set of these
numbers, specifically the velocities to determine the star\'s position in
2203.  However, I have a few questions:

1) How do the U,V, and W components relate to the declination?
2) What re the box orbit parameters relation to U,V,W and the
RA/declination?

3) How does parallax play a role in these numbers?
  I am aware that parsecs (3.34 ly per parsec ) are the recipricol of
parallax, and the error in parallax increases the farther out you go.

  What I need advice on is which of these sets of numbers to use, if more
than one set is given for a particular star?  Also, do I need to worry
about the orientation of the dec with respect to the sign of the number when
I convert to spherical coordinates?  The data is given is positive or
negative numbers, and I am wondering how this relates to the other
parameters given?  Since this is not that difficult to calculate and
compare numbers on my own, I would like to know what other people know
about this subject or whether they have done their own calculations.  It
wouldn\'t matter if I just used RA and decl, since I can arbitrarily set my
axis anywhere, but I want to know for consistency , how the other parametsr
relate to this.

  Secondly, I want to know if I need to modify this data with regards to:
precession, geocentric parallax correction on RA/DEC and atmospheric
refraction?

  If so , what are the equations?

  There is not that much data in the file on each star, and once I have the
information it would not be that difficult to plot all the points, or have
the database select a section of the sphere and just plot that.

  I would really appreciate it if someone would take one set of numbers,
whether real or not, and show me the relationship between them.

  Hopefully I can get this done fairly quickly, post it, and go on to other
things.   By the way, anyone use the database ability of Excel?  What do
you think of it?  

Steven B. Fellows
sfellows@slate.mines.colorado.edu

PS: The current size of the Excel file is about 4.5 megs up from 300 k from
the original datafile.  The database sits at about 580 K, but that is just
a table of the data, with no forms yet.  The ultimate goal, is to have:

1) Star number (field index)
2) X coordinate
3) Y coordinate
4) Z coordinate
5) Luminosity
6) Magnitude
7) Spectral type

There is also something called B-V color and U-B color.  I would assume
this is either related to redshift, or spectral type.. any ideas?

PPS: If Jack Dietz is reading this list... ( can \'t remember if my
correspondence on this subject is from here, or from NetNews), how are you
doing on your project related to this?

Sorry, but this is WRONG! The carriers of the four basic forces of nature are
NOT all charged and they do NOT all have zero rest mass. The photon transmits
the electromagnetic force and has NO CHARGE and is MASSLESS. The strong
nuclear force is not really transmitted by the pion but is in fact transmitted 
by gluons which have NO CHARGE and are MASSLESS (they have a property called
COLOUR which is how they interact with other hadrons), although some models of 
nuclei do model the force as pion exchange the actual carrier of the force is 
the gluon. The weak force is transmitted by the W and Z bosons. The Z boson 
has NO CHARGE but a MASS (91 GeV/c2). There are two W bosons (W+ and W-). These
have CHARGE and a MASS of approx. 80 GeV/c2. 

The massless bosons (photon, gluon and graviton if it exists) do indeed travel
at the speed of light, have zero mass but a FINITE ENERGY and it is the mass 
equivalence of this energy that indicates how they are affected by gravity.
A zero mass paricle particle does NOT have infinite speed, it travels at the
speed of light, and ZERO MASS means just that, the particle has ZERO MASS.
Even if you do consider GammaM as the particles \'mass\' this has a FIXED
VALUE determined by the energy. You can\'t just pick whatever you feel like!

Sorry, but WRONG again! The reason it is difficult to build a \'graviton
detector\' is because the effect of gravity is so small compared to all the
other forces of nature. The comparative strength of gravity to the rest of the
forces varies but is always less than approx 1E-34, hence the difficulty in
detecting it. Particle detectors in use today are made of hadrons and
leptons which ARE affected by the strong and weak forces respectively,
and yet they still detect gluons(indirectly) and W/Z bosons with relative ease!
In fact, if the particle you are trying to detect DOESN\'T interact with your
detector HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DETECT IT!

Hope that clears up a few points.

This description is out of date in some ways and wrong in others. 
Current thinking goes like this.  Electromagnetism (the unification of
the 1800\'s) and the weak nuclear force have been unified by Glashow,
Weinberg, and Salam into the Standard Model of the Electroweak
Interaction, or for short, the Standard Model.  These fellows won a
Nobel Prize for this a few years ago.  This model describes the
common things from electromagnetism and reactions covered by the weak
force, such as beta decay of nuclei or neutrino interactions.  The
"carriers" of electroweak are the photon, W, and Z bosons.  Some properties
are:

    mediator   charge   rest mass         possible velocities
    ----
    photon     none     none              only at the speed of light (c)
    W          + or -   80.22 GeV/c**2    anything < c
    Z          none     91.17 GeV/c**2    anything < c

Note that the electroweak interaction affects both hadrons (mesons and
baryons) and leptons (electron, muon, tau, and their neutrinos).

Now the strong interaction.  This covers the interactions between quarks
but does not have anything to do with leptons.  It is mediated by the
gluon, which carries the **color** charge and has zero rest mass.  Color
charge comes in three varieties, red, green, and blue.  Hadrons must be
color neutral or "white".  Thus mesons are color-anticolor doublets of
quarks and baryons are RGB triplets of quarks.  By the way, remember
this is NOT color in the visual sense.  The mathematics describing this
(Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD) works out in a certain way having nothing
to do with visual color.  The use of the word "color" for the strong charge
and that the color charge is red, green, or blue is just a convenient
analogy.

A little bit about the pion.  It is made up of a quark doublet (actually a
superposition of doublet states) and hence is classified as a meson.  It
comes in both electrically charged and neutral forms and has a rest mass.
The mass of the neutral pion is 134.97 MeV/c**2 and the charged pion mass
is 139.57 MeV/c**2.  It can move at any velocity below the speed of light.
In nuclear physics pion exchange between nucleons was given as the
mechanism for some reactions, but this is not a fundamental interaction.

As to the graviton, I don\'t have any information off the top of my head.
If anyone is interested, I can pursue this with my theory colleagues
down the hall and then post an overview of the situation.

Regards,
Richard

P.S.  Is anyone else as completely disgusted with the description of how
meson weapons work as I am?

Best estimates of particle masses, from the Particle Data Group
handbook are:
	PARTICLE	FORCE			MASS-ENERGY
	photon		Electromagnetic		< 3.0e-33 MeV
	W		Weak Nuclear		81 GeV
	pion		"Strong Nuclear"*	135 MeV (uncharged)

According to Yukawa, the strength of a force\'s potential as a function
of range is

	V = - K * exp(-u * r) / r

where K is a constant, r is the distance from the "charge", and u
is directly proportional to the exchange particle\'s mass (it\'s
mass times the speed of light divided by Plank\'s constant). For
zero mass, V = - K / r, which is the potential for the electric
field; so we can conclude that the Electric Force\'s exchange particle,
the photon, has zero mass (or close to it) and therefor travels at
the speed of light.

Since the gravitational force also has a potential proportional
to 1 / r, we can conclude that the gravitaional exchange particle,
dubbed the graviton, will also have a mass of zero, and will also
propagate at the speed of light.

				Rob Flammang

* The strong nuclear force is actually intermediated by the gluon,
but a long ranges (more than a few femtometers) the pion (which has
gluons in it) does most of the exchanging.

Sigh. I suppose I can work up a new and comprehensive sex-and-naughty-bits
post for the Vargr and Aslan, but I do have to wonder what GDW and the
Keith Brothers, who created the Aslan, would say about some of the more,
erm, UNORTHODOX conclusions I\'ve postulated. If there isn\'t much general
curiosity, I may prepare a file to email directly to interested parties.
Otherwise I can do a general post to the TML, but like my Traveller erotica,
I am just not sure it\'s appropriate for distribution here....

Whoa! Neither the pion (aka pi-meson) nor the intermediate vector
boson (W-particle) have a zero rest meas. Quite the contrary. The
pion is massive and the W is *extremely* massive. In fact, this is
*why* these are "short range" forces.

The range of a force depends on how long the virtual particles that
carry it can last. This is given by a function that relates their
energy to the time they can exist using h (planck\'s constant). The
higher the energy, the shorter the time.

Since photons and gravitons have a rest mass of 0, they don\'t have to
"waste" any of their energy on mass. But the W and the pion *do*.
This sets an upper limit on the time they can exist, even with *zero*
energy devoted to carrying the force. That time gives the maximum
range they can reach.

were in the same room as a chimp in "heet" ( oestrus ). Nothing. The
more sensitive noses may detect a musky smell..but not a lot else.

3)Anybody got a copy of traveller;the new era yet. it ws apparently
scheduled for february but no show. I did a playtest of it at
WarpCon where GDW had Emailed a copy of the rules to the Convention
director..but they were incomplete. Its a good game..I like the
background at any rate..being a Hard Times person myself.

The Imperium is really screwed. Its all gone and a version of the
Long Night has settled over the Stars..as far as I know Norris\' gang
still have a degree of civilisation. I\'m also unsure of the role of
the star Vikings and I think its a silly name..and smacks too much
of Battletech\'s Clans.

Anyway..heres the adventure as we had it.....

I am Captain Charles Ryan, commander of the Most sophisticated war
Machine in Known Space. (Seen the Hunt for Red October...Youll know
what I mean) I have been commanded to bomb the hell out of a TL8-10
world for the sake of the WAR. I\'m a great commander..but this goes
against my grain and instead I become a traitor and destroy half of
my fleet comapanions and then leave the rest to rot while I jump off
to Avalon, a peaceful planet of lush greenery which i hope to
protect from the ravages of the WAR. 

Enter the Virus (a derivative of the Deo circuits)

While I am dining with the ambassador of the planet on his yacht, my
ship starts to fire on the Yacht. A big cockup results and we leap
into the Emergency Low berths and are jettisoned. Darkness and we
awake. We have been found by a Space Scout person who teels us that
we have been under for sixty years (ohoh we did a Ripley)
She explains that there were only two other survivors from my huge
spacecraft, one of them is a cook and the other is comms. She
explains that Avalon has a base from pre-Rebellion times hidden
beneath the surface and it apparently holds information on a variety
of Bio-Plagues which have been causing problems in rebuilding
civilisation. Of course I do not believe her story about us being
frozen for seventy years but I am shocked when she tells me that we
have only six personnel and a Stealth Speeder with which to find
this base.  BUT as i said I am an excellent tactician and apart from
being berated by the Scout for giving orders as apparently the
Military i am commissioned with doesn\'t exist anymore (What Rot!)
We find the base..unfortunately it seem to be in the middle of a
settlement of the planets natives. It seems that I didnt save Avalon
but the planet I saved is the scouts Home planet and she gives me a
bit of line as I am regarded as a hero on her homeworld...naturally.
The settlement is a religious commune...these natives have regressed
to TL6 and they have found a way into the base, where they worship
the shiny surfaces and corridors.
We force our way in and confront the priests...they demand answers
and we tell them that we are angels from the Gods and from there we
enter the complex. It is very old. We reach the central core and
download everything onto disc as well as taking a hardcopy ( a huge
pile of paper ). I am still very wary of the Virus and try to keep
the computers isolated so they are not contaminated.
We are picked up by the Scouts Mothership and we jump outsystem. My
fellow crew retire with their savings and I try to sign up with the
Navy again
Happy days

This was a very condensed version of the story as we had some
interesting encounters on the way..most of them were the fault of
our cook....He had an intelligence of 5 and insisted on trying to
make gourmet meals for us. Our covert mission turned into a fight
for a pheasant at one point as the cook attacked a hunter for his
gamebird and we had to silence him so as to not attract attention. 

Traveller:TNE can be played with beginners who have never known the
glory of the Imperium..or with hard times escapees who wake up to
find that its all gone and civilisation is only now beginning to
crawl out from under big stones.

Have fun.

Naval Attache
The New Era

Thanks guys -- I knew I could count on you... :)

    I was talking off the top of my head, and couldn\'t remember
details about some of the aspects of particle physics.  I have no
defense against allegations of making up information.

    To respond to specific comments:

To R. W. Moore (rwm12@cus.cam.ac.uk):
    I did not state that the fundamental force carriers were charged
electrically.  I stated that they were charged with the force that
they were carrying -- i.e. photons carry electromagnetic force and
so on.
    I had remembered that the \'pion\' was identified as having been a
carrier of the strong force; I did not know that it was indeed a
meson and not a particle in and of itself.
    I had believed that all virtual particles (those introduced for
bookkeeping and thus are not observed) were massless.  I was
mistaken.
    I stated that particles with zero mass have infinite
relativistic speed.  What I meant by that is that the quantity
one over tau reaches infinity at velocity c.  Thus the amount of
energy required to accelerate a mass to velocity c is infinite, thus
the velocity is infinite in terms of energy expenditure.  That
statement was used to justify my mentioning that since an infinite
amount of energy has been expended to accelerate a zero-mass
particle, the amount of mass the particle has now is finite.  By
\'you can pick whatever value you like\' I meant that you can do so
when the particle is created.  Photons can have any mass you want,
depending on their frequency/wavelength/energy/mass.  I apologize
for making such vague statements.  They were clear to me while I was
writing them, but after looking back I realize that they were
unclear out of context.  I did not mean to imply that photons have
a completely variable mass, nor that they travel instantaneously.
    The statement that gravity detectors need to have a substance
that is not affected by gravity included was simply stupid.  I had
been thinking in engineering terms of \'well, you need to insulate
blah-blah from what you\'re measuring, or it\'ll cancel everything
out\'.  Baloney.  I would like to point out that the gluons and
bosons that Roger mentions being detected by ordinary matter do so
after going through an accelerator and observing the energy from the
collisions -- we know of no such way to treat gravitons right now.
But, then again, that may be fixed by the next theory to come down
the pike.

To Richard Fernholz (fernholz@hep.physics.mcgill.ca):
    Thanks for the review.  I had heard about the electroweak
unification theories, but had not seen anything specific about the
particles recently.  Also, thanks for the QCD review.  I had, I
guess conveniently, forgotten about the fact that the pion was a
meson -- I had assumed that it, like the muon, was a fundamental
particle.  I\'d learned about them from an Asimov article, and the
conclusion he\'d made at the time was that the pion carried the
strong force.

To Robert Flammang (flammang@vms.cis.pitt.edu)
    I had assumed that there was some more complex bookkeeping
method to reduce the effects of the strong and weak forces than
having massy exchange particles.  I stand corrected.

To Leonard Erickson (Leonard.Erickson@f51.n105.z1.fidonet.org)
    Again, I had assumed that there was some more complex
bookkeeping method involved (than exchange particle mass).  Does
this involve the uncertainty princple and thus the range that a
particle can travel before being detected is dependent on the chance
that it will be \'seen\'?  Hmmm.

    At any rate, thank you for setting me (and the list) straight.

    'body' => 'Steven Fellows (sfellows@slate.mines.colorado.edu) wrote in the last
digest about star information.

Okay.  First off: you aren\'t going to get an \'accurate\' location out
of that kind of data.  Right ascension and declination can currently
be made accurate to less than a tenth of a second of arc, otherwise
we wouldn\'t be able to detect parallax.  This means that a position
error in the plane perpendicular to our field of vision is quite
small.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the distance to
the star.  Most of the stars we\'ve observed close by have a parallax
error on the order of 10%.  Some are less; some are much more.  This
means that at a range of 25 parsecs the average error approaches
five parsecs toward or away from us.  If, taking a 2300ad-style
approach to star travel, a starship cannot travel more than 2.3
parsecs between stars, the errors swamp our data.

Fine.  There is no way to correct this.  So, accept the data as if
it were without error and you get a star map.  Probably not the true
one, by any means, but a star map.  Once you have done
that, teeny corrections for the difference in R. A. and Dec. between
the 1950 epoch (that for which that data was compiled) and, say, the
2200 epoch become meaningless.  Stars just don\'t move _that_ much in
250 years or so.  (UVW velocities and box-orbit parameters are just
other notations for radial velocity.)

Declination is positive or negative because the original data was in
terms of north or south declination.  By using +/- signs the
astronomers made a continuous range from +90 degrees to -90 degrees.

B-V and U-B color are ratios involving the magnitude of the star
viewed through different filters.  It\'s a more direct way of
determining the color of a star than using the spectral class
(B/A/F/G/K/M), but I haven\'t figured out a good way to use them
either for that or for a bolometric magnitude correction yet.
It is not a value for red shift here.

The conversions for RA/Dec/Px to X/Y/Z coordinates are relatively
simple.  Before you start, however, you need to decide if you want
to realign the axes.  For example, it might be \'cool\' to have X
point toward the galactic center and Y point to spinward or
something.  Then you need to pick two points, one being the galactic
center and the other being a point 90 degrees away that is directly
spinward of us, and rotate the coordinates for all the stars.  Note:
GDW didn\'t do this.

Once that is done, or not, plug these numbers in:
Z: 1/Px * sin Dec
Y: 1/Px * cos Dec * sin RA
X: 1/Px * cos Dec * cos RA

This will give you rectangular coordinates in parsecs away from the
celestial pole, the vector of the vernal equinox, and the line
perpendicular to both of those.  If you want light years, multiply
by 3.27.

Note: In Excel it will be easier to do these if you have a column
for RA in radians and a column for Dec in radians.  There doesn\'t
seem to be a DMS->Radians conversion function included, so you\'ll
have to write some big function that multiplies and adds them
together and stuff.

By the way, you can rather easily check your data against the Near
Star List.  I found out that the base catalogs for both this catalog
and the one that GDW used have the same catalog numbers, so if the
catalog number has three digits chances are it\'ll also be in the
Near Star List.  This came in handy trying to pin down some of the
2300ad stars that have either names or oddball catalog numbers
listed.

Are you SURE that they don\'t use those scent glands they have?  If so,
why not?  Humans don\'t use scent signals, because humans are
comparatively scent blind.  Vargr may or probably won\'t mark by urination
according to culture, but you can bet that a Vargr\'s stateroom is going
to smell like that vargr weither they mark it in that fashion or not.
The smell of a vargr on one\'s territory is still gonna be a psychological
factor, conciously or unconciously.

As to the question of vargr use of dogs, mightn\'t that be a source of
low tech perfume?  I\'d think that Vargr would make use of specially
bred dogs in a similar fashion as whales that were hunted for ambergris.
The scent is bound to be close, and if bred carefully, the dog might
yield the proper scent cues.

I\'d also point out that there are only 300,000 years for evolution to
have any effect.  And that is a blink of an eye for evolution.  The major
differences between Vargr and wolves, are going to be the ones engineered
into them, and those are kind of unknown when it comes to their effects
on psychology.  \'Cause who knows what the Ancients were REALLY trying to
achieve and how well they actually did it.

Well, a more modern viewpoint (at least the one I was taught) says that
"mass" means rest mass, and anything else is a whole other kettle of fen.

IMHO, this is one of the most idiotic sf cliches there is. I can buy
the loss of the technology--Man\'s tools are incredibly interdependent, and
sometimes it seems more amazing that the web DOESN\'T simply collapse.
 
Religion and culture is a completely different matter. After two thousand
years of Christianity (or fill in any major religion), can you imagine YOUR
grandchildren "worshipping shiny surfaces"?

blaspheming (or maybe just insane) intruders confined.

Hello there!

This is my first posting to the TML, so I hope you\'ll bear with me until I
figure out who\'s who and what\'s going on...:-)

I\'m 23, and a postgraduate researcher in Radio Astronomy at Jodrell Bank.
I can see from the past few postings that there are a lot of people out
there who have queries related to various aspects of astronomy and
astrophysics -- I\'ll be happy to offer my comments, but I\'m afraid I\'ve
got a lot of work on at the moment, so don\'t expect prompt replies!

A few questions:--

a) Is it OK to plug fanzines on TML? On the assumption that it is...:-)

About two years ago, I helped to set up a Traveller fanzine called \'Signal
GK\', set in the Dagudashaag Sector. It runs to about 40 pages an issue,
with planetary backgrounds, adventures, alien races, and so on. Issue 6 has
just been released, so if anyone\'s interested, let me know.

b) Any other astronomers out there?

c) Any other UK Travellers on TML?

Thanks...

Duncan

Well, appropriate or not (do we have any children reading this list?  I
don\'t think so) it\'d probably be of more interest to a larger fraction
of the list than the current discussion of particle physics ... (not
that I don\'t like physics discussions, but this one seems to be getting
a little esoteric even for this group).

If you don\'t want to post the material on the TML, perhaps you could
distribute it to the interested parties via mail?

	As you may have guessed, this is about starships, or actually,
Warships.

	I\'ve been looking through a few designs and have been thinking about
my own designs (Mediocre, really) and have become confused as to what 
various classifications mean. I have heard of Battleships, Carriers,
Cruisers (Light and Heavy) and Dreadnoughts (sp?) and Frigates and 
Destroyers and, well, What are the requirements for a ship to be classed
as any one of these?
	I have looked at the Voroshilef (spelling by memory) Battleship listed
in the Rebellion Sourcebook, and I see it\'s big (300,000 tons), has a lot
of firepower, but why is it a Battleship? Why not a Destroyer or Planet
Crusher? Whatever.
	My common sense tells me that factors such as size, firepower, maneuver
drive and jump capability, as well as duration of operation, must all
contribute to this classification process. But how?

	I hope someone can enlighten me to this, and if you feel it
inappropriate for the TML (As I\'m sure it\'s been discussed...), please
feel free to send responses directly to me.

I found my copy on ames.arc.nasa.gov, path pub/SPACE/FAQ, files stars.data
(raw data file) and stars.doc (explanation).  I have massaged my version
somewhat, and I can upload a copy with rectangular coordinates (to twenty
decimal places, even though two is overkill) and some hand-entered information
if someone is willing to keep it at their ftp site.

If you have access to a friendly local university physical science library,
look for the book.  It has more catalog numbers, notes on most of the binary
star systems, and a better explanation of the individual values than the
online copy does.  The book is \'Royal Observatory Annals Number 5: Catalogue
of Stars within twenty-five parsecs of the Sun\' (sic), author Sir Richard
Woolley & co.

Somebody didn\'t do their homework here.  TL6 is post-WWII technology.
These people who worship "shiny surfaces and corridors" can make
stainless steel, radios, television, primitive computers, and can 
potentially place artificial sattelites in orbit around their world.

Given that these priests are TL-6 or so, I\'d guess that the temple

for the player characters to come along quietly ... or else.

I\'d say that there is no "official" answer.  Fighting Ships of the
Shattered Imperium presented some standard designs for starships of
Rebellion-era fleets, but every ship design in there has at least one
design problem, and may are just flat-out illegal under the
MegaTraveller rules.  So chuck that.

In addition, what is a "battleship" at TL-12 probably can\'t stand up to
a light cruiser at TL-15, so all terms are relative to the TL of the
culture that produced it, and the resources it has available.

With this in mind, I\'ll propose a bunch of general suggestions:

Battleship: A heavy ship-of-the-line.  Carries the best weapons and
defenses which are available at the constructing TL.  May sacrifice
speed and/or maneuverability to carry these weapons and defenses.

Dreadnought: A relatively high-tech battleship - Carries the best
weapons and defenses which are available at the constructing TL.
Improved speed and/or maneuverability over a battleship.  (for
MegaTraveller purposes, I\'m treating a dreadnought as equivalent to a
"Fast Battleship" (*see note)

Battlecruiser: Smaller than a battleship/dreadnought, but carries the
same weapons and is capable of the same speed/maneuverability
performance (typically by sacrificing defenses).

Armored Cruiser: Smaller than a battleship/dreadnought, but carries
(approximately) the same defenses.  May sacrifice weapons or
speed/maneuverability.

Cruiser: Smaller than a battleship/dreadnought.  Intended for long
duration missions "on station" or on patrol, and typically has less
powerful weapons and defenses than any of the above.

Light Cruiser: Small version of a cruiser.

Destroyer: An escort vessel.  Intended to protect ships of the line (all
of the above) from fighters, SDBs, missiles, and/or other Destroyers.

Escort: An escort vessel.  Intended to protect merchant or supply
vessels from pirates, privateers, and raiders.

Carrier: A capital ship (light cruiser sized or better) intended to
carry fighters (small craft).

Tender: A capital ship intended to carry riders (large non-starships,
typically in the battlecruiser, battleship, or dreadnought classes).

Rider: a capital ship (light cruiser or better) which is not equipped
with a jump drive (and is therefore more combat efficient).  Carried
into (and sometimes out of) battle by tenders.

Intruder: Typically similar to a cruiser, but intended for
deep-penetration raids, strikes, and reconnisance behind enemy lines
during wartime.

Raider: Typically similar to a destroyer or light cruiser, but intended
for raids behind enemy lines agains supply or merchant ships, to cut the
enemy\'s SLOC (Space Lanes of Communication).

Frigate: (this is my own, non-standard definition) A ship specifically
designed to be able to out-fight anything that it can\'t run away from.
Generally similar to a cruiser, but with more emphasis on
speed/maneuverability.

SDB (System Defense Boat): a non-starship (typically of less than
light-cruiser size) intended for the defense of a planet or star system.
Jump drives are not needed for this mission, with a corresponding
increase in the weapons and defense fit.

Monitor: a non-starship (typically of capital ship size: light cruiser
or larger) intended for the defense of a planet or star system.  Jump
drives are not needed for this mission, with a corresponding increase in
the weapons and defense fit.

*NOTE:

Current navies are not all that clear on the definitions of Frigate,
Destroyer, and Escort.  Different navies apply these designations to
different types of craft, with overlapping sizes, missions, and
armaments.

Historically, the Destroyer is a recent development; originally designed
as a "Torpedo-Boat Destroyer", destroyers are generally used as
screening craft for larger ships.  As torpedo-boats learned to dive (and
became submarines), destroyers became more specialized anti-submarine
craft.  In this role they were used to protect both merchant/supply
convoys and groups of surface warships during both world wars.

Escorts were originally developed as cheap, quick-to-build vessels for
the protection of merchant convoys.  High speed (a design requirement
for destroyers) was not so much in demand, and the weapons fit is
typically lighter.

Again speaking historically, the Battleship was developed out of the
sailing ship-of-the-line.  As iron (and later steel) armor was
developed, steam replaced sails as a power source, and broadsides of
cannon gave way to guns in turrets and barbettes.

HMS Dreadnought caused a revolution in naval architecture just prior to
WWI.  This was the first battleship to have an "all-big-gun" design: all
of it\'s primary weapons were turreted, and were the same (large)
caliber.  Shots were fired in salvoe, and gunnery corrections were
applied to all the guns together (resulting in more hits at greater
range than would be possible if several different types of guns were
firing at the same time).

Battlecruisers were developed at about the same time, on the theory that
the greater speed allowed by the lighter armor would protect the ship
just as well or better (wrong!).

The "Fast Battleship" was developed between WWI and WWII; improved
technology in effect giving a Dreadnought-type battleship
battlecruiser-like speeds.

Well, the above is a starting point, for the rest of TML to comment on
and generally pick apart.  It represents (in part) my own prejudices and
design philosophies, and (in part) information gleaned from various and
sundry bits of military history.

microprint and scrunched over at VGA resolutions so you can now see the
system data.  Not only that, the "QUIT" button is now visible at 640x480
resolution.

	SSV 1.3 (SubSector Viewer) should be available in the TML

	There are no set requirements for any label for your warships. 
Supposedly, a "Battleship" is capable of standing "in the line of
battle" (an imaginary concept in space), but most heavy "cruisers" do
it just as well as most battleships.  A "dreadnought" is another word
for "battleship" (referring to the first "modern" battleship, HMS
Dreadnought).

	The classifications are so vague that we have called Bainbridge
and Truxton (two old missile cruisers) "cruisers", "destroyer
leaders", and "frigates" at various times in their careers, based
mostly on current fashion.  The British call "Invincible" a
"Through-deck cruiser", even though Invincible is what we would call
an "escort carrier".

	The labels used are the modern ones we use today.  More or less. 
The Voroshilev (sp?) is a Battleship because it is big and tough.  Or
should be.  It\'s not really tough, and there are certainly bigger out
there.  It isn\'t anything else because GDW decided to use modern Naval
definitions (which don\'t really fit, quite frankly) for HG.

Nope.  Size, maybe, but there are "battleships" both larger and (much)
smaller.  In my Islands campaign, the "battleships" are smaller than
most Impy "cruisers".

At a guess, whatever the owner, designer or builder of the ship thinks
suitable.  Battleships need jump drives, otherwise they\'re battle riders
or (probably) very large system defence boats.  Carriers probably need
jump drives, or they won\'t carry anything very far.  Dreadnoughts is a
fancy word for battleships, and I suppose it might apply to battle riders
as well.  Anything else is up to you - take a look at the Kinunir class
battlecruiser, whose designation sounds a lot more impressive than its
firepower.  It\'s up to you whether a destroyer is a small escort ship,
as were WW2 destroyers, or whether it is a super battleship, as were the
Star Destroyers of "Star Wars".  In your own fleet, I\'d expect that heavy
cruisers are heavier than light cruisers. ;-)  But if someone else\'s light
cruisers are bigger than your heavy cruisers, don\'t fight them unless you
have a tech level advantage. :-)

Thank you for allowing me to advertise Signal GK on TML. Here\'s a short
file giving information about the fanzine...

[Thanks - I\'ll share this with TML! -- James]

SIGNAL GK
#########

Signal GK is a MegaTraveller fanzine set in the Dagudashaag 
Sector (the sector immediately to spinward of Core). The setting 
was originally developed by Duncan Law-Green as part of his work 
as a HIWG member, but the fanzine operates independantly of 
that organisation.

Each issue is between 40 and 48 pages long, A4 page size. Additional
material is included with each issue, such as library data on a
particular subsector (in A5 loose format, ideal for filing in a ring
binder as a reference), deckplans (B4 size) and `Specials\' articles
which were too large to fit in the magazine itself.

Each issue contains at least one `Contact\' article, detailing a new
alien race or culture, and at least one `Port of Call\' article
describing an individual system in detail. Other regular articles
include adventure scenarios of varying length, personalities, and
`INDISS\', the Dagudashaag news service, as well as new weapons and
equipment, and discussion of variant rules systems.

Signal GK has one professional artist who contributes regularly, plus
several enthusiastic amateurs of varying degrees of skill (your truly
included!) Contributions to Signal GK are always welcome -- those from
skilled artists especially so!

The contact address for Signal GK is:-

	Jae Campbell
	The Sanctuary,
	45 Fairfield,
	Hebden Bridge,
	Halifax HX7 6JD
	UNITED KINGDOM

Individual issues of Signal GK cost about 1.50 (sterling) in the UK
and about 2.50 overseas (by surface) -- I will check these figures;
they may have changed recently. A three-issue (1 year) subscription is
5.00 in the UK and 7.50 overseas.

I hope you found this helpful, and I look forward to hearing your
comments on this magazine.

because I thought not many would be interested.
The primitives were TL6....we were cutting edge TL15 though we were
limited in resources.
They hadnt satellites but they did have slugthrowers and a very
efficient type of crossbow. They were only in the first room of the
underground complex because they didnt have the access code for the
inner doors. 
I dont know how you run your games but we do not develop tech levels
simultaneously in other cultures....I mean that if the greatest
achievement of a culture is a TL10 laser..but the rest of their tech
is TL6 we assume them to have TL10- as that is the greatest possible
threat or help they could produce.

A bunch of primitives gesturing wildly with a WW2 rifle 
at a bunch of Travellers(now thats a term that I aint heard in a
 long time) with advanced combat rifles and some heavy laser support
is a joke...especially when we are wearing advanced ballistic plate.

Also we didnt force our way in....well we did really....but we
claimed that for their own safety we would have to enter the inner
bits of their \'temple\'....conjuring visions of radioactive meltdown
and stuff like that. We also did not want to slaughter them all and
pick up the bits later. these people were the last survivors of a
culture that my CHARACTER really admired...sure they had regressed a
bit but being bombarded with Star-Class weapons does that to a
nation.

People on Mailing Lists are too quick to criticise and too slow to
listen. Its a failing i have found in Roleplayers across the world
and I would have thought that there would be more discussion than
"Oh you made a mistake...Nya Nya NYA"

If anyone has any foolproof adventures then i\'d like to see them.
(Our GM confided that the rest of the adventure dealt with fighting
with the \'primitives\'...but our comms was an expert in contacts and
a damn good roleplayer to boot.)

Any questions?

me, my history is a tad rusty, but here goes). Back after WWI (or
maybe it was the Russo-Japan War...anyway), the World Powers decided
to limit their navies, and bascially said that the various countries
could only have so many of this ship and that ship. Of course, in
order to classify the ships, they had a list of rules which would tell
them what category a ship would fall. 

One of the more important considerations was gun size and gun count.
So, one thing the Japanese did soon after these rules were published,
was design what I\'m guessing is the Battlecruiser. But what they
effectively did was build a Battleship. It had the size and armor of a
front line battleship, but rather than mounting three gun turrets
carrying 12 or 14 inch guns, they mounted twin guns of (I think) 8
inches.

According to the list, this was a Cruiser...and they could have
several of them. The trick, of course, is that the turrets were all
fitted out and designed to mount the larger guns. The whole ship was
designed to mount the larger guns. When wartime came around and
everybody stopped playing by the rules, it was comparatively easy to
refit by yanking of the dual gun turrets and replacing them with the
large gun turrets -- which, of course, were already built. Nobody said
anything about not being able to build the guns, they just could put
them on the ships.

Of course, on the other side of the coin we have our modern Aegis
Cruisers. Which is really an escort ship for the carrier group, but
then it\'s pretty big...so maybe it\'s an Escort Cruiser.

I mean, what do you call a little, 30 foot ship armed with  4 SSMs
designed to knock out just about anything that floats? "Small enough
to be a patrol boat with enough firepower to level Manhattan!"

Design it for the role, name it after the role, perform the role.

    'body' => 'In reply to Sean Dean question about lack of adventures on TML:

It is my opinion (I may be absolutely wrong) that most of the traffic
generators on TML lack a consistent traveller play group (not including
PBEM). This is partly due to GDW\'s indifference and partly because most
people with internet access are academically and otherwise involved and are
too busy to run (or more importantly find players to run) Traveller.

Thus most of the traffic tends to a bit on the esoteric side. I have yet to
meet a PC who was truly concerned about stellar density and how it varies
from what is given in Traveller. However as a GM it is part of my fun to 
find out about things like that (even if I never use it in a real game 
situation).

Anyway, I include myself in the category of a GM with no players. I do have
some scenarios-adventures from my past campaigns that I could post.

However what would be more interesting (IMHO) would be for the homeless GMs
to post challenging scenarios which could then be play-tested and results
returned to the original writers or to TML. The GMs with playgroups would
probably have to agree to not infringe on the copyright of the scenario
designer.

In any case there is also the small issue of bandwidth and whether the
ir is any interest in playing/using other GMs ideas.....

My 2 cents worth

Ameer
P.S. May I make a general call to all the other folks that TML is about
Traveller as a GAME and many of us while curious at first, quickly tire
of the bandwidth devoted to Physics/Biology/Chemistry etc lessons.

If you\'re looking for a good book for roleplaying Vargr and their

_Sirius_ By Olaf Stapledon copyright 1944.  Available from Dover books
in the collection:  _Odd John and Sirius_

The book is a bit dated, and doesn\'t have space ships flying all over
the universe, but if you can handle GOOD fiction you\'ll like it:  One
of my personal fave SF-philosophy books.

It delves into the olfactory nature of the protagonist (A sentient dog)
in a very interesting manner.  HIGHLY reccomended.

Ship types are named after roles and cost primarily.  Ships of the Line
(battleships) are made as big and tough and dangerous as possible, and
damn the expense.  This means the only excuse to risk one is with the
aim of destroying equipment of similar value to the enemy...
 
At the other end of the spectrum are auxiliary and special-function
craft, like destroyers and corvettes and minesweepers. Typically
cheap and expendable.
 
In the middle are the interesting ships: the cruisers.  Made as tough and
fast as practical, but cheap enough to be expendable, probably lightly
armoured. They go out on the exploratory missions, patrol; they show
the flag around the empire in peacetime.  High command has no qualms 
about risking them on daring strikes, and so on.  Their captains tend
to be ambitious, audacious men keen to lead from the front. Troublemakers.
High command hopes they\'ll go get themselves a decently heroic demise.
 
Guess what?  The original Enterprise was a cruiser...

Article 1360 of rec.arts.startrek.info:
Subject: There\'s a reason those Trek aliens look human
Date: 1 Mar 93 18:20:55 GMT
Organization: Vulcan Science Academy, Tau Ceti Sector

A lot of people have complained that Star Trek aliens look too much
like humans.  Well, maybe there\'s a good reason for it after all.

There was an article in the Science & Medicine section of the San Jose
Mercury News on 23 February 1993 entitled `Researchers find gene that
orchestrates embryos\' written By Natalie Angier of the New York Times.
Quoting from the beginning of the article ...

	As any ardent viewer of the ``Star Trek\'\' television series
	will attest, the great majority of alien creatures portrayed,
	no matter how theoretically distant their origins, look
	terribly familiar.
		.
		.
		.
	But lest the creators of the series be accused of intellectual
	timidity or laziness, it turns out that nature, too, believes
	in an all-purpose, ever reusable blueprint for building
	mobile bodies.

The article goes on to describe a recent discovery about animal cell
and DNA structure called Hox genes.  It states that every single animal
that\'s ever been studied for this has been found to contain these
special Hox genes.  While different animals have different numbers of
the genes, all have them, and all Hox genes seem to have a very similar
structure, no matter which animal they\'re found in.

The Hox genes work during the very first days of life causing the single
celled gamete to subdivide in such a way that the animal forms the hands,
feet, eyes, mouth or other distinguishing features appropriate for that
animal.  It\'s no accident that animals are all pretty much symmetric
(e.g. with two hands, feet, etc.) because it\'s controlled by the Hox
genes.

Since these Hox genes are fundamental enough to be found in every
animal on Earth, there\'s also no reason to believe that carbon based
life elsewhere in the universe, based upon the standard Amino acid
building blocks, wouldn\'t have similar Hox genes in their DNA as well.
And so, it\'s not surprising that other life forms would show the same
type of symmetry and otherwise be very much like life on Earth.

If there were other intelligent life in the universe, it shouldn\'t be
surprising for it to be bipedal, erect, with hands, eyes, ears, mouth
and other familiar body parts and functions.  So maybe Star Trek got
it right after all!

   Now, some of these, as you can tell, are pretty cryptic, as are the 
Alegiance codes in some of these sectors. I have no Idea. The worst thing
is, I am trying to binary code these things for space saving purposes, and
I need to know what they are, not just treat them as characters.
   I have gathered that J? is probably Julian Protectorate. V? are usually 
Vargr of some form, although there are so many variations on the code that
I am baffled. Uh is totally meaningless to me. Kl.... Klingon? Nah! :-)
Hv is obviously Hiver. Dr, well, can you say \'Chirper\'?

   Now, I am by no means a librarian, and in the hostile gaming environment
of Nfld, where ordering in at your favorite hobby store does nothing for 
you, I am going mostly on TML articles and FTP scavenging. But, I feel the
need here to ask for info, as I am a little stumped. I am also trying to 
create a mode for generating the nasty little buggers, like the Scout Way
Station. If worst comes to worst, I\'ll wing it (God knows, the prof won\'t
know the difference, Heh, heh, heh).

   Also, I have been tossing the idea around about generating Xboat routes
in this monstrosity that I am contemplating. I figure a good old breadth first
spanning tree algorithm will do the job, but under what conditions does it
make a selection? What do all you sentients out there use as your baseline
assumptions. (And please don\'t say that "Gee, an Xboat route would look 
pretty here!" is your method.)

   I am also contemplating the implementation of an "artificial habitat" in
the generation scheme as an option. Kinda like a do-it-yourself Deep Space 9
or Babylon 5 step. Kinda like a Deep Space Refuelling Depot. Think of it!
Now in specified places in "the claw", there are bases that facilitate the
travel from Gushemege to Deneb without going through Corridor! (Yes, Anthony,
let\'s REALLY throw off game balance!)

   So, if any of you know the information I seek or where to get it, I would
be eternally grateful.

There is a small fleet of \'John Stuart Mills\' class transports
operating between Jewell and Efate.  However, many of these ships
were destroyed during the 5th Frontier War.

All of the above vessels make use of the Calvin class Drop Tanker
(posted a few weeks back) which supplies 50,000 tons of fuel for
the ship\'s jump drives just prior to jump.  Because of the
requirement that the ship must use exacly 50,000 tons of fuel, it
has led to a rather odd variety of hull sizes as the jump range
increases.

As Steve Higginbotham has noted, most bulk transport ships will
primarily jump along preestablished routes.  These transports
require a significant support fleet to keep them in operation:
from the Calvin Drop Tankers to the ships needed to load and
offload cargo.  They travel between heavy traffic class A ports
where such support is available and bulk jump transport is needed.

Some might ask why I used model nine computers in all of the above:
I found that substituting in lower models, along with the increase
in crew and control panels, the cost per kiloliter of carried cargo
was increased despite the lower cost of the computer.

I think you are talking about the Washington Naval Treaty of 1920.  This
was primarily between the nations of Great Britain, the United States,
and Japan.  Other powers signed the treaty, as well, but were not
important players in the negotiations.  The treaty was negotiated to
prevent a costly, unnecessary, and potentially dangerous multi-way naval
arms race, and was fundamentally an arms limitation treaty.

Um, no, sorry.

Immediately prior to the first World War, Admiral Fisher of the Royal
Navy procured the HMS Dreadnought, the world\'s first all-big gun
battleship.  The main armament was a relatively large number (10 I
believe) of identical large guns.  Guns were to fire in salvoe (all
together) so that the fall of the shot could be easily observed, and the
aim corrected.  Having all of the same type of gun made this much easier
(it is quite difficult to estimate which gun fired the shot based on the
size of the splash of a miss, at a range of several thousand yards).

Because ships of this type could effectively engage targets at several
TIMES the effective range of earlier designs, the Dreadnought type of
battleship made all previous designs obsolete.  Subsequent battleships
of this type where called "Dreadnought-Battleships" or simply
"Dreadnoughts".

Admiral Fisher also had another idea: to take approximately the same
armament as a dreadnought-battleship and place it in a lighter, faster
hull.  This was the battlecruiser.  He reasoned that the improved speed
and maneuverability would allow the ship to avoid being hit; thereby
protecting it just as well as the armor of the slower battleship.
Subsequent events were to prove this theory wrong.

The Washington Treaty was a marvel of negotiation (made possible
primarily by the American\'s ability to decrypt and read *everyone\'s*
diplomatic cables).  It provided for a "Naval Holiday" (a moratorium on
new construction), limited the size of each class of vessel, and limited
the number of such ships each nation could have.  In addition, the
maximum size of weapons was specified for each class (to prevent such
abuses as "aircraft carriers" with 12-inch guns).

The Washington Treaty eventually expired, and was replaced by the London
Naval Treaty (which was *not* a marvel of negotiation), and was
generally repudiated starting around 1935. 

During this time the predicted naval amrs race developed.  In the
thirties, gun sizes increased to 15, 16, and 18 inches, armor
protection increased in thickness.  The Americans developed the superfiring
turret (by changing the location of the signting and ranging equipment,
it became possible to mount turrets so that one set of guns fired over
the top of another turret).  Such superfiring dreadnought battleships
became known (logically enough) as superdreadnoughts.  During this time
the speed of the ships increased (better turbines and gearing systems,
more powerfull boilers, and better underwater hull designs) as well.

I call \'em dead meat.  Such ships are designed to be expendable, and are
best employed against larger ships in groups.  The excahnge of severl of
the PTM or PHM class ships (which are cheap, quick and easy to build) in
exchange for an enemy Escort, Destroyer, or maybe Cruiser (even the
smallest of which have costs in the hundreds of millions, and
construction times to match).

Almost.  The Dreadnought fired one gun from each turret in its
"broadside", alternating.  This way the rate of fire of the battery
could be high enough that meaningful corrections could be made.

I also question the description of eight years prior to WW1 (the 
Dreadnought was commissioned in 1906) as "immediately prior to the
First World War", but that\'s just me being picky again... :-)


Will is almost right about the Japs, though.  The ships in question were
several dozen Japanese LIGHT cruisers, which were built so that the 6"
main guns could quickly be replaced by 8" guns.  These changes were made
as soon as the Naval Treaties of the inter-war years broke down, and
gave the Japanese a considerable advantage in numbers of heavy cruisers
in the early part of the war.  Well, it would have been an advantage if
the Japanese had had the same Treaty limits the USA and Britain had. 
Since they were allowed under Treaty considerably fewer heavy cruisers,
what it actually gave them was parity with the USA and Britain much
sooner than was expected when the Naval race got started good.

Immediately prior to the first World War, Admiral Fisher of the Royal
Navy procured the HMS Dreadnought, the world\'s first all-big gun

believe) of identical large guns.  Guns were to fire in salvoe (all

(it is quite difficult to estimate which gun fired the shot based on the
size of the splash of a miss, at a range of several thousand yards).
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here\'s a bit of trivia; 

The construction of an "all big gun" capital ship had gone for a number
of years before the US Congress finally appropriated funds for the con-
struction of a ship of this type. This prompted the British to rush the
\'Dreadnought\' into service (only 17 months until it was launched!) so
that the Royal Navy would be first!
========================================================================

Because ships of this type could effectively engage targets at several
TIMES the effective range of earlier designs, the Dreadnought type of
battleship made all previous designs obsolete.  Subsequent battleships
of this type where called "Dreadnought-Battleships" or simply
"Dreadnoughts".
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Actually the old pre-Dreadnoughts had guns that were just as big. How-
ever they only had 4 while the \'Dreadnought\' had a broadside of 8.
=========================================================================

Admiral Fisher also had another idea: to take approximately the same
armament as a dreadnought-battleship and place it in a lighter, faster
hull.  This was the battlecruiser.  He reasoned that the improved speed
and maneuverability would allow the ship to avoid being hit; thereby
protecting it just as well as the armor of the slower battleship.
Subsequent events were to prove this theory wrong.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There\'ve been numerous stories concerning the "real reason" (tm) that
Lord Fisher conceived the battlecruiser idea. The British had already
been designing cruiser "analogs" of their pre-dreadnoughts for years
before the \'Dreadnought\' so the idea wasn\'t exactly so novel. Also, the
ships were originally assigned to Cruiser Squadrons. (The designation
\'Battle Cruiser Squad\' wasn\'t adopted until Jan \'13.) The idea that
they could "outfight anything they couldn\'t outrun & outrun anything
they couldn\'t outfight" was valid as long as it was observed. The pro-
blem was that since they had the same armament as a \'real\' battleship, 
they were inevitably considered to be the same & were put into the line 
of battle. This is what lead to diaster for them. BTW, the german BC\'s
were built much more ruggedly & proved capable of withstanding consid-
erable damage as shown by the \'Battle of Jutland\'.
======================================================================= 

During this time the predicted naval amrs race developed.  In the
thirties, gun sizes increased to 15, 16, and 18 inches, armor
protection increased in thickness.  The Americans developed the superfiring
turret (by changing the location of the signting and ranging equipment,
it became possible to mount turrets so that one set of guns fired over
the top of another turret).  Such superfiring dreadnought battleships
became known (logically enough) as superdreadnoughts.  During this time
the speed of the ships increased (better turbines and gearing systems,
more powerfull boilers, and better underwater hull designs) as well.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first US \'Dreadnoughts\' had superfiring turrets. I\'ve heard that
the British didn\'t like the idea mainly because it raised the center
of gravity. They *did* eventually adopt the idea though. The US also
never went for wing turrets either. I always thought that the idea of
the "super-Dreadnought" was a reference to the BB\'s that were built
larger than the 35,000t (standard) diplacement treaty limit. Eventually,
it became little more than a popular label. Also, petroleum fueled boi-
lers had alot to do with the increase in speed achieved by 3rd generation
,& some 2nd generation, BB\'s. There was also the question of armor place-
ment theory as far as differences between the \'generations\' are concerned
but I think I\'ve rambled on long enough!

James,

I have decided to sell my Traveller bits. I don\'t know if TML takes adverts,
but if you do, and if you feel that this will interest enough people ( I have
posted the full list already on rec.frp.games.marketplace), could you post

when the built the 6" gunned cruisers that were later converted
to 8" gunned ones because the British & the US did the same thing.
The reason was that the treaties set a limit of 10,000t standard
displacement for cruisers & then set another total tonnage limit
for heavy cruisers which were defined as ships with 8" guns. There
was no total limit on other (light) cruisers other than the 10,000t
displacement limit. It didn\'t take long for someone to realize that
15-6" guns in 5 turrets could put out more weight in shells (the
guns fired faster, BTW) than the 9-8" guns most US heavies carried
& about the same as the 10-8" that the Japanese carried. For the
record the US built 9 of these large "light" cruisers, after we
had built our treaty limit of 8" cruisers, while the Japanese only
built 4. These so-called light cruisers were every bit as large
as the real heavies & armored comparably. The Japanese did con-
vert theirs to 8" guns, of course, but only after the treaties had
expired. The British, on the other hand, built theirs smaller than
their 8" cruisers, to save money, & never really intended them to
be equal. Another interesting point is that both the US, Japan &
Britain used the hulls of capital ships to construct their earlt
a/c carriers. The Japanese, however, made provisions to convert
them back to battleships in case of war. As it turned out, by the
time the treaties had expired & war came, the option was never even
considered.

It\'s time for the second semi-irregular TML Readership Survey.  With Jim
Perkins approval, I thought it might be a good idea to get a cross section
of the TML readership to A) determine the amount of computing power at the
TML\'s collective disposal, B) find out what types of graphics formats folks
can support (for distribution of images), and C) to establish some general
demographic data for statistical purposes.

It will only take a few minutes and some lucky reader will be drawn at
random from the returned surveys to have his/her TML membership renewed
FOR FREE.  The rest of you will just have to pay up when your lifetime
memberships expire. :-)

SERIOUSLY, we are going to have a drawing from among the survey returnees.
One person will be chosen at random to receive ANY gaming product of their
choice (value not to exceed $15.00), which will then be immediately shipped
to them.  This offer is good only on products currently in production, or
available in stock at the Weekend Warrior (a California-based mail-order
company, specializing in out-of-print gaming products).  This offer is also
subject to our ability to actually get the item you want (we have access to
some really excellent gaming stores in the area, but there *are* limits.)
If you\'re not sure, write to me (Mark Cook) and ask.

Please E-mail your completed surveys to either me (markc@hpcvss.cv.hp.com)
or the TML moderator (jamesp@sp-eug.com) (IT\'LL BE LESS WORK FOR JAMES IF
YOU E-MAIL TO ME, AS I\'M GOING TO BE DOING THE SURVEY COLLATING).  If it\'s
less trouble for you, feel free to print out the survey, fill it out by
hand, and mail it to:

    James T. Perkins                         Mark F. Cook

    USA                                      USA

If you\'d rather not answer some of the questions, please fill in as many of
the others as you feel comfortable with and send it in anyway.  Even partial
data will help us to improve the usefulness and functionality of the TML for
everyone.

*** We know that some of you will be doing this for the second time. ***
*** Please fill out and return the survey anyway.  We *really* need  ***
*** the repeat data for a good statistical base.                     ***

Finally, please feel free to append the survey with any comments or
suggestions you might have on how we can improve the TML to serve
you better.

We\'re offering a reasonably long window of opportunity for survey
participants.  All copies of the survey must be submitted by Midnight
PST, Friday, April 2nd, 1993, to be eligible for the prize drawing.
That\'s almost 3 full weeks from now, which should be plenty of time
for E-mail.

This information will be held in the strictest confidentiality and will
not be provided to any other person, organization, or agency without your
specific consent.  It will be used for statistical purposes only, in an
attempt to provide a higher quality of service to the readers of the TML.
As with the last survey (taken a couple years ago), a summary will be
posted to the TML after the data has been collated.

There has been a fair bit of discussion on what the various real world
ship classes mean but I think we need to relate them to the TRAVELLER
universe.

Anybody care to define what each ship class would look like in
TRAVELLER terms (for each tech level).

Final entries could go into the CAT Library Data.

tails all white and clean and shining in the sun.  The drooping
shapely tips of her white wings that press the turgid air to her
heavenly breasts pushing her harder, harder, higher, higher up into
the heady clouds with compression lift at mach three.  A powerful
pack of six YJ93-GE-3 jet turbines thrusting the beautiful,
slender, narrow waisted hull along, penetrating the tenuous air of
the stratosphere, all sipping the 300,000 pounds of JP-6 ambrosia
who\'s raw power pulls the wonderful white virgin to heights

  off the military thread (a very sharp tangent :).  How about
  a discussion of layout concepts for non-human races?

Looking at the designs in Vilani&Vargr, the layout is fairly coventional.
  What about some differences?  Here are some ideas...

  For Hiver ships, since they tend towards \'hives\', the access panels
  and passages would obviously be more like tunnels.  Perhaps the
  ship would even lack an organized bridge, being either a conglomeration
  of the bridge officer staterooms (controls integrated into the stateroom
  computers), say organized in a ring around the main computer core.

  The name \'spinal weapon\' suggests that the ship is basically mounted
  on the weapon.  What about having a cylinderical power plant organized
  in the center of the ship, with the spinal weapon (if any) built
  directly into the power (aka Star Trek (first movie) \'we can\'t fire
  the phasers in the worm hole because they channel directly through
  the warp engines\').

  If the crew members can run their stations from their staterooms,
  the bridge is entirely psychological.  So who needs a bridge?

  On the control side, since there are multiple backup computers on board,
  what if a race decided to have instead each computer control a section
  of the ship (either logical (engineering), or physical (foreward bulkhead).
  Imagine the troubles hijackers might have.

  Or better yet, having ships that are naturally modular in design
  (intended to fragment due to battle damage to facilitate escape/combat).
  Of course, this could exploit the turret limitations rules, unless
  someone wants to try explaining the intent...

Of course, my favorite attempt to add novelty involved jump drive
  technology.  Try explaining this to your players:  Each of
  the 6 jump dimensions is a stable universe.  The reason no natives
  of these universes have been encountered could be
    1)  The location we enter at is located between galaxies
    2)  The average distance between stars is far greater (even in
         a galaxy).

Anyway, none of these suggestions (except one) could really be used
  to disrupt game balance, and might enhance flavor (atleast in all the
  campaigns I\'ve run, the major action happens around star ships
  and tends to involve aliens).  Anyone else have some suggestions/ideas
  which might help me get my GM\'s block rolling again?

The original Traveller rules have method for doing this. I could look it up
for you (no guarantees as to how well it works). It\'s based on distance, and
starport type.

Hi,

the TML is mostly a megatraveller discussion list.  Since I have seen some
interest in 2300ad I though of making a list of people interested in the game
for discussion of its aspects.

I not planning to put up a discussion list but I thought that it would be a
good idea to get together a lis of the names.  That way it would be easier to
discuss new ideas or doubts about the game.

If you people out there like this,please send me your name and email and I\'ll
post it on the TML as soon as possible.

Here\'s an odd observation for you:
Vargr vision is known to be poor perception of color due to the fact that
there are fewer cones (I think) in the canine eye.  The difference being
that they have a greater proportion of rods in their eyes.  Correct?

Also, Vargr are supposed to have poorer night vision than humans.  The
Alien Module says they have an additional -1 to their vision at night
or other low light situations.

BUT, Rods actually are BETTER at detecting light than the color sensitive
cones!  This is why a faint star that is not visible to the human fovea
(where cones are prevalent) *IS* visible to the peripheral vision of the
human eye.  Thus Vargr should have Better low light vision than humans.

Any ideas?

Oh, we also are told, that the bipedal digitigrade stance of the Vargr
and the structure of their foot makes a kicking blow all but
ineffective when made by a Vargr.  That seems to make sence, but consider
what digitigrade bipeds there are.

The only digitigrade biped I can think of, is the Ostrich.  Admittedly,
they\'re a lot larger than a Vargr, but still they Do have a nasty kick!

This is an interesting slip on the part of the rule writers. I do in 
fact believe that Vargr have slightly better night and peripheral
vision than humans, but their depth perception and color vision
suffer.

IMO, they\'re referring to a kick the way a human would kick, by swinging
the leg forward and up. This would be ineffective, it\'s true. However,
a digitigrade stance and powerful haunches make OTHER forms of kicking
EXTREMELY effective. A sweeping roundhouse kick, wheel kick, or simple
rear kick (please don\'t ask me to supply the Japanese terms, it\'s been
years since I set foot in a dojo and I\'m weak and flabby and useless
now) would be even more effective from a Vargr than a human, especially
when the Vargr\'s long, tough hind claws are figured into the equation.
A properly trained Vargr can disembowel an opponent with one sweep
of his hind leg, and kick down doors that would resist most Humans.

Metlay, I think you\'re becoming a little too enamored of your favorite
MT alien race. :^)

Neither of the attributes you describe stand up to close scrutiny,
especially the second.  While a Vargr may have nice sharp claws
(when they\'re barefoot), they can\'t kick as high as a comparably
trained human martial artist, since they\'re a smaller race.  They
also won\'t be able to deliver as much force in the blow, since they
mass less that humans.  Your description would only hold true for
a martial arts-trained Vargr vs. a non-trained human.  The only
thing the Vargr *does* have going for him is that his skin is tougher
than a humans.  Only the Urzaeng Vargr would be exempt from this
size deficiency.

As for kicking down doors, mass becomes even *more* important.  TV
and Movies aside, little guys just aren\'t as good at going through
doors (or walls, speaking from college experience) as big guys,
martial arts training not withstanding.  If you can\'t deliver enough
force against the door, it ain\'t a\'gonna budge.  Now I grant you that
F=m*a, and a Vargr can probably generate more (a)cceleration than a
human.  Whether or not they can move twice as fast (to make up for
being half the mass) is debatable, but there\'s another problem waiting
for them if they do.  Given their smaller frame, they not only have
smaller bones than humans, but they will also be impacting the door
with a smaller surface area (whether it\'s a shoulder, fist, or foot,
it doesn\'t matter).  This means that if the Vargr *is* somehow capable
of delivering the same force to the door as a human, an equal and
opposite force will be directed (by the door) against a smaller cross-
section of the Vargr than it would for a human knuckle-dragger trying
that stunt.  Result?  One Vargr with either broken bones, or a major
tissue avulsion, or both.

Tell the Vargr to bring a battering ram and a couple friends. :^)

The mass of the leg muscles and the amount of torque in the blow
would be at least comaprable to a Human\'s, in my opinion. I\'m not 
saying that a Vargr is superior in this regard, merely that they 
are by no means helpless. The same is true for Aslan, by the way.

>As for kicking down doors, mass becomes even *more* important.

I\'ll grant this. The Vargr bouncing off a locked door has become
too popular as a humorous image in Traveller for me to naysay the
idea now. |->

   In a recent info release about T:TNE, GDW says, "Although we have allowed

never had a GDW-sanctioned Traveller novel."  No other information except that
they are going to do one now.

   My question is just what novels have been written in the Traveller universe
before?  I\'ve seen the reverse.  For example, H. Beam Piper wrote about the
Sword Worlds and Space Vikings years before Traveller Classic came out.
Anybody have a list of post Traveller release fiction written?  Actual,

Has anybody seen a copy of Traveller - New Era in the shops yet?

Our local games store (here in OZ) says he\'s been told to expect them 
any day now so they must already be on sale in the USA and/or UK where
he normally gets them from.

  I stopped by the local gaming shop today and found a GDW
handout about Traveller: The New Era.  It\'s called
`Understanding T:TNE\'.  It has the standard cover art on the
front that we\'ve been seeing for months in Challenge magazine. 
The two inside pages is broken up into four sections:
 
        1. The Thousand-year Imperium is Dead!
 
        2. The Dawn of a New Era
 
        3. The Hard Edges of Space
 
        4. A Different game for a different era
 
  More on these in a bit.
 
 
 
  The back page lists products for T:TNE.  Besides the Core rule
book (due in April according to GDW on the phone last week &
listing for $25 according to the new distributor catalog at the
dealers), GDW has two rule books and two background books in the
works.  Add to this 25mm miniatures from RAFM, `detailed
Traveller starships\' as well.  There will be a Traveller novel
put out by GDW also.
 
  There is one rule book for expanded starship combat.  `useful
for single-ship encounters as well as squadron actions...\'. 
Don\'t worry, basic starship rules are in the basic rule book.
 
   The other rule book is called `The Technical Architecture\'. 
It will provide a layman\'s explanation of the real science
behind the numbers.  Topics covered will include:  acceleration,
gravity, power generation and laser light dispersion.  The book
will also give design sequences for systems not normally found
in Traveller (can you say `Stutter-Warp\'?).  This will allow you
to use GDW House Rules for just about any SF universe.
 
   These two books were not in the catalog I saw.  No release
date or price known at this time.
 
 
 
    The first of the background books is called `Survival
Margin\'.  It\'s the crossover product for MegaTraveller and
T:TNE.  Conversion guidelines are in this one.  It was in the
catalog and listed for $10.  I don\'t remember a release date for
it.
 
    The other is called `Reavers\'.  It\'s about the Hiver backed
Star Vikings (alternate name: `Reavers\').  No date, no price.
 
 
 
     Then they have the boxed set, called `Deluxe Traveller\'. 
Core rules, Technical Architecture and `a variety of playing
aids.\'  Again, no further details.
 
 
 
        Getting back to the four inside sections...
 
 1. The Thousand-year Imperium is dead!
 
    Nothing new here.  The text blurb is the story from the
character generation rules GDW prereleased on Genie.  The one
with the old guy with the `shiny radiation scars\' that `came
flickeringly to life in the dancing firelight.\'
 
 
 
 2. The Dawn of a New Era
 
        "When I hit the Hiver technical curriculum, it was as if Id
come home for the time.  this was where I belonged, and it\'s
where I would have stayed if the first expeditions into The
Wilds had turned out differently.  But all that came later."
 
    Reach out into the Wilds and help your fellow humans back
into space, even if you have prove that you have superior
firepower first. :-)
 
  3.  The Hard Edges of Space.
 
        "When we found out what happened to the crews of those first
ships we send into The Wilds, it was as if everyone went a
little crazy.  Or maybe we all just grew up.  Maybe there isn\'t
a lot of difference.  Veronique had been on one of those ships -
sweet, brilliant, gentle Veronique."
 
   Remember that superior firepower I mentioned?  It is not
pretty out there.
 
   It goes on to talk about the four regions of T:TNE.
 
        1.  The Regency:  The old Domain of Deneb.  No deyos here.  Old
Imperium tech that has been hidden behind a strict quarantine for the last
seventy years.
 
 
 
        2.  Pocket Empires:  That\'s us!  `...isolated islands in a sea
of anarchy.\'
 
 
 
        3.  The Rim:  Hiver backed traders who got smeared by
barbarians (i.e. old Imperials and Solmani) the first time out.  Now they 
`have begun a more vigorous campaign.\'  These are your Reavers or Star 
Vikings.
 
 
        4.  The Wilds:  The rest of the Old Empire.  GDW sums it up
this way..."ruined worlds struggling in ignorance and barbarism.
 On many of these worlds there remains relics of pre-Collapse
technology, and these are used by small ruling elites to force
absolute obedience from the masses of the population, medieval
subsistence agriculture existing side-by-side with grav tanks
and battledress-equipped feudal overlords."
 
 
 
  4. A Different Game for a Different Era
 
        A bit of copy that reads like H. Beam Piper describing a Space
Viking raid on a planet of the old Terran Federation.  Right down to 
mentioning chicken stealing.
 
    It then goes on to tell us that GDW House Rules are much
better than old MT rules and is compatible with TW2K, Dark Con
and the ever popular Cadillacs and Dinosaurs (Hey, I got my
copy!  Never know when I\'ll need the stats for a T-Rex :-}). 
Another plug for the `Traveller Technical Architecture\' book. 
Here they mention by name -- stutterwarp, star gates and matter
tranmitters.
 
 
 
   That\'s all I have.  Has anyone seen the advance release `Demo
Team\' rules yet?

I dunno.  I\'d think that the Hivers are better engineers than that.  They\'d
have a ship laid out on what was most efficient for them.  I don\'t think
tunnels make for very efficient movement.  Also, just because they lived
in \'Hives\' way back before they were intelligent does not mean that they
are an integral part of their layouts today.  I don\'t think HUMANS could
do so well without a bridge (see below) but Hiver\'s *might* concievably do
so.

:-P  If you have a power plant, why use it to ONLY power the weapons?
It would be different if we were using the engines to generate electrical
power, but in the case of Trav ships, we are using a power plant to
genereate electical power, and that to power the engines.  There is no
direct connection as there is in a car, or aircraft.  Nuclear sub is
closer, but I don\'t know if they use electric motors.  (Steve?)

Yes, you Could do away with a bridge, but it would increase the reliance
on super efficient intercom systems to make up for the loss of the bridge.
It is a lot easier for HUMANS to communicate quickly face to face than it
is over any other media.  Consider all the information that is conveyed
by facial expression, tone of voice, etc.  Now you\'d have to transmit all
that on the com lines from stateroom to stateroom.

It is MUCH more efficient psychologically, and equipment wise to have
all your officers in one spot to help make decisions as quickly as
possible.  Think combat environment.  How are you gonna collaberate on
tactics if you gotta send your message through channels?

No.  There are three computers aboard ships running in parallel.  They
are not working on separate tasks.  The three systems check answers against
each other and then act.  If one system, fed the same data as the other two,
consistantly disagrees with the others it is considered faulty and shut down.
That is how it works in the X-29 computer assisted fly by wire systems.
(I\'ll bet the F-117 uses a similar system)

All the computers are tightly linked.  Take over one, and you\'ve gotten
all three.

>   Or better yet, having ships that are naturally modular in design
>   (intended to fragment due to battle damage to facilitate escape/combat).

Which would require heavy redundancies, raising cost and reducing effieincy
of systems.  Each module would have to have it\'s own drives, computers, and
controls.  As a craft design it would be a real mess to handle.  It *IS*
covered by the MegaTrav design system, but I think between Rob Dean and me,
we\'ve only done about 3-4 such designs (Low tech staged rockets & spacecraft)
The reason we\'ve produced so few is that they are a royal pain.

He must be working from an obsolete catalog, then, because GDW is still
uploading early versions of the playtest files to GEnie, which leads me
to believe that the game is still at least three months from being 
published, and most likely even more.

   Someone asked about the Traveller:The New Era release date.  Here is the
data I have on the subject.

	2.  I spoke with the local RPG dealer, who was at a dealers convention

There haven\'t been any recognizably Traveller-Imperium books that I
know of in publication; I can\'t imagine GDW would have allowed such a
copyright violation to occur without making SOME noise, and I can\'t
imagine such a book getting out without the TML echoing with critiques
and so on.

As for "fluff," there\'s always MY fiction (the Grant stories and Near
Miss).  Parts of the Near Miss book (all but the final section) have
been finished for years, but GDW\'s people to whom I spoke on that
subject (hi Loren) were at the time very polite but firm in their
intention not to publish books, and I never pursued the matter any
further.  Besides, it\'s set in the Trav Classic universe, and it
wasn\'t ready to go before the MegaTraveller mindset-shift, so the
point was moot. I have some bits of it online, but nothing I\'m
ready to hand out for free just yet.

I\'d like to publish some Traveller fiction one of these days, but it\'s
low on my priority list right now for reasons that will become very
obvious very soon <dark hint>. When I do get around to writing T:TNE
fiction for possible publication, it will probably be within the 
context of another piece I\'m putting together for GDW....

What I\'m hoping to do with respect to T:TNE is to follow the course
recommended by Loren several months ago, specifically to allow the
game a chance to get established and then put forward an outline for a
sourcebook on the Traveller-Classic Universe, i.e. a sort of civilized
economic/corporate/cultural/aristocratic "warfare" game set in the
Third Imperium of 1120, where Strephon has foiled an assassination
attempt but has suddenly realized that he is not in as firm control of
the Imperium as he should be. At this stage, I have a tentative "yes"
from a potential co-author, about whom I won\'t say more until he or
she agrees to dive in headfirst and the project gets a go-ahead from
GDW. We hope to market a more workable economics system, a simplified
ship design system that gets rid of "advances" like thruster plates, and
some well-developed cultural and political background for the various
hotspots of interest around the Imperium: Antares, Vland, the Solomani
Buffer Zone, and so on. I plan to pursue this project vigorously with
GDW, in the hopes of providing a worthwhile sourcebook for those users
who have a huge investment in old Traveller materials and would like a
more modern framework in which to put their old adventure and library
data modules to use. We\'ll keep you posted.

This morning I called GDW ((309)452-3632 - US phone #), and enquired as
to whether Traveller: The New Era was shipping yet.  The woman who answered
the phone said no, it wasn\'t shipping yet.  Then I asked when it was
expected to ship.  She said mid to late-April.  Take it for what it\'s
worth.

Personally, I\'ve got mixed emotions about T:TNE.  Forget about all the hoaky
explanations they\'ve presented about a silicon eating virus etc etc.  I\'m 
concerned about all the rule changes.  All their adds hype their \'new\'
GDW \'house rules\' stuff.  So your Twilight:2000 character can join up
with some Dark Conspiracy yo-yos and \'jump\' into Traveller for a few go-rounds.

Well, this one\'s been batted around before, but I\'m going to let off some
steam... One of the first things I do when I look at a combat-oriented 
RPG or one that uses combat a lot, is to read the damage rules in the 
combat section and see if they \'feel\' reasonable and if they\'re easy to use
and if they\'re properly deadly.  I thought the original 1st Ed T:2K did an
ok job, and I looked forward to GDW fixing it up, making it better, and
fixing the obvious gaffes such as GI Joe shooting Ivan with a .45 point
blank in the chest and Ivan smiles back and says, "May I have another?"

Well, I got Traveller: 2300 and though the combat system seemed strange 
at first, the more I thought about it, the more it made sense.  Perhaps
a bit simplistic, it seemed, nevertheless, to be very quick to play, and
_very_ deadly.  Then T:2K (2 Ed) came out, and I quickly flipped to the
damage part of the rules, and was very disappointed!  Now Ivan can take
like 2 or 3 shots of .45 point blank in the chest.  Even the max possible
damage from a .45 won\'t knock an average man unconscious, let alone kill
him!  (In case you haven\'t noticed, I use a .45 or similar caliber
automatic pistol as my measuring rod.)  Now T:TNE will be come equally
wimpy so some snot nosed kid used to Cyberpunk won\'t have his character
blown away.  Sheez!  As I was admonished as I joined the PBEM, combat
in Traveller is DEADLY!  and is to be avoided!  it is a last resort!  Well
not anymore!  Hey, We can shoot \'em up!  A few holes in your body?  Hey,
never you mind!  it\'s ok!  This is Traveller:  The _NEW_ Era.  Yeah, right.

Anyways, I\'ll have to see if it\'s really going to be as bad as it sounds.
Oh, well.

Ok, now that I\'ve blown off steam... I\'m working on a drop-in damage
system for personal combat (i.e. smaller than vehicle vs vehicle) for 
Traveller and MegaTraveller.  If it works, I think it should be easily
adapted to replace the GDW House Rules small arms damage etc.

Basically, my rules give hit location and damage to the hit location.  For
example, Joe shoots at Fred with a Gauss rifle.  He hits (he scores!) Fred
with 3 needles in the left leg (Ref says the thigh.)  One needle is only
a flesh wound, the second one shatters his thigh bone, and the third one
just generally rips up his flesh.

There are three basic rolls, more as optional rules are used, and
some very simple arithmetic:  a few additions/subtractions and one multiply
(i think only one - like 2*8 or 4*10, NOT 2.35*7.345). The first 
roll is to hit, the second one is to see where you hit, and 
the third one is to see how much damage you did.  This whole
 system is designed to be fuzzy.  There are no \'hit points\'.  Just 
probablilities that a weapon of such and such a damage class will
kill/wound/maim a character of such and such a Life Force.  Also the
Ref is free to abridge/amend what happens as s/he sees fit: i
t\'s up to the GM to use his/her imagination to determine what 
happened.  My rules would be there to lend some framework/structure 
to the madness.  

If you like the way the combat works in classic Trav or MT, there\'s no
need to use my rules.  If on the other hand, one wants to see legs
and arms blown off and guts spilled out, my rules may be useful.

They\'re supposed to \'drop right in,\' so if a ref just wanted to use
them to add some additional color commentary to the fight, they should
suffice.  In other words, my rules would still have a pen/dam of 2/3
for a 9mm auto pistol, and 20/3 for a laser rifle-13.  On the other
hand, I\'m trying to work out some coherent rules if someone wants
to revamp the Traveller / MT weapons for their own campaign or adapt
them to another system.  If they work, they should also be able to 
be modified to replace the T:2K house rules.  

Anyways, is anyone interested?  I\'m hoping to have a rough draft done
this week or next and could post it here for comments... Any bites?

The miniatures of both types would be welcome, as long as they don\'t try
to make the people look like refugees from Warhammer:40K, with "chain swords"
and guns as big as their heads, in all sorts of spiky bits of armor.

Regarding starships:  I have been nursing the germ of a project for a couple
of months.  Has anyone else seen the SpaceMat decorated felt sheets with 
hexagons sold by GeoHex?  How about the "Silent Death" miniatures?  Dis-
regarding the intended scale, several of the Silent Death ships struck me
as having "traveller-esque" lines to them, and if I can find a pictorial
catalog and a mail order supplier (help?), I\'ve been considering putting
together a Mayday miniatures game, for conventions or whatever.  I figure
I\'d use 3 castings to represent each ship--one decorated, for current 
position, one painted white for future position, and one painted black for
previous position...

That\'s not surprising.  At Origins in \'91, the GDW team was happy to
tell everyone who wanted to know that Piper is/was a primary influence
on Traveller.  Remember back that far?  Space Vikings (Or was it Star
Vikings?) was going to be a set of miniatures rules for planetary looting
raids, which was going to come with (plastic?) miniatures in the box.
Oh well...it\'s hard to keep track of all the projects that have fallen
through the cracks at GDW.

Yes and no, Scott.  Part of the reason is that they are annoying, and 
another part is that there isn\'t much use for them in adventures, since
I\'m nowhere near running a Hard Times campaign.  Apart from a few designs
to try out a system, I like to design things that I expect that I might use
in an adventure. (-:

What\'s the Traveller equivalent of a Star Wars Blaster?  Is there one?
(Has this question been booted around before? - I couldn\'t find it in
TOC.1 or TOC.2 on sunbane.  Is there a TOC.3?)

Is a Blaster just a pulse laser?  Or is it more like a plasma/fusion
gun (pgmp / fgmp)?  If so, I don\'t think such a thing exists in
Traveller below TL16.  At TL16, there was mention of a Plasma Rifle.
Would this be the same thing as a blaster rifle?

Do people consider the Star Wars universe to be incompatible with
the Traveller universe (the Force not withstanding)?  I know they
have \'hyperspace\' and we have \'jumpspace\', but are they so different?

If not, what would one consider the TL of the Star Wars Empire / Rebellion
to be?  TL16?  17?  18?  I don\'t think they can transmit matter yet, so
there is a limit on what they can do.  I don\'t know if their power 
sources have been discussed all that much in the movies/books on Star
Wars... Anyone got a clue as to whether it is fusion or anti-matter
based?  I\'d guess fusion.

Yes, but the question was about high tech modular designs (TL 15 I assume)
And there, the modular designs might be more usable, but they would be more
costly because of the heavy redundancies involved.  This makes merchant
ships more expensive (plus, they couldn\'t enter atmosphere anyway).  And
while Ten 10-ton fighters might be joined together to get a 100 ton ship
with 10 turrets, it would be more vulnerable than it would be as individual
components.  Weleded together, one hit would wipe out the 10 fighters at
once, while individually, it would take 10 such hits to take out a squadron.

So, from neither mercantile nor military point of view, does it add up.

I had not considered a TL15 modular design before.  Hmmmm...I would need
to think about it for a while before dismissing it.  For merchant usage,
I think that you are correct--redundancy would be too expensive (by the 
rules, I mean, of course), but for figthers, I don\'t know.  The current
damage rules for spacecraft are just a slightly revised version of High
Guard, as you know, and are not set up to handle some of the more exotic
things that we can think of.

BTW, why couldn\'t it enter the atmosphere?  As long as it has more that 1G 
of lift, it ought to be able to fly, albeit slowly.

Turret limits.  Got to think about turret limits one of these days.  The rules
might work without them, _IF_ we knew how missiles worked.  (If missiles need
continual guidance from the launcher, then the number that can be fired is
limited by the number that can be controlled, otherwise the number that can
be fired is limited only by the cost of the missiles.  In the former case,
ship designs could dispense with the turret limits for game balance puposes,
since there would be some sort of balance between increasing power requirements
for energy weapons and increasing control requirements for missiles, but in the
latter case, a High Guard/TCS style campaign would have to consider the cost
of resuplly in order to remain balanced.)  

Pardon my rambling...

Consider:  Ten 10-ton hulls (plus the spine to mount them on) will cost
and weigh more than a single 100-ton hull.  Also, for carrying cargo,
there will be more space wasted in 10 small cargo bays than in one large
one.  Economically it\'s bad news.   (But we already agree on that one)

Well, I would say that a group of modular hulls acting as a unit would have
to be treated as one unit damage wise.  Consider:  A nuclear warhead hits
a ten 10-ton hulls vs. a single 100-ton hull.  Not a big difference damage
wise.  But you\'re quite right.  The current damage system wouldn\'t cover it.

It would HAVE to fly slowly.  As the rules see it, unstreamlined ships are
not capable of flying in an atmoshere.  To my mind, they could.  So the
compromise is that they could with a LOT of trouble.  Now for modular ships
to do so would require some kind of ultra heavy duty docking locks for the
modules.  Now, if these babies can stand up to the thrust of the engines,
they should be able to stand under their own weight.  But getting them to
do so would require such structural reinforcement that any saving in
construction (if any there be) would be lost by the buttresses required.

I don\'t think that the vast forces of the Imperium, the Zhos, the Aslan,
K\'Kree, Hiver, Droyne... etc. etc. will all be using the same system of
missile guidance.

Some will used robotic seeker heads, some will used semi-active seeker heads,
active seeker heads, passive seeker heads...  The US now commonly uses four
types of air to air missiles, three of which use different types of seekers.
From what we are given, we have to assume that the traveller missiles are
an average of all the possible types.

However, what *I* guess is that since the standard (Book 2) description of
a missile rack sez three missiles per rack, I assume that each rack has
three long range maser communicators.  (That 750,000 Cr per has to go
toward SOMETHING).  Thus a battery can launch three salvoes of missiles and
keep all under control.  It would be possible to have more missiles under
control but would cost more.

Now, the missiles themselves cost about 20,000 Cr.  Using the old system of
missile rocket engines & fuel, there\'s not a lot left over for electronics
but some.  Still, a maser comm (even a short range one) costs close to
20,000 Cr.  Thus only a reciever can be present.

IMO, The missile\'s trajectory is calculated by the ship\'s computer, fed into
a simple electronic head and fired.  Mid course corrections are sent to the
missile via maser comm.  Finally, in the missile\'s terminal phase, it is
coming in on a precalculated trajectory designed to surprise the targets
defencive batteries.  A very small onboard computer takes it through the
targets defences and explodes the warhead.

Missiles get a +1 for long range and a -1 for short range.  (Rules)
This must be because the missiles are harder to detect at longer ranges.
If you don\'t see them being launched and track them till you can fire at
them, you don\'t have a lot of chance to avoid them or engage them with
counter battery fire.

Also, the longer the range they are fired from, the more the missiles will
be able to diverge and approach the target from unexpected angles.  Then
the counter batteries only get a few shots at the missiles during the VERY
short interval after they are detected and before they hit.

Make any sence?

Haven\'t seen the hex sheets but I do have a few Slient Death figures.  The
figures are pretty good and some would fit into a trav game quite well.
Silent Death also contains some of the nicest printed hex sheets I\'ve seen
so why not use them?  I don\'t remember seening a photo catalog for these
figures :-( and my local mail order places would be useless to you :-( :-(

I have this dim memory of Bertil\'s Rebel Guard ship combat system using
some kind of mayday movement system.  I could easily be wrong becuase I don\'t
have the rules anywhere near me but for some reason my mind links the
two systems (then again, maybe I\'ve taken too many hits to the head in
the past couple of years).


Finally about modular ships:

Designing them would be a bit of a pain but they would be cute in a battle.
Well a big ship would be, I have to agree that I\'d treat 10x10 Ton ships
as a single thing in combat.  But what about 1000x100 Ton ships?
There\'d have to be a gradual degradation of capability as the individual
\'cells\' was rendered inoperable.  I doubt it would be cost or space
efficient due to the huge redundancy required.  Anybody care to design one
of the Borg\'s ships in MT ??? :-)

It fires a bolt which glows, which explodes when it hits something, and which
you can see moving.  I\'d guess that makes it a plasma weapon of some sort.  I
believe a plasma pistol was described in some Traveller publication, but I can
not remember where.

A primitive laser with a back-pack power supply was described in one of Brian
Daley\'s books about Han Solo, if I remember correctly. ;-)

Try building an X-wing using MT rules, complete with hyperspace/jump drives,
and 4 lasers plus a power plant which can drive them and its manouevre drive
at the same time.  Don\'t forget the deflector shields and the proton torpedoes.
When you\'ve done that, try to figure out to the nearest millisecond how long a
Star Destroyer would last against something with a meson gun, factor T. ;-)

That\'s my guess as well, judging by the Star Wars RPG.

I just called GDW and asked them about this and other things.

My questions and the answers are:

1) Has GDW gone bankrupt or bust?

No.  They are still in business.

2) Do you have any idea how this rumour could have gotten started?

No.

3) When will Traveller : The New Era  come out?

Mid to Late April.

NOTE:  My own observations have seen GDW say one month and end up putting
it out 4 months laters.  I\'ll believe it when I see it.  However, the demo
teams are supposedly getting packs fairly soon.

4) Are you still putting out Dangerous Journeys ?  (Personally, I don\'t
like the game, but since it might be of interest to a few people, I asked.)

Yes.


5) What happened to your 800 number?  (toll free long distance number for
those people in the US.   I used regular long distance.) 

We no longer have that service. 


Once again, GDW is still in business.
This should dispell a lot of rumors.

I spoke to someone in customer service.  She was very pleasent, but I
didn\'t get her name.  Their number is:309-452-3632.

I believe the primary effect is from the radiation wave.  I think it\'s best
to look at it as a very small sun lighting up briefly right next to your
target.  Unless the hull provides incredible radiation shielding and heat
dissipation you have a dead ship.

Well, the whole story is:

  I dug up what I had and sent it to Mike and Mark, to see if they
  wanted to sanitize anything I release, since it\'s still fairly fresh
  in the minds of some characters.  I haven\'t heard anything back yet,
  so I\'m being a good boy and holding on for a little while rather than
  try to sanitize them myself.

  Therefore, if you are playing in the PBEM, you can\'t have them
  till next season, unless Mark or Mike specifically tells me is OK.
  However, if you are not now playing in the PBEM (or if You are Alan
  Husscroft, John Kim, or Carl Fago--to whom I am deeply indebted for
  most of the material--you can have them as soon as I find them again


So, if anyone wants them (I still have three requests in my in basket),
just send me a note telling me you are not playing in the PBEM.  I\'ll
then send them to you.

If I or Mike or Mark spots fraud, we of course have even nastier
surprises waiting for you in the game.... :=)


Oh -- one last thing.  Under the rules we adopted when creating these,
the Archives are free use for TML members, friends, family, etc.  If you
want to use them "seriously", or send parts in to GDW or something, then
you need to talk to the four of us mentioned above.  Alan and John own
the copyright on most of the material.

I think you\'re right about this, but I was actually looking for a simple 
plug in armor rule for Mayday, which is only set up for small unarmored
ships at the moment.  I don\'t want to add 100kt meson gun ships right now,
but I would like to add something like a 400 ton close escort with an 
armored hull.

Probably some sort of saving throw based on armor level would be the way to
go...

Recreating Star Wars using Traveller is a matter of making a number of
decisions regarding translation.  My inclination would be to treat the
Star Wars blaster as a laser pistol, and the Force as straight psionics.
It\'s the light saber that is hard to translate, since I can\'t come up
with a good explanation for it that doesn\'t involve force field tech
that Traveller doesn\'t have.

If you really want me to, I will, (-:, but I was under the impression that
fighters didn\'t have hyperspace drives.  In any case, you could either do it
as a 100 ton fighter, or adopt 2-G Scott\'s suggestion that you permit the
minimum sized jump drive to be installed in any hull, limited only by
volume.  Call the deflector shield a sandcaster, and the proton torpedo
a nuclear missile, and you\'re all set. (-:  But seriously, as I said above,
most of the action in Star Wars could be replayed in Traveller with only a 
few minor modifications to the technology as depicted in the movies.  I don\'t
think that anything really critical to the plot hinges on the mechanics of
Star Wars universe, unlike something like Dune, say, where the use of the
Guild Navigators and personal shields are both important to the plot and
not terribly adaptable to Traveller.

Spoil sport.  They\'re easy to add.  Danger space of half the map, don\'t miss
very often, destroy what they hit. (-: (-:

I know it isn\'t realistic, but what about something along the lines of battle
tech or SFB where you color in lots of circles as your armour is spent? :-)

I think some kind of saving throw would be a better alternative, or maybe
some form of damage reduction based upon the degree of penetration (kind of
like MT personal combat or silent death damage reduction factors).  This is
a smaller leap of faith for the players than the fill the boxes methods.

	I really prefer not to *try* to mix these sorts of genres.
Traveller, as fantastic as it is, has a much different feel to it than
Star Wars.  Perhaps I\'ve been in the PBEM too long, but for me,
Traveller has greater versimilitude.

	Not that hard.  The light saber is, essentially, ancient technology
in the hands of a small religious sect, powered (if I recall correctly) by
the psionic energy of the user (aka The Force).  Light sabers in Star Wars
weren\'t something you could pick up down at the corner Sears.  They were
legendary in their ability to penetrate whatever you stuck \'em in, only the
jedi had \'em, and the jedi built their own.

I\'d agree about the Force/psionics - in fact, didn\'t one of the old Traveller
supplements have a UPP and description for Darth Vader?  Maybe you could put
the visible, exploding bolts which move as you watch them down to artistic
license or Hollywood ignorance. :-)

Once you\'ve got proper deflector shields, my guess is that a light sabre is
just a high power laser plus a deflector shield to restrict the beam.  Of
course, someone is going to have to make some major advances in power
technology in order to have a laser that powerful with a power cell that is
held in the hand, rather than worn on the back.

Guess who hasn\'t seen "Return of the Jedi"? ;-)  Imperial fighters don\'t have
hyperspace drives, but Rebel fighters do.

The former option would make for a very large X-wing.  In Star Wars, "fighters"
means fighters, at most the size of present day fighters.  A 100 ton ship is
about the size of a decent airliner.

There are two problems with sandcasters.  (A) When an X-wing switches its
deflectors to the rear, you don\'t tend to see a big cloud of dust behind
it.  (You tend to see a big cloud of dust *instead* of it if the reason for
putting your deflector there is Darth Vader\'s TIE fighter. :-)  (B) Sand
does not stay with you when you turn, which makes it useless for fighters
which engage in the dogfighting seen in "Star Wars".

Nothing especially critical to the plot, apart from light-sabres, dogfighting
fighters and weapons which can destroy entire planets with one shot. ;-)

However in my games..I did what Rob dean suggested.  The lightsabre
became a monofilament which conducted plasma via an intense magnetic
bottle similar to fusion power plants..remember even in SW the
lightsabre was a bit of arcane technology.

Xwing...no problem...Ywing less so...Awing  easy.  Of course you
have to extrapolate the jump drive table to minimal sizes and ignore
the \'minimum size for a jump drive rule\'
4 lasers no worries....the screens are divided into two categories
ray screens and matter screens....the first is essentially an energy
discharge plate and the second is an advanced magnetic/force field.

The technology of SW is ahead of Traveller but the base principles
are the same.

Traveller Ships are limited by some bad rules..one problem I have is
wondering the optimum size of power plant for my ships as the
examples they give are few and far between.

True. So? Earth is TL8 and there are people eating badly cooked meat
next to fires and dying of smallpox. As has been argued here many
times before, the TL of a world is its MAX TL, not what the hoi polloi
get. You can bet that the rulers of Pallique have it cushy, but the
same may not be true of the workers.

It has. Kill malcontents and put their organs in cooperative people.
Gets rid of the malcontents and stigmatizes the survivors so they
won\'t try to escape (people escape from prison all the time, but who
ever ran away from a leper colony?). It pays to remember that these
are not taxpaying citizens of a democracy or unruly serfs of an
autocracy that must maintain appearances before the Duke. These are
criminals, whose exile is a polite death sentence and who are not
expected to ever leave.

Yeah. So? The powers that be LIKE it this way. You can make a headache
go away with an incredibly expensive anaesthetic, or you can give a 
guy an Advil. Why spend more on treatments that take a long time when
you can have a guy back to work quicker and cheaper? On Newcomb in the
Solomani Rim, they let cancer victims die. That\'s REALLY cheap, but the
death rate balances the influx, which wouldn\'t be the case on Pallique.

You\'re not kidnapping donors, you\'re obtaining parts. Parts is parts.
And I\'d argue that it\'s a lot cheaper to shoot someone full of
antirejective than to grow him a spiffy new liver in a tank for
several weeks or months that he may not have to play with. You can
postulate clean, simple organ cloning a la Star Trek for your Trav
campaigns-- I prefer a drug that stops rejection and the lung they
just pulled out of that healthy young jaywalker down the street.

*BZZZT* Got yerself here, kiddo. You\'re applying TL7-8 costs and 
science to the economics of transplants. I would argue that when and
if the human race licks AIDS, it will have invented drugs that will
LAUGH at tissue rejection, or at least be well on the way to that
point. You won\'t even need sterility in some cases; gangrene and
peritonitis will be as common then as bubonic plague is now.

If you have them.

Scott, your arguments are valid and well-reasoned for a society that 
actually gives a damn about providing the best healthcare for its 
citizens in the long run and therefore improving their morale and
productivity. The picture you paint would be perfectly accurate on
Mora or Trin, or even on Regina. But on Pallique, it\'s a whole new
ballgame, because no one WANTS the workers to be happy or cheerful.
They\'re being PUNISHED. If they DIE, they DESERVE it. The Imperium
does not, to my knowledge, have a Constitution or a Bill of Rights,
and these criminals do not have a right to the best treatment money
can buy-- they are PRIVILEGED to receive CHEAP treatment that will
keep them alive long enough to do a decent lifetime\'s work. It\'s an
ugly truth that rarely surfaces in polite company on Trin or Mora
or anywhere else in the sector; criminals are swept under the cosmic
rug.

But the Rebellion\'s likely to change all that. Just imagine what\'s
gonna happen when the Lakht Aorlakht decides to claim Pallique\'s
riches for the ihatei and wants a solid base of popular support
in-system! |->

Urg.  I believe that the listed TL is referred to as the High Common.
ie.  The TL that Is generally available to the masses.  But I may be
mistaken.  That\'s how *I* call it any how.  That\'s supposed to explain
how a TL 4-5-6 planet has a class A or B starport.  Thus IMGO, a TL 14
planet should have very nearly TL 14 medicine.

TL 12.  Also, they\'d be a lot cheaper than the equivalent amount of
shielding for the population.  O \'course you could explain that away by
sayin\' that the screen only partially covers the prison parts of the
colony.   But I\'d say it would be cheaper to service a nuc damper than
to serve 3 Billion cancer patients.

Rm?  No bill of rights?  You sure?  What about the (much abused)
thing that sez all sophonts have the same rights?  The thing that
made all the mess when cyborgs got classified as machines.
(wish I had da books, sigh)

Ok, we got a population of three BILLION criminal deportees.  A little
more than half what Earth\'s current total population.  GEEZ!  What\'s
the LAW level on Trin & Mora?  And who are the judges that pack \'em off?

Ok, let\'s try some back of the envelope calculations here.  (Now
that I\'m home and have my books :-)  All right.  Now, think about
an operation to transplant healthy tissue into replace cancerous
tissue.  Major surgery?  In my opinion, yes.  Major surgery in
Traveller costs 1000 Cr X 1D.  So an average of 3000 Cr (MT
Player\'s Manual).

Let\'s do something weird and say that on Pallique the surgery is so
common that it cost as much as a minor operation, Ok?  So:  500 Cr
X 1D.  About 1500 Cr average.  Wow!  No price gouging the
prisoners!

Now, if 20 operations are about right for an \'old timer\' lets guess
these old-timers are about 60  (I doubt they\'d live that long under
the conditions stated, but let\'s go for it.)  So:  1 operation
every 3 years.  3 Billion population:  1 billion operations per
year.  So *PART* of Pallique\'s medical budget is 1.5 Trillion
credits per year.  Let\'s say an additional 200 Cr per person goes
to cancer preventative treatment (It\'ll save money to prevent
rather than operate).

Total:  2.1 Trillion Credits.  Now that\'s quite a medical budget.

With that much money floating around, I\'d bet some shrewd megacorp
business types with hand computers and pocket protectors are gonna
want in on this business.  How do they get in?  Well, import in the
high tech medical stuff and sell it off.  The higher the technology
it is, the more efficient it is, therefore the greater profit for
the twerps with the pocket protectors.

Suppose you got a cancer cure serum that was less than 1500 cr per
dose.  Say 10 cc\'s per dose.  Well, if you need 1 billion doses per
year, that works out to 741 shipping tons per year.  Easily handled
by a free trader.  And if the trader made 1 cr profit per dose,
he\'d be ROLLING in dough by the end of a year.  :-)

Ok.  Now, let\'s take a look at it from the Imperial Government
point of view.  3 Billion inhabitants.  And I believe you mentioned
none of them paid taxes?  (According to Trillion Credit Squadron)
In terms of Naval budgets that\'s 4.5 TRILLION credits that is NOT
going into the Naval coffers.  Is the Navy gonna stand for that?
Is Duke Norris gonna stand for that?  He\'s the one who\'s supposed
to be the kind hearted soul.  Is he gonna sit around while those
people are:
1)   Being mistreated
2)   Not paying taxes!!!  :-)

Bad example, Mike.  The World Health Organization declared Smallpox
eradicated in 1977.  However, you can substitute Typhus, Cholera,
Diphtheria, or number of other nasty diseases for the same effect.

As for the rest of the argument, I (of course) agreee with you.
Convincing Scott is another matter all together.

Nope, more like 300 Cr a pop. Pallique as I run it (note that the
scenario was designed for my campaign, and was originally only
intended for Rob Dean, and if I had known what a headache it would be
explaining my reasoning in terms of the idiotic rules for medical
treatment I never would have posted it to the TML) has very cheap
medicine, primarily because the allowable failure rate is so high.
So cut your number by five.

>Now, if 20 operations are about right for an \'old timer\' lets guess

Nope, that\'s a rare maximum. In 60 years, most people don\'t need
more than three or four. Say four. That\'s one per 15 years. Cut
your number by five again.

>.  Let\'s say an additional 200 Cr per person goes

Try 50. The primary aid of the high TL is in keeping things cheap.
So that\'s not 2.1 TCr a year, but more like 80 GCr a year, prefectly
manageable by a population that sacrifices most of its income to taxes
(what makes you think that these people don\'t pay taxes?) and generates
huge income directly into the coffers of Mora and Trin (and indirectly
to Regina, Deneb, and Capital). This may be a lowball number, but the
order of magnitude is about right. Again, this is for MY campaign,
and I had described the world for informational purposes only....

Not allowed. The Trinni and Moran governments restrict trade and 
access to Pallique itself, and are not shy about blowing up smugglers.
(Part of the reason Pallique is Amber is because many shrewd business
types with hand computers and pocket protectors who don\'t study their
system history carefuly enough end up as expanding clouds of photons
without ever seeing their prospective clients.)

This isn\'t a profitable, workable system to the economic types out
there. Neither was the Soviet Union under Stalin, but it didn\'t 
collapse in a puff of logic. And unlike Stalinist Russia, Pallique
is condoned and accepted by its neighbors and has no need for a
large defense outlay... at least it didn\'t before the Aslan came 
along. |->

    'body' => '  O.K., I\'ve picked up Survival Margin.  It makes an interesting
  read, even though most of it is Traveller News Service re-feeds.  
  There\'s an explanation of how the Regency (the new name for the 
  Domain of Deneb) managed to prevent itself from becoming 
  virus-fodder when almost all of the rest of Charted Space got 
  eaten.  There\'s a problem with said explanation:

  I\'ll grant that the routes across the Rift (the Aslan J5 route 
  and the Imperial J6 route using a couple of undocumented fueling 
  stations) could be blocked at their choke points, preventing 
  infection from the main portion of the Aslan Hierate.  I\'ll even 
  accept that the Regency could choke off traffic coming around the 
  Rift through Corridor sector.  BUT...

  There\'s no natural barrier like the Rift anywhere coreward of the 
  Imperial/Vargr border.  I would think that, given the fractious 
  nature of Vargr society, it would be in practice impossible to 
  establish a "sterility line" (sealed border) anywhere in the 
  extents.  This requires that the Regency border with the Extents 
  be sterilized.  Which would appear to logically require more man- 
  and ship-power than the Regency could reasonably expect to have 
  available.  

  The Zhodani Consulate has a similar problem.  Worse still, 
  there\'s no barrier to prevent the virus from making an "end-run" 
  around the entire Consulate, and therefore coming into the states 
  in the sectors spinward of the Regency, _from_ spinward.  Which 
  means that the Zhodani Consulate must seal its borders 
  _all_the_way_around_the_Consulate_.  A massive undertaking, and 
  one that even the Imperium in its heyday probably could not have 
  handled.  

  Similar comments can be made about the Sword Worlds, the Border 
  Worlds, the Darrian Confederation, the Federation of Arden, and 
  the non-aligned worlds in Spinward Marches.  Even if all of these 
  states  engage in _full_ cooperation, there is not going to be 
  sufficient tonnage or crews to seal the borders.  

  Certainly, dropping the transponder systems will help, as will 
  the isolated-computer-for- -communications idea.  But I\'m not 
  convinced that these measures would be enough.  Not to mention 
  the time that would be needed to actually implement them in 
  either the Regency or the Zhodani Consulate.

  In short, I don\'t see that the Spinward States could escape the 
  Virus.  I\'m barely willing to accept that the Hive Federation 
  could recover from it in the short order postulated, given the 
  importance that they attach to a uniform gene pool, hence the 
  importance of maintaining some sort of interstellar travel 
  network.  And given the assumed higher level of computer 
  expertise hinted at throughout the published Traveller material 
  since day one of Classic Traveller.  But I don\'t see the Spinward 
  States escaping it.  The best I can see is that it would hit them 
  later than it would the rest of the Imperium, so they wouldn\'t 
  have fallen as far.  But the same statement could be made about 
  the K\'kree (who were trashed by the Virus, by implication), or 
  about the Aslan (who are explicitly noted as not having the 
  uniformity of computer systems that the Imperium, the Vargr 
  Extents, the Hivers, and the K\'kree all allegedly had).

  Comments, anyone?  More info, Loren?

Too late, both of them have been cc\'ing me their discussion :-).  

I think the bottom line of this discussion, is that it\'s Mike\'s world 
and he is going to do what he damn well pleases. 

That said, I agree with Michael based on sociological/gaming reasons.  
There would be nothing more terrifying than to know you could end up as 
pieces-parts if you screw up.  So, it could be an interesting place 
to _roleplay_.  I was always enamored of Niven, anyway.

However, medically and economically, I would choose to disagree with you both.
So there, HAH :-)!  Last time you use "appeal to authority" as an argument.

By TL 14 you\'ll be growing your own replacements.  And prevention is always the 
cheapest option.

Mike argues that by the time the situation in Pallique exists that a drug 
will exist that will "laugh at tissue rejection".  Probably, but it would 
have to be able to do so on a selective basis.  Tissue rejection works 
because of antigen-antibody reactions, the same reactions that protect 
your body from disease.  Current drugs work by suppressing this interaction.  
By laughing at tissue rejection, you could be dying with the common cold.  

Scott says let\'s grow tissue in vats.  The question arises, how do you 
customize the organ to the body in question?  Presumably, the vat/tissue 
culture knows how to control the growth when given direction.  Again 
possible, and probably more likely than an immunosuppressive drug with 
a high specificity.  

My proposal would be contolled growth of normal tissue by the person 
requiring the organ/appendage.  It requires knowing how cells reproduce 
and differentiate, and controlling this.  However, with our current
understanding of tumor cells, this should be within the next 50 years.
Give the patient a shot, he grows an arm, no chance of rejection, and 
it\'s his,  same architecture as the original.  Ditto for internal organs.

However, talk of organ replacement is kind of silly for problems like 
hepatitis or cancer.  Medicine at TL14 is working at the cellular level to 
repair problems before they happen.  You would go in for a yearly tune-up
as well as your check up.  For trauma, well, take your pick of homegrown,
vat grown, amputated or prothestic.  It\'s your game :-).

eric

That\'s true.  And would work for non vital organs.  But remember, we\'re
talking about how to do it as cheaply as possible.  Now, if I read Mike\'s
planet correctly, replacing NON-vital organs would be quite a luxury.
You don\'t NEED a leg to survive.  You don\'t need BOTH kidneys to survive.
If you can do without said organ, you\'re just gonna lose it on Pallique
and hobble through life known from now on as "Peg".
(Margret is probably a common name there...  :-)

Well, the only time they ARE gonna give you that surgery would then be
when it IS that single vital organ that\'s got the cancer.  Correct?  But
you don\'t run around for long with no liver even if one *IS* starting to
grow.  In such cases you are gonna either need to pull an organ out
of someone, or pull it out of a vat, or go on (expensive) life support
equipment until such time as your own liver can handle it\'s appointed
task.

Thus, I think your solution is not the cheapest given the circumstances
given in Metlay\'s ground rules for the world.  Homegrown stuff is just
not gonna be an option.  If you need it, you\'ll need it faster than
you can grow it  And if you don\'t need it....  As John Lennon said in

As Mike said early on, Pallique\'s TL is not 14 in regard to medicine.
That\'s one of the things you have to swallow to get this world to work.

friend that I had known since walking into a Gamekeeper twelve years ago and
picking up a little black box with red lettering on it.

Now, I had been willing to cut GDW some slack on this virus thing, after all
what is the universe but a little bad science fiction gone factual, but a
major essence of why I bought Traveller products all these years went a
wimpering poof when I bought Survival Margin today. Traveller, meant more
than a new set of rules to build starships and create funny codes to build
worlds and npc\'s. It meant more than rules for personal combat from banging
the foul bastard on the head with the club to vaporizing the little snitch
with an FGMP-13. The Traveller Universe was a socio-political/ technical
vision of a complex society in an Intersteller era. There was ability to
imagine oneself as the crafty free trader sneaking off with the lucrutive
gems that you bartered off that barbarian leader, before the Tukera Lines
exploration division captain even noticed this new world.  It was the
Passenger liner steward thwarting the hijacking of the Empress Arbatella on
the Vland to Capital run. It was the being the fanatical SOLSEC agent,
evading Imperial Intelligence on Terra, carrying the explosives and cash for
the resistance\'s next terrorist strike. It was the Aslan of honor, travelling
through the slime of Startown, to fullfill the Clan leaders plans. It was
being the Commander of a Strike Cruiser on a deep raid into Zhodani Space.
Traveller, was the struggle of extraordinary characters trying to survive and
prosper, while competing  steller empires of different species, cultures and
political idealogies vyed for supremecy in the game of princes. Traveller was
the "Sun never sets on the Third Imperium" or "the Solomani Manifest Destiny
is inevitable", it was the Freighter Captain who undocked  his subsidized
merchant secure in the knowledge that the Navy was on patrol and therefore
trade was safe and could be profitable.

Then came MegaTraveller with the Final War, life wasn\'t so safe in some
areas, but there was High Drama. You had the clash of new and old empires,
there were still safe area\'s where the old crafty merchant could still
maneuver his Type A free trader to profit and glory.

Now comes this bloody virus and Survival Margin. Gone is the complex
socio-political/technical environment. Gone are the mighty stellar empires,
Gone is the Merchant Captain of a free trader who crossed the breath of the
Third Imperium for the almighty Imperial Credit. Friends, we have gone from
the struggle of Rome and Carthage straight into the Dark Ages where Hanfred
the Drunk hacks off a peasants head to steal 4 cows.  From having an NPC who
broke into the Imperial Research Center to steal a warbot prototype, we now
will have a cold yokel backwater peasant whose big worry is who is molesting
his wildesheep.

We have a choice of being a fraidy-cat Zhodani dominated inhabitant of the
Regency, a merciless snatcher of chickens from this Star Viking Reformation
whatever it is,  an uneducated barbaric feudal lord or his wretched peasant
from  your choice of the former ...Imperium, Aslan Hierate or Solmani
Confederation.

Gone is the reason to run to the Game Store and get the latest copy of
Challenge or TAS to read the latest from Traveller News Service. Who cares
about whether some poor tech level 4 farmer on Dlan is blown away by a space
viking looking for a replacement Pfaucet for his wife\'s budoir back home. The
drama is gone. This plot made for a darn good H. Beam Piper novel, but it is
not the gist of a long campaign, it is not a reason to read the TNS(or
whatever it becomes).

Just how many campaigns can you run with the Space viking sacking the tech 4
underpopulated world. (OH this is Tuesday, lets go get that bidet on Sirius
4). Just how exciting is it going to be, to play the Brave Denebian Regency
naval Captain blowing away some bandaged 100 year old space hulk carrying
some wretched better life seeking denizens of the "wilds" who just might have
the a copy of "The Virus" onboard. Pfffooof!!!! This is a universe for a
couple of 14 year kids to play a couple of of rounds with, as a break from
AD&D. With all this low tech bang the guy on the head with a claymore sword,
going on maybe we can merge the systems). Yeah, thats the ticket.. the low
tech peaseants on Home mutated in 75 years and became ORC\'s, the ones on
Gushmege KOBOLDS.. Yeah thats the ticket, who needs Spelljammer, we got
TRAVELLER the New Era.

I recommend that if you have views like me, you\'ll make a new universe to
play and dream in.

Maybe, just maybe, I\'ll have Grandfather take a good hard look at the
universe, go grab a spare empty 20000 or so worlds from an unused galaxy,
enclose them in a pocket universe, and clone everybody in the GDW universe.
Then he is going to invite Strephon to a bar on Gushmege. He is going to pour
him a drink of "Old Grandad", tell him to get a grip on himself, become a
true emperor, and go out and save the empire, civilization and a damn good
campaign universe. That merchant captain out of Vland is counting on him.
Maybe, one last Black strike on a small area of Illinois, North America,
Solomani liberated Terra might still hold back the destruction.

As it stands now, the Zhodani won as the last LARGE Human Civilization.

To the late Major Virgisskiai
   3rd Brigade of the 13425 Jump Infantry Division, Imperial Army

   The sacrifice of you and your men who made up the forlorn hope raiding
party that hit that Zhondani Supply grav tank supply depot at Chronor was in
vain. The cause you died for, the way of life, your childrens future, was
sacrificed so that some 14 year old kid can buy a couple of modules of a low
tech AD&D space substitute. Your orphaned children will become peasants. The
Zhodani will dominate human civilization, the non-psionic will be slaves to
the psionic.  You wasted your life, instead of fighting and dying in the 5th
Frontier war, you should have stayed home on Vland and enjoyed the last good
years with the wife and kids.  All of us, mature traveller fans of more than
a decade, raise a glass of thanks to you and your kind..You were
extraordinary....

PLUS, with GDW\'s \'house rules\' combat system, you get to hack to your 
heart\'s content!  Hey, this is great!  Combat is great!  Let\'s fight!
Nah! You can\'t get hurt!  That guy\'s gonna have tuh shoot ya AT LEAST
4 times _just_ to knock your guy down!  So who cares about negotiating or
leaving fighting as the last resort!  HACKFEST! shoot, hack to your
heart\'s content.  ;-)

Well, I suppose GDW could fix those assinine T:2K combat house rules...
Oh! Sorry, just dreaming... ;-)

There\'s just been a system change.

You still have all of that old pre-rebellion and rebellion stuff.
Noone says you have to move on to new times and new faces. With the

or stargates instead of jump drives..you can play on in the

Keep repeating after me, "Strephon is still the Emperor.  The Imperium
never fell.  The virus never was released.  GDW needs to spend some
time in a sanitarium."

I\'ve been busily buying up every bit of real Traveller.  There is a
lot of neat stuff that was published.  I also have lots and lots of
stuff that I wrote up on my own.  Just because GDW doesn\'t support
Real Traveller doesn\'t mean that we can\'t.

	Well, I just got ahold of Survival Margin.  Fascinating.  Really. 
Also the first piece GDW has done in a long time that I can unreservedly
give a "Two thumbs up" to.  If for no other reason than Strephon\'s
private journal entries, both before and after the beginning of the
Rebellion.  The questions it raises are intriguing, to say the least.
	Plus, of course, the revalations about Norris\'s Seneschal...Could he
have been running things all these years?  Or is the Conventional Wisdom
of 1201 correct?  Noone will ever know, I suppose, unless someone does a
"The Empire Never Fell" Sourcebook, and explores the question...

plugs a few of them by implication....

[A lot of good arguments about how the Regency and the Zhodani and

I agree completely. But that\'s not a permissible answer. The problem
becomes to explain how the spinward nations avoided getting infected.
I combine that with the fact that they haven\'t repopulated the 
rest of Charted Space in the 70 years since the Crash and conclude
that they _didn\'t_ avoid getting infected. But they avoided getting
destroyed by it. They managed to contain the infections and minimize
the effects. And when I say minimize that means that they have been
running a Red Queen\'s Race for the last 70 years and _still_ haven\'t
defeated the virus. Only contained it.

Hans asked how it is we can consider the Domain & the Consulate
from the Virus.   Well, the answer seems quite clear to me.  What is
it that exists almost completely in and around the Spinward Marches?

Well, for one thing, the Consulate contains 99.9% of all the psi
institutes in the entire Traveller Universe.  Remember, they got
psi institutes on EVERY planet.  Not just on die rolls of >11.

What about in the core?  Any psi\'s there?  No... Not many...
Obviously, Lucan\'s scientists never really put any psionic
countermeasures into the Virus.

The Zho\'s discovered how to deal with it and didn\'t want any virus
ravaged states right on their borders, so they helped out the Domain,
and the surrounding Vargr states.  My guess would be that the Consulate
would rather see the Darrains fold up shop, but that the Domain gave the
Darrians the assistance they needed.

Seems sensible to me, given the outcome that we want:  The Spinward
Marches Gvurrdon, and the Consulate all intact.

Any bets on how it will really work out?

  Regency-Vargr border must be protected.  Even if some or most of 
  the Vargr states in the area adjacent to the Regency act in 
  concert with the Regency, this actually increases the number of 
  systems that must be blockaded.  And such cooperation can not be 
  counted on, due to the fractious nature of Vargr society.  This 
  means that the Zhodani Consulate must also blockade _its_ borders 
  with the Vargr Extents.  That alone will be a major undertaking, 
  and it is unlikely that the Zhodani (or any interstellar state) 
  would have the manpower and ship power to create a blockade on 
  this great a scale.  The matter is further complicated by the 
  fact that we cannot logically assume that population and travel 
  stop at the coreward extremes of either the Vargr Extents or the 
  Zhodani Consulate.  This means that there is a high likelihood of 
  the Virus being able to make an "end run" around the Zhodani 
  Blockade.  Which means that the Zhodani must blockade their 
  _entire_ border, all the way around, to prevent the Virus from 
  entering from Coreward, then Spinward, then Rimward (the Vargr 
  blockade was already discussed; that is the prevention from 
  Trailing).  It also means that the Regency and the small states 
  in the area must also be prepared to blockade the spinward area, 
  as well.  The area from the spinwardmost point of the Zhodani 
  Consulate all the way down to the Great Rift shows various human 
  and Aslan states, and possibly some alien states as well.  This 
  covers an area that appears to be _at_least_ as large as the 
  Third Imperium at its greatest extent.  Could even the Third 
  Imperium have blockaded its own borders in their entirety?

  I would like to see an alternative history which did not involve 
  the Virus; I feel that the Virus did _too_ much damage to the 
  former Imperial area.  I very much like the idea of the 
  shattering of the Imperium; it allows for much more variety in  
  play.  The idea of allowing a retrogression is also appealing; it  
  gives a frontier feeling to the environment, and the creation of 
  the smaller polities (and to a lesser degree the faction "safes") 
  gives a feeling, even in the "core" worlds, that the frontier 
  isn\'t all that far away, and that a certain kind of toughness is 
  needed - an attitude which will "infect" almost everyone.  Trade 
  is reduced, but still present, and with _more_ opportunity for 
  the independent entrepreneur (and more risk to go with it, but... 
  that\'s why the major companies pulled back, remember?), for both 
  goods (obtained either legally or illegally) and services (to 
  protect ships and systems from the latter).  Certainly, some 
  "Wilds" can be accommodated, for the GM who likes the bootstrap 
  campaign, as well.

  With such an alternate history in mind, I would be willing to 
  work with others on this, either here or on another list (with 
  summaries posted here).  If we elect to go to another list, I 
  cannot manage it; I am on a DOS-based BBS with none of the fancy 
  stuff for news handling that most other Internet sites have.

  If there isn\'t interest in such a project, I\'ll try to work out 
  one on my own, and post the pertinent information in the form of 
  "TNS news stories", "magazine articles", "personal diary 
  entries", and straight out "referee\'s information".

    'from' => 'Jeff Zeitlin',
    'body' => '  The information in this post may be considered spoiler information
  for Survival Margin, and therefore for the Traveller: The New Era 
  background.  However, I feel that the virus story as given in 
  Survival Margin has some deficiencies, and I would like to point 
  them out.

  First, there is the problem of the spread of the Virus.  As 
  written, the Virus is capable of infecting any computer, without 
  exception; some computers will take longer than others, due to 
  the Virus being unfamiliar with the operating system of the 
  target.  There is a fundamental problem with this scenario:  The 
  design of any computer program implies some distinction between 
  program code and data.  Even current object-oriented theory still 
  has this distinction - the concept of the "method" is simply the 
  "code" portion associated with the data in a special way.  But 
  for efficiency reasons, even in an object-oriented paradigm, 
  implementations only keep one copy of the code associated with 
  all instances of a given object type.  This implementation 
  decision will logically extend to the exchange of information 
  between computers - if the target computer knows about a specific 
  kind of object, there will be no need to transmit the code, only 
  the data.  Properly designed programs (and bear in mind, the 
  Third Imperium has 2500 more years of experience than we do to 
  draw on, even if the only experience drawn on is the Solomani 
  experience) will still have a definite separation between code 
  and data; thus, while the viral code could be transmitted (or  
  downloaded, as the Coronation Fleet did at Omicron) from one  
  system to another, it would be unlikely that the code would be 
  executed without question on the target system.  Further, common 
  sense says that unknown code, if it is executed at all, should be  
  executed on a "sterile" and "silent" system - by which I mean  
  that the system should (a) be known to be clean, with a fixed  
  environment of exactly known characteristics (meaning not  
  containing an independently intelligent chip), and (b) not be in  
  communication or sharing resources with any system that, if shut 
  down or damaged, would be a major problem due to external effects  
  (starship control computers do not qualify as "silent" under this 
  definition).

  Second, there is the method of self-preservation in an infected 
  system.  The Survival Margin data indicates that the virus 
  modifies the target system hardware to "hard wire" itself into 
  the system, and avoid destruction if the host is powered down.  
  This requires that every computer be in essence a PROM burner, 
  and that every microcircuit and/or chip be in essence a PROM.  I 
  consider this highly unlikely, as most computers, once designed 
  for a purpose, are not likely to be modified at the hardware 
  level.  In most cases, it will be possible to implement changes 
  as software changes, especially in multifunction computers.  Even 
  given that the Cymbeline chips can themselves function as PROM 
  burners, this is still going to be a hardware-based function, 
  rather than purely software.  Hence, logically, no computer can 
  be infected permanently - especially if "system floppies" or the 
  equivalent are available.  Which they should be, at all times, in 
  case of need.  Not to mention the prudent practice of regular 
  backups...

  Third, there is the matter of the Regency and Spinward States 
  protecting themselves.  Given the limits to the speed of travel, 
  there is no reasonable way that the Regency could have avoided 
  infection, even if we assume that the virus story told by 
  "refugees" was assumed to be true in every particular, and that 
  everyone in the Regency immediately and unquestioningly obeyed 
  the orders concerning the changes in communications equipment and 
  procedures.  There is also the further assumption that Spinward 
  States that were in suspicious or hostile relationships with the 
  Regency (Zhodani, Sword Worlds, ihatei fleets) nevertheless 
  immediately accepted at face value the statements made to them 
  concerning the Virus and the actions to take.  Since the Virus 
  spread at the maximum speed possible (geometric curve of number 
  of ships infected, plus speed of travel and communication 
  limited), it is almost inevitable that the Virus would arrive 
  either with the refugees reporting it, or so soon thereafter that 
  the Regency and the Spinward States would not have had time to 
  take action.  This last problem can be bypassed if we assume that 
  either the conspirator who was assigned to relay the information 
  to the Regency was not killed (though he was thought to be) and 
  hence made it through and delivered his message, or that he had a 
  reliable and credible assistant, who delivered the message in his 
  stead, without being noticed by Lucan\'s secret police.  In either 
  case, the warning would reach the Regency at just about the time 
  that the Virus was first released by Dulinor\'s raid.

  Fourth, there is the impossibility of blockading the Regency and 
  the Spinward States.  Grant, for the purposes of discussion, that 
  the infection of "foreign" systems will be slower than the 
  infection of known systems.  Grant further that the Regency and 
  the Spinward States act in concert to block travel across the 
  limited routes across the Great Rift.  The problem now becomes 
  preventing the spread of the Virus into the Regency and Spinward 
  States by going around the Rift, through Vland and Corridor 
  sectors, _and_the_sectors_to_coreward_.  Certainly, it would take 
  a sizeable fleet to blockade the Regency in the Corridor 
  approaches.  But that ignores the fact that the Virus is also 
  spreading through the Vargr Extents.  This means that the entire

MTJ#4 is a DGP publication.  According to the editoral (by Joe Fugate)
it is the last Traveller publication that DGP will produce.  I got the
impression that they (DGP) didn\'t like the New Era, and intended to
concentrate on AI (which is in the playtest stage).

Joe specifically mentioned the MegaTraveller Alien series, and said that
the remaining volumes will NOT be produced.

DGP will be spending it\'s full time and money on AI; there is a three
page article on AI in MTJ#4, as well as a special offer for Traveller
players to purchase it at a very good price.  Joe also mentioned that AI
is in the playtest stage, and that DGP will be devoting their full time
and energy to getting that game ready for publication.

There are a number of other articles of interest ... a very long
Traveller Q&A (which includes an explanation of the Primordials), and a
bunch of internal letters and memos from DGP archives.

And yes, it\'s still $12.95.

All in all, if you have to make a choice between MTJ#4 and Survival
Margin, I\'d pick MTJ#4.  Your best bet is to get both, however.

    'body' => 'Hello all!  I decided to put my $0.02 into this discussion.

I purchased _Survival_Margin_ a couplea weeks ago and LOVED it, and I
have a few comments and questions to add to the group.

First, I feel the spread of the virus was not stopped dead in its
tracks:  Norris and the Deneb domain contacted its neighbors in a
state of panic.  The Zhos no doubt would scan the messangers and maybe
even Norris and verify that he was not lying.  The Aslans, despite
appearances, were only recent additions to the area and were in the
process of absorbing their \'new\' conquests.  The Vargr were probably beyon
d hope.  But like Greece in the ancient times you could get a few allies
and use intimidation and threats of a combined Zho-Deneb attack to get
at least cooperation.

Sealing borders is a formidable task for the governments, but when the
first virus ships arrived and a few infections took place (and the
advance warning the Domain got) the whole Regency would understand the need,
and the political will would then exist.  The economy for the next few
years would be totally geared to stopping the virus and setting up a
"sealed border."  Downgrading starports to E in certain low population
frontiers, occupying certain systems, guarding gas giants in frontier systems,
and putting huge defense boat contingents in strategic trading center.
Also a joint RDF-type force would be placed in certain systems to respond
to threats.  The diversion of resources would stunt technological progress
for awhile as nearly every credit surplus would be used to combat the
virus threat.  The years from 1131 to about 1155 would be the worst of it,
beyond that, most of the bigger ships would break down for lack of repair.

I also formulated that perhaps the virus would be attacking computers
from TL10 or more, as the computer coordination of ships would be 
absolutely neccesary to perform more than J-1.  The use of Synaptics,
or self-reprogramming computers would allow the virus to spread, first
making the computer schitzophrenic, then taking over as the dominant
personality.  As I understand it, synaptics mimic neurons, which do
not distinguish between DATA and PROGRAMS as clearly as our clunky
TL8 machines do... :)  I would think that the most the virus could do
would be to lay and egg into the non-self programming computers.

As far as hardwiring - I think GDW is a bit silly.  Maybe with 
synaptics, and EEproms, but most TL9- machines would not be
vulnerable.

I would think that in the Regency, ship design would change, having
independant computers for every system (since I would think that
the Domain was not always as virus free as it is now -- it was just able
to stamp it out and not lose its technology in the process) with
data-links between non-synaptic systems (They would have gone back to
TL10 and re-developed to about TL15 along non-synaptic technologies)
allowing more than wimpy J-1.

Outside the Regency, I would think that only now would Jump technology
be coming back (thanks to some Hivers and a few planets that were less
than TL9 before the Virus -- they wouldn\'t have the Frankenstein syndrome
as bad as theformer high-tech worlds), and only Jump-1 at that.  The
computers required to do more than that would require development of
parallel, but different technologies that were virus-resistant.

I feel that the reason the Imperium fell so badly is the confusion of
the war and the destruction of communication links did not allow the
virus (which is not a virulent as GDW wants to make it -- just would
infect computers and such above TL9-10 that used synaptics) to be
stamped out the way it was in the Regency.  

[Also GDW wanted a \'preserve\' for hard-core Classic Traveller Fans! :)]

Now for a few questions:

What the heck do you all think the "Black Curtain" was?  A special mutant
virus that thought it was Lucan infected everything and enslaved the core
area, working them to death, making things a living Hell for them?  Or did
Lucan somehow control Viral forces who had a love/hate/awe for their
\'creator?\'  What do you all think?

Would Terra be thrown back to TL5-7?

Have Fun!

The life form the virus was derived from was semiconductor based, I 
think carbon is just a conductor (though a poor one).

Yikes!  Think about the ramifications!  Whole societies becoming in
a group mind bent on the destruction of everything. Shiver.

Maybe that is how to counter the unusability of computers in the TNE
universe due to the virus (in my eyes, any computer with synaptics -
and synaptic types would be required for anything more than J1)!

Find a bunch of borderline PSIs, and train them to be mentat types
to allow higher jump levels and other important operations!

Kind of a cool thought...

about six tasks.  These didn\'t include things like meson attacks, as this
really does not apply to the small scale combat I usually engage in.  The
damage results are a mess; for small vessels, the high number of critical
hits makes \'running repairs\' a joke, while some of the rulings on the
damage tables make no sense; for example powerplant -1 reduces the
powerplant hit points by 10%, ie if you have 40 hitpoints, damage reduces
them in 4 point steps, but if you have 80, they are reduced in 8 point
steps.  Thus, different sized powerplants are destroyed at the same rate
by a given hit!  Also, the starship weapon stats given in the Players\'

while inflicting tremendous damage if they do penetrate amour.

to my favourite soapbox... :-)

>[...] You wasted your life, instead of fighting and dying in the 5th

Um.  5th Frontier war?  What\'s that, pray tell, science fiction?
There has been no Fifth Frontier War, there has been no Rebellion --
we have always been as we are.

I think a lot of people are confusing a rules system with a campaign.
I have never used the Rebellion background, but almost everything I
have spent on MT material has paid off (or will pay off) in my
campaign, set as it is on the borders of a strong and thriving
Imperium exploring a new era of peace with the Zhodani.  I\'ve even
used 2300AD material in the game.
    What makes a campaign successful is not the rules system, although
the rules must not be allowed to intrude, but the *feel*.  With a
consistent well thought out background, a good group of players, and
enough flexibility to take the universe where it wants to go, it
doesn\'t really matter what rules system is being used.  GDW\'s decision
to bring out a new rules system should not affect existing campaigns
- -- you can use the old rules, the new rules, and any mixture of
background you choose that blends into *your* game.  We freed
ourselves from strict adherence to the Party Line when we learnt to
say "Gygax is an insufferable moron" and reject the "If you don\'t use
these exact rules, I won\'t let you play" attitude (in the days when it
was IMHO true, not sure how Mr. Gygax\'s work is doing these days).
That was when, 10, 15 years ago?  I remember it well.
    I have not consciously decided whether to buy TNE.  I probably
will, and if a non-Rebellion sourcebook is added I certainly will.
GDW has usually produced stuff I find useful, and I don\'t expect them
to go downhill now.  How much of it I actually use verbatim depends on
how much fits in with my game.
    Whatever, GDW is *not* screwing our current campaigns.  There is
absolutely no reason why they cannot continue as they are now.  Any
campaign sufficiently well established that the GM feels irritated by
the new rules and/or background should be able to carry on by its own
momentum and the creative forces it generates within itself.
    What GDW is doing is what TSR did with AD&D -- attempting to make
a new "done right" rules set which still retains the character of the
original game.  To carry the analogy further: last time I ran a D&D
variant, I used some AD&D rules with a heavily modified magic system,
but still referred frequently to _Greyhawk_, _Blackmoor_, and
_Eldritch Wizardry_ (anyone remember those?).  When _Unearthed Arcana_
came out, and 2ed to follow that, I adapted the parts that fit and
ignored the rest.  I currently run a fairly straight MT campaign, with
increasingly modified space combat rules (personal combat I run mostly
by feel, on the rare occasions it\'s necessary(**)), and I expect to
take the best parts of TNE and bring them in.  If the _We Have Always
Been As We Are_ sourcebook is good enough, I may even retcon my
universe to match it more closely.  Whatever, the mere fact that GDW
is publishing new rules does *not* threaten my game, and I refuse to
get upset about it.
    Not singling anyone out, but I think several people are taking
this too personally.  Nothing wrong with criticism, of course, but I
detect a sense that some people feel screwed by TNE, and I think
they\'re over-reacting.  Methinks the lady doth protest too much, as it
were.


(*) somewhat unexpected.  The annual maintenance on the TL17 jump
drive was due almost a year ago, and they\'re having trouble finding
suitable shipyard facilities. :-)

(**) the last thing shot was the communicator in Sick Bay (the
equipment, not a person).  I didn\'t feel the need to refer to the
rules for that. :-)

	As I have never been able to piece together the starship combat section
	of my rather error-filled MegaTrav Referee\'s Guide, I have decided to
	adopt my own way of applying damage, based on some of the commentaries in
	past volumes of the TML. Most of these medium-rare rules are based on the
	"damage based on Mw values" of weapons. Minor modifications and multipliers
	are used in certain areas relating to the UCP values, etc... Whatever.

	But then we enter the void of Missiles. Now, How the He** do we figure
	out the damage points value of missiles. No mention in any rule books.
	I referred to COACC for inspiration, came to a half baked 60 damage points
	per missile based on some stats there, but then the TL of the missile 
	comes into account. Oh oh. And what about Nuclear and Antimatter...

	Does anyone out there have a system for such things? If so, a fairly

    'body' => 'Hi,

This is my first posting to the list but I\'ve been following the
discussions for some time now.

The discussion about the fuel usage of nuclear power plants has been
here on the list several times now, but I was missing a revised table 
of the power plants.

I\'m not an engineer or physicst (only a CS student) so my calculations
may be wrong. Please correct me when you discover errors or miscalculations.

Basic Assumptions:
The fuel tanks of traveller spacecraft carry liquid hydrogen (for fusion power
plants) and its ordinary hydrogen.
I\'ve covered deuterium using plants as a new type of fuision power plant.

FISSION: I use the figures from Rob Dean\'s article from Dec 1990 
         (article number 1914) 
         Fissionanbles are enriched to 5%, burn down to 1% and fission
	 power plants have a 30% efficiency.
	 Figure: 1.3 l per year per MW of power plant output.

FUSION:  Oridinary hydrogen reaction for "standard" fusion power plants is:

	   1                4
         4  H + 2 e    ---->  He + 27.05 MeV
	   1                2

         Deuterium reaction:


                     3     1
		 /->  He +  n  + 3.72 MeV
           2    /    2     0
         2  H  /  
           1   \\	    (or with about even probabilty)
		\\    3     1
		 \\->  H  +  H  + 4.03 MeV
                     1     1

	 Average of 3.875 MeV

         1 Kg of hydrogen has (1 * 6.022 * 10^26)/1 atoms
	 1 l of hydrogen weighs 0.07 Kg, so it has 0.07 * 6.022 * 10^26
	 = 4.22 * 10^25 atoms. Fusing yields (4.22 * 10^25) / 4 * 27.05
	 = 2.85 * 10^26 MeV = 4.56 * 10^13 Ws = 12700 MWh

	 1 Kg of deuterium has (1 * 6.022 * 10^26)/2 atoms   
	 1 l of deuterium weighs 0.14 Kg, so it has 0.14 * 6.022 * 10^26 / 2
	 = 4.22 * 10^25 atoms. Fusing yields (4.22 * 10^25) / 2 * 3.875
	 = 8.17 * 10^25 MeV = 1.31 * 10^13 Ws = 3630 MWh

	 (6.022 * 10^26 : Avogadro\'s number
	  1 MeV = 1.6 * 10^-13 watt seconds
	  MeV : Mega Electron Volt
          Ws  : Watt Seconds
	  MWh : MegaWatt Hours)

          Depending on what system we use (High Guard, MegaTraveller or 
	  Striker) we arrive at different efficencies.
          With the ordinary hydrogen reaction, HG plants have a 0.1% eff.,
          MTrav plants a 0.016% eff. and Striker plants an efficiency of
          0.032%.
          With the deuterium reaction, the efficiencies are 0.3%, 0.05% and
          0.1% respectively.

	  I\'ve made fusion power plants that are between 3% and 36%
          effcient. That should satisfy engineers and be still 
          competitable with fission power.

ANTIMATTER: Antimatter reaction is just total conversion of matter to
            energy, so we can use the E = m * c^2 formula here.
	    1 Kg of matter yields 1 * c^2 = 25,000,000 MWh if totally
            converted to energy.
	    The efficiency for all antimatter plants is the same for
            all TLs. The Tl 17 plant yields 4,320,000 MWh per year and
            uses 250 TONS of matter for this. And this time the rest
            cannot simply be vented outside (THAT would leave a trail in
            an atmosphere). The antimatter plants thus have all an 
            efficiency of 0.00007%. 
	    I assume that the antimatter <-> matter reaction is
            100 % efficient and the conversion to electrical energy is about
            30 % efficient.

Wt is in tons per Kl of plant. Price is in MCr per Kl of plant.
Minimum Volume is in Kl. Pow is power output per Kl of plant.
Fuel is fuel usage in liter per year per Kl of plant.
Efficiency is the efficiency of the plants of the given level. The right
number is the efficiency for the largest plant (14+ Kl) and the left
number is the efficiency for the smallest possible plant for the given TL.

The only problem I\'ve now is that the endurance of almost anything
nuclear powered is way too large and the jump drive fusion plants become
even more inefficient. A 250 MW laser could be powered for a whole year
with 0.56 Kl at TL 15.
Perhaps I should make the plants an order of magnitude less efficient
for the sake of game balance. Decrease efficiency by a factor of 40 ?
(The laser above would than need 1.85 Kl per month)

First, 5% enrichment is good for commercial electric generating stations
and the efficiency of 36% is good.

However, for any sort of space reactor propulsion, enrichment better go
up to near 60% or even higher depending on the fuel.  For the most part
the extra U-238 is just wasted weight (ok, maybe a little conversion to
plutonium but not much (relatively speaking.))

Also, efficiency for the space reactors is a lot higher than 36%
if you figure just for propulsion.  If you want to make some sort of
black box energy conversion for electrical energy production, I can
see something anywhere from 45 to 60 percent efficient within the next
few hundred years.  We\'re already looking at 40 percent and
up in some high tech applications today.

Also, this black box conversion from thermal energy to electrical energy
would be the same regardless of the power source, fission or fusion or
antimatter (for a given tech level.)

The "efficiency" better be defined before putting it in table form.  I think
most people are used to efficiency meaning "energy out/energy available"
(to be simplistic.)

The table is a good start (heck, all _I\'ve_ done is criticize...Klaus did the
work!) but there are spots for improvement.

Hello All,
   Through the kindness of a friend, I have been listening to the
TML since my membership died three years ago (due to a dying address).
I have, once or twice, posted via Rob or Carl (since they also have
GEnie accounts).  Now I have a real net address again, so here I am...
   Several weeks ago the question of blasters and plasma pistols
came up (again).  The last time this topic came up, I composed some
thoughts on the matter, but never got around to imposing on my
connections to get them posted...


Blasters and Plasma Pistols
   Weaponry from SF that is "obviously" beyond Traveller\'s TL15 has
always been fascinating.
 
The Plasma Pistol:
   For a good Traveller-style plasma pistol, check out the "Captain\'s
Sidearm" from Brian Daley\'s "Requiem for a Ruler of Worlds" (and its two
sequels).  While some implied features indicate that it is a second or
third generation design, in practice it makes a good "prototype" Plasma
Pistol (lots of flash and noise, a miniature \'gunshield\' around the
grips, general disintegration of the target area).
   Another notable appearance of the Plasma Pistol is L. Neil Smith\'s
Confederacy series, specifically "Brightsuit MacBear".  This model
uses an (apparently) lower energy plasma than the Captain\'s Sidearm,
but gives the plasma a bigger push and better packet coherency.  Fired
into dense vegetation, the \'round\' keeps going in a straight line for
quite a distance, eating a long, straight tunnel throught the leaves.
Firing at a human target, however, produces the same effect as the
(much louder) Captain\'s Sidearm:  boom, flash, dead.
 
 
Blasters:
   The Blaster (pistol and carbine) from Star Wars is an unusual weapon.
Gamers have been trying to adapt it to Traveller since the beginning.
 
   From White Dwarf #11 (Feb/March 1979), in an article called
"Fire-Arms: 3000 A.D." by Brian Asbury, comes this approach:
      "The Hand Blaster:  This is a handgun-sized atomic energy weapon,
firing a tiny 3mm x 15mm projectile at 700 to 800 meters per second.  Once
it is set into motion, anything that stops the projectile trips a tiny
atomic trigger which converts a submicroscopic fraction of its mass into
energy.  A magazine carrying six charges is inserted into the gun\'s handle,
one charge being fired for each pull of the trigger.  Reloading takes one
combat round, but two if the firer is treated as evading.
      "Disadvantages of this weapon are its obvious expense, plus the fact
that any target blasted by it becomes radioactive for twenty four hours.
The effective radius of this radiation is only about half a meter, however.
If desired, the blaster can be used to cut through solid steel of up to 15cm
thickness, blasting a circular opening of approximately 1 meter diameter.
      "Weight 1200/200; Rds/Clip 6; Length 200; Price 4000/200;
      "Armor DMs: Nothing(+4), Jack(+4), Mesh(+1), Cloth(-1), Reflec(+4),
Ablat(+1), Battle(-4).
      "Range DMs: Close(-6), Short(0), Medium(+1), Long(-5), VeryLong(no),
Wound Inflicted 5D."
 
   To me, This sounds like a large caliber pistol firing collapsing rounds
(from Striker).  The reason for only 6 rounds would be the necessity of
incorporating a damper box in the magazine.  The article also had a larger
version called a Blast Rifle, which fired 4mm rounds at 1000 meters per
second, and produced a bit more damage (and a slightly larger hole).  No
Tech Levels are given for either weapon (or anything else in the article).
 
   There is also the "Magic-that-looks-like-technology" version in TSRs
Gamma World.  The second edition of this game applied a rather amusing
typo to the blaster, enabling the Mark V and Mark VII Blasters to
atomize anything protected by a Force Field, but be harmless otherwise.
Nothing in the description helps us understand the "how" of this weapon.
 
   Obviously, neither of these is quite right when compared to Han Solo\'s
Trusty Blaster(tm).  One has ammo restrictions, and both are too
destructive.
   A close look at the Star Wars movies will tell you that a conventional
Traveller Plasma Gun, even scaled down, doesn\'t quite fit either.  When a
Stormtrooper falls over after being shot, ALL OF HIM falls over, not just
boots and smoking ashes.  On the other hand, the Star Wars Blaster has
enough punch to shoot out locks and slag control panels.  The Blaster
has no danger space (unlike Traveller Plasma and Fusion weapons), since
we see it used constantly on targets (usually controls or locks) a foot
or two from the barrel, and Darth Vader wouldn\'t have been able to stop
those shots (in "The Empire Strikes Back") without smoking most of the
rest of the room.
   A possible solution comes (again) from the WD #11 article.  This weapon,
instead of being scaled down, could be made more deadly with advancing
TL, eventually becoming a "blaster" which acts like those in Star Wars.
 
      "The L.P.L. Stungun (Full title: Low-Power-Laser-directed-
electrical-shock-Stun Weapon):  A pistol-sized weapon which uses a low
power laser beam to ionize the air in a path along its line, and then
sends a burst of electrical energy along the path.  This has the effect
of stunning any human-sized opponent it hits, without causing any actual
damage.  The saving throw against such a stun is 11+ for a human (DM: +1
for endurance 10+), but becomes proportionately lower for larger species,
e.g. an elephant\'s save would be 3+.  The power pack for this weapon
forms the pistol\'s handle, carries 8 charges and takes 4 hours to
recharge.  Power packs may be changed during combat, taking one round to
do so, in which the firer is treated as evading.  This weapon does not
function in vacuum or trace atmosphere and is subject to a DM of -4 in
high crosswinds.
      "Weight 500/300; Rds/Clip 8; Length 175; Price 1500/200;
      "Armor DMs: Nothing(+2), Jack(+2), Mesh(+1), Cloth(+1), Reflec(-8),
Ablat(-7), Battle(-6).
      "Range DMs: Close(+2), Short(+2), Medium(-1), Long(no), VeryLong(no),
Wound Inflicted (special)."
 
   Note that the "clip" is actually the entire handle, and makes up 60% of
the weapon\'s weight.  As with the Blaster, there was no TL listed for this
weapon, but I had placed it at TL10.  With advancing TL, the laser and/or
the electrical jolt could be strengthened enough so that the combination
will kill.  Given the advances of the normal Laser Pistol, this weapon\'s
laser would be a flashlight by comparison, but the jolt does most of the
damage anyway (at low TL).
   As a side note, electricity was a type of plasma last time I looked,
so this is a \'poor man\'s Plasma Pistol\' as well.
 
   (The article in White Dwarf #11 gives apologies to Harry Harrison for
lifting a few ideas from his books, but I don\'t know it this applies
to either of the weapons quoted here.)

This is my first posting to the list so please be kind.

I have been toying with a varient of dammage in the Traveller games.  Most
of this comes from my experiances with 2300 AD which for all of its faults
had some really novel features.  The key one IMO is the Task System.

These dammage rules rely upon viewing combat as a part of the task system.
 Hitting the target already is covered by the task system and now in my
opitional system taking dammage is a task.  

Old Sequence:
		Player A attackes Target B 
		If Target is hit Player A rolls dice for location, dammage
		blah blah blah blah
		Player B attacks Target A 

This is pretty standard for most RPGs.  The problems arise when one of the
players is a firearms/martial arts guru and points out ad nausium how this
does not reflect \'reality\'  

These people have a point.  If your group likes to fight fight fight they
want the combat rules to be good.  So I ponderd over this for a long time
and finally it occurred to me that the whole hit point/random dammage
concept could be replaced by a NO HIT POINT/constant dammage system.

At this point I made 5 types of wounds: scratches, light wounds,
substantive wounds, greivious wounds and mortal wounds.

Now when a person takes dammage in a fight 2 things happen: 1 the person
ignores the wound and keeps on fighting or the person must respond to the
wound.  This really sound like a task:

TASK: Ignoring a scratch [easy] --modified by determination
TASK: Ignoring a light wound [determination] routine
TASK: Ignoring a substantive wound [Det] difficult
TASK: Ignoring a greivious wound [Det]   formidable
TASK: Ignoring a mortal wound [Det]      impossible

Weapons are rated in terms of the typical type of wound they inflict.  For
example most pistols inflict substantive wounds.  IMO a substantive wound
is one that will cause the individual to drop his weapon, cease attacking
or stop running in 4 or 5 steps.

This is a good first step because now as the referee I have a lot more
control over how a combat turns out and we no longer have people routinely
taking 4 or 5 .45 bullets in the chest before dying.  Now when this
happens it is the exception and not the rule.

This system doesn\'t have hit locations per say.  I dived the Human body
into 3 areas: vital, non-vital, and \'normal\'

A hit in a non-vital area does one level lower wound.  A hit in a vital
area does a one level higher wound.  Thus if I shot a person with a pistol
that did substantive wounds, it would do greivious wounds in vital areas
and light wounds in non-vital areas.

You can aim for 1 of the 3 areas at 1 level of increased difficulty to the
to hit Task.
- ----
Why do this?

1)	I think it is faster than the traditional method.

2)	I think it is more exciting when \'urgh! you take a greivious wound
	roll to ignore\' than \'a body pistol does x dice of dammage, roll
	for location, and dammage\'

3)	It makes combat unpredictable -- risky -- something to avoid
- ----

Anyway, there it is in a nutshell.  This isn\'t for everyone or every game.

Feel Free to rip it apart err comment.

In general, your suggestions seem reasonable; however, I\'d suggest that
one of the physics experts here on TML take a look at your fusion and
antimatter numbers.  I don\'t know enough about the subject to be sure,
but isn\'t a significant fraction of the energy carried away in particles
that aren\'t useful (like neutrinos)?

In regard to the table that went up yesterday for power plants....

First, 5% enrichment is good for commercial electric generating stations
and the efficiency of 36% is good.

However, for any sort of space reactor propulsion, enrichment better go
up to near 60% or even higher depending on the fuel.  For the most part
the extra U-238 is just wasted weight (ok, maybe a little conversion to
plutonium but not much (relatively speaking.))

Also, efficiency for the space reactors is a lot higher than 36%
if you figure just for propulsion.  If you want to make some sort of
black box energy conversion for electrical energy production, I can
see something anywhere from 45 to 60 percent efficient within the next
few hundred years.  We\'re already looking at 40 percent and
up in some high tech applications today.

Also, this black box conversion from thermal energy to electrical energy
would be the same regardless of the power source, fission or fusion or
antimatter (for a given tech level.)

The "efficiency" better be defined before putting it in table form.  I think
most people are used to efficiency meaning "energy out/energy available"
(to be simplistic.)

The table is a good start (heck, all _I\'ve_ done is criticize...Klaus did the
work!) but there are spots for improvement.

In an old campaign of mine, somebody wanted a blaster like Han Solo\'s. 
My solution was to "design" a weapon that was a miniature pulse laser.
It worked off of an "overload" condition in its power pack and hence had 
a very short life span.  It was good for about 24-32 shots and the "lasing" 
element and the had to be replaced after that point.

Also, it was considered a very hazardous weapon to use.  One chance in 50
the power pack (hi-tech battery) could explode due to the combination of 
high heat and the generation of hydrogen gas.  Injuries that resulted usually 
were somewhat minor (2nd degree burns, etc).  

I realize that there are probably gaping holes in the technology here... but 
it was a quick and dirty answer to a player\'s wishes while attempting to 
maintain some semblence (sp?) of game balance...

I always thought the reason for the massive jump in fusion plant
power-to-mass ratio at TL 15 was that superdense matter technology enabled
the plant to capture some of the high-energy neutrinos produced by the
reaction and convert their energy to electrical power....

    Torso: on 1 or 2 the lungs have been punctured and the victim is
    immobile. On 3 or 4 there has been major damage to the abdominal
    organs. Victim can still move but int, dex and initiative are
    reduced to 1 automatically. On 5 or 6 there is major damage
    to the lower abdomen and groin area. The victim cannot move,
    attack, or defend - he\'s too busy writhing on the ground in 
    pain.
    Head: On a 1, skull has been shattered or crushed, suffering 
    1d6/2 points from each of int and dex (brain damage). On a 2 , 
    the victim suffers amnesia and must forever make a Difficult
    task attempt (int) to remember people, places, incidents or
    things from his past. On a 3, the victim is blinded.
    If a critical wound is not tended to within 2 minutes, it worsens
    to a mortal wound.
M = MORTAL WOUND
    Essentially a killing wound. The victim is now dying. he may not
    move, attack or defend. Each turn he must make a Death Save. On
    a roll equal or less than the Death save number, he survives to 
    the next turn. 
D = DEAD
    The victim has instantly expired from the severity of his wounds.
    

DEATH SAVES
The death save number is equal to the Constitution statistic of the
victim. 

CONSCIOUSNESS SAVE
After any wound, it is necessary to make a save to determine does
the victim lose consciousness
This number must be rolled under and is modified by the severity of
wounds.
This modification is equal to the damage point inflicted in the
attack.

CUMULATIVE WOUNDS
                  New Wound Level
Previous Wound 
                   Flesh  Serious  Critical  Mortal

WOUND RECOVERY
 The wound will recover one level if a roll equal to or less than
the victims constitution stat is made. This can be modified at the
Gm\'s discretion to suit Medical care or lack of same or especially
nasty weaponry....such as from plasma weapons or other which I can
think of ie Polsci Stinger from Spacetime, graser cannons etc


The above is from 1st Ed Cyberpunk (slightly changed)and the wound

  I like Steven Gott\'s damage system!  I\'d assume that the damage
table would be a matrix of weapon vs. armor.  Do you have anything
that you could post?

  What happens when you fail a determination roll?  Are you unable
to perform any activity until you pass the det\' roll?   Would first
aid to yourself then count as an activity?

  I see this as a positive improvement for role-playing.  If anyone
else playtests this concept, could you post your opinions?  I think
this is an interesting thread to continue.

"A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping...she is 
weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, for they are no more."

Hi, gang. Let me start off by thanking Loren Wiseman for his prompt note
about the print run of TNE; such news is always appreciated.

I read _Survival Margin_ from cover to cover on Saturday, and spent a 
surprising (to me, anyway) portion of the next two days brooding.
SM (and _Arrival Vengeance_, which I got at the same time) affected
me very deeply, in a way no Traveller book has done since the Rebellion
began. While I applaud Dave Nilsen for at least being able to do THAT,
I am saddened by the fact that the emotions he evoked were those of
revulsion, disgust, and yes, even hatred.

I hate this game setting. I just hate it.

I want to make very clear what I am saying here, and make even MORE
clear what I am NOT saying here. I am not saying that GDW produced yet
another substandard piece of Traveller material. Far from it; I think
that SM was excellently put together, clearly organized, and
accomplished its task, namely as a bridge from MegaTraveller to TNE,
eloquently and effectively.  Its reprinting of previously published
material meshed very well with the newly written pieces and produced a
coherent and useful whole that was a very worthwhile read. The
behind-the-scenes journals and extra data filled in a lot of holes
that I had wondered about, and finally removed IRIS as a de jure (if
not de facto) force in the Imperium, a move which alone is worth the
price of the book. I will ignore for the moment my personal disgust at
the utterly pointless annihilation of the Antares Regency (my own
favorite spot in the MegaTraveller milieu), and simply say that if
future releases hold to this level of quality, I will gladly give GDW
my business and encourage others to do so as well. I am also not
saying, although some mean-spirited part of me would LIKE to, that
this is the final nail in Traveller\'s coffin as a rules system. I
think that in the light of the current market trends in RPGs, GDW is
making a very wise move here in updating Traveller from its admittedly
long-in-the-tooth beginnings and attempting to compete on a
fundamental level with the heavy hitters like GURPS and Shadowrun. If
the prior problems of poor proofreading and unprofessional artwork are
licked, and it looks as good as SM reads, then I think that GDW will
have a solid competitor on its hands, and I wish them well.

What I AM saying is that I hate the game setting. HATE IT!

On the Pocket Empire mailing list, we have held our breaths for
months, pausing in midstride as we waited for GDW to officialize the
tantalizing hints we received about how things are to work. We do not
agree 100% with the decisions made there, but we are abiding by them,
and the list is now swinging into high gear, awaiting only the rules
themselves to begin applying hard numbers to the ideas and frameworks
we have devised. Why, then, am I suddenly completely uninterested in
doing any more work there? I don\'t want to let these people down; my
contribution is admittedly small but I would like to think that it is
important enough not to simply drop without notice. What has happened?

What has happened is that I have seen the future and it STINKS.

I am not stating facts here. Only my opinions. And I loved the classic
Traveller universe. It was civilized; it was intelligent; it had solid
background and a sense of depth to it that other games lacked. This
was a huge, exciting, beautiful universe, from the Core to the Rim,
from spinward to trailing! There was so much to see and do, so many
different kinds of life to reflect, so many possible campaigns to run.
It was balanced; it gave characters a chance for excitement and fun at
whatever power level they wanted, up to and sometimes even including
the governance of whole worlds. And, pivotal to any long-standing
campaign with realistic characters, it allowed people to rest once in
a while.  There were places one could go to relax and enjoy the beauty
and wonder of this universe, and if adventure sneaked up on you while
you were working on your tan, so much the better.

Now, what do we have? A map of the Imperium smeared with grey paint,
with a big black SPLOTCH in the middle and a little chunk in one
corner or another that the paintbrush didn\'t reach. The grandeur of
Capital, the intrigue and espionage of the Solomani Rim, the exciting
new possibilities of the Hinterworlds and Gateway, the battle and
diplomacy of Reaver\'s Deep, the worldshattering implications of the
Aslan revelations, the horrible reality of the K\'Kree and their plans
for humaniti-- all gone. Nothing left but piles of dead bodies and
rusted metal, scrabbled over by bands of savages and man-eating
computers. Big fat hairy goddamn deal. 

It just makes no sense to me on an artistic level. I know why they did
it. I\'ve read their reports and I\'ve tried, believe me, to support
them as wholeheartedly as I did in 1987 before I read about the
assassination of Strephon and watched the universe to which I\'d
devoted years of my gaming career start to unravel. But it just makes
no sense. If all they wanted was a ruined-empire universe where
everything was forgotten, why not hire some writers and build one from
scratch?  FASA did that with the BattleTech universe, and did very
well for themselves: no one yearned for the Star League when the game
was predicated on its aftermath. Why did they feel the need to hack up
the best gaming campaign setting in the history of roleplaying and
throw the carcass to the vultures? It wasn\'t necessary. It really
accomplished nothing, except to absolve GDW of responsibility for
maintaining consistency in a game universe that had grown too large
for them to control. It substituted grand, far-reaching excitement for
petty, animalistic excitement, thought-provoking political and
economic problems for simple military exercises and head-smashing, a
broad view for a narrow one. And I hate it with a passion. The Imperium
is dead-- long live the Dawn League and the Star Vikings? No thank you.
I quit. I\'m leaving. I can not deal with this now, call me a coward, a
stick-in-the-mud, an elitist, an old fogey, whatever you want. 

That having been said, what am I going to do now?

To be honest, I just don\'t know. I will continue to read the
TNE-Pocket material, and will see if the little spot of color we are
preparing to add to The Big Grey Map inspires me enough to start
working again on my part.  I will remain on the TML, and I will almost
certainly continue to playtest the TNE rules I have until I can obtain
the published versions. When those rules are in hand, I will begin to
type up the text of a sourcebook for TNE on the unbroken Third
Imperium, an idea that may or may not ever see approval by GDW and
which I will not discuss here until its future is known for certain,
one way or the other. I will finish running my MegaTraveller campaign
to its end, and see if the last set of people I care about in the
Traveller Universe, Grant and Company, make it to safety in Deneb
before the end (it\'s ironic that in Hector, the CymBiotic who ran
Grant\'s computer for him, I anticipated the Virus by over three
years). The PBEM I run with Mark Cook will continue-- the characters
have left the known Universe anyway, and we have time to consider what
sort of homecoming they will eventually endure.

And after that, when TNE is finally here? Who knows?

Perhaps I will take refuge in the old Imperium and dust off my ratty
old Classic Traveller books, and try to pretend none of this ever
happened. But I doubt it; that smacks of cowardice. Perhaps I, like
many others of my stripe, will take comfort from the highly unlikely
but metasatisfying pre-rebellion status of the Regency of Deneb, and
actually grow intrigued with the new mix of races and ideas there--
and perhaps I will learn to ignore the iron wall surrounding my new
little universe, beyond which there is nothing but grey paint. Right.

Perhaps my idea for a universe/campaign module allowing the unbroken
Third Imperium to be played using the newer (and hopefully better) TNE
rules set will fly, and I will be able to produce a work that both
serves those saddened by this turn of events AND provides GDW with a
worthwhile product that will generate good revenue. I hope so; in a
Universe once full of my grand designs, I now find that that little
as-yet-nonexistent book is my only real dream.

But one thing is certain: in my current ambivalent state, I am of no
use to anyone here as a resource, and must now officialize what has
been a de facto state of affairs since my mistakes in answering
questions have become more frequent and handled with more consistency
and accuracy by many others, all of whom have my thanks. I am hereby
resigning my post as Historian of the Traveller Mailing List, and am
remanding my duties to those who feel they can continue what I once
took joy in doing. I salute you all, and I\'ll see you, in some state
of mind or another, in the New Era.


Mike Metlay goes off the air immediately. I keep the flame. Good luck.

I haven\'t figured out this figures by myself. (I\'m only a CS student.)
The table gets a lot more complicated when we\'re including enrichment 
rate and burndown rate.
But you\'re right in that radioactives can be enriched to a much higher
degree. But I don\'t know about the risks in enriching radioactives to a
much higher degree. How safe is your reactor then ?
Handling becomes more dangerous with a higher enrichment rate as you
get to the critical mass more quickly. "Burning Through" your reactor
is also easier.
Besides, the power plants should be used for civilian and military
vessels alike. This might not be very realistic.
And then there\'s the question of cost efficiency. How expensive
would be fuel enriched to 10%, 25%, 50%, or even 75% or 90% ?
Lastly, highly enriched radioactives (90% or more enrichment) make bomb
grade material. As Imperial law make clear that nuclear bombs are for
nobody but the imperial military, I don\'t think that imperial authorities
allow highly enriched nuclear material to be carried aroound like
gasoline.

Perhaps I can include a variety of new fuel types. Like 
Radioactives with 5%, 10%, 25%, 50% and 75% enrichment.
Enriching radioactives is a very complicated task I\'ve heard  and gets
more complicated the higher the enrichment, so the
price would increase proportional to the square of the enrichment rate while
efficiency would only increase linearly as less fuel is needed with 
higher enrichment rate.

Well, my first attempt of the table at home had a conversion efficiency
of 60% for fusion plants but assumed a much lower rate of fusing atoms.
The efficiency was around 16% then. (In fact, I was simply increasing
the efficiency of MT fusion plants by 1000.)

The efficiency is in the table, because I figured in the scale efficiency
from the rules. (I don\'t know if they\'re reasonable). Some of the low tech
fusion plants have minimum size that are above the size for large scale plants.
(The TL 9 early fusion plant has a minimum size of 20 Kl which is above
the 11 Kl figure that triples fusion plant output.) On the other hand, not
all plants can be build under the lowest scale efficiency (which cuts down
output by 75%).

My major concern is about the balance in the design system when this table
is used. Nuclear powered starships can use their maneuver drive, weapons, etc.
now for years and still have much less space devoted to fuel storage than
before. I haven\'t done designs with it yet, but it would influence 
design in many ways. Commercial ships can have much more cargo space,
military ships can have much more weapons with a higher energy usage and
get much more expensive this way...

One way out of this would be to drop the reactionless drives and keep
only antigrav drives and have fusion rockets for deep space maneuvering. 
The thrust of anti grav would not drop by 50% after
10 planetary diameters but I would use something like 
100 % for up to 10 diameters
 50 % beyond 10 diameters
 25 % beyond 20 diameters
 11 % beyond 30 diameters
 6  % beyond 40 diameters 
 4  % beyonf 50 diameters
 and so on down to 1 % or no thrust beyond 100 diameters 

This way, spaceships are forced to use fusion rockets when they are going to
another planet but anti grav would be enough to reach geostationary orbit.
The fuel for the fusion rockets must be then included on top of the
fuel for the power plant(s). This could perhaps even thing out a bit.
There was a table about fusion rockets on the list a year ago or so.
The consumpition rate was around 1 KL per hour per 200 thrust if I 
remember correctly. The table was not complete but perhaps the one who 
posted it has worked on it since then ? 
The nice side effect would be the elemination of the reactionless thrusters
and their physical impossiblities.

(High Tech)Deep Space going craft would then have three drive systems. 
Antigrav for use inside a planets atmosphere. (I don\'t like the
idea of using fusion rockets inside an atmosphere.)
Fusion rockets outside the 10 diameter limit.
And jump drive for interstellar distances.

Mike writes a long and deeply felt article, which I 
to a large degree sympathize with.

I would, however, like to share with the Traveller
Mailing List a quote from something that Hans wrote
up, which is (I hope) going to be on the first real
page of the Aoreriyya Dawn sourcebook we\'re pounding
pieces of together:


>     "Domain of Deneb goes off the air immediately.
>     We keep the flame. Good luck."
>         -- Deneb, 1130
>
>     "Anybody got a light?"
>         -- Aoreriyya, 1200


I agree with Mike that what was done to the Third Imperium
was pretty depressing, from a "where\'d my Imperium go???"
point of view.  I enjoyed over 12 years of gaming in the
third imperium myself, and have had a few small contributions
to it here and there.  It felt sort of comfortable, and sort
of homey after all these years, and I miss it.

Well, that\'s gone.  I support Mike\'s effort to do a "It never
happened" sourcebook, and if asked (and if I have the time)
would help with it.  But following what happened in the official
Rebellion I agree with GDW that the Imperium couldn\'t have
been saved.

Traveller has to a large degree become a blank slate.
If we can put our feelings about the demise of the previous
regime behind us, we can make that which succeeds the
Third Imperium as interesting a place as the Imperium was.
I see this as the challenge of the hour, and I am honored
that GDW has let the tne-pocket crew have a crack at
doing so, at least in our corner of Reavers Deep 8-)

I will be holding a wake for the Third Imperium at some
point (anyone who can make it to Berkeley is welcome).
But I also hope to help launch something new.

Extremely so.  US Naval nuclear reactors are enriched rather higher than 60%,
with no problems, and we have a better safety record than civilian reactors
do...

No, actually it isn\'t.  In either case...

Enriched fuel costs more than non-enriched fuel, but then we don\'t
use breeder reactors to MAKE enriched fuel (in large amounts).  And we
don\'t have fusion reactors to convert U-238 to something fissionable
just by parking the 238 next to the reaction chamber...

Of course, they allow people to have fusion reactors, and starships that
can slam a planet a Hell of a lot harder than any nuclear weapon you could
build.  Note also that 80% enriched fuel is pretty much useless as a weapon,
but allows you to build a nuclear reactor that is MUCH, MUCH smaller than
what you can build at 5%.

No.  This is false.  Enriching radioactives is only difficult when you are
talking about U-238 and U-235.  Breeder reactors do it easily.  Fusion
reactors make it so simple that any high-school student could do it.

And frankly, it hasn\'t been terribly difficult since about the sixties, even
with modern technology...

Actually, I expect that in that case, they would use jump-drive to go
between planets.  Remember that it is faster to micro-jump to Pluto than
to go in real-space, even with 6G maneuver drives...

Impossibilities?  Hmmm...  Perhaps you should PROVE their "impossibility"
sometime.  Just to prove you can...

I\'m with Mike here.  I can certainly understand the desire of the folks at
GDW to update the game system.  I\'m not really hung up on game systems, per
se, despite all the fooling around that I\'ve done with the MT design rules.
I don\'t agree with the perceived need for the update, but that is a long
digression that has no place here today.

The trouble that I have is that the new setting is DULL.  Ho hum...another
planet full of barbarians.  How clever can I be today?  "Yo, Starblade, bring
me my laser rifle...those guys have blowguns and they look a little more
dangerous than the last batch." :-( :-P  Was it here that someone mentioned
H. Beam Piper\'s "Gunpowder God" recently?  If not, they should have.  For
those of you unfamiliar with the works of Piper (shame on you! a seminal
influence on Traveller), "GG" is effectively an early draft of what became
_Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen_, a story of a 17th century tech level kingdom
menaced by its neighbors when their supply of gunpowder is cut off by the
priesthood of Styphon, a rather political religious organization which
zealously guards the secret of the manufacture of gunpowder in order to
maintain its authority over the secular authorities.  However, the similarity
ends there: In _Lord Kalvan_, the kingdom is located on an alternative time-
line, and is saved by the arrival of a Pennsylvania state policeman who is
accidentally dropped there after being caught up in a parallel-time machine
malfunction.  Calvin Morrison (Kalvan) fortunately knows the military history
of our own 17th century thoroughly, and is able to apply the lessons learned
to the situation in which he finds himself.  In "GG", the kingdom is located
on a distant planet and is saved by the intervention of a trading company
scout team with contra-gravity vehicles and machine guns, who massacre the
opposition in the course of a couple of days.

One of these is an exciting adventure story; the other was only reprinted
to round out an author\'s Complete Works collection.  What is the difference?
In Kalvan, the hero is challenged by the situation and has to struggle for
success.  In "GG", the heroes smash everything in sight without working
up a sweat.  

Our games should resemble the former more than the latter.  The advantage of 
the Old Imperium was that there were many planets providing _different_
levels of challenge, allowing the referee to provide interesting situations
without straining our sense of disbelief.  How is a ref supposed to keep 
a game challenging when nearly every obstacle in the path of the characters
can be removed by blowing everything to bits?  It\'s not even like the Imperials
will hunt you down and send you to the Prison Planet (Adventure 8 (-:) if you
do something too antisocial.  Sure, you _could_ play the game without falling
into the "I\'ve got the biggest gun" rut, but the internal checks and balances
of the setting have been removed.

Ah well--I\'ve always maintained a continuously progressing timeline in my
own infrequent games, and for _me_, the year is still 1108.  It\'ll take
me a while to get to the point where I have to decide about the Rebellion.

Is civilization collapsing up there, ahead of me?  We\'ll see when we get 
there.  But if it is, I think the universe is going to be a dull sort of 
place, without the ability to inspire the near-fanatical devotion that we
oldtimers seem to have for the game.

If I remember my fusion physics correctly,  most of the energy released in
a fusion reactor is carried away in the form of atomic and subatomic
particles.  The JET experiment in plasma confinement indicated that  the
proposed follow up reactor experiments would require a Lithium blanket to
absorb the most dangerous products, and the generated heat would be fed
off to produce electricity.  In addition, it may be possible to tap the
energy of particles not absorbed by Lithium (and the other sheild
materials) by using a sort of reverse particle accelerator.  As to
neutrinos, as they have virtually no mass, and only posess the property of
\'spin\', and an electron and a proton (or heavier particles) are produced
with every neutrino, I do not think that significant energy loss will be
due to neutrinos.

In Traveller terms, the TL 9 reactors are production models of the current
experimental plans, while the increased efficiency comes from a
combination of perfection of particle accelerator technology, and the
introduction of gravitic (to supplement magnetic) plasma confinement. 
Given the existence of neutrino sensors, it may be ossible to \'capture\'
the energy lost by neutrino emission.  However, as powerplants are
detected by neutrino sensors according to their output, regardless of TL,
this is either not widespread or not efficient.

No and yes

Damage locations

 1  Head
 2  Upper R Torso
 3  Upper L Torso
 4  Lower torso
 5  R Arm
 6  L Arm
 7  Upper R leg
 8  Lower R leg

Roll for hit location.
Then apply damage to table

In our Cyberpunk campaigns we divide weapon damage to arms and legs
by two but double that done to the head region.

ALL WOUNDS ARE CUMULATIVE

In some less-deadly campaigns it would be advisable to increase the
damage increments on the Wound Table

Instead of 1-2
           3-4
           5-6

use   1-3
      4-6
      7-9

OK

Live long and prosper in the New Era

Here are some useful news articles.  They are in need of polishing up
due to my being at work without any sourcebooks.

132-1231 Capitol/Core:  The Imperial government today announced that 
the rumors of Emperor Strephan\'s death are greatly exaggerated.  All 
citizens are urged to report sources of such rumors to the nearest 
Bureau of State Security office.

132-1231 Trin/Trin\'s Veil: The "Arrivial Vengance" which had been 
missing from orbital dock returned today.  The Vengance reported 
that the Imperium has NOT fallen, and that the Emperor Strephan is 
in good health.

170/1231 Esalin/Jewell: The Zhodani Government exchanged long lost
Imperial citizen Mark Miller for an undesclosed number of Imperial 
captured Zhodani spies.  The captured spies had been attempting to
incite rebellion within the Imperium.  The spies were captured days
earlier in a raid by the IISS.

I talked to a friend of mine who is very interseted in these kinds of
things and he thought there was a book called HANDGUN STOPPING POWER by
someone named Evan Marshall.  It would probably tell you more than you
ever needed to know.

I did find this in my notes.

handgun round		1 shot stop percentage
 .380ACP			50% - 75%
 .45ACP			62% - 88%
9mm Para		62% - 91%
 .357 Mag		75% - 96%

A one shot stop was defined as the target stopped attacking (dropped
weapon etc) or if the target is running that he falls to the ground after
at most 4 steps...

The results supposedly were compiled from actual shootings.

So how does this compare to my dammage system?  

I broke habdguns down into 3 categories Light, Substansive and Greivious.

I would say that your typical .380 hardball FMJ is a light
 .45ACP and 9mm para is a medium (substansive) 
and the the Magnums are heavy (greivious)

I hope that this helps a little

> Recreating Star Wars using Traveller is a matter of making a number

the  Star Wars blaster as a laser pistol, 

the only thing I can think of is a weak plasma pistol, best fits the
bill although you could make a good pulse laser argument, actually the
more I think about it I would probably use the laser for the damage in
Traveller. If I were using the Trav/T:TNE system for star wars I would
probably use both the laser and plasma depending on how heavy a weapon
it is, and to whom it belongs (heavier stuff is illegal ;-)).

>and the Force as straight psionics.

Well yes and no, the Jedi were able to do some absolutely astounding
things, and I don\'t see an exact equivalency here, the Traveller
Psionics are quite a bit weaker, so I feel that when you tap into the
"Force" you are no longer using psi points to gain your effects. The
only way to learn how to do this is find a teacher ( good luck ;-), it
is possible, a couple of members of my group have met such a person but
don\'t know him/her yet).

> It\'s the light saber that is hard to translate, since I can\'t come up
with a good explanation for it that doesn\'t involve force field tech
that Traveller doesn\'t have.

	Not that hard.  The light saber is, essentially, ancient
technology in the hands of a small religious sect, powered (if I recall
correctly) by the psionic energy of the user (aka The Force).  Light
sabers in Star Wars weren\'t something you could pick up down at the
corner Sears.  They were legendary in their ability to penetrate
whatever you stuck \'em in, only the jedi had \'em, and the jedi built
their own. Steven J. Owens

I agree with this, and I am using an idea from DGP Digest # 14, 15, 16,
and 17. " The Order of the White Star" an order of Psionic knights
formed in 640 by the direct order of Empress Arbellatra, and was open
to any knight with psionic powers, "They had gained some amount of fame
due to the valor of their members." in 824 they were betrayed and
destroyed,(sounds like the jedi to me :-)), and there is no mention of
it in present library data. It went underground and still exists and is
dedicated to upholding the Empire. Unfortunately there is a group that
fled to the sword worlds and are called the Order of the Red star ,
they are dedicated to overthrowing the Empire that threw them out. Some
of the Nobility know of the White Star and some times will Knight a
person into it ( all under cover ;-)). As you can see this adds even
more complexity to an already complex political situation.

Pallique: M. Metlay produced an interesting planet I may use it, but
with the changes caused by the changing fortunes of the Imperium I
think that there might be some changes going on. ( could make the place
even more dangerous! ;-) ). I think that he did a good design on it and
it fits the purpose of the owners very well and  that can do for an
explanation for it\'s conditions. Scott 2-G Kellog(g) :-) et, all this
was posted as an example and for use, if you see fit I think we have
used more than enough band width over it. Bored are we? Just waiting
for  T:TNE Eh? :-) On to another subject: some of my players thought I
should post this... ( Sigh... I can see the flames rising around me...
:-) ).

 We have been thinking a lot about the Zhodani lately and getting into
their heads ( different, but fun :-) ) Scott might not agree with some
of our conclusions but here are a couple. They are a conservative
people with a very strong sense of propriety, Due to the pervasive use
of telepathy they are a culture heading towards stagnation ( Most
individuals would not notice or realize this trend ). They depend on
the tavrchedl to take care of all of their problems. Because of this
they are also very law abiding. They also tend to think of us, (
sneaky, under-handed, lying, evil ), Denebians as shockingly informal.
Patience is not something that they are long on either, as they are so
direct and forthright. While I am on the subject here is something
Catie and I came up with over some coffee ( it is ALWAYS over coffee
:-) ). What do Zhodani Guards or Commandos do during those long
jumps...? Here it is. We bring you: Ta Da! Telepuck...

It\'s a simple game. You divide the teleports into two teams ( your
offensive line ). Anyone else who wants to play is on either team ( the
defensive line ). There are three goals... one for each team and one
for the puck... Oh yea! the puck. The puck is a nonteleport who can use
any of the resources of the ship ( no lethal weapons or force allowed
). If the puck can make it to his/her goal, the puck wins. Game over.
If one of the teams carries the puck from three meters outside of their
goal, into it, they win. If a player injures the puck, the puck wins by
forfeit. ( Psionic control is necessary for the games... ). If the puck
should injure a player, oh well. Telepathy may be used for locating or
communications, but not control. As you can see it can be a lot like
rugby. It is, after all, a full contact sport. Usually, one team or the
other will win, but if the puck is resourceful, he/she can win. An
interesting idea, no? They probably have teams throughout the
Consulate, and resourceful pucks are much honored. ( As you can tell,
we spend a lot of game time on what our characters are doing during
jump :-). In fact  I  feel that a lot of gammers miss out on this, "So
ok we\'re in jump when we get out..."                                   
            Really guys, if you have been jumping and skimming and
jumping, your crew is going to get weird on you, practical jokes etc.
and after a few weeks they WILL WANT OFF... ask any submariner you know
how 6 weeks under water affects them.

cycle of a generation change. The clientel for the gaming industry
is different now. Is it surprising that we no longer find it
attractive?
	When we reach the point where after making some off-handed
comment at a convention about rolling on some table to be turned to 
and have sneered at me "Dice? We don\'t need no stinking dice!"
(and *they* were playing Paranoia). This is the age of Angst and
Cathartic role-playing.
	Most new players of RPGs today were still in diapers when
Star Wars was first released. They are barely aware of a Star Trek
before the Next Generation. They watch Forbidden Planet and laugh
at the special effects.
	It\'s not for us they write anymore.

	But what to do?
	The temptation is to close the coffin, join the funeral
dirge and pass on. Just like all our friends who used to role-play.
Maybe our kids will understand.
	But it is people like you and me, Rob Dean and company that
have resisted the pull of Old Age and kept gaming. Who were sneered
at by their elders and betters for playing make-believe and told
"you\'ll grow out of it". We who swore a vow that well keep gaming
till he have grandchildren. Can we give up now?
	I never liked the Rebellion. Not three months ago did I find 
all the Classic Traveller books on sale and buy them all. Hell, I still 
prefer 1st Edition AD&D. When 2nd Edition AD&D came out I was very
dissapointed. A great opportunity had been missed. Of the new released
products I found fewer and fewer usable (and fewer and fewer affordable).
	But then, with 10 years of inertia behind my campaign I
was writing most of my own material anyway. Given the derath of support
for Traveller over the years by GDW/Digest can you honestly say that
you have been relying on their supplements for the continuation of
your own campaign? Do you not have enough experience to move from 90%
of your own work to 100%? Where is the courage of your own convictions?
	I really began to understand the generation gap two weeks ago.
A new fellow in the campaign expressed suprise that I had something that
would play "vinals" attached to my stereo system. He brought some of his
parent\'s collection over to hear. He didn\'t know how to work it. He didn\'t
know about wiping the record when you put it on. He didn\'t know what to
do when it skipped. He didn\'t even know that you could tell where each
track started by the gap on the record.
	Our age, and the age we started playing these games at makes
us Dinosaurs. There will always be more people who don\'t understand us
at games conventions than who do. But with the experience of the hobby
we have there is no reason we can\'t just keep going. My own campaign
spans the age groups from 14 to 28. The younger ones know my style is
not like any of their friends but they see that there is equal merit
there.
	Keep going.

	Being only distantly informed of The New Era setting, I too, agree
in that it seems rather boring. Or rather, interesting if you are into
that, and only that, sort of thing. However, I would offer a partial
solution. One that allows you to keep your 3rd imperium and all its
interest but still gives you an excuse to buy the new material and get
something out of it.
	In playing with the AD&D rules I devised a wonderful variant
that got rid of classes and levels. I thought it was great but I knew
it would be totally impratical to change all the inertia already built
up in my campaign. My solution was to have the rules apply to a certain
point earlier in the history of my campaign universe.
	The Long Night happened once. The Rebellion was supposed to be
a prelude to a second Long Night. Are the specifics that different so
that you couldn\'t run The New Era material set in the original Long Night?
How dependant is the new setting on the events leading to the arrivial
of the setting or how depenant is it on the existance of widespread
barbarism itself?
	If a particularly interesting supplement for TNE comes out
why not run it as a break for your players. If your 3rd Imperium characters
are dealing with adventures relating to The Long Night, possibily in an
archeological sense, it might make for interesting tie-ins. More blantant
plot-devices are Long Night characters getting trapped in an Ancient\'s
statis field and being brought to adventure in the 3rd Imperium once
The Long Night got boring. Rather more blantant is some 3rd Imperium characters
finding a time-gate back to The Long Night (I find backwards time travel
distasteful, though).
	It could be a really interesting once-off convention adventure
having one table playing a TNE/Long Night adventure involving the recovery
of an ancient artifact that suddenly energises, and another table playing
a 3rd Imperium adventure on an archeological dig around the same
artifact. Suddenly the two adventures are joined ending up in either
time-line. THAT would be an adventure worthy of Classic Traveller.

	Keep positive.
	Keep thinking.
	Keep gaming.

    'topic' => 'wound effects in the task related dammage system',
    'body' => '
Thank you for your comments.  Most of my local players don\'t like the task
dammage system so I\'m glad SOMEONE does!

I think that there are something like 7 versions of the TASK system
floating around so bear with me if I don\'t follow the exact format.

Wound Effects:

Scratch/Bruise		I dunno maybe a -1 to the roll for all tasks that
			use the area wounded.  
			(for the d20 system only, no effect otherwise)

Light Wound		-1 to Inititive (cumulative)

Substantive Wound	Increase the level of difficulty of all tasks by one

Greivious Wound		Fall unconscious Bleed a Lot

Mortal Wound		Fall Dead (as expected)

- ----
When you take a wound you roll vs. your Willpower, Determination, whatever
the game system has that fits this idea.

Success means that you ignore the wound.

Failure means that you must take all of the stacked up wound effects,
realize that you are hurt and deal with the wounds as best as you can.

- ----
At the end of a combat you take all of the wound effects that were
successfully ignored during the fight. "Gosh! I\'m Bleeding"

First Aid:	Handle it according to your game rules

Notes:		It is possible to fight beyond death in this system.  This
may not be *real* but we are playing a game and the *point* is to have fun
and I think it may be more heroic.

		Combat is very uncertain.  Most games make it everything
but uncertain.  AD&D:  an arrow does say 1D6 I have 52 Hit points therefore
it the bad guy has an arrow pointed at me I rush him take the hit which
has no detrimental effect and hopefully wipe him out.  I hate this! 
Wounds hurt!  They slow you down!  They make everything harder!

		I haven\'t really included dammage ratings for weapons
because this IMO is very campaign specific and at least in the modern
world out of date almost before I can find out about it.  So figure them
out as you like for your own campaigns.

Suggestions:

Have the weapon dammage rating be the typical dammage delivered from a typical
strike.  This lets the less vital / vital / very vital hit locations to
work for good, bad, and typical hits.

IMO 10% of the Human Bod is less vital
    80% is vital and 
    10% is very vital
 	
    Provided for random hit location


Armor:

If the Armor could stop the attack from contacting the flesh, drop the
wound level by 2 steps to a minimum of Scratch/Bruise

If not, then drop the level of the wound by 1 step if you think the armor
should reduce the dammage.

- ----
The purpose of this article was to show that there might be a better way. 
We could look at combat from a differant perspective and make it more
*real* instead of more detailed.

I hope you like it and it wasn\'t a wasted of \'bandwidth\'

__________________________________________________________________

Hi again; Catie is doing my post part 2:
topsy... no that was Little Stevie Wonder...

Next: I have had Survival Margin for almost a month along with MegaTrav
Journal #4. Found them the same day in the same shop. GameScape, 333
Divisidero, San Francisco. Survival Margin: I have to also give it two
thumbs up. If this is an example of the quality of GDW\'s new stuff I am
looking forward to T:TNE. I have read most of the objections to the
scenario of the Regency, I somewhat agree with them, but I am willing
to work around it in view of the plot device. The Virus: As a computer
jock, I have a problem, but granting the existance of the Cymbeline
life form, and I can not find myself denying the possibility,
especially when one of my players has more problems with the Vargr as
a possible life form; had to do with the bone structure and build; as
she designed sculptures that had believable internal structure, and
studied that, so they would.  She also had problems with them wearing
bucket topped boots, and pants on a furred race doesn\'t make a whole
lotta sense. ( ducking and running for cover screaming "No Flames, No
Flames...ARRRRRRRGH!" :-)) I can believe the virus ... just maybe... (
getting back to the point.) I loved the quotes from the "papers" of the
movers and shakers, How many of you read those carefully? ( lets see a
show of hands :-), Ok).

- -- SPOILER -- SPOILER -- SPOILER -- SPOILER -- SPOILER -- SPOILER --

Ok I guess I gave enough warning...

IRIS ???! I guess they put one over on all of us pretty good, hunhg!

Project Longbow... I wonder what that\'s all about. I notice that was
where Strephon was going when "he" was assassinated, and he couldn\'t
tell anybody about it! If I read Pentecost\'s report right; whatever it
is, should arrive at Meridian 78, Prime Redial, ( where ever that is -
any of you have a clue? :-)), in 1205 ! and are the Zhodani victims
just as we are ?? what is Jumpstart it looks like interesting times in
70 years. never mind that my group is not through 1118 yet I\'d still
like to know what is in store for us. I will probably play through the
approching "interesting times" especially the getting closer of the
Domain and the Consulate. Then there is the next Core Expedition due to
leave in 1150 or 1160. How about a combined Zhodani - Domain crewed
expedition?

I converted one of my player characters from MT to T:TNE. It wasn\'t to
hard except for her psionics I\'ll have to wait for the rules for that,
Oh well.

Journal #4: Was one of the best DGP has done yet. Sadly the last
Traveller thing they will do. In the editorial they mention the titles
that they now will never put out. Hummm, I wonder if some one could get
the information that they had on "Zhodani and Droyne", "K\'Kree and
Hivers", "Humans and Non - humans" , and "Robots and Cyborgs" for
publication if promised that the quality would be equal or better than
the previous stuff, It\'d have to be converted ( Yet again ! ;-), Oh! I
think I see...) Lords of Thunder: a very well thought out campaign from
William H Keith Jr. I recommend it VERY highly it has some wonderful
detail and some unknown material about the K\'Kree. Good stuff!  as well
as Gateway sector,Pirates, Pirate hunters,races of the sector. a K\'Kree
vocabulary. All this is Campaign material! an article on "Imperial"
Law, Custom Ship Add-ons ( I like this one! ;-)), and I think my group
is going to be looking at it closely one likes the swimming pool, but I
think the illegal stuff will be their picks, an extended Q&A includes a
discussion of the Primordials, A three page discussion of their new
game AI, as well as a special offer for Traveller players, and a
potpourri of stuff called Through the years. Which has unpublished
memos from their archives giving their ideas for the future of
traveller, some are good ideas some are not useable
in my campaign but others may find them useable. "The Badies from the
Core" Yup you guessed it ;-) the evil brain sucking Zho\'s, ( Again
reaching for the asbestos pants knowing Scott 2G is out there
somewhere... ;-)), went and ran into something they can\'t handle. Ya
know, I guess great minds do think alike, I have been building toward
that very same direction for some time now. :-) Honest... really.
Overall I think that it is well worth the $12.95 for 105 pages chock
full of information. Ok, ok, so some of the artwork is reprinted it is
all nice stuff and the quality is what I\'ve come to expect of DGP.
Their new game looks good too, but it\'s not Traveller, so here is not
the place to discuss it. Good bye guys it\'s been fun and I\'ve enjoyed
every product you\'ve put out since Digest #8 ( my first one :-) ).

I think I\'ll bite the bullet, (as it were ), and go off, ( yes I know
I\'m off ;-) ), and take off on a tangent. OK Guys I\'m gonna make you
work for this one, and, I hope, a lot of band width. Just what do you
think high tech level Forensic science will be like  ( high tech level
= 13 - 15  ;-) ). How will criminal investigation work? I have only
seen this addresed in traveller as " you are on a ship in jump and you
have no equipment except your wits ( if any :-)) to find who did it." I
am thinking of a murder on ground that some of my players can get
involved in and I don\'t want the Lab to solve it for  them. I can
assume that if there are common devices that there will be illegal
methods around them but I find that I\'m outa ideas. thanks for any
ideas at all.  ( Metlay, Scott 2g, Rob Dean you guys all seem to have
opinions on everything. :-) :-) ). waiting with baited breath and
muffled oar.

I guess I\'m one of the younger generation (I was four, five? when
Star Wars came out, so I first knew of it from tacky plastic lunchboxes), 
so I\'m not quite sure which aspect of role-playing you\'re lamenting, but 
I\'d like to point out that serious, intelligent gaming aids are not 
entirely dead.  Steve Jackson Games still uses small print and 
proofreaders for their GURPS supplements.

On the other hand (aside from the rudeness, but then gamers are and
have always been a universally well-adjusted lot, yes?) I sympathise
entirely with the "who needs dice?" point of view, and I thought AD&D2
was an improvement (aside from the type size), so maybe I really
don\'t have a clue what you\'re talking about.

I kind of like your damage system but I\'m a bit confused about it.  Maybe I\'ve
been using the (hit/check location/check damage) system for too long.

How do you  modify wound type for armour?   and what happens when a character
has received n light wounds (for example).  How many does it take for him to
fall?

Just one last comment.  I didn\'t testplay your system yet but at 1st hand it
seems incredibly realistic form the victims point of view. Really nice

Pedro


PS: I just thought of solutions for the above.  about armour one can use it
as an asset for the task.  But this doesn\'t solve the cumulative effect of
several wounds.  maybe a solution is to use a 1 to 10 damage instead of the
5 types related to task difficulty.  Then the level of the wound would be an
asset for a (routine?) task.  Past wound woulds also act as assets adding to
the new one.

I too have never liked the Rebellion, which is why at present I am
working my group into position to game \'The Traveller Adventure\'
personally I like the way the Adventure works. Also I equipped them
with the ship from Annic Nova. :-) One thing I did do is give them a
cantankerous(sp?) AI Computer sort of loosely based on Slave from
Blake 7. BTW, the Fifth Frontier War should start in my campaign in
about two years of game time. And when it does hopefully my party will
get to be in the thick of it.

Unfortunately, I don\'t have the time. I know that I could not do what
Metlay does, of course it is obvious to me that he is a type A
personality. I am definitely not. I like to use many of the old
adventure, because most are pretty well written and complete and I
don\'t use the MT rules for much more than rolling up characters.
Everything else is sort of "OK, roll." I think of a number that they
need to succeed and say if they do or not. Sort of seat of the pants
stuff. I just try to be consistant. I have always felt that rules in
role playing games should be a frame work, not engraved in Granite.

I have a player that was born when I was in High School, and he always
says to me, "Records, how quaint" but when you have the record
collection I have you need a turntable. I am in the process of
upgrading my Stereo system, and it is very difficult to find a
reasonably priced system that includes a turntable.

Gee, you guys are young, my last group went from 18-35. A Pendragon
campaign that I ran, I\'m 35, had a member that was 50. Although I must
admit that since I started gaming back in the early 80\'s, 1981 to be
exact, I do start to feel like a Dinosaur. Most folks my age have
given up gaming. I admit that I don\'t do it very regularly anymore,
even though I am the GM. It is difficult to find a night that everyone
is free at the same time.

I don\'t know if you have played the game Pendragon, but one of the
reasons that I like it so much is its combat system. You have a set
number of hit points as in most games and weapons do a certain range
of hit points damage but the system if very elegant and simple to use.
Basically each player in combat makes a roll. You succeed by rolling
your skill or less on a D20. If you roll you skill exactly you have a
critical success and double the amount of dice to roll for damage. If
your opponent succeeds, then the one with the higher roll is the
attacker and the other is the defender who has been able to get his
shield in the way of the blow. You then roll for damage subtracting
the amount of armor from your damage if the result is greater than
zero then that damage is applied as a wound. Very simple system with
very little rolling to resolve combat. 

The reason that I bring this up is the the way that they handle
unconsciencness. There is a point, 1 quarter of your hit points, which
you have a chance to fall unconscience. If you go below this level
then for every action that you attempt, you must roll a successful
Valor roll. I feel this system works well. One thing that I have
always hated was too many rolls. One of the reasons that I have
avoided playing RuneQuest and Chivalry and Sorcery.

Well, I don\'t know if you have ever seen the Classic Traveller
Adventure "Murder on Arturus Station" But I feel it is a classic.
You\'re party is asked by the station manager to help solve the murder
of someone aboard the station. It is a very well done module. And the
best thing is that you can change the killer each time that you play
the adventure, so even someone who has played the Adventure could do
it again the next time because the solution can be different each
time. Unfortunately it does not rely on forsenic science so there are
no helps there. It relies on character interaction, which I think is
the best part of role playing anyway. The GM has to play many parts
male and female each with their own motives and alibis. If you can
find it pick it up I think it may help. It has the feel of the Maltese
Falcon or an Agatha Christy murder mystery. Except in this case all
the clues are there for the hunting. What it basically boils down to
is good ole police work. Searching for clues and talking to suspects.
Of course everyone is a suspect and almost all have means, motive and
opportunity.

Well, I got Survival Margin yesterday, and I have to say it is an
excellent quality product.  I must admit, after hearing Metlay and
Rob Dean\'s comment on it, plus the fact that the first half of the
book is dedicated to describing the masochistic death throws of the
game universe we have come to know and enjoy, I was not thrilled by
most of the content of it.  I now christen the book by it\'s
unofficial nickname:  S & M.

But basically, what do we have left?

The Spinward Marches is more or less intact.  Now remember that the
Marches is *THE* most detailed part of the entire Imperium.  There
are PLENTY of worlds in there for the type of adventure that we
have come to enjoy of the entire Imperium.  Rhylanor is still
there.  Regina, Mora and all the other high tech high population
planets that cause our imaginations to palpitate.

Confession time:
I have always felt uncomfortable trying to deal with the whole
bloody 3rd Imperium.  11,000 planets?  I have enough trouble trying
to understand how 240 million people on one CONTINENT can behave
(USA) I can\'t deal with trying to try and figure out what the whole
Imperium must be like.

I know I know I know.  I\'ve seen Wildstar\'s projections of the
Imperial budget.  We all have...  Comprehend them?  Me?  FORGET IT!
S&M says that the Regency is basically the same old Imperium on a
smaller scale.  It\'s... What?  1/8th of the size of the Imperium?
Ok class, now what\'s Infinity divided by 8?

Infinity.  Dig?

The Regency is still too large for me to fully estimate.  To say
that the reduction in scale will affect campaigns is kinda silly to
me.

What *IS* lost are the areas of the Imperium that were interesting
because they were DIFFERENT from the Spinward Marches.  Gone are
the Vargr-Human integrated cultures of Antares.  Gone are the
Vilani cultures of Vland.  Gone are the Solomani and their
machinations.  Gone are the K\'Kree and their...  frozen vegetables.

It is a great shame that in order to save the Regency, they had to
close the borders off.  If the refugees from these areas had come
in, it could have kept all of what I consider to be the good parts
of the 3rd Imperium.

Still, what *IS* left is my personal favorite part of the Imperium.
The Gveug Vargr are still there.  The Aslan Ihati are still there.
And the Zhodani are now the strongest force in the galaxy.

And who\'s to say that those other cultures WON\'T show up in the
Regency?  There *are* Vilani worlds in the Marches.  There would
have been K\'Kree and Hivers cut off from their homelands, cut off
by the border closings.  The Solsec agents, cut off from the
confederation could have finally set up the Spinward Marches branch
of the Solomani Party.  Now that the Vargr are at least partially
to thank for the saving of the Regency, maybe new integrated
cultures will spring forth.

So maybe we Didn\'t lose so much after all.  We can only hope so.

What has changed?  Psionics.  BOO!!!  I liked psi the way it was.
Hard to get and you better keep it HIDDEN.  Despite my strong
interest in the Zho\'s, I don\'t like psi.  Especially easily
obtainable psi.  I\'d rather have people use their wits and
technology to get out of trouble.  I don\'t like magic.  And face it
psi is just magic spelled differently.  The legalization of psi
will decrease the enmity between the Zho\'s & the (Regents?).  Well,
that whole psi and anti-psi bit was too much fun for me.  I\'m
sorrowed by it\'s passing.

Ok, so what do we GET for our losses?  Well, actually, I have to
admit, the remains of the Imperium start to look a lot more like my
own visions of my own version of the Traveller universe.  You may
recall from the 4.5th Frontier War, that my campaigns are almost
exclusively set in Iakr sector (Foreven to you Imps) which is just
spinward of the Marches.

Iakr was a sector I put together from worlds I made up, found in
amber zone articles, bits and pieces I found about Traveller and
even other game systems where I thought the idea was neat.  All of
it was outside the Imperium, and 80 % was outside the Consulate.
Sure, things got transplanted around.  The Dynchia got pulled in
from clear across the Imperium.  I pulled subsectors out of
Reaver\'s Deep.  I pulled \'em out of Trojan Reach & Far Frontiers.
Jungleblut Subsector from FASA was a personal fave.

Well, in Iakr, there are a lot of technologically poor worlds.  Or
worlds with weird technologies.  I recently made notes on putting
a version of Metlay\'s Pallique in there.  (I think it\'s a neat
idea, I just don\'t think it would really work inside the Imperium.)
Some of you may recall the chapters of the 4.5th Frontier War:
Down on Welles.  The world I came up with would never fit inside
the Imperium, but outside it worked.  It WOULD work in the TNE
Imperium.  A world conquered by a Technologically Elevated
Dictator, (equipped with grav powered Ironclads ala Space: 1889)
being invaded by rival bands of space vikings.

I wanted an opportunity to explore the planets I\'d come up with.
With every world in the Imperium detailed (or some kind of detail
available to the players) there was no real opportunity for that.
Well, now they\'re gonna be publishing exploration and contact
adventures for planets which will FIT inside Iakr for me!  Lots of
unknown worlds surrounded by technologically advanced power hungry
neighbors.  (But don\'t count on me to be running a boot strap or
virus campaign any time soon.)

And furthermore, (if S&M\'s quality is any clue) these worlds will
be well thought out and free of typos!

About Longbow, I have my suspicions.  Longbow was supposed to
started long back five hundred years back.  TL 10-11-12?  Well, it
either sounds like a long range faster than light communications
system, or what I\'d consider more likely:  Stutterwarp.  By making
it TL 10-11-12, that way it makes Stutterwarp a lot easier to
obtain.  Alternately it could be the Star Gates again.

All in all, I guess I\'m looking forward to TNE.  Ya\'ll hear that?
I\'ll buy.  It has to be better than the MegaTrav setting.  I always
hated the rebellion.  I just hope there\'s a good craft & robot
design system.

that Jim Kellerer receives this post... Thanx!!

	Well Jim, I have taken to stealing from other games and supplements and 
trying to make a conversion to MegaTrav that I feel is resonable. Here\'s one
example...


FORENSICS KIT

This is a portable forensics lab, with a dedicated computer system capable of 
detection and chemical analysis of evidence. As well as ballistics analysis and 
finger and voice printing, the lab is capable of identifying and classifying 
hair,flesh scrapings and blood samples, and using them to determine the owner\'s 
genetic pattern. It is usually linked to a database containing detailed records 
on suspects to aid identification. Also contained is a still camera with 
reader. It comes in it\'s own carrying case.

	TL   Volume       Weight            Price
	----
	12   30.0 litres  30.0 Kilograms    Cr 9,000



Aside:
	Well, I dunno. I put together this little thing to make my life a little
	more relaxing. Actually, it\'s pretty well stolen from the Criminology Kit
	in GURPS Cyberpunk, page 54. (Lawsuit???) but very bare bones translated.
	I figure the "Dedicated Computer" is some kinda expert system. Could be
	linked to a central database by comlink or cellular modem (whatever).
	For my purposes, the computer is a model/1bis. That\'s what the Hand
	Computer is supposed to be. Sure, there\'s a lotta room in the case for more
	hardware, but that\'s all they really need. The sensors are stolen from 
	the Electronic Locks section. Sure, they\'re a little more accurate, but
	it\'s a decent start for a homegrown piece of work. I have brought the 
	Cyberpunk and Ultratech Battery types into Traveller to make my life
	easier, seeing Trav won\'t make my life easy! Never could find definitive
	information about power pack size for laser weapons and other things.
	The above contraption runs off a C cell for three months. Powerful little
	cells. You could up the ante and put in more gizmos, but this should do.

	For the still camera above, I use a Digital Camera, which will get 3000
	still photos or 1 hour of video (Huh? ah well. probably a weak comarison.
	but it\'s my rule. Don\'t like it? Change it!) per 1.5 Gigabyte disk.

Anyhow, that\'s the stuff. Hope it helps. 

And to Loren Wiseman, where ever He may be... A question.

	My local hobby store, Timemasters, cannot bring in Traveller stuff \'cause
their supplier doesn\'t seem to have any in supply. Strange. They say that they
have been trying to get through to GDW to place orders and get left on hold.
To be frank, I don\'t care. What I\'ve been wondering is something you mentioned
about ordering through EMail for stuff and sending payment. I am trying to
get my hands on copies of things like the Starship Operator\'s guide and Book
8: Robots. I know. Robots is out of print. But if there is a chance that I 
could eliminate the middleman and order straight from GDW, I\'d be thrilled.

	Is this a reasonable idea? If not, sorry for bringing it up. If it is...

		DETAILS PLEASE!

	Thanks for the time...

	Now back to your regularly scheduled diversion...

  I don\'t think the error is on GDW\'s side. Here in Gothenburg (Sweden) we 
usually get whatever comes out from any company within a month of it\'s US
release. I\'d be surprised if the packages haven\'t gone over Heathrow or
Shiphol (its airfreight) on their way here, so the delay can\'t be in the
transfer times, nor at GDW.

  [Well, there\'s been trouble with Challenge here, but that seems to lie with
the distributor in the US, the resaler who buy them from GDW and resell them
overseas]

  A probable explanation is that the UK stores (and Austrialia?) don\'t order
as often as the stores here in Sweden, and when they order it might be surface
mail too? 
  The place where I usually buy rpg stuff generally gets one shipment every two
weeks and they get it directly from a distributor in the US.
  The reason why they have do it that way here is that people are used to get 
it quickly, and the store that got new stuff once every four months or so would
quickly go out of business. If there isn\'t any time competition, they can get
away with being slow and sporadic.

  So I suspect that the problem lies that the stores order too seldom, that 
they buy from a distributor in the UK that order too seldom or that they have
made a bad choise of US distributor to buy from.

Someone mentioned that they were considering building a source book for
continuing TRAVELLER on without having the Rebellion or the Virus.  I would
be interested in running in that Universe.

Suggested starting point would be the Assasination.  The Emperor is dead, long
live the Emperor.  Straight transition of power.  The big problem with the
Rebellion is that the nobles all took sides and this involved combat right
down to the planetary population level.  To trully work there has to be a
separation of the noble hierarchy and the planetary governments and populations.
I see no problem in the nobles fighting it out with their own private fleets
and such but the inperial fleets should have stood off and simply safeguarded
imperial installations and citizans.  Possibly, siding with the new Emperor
but only once officially recognized.  Until recognized, the fleets could have
stayed completely neutral.

As for the Virus ... never happened.  It\'s so far fetched that it wouldn\'t
work.


Alternate solution.  GrandFather heard the rucus and came to investigate.  Got
pissed off that a Virus had taken over his Tech 30 Computers and wiped the 
Virus out.  End of story.

Our local games shop MUST order through the Australian supplier for ALL his
games because of the monopoly here.  Don\'t say this too loud too often but
the previous owner of the shop ordered direct and the OZ supplier found out
and a lot of orders started getting accidentally lost, really slow delivery,
and other unexplained random accidents.

I think the problem in the UK is that you\'re getting surface delivery rather
than AIR.  We get surface and it takes about 2 months.

	Well, pull up a chair, sonny, and let me try to explain.
	The "new wave" role-playing style I termed "Angst and Cathartic"
role-playing. We have characters with deep personal dilemas living their
sad lives in horrible worlds. The occasional ray of hope shines but is,
by an large, overwhelmed by the gloom of being. The age of Gothic Punk,
Cyber Punk and other Dark Futures. The players vent their Angst at the
world through their characters and walk away feeling somewhat releived
through the cathartic process.
	The older style I have an easier time coming to terms with
is what I would term "Action Orientated". Things are on the move,
be they villans or heros, glorious loot lies out there for the brave,
dark secrets to ponder and life to live. The age of Fafhard and the
Grey Mouser, Indiana Jones, and Star Wars.
	[If one wants to be positively neolithic there is the really
old style typified by early Judges Guild stuff. Back when the whole
concept of Role Playing was not well defined. I don\'t think there is
anyone here old enough to prefer that style, but then ... :-]
	I am a firm beleiver in the Referee, not a Games Master.
More modern styles, and particularly "diceless" games, encourge
the Games Master to plan, develop and direct the plot so as to build
player excitement, consternation, emotion -- Angst to a peak and then
tie it off having shared a bit of themselves with everyone and perhaps
found out something about themselves. Sort of like a prayer meeting.
	In the older style I espouse, the universe is there to explore.
The Referee stands ready, as an impartial observer, to help the players,
through their characters, explore the universe, live out the lives of
their characters. The characters all have their dreams, desires, and
passions. Who knows what can happen?
	In this, dice are a great absolver. Characters cannot always
fulfill their hopes and dreams. In A&C role-playing it is the Games
Master that bears the full responsibility of what happens. I\'d feel
guilty when the characters dreams are smashed. In A.O. games the
referee is one step removed: she doesn\'t determine what happens, just
the relative chances of what might happen. The Dice take the place
of Fate and determine the course of events.
	In A&C the players succeede or fail, partially based on their
course of action, but still largely interpreted by the Games Master.
In A.O. the referee mimics the hand of fate. Good plans by the characters
don\'t tempt fate and don\'t necessarily court disaster (I\'ve done complete
sessions without rolling any dice). The player\'s successes are wholly
their successes. Their failures are wholly their failures.
	Bringing the discussion back to Traveller, Classic Traveller
(and I include Non-Rebellion MegaTraveller) it typified by vast buzzing
spaceports, big bucks for those willing to take risks, mysterious
patrons either noble or ignoble. However seldom was there a place without
sanctuary. You could always find the Traveller\'s Aid Society, snuggle
into the bar, puruse the notice board and feel safe.
	Judging by the post-rebellion adventures leading to the New Era
the world is a nasty, horrible place. Hard Times is appropriately worded
for those who have had to plow through the Dicken\'s Novel of the same
name. You back is always to the wall. Life is a struggle to survive. Never
a moment\'s peace. Humour is always gallows humour. People take risks
because life is short anyway.
	Classic Traveller is Star Wars. The New Era is Batman.
	Granted, you can play mean and nasy adventures in Classic
Traveller and I am sure you can play clean and shiny adventures in
The New Era. However the medium does not lend itself to this. This is
what I\'ve missed.
	I\'ve tried to explain. I\'ve rambled a lot. If you still can\'t
grasp what I\'m trying to say then all I can do is run a game for you.
Anytime you\'re in Dublin... :-)

I see what you\'re saying.  On the other hand, I\'d always associated
too many dice with bland, cardboard role-playing, 40-foot dragons entombed
in 50\' rooms, death-traps on the only door into the temple chamber, and
dungeons full of monsters and people who never moved unless a pc was within
20\'.

Both of us are, of course, exaggerating and stereotyping. I do share with
you a great distaste for Shadowrun, Battletech and Cyberpunk, though 
Vampire is very cool.

Gee, take away all the ref\'s fun.  Oh, the dragon should be more like 60
foot to keep the player\'s on their toes ;-)  I do agree that this sort of
happening isn\'t all that much fun to have to play through.

You must mean MechWarrior not BattleTech.  BattleTech doesn\'t have much
roleplaying in it -- just lots of shooting and heat.  One of the best
beer and pizza games I know (after \'Macho Women With Guns\' of course :-)

I had a thought a couple of weeks ago about what kinds of sports and
games will be played in the Traveller universe.  I discussed this over lunch
with a friend and we came up with a few decent ideas for sports.

While most planets are going to have local games played mostly by themselves
and nobody else, I would be surprised if some form of Imperium wide sporting
event wasn\'t held.  The recent Zhondani teleport hunt is one such possible
game even if it lacks the violence essential in a real sport ;-) and it would
not be popular in the Imperium for some small reason.

The biggest change I can see is the invention of grav plates which
allows zero gee fun on any sufficiently high tech planet.  A few obvious
candidates come to mind:  zero gee squash is definable (although some
of the rules have to be warped quite a bit) as is a real life version
of the classic arcade game pong.  Some other games will not convert over
very well, zero gee golf would be almost as interesting as the real thing
(-; and wresting (the real thing not that stupid acting version) would
not work.  High jump is another one that wouldn\'t be all that much fun
(for similar reasons javelin, discus and the other throwing athletic
events would require gravity).  Combat sports (boxing, martial arts)
also tend to rely heavily upon gravity and thus couldn\'t go to zero gee.

Of course, not all games would convert over to the gravity less alternative,
even when the conversion is possible and simple.




ZG-Squash
=========

	Played in a pleasent sealed room.  Three walls (in a U shape) are
the live walls and the ball can impact with these any number of times.
The three remaining walls are the equivalent of the front wall and floor.
The ball must hit them once before the other player can play at it and
it must not hit any of them more than twice before the other players
hits the ball.  Zero gravity will again make life interesting (think
of the reaction when you swing at the ball :-) and moving around will
require considerable bouncing skills.



ZG-Pong
=======
	Two players or teams in a room (or a long thin starship corridor)
with some form ball that bounces nastily and of course no gravity is
present.  Each player/team is allocated a home wall and they are not
allowed to touch the ball if they are too far away from that wall (paint
a line around the room to mark the safe zone).  If the ball touches your
home wall you lose.  Naturally, no form of locomotion except the players
themselves is permitted (which makes for interesting timing problems in
zero gee).

	An alternative would be to mark goals in the middle of the players\'
home walls and the ball must be kept away from there.  Also, catching and
throwing ball may or may not be permitted.  Finally, allowing only kicking
instead of throwing would result in a football (soccer for those plebs amongst
us :-) like game.




Any other suggestions?  Comments on the above?  Any possible non-zero gee
sports that might be interesting, what other technical developments could
lead to new sports??? (grav belts have a lot of potential in this reguard).

Zero gee aerobics? ---- you too can watch overweight people damaging themselves
when they lose control ;-)   Some form of dancing would have to be possible
though.

after some time of passive consuming this list, here is a brand hot question

Does the EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse) of an nuclear explosion need an
planetary magnetic field to develop ?

That is, if you think of a planet, who has no magnetic field like earth
(would be a rather strange planet I must admit), would the explosion
of a nuclear device result in an EMP?

Hi, gang. I am pleased to announce that Team Metlay\'s BANDWIDTH is now
out on CD and ready to ship immediately! 

This album is both a remarkable historical document and a fairly
eclectic group of electronic music compositions; for those of you who
are not aware of this project, Team Metlay was a group of musicians
from EMUSIC-L and the now-defunct rec.music.synth USEnet newsgroup who
gathered in Pittsburgh at my request for a two-week period in December
of 1990 and recorded an album of emusic in that time period. The
release of the album was delayed for over two years by personal,
financial, and technical glitches, but is now pressed on CD and ready
to ship. I\'m rather pleased with the results, and hope that people who
have waited for it all this time will feel it was worth the wait.

In 1990, Team Metlay consisted of Dan Barrett, Carl Brenner, Kurt
Geisel, myself, John Rossi III, Nick Rothwell, Adam Schabtach
(virtually), and Dean Swan.  Since then, we have added other people
and recorded other music, little or none of which is in releasable
form as of now. But at the moment we\'re just very happy to finally
have this, our first album, ready to ship, and to be able to discuss
it with anyone who has questions or comments. Ads for the CD will
start to appear in magazines over the next few months, but in the

The Zhodani do better than that - they have a sort of psionic Olympics with a
variety of events.  At least, they did in the days of Traveller (not Mega,
not New Era, just Traveller :-) and Alien Modules.  I have a funny feeling
that there would be very few Imperial participants in these games either.

Maybe not the present-day martial arts, but you can bet that there would be
some sort of zero-G combat.  In fact, there must be, because there\'s a skill
in it. :-)  So a zero-G martial arts arena would be a cell with no clearly
defined floor or ceiling, just walls with a variety of handles and other things
to grab hold of.  Either the objective is to knock out the opponent or force
a submission, or maybe there is a spot painted somewhere and you have to bounce
the opponent off it.  The absence of gravity would also add a whole new
dimension to fencing, literally.

There would have to be some zero-G version of football, whether it allowed
physical contact between players (zero-G American Football) or forbade it
(zero-G Soccer).

How about zero-G racing?  You need something like a small ring-type space
station, and the objective is to complete a set number of laps of the ring,
preferably before everyone else.  This means bouncing yourself off the outer
wall, possibly the inner wall, and maybe off other racers depending on the
rules.

     * A quick review of Traveller: TNE written *
     * for an audience familiar with Traveller  *
     * and MegaTraveller.			*

  [I won\'t comment about the parts wrgt which I might be deficient in
impartialness, although I must say that I was a little surprised to see the 
HubWorlds here:) I thought it was supposed to be published in Challenge/
Imperiallines.]

  [I also suspect that the fact that I know the T2k2 system will make
me miss things, simply because I unconciously fill them in]

  [And, if I make some hideous errors, please bear with me. I only bought it
yesterday:) ]

 The Basics:

  TTNE is a softcover book, 280x220x20mm, soft covers, 384 pages, $25, ISBN
1-55878-116-1, GDW number 0300 (hey, that\'s my area code:). "Printed in the
U.S.A, Terra/Solomani Rim (1827 G867975-8)."
  
  The page count is large compared to T2k2 (280), and DarkCon (336). The
price/page relationship is almost exactly the same as for Dark Conspiracy and
actually *lower* than for T2k2. Compared to Traveller and MegaT it gives 
somewhat of the same heavy feel of The Traveller Book and not the more \'flimsy\'
of MegaT.

  The cover painting by John Zeleznik is a little too \'cluttered\' for my taste
and IMHO, the title doesn\'t stand out as much as it should. Surprisingly, 
the spine is probably more eye-caching than that of the \'average RPG book\'
while the front, as I said, is slightly less eye-caching than average. The 
back cover is an old Challenge cover by Tony Szcsudlo depicting a low berth
which is has obvious connections to PC\'s in TNE:)


 Layout:
  The interior layout is better than DarkConspiracy. The maps are much better
quality (much much better than the typical Challenge maps for example) and
most illustrations have a connection to the text. The one thing that I don\'t 
like is that the page numbers are in the middle of the bottom of the page,
since that makes it harder to flip quickly through the book to find a certain
page.

 Misc:
  The first thing I noticed was that this book does *not* match with what 
Dave Nilsen spoke about on GenCon/Origins: According to him then it was
supposed to be a \'rules\' book in general terms and a \'TNE\' book about the 
setting. But this book contains elements of both and an extremely brief note 
on various models of TL advancement.

 Character Generation:

  I don\'t have much to say about this. It is the basic T2k2 model of
generation changed to fit TTNE. There is a larger amount of skills, and there
are a plethora of tables about things such as homeworld generation, 
homeworld requirements for background skills and career entry requirements
(I like the last. I did a homecooked version of it for DarkCon to keep
the confusionlevel of my players down).
  The effects of various worlds and TL\'s (as opposed to the Basic TL8 Terra
in T2k2 and DarkCon) are well detailed.
  Characters *can* start with a ship (for the entire group). Every term,
some careers give a ship DM, and the whole party can add together their
DM\'s and roll on a series of tables. If they are lucky, they can get a ship,
if they are unlucky, all they get is a number of passages. There are strong
negative DM\'s in force anywhere else than in the Regency (Spinward).
  It is also quite likely that their ship will be small, decrepit, mortaged or 
modified (or all of the above).


 NPCs:

  First a intro about NPC\'s. What they are, what they do and how to make
them. Then 15 human NPC\'s, 4 Hiver, 2 Vargr, 3 Aslan, 3 Zhodani, 1 Droyne.
My main beef here is that the description of the Vargr IMHO reinforces the
\'the vargrs pursuing you stop and start to bicker\' stereotype.

 
 The Virus:
  
  Essentially the same as the data on the Virus in \'Survival Margin\'.
  

 Star Vikings:

  History, Beliefs, Behaviour, Timeline, a Subsector. I haven\'t had the time 
to read this thoroughly yet.
  
  
 The Wilds:
   
  Guidelines on setting up a campaing in the Wilds. History. Xenophobia/
Technophobia. Psionics. Special Careers available in Wilds. Common features
of society. The Virus in the Wilds. A long description of first contact to
a typical world. A subsector. Like with the chapter on Star Viking, I haven\'t
read it through in detail yet.

 
 Tasks and Skills:

  A refined version of Lester Smiths d20 Mk2 system is described. Things like
combining skills, enabling skills, averaged skills, opposition and undertain
tasks has been added. Long section describing all skills.

  
 Refereeing Traveller:
  
  The obligatory chapter on how to do it. Since I isn\'t a newbie I don\'t think
I\'m qualified to comment on it:)


 Adventure: The Once & Future Emperor
 Adventure: Idol Dreams

  I\'ll be brief about the Adventures because of the dangers of spoilers. 
The first takes place in the \'Star Viking\' or RCES area in Old Expanses and
the second is an alternate campaign beginning that takes place in Diaspora.


 The Spinward States:
  
  This chapter describes the state in the Regency, formerly the Domain of
Deneb, which has escaped the Virus, for those who\'d prefer everything to
be as it was. I haven\'t found any explicit mention of it, but it seems that
ol\' Norris still rules things, even though he should be in his 140\'s (and his
daughter in her 60\'s at least). History, Democracy, Economy, Zho-Regency 
relations, Psionics, Robotics, Psion career, Regina subsector (It\'s interesting
to compare this Regina SS with the one in the Traveller Book, and of the
MegaT era and see the changes)

 
 Pocket Empires:

  Example of pocket empire: The HubWorlds in Massilia.

 
 Worldbuilding:

  Straight from good ol\' \'Scouts\' (except that the \'strange DM\' to determine
moon orbits is gone) and that \'Collapse Effects\' has been added.


 Wilderness Travel and Encounters:

  This chapter begins as in t2k2 and transforms into Traveller when it comes
to specific event encounters (wirebrushes, hallucinogenic pollen and \'jungle
drums\'. Remember them from Traveller?:)
  It ends with some short notes about exploration and surveys.

 
 Animals: 
  
  Again the good ol\' Traveller animal encounter table system, but changed to
new combat mechanic. I have fond memories of this system. I remember when I
(to the horror of the staff of Bergslagsskolan highschool in Karslkoga) wrote
a program that generated them automatically and printed out encounter tables
for *all* terrains on *all* worlds in the Regina Subsector:)
  
 
 Space Travel:

  Starship operating procedures and economics. Players might be be relived to 
know that if your referee goes by the charts, it is impossible to encounter
a vampire in the Regency:)


 Trade and Commerce:

  I\'m divided over this chapter. On one hand, I very much like the inclusion
of the local credits from \'Striker\'. But on the other hand, the trade system
is the thoroughly unexiting one from Merchant Prince.
  Quick! Somebody expand on the Traveller Book trade system and tailor it for
TNE! 10 tons of TL10 Computers or TL9 Agricultural Machines are much more
exciting than 10 tons of "A-C Ri Cr7000".

  
 Maintainance and Repairs:

  The t2k2 maintainance value and wear value systems are used, which IHMO
impresses the need for the PC engineers to actually do some maintainance
once in a while (for example, don\'t buy a subsidized line with wear value 10
unless the party happens to include around 40 engineers:)


 Psioncis:

  I haven\'t read this yet. A quick skim reveals a \'power level/stage of success
table\' and the new paths of telephysics and arcana that encompasses some
skills presently found in the \'other\' group.
  

 Robots:

  This is a brief chapter on robots (mostly DarkCon style) with a very brief
note about Robots in TNE. I miss some things wrgt Robots and Virus that 
Dave Nilsen spoke about during the writers conference in Bloomington last 
year.


 Planetary Combat:

  This is a long chapter, mostly identical to T2k2 but with a few minor
additions. The autofire system used is fortunately basic T2k2 and not
the one in the T2k2 Ref\'s Screen. The additions handle things that change
between TL8 combat and TL0 to 15 combat. 
  There is also a section on the various effects of the planetary environment
on combat. 


 Space Combat:

  I\'ve only tested this once, but IMHO it is the bright gem of TTNE. 
I personally think it is the best small scale space combat system done 
for Traveller that I\'ve seen (and that includes the Traveller Book system,
Mayday, the MegaT system, High Guard (and Rebel Guard:)).

  I don\'t feel up to describing it in detail, but in short it uses the
old range band system (but it should be usable with hexes. In fact I\'ve found
one or two mentions of \'hexes\' vice \'rangebands\' in the text that suggests
that it was originally written for hexes and later cut down to range bands).
Hits are resolved on a general hit location table with 20 areas (segments
of a globe imagined to surround the target) which is special to each class
of ship. Antennas, Locks and Hatches are damaged first, then the hull has
to be penetrated, and finally interior components are damaged. Some components
have different damage capacity in some ships and there are common tables to
determine that an interior \'Quarters\' hit in fact was a hit on the Life Support
or Passenger Staterooms.


 Miniatures:

  A two page short course in \'how to paint\'.

 
 Equipment and Technology:

  The equipment chapter starts with a very short three-page treatment of
various models of TL advancement and a referral to the \'Travller Technical
Architecture\' sourcebook.
  It then jumps straight into the equipment lists. The first thing I noticed
was that medical slow, combat slow and fast drugs are gone (even though 
fast are mentioned in \'Survival Margin\'). Power storage batteries are given
a thorough (and realistic I suspect) treatment. 
  The equipment illustrations are much better than in T2k2 and DarkCon but 
the picture that is entitled \'sniffer bioscaner\' shows a NAS backpack and
handset.

  Starship Weapons:

  Starship weapons have changed again (but to the better IMHO). Laser turrets
now contain one laser of varying TL and MegaJoulage. They are fed with a
low number of continous MegaWatts and are obviously pulse lasers driven with
energy storage in the form of a homopolar generator. Maximum ranges vary from 
8 to 80 bands (one band is 1/10 lightseconds, aka 30000km) and they are *not*
Xray lasers as they were in MegaT.
  Missiles now consist of a small nuke (on the 50 to 500 ton TNT range) that
pumps a number of Xray laser rods. They weight 7 metric tons each (ouch!) and
are hideously expensive (like 750kCr to 1.25MCr) so I hope somebody designs
conventional ones carrying a 1000kg shaped charge for example.

  I haven\'t had the time to combine the figures of the energy in each pulse,
the number of pulses per space combat turn (30 min) and the continous effect
needed to drive the turret against 3G3 but I\'ll try to do it sometime soon:)
  
  Personal Weapons:

  Lasers have changed here too. The Powerpack now contains a battery, coolant
system and a homopolar generator on TL8-9 weapons. TL13 lasers use chemical
laser cartridges to store the energy, and hand held fusion and plasma weapons
use similar (much larger) cartridges.
  The PG and FG series could perhaps be reintroduced as TL15+ weapons?

  There are some bugs in the small arms stat table. One that inspired the title
of this article is that the Gauss Pistol has a damage of 1 and Pen of 1-Nil
(impossible in this system) and the Gaussrifle a damage of 2 and a pen of 
1-Nil. IMHO the damage for the Gaussrifle should be upped to 3 or 4 to be on
the same order as that of TL7 assault rifles and the gausspistol upped to 2
(to make the damage and pen figures match for it).
  Another suspected bug is that all hand held lasers except LR-13 have a 
penetration of Nil while the starship weapons have penetrations less than 1 
(aka *very* good at penetrating...)

  My brief reading of the weapon stats table suggests that a Assault Rocket
Launcher firing HEAP has the best combination of high ROF, low recoil, high
damage and good penetration, which is why I suspect it has replaced the Gauss
Rifle as the most effective weapon (unless the lasers should have a pen of 1
or so).

  Vehicles:

  The standard complement of vehicles are available.

  Starships:

  Scout/Courier
  Far Trader
  Free Trader
  Yatch
  Gazelle-class Close Escort
  Lab ship
  Patrol Cruiser
  SDB
  Subsidized Merchant
  Donosev-class Survey Ship
  Subsidized Liner
  Broadsword-class Mercenary Cruiser

    All have their own damage data and hit locations data. Armour varies from
  10 (traders) to 101 (SDB). This should make it possible to any yahoo with
  a muzzle loaded cannon to threaten the adventurers in their trader:)

    The ships generally behave more like in Traveller than in MegaTraveller.
  For example, they appearently use fuel guzzling fusion rockets for drive and
  a antigrav (now called Contra-Grav, but called antigrav in the skill section)
  system for start adn landings (Three loud cheers for the fusion rockets!).
  Powerplant fuel is listed as \'1 year duration\' in all cases while the
  engine fuel (reaction mass probably) is listed as a number of G-hours
  varying between 11 and 52. 
    (You know what this means? This means that the normal scout (40 Ghours)
  only can accelerate for 20 hours and deaccelerate for 20 hours before it
  runs out of fuel. Insystem transfers will take a *lot* of time 
  hencetoforth. And there will be no scouts at 0.5c threatening the worlds:)

    It was nice to see that the illustrations used for shipsboat, modular
  cutter and shuttle are the same as they were in the Traveller Book:)


 Closing Comments: 

  Generally positive. The way things work seems to be moving towards 
good ol\' Traveller.

If you go back through the material you can find a few games. Boloball is
one that comes to mind. You can abstract from the present somewhat: taking
the usual analogy of a traveller planet being equivalent to a contemporary
country ....
- - one game will be played throughout the imperium except for one planet. For
the important imperium wide contest, the planet that doesn\'t play it will be
picked to host it
- - the planet in question will play a number of completely different games
which it is convinced are of importance to the entire imperium. It will hold
lavish contests with titles like The Imperial Series and Superbolo. No off
planet teams will compete.
- - the population of the planet has absolutely no interest in the genuine
imperial wide game, except when a game is broken up by drug crazed Vargr.
Their interest diminishes even further when they realise that they have
absolutely no chance of winning the big contest.
- - the imperial contest (let\'s call it the Imperial Cup) will be won by a
representative team from Terra, made up of a single token Brazilian and 10
players from Leeds United, holders of the Imperial Premier League
Championship for the past unbroken 5000 years. I wish.

Outside the Imperium:
- - in the Vargr extents, the top game is Akhakh (in Anglic: "Fetch").
Basically, one player throws a stick. The other player fetches it. Player
with the highest charisma throws the first stick.
- - In the Aslan hierate, an ancient form of wrestling prevails. The youthful
ihatei are required to take on an avatar representing the primal foe of the
aslan. The avatar takes the form of a ball of wool. The contest continues
until the aslan loses interest.
- - The K\'kree play a form of football. The main differences from conventional
football are that the pitch is 800 km square and there are over 1000 to each
team. The teams never break up, and in fact only come into contact either by
accident or to smash up the hot dog stand. No score draws are common.
- - The Hivers don\'t play games, they fix them.

TNE:
Well no sign in Virgin in Guildford, but I finally caught up with Survival
Margin. An excellent sourcebook with minimal gaming application. But I\'d
recommend it anyway. Will we ever find out what happened to the other
adversaries - Craig, Margaret, etc - before the collapse? And was that thing
that ran over Dulinor the famous Verge Combine?

On games in the Imperium:

There\'s a game I invented for my Traveller campaign called Slingshot,
which is the subject of a short story or two that I wrote a LONG time
ago and should probably resurrect again. It\'s primarily popular in the
Spinward States, as the Imperial Core considers it too barbaric. It\'s
a combination of Ultimate Frisbee, Rollerball, and Jai-Alai, played
by armored teams in a playing area that changes not only gravitational
amount but also direction. The floor becomes the wall becomes the 
ceiling becomes the floor, randomly, with audio/visual warning signals
that are on shorter and shorter notice as the players get better. The
object one throws is a metallic discus, that can be handled by hand
(in some variants) or with a gizmo like a jai-alai or lacrosse stick
(in others). 

The game is played by teams of two, three, or four, and has various
rules levels and degrees of violence and danger to the participants.
This can range from contact-free (which makes the game a lot like
Ultimate) to full-contact (which is a cross between Rollerball and
lacrosse). Professional-grade Slingshot, or ProShot, is a hot sport
on video, but is not played on all worlds because of the violence
built into it.  Because the equipment used and the environment of the
playing field erases a lot of the physical differences between
species, it is one of the few games where Aslan and Droyne can compete
on equal terms, to say nothing of other races as well. Teams are
rarely racially integrated, and my story was about the first
all-species team to make the ProShot Circuit: one Human, one Vargr,
one Aslan, and one Droyne.

It was a neat story, if a bit juve; I should probably dig it up again.

On the gauss rifle bowing to the ARL in TTNE:

It\'s about damned time. The ARL is the most underrated weapon in 
Traveller, and the handheld gauss rifle the most overrated.
Thanks for the review, Bertil; things are looking hopeful. I\'m
going to post a review of my own, assuming my local store ever
bothers to order me a copy. |-P

Got a question for Loren, if he\'s got his ears on...

In Bertil Jonnell\'s extensive listing of TNE\'s contents, I noticed the
conspicuous absence of a craft design system.  Admittedly, I don\'t
have TNE yet, but I feel sure that Bertil would have mentioned it if
it were included.

I very much enjoy playing around with craft design and have used it as
a kind of solo playing method when not running a campaign.

Question:
Is there or will there be a craft design system for TNE which will be
released at some point?  If not how about a system for converting
MegaTrav or High Guard craft to TNE standard?

I\'m not the only one who enjoys craft design, I\'d bet it would sell
rather well.

Thanks,

Scott 2G Kellogg

  Correct, there isn\'t any.

  I\'m trying to perform reverse engineering on the examples given but so far,
I haven\'t reached any conclusions yet (apart from the fact that the volume of
1 displacement ton has changed from 13.5m3 to 14m3, but this is stated
somewhere in the text too).

  Some comments on the vehicles that I missed in the review:

  The armour levels seems generally low, the highest armour level of the grav
tank is 60, and that is significantly lower than late generation contemporary
terran tanks. Also the penetration of some tac missiles is very low: The
TL13 130kg laser designated tac missile has a pen of 60C which is even lower
than the venerable TL7 Dragon.

  Space combat is entirely task driven: It is the characters skills that 
determine the difficulties of various things (while ranges, penetrations etc
are still hardware determined). This is IMHO good for an RPG, and while I
don\'t think the system will work as well for ships over 10,000 or 20,000 tons,
I wouldn\'t cry if I never saw a ship other than big ugly cargo barges larger
than that.

Scott, old buddy, you should have taken Loren up on his offer to send
you a TNE flyer a few weeks ago.  The design book "Technical Architecture"
(or some such title) is the next item expected, and should be the other
half of the boxed TNE set, which is due in July (according to GDW on
GEnie.)

I\'m waiting for that box, personally.

  Ouch! I have seen neither the offer nor the flyer. It must have happened 
while I wasn\'t reading all my mail due to Real Life committments.

  Well, I\'ll go down to the store and have a look. If it is promo material
I\'d expect them to have at least one.

I just read through parts of the Lords of Thunder, haven\'t had
time to read it all, but I did have a couple observations.

************************Spoiler alert!*****************************

Did the Keith brothers get stuck somehow?  They pulled the same
rabbit outta the hat that they did in the FASA Sky Raiders trilogy.
I mean there it is!  ANOTHER burned out multi-generation TL9 asteroid
ship, destroyed by the internal factionalism of it\'s warlike
inhabitants.

If you want a craft design for it, I suggest you all take a look at
the Rift-Crossing ship and attendant fleet I posted a couple months
back.  (Except that has a jump drive...)  But I can tell you from
several hours work with a spread sheet.  The ship would *never* be
able to power artificial grav plates for 5000 years.  Nope.  Not
with MegaTraveller rules.  Also grav plates are TL 10.  Not TL 9!
Why couldn\'t they just say the damn thing was spun for gravity!

Also, the notion of an K\'kree community of exiles sounds pretty
strange to me.  I always figured that the K\'kree notion of exile would
fall under cruel and unusual punishment:  execution being FAR more
preferable.  Kinda like an Aslan being disgraced completely in front
of his family:  he\'d prefer death.

Gripe!  Gripe!  Gripe!  Complain!  Complain!  Complain!

Still it IS the first time the K\'kree ever got used in a decent way.
I always wondered if someone could ever write something for their use.
As bad guys, they have a good appeal to me, even if I never figured out
how to use them well enough to try.

I know I\'ve asked this before, but has anyone out there ever managed to
get a campaign going that involved the vegitarians from hell?

It was in the Ares Section of Dragon magazine. If anyone wants more
info I have the issue at home somewhere, I could look it up. It was a
Basic Traveller Character generation system. Not advanced like High
Guard or Merc. Let me know if anyone wants more information.

reading through the combat system and had a question on a confusing area:
combat damage.

pg 285, 1st column, bottom
"Multiply the target\'s armor protection by the weapon\'s penetration value
and subtract the result from the weapon\'s damage value."

Using an example of a 12mm hunting rifle at short range (Pen = 2, Dam = 4)
and a visored helmet TL 10 (Armor value = 2), the resulting damage would
work out:

   AV x Pen       Damage Val - (AV x Pen)
    2 x 2   = 4       4      -     4      = 0    which means this doesn\'t
                                                 penetrate.

while the same armor versus a 9mm Rifle (TL7) (Pen = 1, Dam = 5) would give
a result of:

  AV x Pen        Damage Val - (AV x Pen)
   2 x 1    = 2       5      -     2      = 3    which means this does
                                                 penetrate.

So: A 9mm TL7 rifle will more easily penetrate a helm than a 12mm TL10
Rifle?

    This doesn\'t make sense. Help!!!?

     Thanks. That was certainly what we were trying for.
     You seem to have acquired a copy before many people in the USA.
Our Swedish distributor is very efficient.
     The low laser penetration is not a typo. We made them to
reflect reality as we currently understand it (as it was
explained to us by a few experts). This is a design decision that
will undoubtedly be debated here within a few hours of everyone
getting their copies of the game.
     I think Gauss Rifles are pretty deadly, and I must admit a soft
spot for the ARL, but my weapon of choice is the good old plasma
rifle (PGMP renamed). That sucker\'ll go through battledress like
a knife through butter (range is a _little_ short, however).

 > Craft Design System?
 Rob beat me to the answer, but the Craft Design book will be in
 the starship combat game, tentatively titled
  (drumroll please)
 _Brilliant Lances_
 Which leads me to a few words from our sponsor:
     If things work out with the manufacturer (RAFM in Canada) we
 _may_ be able to include a sample ship miniature in the game, but
the game will be designed for use with counters. Thirty counters
(two-sided, so you get 60 ships, you just can\'t use all 60 at
once unless you part with a couple of bucks for a second counter
sheet), with little line drawings of the ships on them.
     Three 22"x31" maps with a 2" hex grid (black with a starfield
background, white hexgrid). I don\'t know what size the Geo-Hex
stellar battle cloth is, but it should be reasonably compatible.
We are doing them 2" hexes so that two miniature ships and their
stands can fit on one hex.
     Two booklets, one starship design, one combat rules. All in a
box with a neat cover painting by aviation artist Doug Chaffee,
for $30.00 American.
     Available July. We hope to have it in time to release it at
Origins, July 4th weekend.
 
- ----
     RAFM Starships will include a Gazelle, a Patrol Cruiser, a
Scout/Courier, Free Trader, Far Trader, Subs. Merchant (I think)
and several others (working from memory here). They look very
nice, nice enough to tempt me to paint a few. Drop by Origins or
Gen-Con, and we\'ll be running demos with the samples.

 BTW, for those who care, Survival Margin has sold out its first
printing already, and we are working on the second. We have a
complaint from a store owner in San Diego, who says the only
thing wrong with the book is that she can\'t keep any on her
shelves : )
 Advance orders for TNE are sizable, but its the re-stock orders
that tell the tale (re-stocks are a measure of how fast it moves
off the store shelves).

FUTURE PRODUCTS
 The next product out will be Technical Architecture, which will
 enable Scott double-G to design his sentient elevator, as well as
 a sentient fusion toaster, if he wants to. 120pp book, $14,
 available in early August.
 Deluxe Traveller will include theTechnical Architecture book,
 the main book, and some other goodies (as yet unspecified) in a
 box. $35, Early August, same as Technical Architecture.
 
 The first Adventure book will release in September, the Ref\'s
 Screen and a Player\'s Packet in October.
I think that\'s enough for now.

This is version 2 of my nuclear power plant table.
As suggested, I\'ve increased the efficiency of the high tech fusion
and antimatter plants and I\'ve also included a different fuel types
for fission power plants.

I\'ve been told that 5% enrichment is only good for civilian reactors,
military reactors use fuel enriched to up to 60%.
Enrichment would affect three areas. First, a fission reaction can
start more easily in higher enriched fuel (the "critical mass" is lower) so
the reactor can be made smaller. Second, for the same power output,
the fuel would last longer as there\'s more fuel to use in the same volume. 
With the third, I\'m not sure if higher enrichment would also lead to a
higher power output per volume of powerplant, so I haven\'t used it.

There are now different types of radioactives as fuel, with enrichment
rates of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60%. I\'ve given them a consumtion rate as in
the low tech supplement in Challenge 61. The 5% enriched radioactives
are the ones we know from MTrav, so their consumtion rate is set to 1.
The consumtion rates of the other types are simply one-half, one-forth,
one-eigth and one-twelweth of the standard type.

The reactor on the table is for 5% enriched fuel, to figure out
the minimum size of fission reactors using other types of radioactives,
multiply the minimum size of the standard reactor by the consumption
rate of the used radioactives type.

I haven\'t figured out the excat formuals so I\'ve used straight
linear assumptions. These are almost certainly wrong, but I hope that
the basic assumptions are correct.
Maybe someone can give me the correct formulas so I can come up
with a final more or less correct version of the table.

So here\'s the revised table.

Wt is in tons per Kl of plant. Price is in MCr per Kl of plant.
Minimum Volume is in Kl. Pow is power output per Kl of plant.
Fuel is fuel usage in liter per year per Kl of plant.
Efficiency is the efficiency of the plants of the given level. The right
number is the efficiency for the largest plant (14+ Kl) and the left
number is the efficiency for the smallest possible plant for the given TL.

And here\'s the fuel table

interest to the ship-builders. It seems as though the requirements for
Jump fuel have gone down considerably in relation to the amount needed
for thrust.

For example:
Scout/Courier
2G Manuever (not sure if this makes a difference yet)
G-Hours: 40 (56.8 using jump fuel)
Note: "Fuel purification machinery, 20.69 hours to refine 710m(3)."

Far Trader
1G Manuever
G-Hours: 24 (40.8 using jump fuel)
Note: "Fuel purification machinery, 24 hours to refine 1020m(3)."

I assume this is the full fuel complement for each ship - it doesn\'t state
it elsewhere. With this, the 2G uses 12.5m(3) per hour G, and the 1G uses
25m(3) per hour burn. This also leaves 600m(3) for the far trader (200tons)
to jump2, and 500m(3) for the Scout (100tons) to do the same jump.

Esoterica I guess, but I thought it was an interesting glimpse. Sorry about
the cross post, but I thought both places would find it interesting.

quite acceptable, though the typos need some work.

	I note that the plasma weapons all have penetration listed in the
anti-vehicle format, but I can find nowhere in the rules where it states
that this is so.

	I also notice a failure of imagination in the grav tank, which has
considerably weaker armour than an M1A1 does, and a primary weapon that
is not as effective as a rifled 105mm tank gun.

	And grav has been changed to something that looks a lot like what
they use in Star Wars or H. Beam Piper\'s stories:  something that
cancels local gravity, and does nothing else.  No more grav propelled
vehicles, guys.  Now grav vehicles have normal reaction jets to move
them sideways, and the grav just replaces the wheels/tracks/whatever.

	BIG BEEF:

	The Arses.  These guys are the kind of pond-scum my characters have
spent a lot of the years since the orginal Traveller came out pounding
sense into.  I am vastly amused by the assumption that "For obvious
reasons, most Star Viking characters will be player characters", since
the Star Vikings, IMHO, are a lunatic fringe group of murdering,
idealistic, morons.  Of course, that describes many player-characters,
so maybe it does make sense...:-)
	Fortunately, my other big beef will deal with them quite handily. 
The "Hub Worlds" (a sample pocket empire) can match the technology of
the Arses, and outnumber them by a factor of about 40.  So when the two
groups meet, the Arses are going to be either absorbed or annihilated by
the Hub Worlds, unless the Arses decide to rescue the Hub Worlds from
the intolernat, fanatical government of theirs by nuking them out of
existance.  Which, unfortunately, fits well with Arse policy and social
theory.

	For those of you with GDW, just how do you expect that the Hub
Worlds (which are bigger and richer than my entire TCS campaign) will
FAIL to reunite the Empire in the next five years.  My off-the-cuff
guesstimate has them finishing the first 300 (of 2000 they can support)
battleships within four years, and conquering the area of the old
Imperium in hardly more time than it takes to drive across at J-3. 
Remember, these guys are in better shape than the Terrans were at the
end of the Interstellar Wars, and the opposition to such a conquest is
essentially non-existant...

	And thank you for including the entire core area of my TCS game in
your "Frontier".  Survival Margin had me thinking that part of the GRA
had been left out of the Frontier, but the map in TNE pretty clearly
shows that all the worlds of the Islands and the GRA are still (halfway)
civilized...

	I note with some pleasure that gas giant refueling is now
effectively dead.
	A free trader requires 280 Kl of fuel to jump.  280 Kl gives it 11
G-hours.  So, gas giant refueling, if done under the TNE rules, would
only be profitable if the transit from the GG to the main world could be
done with less than 11 G-hours.
	Well, it can.  If you use 9G-hours (which will save you all of 350
credits when it comes time to refill the tanks, then the trip from
Jupiter to Terra will take only 56 days to complete.  So in exchange for
56 days of yor time, you save 350 credits.
	Hopefully, noone in TNE will be stupid enough to consider this a
wonderful way to save money, and gas giant refueling will become a
rather quaint bit of gaming history.

	I also note that, in a fight between two unarmoured men, you are
better off using your bare hands (assuming the requisiste skill) than
you are using a sword.  This, unfortunately, has always been one of the
hallmarks of the T2K2 system from which TNE was derived.  I had hoped
that it was lost in one of the many revisions the system has gone
through, but it was not to be.

	One moderately serious technical error though:  under these rules,
there are different government ratings in the wilds and the safes.  So a
government rating of "7" means one thing on THIS side of the line, and
another thing on the other side of the line.  This was NOT a bright
move.  Instead, you should have extended the rating scales like was
originally done for the various alien government types...

lack of trade-offs in ship design in Classic Traveller.  And after only
twelve years or so, GDW has finally done it.  Congratulations, guys...

	Uhm, why not?  Wrestling as we know it often relies on
gravity, but that\'s simply because we\'ve never tried it in a
gravity-less environment.  I can think of a few holds, off the top of
my head, that don\'t rely so heavily on gravity and could be converted.
Martial arts can be equally adapted.  Hell, there\'s even a Zero-G
combat skill.  

	I recall an interesting short story from an old Far Frontiers
about the first zero-gravity martial arts competition.  Forms and
katas have to be very carefully designed and executed so the artist
maintains control of position and trajectory at all times, and
sparring takes on a new dimension (literally) but that just makes it
more interesting.  There\'s also nullboxing, as in the novel
Streetlethal by Steven Barnes.  Two boxers (more like kickboxers,
extremely violent sport) in a large plastic sphere.

	As for other sports, well of course the temptation to play
around with zero-g is great, but don\'t forget other advances, in
medicine, simulations technology, protective gear, etc.  You might see
a lot more violent sports, since the participants can most likely be
restored to healthand hence aren\'t risking their lives as much.  You
might see things like jousting, duelling, etc, perhaps more medieval,
in keeping with the whole rather medeival feel of Imperial society,
where the weapons are simulated, or where they aren\'t, but the
participants are wearing the civilian equivalent of battledress, or
they aren\'t, but full-scale TL16 medical teams are standing by.

	There are also more mechanistic sports; the tl16 equivalents
of car, bike, and boat races.  My previous player in the PBEM spent
several years on the grav racing circuit as a grav mechanic, some on
grav bike races, some on solar-sail grav-skiffs.

    'body' => 'The following is a copy of E-mail I sent to Loren Wiseman, for him to
share with the rest of the folks at GDW

I picked up Traveller: The New Era yesterday, and have skimmed through
it (I haven\'t had a chance to read it thouroughly yet).  I got the
next-to-last copy at Dream Wizards (the local game store).  Aparrently,
sales of T:TNE are better than expected: I touched off an exchange
between the storekeepers: "I think you\'d better order more copies of
Traveller!" "Wheren\'t you the one who told me that ten copies was more
than enough?" etc...).  In any case, it seems to be selling well.

In comments to other TML members, you (Loren) mentioned that the
starship construction rules will be part of a board game, while the rest
of the vehicle construction rules will be part of the Technical
Architecture manual (?! or at least, that\'s how it sounded to me ?!).

I\'d like to very strongly suggest that the starship and spaceship
construction rules be in BOTH products.  At $30 or so for the board
game, very few roleplayers are going to be willing to spend *MORE* for
the starship design rules than they spent on the game; and most of the
role-players are probably *NOT* going to be interested in the boardgame.
Therefore, the potential market for the boardgame is the people who are
interested in both Traveller role-playing and boardgaming (most probably
an even smaller minority of Traveller players than ten years ago) plus
those role-players who have $30 to spend on a product that they
fundamentally don\'t want (an even smaller minority, IMHO).

And if High Guard is any indication, the role-players will be most
interested in the starship design rules out of all the things that are
likeley to be covered in the Technical Architecture suppliment.  If the
starship and spacecraft rules aren\'t in there, the demand for this
product will be greatly reduced.

Putting the starship rules in the boardgame and not in the technical
architecture suppliment will most likely reduce the demand for the
technical architecture suppliment *without* a corresponding increase in
the demand for the boardgame.  My guess is that most purchasers of T:TNE
could be easily persuaded to shell out an additional $10 to $15 in order
to get *all* of the starship, spaceship, vehicle, weapons, and other
construction rules, tables and charts.  Very few people are going to be
willing to shell out $45 to get all of this, and most aren\'t going to be
satisfied without the starship construction rules.

With that out of the way, on to my impressions of T:TNE!

Although it\'s awfuly big for a single volume, I definitely like T:TNE\'s
price to content ratio.  This one\'s a good value; particularly when
compared to MegaTraveller (or many of the other games that are on the
market today).

Compliments:
* The artwork is good; I like the mix of new art and old favorites.
* New starship rules look good
* Well organized; the text is in a logical order, and the index and
  table of contents are a nice touch.

Observations:
* Gas Giant refuelling is a very effective way to wast large amounts of
  time and money.  Other than that it\'s not good for much.  I think that
  Gas Giant refeulling would only be used when a ship is passing through
  a system (without stopping at the starport) and only then if there was
  no world with a liquid water ocean.

Gripes:
* Layout is "busy" - Headers and footers make the page look cluttered;
  and the page numbers are hard to read.  It rather resembles what
  happens when someone gets ahold of a Mac and Pagemaker for
  the the first time (Survival Margin had this problem, and Font Mania [too
  many fonts on one page] too).
* Incomplete index: for example, missles for starships are *not* indexed
  under missiles (which does point you to the rules for using starship
  missles, as well as the TAC missile tables, etc), but it you want to
  find the table of *Starship* missiles, well it\'s not referenced there.
  (It is under Starship Weapons, though).

Another minor gripe (and it applies to Survival Margin, too): The author of
the virus items is aparrently unaware of the meaning of "Operating System",
and seems hazy on the concepts of computer "hardware" versus "software",
and the distinctions between systems programs, application programs, and
data.  While this admittedly a nit, it is as annoying as is the news
media\'s inability to distinguish between a Main Battle Tank and an Infantry
Fighting Vehicle, or those who use the terms "bullet", "round", and
"shell" interchangeably.  While it certainly isn\'t a major flaw, it
certainly does give me pause when reading certain sections.

Notes: I noticed that all of the missiles listed are detonation
lasers.  Detonation lasers are certainly reasonable technology; however
"normal" missiles are certainly possible and effective with Traveller
technology.

An impact with a couple of hundred kilograms of conventional explosive
in a shaped sharge should do heavy damage to T:TNE starships;
particularly given their new (and much lower) armor values.

An impact with a nuke (even one of the "micro-nukes" that normally power
the detonation lasers) should vaporize nearly any ship.  And larger
nukes (in the kiloton range) wouldn\'t be any larger than the nuke/laser
assembly on a detonation laser, and would be deadly to some distance
even if a direct hit wasn\'t made.  Perhaps a variety of "Normal" missile
warheads and guidance systems could be made available in the Technical
Architecture manual.  These impact missiles could be deadly at short
ranges, and would be just the thing for arming a fast, highly
maneuverable fighter craft, which can carry them into close proximity to
the target before releasing them.

Conventional High-Explosive missiles are likeley to be a favorite of
merchants, too.  Much cheaper than detonation lasers, and effective
in close-in fighting against pirates.

But enough of that.  My overall impression is a good product, and I am
eagerly going through it.  I will probably follow-up with additional
comments as I notice individual items.  The rules seem good, solid, and
very playable ---- I\'d say (and this is high praise) that it is as good a
foundation for science-fiction roleplaying as was the original
Traveller.

Good Work!

    'body' => 'TNE ship design notes:

        Well, I\'ve spent some time looking at the technology of starships
in TNE.  MAJOR differences from previous versions of Traveller.  Enough
so that the basic ships should have been mostly scrapped, in fact.
        There isn\'t really enough info to do a complete, conclusive analysis,
but a few points are already clear:

        1)  Maneuver fuel seems to be set at 12.5 KL/G-hour/100T displacement
of ship.  Whether intentional or not, given that figure, and the MASS of the
ships, the maneuver drive is medium-high range fusion rockets.  Basically
excellent...
        2)  Design requirements and (possible) mistakes:  All of the canned
ships have quite a lot of maneuver fuel.  All well and good for PCs to rip
around in, but aren\'t the merchant ships designed to make money???
        A Free Trader, for the first time, carries more fuel than cargo.
        A Free Trader, for the first time, is capable of doing THREE jumps
on one tank of gas.  It\'ll only leave you 6 G-hours to maneuver in, but
that is MORE than enough on a normal commercial run.
        So the Free Trader should have redesigned into something with only
about 4-10 G-hours, if the goal was OPERATIONAL compatibility with previous
versions of Traveller, or it should have been made clear that the ship can
make SEVERAL jumps, which would go a LONG way toward making it actually
useful to PC merchant types.
        I would suggest that a "normal" merchantman (in a reasonably safe
place, like the Spinward Marches) should have no more than 6 G-hours worth
of maneuver fuel.  That puts (in the case of the free trader) another
570 KL (an extra 75%) in the cargo hold...
        3)  SDBs:  This has become a misnomer.  It should be PLANETARY
DEFENSE BOAT.  The new maneuver limits make it impractical to defend a
whole system with any ship that cannot Jump.  The canned SDBs are entirely
suitable for defending a main world, but transferring back and forth from
the main world to the gas giants and other planets will put a major drain
on the fuel supply, or require LARGE amounts of time.  Either way, it is
easier to use a J-1 boat to do the job that an SDB used to do (after all,
the J-1 requires MUCH less fuel than the normal space crossing, and takes
less time if you are going as far as Jupiter...)
        4)  I note with dismay that the Mercenary Cruiser is now J-1, 1G.
MAJOR CHANGE!  Far more than I expected after seeing the rest of the ships.
Not that this is bad, mind you.  The mercenary cruiser was always a bit
overpowered for the design mission.
        5)  Best of all:  the new system puts a premium on crew skill.  The
PLAYER-CHARACTERS ARE BACK IN THE LOOP.  Fr the first time since HG came out,
having a pilot-6 (or gunner-6, or whatever (well, actually, having the TNE
equivalent, which would be around Astrogator-12, or whatever)) is IMPORTANT
to the survival of OUR HEROES.  I LIKE it!

  It is *possible* in a system that looks like Regina: Where the mainworld
is in orbit around a gas giant, although it isn\'t really profitable (it never
was really profitable).

  The main effect of this will IMHO be to slow down the reexploration of 
charted space. If you enter a system for the first time you will hesitate
before jumping in at the mainworld, and if you jump in at a normal gas giant,
you will have to spend 50 days or so going to the mainworld, or send a smaller
faster shuttle. In the latter case the transfer time will be on average 9
days Terra-Jupiter with a 20 G hour burn from a ships boat.
  I think this is good. Without it reexploration would go much too fast. 

(I did a brief calculation on this wrgt the HubWorlds and found out that with
 only a small number of ships, a pretty thorough survey could be carried out on
 all worlds in the Massilia sector in less than a year, even when including 
 duplication of effort)

  It\'s worse than that, actually. Those 9 G hours is only the acceleration.
Since an equal deacceleration is necessary 5 G hours is the max acceleration
possible if you only have 11 G hours to play with.

  I agree with this.
 
  BTW: Keeping in mind our long and heated discussions on \'how to armour a
grav tank for planetary combat\', I hope you sat down when you saw the 
armour figures for the grav tank:) 
  Even I admit that this is too thin on the non-glacis faces.

  There has been some brief comments on TTNE on usenet news that basically
agree about the similarities. I have a hard time putting my finger on them,
but they are there.

  I asked Fabian about it and according to him, they ("Spel & Sa\'nt") buy
directly from you via airmail.

  One thing that I have noticed now in the combat chapter that give strange
effects is the environment rules on gravity (p308). As I interpret them, 
a slug thrower would get a close range of infinite in zero gee. I\'m leaning
towards using the Jump/Throw table on page 190 instead of local gravity 
when it comes to determining ranges and safe speeds (but not carrying
loads).

  Using the T2k2 demolitions rules on the yield sizes gives that the raw
explosive strength of equals a penetration and concussion from about 2000 
to 6000. Halving this for untamped explosions gives that it should give
between 40 and 125 major hits worth of damage. A seat of the pants guess is 
that this will destroy all components within one location of the hit
as per the excess damage rule and also inflict at least one critical hit on
all sizes of ships.

  But based from the system (and the TDR discussions on space combat, agility,
ranges, weapons and hit chanses) IMHO it would be very hard to achieve a direct
hit with a missile. At least 2 levels of difficulty harder. And the defence 
would have a much easier time hitting it.
  This is also a problem for missiles carrying large shape charges.

  Is there a nuclear scientist in the house? I only play one on the net:)

  Damage from nuclear explosions in space are mostly in the form of soft xrays
that cause structural damage and other radiation that cause biologic damage
and disturb electronics. None of these effects are even close to strong enough
to affect more than one range band.

  The soft xrays, which in \'normal\' explosions cause the fireball by being
absorbed by the air and heating it to a plasma, are absorbed by any solid
structures in space and heat it, creating a shock wave inside them that cause
physical damage. In TTNE terms I\'d inflict a Concussion to all inside the
ship, the damage of which is determined by how close they were. (I have
read somehwere that the concussion induced by soft xrays are aproximately of
the same strange at a certain range from a certain yield as the shockwave
in air from an airburst of the same yield at the same range, but I\'m not
certain of this). I\'d also inflict small scale damage (1h to 1H, say) all
over the ship but concentrated to the side facing the explosion.

  My favourite types of (potential) conventional missiles are the cannister
round and the SFF round: 
  The cannister round replaces the nuke/laser warhead with a lot of heavy metal
spheres and a bursting charge. At the range where a nuke/laser missile would
detonate, it spreads the spheres in a cloud which hit the target at high speed.
  The SFF round uses an explosive warhead that generate the \'cloud of buckshot\'
from self forging fragments (a relative of the shape charge, used in the 
experimental SADARM round).

Assuming that low Pen means better penetration, and high Dam means more damage
(which assumptions are based on the idea that better penetration and more
damage mean better chances of harming the target) then it is the data which
gives the 9mm rifle better penetration and more damage than the 12mm rifle
which is at fault.  I would personally expect the 12mm rifle to have worse
penetration (higher Pen) and do more damage (higher Dam) than the 9mm rifle.

My reasoning was based on physics.  Assuming that the nuke was detonated
"close" to the ship (within about a shiplength or so), the hull of the
ship will intercept between a a quarter and a third of the energy output
of the explosion; probably enough to wreck the ship.  As a game
mechanic, probably about half of those hits go to the point of impact,
and the other half divided evenly between the hit locations adjacent to
the point of impact.

Agreed.  I was thinking about, but didn\'t want to post before I have
finished reading T:TNE, the following game mechanic: achieving a direct
impact hit would be 2 levels of difficulty harder, and achieving a
proximity hit would be 1 level of difficulty harder than the equivalent
detonation laser targetting task.

To even attempt an intercept, the missile should already be in the same
range band as the target, and should have more maneuver fuel available
than the thrust rating of the target\'s drive.  In other words, the
missile has to start it\'s final attack from nearby, and must be at least
as maneuverable as the target.

This assumes that the missile is using the T:TNE command guidance
system; alternative guidance systems could make it considerably easier.
The command guidance system has serious problems in co-ordinating an
intercept across distances of several light seconds.  Some example
guidance systems:

Active: Uses an active radar, ladar, or EMS sensor onboard the missile
to detect the target, and guide the missile to intercept.  Large, heavy
and expensive.  Easy to detect missile, may give away location of the
firing ship.  Makes intercept task 1 level of difficulty easier.

Semi-Active: Uses an active radar, ladar, or EMS sensor onboard the
launching vessel, and a reciever onboard the missile, to guide the
missile to intercept.  Relatively simple and cheap.  Easy to detect the
firing ship, and gives away location of the firing ship.  Makes
intercept task 1 level of difficulty easier.  If firing ship stops
operating active sensor (shuts it down, or antenna or sensor destroyed
by battle damage), the missile automatically misses.  Generally
longer-ranged than Active guidance.

Active and Semi-Active guidance can be defeated by jamming the sensor
used to guide the missile, and they can be rendered less effective by
"stealth" techniques which reduce the detection range of these sensors.

Passive: Uses a passive sensor (EMS, Neutrino, Densitometer, IR, etc) to
detect the target, and guide the missile to intercept.  Cost and Size
depend on the type of sensor.  Nearly impossible to detect, and does not
give away the location of the launching ship.  Relatively short
detection and homing range (particularly compared to Active and
Semi-Active missiles).  Makes intercept task 1 level of difficulty
easier.

Passive guidance can be defeated by jamming the sensor used to guide the
missile, or they can be rendered less effective by "stealth" techniques
which reduce the detection range of these sensors.  Passive guideance
can also be defeated by the use of decoys which mimic the passive sensor
profile of the target.

Anti-Radiation: Uses a passive sensor designed to detect specific
emissions (Radio, Radar, Active EMS, missile guidance radars or
communicators) of the target ship, and guides the missile to intercept.
This guidance system makes the intercept task two levels of difficulty
easier.  If the emission stops (is turned off, or the antenna or sensor
is destroyed by battle damage), the missile automatically misses.  If an
impact hit is made, the missile automatically hits the location
containing the antenna for the emission used to guide the missile.

Inertial: The guidance system flys the missile to a location determined
at launch time.  Intertial guidance systems cannot directly cause an
intercept.  Typically used for the first part of a missile\'s flight, and
then one of the other guidance systems takes over.  This guidance system
is self-comtained, and is nearly impossible to detect the missile or the
launching ship.

Command: The "Normal" T:TNE missile guidance system.  The launching ship
controls the flight of the missile via communications link (Laser,
Maser, or Radio Communicator), or through coded signals from an active
sensor (Radar or Active EMS; this type of guidance is also known as a
"Beam Rider").  The communications link may or may not give the
launching ship\'s location away.  Can also be used in combination with
other guidance systems.

Guidance system can be combined by specifying when each system is used.
For example, a combined guidance system might consist of Intertial,
Command, and Semi-Active guidance.  Inertial is used for the first part
of the missile\'s flight.  The Command system provides course corrections
to the Inertial guidance, and commands the switch-over to Semi-Active,
which guides the missile to intercept.  Another example might be a
missile with Active and Anti-Radiation guidance.  The missile is
launched on Active guidance.  If at any time the Active guidance is
successfully jammed, it switches over to Anti-Radiation (the emission it
homes in on is the jamming signal for the active guidance).  If the
Anti-Radiation guidance looses it\'s signal, the missile switches back to
active.  Nasty.

In all cases of multiple guidance systems, the system that handles the
final ("Terminal") guidance to intercept is used to determine the
intercept task difficulty.

Definitely.  I\'ve been assuming that an "Impact" (in nuclear terms,
anyway) is anything closer than a shiplength or so.  "Proximity" is
probably a couple of kilometers.  Anything outside of that is a miss.

Say, 1h everywhere, and 1H on the sides facing the explosion?  In
general, your ideas sound about right to me, too.

I\'m not sure, but I\'ve always assumed that the detonation laser\'s range
is tens of thousands of kilometers as a minimum.  At those ranges, the
shperes would be spread too far apart to do much damage.

On the other hand, detonated no more than a couple of kilometers away,
this coule be the basic proximity warhead.  Getting closer to the target
(an "impact" hit) would increase the number of hits, but the penetration
and damage would be about the same.

Again, from detonation laser ranges, this will be ineffective.  However,
from a "proximity" hit, this could have the general effect of peppering
the target with buckshot.  From an "Impact" hit, all of these fragments
would go into one or two hit locations, with pretty severe results.

I like these, and I think that they could work.  Maybe Loren could
forward these comments to whomever is writing the boardgame, and also
for inclusion into the Technical architecture book?

The book/game probably won\'t get here to Australia for another six months

1) Does the new traveller touch on computers at all (I mean apart

2) Are the old design rules compatible (ie for vehicles). I know the
book does not have design tables, but can you make assumptions enough
on the new technology to be able to adapt old designs ?

3) The new book will cost 60$ Australian I guess, which is roughly
40$ in American currency. Is it worth it ???????

4) Are there any \'how to adapt\' guidlines for old to new traveller. I mean

As a work-around, perhaps we can assume that the provided ship designs
are as modified for exploratory trading in the wilds?  At least until we
get teh Technical Architecture manual (or wherever GDW decides to put
the starship design rules).

Definitely.  It might even be a good idea to put a Jump-0 drive into the
Technical Architecture book.  A jump drive optimized for in-system
travel; probably with a maximum range of under a half a light year per
jump.  Such a drive, particularly if it were cheaper and/or consumed
less fuel, would be particularly nice.  Say, about half size and cost of
a J-1 drive, and about half fuel consumption.  Max jump about a half a
light-year.

Perhaps Loren Wiseman can tell us how long it will be until a second
printing, and if there\'s a good way to ensure that everything we find is
brought to the attention of the proper people over there at GDW.

In my humble opinion, the multiple conflicting definitions for UWP
government codes is the single most serious problem with the rules, and
should be fixed immediately (as in "Is there still time to prepare an
errata page for the boxed edition?") if not sooner.  This multiple
definition was presumably done on purpose, although I must admit that I
can\'t figure out what the reason was.  In any case, the problems
outweigh the benefits: THIS WAS A BAD IDEA AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED; I\'m
treating it as an error, and have prepared what I think is a 
workable fix, which will be presented in a post immediately following.

this will be obsolete when Technical Architecture and Brilliant Lances comes
out, but I need this stuff now for my own campaign (starting Saturday, provided
I finish a c program that converts old sectors according to Hard Times and
\'collapse effects\' by then) so I\'ll use the following until it is superceeded.

  Data given in TTNE: Normal missiles weigh 7 tons, communicate via a lasercom, 
have 10-12 Gturns of acceleration, and use command guidance.

  Extrapolated data: They have a volume of 7m3.

  Assumptions: Normal xray missiles consist of a 150kg warhead(1), 100kg of
electronics, actuators and guidance (aka communicator), and all the rest is
a big engine. Their laser tubes are arranged to spread many beams to cover a 
large area (like the shrapnel from a claymore) and on average 3.5 beams will
impact a 100m2 target(2) on normal range.

  (1) Fractional yield nukes shouldn\'t weigh much, probably around 20kg, but
the laser tubes takes up the rest.

  (2) This is the profile area of a 50t spherical ship. I use it as baseline
since class VS (10-99t) is used as baseline with regards to hit difficulties.

  I think we should divide it into four types instead of three.
 
1 \'Shrapnel\' missiles with speed of light \'shrapnel\' effective at long range.
  This is the nuke/laser missile given in the book.
  Standard difficulty.

2 \'Shrapnel\' missiles with slow \'shrapnel\' effective at long range or spead 
  of light shrapnel effective at short range.
  Cannister missile and nuke missile.
  One level harder.

3 \'Shrapnel\' missiles with slow \'shrapnel\' effective at short range only.
  SFF missile.
  Two levels harder.

4 \'Impact only\' missiles.
  HE and HEAP.
  Three levels harder.
  
  (Short range is a km or two, long range is within the same range band. Slow 
is everything slower than light. Shrapnel too weak to damage a ship (like from 
a normal explosion) is ignored)

  I assume that types 3 and 4 include some kind of end phase autonomous 
guidance (and a proximity fuse for type 3). Apart from this I agree with your
rules on final burn fuel.

  The reason for these increased difficulties is that HE and HEAP missiles 
otherwise become more effecive than nuke/laser missiles:
  They have lesser penetration but inflicts *huge* amounts of damage.

> Active: Uses an active radar, ladar, or EMS sensor onboard the missile
> Semi-Active: Uses an active radar, ladar, or EMS sensor onboard the
> Passive: Uses a passive sensor (EMS, Neutrino, Densitometer, IR, etc) to
> Anti-Radiation: Uses a passive sensor designed to detect specific

  Isn\'t these types covered by the rules on SIM and FIM? Adding different types
is good, but I don\'t think it is necessary on this level. It can attached
as an optional rule to the FIM and SIM rules, but I don\'t think we should
include it so that it becomes necessary in order to use other missiles than
nuke/laser. We should keep it separate.

  BTW: Having some professional experience with missiles, IMHO the best
guidance model is the Track Via Missile guidance. It is basically a 
combination of the best features of FIM and SIM.

  The missile has sensors of it\'s own and a guidance computer (as a FIM) but
it has also a communication link to the firing vessel (as a SIM or command
guided).
  The link enables the missile to use the much more powerful computer \'on the
ground\' (ie on the firing ship in our case)\' while the onboard guidance takes
over if the link is broken. The dual viewpoints (sensors on the firing ship 
and in the missile) makes it more discriminating versus countermeasures.

  In traveller terms, I\'d describe it as a FIM that uses the best of gunners
skill and onboard skill as long as it is in communication with the firing
ship during the final round. Normal restrictions on number of simultaneously
controlled missiles apply during this round.
  An additional trick that is possible with TVM missiles is the \'accumulated
wave attack\'. Missiles are fired during several rounds and given (one at the
time) orders such that they will all arrive at the target simultaneously,
overwhelming its defences.

  The soft xrays are totally absorbed by air \'within a few feet\' from the bomb,
so I think all of them should stick in the hull on the side facing the 
explosion. But the shock could travel on through the hull and affect all areas
to a lesser degree.

  I made some calculation on a missile that will spread 15000 1cm tungsten
spheres (10g each, total warhead weight 150kg). 

  To achieve 3.5 hits against a 100m3 target, there has to be one sphere per
30m3. The radius of the cloud at impact will thus be 400m. To achieve a spread
of 400m at a closing velocity of 1 to 30 (60,000km/h to 1,800,000km/h) and
a range of 30,000 km (one range band) requires a radial velocity of 0.2m/s to
6m/s. 
  So I persist that the \'detonation\' range of the cannister round can be the 
same as for the xray missile:) (Although I think a variable rate gas generator 
might be more appropriate than a charge, since the rate of dispersion has to 
vary with the closing velocity).

>>The SFF round uses an explosive warhead that generate the \'cloud of buckshot\'

  Yup, you need to be within a kilometer or two.

  Perhaps too severe for game balance. The effect of one 10mm tungsten sphere
at 16km/second (closure velocity of 1) is 2-30 if I write it in the same
form as the laser damage. Imagine a 7 ton missile...

  I\'ll post a message with tenative designs for HE, HEAT, Cannister, SFF and
LGB missiles as soon as I\'ve typed them in.

  Featured missiles: HE, HEAP, Cannister, SFF and the LGB pseudomissile.
(What? No proximity nukes? Nope, I did these because I need them in a campaign
 and I can with absolute certainty predict that the PC\'s won\'t get any nukes,
 not even of the nuke/laser variety. Period:)

  Further assumptions: The nuke/laser assembly represents the largest part of
the price of normal missiles. After that comes the electronics and the cheapest
part is the actual engine.

  All missiles weigh 7000kg and are 7m3 big.

HE missile.
  This missile has a 1000kg High Explosive warhead that needs to be in physical
contact with the target to cause damage. When used against surface targets it
has a good blast effect but is lacking in fragmentation.
  The extremely large warhead impairs its acceleration at low TL\'s. The 100kg
electronics etc package include a contact trigger and simple terminal guidance.
  Hitting with this missile is three levels more difficult.
  On a successful hit, only apply the damage once.

15 	20k	10	2-125	C:250 B:50 Pen:120C

HEAP missile.
  This missile has a 150kg High Explosive Armour Piercing warhead that needs to
be in physical contact with the target to cause damage. When used against
surface target it is lacking in blast and fragmentation compared to the HE
missile and is also more expensive.
  The 100kg electronics package include a contact trigger and simple terminal
guidance.
  Hitting with this missile is three levels more difficult.
  On a successful hit, only apply the damage once.

Cannister missile.
  This missile releases 15,000 10g 10mm tungsten spheres into a cloud to ensure
that at least one of them hits the target. The cloud is released at a range of 
30,000km and the velocity with which it expands is automatically selected
based on the closing velocity between the missile and the target to achieve
the maximum probability of a hit.
  The damage comes from the kinetic energy of the spheres. The specific damage
depends greatly on the closing speed of the missile and the target.
  The warhead of this missile weighs 150kg and the 100kg electronics package
is assumed to contain the mechanism that disperses the spheres.
  Hitting with this missile is one level more difficult.
  As with a normal missile, apply the given damage 1D6 times.

  When used against surface targets the cannister missile will work as a
3 round burst of automatic fire against each 10mx10m square in a 400m radius.
Each hit has damage 30 and penetration 2. The missile must be modified before
it can be used in this manner. 
  Even after this modification this missile is unusable against targets on
worlds with an atmosphere thicker than Very Thin. It will make a good
albeit expensive aproximation of a meteor shower however.


SFF missile.
  This missile uses the \'self forging fragments\' phenomena to generate a
cloud of fragments that hit the target. At a few kilometers from the target
the missile deploys and detonates several panels consisting of explosives on 
the back and metal that will form the fragments on the front (facing the
target).
  The damage comes from the kinetic energy of the fragments. The specific damage
depends greatly on the closing speed of the missile and the target.
  When used against surface targets, the panels doesn\'t deploy. Instead the
metal forms lethal fragments similar to how a normal artillery round work.
  The warhead of this missile weighs 250kg and contains 150kg of explosives and
100kg of metal. The 100kg electronics package is assumed to include simple
terminal guidance and a proximity fuse.
  Hitting with this missile is two levels more difficult.
  As with a normal missile, apply the given damage 1D6 times.

LGB pseudomissile.
  This is, as the name states, not a real missile. Instead this is a missile-
shaped container with 6 1000kg laser guided iron bombs. The container is fired
as a normal missile and the communication laser of the missile turret can be 
used to designate a surface target from up to 10,000m altitude. Any higher
than that (or if it is bad weather on the surface) and another unit closer
to the surface have to handle the designation.
  The individual bombs can not handle atmospheric reentry in any atmosphere
thicker than Very Thin. If they are used to attack a target on a world with
thicker atmosphere, the ship has to be inside the atmopshere at the time of
launch.
  The spread can be chosen: The bombs can either all hit at the same time or
with up to 5 seconds of separations.
  This type of \'missile\' can *not* hit a ship unless it stands still on the
ground.

  A version carrying 4 bombs where each bomb has an ablative heat shielding
that enables them to be deployed from orbit over worlds with an atmosphere
of Dense or thinner is available for twice the cost.


Notes on the roles of these missiles.
  The HE is the basic cheapo missile, hard to hit with but does good damage 
when it hits. It will do a real number of most surface targets. However it
is slow and pretty much unusable a anything but the closest ranges.
  The HEAP inflicts more damage and has better range at the expense of worse
performance against surface targets and a higher price.
  The Cannister is the poor mans nuke/laser. It is almost as easy to hit with,
but it is highly dependent on the closure rate and has generally low 
penetration. It is also next to unusable against surface targets.
  The SFF is an ambivalent missile. It not so good against ships as the 
Cannister, and even though good against surface targets it is too expensive
to use against them. But if you want a missile that can do everything adequatly
the SFF is it.
  The LGB finally is a cheap teddybuster suitable for use against moderately
well defended surface targets. 
  (Against undefended surface targets the \'Argentine Bomb Sights\' method is
better: You hover over the target and roll the bombs off the loading ramp
manually).

    'body' => 'There is a severe problem in the Traveller: The New Era world generation
rules (I believe it was Steve Higginbotham who first noticed it).
The error is in the government type codes: there are two mutually
incompatible tables for government type - one set for the Wilds, and the
other for everything else.  In addition, the UWP data *DOES NOT INCLUDE*
a code that tells you which table to use!  For example, given the UWP
"1827 G867975-8" *THERE IS NO WAY OF DETERMINING* whether it is a
balkanized world or a "mystic dictatorship".  Well, maybe I should go
ask the Pope...

I\'ve decided to treat this problem as an error; the following errata
should produce a workable fix:

pp.188, "World Government" table - change the following entries:
Code  General Description
0 ---- No Government Structure.  In many cases family, clan, or tribal
      bonds predominate,
D ---- Religious Dictatorship.  Government by a religious, mystic, or psionic
      minority which has little regard for the needs of the citizenry.
E ---- Religious Autocracy.  Government by a single religious, mystic, or
      psionic leader having absolute power over the citizenry.

pp.191, paragraph 7, "Government" - change the entry to read:
	First determine if the world is balkanized.  Add the world size
and population code and subtract the tech level to determine the
balkanization number.  Roll 2d6; if the number rolled is equal to less
than the balkanization number, the world is balkanized.  In this case,
the government type is 7.  The referee can determine national government
types as the need arises, using the same technique as is detailed below
for non-balkanized worlds.
	Second, if the world\'s population code is 5+, determine the
presence of Technologically Elevated Dictators (TED).  Find the total
number of tech levels lost in Step 2 and roll 1d10.  If the roll is less
than the number of tech levels lost, the world\'s government
automatically becomes a TED.  Place the code Td in the world\'s
allegiance code, and roll 2d6 on the TED Government Type to determine
the actual form of the TED government.
	If the roll is equal to or greater than the tech level decline,
or if the world\'s population code is 4 or less, roll for the new
government as follows:
	Roll 2d6-7 + Population code.  Record this number for reference
in determining the world\'s law level.  Find the result on the Government
Types in the Wilds table; the corresponding code is the world\'s
Government code.

pp.191, "Government Types in the Wilds" - replace with the following:
Die   Code  General Description
Roll
 1- - 0 ---- No Government
 2  - 2 ---- Participating Democracy
 3  - 4 ---- Representative Democracy
 4  - A ---- Charismatic Dictatorship
 5  - C ---- Charismatic Oligarchy
 6  - Roll 2d6 on the "TED Government Type" table, and note Allegiance = Td
 7  - D ---- Religious Dictatorship
 8  - F ---- Totalitarian Oligarchy
 9  - E ---- Religious Autocracy
10  - 8 ---- Civil Service Bureaucracy
11  - 3 ---- Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy
12+ - 9 ---- Impersonal Bureaucracy

pp.191, "TED Government Type" table - new table:

 3 ---- 3 ---- Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy
 4 ---- 6 ---- Captive Government

 8 ---- F ---- Totalitarian Oligarchy
 9 ---- E ---- Religious Autocracy
10 ---- D ---- Religious Dictatorship
11 ---- A ---- Charismatic Dictatorship
12 ---- C ---- Charismatic Oligarchy

pp.191, paragraph 8, "Law Level" - change the entry to read:
	If the world is balkanized, the law level represents the most
commonly encountered law level on the world.  The referee should
establish a law level for each nation as the need arises.  Roll 2d6 to
determine the most commonly encountered law level of a balkznaized
world.
	If the world government is a TED, the nroll 2d6+3 to determine
the world\'s law level.
	Otherwise, roll 2d6-7 and add the world government die roll
(recorded in step seven above) to determine the law level.


Retcons:

The retcons required to implement this change should be minor; only
materials produced with the uncorrected T:TNE rules, and which use the
Wilds government type table will need to be changed.  The following table
summarizes the corrections needed:

Old   New
Code  Code
0 ---- 0
1 ---- 0
2 ---- 2
3 ---- 4
4 ---- A
5 ---- C
6 ---- 6 (or roll 2d6 on the "TED Government Type" table) Allegiance = Td
7 ---- D
8 ---- F
9 ---- E
A ---- 8
B ---- 3
C ---- 9

A couple of caveats are in order, however.  First of all, the UWP for
governments in the Wilds provides no way of determining if the world is
balkanized.  The table above ignores this; the preferable solution would
be to test for a balkanized world as described in the modified paragraph
7 above.  Second, TED governments should be generated using the TED
Government Type table above, as noted in the retcon table.



Comments and Reasoning:

The primary goal was to create a single table of government types which
could be used no matter where the world was located.  An examination of
the original "Government Types in the Wilds" table revealed that all but
four of the government types were identical to ones already in use in
the "Normal" government types table (although with different code
values or slightly expanded definitions). 

Of the four new codes, "Mystic Dictatorship" and "Mystic
Autocracy" were defined nearly the same way as "Religious Dictatorship"
and "Religious Autocracy", except for two words ("or psionic") in the
general description.  Since I, for one, have had psionic religions in my
Traveller games for more than ten years, I didn\'t see much difference
between the two, and folded them together.  Two down and two to go.

The "Tribal Government" is an interesting idea; kind of a half-step
between no government whatsoever and a more formal government.  With
some hesitation, I folded it into "No Government"; if a new set of
government codes were to be devised, this one in particular should get
its own code.

The last code is "Technologically Elevated Dictator (TED)".  The more I
think about this one, the more I feel that this classification isn\'t
really a government type, but rather a classification (like Autocracy,
Oligarchy, or Democracy); any of the more opressive government types
could be (or could become) a TED, provided that they 
meet the criteria: use of relic or other advanced
technology to maintain their rule, and a certain amount of
unfriendlieness to interstellar visitors (Reformation Coalition in
particular).

Thus, the decision that a TED was better represented by a government
code that indicated what form the government actually took, plus a note
that it is considered a TED.


Let me know what you all think!

That sounds good, too.  But I\'m going to argue that Cannister missiles
should be in category three (short-range shrapnel missiles).  The levels
of difficulty seem about right, too.  One more thing: in category four,
we should probably add "smart rocks": an "impact only" missile with no
warhead; damage by kinetic energy of impact.

I was assuming that the exact type and capability of the terminal
guidance would make a big difference in the effectiveness of the
missile.  But you have a good point; the basics are covered under the
FIM/SIM rules.  The sensor/guidance system types should be optional
rules.

I\'m partial to inertial with terminal active radar homing (and of
course, the bearing only launch option).  The USN Harpoon is a good
example of what I mean.

That sounds reasonable; and the same rules can apply to any type of FIM
missile that has a command reciever as well.  One more thing I can think
of, though.  T:TNE assumes a tightbeam command link (laser); if the
missile ever goes fully independent (the command limk is cut off for
whatever reason), you can\'t re-acquire the missile ---- it stays in FIM
mode because you no longer have accurate pointing data your laser.

That\'s what I was thinking.  1H for those areas that absorbed X-ray
energy directly, and 1h for those areas that were subject to the
concussion transmitted through the ship.

I persist in insisting that it\'s practically impossible.  You are
putting the detination at 30,000km from the target; anywhere from anout
a minute to nearly thirty minutes between detonation and impact.  But
you can no longer guide that cloud of pellets after detonation.
Assuming the worst case, the target has only to move 400m in that minute
in order to be 100% safe; this works out to slightly under 0.25g ---- for
slower approach velocities, the neccessicary accelleration is even less.
So even minor "jinking" by the target can throw off the aim of the
cannister shot; the maneuver expenditure is relatively minor, so ships
could afford to jump around this way even if they didn\'t detect a
missile closing on them.

On the other hand, detonating one of these at a kilometer or so away
gives the target less than 0.005 second to respond; getting an assumed
50m diameter ship out of the path of the fragments would require
thousands of Gs of accelleration.

No; fire the bursting charge based on estimated time to impact, so that
the fragments always have the same amount of time to disperse.

But hitting the target is pretty hard, as we have both pointed out.
Cannister rounds detonated at tens of thousands of km provide the target
with far too much time to get out of the way.

A couple of other points which have occurred to me: the missiles use a
laser link for communications to the firing ship.  A cannister of
anti-laser "sand" placed at just the right spot should do wonders to
break this link; and once lost, it should be nearly impossible to
re-establish.  I\'d treat it as firing the sandcaster at the missile; a
hit breaks the link, the results of which depend on the type of guidance
the missile has.

Managing to intercept the target and go for a proximity or impact hit
should be considerably easier if you are quite close to the target.
Like in the same range band with it.  Does T:TNE already have a modifier
for this? (if not, there probably should be one for <1 range band and >5
range bands for proximity and impact missiles).

Aside from the gotcha with cannister, I\'ve seen these and like them.

  Perhaps category 2 should be modified from slow shrapnel on long ranges
to slow shrapnel on medium ranges.

  I looked on how much an evading ship could burn since the detonation, and 
moving 400m at 6G takes a little more than 3s. At closing velocity 1, the
shrapnel moves 48km in 3s, and 48km is significantly more than the \'a few km\'
that is the range of nuke and SFF missiles (big enough difference to warrant
category 2 IMHO).
  (Back to the charge idea: The spheres has to spread with 130m/s radial to
get to 400m in 3s.)

  The reason for my perservance is that I think there is need for a cheap 
non-nuke missile that works with a penalty of one difficulty level and lower
damage and penetration. It fills a niche.

  Yes, but like I said, I don\'t want to think about the impact energy of this
one.

  Guess we look on them from different viewpoints: I look on them as SAM\'s or
AAM\'s and you use the SSM model:)

  Depends on how tightbeam that laser is, and on if the firing vessel has
a sensor lock on the missile itself.

  I have an nasty suspicion that a kinetic only missile would be more 
effective than a HE missile... I don\'t have my books here, but I think the 
energy even at closing velocity 1 would be in the nuclear range (0.1 to 10kt).

  But think about the trouble to predict where that spot will be. Both the
launcher, the missile and the target jets around at high speed and the TNE
sand casters don\'t work in the \'eject a large unguided cloud of sand\' mode
of classic Traveller.

  I wonder if it is necessary. A simple trader firing a impact only missile
on a Small target within the same range band will have a Formidable task
(Average to begin with, +3 to Impossible for the missile, -1 for the size of
 the target) which usually is a hit 25% of the time. That is good for a 
target that potentially can be 30,000km away.

  Ok, perhaps. But not more than -1 difficulty.

  My idea was that the \'simple terminal guidance\' I talk about removes the
need for an extra mod for >5 range bands above and beyond the usual -1
per 3 range bands.

  Thanks. 

  BTW: Does anyone have other ideas for missiles? I have thought about a 
nuke pumped \'fusion gun\' warhead analogous to the laser warhead but fail to
see how it would differ to any significant degree.
  Cluster warheads are also a possibility but the anti-ship effect of those 
would be inferior to cannister IMHO.

  I\'m still amazed in a negative sense by this. There must be a lazy

  Have anyone considered setting up a postal order outfit specializing in
getting it within a few weeks? Or is the hobby too small for this in AU?

  It *could* be introduced as a special code. But I don\'t know which codes
that has been used.

  (BTW: A related problem that I found out when designing the program: There
are two different \'Gov 0\' in Hard Times... I\'m thinking of using the Hiver

It may be.  If so, we should chuck the HE and HEAP missiles in favor of
a KEAP missile (cheaper, and lighter too!).  Could you work out this and
the nuclear missiles we discussed earlier (I *still* haven\'t gotten back
to that section in T:TNE ---- I\'ve been reading through it carefully, and
spending far too much time posting on the net:).  Then I\'ll pull it all
together so that we have everything in one place.

True, but blocking the missile\'s commo link with sand *has* to be easier
than taking out the missile with anti-missile laser fire.

You are probably right; I haven\'t read the complete combat rules yet.
25% is a high enough chance; I was afraid that it would be less than
that.

OK.

On the other hand, they could be very useful for a planetary attack
missile.  How about a series of missiles with re-entry heat-shields and
HE, HEAP, CBM, and nuclear (and probably thermonuclear) warheads?

Other possibilities: a cheap, light-weight missile with (say) about 7
G-turns of fuel and warhead, shorter endurance, etc.  Designed
to be launched from fighters at close range (in the same range band).
These can probably get by with a much simpler guidance system
(laser-designated target?).  Although the lower cost is nice, the real
goal is a smaller, lighter missile, so that a fighter could have 2 or 4
on launch rails.

Other ideas:
	The T:TNE equivalent of a phalanx gun: installed in a turret
hardpoint, this is a small, rapid-fire laser (or gatling laser).  It has
it\'s own sensor, and fires at anything that comes near.  It can operate
in FIM (Fully-Independent Mode) or SIM, just like a missile.  Intended
to be a defense against proximity and impact missiles, its damage and
penetration aren\'t much, but effective against missiles out to about
100km.
	Sensor drone: the same general size and shape as a standard
missile, but the "warhead" is the best sensor system that can be crammed
into the available space (probably with a folding array).  Communicates
sensor data back to the mother ship.  Recoverable/reusable.

  I think there are things to discuss wrgt the KEAP missiles still. Regarding
nukes I am 25% of the way through \'The Effects of Nuclear Weapons\' and I\'ll
have to do som wild guesses in any case (mostly with regards to how damage in
TNE relates to damage in Real Life) so it might take a little time too.

  (A NPC have 50% chance of dying after 10D of concussion damage. Since this
very aproximately equals 65 PSI (but it is different with conventional
weapons) so each die can be assumed to be 6.5 PSI)

  I\'ve looked on the kinetic energies of 200kg (100kg electronics etc and 100kg
structural members of the burned out engine. I assume a solid fuel engine 
here but I have a few ideas on how to make a solid fuel rocket maneuverable)
moving at from 1 to 30 range bands(1). But remember that this is less than
half the normal payload, so this type of missile should get aprox 20 Gturns.

 (1) It would be really nice to know the \'typical closing velocity\', but we
     don\'t have that data yet. If someone runs a space combat with missiles,
     please please note their closing velocity and post it to the TML.

  The kinetic energy varies between 2.8e10 J and 2.5e13J which is the same 
as 0.006 to 6 kilotons. Redone into kg of TNT and via the demolition rules
into penetration means 705 to 21,000 or 30 to 900 major hits worth. This is
well above the damage of either the HE or HEAP, even at velocity 1. Definite
shipkiller size, since you only need 200 in remaining penetration after armour
to inflict a critical hit on a ship of any size.


  Based on the classic studies of optimum ship design done for TCS, I suspect 
that missiles this effective will totally transform the game. Any price of 
warship can be matched by an equal tonnage of cheaper missile craft (100T 6G 
J1, 1 missile turret) that has a good chanse of getting in a few hits and the 
warship is history.

  This would be a retcon even more major than those jumpbarges we discussed
just before the pocket mailing list started.


  Do we want this? And if we don\'t, how do we explain it away? One big grey
area is how a heavy object of low density behaves when it collides with a
very dense material. It is also debatable wether energy translates directly 
into penetration.

  Using Richard Ogorkiewicz \'Technology of Tanks\' as a source on how things
behave when they collide at high speeds I have two guesses: The first is that
the penetration goes up with speed, but it doesn\'t increase much with speeds
over 5km/s. Since velocity 1 is 16km/s, we are well into the flat part of
the curve in all cases. Since the equations for penetrators approach the
equations for shaped charge jets we can assume that the missile is a shaped
charge jet and use those simpler equations:)
  The maximum penetration is thus:

		     Density of jet
  Length of jet * ( ----) ^ 0.5
		    Density of target

  Using the density of the missiles engine (the electronics package is
denser but it is too short) which I assume to be 0,014, the length of the
missile (7m) and the density of the hull (7 for steel, this is a best 
case penetration caculation) the maximum penetration is 318mm aka Pen 63. 
It won\'t penetrate an SDB!! (sorry, PDB:)
  
  That is good news, since that is aproximately the same total penetration
as the HE missile and *less* than the HEAP missile. So they will still have
a place, and the KEAP missile will not be the ultimate shipkiller.
  
  (I suspect the excess energy goes into transforming the missile and those
300mm of hull into plasma. I don\'t have any data on the energy needed to 
transform various metals into plasma so it is only a guess)

  (Yes, I know we can put a 7m depleted uranium penetrator in the center of the
missile and it will penetrate 11m of armour steel if it gets a closing velocity
of 4 or more. I think the question is if we want the missile boat to rule or 
not. If we do we mention the KEAPDU missile, otherwise we ignore it.)

  The laser fire is speed of light, the sand is slower.

  Evasion will make it smaller (to 12% or smaller, assuming skill 5 and stat 5
of the firing character). And it is possible that having a MFD might increase
it to up to 95%.

  Why missiles? It would be cheaper to use the \'LGB preudomissile\' model
and fill the empty shell with guided bombs of different kinds. 7000kg of 
TL-13 \'Rockeyes\' will impress almost anyone.

  (Correction: I started to think about the weights and densities of bombs,
and a 1000kg bomb will probably only displace around 0.3m3, so both the 
heatshield and non-heatshield LGB pseudomissile should contain 6 1000kg
bombs: That the weight has to conform to the normal missile is the limiting
factor, not space).

  Remember that a 6G ships has a 12 Gturns per turn capability. To reach it
you need a missile that has more.

  Or make them short but of the same diameter as normal missiles so that 
several can be stacked in a normal launch tube and launched one at the time.

  I\'ll look on this later. We\'d probably need the Techbook and Shipdesign
book to do them correctly, though.

Hi People,

I recently picked up a copy of the old Traveller Book in a 2nd
hand shop. I like it. 

Problem: no sourcebooks, no modules, no imagination :^)

Seeing as I can\'t get hold of any adventures, I was hoping anyone
who had some ideas for scenarios etc might mail them to me.

As I intend this to be the RPG game we play when no-one else
shows up, so I\'ll probably run it with only 2 players.

By the way, has anyone got a simple point based character
generation system for Traveller ?

Oh, and how about deck plans for some of the standard craft?

Feel free to deluge my mailbox with suggestions :^)

Thanks in advance,

Murray

Hi Murray,

I\'m the Internet Traveller Mailing List Adminstrator. I forwarded your
posting to rec.games.frp.misc on to the TML. If you want to plug in to
recent discussion on Traveller, please feel free to ask to be added to
TML. If not (the discussion is at all levels and sometimes is over the
head of newer folks, unless they\'re patient to read and learn), that\'s
fine too. I hope one or more of us can get you some good answers!

BTW, if you have anonymous ftp, check out ftp.engrg.uwo.ca
(129.100.100.12, dir pub/traveller). Another thing to check out is The
Weekend Warrior, a place in California that sells out-of-print gaming
materials, esp. Traveller. I\'m sure they\'d have a pile of adventure
modules available. If you\'re interested I\'ll get you the address. Deck
Plans? Check out the (out of print) Traders and Gunboats book.

Well, actually, I would consider any ship that pulled only 1G and was
unarmed to be totally useless for exploratory trading in the Wilds.  So,
no, *I* couldn\'t assume that.  The rest of you will decide these things
for yourself, without any inputs from me, of course...

This is what we have been using in our own campaign for many years.  J-0
uses 5% of ship\'s displacement fuel to go up to 10,000AU.

100 Diameters Travel Times:

Time in hours unless otherwise mentioned.  Accurate to 1/10 hour.  Note
that the basic assumption that G-hours can be used as a velocity in
these calculations is adhered to, though many of the numbers in the
size-0 column are small enough that the assumption is not really valid.

== : time required to expend the specified G-hours.
time/== : (specified time OR time required to expend specified G-hours,
whichever is GREATER) OR 25 min, whichever is LESS.  Basically a really
short time.

Before you get too attached to this idea, remember that these missile
all are capable of WELL OVER 100,000m/s delta-V.  These are NOT simple,
solid-fuel missiles.  These are fusion-rocket missiles, and so the
drives are likely to be more expensive than you might guesstimate.

Note also that you are assuming that the det lasers are sprayed wildly
when detonated.  It is probably safe to assume that each lasing element
has the necessary controls to POINT itself at a target before detonation
occurs.

This is a joke, right?  At 30,000Km, the target ship would have to
expend around _1G-second_ laterally to make sure that the cloud of
pebbles makes a clean miss.

I like this, but I wonder at the necessity of a TED table at all.  TEDs
are relatively common in classic Trav material (Pavabid, which has a
TED/Religious Dictatorship comes immediately to mind), so why bother
listing it separately?  This sounds like an attempt to codify something
best left to the referee\'s imagination...

I disagree with this.  A TED CANNOT maintain tight control with a
dwindling supply of HighTech goodies.  What he will have is a HIGH Law
Level WHERE HE IS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT, and almost NO Law Level anywhere
else (since it is NOT in his interests to establish a real government to
run things - they might decide HE is optional, especially if they have
access to his goodies.  If they DON\'T, then they will be pretty much
incapable of running things (think of Prison Trustees, in the absence of
Guards)).

I take it that they\'re doing the nuclear X-Ray laser missile ala 2300
in TNE now. So, unless there are several alternatives (such as those
that have been suggested), it would appear that missiles would not be
very common on many civilian ships because of the Imperial No-Nukes
policy.

Now, not being a Nuclear Weapons Engineer (I prefer steam locomotives
:-), I understood nuclear weapons to be much less effective in
space compared to an atmospheric burst. Obviously, impact is impact
regardles of the environment, but a nuclear weapon gets a lot of its
power from the shockwave that it produces as the explosion pushes the
air out from the blast.

In space, ain\'t no air to push, so I would think that they would lose
a lot of their shock value, specifically in a proximity situation.
Now, they would still produce zany amounts of heat, which I would
guess would travel nicely through space. 

Also, with the closing velocities that the ships will have, explosives 
seem pretty weak compared good \'ol kinetic energy. (A paragraph or two
out of \'The Forever War\' comes to mind...).

So, I guess I\'m asking what you folks are thinking about with these
new missile designs. I like the Shrapnel idea, sounds rather nasty to
me. But, if you can get a 3-5 ton vehicle to actually IMPACT a ship
then why bother with an explosive?

I guess one way would be to send in a salvo of nuclear missles to fry
all the sensors off of the ship, then follow up with a couple of tons
of cinder block or whatever to knock on their door.

Overall, I just don\'t think that an HE missile would be very effective
(assuming that the explosive is designed to hurt the ship versus deploy
a munition).

TNE is in Australia.  I received my copy three days ago from the Australian
distributor (Mil Sims in Melbourne) and I know our local games shop has it
in stock or they did two days ago.  How long it will last is another question,
and resupplies of stocks here do take a long time.

 ... way too much.  Probably the kinetic energy of impact doesn\'t convert
readily into explosion damage, and so the demolition rules are producing
funny numbers.

I don\'t think we want this, and it seems that you\'ve managed to explain

That\'s much better!  Lethal to unarmored ships, but a warship with
enough armor doesn\'t have to worry as much (and as you point out, it
leaves a place for the HEAP missile).

HEAP missiles can reasonably be restricted-purchase items (since the
only thing they are really good for is shooting at military-type ships).

My feeling is that we keep very hush-hush about the KEAPDU missile;
after all, it may not even be practical (how much does that slug of
depleted uranium weigh, after all).

95% seems a little too high ... maybe we should work out some way that a
MFD has less (or no) effect on these new missiles.  Or maybe increase
the difficulty of impact and close-proximity so thatyou *have* to have a
MFD to have any reasonable chance of hitting with them.  What do you
think?

Good point.  That\'s enough to ruin almost any TED\'s day.

Ummm, I don\'t see that bit anywhere; but I do see on pp.313 "Each ship
may spend a number of G-turns limited by its G rating (maneuver
performance)" ---- so I concluded that a 6 G ship has 6 Gturns of combat
maneuver capability.  Each Gturn of combat maneuver burns a half of a
G-Hour of maneuver fuel (because each turn is a half an hour).

I also see a potential problem with the space combat rules.  On pp.313
it says "each 2 Gturns of accelleration spent by a ship changes the
closing velocity for the current turn by one".  However, by referring to
good old Sir Isaac:

Accelleration = Constant             A = 10 m/s^2
Velocity = Acelleration * Time       V = 10 m/s^2 * 30 m
                                       = 10 m/2^2 * 1800 s = 18000 m/s
                                                           = 64800 km/hr
Distance = 0.5 * Accell * Time ^ 2   D = 0.5 * 10 m/s^2 * 1800^2 s^2
                                       = 5 m/2^2 * 3240000 s^2
                                       = 16200000 m = 16200 km

Putting this into T:TNE terms, a velocity of 1 is one range band per
combat turn (or 30000km per 30 mins; 60000 km/hr).  A distance of 1 is
one range band (or 30000km), and the unit of time is the turn (30
minutes; 1800 s).

SO, each Gturn of accelleration increases the ship\'s velocity *for next
turn* by slightly over 1 band/turn.  The distance travelled in the 
*current turn* during this accelleration is slightly more than a half a
range band per Gturn of accelleration expended.


FIX: alter the "Speed Change" and "Compute New Range" paragraphs on
pp.313-314 to read as follows:
	SPEED CHANGE: Each ship may spend a number of Gturns limited by
its G rating (maneuver performance) in order to modify the closing
velocity.  Each Gturn of accelleration spent by a ship changes the closing
velocity *for the next turn* by one.  In addition, each 2 Gturns of
accelleration spent changes the closing velocity *for the current turn*
by one (drop fractions).  The closing velocity may be increased or
decreased.  As Gturns of accelleration are spent, players must
declare whether they are going to increase or decrease the closing
velocity.
	COMPUTE NEW RANGE: At the end of each turn, subtract the current
closing velocity (the velocity *for this turn* as computed above) from
the current range to get the new range for the next turn.  When the
closing velocity is a negative number, remember that subtracting a
negative number is the same as adding a positive number, thus actually
increasing the range.

ALTERNATE FIX: the above, while accurate, may seem too complicated for
some players.  Thus, the suggested simplified fix: alter the "Speed
Change" and "Compute New Range" paragraphs on pp.313-314 to read:
	SPEED CHANGE: Each ship may spend a number of Gturns limited by
its G rating (maneuver performance) in order th modify the closing
velocity.  Each Gturn of accelleration spent by a ship changes the
closing velocity *for the next turn* by one.  The closing velocity may
be increased or decreased.  As Gturns of accelleration are spent,
players must declare whether they are going to increase or decrease the
closing velocity.
	COMPUTE NEW RANGE: At the end of each turn, subtract the current
closing velocity (before the speed changes above) from the current range
to get the new range for the next turn.  When the closing velocity is a
negative number, remember that subtracting anegative number is the same
as adding a positive number, thus actually increasing the range.


EXAMPLES: To help clarify what\'s going on, the following examples
presime that a standard Scout/Courier (maneuver performance 2 G) is
closing in at velocity 4 on a patrol ship which is station-keeping 8
range bands away.  The scoutship wants to break to a stop as quickly as
possible.

NEWTON: A = 20 m/s^2.  240000 km/hr = 66667 m/s = 20 m/s^2 * T s.  Time
to decellerate to a stop is T = 3333 s = 55.6 min, or about 2 turns.
Distance travelled while stopping is D = 0.5 * A * T^2 = 111111 km, or
about 3.7 range bands.  The ship is stopped at the end of the second
turn, slightly more than 4 range bands from the patrol ship.

ORIGINAL: In the first turn, the scout/courier expends 2Gturns of
accelleration (at a cost of 1 Ghour of fuel).  Velocity changes by 1;
the new velocity is 3, and the new range is 5.  In the second turn, the
scout continues brakeing; new velocity 2, new range 3.  Turn 3: velocity
1, range 2.  Turn 4: the scout comes to a stop at a range of 2.

FIX: In the first turn, the scout expends 2 Gturns of accelleration (at
a cost of 1 Ghour of fuel).  Current velocity is decreases by 1 (to 3);
and the next turn\'s velocity decreases by 2 (to 2).  The new range is 5.
In the second turn, current velocity becomes 1, and the new velocity
decreases to 0 (the ship will stop at the end of the turn).  The new
range is 4.

ALTERNATE FIX: In the first turn, the scout expends 2 Gturns of
accelleration (at a cost of 1 Ghour of fuel).  Current velocity is
unchanged (still 4), and the next turn\'s velocity decreases by 2 (to 2).
The new range is 6.  In the second turn, the current velocity is 2, the
new velocity is 0, and the range is 4.

	Armour absorbs hits equal to twice its armour levels when hit by a
sword (indeed, any melee weapon, except bare hands).  So a sword (damage
2) does NOT penetrate AC1.
	A man with strength 6 and unarmed melee combat 7 has an unarmed
damage value of 4.  Armour absorbs twice its armour value when hit by a
man with his bare hands, BUT the man also takes one point of damage to
his hand when he hits the armour.

	So the armour allows 2 pts through when hit by a bare hand, and none
through when hit by a sword.

	Note that this is subject to interpretation.  Dark Conspiracy
describes the armed melee rules slightly differently (and the damage
from a sword differently also), and under THAT particular incarnation of
the rules, a sword will generally do more than a man will with his bare
hands.  In the original T2K2 rules, armed melee combat is described
similarly to those on DC, but the sword is again different, and in that
case, the bare hands win out over the sword as long as the man doing the
punching is reasonably strong...

  I should practice better dispositions, really. I forgot to note that the
\'penetration is dependent on the densities\' was way #2 to reduce the 
penetration. And I also forgot to include the limiting effect of those 5km/s
I was talking about.

  Using both, the damage of a KEAP will be 3-200, which means that it will
be rated like this compared to HE and HEAP:

  Damage to thin armour	Damage to thick armour	Surface targets
  	HEAP			HEAP			HE
  	KEAP			KEAP			HEAP
  	HE			HE			KEAP

  So there might be a niche for the HE as a cheap multipurpose missile (while
the SFF is a better but more expensive multipurpose).

  Possibly.

  Using a DU penetrator with a slenderness of 1:100 (normal today is 1:20)
around 400kg, but that slenderness might be physically impossible (too slender
and it will break instead of penetrating). With a slenderness of 1:20...
twelve tons.
  Yes, this might make a good excuse.


  BTW: I think the Cannister and SFF missiles should be modified since their
max damage is dependent on the penetration and it is limited in the same ways
as that of the KEAP missile. 
  (2-50 at all speeds for the Cannister and 3-110 for the SFF since it has 
larger fragments. It is probably possible to design it to reach these levels,
but the number of fragments might have to be reduced).

  I think restricting MFD\'s to military ships is a better option. I\'m reminded
of the old starship combat discussion where I wanted there to be a major
difference between military and civilian ships, and the MFD could be a way
of doing this.

  Argh! I misinterpreted the \'Friendly Velocity\' formula on page 324.

  Didn\'t someone do a very cheap KEAP missile according to the megatraveller
rules? It might have changed now of course. I\'ll put in a higher overhead for
the engine in the missiles, but then there has been an opening for solid
fuel missiles with a low amount of Gturns for close in work.

  Actually I imagined something more shotgun-like. All elements are fixed 
mounted with minuscle differences in direction, and the entire missile is
pointed towards the target.

To Joe Heck:

Lab Ship deck plans were published in the Double Adventure Death Station. 
I can\'t remember what the second half was called, or which number it was,
but I\'ll post that to you tomorrow.  Also, one of the DGP Traveller\'s
Digests (about number 16?) published a reduced set of plans in the form of
an SGS advert, and of course SGS publish large scale deckplans at about
the price of a house!

To Sean Maguire:

I\'ve always seen fusion rockets as sort of fusion guns used for thrust.  I
can\'t see why they should be hindered in operation by an atmosphere,
although I would have thought they would be polluting and damaging, as
they spew out fusing plasma (presumably).

To UK subscribers:

T:TNE was in Fantasy World in Hanley (Potteries/Stoke-on-Trent) on
Tuesday, but there was only one copy left on the shelf!

I\'ve always wondered why 6G was chosen as the maximum acceleration available
for M-Drives.  It seems pretty arbitrary to me.  It\'s been a while, but at one
point I extended the High-Guard tables into the 10G range (as I remember,) and
it was possible to design a sub-100 ton craft with sufficient agility as to
make it nearly impossible to hit.  Add a large enough computer running a souped
up Maneuver/Evade, and you\'ll never get it in your sights...  :)  Who needs
armor at that point (since no one would ever nuke you, that\'s _illegal_...  ;)

If I was going to be the "Devil\'s advocate", I\'d say that the limit was on the
inertial compensators, _not_ on the drive itself, and that this shouldn\'t apply
in a combat situation since TL-8 fighter pilots routinely pull multiple-G
maneuvers.  Add 6G of inertial compensation on top of a G-suit, and a 10-G 
turn is within the limits of a combat maneuver, I think.

I think that this has even more bearing on TNE, since (as I understand things)
M-Drive is no longer the thrust-plate/reactionless model from classic-trav or
MT.

Thoughts?

I know.  However, T:TNE seems to consider TEDs important (probably
because the TED code indicates "Opportunity for Player Characters to
Engage in Officially Sanctioned Excessive Violence Against Generally
Inferior Opposition" for Star Viking players).  My fix preserves (at
least IMHO) the intent of the rules on pp.191, but without requiring
double definitions for te Government type codes.

After I folded Tribal and the two Mystic governments into the existing
codes, that left the TEDs.  Since they are important to T:TNE, I needed
to put the code somewhere, so I put it in the Allegiance.  That left
nothing in the UWP Government code.  One possibility is to code all of
these worlds as type 6 (Captive Government) and leave it up to the
referee.   I should note that you are still free to do this.

On the other hand, as you pointed out, many different kinds of
governments can be TEDs.  Pavabid came to my mind also (that\'s the world
from the "Divine Intervention" Classic Traveller Double Adventure).
Others are certainly possible; however I have noted that T:TNE tends to
assume that TEDs are typically Non-Charismatic Leaders.  To make the
different government types explicit, and as an aid to the referee\'s
imagination, I provided the TED Government Table. 

I ranked the various governments by my estimation of their
probability of becoming a TED, and filled in the table accordingly.  A
large majority of them will be Non-Charismatic Leaders or Totalitarian
Oligarchies, but there is always the possibility of others, all of which
seem at least possible to me.  Some of them could lead to some very
interesting adventures for Star Vikings that don\'t do their homework and
undercover work.

I restricted myself to fixing up the Government codes, so that the one
"Normal" government code table could be used everywhere.  I very
carefully preserved everything else in the original T:TNE rules;
including Law Level.  If you look carefully, when all the appropriate
modifiers have been added, the roll on original pp.191 will be 2d6+3.

This doesn\'t mean that it\'s right, but simply that my modification only
affects the government code value used (and the allegiance, for TEDs)
and doesn\'t change anything else.

One possible interpretation: the TED\'s law level is that which applies
to strangers, and/or near the TED, with the rest of the world enjoying a
lower (possibly much lower) law level.

People have been talking about the sports played by the denizens of
the Trav universe.  Lessee what I got here.

Games Aliens Play:

The most common K\'kree game played while aboard their large field
sized ships is the ever popular sport of G\'kring.  It is initiated
by either the ship\'s captain or the steppelord aboard and allows
the entire compliment to enjoy themselves as they pass in
procession all behind the steppelord.  The human name for the game
is `Follow The Leader\'.

Another popular game among K\'kree is G\'nare.  It is very similar to
the ancient game of Polo before the British civilized it.  However,
it is not played with the decapitated head of an executed enemy,
but with a small live carnivorous animal as the `ball\'.  Should an
animal actually manage to survive the actual playing of the game it
is usually trampled by the steppelord of the winning team to
celebrate the victory.
     There is an growing trade between the Two Thousand Worlds and
human space in domestic house cats.
     There are rumors of games of G\'nare played by the K\'kree
soldier caste which use humans or vargr as the `ball\'.

The Hivers play many types of sports.  However, they do not
translate well into human concepts.  One (probably very
misunderstood) sport is referred to as `Very Small\' or `Pee Wee\'
which plays off the innate Hiver curiosity.  It consists of one
Hiver attracting the attention of another and directing him to face
in a certain direction.  The first player then signs `Made ya
look!\' to which the second player responds `I meant to do that.\'
     A variant of this is where one player intimates that he has
some secret knowlege and the other asks what it is.  (There is
untranslated illustration of two Hiver\'s playing this game in an
old JTAS cartoon "Our Friends The Aliens" :-)
     1st Player:  `Know what?\'
     2nd Player:  `What?\'
     1st Player:  `That\'s What!\'

The Ael Yael having evolved to flying many millenia ago have many
aerial games.  Many of which have been adapted to zero-G
environment.  Possibly the most well known of these is Yelachek.
     Yelachek actually is an aerial form of dueling similar to the
honor duels of the Aslan.  It can range in severity from first
blood or even to the death.  However, far more common is a contest
with streamers.
     The Ael Yael will tie streamers to their tails and fly passes
at each other while attempting to catch hold of the other\'s
streamer.  This gives a slight advantage to the smaller and more
maneuverable males of the species, but the females tend to use
their greater mass for speed in a dive.  Humans may compete in a
game by using grav belts.
     Yelachek as played in zero-G takes place in a large chamber to
allow maneuverability.  Humans will use large fans and flippers to
allow them to `fly\' slowly with swimming motions while pursuing
each other.

The Zhodani have a zero-G sport played soully by Telekinetics.
Telekinesis does not ordinarily give enough force to allow the psi
to push against gravity enough to allow flight.  Zero-G eliminates
this problem.  The telekinetics will use their psi to push off of
the walls of the chamber (or ship) in order to fly.  This allows
the TK\'s to fly, race, and indulge in all manner of aerial
maneuvers.

Fusion Rockets are in.

Well Ladies and Gents, you all outta know what that means.  The

engines here are those of the type S scout ship or the old type A
free trader.  These engines have about 1300 tons of thrust.  What
earthly rocket engines compare?  Well, that\'s about half as much
thrust as NASA\'s Saturn V (First stage) launch vehicle which took
the Astronauts to the moon.

I seem to recall a description of the Saturn V lift off as being
along the lines of "The Saturn V didn\'t lift off:  Cape Kennedy
Sank!"

I think Bertil & Wildstar are getting Far more complicated and
expensive than they have to with their missile seeker heads.
Passive is THE way to go.

Decoys will NOT be practical.  In order to copy the IR signature
you will need something as bright as a Saturn V.  In order to copy
the plasma jet you will need something hotter than a Saturn V.  In
order to copy the mass signature, you\'ll need some weird grav
equipment.  In order to copy the neutrino signature, you will need
a fusion reactor.

The only practical decoy that could copy the signature of a ship
well enough to fool the sensors and missile programming is...
another SHIP!

Ok, what counter measures can you pull against a missile with a
totally passive seeker head?

Well, you would have to turn to face it head on.  Using the bulk of
the ship to shield it\'s own engine emmissions.  This maneuver will
be almost completely impossible due to the closing vectors.  Also
you would have to know the precise location of the missile (at
which point you may as well shoot at it).  Furthermore, it will
only protect you from one missile.  If there is more than one
missile coming at you and they are in communication with each
other, it will fail.  Flying into the sun will present similar
problems.  The vectors almost certainly won\'t add and a bit of
programming should allow the head to distinguish between a ship and
a star.  Thus all you will need is a passive IR head.

Ok, what if he cuts his engines at a critical moment and causes the
missile to loose it\'s lock?  Well, a ship that is not maneuvering
is an easily found ship.  You already saw it\'s last vector!
KaBoom!

All right, now that you have this baby closing in, what do you
need?  A proximity fuse.  Well, you can use a densiometer to do
that if the IR has gone off line.  I\'d prefer to avoid using an
active radar as a fuse.  It would make the missile easier to find,
and it can be fooled by a chaff cloud (Sand Caster).

In my opinion, a totally passive head will be VERY effective
against TNE Ships.  IR, Neutrino, Densiometer combination will be
EXTREMELY hard to beat.  Furthermore, the Neutrino and Densiometer
are just icing on the cake.  The main component needed is that IR
head.  And remember, that\'s just a plain old TL6 seeker.  We are
talking about a heavy version of the AIM-9 Sidewinder here!

Also, Bertil mentioned the idea of rolling bombs off the loading
bay manually to attack undefended targets.  Why get so complicated?
Strapped to the back end of your ship is the biggest bad-assed
version of a fusion gun you ever imagined.  We are talking about a
fusion gun that has a back blast like a SATURN V for heavens sake!

   I expect they would be as effective as the former anti-grav was - air
resistance affected them as well.

   He had separate lift and drive generators, I beleive.  I don\'t recall any
details on thier operation ever being written.  I\'m certain they were not
reaction based.

   Not really.  If you are using reaction mass to move about, there are
strict limits to how much you can change velocity.


   For my own use, I\'m thinking of staying with my current usage of
thruster-plates for common use, and fusion rockets where high delta-v/t is
needed.  The thought of the common-folk running about riding oversized fusion
guns is frightening. :)

True enough, although to detect one at any range, you will need an
increasingly large telescope.  Those range bands are *big*!  For a sense
of scale, imagine trying to detect that Saturn V first stage with the
naked eye from the surface of the moon.

I think that we\'re now assuming some unspecified form of autonomous
terminal homing; passive IR, Neutrino, or Densitometer are all possible.
Missiles will want long-range targetting information (particularly SIMs)
from the launching ship, so that the missile can be guided to the
correct target if there are several near the same bearing.

> Ok, what counter measures can you pull against a missile with a

Well, you can shoot at it.  It probably has a fusion rocket for power,
too, and should be pretty darn obvious.  Lasers are the obvious choice,
but a Cannister missile should do a number on an enemy missile, too.
Delay detonation of the bursting charge until about 1.5s before impact;
this gives a 200m radius sphere with considerably more pellets per unit
volume.  1.5s doesn\'t give a 12G missile enough time to get out of the
way.

A small fission or fusion warhead should provide an adequate decoy,
depending on the exact technology of the seeker head.  The bomb could be
radiation-enhanced in the appropriate frequencies to better simulate the
ship\'s fusion exhaust.  This may not be a practical suggestion, however!
;)

Great.  And I see that KEAP now becomes a cheap missile (if a little
difficult to hit with) that is more effective in ship-to-ship action
than a HE missile, and considerably cheaper than a HEAP or SFF missile.

I think a 1:100 penetrator would be too slender; Uranium isn\'t a
particularly strong metal ... and it makes a decent reason for not
having a KEAPDU missile.

Sounds reasonable.

Good Idea!  MFDs at the current TL restricted to military vessels. 
Authorized para-military outfits (like starmercs with good reputations)
could buy MFDs at a couple of TLs below the current military.  And a few
(*very few*) would appear on the black market (probably the same TLs or
slightly lower as the starmercs can get).

An unauthorized ship with a MFD installed, or with restricted weapons
onboard, could be subject to immediate impound, or even seziure, by the
authorities.  I like this.

Ok, so I exaggerated a bit.  But remember, from Earth to the Moon is
15 range bands or so.  So we\'re both exaggerating.

True.  But those options work just as well against an active missile
or a command guided variety.

Practicality aside, I don\'t think it would work.  How long does a nuclear
warhead last?  If it Could simulate the target ship\'s signature, it
wouldn\'t do it for long!  :-)

This last seems to imply that you think I am running a New Era
campaign.  Not Hardly!  And I am not too likely to do so in the near
future (say before the turn of the century), nor is it likely that
if/when I get around to a New Era campaign that my "New Era" will occur
in/around 1200 - more like 1500...

I exhausted the possibilities inherent in the New Era while reading (and
laughing at) the two canned adventures (incidently, Loren, Cynthia and I
cracked the cypher in the first adventure while sitting around waiting
for my daughter\'s ballet class to end.  So how come the PCs are expected
to be unable to crack it without being given the key?), and can see no
real point in role-playing the New Era, since I have little if any
interest in beating up technological inferiors (though I concede I might
enjoy a game of beating up on the Arses), and even less in being a
peasant or TED i some backwater....

  They sound logical. If the opportunity occurs, I\'ll try them out this Sunday.

  Addenda on missiles:

  A missile launcher on any ship that hasn\'t been purpose built to have a 
missile launcher on that specific hardpoint (like the patrol cruiser) will
probably have to be reloaded from *outside* the ship. If we assume that same
density of the starship missiles as of the tac missiles (1) the missiles
will be 7 cubic meters big. That probably translates to something a little
over a meter in diameter and 7 meters long. That comparable to a extended
range Standard Missile, and considerably thicker.
  There is no way you can maneuver this monster around in a scout ship, so
the launcher has to be reloaded from the outside when the ship is not in
combat.

  Ok, but what are the equivalent numbers for hydrogen/oxygen or NERVA-type
nuclear fission rockets?

  And (nasty question) what are the equivalent numbers for a fusion rocket
powered missile? :)

It would be nice, but I didn\'t have the canonical list of government
codes, so I had to solve the problem without creating a new government
type code.

Also, I\'m not convinced that a TED is really anything different than a
lot of Non-Charismatic Leaders, Totalitarian Oligarchies, Religous
Dictators/Oligarchies, and Feudal Technocracies that we had in the
Classic Imperium.  It\'s just that instead of "Governments will be
Governments" the attitude towards them is "It\'s Clobberin\' Time!".  Or
in other words, what makes a TED is in the eyes of the beholder, and not
necessicarily a characteristic of the government.

As an example, note the description of Montezuma starting on T:TNE
pp.98; the narrator herself notes that the world\'s government is not
particularly ornerous (but comments that *in her opinion* it may become
so at some future time); the farmers are not yet peasants, there is
currently a merchant class, and the world enjoys offworld trade on what
seems to be a regular (if infrequent) basis.  But the RCES seems to
have decided that the world is a TED, and that they\'re going to liberate 
the not-yet-peasants from their not-yet-masters!

  I include the trade classifications area and the alliegance field in \'basic
world data\'. It\'s when one has to go to another sheet of paper that it gets
onerous.

> But the RCES seems to

  At least in the case of the areas surrounding the RC, we might assume that
any teddy mark in the world lists is a statement by the RCES giving any
official or quasi-official party an \'open season\' on the government and that
the mark in the world list reflects a current or future RCES classification,
just like the Amber and Red zones were classifications actually issued by TAS
reflecting their judgement and info about interdictions, instead of \'just\'
a game-mechanic.

  It is like a \'most favoured nation\' status in reverse. \'Government Non Grata\',
\'Hunting Licence\'.

  (to the tune or \'run wabbit\')

  "Run teddy! Run teddy! 
   run! run! run!
   Here comes the RCES\'s with
   guns! guns! guns!"

   (Howabout that Scott?:)

  Now this system might be abused in several ways. The threat of being \'teddy
marked\' might be wielded by those who hold the power against individual
worlds in various nefarious ways. I can think of several plots resulting from
this.
  
  TED\'s away from the RCES\'s area of influence are more problematic. Either we
have to trace the word from a commonly known pre-virus source (Ililek Kuligaan
perhaps predicted them and called them TED\'s, or TED is a word used by 
historians describing similar phenomenas during the Long Night) or say that
"Teddy marking means that the RCES would regard the world as being under the
 control of a TED if they had known about it."

Well, they were bloody cheap in Trav.  1000 Cr for a densiometer, and

Actually, not many TL3 Naval guns could elevate that well...  But my
guess is that the plasma plume of the engines is going to be equivalent
to a HEAVY fusion gun with a range of several kilometers.  If it isn\'t
then I\'d imagine a bit of fooling with the drives could make it at LEAST
as effective as an FGMP-15 or so...  And don\'t forget:  The old FGMP
had about as much firepower as a 12"  High velocity naval gun...  :-)

  What I ment was that the ship, by varying the CG (there already is a 
detectable gravitation fiddling inside it: the inertial compensators and 
artificial gravitation) against the gravitation of a large body could vary
its vector in an undetectable way.

  Remember that the new fusion and plasma rifles have a range of up to 70m,
and they use a laser to prep the way of the plasma bolt. Without the laser
\'the plasma bolt dissipates far too quickly\'.

Nonsense.  Or are you silly enough to believe that the penetrator MUST
be as long as the missile is?  Put a 400Kg 1:20 penetrator in the
missile, so what if it is short?

(assuming the same 150Kg dry mass)

H2-O2:  1 G-hour: 381,000Kg fuel.

I guesstimated an Isp of 2,000,000 based on the minimum from the three
ship types I bothered to check on, which ranged from 2,000,000 to just
over 3,000,000.

1 G-hour: 265 GRAMS.
2 G-hour: 530 GRAMS.

Presumably, the missile would not have quite so efficient (read:
EXPENSIVE) a drive as a ship though.  But it\'ll still be trivial...

Exactly why I ALREADY despise the Arses.  Note that in the first of the
canned adventures, the PCs are hired by the Arses to bring down a Church
and a TED.

The Church is described as one of which the Arses know "not a lot", but
"the Church does a lot of good by the way.  Their hospitals and clinics
take care of the sick..." and "the Church considers itself a force for
justice, and often has been successful in moderating the worst excesses
of local warlords...".  This is described as "the bad news", and the PCs
are sent off to bring this Church down, and the local governments with
them.

I mean, are these guys GREAT examples of HEROES, and GOOD GUYS, or
what???

I forgot to comment on the conclusion someone drew that the fusion driv

This is hardly a trivial matter.  ANd really renders everyone\'s objections to
PCs with nukes pretty trivial.  After all, the 500T of TNT equivalent in a
det-laser is pretty trivial next to the 30,000T of TNT equivalent of even a
small, wimpy drive.  Per second.  Call it 3MT of damage to wherever it took off
from.  Like the TED\'s palace.  Or pretty much anywhere else that offended you.

So stop wasting time babbling about TRIVIA like those det-laser missiles.  If
you really want to disarm your PCs, start by preventing them from getting 
their hands on a ship of any kind....

    'body' => 'OK.  Several people have commented on high-G craft.  Let\'s make some
assumptions:

1) 6G is the upper limit that the inertial compensators can cope with.
1A) I personally think that it\'s closer to 7G, since on ships with the deck
    perpendicular to the plane of travel, 6G of compensation is in effect,
    along with 1G of artificial Gravity.  (make sense?)
2) Personnel equiped with G suits and suitably trained can _probably_ withstand
   9Gs on top of that for a _critical_ maneuver.
3) I\'m pretty sure that G suits compensate well in the 4G range for the length
   of a typical TL-8 dogfight.
3A) I would imagine that _most_ of a 30 minute turn is spent in "non-combat"
    with perhaps 10% in actual combat/evaisive maneuvers.  (reasonable?)
4) Most non-miltary craft won\'t want to dedicate the maintenance that\'s
   required to keep things from flying all over the place in a
   non-G-compensated environment.

Given the above, it seams reasonable that it should be possible to build/fly
a 10G military (or paramilatary) craft.  It would accelerate at 6G for purposes
of in-system movement (maybe 7, given assumption 1A, maybe 8, if the pilot\'s
willing to put up with 2G for a while); but (depending on its agility) have 
substantial DMs on the chance to hit it in combat.  (Is agility retained in 
TNE?)

I chose 10G as pushing the limits of a pilot\'s endurance during a prolonged
encounter.  Shorter-order work could probably push 14 or 15G.  The 10G craft
could probably push 19G in a dense atmosphere if it was fitted with control
surfaces, but who\'d want to do that?  %)

If one assumes that 4X overdrive is used regularly, then the DMs become much
less substantial (but so does the cost.)  I\'d still do it, just for that extra
edge...

Is 6G the maximum that the compensators can handle?  (Loren?)
Tossing assumption 1 opens a great big can-o-worms.  :)

On the subject of games:  Did anybody ever play grav-ball?  It was published
about 8-10 years ago.  It even came with its own 15mm lead figures mounted on
little stands.  As I remember, it was sort of like full-contact soccer (except
that you could use your hands.)  The ball was a 10KG steel bearing.  Different
positions had differing amounts of armor (Goalie had the most  :)  All played
in a zero-G arena.  Fun stuff.  Easy to re-do for Trav.  Multi-racial, even.

On coffee: It\'s notoriously fickle regarding where it will grow, and how it
tastes depends a great deal on the conditions that it was grown in.  I can see
the coffee houses of the (Post)Imperium now, 3100 flavors at your beck-and-call

Well, let me give you a quick basic rocketry tour.
Delta-V (change in velocity) can be found in any rocket
by looking at the following formula:
DelV=g*Isp*ln(Mr)

DelV is change in velocity in m/s
g is gravity, 9.81 (say 10)
Isp is specific impulse, the measure of how long the fuel can provide
	a given thrust
Mr is the mass ratio (initial mass plus fuel mass over initial mass) of the
	stage as a whole.

Say we have a vehicle whose mass ratio is e (2.78ish), so ln(Mr) is about 1 .
That means that the delta-V in m/s is about 10 times the specific impulse.
(To be realistic, the limiting maximum delta-V is about 1.5 times this without
staging, and tends to be about 1.2 times that much).

Hydrogen/Oxygen current day engines max out at Isp of 454 (Space SHuttle
Main ENgines).  THat gives you about 4.5 km/sec per stage, max maybe
7 km/sec per stage.  (A LOX/LH2 Single Stage to Orbit is _just_ possible
on the earth).

One G-hour is 3600 sec * 10 m/s is 36 km/sec.  You\'d need roughly an
eight stage rocket using LOX/LH2 to make a g-hour (which equals a mass
ratio from start to finish of about 4^8 or 65,500ish.  Or 9.8 million kg
for the 150kg payload.  A bit bigger than a Saturn V (ten times as large).

NERVA motors have perhaps Isp of 1000, up to 1100 in really far out
designs.  Assuming 1000, that gives you per-stage a delta-V or 10 km/sec,
so you need 3 or 4 stages to reach 1 g-hour.  Maybe a beginning to end
ratio of 100, or 15,000 kg for your 150 kg payload.

Known fusion rocket technologies are around Isp 5,000.  This gives you
a stage delta-V of 50 km/sec, or a little over one g-hour.  This means
a 10-G hour rocket (360 km/sec) needs a seven-stage rocket.  Again,
that\'s about 2 million kg initial mass.  About the mass of a Frigate
on the sea today.  I guess TNE presumes they get better as technology
marches on 8-)

The hottest rocket around (literally) is the Nuclear Salt Water Rocket
(proposed by Dr. Robert Zubrin of Martin Marietta Aerospace).
Basically, you disolve uranium or plutonium salts in water,
store them in a heavily-internally-shielded tank, and spray them 
into a nozzle where the amount of fuel finally reaches critical
mass and they go FIZZ!.  Specific impulse is about 10,000 for
Uranium, or 15,000 for Plutonium.  That gives for a one-stage
rocket about 100 km/sec to 150 km/sec, or 3 to 5 g-hours.
So you can build a two or three stage nuclear salt water rocket
that will reach 10 to 12 g-hours and is compatable with the
missiles given in TNE.  That missile will mass about 200*150 or
30000 kg, or 30 tons.  More than TNE posits.

I don\'t know what TNE posits their motors have as specific impulse.
I\'ll try to work it out over the weekend.

sigh.  *shakes head*  I\'m all done now.  Back to work...

I kind of like this; this means that most serious battles will take
place around planets, which makes a lot of sense.  The problem with
space is that it\'s too bloody large and empty.  I have a really hard
time seeing any two ships getting together for a fight unless they
*both* maneuver to meet, or one side has an immense advantage in speed
and maneuverability.  This means that the preliminary to combat would
be maneuvering to gain advantage of position around a planet, which
also happens to be the best place to have a chance of avoiding attacks
- -- otherwise you get a mutual kill.

Note that the impossibility of avoiding a missile works against the
missile - since the missile itself can be tracked and defeated with
lasers or counter-missiles in much the same way.  I would imagine
technologies would be developed to take advantage of this.

There\'s also the potential for coasting missiles; the missiles would
go "dead" for a large part of their flight and hope to avoid detection
until they go active close enough to (hopefully) get in before
defenses could defeat them.  If this tactic were extended to ships, I
imagine space battles would look much like submarine combat...

In reference to detecting contragravity, I suspect that stealth
contragravity technologies would be developed; technologies to hide or
disguise the detectable emissions.

Only sort of.  My first and most fundamental assumption is that the
atomic explosion can be treated as a point source of radiation.  While
this is certainly a good working approximation at most scales, it is
certainly *not* true at other scales.  10m might be pushing it.

Out at 10km, a notional 50-displacement-ton sphere (radius 5.5m,
cross-sectional area 95m^2) should intercept about 76 *billionths* of
the energy output by the bomb; assuming that the inverse-square law
holds down to 10m, then at that range the ship is getting nearly 8% of
the output of the bomb.

Closer than that, I don\'t even want to guess; of course at contact the
ship will get nearly 50% of the bomb\'s output.  It seems to me that
"proximity" for nukes is so close that it\'s effectively "contact",
except for impractically large weapons, of course.

So a nuclear anti-ship missile is effectively a contact weapon, probably
with a warhead around 1kt.  And of course, it\'s also useful agains
planetary targets.

Maybe one difficulty level harder per 2g max accelleration over 6g?
Assuming a maximum of 15g (or 9g overthrust), this would work out to a
maximum of four difficulty levels harder (some of which could, of
course, be avoided by a MFD.  Still, this should make fighters pretty
hard to hit.

Bertil and I [wildstar] have been having a discussion about world
government codes, based in the "fix" I did to the T:TNE world generation
for the Wilds (T:TNE pp.191).  The following is most of that discussion,
edited into a conversational format.  We\'d be interested in hearing your
comments on this.

[Lines which begin B: are Bertil talking, and W: indicates me]

B: IMHO it is good to have the info in the basic world data somewhere, instead
B: of having to scan through the extra data for each world to find it.
B: I include the trade classifications area and the alliegance field in \'basic
B: world data\'. It\'s when one has to go to another sheet of paper that it gets
B: onerous.

W: Oh, sorry.  I thought you were complaining about my modification
W: (instead, I guess you were complaining about the original T:TNE rules).

B: [About the "TED" code]
B: At least in the case of the areas surrounding the RC, we might assume that
B: It is like a \'most favoured nation\' status in reverse. Government Non Grata,
B: or \'Hunting Licence\'.

W: That\'s what I would assume, too.

B:   Now this system might be abused in several ways. The threat of being \'teddy
B: marked\' might be wielded by those who hold the power against individual
B: worlds in various nefarious ways. I can think of several plots resulting from
B: this.

W: This is a good idea, and a lot more
W: interesting that the usual RCES "Which TED will we Smash This Week"
W: adventure!

B: [About the "TED" code in areas away from RCES activity]
B: "Teddy marking means that the RCES would regard the world as being under the
B:  control of a TED if they had known about it."

W: That\'s probably reasonable.  And most expansion-minded polities are
W: going to have a similar label for similar worlds.  In order to expand at
W: the maximum rate, a polity will need access to all of the resources and
W: (particularly) pre-Collapse equipment and information possible.
W: TED-like governments will be in the way, and the most expeditious means
W: of removing the obstacle will be to stomp them flat.


B: Btw: regarding government codes, the way I\'m reading the rules suggests that
B: we will be up to our sensor-clusters in balcanized worlds, so how about
B: marking them too in the trade field?

B: Thus a balcanized world where gov 9 is most common would be marked:
B:   Gov: 7 and in the trade field "B9"
B: And a similar one where the typical noncharismatic TED is the most common:
B:   Gov: 7 and in the trade field "B6 TB"
B: And a noncharismatic TED world (for completeness sake:)
B:   Gov: 6 and in the trade field "TB"

W: OK.  But how about using "B:9" or "B:6" to visually distinguish it from
W: the other codes that are in that field; two letter codes (of the form
W: "Cp", or "Ag") indicate trade classifications.  Letter and number codes
W: ("A5", "C0", or "D1"), or preferably Letter Colon Number codes ("A:5",
W: "C:0", or "D:1") indicate racially mixed populations.  And finally
W: "B:x" codes ("B:9" or "B:6") indicate the most common
W: government type on balkanized worlds.   There is also the "O:xxxx code,
W: which is used to indicate the ownership (hex number) of a Captive
W: world.

W: Finally, the TED code goes in the allegiance slot.   Since it can only
W: occurr in the wilds, the TED code won\'t ever conflict with an actual
W: allegiance (presumably once the world government becomes part of an
W: interstellar polity, it will no longer be "Government Non Grata" to that
W: polity).

W: SO: A balkanized world where the most common government is 9 would be
W: marked with a "B:9" in the trade classifications, and government type 7.
W: The (fairly common) balkanized world where the most common form of
W: government is a non-charismatic leader TED would have government type 7
W: in the UWP, "B:B" in the trade classifications, and "Td" in the
W: allegiance.  A non-charismatic leader TED world would have a government
W: type of B, and "Td" in the allegiance field.

W: As an alternative, all TED worlds could have government type 6 (with the
W: referee then responsible for deciding on what for the government should
W: have), in which case the latter two are (Gov=7, Trade=B:6, and Alleg=Td)
W: for the first case, and (Gov=6, Alleg=Td) for the second.

W: I\'m fairly ambivalent about spelling out the "most common" government
W: (and law, for that matter) codes for a balkanized world.  It is quite
W: possible that nearly any and every government type could be represented
W: on it.  I also still have mixed throughts about the "TED Government Type"
W: table I put in my update; as Steve points out, this is the province of
W: the referee as well.  Since I had to draw the line somewhere, I included
W: the TED government types, and didn\'t consider Balkanized world
W: government types.  I\'ll think about it some more, though.

B: Ok, I must admit that my main reason for wanting two-letter no colon codes
B: is that my program will barf at anything else. The only valid argument
B: against colons that I can find is that it will take more place.

B: What letters will be needed for races? I would guess A V H K (and perhaps
B: \'h:4\' for human minority worlds?) and a general code for minor races (M?).

B: Time for a page on \'the grammar of world data\' :)

W: (presumably once the world government becomes part of an
W: interstellar polity, it will no longer be "Government Non Grata" to that
W: polity).

B: He he he, and the cases where a polity declares a participant government 
B: GNG are plots to adventures. As are the cases where one polity declares an
B: ally of another to be a TED.

B: [on the two coding options above]
B: I don\'t know which version that is the most intuitive. I\'m leaning towards
B: the first (since the TED in the balcanized case is a secondary characteristic
B: it should logically be a subcase of the balcanized case)

B: I will probably treat the \'most common gov\' data as a recommendation to be
B: ignored at will by the referee if the plot demands it, as long as they can
B: justify it somehow.

B: For example, what is the most common government type on Terra in Real Life 
B: Right Now? Do we take the most common government by numbers of governments?
B: The government type that the most people live under? Or the government type
B: of the largest country? Largest by population or area? Or the gov of the most
B: powerful nation?

B: [on the whole idea of the "TED Government Type" table]
B: I\'d recommend keeping it (and the most common notation) but with an explicit
B: note that they are only there to serve as helps to the imagination of the 
B: referee (like it says somewhere in the TTNE) not as rreplacement of the 
B: same.

W: [on Bertil\'s program that can\'t handle 3-letter codes]
W: A valid reason; however *my* program can deal with either; it only adds
W: a little more code.  (suggestion: write a subroutine which parses the
W: string into "words" separated by white space: "procdeure wordscan(input:
W: string, wordnum : string) : string;" btw: No, I don\'t acutally use
W: Pascal, my programs are in Rexx, where such a function is a builtin).

W: The second concern is a little more real; I\'ve yet to run across a world
W: that currently exceeds the space provided, but is certainly possible
W: as we add more codes.

W: [on using "h:4" for human minority worlds]
W: I generally don\'t like to make case distinctions.  In *theory* the
W: current system is case-insensitive (as a matter of fact, I uppercase 
W: the UWP and Trade Classifications whenever they are used for
W: comparisons).

W: Another item: Traveller is very inconsistent about noting worlds with
W: non-human populations.  Native minor races often aren\'t noted in the
W: UWP at all, and it is either mentioned in the notes, or up to the
W: individual referee to determine this.  The only codes I\'ve ever noticed
W: with any consistency are C == Chirper and D == Droyne.

B: Time for a page on \'the grammar of world data\' :)

W: Definitely.  The O:xxxx code has been used for quite a while, (and is
W: acutally used in T:TNE), but isn\'t explained in the section on
W: world-building.

B:    He he he, and the cases where a polity declares a participant government 
B:  GNG are plots to adventures. As are the cases where one polity declares an
B:  ally of another to be a TED.

W: Yup.  You seem to have a talent for thinking up these twists ---- that\'s
W: the second one today that I wouldn\'t have thought of!

B: Perhaps we should bundle this discussion, edit some things out (like
B: ******************************* DELETED ****************************
B: and raspberry jello) and send to the TML?

W: Sounds like a good idea.  I\'ve been keeping copies of this, so I\'ll pull
W: it all together and send it to you for comment before I send it to TML.

  Now this is a problem.

  Ok, I\'d probably (in my campaing) say that it is a BAD IDEA to run
the main drive of a ship inside any atmosphere denser than code 1. And that
the drive has much too short range to be used in space combat unless you
manage to bluff your way in to 1km or less from the enemy.

  (So how do they reach orbit? Easy: CD plus *small* maneuver jets)

  Space stations and vaccum worlds will however be vulnerable, but they have
always been vulnerable.

  (Another thing that strikes me is that the reflected energy might be bad
for the ship. In space, everything goes away from the ship, so only the
actual engine nozzle or whatever needs to be able to withstand it. But if
you run it in air the air will form a nuke-type fireball *just aft of the 
drives* that will return entirely too much of the thermal radiation to your
ship. Likewise for hosing a space station at 200m)

  This is my first post to TML.  Damn, I wish I\'d known about it sooner.

Regarding the two different GOV codes, I agree it must be fixed.

To me, the simplest solution seems to be:

Modify the \'Wilds GOV\' table on page 191. Add another column.

The existing "Code" column is renamed "Roll"

The new column is "Code", and lists the standard UWP code for the
gov type listed.
                          
No Government              \\
Participating Democracy     |    
Representative Democracy    |   
Charismatic Dictatorship    |  All these have standard codes  
Charismatic Oligarchy       |   no further discusion required
Totalitarian Oligarghy      |  
Civil Service Bureaucracy   | 
Self-Perpetuating oligarchy | 
Impersonal Bureacracy      /

 Mystic Dictatorship \\  Read the description!
 Mystic Autocracy    / 

"Mystic" govs differ from "Religous" govs only with the (possible)
   addition of psionics.  In the anti-psi Imperium, psi mystics
   were suppressed.  This is no longer neccesarily the case.

The simplest patch is to rename "Religious..." govs with the 
   broader decription of "Mystic...", since the religious ones
   are simply a subset of the mystic ones.

Tribals and TEDs require a decision.

Solution A:

The Trade Class column has long been used as a sort of \'notes\',
ie. owner of captive govt, droyne pop percentage.

Designate "Tribal Gov\'t" as "Balkanized" (code 7) with the note
 \'TRB\' with the trade class

List TEDs as Non-charismatic Dictators (code B) with the note \'TED\'


Solution B:

A review of all GOV codings I can find shows:

0-F ----  Standard
G-N ----  Aslan Specific
P-R ----  K\'Kree Specific
S-W ----  Hiver Specific
 X  ----  Droyne Specific

I and O are ignored in the usual fashion.

Unless I\'m missing something, this leaves Y and Z available,
ignoring non-alphanumeric symbols (@,#,&,ect.) for real-world
publishing considerations.

Tribal is  \'Y\'

TED is \'Z\'

Easy as pie.

All notes on determining Wilds Gov stand, except if a TED, then
code for TED, and if balkanized, gov code is 7, "dominant" gov
is for whatever the GM wants for that world.


Let\'s get this cleared up _NOW_, while the only one table and
3 subsectors have to be corrected/clarified.

Hope I was helpful

I\'ve thunk. An it seems to me that what we really need is a couple of 
carefully tailored science-fictiony gimmicks to make things work out
properly. I\'m thinking about force fields and similar not-very-scientific
whatnots. Item: I don\'t want just any starship owner to be able to torch 
planets at will, yet we have these super blowtorches. Answer: Planetary
force screens. Item: I don\'t want ship combat to be simply a missile
counter-measure, counter-counter-measure oneupmanship, but with nuclear
missiles being capable of vapourising any concievable metal what can we
do? How about force screens that deflect 99% (or 99.9 or whatever is
needed) of even a contact explosion? Make the generators really expensive
and we solve the problem of making warships much more expensive than
merchant ships too.

Several people are interested in allowing combat G-ratings of at least 6G
above the base 6G that can be compensated.  All arguements have thus far
referred to aircraft pilots pelling 6-9G turns and such for short periods 
of time.

One thing perhaps overlooked is that all of your crew on a star vessel may
not be strapped into acceleration couches at the moment the pilot wants
the ship to dance on it\'s tail and flip out of harms way.  During combat
in space are we assuming that all crew are in G-suit equiped Vacc-suits
and remain in acceleration couches to do all their work?  Are acceleration
couches factored into crew space for all crew in starship construction
rules?

On another topic:

Anyone know what kill range you would have with a missile equiped with
an anti-matter warhead (either impact, proximity or 2300\'ish DET Laser)?

How can a missile with a small computer hit a fast ship with a large
computer when you factor in computer differences on the High Guard to-hit
tables etc.  Surely you can build ships that can\'t be hit especially
when you have self guiding missiles that don\'t use the firing ship\'s
computer rating.

Just got TNE from the local shop $49.95 on the shelf ($45 for me being a
regular customer) which is fairly cheap considering air mail costs and
the current US exchange rate.

        I don\'t follow this at all.  Perhaps you could explain?  It seems to
me that "real networks" (mass storage sharing, distributed computing) make
the spread of a virus far easier and eradicating it far hairier a job.

        Over on the tne-pocket echo we had a prolonged discussion of the
Virus, and what forms it might take.  If one extrapolates the current trend
in reprogrammable hardware (PLA, PAL, etc) to its logical extreme, and
assume that by the Imperial era, all high-tech computers consist of
self-configuring hardware that loads a "program" by rewiring its own logic...
Such a technology is tailor-made for the Virus as described.
        As it is, in the real world (tm), I shudder to think what is going
to happen when some malicious soul writes a virus that hooks into Flash BIOS.
There are gonna be a lot of unhappy customers with dead 486 boxes and trashed
disks...
(Making your BIOS rewritable is a really stupid security hole... not that DOS
has any security whatsoever.)
        BTW, I sensibly assume that Impy computers have some built-in security
provisions to keep any hacker from telling your main defense computer to
reconfigure itself into 3000 microwave oven controllers.. but one of the
major threats of the Virus is that it is the ultimate hacker, and
knowledge of how to crack a given system type is inherited by its children.

I hate to burst peoples\' bubbles, but *no* HE or HEAP missiles will be
used in ship to ship combat.

There are 3 velocities one has to consider:

1. closing velocity
2. the velocity at which the *kinetic* energy of 1 kilo of *anything*
   exceeds the energy release by detonating 1 kilo of your best high
   explosive.
3. detonating velocity. This is the speed at which a detonation wave
   propogates thru a high explosive.

I can just about *guarantee* that detonating velocity is *far* below
closing velocity. Which means that shaped charges are useles, as the
missile impact will be moving faster than the detonation of the
explosive. This kills HEAP and doesn\'t  help HE much either.

And I\'m willing to bet that velocity #2 is below closing velocity in
most cases as well. Which again makes HE a waste of time!

I suggest that when evaluating kinetic kill weapons for use against
ships, you look into the studies done on protection against meteorites.
You *don\'t* want heavy armor. You want something thin and replaceable.
The idea is that small objects will vaporize themselves and a portion of
the foil shield, but that there\'s enough space between the "foil" and
the real hull that the fireball won\'t contact it.

This only helps for projectiles rather smaller than we\'d be using. So
you are going to have the "cannister" projectiles "cratering" the hull.
And if they punch through, they\'ll either create one *hell* of a shock
wave in the atmosphere of the ship, or keep punching holes in anything
that gets in their way until they are slowed to  bullet velocities, or
have completely vaporized.

Your several inches of armor could result in *more* damage than an
*unarmored* vessel would recieve, simply because more of the projectiles
KE would be transferred to the vessel!

Also check the railgun studies. I seriously doubt that the tank studies
apply when dealing with projectiles that are several orders of
magnitude faster *and* several orders of magnitude heavier. The railgun studies are getting into the low end of the velocity range. Only studies of meteor craters deal with KE values we have here.

*Very* rough calculations follow based on the estimated energy release
that created the Barringer Crater in Arizona, and the cube-root-of power
crater size formula. (Barrinnger Crater is 1.2 km in dia, and estimated that it took 7.1e22 ergs to create)

For a 5 ton projectile,

V (g-hr) (m/sec)   KE(ergs) (% of BC) kilotons   diameter(meters)

  47.8  168.522e3  7.1e22    100       1.7 MT      1200   :-)

These figures should give an idea of just what sort of forces we are
discussing. No *possible* chemical explosive will even be noticed in
this sort of energy release.

BTW, for a 5 *gram* projectile, we get 1 millionth the energy, or
1/100th the diameter. So change the diameters above to cm. Which means
that 5 gm  projectile (a BB) at the veocity give by a mere 1 g for 1
hour, will blast a 91 cm crater in solid rock. And likely do something
similar im armor.  How many 5 gm BBs can a 7 ton missile carry and how
large a volume will they fill at "optimum" dispersal?

This may seem extreeme for a "mere" 7/10ths of a kilo of TNT equivalent.
But don\'t forget that is has a *much* higher brisance and is
concentrated on a *much* smaller area.

(and 5 kilo projectiles are 1/1000th energy and the craters are 1/10th
the size :-)

It\'s really fascinating reading this, after listening to all of you

drives would be MUCH better, and more realistic...

Why should it be bad???  Your reasoning is specious, as can be seen by
looking at pictures of any Saturn launch.  The blast punches DOWN! 
Hard!  Way too hard for anything trivial like atmosphere to slow it
down.  It only takes about 0.0025 seconds for the blast to reach from
50,000 meters to ground level.  Even at mind-boggling pressures, it
isn\'t going to spread much till it hits ground ("not much" means that it
should still be focused on an area no more than 10Km across...).

Probably use Scramjets, just like we used to do back in original Trav
when we first started playing many years ago...

ALL worlds are vulnerable!  Every last one of them!

DREAM ON, Bertil!  Look at a REAL rocket launch!  MUCH lower exhaust
velocity, MUCH lower pressures, and they DO _NOT_ form fireballs - they
form long tongues af flame.  Which this will do as well.  Only this will
make them longer, hotter, FAR more lethal!

MORE loud laughter!

Hans, sounds like you REALLY want to play the Star Wars RPG, not
Traveller.  And aren\'t you one of the guys who used to say rude things
about grav, and wish for realistic fusion drives?


Quite frankly, I am pretty disgusted by the fact that everyone seems
willing to change the "laws of the universe" rather than face up to the
situation presented, and learn to live with it.  If you use the starship
rules ("laws of nature") from TNE, you have to learn to deal with the
fact that ANY ship can toast ANY city (well, any city at TL12-, and most
any at TL14-).
	So what does that mean?  Well, landing ships should be RIGHT OUT! 
Allowing a fusion gun that size near ANY city is INSANE!  So ships
should be docking at space stations FAR from a planet (like
geostationary orbit, for instance.  That gives the planetary defenses
time to scrag anyone who deviates from traffic corridors toward the
planet).  You should LAND in shuttles that have ONLY scramjet/chemical
rocket drives (getting up and down will be pretty damn tricky.  Sort of
like 2300AD).
	Of course, out in the Wilds, there is NO WAY IN HELL that you can
keep PCs (OR NPCS!!!!!) from landing anywhere they like, and toasting
anyone they dislike!  So live with it.  Or stop complaining, and go back
to Megatraveller starship rules (yeah, the ones most of you have spent
YEARS complaining about)!  And remember this the next time you decide to
cry out for "more realistic starship rules".

Loud laughter fading into the distance....

   The game had:

- -- one module even had an experimental AI running a \'vampire\' base

I tried to account for this in my last post, but you stated it much more
clearly here.  In order for the designs that I was proposing to work, "all crew
are in G-suit equiped Vacc-suits and remain in acceleration couches to do all
their work.  Acceleration couches would be factored into crew space for all
crew."

This would be much easier to design/implement in the smaller non-starships
(like fighters/cutters/SDBs) than in (for instance) a 20,000 ton cruise-ship.
I\'d envisioned squadrons of highly maneuverable fighters swarming around the
other more lumbering ships in the arena.  It\'d have a very Star-Wars like
feel to it, I think.  Of course, a zippy ship with a Meson gun has advantages
too.  (I think the trade-off in crew-space would account for large portion of
armor, especially if you can only be hit on a rolled 12 [or better ;)  .])  

Nukes in space trash my original hypothesis, though.  I guess that\'s where
nuclear dampers come into play.

I guess I\'m approaching this from High-Guard\'s POV, since that\'s what I\'m
most familiar with.

  Yikes! Force fields as a \'every ships item\' in Traveller. Somehow that
idea does not excite me.

  I think "BAD IDEA to run the fusion drive in an atmopshere and BAD IDEA
to run it within a km or three from a solid object" takes care of this. 

  Possible holes: Vacuum worlds, \'Suicide ships\', and the rockets in missiles:

  Hole one does IMHO not need to be plugged. It has been noted in several
canonic sources that they *are* intensely vulnerable, so this won\'t change 
anything.

  Hole two is made a little smaller by that ships are expensive, even more in
TNE and the trouble in arranging a remote control or whatnot, and the remainder
of it does not need to be plugged, since you can (probably) get the same 
effects by blowing the powerplant.

  Hole three is plugged with doubletalk (but not as bad doubletalk as 
cheap, common and generally magic \'force fields\':). Like Steve has shown, the
engines on missiles are much smaller (and much less effective) than the 
ship drives.
  Presumably the missile engines are related to the maneuver jets of the
ships, and since the \'BAD IDEA\' idea needs that the maneuver jets are usable
in the atmosphere without any major bad effects, missile engines behave 
similarily.

> Item: I don\'t want ship combat to be simply a missile
> counter-measure, counter-counter-measure oneupmanship, but with nuclear

  The enthusiasm over the missiles may have given the wrong impression but
at medium ranges, against any vessel with a energy weapon, the missiles are
IMHO balanced wrgt the other starship weapons: This is mostly because you
can shoot them down *at any point of their journey*, and this translates
to several times during a \'typical missile journey\'.

  (Wonder if the sandcaster can be used against the laser from the nuke/laser
missiles...)

  Missiles that has to come into a few km or less of the target should be 
even easier to shoot down, say a final round of fire at -1 difficulty. That
will translate to:
  Asset 10, At short range the basic hit task is Average. No range mod, 
Submicro size +1 diff (Difficult), Extra close -1 diff (Average, aka 20 in
this case).

  Hmm, I think I\'ve changed opinion again: To avoid making the class 2+
missiles totally worthless, there should *not* be an \'Extra Close -1 diff\'
mod.

  So the way missiles should be used is in overwhelming waves at close range.
Most ships can\'t accomplish this, so for them all missiles are significantly
inferior to energy weapons unless against inferior targets.

  It is possible that I\'ve missed it, but I haven\'t seen one mention that 
the computer does anything to help combat in TNE (other than \'being there\', 
if it ceases to \'be there\' there are various negative effects as detailed
in the part on starship damage:)

  The important stats are the ranges of the weapons, the skills of the gunners
and the TL of the MFC if any. The computer does not figure in like it did in
HG.

  Evasive maneuvers and the skill of the pilot make a difference in two ways.
First of all it makes the hit tasks more difficult, and second, if you have
a suitable vector, you can outrun a missile pretty easily.

  (And for the noncanonical contact missiles, the acceleration of the ship
comes into play in that the missile has to be able to intercept it inside
the same range band. If it doesn\'t have enough fuel to do this, the target
can just thumb it\'s nose at it when it goes tumbling by into the great void:)

Hmmm.  That sounds like a reasonable way to limit the effectiveness of
drives as weapons.  I\'d make that about 100 major hits to the aft of
your ship for running the drive in an atmosphere.

As far as attacking a ship, space station, or vacuum world with the
drive exhaust, as a referee I\'d probably come up pilot or astrogation
task to aim the drive, and assign an amount of damage based on how well
the roll was made (anywhere from 1 minor hit out at 10km or so, all the
way up to a couple of hundred major hits for firing the drive while in a
docking bay of a spaceport).  For any damage over about 2 major hits,
I\'d make the firing ship talk about half damage.  (Note that I don\'t
have any physics to back this up; this is just what I\'d do as a
referee).

I posted a fix along these lines a couple of days ago (probably just
before you started getting TML).  I decided that "tribal" was an
interesting idea, but effectively "no government" (the entry for no
government mentions "family" authority as a likely ruling body; I
generized this to "family, tribe, or clan").

My fix also placed the TED code in the world\'s "Allegiance" field (on
the theory that TEDs can only occurr in the wilds, where the idea of a
world\'s allegiance to an interstellar state is, by definition,
non-existant).

> List TEDs as Non-charismatic Dictators (code B) with the note \'TED\'

The other thing I did was that I realized that Non-charismatic Dictators
are not the only possible form of a TED government.  Many common
Imperial-Era Governments would be classified by the RCES as "TEDs"
(including the government of Pallique in the Spinward Marches - the
religious dictatorship that is the setting for the "Divine Intervention"
Classic Traveller Double Adventure).

So I added a "TED Government Type" table, to generate the type (which
could possible include Charismatic Dictators and Oligarchies,
Non-Charismatic Dictators, Totalitarian Oligarchies, Feudal
Technocracies, and and Religious Dictatorships and Oligarchies, in
varying probabilities).  This "TED Government Type" goes in the UWP,
while the Td (for TED) Allegiance Code  indicates a TED.

The TED Code could conceviably be put in the Trade Classifications,
Travel Zone (which isn\'t used in the Wilds), or the Alliegance.

> A review of all GOV codings I can find shows:
Ah.  Thanks.  Tis is one thing I didn\'t have, and so was reluctant to
"create" a new code.  At this point, I\'m not sure if it\'s really needed.
Placing the TED code outside of the UWP may be the best solution to the
problem.

Currently, you can\'t determine which worlds in the Wilds are balkanized
(because the code of the "dominant" government is in the UWP).  My
original fix restored Government code 7 to these worlds.

Bertil has pointed out to me that Balkanized worlds are going to be very
common in the Wilds (probably why GDW didn\'t use a Balkanized code in
the first place).  So his suggestion was to generate a government code
for these balkanized worlds and place it in the trade classification as
an aid to the referee.  As the T:TNE rules point out, the first and best
resort for world generation is to have the referee do it manually; the
rules and codes are there as an aid to the imagination, not a
replacement for it.

No, no, no.  First of all, the missiles we have been talking about
aren\'t more effective than the det-laser missiles described in the T:TNE
rules; they are just *different* - slightly more advantagous under some
circumstances, different costs, slightly less useful under other
circumstances.

THe reason I got started on this was that I felt that the det-laser was
certainly not the *only* kind of missile available for T:TNE space
combat.

Secondly, to make these "new" missiles useful, you really want to have a
MFD (Master Fire Director) which allows you to ignore some or all of the
increased difficulty levels associated with the new missiles.  Bertil
suggested (and I agree) that MFDs should be restricted-purchase items,
and normally found only on warships.

Finally, nukes - even big nukes - just aren\'t that effective in space;
see my previous posting on the gross effects of the inverse-square law.
You will need to get pretty close to even attempt a hit with one of
these "new" missiles - which translates to plenty of chances for
successful anti-missile laser fire.  And finally, the requirements for a
hit aren\'t easy to meet:  you\'ve got to get the missile into the same
range band as the target *with enough fuel left over to exceed the
target\'s G-rating* before you can even attempt a hit.  And when you do
make the attempt, it is at one to three difficulty levels higher than a
"normal" det-laser missile.

I don\'t know about the others, but for myself I\'ve been assuming that
high G ratings like this will be restricted to special-purpose ships
with small crews (for whom the required accelleration couches, G-suits,
and so forth will be provided). Ships like SDBs, fighters, and the like.

Presumably accelleration couches will be able to be specified in the
ship design (just like you could in Classic Traveller\'s High Guard and
in MegaTraveller).  I personally would say that ships with a crew of
more than a dozen are too large for overthrust to be practical

A det-laser is a det-laser is a det-laser; the source of the excitation
x-rays will make the thing lighter or cheaper or be able to pump more
beams, but has no effect on the range or accuracy of the beams
themselves.  Although presumably a high-tech det-laser would have
improved lasing elements as well as an improved source of excitation
energy.

As far as Impact goes, the answer is probably a kill, just like it is
for a large enough nuke.  Proximity depends on the amount of energy in
the warhead, the fraction that is emitted as radiation, and the distance
the warhead is from the target when it goes off.  At more than a few
hundred meters, the energy required gets to be pretty high.

Well, the High Guard DMs are all out the window with T:TNE.  In a more
general sense, hitting the target ship isn\'t a hard problem if you
can manage to keep a sensor lock on it.  The missile can compute the
target\'s accelleration and velocity from successive sensor observations,
and plan the maneuvers it must make to intercept.  Every time it takes a
sensor observation, it updates it\'s course, and takes another
observation as fast as it can.  With some knowledge of the target\'s
capabilities, the launching ship can figure out whether or not the
missile even has a chance to hit before firing it.

Missiles will have to have an accelleration advantage over their targets
in order to achieve an impact hit.  The bigger the advantage, the easier
the hit.  In T:TNE, missiles can have a big accelleration advantage over
their targets; in Classic Traveller, less so.

Back to High Guard for a moment.  Presumably even an autonomous missile
is programmed with the parameters expected of the target ship.  A
powerful computer in the launching ship can produce better guesses of
the target\'s behavior.  Another possible explanation is to treat the
High Guard computer DM as representative of the electronic
countermeasures and electronic warfare support available to each ship.
Either way, its a case of rationalizing something which was
fundamentally arbitrary.

I\'ve been thinking about T:TNE errata.  There isn\'t much of it, but there is

If anybody has more errata (down to individual typos), if you will send it to

week.  I\'ll also take responsibility for making sure that someone at GDW
sees and reads it, so we can get all of this stuff fixed for the next
printing and/or the boxed edition :)

How about it, everyone?

  I imagine that the mechanism that harm the ship works like this: The 
fusion rocket eject <whatever> (soft xrays perhaps:). If it is inside an
atmosphere, it will form a classical fireball just aft of the ship. If it
is close to an object in vacuum, it will hit the object and do damage through
thermal and ionizing radiation and perhaps particles of different kinds too.
Since it is so powerful it will make a \'fireball\' of the material if it is
close enough and that will emit thermal radiation that harms the ship. 
Reflexion of particles and thermal radiation is also possible.

  Since the intensity of the exhaust drops with the square (or is it cube?
it\'s 11PM here in Sweden:) of the distance, the retransmittance/reflexion
isn\'t perfect, and the intensity of radiation going back the other way also
drops with the square (cube?) there should be a range at which the ship would
do some damage without any major ill effects to itself.

  I can accept a continous plasma gun with range 10 and pen 10 resulting from
the maneuver jets. Imagine the difficulty in maneuvering the whole bloody
ship to aim the thing! :)

  I know I used this for a suggested evasive tactics, but there *is* large
grey areas around the CG, especially now in TNE when it has been made clear
that you can\'t use it for propulsion.
  The CG in general is a minfield of rationalizations that can backfire in
nasty ways: Imagine a powerplant that uses a weight suspended with CG 
and has a generator attached to the wire. If the energy used up by the CG
is less that what you get out of the generator, you have yourself a free
energy device at least as good as the \'thruster plate power plant\' that
was possible in MegaT:)

  IMHO we should follow the examples given (that CG needs additional
thrust of some kind to get anywhere).

  I remember the HOTOL and wonder if this setup could be combined with the

  (That would give a reason for keeping the fuel scoops even though GG

  I\'m not certain how an MFD and the sensor lock requirement affect the
usability of missiles. The MFD could presumably make it much easier to fire
against one missile, but the sensor lock could make it more difficult to
fire against the second missile in the same turn.
  Have you found any specific mention of if it is allowed to change fire
to new targets within a turn?

  400kg, that\'s 224cm aprox. Against steel... penetration 718. Say
Damage 1/2-360 or 1/4-180.

OK. I don\'t insist on force fields. If you can make the game universe work

everything else being equal. I\'ll take fun gaming over realism every day.

I thought that TNE rules was to be applicable to any Traveller period. That
ships are going to be few and far between for a few decades after 1200 is no
use in the general way. I personally hope to justify privately owned ships
in Aoreriyya by 1210.

That just means that power plants needs a fix too.

If force fields exist at all I see no reason why cheap, common force fields
is any worse doubletalk than expensive, rare ones. As for the magic part:
sure they\'re magic, but are they any more magic than jump drives, psionics,
and contragravity?

Slice it any way you like, unless you can come up with a cheap, common, and
effective way to protect communities from a nuclear missile then cheap,
common nuclear missiles are BAD, BAD, BAD in a gaming sense. Since (as far
as I know) nuclear missiles _would_ (realistically) be cheap and common in
a high-tech environment I think some protection is in order. And note that
I advocated that such force fields should be expensive: To be found in
cities and on warships, but not in towns and on merchant ships.

Probably a jet of hydrogen and helium plasma.  Effectively a continous
plasma gun of some size, as you mention below.  Drop-off is proportional
to the square of the distance, but the constant of proportionality is
different for a cone than for a sphere.

Believe it or not, I wasn\'t using it for propulsion.  I got the idea by
watching paper airplanes fly (they don\'t have any propulsion either).
All of the control (I was flying sophisticated paper airplanes with
canards, leading edge slats, trailing-edge flaps, rudders and the like)
and the "propulsion" is provided by gravity.  If you made your starship
as light a paper airplane, it could glide too.  Imagine for a
moment a streamlined ship re-entering an atmosphere from orbit (the US
Space Shuttle is a good example).  It re-enters and files in to a
landing without the application of any thrust (after the de-orbit burn,
which happens in a vacuum).  Now imagine a starship equipped with CG
lifters doing the same maneuver.  It wouldn\'t need heat shielding tiles,
because the rate of descent could be controlled by varying the lift of
the CG lifters.  If the ship is at all streamlined (a basic cone, or a
lifting body of some type) aerodynamic control surfaces can control it\'s
heading, and it can glide in to the landing pad.  If it actually is an
airframe (like the space shuttle), it can be flown like a glider, with
surprising precision and grace.  Launching works exactly the same way,
except that you are falling UP instead of DOWN.

Granted, but my idea doesn\'t depend on a something-for-nothing effect;
it still works fine no matter how much energy the CG requires to
maintain it\'s lift (as long as the ship has a power plant capable of
running the CG).  My "trick" works by using the CG to control the rate
at which potential energy is exchanged for kinetic energy, and by
transforming and controlling the kinetic energy by the action of air flowing
over lifting surfaces.  Principles familliar to all sailplane pilots.

Right.  In this case, the "thrust" is lift force generated by the
atmosphere passing over aerodynamic surfaces, as the ship falls through
the air.  Without a CG, you need heat shielding and attain multi-dozen
mach numbers.  With the CG, you keep it under a couple of machs at all
times, and come in for a nice slow landing.  And you can control your
glide ratio, too.

I\'ve only skimmed the ship combat as yet.  I\'ll have a much better idea

Yep, one of the all time classics.  The only game I know of that gave
details for blood transfusions (that were necessary :-)  It packed heaps
of useful information into a rather small rule book (damage because you\'re
too close to something very hot, radiation damage, electricity, cold, ...)
Lots of hit points and weapons that take them away in large chunks.  A very
fatal combat system added to the mess.

And the players had a tech advantage over most of the nasties they met!
Good clean fun!

Such a technology still requires the virus to convince that computer that
what it just received was really a program not the data that was expected.
Current computers distinguish between the two (well some small ones
don\'t turn the protection on even if they ought to).

The description of how the virus propogates may work for high TL computers
(I don\'t know how a TL15 computers works so I cannot comment on it) but
it will not work on lowly TL8 computers without the virus physically altering
the circuits which requires physical contact or at least close proximity to
a large enough silicon area.

I\'m quite happy to make the claim that low TL computers are going to be
highly virus resistant.  And I\'m willing to extend this claim another TL.
Moreover, once the virus is discovered it is quite a simple proposition
to design computers that are immune to it.  Don\'t make the computer physically
accessable (large locked box?) and treat all incoming data with caution (and
isolate these inputs).

Even if re-programmable logic is being extensively used, adding a simple switch
that disables the re-programming solves the problem.

Of course, there is a down-side to all this: the secure computers are going to
be harder to access and use than insecure ones.

I\'m afraid that I\'m no expert on explosives, but presumably the timing
of the detonation can be arranged to work out anyway.  The penetration
mechanism of a HEAP charge is the jet of hot gas generated.  To make it
work at high speeds, you need to have a proximity fuse that will set off
the warhead the right amount of time before impact, right?

Not quite.  KEAP is kind of useless agains a ground target - it has lots
of energy, but doesn\'t deliver it in the most useful form.  So HE will
be around as a ground attach missile that just happens to have a
secondary anti-ship role.

And as Bertil points out, you can always choose *not* to detonate the
explosive, after all - it\'s still got it\'s kinetic energy.

The Saturn had some pretty darn big flame trenches to contain that blast
and make sure it doesn\'t interfere with the rocket.  Do *you* really
want to land in the middle of a 10km wide area that\'s been under fusion
gun attack for the last however long?  And how are you going to get the
landing legs of your starship unstuck from all of that fused soil?  All
concerns of player characters torching cities aside, I don\'t think you
want to have to land in that stuff, no matter whether or not there is a
local authority to tell you not to.

> Probably use Scramjets, just like we used to do back in original Trav
> when we first started playing many years ago...

One of my proposals (which didn\'t seem to make it to TML) was to open
some ramscoops and admit air into the fusion rocket chamber.  Heat it to
very high tempratures (possibly with the fusion ignition system) using
power plant energy, and let it expand out the back.  Similar in concept
to the US "Pluton" missile propulsion system (the Pluton used a fission
reactor operating literally a few degrees below it\'s meltdown temprature
as a heat source).  It wouldn\'t provide anywhere near the thrust of a
fusion rocket, but it should be enough to maneuver the ship with.

The other proposal was to use the CG lifters to control the aparrent
weight of your vehicle, and literally glide down (or up).  Use
aerodynamic control surfaces to provide control and lift.  This provides
a rationalization for why only streamlined and airframe ships can
operate in an atmosphere (you need to be sufficiently streamlined to be
aerodynamically stable, and you need some control surfaces).

I have seen plenty of real rockets get their tailfeathers scortched by
launching from a pad that had a poor blast deflector design.  For the
rockets I\'m talking about, the problem is minor and can be repaired with
a little paint and filler putty.  I doubt that your PC\'s starship is as
easily repaired when damaged by stray fusion exhaust.

Go fly some real rockets and try different blast deflector designs.
I\'ll give you a clue: a flat plate is one of the worst offenders.
Something that is angled away from the rocket is much better.

Why should it be bad???  Your reasoning is specious, as can be seen by
looking at pictures of any Saturn launch.  The blast punches DOWN!
Hard!  Way too hard for anything trivial like atmosphere to slow it

So basically, with Fusion drives for take-off, you\'re going to want
landing pads about 10Km across for each ship!  Not to mention the fact
that they\'re going to need some *major* resurfacing after each use...

I think the only practical thing to assume here is that (primarily) the
scramjet technique is going to be used to bootstrap yourself into orbit.
Maybe the Customs Inspectors in orbit turn off your fusion drive or
something.  Of course, *that* would only work in some sort of civilized
area, not what T:TNE offers up for a campaigning atmosphere.

Of course, what GDW should do if they\'re going to give the ships this
sort of drive is address the above issues in the combat rules....Which
isn\'t happening...

DREAM ON, Bertil!  Look at a REAL rocket launch!  MUCH lower exhaust

form long tongues af flame.  Which this will do as well.  Only this will

How long are these going to be, exactly?  This could cause some *major*
traffic hazards :)  I think the fusion drives would, "realistically",
change the nature of both combat and general starship practices pretty
heavily.  Things ought to be different, but probably the official GDW
word won\'t be that much different (sort of like how they probably won\'t
notice the "demise" of Gas Giant refueling...)

I think "BAD IDEA" to run the drive anywhere it\'s going to hit

Maybe we\'re safe in assuming that the ships have small (chemical?)

  Having fusion rockets as \'the fusiongun from hell\' means that you have an
*unlimited ammo* *no-cost ammo* weapon. Letting people detonate their ships
for some kilotons to some megatons of effect means that they have a *one 
shot* *MCr40+ per shot* weapon.
  These limitations on detonating ships (either through fooling with the
powerplant or with the jump drive) takes away it\'s usefulness and removes
the problem IMHO.

  In Traveller they are.

  What you look for already exists in TTNE and it is called the Master Fire
Director. You find it on warships and in the defence networks of worlds, but 
not on merchant ships. Allowing the MFD to do the same for defensive fire
as for offensive fire means that a character with skill 5 and attribute 5
has a 95% chanse of stopping the missile *per individual weapon firing*
controlled by a TL8 MFD!
  Tie two lasers to the MFD and you get a 99.75% stop probability. Three
and it becomes 99.9875%.

  (Ok, there might be some cultural issues here. I (and presumably Hans?) 
don\'t think that having shore batteries (guns and missiles) around civilian
harbours and gun turrets around international airports in Real Life is
in anyway strange. There are batteries around Gothenburg (a few manned even
now) and turrets around Arlanda International (unmanned).
  Personally I\'ve always assumed that any starport higher than E (and many E
ports too) has several batteries of lasers and missiles. Manned.)

  Yes, going down. But how about going up? Standing on the ground you have
zero potential energy (if the ground is zero) and zero kinetic energy.

  You mean like nuke punches the atmopshere out of the way without forming
a fireball? The only example of a large fusion reaction in a normal atmosphere
we have is the hbomb and it sure forms a fireball.
  
  You yourself said that the energy output through a scoutships engines 
equals 125 Terawatts (30kT per second is 1.254 Joules per seconds aka
watts), and considering that this only uses 25 m3 of hydrogen *per hour*
(2G) it seems to me that the exhaust is short on mass. I don\'t have the MT
books here so I might be wrong about what liquid H2 weighs, but it looks like
the scout would use 480 grams of H2 per second. What kind of pressure will
this flimsy jet inflict a few km from the ship? More or less than the
air pressure?
  (And what part of the exhaust will be in radiation? If the 480g/s is
correct, and if the velocity you stated (20,000km/s) is correct, the
kinetic energy will account for 22 of those 30kT that comes out of the
engines. Will the other 8kT be radiation? Some of it in the form of soft 
xrays perhaps?)

  I am pretty amazed that you lable speculation about how a fusion rocket
might work in different environments as \'chaning the laws of the universe\'.
I have not seen a fusion rocket of the yields we are talking about here and 
neither have you. Have anyone of us done professional work on this? Like
simulations or small scale experiments for example? No? Does anyone here 
know wether a fusion rocket with the thrustlevels in question EVEN WORKS IN
AN ATMOSPHERE?!!

Fascinating.  But you got the velocities wrong on this.  One G-hour is
35280 m/s, NOT 3528 m/s.  Interestingly enough, you got your KE\'s right,
in spite of the incorrect velocities...

5gm is NOT "a BB".  It is bigger than a .223 round (which is only
3.5gm).

<snicker>.  The missile\'s drives, in order to be capable of the kinds of

plasma gun, instead of the 100 TERAWATT fusion gun a Free Trader is
carrying around.  But under Striker rules, that\'s still a penetration of
6000 meters of steel at "short range" of 140Km or less...

Nonsense!  It will do no such thing!  It will look just like a classic
fusion gun blast in the 100 terawatt power range.  Remember the Kzinti

pen-10?  I HOPE you are talking about the attitude jets, and not the
main drive here, or you are full of it.  The main drive should be a
continuous penetration measured in dozens to thousands of meters of
steel...

Play Star Wars!  If you are going to ignore physics just to make it feel

Hi,
> collected TNE errata
Stonking idea. I\'ve just got my TNE (17 squidlets in the UK) and was faced with
the prospect of trawling through n megabytes of TML to find people\'s
alterations to the govt tables etc - deciding which one of various worthy
version to take, etc. Wildstar to the rescue. Getting it GDW approved so that
they use the corrected stuff as well would be good.

> TNE
Seems like they\'ve changed a lot of stuf that could have stayed the same - e.g.
why 2D6-1 instead of 2D6? Or starting previous ex at 18 instead of 17? Strange
seemingly random changes. I like even numbers so I\'ll be starting at 18 I
think. Character generation is better, IMHO, simpler and doesn\'t take weeks to
do like HG/Merc etc. And, v important for lazy people like me, it\'s much easier
to get the Mac to do it. There seems to be lots of DOS and Unix software
around, is there any Mac stuff anywhere or do I have to write it?

> Virus
Given the extent to which systems would be interconnected 4000 years from now,
don\'t you think the Virus is eminently possible? Take Gibson for example -
cyberspace is only 50 years away - where computers are troiling around in each
other\'s guts all the time. The AI controlling that slab of black ice can
infiltrate your machine to such a high degree that it can get the neural
interface to fry your brain. Still think the Virus is impossible? And we\'ll be
well beyond FORMAT in 4000 years time - at least I **** well hope so. Then
again, Microsoft may still be around :-(

> Trav -> Cyber
Does anyone think it\'s strange that there\'s no stuff about implants or other
cyber kit in Trav? Someone mentioned to me that with a few millenia to run at
we could come up with some seriously bizarro augmentation gear - he also said
this was the reason for Cyberpunk\'s meteoric rise and Trav\'s relative decline
from hip status. I tried to explain this away with Imperial Humanisation
decrees, or genetic breeding, but I could tell I wasn\'t getting anywhere.
Comments?

> New versions of RPG favourites
Over in the RuneQuest mailing list, the authors of RQ4 (new version, similar in
scale and impact to TNE) are emailing beta versions around for any old bod to
comment on and pick holes in. The result is an *enormous* amount of playtesting
being done and game systems emerging that are solid and universally accepted
(after heated discussions, etc, admittedly). Did GDW do anything similar for
TNE? If not, why not? Wouldn\'t it have been great for everyone to have a hand
in the new Trav, and as a side benefit not have any errata to speak of?

	Hello There, 
	I had left this list for awhile but I am back for two reasons, my 
gamers want to play Traveller again and because TNE is out. The reason why 
I lost interest in MT is because you really could not play it without using 
the Imperium. Now what I want to know is is it possible to play TNE without 
using the GDW Universe?

Well, I *have* assumed that the CG lifters can lift the ship a nonzero
distance off of the ground (just as they can for an air-raft or a grav
bike).  Presumably, they will require energy input appropriate to the
work being done (but knowning GDW, I\'m not going to count on it).

Until someone can tell me a good reason why not, I\'m going to use the
following rationale in my campaigns:  ContraGravity devices can
manipulate the local gravitational field, effectively producing a force
exactly opposed to local gravity, with a magnitude anywhere between 0
and 2 times (inclusive) of the local gravitational force.

Therefore, the maximum upward velocity that can be produced is the
world\'s escape velocity, and the maximum downward velocity that can be
cancelled is also the escape velocity.  In my campaigns, the CG will be
completely umable to produce any forces in any direction other than
directly against the vector of the local gravitational force.

The energy input to a CG device will be proportional to the work being
done (and the constant of proportionality will be greater than 1 ;) so
that perpetual motion machines are still impossible.

While some of the above will probably be invalidated by the Technical
Architecture Manual (or even detailed analysis of the vehicles in
T:TNE), the above at least makes sense to me, and doesn\'t grossly
violate any of the laws of physics.

Following is a set of fairly unconnected thoughts and ideas that I have been
pondering lately (this senior business isnt all its cracked up to be).  Some of
them I have been able to throw to the wolves (well, wolf, I only have one Vargr
in my current campaign) who are my players, and only now have I been able to
sit down (after reading two weeks of TML posts) and put these tidbits into
electronic info.

On the subject of fusion rockets:

This was not a problem with MTs reactionless drives, which didnt start with
MT.  Theres a line in High Guard, pg 17, "Power for the maneuver drives is
provided by the starships power plant...Fuel consumption for manuever drives is
inconsequential...regardless of the degree of maneuver undertaken."  This
sounds a lot like a-grav, but it doesnt drop off when not in a gravity field. 
True, reactionless drives greatly disturb the physicist within this astronomer
mind, but they are a lot more poetic than fusion rockets, and I dont have to
worry about my players being able to decimate a city with their starships
engines.  I am willing to trade some scientific accuracy to plug loopholes in
the rules. (Besides, a Vargr is perfectly capable of destroying a city using
only the force of his personality...)

Mr Higginbotham continues:

Chemical drives are too,too,too old tech for me.  While useful for the
technological inferiors who now populate the former Imperium (more on that
later), I cannot see the Grand Navy of the Third Imperium using chem drives, 
nor can I see not allowing my players to land on a planet.  Does this mean that
even a lowly 100-ton scoutship has to carry a shuttle to land on an unknown
planet? 
I can accept two things: first, fusion rockets are cheaper and more powerful
than a-gravs or reactionless drives, and two, that fusion rockets will find
their place on station-based SDB and fighters.  The high acceleration/low
duration needed for fighter craft seems to be perfect for fusion rockets.

Also:

Hear, Hear!  Ive spent my years complaining about the MT construction rules,
but they are useful (once some the the holes are plugged).

My Vargr and I agree.

On a slightly unrelated note:

I would think that any crewmember in their right mind would strap down into an
acceleration couch whenever the combat alert went off.  The only people who
could move around would be damage control parties and engineers, and even they
would take care to make sure they were holding on tight at all times (remember
the tale of the Old Timer in Starship Ops Manual? Didnt his ship only do 4g?).
Space combat is deadly enough as it is without taking stupid risks.  Three
things that make it more survivable are acceleration couches, vacc suits, and
depressurising the ship.  A-couches to prevent your crew from becoming sticky
jelly that needs to be cleaned off the bulkheads, vacc suits for protection
from the vaccuum of space (and some radiation protection), depressurising the
ship stops shockwaves from travelling through the atmosphere of the ship, and
prevents explosive decompression.

(Yet another change of subject)

I will add my voice to the cacaphony of shouts that dislike the Virus idea. 
The Virus was created for one reason, and that was to bring the Rebellion to a
screeching halt and bring on a deep, dark, long night so that players could
have fun beating up on technologically inferior residents of war-torn worlds.

   ----Puhleeeze!----

Not ragging on the universe in T:TNE (okay, I am:  I loved Survival Margin, I
hope the rest of GDWs newest Traveller will be as well written and assembled. 
They set a new standard for exellence that GDW should always achieve with
Traveller, but I still severly dislike the universe it describes), but, the
Virus was an idea that wasnt really necessary.

Lets pretent...
what might have happened without the Virus...(Sherman set the Way\'forward 
Machine)}}}

The Rebellion was already heading for a final showdown (probably between Lucan
and Dilinor) that would draw in the rest of the factions (except the Spinward
Marches) into one great, final spasm of destruction.  After the dust settled
 (oh, bout 1130-1140) the slide into another Long Night would have been
inevitable.  Just wait long enough (oh, by 1200), and the Long Night would be
in full darkness, and slowly getting worse before getting better.
See? All GDW had to do was wait a bit and our beloved Traveller universe would
fall apart before our own, saddened eyes.  Instead, the Virus plunged the
Imperium into a nose-dive into the depths of barbarity; a universe where
survival is the only reward, and suffering is the coin of the realm.
The Virus was only the beating of a once-glorius, but now dead, horse.  Out of
the ashes of the Third Imperium would have, eventually, arose a phoenix, a new
Imperium to once again unite the children of Terra under one protective banner
of brotherhood and peace.  The Virus threatens even that.  The Virus strikes at
the very heart of the Imperium: at the very thing that made it possible:
technology.

With out a high tech base, the phoenix will never be able to spread her wings,
never be able to take flight, never be able to protect the peace that allow
people to live normal, everyday lives.

Oh, dont worry, humaniti will eventually pull itself out of this gutter, like
theyve done for hundread of thousands of years.  Its just, this time, the
future might not be as bright.  With every ship dating from the Third Imperium
either confined to the Marches or destroyed on first sight due to the
possibility of it carrying the Virus, Old Tech equipment will be harder and
harder to obtain.  It will be almost impossible to reinvent the technology
using a basis that the Virus couldnt infiltrate, and any tech copied from older
designs will be just as vulnerable.  Goodbye high tech, goodbye Third Imperium,
goodbye Traveller, goodbye to Science Fiction Adventure in the Far Future.

Goodbye to good old fashioed revenge!  I wanted Lucans head brought to me
on a platter with a side order of fries!  Someone comes along and screws up
your whole universe and theirs nothing you can do to him.

If I wanted a depressing universe, Id play T2000.

My frends, its time to dust off the Classic Traveller universe and turn back
the clock.  The Traveller we know and love is long gone.  I survives only in
our hearts, minds, dreams, and wishes.  All we old-timers can do is keep the
memory of it sacred, and hope its meaning can be taught to The New Era of
Traveller.

Traveller is dead,
Long Live Traveller!

(Besides, I reall cant wait to get my hands on the new rules.  Really, did you
expect me to give up Traveller?)

I\'ve flown model rockets for years.  I have yet to see one get damaged
by the backblast once it was ten feet off the ground...and you don\'t
torch cities by landing on them, then taking off again.  You come down
to within a few Km, then HOVER for a while...

It would require a lunatic to take off under fusion flame unless he
WANTED to torch a city.  Remember Niven\'s Known Space?  It was an
Instant Organ Banks offense to light off a fusion drive in atmosphere.

Who knows?  Depends too much on nozzle design, Isp, atmospheric pressure
(though the last won\'t do too much terribly soon).  George, you are a
rocket guy, so your fluid dynamics is more current than mine is.  What
kind of exhaust profile would you get from an Isp=2,000,000 rocket with
a 100:1 mouth:throat ratio nozzle?  Politely assuming that the nozzle
shape was optimized for the fluid moving through it, of course...

Of course, this is an assinine example, since a nuclear weapon doesn\'t
have a combustion chamber or nozzle, or any of those good things you
need to get reasonably efficient thrust out of the thing.  BTW, in case
you are interested, if you mix LH2 and LO2 in a big puddle on the
ground, then light it, IT FORMS A FIREBALL TOO!  But it still makes a
jet when burned in a rocket engine...

	Well, I don\'t have my calculator handy, but assuming that the
exhaust is a cone with length 5 times diameter (which is PROBABLY a
pretty crappy assumption - it probably is more like a cone with length
50-100 times diameter), then the cone is at or above atmospheric
pressure within 7000 meters or so of the nozzle.  Using the 100x
assumption, the cone is above atmospheric pressure 20Km or so from the
nozzle.
	Of course, actually, the exhaust will ALWAYS be at or above
atmospheric pressure, because atmospheric pressure will shape the
exhaust flare.  Which will serve to make the jet longer and thinner,
rather than the reverse...

Probably not.  Probably hard gammas and neutrinos.  But the radiation
will be stopped by the nozzle, or the ship will be useless in atmosphere
or out of it.  So the radiation will go DOWN, and make the damage down
below worse...


>> DREAM ON, Bertil!  Look at a REAL rocket launch!  MUCH lower exhaust

I doubt the radiation has anything to do with the shape of the exhaust. 
And the density is not relevant.  What is relevant is the PRESSURE. 
Which is MUCH MUCH MUCH higher in the fusion drive than the Saturn...

Bertil, once the plasma leaves the nozzle, it doesn\'t matter a flip
whether it was the result of fusion, chemical reaction, or someone
blowing real hard.  All that matters is the kinetic energy of the
particles, and the size and shape of the nozzle.  And all the fluid
dynamics *I* ever learned says that a jet that hot will do an enormous
amount of damage to everything below it.  And it won\'t form a fireball,
unless all those fluid dynamics professors were incompetent inbeciles...

I see no reason why fusion rockets would fail to operate in an
atmosphere.  The ejection velocity is far greater than sonic
velocities, thus the exhaust will not impinge on the ship itself
unless something reflects it.

The idea of getting hit by your backblast will only present a
problem at lift off.  It therefore seems logical to me that the
Contra-Grav systems will be used to lift clear of the tarmac
and once an acceptable altitude the fusion rockets may be lit
at low power to take the ship clear of the area.  Once clear,
and in a designated traffic corridor, the ship may advance their
throttles to their rated thrust.

The traffic corridors will be guarded by weaponry equivalent to
shore batteries.

BTW, there Have been shore batteries in the US.  They protected
harbors for many years.  If the US was in range of hostile
aircraft, I\'m sure we would have ground to air defences at the
airports as well.  We DO have an extensive anti-aircraft network,

The name of the game is science FICTION role-playing.  Getting the
science right is important; don\'t doubt that I take some good care in
getting the science believable.  However, at some level of detail,
absolute scientific accuracy has to take a backseat to storytelling. 
I described (and clearly labelled) what I would do if I had to make the
call as a referee *right then*.  I *know* it\'s not scientifically
accurate, but it should be good enough for the story to continue.

As opposed to raising a problem and then heckling everybody while we
puzzle it out, what would you do?  I realize that you\'re in a bad mood
(probably from reading too much Star Viking background in T:TNE), but
try to be constructive here.

Most of those sorts of changes are for compatibility with Twilight:2000
(Merc:2000) and Dark Conspiracy.  T:TNE uses the current version of the
GDW "House" (read T2k) role-playing system.

No, GDW didn\'t do that for T:TNE, although they did post the character
generation system for comments.  I\'m not sure why not; several of us
here on the Net specifically asked that they do so.  Such an approach
would have been a very good idea; I feel that the character generation
system is much better for the comments and suggestions it generated as a
result of being here on the net.  And yes; about two weeks with a draft
of the rules and we could have stomped out the errata very effectively.

Sure you can.  Admittedly, a lot of the material in the book refers to
the "official" campaign universe.  However, T:TNE is (IMHO) as amenable
to "roll-your-own" universes as the original Classic Traveller was.  You
may want to wait for the Technical Architecture book, though, so theat
you can design your own tech gadgets.

And at $25, it\'s a lot more feasable to pick up T:TNE on speculation (on
the chance that it might be what you want) than a lot of other games.

Not needed, Steve.  It looks like you\'ve got the first draft all
ready to go.  I certainly can\'t speak for Hans and Bertil, but what I an
trying to do is explain the following observations:

A fusion drive operated towards a planet will flatten forests, and cause
thermal damage for kilometers around the landing/takeoff site.  For
hundreds of meters around the ship, it will be intense enough to
melt and fuse soil, and will excavate a crater hundreds of meters deep.
You yourself calculated that the gross effects would be similar to a
three megaton fusion bomb detonated at ground level.  I should note that
the radiation effects (induced radiation in the soil, radioactive
fallout) would be similar to a fusion bomb as well.  In addition,
various and sundry radioactive gasses would be emitted into the
atmosphere.  Altogether nasty.

On takeoff, the ship will be sitting in the
center of all of that; unless the ship accellerates out faster than the
front of all of these varous effects (which is possible, but with a 1g
drive on a world with 1g surface gravity?), it will be *in* that mess
for some non-zero amount of time.  If the ship landed under fusion
power, it\'s going to have to stay put until the fused soil melts away
from the landing carriage.

However, all of the available Traveller (Classic, MegaTraveller, and New
Era) points to a very different model of ship operations.  Wilderness
landings and takeoffs don\'t leave giant craters about the world; all you
need is a relatively flat patch of clear, hard ground.  It is aparrently
perfectly safe for an unprotected human to stand a few hundred meters
from a starship taking off.  This definitely doesn\'t fit the fusion
drive model.

Therefore, starships operating close to a world don\'t use fusion drives
when doing so.  You propose that they use scramjets for propulsion in an
atmosphere.  Aside from the obvious problems when operating near a
vacuum world or on a world with an oxygenless exotic, insidious, or
corrosive atmosphere, there are other problems with this suggestion.  A
scramjet (SupersoniCRAMJET) needs for the ship to already have
significant forward velocity before it will produce thrust; not a
problem for landing, but what about takeoffs?  Secondly, adding such
propulsion to a starship would seem to me to be a rather serious retcon.

I have proposed two mechanisms, both of which seem (in my humble
opinion) to be less of a retcon, and more in the spirit of Traveller.
While you have managed to produce a post virtually ensuring a
significant flame-fest, you haven\'t managed to comment on any of my
recent proposals in any serious manner.

As far as thge possibilities of operating a fusion drive near a
planetary surface or close to a large solid object in deep space, I\'ve
had a chance to do some more thinking.  I still feel that there is a
chance (depending on the amount of damage the starship wishes to do, and
the degree of success rolled by the pilot attempting the task) of damage
to the ship.  THe closer you are, the better the damage done, but the
higher your chances of being accidentally engulfed in the cloud of very
hot, radioactive gas.  Even for an instant, that could cause damage.

Secondly, while the temprature of the fusion exhaust is very high, the
mass flow is very low; I don\'t know enough about plasma physics to even
begin to calculate what that would do in an atmosphere of any density.
It seems to me that it\'s possible that the drive would "choke"
and fail to function properly or at all; possibly with damage to the
drive mechanism.

Unless and until someone can come up with some better physics; as a game
ruling (based on referee\'s judgement of possible effects, playability,
and general story needs) I would *still* say that running a fusion drive
in an atmosphere will cause serios damage to the drive and/or ship.
Running it agains a vacuum world or large asteroid would have a good
chance of damaging the ship, too; particularly as the amount of damage
increases, although not as seriously as I first estimated.  If a player
asked how much damage to the ship, I would probably reply along the
lines of "You don\'t know; as far as you can remember, nobody\'s ever
tried.  Do you want to be the first?".

At some point, additional scientific (or economic, or social, or
anything) accuracy becomes detrimental to the game.  The exact point
depends on the technical sophistication of the players and the referee.
When it comes right down to it, none of your players have ever seen a
starship except through their imaginations.  When you\'ve got enough
science that they can successfully suspend disbelief of your fiction,
that\'s enough.  Any more is actually distracting.

> PS.  My, I\'m getting acid these days...

You are.  You really should make the effort to be less so; it doesn\'t
help you make your point, and it certainly doesn\'t help raise my opinion
of you.  Maybe you should put less battery acid in your coffee?  ;-)

How many people paniced about this part of the message? (none???)

Well this is EXACTLY how the virus is supposed to infect unknown (and possibly
alien) computer systems.  Still sound reasonable at the current tech level???
(I still make no claims about super high tech computers because I cannot know
anything about them).


As an aside: This is quite close to how the \'internet worm\' gained access

  I was thinking that there might be problems in getting the thing to
ignite in the first place if the ignition chamber or whatever isn\'t in a 
vacuum. You could rig some contraption that \'opens the door\' after 
ignition trusting to the pressure to keep the air out, but there is 
a risk of \'disposable doors\' here if the ignition/opening isn\'t handled
exactly correctly. And if they are gone your engine won\'t start.

  I thought it was pretty clear that I was referring to them. But since it is

  Are you sure that they are capable of penetrating? If your data is correct
(and I have no reason to doubt it) it would seem that any missile sized 
object would vaporize into plasma (along with a part of the hull) when it
hits. So the effect on the hull would be a crater and the effect inside the
ship a fireball and spalls flying around. No penetration of missile parts.

  You need a minimum level of armour to get the radiation down to manageble
levels.

  Too heavy. Abolute maximum 2 tons (for 1 ton of warhead and one ton of

  Having 1000kg of HE in the missile means that you have a cheap (yes,
militarily speaking exposives are cheap) 1 ton lump of something that won\'t
work worse than any other 1 ton lump, but will work better in an atmosphere.

  1 gturn is aprox mach 50. I\'d like to see a missile designed for space
pull mach 50 in an atmosphere:) I assume they are designed for space since
most situations occur in space and protection against mach 50 would increase
the cost significantly.

  (This also limits the use of KE missiles against ground targets)

  The cannister missile I did used 15000 10mm 10g tungsten spheres, since
I estimated that that would weigh the same as the laser/detonation warhead.

  (Btw: I\'ll check the crater sizes against the tEoNW, since they look a 
little large for the kilotonnage even at optimum depth of burst:)

That\'s the part that most people see.  NORAD can call up all sorts of
defenses, though.  The US has an extensive SAM system, as well as
interceptor aircraft.  At different times, it has also had an
Anti-Satellite system (program "WS-437", from 1964-1975), and an
Anti-ballistic missile system (for a whole day, I believe).

Lots of interesting weapon systems were developed for NORAD use,
including the Nike series of SAMs, the Bomarc SAM, the F-106 Delta
Dagger (and it\'s Genie missile: an unguided AAM with a nuclear
warhead!), and the Safeguard SBM system with its Spartan and Sprint
missiles (Sprint\'s claim to fame: highest accelleration of any missile
ever built; it had to be, because it was designed to intercept incoming
RVs within the atmosphere).

If it filies over the US, NORAD sees it, and probably has (or at least,
had, until removed by treaty or act of congress) a way of shooting at
it.

    'body' => 'RE: Fusion Drives

I\'ve been listening to this debate about Fusion Drives as weapons, and I see
quite a bit of silliness on all sides...

A:  This talk about needing every city and ship have force fields to protect
    them from fusion drives takes the cake!  It\'s a *major* change to the game
    and basically allows any amount of handwaving and pure magic.

B:  While I\'m certainly no authority on the shape of the discharge from a
    fusion drive, I doubt that it\'s either a fireball, or tens of kilometers
    long.  While we don\'t have any fusion drives in real life to compare, we
    should be able to extrapolate.  

    Do any of the highest specific impulse or thrust rockets show any sign of
    cutting through air, forming a fireball instead?  What exactly is the
    difference between the chemical rocket and chemical explosive that makes
    one produce a straight line exhaust, and the other a fireball?  

    My first guess says that whatever the difference is between a rocket and a
    bomb, the same difference will apply to a fusion as well as a chemical of
    fission rocket and bomb.  EG fusion drives will not have fireballs.

    Second Idea:  What happens if we try to approximate a much higher energy 
    fusion exhaust, with thinking about what a lower energy exhaust does in a
    denser medium, IE what happens when you try to run a rocket under water?
    Does it create a fireball, or a straight exhaust?  My guess is that it
    would not work all that well.  I haven\'t seen any jet subs or torpedos
    around here.  This leads me to believe that a fusion drive in atmosphere
    might well be a bad idea.

    Idea three:  Is it possible to tune the shape of the exhaust from the
    fusion drive.  As this is done with chemical rockets and jets, I\'m sure
    that it can be done with fusion drives.  So you ought to be able to produce
    something in between the extremes of a fireball and a relatively long
    danger space behind every fusion drive.  Maybe it is only dangerous for
    a fraction of a Km.  I imagine that the highest effeciency has the longest
    dangerous exhaust, but it should be possible to tone it down when necessary
    in the atmosphere.  Remember, nobody\'s going to like you waving your ten Km
    exhaust around even in orbit if it\'s a busy place!

    Next:  Needing to use the fusion drives in the atmosphere isn\'t even
    necessary.  I think that Bertil\'s idea of using the Contra-Gravity to
    control descent and ascent is ideal.  Having a limit of plus and minus one
    or two G seems to me to contrainst this nicely.  

    Add the SCRAM jets which are also used as thrusters in space and you have
    all that you need for planetary maneuvering without any extra equipment or
    hocus pocus.  The SCRAM jets are *very* simple, feed whatever as fuel in,
    heat it with the basically unlimited power from the power plant, and viola!
    action/reaction.

    Now, I would expect that ?some? space ports would have ?some? hardened
    landing pads and blast deflectors that would allow relatively safe fusion
    takeoffs and landings, but this strikes me as military installation
    equipment.  But most space ports would not need this.

    So the picture of a take off that I have is: initial liftoff on CG and
    thrusters, and once you are in the air at a safe or regulation altitude you
    punch on the fusion drive at low and disappear as far as the ground is
    concerned.  Once you clear orbit, you bring the drive up to maximum.
    Gee kind of sounds like how the space ships in SW took off; don\'t hold it
    against me! ;-}

    Now, this is not to say that you *couldn\'t* use a fusion drive as a weapon.
    And I imagine that you could.  I don\'t see how you can avoid this without
    drastic handwaving.  Any Tool can be a Weapon.  But some Weapons don\'t make
    very good Tools.  

    In any case, the fusion drive is designed for thrust, while the FGMP/PGMP
    are designed to inflict damage.   I imagine it\'s possible that fusion
    drives are much less efficient as inflicting damage then the FGMP/PGMP; on
    the other hand, drives are *big*.  I think it\'s likely that the drive emits
    proportionally much more KE and radiation then matter then the PGMP.  

    I imagine that there is some minimum range below which using the drive as a
    weapon is hazardous to the attacker, and some maximum range where it\'s
    relatively harmless.  I\'ll leave it to others to argue about the range.

    If fusion drives *are* going to be used as weapons, will they become the
    major weapons like spinal mount weapons in good-old-fashioned-traveller?
    Very Niven-like, ships with combination drive/spinal mounts.

    Well that\'s how I see it.

C:  The Virus:  computers keep programs and data seperate.

    Not on your life.  Never have, and never will.  I transfer data between
    systems, stuff it in data files, and them compile and execute the programs
    in those very same files all the time.  What about system control data
    files?

    All that a virus requires is access to the computer in *some* form, even as
    data.  The Virus gets stuffed into a file.  Then the Virus figures out some
    method of fooling the computer into thinking that that file needs to be
    compiled or included into it\'s programming or control data structures.

    Non trivial, but this will always be the case.  The virus will always have
    the possibility of pretending to be some priviledged user at the least.

    I *don\'t* believe any of this \'the virus changes/is the hardware chips\'
    crap. However, as someone pointed out, most everything is EEPROMS, PROMS,
    PALS, PLAS, and loaded software already anyway.  I don\'t think that it\'s as
    simple as \'finding a good backup\' though.  The virus is likely to tell your
    operator to mount your old backup tapes to rewrite them, or hang around for
    a few years untill it is on all your backups.

    What we should see, is not computers being impossible, but much more dumb,
    and hardwired computers, and less programmable and adaptable computers,
    more write once storage.

Enough for now...

Anatomy of the fusion rocket:
Well, we\'re going to have some kind of physical thrust chamber, but the
only real way to handle plasma is with electromagnetic fields.  If one
ionized the air inside the physical chamber, it should be a simple
matter to eject the air out of the physical chamber.  If a vacuum is
necessary at all, all you really need would be a vacuum of ten to the
minus three torr (Not very low pressure at all).  At that pressure,
air loses it\'s ability to flow and acts as individual molecules bouncing
around.

All the plasma and fusion guns of Traveller would have the same kind of
problems.  If we are to assume that a plasma gun works at all, we must
conclude that this is not really a large problem.

I believe so, however, in conjunction with the many USAF bases around
the country, I\'d say it was part of an anti-aircraft network.

  Well, there might be some difference in the size of the chamber, and 
between generating pulses and a continous output.

  Vaporize is a nice clean word for a ugly process:) What will happen is
that you\'ll turn the matter into plasma, and the plasma may reradiate 
thermal energy in large amounts leading to something far less directed
than \'a long flame\'.

Fascinating.  Of course, I have been claiming a Free Trader (not a
Scout) had an output of 30Kt (not 33Kt).  And I was speaking in round
figures, also...

But beyond the fact that you got most of my arguments wrong, this is a
wonderful rebuttal.

This is the wrong method.  Using a reasonable approximation (ideal gas),
the pressure of a gas is about (1/3) * N * v^2 * molecular mass, where N
is number of atoms (molecules) per unit volume.

Steal from Niven again, and use a squirt of vaporized fissionables to
jump-start the reaction.  The fission reaction will clear the air out of
the chamber REAL FAST, and provide the excess of neutrons needed to
start the fusion off with a bang...

What would I do?  If my PCs tried to toast a spaceport?  Say "Ok, it
breaks up nicely when the blast hits.  Now what\'s the plan?"  I don\'t
see any reason to restrict the guys (and girls) from wrecking things,
except where internal logic decrees that they can\'t (you know, the
places where there are like 3000 missile launchers waiting for you to
look at it wrong, or the places (like my first game) where there are
nuclear dampers focussed on your ship whenever it is within range of a
spacestation, or on the ground at a spaceport)...



Wildstar:

So what does this all have to do with my original post, which started
all this?  My original post was to the effect that keeping nukes out of
the PC\'s hands (which you, Hans, and Bertil were trying to justify) was
pointless, since the destructive capability of the DRIVE was far more
extreme than any combination of nuke det-lasers they could carry.  This
has pretty much been ignored by you, and by everyone else, in the rush
to demonstrate how harmless a fusion drive is, or how things should be
changed to make them harmless..

These are the same models that consider gas giant refueling a wonderful,
cost-effective, idea, right?

That\'s because I have little if any interest in how starships land.  I
can see a lot of ways, you can see a lot of ways, everyone else can see
a lot of ways (well, a few for each of us anyway).  So?  I consider the
LETHALITY of the drive, and its usefulness as a weapon to be a FAR more
fundamental problem that needs resolution than the question of how ships
land...

Unlikely.  If the ship was designed to operate in space, where other
ships like this exist, then it is (SHOULD be) designed to deal with a
hit like that as long as the hit was less than, say, 0.01 seconds (the
time required for the ship to travel ten times its length at "normal"
speeds).  Assuming the "hit" was at long range (several hundred Km), or
just a brush with the edge of the drive flame, of course.

If this were true, then it would be even more true for fusion guns,
which have MUCH smaller mass flows, and (probably) operate at lower
temperatures and pressures to boot...So you are supposing that fusion
guns do not work?

Your privilege.  It seems I won\'t ever be playing with Trav with you as

decide to quit playing, since I consider that a cop-out...

Quite frankly, after the last month of the TNE pocket, and the last few

Lousy approximation.  Better one would be to keep RELATIVE pressures in
similar ratios, so the question then becomes "what happens when we run a
rocket in a vacuum?"  A chemical drive under water compares to a fusion
drive through rock, in other words...

Yes, but you sacrifice efficiency in a major way if you try...


Since relatively few people seem interested in addressing the question I

suspect that I can make the best use of my time by signing off now...

  Absolutely zero soft xrays? Do we know this?

  A reality check on this reveals that if it was true, that fusion reactions
don\'t result in any soft xrays, then the fireball from a fusion weapon would
be proportional to the *fission* part of the yeild and not the whole yield.
  There is no trace in tNoEW of this.

  "Stopped by the nozzle" and exactly how did you intend to make that happen
without a magic force field? Assuming a somwhat decent spread of the exhaust,
the radiation will be below hazardous levels at 50km in deep space, especially
considering the minimum of 5cm of steel all ships have. So the ships will
still not be a traffic hazard in space even if the radiation through the
nozzle isn\'t stopped.

IMPORTANT:
  This leads me to suspect that you have missed my point, more or less.
I have never claimed that the *matter* part of the exhaust would form a
fireball, or that a citykilling plasma jet 50km long would *not* result.

  I was arguing that the *radiation* part of the exhaust (unless stopped by
that radiation-absorbing magic force field of yours) would, through the same
mechanism as in nukes, form a thermal fireball somewhere aft of the ship.
  It is further immaterial wether this fireball moves away from the ship
at whatever speed or not, because as long as the engines are running it will
be replenished by new radiation.

Fearful of starting a religious war Matt says:
The internet worm attacked known bugs in the sendmail transport
system.  It only attacked specific platforms which it had
precompiled binaries available for.

This of course suggests that everyone in the old Traveller universe
ran on a few well known hardware platforms.  This is further supported
by the wide availability of programmes such as \'Jump-1\', \'Jump-2\' and
my personal favorite, \'Anti-Hijaacking\'.

The virus should not be able to attack weird-alien computers such as
the ones onboard the Annic Nova.  Weird-alien (tm) ships suddenly
become much more valuable.  Planets which use WA technology suddenly
have a very favorable ballance of trade.  Time to go make some
notes...

Sounds wrong then, I don\'t care enough for the Star Wars universe. I did
start playing Traveller just because it was the only SF game around, but I 
stuck to it because of the background information that appeared by and by. 
I\'d kinda like to stick to the rules too, but only in order to be able to 
contribute to that background. If not for that I\'d\'ve converted to my own 
home-grown system a long time ago.

No.

That\'s partly because the situation presented does not agree with the laws
of the universe.

Exactly. And that does not really square too well with the entire history
of the Imperium as we know it, does it?

It sounds like you\'ve lost touch with the fact that Traveller is a game, 
not a simulation. The most important thing about a game is that it\'s rules
be _consistent_, not that they be realistic. Realism is _often_ a good 
thing both because realism tends to be consistent (Mother Nature is such a 
stickler for consistency) and because it dosen\'t burden the players\'
willing suspension of disbelief, allowing me to save that up for when it\'s
really needed. But if realism starts infringing on gamability then realism
can take a long walk off a short pier.

Bang goes the Traveller background. Score one against realism.

>Allowing a fusion gun that size near ANY city is INSANE!  

I agree 100%. It is insane unless the city has adequate defenses. Since 
Traveller ships DO land near cities it is unrealistic to assume that such 
defenses does not exist. 

>So ships

But they don\'t, so there is something wrong with the assumptions. Either
ships don\'t use fusion drives or the cities have defenses. QED. (Since a
ship in itself is a pretty horrible weapon even if it is just dropped 
from any appreciable height I suggest that the defenses are the most
reasonable, but perhaps some other explanation can be found.)

Of course there is. I\'m the Referee. If I don\'t want it it doesn\'t happen.
I sure would like a better explanation for my players than \'because I say
so", of course. But I\'ll use that one if I can\'t come up with something
better. I repeat, this is a game, not a simulation.

However, I don\'t really think I want to keep NPCs from toasting anyone they 
like in the Wilds. What I want to protect is the civilization centers without
which there would be no SF role-playing because there would be no SF tech.

What I\'ve cried out for is consistent starship rules. Rules that dosen\'t
(realistically) place huge defense squadrons around every planet in every 
system in any interstellar state, but still allow a motley bunch of PCs
to own a starship, for example.

Steve, the day you provide me a realistic (Even almost realistic. I\'ll give

being sarky about magic and wishful thinking and unrealism. Until then

Come off your high horse, Steve. If you\'re so hung up on realism how can
you play Traveller at all? How can you ignore the horrible travesty of 
the laws of nature that the jump drive is? How can you play in a galaxy
that is apparently a parsec thick? How can you play TCS with such an
unrealistic economic system? (Even with the improvements you\'ve made it
is still rather unrealistic.) You\'re no more hung up on realism than I
am, your priorities are just different. My priorities are 1) making the
game fun, and 2) trying to save the Traveller Imperium background (if
possible). Oh yeah, and 3) contributing to Aoreriyya (I sometimes wish 
I hadn\'t gotten my interest caught there. It would be much easier to
crush the Rebellion, teach the Vargr a lesson, work out a modus vivendi 
with the Aslans, and get on with my campaign without bothering about TNE
at all).

Sounds good. I suppose that moving the spaceports away from the main cities
is not much of a retcon, given how few planetary maps we have (for if the
cities rely on defense batteries then they wouldn\'t allow fusion powered
ships closer than they would have time to shoot them down over relatively
open land (or sea). How far would you say a starport should be from 
anything you really want to protect?)

Greetings all,

           From what I have heard about TNE, traveller has been retconned to
reduce the level of technology to a level mostly understandable to us in the
20th century. I personally don\'t agree with this, as I would prefer a less
than glacial rate of technological advance in a SF setting which means that
there would have been many new developments by the 58th century. The idea that
we could understand the basic principles of 90% of 58th century technology 
right now is to me unbelievable. Discovery of entirely new technologies will
make gadgets which seem magic to us (Clarke\'s Law). While I can understand the
reluctance in some people to have such devices, given the time span involved
there will have to be some, and their position is as "realistic" as any other.
From what I hear, the best personal weaponry in TNE is pretty much advanced
versions of what is in existence now-not much SF about that. 
 
          Of course, once a "magic" technology is introduced, its development
and synthesis with other technologies can have major ramifications. For
instance in MT I considered the advance in fusion power efficiencies
at high TL to be partly due to Black Globe technology being used for power
conversion purposes. If force-fields can be generated, they too could be used
in fusion plants (and rockets). And since the magic techologies are arbitrary,
such as the jump drive itself, people will not agree on them.
 
         Incidentally a SF novel I once read had a conspiracy theory intended
to stultify scientific and technological progress, prevent colonisation and 
promote financial and social stability. The reasoning was that the rich and 
powerful benefit from the status quo and are naturally conservative. Any
technological advance or expansion of frontiers would be taken advantage of by
those who had more to gain than to lose ie the poor, and the net result would
be that the rich would proportionally decrease in power and influence. So has
anyone ever heard of a starfaring state with a rigid power structure, slow
technological advance and very limited expansion prospects?
 
          If I run TNE most of the ships in MY universe won\'t have fusion
rockets, but that is my choice. Other people can do what they want to, and
good luck to them.  After all, it is only a game : )

    'body' => '     Jim Baranski brought up a point in the big fusion
debate that I was thinking of too, but didn\'t have time to 
post until now.

Are starship engines fusion rockets, or did someone jump the gun
  with an assumption?

Evidence from T:TNE to indicate fusion rockets:

     1) pg. 224: reference to "reaction mass" for in-system
          travel fuel.
     2) G-hour concept:  Maneuver drives have high fuel consumption.

     3) pg 365, speeder description:  speeder powered by fusion
          reactor, "Contra-grav units provide lift while a fusion-
          powered jet provides thrust." (similar to ships?)

      4) In all ship and vehicle descriptions, Contra-grav is
          mentioned, thruster plates are not.

Evidence against:

     I think I remember ONE mention of thruster plates outside
of the technology section, but since I can\'t find it right now,
I\'ll have to discount it.  If anyone else finds it, let me know.

OK, so it\'s all clear they use fusion rockets, right?
   Well, maybe not. Take a look at it this way:
(from above)
     4) _NO_ form of propulsive system is mentioned except
        for the speeder (and G-carrier, which has an "ignition
        chamber", but I left it out because it doesn\'t use
        fusion power).  So it doesn\'t explicitly state
        "fusion rockets" either.

     3) a "fusion powered jet" may be an air-breather that
        uses the fusion plant to super-heat the air before
        release as exhaust.  Does not need to be a fusion
        rocket itself. (I never saw anyone arguing for this,
        with perhaps one exception, but this may have
        prompted folks to simply assume a fusion rocket.

     2) the G-hour concept seems to have been added simply
        to force some kind of endurance limits on ships.
        ? Maybe thruster plates chew up gobs of fuel when
        activated?.

     1) Reaction mass: potential sloppy terminology on 
          GDW\'s part. Not like it\'s never happened before.

Summary: My real, non-stretching-the-point thoughts:

   The fusion rocket approach seems to make too much trouble
     for the old \'Traveller feel\' most of us know and
     love.  Starports more often resembled Mos Eisley rather 
     than Cape Canaveral.  Sure, you could smash your ship
     into a city, but there were no big regulations keeping
     them from the area of cities, lest they start up the drives.

I _REALLY_ hope they aren\'t using the \'rocket\' approach to
    maneuver drives.  The grav/thruster plate approach is
    well embedded in classic Traveller material, and I\'m 
    going to be in a royal blue funk if I have to convert
    everything from rocket to thruster plate technology
    myself when the architecture manual comes out.

I\'d need to know chamber pressure to work that in detail, which I am
unwilling to do for a fusion rocket.  However, rule of thumb is that
the plume will "rapidly" expand until it\'s internal pressure is equal
to outside atmospheric pressure, and will extend very roughly for
Isp * (Isp/33)^0.5 meters long, which gives us... [nevermind, 
the fomula breaks down at these Isp values...]

I\'m more worried about the cosmic ray radiation than the plume, though.

Ships take off and land from starports just like they do in the old
trav days.  With a few details that have been left off:

The ship lifts on contra-grav until it reaches a safe altitude to
engage the drives at LOW power.  The ship maneuvers to a safe area
(and continues climbing) and then throttles up to the desired
thrust level.

The flight path is heavily guarded by \'shore batteries\'.  Deviating
just may get you blown to smithereens.  It also uses a nuclear
damper to help dispose of the scattered radiation of the drives.

The drives work just fine in the atmosphere, and even underwater
(like they used to do in the old Trav days...)

They can, if a pilot is crazy enough, be used to incinerate a large area,
and are possibly the most lethal of weapons.

However, any Referee worth his salt will not put the players in a situation
where using the drive as a weapon will be useful.  And if the drive would
be useful it is not available.   Also, if the players actually did
misuse the drive, then there are all sorts of nasty things that Referee\'s
can do to them.

Check your Traveller collections.  You will not find a single adventure
there where a huge heavy weapon was needed and a starship drive was
available.  (INCLUDING Double Adventure 6  Horde/Chamax Plague.  The
ship was disabled and not flyable.)

MegaTraveller is a different story.  There, there was call for heavy
nasty superweapons.  But we aren\'t Playing that game any more.  Now
there is no call for such weapons.  So why worry about a weapon that
is basically useless?

Forget the damn PCs. They are not the problem. PCs can be dealt with
in other ways (like placing 3000 missile launchers and/or nuclear 
dampers around the places you don\'t want them to torch ;-) (or even
just informing them that you don\'t enjoy running games with homicidal
maniac PCs)). The problem is letting such weapons into the hands of
the space-age equivalent of truck drivers. Given the number of crazies

if that were so. _That\'s why I don\'t want common space jockeys to have

Oh, so you do consider the fusion drive a problem? I got the impression
that your opinion about that was "It\'s lethal and so what?". OK, in
what way do you consider it a problem and what solution do you suggest?

How so? Wildstar dosen\'t want fusion drives used in atmosphere and he
informs his players that contrary to what is thought today it turns out
that there are insurmountable difficulties with using fusion drives in
atmosphere. A yet unknown effect, perhaps. Or the physical laws of his
universe differs a tad from those of the Real World. So what? As long
as he informs his players about any different rules and applies them
consistently the game dosen\'t suffer.

Two completely different things. If it becomes too difficult to calculate
it will almost certainly be detrimental to the game, but there are lots
of instances where too much accuracy is detrimental to the game even if
it\'s easy to calculate. 

You appear to regard realism as an end in itself. I happen to regard it 
as a means to an end.

  Your criticism is disingenious, because as I\'m sure you are aware of,
a Free Trader at 1G uses *excatly the same amount of fuel* per hour as
a Scout at 2G (which is the combination of ship and situation I did my
calculations on).
  Also, the 25.6kt is an absolute upper limit assuming 100% fusion. That 
sounds hard to accomplish, so the effective output figure could easily
be half of this, or smaller.

  But if we assume that Grandfather sneak around on the yards at night and
install small anti-matter boosters in all ships, then the 30Kt figure is
acceptable.

Nope. The jet moves at or perhaps *somewhat* faster than the detonation
velocity.  The problem is that the missile is moving faster than the
jet can progate! (Yes, the jet\'s speed *does* add to that of the
missile. but not significantly) The effects of the missile acting as a
penetrator overwhelm it. (Why do you suppose those HEAP pentration
curves flatten out?!)

Not quite.  KEAP is kind of useless agains a ground target - it has lots
of energy, but doesn\'t deliver it in the most useful form.  So HE will
be around as a ground attach missile that just happens to have a
secondary anti-ship role.

I was *specificly* discussing ship-to-ship combat.

And as Bertil points out, you can always choose *not* to detonate the
explosive, after all - it\'s still got it\'s kinetic energy.

Yes, but it doesn\'t deliver as efficiently as something more solid would.


Now as to the fusion rockets...

Going with 20,000 km/s exhaust velocity and 480 gm/s fuel comsumption I
come up with the following:

Assuming 1 gram per cubic *meter* as the density of the exhaust (a
figure that is probably *way* too low), a simple calculation gives a
jet diameter of 5.5 *millimeters*. That much energy in that small an
area is *not* going to slowed by any atmosphere on the mainworld
charts.

I also *seriously* doubt that it\'ll be slowed by rock. Not for the
first few meters anyway. As I noted long ago, a fusion rocket exhaust
will cheerfully bore a hole in whatever you land on. And with such a
small diameter, landing legs aren\'t neaerly the problem that has been
assumed. So what if you\'ve got a puddle of boiling rock a few meters
across?  Especially since it may be subsurface.


About the virus:

Someone was wondering how a current day network could be immune from
infection as someone else had claimed.

It\'s actually quite simple. With most (if not all) LAN software out there,
only the *supervisor* has write access to the directories containing
the globally available executables (files in your *personal* directory
are your own problem). A user *cannot* change them NOR CAN A VIRUS
RUNNING ON HIS SYSTEM. This is because all access to the servers drives
is by means of sending *commands* that are executed by the software
running on the server. The server checks to see if you are allowed to
use the commands *before* it executes them.

We had several viruses get loose on a Novell LAN. They *only* infected
the directories of a few people that had given each other *write*
access to their directories. And several hard drives got infected when
someone would log on from the infected accounts. But the rate of spread
was slow.

Now if the supervisor equivalent accounts had logged in from an
infected machine, things could have been messy. But that\'s *why* you
are careful about such things.

If we can safeguard things that well at this TL, I rather doubt that
later TLs will allow the sort of stupidity required for the Virus to spread.

There\'s a relationship between size/mass & velocity that basicly says
if it is big enough and fast enough, then as the leading part
vaporizes, the rest punches on through the plasma. That\'s what the
meteorite protection schemes are based on. The small stuf vaporizes on
impact with the foil shield. The bigger stuff punches through, losing a
portion of its mass.

I picked it because the missiles are suipposedly *7* tons according to

Actually, it *will* work worse that something denser will. It\'s too
easy to vaporize the explosive. :-)

But we have designs on the drawing boards *now* for orbit to ground KE
weapons (project Thor was one about 15 years back). You have to design
a bit differently, but it is easily done. I *do* agree that you can\'t
use space-to-space munitions as space-to-ground munitions.

Please do. Though I expect that they are within a factor of 2 which ios
*more* than adequate. :-)

BTW, that Sprint missile Wildstar mentions had accelerations in the
*hundreds* of Gs. I see no reason why they can\'t build that sort of
acceleration into missiles at TL 15. And with a fusion rocket, you
could get a reasonable duration without outrageous amounts of fuel.

Try dodging a 200 g missile sometime. :-)

(Heck, a Sprint could ruin your whole day even if you *were* a TL15
wonder. :-)


More on landing a fusion rocket....

Just either land on CG, or run the drive at something *incredibly*
inefficient using the plasma to heat something else (LH2? Air?) which
gets dumped out secondary nozzles at some horribly "low" Isp like
400-1000 (a fusion version of NERVA). That explains the need for an
areodynamic shape, as you *can\'t* just ride down the jet without
wasting *lots* of fuel (this isn\'t as importnat if you are using "air"
as the working fluid).

"clearing the throat" of the big jet would likely make anybody in the
vicinity *real* unhappy. :-)

BTW, the fusion drive *doesn\'t* have to be continous. It could be
pulsed fusion, though that doesn\'t match well with the high Isp.

Want a *real* nightmare? Under the old rules at the *high* tech levels,
there was a mention of "photon rockets" or some such. This is a *very*
high Isp drive. It\'s also dangerous as hell, because it amounts to
having a laser as your drive. Sit down and figure out the energy
density required of a laser that can drive a ship at 6 gs. Then figure
out what happens to anything that gets in the way. :-)

I see several people arguing that "But you objected to the thruster
plates and now you object to the fusion drives..." or similar
arguments.

What the "realism" folks objected to about the MT thruster plates was
not *primarily* that they were reactionless. That\'s no worse than the
jump drive. It makes for some problems in trying to calculate what can
and can\'t be done, because you can\'t be sure *how* it suprcedes the
currently known laws of physics (note: it is an ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY that
any "new laws of physics discovered will *include* the currently know
ones as "special cases" that apply UNDER THE CONDITIONS WE HAVE
CURRENTLY CHECKED. Just as Relativistic Physics *includes* Newtonian
Physics as a "special case for speeds below 1% of c)

Anyway, the problem with reactionless drives was that as described in
the rules, they used far less energy than they gave to the ship. That
plays hell with *any* sort of history of the Imperium, because anybody
who\'d taken high school physics could see this, and use it to do things
that\'d result in a far different universe than we see.

They *also* allowed anybody with a Scout ship to wreck entire *worlds*,
not just cities (check the archives for my posts on what a relativitic
missile does to a planet!)

Anybody who thinks I\'m being silly here has never gamed with player who
will sit down with the rules and exploit them to the max. I\'m not
talking about "rules lawyers as much as brilliant opportunists. "Hey
look! Nobody has noticed that you can do X! And it\'s even *legal*".
And if players can notice it, some bright boy in the Imperium would
have noticed it a thousand years ago.

Now they\'ve solved both those problems. Though the drive is *still*
apparently about 5 times as good as the best figures I ever heard
claimed. :-)

Now we just have cities to worry about, not entire worlds. And there
may be ways of doing that. But any approach that amounts to introducing
*real* nagic, as opposed to unknown physics doesn\'t belong here.

I consider "real magic" to be anything that insists that the currently
known laws of physics don\'t apply under conditions that have already
beeen observed. Which means that fusion rockets will not and cannot be
harmless. But their effects may be more or less limited than has been
supposed.

BTW, the objection that it seems unreasonable for things that far in
the future to be based on principles that we can understand is rather
silly. A *Roman* engineer could understand much of the operating
principles of a car or truck. He\'d not understand *why* the cylinders
moved up and down, or any of the electrical system. But everything else
would be quite clear. The worksmanship would be astounding, but the
principles of mechanics have been known for several thousand years...

Likewise we can\'t understand how they can get the fusion reaction to
occur, nor how they can confine it. But after that, things follow well
known principles. Give us a few numbers and we can tell you what that
fusion rocket will do.

We can\'t understand the jump drive. But we don\'t need to. And
Contragravity may be non-understandabler, but its *effects* are easily
figured.

Yes, it is just a game. But *any* game where the rules don\'t match
reality is going to get itself into tyrouble because this *will* set up
internal contradictions. We "realism freaks" would prefer to find and
correct these thiongs *before* they bite us.

Oh yes, please note that modern ships and planes are about as dangerous
as Traveller starships in reference to the culture. A 707 can make a
decent bomber. And the Soviet cargo and passenger planes up thru the
70s or 80s were *designed* with the equivalent odf "hard points"!
Likewise an average freighter has a powerplant comparable to that of a
small town! In the future, there is no reason not to expect things to
be similar.

Just for fun, figure out what a mach 2 airliner could do to an average
town if it made a *low* level pass at mach 2. (Answer, the shock wave
would *flatten* most frame houses and cause *major* structural damage to
everything else!) Yet we\'d not consider having one of these in private
hands to be all that dangerous.

I maintain that IN PROPORTION TO THE CULTURE\'S ENERGY USE AND SIZE, a
starship with a fusion rocket (if that\'s what they use) is no more
dangerous.

Think back over our history here on earth. We\'ve had aircraft and
shipping disasters of a size that would *horrify* folks a few hundred
years ago. (like the jumbo jet that crashed into a residential
neighborhood  here about 15 years back. Wiped out 4 block, plus all the
passengers). Or the Texas City disaster where *one* freighter took out
most of a city. The idea of one man controlling something thast could
kill *thousand* of people, and having it accepted as commonplace WOULD
NOT HAVE BEEN BELIEVED. But we do.

So why is it so hard to believe thaty a culture with populations in the
*trillions* (or possibly qudrillions?) is not going to think much of a
vehicle that is relatively speaking, about as hard to get as a
freighter or jumbo jet, could destroy a few million people if the
operator chose to?

Tracked Scout Exploration Vehicle was redesigned for use in Vaccum conditions.
With a starship quality air-lock, and total life support, the Bear is
considered to be the equivalent of a light tank in use with the Scout Service.
Protection is provided by a single 2 Mw Pulse Laser, mounted on top of the
vehicle in a closed turret. Capable of carrying 6 passengers, the seats can be
removed to provide extra cargo room, sacrificing the speed of the vehicle. The

fthe flamewar, I\'ve tried this before, and my answers allways stink)
I tried using the kinetic theory of gasses to get a figure for the
temperature.  Somebody tell me if I\'m wrong:

First F=ma

Assume a 100t spaceship weighs 100 metric tons (10^5 kg) (no way, it\'s
a lot more than that, but bear with me). a = 10m/s^2 (1 g more or
less) Thus F = 10^6N

F = dp/dt (change in momenum w.r.t time)

dp/dt = dm/dt (mass of gas expelled per second) V (speed of gas
molecules)

From an earlier post dm/dt = 500 g/s = .5 kg/s

Thus 10^6N = 0.5 kg/s * 2*10^6m/s

inother words the rocket exhaust to be "non-reactionless" has to be
traveling at 2 million meters a second (2/3 % of the speed of light).

According to the kinetic theory of gasses V = (RT/M)^.5 where R is the
gas constant (8 J/mol K) T is the temperature and M the molecular mass
of the gas.  Thus, T = (V^2)*(M/R). M = .001 kg/mol, r=8 , M/R ~ 10^-4
this means if V=10^6 then V^2=10^12 and T must be on the order of 100
MILLION degrees.  

Even if this is kept in a magnetic bottle, it\'s black body radiation
will melt anything.  The peak frequency in the blackbody distribution
is at 10^20 Hz at that temperature.  The wavelength is on the order of
a hundreth of an angstrom (well into the X-Ray region).  

This seems a *bit* odd to me, could someone please check my physics (I
will admit to using some simplyfying assumptions that could introduce
errors in my calculations, generally I tried to err on the side of
conservativism.  But even if I\'m off by _4 orders of magnitude_ we
need temperatures ten times what is found on the surfaces of the
hottest stars.

To be honest, if I\'m right, I prefer the thruster plates.  They make
much more sense.  Somebody tell me what I did wrong.

Some other people have finally begun to make the same suggestion that I\'ve
  been thinking about for the last few days, but had yet to get around to
  posting to the list.  To wit - given the many difficulties with putting
  fusion drives in private hands, compared with the relative simplicity of
  dealing with good ol\' thruster plates (once that nasty thing about
  conservation of energy is fixed, keeping them from being perpetual motion
  machines)...

Why not just assume that TNE ships are driven by thruster plates?  Hungry
  ones, to be sure, compared with what they used to be (in the already
  much-broken MT rules), but this can only be a good thing.  The fact that
  their fuel consumption and other figures happen to resemble those of
  fusion rockets doesn\'t necessarily mean anything.

Much simpler, yes?

I agree that keeping things realistic is a good way of keeping them
consistent. I\'ll even agree that deviating from reality is _likely_
to set up internal contradictions. But I do not agree that it *will*,
absolutely, set up internal contradictions. 

And as I\'ve stated before, what a game needs is consistency, not realism.
There are aspects of reality that makes a SF RPG less fun.

Its not hard to believe. Its just hard to believe that it would create
a culture like the Traveller Imperium. After all, whenever we\'ve had 
disasters like the ones you describe steps are usually taken to avoid a 
repetition of same (or at least to minimize the chance of a repetition). 
And so far we\'ve not had any examples of terrorists crashing aircraft 
into residental areas. Logically the fact that terrorists have been
known to make suicide runs in trucks should make people wary of how
aircarft could be used the same way, but most people are not logical.
Steps to avoid aircraft suicide runs won\'t be taken until such runs
are made. But it is my belief that steps _will_ be taken afterwards.
So picture the Traveller societies after 10,000 years of space travel.
Do you think that _noone_ would have tried to use a starship for a
weapon in all that time? It\'s possible, I suppose, but I consider it
damn unrealistic.

points for me?
 
Extended System Generation
 
1)  Step #6, Companion Star Type and Size.
        It says:  "DM For Type:  Use the previous roll for primary star
type as a +DM."  So if I rolled an 8 for my primary star, then I should
add 8 to my roll for the companion star?  What happens when I get values
above 12, which is bound to happen?  Do I simply round down to 12?  Or
do I reroll results not listed?
 
2)  Step #20, Orbit Zones for Luminosity Class D
        Okay, so there are only four orbits available.  What do I do when 
I
roll four gas giants, three empty orbits, planetoid belts, etc for this
system?  There is simply no place to put them all.
 
3)  What happens when you roll all the habitable zones as being empty?
Scrap the system and start over?
 
4)  Step #13-20, Orbit Zones
        Say I have a G3 star.  Do I round down to G0, or do I use G5?
 
5)  This one really gets to me.  For a number of the steps in the 
Mainworld
Generation and Extended System Generation systems, it is possible to roll
values outside of those listed, and most of the time you are not told 
what
to do when this happens.  Examples?
 
- --The adjusted atmosphere roll can be as high as 24, but the table only
covers up to 15.
 
- --The Hydrographics roll can be as high as 24, but the table only goes
up to 10.
 
- --The Government roll can be as high as 22, but the table only goes up
to 15.
 
- --The pattern repeats for Law Level, and in the Extended System
Generation System, Step #4, #6 (as detailed above), and #7.
 
 
6)  What\'s the Black Curtain.  I dunno, it isn\'t mentioned anywhere 
in the book.  Looks neat, though.

Well, I get about the same numbers, or higher (work it out for a spaceship
mass of 1900 metric tons ... 3.8e7 m/s or about 0.13c ... yipes!  *That\'s*
a free trader?).

In any case, I called Dave Nilsen and asked him (without filling him in on
this discussion, and without outlining our various scenarios to him) how
the "Fusion Rockets" in T:TNE worked.  I did mention that I was concerned
about radiation and hot plasma effects.

Dave\'s answer was that the drive uses a heat exchange system to heat LH2
in the thrust chamber using energy from the fusion reactor.  No fusion,
no radiation, no massive damage.

There you have it; it\'s not physics (but then again, the "new era" space
drives obey physics about as much as the thruster plates and agaility
generators of MegaTraveller ---- as Bertil pointed out, its about as sane
as arguing if AD&D "Magic Missiles" travel on a ballistic path).  It is
however, a playable game mechanic.

The great thing about Traveller is that as a role-playing game, and as a
story under control of the storyteller (referee); if this answer bugs you
or your players, you *are* perfectly fee to come up with your own 
rationalization, and your own game ruling.  After all, it\'s your game.

\'nuff said from me on this thread; I\'ve got more important things to do.

I finally picked up TNE and have been thumbling through it. It is a
touch thick.

Anyway, I may have made a few assumptions that just are incorrect. I
assumed that TNE is kinda-maybe-sorta-almost-at-least-a-little-bit 
compatible with the older Travellar stuff. MT was pretty much an
evolutionary product whereas TNE is a revolutionary product. At its
core, TNE has bascially nothing to do with MT and before. The data in
Survival Margin on converting from MT to TNE would have been just as
apllicable if it was written for "MT to GURPS".

Clearly, there is some remnant from MT to TNE -- Animals, Trade, World
Generation, etc. From the discussions (agruments? Flame Fests?) that
have been happening recently, its apparent that some rather drastic
shifts in Starship technology have happened. For example, I assumed
that when they mentioned the nuke-laser missile as the "generic
missile", that this was the "generic missile" that we\'ve always used.
But it distrubed me because the Imperium did not allow such prolific
use of nuclear technology. And if that was the case, then missile
turrets would not be common. I was concerned more with the past than
the future.

I think that the system has changed enough that the "feel" of the game
is no longer what it was. From the change in mechanics to the trashing
of the Imperium, "Toto, we\'re not in Deneb any more". TNE is a
different game. It\'s as different from Travellar as 2300 was. 

But, I guess this is GDW\'s goal. A blurb in the Tech section of TNE
mentions that when the Architecture Manual comes out, it will describe
various different technologies that "CAN" happen. Thruster Plates,
Stutterwarp, and FTL communications all seem to be in this one
cohesive manual. TNE presents the Official GDW Universe, but
individual players can dump the jump drive and use stutterwarp
instead. 

I guess GDW felt that the Imperium was too dominating and that new
players/refs felt they had to know the entire history so that they
could play their adventure "right". I liked the Imperium. I think
there has been more talk on this list about the ficticious Imperium
than the current spat of rules-talk we\'re going through now. The
Imperium may have been as attractive to some as it was overbearing to
others.

But on the other side of the coin, I think people play games as much
for their atmosphere as for their mechanics. that if a group
really liked a particular game, but had specific problem with it, they
would keep the environ and just change the rules. GDW changed both
with TNE.

TNE could easily be called Twilight 1200: The New Era. You\'re in post
armageddon known space. The Imperium is dead, but so what -- you were
never in it. Technology is lost -- but who cares, you\'ve never known
it, except maybe as campfire tales. For those still in the thick of
the Old Imperium, in the Regency; It\'s changed from the free
wheeling hope and commerce filled universe of your grand parents to a 
police state surrounded by ancient enemies. The people know it, and 
they feel it -- but for you, it\'s always been that way. It\'s a time
where misery and oppression prevails thoughout. Where strangers from
the stars obliterate your local tyrant and replace it with one of
their own, for your own good. So we can play either the oppressor or
the oppressed. Sign me up.

I am hopeful for the TA manual. The TA manual will be the link
that allows the older Travellar stuff to work with the new mechanics.
I like Travellar with the Johnny Quest flare. Ships landing with a
loud hum instead of nuclear hell. 

I think that there must be a way to make the G-Turns and reaction mass
and all of the f=ma stuff we\'ve been flinging around work with our
fanciful clean drives and Jump systems. I mean, if all else fails I
guess when a player asks "How do the M-Drives work?", we can always
answer: "Well, you see that knob on the dash next to the ON switch?
That\'s how it works."

Echoing Bruce, what does retcon mean?

NEGATIVE MATTER

The matter we are all used to is, according to Einstein, all positive matter.
This means it exerts a force on all other matter directly proportional to its
mass and inversely proportional to the separation (no, really, it does!).

Negative matter simply has *negative* mass, so that the force is negative, or 
*repels* all other matter.  This is *not* anti-matter, which so far only has 
been found with positive mass.

In some book I read (I can\'t remember the name, but can find out), someone 
proposed a spaceship drive which involved mounting a plate of negative matter
next to a plate of positive matter, and then charging the two.  The result is
a forward force, although I\'m not sure why.

	+ve matter <----
	pulls	__        __
		| |       | |
		| |	  | |
		|+|	  |-|
		| |       | |
		| |	  | |
         -ve matter <----
	pushes

As we have two forces pushing in the same direction, and the plates are braced
to stop them coming together or apart (if the masses were unmtached)(in fact
unmtached masses may make this work better).  I really don\'t know what 
difference the electric charge makes, but as gravity is a weak force, it
presumably enhances the overall effect somehow.  The result seems to be that
modulating the charge changes that thrust.  Sounds a bit like a thruster plate
to me!

This works even better if you consider Classic Trav gravitics to work on an
`amplifying gravitons\' basis.  All you have to do is amplify the number of
negative gravitons streaming off your negative matter thruster plate, and you
have thrust (I think).

The same problem exists in every sector with published routes, with the
obvious exception of the "old" sectors- the Marches, Solomani Rim, and
Old Expanses.
   While checking this, I came upon another WS problem--the lack of them.
The Old Expanses has 9, the Spinward Marches has 6 (for 10 Imperial
subsectors). In contrast, most sectors have 3 or 4, even though they
represent the oldest, most settled regions of the Imperium. Considering
the WS\'s function as major maitainence and routing facilities for the X-boat
network, these popuplous sectors seem shortchanged. Naturally this is a 
result of the way they were generated, but obviously the generation program
did not generate WS\'s with a frequency consistent with previously published
material.
   My solution: Following the "least intrusive" dictum for making changes, 
I suggest the best solution is to reposition the WS\'s onto the mapped
network. Existing WS\'s off-route would be downgraded to normal scout bases.
The number of WS\'s in a sector would be determined, generally 1 per 
2 Imperial-controlled subsectors. These would be placed either by upgrading
existing on-route scout bases or by placing new bases on the route, 
preferably at the junction of 3 or more routes.
   Some sectors still have a higher than average ratio of WS\'s to Imperial
subsectors, but these can be explained by the requirements of that sector.
For example, the Marches need home ports for the IISS\'s long-ranged criuser-
sized vessels which ply the regions to spinward, surveying, collecting
intelligence, and maintaining contact with the scattered client states in
the area. On the other hand, Core, as the administrative and communications
hub of the Imperium, needs more to handle the increased traffic load.
  Here is a list of the WS\'s listed in "AotI", followed by a new list for
several sectors I have X-boat maps to, or could extrapolate from Rebellion
Era maps.

PROPOSED NEW WAY STATION LOCATIONS

The Marches, Solomani Rim, Old Expanses, and Reaver\'s Deep, due to the length

  The only sectors on this list are ones I either had pre-Rebellion maps for,
or could reconstruct from rebellion maps.

Magyar----(2):2810,3128


More to follow if I can get ahold of the Imperial-Era maps.

   Of course, by the time of the New Era, this is pretty much moot, but any-
one running a classic- or rebellion-era game might find it useful.

     =======
          I am enclosing in this post an except from a letter by Dave 
     Nilsen.  I hope it answers some of your questions about the nuclear 
     pumped missiles.  The actual yield of each weapon can be found on a 
     table in the starship weapon portion of the equipment section. Re: 
     nuclear detonation lasers. I understand your misgivings, and let me 
     say at the outset that your concerns about the overabundance of nukes 
     is well-taken. However, the use of the Imperial Laws of War to explain 
     why nukes were never used before was, I always thought, a very
     artificial and unsatisfactory device. Nukes would have been easily 
     obtainable at Imperial tech levels, as they are now. But we will need 
     to come up with more convincing reasons for why people don\'t use them 
     than the long arm of the law. I would think that the vivid example of 
     84 years of civil war and virus rampage (there are still hundreds or 
     thousands of radioactively hot worlds) might have convinced people to 
     be a little more thoughtful.
     
          Second, HE missiles and deadfall ordnance are still in wide use 
     for orbital bombardment. However, HE missiles just don\'t make any 
     sense at all for starship combat. I kept trying to keep them in, but 
     they always required a lot of unconvincing rationalizations that, at 
     the end, were only to retain HE missiles because we used to say that 
     there were HE missiles. Why don\'t they work?
     
          First of all, those eenie little 50 kg missiles we used to know 
     and love are a pathetic joke in a game that now uses reaction mass for 
     vector movement. A 50 kg missile has no capacity for maneuver, and 
     therefore no capacity to hit a target. Therefore, missiles need to be 
     bigger in order to have the range to hit targets at the range we used 
     to tell people they work at (remember how missiles were supposed to 
     work better at longer ranges, while lasers, etc., worked better at 
     short ranges?). Bigger missiles equal bigger targets for point defense 
     batteries, and equal fewer missiles carried by the firing vessel. Once 
     we worked out the physics required for lasers to hit targets at the 
     ranges we had always blithely assumed lasers could hit targets at, it
     became absolutely ludicrous to assume that a missile would ever get 
     close enough to its target to actually make physical contact with it, 
     as an HE missile would. All of a sudden, it was pointless for ships to 
     carry missiles at all, except for planetary bombardment. The only way 
     to keep missiles in the game at all was to make them detonation 
     lasers.  This also had the effect that Traveller will be easier to 
     dovetail with 2300 when the time comes, but this was a by-product of 
     the other requirements, not the cause for the decision.

     M.GELINAS [Geo]              at 04:04 EDT
      
     I previously sent the following to a number of people by e-mail.  I 
     post it here for the benefit of all.
     
     Comments on Traveller: The New Era
     
     Opening comments:
     
     Overall, Traveller: The New Era (TNE) is an excellent product.  The 
     writing is well done, information sections are concise and 
     informative, and the rules are remarkably detailed.  The artwork if 
     very good overall.  Some of the art is mediocre, and some of the art 
     was borrowed from previous products, but most of the work was good, 
     and there were a number of excellent pieces, including both the front 
     and back covers.
     
     I have made this overall observation up front, because the remainder 
     of this review will be general comments intended to improve an already 
     excellent product.  It is ever my intent to offer constructive 
     criticism to make Traveller a better game.  Therefore for each item 
     which I feel is a problem, I will offer a solution.  Since most of 
     these solutions will be similar, I will summarize them here and use an 
     abbreviated form in the text to save space.
     
     My recommended solutions area:
     
     Errata sheet - it is extremely difficult to produce a product the size 
     of TNE without some errors creeping in.  I recommend that an errata 
     sheet be published and made available to players. This sheet should 
     also be printed in Challenge magazine and included in the TNE Deluxe.
     
     Chart book - I recommend that some of the more important charts be 
     reprinted in a small (16 page or so) booklet form and include in TNE 
     Deluxe or be included in a TNE Screen. (I know that GDW is no longer 
     doing folios, but I think the demand for a TNE screen would warrant 
     the production of this product)
     
     Revised Character Generation Worksheet - I recommend a few things be 
     added to the Character Generation Worksheet.  It could be included in 
     Deluxe TNE or printed in Challenge.
     
     Page 17 - Homeworld Random Generation Table:  the DM chart is on the 
     next page making it easy to overlook and difficult to use.  
     Recommendation - put on the same page in Chart Book.
     
     Page 18 - Homeworld DM Table - with a DM of +9 for characters in the 
     wilds, it is not possible with a 2D6 roll to get a starport class D.  
     This will result in a lot of starport class X for characters in the 
     wilds.  While this is probably representative of the types of 
     starports there, it is probably not representative of the types of 
     worlds that the PC\'s will come from in the wilds.  Recommendation - 
     add a statement that the referee can lower the DM for the wilds or 
     mandate a specific starport. Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 18 - Homeworld DM Table - The DM for Old Expanses is HIGHER than 
     for a Pocket Empire.  Recommendation: This should be reversed. Errata 
     Sheet.
     
     Page 18 - Homeworld Characteristic Description Table - while specific
     descriptions for specific numbers can be found in the world building 
     section, no such correlation can be found anywhere for government 
     Type.  Below is my supposition:
     
     Description   Code Normal         Code Wilds 
           Low Gov       0 - 3              0 - 3 
           Mod Gov       4 - 5              4 - 5 
           High Gov      6 - 8              6 - 7 
           Ext Gov       9 +                8 +
     
     Since the only difference between Normal worlds and Wilds worlds 
     occurs at 8+, a uniform table could be built by making the Wilds 
     descriptions correspond to the normal description.
     
     Recommendation: Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 19 - Homeworld Effects on Attributes - buried in text. 
     Recommendation - Table in Chart Book and Note on Revised CG Worksheet.
     
     Page 23 - Background Skills - not noted on Character Generation Sheet. 
     Recommendation - Note on Revised CG Worksheet.
     
     Page 24 - Default Skills - buried in text.  Recommendation - Table in 
     Chart Book and Note on Revised CG Worksheet.
     
     Page 57 - Table of Ranks - Military Ranks - At only 1 promotion per 
     term, it will take a significant number of terms to achieve a higher 
     rank in military. While this may be reasonable for officers, it is not 
     for enlisted. Recommendation - Use shorter enlisted rank structure as 
     per T2K2.  Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 94 - Wilds careers - Recommend adding a Psionic Priesthood career 
     and a Survivalist Career.  The latter at least is one a PC in the 
     wilds would probably be interested in.  Publish in Challenge or in 
     Deluxe TNE.
     
     Page 172 - Ershur Data - the TPPG data for Towering has been shifted 
     to the left.  Recommendation - Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 186 - Step 4 - The planetary density table is way over on page 
     190.  Recommend adding a note.  Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 186 - World Size 2D6?  Have you dropped the -2? Recommendation - 
     Errata Sheet (if appropriate).
     
     Page 186 - Tech Level DM tables - From B on down, some of the columns 
     have been shifted.  The DM\'s for Atmosphere appear under World Size.  
     The -2 for one of the governments is also shifted.  Recommendation - 
     Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 187 - Has Lo been changed to a population of 4-? Recommendation 
     if not - Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 188 - Should Population of 0 be classified as Incidental to 
     coincide with the Homeworld Generation Table? This table also shows a 
     Population of 4 as Moderate which conflicts if Lo has been changed to 
     Pop of 4-. Recommendation - keep Lo at 3-, make Pop 0 incidental - 
     Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 189 - World Law Level 6 - "All Firearms except Firearms" 
     Recommendation - change the last firearms to rad "Shotguns".  Errata 
     Sheet.
     
     Page 189 - World Physical Data - describes a Hydrographics of 3 as 
     "Dry" this should be "Wet".  Recommendation - Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 201 - Fuel - Discusses multiple fuel vehicles, but none are 
     listed in the book.  Recommendation - if any of the vehicles in the 
     book can use multiple fuels, add codes by Errata Sheet.  If not, 
     publish some multiple fuel vehicles in a future product.
     
     Page 228 - 229 - Starship Encounters - The DM\'s for ship encounters in 
     the Wilds would seem to produce an alarming number of Vampire ships. 
     Recommendation - adding note to the effect that the referee should not 
     feel obligated to implement a vampire, but treat the encounter as "No 
     Encounter" if he choses.  Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 237 - There are some worlds which do not have any trade codes.  
     This page does not indicate which table should be used in such a case. 
      Recommendation - add a note that if a world has no trade codes, use 
     the last table.  Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 258 - Recommend creating a set of charts showing the effects of 
     different power levels for psionic skills - Chart Book.
     
     Page 261 - Last paragraph in second column should probably have "Main
     Armament" in italics in front of it. Recommendation - Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 262 - Observation - I think LSP modeled their guard bot after 
     Zhodani Warbots.

     Recommendation - Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 349 - Missiles are now riotously expensive.  Recommend adding 
     standard HE missiles in Starship Combat Game and Technical 
     Architecture.
     
     General Recommendation - create a supplement "Small Arms of the 
     Universe". Also, I would like to see the return of the 9mm ACR - it 
     was one of my favorite types of weapons since Mercenary.
     
     Page 357 - Grenades - Does not list 4cm Ram grenades for use with 
     weapons with integral grenade launchers. Recommendation - list on 
     Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 358 - Armor - Reflec has disappeared.  With the new lower 
     penetration personal lasers, most armor will stop lasers.  However, it 
     would be handy to have an armor specifically designed to stop lasers.  
     Given an armor value of 0, reflec could do this.  You might lower the 
     price some to make it more cost effective.  Recommendation - return 
     reflec with an armor value of 0 and lower price.  Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 359 - Armor - The combat environment suit has no associated 
     helmet.  Such a suit should have a visored helmet which does not 
     appear on the table until TL 10. Recommendation add a visored helmet 
     at TL 9 (AV 1 is fine) for the Combat Environment Suit -or- make it an 
     integral part of the suit adding H (head) to the coverage codes. 
     Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 368 - Free Trader Damage Tables - You have 5 - 9 listed for the 
     Cargo Hold, but then later you have 5 - 13 listed for Eng.  Then you 
     have 17, 18, and 20 with nothing. Recommendation - Errata Sheet.

     damage? Recommendation - Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 376 - Subsidized Liner Damage Tables - 13 is duplicated.  
     Recommendation - Errata Sheet.
     
     Page 377 - Merc Cruiser Damage Tables - 12 is duplicated. 
     Recommendation - Errata Sheet.
     
     Character Sheet - has no place for Homeworld Starport. Recommend 
     adding to updated Character Sheet.
     
     Character Sheet - recommending adding a back for such items as 
     equipment weapons, contacts.  Currently, I am copying the back of the 
     DC character sheet for use with TNE and find it works quite well.
     
     Note:  The comments about missiles were written before Dave Nilsen 
     sent a comment about missiles in TNE.  I have come to accept his 
     ruling on this.
     
     Yours for Traveller,
     
     Geo

     Also, I\'ve noticed that the TNE rules only list RAM Shoot-Through 
     Grenades.  It seems that the regular Hand Grenade variety got left 
     out.

That\'s nice.  Except that to have the fuel consumtions he lists
the "just hot hydrogen" has to be moving at like 0.55 C... ARGH!

Not only that, but you stick a negative number into *every* mass-dependent
formula, so that, eg, when a negative mass accelerates, its momentum
and energy *decrease*.

OK, here\'s what happens. (I don\'t remember any need for electric forces,
though.)

Start with Universal Gravitation--it now looks like Coulomb\'s law, with 
a negative sign, so like mass charges attract, and opposite mass charges
repel.  If you\'ve got two plates, you get

Forces:

Now, the cool part. Newton\'s second law is *also* affected, so if you 
push on a chunk of negative matter, it accelerates *toward* you!

Thus we get acceleration that looks like this:

> 	    	__        __
> 		| |       | |
> 		| |	  | |
> 	     <--|+|    <--|-|
> 		| |       | |
> 		| |	  | |

That is, if you leave equal masses of positive and negative matter 
sitting next to each other, they tend to accelerate off uniformly
along the line of their centres of mass--howdy reactionless Drive!

Note that no conservation laws are broken, because the increase in
energy and momentum of the positive mass is exactly balanced by a
decrease in the energy and momentum of the negative mass.

Aha! I\'ve just figured out where electric charge would come into it.
The key to the effect is the perverse reaction of negative matter
to an applied force, and since electric forces are 40 orders
of magnitude stronger than gravity, you can generate the force much
more easily with two oppositely electrically charged plates, one of
which being negative matter (though as I recall, Forward\'s actual
design used storage rings for reasons of practicality. He also got
some bonus out of the geometry of that arrangement, but I don\'t 
recall what it was.)

Hmmm...this reminds me.  Have nuclear dampers been phased out of the TNE
rules?  If not, radioactive clean-up could proceed fairly quickly.

Personally, I\'ve never had a problem with the Imperial Law angle, since 
the existence of some sort of (undefined for the most part) law enforcement
in the Imperium was used as a deterrent threat for a lot of activities.

  Retcon, short for Retroconceive(?) is a word that was was invented by
persons unknown on the rec.arts.comics newsgroup on Usenet.

  It means changing something that has already been established.
 
  For example (since it was invented on rec.arts.comics I\'ll use a comics
example:), Chris Claremont want to do an Xmen/AD&D crossover, and to get 
a lead-in to the story he decides that Storm is a half-Drow, that is a retcon,
because it has previously been established that she isn\'t.

  Revealing things that has previously been hidden (like Norris right hand,
and the Aslan engigma) isn\'t retcons. Neither is providing more detail on
a subject that previously been undefined. 

  But saying that 99% of the commerce of the commerce of the Imperium was
transported in unmanned unpowered barges with a hull grid, that was launched
from space stations that held the powerplant and actual jump drive, and
claiming that the players somehow never noticed all those big barges with
\'Tukera\' lables on them, that\'s a retcon.

design.  He modestly gave most of the credit to his wife, Margaret, who
collaborated closely with him on the nine-month project.  "We\'re calling
this one William Stewart Dean", he said, "and at 7 lbs 14 oz, I realize 
it\'s a lot smaller than some of my previous work, such as the Atlantis class
battleship.  In fact, it\'s only 20" long along the primary axis, and the
suspension and power train system seems to be subject to a great deal of
random motion at the moment, but we expect that will improve as the design
matures."
     Other industry leaders declined to comment on the new design, except
to suggest that it wasn\'t going to replace the air/raft anytime soon.

I add the Hit Location Table from the TNE-Rulebook. That is one thing I
didn\'t like at the rulebook, it doesn\'t have an appendix with all important
tables, nor can I find a table index to find the existing tables. Does
anybody know, if there is a GM-Screen in the planning?

    Having been a great success in use by lower Tech Levels, the Bear IISS
Tracked Scout Exploration Vehicle was redesigned for use in Vaccum conditions.
With a starship quality air-lock, and total life support, the Bear is
considered to be the equivalent of a light tank in use with the Scout Service.
Protection is provided by a single 2 Mw Pulse Laser, mounted on top of the
vehicle in a closed turret. Capable of carrying 6 passengers, the seats can be
removed to provide extra cargo room, sacrificing the speed of the vehicle. The
removal of 5 seats would allow the installation of a singular bunk. The

necessary for add-on equipment.


	I have reposted the Bear Tracked Exploration vehicle as it was originally
conceived for this vessel, and as such belongs with it. To the designer of the
Air Frame version, hope I haven\'t offended.

	Deck Plans will be along soon, a few minor enhancements are necessary. 
They won\'t be as neat as Bertil\'s plans, but I do the best I can. :)

Oh no!  Has Traveller degenerated into a thinly disguised variant of
Battle Tech? (-:  Damage sheets with lots of little boxes to cross out.  Next
we\'ll have a fatigue (heat) table that makes life more difficult for the
players up the scale, finally reaching the \'collapse and do nothing further
when the top end is reached\'.  Thankfully, traveller doesn\'t permit people
to go around with hundreds of weapons strapped to their arms and legs and to
be able to fire them :-)

  What I usually do when I generate systems after published data is that
I adapt the results to fit what I already know.

  Say for example that I have a system like this:

Dusbur	1023	C445685-A S [classes ignored]	615 K1 V

  I start by rolling for orbits (-2 for a K) and rolls 6, -2 this is 4. 
Since there is 5 GG\'s and 1 belt, that is too little so I increase the # of
orbits to 6. 
  A K0 V has 2 inner 1 habitable and the rest outer orbits. GG\'s should be in
outer orbits, and belts preferrably just inside a GG, so the total number of
orbits has to be increased to 7 (one GG in the habitable zone, and the belt
just inside it). Then I roll for the sizes of the GG\'s.
  The system now looks like this:

primary	K1 V
0	I	?
1	I	belt
2	H	SGG
3	O	LGG
4	O	SGG
5	O	SGG
6	O	SGG

  Then I roll for number of moons, getting 0, 10, 5, 2, and 6. This is a 
problem because the mainworld has to be at orbit 2. If it had been larger
than the maximum size of a SGG moon (6), I would have put it as a captured 
planet at 1.8 to 2.2 aprox, but since it is smaller than this, I put it
as a moon to the SGG in orbit 2 even though it shouldn\'t have any moons, and
add two rings just for the hell of it.

  If the players want to know what\'s at orbit 0, or the sizes of all moons,
I\'ll generate it when they ask.

  (BTW: looking at the probabilities, the rounded relation between the 
number of rings, size S moons and size 1+ moon are:
  For LGG\'s: 10/10/80
  For SGG\'s: 10/30/60 )

> 4)  Step #13-20, Orbit Zones
>         Say I have a G3 star.  Do I round down to G0, or do I use G5?

  Whichever you think fits the story best IMHO:)

  There\'s a lot of "-7"\'s missing in that chapter.

a 4-page thing only one of which is of interest, which list some of
the upcoming support material.

The TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE book will not only have design formulae
for vehicles, spacecraft (yes, the flyer says this will be in the TA
book.I hope I can believe this), weapons, sensors,"and more."
It will also examine technology not normally found in the Traveller universe.
This we already knew. However, the TA book will also have a section with
"a layman\'sexplanation of the _real_ science behind the numbers in Traveller,
addressing issues such as acceleration, gravity, power generation,
laser light dispersion, and much more." Included in the flyer are two
illustrations which I presume are from this section, one a cutaway view
of a vacc suit helmet, hilighting the systems inside, and one of what
I guess is a snub pistol. The illustrations look good, but I tremble at
hearing the "real science" part. We shall see....

STARSHIP COMBAT will be released as a boardgame, basically an expansion
of the basic rules and "useful for single ship encounters as well as
squadron actions".

REAVERS is the first region sourcebook, "is rich in adventure material
and background, covering the Old Expanses where the Star Vikings are based,
their Hiver patrons, and The Wilds they have sworn to tame." Apparently,
the Star Vikings have also apropriated the name "reavers" as well, which
fits my view of them just fine.  But, of course, REAL reavers are native
to the Deep.

CHALLENGE will be devoting more space to Traveller.

MINIATURES from RAFM, 25mm scale, as well as detailed starship miniatures.

NOVELS: the tie-in novel strikes Traveller. Or at least it will. Apparently
this is in too early a stage to say much about it.

  Slightly modified success/failure task system:

  As it now stands, a roll ten or more over the modified asset is a 
catastrophic failure *if* a new roll against the modified asset fails. On the
other hand, any roll of ten or more below the modified asset is an outstanding
success.

  This means that if you have an asset of more than 10, you\'ll never suffer
a catastrophic failure, and if you have less than 10, you\'ll never get a
outstanding success, a state of affairs that I wasn\'t satisfied with.


  The modification is to allow a 1 or a 20 to stand in for the ten or more
above/below roll, and at the same time hang a second roll after the 1:
  A roll of ten or more below the modified asset is an outstanding success.
  If the modified asset is lower than 10, a roll of 1 is an outstanding 
success *if* a new roll against the modified asset yeilds a success.
  A roll of ten or more above the modified asset (or a roll of 20, if the
modified asset is higher than 10) is a catastrophic failure *if* a new roll
against the modified asset fails.

modified system, but it looks like I left it at home. I\'ll try to send it
in before TML goes out tonight:)]

Well, I was pondering the thread of shipboard high tech games when
I suddenly realized this was the perfect venue for one of my dad\'s
old sea stories from the 1950\'s USN.  :-)

The Saga of The Esther Williams Trophy:
Back in 1072, there was a very attractive young holovid star Esther
Williams (of pure Solomani heritage) who was engaged to an Ensign
in the Darrian Confederation Navy.  His name and story are
unimportant, however, his fiancee gave him a marvelous present that
has been handed down through the years and sparked the imaginations
of Starship wardrooms for many many years.  She gave him a large
holographic plate of her curvaceous self inscribed "All my love,
Esther".

Sadly for the Ensign, the romance went sour, but his loss was the
gain of ship crews everywhere.  When it was known that the holo had
lost its romantic appeal, (and perhaps in an attempt to get a rise
out of the sulking Ensign) a shipmate stole it.  However, it was
then quickly discovered that the owner no longer wanted the holo
back.  It was then stolen by another shipmate.  Soon, a free for
all of epic proportions broke out aboard the Darrain ship with
officers stealing the holo back and forth.

Eventually, the holograph was taken by an officer when he was
transferred off ship.  The original ship made attempts to steal the
holo plate back triggering reprocussions throughout civilized
space.  The holo became the most desired object in the Darrian
fleet.  Ship crews began to hatch devilish schemes to possess the
holo.

The Holograph became a trophy.  It was then that the rules of the
game evolved.  It was encased in armored plastic with flotation
attached and a small passive transponder to prevent its being lost
in space.

It was in 1075 that the trophy first crossed over into Imperial
hands when Admiral Bertil (For whom the class of Q-ships was named)
let it be known that any Imperial crew which managed to steal the
trophy would not exactly meet with his disapproval.  Since then the
holo has been in and out of Imperial hands during various points of
history.  It has crossed into the hands of the Arden Confederation,
The Sword Worlds, and even accidently into the Zhodani Consulate
when the carrying ship was captured.

The rules of the game are simple:

The trophy must be displayed in the owning ship\'s wardroom.
The trophy may not be bolted down.
Only officers may participate in guarding or stealing the trophy.
No weapons are permitted to be used.

A holodisk accompanies the trophy on which the accounts and details
of how the trophy was stolen are transcribed for history.

On one occasion in 1093, the destroyer Dildano was in possession of
the trophy.  She was docked at Regina highport when the officers of
the scoutship Caliban boarded her.  The crew of the Caliban had
timed their attack to coincide with a general liberty for Dildano\'s
crew.  There were only four officers aboard at the time.  When the
intruder alarm went up the Dildano crew sprang for the wardroom and
barricaded themselves inside.  Not to be outdone, Caliban\'s crew
barricaded the officers inside the wardroom from the OUTside.

Caliban\'s crew then undocked Dildano from the station and fired her
engines briefly to break orbit.  As the destroyer spiraled in
closer to Regina\'s atmosphere, Caliban\'s crew prepared to bail out.
They offered the Dildano officers the chance to regain the bridge
if they would surrender the trophy.  Knowing they were beaten, they
surrendered before the ship would surely be destroyed.

Another account was from the log of the battleship Atlantis in 1104
when she was attacked by the crew of the carrier Lexington.  The
Atlantis was in highport in Efate.  It being well known that a high
proportion of starport workers in Efate are vargr.  A vargr Ensign
from the Lexington was kitted out with the ID and uniform of an
Efate starport worker.  He stole aboard the Atlantis and made his
way to the wardroom.

The officers of the Atlantis were sipping coffee when there was
suddenly a huge commotion in the passageway.  A starport worker
barking excitedly in gveug burst through the iris valve pointing
back out as black smoke came pouring through.  The officers hit the
fire alarm and rushed to their stations.

The Ensign had his chance, he grabbed the trophy and tore off
toward one of the starboard airlocks.  However he was quickly
followed by a mob of angry officers who had just found his brace of
smoke bombs.  He barely made it to the airlock, threw the trophy
inside and hit the emergency cycle button.  The trophy was blown
into space to a waiting ship\'s boat from the Lexington.

As the ship\'s boat closed in to make the pickup, the Atlantis
powered up her starboard repulsors and EMS-Jammers in an attempt to
force Lexington\'s crew to bring the trophy aboard.  Atlantis
officers jumped ship in vac suits to attempt recovery but were
beaten to the target by the Lexington\'s boat.

Lexington\'s boat took off at full speed, pursued by the Atlantis\'
cutter.  A high speed chase ensued.  Lexington\'s boat dove into
Efate\'s atmosphere, followed closely by Atlantis\' cutter.  As the
two approached the surface, Lexington\'s boat submerged in the
ocean.  Atlantis\' cutter attempted to follow but quickly lost
contact.  She rose out of the water and began a search pattern.

All of a sudden, they regained contact as Lexington\'s boat surfaced
and landed at an underground monorail station along the shore.
Atlantis\' cutter made an emergency landing at the platform just in
time to see Lexington\'s officers disappearing underground.

Two days later, the vargr Ensign was released by the Atlantis crew.
He was hailed as the hero of the operation, and received a personal
recommendation from the Lexington\'s captain when he went before the
promotion board later that year.

The trophy has acquired an aura of legend around it.  It has been
ascribed almost magical powers as a good luck charm for the ship
which carries it.  (Possibly because the Admirals smile on the
activity as promoting morale aboard ship and give choice
assignments to those smart enough to capture it.)

So you see, you don\'t need all those guns to have fun with Trav...

  I\'ve been going over my copy of the TNE book for a couple of weeks now.
My overall impression is good.  Only a few minor gripes.  

  One is the reduction in passanger space in the 100 Scout class starship.
According to my Classic Traveller book, the thing has 4 staterooms, each 
capabile of double occupency.  Eight was a nice number for a team of 
adventures.  Now you are down to two double occupency staterooms.  Total of 
four adventures in the ship.  A little thin for a good sized gaming group.
Hopefully this will be corrected in the 150 ton `stretch\' scout used in the
Regency as a `Quarantine Cutter\'. (Pg 169).

  On page 341, in the text describing the Data-Display Recorder Headpeice, 
Commdots and multiplexers are mentioned.  There are however no entries for
multiplexers or commdots.  Confusing to the first time Traveller player.

  Challange magazine #69 has an ad for the T:TNE `Starship Combat\' game on 
page 27.  Item number 0302, retail list price of $26.  Bullets are:

	- Vector-based movement
	- Detailed hit locations and damage resolution
	- Lasers, particle accelerators, meson guns and detonation 
		laser missles
	- Extensive ship ratings, including pre-Collapse warships
	- Complete starship design squence, usable with both the game and the
		roleplaying game.

  Is the Technical Archtecture going to be 0301?  Anybody have a better 
release date than `July\'?

  One thing I found missing was reflect and ablative armor.  No Anti-laser 
armor is a big hole that needs to be pluged.

  Grenades were mentioned in the rules, but no examples given or even a listing
the weaponary listings (except for RAMs).  I\'ve got GDW\'s Heavy Weapons book,
so I\'ve got examples at least.

  That\'s it for my first fast & dirty run through...I\'ve got some ideas for
campains, but I\'m going to reread my copy of H. Beam Piper\'s `Space Vikings\'
first...

Montabaur hault Mondar

Montabaur hault Mondar is born on Efate in the Regency. He decided 
to become a Master Psionic but after a test in the local Psionic
Institute, he was rejected. He then decided to join the Navy as
officer, so he starts his career at the Flight Academy.

Finishing the Flight Academy as a skilled pilot he joined the
officer corps of the Efate Navy, to be promoted at once. For
eight years was the Regency Navy his home, one more promotion
follow - from behind the scene supported by his father. When 
Montabaur ("Monty") realizes his fathers influence, he decided to 
become a Wealthy Traveller, to spend some of his money. Though 
wishing to spend money, he instead gains lots of it, and after 8 
years as Traveller he decided to join the diplomatic corps of the 
Regency.

Due to his descent and his interest for the Zhodani Society in 
his youth, he is promoted to Consul very fast. Eight years of 
service as Diplomat does finally show him a way to adventure he 
is searching from now on.

Klara Taft  aka  "Magic Voice" Laureen

Klara Taft was born as a child of "honorable" parents on Schall
in the Old Expanses. She was fond of music from her earliest 
youth, and when she get in contact with a composer and a band, 
she decided to become Entertainer. During her time as Entertainer
she improves  some technical skills, exspecially computing, 
skills she loves to use.

The arrival of a Hiver Ship result in a big cut. After a short 
phase to find a decision, she joined the Hiver Technical Academy
to improve her technical knowledge. For four years she improved 
her skills and show special affinity for computing and 
communication operating.

Leaving the academy she decided to first earn some money. Four 
years as computer programmer were dull for her, but after that 
she decided to go adventuring.

Prof.Dr.XenBio Roland Meier

Roland Meier was one of these persons, who are sure to become a 
scientist in his later life. In his youth he likes to climb the 
few small mountains Aubaine has, and to find places where he 
could be alone, and sometimes he manipulates the computer system 
just to get an edge over his friends.

He works through a University career, he only interupts, to get 
some training in Martial Arts and an exciting live. After 
absolving four years as Martial Artist, he decided to go back to 
his University career. After four years as Professor he decided 
to follow his occupation, Xeno Biology, into space.

	Nope, Anthony, these numbers are not typos at all.  They represent the
very low acceleration of a MPD drive.  They cannot get off the ground.  They
are used for insystem and orbital maneuvering.
	I dont know if _Hard Times_ has this,( my data is from the "One Small
Step" article by CE Gannon in Challenge #45) but under Locomotion it is stated:
"Note that many low tech spacecraft...will have G ratings significantly less
than 1.  They cannot even get off the ground when planetside.  This is _not_ an
error."
	This means that a MPD powered ship must have a secondary drive to lift
from a planet, or it never lands.  Give it a HiPerf rocket to lift off with and
an MPD for space cruising.  For an Eagle, I would have to assume either
a fusion rocket (Oh No, not the evil fusion rocket) or a HiPerf Rocket,
probable the latter.  (Yes, it was a fun show.)

And, in order to fan the fusion flames higher and higher:

>Since relatively few people seem interested in addressing the question I

>suspect that I can make the best use of my time by signing off now...
>
>				----Steve Higginbotham
	Indeed.  Well then, here is something to add to the discussion.
	In order to justify the attitude that fusion drives are good and nukes
are bad (and we musy assume that this is the case, or else bye-bye Traveller
universe), the reasoning must take into account many things, paramount being
public opinion and economics.
	On the Public Opionion side: people think nukes are bad.  Simple as
that.  Nukes are seen as weapons, and weapons only.  Not just waepons, but
weapons of such mass destruction that the avarage Imperial subject would react
to them much as an average citizen would today: Nukes are weapons; weapons
kill; nukes kill lots at once; killing is wrong; therefore, nukes are bad.  Not
a bad piece of logic, and quite understandable.  This attitude seems enough for
a government who says that it represents the people to stricly control nukes
(as well as PGMP, FGMP, machine guns, grenades, battledress, etc).
	Of course this belief also taints the usefulness that can result from
the same technology: nuclear power generators, nuclear pulse drives for Orion
(best use I\'ve ever heard for nukes), etc.  Many people apply the
reasoning above (nukes are bad...) to oppose anything related to the weaponry. 
Hopefully, this attitude is rare, as long as the spinoff technology is safe.
	But, what about economics?  Lets reconstruct our argument to another
potential killer: the automobile.  Killing is bad; automobiles kill lots of
people every year in accidents; therefore, automobiles are bad.  Most people
will readilly agree with the first argument, but not with this one.  Why?
	Automobiles play an integral part of our society.  Without them, our
transportational, manufactural, society would not function.  Because of the
benifits that come with the automobile, society has decided that the deaths
that result from its use is acceptible.  The deaths that result from the use of
a nuke generally outweights the benifits gained from using it.
	Change automobiles to starships and the argument is still valid.
	We try to minimalize the deaths from automobiles: safety restraints,
traffic lights, good roads, licencing of drivers, laws against abuses and cops
to enforce those laws.  These steps must all be taken in the Imperium, also. 
Ships fusion reactors must be almost impervious to accidental meltdown and
very resistand to deliberate meltdown, ships drives (and their operators ) must 
be fully licenced, ships must travel defined \'travel lanes\' and obey traffic
laws, and ships myst be operated by the gov\'t to enforce these laws.  Any
low-tech fusion rockets must only travel along sertial flightpaths, have
alternate planetary drives (a-grav, whatever), etc.
	Mind you, noone will probably be able to stop a determined person from  
crashing his ship into a planet at high-c speeds, just as its almost impossible
to stop a van full of explosives from running a roadblock and exploding in a
government building.  However, this does not mean that vans will be made
illegal.  Fusion drives are too useful to toss out the window just because you
could toast a city with them.  Fusion reactors (and starship fission reactors)
are entirely to important to the Imperium for them to limit their use,
construction, or distribution in an unreasonable means.
	What must be done is a series of safeguards must be in place it help
prevent this from happening.
	What safeguards?  Possible similar to whats in place to stop people
from crashing their vans into gov\'t buildingd, or piloting their plane filled
with fuel and explosives into the White House, or some such silly thing.

Will someone please explain, to me at least, why NASA hasn\'t been able to do
just this?  Aren\'t the locals primitive enough to do the heavy lifting? :-)

Well, the Germans managed it in WW2 (except that it wasn\'t exactly an *Iraqi*
super gun :-) when they built their V3 weapon.  Basically, it was similar to
the Iraqi version, except that it wasn\'t built with British assistance.  It
was demolished with British assistance, though, courtesy of 617 Squadron.

     radios sure have gotten a lot heavier in the New Era - in Striker, a 2

     4. The use of a flechette grenade is a little confusing. Actually what 
     is confusing is the "Close Range Penetration" of "9" for this 
     particular grenade.  Does this mean it is wimpy close up? (I don\'t 
     think so) Or, does it become a penetrator at short range?  (In which 
     case it is a tremendous anti-APC weapon).  Okay, I just read the rule 
     on flechettes again and believe this should be short range -Damage- 
     which makes a lot more sense.  I just double
     checked with shotguns and found that at close range they have a Damage

     general information) is to subtract the empty weight from loaded 
     weight. Then subrtract the volume in cubic meters of the cargo (since 
     MT assumed 1 ton per cubic meter I chose to use this figure, therefore 
     the mass of the cargo will equal its volume), and from that subtract 
     the weight of any vehicles.  This will give you the weight in tons of
     the fuel (which, by no coincidence is also its displacement volume in 
     tons, since by definition, a displacement ton is the volume occupied 
     by one metric ton of hydrogen).  If you want cubic meters (also called 
     kiloliters) then multiply the displacement by 14 (which TNE uses 
     instead of the former 13.5 - since one ton on deck plans is now 2 
     meters by 2 meters by 3.5 meters).
     
     While working on a set of deck plans, I worked out a -rough- formula 
     for figuring out how many tons of fuel is G-hour. Simply divide the 
     ship\'s displacement by 100.  Therefore, a 100 ton vessel would burn 1 
     ton of fuel for 1 G-hour of thrust.  Be advised, I only looked at two 
     examples, but the results were the same.  I checked the first two 
     ships in the book.  If you have MT, you can check others.  Calculate 
     the tonnage of fuel as above.  Then, using MT, find the number of jump 
     units that a ship of that displacement and jump range would require.  
     Multipy that number by 5 tons to find out how much jump fuel the ship 
     requires.  Then subtract jump fuel from total fuel and you get the 
     amount of reaction mass fuel. If you divid this number by (ships
     displacement divided by 100) you should get approximately the total 
     number of G-hours that is listed on the ship\'s sheet.  If you try it, 
     please post the results -positive or negative-.

     MAD GEO\'S QUICK AND DIRTY GUIDELINES FOR CONVERTING MT VEHICLES TO TNE
     STANDARDS
     
     The release of Technical Architecture is tenetively scheduled for late 
     summer. When that is released, a more accurate vehicle conversion 
     system can be devised.  In the mean time, I offer the following means 
     for Traveller referees to obtain more vehicles for use in their 
     campaigns.
     
     TL - Use straight from the vehicle you are converting.
     
     Size - Multiply the vehicles displacement tonnage by 14 for
          size in kiloliters.  Also list the displacement tons.
          In parenthesis next to displacement tons is the size
          code for the vehicle which can be found in TNE page 324
          center column, I will list it here for convenience.
          Sizes are displacement tons not gross weight.
               SM - sub-micro - less than 1 ton.
               MC - micro - 1 - 9 tons.
               VS - very small - 10 - 99 tons.
               SM - small - 100 - 999 tons.
     
          There are sizes above this, but very few vehicles, other
          than starships, would fall in that catagory.
     
     Weight - List the vehicle\'s empty and loaded weight in metric
          tons (spelled tonnes to differentiate between them and
          English wight tons.)
     
     Power - List the type and output of the vehicle\'s powerplant.
          The conversion here might get a little sticky.  If your
          vehicle has a fusion power plant, it will now use almost
          no fuel.  However, most vehicles are using fuel cells.
          You might consider giving your vehicle a MT fuel cell
          instead.  Also, if the vehicle is a grav vehicle, it
          will use reaction mass.  Here is where you can use all
          that fuel that was being used for the fusion power
          plant.
     
     Maint: (Maintenance) - this represents the number of hours a
          week that needs to be spent maintaining this vehicle.
          Striker gives the following list of maintenance points
          requirements (note: some have been adjusted):
     
               Wheeled Vehicle                    5
               Grav Vehicle                       5
               Air Cushion Vehicle                6
               Tracked Vehicle                    8
               Aircraft                          12
     
               Computer                           1
               Fire Direction Center              5
               Nuclear Damper                    12
               Point Defense Fire Control        12
               Indirect Fire Control             10
               Direct Fire Control                6
               ECM, Radio, or Radar Jammer        5 each
               RDF, Radar, Ladar, or Map Box      5 each
               EMS array                         10
               Communicator (any type)            1 each
               Night Vision Device                1
     
               Meson Gun                         10
               Point Defense Weapon              12
               Laser, Plasma Gun, or Fusion Gun   5 each
               Mass Driver or Tac Missile Lchr    3 each
               CPR Gun or MRL                     2 each
               Anti-personnel Weapon              1 each
     
          Add up the above points and divide by 5 dropping
          fractions.  This is an approximate maintenace number.
          Rugged use vehicles would generally require more,
          perhaps as much as twice as much.
     
     Controls: For the computer model, look up the TL of the
          computers installed, this becomes the model number.
          Computers used by grav vehicles or aircraft are called
          flight computers.  Computers used by spacecraft are
          called standard computers.  No name is given for
          computers in ground vehicles, perhaps "vehicle computer"
          will serve.  If the computer is fiber optic, add the
          notation "Fb (fiber optic)" in the text.  List the type
          of controls.
     
     Commo: In TNE, the commo ranges are roughly compatible to
         those in MT, but seem to be in decimal multiples of 3.
         It probably has to do with 1/10 of a light second (30,000
         km) being 1 starship combat range band.  Change the "5"
         in commo ranges to "3".  List all communcators.
     
     Sensors: In TNE, the listed sensor range is the Short Range.
          The sensor\'s extreme range is 8 times that number.
          Ranges seem to be "3" number for the most part.
          Therefore recommend using the following as ranges for
          sensors:
     
               MT Range       Active Sensor       Passive Sensor
               Distant        300 meters          150 meters
               V. Distant       3 kilometers        1.5 kilometers
               Regional        30 kilometers       15   kilometers
               Continental    300 kilometers      150   kilometers
     
               Sensor more powerful than this are generally only
          employed on Starships, which seem to have the following
          sensor ranges.
     
               EMS ACTIVE         EMS PASSIVE     VESSEL TYPE
                  3,000 km  (0)   150,000 km (5)  Civilian
                 30,000 km  (1)   180,000 km (6)  Small Military
                300,000 km (10)   240,000 km (8)  Military/Survey
     
          For Active EMS, these probably represent Planetary, Far
          Orbit, and Extreme Orbit (a new range for Active
          Sensors).  For Passive EMS, these probably represent
          Extreme Orbit, Interplanetary, and Interstellar.
     
          Select an sensor strength appropriate to your vehicle\'s
          purpose.
     
          For Densitometers list type of penetration (HI or LO)
          and penetration depth.
     
          For Neutrino sensors list the TL.
     
          Other sensors should be listed, by name, TL if
          applicable (ie multiple levels available), and range if
          one is available for conversion.
     
          Also list any Avionics by TL if applicable.
     
     Life Support: Basic Environment - Heat, Lights
                   Basic Life Support - Sealed Environment
                   Extended Life Support - Extended Life Support
                   Air/Lock - Note if Vehicle has one or more
     
                    TNE lists Pressurized which roughly equates to
                    the old Striker Overpressure.  Since MT did
                    not have Overpressure, this might apply to
                    Basic Life Support rather than sealed
                    Environment.  It\'s your call.
     
     Load: List the vehicles load in tonnes.  This is cargo only -
          it does not incluce fuel weight.  For the weight of
          cargo, assume 1 metric ton per kiloliter.
     
     Crew: List the number of crew members.  If the crew involves
          more than a driver, list the crew positions in
          parenthesis.
     
     Passengers: List the number of passengers the vehicle was
          designed to carry.
     
     Fire Control: These seem to range from +1 to +4.  If you have
          a high tech vehicle, it will probably be +4.  TL\'s less
          than 8, and "export" models seem to have lower FC\'s.
          Use your judgement.
     
     Stabilization: Basic, Good, or Advanced.  TL\'s 5 or 6 can
          have Basic, 7 can have Good, 8+ can have Advanced.  Grav
          Vehicles automatically have Advanced.
     
     Armament: List types, numbers, and mounts of each weapon the
          vehicle has.
     
     Ammo: List the type and number of rounds available for all
          weapons on the vehicle.
     
     Travel Move: Multiply the vehicle\'s max speed by 4 for the
          number to the left of the slash, its cross country speed
          by 4 for the number to the right of the slash.
     
     Combat Move: Divide the above numbers by 8.8 for combat
          movement.  Adjust to reasonable looking numbers.  If
          the vehicle is a grav vehicle or aircraft, divide this
          number by 10 and round to the nearest whole number to
          give the number of 10 meter squares per combat turn.
     
     Fuel Capacity: List the vehicle\'s fuel capacity in -liters-.
          Multiply -kiloliters- by 1000 to convert to liters.
     
     Fuel Consumption:  List the consumption per hour of operation
          in liters of fuel.  Also list the vehicle\'s endurance in
          hours.
     
          Here you will have to be a little subjective.  Fusion
          power plants use very little fuel, consequently their
          consumption does not need to be listed.  For other
          vehicles, use the consumption rate as derived from MT.
          For reaction mass, use the following:
     
          For vehicles which are unstreamlined, divide the
          vehicle\'s loaded weight by 4 to determine mass/hour
          required.  If the vehicle is streamlined divide the
          vehicle\'s loaded weight by 8 to determine mass/hour
          required.  If the vehicle has an airframe, divide the
          vehicle\'s loaded weight by 16 to determine mass/hour
          required.
     
          <Note: the above figures are extrapolated from the only
          two examples of fusion powered flying vehicles in TNE.
          I did not take into account actual speed.  I postulate
          that contra-gravity provides the lift and fusion rockets
          provide the thrust.  If you feel you have a more
          workable system to determine reaction mass, by all means
          use it, and post it for the benefits of othes.>
     
     COMBAT STATISTICS:
     
          Config: At present, TNE only includes three types of
               configurations - Standard, which have no notation;
               Small Turret - abbreviated ST, and Turreted.  The
               speeder, which is the closest TNE offers to an
               aircraft is stanard configuration.  If you have a
               aircraft designed using COACC, and have T2K2
               available, you may wish to treat it as an aircraft
               according to that system.
          Susp: Refer to the first page of the TNE vehicles for
               the abbreviations of vehicle suspension types.
     
               Type      Damage Value Range
               Wheels    (1) <road> - (6) <rugged cross country>
               Track     2 <light tracks> - 6 <MBT\'s>
               ACV       (4) - (8) although exceptionally large
                         ACV suspensions can take proportionately
                         more damage.
               Grav      Does not list a separate damage listing
               Legs      Not listed in TNE, recommend 1/4 to 1/3
                         of thickest armor value up to a maximum
                         value of 12.
     
          Armor: Since TNE does -not- use uniform value armor <and
               is therefore more realistic> you will have to do
               some calculation here.
     
               Step A. Find the thickness of your vehicle\'s armor
                       by looking up the Armor value on page 63 of
                       MT.  The associated modifier is the
                       thickness of armor in hard steel in
                       centimeters.
     
               Step B. Determine the actual thickness in the
                       material which composes your vehicle\'s
                       armor.  Divide the value derived in step A
                       above by the following:
     
                              Light Composites     2
                              Composite Laminates  3
                              Crystaliron          4
                              Superdense           7
                              Bonded Superdense   14
                              Coherent Superdense 20
     
               Step C. Determine the TNE armor value of the
                       vehicle\'s armor.  Divide the thickness of
                       armor determined in Step B, by the value
                       listed on the Armor Equivalancy Table on
                       Page 298 of TNE.  This will yield the armor
                       value of the toughest part of the vehicle,
                       usually the vehicle\'s chassis front and
                       turret front.
     
               Step D. Allocate the armor proportionately around
                       the vehicle.  A rule of thumb is to halve
                       the value from Step C. for the sides,
                       quarter it for the rear and deck, and eigth
                       for the belly.  Armor values should be at
                       least 1.  If the vehicle is open topped,
                       put the AV\'s for front, sides, and rear in
                       brackets [ ] to denote incomplete coverage.
     
                       Of course this type of armor would actually
                       weigh -much- less than a uniform thickness
                       armor.  There are basically 3 approaches
                       you could take.
     
                              1. Ignore the difference completely
     
     
                              2. Find the MT armor weight and
                                 multiply by .33 to get the TNE
                                 weight.  Subtract this value from
                                 The MT weight to determine how
                                 much less the vehicle should
                                 weigh.
     
                              3. Guesstimate the vehicle\'s
                                 dimensions and then using Striker
                                 determine what the vehicle\'s
                                 armor would actually weigh with
                                 that configuration.  Then
                                 subtract this value from the MT
                                 armor weight to determine how
                                 much less the vehicle should
                                 weigh.
     
                       I would only recommend the third option to
                       those perfectionist who have access to
                       Striker.
     
                       A reduced vehicle weigh will probably
                       have an affect on its performance.  You may
                       wish to go back and recalculate this.
     
     WEAPONS VALUES:  Some weapons you will be able to extract
          strait from TNE.  Others will not be so easy.  You
          should first try to look through other House Rule
          products to see if there is a similar weapon listed.  If
          so, use that weapons statistics, perhaps modified
          somewhat for a higher TL.  If you cannot find something
          compatible, try the processes listed below.
     
          Penetrators - Heap rounds, Keap rounds, Lasers, Plasma
          and Fusion weapons.  Take the weapon\'s greatest
          penetration, to to Page 63 of the Ref\'s manual.  Find
          that number under the Armor column of the Armor Table
          (Step 9).  The corresponding number under the Mod column
          represents the thickness in centimeters of plate steel
          that the weapon can penetrate.  Double this number and
          round to the nearest whole number.  This is the weapons
          penetration at close and short range.  For damage use
          the penetration value.  Halve the penetration for long,
          and halve it again for extreme range.  If the
          penetration at any range falls below 1, then it is Nil
          for that range and all further ranges.
          HE weapons - take the MT penetration and refer to the
          table below.  (Note: this was derived based on relative
          mass of explosive in the warhead. Higher TL HE rounds
          give you more boom for your buck, and subsequently
          higher penetrations, however this is factored into the
          MT design process, so you don\'t need to adjust for TL.)

  First of all, thanks for reposting it here, especially Geos conversion

>       Antitank      C:3, B:4      18C

  I think this outlines one problem I\'ve seen in TTNE: the generally very 
low penetrations of all weapons (except starship weapons).

  Here we have a TL7 hand grenade, and it has much greater penetration than
any of the fusion or plasma rifles. 

  Comparing the tac missiles with their TL7 and 8 counterparts is even worse:
A TL8 I-TOW has much higher penetration (150C) than any of the tac missiles
given on page 357, even much heavier TL13 versions!

  I have a slight suspicion that this is because GDW wanted to avoid the
scenario where a joker with a TL8 ATGM (pen around 130C) shoots at the 
characters trader, and the ship takes 3 critical hits...

  One possible way to resolve this is to say that anti-ship weapons penetrate
over a much larger area (using 3G3 on it gives a minimum beam diameter of
538mm for the 150MJ TL15 laser if it should be capable of operating in
an atmosphere too, and 134 for vacuum only) and say that unless you really
make a hole 100mm+ in diameter, there won\'t be any critical hits. 
  This would remove this capability from most small HEAP weapons, but retain
it for very large explosive charges etc.

  This does not mean that small AP weapons are incapable vs ships. Against a
thin-hulled trader, even small TL7+ autocannons and auto-grenade launchers
are devastating. Roughly half of the rounds from a TL7 40mm auto-grenade
launcher firing HEAP would penetrate, and those who didn\'t would still 
cause damage to hardpoints, antennas, airlocks and other openings.

    And nowwwww..... The question you have all been waiting for...

    I am doing up a program to randomly generate animal encounter tables
(Because I hate rolling dice) and have a lack of understanding about a section
in the ANIMAL WEIGHT EFFECTS table, following below....

    Hokay. Now, I understand that wound is a modifier for the hits for the
animal\'s weapon type (described in yet another table) but I have no Idea
what "Wound" means. Wound. That\'s a pretty generic label and I can\'t find a
reference to it in the manual. If you have ANY idea what the h*ll this means,
please write me and let me know...

	
     On another note, Does the David Boddie of the Vargr and Zhodani word
generator fame reside on this list? If so, could you E-Mail me your new
address? I have a question regarding a modification to your code that
creates a derivative program.


     And wait! Yet One more question! I have been fiddling with the program
"striker" that is available through Sunbane. In the Laser Weapons sections,
How do I figure out the penetration and attenuation of the lasers created?
Any Ideas?

     Anyway, I\'ll post the table generator when it\'s completed. Should be done
in about a week.

here is one comments on TML messages I read in the last TML nightly V57#8.

1. Kerry Harrison <harrisok@ccmail.dell.com> wrote:

 ...stuff deleted

Well the fuel volume is listed under "notes" together with the fuel
purification ability. In some designs the fuel is called "reaction mass".
It is given cubic meters. I checked the G-hours mentioned of the ship
against the mentioned fuel mass, and got 12.5 kliters per G-hour and
100 tons of ship displacement, a slight difference to your calculation.


I had some trouble looking through the Starship Operating Procedures.
In Step 12, "Travel from Orbit" only streamlined ships are allowed to
land on planet surfaces. After checking the Starships, I found out that
the Subsidized Liner and the Yacht are USL but have Contra-Grav-Lifters.

Contra Grav Lifters are used to lift the ship against the gravity of a
world, so why should ships include Contra Grav, when they are not intended
to land on worlds (the illustration of the Yacht shows the ship flying in
an athmosphere). Realising this, I recommend an addition to step 12 of
the Startship Operating Procedure:

The deorbiting of an unstreamlined Starship is done in two steps. First
the ship decelerate as usual for the landing of a streamlined ship. But
after the time noted in the "Traval Time To Orbit Table", the ship has
only decelerated to suborbital speed (about 1000 km/h), and has reached
the edge of the atmosphere. It takes no G-hours of fuel, but at least
an additional hour to reach the surface of the world to land.

This additional rules only holds, if the destination planet has an
atmosphere. If not so, use the standard rules.

The starting sequence of an unstreamlined ship from an atmosphere world,
should include a one hours ascend to the edge of the atmosphere and then
the usual acceleration to orbital speed.

Any comments on this suggestion are strictly encouraged!

I checked out the adventure "The Once and Future Emperor", and found, that
the code used there has a lot of typos in it.

Bug 1:

In the "Inscription on the Tetrahedron"(p.145) the first line of code should
read "37265719 2959 37265719" because the code for "F" is "37" not "17",
as mentioned on page 152.

The key for the code on page 152 is buggy too:

Bug 2:
Code for "N" is 47 and Codes for "Y" are 59 and 50! There is no "Z" in the
whole message, but 50 and 59 are used for coding "Y".

Bug 3:
In the "Directions to Gherard\'s Tomb" are some misplaced numbers, and the
problem according "Y" mentioned above. There are at least 6 errors, most
of the time one numeral is wrong. If someone is interested, I can send
the corrected code to him.

    'body' => '  One thing that I noticed when the PC\'s went up against very big nasties
in DarkCon was that even those big nasties were very vulnerable to high volumes
of low power fire.

  For example, assuming that an Elephant has 80 hits, it would stand up to
exactly 22 9mm hits, or 6 7.62 hits. That mean that the poor trunkist is
down after five or ten seconds when faced with 5 PC\'s with semi-auto *pistols*.

  So, I have experimented with a rule that limits the damage done by small
weapons against large targets: ie you might be hitting the elephant and it
might die of blood loss in a few hours, but you need a very powerful weapon
or a very high volume of fire to bring it down quick.

  The Elephant rule: (Perhaps it should be renamed the \'Jurassic Park rule\':)

  If the damage points aborbed by an being with just one hit location is more
than the damage value (ie # of dice after armour) times N then divide the 
excess by five. -1 is counted as equal to 1 for the purpose of this rule.
  N is dependent on the system, and should be equal to the NPC hit capacity
(aka 20 in T2k2 and 40 in TTNE).


  Example: T2k2: The first 6 bullets that hit the Elephant will inflict 
6 * 3.5 = 21 damage points. 1 * 20 = 20, so everything above 20 should be
divided by 5, so they really inflicted 20.2 damage points. Getting the
elephant to 80 points would take 85 more rounds, and it will be quite pissed 
the whole time.
  So if you want to take down an elephant, use an aimed shot from an elephant
gun, and not bozos with uzis.

    'body' => 'James Kelleher 1h 1r... :-) Hello again here I am again I\'m on TML 
myself Yah. But first I noticed one typo in my post... MY OWN D*** 
NAME! ... ARRRRGH! I hate that; when other folks don\'t check their 
stuff: but My own name... Oh bummer. It\'s Jim Kelle(h)er not 
Kelle(r)er! Oh well no use crying over an extra r... and my spell 
checker has it I know it does... James Kundert ( I\'d better spell it 
right he is in one of my games!)

I think that he\'s right on the blasters. The plasma gun is a bit 
extreme, smoking boots ? yuck! Ok so I guess either an overloaded 
pulse laser, or a low powered laser stun gun ( up powered ) would fit 
the bill. I have yet to have anyone ask for one or for a "Captain\'s 
sidearm" either, since there has not been any personal combat ( 
through a lot of paranoia on the part of the captain, and other crew 
members they have managed to avoid several dangerous situations. { 
DARN! :-)} ).

Rob Dean Writes: The trouble that I have is that the new setting is 
DULL.  Ho hum...another planet full of barbarians.  How clever can I 
be today?  "Yo, Starblade, bring me my laser rifle...those guys have 
blowguns and they look a little more dangerous than the last batch." 
:-( :-P  Was it here that someone mentioned H. Beam Piper\'s "Gunpowder 
God" recently?  If not, they should have.  For those of you unfamiliar 
with the works of Piper (shame on you! a seminal influence on 
Traveller),  <Lots of plot synopsis left out >   In "GG", the kingdom 
is located on a distant planet and is saved by the intervention of a 
trading company scout team with contra-gravity vehicles and machine 
guns, who massacre the opposition in the course of a couple of days. 
One of these is an exciting adventure story; the other was only 
reprinted to round out an author\'s Complete Works collection.  What is 
the difference? In Kalvan, the hero is challenged by the situation and 
has to struggle for success.  In "GG", the heroes smash everything in 
sight without working up a sweat. Our games should resemble the former 
more than the latter.  The advantage of the Old Imperium was that 
there were many planets providing _different_ levels of challenge, 
allowing the referee to provide interesting situations without 
straining our sense of disbelief.  How is a ref supposed to keep a 
game challenging when nearly every obstacle in the path of the 
characters can be removed by blowing everything to bits?  It\'s not 
even like the Imperials will hunt you down and send you to the Prison 
Planet (Adventure 8 (-:) if you do something too antisocial.  Sure, 
you _could_ play the game without falling into the "I\'ve got the 
biggest gun" rut, but the internal checks and balances of the setting 
have been removed.

Ah well--I\'ve always maintained a continuously progressing timeline in 
my own infrequent games, and for _me_, the year is still 1108.  It\'ll 
take me a while to get to the point where I have to decide about the 
Rebellion. Is civilization collapsing up there, ahead of me?  We\'ll 
see when we get there.  But if it is, I think the universe is going to 
be a dull sort of place, without the ability to inspire the near-
fanatical devotion that we oldtimers seem to have for the game.

Rob Dean Weeeelllll I\'d have to differ with you here I think that it 
would not be all that hard to come up with new and interesting 
variations on a  theme... " Hey Vikekiller they have to run out of 
ammo sometime..." guess who gets the staring role in the stewpot 
tonight? in addition there is the noticeable fact that the high tech 
stuff is at least 80 years old and so can be unreliable at best. 
Maintenance? spare parts? ha! you gots\' ta find em! there is also the 
"Longbow" factor as well as cultural factors that will keep the 
characters in line. Well ok somewhat... A good number of challenges 
could be invented, here are a couple... A highly psionic and 
xenophobic cult secretly rules the planet unless you are very good or 
lucky you won\'t even know of their existance but gosh... things just 
keep going wrong. Or... You run into somebodies\' psycho - historical 
experiment and mess it up??? and boy are they p***ed. note that 
neither one used the old ... fissle snap pop ... I guess it is broken 
you will just have to do without it. (not bad for off the cuff.)

Well, I don\'t know if you have ever seen the Classic Traveller 
Adventure "Murder on Arturus Station" But I feel it is a classic. 
You\'re party is asked by the station manager to help solve the murder 
of someone aboard the station. It is a very well done module. And the 
best thing is that you can change the killer each time that you play 
the adventure, so even someone who has played the Adventure could do 
it again the next time because the solution can be different each 
time. Unfortunately it does not rely on forensic science so there are 
no helps there. It relies on character interaction, which I think is 
the best part of role playing anyway. The GM has to play many parts 
male and female each with their own motives and alibis. If you can 
find it pick it up I think it may help. It has the feel of the Maltese 
Falcon or an Agatha Christy murder mystery. Except in this case all 
the clues are there for the hunting. What it basically boils down to 
is good ole police work. Searching for clues and talking to suspects. 
Of course everyone is a suspect and almost all have means, motive and 
opportunity. > Jim Kelleher Greg Givler

Uh Greg I hate to say it but it looks like " you have nothing but your 
wits ( If any ) to solve it." although I do not have that one it is on 
my list of stuff to get soon, it sounds interesting and could give me 
some ideas. the problem is that this murder is going to occur at the 
kingsbury campus of the university of Regina, on Regina, DNI may get 
involved ( I can\'t tell you why yet ;-) ) 

Everything else is sort of "OK, roll." I think of a number that they 
need to succeed and say if they do or not. Sort of seat of the pants 
stuff. I just try to be consistent. I have always felt that rules in 
role playing games should be a frame work, not engraved in Granite. 
Greg Givler I agree and I must admit that I do this sometimes. I also 
tend to just randomly roll dice sometimes I am trying to determine 
something sometimes I\'m just making my players paranoid. there is no 
system that is graven in stone I think that I\'ve modified every game 
system I have used. If you do not LIKE some aspect of a system you can 
either change it or use something else you like more.

Greetings Humanoids:

	I see someone looking for advice that I myself had a pondering 
about and recently made a ruling. This might be helpful... Or not. 
Catie, could you see that Jim Kelleher receives this post... Thanx!!

( I have received it but due to a misspelling it is Kelleher 1h 1r)

	Well Jim, I have taken to stealing from other games and 
supplements and trying to make a conversion to MegaTrav that I feel is 
resonable. Here\'s one example... 	So have I, Gurps, is just one of 
them sometimes translation can be a problem, but it\'s a small price, 
as some of my players have even more Trav stuff than I do; Surprise! 
It is not the scenario you thought it was. Or sometimes I\'ll just 
modify one of the old Trav things...

FORENSICS KIT

This is a portable forensics lab, with a dedicated computer system 
capable of detection and chemical analysis of evidence. As well as 
ballistics analysis and finger and voice printing, the lab is capable 
of identifying and classifying hair,flesh scrapings and blood samples, 
and using them to determine the owner\'s genetic pattern. It is usually 
linked to a database containing detailed records on suspects to aid 
identification. Also contained is a still camera with reader. It comes 
in it\'s own carrying case.

Aside: 	Well, I dunno. I put together this little thing to make my 
life a little 	more relaxing. Actually, it\'s pretty well stolen from 
the Criminology Kit in GURPS Cyberpunk, page 54. (Lawsuit???) but very 
bare bones translated. 	I figure the "Dedicated Computer" is some 
kinda expert system. Could  linked to a central database by comlink or 
cellular modem (whatever). 	For my purposes, the computer is a 
model/1bis. That\'s what the Hand	Computer is supposed to be. Sure, 
there\'s a lotta room in the case for more 	hardware, but that\'s all 
they really need. The sensors are stolen from the Electronic Locks 
section. Sure, they\'re a little more accurate, but it\'s a decent start 
for a homegrown piece of work. I have brought the Cyberpunk and 
Ultratech Battery types into Traveller to make my  life easier, seeing 
Trav won\'t make my life easy! Never could find definitive information 
about power pack size for laser weapons and other things. 	The above 
contraption runs off a C cell for three months. Powerful little cells. 
You could up the ante and put in more gizmos, but this should do.

I think that a chemical sniffer and a neural sensor might help I\'ll 
consult with Catie\'s former police commissioner character ;->.I have 
noticed that T:TNE has what looks like a good set of battery rules. --

	For the still camera above, I use a Digital Camera, which will 
get 3000 still photos or 1 hour of video (Huh? ah well. probably a 
weak comparison. 	but it\'s my rule. Don\'t like it? Change it!) per 
1.5 Gigabyte disk.

Only 1.5 Gigabyte Tsk Tsk we have 1.2\'s in 3.5 in. format now! I think 
you should get more than an hour but for it\'s work you probably won\'t 
need it. -- jim --

Anyhow, that\'s the stuff. Hope it helps. Yes a lot, but I still have  
to figure a way around the " Well we have matched the DNA samples at 
the scene of the crime and here is the criminal." I guess that is my 
problem not yours but how could they get away with it ???

Now back to your regularly scheduled diversion...

Scott 2G Kellogg has some good things to say about Survival Margin ( S 
& M ? ) I do think I like the whole thing. I think what he is doing in 
the IKAR sector ( Foreven sector to us imps ;-) ) is great. His 
universe and mine are probably diverged, but that\'s Ok, to each his 
own I think my group is interested in playing through the 1130\'s and 
beyond into the regency and the consulate getting closer,this seems to 
be an exciting period. Eventually we may see the new era, of course it 
will be the children of the characters ( if they survive ;-) bwaha ha 
ha ) or their grand children. if... this is not to say that we will 
not use the new rules if they seem to be an improvement. ( what I\'ve 
seen so far looks like it! ). After all we have not passed 1118 yet 
there are exciting adventures just around the corner so to speak.

 - -bertil- >but it seems that ol\' Norris still rules things, even 
though he >should be in his 140\'s (and his daughter in her 60\'s at 
least). Uh, bertil uh, I couldn\'t find where you got your assumption 
from. I would be surprised if ol\' Norrie, ( one of my characters calls 
him Norrie to his face ;-) ), was still around after all, the 
anagathics rules are very pointed. You are lucky if you make just 
about 120 years, His daughter could still be around but she would be 
pretty old. How about the Kid from Arrival Vengeance??? 

Assuming that low Pen means better penetration, and high Dam means 
more damage (which assumptions are based on the idea that better 
penetration and more damage mean better chances of harming the target) 
then it is the data which gives the 9mm rifle better penetration and 
more damage than the 12mm rifle which is at fault.  I would personally 
expect the 12mm rifle to have worse penetration (higher Pen) and do 
more damage (higher Dam) than the 9mm rifle.

The smaller bullet and higher powder ( relatively ) charge makes the 
9mm penetrate better but will have a lower damage than a 12mm which 
has a larger area to inflict its damage over. -- jim  kelleher --

Will there be a way for people who have bought the various items that 
will be in the boxed set to acquire the "special goodies" without 
getting TNE and Technical Architecture again ie: without shelling out 
for the entire boxed set? mark Matson

Yes! Yes! please I have already bought T:TNE and really do not need 
another copy. I\'ll buy the technical architecure book as soon as it is 
out, I am very eagre for it, especially since the quality of T:TNE was 
so good. -- jim K --

    For my own use, I\'m thinking of staying with my current usage of

And in fact in the Azhanti High Lightning adventures there was one 
about a delivery of a rare Solomani vintage to the Emperor. It was 
something called -- Jmaica Blue Mountain -- if my memory serves me 
well, ( no that\'s Dillon :-) ). Blue mountain for you folks out there 
who do not know; Is one of the best coffees any where!!! In my 
campaign some people drink coffee and like it, but it is very 
expensive, others just have Neo-caff. ( some even like that STUFF 
better than coffee! ) -- jim --

Coffee  On coffee: It\'s notoriously fickle regarding where it will 
grow, and how it tastes depends a great deal on the conditions that it 
was grown in.  I can see the coffee houses of the (Post)Imperium now, 
3100 flavors at your beck-and-call (for a price, of course...)  Or you 
can drink the local swill for 10Cr. steve@sunquest.com (SPG6) Humm 
Yeah I guess Cr.10 would be about right :-> unless you WANT Neo-caff

  At least in the case of the areas surrounding the RC, we might 
assume that any teddy mark in the world lists is a statement by the 
RCES giving any official or quasi-official party an \'open season\' on 
the government and that the mark in the world list reflects a current 
or future RCES classification, just like the Amber and Red zones were 
classifications actually issued by TAS reflecting their judgement and 
info about interdictions, instead of \'just\' a game-mechanic.

   It is like a \'most favored nation\' status in reverse. \'Government 
Non Grata\', \'Hunting Licence\'.

I mean, are these guys GREAT examples of HEROES, and GOOD GUYS, or 
what???  				----Steve Higginbotham

 the TNE book.. is there any mention on TAS (Traveller\'s Aid Society)? 
Just wondering if they are still in existance in the Regency.....

Thanks Heaps...

Internet:johann@jester.usask.ca

Why yes I noticed that the good ol\' TAS still existed in the Regency 
but not any where else. I think that they will be an interesting group 
to get the Regency players to head out into the wilds to see what is 
there. ;-)

There\'s also the potential for coasting missiles; the missiles would 
go "dead" for a large part of their flight and hope to avoid detection 
until they go active close enough to (hopefully) get in before 
defenses could defeat them.  If this tactic were extended to ships, I 
imagine space battles would look much like submarine combat...   In 
reference to detecting contra-gravity, I suspect that stealth contra-
gravity technologies would be developed; technologies to hide or 
disguise the detectable emissions.   Steven J. Owens uso01@unidata.com

Ya know I kinda like some of these ideas I did like "Star Cruiser" and 
the submarine like combat. On the stealth designs, I was working on a 
design that was a stealth ship she was going to be a peripheral part 
of the adventure but I thought of an added extra it is an AI (this 
definitely predates the Virus 1120 or thereabouts :-) ).

More T:TNE My first impression of the ship hull armor is that it is 
too weak  I Mean; I mean; I\'m just sittin\'\' here on the group W ... no 
that\'s Arlo Guthrie. When a grunt Tech level about 5 can use a Bazooka 
( See the Heavy Weapons book ) to punch through the the hull of ANY 
commercial craft Armor = 10, and any other except a Gazelle, or SDB. 
Has a chance on the Gazelle armour = 63. Most of the "Free" Traders I 
know are going to want do something about this Pronto! If the local 
gravel agitators find out that they can poke holes in the ship; it 
won\'t be long before they try just for grins and giggles. ( Yeah sure 
right !) With Super Dense (tm.) :-) I feel that the armor values too 
low unless I missed something here. ( My materials person will go on 
at great length about the impossibility of " SuperDense (tm.) " at the 
drop of a hat [ sometimes she drops it herself!] Loren, any comments?

there are other ways... ;-) ( Bwaaah Ha Ha )

Steve Higginbotham : Did  I note a bit of Nyah Nyah I told you so ! In 
that post??? although my science "nerd" is gritting her teeth ( hear 
it ?) She agrees that the Thrusters weren\'t so bad after all. ( gag 
choke.)

Well here is my chance to start another thread and also get flamed at 
the same time. :-) The other day one of my players and I were having 
coffee at my house and the conversation turned to the Zhodani ( did I 
see some ears perk up out there ? Scott 2G, Metlay? ) well any way 
here is some thoughts.

Imperial P.O.W.s they would quickly either be "re-educated" and fit 
into the Consulate, or send them send them back with a strong PSI 
suggestion that "Shooting people is BAD." the person\'s colleges and 
friends will think that he has been "Brain Washed" By those evil psi 
using brain sucking ... zho\'s this marks the end of that person\'s 
military career the Domain has come to realize that these are no 
longer functional with out a lot of work so they are given what they 
will need ot start an new life and are resettled.      Zhodani are 
horrified at the concept of prisons. They are not typically very 
patient people.      Their culture is slowly stagnating although very 
few would realize this and fewer still would admit it!      The 
Tavrchedl sends out pairs of agents to hunt down "Noble" "Law 
Breakers" ( they have broken the social contract in some way ) who 
move into the Imperium. In order to prevent the bad press of a psi 
using Zhodani doing bad things to the non psi\'s in the Imperium. This 
also sends a message to all potential such that this is not an option.

Remember: when it comes to the Tavrchedl: no matter where you go;           
There they are!      A noble member of the Tavrchedl is "Judge Dred", 
Judge, Jury, and Executioner. ( Oh Boy here come the flames... ;-) )

     Games: I\'ve seen a few but here is one that seems to be popular ( 
at least in our games...) Chess It is very popular ( the Zho\'s claim 
to have invented it :->, Really :-> ok you don;t believe me ) by the 
way the use of psi in a game is considered uncool, uh sorry "bad 
form". so her is one for ya all what do they do during the psionic 
games...? what kind of competitions. -- jim --

Here is another one for you all am I missing something or what happens 
when you negate gravity, does your ship leave as the planet turns 
under it? I have noted a bit of acidic posts here lately I think we 
can tone them down as we a falling into the I\'m right and you\'re wrong 
trap, and we do not need this here I\'d like to see more constructive 
posts. sorry about the length of this post but I have FINALLY! gotten 
on to the net so I\'ve been saving this up for some time...

"Gunpowder God" is the original Kalvan story published in _Analog_ magazine
about 1964, when _Analog_ was in it\'s 8.5X11 inch format.  "Gunpowder God"
was followed by several other Kalvan stories which were eventually edited
together and issued as the novel "Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen".  These stories
concern a man from our time accidentally moved "sideways" into a parallel
earth, where he uses his knowledge of our military history to influence
events in the other world.

I\'ve never read the other story described above, and I thought I had all
of Piper\'s works.  It sounds something like the "Star Viking" storyline,
but that\'s not it.  Can anyone identify this story more precisely?

I don\'t think there is any software specifically for TNE out yet.  There is
somework being done, it just isn\'t finished yet (after all how long has TNE
been available??)

Bertil is working on a hard times UWP crippler and I\'ve done a dice roller
for TNE on the Mac.  There is some other work being done, but I cannot
remember exactly what it is at the moment.  Check out the computer aided
traveller list if you are into software (Either: richard@agora.rain.com or
dan@engrg.uwo.ca should be able to help you get there).  Non-programmers are

   I think this one is in _The Worlds of H. Beam Piper_ - essentially a
collection of his stories that did not fit or did not make it into either his
THFH or Paratime collections.  Considering the state of my book-storage area,
I can\'t immediately confirm this.

Since I wrote the original article that Steve was answering, I went to my
bookshelf to check on the story.  It seems that I have not remembered the
title correctly: The "Space" version of the "Paratime" story "Gunpowder
God" can be found in the Ace collection _Federation_ (1981) under the
title "When in the Course--".  A preface to the story by John Carr tells
how the story was found among Piper\'s papers long after his death, with no
explanations attached, although it was possibly submitted to Analog before
being revised into "Gunpowder God".

Each entry identifies severity of the error and provides enough
information to find it on the page.  The severity scale is set out on the
table below.


Severity and Number Occurring 

TYPO	(19)	Typographical or spelling error with no impact on game
		play.

NIT	(46)	Factual or logical error with minimal impact on game play.

MINOR	(37)	Factual or logical error that may cause confusion, but has
		minor impact on game play and should have no impact on
		future products.

MAJOR	(3)	An error which may seriously affect game play, or may have
		serious impact on future products.

SEVERE	(6)	An error which makes a section of the rules unplayable as
		published.


Each entry then describes what is in error, and provides a suggested fix
for the problem.  In some cases, several different fixes are possible; the
preferable one is listed first, with alternates following it.

Some entries have commentary, which explain why the item is believed to be
in error, provide the rationale used to construct the fix, or discuss the
merits of the alternate fixes.

Each entry closes with an attribution, the person who first reported the
error to me (in many cases, multiple people have spotted each error; many

Commentary: The table in T:TNE seems to have suffered from missing tabs;
Chris\' reconstruction inserted the tabs where they should go.  However,
T:TNE has a -2 modifier for Government type E (Religious Oligarchy), where
MegaTraveller and Classic Traveller had a -2 for Government type D
(Religious Autocracy) and no modifier for Religious Oligarchy.  I have
changed the table to agree with Classic Traveller.  
								---- CO, GG

MAJOR: pp.187, Step 12: Trade Classifications table
The "Fl" code should apply only to worlds with atmospheres A-C; types D, E,
and F have regions that are human-habitable, and therefore probably have
liquid water oceans.  In addition, a world should only be barren ("Ba") if
its population multiplier is also zero; conversely, a world must have a
non-zero population multiplier in order to be non-industrial ("Ni").
Fix: Alter the "Fl" line of the table; replace atmosphere code "A+" with
"A-C".  Add a note to the bottom of the table which states "A Barren world
must have a zero population multiplier; a Non-Industrial world must have a
non-zero population multiplier."
								---- GS

MAJOR: pp.190, Step 1: Maximum Sustainable Population
Atmosphere types D, E, and F have regions that are human-habitable, and
therefore the ruling that "human life is not possible and the world is
uninhabited" should not apply to these worlds.
Fix: Replace the sentence with: "If the atmosphere is 0, 1, 2, 3, A, B, or
C, human life is not possible and the world is uninhabited: reduce the UWP
population code and population multiplier each to 0."  Also insert the
following line to the Maximum Sustainable Population table, in the
Atmosphere section: "Factor: Atmos D, E, F  Modification: -3".
								---- GS

MAJOR: pp.191, Step 7: Government (impacts other parts of UWP generation)
The "Government Types in the Wilds" table describes an alternate coding for
government types, to be used in the Wilds.  For example, Government 7 is
normally a Balkanized world, however in the wilds it is to be interpreted
as a Mystic Dictatorship.  There is unfortunately no way to determine which
interpretation is to be used from any information in the UWP.

Fix: Modifications are made in several places to the world generation
procedures so that the government types for the wilds are more completely
integrated into the Traveller UWP system.

On pp.183, "Government" paragraph, add the following to the end of the
paragraph: "Many balkanized worlds have a most common government type, or a
most important territory.  Re-roll the government type throw to generate
this government type (ignore and re-roll any further balkanized results),
and note it with a B:# (where # is the government code) in the world\'s
trade classifications."

On pp.188, "World Government" table, change the following entries:

Code  General Description

0 ---- No Government Structure.  In many cases family, clan, or tribal
      bonds predominate,
D ---- Religious Dictatorship.  Government by a religious, mystic, or psionic
      minority which has little regard for the needs of the citizenry.
E ---- Religious Autocracy.  Government by a single religious, mystic, or
      psionic leader having absolute power over the citizenry.

On pp.191, paragraph 7, "Government", change the entry to read:

"First determine if the world is balkanized.  Add the world size and
population code and subtract the tech level to determine the balkanization
number.  Roll 2d6; if the number rolled is equal to less than the
balkanization number, the world is balkanized.  In this case, the
government type is 7.  Determine the most common government type using the
procedure below, and note it in the world\'s trade classifications, using
the B:# convention (where # is the government code).  This most common
government type may be a TED, if conditions are suitable.

"Second, if the world\'s population code is 5+, determine the presence of
Technologically Elevated Dictators (TED).  Find the total number of tech
levels lost in Step 2 and roll 1d10.  If the roll is less than the number
of tech levels lost, the world\'s government automatically becomes a TED. 
Place the code Td to indicate this in the world\'s allegiance code, and roll
2d6 on the TED Government Type table to determine the form of the TED
government.  Find the result of the die roll on the table; the
corresponding code is the world\'s government type.

"If the roll is equal to or greater than the tech level decline, or if the
world\'s population code is 4 or less, determine the government type by
rolling 2d6 - 7 + Population code.  Record this number for future reference
when determining the world\'s law level in Step 8.  Find this result on the
Government Types in the Wilds table; the corresponding code is the world\'s
government type.

On pp.191, "Government Types in the Wilds" table, replace the current table
with the following:

Die   Code  General Description
Roll

 1- - 0 ---- No Government
 2  - 2 ---- Participating Democracy
 3  - 4 ---- Representative Democracy
 4  - A ---- Charismatic Dictatorship
 5  - C ---- Charismatic Oligarchy
 6  - Roll 2d6 on the "TED Government Type" table, and note Allegiance = Td
 7  - D ---- Religious Dictatorship
 8  - F ---- Totalitarian Oligarchy
 9  - E ---- Religious Autocracy
10  - 8 ---- Civil Service Bureaucracy
11  - 3 ---- Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy
12+ - 9 ---- Impersonal Bureaucracy

On pp.191, "TED Government Type" table, add the following new table:

Die   Code  General Description
Roll

 2 ---- 5 ---- Feudal Technocracy
 3 ---- 3 ---- Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy
 4 ---- 6 ---- Captive Government
 5 ---- B ---- Non-Charismatic Leader
 6 ---- B ---- Non-Charismatic Leader
 7 ---- F ---- Totalitarian Oligarchy
 8 ---- F ---- Totalitarian Oligarchy
 9 ---- E ---- Religious Autocracy
10 ---- D ---- Religious Dictatorship
11 ---- A ---- Charismatic Dictatorship
12 ---- C ---- Charismatic Oligarchy

On pp.191, paragraph 8, "Law Level", change the entry to read:

"If the world is balkanized, the law level represents the most commonly
encountered law level on the world.  Roll 2d6 to determine the most
commonly encountered law level of a balkanized world.  The referee can
determine the law levels of individual nations on a case by case basis,
using the procedure described below for non-TED, non-balkanized worlds.

"If the world government is a TED, then roll 2d6+3 to determine the world\'s
law level.

"Otherwise, roll 2d6-7 and add the world government die roll (recorded in
Step 7 above) to determine the law level."

Commentary: There is no digit, field, or position in the UWP which
designates a world as being in the wilds.  Therefore it is impossible to
determine (without some knowledge outside of the UWP) the government type
of a world.  In addition to being extremely confusing to the referee and
players, this also plays havoc with the trade and commerce rules. 
Ordinarily, a world with a Charismatic Dictators, Totalitarian Oligarchy,
or Religious Dictator is disqualified from the Rich classification, but in
the Wilds, Charismatic Dictators, Oligarchies, TEDs, and Mystic Dictators
are required to have a Rich world?  Rich worlds make good trading partners,
but I though TEDs were supposed to violently discourage off-world contact.

After discussing the problem on TML, the most reasonable conclusion is that
governments in the wilds are just a different distribution of the same
government types we have seen before.  The primary goal was to create a
single table of government types which could be used no matter where the
world was located.  An examination of the original "Government Types in the
Wilds" table revealed that all but four of the government types were
identical to ones already in use in the "Normal" government types table
(although with different code values or slightly expanded definitions). 

Of the four new codes, "Mystic Dictatorship" and "Mystic Autocracy" were
defined nearly the same way as "Religious Dictatorship" and "Religious
Autocracy", except for two words ("or psionic") in the general description.
Since I, for one, have had psionic religions in my Traveller games for more
than ten years, I didn\'t see much difference between the two, and folded
them together.  Two down and two to go.

The "Tribal Government" is an interesting idea; kind of a half-step between
no government whatsoever and a more formal government.  With some
hesitation, I folded it into "No Government"; if a new set of government
codes were to be devised, this one in particular should get its own code.

The last code is "Technologically Elevated Dictator (TED)".  The more I
think about this one, the more I feel that this classification isn\'t
really a government type, but rather a classification decision made by some
other interstellar government or agency.  The case of Plaven (setting for
the Classic Traveller "Divine Intervention" double adventure) is a case in
point.  If Plaven were a few parsecs outside the Reformation Coalition, it
would be considered a TED; inside the Domain of Deneb, it\'s just another
Religious Dictatorship.

Any of the more oppressive government types could be (or could become) a
TED, provided that they  meet the criteria: use of relic or other advanced
technology to maintain their rule, and a certain amount of unfriendliness
to interstellar visitors (Reformation Coalition in particular).

Thus, the decision that a TED was better represented by a government code
that indicated what form the government actually took, plus a note that it
is considered a TED (or, for those worlds outside the Star Viking sphere of
influence, would be considered a TED, if the RCES knew about the world). 
The TED code is placed in the Allegiance field, because it is unused in the
wilds, and also because a TED by definition will not be a part of an
interstellar state.

The retroactive changes required to implement this change should be minor;
only materials produced with the uncorrected T:TNE rules, and which use the
Wilds government type table will need to be changed.  The following table
summarizes the corrections needed:

Old   New
Code  Code

0 ---- 0
1 ---- 0
2 ---- 2
3 ---- 4
4 ---- A
5 ---- C
6 ---- Roll 2d6 on the "TED Government Type" table) Allegiance = Td
7 ---- D
8 ---- F
9 ---- E
A ---- 8
B ---- 3
C ---- 9

A couple of caveats are in order, however.  First of all, UWPs generated
using the uncorrected procedure provides no way of determining if the world
is balkanized.  The table above ignores this; the preferable solution would
be to test for a balkanized world as described in the modified paragraph 7
above.
								---- GG

MINOR: pp.18, Homeworld Die Roll Modifiers table
With a starport DM of +9 for characters in the wilds, it is not possible
with a 2d6 roll to get a starport class D.
Fix: Add a statement that the referee can alter the starport DMs, or
mandate a specific starport value.

Commentary: While the rules as published are probably representative of the
types of starports in the wilds, it is probably not representative of the
types of worlds that the PCs will come from in the Wilds.
								---- MG

MINOR: pp.18, Homeworld Die Roll Modifiers table
The starport DM for characters in the Old Expanses is higher than that for

While specific descriptions for UWP code values can be found in the world
building section, no such correlation can be found anywhere for government

								---- MG

MINOR: pp.107, Character Attributes and Skills
In the second line of the first column, reference is made to attributes in
the range of 1 to 13.  This is incorrect; the attribute maximum is 15.
Fix: The sentence should read: "These numbers range between 1 and 15, with
15 being the best."
								---- GG

MINOR: pp.113, pp.115, pp.116: Astrogation skill
Astrogation is listed as (EDU) in pp.115 and pp.116; however it is listed
as (INT) on pp.113.
Fix: Correct the entry on pp.113 to "(EDU)".

Commentary: Other skills may have this problem, every entry has not been
cross-checked.
								---- BJ

MINOR: pp.124-125, Pilot Skill
The last sentence on pp.124, part of the description of the Fixed Wing
cascade, indicates that x-wing aircraft use the pilot skill appropriate to
their current mode of travel.  However, the Rotary Wing cascade on pp.125
indicates that x-wing aircraft should use the Fixed Wing skill at all
times.
Fix: Convertible fixed/rotary wing aircraft (including tilt-rotor, x-wing,
and other rotary wing vehicles which can lock their blades in flight) use
whichever cascade is appropriate to their current mode of flight.  Delete
the portion of the Rotary Wing description which indicates otherwise; the
last sentence should read "Compound helicopters which still derive lift from
moving rotors use this cascade."

MINOR: pp.187, Step 12: Trade Classifications table
Low population worlds were defined in MegaTraveller as those with
populations 3-.  My edition of Classic Traveller does not define this code.
T:TNE specifies a population of 4-, but apparently uses the old criteria in
some starmaps (see Kruyter and Fuetz on pp.88).
Fix: Alter the "Lo" line of the table to specify population "3-".
								---- GG, GS

MINOR: pp.187, Step 14: Population Multiplier
The procedure described is correct for any world with a population digit of
1+.  It is probably wrong for population zero worlds.
Fix: Append to the rules: "If the world population level is 0, roll 1D6; on
a 2+, the world is uninhabited: the population multiplier is 0."
								---- GS, GG

MINOR: pp.188, World Population table
There is no population level to correspond to "Incidental", which is used
on the Homeworld Generation Table.
Fix: Population 0 should be "Incidental", not "Low".
								---- MG

MINOR: pp.192, Step 5: Decimal Classification
The instructions in the table don\'t mention the special cases: There are no
O0 through O4 stars, and dwarf stars (class D) don\'t have a decimal
classification.
Fix: Add the following instruction to the step: "3.  There are no O0
through O4 stars; ignore and re-roll these results.  Dwarf stars
(luminosity class D) do not have a decimal classification."
								---- GG

MINOR: pp.192, Step 15: Orbit Zones for Luminosity Class Ib
Stellar classes K5 and M0 have no habitable zone, and classes M5 and M9
have two.
Fix: Class K5 and M0 stars should have a habitable zone in orbit 11. 
Classes M5 and M9 should have an inner zone in orbit 11, and a habitable
zone in orbit 12.
								---- GS

MINOR: pp.194, Step 32: Population
Population for minor worlds can be non-zero even if the mainworld is
uninhabited, or has a pre-spaceflight TL.  This is a problem, since the
trade classifications are based on the "main world".
Fix: Add to the following sentences to the instructions: "If atmosphere is
not 0, 5, 6, or 8, DM -2.  If the main world has already been generated,
reduce the population to one less than that of the main world.  Populations
of less than 0 are reduced to 0."
								---- GS, GG

MINOR: pp.194, Step 34: Satellite Size
The size of a world\'s satellites are generated by 1D6 - World Size.  Since
this allows size 1 worlds to have as many as several size 2 through 5
"satellites", this is clearly wrong.
Fix: The die roll should be "World Size - 1D6".
								---- GS

MINOR: pp.195, Step 42: Facilities
Both Mining facilities and Military facilities use the same code.
Fix: To eliminate confusion, Mining facilities should use code "Mn".

from 0 to 6+.
Fix: The table should also use the DMs from the Encounter Likelihood table.
								---- BJ

MINOR: pp228-229, Starship Encounters
The DMs for ship encounters in the wilds produce an alarming number of
Vampire ships.
Fix: Add a note to the effect that "The referee should not feel obligated
to implement a vampire, but treat the encounter as \'No Encounter\' if he or
she chooses."
								-- MG

Commentary: The space travel procedure specifies checking for starship
encounters at least four times during an interstellar trip.  In the wilds,
about a third of these checks will result in a ship.  This works out to
about a 19.75% chance that no ship will be encountered.  To achieve this
rate, that means that there are at least a couple thousand starships
operating in the former Third Imperium, and possibly considerably more.  Of
these, about a sixth will be Vampires, giving us three to four hundred
vampire ships remaining in the former Third Imperium.  This is exclusive of
all ships operating as part of the Regency, Reformation Coalition, or a
pocket empire.

MINOR: pp.236, Step 3: Passengers
No die roll is provided for the number of steerage passengers, however a
die roll modifier is supplied for this (nonexistent) roll.
Fix: Roll the dice as indicated in the "Low" column to determine the number
of steerage passengers.  Credit the ship with Cr2500 per steerage
passenger.
								---- GG

MINOR: pp.236, Step 4: Freight and Cargo
It is not clear if the die roll modifiers apply to the number of lots, the
size of the lots, or both.
Fix: Add the following instruction to the die roll modifiers: "Apply the
following die roll modifiers to the rolls for the number of lots
available."
								---- GG

MINOR: pp.237, Step 7: Nature of Cargo
Some worlds don\'t have any trade classifications at all.
Fix: Add the instruction "Worlds with no trade classifications use table
8f".
								---- MG

MINOR: pp.243, Parts
The rules require the use of replacement parts to repair breakdowns, and
mention that replacement parts can frequently be purchased.  There are no
guidelines on the cost, volume, or mass of such parts, however.
Fix: Append some guidelines to help the referee determine the cost, mass,
and volume of repair parts.
								---- BJ

MINOR: pp.260, Battle Damage (vehicular robots)
The last paragraph on the page seems to refer to damage to the robot\'s
weaponry.
Fix: Insert an italicized "Main Armament:" before this paragraph.
								---- MG

MINOR: pp.306, Blister Agent
The last sentence of the paragraph states that "both masks and protective
suits" are required to be worn in order to be safe from blister
agents.  Particularly in light of the following section, this can be
confusing.
Fix: Change the sentence to read: "Characters wearing both masks and
protective suits, or wearing pressure suits (such as a vacc suit, combat
environment suit, combat armor, battle dress, etc.) are unaffected by
blister agents."
								---- GG

MINOR: pp.306, Nerve Gas
The second paragraph of this section states that one must wear "a
protective suit or pressure suit ... and a gas mask" in order to be
protected.  I wasn\'t aware that pressure suits (such as a vacc suit) leaked
when worn without a gas mask.
Fix: Change the last sentence of the paragraph to read: "Characters wearing
both masks and protective suits, or wearing pressure suits (such as a vacc
suit, combat environment suit, combat armor, battle dress, etc.) are
unaffected by nerve gas."
								---- GG

MINOR: pp.313, Speed Change and Compute New Range
The rules err by a factor of two when computing the velocity change due to
each G-turn of acceleration.  In addition, the velocity change is treated
as if it occurred instantly at the beginning of the turn.

Fix: Modify the "Speed Change" and "Compute New Range" paragraphs on
pp.313-314 to read as follows:

"Speed Change: Each ship may spend a number of G-turns limited by its G
rating (maneuver performance) in order to modify the closing velocity. 
Each G-turn of acceleration spent by a ship changes the closing velocity
for the next turn by one.  In addition, each 2 G-turns of acceleration
spent changes the closing velocity for the current turn by one (drop
fractions).  The closing velocity may be increased or decreased.  As
G-turns of acceleration are spent, players must declare whether they are
going to increase or decrease the closing velocity."

"Compute New Range: At the end of each turn, subtract the current closing
velocity (the velocity for this turn as computed above) from the current
range to get the new range for the next turn.  When the closing velocity is
a negative number, remember that subtracting a negative number is the same
as adding a positive number, thus actually increasing the range."

Alternate: The above, while accurately reflecting Newtonian physics, may
seem too complicated for some players.  Thus, the suggested simplified fix
is to alter the "Speed Change" and "Compute New Range" paragraphs on
pp.313-314 to read:

"Speed Change: Each ship may spend a number of G-turns limited by its G
rating (maneuver performance) in order to modify the closing velocity. 
Each G-turn of acceleration spent by a ship changes the closing velocity
for the next turn by one.  The closing velocity may be increased or
decreased.  As G-turns of acceleration are spent, players must declare
whether they are going to increase or decrease the closing velocity.

"Compute New Range: At the end of each turn, subtract the current closing
velocity (before the speed changes above) from the current range to get the
new range for the next turn.  When the closing velocity is a negative
number, remember that subtracting negative number is the same as adding a
positive number, thus actually increasing the range."

Commentary: From basic Newtonian physics, if acceleration is constant,
velocity is acceleration multiplied by time (V=A*T), and the distance
traveled is half of acceleration multiplied by time squared (D=1/2*A*T^2).

If Acceleration (A) is a constant 1g, then	A = 10 m/s^2 (1g)
Velocity (V) is acceleration times the time	V = 10 m/s^2 * 30 min
spent at that acceleration.			  = 10 m/s^2 * 1800 s
						  = 1800 m/s (64800 kph)
The Distance (D) traveled during this	D = 0.5 * 10 m/s^2 * (1800 s) ^2
acceleration is half the acceleration	  = 5 m/s^2 * 3240000 s^2
time the time squared.			  = 16,200,000 m

Putting this into T:TNE space combat terms, a velocity of 1 is one range
band per combat turn (30,000 km per 30 min; 60,000 kph).  A distance of 1
is one range band, 30,000 km, and the unit of time is a turn (30 minutes;
1800 s).

So, each G-Turn of acceleration increases the ship\'s velocity for the next
turn by slightly over 1 band/turn.  The distance traveled in the  current
turn during this acceleration is slightly more than a half a range band
per G-turn of acceleration expended, plus whatever distance is traveled due
to the velocity the ship started the turn with.

To help clarify what\'s going on, the following examples presume that a
standard Scout/Courier (maneuver 2G) is closing in at velocity 4 on a
patrol ship which is station-keeping 8 range bands away.  The scout ship
wants to brake to a stop as quickly as possible.  In all cases, the ship
brakes at 2g (2 G-Turns of acceleration) at a cost of 1 G-Hour of fuel
each turn.

Newtonian Physics: A = 20 m/s^2. V = 66667 m/s (240000 kph).  Solving for
T, we get the time to decelerate to a stop is T = 3333 s (55.6 min; or
about 2 turns).  Distance traveled while stopping is 111111 km (about 3.7
range bands).  Rounding fraction, we say that the ship is stopped at the
end of the second turn, 4 range bands from the patrol ship.

Using T:TNE as published, in the first turn, the scout/courier begins
braking.  Velocity changes by 1; the new velocity is 3, and the new range
is 5.  In the second turn, the scout continues braking; new velocity 2, new
range 3.  Turn 3: velocity 1, range 2.  Turn 4: the scout comes to a stop
at a range of 2.

With the fix, in the first turn, the current velocity decreases by 1, to 3,
and the next turn\'s velocity decreases by 2, to 2; the new range is 5.  In
the second turn, braking continues.  Current velocity drops by 1, to 1, and
the new velocity decreases by 2, to 0.  The ship will stop at the end of
the turn, and the new range is 4.

In the alternate scenario, the scout begins braking.  In the first turn, 
the next turn\'s velocity decreases by 2, to 2.  The new range is 6
(remember, the new range is figured with the old velocity).  In the second
turn, the current velocity is 2, the new velocity is 0, and the range is 4.

MINOR: pp.314, Evasion
The reference to "G-Hours" in the penultimate line on the left-hand column
is spurious.
Fix: Replace "G-Hours" with "G-Turns".
								---- GG

MINOR: pp.325, Hit Location table
This table and related notes, located in the bottom left corner of the
page, does not seem to be referenced by the text or by any of the
procedures on the page.
Fix: Delete the table.
								---- GG

MINOR: pp.337, Thermal Meteoroid Garments
These garments are listed as "armor 6, cloth-1" on the table.  Presumably
this is a hold-over from MegaTraveller.  In T:TNE terms, this is protection
equivalent to TL-12 battle dress, and for only Cr 400.
Fix: The armor value of Thermal Meteoroid Garments should be 1.
								---- BJ, GG

MINOR: pp.337, Long-Range Thruster Pack
The text, located  at the bottom of the left-hand column), states that this
device is capable of 2 Gs of thrust for 48 hours; that\'s 96 G-Hours.
Fix: Replace the last sentence of the column with: "The Long-Range Thruster
pack (LRTP) is heavy, but it provides up to 1/2 G acceleration for up to 4
hours, using standard starship fuel."

Commentary: Who needs a grav belt!  A Long-Range Thruster Pack has enough
acceleration to lift off of any terrestrial world, and with 48 hours
endurance, can hover indefinitely; all for a seventh the cost.  To put it
in perspective, this little device is capable of more than 13 round-trips
from the Earth to the Moon without refueling.
								---- BJ, GG

MINOR: pp.357, Grenades
The statistics for ordinary Hand Grenades seems to have been omitted.
Fix: Locate and insert this information.
								---- KH

MINOR: pp.368, Free Trader Damage Tables
Areas 17, 18, and 19 have no result listed, while areas 5 - 13 duplicate
entries listed elsewhere.
Fix: Remove the "5 - 13" entry, and move the "17, 18, 19" entry up one line
(so that these rolls indicate Engineering damage).
								---- MG

MINOR: pp.375, Donosev Class Survey Ship Damage Tables
Areas 12 - 15 do not appear on the damage tables.  While dispersed
structure ships may have hit locations which result in a miss, such areas
should be clearly labeled, if for no other reason that to assure the
reader that no mistake was made.  In any case, the Donosev Class ship
should not be a dispersed structure vessel.
Fix: Correct the damage table.
								---- MG, GG

MINOR: pp.376, Subsidized Liner Damage Tables
Area 13 is listed twice, once as "13 - 17", and once as "11 - 13".
Fix: Alter the first occurrence to read "14 - 17".
								---- MG

MINOR: pp.377, Broadsword Class Mercenary Cruiser Damage Tables
Area 12 is listed twice, once as "12 - 15", and once as "6 - 12".

NIT: pp.17, Homeworld Random Generation Table
The chart of DMs is on the next page, making it easy to overlook and hard
to use.
Fix: Add a mention on the Homeworld Random Generation Table that the table
of modifiers on the next page.
								---- MG, GG

Commentary: I recommend that some of the more important charts be reprinted
in a small (16 page or so) booklet form and included in T:TNE Deluxe or the
T:TNE Referees\' Screen.  If this is done, the Homeworld Random Generation
table and its chart of DMs should be on the same page.
								---- MG

NIT: pp.19, Homeworld Effects on Attributes
The modifiers are buried in the text, and difficult to find.
Fix: Place a table of the modifiers on the character generation worksheet.
								---- MG

NIT: pp.23, Background Skills
The background skills are not noted on the character generation worksheet.
Fix: Place a table of background skills on the character generation
worksheet.
								---- MG

NIT: pp.26, Secondary Activities
According to the information on pp.20, some careers offer the chance for
characters to increase their attributes.  However, the only careers that 
allow such increases are Athlete and Martial Artist.
Fix: Allow attribute increases as a secondary activity; two skill levels
for one attribute increase, up to a maximum of +2.
								---- BJ, GG

NIT: pp.40, Undergraduate University
According to the contacts available, the only people who ever attend
undergraduate universities are the professors and researchers, and
journalists.  No engineering, pre-med, history, law, or business students.
Fix: Contacts at Undergraduate University may be from potentially any
career.  The referee should decide what that person\'s field of study was at
the time, and any subsequent career changes.  
Alternate fix: Expand the definition of academic contacts to include
students (of potentially any field of study.  The refere is responsible for
determining what career the contact is currently pursuing. It may be
completely unrelated to his or her field of study.  In this case,
journalist contacts should be removed from Undergraduate University.
								---- GG

NIT: pp.40, Graduate University
The comments above about undergraduate university also apply to graduate
university.  There is, however, a higher probability that the contact will
be pursuing a career in a field related to his or her graduate studies.
Fix: Contacts at Graduate University may be from potentially any career.
The referee should decide what that person\'s field of study was at the
time, and any subsequent career changes.
Alternate fix: As above, and Government contacts should be removed from
Graduate University.
								---- GG

NIT: pp.56, Career Entry Requirements table
Contrary to the table\'s explanatory remarks, there are no careers listed
that have an education requirement in parentheses.
Fix: The last sentence should read: "Social Standing requirements in
parentheses show what is required to enter the career with a commission."  
The following table entries also need to be changed: Scientist and 
Aviation should show a minimum Soc of "(6+)".  Army, Marines, and Special 
Operations should have a minimum Soc of "(5+)".  Navy and Wet Navy should 
have a minimum Soc of "(7+)".
								---- GG

NIT: pp.57, Table of Ranks
At only one promotion per term, it will take a significant number of terms
to achieve a higher rank.  While this may be reasonable for officers, it is
not for the enlisted ranks.
Fix: Use a shorter enlisted rank structure as per Twilight: 2000 (2nd ed.).
								---- MG

NIT: pp.88, Nicosa Subsector data
Bhule, at hex 0334, should not be Industrial; it has atmosphere type 1,
which disqualifies it.
Fix: Remove "In" from the trade classifications for this world.
								---- GS

NIT: pp.94, Special Wilds Careers
Recommend adding a Psionic Priesthood and a Survivor career.  An NPC
template is provided for the latter, and it is one PCs from the wilds are
sure to be interested in.
Fix: Add the careers; possibly in a Challenge article or a special
supplement to Deluxe T:TNE.
								---- MG

NIT: pp.103, Khulam Subsector data
Several of the entries contain errors.
Fix: World 049-049 in hex 2839 should be trade class "Po".  Gresham in hex
3138 should not be "In".  Futok in hex 3140 should be "Ag".  The size class
VI stars at Agiruur (hex 3036) and Futok (hex 3140) should be "V".
								---- GS

Commentary: Sub-dwarf stars, luminosity class VI, which appeared in Classic
Traveller book 6, have apparently been removed from T:TNE.  Presumably this
was done on purpose, as the luminosity class tables (Steps 4 and 5 on
pp.192) have been completely changed.  If so, any references to luminosity
class VI stars remaining from Classic Traveller data files should be
revised.
								---- GG

NIT: pp.104, Khulam Subsector data
The world Quarry in hex 2933 now has tech level 3, but orbits a class M9 V
star, which has no habitable zone.
Fix: Make the world barren.
								---- GS

NIT: pp.106, Task Resolution and Skills
The second paragraph of the overview reads in part: "This chapter is
presented here, before character generation ...".  I hate to break the
news, but character generation starts back on pp.14, over 90 pages before.
Fix: Delete references to character generation following this section.
Alternate Fix: Move the section (pp.106-111) to begin around pp.14
								---- GG

NIT: pp.168, The Regency
The first sentence of the paragraph implies that Norris used to be First
Regent of the Domain of Deneb, until he renamed it "The Regency", at which
point he became Archduke.  This is exactly backwards.
Fix: The first sentence should read: "The Regency is the new name of the
Domain of Deneb by First Regent, then Archduke of Deneb, Norris."
								---- GG

NIT: pp.172, Regina subsector data
Several of the entries contain errors.
Fix: Knorbes in hex 1807 should not be "Ag".  Pscias in hex 2106 should be
"Ag".  Enope in hex 2205 should not be "In", but should be "Ic".  Heya in
hex 2402 should not be "Ag".  Rethe in hex 2408 should be "In".  Kinorb in
hex 2202 should be tech level 8.
								---- GS

NIT: pp.172, Regina subsector data
Three worlds have dim stars with no habitable zones, but have world data
inconsistent with their primaries.  The worlds are Algine in hex 2308,
which has a tech level 4 civilization.  Moughas at hex 2406 is supposed to
be a water world, although liquid water is not possible on its surface. 
Uakye was established as a habitable, although cold, in "A Plague of
Perruques" (Travellers\' Digest #10) by Marc Miller and Gary L. Thomas.
Fix: Change Algine (hex 2308) to a M9 III.  Change Moughas (hex 2406) to a
K9 V.  Change Uakye (hex 1805) to a M0 V.
								---- GS

NIT: pp.172, Regina subsector map
Yorbund, at hex 2303, is shown as having water.  In fact, it has no water;
its oceans are fluid.
Fix: Change the map symbol for the world.

NIT: pp.178, Ershur Subsector data
The world of Towering has no trade classifications, and is missing a tab
needed to make its data align with the other entries.
Fix: Insert the tab.
								---- GS

NIT: pp.178, Ershur Subsector data
Barren worlds, like Observatory, do not have any trade classifications
other than "Ba".
Fix: Observatory in hex 0807 should not be "Lo", "Ni", or "Po".  
								---- GS

NIT: pp.178, Ershur Subsector data
There are several errors in the stellar data.  Villana has a tech level too
low for survival in a system that has no habitable zone.  There are also no
size class VI stars.
Fix: Change Villana at hex 0801 to a M9 III star.  Change the class VI
stars at Fournier (0304), Thallium (0307), Cleves (0403), Lebenstraum
(0503), Chamati (0602), and Raldery IV (0701) to class V.
								---- GS

The planetary density table is way over on pp.190; hard to find and hard to
remember.
Fix: Add a note to the step referencing the density table on pp.190.
								---- MG

NIT: pp.188, World Size table
The table is missing the sizes for large and small gas giants.
Fix: Small Gas Giants have a minimum diameter of 20,000km and a maximum
diameter of 59,999km.  Large Gas Giants have a minimum diameter of 60,000km
and a maximum diameter of 120,000km.

NIT: pp.189, World Physical Data table
The entry for hydrographics code 3 indicates "Dry".
Fix: It should read "Wet".
								---- MG

NIT: pp.193, Step 13: Orbit Zones
No instructions are given for stars whose spectral classification falls
between the table entries.
Fix: Add the instruction "If the spectral class of the star in question is
not on the table, use the column of the nearest listed spectral class.  For
example, a G3 star would use the G5 column of the table."
								---- JD

NIT: pp.198, Terrain and Travel
Mention should be made in this section that flying vehicles, including
helicopters, aircraft, and grav vehicles may choose to fly above the

velocity in these calculations is adhered to, though many of the numbers in
the size-0 column are small enough that the assumption is not really valid.
The value for 0.1 G-Hour and a size 0 world is ASSUMED to be correct,
just because I have no reason to believe that there IS a correct answer to
that particular question.  Other values for the size-0 case are based upon
this. It is assumed that Neptune is the size of the generic Small Gas
Giant.  Neptune has a diameter of ~49,000Km.  It is assumed that Jupiter is
the size of the generic Large Gas Giant.  Jupiter has a diameter of
~138,000Km.
								---- SH

Commentary: Steve\'s calculations for large and small gas giants were
corrected to Traveller "Standard" large and small gas giants (120,000km and
60,000km, respectively).  For small gas giants, Steve\'s values were
multiplied by 60/49 (or about 1.224); for large gas giants, the factor was
120/138 (or about 0.8696).

NIT: pp.226, Step 10: Emerge from Jump Space
The second sentence of the second paragraph is confusing at best.
Fix: Replace the second sentence with: "Outstanding Success indicates that
no course correction is needed; the ship\'s exit point is correctly
positioned so its residual velocity will take it from 100 diameters to 10
diameters."

Commentary: Note that any distance over ~120,000 light seconds will take
the fastest ship listed in T:TNE over one year to cross, so the parts of
this table dealing with the orbits 13+ are especially meaningless. Note
also that any ship can jump to any orbit 7+ faster than it can cross the
distance in normal space. Finally, the entries that were correct in the
initial tables are marked with an \'*\' (all 22 of them)
								---- SH

NIT: pp.227, Step 14: Interplanetary Speed table
The table as presented is incorrect in every entry.
Fix: The corrected table follows:

Interplanetary Speed

          Time (min)
G-Hours
     1       142
     2        71
     3        47
     4        35
     5        28

     7        20
     8        18
     9        16

Commentary: Note that these values are about 25% lower than those on the
original table.  Which means transits are 25% FASTER.
								---- SH

NIT: pp.241, Potential Breakdowns
The wear and potential breakdown rules are presumably to be applied to
starships as well as other types of equipment.  However, there is a rather
sticky problem: consider a starship in jump space.  If the ship\'s power
plant fails, life support will stop, and everybody aboard the ship will die
in a number of hours.  
Fix: Unlike vehicles, starship systems should be designed for 24 hour a
day, 7 day a week performance.  Roll for potential breakdowns twice per 
week (once on leaving orbit, and once on exit from jump space) instead of 
once per 8 hours.
Alternate fix: Assume the starships vital systems (power plant and life
support as a minimum) have integral multiply-redundant internal backups, so
that breakdowns are not life-threatening unless ignored for more than a
week.

Commentary: There are 21 8-hour periods in a typical 7 day jump; for a
power plant with a wear value of 1, this is a 74.5% chance that a potential
breakdown will occur within the first 4 days of the jump.  Assuming that
the engineer has a relevant asset of 10, there is an 87.5% chance that
there will be an actual breakdown sometime during the next day.  Overall
about a 65.2% chance of a power failure sometime during the jump.
								---- GG

NIT: pp.242, Increasing Wear; last paragraph in the section
When keeping separate track of the wear value individual components
separately, care must be taken to keep the combination under control.  
Fix: When tracking the wear value of components separately, the referee
should assign wear values that are no greater than the overall wear value
of the vehicle.  Each period, only one die roll is made.  It the number
rolled is greater than the overall wear value of the vehicle, no potential
breakdown occurs.  If a potential breakdown does occur, the referee must
randomly choose one component from all those components with a wear value
less than or equal to the number rolled.  As component wear values change,
the vehicle\'s overall wear value is the same as the highest wear value of
any of the components.

Commentary: For example, a vehicle with wear value of 5 is broken down into
4 components, each of which are given a wear value of 5.  If 4 rolls, one
for each of the components, are made each period, there is a 93.75% chance
that at least one of the components will have a potential breakdown each
period; effectively a wear value of 10.  With the fixed rules, potential
breakdowns still occur only 50% of the time.
								---- GG

NIT: pp.248, Psionics Skill Cluster
The Foreboding skill of the arcana sub-cluster is missing from the table,
but present in the text.
Fix: Add it to the table.
								---- GG

NIT: pp.258, Psionics
The descriptions of the effects of the different power levels is buried in
the text, and hard to pick out.
Fix: Prepare a table listing these effects.

This guard robot looks strangely like a Zhodani warbot.
								---- MG

NIT: pp.273, SAR (Single Action Revolver)
A single-acting revolver can be "fanned".  This consists of holding the
trigger back and rapidly cocking and releasing the hammer with the other
hand (much easier to demonstrate than to explain).
Fix: Single-acting revolvers can be "fanned"; firing up to three rounds per
fire action.  "Fanning" also increases the difficulty of all of the shots
by one level.
								---- GG

NIT: pp.313, third line from the top in the left-hand column
There are no damage control rules at right, or anywhere else that I can
find for that matter.
Fix: Provide a page number reference (after adding the damage control rules
if they have been inadvertently left out).
Alternate fix: Delete the reference to non-existent rules.
								---- GG

NIT: pp.322 and pp.326: Fuel hits
The rules provide a die roll for determining how many tons of fuel are lost
as a result of battle damage.  Unfortunately, starship fuel is given in
cubic meters, not tons, in the starship descriptions.
Fix: Insert the comment "(one ton is 14 cubic meters)." to each reference
to tons of fuel lost.
								---- BJ

NIT: pp.333, Engineer Demolition Kit
The description states that "Items without a weight, etc. are not available
separately."  Strictly speaking, no item listed is without a "weight,
etc.", however many are listed with negligible weight.
Fix: Delete the sentence restricting availability.  Everything described
has a price listed and can be bought.
								---- GG

NIT: pp.341, Data-Display Recorder Headpiece
In the description of this device, commdots and commdot multiplexers are
mentioned.  Unfortunately, the commdots and their multiplexer do not appear
in the equipment listing at all.
Fix: Replace the last two sentences in the first paragraph of the
description with: "Although useless by itself, the headpiece can be
interfaced with any number of Tech Level 13+ devices."
Alternate Fix: Add the information on commdots and commdot multiplexers to
the communications section of the equipment lists.
								---- MU

NIT: pp.345: Locator, Inertial; and pp.346: Navigator, Inertial
The same problem as in the MegaTraveller Imperial Encyclopedia.  The
Inertial Locator is a heavier, more expensive, TL-9 version of the cheap
lightweight, TL-8 Inertial Navigator.  The Inertial Locator also features
slightly less utility and a more cryptic description.
Fix: Remove the entry for "Locator, Inertial" on pp.345
								---- BJ

NIT: pp.357, 4cm RAM Shoot-Through Grenade
There is no listing for 4cm RAM grenades for use with weapons that have an
integral grenade launcher.
Fix: Presumably the convention 4cm RAM grenades have the same
characteristics as 4cm RAM shoot-through grenades.  A comment to this
effect should be included.
								---- MG, GG

NIT: pp.359, Armor
Reflec armor has disappeared.  With the new lower penetration personal
lasers, most armor will stop lasers.  However, it would be handy to have an
armor specifically designed to stop lasers.
Fix: Add reflec to the table, with an armor value of 0 and a lower price.
								---- MG

Commentary:  I note on pp.298, "Lasers are more efficient at penetrating
armor than they are at delivering damage".  This is certainly true for
vehicle and starship lasers.  However, an examination of the small-arms
lasers indicates that they are very poor at penetrating armor, but very
good at delivering damage to an unarmored target.  Is this really the
intended effect?  Perhaps small-arms lasers should have a penetration value
of 1/4, and about half the damage value listed.
								---- GG

NIT: pp.359, Armor: Combat Environment Suit
The suit listed has no associated helmet.  Such a suit should have a
visored helmet.  A visored helmet does not appear on the chart until TL 10.
Fix: Add an integral helmet to the suit; add H (head) to the coverage
codes.
								---- MG

NIT: pp.347, Remote Deployable Sensor
The device has a collapsed volume of 26 kiloliters, and a weight of 260
metric tons.  Therefore it has a density of 10 g/cc; slightly less than
that of solid lead.  Aluminum (density 2.6) or titanium (density 4.5) might
be more representative of the materials the device is made out of. 
Fix: The weight of the Remote Deployable Sensor should be about 100 tons.

Commentary: When estimating the weights and volumes of various items, a
couple of comparisons like those on the following table frequently comes in
handy.  From Thomas Glover\'s "Pocket Ref" (Abbeon Cal, 123-33T Gray Ave,
Santa Barbra, CA).  The table shows the mass (in kilograms) of one cubic
meter of each substance:

Ground Cork		   160.2
Wood (chestnut)		   480.6
Soy Beans		   720.8
Pure Water		 1,000.0
Crushed Stone		 1,601.8
Aluminum		 2,643.1
Basalt (rock)		 3,011.5
Hematite (iron ore)	 3,219.7
Titanium		 4,540.0

								---- GG

NIT: pp.356, Plasma Bazooka
The explanatory note mentions both a solid rocket motor and using part of
the plasma jet for recoil compensation.  Shouldn\'t it be one or the other,
and not both?
Fix: The next to the last sentence should read: "The bazooka has
considerable back blast, as the rocket exhaust is vented to the rear.  The
rocket ignition is synchronized to the firing of the plasma jet, to reduce
recoil to a manageable level."
								---- GG

TYPO: pp.38, last paragraph of Stellar Regions (middle of right column)
The earlier text, and the Stellar Regions DMs table, indicate a maximum
wear value (and therefore a maximum total value modifier) of 8.  This
paragraph states a value of 10.
Fix: Alter the first and last sentences of the paragraph; replace "10" with
"8" in both instances.
								---- GG

TYPO: pp.65, Lancer: Other Assets.
Technician is a cluster skill, and should be boldface.
								---- GG

TYPO: pp.112, Skill Descriptions; first paragraph
The specific meaning of "-" is detailed only for Tech Level requirements. 
The "-" code is also used for Law Level, where it has a slightly different
meaning.
Fix: Add a sentence explaining that the notation "-" next to a homeworld
description indicates the maximum allowable standard for the skill.  The
specific instructions for Tech Level are an exception to this.
								---- GG

TYPO: pp.174, Government
The last sentence of the second paragraph seems to imply that Count
Nolanar, or his daughters, have discovered the secret of time travel.
Fix: The sentence should read: "The transition of government will not be
complete until the end of 1200."
								---- GG  

TYPO: pp.183, Hydrosphere; last paragraph
The last two sentences are missing a "%" sign after the numbers.
Fix: The end of the paragraph should read: "A desert world may have up to
4% free-standing water and still be considered a desert world.  Conversely,
a water world may have a 95% hydrosphere and still be considered a water
world."
								---- GG

TYPO: pp.189, World Law Level
The entry for law level 6, reads: "Moderate (all firearms except firearms
prohibited)".

								---- MG

TYPO: pp.192, Step 5: Decimal Classification
The instruction "Roll 1D10 and treat a roll of 0 as ) (instead of 10)."
contains a typographical error.
Fix: Replace the ")" with "0".
								---- GS
TYPO: pp.195, Step 41: Subordinate Government table
The entry "Self-Perpetuating Democracy" is not a reasonable Traveller
government type.
Fix: The entry should read: "Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy".

TYPO: pp.197: Non-Terrestrial Environments
The penultimate sentence of the first paragraph in this section states that
"The effects of gravity have already been discussed in the context of
combat in the Combat chapter."  Unfortunately for the first-time reader,
the combat chapter has not yet been presented at this point.
Fix: Alter the sentence to read: "The effects of gravity in the context of
combat are discussed in the Combat chapter, beginning on pp.307."

Alternate Fix: Define what a "SWATH ship" is.
								---- GG

TYPO: pp.301, Instruments
While I suppose an aircraft or grav vehicle might carry a wind speed
indicator (which would logically enough, measure the speed of the wind in
relation to the ground), a more common device would be an airspeed
indicator (which measures the vehicle\'s speed through the air).
Fix: replace "wind speed indicator" with "airspeed indicator".
								---- GG

TYPO: pp.302, Vehicle Collision Examples
The example states that (95 x 2) / 10 is 35.  It is not; 19 is correct, and
is used throughout the rest of the example.
Fix: The correct answer is 19.

The definition of a range band is given incorrectly.
Fix: The parenthetical comment should be: "(tenths of a light-second)".
								---- GG

TYPO: pp.351, Slug Rifles and Carbines
There are no 13mm rifles listed in the table.

exclusively for hunting and sport."
								---- GG

TYPO: pp.360, Vehicle Data
Near the bottom of the right-hand column, the explanation reads "H: Hull

Traveller: The New Era ---- QUESTIONS

Compiled by Guy Garnett.  Contributions from Bertil Jonell (BJ), John
Driver (JD), Mark Gelinas (MG), Guy Garnett (GG), and the Traveller Mailing
List.

These questions have come up in the course of playing T:TNE, and were
reported to me along with the errata.  They aren\'t really errors, but just
interesting observations and random rules questions.


Q: Is it balanced that starships take several critical hits from
various weapons (primarily anti-tank weapons) that *might* (or might not)
destroy a much smaller TL-8 tank?  Or should the Critical Damage Table
(T:TNE, pp.326) only be used for weapons that are specifically
anti-spaceship weapons?
								---- BJ

Q: When firing anti-vehicle weapons at starships, the rules (T:TNE pp.295)
specifically states spacecraft should use the ground vehicle hit tables and
the ground vehicle penetration rules.  Shouldn\'t spacecraft use their own
hit tables and rules, instead of the ground vehicle ones?
								---- GG

Q: When generating companion star type and size, the previous roll for
primary star size is a +DM.  This will easily lead to values that are above
12, while results of less than 4 are impossible.  The rules don\'t indicate
what to do with values that go off the top of the chart.  Should they be
re-rolled, or should values be limited to 12? [Classic Traveller Book 6,
Scouts, has this same problem].
								---- JD

Q: When generating a star system, what do you do when there are more
objects to place than available orbits?
								---- JD

Q: What about when all the habitable zones are empty orbits?
								---- JD

Q: Missiles are now riotously expensive.  How about some standard HE
missiles in the starship combat game and the technical architecture
supplement?							---- MG

Commentary: We have looked into this problem.  You don\'t want to use HE
missiles in space combat; explosives just aren\'t effective at the speeds
and ranges involved.  However, we have come up with a number of other
alternatives, which will be posted to TML and sent to GDW.
								---- BJ, GG

Q: Nearly all of the vehicles listed in T:TNE, in particular the Tracked
ATV, Wheeled ATV, Air/Rafts, G-Carrier, Speeder, and Grav Bike) have
oxygen-breathing power plants of the gas turbine, MHD turbine, and fuel
cell types.  No oxygen supply is listed in the vehicle specifications, nor
are any intake compressors.  Therefore, none of these vehicles can be used
in Vacuum, Trace, Very Thin, Exotic, Corrosive, or Insidious atmospheres,
or in space.  The only listed vehicles which are operable in these
atmospheres is the Grav Tank, and the starships and spacecraft.  
Correct?
								---- GG

Q: Energy Weapons skill is listed twice, once under Strength and once
under Agility, on the skill list.  Shouldn\'t it be listed only under
Agility?

A: No.  STR is the controlling attribute for energy weapons skill when
using Plasma and Fusion weapons.  AGL is the controlling attribute when
using lasers.
								---- MG, GG

Q: The starship and spacecraft listings don\'t seem to have an entry for
total fuel capacity.  How do you tell how much fuel to purchase if you\'re
not gas-giant skimming.

A: Under the "Notes" section in the listing, the total fuel volume is
listed in kiloliters.  Divide this number by 14 to get displacement tons
of fuel.

  If you factor in the starport type too, presumably most often X in the wilds,
there won\'t be *any* encounters there. Instead there will be 52% to encounter
a ship in the wilds in a system with an E port and your figures are correct
for C and D ports.

  More interesting perhaps is that an encounter with a vampire will occur in
on average every 4th E-Wild system and every second C/D-Wild system.
  In two of three A-Pocket systems, a vampire will be encountered, as in
every second B-Pocket system, 43% of the C/D-Pocket systems, every third
E-Pocket system and every fourth X-Pocket system.
  Most of those vampires will be big ugly cruisers and escorts.

  I think it is the definition of Industrial that is broken. The Traveller
Book and Merchant Prince gives the Atmosphere requirements as 2-,4,7,9 but in
MegaT and TTNE it is given as 2-4,7,9.

  I suspect the missing \',\' is a typo in MegaTraveller that has been
inadvertently carried over to TTNE.

  Comment: Many worlds in old Traveller, *and* in MegaTraveller, were 
Industrial with atmosphere 0, 1 and 2. The most famous example is probably
Glisten.

  I\'m redoing all the weapons (and more:) with 3G^3(*) and ran into this 
problem too.

  Reality check: Single action revolvers has to be manually recocked between
each shot. This can *usually* be done with the thumb of the firing hand but
it makes it noticable slower than a double action.
  Double action revolvers turn the cylinder and cock the hammer when you pull
the trigger. This makes the trigger pull much harder than for a semiauto and
this will affect accuracy when firing fast.

  My rules: (Not a suggestion really, since they are rather complex) 
  SAR fires a maximum of 2 rounds per phase.
  DAR has a maximum of 5, *but* for each beyond the second, add 1 to the 
recoil mod. 
  Example: 4 rounds are fired from a DAR with a recoil mod of 2: The total
recoil is 2+2+3+4, aka 11. If it had been 5 rounds the recoil would have
been 2+2+3+4+5 aka 16.

  (*) "Again?" they groan:)

  Correction: it is not a NAS, and probably a sniffer. In my defence I must 
point out that I did the review after some hours of reading it, and I didn\'t
find the old equipment pictures until a few days ago.

I\'ve been reading over the penatration rules for plama/fusion weapons (pg 297)
and am a wee bit confused.  It goes over how the penatration values are to 
be used against vehicles.  It also says to use the constant damage values
against personnel.
  So what I\'m seeing is that a TL 9 fusion rifle will cut through a suit
of TL F battle dress like a blowtorch through butter and deliver 9d6 to
the wearer.  If I\'m wrong about this, please correct me.  An explanation 
and a page number of the correct rules would be nice.
  I don\'t know if this made DW\'s errata list, but last night I noticed some
errors describing the plasma/fusion weapons.  It\'s the TL F fusion gun that
has the grav module to counteract the recoil (i.e. no Battle Dress required),
not the TL E fusion gun.  I\'ll post the other one when I get home and have
my book in front of me.

THat\'s the way I read the rules, too.  Any other interpretations make
even less sense.

Speaking of things in T:TNE that just don\'t make sense, here are a
couple:  A TL-9 Laser Rifle does 10d6 of damage to an unarmored target,
but bounces totally (no damage whatsoever) off of ballistic cloth, or
any other type of armor.  A TL-13 laser rifle will actually get good
damage through Cloth or TL-10 combat armor, but is completely stymied by
TL-10 battle dress (or better).

If you want to poke holes in battle dress, you best (non high
energy weapon) choices are: a TL-7 9mm rifle (1d6 through TL-10 battle
dress) or a LAG (2d6).

A TL-13 Gauss Pistol is ineffective against TL-8 Ballistic Weave (or
Cloth, or a TL-5 Flak Jacket for that matter); however, a TL-5 9mm
magnum revolver isn\'t (gets 1d6 through any of those).

Grumble.  I *still* prefer the Striker/Azhanti High Lightning/Snapshot.

That section is *very* unclear as to what rules apply to which weapons.
I presume (based on Classic Traveller and MegaTraveller definitions)
that the TL-12 and TL-13 "Plasma Rifles" correspond to PGMP-12 and
PGMP-13, respectively (require Battle Dress).  THe TL-14 Plasma Rifle
presumable corresponds to PGMP-14 and requires no battle dress.  The
"Light Fusion Rifle" probably is an FGMP-14, and requires battle dress,
while the TL-15 "Fusion Rifle" does not. 

In any case, you\'re right: that section is very confusing, and should
probably be in the errata.

Excuse me if I make a fool of myself ( not the first time :-) ) but 

it seems to me that the super-heated form of matter is what is called 

a plasma state?? Oh GOOD we have just changed a Fusion gun for a    
Plasma weapon... I hope I haven\'t opened that can of worms again...

I find that I agree. The more I think about it I think that the    
Thruster technology will remain in My game but in the wilds and in the 

unexplored parts of the Galaxy you may find more fusion or Plasma (    
see above ) drives. I think that such a dangerous device might be    
considerably regulated and many tests of ship captains and pilots    
would be required.

Interesting idea, I was thinking of the pen. of an Elephant you\'re not    
going to penetrate an elephant very well with Mr. 9mm auto pistol

sorry, just not likely the 600 Nitro express was designed to get it\'s

attention and knock it down with sheer impact. In fact there is a law    
in big game hunting countries ( if there are any left :-)) that you    
cannot hunt the big stuff with any rifle smaller than .40 calibre.

too many hunters with their .270\'s got killed because there was not    
knock down with it. Just another bit of trivia from -- jim --

More on coffee one of my players bought 20 coffee trees when she    
encountered a planet that had them in Gushemege. She nursed them    
back to Spinward and got in touch with an agricultural collective that    
she knew to plant and harvest them. So by about 1122 "Regina dark" is    
a popular coffee. and she is now moderately rich although she doesn\'t    
seem to realize that. She still refuses to go to a store for clothes    
if she can make them herself!

Some players like to do some investment and trading if it is a side    
line they have a chance to make a profit and this adds interest to the    
character as well as giving me another hook... ( he he he ... ;-) )

Most of the group have a very small ability with combat therefor they    
tend to avoid it as much as possible. They are more in the lets sneak    
in and aquire it than the slam open the door guns blazing types.

and everyone is very into the characterization and developing the    
personality of their character. Some time I\'ll have to tell the story    
of Dr. Trank and how he came about his name...


Well I guess I should shutup now I\'m trying to keep the posts short

:-) honest, really I am... honest... :-)

1-2-10.  That for Fusion guns is 1/2-1-4.
 
 The Industrial atmosphere range 2-4 is indeed a typo, as noted.
It should be 2-,4,7,9.
 
 The Laser Rifle-9 has a penetration of nil/3-nil (for the two
modes of fire), and the Laser Rifle-13 has a penetration of 3
(it does _not_ fall with distance).
 
 The currently available errata is described as "interim", so
I hesitate to post it all just yet, especially considering the
huge errata/opinion files posted earlier this week.  Starship
Errata will be published in Brilliant Lances.  The printing
location of the rest of it has not (so far as I know) been
decided.  Loren will probably let the TML know when he gets
back from summer Convention season.

at least started in orbit (range zero) and three of them were finished in
orbit (range zero).
  The usual chain of events is that one side bushwack the second near a natural
gathering-point. One case was over a mainworld (start at 0 end at 0), one 
was close to a moon with a former naval base (start at 0 end at 1 with that
the players jump away), one occation was a sneak attack by a missile-carrying
mine, that used a far prox nuke at them 20 diameters from a gas giant. The
remaining two were really one long combat with a break in the middle over a 
moon with a military base.
 
  Observations:

  The evasion skill is probably too hard, and IMHO it should be possible to
use pilot (interface/grav) for it (perhaps enabled by ship tactics).

  Scout ships are *very* damage resistant (except for their antennas:) because
many low-power hits are absorbed by the antennas, and those that doesn\'t hit 
the antennas tend to hit the hold.

  The hold hits can incapacitate when the fuel runs out, so it *is* fruitful
to attack ships to sieze them, and it *is* likely that a combat will end in
a boarding action.

  [The most likely outcome is IMHO that the side that feels inferior jumps if it
is capable. If it is incapable, it is possible that the battle ends when one
side hits bingo fuel. This could possibly leave one ship cartweeling off into
nothing and the other limping home at 0.5G-Hour. Otherwise boarding will occur
now. The least likely outcome is an explosion, but since the fuel explosions
are unlikely to destroy the ship totally, boarding will commence here too.
  A fight with nukes on the other hand, can lead to the total destruction of
one or both sides.]
 
  All KE weapons are of limited usefulnes at short ranges due to their 
low final speed.

I\'m the one who posted a list of minor races to the TML.  Believe it or
not, that was *three* years ago now.  Gads, where does the time go?

There was some debate at the time about the content of the list, especially
about the fact that I included the races from the Paranoia Press supplements.
These sources were revealed to be no longer canonical.

Since then, I\'m afraid I haven\'t done any work at all in keeping up the list, 
so I\'m not sure how much use it would be now.  If anyone really wants a copy 
then let me know -- I think I\'ve still got it stored away on a floppy disk 
somewhere.  But I\'m hoping that somebody else may have a more up-to-date 
version.  Anyone?

THE NEW ALIEN LIST (revised 4 July 1993)

Recompilation, reformatting, and extensions based on a list posted by Wilson 
Liaw to the TML and corrected by Alan Huscroft in June 1990.  This list 
DOES NOT contain all entries from that list, but adds quite a few.  The 
original list is archived and available for ftp in the file "bun108" at 
"sunbane.enrgr.uwo.ca", and includes sources for some of the information in 
abbreviated form.

Aliens in this list are:

   * Listed by name and "Planet/Subsector (Sector Hex)".  Unknown notations
     mean information unknown in the context of the game -- uncertain
     notations simply mean _I_ don\'t know.
   * Divided into the traditional "Major" and "Minor, and also "Uplifted"
   * Not categorized by information source.  Besides cluttering the list
     and taking too long to compile, many originate from a one or two line
     reference in a sidebar or caption.
   * "Canonical" materials, unless otherwise noted, are those published
     by GDW, DGP, or FASA.  
 
This list is known to be incomplete.  Only aliens that I could check
information on are here.  Additions are welcome -- do whatever you want
to this thing.

NOTES:

* Humans are listed on both the major and minor race lists due to the
multitude of "native" human worlds caused by the Ancient seeding project
ca. -300,000 imperial.  According to the books, there are 3 known major
human races, and 46 known living minor human races.  Currently, I have the
names and/or locations of some 14 living minor races, counting the Floriani 
twice, and not including the Loeskalth, who are believed extinct or 
assimilated by the Vilani but who survive (_Fate of the Sky Raiders_; FASA).  
   Some Azhanti High Lightning cruisers seem to incorporate names of Ancient-
displaced human races.  Some possible unverified names for human minor races
extrapolated from AHL cruiser names:  Azhanti, Sylean, Fiorin, Acheron,  
Ilurian, Luriani.
   This situation is further complicated by Solomani and Imperial genetic 
experiments which have resulted in additional races.

** The Aslan are listed on both the major and minor race lists due to the
recent discovery that they developed hyperdrive from Solomani artifacts, 
namely the starship TRS _Pathfinder_.  Despite this, they have been included
as a major race for some 3000 years, and are one of the most vital aliens in
Known Space, thus justifying their continued listing as a major race.  No
flames about "major/minor" race designation racism please!

*** The Chips are listed on both the minor and uplifted race lists due to
their accidental and unpredictable evolution of intelligence in response to 
their exposure to advanced silicon materials and circuits in a crashed 
Terran vessel during the 7th Interstellar War.  They may currently be 
considered either (1) extinct after the nuclear bombardment of their 
homeworld in 1127 (assuming none were off-world) or (2) still extant as
the Virus.

**** The Eslyat and the Murians were originally from Paranoia Press\'s _The 
Beyond_ and _Vanguard Reaches_ sector products, and therefore are no longer 
strictly "canonical" Traveller aliens.  However, DGP\'s _Solomani & Aslan_
still shows governmental units labeled with their names in that area, albeit
differently placed than in the PP products.  So the question is open....

# Miniphants might not quite qualify as sentient.  The issue of JTAS they 
appeared in (#16) stated that they had an intelligence of 2-4, and they do
seem to fit the group above, so they got put there.

       Saturday, July 17th 1993; 6:00pm Local Time

Where: Terra (Sol Gamma) Solomani Rim 1827
       Rockville, Maryland


Please RSVP me (by e-mail, USnail, or phone) for detailed directions and
any special information you might need. 


Bring your favorite party food or drink!  While I will have basic party
supplies, I suggest that you eat dinner first (or a bunch of us can
always do the Famous Role-Playing Standby: order out for pizza).

  Gas giant orienteering:

  You take a space suit, a personal thruster pack, a grav belt, lots of bottles
of LOX, and a hand computer (containing the map and some orbital mechanics
programs), and hold a orienteering contest where the different stations are
on different moons around a gas giant.
  A personal reentry kit can be advisable too, and a emergency beacon.
  I imagine that the difficulties would be in two areas, firstly to navigate 
between the moons using a hand computer but otherwise on fully manual: In
orbital mechanics you don\'t go forward if you thrust forward, instead you
go upward and slow your movement relative those in lower orbits:)
  Secondly to find the stations on the moons, the gravbelt won\'t have enough
fuel to enable you to go looking for it, so you have to be right on in the
first descent.

  Asteroid belt orienteering is another option if the radiation levels around 
gas giants are too high.

Okay, somebody more in the know than I needs to explain this to me:

An MHD Turbine, used in most of the Grav vehicles for power AND thrust,
seems to me to be the following device:  a torus of water, accelerated by
a magnetic field, which is then pushed through a turbine to generate
electricity.

This is dumb.  It means we have electricity to begin with, but we want to
push it through this other device before we use it...Also, we don\'t get
any thrust from this, as far as I can see....

Option 2:  We\'re burning Hydrogen as a reactant and using the heat/whatever
to power a turbine, which pushes the water from which electricity is
extracted with an MHD setup.

This is also dumb.  Why not just pull the power off the turbine directly?
Plus, the Hydrogen needs a reactant which we also need to lug along, or it
won\'t work in anything but atmospheres with a reactant in suitable quantities.

Option 3:  The Hydrogen Exhaust (Water, if we\'re using Oxygen as our
reactant) is accelerated (?) by an MHD (or has power pulled off it, which
means it\'s *deccelerated*) and then pushed through a turbine.

This is also stupid.  Why use both for generating electricity?  At TL 8,
the turbine is more effecient than the MHD, although we could probably
fudge this with "hi-tech" superconductors, or whatever :)

Option 4:  We\'ve got a turbine precompressing the atmosphere before pushing
it through the MHD (a la modern turbo-jets) <assuming that we\'re using the
atmosphere as the reactant...if not, no precompressing is necessary>.

This is dumb, \'cause it won\'t fly in a vacuum.  And really, what\'s the use
of a grav vehicle that can\'t be used in a vacuum (or any non-compatible 
atmosphere, really).

So, basically, I can see no rationale for something called an MHD turbine
as either a good powerplant or a source of thrust.  Am I wrong?

> Okay, somebody more in the know than I needs to explain this to me:

  I don\'t know exactly but I suspect that it works this way:

  The MHD turbine is a setup that extracts electrical energy directly out of
(hot) gas rushing through it, thereby reducing its speed (and lowering the 
temperature possibly).
  The total efficiency of it is higher than for a gas turbine, but the
gas will not have speed zero when it exits so this is where the thrust
comes from.

  If it is anything like a better version of a gas turbine it can drink 
almost anything, from hydrogen to alcohol to gasoline to lamp oil to 
coal dust in water slurry and so on.

> This is dumb, \'cause it won\'t fly in a vacuum.

  Correct, it will only fly in atmospheres 4-9, (2-9 with an intake compressor
like the one on the GUESS air/raft) and there might be trouble with certain
taints too.

  The only thing except fusion, solar power and batteries that will be usable
in vacuum is fuel cells, and they need nine times the listed (MegaT) fuel
to account for oxygen as well as hydrogen.

> And really, what\'s the use

  There is the problem of thrust nowadays. Grav won\'t give thrust, and various
fan arrangements (that are much better than reaction mass propulsion in
atmospheres) are unusable in vacuum. Reaction mass on the other hand increases
the fuel consumption pretty badly but allows higher speeds.

  The best thing for vacuum is a small craft with G-Hours etc.

of my own)

     A number of players have expressed concern that there
 are now two parallel sets of government type codes, one for
 the Wilds, and one for use elsewhere, as this will cause
 confusion when reading UWPs. Players should think of the
 government digit not as a firm definition in the same man-
 ner as a size or hydrographics code. Rather, it is a
 descriptive tool to help create an effective roleplaying
 atmosphere. Unlike all other digits of the UWP which are
 quantifiable, government type is highly descriptive in na-
 ture and is often a judgement call. For example, is a board
 of directors a Participating Democracy, a
 Company/Corporation, or a Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy?
      Future Traveller: The New Era products will expand and
 further detail world governmental descriptions. The basic
 book was not able to contain such a system for reasons of
 space, and because the game had to allow players to gener-
 ate pre-Collapse Imperial worlds, the classic Traveller
 method of government generation was retained as an interim
 system. In providing the Wilds government types, we aimed
 to increase the diversity of world types that can be
 visited, and further fuel players\' imaginations. Like real
 governments, UWP government digits can change unpredict-
 ably, and exist to help referees create interesting cam-
 paigns, rather than existing as ends in themselves.

   Upon further testing, we have decided that the following
  wound effects provide more entertaining and dynamic play,
  and suggest that all players use these instead.
   Serious Wounds: the roll to avoid losing conciousness every
  turn in which the character attempts an activity becomes a
  Difficult roll against Constitution. Characters who have
  lost conciousness make a Formidable roll against their Con-
  stitution each turn to attempt to regain conciousness.
   Critical Wounds: The roll to regain conciousness is made
  each combat turn, and is a D100 (percentile) roll against
  the Constitution attribute.
  Page 289
   Add the following new rule for the use of the personal
  medical kit, immediately before the "Stabilizing Critical
  Wounds" section.
   Use of a personal medical kit (page 334) allows a character
  with neither Medical skill nor a doctor\'s medical kit to
  avoid the unskilled penalty when attempting a first aid task
  (thus it is a Formidable task using the character\'s EDU
  attribute). One such use uses up the medical kit.
  Page 292
   Under Powerboats, the reference to "size one" should read
  "Micro or SubMicro."
  Page 301
   Fire: The task to extinguish a fire should be Difficult
  versus CON, not Formidable.
  Page 302
   In the example of the collision between the car and truck,
  the following corrections should be made: "the car is hit
  with a value of (95x2)M-v10, or 19," "which means that (19@1=)
  18 is referenced," and "As a result, (9@1=) 8 points are
  takento the Vehicle Damage Results Table." In the tandem
  bicycle example, the check versus Agility should be Average,
  not Difficult.

   In the second-to-last paragraph, delete the reference to
  the limit on maximum simultaneous sensor locks.

   Communication Equipment
   The in-text range of 500 km for both the Communicator,
  Laser, and Communicator, Video, should be changed to 300 km,

   Small Arms
   Several people have if the recoil figures for the 4mm Gauss
  Pistol-13 are in error. They are not. Because Traveller: The
  New Era uses a more realistic system (developed for
  Twilight: 2000) for rating firearms based on weapon weight,
  round weight, and muzzle velocity, than Traveller did,
  weapons that were created for Traveller do not always work
  well when using their original Traveller specifications. The
  gauss pistol listed here is such an example of a weapon
  rated into Traveller: The New Era using its original
  Traveller specifications. The recoil is high because it is
  specified as being such a light weapon for its high muzzle
  velocity. We have theorized that this is a light, easily
  concealable, hold-out weapon that is hard to control.
  Another gauss pistol design, intended to be more control-
  lable in combat, is as follows.

   The numbers listed under "Pen" are the weapons\' Penetration
  Values for use against vehicles, see page 297. The penetra-
  tion ratings for use against personnel according to the

  are 1-2-10 for all plasma guns and 1/2-1-4 for all fusion
  guns.

  15 is 70.
  Pages 360-365
       Vehicle Data
       Many of the vehicles have no listed configuration or an
  incomplete configuration. In addition, Travel Moves  and
  grav vehicle Combat Moves need to be corrected. Their cor-
  rect configurations and Moves are as follows. The notation
  Unarmored refers to the Unarmored Vehicles rule on page 301,
  and the references to turrets refer to the Hit Location rule
  on page 297. Any Travel or Combat moves that are not listed
  do not need correction.
       Note that travel moves for ground vehicles assume that
  the vehicle is moving at a rate of 1.5 times its safe speed
  for a period of four hours. This means that a ground vehicle
  could go farther than this during a four-hour period. The
  absolute upper limit is twice the listed travel move, which
  translates to the vehicle\'s driver making constant For-
  midable driving rolls for a period of four hours.
       Travel moves for aircraft and grav vehicles are in the
  format high flight speed/NOE speed. For NOE speed, the
  Travel Move is 1.5 times the safe speed for four hours, just
  as for ground vehicles. Because high flight speed is an ab-
  solute speed at high altitude, the high flight Travel Move
  is four hours at this speed, with no need for
  driving/piloting checks (except in the case of bad weather,
  etc., at the referee\'s discretion).
