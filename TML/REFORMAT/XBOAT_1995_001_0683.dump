I will skip the detailed description of the house rules used and the
battle outline, listing only the lessons learned so far (some we already
knew about...)

1- artillery is very effective and counter-battery fire is deadly.
2- the most effective vehicles (FIST and HKV anti-tank) are equipped
   with starship weapons rather than vehicle weapons.
3- in the engagements FIST and HKV were used much too close to the
   enemy forces and were therefore very vulnerable to counterbattery.
4- MBGT are of very little effectiveness and they were not involved
   in any engagement (except as targets..).
5- CGT have some effectiveness. A faster version of CGT able to operate
   with the IFV would be much more useful.
6- sensor performance is crucial, the detailed sensor rules may totally
   change the outcome of an engagement. It would be interesting to explore 
   the possibility of requiring a forward observer also to direct long 
   range direct fire.
7- infantry should leave the IFVs before engaging (or being engaged by)
   the opponent.
8- air-defence units are useless in fighting other vehicles.

OK, not that I doubt you, but where is this written?

I had always assumed that interstellar-only jumps made sense because
1) it\'s like a big cannon - shooting yourself a few parsecs is actually
   a lot easier than hitting something only a few million km away
2) it would be tricky to jump insystem due to all those damn gravity
   wells moving around all over the place.

But of course, canon rules.

Tactics pools might work for two groups of veteran commandoes. However
in most traveller games I am dealing with there is a  mixed group
of scouts, merchants , and some muscle. They do not have a decided
way of fighting together.

Lack of trust is not the issue. The issue is that on a roleplaying
level these individuals should not know how to fight together as a
unit until they have been together. Individuals may see another
approach than what is occurring.

What about in cases of surprise?

What about in situations where the unforseen or unpredicted occur?

In the situation you describe, I would rule that for initiative:

Marine : Tactics + Dex/5
Gymnast: Tactics + Dex/5

In a pure shot for shot round the Marine would shoot first and probably nail
the gymnast. However even if the gymnast went first, he/she/it probably
would not hit which means the Marine would nail him/her/it anyway.

The difference between what I am saying here and what Traveller is saying is
lets say Marines A, B, and C are shooting at the gymnast then
each marines initiative would be

Tactics of A + Tactics of B + Tactics of C + Dex/5. This should not be
the case for several reasons:

1. Each marine is taking an individual action.

2. Even if they are acting in unison, the other marines can not make the
first one any faster.

I don\'t have my references here at work, but I believe it\'s in one of the
essays in the original Library Data supplements.  The reference is about
the Terran development of the jump drive - that initial jumps were 
accross the solar system, from the jump drive research station in the
asteroid belt.

The justification is that a well-coordinated group of individuals is more
than the sum of its parts.

Some house rules I used:

The maximum number of Tactics Pool points that can be \'spent\' at a time is
the level of Leadership skill possessed by the groups leader.  (This reflects
the advantages of Leadership for player characters, who practically never
fail morale checks and run away).  

The group must be in communication for the points to be shared.

A player can withhold their Tactics points, but then they get no benefit from
belonging to the group (no warnings or communication allowed).  Deciding that
each player can use their points themselves is something else.  In the event
of arguments, the group\'s leader decides (but the players may mutiny...).

  I remember reading about the initial jumps, I just don\'t remember 
where.  There is an article by Marc W. Miller in JTAS #24 on Jumpspace. 
Here is what it says about microjumps.

    "Any jump of less than one parsec is considered to be a microjump.  
Sometimes, it can be advantageous to jump within a system rather than 
use maneuver drives.  If normal acceleration and deceleraton would take 
more than a week, a microjump is more efficient.  At 1G, any distance 
greater than one billion km would be more efficient using a microjump.
    Microjumps can also confuse an observer or enemy.  Because a ship\'s 
destination cannot be predicted, a microjump within a system still 
leaves an impression that the ship has left; a week later, it emerges 
from jump in the same system, to the observer\'s confusion."

    I know that there is another mention of microjumps, I just can\'t 
remember where.  Anyway I hope this little bit helps.

I believe that microjumps were first proposed in "From Port to Jump-point",
(I think by Leroy Guatney), in JTAS #23(??). He pointed out that travel
from Regina\'s main star to its binary companion is done by microjump,
because 1 week in jumpspace is quicker than travel through normal space.

>   wells moving around all over the place.

The original article had a suggested "house rule" that the better the
jump drive, the smaller the gravity well target could be. That is, a
jump-1 ship would aim for the largest gravity well in a system (the
main star). A jump-2 ship could target the next biggest well (eg.
Jupiter in the Sol system). A jump-6 ship could target Earth itself
(being a much smaller target). Note that Naval ships - traditionally
with better j-drives - could hit your mainworld with no problems.
(Leroy, can you add anything to this outline??)

Matthew Harelick commented that:

The use of a tactics pool was discussed by DGP; they had the "old
veteran sergeant" instructing a newbie on how to point his gun,
"squeeze the trigger, don\'t pull it", etc. This was the justification
for pooling the skill.

However, they ALWAYS said that the rules were a guideline, and not to
be hampered by them. Some suggestions I can make are:
1. Make the total Tactics pool only equal to their highest individual
   Leader skill (a DGP suggestion).
2. Tell your players that they cannot drw on their Tactics until they
   train together, or somehow (up to you) gain more "experience" of
   working as a group. Gradually increase their Tactics pool as they
   improve. Note that this is also a way to get a bunch of players
   to CO-OPERATE together (very Sesame St).

Are the inhabitants native? In Traveller, lots of lifeless
planets have been settled by humans or other races,
who then lives in sealed environments.

If the life and vegetation is native, though, there are at least
two possibilities: One is to have ordinary carbon-based
life with a resistance to hydrochloric acid (not that unlikely
- just postulate a slime covering like in the human stomach).
The other possibility is to have life based on another
element than carbon. There is a little about it in WBH in the
section about exotic atmospheres. I don\'t exactly
remember, but I think chloride was a possible substitute
for carbon as a building block for life.

Anyway, according to evolution theory, lifeforms would
develop fit to their environment. Thus, appearence
probably would not differ much in either case. Take a look
at the planet and try to determine which sort of life is
present.

Remember that life does not have to be a full fledged
complete eco-systems with animals, plants and
complicated food-chains (sp?). Microbiological life is life
too, and maybe that\'s all there is. In my (Mega)Traveller
universe, this sort of native life is very common on worlds
with hostile environments, if present at all.

>    For all that goes what would the planet look like?  I\'m

It depends on the type of the star. An M-type star, for
example, emits light almost only in the red spectrum.
Therefore such a star would make a sky red regardless
of atmosphere.

A G-star, OTOH, emits white light, which can be broken into
all other colors. The color of the light predominant in the
sky depends on the density of the atmosphere. There\'s
a rule of thumb, but I don\'t remember it right now. I have it written down at
h
ome, so if anyone\'s interested, I\'d try to
remember to look it up.

More specifically about an atmosphere containing
hydrochloric acid. Much of it will probably be in gas form.
As impure hydrochloric acid tends to be slightly green
(actually, it\'s a rather noxious looking color), I would expect
this atmosphere to be maybe a hazy green. An otherwise
blue sky would shift towards green, depending on the
amount of hydrocloric acid.

>    Does anybody have any idea where I can find further

There was an article in Challenge called something like
"getting science into science fiction", but I don\'t remember
the number. If noone else remembers, I can have a look
at it at home.

This is where I\'ve gotten lot of the stuff about star spectres
and sky color.

For an idea about other elements than carbon as building
blocks for life, take a look at a periodic table and pick
common elements with the same valens (sp?) as carbon.
I believe sulphur is a viable alternative too.

Hope this helps.

    This is the home world of a race that is tenatively known as the 
Valtooni.  They as best described as having a peanut shaped body, arms 
and legs with 3 segments, and two eye stalks.  They are about seven 
feet tall and very spindly.  I\'m having trouble with their hands, feet, 
digestive system, and reproductive nature.
    They are an ancient race that live on the fringes of the normal 
Traveller Universe.  They tend to inhabit worlds with atmospheres close 
to their own, or ones with little or now atmosphere.

    I know that it has been theorized in some scientific writings that 
Chlorine can be substituded for Oxygen.  Also some life in the earths 
oceans has something to do with Sulfer (I just can\'t remember what).

    What can I say, my knowledge of evolution is very weak, since I 
view it as science fantasy (yes, I\'m a Christian), however I see your 
point.

    Great, would you believe that I haven\'t even bothered to come up 
with their home system yet!  Just what little I have written down on 
the planet itself.

    Do you happen to remember if it is a recent issue, or an older one? 
I\'ve got the last couple of years, plus a lot of older issues.  
Unfortunatly this doesn\'t sound familiar.  However, it does sound very 
good.

    It does, thanks.

can\'t just replace oxygen with chlorine (the chemical energies are too weak),
but you can have a chloride-oxygen hybrid biochemistry that works well.  This
is a really good article - I strongly suggest you find it (or an equivalent).
 Dozens of story/adventure ideas (including accedental infection of \'normal\'

Gillett notes that you can\'t simply pick similar valences without doing

No, neither Chlorine or Sulphur is a likely candidate (nor do they have the
same 
Valence as Carbon) - you are probably mis-remembering Silicon.

As for resistance to HCl, you don\'t need slime-covering - only earth type, 
non-acid resistant life needs that. If it originated in an ocean of HCl, it
will 
have a native chemistry which *uses* and takes advantage of acids, rather
than 
being vulnerable to them.  In terms of stable chemistry in an acid
environment, 
Silicon is rather unlikely (for all the inertness of Solicone rubber) -- the 
long chain molecules needed for bio-chemistry have weaker bonds if they are 
Si-Si rather than C-C.  I\'d make them carbon-based, but not on Earth style 
proteins, DNA etc; and I\'d give most of them an acid-secretion touch,
assuming 
they take advantage of their chemistry to corrode rocks (if plants) or to 
concentrate acid within themselves as an attack form if animals. (Yes, even
if 
more resistant than we are, they\'d still be vulnerable to concetrated acids -

this *isn\'t* DnD!)
For breathing, they\'d probably use a Cl - HCl cycle, so I\'d expect some free
Cl 
gas, which is pronouncedly green.
There may well be oxygen involved too; an alternative to Cl - HCl would be
HCl - 
HOCl (Hypochlorous acid, a bleaching/oxidising agent) - that also leads to
the 
likelihood of Chlorates and perChlorates as common substances, and they are 
potent oxidisers (sugar + weedkiller -> Bang!)

Acids are also *very* corrosive to rocks, so the landscape will be much more 
eroded than Earth: rounded, with few sharp ridges or peaks and with many
rocks 
pock-maked or cut into bizzare forms along lines of weakness (like the Mesas
in 
some deserts).  There will be no limestone at all on a world with this much 
acid-rain!

After conferring with my girlfriend, who\'s sitting in my

tell you the following:

It\'s an article called "Putting the \'science\' into SFRPGs"
by Charles E. Gannon. It\'s in issue #58 of Challenge,
March \'92, and it\'s on page 72.

     Not to long ago, I posted a message re: meeting women of the former 
soviet union through romance ads.

     In August, Olga will travel to Moscow from her home in Kiev, Ukraine.  
In Moscow, Olga will have a much easier and cost efficient means to place 
your personal romance ad throughout Russia.

Last week I received the following from Olga:

     "I have already sent your ad to the papers in such towns: Moscow, 
St. Petersburg, Vladimir, Kazan.  At nearest future I will send your ad to
the
paper in some more 12 towns of Russia, where papers are published.
     Some times (in winter, spring & now) I placed your ad in other papers, 
but they are not most popular paper in Moscow and some large cities of
Russia.
     Besides, I am continuing to place your ad in papers of Ukraine.  I 
promise to place your ad in some other papers when I will come to Moscow in 
August.  I am glad that you have received fairly many letters from Russian & 
Ukrainian girls and I think you will received some more ones and will find 
your ideal in my country soon.
     I thank you very much ones more for your kindness & your help.
My best wishes,

Olga"

     This isn\'t a scam - call it panhandling if you want. . . I sent her $40 
or $50 and I\'ve received over 45 responses.  Unlike placing romance ads in 
the U.S., women from the former USSR respond.  Although one would guess the 
are doing so in the hopes of American citizenship, I haven\'t found it so.

     Olga lives in Kiev, Ukraine (population 3 million) and will travel to 
Moscow in August to visit her father.  If you were to send a letter this 
week, she would receive it in time.  The population of Moscow is 10 million 
-- (3 times the size of Los Angeles.)

     Feel free to send a letter and ask her your questions.  She will be
happy
to respond.

Olga\'s address:

Kiev 253121

     Although Olga has never seen a newsgroup nor heard of "net-etiquette," 
she believes that offering lonely singles the possibility of romance exceeds 
the cost of angering those who feel the net shouldn\'t be used in this
fashion.

1 drive; since the nearest star is at jump 2, the intrasystem use was
rather natural.

According to Alien Module 7, instead, the Hivers developed a faulty jump 
drive 1 (melting after few uses, less than 10) and only 400 years later
did they discover the regular jump 1 drive. Due to the jump cost I
suspect they did not use their faulty drive for microjumps.

Apparently the Vilani also had problems with the jump drive, which was 
regular but based on a faulty theoretical understanding (thus resulting 
in very slow development of higher than jump-2 drives, Starship Operator\'s
Manual).

I have also a recollection of some race developing a drive that would only
do microjumps, but I haven\'t been able to recover the information. Does 
anybody else remember it?. A microjump-only drive, if smaller and with
smaller fuel requirements could actually be quite handy.

The natural MT guess for such a jump-0 drive would be:
1 jump unit (13.5 kl, 27 tons, 3 Mcr) per 100 tons. The fuel usage
would be the regular 67.5 kl per jump unit. Thus a microjump drive
would be half the size and require half the fuel of a regular jump 1.

As people no doubt know, there has been a major flap going on over
TSR\'s actions regarding net archives of player-created works.  So
far, only three companies have come out with a clear statement of
policy with regard to this issue: TSR, Steve Jackson Games, and
Palladium, with Palladium and SJG taking very nearly diametrically
opposed views, and TSR being closer to the Palladium end of the
spectrum. (Side note: a message was posted here [by me] effectively
asking Loren to get a statement from GDW on their policy.  The last
time I followed up, several months ago, I was told that the lawyers
were still looking into it.)  The majority of the gaming community
seems to prefer that the SJG view prevail, but they apparently
accept that there will ultimately have to be a compromise between
SJG\'s view and the Palladium/TSR view.  Law in this area seems to
be fuzzy at best; it is widely believed that the law will
ultimately take guidance from (but not necessarily totally ratify)
general industry practice.  In an attempt to come to a reasonable
medium and establish it as general industry practice, Jim
Vassilakos, Larry Smith, Joel Hahn, and Guy Robinson have created
the policy appended to this message, and are asking for comments.
They have not gone to the game companies with it, yet; they want to
get a feel for how the customer community feels about it first.

Please send your comments to the list if you don\'t mind them being
public; I\'ll be happy to forward them.  If you want to comment
privately, you can send them to me and I\'ll forward them, or you
can send them directly to one of them, at the addresses below.  Jim

before we take the big-plunge, we want to get some feedback from
you guys, the gamers on the net. Are you folks willing to abide
by this agreement if we somehow manage to get the companies to
accept it?

Please read it through and let me know what you think either via
email or here on the net. Thanks...  jimv@cs.ucr.edu

Convention on the Toleration of Compatible Products
Both Commercially and Non-Commercially Produced
Version 0.7  (17-July-1995)
----

     Legal Note: AD&D(r), Forgotten Realms(r), and World
     of Greyhawk(r), are all registered trademarks of TSR,
     Inc. Traveller(r) is a registered trademark of GDW.
     These trademarks are used here without permission.
     This use is not intended as a claim of ownership over
     the trademarks being used.

     Another Legal Note: The authors of this document are
     not lawyers. No part of this document should be
     construed as legal advice. We are fans who want to
     provide one possible alternative to the copyright
     policy TSR is using to tread on the legal rights of
     roleplaying enthusiasts. At the same time we want to
     protect the legal rights of friendly RPG publishers.
     A detailed industry-wide policy may be useful to
     all parties concerned. If you are an RPG publisher
     or an RPG consumer, please read this and let us
     know what you think.

We, the undersigned, agree in principle that roleplaying games
represent a unique category of creative expression and, hence,
are worthy of their own set of rules with respect to copyright
violation and fair use.

A roleplaying game is part game system and part novelization. It
is a hybrid of two very distinct categories of expression. Hence,
the rules governing the fair use of elements of published RPGs
ought to be a hybrid of the rules used for standard board games
and for novels.

We hereby adopt the following standards until such time as the
courts and/or laws of our respective nations provide otherwise:


I. Definitions

A. Terms

   Roleplaying games tend to be couched in a distinctive
terminology that in some ways betrays the hobby\'s roots in war
gaming. These terms are used to codify the affairs of a
roleplaying game into something about which rules may be written.
As a consequence it is hard for a roleplayer to talk about a
given game without resorting to those game terms.
   For our purposes, a "term" is any RPG element which represents
an attribute of a given character, place, or prop and which has
some value or set of values associated with it which can vary.
For example, in 1st edition AD&D (which we will refer to often
since it was the earliest successful RPG) "hitpoints" is a term
which refers to a character\'s ability to avoid and absorb
"damage".
   Some common terms in AD&Dv1: strength, intelligence, wisdom,
dexterity, constitution, comeliness, class, level, hitpoints,
armor class, thaco, damage/attack, alignment, treasure type,
move, experience points, saving throws, etc.

B. Rules

   The rules of a game give a structure to what might otherwise
be considered just a group story or a collaborative discussion.
They provide a system by which to determine results. Hence, for
our purposes, a "rule" is any systematic method used in an RPG to
determine an outcome which is not specifically associated with a
prop (see below). For example, it is a "rule" in AD&Dv1 that if a
character falls 10 feet, he sustains d6 damage. By way of
contrast, it is not a "rule" that a character "hit" by a giant
chicken sustains d4 damage, as that determination is the result
of a prop attribute (see below), not a rule.

C. Props

   Everyone knows that nouns refer to people, places, and things.
Well, props are the "things" of roleplaying games. To be more
precise, they are modular elements of RPGs which characters can
belong to, have, or interact with during the course of an
adventure. Note that while props may refer to a category of
character (either racial or professional), they do not refer
individual characters. In short, characters are not props, nor
are places props. So what, then, specifically counts as a prop?
   Props in 1st edition AD&D include (but are not necessarily
limited to) monsters, character races, specific magical spells
and psionic abilities, skills and proficiencies, character
classes and sub-classes, weapons, armor, magical items, and other
miscellaneous equipment.

   Prop Attributes: The "attributes" of a prop include any terms
and their associated values with respect to the general case of
the prop in question. For example, the attributes of the "Giant
Chicken", an unofficial creature for use with AD&D, may be
written as follows:

     Frequency: Rare      # Appearing: 1-10
     Armor Class: 7       Move: 15"
     Hit Dice: 1+1        % in Lair: 50%
     Treasure Type: Nil   # of Attacks: 1
     Damage/Attack: 1-4   Intelligence: Animal
     Alignment: Neutral   Size: S
     Thaco: 18            XP: 20+2/hp

   Prop Vitals: The "vitals" of a prop include any important
terms and their associated values with respect to the specific
instance of the prop in question. That is to say, while
attributes would be used with respect to "Giant Chickens" in
general, one would use vitals to delineate in game terminology a
specific encounter with some given number of Giant Chickens. For
example, some vitals of a random Giant Chicken might be written
as follows: (HP:3, AC:7, TH:18, D/A:d4, XP:26). What qualifies as
important depends on how the prop is being used. In the example
provided above, the prop is a creature to be used in a combat
encounter. Hence, the combat-related attributes are considered
important, and hence the vitals which are listed are all combat-
related.

   Prop Description: The "description" of a prop includes any
information which cannot be quantified by the game terminology.
For example, the description for the Giant Chicken might be as
follows: "The giant chicken lives in giant chicken coops in
Wisconsin where hero-wizards tend their flocks of sheep."

D. Characters & Places

   Roleplaying is primarily an exercise of the imagination.
Individual players assume the roles of characters in a fictional
game universe, a sort of virtual setting in which the imaginary
events of the game take place. This setting is, essentially, a
fictional background which is either wholly created by the
GameMaster/Referee or which is provided in some sketchy format by
the publishers of the RPG for the GM/Ref to detail.
   Characters are the imaginary people in this roleplaying
background. For example, Navero, the altar boy once played by Dan
Parsons in an AD&D Campaign, is a character. Characters may also
exist as items which have an identifiable and unique personality.
For example, Elric\'s Sword can be considered a character. It is
important to note that races, monsters, and classes are not
characters. While an individual "elf", an individual "orc", or an
individual "fighter" may be characters, until they have been
characterized with an identifiable and unique personality, they
are only props.
   Places are the imaginary localities of a game setting. Hence,
the cities and dungeons Navero visited during Dan Parson\'s
campaign were places.


II. Assertions

A. Terms

   We assert that terms are _not_ copyrightable and that it is
perfectly legal for individuals to incorporate game terminology
into their own works to create and to publish without restraint
new props and rules for any given game system.

B. Rules

   While the letter of copyright law preserves the right to
create a "new" game by paraphrasing the rules of an existing one,
we hold that this is an unethical attempt to steal intellectual
property, and we do not condone or support that. However, we do
support the right to create and distribute alternate/variant/
replacement rules for an RPG as well as new/supplementary rules,
so long as (a) no actual text of any original rules are quoted,
and (b) so long as the author clearly states that the rules he or
she is writing are not a product of the vendor of the game system
so modified and/or supplemented.

C. Props

   We assert that props are copyrightable to the extent that they
are original, but that even if they are completely original, they
may still be legally referenced.

   Use in game supplements and adventures: While the prop
"description" may not be copied outright and verbatim, the
"vitals" of props may be inserted into unofficial game
supplements and adventures as long as the source of the material
is properly cited (see Subsection II.F below).

   Use in programs: The "attributes" of props may be incorporated
into computer software programs in order to determine "vitals"
for any sort of random-generation application. Again, the source
should be properly cited (Subsection II.F).

   Use in stories: Props which can clearly be identified with a
particular game system (i.e. props which are not from mythology
and which are not generic to the genre) can only be used in
stories to the extent they can be used in game supplements and
adventures (i.e. only vitals may be quoted). Since quoting game
stats in a story is generally not going to be desirable, it is
likely most authors will prefer not to use props which can be
identified with a specific game system. For example, there is
little point in saying "Three Umber Hulks show up" if you aren\'t
allowed to describe the Umber Hulks.
   Note, however, that although races are protected by copyright,
it is necessary for someone alleging a violation to show that all
vital elements of the race have been used. You cannot have in
your story a tall, gorilla-like creature called a "Wookie" that
speaks only in grunts and howls and uses a crossbow that fires
light bolts. You can, however, have a short humanoid with furry
feet, a fondness for food and a predilection for extra-legal
acquisition of personal property, provided it isn\'t called a
"Hobbit" (or a "Halfling" for that matter, which is what TSR is
calling them).
   Our suggestion in light of this practice is that you either
acquire permission to use the race in a story or that you change
the race\'s name and enough of its important characteristics to
make it usable in the story as your own separate creation. Of
course, you can use the mythological version of any race that
exists in mythology so long as you stay away from a particular
gamesystem\'s version of that race (for example, the AD&D version
of the Drow is somewhat different from the mythological version,
so if you want to have Drow in your story, make sure you don\'t
use the AD&D version without TSR\'s permission).


D. Characters & Places

   We assert that characters and places are copyrightable to the
extent that they are original. Unlike props, they may not be
referenced except within the most narrow confines.

   Use in game supplements and adventures: You may not write
adventures or supplements which take place in or make use of some
specific locale of a previously published game setting or which
make use of a previously published character. For example, you
may not write an adventure which takes place in Shadowdale of the
Forgotten Realms or which makes use of Elminster the Mage. You
may, however, write an adventure which "could" take place in the
Forgotten Realms or which could even take place in Shadowdale, so
long as it does not refer to specific locales within the Realms
or Shadowdale. In short, either allow the individual GM to
situate the adventure or base it a setting you created yourself.

   Use in programs: You may not write programs which incorporate
or otherwise make use of copyrighted characters or places.

   Use in stories: You may not write stories which make use of
copyrighted characters or places without the permission of the
copyright holder. If you write stories, base them in your own
setting or get the permission of the copyright holder to use
theirs.

E. Attributing Trademarks

   Before a registered trademark is used, it must be properly
attributed to the trademark holder in a conspicuous location of
the document or program (for example, "This Product is for use
with AD&D. AD&D(r) is a registered trademark of TSR, Inc. and is
used here without permission. This use is not intended as a claim
of ownership over the trademark.").
   There are various ways to properly attribute a trademark. Here
are three methods which hopefully might work. (Note: As stated
before, we are not lawyers, so if any of this is wrong, somebody
please correct us.)
      1. List all the trademarks used in the document in a
paragraph at the beginning of the document. You do not have to
make any marks [such as (r) or (tm)] next to these trademarks
during the actual use in the text.
      2. Capitalize all trademarks in the document and write a
paragraph at the beginning of the document disclaiming all
capitalized trademarks as being owned by whomever their
respective owners are.
      3. Insert marks [(r) or (tm)] next to each use of a
trademark. With the first use of each trademark, include a
footnote citing the owner.

F. Providing Source Information

   Whenever a prop from another publication (commercial or
non-commercial, electronic or non-electronic) is referenced,
provide information as to where to find the full description of
the prop.
   * If the source is an individual, state the name or pseudonym
of the author and his or her electronic address.
   * If the source is an electronic document, state the title of
the document and the location (ftp site or www page) where the
document can be found.
   * If the source is non-electronic (i.e. print), state the
publisher, title, and page number(s).

G. Statement of Compatibility

   Observe one of the example formats when alleging compatibility
with a given game system.
      (Good) Example: "This adventure is compatible with AD&D."
      (Good) Example: "This adventure is for use with AD&D."
   Do not use the following format:
      (Bad) Example: "This is an AD&D adventure."

H. Recommendation of Material Requirements

   Inform the target audience what materials are required to
properly use the work in question. For example: "To run this
adventure, you will need a copy of the \'Players Handbook\', the
\'Monster Manual\' and the \'Dungeon Masters Guide\', all published
by TSR."


III. Questions & Answers

A. Porting of Props

   Question: Under these guidelines, are we allowed to "port"
props from one game system to the next? For example, are we
allowed to port Traveller\'s "Aslan" to AD&D?

   Answer: You are allowed to quote the vitals of an Aslan when
writing an adventure for Traveller. However, it would make no
sense whatsoever to quote these vitals in an AD&D adventure. The
two games use entirely different terminology. You may make up
your own AD&D stats for the Aslan if you wish (note, you will
still need to cite your source since you are lifting the name
"Aslan" from a previously published work), but you may not quote
verbatim any significant part of the description of the Aslan. In
short, the answer is no. These guidelines do not allow the
wholesale porting of races between systems.

B. Free-of-Charge vs. For-Profit

   Question: Why aren\'t you making any distinction between works
that are distributed free-of-charge as opposed to those which are
distributed for-profit? After all, this distinction figures into
the first legal criterion for determining whether or not a
derivative work qualifies under fair use. Furthermore, several of
the companies so-far friendly to their consumers on the Internet
have established this in their own policies as an important
distinction.

   Answer: Unfortunately, the courts in the United States don\'t
seem to have made as big a fuss over this criterion as many on
the net would like. Profit and non-profit constitute just one of
the tests a court may apply in determining whether a given use is
"fair use", but it is not statutory, nor is it required in all
cases. In fact, it normally doesn\'t apply unless the court needs
additional justification to substantiate educational use.
Granted, the criterion does come into play when determining fines
if the use is deemed an unlawful infringement of copyright (for-
profit use will trigger a potentially greater fine than non-
profit use). Nonetheless, when determining fair use, the
criterion just isn\'t used as much as most people think.
   Furthermore, making such a distinction does not serve our
purposes in the broader sense. While the immediate issue is to
protect the interests of gamers in distributing their work in the
non-profit arena, if we were to yield the point that only
non-profit work should be protected, then we would be
surrendering competitive marketing opportunities that are in the
best interests of the entire roleplaying games publishing
industry.
   As is stated in the Constitution, the government is empowered
to grant copyrights in order to encourage the production of new
intellectual property. It grants no authority to issue copyrights
because they are profitable or because the author has a "right"
to make money from them, and its authority in this matter ends
when copyrights can be used to block the production of new
material. The Supreme Court has been very consistent within those
boundaries.

C. Re-writing Entire Game Systems

   Question: Within these guidelines you state: "While the letter
of copyright law preserves the right to create a \'new\' game by
paraphrasing the rules of an existing one, we hold that this is
an unethical attempt to steal intellectual property." Is this
really true that the law allows such paraphrasing of an entire
game system? I mean, suppose some company named Voodoo Games does
a complete rewrite of Chivalry & Sorcery and calls it Voodoo
Madness. Obviously, the makers of C&S (wherever they are these
days) wouldn\'t like that one bit.

   Answer: To quote some copyright law: "Copyright protection
does not extend to any idea, system, method, device, or trademark
material involved in the development, merchandising, or playing
of a game." Judging from this statement, Voodoo Madness would be
treated as a new game, albeit one with enough similarities to use
props and adventures and programs and so-forth that were written
to be for use with C&S. Consider it to be "C&S Compliant." To
port this example to the computer industry, there is nothing that
Intel can do to stop AMD from marketing their 486 clone as a 486,
and not even their trademark on the name "Pentium" permits them
to prohibit AMD from claiming its processor is "Pentium-
compatible."
   Despite the clarity of the law, however, people still disagree
as to whether or not such acts in the RPG industry are ethical.
Some argue (as has been successfully argued in the computer
industry) that copycats serve to lower prices and enhance
quality, hence yielding the consumer more bang per buck. However,
we feel that in the RPG publishing industry, such a practice
would be counterproductive simply on the grounds that it is much
easier to copycat a game system than it is to invent a new one,
and hence it is possible that given that option, that is all that
companies would do. This, of course, would reduce innovation, and
it would be bad for the consumer as well as for the hobby in
general. Of course, we also feel that such a practice would be
immoral. People would be able to capitalize on the hard work of
others without paying any licensing fees or royalties whatsoever,
and we feel this is unfair. Since winning lawsuits against such
actions seems somewhat unlikely in light of the current laws,
litigation in such circumstances will probably be designed to
punish and drain resources rather than to win. For the reasons
stated above, we feel such litigation is justified.

D. Campaign Write-ups

   Question: Many gamers like to write-up the events of their
campaigns. Often these campaigns take place in professionally
published game settings. You seem to be stomping on the use in
campaign write-ups (i.e. stories) of races, monsters, as well as
characters and places from such game settings. Isn\'t this against
everything that gamers on the Internet want?

   Answer: Unfortunately, yes, it is against what many people
want. There are certain areas where the law doesn\'t seem to be
designed very well with respect to what we want. Not only does it
make the rewriting of entire game systems legal (something most
gamers could care less about, but something that most games
publishers are bound to hate), but it also seems to make writing
stories about published races or published settings illegal
infringement (something many games publishers wouldn\'t care
about, but something many gamers would like to be allowed to do).
In writing this convention, we tried to steer clear of our
personal wants and prejudices and instead stick fairly close to
the law. We fully expect that some publishers will go the extra
mile and say, "You can write stories set on this game world or
incorporating these races/monsters," however, we didn\'t feel
justified in establishing this for all publishers, particularly
when we knew that such a stand would probably eventually be
struck down in the courts and hence undermine this entire
convention. Everything we put into this work we expect will prove
legally sound. Hence, we see no reason why any game company
shouldn\'t embrace this convention. At least then, we\'ll all be
operating from the same legal altitude and there will be no more
guessing as to what\'s okay and what\'s not.

====================================================================
I think, from a couple of quick reads, that I can live with this
policy.  I\'d quite frankly prefer a policy that is more amenable to
story-writeups of campaigns, and similar non-game works, but I have
to agree with Jim with regards to the current state of legal
sustainability.

Loren, if you\'re reading this, I\'m not asking you to comment on
this proposed policy - in fact, I\'m asking you to wait on such
comment until GDW is approached directly.  However, I think the
list would still like to see some sort of official/semi-official
guidelines from GDW on the general issue of community-generated
materials for the Traveller line.  Are we anywhere near seeing
such?

The BRJ battleraider was designed to after an Imperial Navy study showed 
that battleraider squadrons were often completely destroyed in battle when
encountering superior enemy forces, while battleship squadrons were often
capable of escaping to safe areas. As a result the very limited jump-1
capability was provided. 
In order to provide a significant armor protection without excessively
increasing the total weight at the detriment of agility, it was decided
to equip the ship with a double hull. The internal hull with armor 80
contains sensors, communication, weapons, computers, screens, environment
controls, the power plant, and 10 per cent of the fuel capacity. The external
armor 40 hull contains the internal hull plus the remaining ship components.

    Hey, if anyone found my comment on evolution, and my reason for 
making those comment offensive.  I appologize, it wasn\'t my intention 
to start any kind of discussion on it.  This isn\'t the place for such a 
debate.

    This I agree on.  Does anyone screen the messages that get posted?  
I am really, really sick of this kind of nonsense!  I recommend a 
message to the "postmaster" account at the site that messages such as 
this originated from.

The article\'s main points are:

1. Number of ships in port
2. Number of Docking Bays per port
3. Jump-point - incl. star system jump-point cascade
4. Encounter Tables - ideas in their creation

The following text is taken from Section 3, "Jump-point":

"The jump-point J-1 is the largest solar mass in-system and the next
largest mass in-system with an unconfined jump-point is J-2, and so on."
Examples of confined jump-points were Mercury and Venus, being within
Sol\'s 100-diameter limit. The article also said that "... a starship
could have an unconfined jump-point if it were outside the jump-point
of a planet or star".

The sample table is shown below:

"Unconfined Jump-points in Two Sample Systems

      Terra/Sol     Regina/Regina*
J-1   Sol           Lusor
J-2   Jupiter       Assiniboia
J-3   Saturn        Olybrius
J-4   Terra         ----
J-5   Mars          ----
J-6   Ceres         ----
*Lusor only
Note: - Terra is just barely an unconfined jump-point.
      - Titan is partially unconfined at J-3 Saturn.
      - Olybrius is an unconfined J-3 only when it is farthest from
        Lusor, and may be partially confined when nearest Lusor.
      - Regina is easily accessable through J-2."

All quoted text is taken from the following article:

No, I can understand that. Alas, as far as I know, the only
sources about Corridor sector *are* out of print.

The best source I know of is from "the Travellers\' Digest"
#19 (I think it was #19). There was all you ask for: Sector
map with trade routes, UWPs and library data.

If you like, I can photocopy this stuff and snail mail it. Let
me know.

and a Blue Regiment Delta  in a desertic range.

As usual it has been abridged, the unabridged version is in
http://astro.sns.it/~mstiavel/Traveller

Red order of battle:
3 Mechanized companies
Anti-Tank section (from mech btn)
FIST section (from mech btn)
1 Air-Defence section (from mech btn)
1 Cavalry troop
1 Air-Defence section (from Artillery grp)
2 FIST sections (from Artillery grp)
1 Meson-Gun Boat (from Artillery grp)
6 S-drones

Blue order of battle:
3 Cavalry troops
1 Tank company (from cavalry sqdn)
2 FIST sections (from cavalry sqdn)
1 Air-Defence section (from Artillery grp)
2 FIST sections (from Artillery grp)
1 Meson-Gun Boat (from Artillery grp)
10 S-drones

The battle went as follows:

The Blue has the initiative and moves two platoons of mechanized infantry
and one air-defence section on the target, while moving all forces to
surround it. A fair fraction of its units are moved at subsonic speed to 
reduce signature. 
The Red moves most of its forces near the target, moving at subsonic speed. 
Two Red mechanized infantry companies and the tank company face the target,
while the third mechanized infantry company attempts an encircling maneuver
(moving at supersonic speed).
Once at their final positions (15 km from the target for some three platoons)
the infantry dismounts from the vehicles.

Both parties carry out numerous sensor tasks. Two Blue mechanized platoon
are detected and fired upon by the Meson gun boat and the Anti-tank
section. However, both fire at more than 50 km range and miss the
target. Further recognaissance from the Red identifies the Blue forces
on the target. They are fired upon by a Red FIST section at 45 km
range and destroyed. The Red FIST is then destroyed by Blue Meson Gun fire.

Both parties become very conservative in the use of their Artillery,
to avoid counterbattery fire. In practice, the use is restricted to
low signature weapons (Meson Gun and, for the Red, Anti-Tank guns).

The Red occupies the target with dismounted infantry. The battle
becomes confused and violent with the Blue attempting to destroy the
Red tanks while trying to preserve its numerically inferior infantry.
Since the Blue has available a total of 9 platoon equivalents of tanks
(6 cavalry lances + 1 tank company), while the Red has only 3, it is
relatively easy for the Blue to eliminate the Red Tank force. At this
stage the Blue can start to engage the Red infantry which is now 
incapable of penetrating the armor of the Blue tanks (except by
directing long distance artillery fire).

The end-result could then be classified as a Blue marginal victory.

Lessons:
1- mechanized infantry needs a weapon able to inflict at least
   low penetration hits to the cavalry tanks.
2- infantry can be useful to held positions since it has low
   visibility and it can be used to direct Meson Gun fire.
3- with improved anti-tank infantry weapons and speed reduced to
   subsonic to avoid detection, the MBGT, with its heavier armor, 
   regains part of its usefulness.

As a reaction to the these engagements the Imperial Army has introduced the
IFV2, a version of the IFV with one of the point defence RPA14 replaced
by a fusion gun FY14 able to penetrate the CGT and CGT2 armor
(although not the MBGT armor).

Mark Seemann <ms@oem.dk> is right about the best source being an
old issue of DGP\'s _Traveller\'s_Digest_ (he says issue 19; I think
it actually more like 16 or 17.)  I\'ve got them all a home, so I
can\'t be sure.  I *can*, however, point you at a readily available
source for the entire UWP list for the sector.  Check the following
ftp site (the original TML archives):

    ftp.engrg.uwo.ca:~ftp/pub/traveller/sectors/dgp-updated

All of the sector data files are in that directory (I just checked.)

    I wish I knew how this message got so garbled.  I figured I might 
as well re-send it, ungarbled.

    In issue #2 of the Traveller Chronicle it mentions that Ares 
magazine originally printed material on the Far Frontiers Sector in 
1984.  Does anyone happen to know what issues, and is this the same

    You can get the UWP\'s and world locations for this sector and many 
others from the following FTP site.

    ghost.cc.missouri.edu
            in directory /PUB/Traveller/sectors/dgp-original or
                         /PUB/Traveller/sectors/dgp-updated

  Well, I borrowed a copy of this lovely new Traveller novel from a friend 
who got it at a con.  This review contains no spoilers, aside from what 
you learn in the first chapter or two.  Comments and flames welcome.

TECHNICAL DATA

Paul Brunette, "To Dream of Chaos," GDW, 1995, $5.95, 342 pages + 9 page 
Glossary, Paperback, ISBN 1-55878-184-6


OVERALL IMPRESSIONS

  Those of you who read my review of the first of GDW\'s Traveller novels, 
"The Death of Wisdom" will remember that I was less than kind.  I am 
happy to say that I found this book rather better, though still not 
great.  If "The Death of Wisdom" deserved no more than a D grade, "To 
Dream of Chaos" is a solid C+.  The action descriptions are good, 
the plot fairly interesting, at least for the first 80% of the book (more 
on this later), and the character development good.

  The only objection I have is the same one I had to "The Death of 
Wisdom" - everybody, and I do mean everybody, is stupider than the PCs, 
and the PCs are none too bright themselves.  Needless to say, I can\'t 
really go into this without spoiling the plot, but for me at least it 
rather spoils things when the protagonists are able to outwit their 
opponents almost at will.  What this series needed from the begining was 
a smart villain - unless the Hivers are behind everything (and I\'m sure 
they are), there really is nothing going on here beyond some heroic 
thrashing about.

  However, if you look beyond the plot, there is some good stuff for a 
Traveller GM here, even Traveller GMs who don\'t use The New Era setting.

PLOT

  It gives essentially nothing away to say that the mission involves a 
journey beyond the boarders of the Reformation Coalition to find a cache 
of pre-Collapse high-tech weapons.  The crew from the first book returns 
intact, with a few extra obvious NPC ground-pounder Marines.  Since the 
crew did so well last book, this time they get extra weapons on their 
ship and a Intrepid tank.  They leave from Aubaine, visit Oriflamme (nice 
short portrait of that planet\'s culture), and after having a few 
adventures along the way, get to the planet where the cache is supposed 
to be.  The characters then thrash about.  Without giving away the plot, 
I can\'t tell you about how things degenerate into a cliche around page 
250, but suffice it to say a different and hopefully more original ending 
would be a lot better.  Aside from that, pretty good, with the caveat 
that the protagonists are smarter than everybody else (god, I hate that!).

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

  This is the area of most improvement over the first novel.  The author 
spends some time on character development this time, and I had a much 
greater sympathy for the individuals described.  I was actually sad when 
some folks were killed off.

TRAVELLER CONTENT

  There are plenty of descriptions of stuff from the Traveller universe,
and long-time Traveller fans will feel right at home.  I sighed with
nostalgia when a Kinunir-class frontier cruiser showed up - I had such a
good time with that adventure back in 1979 (Classic Traveller Adventure 1,
for you newbies out there).  By the way, Hiver "Corn Dogs" are served - Yum
Yum!  We even get a hint that they are some subtle form of Hiver
manipulation (but what Hiver thingie isn\'t?). 

OVERALL

  Again, a solid but not inspired effort.  I\'d enjoy discussing the plot 
with those who have read the book, but I\'ll keep that off the list until 
everybody who wants to read it has had a chance to do so.  Private e-mail 
welcome.

extensively discussed before that this post draws pgip 
attacks (here in Berkeley, we call them "plasma gun, 
individual-portable", not the sexist/specist 
"man-portable").

In MT, are astrogation and its related observing and 
measuring devices adequate for ships to rendezvous at 
prearranged coordinates in a hex not containing a star 
system?

It seems that it would not be difficult to say, "we\'ll
meet during the period 100 to 110-1109 in the Terra/Sol
system, at Point Option, defined as the intersection of
Line A and Line B, where Line A runs through the centers of
Sol and Terra and Line B runs through the centers of Mars
and Jupiter." A ship could jump into the system anywhere,
observe the location of the four points, draw the lines to
determine , use the computer to figure out where Point 
Option will be when the ship arrives, and go there.

Now suppose you want to meet in deep space, more than one
parsec from any star system.  One problem with defining
Point Option as the intersection of lines connecting two
stars is that the lines may not be in the same planes, and
hence may not intersect.  So our definition of Point
Option must be more complex.  Maybe it\'s the point at which 
the angle between the rays from the point to stars A and B 
measures x degrees, and the rays from the point to stars A 
and C measures y degrees.

So if we define Point Option as in the last paragraph, how
much error will our ship\'s sensors and computer cause; or,
stated more relativistically, how much will our conception
of Point Option\'s location disagree with that of the other 
ship(s) that we\'re meeting here?

In what other ways have you handled or heard of handling
deep space rendezvous?

The Traveller Adventure involves the PCs in a tradewar scenario, wherein 
they are given the coordinates of a Tukera deep-space rendezvous (for 
their jump-1 Hercules transports, etc.). So jumping to a given, 
prearranged point in deep space is canonically possible.

Since mini-jumps are possible, it follows that jump distances can be 
controlled with a bit of finesse. Even without a gravity well to pull one 
out of jump, arranging a rendezvous w.r.t. the centre of mass of each of 
three visible stars ought to work well enough -- as long as you want to 
be found at the rendezvous.

Selecting a rendezvous point based on "intersection of line Star A to 
Star B with line Star C to Star D" should work just fine, probably 
putting the vessels well within 1 Mkm of each other - enough that radio 
beacons or flashing light patterns can be easily detected.

Actually, radio beacons, regularly flashing lights, and similar methods 
should work just fine out to 10-100 Mkm. However, it is not particularly 
stealthy - are you expecting someone else in the area at the time?

What I meant by patient is that you may come out a few 100 Mkm from your 
rendezvous point, which may take some time to cover.  Or you could come 
out within 2km of your friend.  Since the local parameters are difficult 
to pin down that tightly due to a lack of referents, the variance is 
somewhat wider than jumping into a populated system. (This last sentence 
is more based on my belief of how the mechanics of jump-drive should 
operate; if you feel differently, your performance will differ).

What is the explanation for how teleportation on an orbital scale is

and then goes on to mention crossing lines between known objects to get a
meeting point in space.

My comments are:
3D-nav in space uses measured positions of system bodies plus data from nav
satellites/beacons to locate oneself according to a 3D XYZ or angle/range
coordinate system, usually centred (e.g. XYZ = 0,0,0) on the main system
star. In addition to the possibility of extending these coordinates out
beyond the given parsec into adjacent ones there are also wider-scale
navigation coordinates based in the 3D position of star systems around a
ship, etc. Although the Traveller parsec mapping appears planar (2D), this
is widely accepted to be an approximation with \'adjacent\' parsecs often some
distance above or below this plane. Some coordinate systems radiate from a
given homeworld to the subsectors around, while others are based on the
theoretical centre of the Milky Way. Such involve _huge_ numbers to get a
resolution of even millions of kilometres, let alone tens or hundreds.

3D positioning by satellite is a common system now (GPS, etc.) and merely
requires distances to be measured (using the time delay of a signal from the
beacon) from which, given the known locations of the satellites (data
transmitted by the satellites themselves) you can calculate your 3D
position. No \'line intersection\' is required.

Accuracy at parsec ranges is not obtainable using the nav beacon systems
because:
(a) No one bothers to transmit that powerful a signal when the main use is
in system, so a parsec away you can\'t detect the signal.
(b) If you could receive it, it would be 3.26 years out of date. Not much
use unless you keep accurate almanacs detailing the satellite movements etc.
for the past 3-4 years.

So, the directions to multiple stars (any direction - no intersecting
lines!) would be used to calculate 3D position in deep space. Probably
accurate to within a few tens of kilometres given the high tech sensors and
computers to be found on even a simple trader ship.

Hope this is of some use?

This was a little something that I once thought of - why has there not been
a refueling station built in the middle of the Great Rift to enable less
than J5 crossings? It would only need J2 or J3 tankers moving fuel to it on
a regular basis and you could have a convenient waypoint for traders - with
fuel at much increased prices to pay for the priviledge.

So I reasoned that if they don\'t do it, then they can\'t!

My reasoning and handling of Jump drives is that they are intrinsically
linked to gravitational wells. This is not so unreasonable as they are
obviously affected by them due to misjump likelihood within 100 diameters of
a planet etc.

So, in my universe, Jump Drives link two places of equal gravitational
potential. i.e. if you jump 101 diameters out from a planet, you will arrive
101 diameters away from the next one. (In actual fact, I prefer to use
0.0001 G and 0.01 G as my jump problem cutoffs rather than 100 and 10
diameters and recalculate diameters for extremely dense or un-dense(?)
bodies). Sort of a conservation of gravitational potential energy type idea.

Hence, you could not jump into an empty hex as there is no equal gravity
potential location to jump from. (I guess if you really wanted to spend a
few weeks trawling out of system on M-Drives to a very low gravitational
potential then you could do it).

I also do not allow specific positioning of re-entry point and exact
orientation - you know exactly how far out you will arrive, but it could be
anywhere on that sphere. The point on the sphere will technically depend on
the positions of the other bodies in that system and their cumulative effect
on the gravitational potential which is far beyond the scope of a
roleplaying game, so I just take the nearest body. This unknown arrival
point prevents the old rock chucking exercise :-) However, for the sake of
heightened gameplay, I do allow task checks to place the ship *roughly* in
the right place and pointing the right way, but never exactly.

I suppose it is possible to go and build an artificial planetoid out in an
empty hex and use that as a gravity well which you can match in the
departure system, but this would be a massive project requiring
transportation by M-Drive first. 
Hey - adventure idea - misjump into an empty hex containing a jump

[description of gravitational jump deleted]

While your idea does have merit, the reason that I think they never
bothered making a way station is simply due to the fact that it would
cost too much for fuel way out there.

Likewise, you\'re very screwed if you do misjump in there.  You\'ve got
absolutely nothing to point yourself too.  Theoretically, if someone
really goofed up they could just low berth themselves and point their
ship to a star and have the computer thaw them out when they get
insystem.  A person doesn\'t even have that option in the Great Rift.

However, I have always thought that the military would do something
like setting up a refueling station there.  Likewise, I also think that
they might have a hidden space/way station there.  Secret cache of
weapons/ships/supplies that aren\'t easily accessible except by some
j5-j6 Battle Riders and large convoy ships...

Oh well, just a thought.

Yes you can meet in deep space.  In the Traveller Adventure the 
March Harrier co-ordinates its\' movement with a patrol cruser
to ambush a poor defense-less trader in a deep space Hex.

You use Pulsars to locate youself in space.  Three stars are 
needed (Two stars define a circle in space, the thrid gives you
the point on the circle), more stars give greater accuracy.
The reason for Pulsars, they don\'t move.  (Ok they are ziping 
through space at a fair rate, but their angular change is non-
existant.)  T.C.S. use : fuel dumps in deep space.  One tanker
support group per squadron using pre-arranged random locations in 
the deep space hex next to the target using timed attacks.  No way of
clearing the hex (a ship in the centre would get sensor information

The idea of jump from equipotential points has indeed the advantage of
conserving energy but seems to me quite in contrast with the rules.

The 100 diameters idea is not that bad since, under the assumption that
all bodies have roughly the same density, makes the jump
dependent on the strength of tidal forces (rather than potential
or force) which are related to the Christoffel symbols in general
relativity. Why it should be so is unclear, but since in G.R. every
observer can choose a coordinate system making spacetime locally flat
with only tidal forces left, such a dependence does not seem totally
dumb. Actually I must admit that I found it surprisingly smart, and
would be tempted to guess that GDW did not think about it.

The 100 diameters rule would then have to be changed near extremely dense
bodies like white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes.

In this scheme energy conservation must be solved in some other way,
my best guess is thermal radiation: the jump drive releases enormous
amounts of energy which could be easily decreased or increased by
the potential energy difference (which above 100 diameters is not
very large). 

>From the game point of view I have always use the jump in the middle
of nowhere capability. Fleets do it, players do it. 
The ability to jump where no star exists also affects to a significant
extent naval strategy.

In my universe there are also a certain number of refuelling stations in 
the rift but they are reserved to military and intelligence purposes. Once
it is possible not doing it would not be smart..

Yes.  Ships can choose a set of jump coordinates for an arbitrary location
in deep space, and ships jumping to those coordinates will be able to
contact one another without difficulty.

A canonical reference exists in _The Traveller Adventure_.  A deep-space
location is used for rendezvous and refuelling by Akerut Lines, a Tukera
subsidiary.  During a tradewar with Oberlindes Lines, Oberlindes manages
to acquire the rendezvous coordinates, and dispatches a few starships to
capture Akerut ships that use the point.

Normal interstellar navigation routines, for programming jumps, have to be
accurate to within a few light-seconds at very most.  This is easily
accurate enough to establish a rendezvous.

I once had my players misjump into a hex containing nothing but a derelict
Azhanti High Lightning cruiser.  They had to siphon jump fuel from the 
cruiser (it had only been derelict a month or two so the fuel was still
liquid).  Since I\'d just seen Aliens, I threw in a reason why the cruiser
was derelict, with strange creatures lurking on board ...

It was fun and it gave me a chance to use my Lightning blueprints.

The Imperium DID build mid-rift refuelling points (yes, this is canonical).
It has been stated that Dulinor and/or Lucan destroyed them during the 
laughingly-labelled "Final War".
(I call it this because: a. no war is ever the final one, and b. it has
nothing on the real "Final War", 300,000 years earlier).

I am not at home, so cannot supply the page reference - I think it was
at least mentioned in the Arrival Vengance adventure, as the ship is
trying to get back home. I am sure that it is mentioned earlier, though.

In xboat 348, Tony Reynolds <cctony@tp.backbone.olemiss.edu> asks:
>Is there any explanation ever given for the positioning of the Octagon and
>the base below? A book/page reference would be nice.

No. The only thing you can guess at, reading between the lines, is that
the original Octagon guy was stranded on the same planet. It says
that he underwent some sort of "conversion" after his rescue, becoming
fanatical that no-one would ever suffer as he did - but what if it was
due to the sight of the base? He could have built the Octagon above it - or,
even more likely, he FOUND the Octagon and used it as a model for all
the others! The guy could even have changed his story to say that he was
marooned elsewhere - diverting attention away from the base.

BTW, in my universe, the "Shadows" pyramids ARE also of Ancient origin. I
ignored the original description of the inhabitants, reasoning that the
adventure was very early, and probably prior to the ideas of "Gamma",
"Peak" and "Secrets". If it had been a later adventure, I am sure that
they would have been of the same origin.

Yes, but the library data entry for Astrography in the Imperial Encyclopedia 
(page 19) doesn\'t include the numbers which were detailed in the original 
entry in Supplement 8 - Library Data (A-M).

Note: The text that follows is lifted directly from Supplement 8, which is 
copyright by GDW. My copying it out here (and my almost inevitable typos or 
misspellings) is not intended as a challenge to that copyright.

>From page 15 of Library Data (A-M):

<quote>

Astrography: The science of mapping interstellar space. Basic to any science 
of mapping is a coordinate system. The system used by the Imperium is based 
on rings of longitude, rays of latitude, and parsecs. Rays of latitude 
extend from the galactic core, while concentric rings of longitude are 
placed at one parsec intervals. By convention, the concentric ring passing 
through Reference/Capital is labelled the 10,000th ring, and is used as a 
baseline. Similarly, the ray of latitude extending from the centre of the 
galaxy through Reference/Capital is designated as the first ray. Measurement 
is in parsecs, counting in the trailing direction. Computation reveals that 
the circumference of the 10,000th ring (r=10,000) is 62,832 parsecs. 
Counting spinward uses a subtraction from 62,833, which is the equivalent of 
the zero baseline.
For example, Regina, of the Regina Subsector, in the Spinward Marches, is 
9930 ring/ray 62723. The format for expression of location is xxxx ring/ray 
yyyy, where xxxx is the ring of longitude (distance from the galactic core 
in parsecs), and yyyy is the distance of the ray of latitude (in parsecs) 
from the first ray of latitude, measured along the ring of longitude in the 
trailing direction.

<end quote>

When I ran a Fifth Frontier War campaign, which included a large amount of 
covert action in the non-aligned worlds between the Zho and the Darrians, we 
used this system a lot. Although we never did detail exactly how you 
calculated your position within a parsec, we tacitly assumed that it was all 
a matter of degrees, minutes and seconds (or other subdivisions) of latitude 
and longitude in much the same way that present day ships find their 
position at sea.
The system would only need to be accurate down to a few hundred kilometres 
(I\'ve had experience of navigation at sea being anything up to 300 yards off 
 - according to the navigator we were about 200 yards offshore, while 
according to the instruments the ship we were in was halfway up the Dorset 
cliffs!). If your two ships jump into a \'box\' a few hundred kilometres 
across, they\'d be able to pick each other up very easily using passive 
sensors (or active sensors if you didn\'t care who knew you were there).

This system works fine for a two-dimensional area, such as the Third 
Imperium (as printed). If you wanted an astrogation system for a 
three-dimensional area, you could just add a z-axis, similar to the one used 
in 2300AD.

If you want a primer on navigation, pick up any basic yacht navigation text. 
That should give you enough to go on.

Hope this is of use.

movie, because I\'ve solved it by watching the preview.  
(Maybe it\'s no more stupid than other Hollywood 
blockbusters, but I just missed those previews.)

Anyway, the preview indicates the following:  In the
future the earth has become covered by water.  The movie
concerns the search for the last spot of dry land.

Now if the level of water has risen enough to cover the
earth, it will do so evenly, and the places with the
greatest elevation will be the last covered -- so Mt.
Everest should be the last spot above water.  The latitude
of Mt. Everest is known, and latitude can be determined
with simple navigational instruments (I think just a
sextant).  So Mt. Everest will have the highest population
density and tightest security of any spot on the planet.

Now I suppose from the preview that the water level 
increased because the ice caps melted, but I leave for 
others to figure out whether there is actually enough water 
there to raise the water level nearly six miles.

The only other scenario that I can imagine for increasing
the water levels is that a meteorite with sufficient
displacement falls into the ocean.  Then maybe part of the
meteorite would be sticking above the water.  In that
scenario, all human life (and most other life above insect
level of complexity) would surely be destroyed by the
earthquakes and nearly instantaneous flooding.  In
addition, the planet would probably be knocked out of its
orbit, with dire effects on the climate (for colder or
warmer).  (Of course, any survivors would have kept track
of where the meteorite hit, and would find it with simple
navigation once it cooled.) 

Am I missing something here?  Should I see this one on the 
off-chance that I\'ll get a good idea for a Traveller 
campaign (I\'ve just run an episode on a waterworld, but it 
wasn\'t a post-holocaust type of thing).

Well, you\'re right, to an extent. From the looks of things, the Himalayas 
were the last spot on Earth to remain as dry land. A few of your 
assumptions, however, weren\'t on the mark...

It looks like some disaster did occur to cause the melting of the polar 
ice caps, which did indeed result in a reversal of the earth\'s magnetic 
poles (something which has happened in the past, w/ or w/out natural 
disaster). As a result, the \'map\' (a tattoo on a young girls back) proves 
to have the wrong co-ordinates unless you do some reversing around.

OK, it\'s not exactly a clear explanation, but I don\'t really want to 
spoil the movie for anyone who actually sees it. My biggest complaint is 
that there is no way in hell you can row an oil tanker.

Oh, finally, I get to use my favourite
piece of trivia...

Actually, Mt. Killimanjaro (sp??) in Africa will be covered
last. Everest is the highest mountain base to tip,
but Killimanjaro is the hisgest SEA LEVEL to tip.
The Earth is oblate, being squashed slightly along 
it\'s axis of rotation. Sea level is a closer-to-perfect
sphere, so Killimanjaro gets a boost by starting 
higher than Everest does.

Trivally,

..and Reference/Core is in hex 0140, which puts it in the lower left-hand
corner of Core sector.  This suggests that the sector boundaries may be
defined by ring/rays, with the rimward border of Core sector following
10000 ring and the spinward border following ray 1.  Then the trailing
border would be ray 33 and the border to galactic coreward, the 9960 ring.

Of course, if sector borders strictly follow rings and rays, they aren\'t
*quite* straight anymore, and they pick up some problems with minor but
obvious distortion from the traditional grid the farther they get from 
the Imperial Core.  It could be that the sector grid is based on the IISS
navigational system, but doesn\'t follow it slavishly.  However, it does
explain why regions are "sectors"; they can be thought of as being roughly
sectors of the galactic disk. 

This notation may explain the what the "Prime Radiant" mentioned in 
_Survival Margin_ is; it could be a fancy name for ray 1.

Well, a few notes.

Everest isn\'t highest base to top by a ways.  It is the highest above mean
sea level (I can\'t remember the highest from local low point to summit--in
fact
I believe in the local minimum to maximum catagory, even Ranier is "longer").

If the point was that since the earth is oblate near the equator, and sea
level 
is defined as a sphere, you\'re right... the only problem is that it\'s oblate
for
a reason, and water would follow the same rules (and it does) and bulge along
the equator as well, so in this case, you might still get your feet wet :)

I didn\'t include the entire library data entry because it was getting a bit 
long. The final paragraph (in both CT and MT library data entries) notes 
that the system is only good for an area roughly 400 parsecs across before 
the distortion gets too great. Still, it was good enough for the IISS.

An interesting exercise might be to work out what astrogation systems the 
other major races use. Anybody?

 I\'m sorry.  It\'s totally tacky and speciesist, but I can\'t resist:

 Perhaps they don\'t stick their heads out the window while driving

1.  Starship self-destruct 

I assume that naval-type vessels will have self-destruct
capabilities (as in the Classic Star Trek episode, Let
That Be Your Last Battlefield). The most efficient
destructive methods that I can imagine are (1) programmed
jump failure and (2) fusion power plant explosion. Can the
fusion power plant be made to explode (like a hydrogen
bomb, or in some other way)?  If so, what about the fusion
plant of your 15-year-old\'s grav scooter? (I\'m just
shuddering at the thought of certain fifteen year olds with
whom I went to high school armed with nuclear weapons --
well, one of them did end up on nuclear subs, and we\'re all
still here.) 

Suggestions on the extent of damage to nearby ships
(destruction of boarding parties and their mother ships
would sort of an anticipatory revenge function of the
self-destruct function) are also solicited.

2.  Nuclear missiles

What are the explosive parts of starship (or other) nuclear
weapons made of?  Uranium? Plutonium? Hydrogen?  Other
materials?  I suppose that the answer varies somewhat by
tech level -- U at TL6-7, Pu/H at TL8-9, etc.  What will be
used at higher tech levels (Cf is mentioned in Striker,
e.g.)?  

Will my sensor officer be able to scan a battle-damaged 
ship and say, "radiospectroscopy indicates ytterbium -- and 
the Zhodani are known to be using ytterbium warheads on 
their anti-ship missiles!"?

    'body' => 'Yo Folkes,
    I took brief umbrage at a previous message where a poster
said that because he was a "Christian" he considered much of
SF fantasy. I wished to correct him saying that the bulk of
Christians are happy considering the creation myths in Genesis
along side the parables of Jesus as religious education stories,
not literal truth. It is the Fundamentalist (or Evangelical)
movements of Christianity, Judaism and Islam that choose to
believe these things literally, and dispite the press, these
are not the mainstream, world-wide.
    However having spawned far too many political arguments in
the past (i.e. more than one) I didn\'t want to spawn a religious
one. So I made no direct response. It does, though, bring up an
interesting field that has never been adequately exploited in
most role-playing games: religion. Obviously real publishers
stay well away from it for commercial reasons but as religious
is often such a large part of our lives (if not personally then
how it affects people we deal with) it should be a fertile
ground for RPGs.
    In a Paranoia campaign I played in I had a character who
dealt with, and was eventually converted by, The First Church
of Christ: Computer Programmer. It was great fun trying to
reinterpret Christianity in the world of Alpha Complex (gives
a whole new meaning to the Alpha and the Omega :-). I even
went so far as to "translate" the first few books of Mark
to Alpha Complex Terms. Amusing, fun, and perhaps giving a
small insight into our own religious experience.
    Anyway, in a Traveller setting worlds are often portrayed
as extensions of certain mundane stereotypes. There are already
two government codes for religious based societies.
    A wonderful example of a good use of religion in SF is
Dune by Frank Herbert (actually I would be A Canticle for Liebowitz
at the top but that doesn\'t have as many RPG hooks). Forget
about the big worms. Forget about the spice. Forget about the
woeful notion of biological determinism that permeates the
whole first book. Instead read the appendicies. Read about the
council of religions and the religious history of the Empire.
Take and use.
    For example "The Butlerian Jihad" was a movement to exterminate
all "thinking machines". Parallels exist in Traveller with the
Society for Supremacy of Man over Machine (?). Take the philosophy,
permeate it with religious ritual and language, and populate a
planet with it. The temptation is to play such a place as ignorant
fanatics. I would urge you not to. These are likely to be genuine
people with genuine concerns for your players soul. They may phrase
their concerns in religious terms like "use of Abominations imperils
your soul" where the philosophical translation is "reliance on
machines you cannot reproduce leaves you vulnerable to what
unreliability they possess."
    In Dune a large Ecumenical Council was convened to put an end
to religious factionalism. They spent a good number of years and
together produced a body of literature "The Orange Catholic Bible"
to subsume the best and most tolerant of all their religions.
Many of them were lynched and all but 12 of the original 120(?)
recanted. Yet 4000 years later this has become THE religious work.
Using this sort of a mechanic in a campaign is very useful as
it allows the DM to develop and become familiar with a single
religious tract for the whole Imperium.
    One of the coolest concepts in Dune was "The Missonaria
Protectivia" (sp?). This was a branch of the Bene Gesserit (which
can be described as a religion) sent "missionaries" out beyond 
the fringe during their equivalent of The Long Night. They contacted
primitive or emerging cultures and indoctrinated them with
myth-cycles and specific religious language and terminology.
Easily accomplished through the use of more advanced drugs and
machines. Thus as their Empire pushed back the borders, sometimes
hundreds of years later, their "cult" could step in, fulfil these
amazing secret prophecies, and immediately be accepted in
religious authority by the people. It would be really cool as
a particular offshoot of the Scout service.
    So lets go back to the original seed of this discussion.
Fundamentalism provides a satisfying religious view for a
large number of people. It is unlikely to go away in the
future. What of a world of such people? Say the players had
the first Aslan to visit the world. What would a people who
religious don\'t believe in aliens make of it? Again, the temptation
is to play them as bigoted fanatics, willing to kill and eradicate
this challenge to their ways. Perhaps at a common level this idea
might permeate. However it is more likely that those religiously
trained would attempt to seek to understand where this fits
into their religion. Perhaps there is an overlooked hook in
their Holy Book that can be reinterpreted to deal with such.
Perhaps a wider interpretation of another statement. Congregations
would be upset at this apparent challenge and such players might
find their Clergy more than willing to engage in discourse to
attempt to find their place in the universe so that they can
pass the message on.
    Take it another way. Say a member of clergy from some
religion crashed on a primitive planet. Say she was moved by
what were obviously intelligent, non-human natives, and
preached her religion. Say this caught on and long after her
death these aliens are contacted and given spaceflight. Perhaps
they might particularly welcome it because now they can go
on pilgrimage to all the ancient shrines and holy places of
"their" religion. But if the original religion (or its descendant)
does not accept alien worshipers, the conflict of the devout
has much potential. Especially if the players are piloting the
ship of the pilgrims on behalf of the Scout service for Imperial
concessions on the new planet.
    The last word I would say is "don\'t back out for fear of
offending people". There are loads of conflicting view in modern
society. They challenge people and make people think. As long
as you don\'t try to say what you portray in the game relates to
reality they can always take the approach that it is all "fantasy".
Always allow for the exploration of new ideas. Role-playing doesn\'t
have to be "Just Escapism". 
     Cheers,

    'body' => 'consider two sorts of plausible fusion power:

	hot fusion (like JET and other experimnts in C20 earth)

	cold fusion (hey, this is SF, so maybe it works!)

for a decent explosion you need a rapid discharge of *lots* of energy, typically 
the equivalent of runnign a power plant for a prolonged period but discharged
over a very short period -- anything else produces a messy melt down and 
possible fires, but doesn\'t go Bang!!...
 
Cold fusion isn\'t going to blow up worse than TNT at most; In cold fusion we\'re 
supposed to see the catalytic fusion of limited quantities of hydrogen which has 
been absorbed into a spongy metal catalyst under pressure in the presence of a 
high electric current -- the output is much higher than burning the hydrogen gas 
in oxygen. If it fails, the fusion stops, and the gas may be released from the 
metal catalyst...
The stored energy for instant release is only that bound up in compressing the 
hydrogen, and in burning the hydrogen on contact with air.  I think you\'d be 
safer with this than if an equivalent pertol engine blew up (as the petrol 
engine holds more inflammable fuel per power delivered!)


Hot fusion is what most people think of, but it still isn\'t going to produce a 
large bang.  The reactor is a large bulky vessel most of which generates 
magnetic fields (or SF "force fields") to hold  a hot low density ionized plasma 
- specifically, to hold it away from the reactor\'s metal walls where it would

(a) cut into the metal, (b) cool and (c) be contaminated so it stopped fusing..

If the plasma expands and/or mixes with cold matter, it rapidly falls below the 
neccessary conditions for fusion.  Hydrogen/deuterium/tritium/helium fusion 
reactions in plasmas are all susceptible to poisoning by heavy elements like 
iron from metal walls, which saps the plasma. 

As far as most kiddies-on-grav-bikes problems go, the biggest problem is the 
megawatt heat exhaust the standard models seem to pump out, presumably torching 
anything nearby as they pass by!

You could consider the catastrophic collapse of a *large* reactor as being 
equivalent to the blast of a Fusion Gun of some suitable size, but even in this 
case, you aren\'t going to get a significant discharge before it flickers out as 
the plasma expands/cools (fusion guns are specially designed to sustain the 
reaction and cause damage - reactors are designed to produce steady power (and 
be safe in normal operations)).  If I remember right, a lot of the discharge 
energy in a fusion beam is not in the fusion occurring during the beam 
discharge, but in a confined fusion burn which heats a sealed quantity of plasma 
before release - a souped up verion of the plasma gun. 
Such a fusion blast could be quite big, but not like the Trekkie blasts...

The reactors with the greatest liability are those playing with bulk quantities 
of Anti-Matter -- which is of course. just what Star Trek has!  If the 
containment of a large quantity of hot anti-matter fails, so that a mass 
annihilation occurs with the surrounding normal matter (reactor walls), then you 
could be in for a nasty bang.
If designing such a system for safety, a starship engineer should arrange that 
in the worst case of failure, the A-M gas vents into space, *away* from any bits 
of spaceship and other matter it can react with!
	(I\'d also ban such a thing from entering the atmosphere of any planet I 
	controlled, lest it vent and blast into the air!)

If you wanted a self destructor, chuck in a large mix of matter-anti-matter and 
confine it for as long as possible, then as the containment fields begin to 
fail, switch them off.....

The easiest way to self-destruct a Trav ship is to let off your own Nukes if 
any, or if a warship, to play with the Nuclear Dampers turning them into full

reverse on said Nukes.

Glenn Goffin asks what sort of radioactive materials might be used at higher
tech levels.  I think GDW has yet again overlooked an important consequence of
traveller technology.  I would guess that after nuclear dampers become 
available, there is no need to use radioactives in warheads.  Macroscopic 
manipulation of the strong and weak forces allows so much neat stuff!!! You\'d
have to be able to manipulate both to stop all radioactivity.  So why not put
a lump of lead 208 in the warhead, which is non-radioactive, but getting up in 
that range where nothing is stable.  Flip on the nuclear damper (properly tuned
of course) and suddenly, lead 208 decays by spontaneous fission with a halflife
of a microsecond.  You have an instant nuke, no messy triggers, and you don\'t
even need a chain reaction because the whole reaction mass is coaxed into
fissioning all at once.

Does anything in the canon say anything about this?  I don\'t know much of the
background, I\'ve only been playing trav for 5 years :)

you might even do something like this in reactors (fission or fusion) so long
as the power required by the nuclear damper was less than that produced in the
reaction.

Why would you want to self-destruct your ship?

Except that if self-destruct mechanisms were a common feature of warships, 
boarding stricken warships would be an extremely under-utilised tactic. The 
most common tactic would be to keep firing on the thing until it was 
completely destroyed.

The only other reason that I can think of is to stop technology falling into 
enemy hands. Except that this assumes two things:

1. the enemy\'s espionage network is rubbish.
2. the item has not already been destroyed in the battle.

Alternatively explode a shaped charge in the ship\'s missile magazine - or 
just set fire to the magazine (think about HMS Argonaut in the Falklands 
war). That\'d do it every time.

Modern warships don\'t carry dedicated self-destruct mechanisms (at least not 
in the Royal Navy) - and I personally would not have been happy living on 
board one that did. Also, modern warships are too cramped to allow space to 
be taken up by something that would (hopefully) never be used.

Back in the mid 80\'s I had a Ref run an absolutely incredible adaptation of
the short story "The Way of Cross And Dragon"  by, forgive my memory, John M.
Ford or George R.R. Martin (both no strangers to Traveller).  Each of us
played retainers and crewmembers to a Knight empowered by her holiness the
Pope to root out heresies.

The original story involves an idyllic planet swept by a novel form of
Catholicism that elevates Judas to sainthood(!) with a mythic retelling of
his life that resonates with the natives on a fundamental level.  In this
alternate version Judas becomes the master of Earth\'s dragons and is
eventually tested by his conflicting love for them and devotion to Christ.
 His tale of revenge, triumph, defeat, and redemption is so beautiful and
moving that you genuinely wish it were true, and that\'s the lynchpin of the
story: the entire heresy has been carefully manufactured to appeal to the
natives and advance the agenda of an underground movement.

The Ref did a masterful job of bringing the story alive.  The first act had
us researching the details of the heretics canon and manuevering through the
politics of the church administration.  The second act involved the footwork
needed to prove the heresy false (the planetary database was filled with
"facts" supporting it), discover it\'s origins, and expose the perpetrators.
 The final act was the physical and theological confrontation with the rather
noble founders of the heresy.  The adventure worked on so many levels that I
still remember it fondly nearly a decade later.

Since then I\'ve always thought that a campaign built around the activities of
the church in the Imperium would be a blast.  If you happen to run across the
story you\'ll see almost immediately how easy it would be to translate into
the classic universe.  I\'ve even wondered if it\'s possible that it *started*
as a Traveller adventure considering the two potential authors familiarity
with the game.

Cordially,
MM

PS- Pick up Martin\'s "Tuf Voyaging" for some great adventure fiction filled
with game ideas.  When I read it I thought he\'d set it in the Traveller
universe and just filed off the serial numbers

Actually, Pu was discovered before the first atomic bomb was exploded, and
was used in the bomb dropped on Nagasaki (and just about every nuclear bomb
since).  I think LiH was used in most fusion bombs.  I don\'t know what is
in neutron bombs, although there used to be more information about research
with Co and Sr-90 than seems to exist now. :-)

this subject!

EMERGENCY LOW BERTHS

The original rules are as follows:
"Emergency low berths weigh 1 ton and cost Cr 100,000; each contains four
persons, all of whom share the survival roll. Emergency low berths cannot hold
the frozen watch. An emergency low berth can hold one concious person
(functioning as the equivalent of a couch) for several hours at a time."
(_Book 5: High Guard_, Marc Miller, GDW, 1980, USA, p 34)

The same rule can be found in _Book 2: Starships_, GDW, 1977, 1981, USA, p
14.

The original survival roll was 5+ on 2D6 - a 4 in 12 (33%) chance of death! Even
a medic could only reduce this to 3 in 12 (25%)!

_High Guard_ did not change this ruling, so the frozen watch was in a bad way.

MT modified it to increase survival, since many people had pointed out that the
high chance of death would cripple the concept of the frozen watch; one, no-one
would volunteer; two, you could only get so many of your personnel back!

The MT rules are:
"To survive a low passage voyage: Routine, Medical, Edu, 1 min. (Fateful)
Referee: the Medical and Edu are those of the attending physician at the time of
deberthing, not those of the character at risk.
Various effects occur for any mishap (roll 2D):
Superficial Mishap: the subject temporarily suffers 1D wounds for 1-6 days,
after which healing is automatic; skin loses some of its tone and colour for
1-6
weeks, having a gray, wrinkled appearance.
Minor Mishap: the subject temporarily suffers 2D wounds for 1-6 days, after
which healing is automatic; subject experiences motor function problems for
1-6
weeks with corresponding loss of 2 points of Dex during that time.
Major Mishap: the subject suffers 3D permanent wounds; the subject\'s internal
organs are damaged; and the subject must undergo medical diagnosis and
treatment
to restore full health.
Destroyed: not possible on a 2D mishap."
(_Imperial Encyclopedia_, Marc W. Miller, GDW, 1987, USA, p 87)

An entire article is devoted to the subject in_The Traveller\'s Digest_ #21.
The
article covers:
- active hibernation (via chill berth);
- passive hibernation (via fast drug);
- freezing (cold berth)
- use of low berths (including the low lottery, emergency low berths, the
frozen
  watch, medical cold berths, and livestock cold berths);
- low berths and space transportation;
- suspended animation and society (including "Timer Clubs").

The salient points covering cold berths are:
- normal low berths freeze at a moderate rate, including scanning and mapping
the body, cooling sections and then quick-freezing the body;
- normal low berths thaw at a moderate rate, using the data gathered when
freezing the body to unfreeze it in a "precisely controlled pattern" (p 41);
- an emergency cold berth freezes very quickly and thaws very slowly. At TL
15,
one berth can freeze 4 adult humans "- fully-clothed and unprepared - within
60
seconds. To do this, it foregoes all preliminary steps, trading ease of entry
for a lengthy and difficult revival process" (p 41);
- the frozen watch is frozen very slowly and thawed very quickly. They are
frozen over a 3 hour period (at TL 15), identifying and fixing all potential
thawing problems in advance. They are unfrozen rapidly "without the careful
monitoring and adjusting" (p 41) of normal low berths, and are capable of
action
in 5 minutes.

The mention of "Timer Clubs" (where people would be revived every 10, 25, or
50
years) paved the way for GDW to allow "remnants" into the TNE universe.

Finally, the chance of a survival mishap was increased:
"To revive a low berth passenger without incident: Difficult, Medical, Edu,
[time varies], (unskilled OK, fateful)
Referee: the Medical and Edu are those of the medic attending at the time of
revival."
Time increments are given in a table, and an expanded list of mishap results
is
included.

I made an error in my previous post. I said:

> or just set fire to the magazine (think about HMS Argonaut in the 
Falklands war).

In actual fact, I meant HMS Antelope. Both ships were struck by bombs during 
the air attacks of 23 May 1982 and both were moved into San Carlos Water 
where attempts were made to defuse the bombs.

The bombs on HMS Argonaut were successfully defused. One of the bombs on HMS 
Antelope went off, killing one of the bomb-disposal men and starting a fire 
in the machine spaces in the stern of the ship.
The fire raged out of control while the ship\'s company were abandoning ship. 
By lucky chance, the last of the ship\'s company had left the ship ten 
minutes before the fire set off the Seacat (SAM) missiles in the after 
ready-use magazine. This was the spectacular picture which was transmitted 
around the world.
The fires eventually reached the other bomb the next day (24th May) and 
detonated that, blowing the ship in half and sinking her.

Sorry about that, but it was 13 years ago and memories are imprecise.

How do you explain psionics? Is there something canonical
anywhere? I\'ve never seen it, but then again, I\'ve only
played Traveller since 1987 :-) Every little gadget or
technology has been detailed in Traveller, except for
psionics, it seems. But it would be nice to have an idea
about how it works.

How about psionics working via sub-atomic particles
called psions? :-) They probably don\'t have any mass,
moves at the speed of light and can be controlled by the
mind.

Thus telepathy would be an exchange of psions containing
information; telekinesis would be remote manipulation of
object via psions; teleportation would be the conversion
of oneself into psions, which are then moved to another
place and converted back again; claivonyance could be
something like a psion-based radar: You send out psions
to a specific place, and they return with information;
awareness is simply manipulation of one\'s own body with
psions.

Is this far out? Maybe, but how do you explain psionics?
These are just some thougts - I\'m open for better
explanations. It\'s just nice to know things like, how fast do
psionics work? If you do clairvoyance on a ship in orbit,
will there be a delay?

With psions moving at lightspeed, psionics won\'t be
possible/practical at interplanetary (let alone interstellar)
distances. This is - I *think* - in accordance with canon. It
seems like I once read somewhere, that psionics couldn\'t
be used at interplanetary distances, but I don\'t really
remember.

Comments, anyone?

Umm...  Missed it by THAT much!

There are 36 possible results in a 2d6 roll.  There are 6 and only
6 ways to roll a 4 or less.  So the chance of getting 4- on the roll
is 16.667%.

There are 3 and only 3 ways to roll a 3 or less, so the chance for that
is 8.333%.

Remember, rolling multiple dice produces a nonlinear probability curve for results.

(Still, I don\'t like *those* odds, either)

H-bomb would use a laser to start the reaction, and with gravitic
technology to contain the reaction long enough, you get an H-bomb with
no heavy isotopes to clean up.  One side effect of this method of
H-bombing is that nearly all of the radiation emitted will be hard gamma

Three of these appeared in analog, the first as a two part, the rest as singles. I picked up a 
few years ago a copy of Tuf Voyaging (George R.R. Martin is the author btw) that had 
these stories plus a couple of other. I\'ve seen it at  Used bookstores and in regular stores 
as well. I think it was a Baen Book, but am not sure about that. It was a very ead, well 
worth the $$ even with the repeated material. The other material is new stories that occur 
between visits to the refit planet.

BTW, I used the refit planet (whose name I forget) as a basis for a planet in an old traveller 
campaign. It worked out great as my players were consistently needing not only repairs 
but upgrades as well.

written by George R.R. Martin and are set within his Traveller-like universe.

"Tuf Voyaging" - An anthology of seven short stories all dealing with the 
                 adventures of Haviland Tuf aboard his starship "Ark".
                 [In the hardcover edition a sequel is mentioned as being 
                 in the works, but has still not appeared after several 
                 years.]


"Dying of the Light" - Novel set upon a rogue planet (Worlorn) and deals 
                       with the interactions of members of several alien 
                       human cultures. This book gives an indepth view of 
                       the  culture and customs that evolved on 
                       High Kavalaan during its era as a lost colony.
 
"Nightflyers" - An anthology with the primary story set aboard a cybernetic 
                starship of the same name. This particular story was made 
                into a movie. Another Traveller like story in this 
                anthology is "And Seven Times Never Kill Man" - Great 
                short story that deals with a small colony of 
                Steel Angels ( a quasi-religious movement advocating 
                Human Supremacy over all other life-forms...sound 
                familiar???). 

"Portraits of His Children" - Anthology with the following Traveller stories:
                              "With Morning Comes Mistfall" - One of the 
                              best, mainly because I am in this story.  =)
                              This particular short story strongly 
                              reminded me of the Keith brothers 
                              adventure, "Ascent to Anekthor". "The Glass 
                              Flower" - This story deals with a legendary 
                              figure within Martins universe, a cyborg named 
                              Kleronomas, who was instrumental in ending 
                              the Interregnum that followed the Collapse.

"A Song for Lya" - Another anthology. "Override" is set on the planet 
                   Grotto, and involves the happenings of a small swirlstone 
                   prosprctor. "The Hero" - This story is takes place 
                   during the Federal Empire, just prior to the Collapse.
                   It involves the "early retirement" of a soldier from the 
                   war-world Wellington. "A Song for Lya" - Post 
                   Collapse, set on the world Shkeen. Deals with a pair of 
                   psionic "Talents" (trouble-shooters) and their encounter 
                   with an alien "god".

"Windhaven" -  A novel, coauthored with Lisa Tuttle and my personal favorite 
               after "Tuf Voyaging". The setting for this novel is on  
               Windhaven, a low gravity, dense atmosphere waterworld that is
               home to a lost colony of humans who survived the crash 
               landing of their \'generation\' starship. The story revolves 
               around the Flyers Guild, a caste that binds the scattered 
               island outposts of Windhaven together.
               


Placing Martin\'s Universe within Traveller.

A careful reading of Martins work shows that the planets in his 
universe lay rimward of Terra, in an area that he calls the "Fringe". In 
Martins own words, "...the starchats of the Fringe, that scattering of 
thinly settled worlds between the smoke-dark gasses of the Tempter\'s Veil 
and the Great Black Sea itself."  Some of his worlds are set on the 
coreward edge of the Tempter\'s Veil (which is a dark nebula/rift). One 
world, Tober-in-the-Veil, lies within the nebula/rift itself. Most however, 
are located in the Fringe proper. The extreme rimward edge of the Fringe 
is also known as the Last Stars, and these worlds stand sentinel over the 
intergalatic void, the Great Black Sea.

Somewhere, I have compiled "Library Data" for all of Matrin\'s Universe. 
If anyone is interested in obtaining a copy, let me know. I hope some 
have found this post interesting =)

since I was writing a GNU C++ program to find the effective
performance of the various units in a way not influenced by
human factors or chance.

The program implements MT ground cbt rules. The environment was a desertic 
one, without forests, broken ground etc. With this program I ran 1000
simulated battles at the battalion level and 600 at the brigade level.
Each battalion sized cbt group fought 400 battles, each brigade 300
battles. The Gamma Fast Armoured cbt grp is a version of the Gamma
Armoured Cbt Grp equipped with CGTs rather than MBTs.

No Meson Gun Boats were used.

The results are the following:

Battalion level:
                    Cost      Victories      Mean Loss      Victories/Gcr
Delta Cav. sqdn:  3494 Mcr      304       2.1 Gcr/battle       87.0
Gamma Armoured:   3610 Mcr      279       1.7 Gcr/battle       77.3
Gamma Fast Arm.:  3610 Mcr      230       2.5 Gcr/battle       63.7
Beta (3 grps):    3780 Mcr      157       2.5 Gcr/battle       41.5 
Gamma Mechan.:    2520 Mcr       30       2.2 Gcr/battle       11.9

It is interesting to note that in the simulations run by players the
Gamma Mechanized grp has actually defeated both the Delta cav sqdn and
the Gamma Armoured grp.

Brigade level:
               Cost      Victories      Mean Loss       Victories/Gcr
Delta rgt:  10482 Mcr       245        7.8 Gcr/battle     23.4
Gamma bde:   8984 Mcr       236        5.7 Gcr/battle     26.3
Beta bde*2:  9270 Mcr        78        8.4 Gcr/battle      8.4
Alpha bde:   7810 Mcr        41        6.7 Gcr/battle      5.2

It would seem that the "standard" 57th century NATO units (e.g. the
Gamma bde and the Delta rgt) are superior both in terms of absolute
effectiveness and in terms of cost effectiveness to the other units.
One should note, however, that both Beta and Alpha were effectively
mechanized units with a significantly smaller ratio of tanks to
infantry. It is possible that they would be much more effective in a
non desertic environment. This is also shown by the ineffectiveness of
the Gamma Mechanized cbt grp compared to the other battalions.

Note also the enormous losses experienced by all units.

The combat simulation program allows one to specify the defensive 
attitude for each single platoon level unit. 

To explore the effect of changing this factor I have run another 1900 
engagements at the battalion level and 300 at the brigade level.

It turns out that extreme behaviour (ie very defensive or very aggressive) 
appears more convenient than intermediate behaviour. In addition very 
aggressive attitudes seem to be the most convenient for all unit types.

The most remarkable effect of this change of attitude is on
the Beta bde. Both at the combat group level and at the
(double) brigade level, Beta gains enormously in effectiveness.

The Beta bde when moving aggressively is equivalent to the Gamma
bde (also moving aggressively) and beats any other brigade.

Moreover all unit types in offensive attitude appear to be able to beat any 
other type in non offensive attitude.

Now comments like the foregoing don\'t really help further 
the development of interstellar society, do they?

Seriously though, what do you do when you get home from
another crazy day at Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and your
partner has left you the following email:  "I\'ve invited
the new writer and spouses (the Gvaekneuerrs, you remember,
we just hired Vengue) out for dinner tonight -- meet first
for drinks at our place at 19:30 -- please pick a
restaurant and make reservations -- xxOO see you soon"?

Well, vegetarian restaurants are right out, of course.  In
fact, the Vargr metabolism requires ingestion of fairly
raw red meat on a regular basis, so perhaps the Original
Melharris [sorry SF joke] [no, San Francisco, not science
fiction] is in order. 

But first, what about those drinks at 7:30?  I wouldn\'t
recommend serving anything in champagne flutes or little
cordial glasses. While Mr & Mrs & Mr & Whatever
Gvaekneuerr can certainly stick their tongues down to the
bottom of a narrow glass, they\'ll probably be more
comfortable with a broader lapping surface, like, well,
like a bowl.  Maybe those little celadon soup bowls or the 
ceramic cha cups will do.

Ok, what do Vargr drink?  We should serve some
non-alcoholic beverages as well as cocktails.  You can\'t
go wrong with water, but it\'s boring.  Will they have
problems with bubbles going up their snouts if you serve
something carbonated?  Are they lactose-intolerant?  Maybe
you should just ask the meat department at the grocery
store for a few pints of fresh blood.  (Gvurrdon Bloody
Marys are the an initiation drink in certain elite Imperial
Marine regiments -- a treat for the Vargr recruits, but
bloody awful for the humans.) 

Alcohol is another problem.  We know that canines will get
drunk (a chihuaha once consumed a huge tequila sunrise that
my friend had put on the floor by his chair -- after
staggering around and making a few odd noises, the dog
threw up violently and went to sleep).  England\'s
beer-drinking dogs are famous, too.  So maybe you should
get some dark beer and skip the tequila.  Will nitrites in
the wine be a problem?

The Gvaekneuerrs arrive and are very nice and lap up their
MHD Plasma (locally microbrewed, of course) with gusto. Did
you cover your good fabrics with plastic? -- some
splashing is likely to have occurred.  Maybe 57th Century
cleaning technology can handle it.  The real reason that
Vargr wear shoes is probably to protect the furniture from
their sharp nails (how many times have your mothers told
you, "now put your shoes on before you start running
around in the house"?)

After a pleasant hour of "Oh, yes, I did smuggle that red
rock home from Mars when we went there on vacation 15
years ago -- I hope there weren\'t any microorganisms on
it," and "Gryess, thrat\'s rour rold hrouse ron Rrrejrina,
rin thra Sprinrrrd Mrarchres", your taxi arrives and
whisks you to Original Melharris.

Vengue Gvaekneuerr orders a raw rack of lamb:  "You meant 
underdone, sir?" "Nro, dron\'t cookr it at rall -- jrust 
warm it rup a rittle."  When it arrives, Vengue eschews knife 
and fork and zestfully tears strips of meat from the bone, 
chewing (as he must) with his mouth at least partially 
open.  He probably learned when he was a pup not to shake 
his meat to make sure that it was dead.  

What about the chicken samosa appetizers?  I think that you
and the Gvaekneuerrs will both eat them by hand in quick
bites.  The arugula and tomatillo salad (this is San
Francisco, after all): probably with forks at a human
restaurant, but at home, probably slurped up with their
tongues.  The prawn and coconut milk soup?  Slurrp!  I\'ll
bet the staff at Melharris gave them and you lobster
napkins, even if nobody ordered lobster.

Lobster?  They\'d probably use the tools to break open the
carapace, but their fingernails are a lot easier to work
with.  

Dessert:  Flan and mousse could be problems if they
can\'t handle lactose.  Non-dairy ice cream? easy to eat
(slurrp!).  Apple pie (our dogs always tried to steal some
of mom\'s apple pie): maybe with a fork.

Wine with dinner?  Better have it in goblets.  Coffee 
after?  Vargr probably can deal with hot liquids as well as 
we can.  Brandy in a snifter?  "Snriftrers mrust\'ve breen 
invrented by Vrargr -- threy frocus the rexperience rin 
thra nrose.  Mmmmrrmrm."

Then how about a nightcap and dancing at one of the clubs
floating over the San Francisco Bay?  It\'s still only 1
meter deep in places after thousands of years of dumping
stuff into it, but it\'s being dredged out?  Vengue has
had a few drinks by now, so he might very well roll down
the window and enjoy the smells of a big city at night --
this could lead to a severe allergic reaction if the wrong
plants are in bloom.  Cab drivers have seen it all, so no
rude comments will be made.

Even after several more nightcaps, however, the Gvaekeuerrs 
won\'t be drinking from the facilities.  In fact, as your 
partner learns at the firm\'s New Year party, the Vargr 
ability to throw up easily and return to the table feeling 
none the worse for wear makes the new colleague a 
formidable adversary at drinking contests.

                             ABOUT CHVIEW

For as long our species has gazed into the night sky, we have been awed by
the vision of countless stars.  Having now deduced that stars are radiant
suns like our own, many cannot help but imagine what we might find if we
traveled to those faraway, unknown places.  With no means of interstellar
travel today, we can only dream that our descendants will.

[This Beta-test, WINDOWS-based version of] CHVIEW is intended as a three-
dimensional aid to:  viewing some of the nearer stars of our galaxy;
navigating the distances and gravity "gradients" between them;  accessing
basic information (and updating what we know); and, hopefully, having some
fun.  The current data file provides about 2,600 known stars within 100
light-years of Earth.  Future plans include modules for selecting a star
(or multiple star system) and, based on available data and known
astronomical relationships, for creating your own star system (of planets,
moons, asteroids, Kuiper belt, Oort cloud/cometary halo, and even human
colonies or space communities), for voyaging in faster-than-light (FTL)
"starships", and the like.

CHVIEW is brought to you by Jo Grant and Ben Lin with the assistance of
other subscribers of the CHERRYHLIST discussion group at
JAYMIN@MATHS.TCD.IE.  While some of us have been collecting star data for
years, all of us are fans of the Hugo-winning author, C.J. Cherryh, who has
developed an intriguing scenario for human colonization of our neighboring
stars.  As you may guessed, the name "CHVIEW" is a tribute to her.
Depending on where you obtained this copy of CHVIEW, in fact, some of the
"Place Names" assigned to selected stars may be the names of Cherryh\'s
fictional human colonies -- easily changed to suit your fancy.

True, leaving out the fission bomb saves you from creating fission-byproducts
which are usually very "dirty", but a fusion reaction creates *lots* of fast
Neutrons as well as Gamma rays (rememebr the proposed Neutron Bomb...). Like
the
GR, these too are lethal but short lived, though stopped more easily than GR
--
but unlike GR, they can transform other nucleii when they collide, leaving
radioactive elements to decay later.

In addition, some of the fusion products may be unstable and decay after the
explosion...

I\'ve always assumed that if the power plant can output the huge number of
Watts required to tear a ship out of this space into jump space (stored in
jump capacitors or whatever) then if this energy were released in an
uncontrolled manner (and quickly) a large explosion would result. Given the
armoured nature of a ship\'s hull, the majority of the blast would initially
be concentrated within the ship, presumably vaporising most of the contents?

That\'s a pretty good way of ensuring a ship can\'t be used by the enemy. It
doesn\'t make a big explosion outside though, even if the hull ruptures. Then
again, if the danger space for a mere shipboard laser is 50m, perhaps one
could (just for the Hell of it) expand that up by comparing the laser power
with the total output power of the plant? Then say halve it to allow for the
reduction due to hull containment. This would give a very rough estimate of
a ship\'s destructive capability.

HYDROGEN + OXYGEN + LIGHTED SPLINT = POP!

A number of people have discussed the explosive capability of the power
plant itself. I haven\'t yet heard mention of the inherent lethality of
escaping hydrogen fuel being ignited. I once calculated that if the \'small\'
amount of fuel carried on a scout ship were allowed to escape such that it
expanded into hydrogen gas in a uniform density (standard atmospheric
pressure) cloud, this cloud, once ignited would create a _huge_ fireball -
sufficient to make an AD&D mage wimper and go home in the realisation that
real life can out-zap magic any day of the week!!!

WHY DO IT?

My players have mined their ship (dontya just luuuv Claymores...), but only
to the degree of providing internal kill zones against hijackers. The
relative worth of the ship means that none of them would ever dream of
blowing themselves up.

So why install such a system. Can you ever have enough fail safes? Would you
go on a ship which (in the 50th century) has such complex s/w that only the
semi-AI robots that wrote it can understand it? And one false bit
transmitted, one RF glitch... the error handler that forgets to tell you the
4-out-of-5 decision-making computers for the self-destruct have just gone
off line, leaving the notoriously unreliable number 5 in charge... hey Mr.
Virus pay _me_ a visit!

What happens when the enemy ship\'s laser gets that one lucky shot?

Actually many new generation military planes are either marginally stable
or inherently unstable and I\'d rather trust of complex program on one of
them. Consider also that most programs that all of us use today are in a 
certain way so complex that we do not understand them.... In fact we use 
high level languages and some semi-AI robot = ..the compiler.. translates 
them into the "real" program. As the level of languages gets higher you 
might tell the "compiler" or whatever "blast them!". Actually the 
compiler undeestands them better than we do, detecting problems and
optimizing them better than a human could do.

My feeling is that starships computers that have to be trusted to run
the jump drive can certainly also be trusted for anything else.

Concerning Andy\'s idea of hydrogen chemical ignition, I think that we are
sadly facing again the ten years old issue of fusion power in MT: nuclear
energy should be one million times more efficient than chemical and it
is only 1000 times (give or take some factors). Any inefficient way
of blowing up your fusion reactor would likely produce much more energy
than any chemical explosion in real life, not necessarily so in Traveller..


                                 Max

P.S. chemical ignition of H also requires O, few scoutships carry
around hundred tons of oxygen...

Um .... semi-AI ? Sorry not the compilers that I have to write.
there just lexacal analisers, pharse trees, and code generation, with

Replace better above with quicker, if humans write it, humans can

No but they do carry a large volume of it, and just think of the oxygen
storred not just in air .... but then I\'m not a chemist, I\'m a Computer
Scientest.

This is just a message saying that even in Traveller Times, computers
are programed by Humans, Aslan, Zho\'s etc etc .... and if it has to
be programed by someone, it can\'t be as good as that someone. Even if you
use design software, someone had to program the design software ....

What follows may be dangerous for your health unless you like computers

----

Concerning fault tolerance, How does that disagrees with what I said?
you want your computer system to be realiable..

Of course by calling compilers semi-AI  I was (half) joking.. To me 
saying " a *= b->c(); " or "blast that fu..g Vargr " is just a qualitative
difference. One wants computers to do more and more difficult things.
If you call  Prolog a language for AI applications then my optimizing
compiler is at least semi-AI. If you don\'t...you are excused...

Concerning what AI is.., my congratulations, you are the One who knows
what it really is... As you certainly know more than I do, in the last years
so many approaches have been tried (expert systems with euristics, 
neural networks, perceptrons, something else I do not know about, etc) with, 
to my view from the outside, so little success that I would not be that 
optimistic..We have a Connection Machine that is used by a dozen computer 
scientists working at their thesis every year and their end-product is 
often little more than their degree...(unfortunately for me, I was in
charge of reviewing their CPU time applications..)

Some friends (computer scientists themselves) are working on new
generations of compilers for Camel and similar functional  languages, 
with the goal to have syntactic correctness implying also semantic
correctness. May be that would not be real AI but would be quite
a step forward, well deserving the semi-AI name, and hopefully by
the 57th century...

Finally, I officially challenge you to write machine language code more
efficiently than current compilers on Risc CPUs (e.g. IBM POWER2)...
there are so many criteria involved in optimizing on such cpus that
of the many people I know who have tried none have succeeded. Of course 
you can understand what is doing and, may be, even guess why some 
instruction sequence  gets executed in one machine cycle and some other 
not (if you know the details of the CPU..). Real compilers are pretty 
damn "smart", although, of course, if you want to optimize better than 
many (tempted to say all..) compilers on  the PC market you can do it 
standing on one leg after  four martinis .. 
I would tend to agree with you that the compiler does not anything more 
than you told him, as I sadly found out when programming the above
mentioned Connection Machine..BUT faster IS better, if the speed difference
is factors of one thousand or more.

          Cheers, Max

But _hydrogen_ (one proton, one electron) fusion doesn\'t produce
neutrons, only fusion involving dueterium (hydrogen plus one neutron) or
tritium (hydrogen plus two neutrons - inherently unstable) does that. 
Depending on the ability to force pure hydrogen fusion you assume, you
could get a really "clean" nuke.  Right now, the only way we can get
fusion (even in H-bombs) is to use lots of tritium and dueterium.  By TL

Mega Trav and TNE state that you have to place three computers on your ship,
for backup, if one gets killed you go to the next, this is a poor view of
computers used for flying at the mo. I\'ve always played that the three
main computers are doing a fault tolarence job, all running at the same time
and comparing results, the majority vote wins, and gets implemented. Just
like systems today. The reasons there is fault tolerance today, is because
computers are inherently unreliable, and software is inherently unreliable.
If you trusted just one computer a bit error could mean death, or lots of
money lost in companies. Two fault tolerance systems (each with three or more
machines) running different software which produce the same result. The point
I was making is that even fault tolerance systems aren\'t completly reliable,
although in Trav times this will be improved a lot, but how reliable do you
have to be when doing a jump .... when bit errors, or imperfect fuel cause
misjumps at best, and death at worst, that\'s even if you return to normal
space.

> " a *= b->c(); " or "blast that fu..g Vargr "

a*=b->c() is clearly defined, as it is derived from maths, and the language
you are programming in, while Language (spocken ie English) is not. Dose the
above statement mean :- kill the Vargr, play load music at the Vargr, kill
the Vargr who is engaging in the act of, as opposed to the Vargr standing
next to him who is not .... Is the person just swearing at the Vargar, or is
the statment a command for the computer to exicute the Vargr, etc etc etc etc

... this is a massive qulitative difference to a computer, there is not a
computer at the moment which can make this distinktion. In Traveller times
they will be better at it, having had three thousand year of practice, but
will probably still not be perfect ....

There is no absolute definition of AI, and probably never will be. What I am
studying is not Intellegence that is Artificial. I am not studdying machines
or computers built by us that are capable of free thought or action. AI at
the mo is Knowledged based systems, connectionisum, vision, etc etc. But
this is not "Artificial Intellegence" this is AI. To but this in Traveller
terms the Virus, or the chips on Cyberline (?) are not AI they are
Natural Intellegence. To say they are AI would be like saying the Vargr are
K9 Intellegent. The life form that was found, was naturally occuring in it\'s
own enviroment, it just happened to look and behave like a human built
computer, so GDW call it AI (not that it wasn\'t helped by pure silicon). If
people think that the original chip were not capable of intelegence without
outside help (ie pure silicon) try feeding one lab rat proteen, and another
no proteen, and see which reaches the potentioal of the rat spechies (just a
rough analogy).

Right back to compilers .... if someone rights the compiler in machine code,
that person is at least as good, and most probably better at writing machine
code than the compiler stop. Software can never be better than the people
who write it, because they write it. If the best compiler writer in the
world wrote a compiler, he could still improve it .... therefore it could
not be as good as the writer .... therefore then computer is not as good
as the person at writing machine code .... stop. I`m not saying I\'m better,
but the person who wrote the compiler is. This would also apply in
Traveller, the computer is only as good as it\'s software, and someone has to
write that software, so the software is not as good as the person who wrote
it, because the software can be improved.

Perhaps an interesting idea could be to rewrite MT rules regarding computers.
I think a rewrite could include things like:

* Nanotechnology

* Parallelism

* Artificially Intelligent Adaptive systems

* Computer weights and power usage that is more of picture of the future than
a picture of the past.

* Deckers and rules for using decks.

* Computer security and Computer Warfare.

* Rules for computer operation of remote vehicles.

* Fast generation of a complete computer system for specific types of ships.

* Differences in computer technology for Alien cultures.

Hi:

I want to respond to a few of the issues that were raised in this discussion.

This is long, anyone not interested in the AI discussion, should skip this.


1. What is AI? Historically, AI is the term that refers to a set of
research that started a while back to in effect create an artificial brain.

These days AI has broken up into fields which attempt to find what people
to believe to be subprocesses in this field such as:

Vision or Image Processing
Natural Language Recognition
Planning
Deduction and Reasoning
Learning

2. A compiler is semi-AI? I really don\'t know what semi-AI means. I can tell
you that compiler technology evolved out of AI research. Back in the 50\'s
when people were using punchcards and machine language to program (1\'s and
0\'s
or just numbers), compilers would have looked like AI technology because
it turned a set of instructions written in a language resembling English
into a language that could be processed by a machine.

However, since higher-level programming (with languages) is now the most
popular way to program, this technology does not appear to be AI.

This is another point about AI. AI has also come to characterize any
sufficiently advanced technology which appears to be taking human intent and
 converting into something that can be processed by a CPU.

3. The computer is only as good as the programs that run on it: This is
true to a certain point. Any program that can be written for a particular
CPU can with sufficiently advanced technology be turned into a chip to
be installed on that computer. That means that if someone managed to come
up with a way for a program to learn, interact with its environment,
and hypothesize new information, then this would be a good example of an AI.
Given a sufficiently advanced technology, this AI could be turned into a chip
or even a CPU itself. So then maybe some company comes up with this chip
and markets it. Each AI can then take on a different "personality" given
a different environment.

The problem is that creating this software is a very difficult thing. Lets
take for example, the brain of a mouse.   This brain has to do the following:
* Manage sensors (nerves)
* Control glands and muscles
* Manage nesting instincts
* React to fear, hunger, pain
* Adapt to new situations and environments
The mouse brain has to do each of these in parallel and in real-time.

AI software today is nowhere near the above model. In addition, any
canonical AI type of operation takes many resources to complete.

Now given 3000 years, things may change. There might even be a new invention
which makes things alot easier.

I am planning to clean up a bit the software and make it  (quickly) available

The units are not hardcoded (although the format is not very user friendly)

The desertic environment has been chosen to simply the program, it would be

Hope you don\'t mind me chopping off your suggestions, but I just wanted
to save on some bandwidth.

Anyway, the answer to this question was answered in one of the issues
of either the Traveller\'s Digest or the Megatraveller\'s Journal.  I
can\'t remember which issue off the top of my head.  If someone reminds
me, I\'ll try to dig up the exact issue this weekend when I hit home and
let you all know.

The gist.  A ship inside another ship should automatically be assumed
to be within a 10 diameter sphere.  Thus it should automatically
misjump.  Yes, a tiny ship theoretically does create enough of a
gravity for itself that anything inside of it can be assumed to be
within 10 diameters.

A ship trying to jump from inside a ship which is in jump will be
destroyed.  I think that DGP stated as their logic that somewhere
way-back-when (TM) Marc Miller said that it couldn\'t be done because of
the way jump-physics worked.  A nice GM might just have the jump drive
melt itself or something instead of everyone becoming instant toast.

Hope this helps.

I found this interesting in that a number of previous posts have said that
canon required jumps to be to/from certain gravity densities, i.e. Jump 1
could only jump to the largest gravity well within a system, Jump 2 could
choose that or the next largest gravity well, etc.

Yet the ship-in-ship declaration seems to say the gravity of a single ship
is sufficient to upset jump and, therefore by extrapolation, sufficient to
act as a jump-to point?

I this a contradiction? Personally, I allow anyone to jump from anywhere to
anywhere else, it\'s just that misjumps are most likely to occur the higher
the gravity effects. And yes, in my game the ship inside would cause damage
to the surrounding ship but only to the edges of the inner ship\'s jump
field. It\'s a bit like the teleport-in scenes from the Terminator movies -
i.e. everything in the Jump field (T1/2 = sphere) is lost out to the exact
perimeter of the field.

        I\'d rather see the "10 Diameter/100 Diameter Rule" replaced by a
certain 
curvature of space, i.e. gravity level. I\'d simply assume the 10 Diameter
rule 
was a rule of thumb based on Earth, so the first critical gravity level is
1/100 
G, or 0.098m/s/s. Then 100 Diameters would be 1/10,000 G, or 0.00098 m/s/s.
Then 
it doesn\'t matter what size the body is. I mean, why would the danger
distance 
be the same for our moon, with a (surface) gravity of 1/6G, and for a neutron

star the same size, with a mass and hence (surface) gravity _significantly_ 
higher?

I think this is a great idea. However, I have always held that "decking" is
just hacking with a different interface. In my GURP Cyberpunk campaign, the
same rules cover hackers whether they use terminals or cyberdecks - a
cyberdeck is really just a computer with a neural interface and OS. Hence I
think that the above is actually one and the same category.

The jump-in-jump statement stems from an article in an
OLD issue of Challenge, where Marc Miller eleborates on
the principles of jump space. In this article, he gives an
overview of (Imperial) research to break the 6-parsec
barrier. This includes forcing and trying to control a
misjump and jumping from the insides of a ship in jump
space. The article states quite qlearly (as far as I
remember) that the jump-in-jump procedure is impossible.
Thus, according to canon, jumping from a ship in jump
space is not possible. As someone mentioned, I think
DGP eleborated on the topic (or a similar one) in SOM.

(The forcing of misjumps, BTW, has up until "now"
resulted in navigators being able to determine the direction
to travel but not the distance, or the distance but not the
direction.)

The ideas about jump-1 only being able to enter the largest
gravity well in the system, jump-2 also the next largest, etc.
is not canon. Do I remember correctly if I say that these
ideas where spawned by the discussion of the profitability
of Vargr corsairs?

Some of the topics mentioned here I have less than perfect
recall about, so please forgive (but correct) any mistakes.

Hi,

About a month ago I announced that my WWW pages would be down for a 
little while. Well, things turn out that they in fact migth not come 
back at all. Our site was hit by a hacker...

Nothing really harmfull for my pages in it self, but this particular 
hacker was of the pure evil breed. Apparently he installed a trojan 
horse type program that has trashed the harddiscs. At the moment we 
dont know if the data can be recovered. And ofcourse we dont have any 
backups... :(

It does however seem that the user volume is the least damaged so I 
still have hopes. It will probably take some time to get everything 
in order again.

I\'ll keep you posted on furteher developments...

first, the 100 diameter rule doesn\'t produce a constant g-field, even if
you consider bodies of equal desnity:

   planet mass          M = k R^3

   grav force on ship   g = G M / D^2 
                          = K R^3 / D^2

   so at jump dist, D = n R (n=10 or 100,...)

                        g = K R^3 / (n R)^2 
                          = K R / n^2

   which scales linearly, increasing as the world/sun size increases (K
differs for earth world, gas giant and suns but the scaling law is the
same...)

A grav intensity measure also ignores the g-force of the Galaxy as a
whole... we are all orbiting the centre of the Galaxy, remember!

What does have a constant, non-scaling value is the <rate of change of g
with distance>, the "flatness" of the g-field

   rate of change       dg/dD = -2 K R^3 / D^3     (differentiating...)

   at D=nR              dg/dD = -2 K R^3 / (nR)^3
                              = -2 K / n^3

the new formula shows that at the 10 radius and 100 radius jump distances,
the flatness of the g-field depends slightly on density (the K factor) and
hugely on the distance multiple 
The change in field gradient from 10 diams to 100 diams is 1000-fold!
The corrolary to that is that a doubling of density only shifts the 100 diams
to
126 diams

First, I just want to say that I got TTC #8 and your stuff was
fantastic!

But, if I remember correctly, the jumping into gravity wells is not
part of the Jump Institute\'s canon.  Jumping is not a method of travel
of going great distances as long as the entry and exit point have the
same gravitic densities.

Trying to be parsimonious, jump is entering jumpspace and coming out at
some other point a week later.  The only restrictions should be that
you should be 100 diameters out to jump safely, and you should be 100
diameters out just to be on the safe side when you arrive.  Misjumps
may (and will in some instances) occur if you don\'t meet some of the
safety criteria.

Hope this helps.

The only problem that I can see with this is that there is a limit on
how small jump drives can actually be.  Likewise, creating some type of
``message beamer\'\' from a planet will not work because the theoretical
jump emmiter that you would need would be within 100 diameters of the
planet.  This goes against the established jump-space theory/metaphysics.

One has to be careful about treating *artificial* gravity the same
as gravity generated by natural forces/objects, because the Laws of
SF Absurdity begin to rapidly take over.

Take, for example, A-G generated in deckplates aboard a starship.
Does the effect of the gravity generated by the internal deckplates 
extend beyond the hull?  (One would assume that 1G generated by a
grav-generator in the deck would reach as far as 1G generated by
the earths surface, no?)  If so, then space-walking crewmen will
experience 1G on the dorsel outer hull, but 0G on the ventral hull.

Or, what happens if we place a 1G grav-generator in both the floor
and ceiling of a corridor with a 3-meter vertical clearance?  Will
my head be pulled towards the ceiling while my feet stay firmly on
the floor?  Will the floor hold more attraction for my body until
I jump, at which point I \'fall\' to the ceiling?

I\'m currently co-refereeing the Traveller Mail-list PBEM with Mike
Metlay (who I sure many of you remember fondly).  Mike holds a Ph.D.
in high-energy physics and, after much discussion, this is how *we*
treat artifical gravity.

Artificial gravity is a closed field effect.  It falls off in direct
proportion to the strength of the generator and the \'shoulder\' of the
drop is modified by modulation/harmony interference of the gravity waves.
Spaceship/starship hulls are designed (deliberately) to behave like
inverted Gaussian surfaces WRT artifical gravity waves.  Specifically,
part of a ships internal gravitic system includes interference dampers
in the hull that prevent the ships internal AG from reach beyond the
hull.  This is necessary for safety reasons.  Imagine dozens, or even
hundreds of ship docked at a high port, all with their internal gravity
going 1G.  Re-enforcing the docking moorings to keep all the ships
stationary would be prohibitively expensive.  Add to that, the attraction
generated by the internal gravitics of the high port itself, and you\'ve
got one serious mess on your hands.

Gravitics, when used for propulsion (grav-cars, grav-bikes, et.al), are
even simpler, and the grav drive does nothing more than interfer with
the existing, natural gravity waves in the area.  A spacecraft gravitic
drive becomes less and less efficient as it moves further out of a star
systems gravity well (as documented in both the RM Ref. Man. and the
_Starship_Operators_Manual_).

As a result, two starships could be parked within 100 meters (or less)
of one another and either ship could jump successfully without being
influenced by the gravitics of the other ship.  As for one ship jumping
from *inside* the hold of another ship, I maintain that the result would
be fundementally the same as if the smaller ship tried to jump from a
starport launch-pit, while still planetside: disasterous.

I actually have always done the same and I think IT IS canon. I have seen 
many times in the rule the idea of jumping in open space both in CT (last 
one was on TCS [thanks Niko!]) and in MT (e.g. the Riftbreaker scoutship).

David J. Golden does not like the hundred diameter rule. I think the rule 
has two advatanges : 1- it is simple, 2- it makes physically sense.
In fact, due to the equivalence principle, it should not make any 
difference whether you are in a gravity well or accelerating the other way. 
If one introduces a rule saying that one cannot jump if the gravitational 
acceleration at the jump point is larger than some threshold than he 
should also require the ship not to accelerate faster than the same 
threshold for consistency. As I argued some time ago, the 100 diameters
rule when seen as a schematization of the tidal forces strength it 
actually makes a lot of sense (as long as all bodies can be approximated
as having the same density). The tidal force limit would change by 90 
per cent in terms of diameters when going from the Earth (as dense 
as you get for known planets) to Jupiter. Thus 100 diameters for 
Earthlike planets would be too conservative by a factor two for gas 
giants. 

The reason I like the tidal force constraint is that by  redefining your 
reference frame you  can always cancel the effect of any  gravitational 
acceleration but you cannot cancel out the tidal forces.

Note that some of these arguments are more general than general relativity
ie could be correct even if general relativity was wrong.

I recently purchased a book called _Combat Service Support Guide_, 2e, by MAJ
John E. Edwards (USA, Ret.), which seems to be a natural for anyone designing
a campaign.  It includes information on writing nuclear strike orders, 
prowords for radio communications (e.g., wilco, flash, etc.), the military 
decision making process, formulas for estimating ammunition/supply 
requirements for several types of supplies/units, map unit symbols, and much,
much more.  I bought it at a Borders bookstore, and it is easily worth the 
US$15 I paid for it.

Thought you might like to know.

Actually, according to the SOM, a body emerging from
jump space will *automatically* emerge at least 100
diameters from any mass. That means that you can\'t do a
dangerous jump *to* a point inside the 100 diameter sphere
of an object. You can, however, make dangerous jumps
by jumping *from* such a point.

Maybe according to SOM (I don\'t quite remember where I
read this, but I\'m pretty sure it\'s canon), you\'ll still have to
be outside 100 diameters of another starship to jump
safely. A starship also has mass (artificial gravity or no
artificial gravity) - they are even pretty dense.

Wasn\'t this question aswered in a Q&A in either TD or
MTJ? (one of the later I think)

How would you get a jump field bubble to close around
a non-physical thing? By TL 15, it can\'t be done.
Remember that instant matter transportation is not
impossible in Traveller, it\'s just first possible at *very* high
tech levels. In fact, the ability to construct matter trans
portals is a weighty factor of defining these high tech levels.

In the article by Marc Miller I mentioned in an earlier
message, he says that once TL 15 and jump-6 is reached
no further development of jump drive is possible, because
jump drive is sort of a very well-working mistake. The
principles of jump space does not allow jumps to be made
more than six parsecs in a week. They do allow for
instantaneous transport of matter from one end of the
galaxy to the other, though. Alas, the ability to do that first
occurs at TL 23 or something like that.

Actually, I used to be in a campaign where we did something similar to
this.  Our party was hired by a merchant company that had a huge J-6
rider (we used to jokingly call it a merchant rider).  Individual
shipowners would do runs for the company by going from their ship to
individual worlds.

The big appeal for this was for merchants that had ships that weren\'t
jump capable.  The company was basically paying for the ships to
deliver goods to specific clients.  Our jump drive had broken down so
we went to work for these clowns to make money (they paid you per ton
hauled and had bonuses too boot).

The merchant riders were basically jump drive and cargo space.  Crew of
the individual ships would bunk on their ships.

This reminds me a lot of the interstellar travel system in the _Dune_
books, where the individual Houses (and other organizations) owned and
operated their own sublight insystem craft and contracted with the

Actually, you\'re right, Mark.  I mis-spoke when I said a ship could
jump safely from such proximity to another ship.  Even though the
internal artificial gravity is prevented from "leaking out" of a
ship, the mass of the ship itself does produce a (very weak)
gravitational field that must be considered.  The 100-diameter rule
still applies.  (In this case, the 100-diameter rule would probably
be based on the long axis of the ship that *isn\'t* jumping.)

Hello everyone,

Does anyone here know if Signal-GK \'zine is available in Canada, or in the 
US?, if so where (address) and what is the latest issue.

I just borrowed Signal-GK 1 to 9 from a friend and really liked what I 
read.  Excellent zine from england.  I was wondering how much is a 
subscribtion to it and if they can be contacted by Email.

And one last thing, are there any Writing Guidelines for S-GK?

Re: LIMITERS ON JUMP

To those who asked about the "canon" of jumping to a particular
gravity well, I may have been the one who raised it (?!). It
was an idea - a *suggestion*, not "canon" - raised by Leroy
Guatney in "From Port To Jump-point", JTAS #23 (??). The
full details are in one of my an earlier postings.

In xboat #363, Mark Seemann wrote:

The ruling I remember is that a jump to a point inside a 100
diameter limit will *AUTOMATICALLY* "precipitate" the ship
out of j-spaces and back into n-space. My memory says that
this included "disasterous results" - probably akin to
the ship running into a brick wall.

I do remember the ruling that a ship has its own 100-diameter
limit 9just not the source). There was another, similar case
where one ship was tethered to another and misjumped when its
drive was activated (catastrophically). I *think* this was in
MT Journal #4, in the TAS news reports ??

As for the 100-diameter rule itself, I would say that the
"reason" for it is a GAME reason: any running from space
combat to a jump-point is meant to be a dangerous nail-biting
experience for PC\'s - or should allow the PC\'s to chase down
an ememy.

BATTLE TENDERS

In Xboat #363, Fred Kiesche asked:

>Has anybody ever used the "battle tender" portion of a battle rider combo to
>other uses?

Yes. _Supplement 9: Fighting Ships_ stated that a buffered planetoid was
shipped to Mora (or was that _from_ Mora?) via one of the Navy\'s million-ton
battle tenders. The planetoid was a non-jump monitor, and the transfer took
place during "fleet exercises". It was shipped in place of one of the normal
battle riders.

Also in Supp 9 was a "jump ship", which carried gear (_any_ gear) in a sling
behind it. The sling was used to extend the jump field. The ship started as
a j-6 ship, which was reduced for every 1000-tons diplacement that was
added as cargo (max 6000-tons, j-1). Nothing in the description disallowed
smaller ships to be carried in this manner!

RE:  \'ASTRONOMERS PREDICT FASTER THAN LIGHT SPACE TRAVEL\'

by Johnathan Leake, _The Sunday Times_, London,

13 August 1995, front page, lead story -

It is boldly going where no reputable scientific body has gone before.
Contradicting Einstein, the normally conservative Royal Astronomical
Society is about to publish a report predicting that mankind will be able
to travel faster than the speed of light. 

The breakthrough means that Star Trek fantasies of intersteller
civilisations and voyages powers by warp drive are now no longer the
exclusive domain of science fiction writers. 

The report was written by Ian Crawford, an astronomer at University
College London, who believes not only that man will one day see stars at
close quarters, but that we had better sart preparing ourselves for the
consequences, including contact with aliens. 

His paper, Some Thoughts on the Implications of Faster-Than-Light Travel,
has been validated by independent referees in the scientific community and
will be published next month. Its publication coincides with the formation
by British and American scientists of the Interstellar Propulsion Society
(IPS) which is dedicated to finding a means of taking astronauts to the
stars. 

Crawford argues that modern physics may allow two possible ways around
Einstein\'s theory, which says that because bodies have infinite mass at
the speed of light, no amount of energy can make them go faster. 

The first is to pass through "wormholes", rifts in the fabric of space
caused by intense gravitational fields such as those found around the
collapsed stars known as black holes. 

Crawford says that such fields may allow the traveller to enter a wormhole
from one point and then to leave it at another, possibly thousands of
light years away. 

Previously, scientists have assumed that any astronaut who was caught in
such a powerful gravitational field would be pulled into something
resembling a piece of spaghetti. 

However, Crawford said last week that recent research had suggested
wormholes could be stablised and manipulated to create short cuts between
any two points in space. "The proofs are complex and mathematical, but
more and more astrophysicists are satisfied that in theory it is
possible," he said. 

Should wormholes fail, however, Crawford proposes a second possible route
to the stars. He draws on a recent paper by Miguel Alcubierre, of the
University of Wales, in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity to
suggest the possibility of propulsion systems which distort space by
compressing it in front of a spaceship while expanding it behind. 

Such a system would effectively bend space, creating a form of "warp
drive" reminiscent of the Starship Enterprise of Captain James T. Kirk in
Star Trek. 

The theories will boost growing interest among scientists in the
possibility of travelling faster than light. The IPS, whose members
include several NASA engineers, starts its first conference shortly in
Halifax, Nova Scotia. 

Patrick Moore, the astronomer and presenter of The Sky At Night, said he
believed interstellar travel would one day be achieved. "Television would
have seemed impossible 200 years ago and faster than light travel is no
more outrageous than that," he said. 

Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer and futurologist, was equally
enthusiastic. His first novel, Against the Fall of Night, presumed that
man would be able to travel faster than light. Speaking from his home in
Colombo, Sri Lanka, he said: "That was just a dramatic device which all
science fiction writers have to use in space travel, but I have always
believed it may one day be possible." 

Sir Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal and Professor of Astronomy at
Cambridge University, was more cautious, however, saying the proofs were
purely theoretical.

fresh designs by players (though not necessarily in the way they want :)

I already have two other players, but think two or three more would be 
ideal.  All players are post-college and (with the exception of myself) 
not very traveller experienced (although they are RPG experienced).  

I only want three more player (at most) so first-come first-served!

  I\'ve used surplus Battleriders in my campaign as an alternate means of 
transport between high-pop worlds (cheaper for the small traders who hook 
their ships on, plus it saves wear and tear on the drives) and as a means 
of bypassing a dangerous or unprofitable section of space (linking two J-1
mains, for example).  I\'ve also use them as background, carrying 
enourmous standard containers on fixed runs - the sort of thing you 
describe to your players so they say "Wow, that\'s a Mega Megacorporation."

I like this explanation. But I just thought of something ...

Another corollary is that it becomes possible to jump from the surface of a
planet ... use an artificial gravity generator to smooth the gravity field
gradient in a localised area ... say, mount it in the roof of a cavern
pointing "down." Set up properly, you can reduce the gravity gradient below
where it would be at 100 diameters, and jump is perfectly safe.

Yes, it is still in production. I think issue 11 is due out some time
soonish. Subscriptions are 7.50 UK pounds for UK residents and 10.00 UKP for
overseas. That\'s 3 issues which I think is about 1 year.

I don\'t believe Signal-GK has a US or Canada distributor at the moment nor
are you likely to find it in the shops.

They are NOT on e-mail but to save you trans-pond postage, I can relay info
if you want to e-mail it to me (I have started writing for Signal-GK as well
as the Traveller Chronicle).

As regards Writing Guidelines for S-GK, they will accept material for any
era although each issue tends to concentrate on an area of Dagudashaag
sector and thus has some sort of theme. They are looking for people to write
sector data: try thinking up something new for the 299th planet in the
subsector, etc... ;-)

And yes, I quite agree with you: it\'s an excellent magazine for the price.
Okay, so they don\'t bother with a colour cover, but the contents
(particularly the alien races) are really good and thoroughly detailed.

The notes on George RR Martin\'s stuff reminded me of a few other authors that
I always felt had a strong "Traveller" feel.

Vinge, Vernor: Try "Fire Upon the Deep". Interesting, sprawling mega-space
opera. One feature that I like is that the galaxy has different tech levels
dictated by the actual structure of the galaxy. Go too "deep" and your FTL
drive no longer works...

Vinge, Joan: I can\'t recall the book, but she wrote a series of stories set
in a asteroid belt civilization after a nuclear war (I think there was a
wider intersteallar war involved as well...). Involved a STL ship going to
the belter civilization hoping that they were in better shape than the world
the STL ship left from. The stories appeared in Analog (one was called "Media
Man") and then appeared in two book editions (one about a year ago). The next
time I wander into my book collection I\'ll get a title!

Brin, David: His Uplift Series (Sundiver, Uplift War, Startide Rising--and
now Brightness Reef) puts an interesting twist on the whole space opera
concept. Some concepts that would carry into Traveller (and some of which are
used): Snobby aliens, "uplifted" primitive races (in Earth\'s case various
apes and dolphins, and they are working on dogs!), ancient artifacts from
long vanished races, lots of space fighting and more...

BTW, has anybody seen the advertisements for the new FOX TV series "Above and
Beyond"? They\'ve been advertising it heavily during X Files. Looks like
Marines in outer space, lots of shots of space fighters and looming planets
plus the credit/title shot of a group of guys cross country marching with big
moons in the background. Hmmmmmmm.....

That depends, I suppose, on whether or not you want to allow this in your
game.  There\'s "pro" and "con" arguments both ways.  On the "pro" side, it
allows some really nifty tricks (jumping from the surface of a planet,
for example, could be a clever escape route for a villian).  On the "con"
side, there would have to be some reasonable explanation why it\'s not used
regularly - it would be worth a _lot_ to be able to avoid the travel-time
out to 100 diameters, particularly on worlds that orbit close-in to a very
large star.

If you DON\'T want to allow it, here\'s a suggestion:

Postulate that grav technology has some property that\'s incompatible with
using the jump drive.  One possibility would be to assume that a grav field
isn\'t constant, but instead varies some significant amount (even a small
percent) at a frequency that is fast enough that it doesn\'t matter for most
normal uses of grav fields (*).  The variation is too great to allow a
ship to safely jump, or the best that can be done is to allow the equivalent
of a "desparate jump".

(*) This could be invoked to explain why grav vehicles "hum" or "whine", and
    why starships "rumble" or "whoosh" as they fly.  Vibrations in the
    air or ship\'s structure, induced by the grav field, are just at the 
    threshold of audio perception.  These barely-perceptable sounds vary
    with the type of grav generator and the load.

If you want to make it POSSIBLE but VERY DIFFICULT:

Assuming that artificial-gravity-flattened space is suitable for jumping,
it makes a lot of sens to make sure that the technique isn\'t economically
feasable and/or isn\'t very safe.  That would explain why it isn\'t in use
in the Imperium, but would allow for it\'s use in special circumstances.
The following items need to be addressed by any such facility:

- The jump envelope for a ship extends above the ship\'s hull, somewhere
  between a few centimeters and a meter, depending on the ship and the
  drive.  The ship\'s landing gear will have to be retracted, and the ship
  flying (floating) free in the chamber when the jump drive is activated.
  If this precaution isn\'t taken, the jump field will try to bring along
  a chunk of whatever the ship is touching, and will also raise the
  probability of misjump to the equivalent of a Desparate jump.

- The jump drive releases a large amount of energy into space (as visible
  light, infrared radiation, and probably stronger stuff, too - enough to 
  be clearly visible to an observer several kilometers away).  The
  facility will have to be designed to take this sort of abuse.  Treat
  the discharge as a large explosive device (the equivalent of several
  tons of explosive) detonated at the point where the ship exits.

- It\'s reasonable to assume that the ship\'s jump drive has local space
  warping effects larger than the ship itself (the rift into jumpspace
  through which the ship passes has to be large enough to give a safety
  margin, and it\'s reasonable to assume that there are strong effects
  many times larger than the rift itself).  A reasonable assumption for
  these sort of effects would be a radius of 100 times the largest
  dimension of the ship.  This whole area would have to be in null-g, so
  the null-g zone would have to be a sphere many kilometers in diameter.
  An area only 10 times the largest dimension of the ship would be the
  equivalent of a Desparate jump, and smaller areas would be the equivalent
  of jumping from within 10 diameters (suicidal).

- Jump drives normally operate in the vacuum of space, so that there is
  no nearby matter to interfere.  Even an atmosphere in contact with
  the ship\'s hull would be enough to distort the jump field, so the
  null-g zone would also have to be pumped down to a hard vacuum.  Jumping
  from a non-vacuum would raise the probability of a misjump to that of
  a Desparate jump.


If you want to make it POSSIBLE and EASY:

Not recommended - if this trick could be done safely and reliably at
Imperial tech levels, it would have been done.  Instead, make it either
a high-tech item that\'s beyond normal Imperial grasp, or some variant
universe (this would be the functional equivalent of some type of
stargate).

Implement some type of stargate technology.  This way, the grav eqipment
and the jump drive itself are built into the fixed base.  The ship has
to have a small protective field generator (call it a J-0.5 drive), but
can omit the jump drive fuel, and the larger drive.  This makes star
travel cheaper and more efficient, as well as piracy very unlikely.

To see these in a gaming context look for GURPS Uplift. I think it\'s out of

so I hear).

The suggestion holds whether the limit is (magnitude of grav field) or (rate
of 
change of grav field) 
I\'m sure they would if they could -- I suspect that the "grav" field induced
by 
"grav" generators is either:

a) not "pucka" - only a pseudo-gravity which will prevent things flying
around 
by accelerating them in a certain direction
	(a parallel would be mag. fields which can be used to levitate things
	which respond to magnetism)   
or
b) the grav generator uses osscillators to make the field (or transform it)
and 
produces a rippling field whose average is the desired value, but the 
combination of riplles and peaks/troughs in the field make it still dangerous
to 
jump (or <grin> even MORE dangerous)

Based on physics, I\'d say (a), as Gravity seems to be intimately linked with
the 
curvature of space and the presence of matter and energy and probably
impossible 
to change, but we could find some force (the rumoured Fifth Force?) which
could 
accellerate things in a pseudo-gravitic manner while reatingin the curvature
of 
space.

>From a technology standpoint (b) looks "plausible", and has interesting game

implications -- can you jump if caught in a Tractor/Repulsor beam?

According to DGP, artificial gravity does not eliminate
mass, it only negates the effects of gravity. AG is NOT
anti-grav, but a field inside which effects of gravity are
negated. And btw - you don\'t need to put grav plates in the
ceiling to get an upwards pull. Grav plates are perfectly
able to create pulls in every direction inside their area of
influence.

But then again, you\'re discussing a non-canonic variant
of the Traveller universe already :-)

Now that my collection is starting to inch towards "critical mass" again I\'ve
given thought to either running a game or playing in someone else\'s game.

Any interest in Classic Traveller in central NJ? I live in Franklin Park,
which is roughly halfway between New Brunswick (home of Rutgers University)
and Princeton (home of Princeton University). I\'ve got a **air conditioned**
house with a decent sized dining room table and a overly friendly dog.

Not to mention my wife who might be persuaded to play Traveller again
although her last experience (before we were even married) left her in a
rather embarassing situation (but that\'s another story).

I\'d like to start out with "classic" Traveller until I get a feel for the
rules and the background again. Of course, I would like to eventually move
into the rebellion era, and maybe the collapse era, but we\'ll see...

        Some great possibilities. If I ever get around to running a game,
I\'ll probably implement all of them.

        I think you\'ve confused contragravity and Artificial Gravity. When
you say "negates the effects of gravity" you certainly don\'t mesh with what
is meant by AG -- a effect within the confines of a ship mimicking to some
extent the effects of of a gravitational field, to keep everybody on the
deck, allow passengers to eat comfortably, and everybody to ignore the
hassles of zero-G. I\'ve always envisioned it as a very localised distortion
of space similar to what is caused by plain mass, but with the field
generators positioned such that they reinforce within the ship, and cancel
out much past the ship\'s hull.

 Not really, it makes sense.
 If all the great galactic empires have been stagnating, and never went 
through war in their own species, and have been constricted by a \'code\' 
that disallows \'nasty\' tricks, but wolflings & kin aren\'t. It\'s gonna be 
a pretty one-sided battle.
 Also rember, Humans went through the full evolution process, whereas all 
the others skipped a millenia or so.

At the National Air and Space museum, there\'s an exhibit called "Where Next,
Columbus?" (the whole museum is, of course highly recommended for TML/XBOAT
participatns, BUT:)

A part of this exhibit is the "Stellarium".

It\'s a large cylinder in a darkened room.  Inside the cylinder is an array of
lights (suspended in very tiny, black wires - the wires are practically
invisible).  The lights represent the Sun and all the stars within a 50-ly
radius of Earth.  The scale is 1ly = 25mm, and an attempt has been made to
represent both the brightness and color of all of the stars.  There is a
narration which identifies many of the more familiar stars in the
stellarium (and also points out that, if the brightness of the stars were
truly accurate, many of the dim, red stars would be invisible - and then
switches off those stars).

I\'d love to have this display as a campaign map for 2300, but I don\'t think
it\'s practical.  :-)  If you\'re in the DC area, a side trip to visit this
is probably worthwhile.

Internal Grav fields
The internal grav fields generated to keep the crews feet on the=20

are standing on the hull!

Jumps
The 10 and 100 diameter limits (as well as been easy to play, from=20
the UPP) are a problem of gravitational energy.  The jump field moves=20
a given volume into jumpspace, and it reemerges at a distant point. =20
The distance you wish to travel depends on how much energy you burn. =20
(Marc Miller=92s article in an old JoTAS).  As there is this energy=20

This is just a gravitatioonal well problem, it is not affected by=20
kienetic energy of accelleration.  As I understand general reletivity=20
neither of these cause distortions like a gravitational well.

Jumping from within another ship is just impossible.  Calculating the=20

could calculate the jump, it would want to return to the universe of=20
the jump bubble that had been jumped from.  As this bubble would no=20

effectivly destroying it!

Computers
I agree the computer sizes seem excessive but consided what it has to=20

The shipboard computer must contain enougth redundant systems for=20

You might try +1 program per tech level above minimum. This represents 
increased ability to multitask. Alternatively, allow computer sizes given 
in Book 2 to be "size at TL of introduction". If built at a higher TL, 
then the size is reduced (building TL - introduction TL) models.

Hence a Model/7 computer built at TL15 would be the size of a Model/5 
computer at its introductory TL (11).

Minimum computer size is 1 ton (Model 1). After minimum size is reached, 
allow +1 program running per TL of improvement. [Note these are for 
shipboard computers, which have a lot of dedicated electronics linked 
straight to the weapons systems, avionics, jump drive...]

Cost will be +1 model number for each TL of miniaturisation, so the TL15 
Model/7 will cost the same as a Model/9. [+20% per TL equivalent over 15...]
It\'s still cheaper to produce less efficient systems.

Thus, we might decide our model/7 should be made slightly smaller 
(model/6), cost the same as a model/8, and have +1 program capacity.
One would call this a model/7+1; an unmodified model/7 at TL15 would be a 
model/7+2.

Other scheme: +model number/2 per TL above introduction (round down) on 
program space (both active and stored). This may keep the advantage of 
higher model numbers better.

High Guard warships (except fighters) all tend to have maximum computers 
(unless they\'re FASA\'s, in which case *boom*) and will be unaffected in 
price and performance by this scheme. Merchants will also have the same 
computers (because miniaturised ones are more expensive) but these will 
have higher capacity. Under the +model/2 scheme, *all* starship computers 
(at least model/1, TL 5 or 6. I forget which) become model/1+2 or 1+1 
(depending on whether it\'s TL5 or TL6 for model/1).

A model 1+2 is twice as capable as a model/1 (CPU 4 versus CPU 2).

Perhaps if performance for a computer betters that of a higher model, it 
could be reclassified (at no extra cost). Thus, the model/1+2 (with CPU 4 
and storage 6) can be reclassified as a model/2 (with CPU 3 and storage 6).
This means smaller computers can be used for higher model numbers at no 
extra cost in miniaturisation. This is advantageous for larger merchant 
starships, which need a minimum computer size to jump -- that computer 
comes cheaper at higher TLs. The advantages for military craft 
(especially light fighters) are obvious.

I\'d recommend using the currency conversion rates into Imperial credits 
based on TL and starport (with an Imperial being TL15, starport A) if 
this scheme is used -- so higher tech is *always* a little more 
expensive, but generally better -- enough so to outweigh the extra cost.

How\'s that sound, for ideas?

  My roommate is a physics kind of guy; if I have any kind of
  questions about it, he can usually give me an answer, or at the
  very least, an informed guess that\'s not inconsistent with
  reality.

  I was thinking about the CT/MT thruster plates recently, and came
  up with something that just might account for their "magic":

  1.  Grav modules apply energy to create lift.

  2.  Thrust plates effectively allow grav modules to work outside
      a gravity well.

  3.  Thrust plates therefore must convert grav energy into
      something else that doesn\'t require a gravity well to react
      against.

  4.  Neutrinos seem to ignore almost all mass that happens to get
      into their path.

  5.  Despite the fact that they don\'t have any detectable mass,
      they _do_ seem to possess that quality of mass known as
      momentum.

  6.  Momentum equals mass times velocity.

  7.  Momentum is a vector quantity.

  8.  The Universe is a closed system.

  9.  The total momentum of the Universe must therefore remain
      constant.

 10.  Therefore, creating neutrinos and imparting a momentum vector
      upon them must also impart a momentum vector on something
      else, with a reversed direction.

 11.  Recall that neutrinos seem to ignore everything in their
      path.

 12.  Thrust plates convert grav energy into neutrinos, with a
      specified momentum.

 13.  This requires a reverse vector to be applied to something.

 14.  That something is the ship to which the thrust plates are
      attached.

 15.  Since neutrinos don\'t seem to affect anything in their path,
      the appearance to the common person is that the ship simply
      moves, with the only apparent "reaction" being that the
      thrust plates are glowing this funny blue color.

 16.  So, the common person, who cannot be expected to know the
      details of physics, calls the grav-generator-plus-thrust-
      -plates arrangement "reactionless thrusters".

 17.  How the thrust plates convert grav energy to neutrinos is
      left as an exercise for the student.

 If we can generate neutrinos at will, why do we need this HePlAR
 stuff?

18. Black globes tend to stop *everything*, including neutrinos.

19. Ships with a black globe on cannot maneuver.

20. 18-19 are consistent with a "energy-to-neutrino" approach.

21. If maneuver drives are a neutrino source, then a maneuvering starship 
can be detected by MT neutrino sensors, because of the drive emissions.

The comments re. thruster retcons made sense.  However, if the thrusters 
provide acceleration by emitting a stream of neutrinos, then it would 
show up well on a neutrino sensor (assuming you allow their existence), 
so either you need to change the sensor rules to reflect this, or 
postulate some other weird particle.  BTW, all particle appear to have 
momentum, regardless of mass, eg. a photon, which is definitely massless, 
but can provide thrust (solar sails, etc.).

Doesn\'t the neutrino sensor appear at TL 10, and then is perfected at TL 
11, ie. the same TL as thruster plates, and so both developments could be 
due to the same leap of understanding?

While reading *Arrival Veangance*, I noticed that the letter from the 
Office of the Archduke came from "Giyachi, Mora, Spinward Marches."  Thus 
apparently making Giyachi the capital of the Doamin of Deneb, and 
probably the Regency.

My question: what was the capital city of the Third Imperium?

Anyone?

<Stuff about neutrinos being a good fake for reactionless drives>


     Okay, I\'ll bite.   Where\'s the energy come from?   Using neutrino
emissions,
a 100T (1000 metric ton) scout pulling 2Gs should require around 6000
terawatts
to produce the required neutrinos.

    Otherwise, nothing wrong with the basic idea.  Keep in mind that it
postulates a
material that reflects virtually all neutrinos, which means something with AV

approaching infinity, I think....

    One question, though:

>  8.  The Universe is a closed system.

    Why do you think this is true?  It would seem that black
holes/singularities
might make the universe an "Open System"....


> If we can generate neutrinos at will, why do we need this HePlAR
> stuff?

     Whether we can generate neutrinos at Will (and what will they do to poor
Will?), why do we need HePlaR?  I use it in my current TCS, but only until
someone develops gravitics again....

The Emperor and upper administrative apparatus lived in the Imperial
palace on Capital, a set of gravitic structures; the Moot met in the
Moot Spire near the palace complex.  Both of these were in the city of
Cleon on Capital (a city with a few billion inhabitants, btw). The
palace complex was detailed in _Traveller\'s Digest_ #9, if you can get
a copy.

Giyachii on Mora, fyi, is an arcology (a city-in-a-building).

"Any sentient lifeform within Imperial borders, regardless of its origin, 
is a protected being, and thus a citizen of the Third Imperium."
                                   - Cleon, 17

Now, the above, found in the World Builders Handbook, is a whopper of an 
idea: if taken at face value, it seems to mean that anyone within 
Imperial borders is automatically an Imperial!

Yipes!  

Actually, I think that it\'s actually a workable concept, but I have no 
idea how to do it.  What about those who have no alliegence to the 
Imperium, but just happen to be within it\'s borders?  Is there any such 
thing as dual citizenship?

And, umm, what exactly are the rights of a citizen of the Third 
Imperium?  If I remember correctly, the Imperium is actually a massive 
trade federation of politically independent worlds: the Imperial 
Government actually controls the space between the stars, not the worlds 
themselves.

In this view, the government, nobility and Navy should strictly concern 
themselves with keeping the trade lanes open, protecting the rights of 
traders and perhaps encouraging economic development.  I can see how a 
set of rights would be drawn up for merchants, and to people on government 
business. But why did the Imperium - from it\'s very beginning - grant 
rights to everyone within the Imperium?  

I mean, yes it\'s generous, but it\'s a massive increase in workload!  
Moreover, there\'s a vast number of political, philosophical and religious 
philosophies within the Imperium: how do the basic Imperial rights of any 
citizen (say, at a guess, the right to a fair trial) interact with a 
lawless world?  Or a totalitarian dictatorship?  Or even your standard, 
vanilla-flavoured Impersonal Bureaucracy?

Idea: the Imperium isn\'t the miminalist government I always 
thought of it.  Well then, what is it for besides trade and shared 
security?

**************

And how do these rights interact with other interstellar governments, 
ie. 
     The Zhodani Consulate 
Does the local Zho ambassator have the right to be 
psionic?  And surely he isn\'t an Imperial citizen, simply because he 
crossed the Border?
     The Solomani Confederation 
(which doesn\'t offically exist!)
     The Hierate 
(which does, but is not as important as the 29 clans), 
     The Hive Federation 
(how does Imperial law handle the right to manipulate?)
     The Two Thousand worlds 
(how does the local embassy deal with Imperial citizens who happen to be 
carnivores?  Get the centaurs to expell him, rather than kill him?)
     Imperial Client States
(What exactly can an Imperial Citizen do in a Client state that he can\'t 
do in a non-aligned world?)

forms a single, closed sphere around all the perimeter stars of the
Empire, thereby enclosing and containing all stars that are not members
of the Empire as well. The non-member star systems themselves can
constitute a sphere (per system) that is NOT Imperial space, thereby
leaving those stars out of the Empire. In other words, the structure
of the Empire does not have to be a single, unbroken sphere of space.
Therefore, any peoples of non-member stars are not in Imperial space,
and do not have to be accorded the rights of an Imperial citizen.

This only handles part of the problem, and does not address what 
happens when those individuals actually enter Imperial space (through
visits, etc.). The quote you mentioned does not state how LONG that
a person has to be in Imperial space, just that they have to be IN it.

I think the motive behind the declaration is the answer to
your question:
>And, umm, what exactly are the rights of a citizen of the Third 
>Imperium?
"to pay taxes."

>What about those who have no alliegence to the 
>Imperium, but just happen to be within it\'s borders?
If a planet officially doesn\'t have alliegence then
it isn\'t "within imperial borders". It may be completely
surrounded by the Imperium but that part of space isn\'t
part of it. You should see a low level plot of the
border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. It goes
in and out and around particular farms. I think it is
based along the parish lines, which are not necessarily
continuous or complete (in the topological sense).

>But why did the Imperium - from it\'s very beginning - grant 
>rights to everyone within the Imperium?
  For their tax money. It makes sense. If they are within
their borders then they are gaining the benefit of their
patrolling the "space between the stars." They should have
the "right" to support it.

>(What exactly can an Imperial Citizen do in a Client state that
>he can\'t do in a non-aligned world?)
  Pay tax. :-)

>And, umm, what exactly are the rights of a citizen of the
>Third Imperium?

Well, there may not be many rights, but there sure are
some! Right now, I can think of one. Remember what you
cited Cleon for stating in 17:

>"Any sentient lifeform within Imperial borders, regardless
>of its origin, is a protected being, and thus a citizen of the
>Third Imperium."

The key word here is \'protected\'. It seems like I read
somewhere that "killing a sentient lifeform without
provocation is murder, and thus illegal" or something along
those lines (maybe it was in an article called something
like "The Problems of being Artificial" in TD #12(?)).

The way I read this, murder is illegal, in it is always illegal,
no matter where you are, as long as you are inside the
borders of the Imperium (or in jumpspace between two
imperial worlds). I think I read somewhere once, that
Imperial law defined a minimum set of rules, which applies
if nothing else does. Thus, murder is still illegal on a world
with government code 0. On the other hand, in reality it will
be hard to enforce on such a world, because there is no
set of rules defining what "provocation" is.

>Does the local Zho ambassator have the right to be
>psionic?

This is an interesting question. As all ambassadors, he
must have diplomatic immunity. What else are the imperials
going to say? "You, sir, are a psionic. We cannot tolerate
that!" Ssccwwooaarr!! <sound of fusion gun fire>

So I guess that psionic ambassadors are accepted. But
remember that a Zho embassy is NOT imperial territory,
and thus, the Zho ambassador can practise all the
psionics he/she wants, as long as their effects doesn\'t
spread outside of the embassy. I would guess that a Zho
ambassador using psionics outside the embassy would
be frowned upon. Repeated offences could even get him/
her expelled.

But as long as he/she is in imperial territory, he/she is a
protected being, and by THAT definition a citizen of the
Imperium.

Btw, isn\'t there an imperial law stating that it is illegal to use
pionics? Such a law would be a good candidate for the
minimum set of rules always applying anywhere in the
Imperium.

Oh, and more btw, (in response to an idea by Jo Grant)
paying taxes is not a right, it\'s a duty :-)

 Well, if I apply a minimum amount of Imagination to the question,
 I come up with a couple of uniquely unexpected possibilities:

                Capital, Capital, Core

 or

                Imperial Palace, Capital, Core

 (Remember that in the material that gave info on the Palace, it
 was big enough to be a city in its own right.)

There is nothing anywhere to state that Imperial space automatically
forms a single, closed sphere around all the perimeter stars of the
Empire, thereby enclosing and containing all stars that are not members
of the Empire as well. The non-member star systems themselves can
constitute a sphere (per system) that is NOT Imperial space, thereby
leaving those stars out of the Empire. In other words, the structure
of the Empire does not have to be a single, unbroken sphere of space.
Therefore, any peoples of non-member stars are not in Imperial space,
and do not have to be accorded the rights of an Imperial citizen.

This only handles part of the problem, and does not address what 
happens when those individuals actually enter Imperial space (through
visits, etc.). The quote you mentioned does not state how LONG that
a person has to be in Imperial space, just that they have to be IN it.

I think the motive behind the declaration is the answer to
your question:

"to pay taxes."

>What about those who have no alliegence to the

If a planet officially doesn\'t have alliegence then
it isn\'t "within imperial borders". It may be completely
surrounded by the Imperium but that part of space isn\'t
part of it. You should see a low level plot of the
border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. It goes
in and out and around particular farms. I think it is
based along the parish lines, which are not necessarily
continuous or complete (in the topological sense).

>But why did the Imperium - from it\'s very beginning - grant

  For their tax money. It makes sense. If they are within
their borders then they are gaining the benefit of their
patrolling the "space between the stars." They should have
the "right" to support it.

>(What exactly can an Imperial Citizen do in a Client state that

  Pay tax. :-)

6/9-95 Alvin Plummer spake:

>And, umm, what exactly are the rights of a citizen of the
>Third Imperium?

Well, there may not be many rights, but there sure are
some! Right now, I can think of one. Remember what you
cited Cleon for stating in 17:

>"Any sentient lifeform within Imperial borders, regardless
>of its origin, is a protected being, and thus a citizen of the
>Third Imperium."

The key word here is \'protected\'. It seems like I read
somewhere that "killing a sentient lifeform without
provocation is murder, and thus illegal" or something along
those lines (maybe it was in an article called something
like "The Problems of being Artificial" in TD #12(?)).

The way I read this, murder is illegal, in it is always illegal,
no matter where you are, as long as you are inside the
borders of the Imperium (or in jumpspace between two
imperial worlds). I think I read somewhere once, that
Imperial law defined a minimum set of rules, which applies
if nothing else does. Thus, murder is still illegal on a world
with government code 0. On the other hand, in reality it will
be hard to enforce on such a world, because there is no
set of rules defining what "provocation" is.

>Does the local Zho ambassator have the right to be
>psionic?

This is an interesting question. As all ambassadors, he
must have diplomatic immunity. What else are the imperials
going to say? "You, sir, are a psionic. We cannot tolerate
that!" Ssccwwooaarr!! <sound of fusion gun fire>

So I guess that psionic ambassadors are accepted. But
remember that a Zho embassy is NOT imperial territory,
and thus, the Zho ambassador can practise all the
psionics he/she wants, as long as their effects doesn\'t
spread outside of the embassy. I would guess that a Zho
ambassador using psionics outside the embassy would
be frowned upon. Repeated offences could even get him/
her expelled.

But as long as he/she is in imperial territory, he/she is a
protected being, and by THAT definition a citizen of the
Imperium.

Btw, isn\'t there an imperial law stating that it is illegal to use
pionics? Such a law would be a good candidate for the
minimum set of rules always applying anywhere in the
Imperium.

Oh, and more btw, (in response to an idea by Jo Grant)
paying taxes is not a right, it\'s a duty :-)

I\'ve always assumed that multiple citizenship was part of
Imperial life, and that almost everyone was a citizen of
both a world* and the Imperium, bearing in mind that each world
would define citizenship in its own way.  (E.g., everyone 
born here is a citizen; or everyone who lives here for ten 
years is a citizen; or everyone born into certain named 
families is a citizen, no matter where born.)

*"World" really means "Imperial member state," and could
be an entire star system or a nation on a balkanized
planet.

I can\'t abide by making Imperial citizens out of
every sentient being that just happens to be in the
Imperium. That makes every Vargr corsair band that lands
on Pixie or Jesedipere for raiding or carousing into
Imperial citizens. In my Imperium the law is more or less
as follows:

Every sentient being born in the Imperium may become an
Imperial citizen.  

For species who can track biological parentage, those
beings born of parents who are all Imperial citizens need
do nothing and are automatically Imperial citizens.  Those
born of parents at least one of whom is not an Imperial
citizen are dual citizens of the Imperium and the parent\'s
state until the age of majority, at which point they much
choose.  Treaties between the Imperium and the other
recognized states further define this dual citizenship
issue.

For species who do not track parentage (e.g., Hivers),
unique rules apply.  For example, a Hiver enclave in the
Imperium (like the one in Australia) might apply for
recognition as an Imperial member state (or it might just
apply to Terra for permission to organize itself under
Terran law) and for Imperial citizenship for each of its members
and all offspring born in the enclave.  Many of the
offspring would be conceived during the handshaking part of
visits from the Hiver Federation, but they would still be
Imperial citizens.  

N.B.: Terran law might prohibit non-humans from becoming
citizens, so the Hivers might be citizens of the Imperium,
but not of any world.  

Documentation:  Travellers within the Imperium need a 
passport from at least one world (one may legitimately be a 
citizen of more than one world of the Imperium; that\'s a 
matter of local law) to pass local customs at each member 
state.  One need not be a citizen of a member state to have 
a passport properly issued:  Each Hiver in the example 
above has a special Terran passport that notes that the 
Hiver is a permanent resident of Terra.  Some member states 
may require visas (permission to enter) for entry as well.  
In order to qualify for various governmental programs of, or 
even to work in, a member state, one must show documents 
providing citizenship or other qualification under local 
law.

Travellers returning to the Imperium from outside its
borders must show an Imperial passport (often just an
Imperial stamp in their member state passport) at Imperial
customs.  Most non-Imperial states require non-citizens to 
show a passport, and possibly a visa, at customs upon 
entry.  

The Imperium does not require exit visas, nor do most 
member states. 

The citizenship of beings born in the Imperium to
diplomats from non-Imperial states is governed by treaty.

Imperial citizens have two sets of rights:  collective and
individual.  The collective right is primarily the right
to collective self-determination.  For example, once the
chirpers on Vanejen were determined to be sentient (see
Alien Realms), they were entitled to diplomatic relations,
secure borders, etc. (I say "etc." because the law is 
necessarily vague:  The chirpers, once recognized as 
Imperial citizens, were entitled to whatever they could get 
the Imperium to give them, which surely focussed on 
protection from the humans of Vanejen.)  They were also 
presumably made subject to the draft.

This collective right is essential to the structure of the
Imperium:  it is what allows every Imperial member state
to have its own culture, law, political system, religions,
languages, armed forces, currencies, etc.

Individual civil rights are the rights of individuals
against the Imperium -- except for the prohibition on
slavery, these rights can\'t be asserted against Imperial
member states.  The Imperium grants basic due process,
i.e., notice and a hearing before Imperial action that
results in some deprivation to the individual.  Due
process extends in obvious directions -- trial by a jury
of one\'s peers, public laws, opportunity to appeal, notice
of Ministerial rulemaking, notice of interdictions, etc.  
Note that these due process rights apply to fictitious 
citizens like corporations, not just to individual 
sentients.  (Lawyers admitted to the Imperial bar have 
plenty of work to do.)

Slavery -- the ownership of sentient beings like property
-- is also prohibited in the Imperium (because it\'s bad for

I have always used the following approach to whether or not a sapient is a
citizen of the Imperium: Have they been employed within Imperial space for
4 years or more, paying Imperial taxes, and requested an Imperial Passport.

If a being meets those requirements, is not currently wanted for violations
of Imperial Law, and has no history of treasonous behavior, it\'s pretty
much automatic, although I require that they wait 6-9 months while the Navy
searches it\'s files.

As for Civil Rights of Imperial Citizens, I have always used the following:
Freedom of Interstellar Movement, Freedom from weapons of mass destruction
(See also the Rules of War), the right to send written appeal to one\'s
Noble representative, and the right to live.

The Library data only defines one crime clearly, that being Murder. Hence
the right to life.

Note that I did not mention freedom to leave a world; The Traveller
Adventure has several items about exit visas from worlds. Individual worlds
may restrict access to space, but once past orbit, space belongs to the
Imperium.

According to my players, there should also be one other express civil
right: the right to a minimum standard of safety aboard spacecraft, which
includes standardized Transponder, Safety, and Design standards.

Also note that the Imperium is NOT TRULY a government of law, but of
tradition. It is tradition that provides the basis of these rights, not
written laws (Edicts).

  {
    'body' => 'Right, I left taxes out of my post on Citizenship Issues in the 
Imperium.  The right to pay taxes is important.  In my Imperium, taxation 
works more or less as follows:

Individuals are not subject to any direct Imperial taxation (but they are 
subject to the Imperial draft, which is another story).  Imperial member 
states that are not directly controlled by nobles are subject to a tax 
based on their gross state product.  The tax may be paid in cash or 
kind.  The subsector duke is usually the first tax collector, and usually 
gets to spend the money subject to approval by the sector duke, who in 
turn must get approval from the archduke.  These approvals are generally 
vague and broad.  The subsector duke may submit a 5-year plan, which, 
after discussion and modification, will be accepted by the sector duke 
and submitted to the archduke as part of a 10-year plan for the sector, 
and on up the line.  The plans may be many years out of date.

Individuals are subject to taxation by member states, based on local 
law, and may be subject to more than one such tax.  For example, a 
citizen of Regina residing on and working in Rhylanor who sends money 
home every month will be subject to Rhylanor\'s noncitizen/resident income 
tax, Regina\'s citizen/nonresident income tax, and the various sales and 
property taxes attaching to whatever transactions she enters into.

Non-LIC business organizations are taxed basically like individuals -- 
i.e., only under local law.  The taxation of business organizations 
(which includes non-profits, educational institutions, churches, etc., as 
well as regular for-profit businesses) is complex, detailed, and often in 
conflict from one member state to another.  Non-LIC businesses that grow 
large enough to attract the attention of the Ministry of Taxation are 
generally awarded LIC status.

LIC business organizations are (1) substantially involved in interstellar 
commerce; (2) very large (there is probably a BCr or TCr number, but I 
don\'t know what it is); (3) publicly held (at least partly).  LIC 
corporations must report annually to the Imperial government.  At least 
three Ministries receive reports:  the Ministry of Taxation (of course); 
the Ministry of Finance (which oversees disclosure under the Imperial 
securities laws, which only apply to the publicly traded securities of 
LIC businesses); and whatever Ministry or Ministries govern the primary 
businesses of the company.  For example, Tukera Lines, LIC, reports to 
the Ministry of Transportation as well as Taxation and Finance.

Of course, non-LIC interstellar operations, like Jameson Factors and 
Uakye Trading Partners, make certain payments to the Imperium that are in 
effect taxes.  For example, their ships pay berthing fees to the Ministry 
of Transportation.  Interstellar ships are subject to the engineering and 
safety standards of the Ministry of Transportion (they were formerly 
subject to standards set by the Ministry of Standards, but the turf war 
between MoT and MoS resulting in a MoT win, but that\'s another story); 
they may be subject to fine for continuing violations.

Once, while paging through the list of Megacorporations, I noticed that the
Imperial Family owned at least two percent (often more) of all but one of 
them. Checking the information of the few other LIC corporations we\'ve
had library data on (Oberlindes Lines and a few others) showed that there, 
too, the Imperial family owned at least two percent. I therefor decided
that in my universe the price of a LI Charter was to assign an unsellable
2% of the company to the Emperor. It\'s IMO a nice, simple way to finance
the Imperium (or perhaps just the Imperial Household; I never tried to
calculate how much money would be involved, but 2% of every LIC company in 
the Imperium should come to a tidy bit, shouldn\'t it?), and it seemed 
perfectly in accord with the commercial origin of the Imperium.

There remained that one pesky Megacorporation that didn\'t have any shares
owned by the Imperial Family (I forget which one it was), but I liked the
idea so much that I decided that it must have been a misprint.

Btw. by "financing the Imperium" I do not include the Imperial Navy. That,
according to _TCS_ and _Striker_, is financed by assessing each member
world a per capita tax.

I\'ve always assumed that multiple citizenship was part of
Imperial life, and that almost everyone was a citizen of
both a world* and the Imperium, bearing in mind that each world
would define citizenship in its own way.  (E.g., everyone 
born here is a citizen; or everyone who lives here for ten 
years is a citizen; or everyone born into certain named 
families is a citizen, no matter where born.)

*"World" really means "Imperial member state," and could
be an entire star system or a nation on a balkanized
planet.

I can\'t abide by making Imperial citizens out of
every sentient being that just happens to be in the
Imperium. That makes every Vargr corsair band that lands
on Pixie or Jesedipere for raiding or carousing into
Imperial citizens. In my Imperium the law is more or less
as follows:

Every sentient being born in the Imperium may become an
Imperial citizen.  

For species who can track biological parentage, those
beings born of parents who are all Imperial citizens need
do nothing and are automatically Imperial citizens.  Those
born of parents at least one of whom is not an Imperial
citizen are dual citizens of the Imperium and the parent\'s
state until the age of majority, at which point they much
choose.  Treaties between the Imperium and the other
recognized states further define this dual citizenship
issue.

For species who do not track parentage (e.g., Hivers),
unique rules apply.  For example, a Hiver enclave in the
Imperium (like the one in Australia) might apply for
recognition as an Imperial member state (or it might just
apply to Terra for permission to organize itself under
Terran law) and for Imperial citizenship for each of its members
and all offspring born in the enclave.  Many of the
offspring would be conceived during the handshaking part of
visits from the Hiver Federation, but they would still be
Imperial citizens.  

N.B.: Terran law might prohibit non-humans from becoming
citizens, so the Hivers might be citizens of the Imperium,
but not of any world.  

Documentation:  Travellers within the Imperium need a 
passport from at least one world (one may legitimately be a 
citizen of more than one world of the Imperium; that\'s a 
matter of local law) to pass local customs at each member 
state.  One need not be a citizen of a member state to have 
a passport properly issued:  Each Hiver in the example 
above has a special Terran passport that notes that the 
Hiver is a permanent resident of Terra.  Some member states 
may require visas (permission to enter) for entry as well.  
In order to qualify for various governmental programs of, or 
even to work in, a member state, one must show documents 
providing citizenship or other qualification under local 
law.

Travellers returning to the Imperium from outside its
borders must show an Imperial passport (often just an
Imperial stamp in their member state passport) at Imperial
customs.  Most non-Imperial states require non-citizens to 
show a passport, and possibly a visa, at customs upon 
entry.  

The Imperium does not require exit visas, nor do most 
member states. 

The citizenship of beings born in the Imperium to
diplomats from non-Imperial states is governed by treaty.

Imperial citizens have two sets of rights:  collective and
individual.  The collective right is primarily the right
to collective self-determination.  For example, once the
chirpers on Vanejen were determined to be sentient (see
Alien Realms), they were entitled to diplomatic relations,
secure borders, etc. (I say "etc." because the law is 
necessarily vague:  The chirpers, once recognized as 
Imperial citizens, were entitled to whatever they could get 
the Imperium to give them, which surely focussed on 
protection from the humans of Vanejen.)  They were also 
presumably made subject to the draft.

This collective right is essential to the structure of the
Imperium:  it is what allows every Imperial member state
to have its own culture, law, political system, religions,
languages, armed forces, currencies, etc.

Individual civil rights are the rights of individuals
against the Imperium -- except for the prohibition on
slavery, these rights can\'t be asserted against Imperial
member states.  The Imperium grants basic due process,
i.e., notice and a hearing before Imperial action that
results in some deprivation to the individual.  Due
process extends in obvious directions -- trial by a jury
of one\'s peers, public laws, opportunity to appeal, notice
of Ministerial rulemaking, notice of interdictions, etc.  
Note that these due process rights apply to fictitious 
citizens like corporations, not just to individual 
sentients.  (Lawyers admitted to the Imperial bar have 
plenty of work to do.)

Slavery -- the ownership of sentient beings like property
-- is also prohibited in the Imperium (because it\'s bad for
the peace of the realm to have slave-raiders attacking
weaker member states).  This is the only Imperial civil 
right that applies to Imperial member states.

Imperial law recognizes certain "inadvertent" or
"accidental" civil rights of Imperial citizens.  For
example, Imperial regulation of expression has been
limited to prohibiting lese majeste (impugning the honor
of a superior noble by falsehood), perjury to any Imperial
body (e.g., the Moot or any Ministry or court), disclosure
of official secrets, and the like.  Thus the Imperium has
inadvertently left its citizens free to speak and to report 
the news.  Although the Emperor has the power to restrict 
freedom of speech and the press, doing so would violate 
custom.  The Emperor\'s subordinates would never violate 
customs followed by the Emperor.  Religion, family 
organization, property allocation, and the like are similar 
"accidental" rights.

Hi All,

I have been searching through my gaming materials looking for an 
explanation of how fusion power is implemented in Traveller. It has been 
bothering me that Traveller seems to treat PP as black boxes which 
convert Hydrogen to power and thrust. I have found very few details in TNE 
and MT supplements that I own. Can anyone refer me to a good source of info?

Basically, I\'m assuming that a fusion PP is a magnetic bottle containing 
the reaction. Apparently, some of the pressure is used in HEPLAR for 
thrust. I am interested in how usable power can be obtained from this 
fusion blast. There have been past comments on the list that the 
efficiencies for fusion are way too low. How are efficiencies for 
something like this estimated. Has anything else been surmised based on 
current experiments (ie startup procedure, configuration)?

Also, how would the recombustion for fusion thrust be accomplished. 
I can only guess that excess pressure beyond that required to sustain the 
reaction is bled off into the recombustion chamber.

Any ideas/theories are welcome. I plan to incorporate this into 
my house rules. Feel free to email me direct if you do not want to post to 
the list.  

Thanks,

Glenn

  One thing that has bugged me is that in the Book 2 designs, the amount of 
fuel that a power-plant uses, depends on the ship it is in!
	a Type-A in the Scout uses 20tons in 4 weeks
	a Type-A in the Free Trader uses 10tons in 4 weeks
  What I\'ve done to fix this, is to produce a table relating fuel 
consumption to drive type (a-z), this is in line with the modular nature 
of Book 2 designs.
  This has been combined with a table of fuel consumption rates found in 
the "Beltstrike" module, again slightly modified.

  How they work.
	The fussion power plant, uses a magnetic bottle to contain the 
fussion plasma.  The fussion reaction chain is similar to the H-N-O-C 
chains in stellar fussion.  This is so my plants can use unrefined fuel 
straight from the tanks.
	The manoeuver drive, uses a mix of waste products from the 
fussion plant, and raw fuel itself.  These are mixed and fed to an MHD 
rocket.  The mixing of the fuel and fussion waste produces an ionised 
plasma mix, this is accellerated by the MHD coils and vented out of the 
exaust.

	This of course is the main reaction drive system.  There are 
other subsystems.  The low thrust manoeuvering, and the gravitic lift 
systems as well.

A lower limit can be guessed from one of Hans\'s recent TML sigs:

This probably made it to his sig block because it seems a bit...uh...
small.  But let\'s run with it.  Assume:
  * 120 ships on average at all type-A starport systems
  * Each ship is player-scaled; about 400-600 tons, worth MCr 100.
  * All the ports in the Imperium carry the equivalent of, say, 
    5000 class-A ports; this figure includes ships in transit.
  Then all this shipping is worth sixty trillion credits.  Assume
  chartered companies own just over eighty percent of it, or fifty 
  trillion credits worth.  Two percent of *just these ships* is
  a trillion credits.  If the average ship is a bulk freighter of
  MCr 10000 value and maybe fifty thousand tons, then two percent
  is a hundred trillion credits, at these traffic levels.
  
How about high-end?  Using (or misusing) the official rules, both
Derek Wildstar and I have tried to come up with estimates of the
Imperial GNP, and our results came within an order of magnitude of
each other.  Derek used a sophisticated approach; he ran the sector 
data files through a computer programmed with certain rules from
first edition Striker, shipyard rules from TCS, and the exchange
rate table.  I used the colony rules in _World Tamers\' Handbook_, 
treating the Imperium as a single HiPop world of tech-12 (AvgStellar) 
and a population of 15.77 trillion (from an old Travellers\' Digest 
article).

Derek figured Imperial GNP was just under a quarter of a quintillion
credits.  My figures originally came to over half a quintillion, but 
I didn\'t assume that I was working with tech-12, starport-B average
credits, and Derek *did* do trade table conversions.  So, to be fair,
let\'s reduce my guess by 20% to convert to tech-15, starport-A, hard
Imperial credits.  I\'m only a factor of two bigger than Derek here.  
That range is probably about as accurate an estimate as we\'re likely
to get.  In any case, two percent of annual production (not assets)
is just short of ten quadrillion credits. 

Whew.  Now, a limited-liability Imperial Charter is only required
for businesses that directly engage in interstellar commerce, so
strictly planetary companies that only ship off-world don\'t need
one.  And corporations that are pre-Imperial or have bought a pre-
Imperial chartered company, get grandfathered in, like SuSAG did.
So a quadrillion credits or so seems like a reasonable guess.

If that isn\'t bad enough, the Hortalez family may be *richer* than
the Imperial Household.  The Alkhalikoi dynasty owns about two-thirds
of a megacorporation in aggregate, a third of it in the Zirunkariish
insurance house.  The Hortalez family owns three-fourths of Hortalez
et Cie, which in turn owns in aggregate the equivalent of *two* 
megacorporations, in addition to any other corporate assets.  I
wonder what they pay regional sector managers.... :)

Glenn, what follows is considered the authoritative answer.  This document
is from the HIWG and (as far as I know) was approved by GDW for Traveller.

 Nuclear Fusion Reactor System                           HD 032.02
 Traveller Tech Brief
  
 Abstract
      This article will attempt to set out, in some detail, the anatomy of
 fusion reactor systems in Traveller (more specifically, those used as
starship
 power plants), the fusion reactions they use, their most common failure
modes,
 and the methods and expected results of sabotaging power plants.
  
 Introduction
      For the majority of Traveller players, fusion power plants are simply
 clever little boxes which hum away in the rear of the vehicle producing
oodles
 of power, and occasionally having to be fed with glasses of water. Being the
 incredibly destructive creatures they are, however, players will sooner or
 later want to sabotage the power plant of an enemy vehicle or ship or repair
 their own after combat damage or accident. After facing some embarrassing
 questions (one player in my group is a physicist, another a nuclear
engineer)
 I composed this article.
  
 Regular or Super Unleaded?
      The standard Traveller references on power plants (SOpM being the most
 instructive) state that the fusion reactor is fuelled by "hydrogen." What
they
 fail to state is that there are three different isotopes of hydrogen, with
 quite different abundances and nuclear properties. These are:
      1H (Protium): Stable (non-radioactive.) Consisting of one proton and
one
 electron, protium is by far the most abundant isotope in the Universe.
      2H (Deuterium): Stable. Consisting of one proton, one neutron, and one
 electron, Deuterium is present to an abundance of approximately one part in
 5,000 in "natural" hydrogen extracted from seawater.
      3H (Tritium): Radioactive. Decays to Helium-3 by proton emission with a
 half-life of 12.5 years. Consisting of one proton, two neutrons, and an
 electron, Tritium\'s natural abundance is negligible -- it has to be
 "manufactured" by a variety of possible routes.
      Current research on fusion power production is concentrating on
 deuterium-deuterium, deuterium-tritium, or deuterium-Helium-3 fusion, as
these
 require the lowest plasma energies. At first this suggested to me that
 Traveller power plants were standard deuterium-tritium reactors, but further
 examination of Traveller texts has ruled this out. My reasons for this are
 detailed below.
  
  
 Wot? No Tritium?
      My first reservation is based on the health and security hazards
 involved in handling large quantities of radioactive material such as
tritium.
 Starport scenarios make no mention of the necessity of shielding fuel lines
or
 storage tanks! Also, tritium is important in the manufacture of "clean" or
 laser-triggered fusion warheads -- I would think it is the Imperium\'s
interest
 to regulate the sale and supply of tritium.
      Second, there is a serious problem with wilderness refueling, whether
it
 be from oceans, gas giants, or Oort clouds. The references state that
 purification plants are intended to remove "trace" impurities which may
 interfere with the operation of the reactor. For a deuterium-fueled reactor,
 however, 4,999 parts in 5,000 of the fuel intake is "impurity." Ships
without
 a purification plant would be in serious trouble.
  
      Third, the scenario "Wrong Way Valve" in Challenge #31 specifically
 states that a starship\'s fuel tanks are filled with ordinary water. (It
makes
 no mention of the repeated electrolysis necessary for deuterium separation.)
      Thus, it is clear that Traveller fusion reactors are remarkable devices
 which can be fueled by "natural" hydrogen (primarily protium.) I say
 remarkable, because the plasma energy and magnetic confinement requirements
 for protium fusion (via the "proton-proton" chain, as in the center of the
 Sun) are several orders of magnitude greater than those for other types of
 fusion. It seems the only way to duplicate this process is to construct a
 reactor the size of a small star! However, there is still hope ....
  
  
 C, NO Other Way
      As I stated previously, it is believed that the sun produces energy by
 fusing protium via the "proton-proton" chain. Some giant stars fuse hydrogen
 by a different route, known as the "CNO catalytic cycle", so-called because
 isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen participate in the nuclear
reaction,
 lowering the plasma energy sufficiently for it to become a practicable
 proposition. The CNO catalyst is not consumed in the reaction, and only
 relatively small amounts are necessary to produce sustainable fusion. For
 those of you who are interested, the details of the cycle are shown below.
  
      12C + 1H -> 13N + y
      13N + 1H -> 14O + y
           14O -> 14N + e+ + y
      14N + 1H -> 15O + y
           15O -> 15N + e+  + y
      15N + 1H -> 12C + 4He
  
  
 Anatomy of a Traveller Fusion Reactor
      All starship power plants possess a small "purification" plant known as
 an HHSU (Heavy Hydrogen Separation Unit.) This unit partially separates the
 deuterium from a small volume of the fuel. The deuterium-enriched fuel is
used
 when the reactor is in "warm-start" or "park" mode. Because the reactor uses
 deuterium-deuterium fusion in "warm-start" and CNO fusion in normal
operation,
 it is known as a split-cycle or twin-cycle reactor.
      The components of a starship reactor system are discussed below.
  
      1. Containment Vessel: A highly rigid vessel typically constructed of
 superdense metal, inlaid with superconducting field coils. Contains the
plasma
 "bottle", either of toroidal ("tokamak") or spherical ("ball lightning")
 configuration.
      2. Ignition Capacitors: Supply the initial energy pulse to establish
the
 magnetic fields and heat the plasma.
      3. Power Transfer Circuit: Fusing plasma is passed through a MHD
system,
 directly producing electric power.
      4. Thermal Transfer Circuit: Containment vessel cooled by liquid sodium
 or high-pressure argon. System links through at least two heat-exchanger
loops
 to hull radiator strips. Turbine generators in coolant circuit produce
 supplementary power and low-pressure steam for ship systems.
      5. Helium Purge Circuit: Removes waster helium from containment system.
 May be discarded or retained for ship\'s cryogenic systems.
      6. HHSU: See above.
      7. Deuterium Warm Start Reservoir: ("Ignition module".) Holds the
supply
 of deuterium-enriched fuel prior to warm-start of reactor.
      8. Catalyst "Scavenge" Circuit: Maintains level of CNO catalysts in
 containment vessel.
      9. CNO Catalyst Reservoir: ("Sustainer Module".) Holds the supply of
CNO
 catalyst when the reactor is at "warm start", or powered down.
  
  
 Failure Modes and Sabotage Opportunities
      Or: I thought you checked the sustainer module...
  
 Containment Failure:
      There are sufficient failsafes built into the field coil system that a
 catastrophic failure of the magnetic bottle is highly unlikely. The "ball
 lightning" bottle configuration tends to be self-sustaining for short
periods
 ... meaning that the sphere of plasma can punch its way out of the
containment
 vessel if the coil system fails.
      To sabotage the field coil system:
      Formidable, Engineering, Electronics, 10 min (Hazardous, Fateful)
 
      Conversely, the magnetic bottle may be too small, or the catalyst level
 too high for the fuel volume being injected...in which case a thermonuclear
 explosion will result. To achieve this, the majority of the reactor control
 firmware must be rewritten, and the diagnostic circuitry disabled.
  
      To rewrite the reactor control firmware to cause an explosion:
      Impossible, Computer, Engineering, 18 min (hazardous)
  
  
 Coolant Failure:
      In the event of a partial or complete coolant failure, the reactor
 should flip to warm start or power down automatically. If the ship is in
 flight, the computer will offer an override option to the crew - but the
 consequences of reactor overheat are highly unpredictable. You have been
 warned.
      
 Deuterium Failure:
      If the deuterium separator or reservoir fail, the reactor will not cold
 start. Period. A potential saboteur may decide to remove the ignition module
 to cripple an enemy starship. On a small starship (under 500 tons), the
 ignition module is typically 40cm x 20cm x 15cm and weighs 16 kg.
  
      To remove ignition module:
      Formidable, Engineering, Dex, 30 sec (hazardous, uncertain)
      Referee: Task is difficult if reactor design is familiar to engineer.
      On Some Truth, diagnostic circuit is triggered.
  
 Catalyst Failure:
      If the catalyst scavenge circuit fails, or the sustainer module is
 removed, interesting things can happen.The reactor will appear to operate
 normally at full power, but sometime - between 15 seconds and 20 minutes
after
 power up - it will flip back to warm start without warning and will not
 restart. This can be troublesome if the ship happens to be a couple of
 kilometers up in the air at the time.
      On small starships, the sustainer module is typically 25cm by 12cm by
 10cm and weighs 6kg.
  
      To remove sustainer module:
      Formidable, Engineering, Dex, 40 sec (Hazardous)
      Referee: As ignition module above.

In Scouts and Assassins, they detailed the aircraft-shaped Type S Scout, as
built by "Delta Research" of the Beyond. The Beyond showed where they were
located. Merchants and Merchandise came up with some nifty equipment as well
as the PC expansion, including a low-tech grav bike, a tranq gun (this was
prior
to Book 4\'s snub pistol), a taser, intelligent (AI) computers partially built
with organic components (experimental TL 16), medical low berths, and even
transporter booths (!! experimental TL 16, 17!!).

The subsector maps, I believe, are no longer seen as "canon". I believe that
they were viewed as "excessive" in nature, perhaps not fitting in with
"normal"
Traveller (eg. one or two TL\'s in the Beyond!). I know that Chuck re-wrote
the
Vanguard Reaches a few years ago, saying that "wild rumours" about
ringworlds,
etc (there was one in the Beyond) were just that - wild rumours.

I admit, I liked the Reaches better than the Beyond. A nice touch was a
nebula in subsector M, being studied by a research station.

(I also found some WEIRD coincidences, BTW: In my version of Far Frontiers,
I placed Thieves World about 4 hexes from where Chuck had placed it in the
Reaches; plus, I made the nation spanning Foreven and Beyond (SEE the
standard
black "overall" map) a Germanic one - and this was before I knew it had
been named "Die Weltbund" in the Beyond! Dah duh dah duh dah duh dah duh...)

    'body' => 'CNO fusion has been proposed again recently as the standard CT-MT fusion 
(including a very well-thought description by Duncan Law-Green). 
I would like to express some skepticism on this. CNO fusion has a stronger
temperature dependence than the p-p fusion occurring on the SUN and
require significantly higher temperatures. Since the hydrogen plasma
is "contaminated" by CNO nuclei equipartition will tend to lower
its temperature pushing it below the ignition value. Of course thermal
losses of this kind are less problematic  in a star but may be very
serious in a man-made plasma (cfr e.g. the very serious energy losses
due to helium and impurities in present day Tokamaks). My best bet is
that p-p fusion will be easier to achieve in a controlled way. Note also
that by modifying those principles one could try to achieve 3 alpha or
Carbon fusion getting more energies from the same mass of fuel. These
are certainly hard to achieve but we should not think in terms of TL 9
technologies but TL 15!

Years ago in the old TML after a long debate it was proposed to have
p-p in starships and D+He3 in portable generators (to avoid the problems
of shielding from fast neutrons). This is also an interesting solution.

above all these considerations lies the shadow of the ridicoulously low
efficiencies of fusion in MT tables. Reconciling that with any sensible
scheme is going to be pretty hard....

The standard sector format since megatraveller includes the primary and
companion types at the end of the line fpr the system. Note that only the
main world is listed, along with the number of planetoid belts and gas
giant.

the data files for the Second Surveyare posted on GEnie or are available
from an FTP site, which you can get pointed to from one of the following

will visit I noticed that the gun prices for black powder weapons in _World
Tamer\'s Handbook_ is off by a factor of 11-13 (as compared to the prices in
the TNE rulebook) and the ACR that is the sole example of weapons in _Fire,
Fusion & Steel_ is more that 5 times more expensive than the ACR in the
main rules.
    So I thought I\'d like to reality check those weapons that I have a chance
of checking: those that are commonly available on Earth today. Unfortunately
I have no ready reference material. Could some kind soul, who knows about
weapon prices, let me know the prices of revolvers, automatics, shotguns,
rifles, SMGs, etc.? Also, the value of a dollar today (compared to the
dollar in 1977, where one Credit was roughly equivalent to a dollar).

Hi,

Although I have no idea what the relationship between 1977, and 1995
US$s is, here are some various weapons prices.

Revolver (good quality): $300-500

"Automatic" (self-loader): $450-600  (a typical Glock \'ll run you $575
here in Albuquerque, for example).  East european autos can be had in
the $150 (Makarov) and up range (9mm P9R, $250).

Shotgun: $250 (pump)

SMG:  $1000 (I\'m not so sure, I don\'t shop for these since I don\'t have
a Class III Federal Firearms Licence)

All of the above are new prices.  Used will be, um, 50% off for good
ones (assuming they aren\'t rare, or otherwise "extra" valuable).

Various semi-auto military styled rifles run from cheap chinese SKSs at
$150 to nice AR-15s at $1000-1500 (a buddy of mine has an HBar----nice
gun to shoot).

A WW2 vintage bolt action can be had for $100 (a British SMLE, or No.1
Mk4), my \'44 Mauser 98kar was $250.

Pistol ammo runs $10 for 50 rounds, rifle ammo is more like $10 for 20
rounds.  Modern rifle ammo is pistol priced (5.56mm for the M-16 is
pistol priced, and AK-74 ammo would be as well).

with round chambered, overall size, and quality.  Here in Iowa, I can buy
new semi-auto pistols from less than $100 to over $1000 - it depends on
quality and the round chambered.  In a similar fashion, a new Chinese SKS
semi-auto military-style rifle sells for about $150 (less for surplus ones
out of storage), but copies of more modern weapons like the M-16 sell for
$2000+ (more now that many are regulated by Federal law). 

  Anyway, just send me some descriptions of the weapons you are 
interested in and I\'ll do my best to match them.

  One thing that has bugged me is that in the Book 2 designs, the amount of 
fuel that a power-plant uses, depends on the ship it is in!
	a Type-A in the Scout uses 20tons in 4 weeks
	a Type-A in the Free Trader uses 10tons in 4 weeks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
And the Scout was 1/2 the size, to boot! Anyways, this little discrepancy
was addressed in \'High Guard\' where PP output (energy points) & fuel con-
sumption was set to the size of the of the PP, expressed as a % of the ships
size, modified by tech level. Your suggestions are pretty good, nonetheless.

15.77 trillion, eh? That means that the naval taxes of the pre-Rebellion

ships...

Are you sure you haven\'t made a decimal error somewhere? I played around
with your figure a little and came up with a rather nonsensical result:

A quadrillion is 1,000,000 trillions, right? How many people would that
support assuming that it was all spent on imperial salaries? Assuming an
average salary of 25.000 Crimp it comes to 40 trillion people, or close
to 3 times the entire populantion of the imperium!

OK, we need not assume that all of it goes to salaries. Much of it may be
going to leasing land and maintaining buildings. But even if only 10% of
it is used on salaries, 1/3rd of the population winds up as Imperial
civil servants (the military is differently funded, remember). But that\'s
not really the essense of the matter. what seems almost incredible to me
is that the yearly profits (not the income) of all LIC corporations is
enough to support the population that creates the wealth _127 times over_.
What do the corporations DO with all that wealth? Stuff it away in a sock?

I have never seen a reference to a MHD coil driving the plasma. If 
anything I would think it would be the other way around. The plasma 
thrust could force its way though an MHD coil to produce power. 

If I am missing some basic concept let me know. 

What would the exhaust of a fusion drive consist of? I remember that 
there was some discussion on how destructive the exhaust could be within 
an atmosphere. It seems that smaller amounts of plasma be used for thrust 
when within an atmosphere. Put the thrust though a diffuser ( Sort of a 
giant hair drier ) and it could be used for lift.

Again, if this concept lacking something basic, please let me know.


TTFN,

Glenn

They probably do what contemporary corporations do with it
-- invest some in themselves, invest some in other
entities, and pay a big chunk of it to their top
executives, who consume some, hoard some, and invest some.
In addition, the form of that wealth is not necessarily
cash or other liquid assets.  A good amount of it is in
land and starships, which use a lot for maintenance and
aren\'t simple to trade. A lot of it is probably in
intangibles, too, like patents, which are also difficult to 
trade because they\'re difficult to value.

I don\'t know what the figures are for U.S. corporations\'
profits versus the cost of supporting the total population,
but I remember reading earlier this year something to the
effect that most CEOs of big U.S. corporations receive
total compensation well in excess of their companies\' total
payroll.  I\'m not sure if it was in the Wall Street Journal 
or The Nation, but it may have been in both.

One figure to include in your calculations of ship number is that the
ratio of support systems to actual ships is of the order of 5:1 or worse.

That is, the naval budget includes starports, depots, shipyards, support
staff (civilians), salaries, ship maintenance, software purchase and
development, R&D, fuel refineries and storage, etc etc. You\'ll find that
in any navy, the amount spent to buy the actual vessels is quite small
in comparison to the overall budget.

Just as an aside, what would be a decent ratio to determine the dollar 
amount of civilian shipping to military combat vessels?  For those of us 
too lazy to fool with the World Tamer\'s Handbook (and I thought that FF&S

Well, in ancient Persia (Alexandrian era) they did percisely that! (well, 
maybe not a sock...)  When Alexander the Great conquered Persia and 
spent what their nobility had stashed away, there was a major economic 
boom...

[Not that I necessarily agree with Bonneville....  What we really need is

No.  A quadrillion is 1,000 trillions.  A quintillion is 1,000,000 trillions.

that a reaction is neither fast or slow, it all depends on the physical     
conditions one is interested in. Take the sun as an example, given the 
abundances of deuterium and tritium and of CNO elements and the temperature
and density in the sun core p-p ends up being the dominant reaction. As the
temperature changes 9e.g. going to more massive stars) CNO reactions may be
more convenient. The fact that a proton in the sun can live a happy life
for a billion years without having to fuse is just because the sun is
roughly at the Gamow peak and protons need to be very unlucky to pass by
tunneling the coulomb barrier. A manmade thermonuclear plasma would almost
certainly be at higher temperatures than the sun to beat the coulomb barrier
without the need of quantum effects. The big difference is that the sun
is in equilibrium while we actually do not want a reactor to be in 
self-sustained equibrium. It is a nice feature to have the reactor turn off
once
something happens...
 
Summarizing the whole trick depends on the nuclear cross-sections for the
various reactions (which have a different dependence on temperature) and
on the heat losses from the plasma. I once asked to a plasma physicist  
(he was director of the theory group at the JET near Oxford) why nobody
is considering CNO fusion given that high temperatures are easier to
achieve than high densities and he gave me a long and complete explanation
that I have essentially forgotten but was based on this kind of arguments.

Hi 
,
	first, the post about p-p fusion being slow is a very valid point.
The reason for it is the 
very low reaction rate in the step where you 
convert a proton into a neutron - i.e. p+p => D + gunk.. This i s done
using the weak nuclear force , which as the name implies , is weak. THis
means that the total cross-section for the reaction above is small - i..e
a very small probability of reaction. which e means that you have to 
collide a LOT of protons to get a decent number of intereactions. It is 
improbable that you could create high enough densities for this to occusr. 
(my delete key isn\'t working right, so please forgive the typos.) 
But y\'all are forgeting one thing - at TL-15 you can control the strong 
as well as the weak nuclear force. (Ok, Ok, that\'s what they say - don\'t
ak me to do the math on it. ) If you could mess with the reaction t rate ,
perhaps p-p fusion would become viable. You could say that at TL-15 they
only know how to do a few things like that , not total control over the
forces at will, which would be messy game-wise. (transmutation of anything,
inckluding lanthanum, and enemies) So, the way I explain it to my players 
is that a TL-15 p-p (actually TL-14, TL-15 does Triple-alpha fusion a s well,
producing _carbon_ , i.e. soot, as exhaust) power plant has a fiedl of 
some kind that speeds up that single crucial step in the chain reaction. note

that it is affecting the WEAK nuclear force here, so it won\'t change 
rates of other kinds of fusion. 
CNO fusion I leave for TL-16 since it requires high temperatures, and 
not much else. 

Interesting point - once you get to triple-alpha fusion (fusing three 
He into carbon) you can start to make some useful elements as a by-product.
Mg, C, N,O, S, and BE are the most probable - which means that your 
starship is a source of raw materials that are sometimes valuable .
How about diamonds for exhaust? It\'s carbon after all... I\'ll be you 
that some worlds don\'t mine their rwa materials, they produce them while
making power at the same time - if you can control certain interaction
rates you could start making _a lot_ of materials. the exact reaction 
trees are beyond me, but they r known pretty well even today..

Now for the Imperial economy ; what is the Gross Imperial Product / capita ?
That , and how it is distributed are important questions.
I am sceptical of these numbers concerning the imperium - they work out
to enormous amounts of money. my players don\'t handle that kind of cash, 
and if anyone in the imperium did, it would be VERY noticeable. 
If the imperium was that stupendiously rich - why on earth are there worlds
that are stuck at TL-8? That by the way is a question I STILL have ty to 
hear a convincing explaination of. Cultural reasons? sure, on a few planets.
but I find it very improbable that there would be so many living in what
comparesd to TL-15 is the Stone Ages. Literally. 7 tech levels....
if someone had the odd 100 trillion credits to invest - don\'t you think a
few of them would invest it in bringing "primitive savages" out of their 
misery? 
The imperium was very rich - but these numbers are too big.

Nice question.  I always wondered why the Imperium - who\'s fundamental 
goal was "to control the space between the stars" - never could get rid 
of all those pirates, even pre-Rebellion.

It may be because the Spinward Marches was such a wild frontier sector... 
but still, those are nukes on those civvie ships! (Even if the ship 
mounts just lasers, it\'s still capable of zapping a tank...)

[Ways to control starship nukes]

The above seems unlikely to work in the free-willing Imperium, but has a 
better chance in the Regency.  The rest seems O.K. (but then again, I\'m 
seriously ignorant in this stuff...)

Well, not all those ships were originally there: a lot of Lucan\'s ships 
came from the massive fleets in Corridor Sector.  

The Core Sector fleets were, however, massively built up, for reasons 
I\'ll get to later...

OK. Now, the main reason why Core Sector\'s fleets were so huge was to 
defend the Emperor from "friendly" Imperial naval fleets from the border 
regions. Remember, there was a 20-year Civil War between 600 and 620, 
which featured massive fleets ripping in from the borderlands to sieze 
the Irridium Throne.  

(That war was started by a large fleet led by Plankwell coming in from 
the Marches (and assassinating the Emperess Josephine), and the war 
ended by another large fleet - Arabellatra\'s, this time - coming in from 
the Marches, and zapping the last Emperor of the Flag in a major naval 
action. NOTE: some feel that Arabellatra was actually the last Flag 
Emperor...)

[Ironic side note: and the Imperium - if it is to live again - will be 
build largely by yet ANOTHER massive number of fleet\'s, streaming in from 
the boonies....  Also, have you ever noticed how the Spinward Marches 
figured so largely in Imperial history?  The emperor\'s never even formed 
a Domain of Deneb till 1116 because they fear their rebellious tendency\'s...]

Now, remembering that the ruling won\'t-even-try-to-spell-it dynasty came 
to power by raw naval might, they are certain to keep a large amount of 
ships in their home territory, so some new power-hungry Admiral from 
the boonies will think twice before sending their fleet\'s Coreward.

If you look closely at Fleet locations, you\'d find that the major ships 
and bases are NOT largely set up close to the Imperial Borders, but 
largely spread out throughout the Imperium, with Corridor Sector and Core 
(And Solomani Rim? I don\'t have  the Rebellion Sourcebook with me...) 
having a good bit more than their fair share of naval power.
  
I suspect that the Corridor and Solomani fleet\'s are for external defense, 
the Core fleet is the "Practorian Guard", but the other fleet\'s are either 
A) composed of smaler vessels, for largely anti-pirate duties or B) big 
and bad, to intimidate the local Imperials into towing the party line - 
and put down the occasional subsector- or sector-wide rebellion. 
Because of how well-equipped even less-important part\'s of the Imperium 
was for the Rebellion, I strongly support reason "B".

Note that Margaret, Brks, and Dulinor (Dukes and Archdukes of low-threat 
zones of the Imperium) were quite capable of holding off the Core fleets, 
despite the fact that they had no military right to that level of 
weaponry, if you are expecting _external_ threats.

(Even Strephon\'s Fraction - who controlled a mindlesly domesticated part of 
the Imperium - was able to hold off Lucan until he attracted too much 
attention. This is the equivelant of New Zealand maintaining 3 divisions of 
heavy armour and 2 aircraft carrier fleets, "just in case".)

..that\'s why I should write out numbers around here. :)  I use the
American number terminology, so a quadrillion is a thousand trillions 
and a quintillion is a million trillions (10^15 and 10^18 respectively).
I know that a fair number of XTML readers do use different conventions
for Really Big numbers, but maybe I was feeling reckless. :) 

I\'ll divide the figures for Imperial GNP by the figures for population to 
get an estimate of Imperial GNP per capita:

(CT/Striker)  According to the old TML article, Derek got a population of
16.73 trillion; he got a GNP of TCr 219500.  That\'s Cr 13100 per person
at 16.73 trillion, or if we assume a population of only 15.73 trillion,
Cr 14000 per person.  

(TNE/WTH)  I estimated population at 15.77 trillion.  Again, assume that
the figures that I came up with earlier are in tech-12 credits.  I got a 
GNP of TCr 538000 in tech-12 starport-B credits, or TCr 430000 in 
Imperial (tech-15 starport-A) credits.  That\'s Cr 27300 per person in 
Imperial credits.

In MegaTraveller, there\'re rules for upkeep costs in the Player\'s Manual.  
Annual upkeep for an "average" person of SocSt 7 is Cr 21000.  This does 
not cover equipment like a new ground car or hand computer; it only 
includes food, lodging, clothes, and incidentals.

A quick look over the WWW found that the USA has a GDP per capita of
US$ 24700, one of the highest of the industrial nations.  The lists
of equipment prices in MegaTraveller suggest that the figures I am
getting above are reasonable. 

(Note:  I think a real economist would use "GDP" to refer to what I am
calling GNP, but they\'re for our purposes virtually identical.)

If you want ammonia oceans at 40 C, you are going to have more than a
"taint" of ammonia.  You are going to have 10 atmospheres (or more, that
is the vapor pressure at Room Temp) of ammonia in the atmosphere (ie
the total amount of ammonia will be 10 times the total atmosphere on
todays earth).

I don\'t know of any theories where ammonia is made from lighting in
significant quantities.  The best way that I know of is to outgas
it from a crust that is faily reducing (I think it has to have
metallic iron in it).  That means, on the Earth at least, that the
core can\'t have formed yet (which is now thought to have occured
very early).

    'body' => 'Hello!

Three weeks ago, I asked whether anybody here on this list would be
interested in a SF PBEM roleplaying game with a background similar to the
classic traveller universe. In the meantime, I decided to start this game
and hope you allow me to post this here a second time.

I\'ll play in my own universe, mainly on the world Jovoo were the characters
have to establish a new colony. Jovoo is located in the so called
border-(sub)sector (the former Tibu Riwek subsector) which was closed for
100 years because of a peace treaty between the Imperium and the Estadh of
Bezidhar. One hundered years ago the empire, that lasts for 986 years now,
nearly was defeated by the overwelming space forces of Bezidhar. But then
the Bezidhar retreated, offering peace. The Imperium accepted and a belt of
no-man\'s land was created, the Border Sector. 

Jovoo was setteled by the Imperials 301 during the Great Expanse. The new
settlers discovered that they weren\'t the first humans on Jovoo. Primitive
humans lived between the ruins of a strange city which "was built by the
gods." 836, Jovoo was attacked by Bezidhar. Three years later they destroyed
the colony and probably killed all settlers that didn\'t ran away after the
first attack. Imperial fleets reconquer Jovoo in the same year 839 but found
no survivors. 848 the Estadh destroyed the outpost on Jovoo again, advancing
further so that the Imperium gave up the world.

Now the Imperium wants to re-colonize the world. Empress Athia instructed
the duke Selrean of Riwek to organize the new settlement. He gave the order
to the new founded department for development of the Salmann Neue
Technologie AG mega corporation. The department is now looking for
management personal for the following divisions:
        - Command (coordination of settlement)
        - Scout (survey and exploration)
        - Security (assure the safety of the colony)
        - Production (farming and animal breeding)
        - Health (medical team)

They are also looking for voluntary settlers (for example citizen mayor,
science person). Payment depends on qualification, minimum will be ICr
4000/month. Settlers get a single bonus of ICr 1000 and aditioal Cr 4000 for
buying Saltec products (SCr).

If YOU are interested, I would be glad to get your reply. Although, there
might be a drawback for most of you, because I will refee most of the game
in (my native) German language. However, it\'s perfectly okay if you use
English to send your turns/descriptions and use this language to
communicate. I would love to have an international flair in this game :-)
You only have to be able to understand (basic) German. Unfortunately it\'s
too time consuming for me to support both languages and currently I\'ve more
German speaking than English speaking players. (And you probably have
already noticed that my English isn\'t perfect) If there\'s a volunteer to do
the translation I would love to hear of.

If you think it\'s worth a try, please feel free to send me a short note.
bye

MHD coils are reversable, push plasma through one and you generate 
electricity.  Put electricity into the coils and you push the plasma along.

Hmm good point, I\'m not sure how to avoid this.

Flipping thru the "Fleet: A Survivor\'s Guide" supplement from West End 
Games: it\'s quite interesting and very well developed.  I tend to treat the 
Imperial Navy as "the Royal Navy with jump drive": however, if you want 
to build a rather darker, uglier, more thinly spread out interstellar 
navy, "Fleet" provides attitude to spare.

Wouldn\'t it be nice if GDW developed the Regency Navy to the same 
extent?  However, seeing how long it took for them to provide the Regency 
book, I\'m not holding my breath...

    'body' => 'As a few people have asked to look at the fuel tables I have constructed 
for book 2 drives.  The consumption details still need a little work, 
they are based on the "Beltstrike" module GDW produced.



The fuel use table below gives the fuel tankage required for each type of
drive.  In some cases this is more efficient than High Guard, in others
less so.  I will confess to a little bias, I like small ships so the jump
fuel table is very efficient at the lower end for the first few drives.

This changes the basic starship designs;

The Type-S Scout has the following changes...

    1.  Fuel capacity is now 33 tons (two jumps plus 4 weeks) 
    2.  Cargo capacity is now 6 tons

  The effect of the changes means that the Scout has a little more cargo
capacity, but the main change is the range.  The Scout can now perform two
jumps at maximun range, this has two advantages

    1.  The Scout can now traverse the X-Boat route, albeit at half the
       speed of an X-Boat 
    2.  The Scout can make a return trip of jump-2 in range without
       refueling.

  These two effects are compatable with the Scouts role as part of the
X-Boat service and as an exploration craft.  In fact they make the
Scout more viable in these roles.

The Type-A Free Traider changes as follows...

    1.  Fuel capacity is now 18 tons
    2.  It now carries an Air-Raft
    3.  It now has a cargo capacity of 90 tons.
       The original 82 tons hold, and a`Special Cargo Area\' of 8 tons
       attached to the main hold.

  These changes make the Type-A compatable with that portrayed in the
`Starship Operators Manual\'.  The increse in cargo capacity (8 tons) is the
size of the "Special Cargo Area" on the upper cargo deck.  See the plans in
the `Starship Operators Manual\'.

The actual consumption is as follows...
  Jumps use the fraction of the fuel as the fraction of the jump to
        the jump rating of the starship.

  Power Plants use fuel as follows, 0.007 tons per day,  
        (0.05 tons per week) for each drive letter.

        Book 2 power plants produce an actual output of 1ep per ton of
        fuel tankage required.

incidents that came out of the first Traveller campaign
I ever played in.  It was Classic Trav, started before
Spinward Marches Campaign came out , thus
the references to non-Imperial empires.  It made
for a good story, and it could fit in a pocket TNE
empire just fine.  Hope this starts a thread.
The Original Incident was, well, incidental to playing 
the old "Traveller Adventure 1:Kinunir" module...]

----
"So you want to know the truth behind the accident that destroyed
the Confederation\'s capital city, eh?" Bianca Mordell takes a drag
from the Terran cigarette you gave her.  "Immunity from prosecution,
of course, and get me off this damn prison planet!"  You nod,
saying you\'ll do what you can.  You\'re pretty sure you can get 
her sentence commuted; she was convicted of illegal psionics use,
and the political climate has changed considerably since then.

"We were hired to get some information on some piece of military
 hardware mounted on the then-obsolete Kinuir class warship 
used by the Confederation.  In those days, we were citizens
of the Fourteen Worlds -- this was before the 3rd Imperium
moved in and "assimilated" us -- and the Nebular Planetary
Confederation were our closest neighbors and enemies.  Okay,
 I admit it, we were hired as freelance spies...

"We being myself, recently resigned from the 14 Worlds Navy,
my brother, former Army Sgt. Brian Mordell, and ex-Marine,
ex-Commando Sgt. Sherman Bolo Lee -- deadly in a fight,
a complete sociopath, and dumb as a post.  Not that my late
brother was all that smart, either.  And then there was that
fool whose name I forget who caused the whole mess.
Former Scout Service puke, if I remember correctly; I believe
it was his ship we used for our trip to Regina.  Lord knows,
when it came to brains, he made Sherman look brilliant.

"It\'s a matter of public record now that Sherman is wanted
for assorted murders as well as illegal psionics, so I 
suppose I can admit that he was also a telepath.  Remember
in those days just being a psi was a capital offense in
some places, so those of us who were kept our own kind
of \'Masquerade\', so to speak.  Why did I, a loyal officer of
the 14 Worlds Navy, get psi training?  I never was brain-
washed into blind prejudice, and I wanted an edge when
I went freelance."  She takes another drag from the cigarette.

"Before the Impy Navy moved in, Regina was the capital of 
our local opposition, the Confederation.  It had the usual facilities:
starport, shipyards, navy bases, etc.  In one of those shipyards
was the hull of a scrapped Kinunir.  Our plan was we would 
get pictures, etc from that hulk. We figured on bypassing the 
yard\'s security systems with the help of a "minor diversion".

"Sherman, former demolitions expert among other things , whipped 
a nasty little time-bomb and gave it to our moron Scout friend,
telling him, "We need a diversion; put it someplace delicate but 
important."  Off went the moron on his part of the mission, and 
off the rest of us went  on our part of the mission; Sherman
played bodyguard while I actually took the measurements and 
pictures of the military hardware -- okay, I\'ll admit it, the Black Globe
mount, which I know something about and had the experience to 
analyze -- and Brian played "high cover" from a nearby rooftop
overlooking the scrapyard.

"Infilitration of the scrapyard and the old starship hulk went just fine, 
until our diversion went into effect...

"Moron, with bomb, finds someplace he thinks is "delicate but 
important" ... the starport\'s super-refined hydrogen tank farm. 
 Moron plants bomb at base of hydrogen tank. Moron doesn\'t 
seem to know that liquid hydrogen is explosive. Moron has never
 heard of the concept of "sympathetic detonation". Time bomb 
explodes.  Tank explodes.  Tanks, plural, explode.  Starport 
disappears in not-quite-nuclear fireball.  Nasty firestorm.  
Blast levels buildings for blocks (many blocks) around.  
The mess is just starting.

"I did mention there was a Navy base and starport there, didn\'t I?  
There were several ships sitting around on launch pads, in 
various stages of launch readiness.  Several of them had pilots
who tried desperately to escape the expanding fireball...
One ship\'s soon-to-be dead Navy pilot in sheer desperation punches in
full fusion rockets IN ATMOSPHERE!  He almost made it, too.  
Unfortunately for everyone else, the fusion rockets obliterate what\'s
left of the starport and burns a nice trench through half the city as 
Navy ship crashes from explosion damage anyway.  A large 
warship, fully loaded with armament, tries to get off the pad on normal
takeoff jets, and doesn\'t even it make away from the starport; when
it explodes, radioactive debris from all of its nuclear missile warheads 
is sprayed across the city...  Another ship trying to take off loses
control and crashed into the continental rectenna grid for the solar power
sats, knocking out all power for the city and the continent.

"As for us, well, the multi-thousand-ton armored hull of the Kinunir lurched
about 
four feet to the left,  but protected our hides (that\'s Sherman and I). We
pick 
ourself up with a few bruises, and wonder what the hell happened.  Brian,
who was on top of the building does not fare so well as half the building 
falls out from under him, and the other half falls on top of him. Moron is
never 
seen again, presumed vaporized.

"I did say the two of us were telepaths, weren\'t we?  That was how we found
Brian in time.  He was literally on his next-to-last breath when we dug him
out and
got him some medical help.  He was eventually put back together, but he was
on
the critical list for a long time afterward."  She looks grim.  "And if he
had died 
there, Sherman would not have murdered him later, but that\'s a different
story."
  
"We brought the scoutship down from orbit and helped with relief
operations (it was the least we could do, after all).  Everyone in the city,
including us, was in such a state of shock, that no one noticed for days 
that we were flying around in an air/raft brightly painted with the 
"Fourteen Worlds Scout Service" logo! (Remember, we\'re in the
capital city of our main enemy nation, which has just blown up)
 We eventually noticed, went "ohmygod!" and carefully draped a
 couple of army blankets over the logo.  Somebody always remained
 with the air/raft to make sure the blankets didn\'t slip...

"And that, my friend, is the true story of how the capital of
the Nebular Planetary Confederation was blown up."

A postscrypt: Dennis Matheson, our Traveller Referee, told us that
he recounted the story of this incident to Mark Miller at a con once.
I hear that Mark was suitably appalled....

I was wondering if any of you who have more Latin than I (my high
school Latin teachers are undoubtedly tsk-ing right now) might
translate the motto on the 2610 Rule of Man quarter-credit coin in the
Solomani Alien Module. It appears to be:

DOMINATUS HOMINIS SPLENDET SPLENDIDE AMPLIUS QUAM GLORIAM ASTRIBUS

I have always found the picture of this coin to be one of the more
compelling illustrations in all Traveller works; a relic of a
long-lost optimistic age when the uppity Terrans thought they could
bend anything to their will, but learned the hard way that the Vilani
ran their empire the way they did for good reasons.

even trust himself) to judge whether or not a given order might work against 
the interests of his own oyntrip.

Now, if one oyntrip conquored another, the conquoring leaders would probably 
be obeyed without question once they were established.  This would be similar

to the situation in RANGER: 2300, where conquored Ebers actually need the 
direction of their conquorers in order to survive.

Combat in MegaTraveller is task-based like most dice-
rolling is in that game. This means that the standard rules
for tasks are in effect with combat tasks too.

Unless a task has the "(unskilled ok)" qualifier, the task is
meant to be performed by skilled individuals. If the person
attempting the task does not have the skill, the difficulty
level of the task automatically increases by one.

For example, if (skillless) Joe Caveman picks up the ACR,
the normal "to hit" task may be routine, but Joe has to try to
make a difficult task with only his dex as a DM - a severe
penalty!

"The Rule of Man will shine brightly to the stars, more fully than (our?)
glory."

I myself would have said "AMPLIVS QVAM GLORIAM ASTRVM," "more fully than
the glory _of_ the stars," which would seem to make more sense.  But perhaps
there aren\'t as many Latin scholars about in 2610....

Speaking of which, I\'ve been working on-and-off on a historical campaign
set amid the Interstellar Wars, using 2300 AD\'s Near Star Map and the
excellent list available of correspondences between Traveller\'s 2D map
and the actual stars (whose author, alas, I forget).  Are there any good
"historical" references on 21st century Terra and the Solomani-Vilani
contact/conflict beyond the Classic supplements 8, 10, and 11 ("Library
Data" & "Solomani Rim"), Alien Module 6, and the MegaTraveller "Solomani &
Aslan"?  I also suspect that DGP\'s introduction of the belated "Plague of 
Duskir" would have shown up earlier, possibly provoking an ethical crisis
among the Terran Secretariat, and some economic theorizing ("Do we need
all these Vilani to support the war effort, or do we care if they all die
of rhinoviri and strep?").  When it\'s more presentable I\'ll announce a
Web page -- it\'ll probably use a bastardization of GURPS rules with
tech designs from TNE\'s FF&S and more-or-less standard Traveller
astronomic information.

The AMPLUS seems to have some odd spacing going on that almost looks
like an "I".  My high school Latin is horribly rusty, but it might
translate freely to something like

HOW GLORIOUS THE MIGHTY RULE OF MAN SPLENDIDLY GLEAMS WITH STARS

which seems to fit with the Zeus-and-Galaxy clutching lightning bolts
(and a dagger?) on the obverse of the coin.  It\'s been a while, so
I may be seriously scrambling the word order changes....  

There\'s some interesting place names in the Marches that may have
meaning in Latin.  Regina means queen, and it\'s a beautiful world 
that\'s very powerful in the sector.  Mora means delay or stop-off, 
and Mora is the gateway to the sector, a place settled as a base
for ships to stop-over as they enter the Marches.  Vilis means 
cheap or worthless -- but the Sword Worlders don\'t think so, and 
have gone to war with the Imperium (another Latin word!) over it.

Knowing that Vilani has the phonology (roughtly) of Sumerian I decided
to see if any of the Vilani names we know have real meanings. Sure
enough, they do. "Dingir" is a Sumerian word for "deity"; in Akkadian
inscriptions the sign for "dingir" (or the equivalent word in
Akkadian) is prefixed to deity names. "Shuruppak" was an actual city
in Mesopotamia. "Enlugal", Vland\'s capital city\'s name, contains the
element "lugal", a Sumerian word for "king". There are probably more
that escape me right now.

Auction rules are as follows:

3. All items are in excellent or good condition, except as
noted.  Nevertheless, all items are to be accepted "as is."
If your idea of condition is different from mine, that\'s
unfortunate.  (To me excellent means as it would appear on
the store shelf; good means no obvious damage other than that
associated with age.  A "good" item produced in 1979 will
most likely not be in as good condition as a "good" item
produced in 1994.)

4. Items may be bid upon individually, but the winning bid
will always be awarded so as to maximize my return.  For
example, if I had a $50 bid for one issue of *Challenge*
and a $55 dollar bid for the entire set (assuming no other
bids), the $55 bidder would get the entire set.  If I had
a third bid of $10 for a different issue than that of the
first bidder, I would sell the two individual issues (but
would most likely get back with the "set" bidder to ascertain
interest in the remaining issues).

5. Winning bidders will pay *all* shipping costs which will
be determined after the auction.  Do not include shipping
costs in your bid.  (Winning bidders will be able to select

There was a CT boxed game, I think "Interstellar War" was the title, which 
dealt with the Imperial invasion of the Sol system.  That should have 
something more.

Since you brought up the 2300AD Near Star Map, is there any way I can get 
hold of a copy without breaking copyright laws?  I managed to get a copy of 
TRAVELLER:2300 used, but w/o the star map.  I really like the game, 
especially the potential for exploration and world creation (hence, I\'d 
really rather not get the material from COLONIAL ATLAS--even if it were 
available on this planet).

Since Vilis was colonized from the Sword Worlds it ought to be the name
of some legendary weapon. Not necessarily a sword - the names \'Mjolnir\'
and \'Gungnir\' indicates that they were runnig out of sword names (their
data base seems to have a few holes in it).

A good reference is the GDW wargame "Imperium" that contains a simulation
of the Solomani-Vilani contact/conflict with yearly turns and a cool mix of
war and peace taking place during the course of the game.  It charts the 
growth of the enthusiastic but undergunned early Solomani fleet into an

war machine eating up parts of the Imperium.  This game also includes a
background
booklet on the 1st Imperium (not much you haven\'t seen before, about 6pages

I think you probably mean "Invasion: Earth" which details the final invasion 
of Earth at the end of the Solomani Rim War, approximately 3000 years after 
the "Intersteller Wars".

There is a reduced copy of the starmap on the backs of the rules books!
Or do you mean you are missing the data booklet that comes with the map.

I\'ve got the old first edition (large box) and that doesn\'t contain a 1st

Hoo boy! What a question! I never thought of that before,
although it is very relevant. Let me see...

(All the following are my personal speculations on the
subject, based on my knowledge of how starships work -
mostly gleaned from the SOM - and not all that official nor
semi-official. I hope it will be of some use anyway.)

As I view jump-drives, they just burn off a lot of energy in the
transition fase and none thereafter. No energy is required to
exit jump space - this happens automatically and randomly.
We know this, because the time of jump exit cannot be
controlled precisely.

So how is the jump field maintained during jump, if no
energy is used to maintain it? As far as I remember, the
jump grid is superconducting (makes sense anyway), so
if this is true, the jump field would be automatically
maintained.

How does the ship exit jump space if no energy is used?
That is a tough one. I\'ve always had the impression that the
ship is forced out of jump space by some mechanism or
law of nature. Maybe jump space rejects a foreign body
after some time (approximately 7 days). Now, I\'m not
saying that jump space is alive or anything, I just couldn\'t
come up with a better explanation. Can anyone think of
something better (off course, you may not agree at all that
no energy is used to exit jump space)?

If what I have just written is true, the answer to the question
about what happens if you disconnect the power while in
jump space is: Nothing!

For a gaming reason (at least), I would just hate the idea
that all should die, or become stranded in deep space or
something just by the flick of a contact, so my argumenation
has been running somewhat with that in mind.

One of the wonderful things about the New Era is that GDW is no longer 
willing to provide world generation rules for alien races.  I have VIlani 
+ Vargr, and will soon get Solomani + Aslan.  

However, I lack world generation rules for K\'ree, Hivers, Droyne, and 
Zhodani systems.  If anyone is willing to sent me a copy, I\'d be very
thankful.

Based upon DGP\'s Starship Operator\'s Manual: Nothing happens. It\'s shut
down almost immediately after transition. Once you\'re in jump, only damage
to the lanthanum hull grid (which is used to create the jump bubble)
remains at a charged quantum state, and decays after about a week.

If you damage the grid, you could be exposed to the nature of jump space,
which tends to drive sapient carbon based life forms insane.

Jump is a deterministic event: your fate is determined when the ship first
transitions: Where you are going and when you\'ll arrive; and also if you\'ll
experience different time than the universe as a whole. And it only lasts a
minute or two!

Damaging the hull grid is a great way of eliminating a ship\'s crew and
passengers, though. They\'ll be insane before they drop out if you can
damage the grid enough. Just make certain you\'re not aboard...

Happy trails!

Well, I  think David Summers has hit on the trillion dollar question re:
Traveller. It is the question of whether or not one is able to travel faster
than the speed of light ( or very close to the speed of light without
incurring the effects of relativity) in the Traveller universe. The
playability of Traveller relys on one being able to travel vast distances in
space while having the same amount of time pass on board the craft,on the
world of departure, and on the destination world. In effect, the traveller
universe is a Newtonian universe in which astronomical bodies are separated
only by distance while Relativity tells us that actually the only thing
keeping worlds apart in space is time. The common Imperial timeline is a
playability feature that is a physical impossibility. The shiptime kept by
the ships computer would be the only time of importance. 

I therefore run my games on the premise that jump drives are a combination
burn and field generating drive. The field generated alters the dimensions
of space-time creating a refined and controllable worm-hole like feature
through which the craft can travel. The field creates a situation in which
the point of departure and destination can locally co-exist for the jump
travel time. 

The reason for keeping ship travel time to seven days seems a little
arbitrary to me, always has. I can see no reason why, using my own vision of
the jump drive, a ship can\'t have a sufficiently advanced jump drive that is
able to generate a field that will momentarily make the points of departure
and destination co-exist exactly making the ship travel time zero.
I also see no reason why,and consider it most likely that,  at the lower end
of the starship drive technology spectrum there would be a starship drives
of the purely  conventional burn type as outlined in FF&S. These ships,
however, could not take part in the space opera that is the Imperium or the
Coalition etc. They would slowly accelorate to close to the speed of light
and would be destined to never return to their home again due to the effects
of relativity. These ships would take years to reach their nearest
destinations.

In my vision of jump drives there is nothing random involved. The navigation
and creation of the temporary worm-hole is tightly calculated. In FF&S there
is a descriptioin of randomly occuring worm-holes of various natures. These
can be seen as the naturally occuring variety of what my jump drive
generators create. One could even speculated that some of these apparently
naturally occuring worm-holes are in fact the result of illformed generator
fields of misjumped craft.
The potential for misjump is great and the possible causes many. The burn
drive could fail trapping the ship in the wormhole longer than expected. The
generator may fail, misshaping the field or collapsing mid-flight (possibly
leaving the craft trapped in a mobius loop or some such) or the navicomputer
may fail. The effects are equaly many and thankfully still left to the
discretion of the Referee.

If the jump drive failled completely, as in the situation David asked about,
I would say that the field collapsed and the ship would be left drifting on
a fixed vector in free space light years from a world of any kind. The
manuever drive would not be sufficient to accelorate the ship to anything
close to the speed of light for a conventional flight to safety, so one may
as well get new characters. There is nothing out here but space hulks and
even they are millions of kms apart.

Its been fun giving you the run down on how I like to run my Traveller
universe re: stardrives. Hope it helps.

  Based on other canonical sources, the impact is illness rather than 
insanity - jumpsickness is almost always fatal.  Note that uptures in the 
jump grid can allow jumpspace to intrude into the ship, sucking folks out 
into the void.  Not a nice way to go.

  I don\'t have access to my back issues of Challenge, but there is a 
Traveller News Service report that referes to the first person to survive 
jump outside a ship (in a vac suit).  Perhaps someone with this info can 
look this up.

  It is possible to repair the breeches in the grid during flight, though 
it is tough.  The starship operators manual talks about this, I think.

  Well, you could add this, but then you don\'t have Traveller, with the 
limits on the speeds of messages and the fuedal structure of society.  As 
long as you consign this to a high tech level, it\'d be okay, but not at 
levels 17-.

  See the previous post about material from STarship Operators Manual.  
Much of what you say fits, especially the importance of calculation, but 
jumpfields are established in the begining of the flight.  Collapse in 
the middle of the flight is rare, and related to physical, rather than 
power, failure.

   Page 25, Mustering Out Benefit Objects, Corsair (correction): When a
pirate character receives a Corsair ship as a benefit, it is wholly owned
upon the first receipt of the benefitQno payments are ever made. No
matter how many times the Corsair is received as a benefit, only one ship
is received. This is consistent with the statement made on page 19
second column, under Starships.
   Page 28, middle column, Economic skill (correction): Economic (includes)
Admin, Broker, Legal, Trader.
   Page 38, left column, Rifleman Skill (addition): Rifleman (Includes
Autorifle, Carbine, Rifle, Shotgun).
   Page 51, Military Occupational Specialty Table (correction): Die roll 2
under Infantry, Commando, and Ship\'s troops should be Cbt Rifleman skill,
not Gun Cbt.
   Page 53, left column, Assignment Resolution, Survival (correction):
Combat missions are battle, siege, and strikeQnot police action,
counterinsurgency, or raid.
   Page 54, Assignment table (correction): Change die roll 3 from Shore
Duty to Frozen Watch. This makes the table consistent with the Frozen
Watch paragraph under Special Rules on    Page 53.
   Page 60, left column, Initial Activities, Draft (correction): Delete the
reference to the draft. In MegaTraveller, Merchant characters never enlist
via the draft. Flyers (a military career) have replaced Merchants (a
non-military career) in this regard.
   Page 63, Skill Tables, Free Trader, Business column (correction): Change
the die roll 5 entry from Steward to Pilot. With this change, a Free Trader
can now acquire pilot skill.
   Page 63, Skill Table Notes (omission): Merchant Life available to all
characters. Shipboard Life available to all (including Free Traders) except
Sales and Admin Departments. Officer Skills available to rank O0+.
Merchantile Skills available to all (including Free Traders) except
Engineering Department. Master Skills open to Deck Department rank O4+.

   Page 67, left column, Surprise (correction): In the referee\'s paragraph of
the task for determining surprise, change "If any mishap occurs..." to "If
exceptional failure occurs...". Thus if the attacking party gets exceptional
failure on the surprise task roll, the defending party has surprise instead.
   Page 67, Definitions Sidebar, Distance Scale (correction): The last line
of the Distance Scale definition should read: "Therefore this weapon\'s
danger space is one square in the 15m scale."
   Page 68, left column, Interrupts (correction and clarification): The
sentence should read: Unintelligent animals never perform an intelligent
interrupt. An animal that by nature leaps at its prey will interrupt by
jumping at a man, even though that man is fully protected by combat
armor. An animal that by nature flees at loud noises will interrupt to run
away from a defenseless human who is yelling at the top of his lungs.
   Page 69, right column, hand-to-hand combat tasks (suggestion): If you
prefer, you can combine the two hand-to-hand combat tasks into this
single task:
To hit another unit with a hand-to-hand attack:
Routine, Off=Wpn skill, Str; Def=Wpn skill, Wpn Def (confrontation)
Referee: If the attacker is unskilled, increase the difficulty of this task
by one level; if the defender is unskilled, decrease the difficulty of this
task by one level.
   The defender may use his weapon (whatever weapon he currently has) for
defense. Note that the defender may later conduct a hand-to-hand attack
with his weapon if he has not yet taken his turn. The defender may
attempt to preempt the attack by interrupting the attacker (note: use Dex
in place of movement speed as the DM when interrupting a hand-to-hand
attack in this manner). The defender may not attempt to interrupt anyone
other than the attacker.
   Failure means the defender blocked or otherwise avoided the attack.
   Page 70, left column, hand-to-hand interrupts (clarification): A unit
undergoing a hand-to-hand attack can try to interrupt the attacker; in this
case, use the interrupting unit\'s Dex as the DM in place of movement speed.
In effect, two units locked in hand-to-hand combat may interrupt each
other, but no other units.
   Page 72, weapon enhancements (addition): A character who remains
stationary for the combat round and can brace against something may use
the gyrostable difficulty profile when firing his weapon.
   Page 74, Personal Armor table (correction): The Reflec armor value
should be [10], indicating that the armor value applies only against laser
fire.
   Page 74, Large Blades table (omission): The block missing values are:
Sword 3, Cutlass 2, Broadsword 2.
   Page 76, Slug Throwers (correction): The following are the correct

   Page 87, Corridor Sidebar (correction): Varian is incorrectly identified
as the acting emperor. Varian\'s younger brother Lucan is in fact the acting
emperor; Varian lost his life in the ensuing struggle following emperor
Strephon\'s assassination.
   Page 93, Armor Values (correction): The values for starships are
incorrect. The correct values are: Starship Interior Bulkhead, 30; Starship
Exterior Hull, 40.
   TAS FORM 2 , Homeworld Summary, Starport column (correction): Starport
D/F should be C/F.
   TAS FORM 2 , Homeworld Summary, Law Level column (correction): Add a
block below "High" labeled "Extreme."
Referee\'s Manual
   Page 16, Universal World Profile Diagram (correction): The Gas Giants
and Planetoid Belts labels have been switched. Planetoid belts comes
first, then Gas Giants. In the example shown, Roup has 2 Planetoid Belts
and 3 Gas Giants.
   Page 22, World Size table (correction): The column headings should be:
General Description, Minimum Diameter, and Maximum Diameter.
   Page 22, World Atmosphere table (correction): The column headings
should be: General Description, Minimum Pressure, and Maximum Pressure.
   Page 23, World Physical Data table, Code Hydrographics (correction): The
second entry Desert (code 1) should be Dry World instead.
   Page 26, Step 9 (correction): Rather than determining the companion
star\'s orbit distance in AU, roll 1D+13 to determine the companion star\'s
orbit number (see the Orbital Distances table, below).
   Page 26, Step 10 (addition): When returning to step 3 from step 10,
apply a DM of -1 to the die roll on the System Nature table.
   Page 28, Step 22 (correction): The step should be labeled Gas Giants, not
Empty Orbits.
   Page 29 (omission): The Orbital Distances table (for reference only: used
to convert an orbit number to an actual orbit distance in AUs or in
kilometers) was inadvertently omitted. Here it is.
  ORBITAL DISTANCES

   Page 35, Step 10 (correction): The Animal Behaviors table, Omnivore
column heading should be To Attack, To Flee, Typical Speed. These
headings apply to Omnivores, Carnivores, and Scavengers.
   Page 42, Step 8 (addition): If a legal encounter occurs, go to step 10d.
   Page 42, Step 9 (addition): If a random encounter occurs, go to step 10d.
   Page 43, Step 10d (addition): After determining encounter range, if the
Encounter includes an NPC, go to step 11.
   Page 45, left column, Interpersonal Bribery (correction): SOC 2 should be
Social Standing squared.
   Page 50, Step 5 (clarification): Lot size is given in displacement tons.
To convert to kiloliters, multiply by 13.5. Optionally, use the following
rolls to get the lot size in kiloliters directly: Major Cargos: 150 + (1Dx10).
Minor Cargos: 80 + (1Dx10). Incidental Cargos: 1Dx10.
   Page 50, Step 6 (correction): The Trade Classifications table, Fl code
line should be Atmosphere A+, Hydrographic 1+. The Size entry should be
"Q".
   Page 53, Step 5 (addition): Add the following results to Negotiation:
Passive Uncooperation, +1000; Active Uncooperation, goods withdrawn
from sale. This adds some detrimental effects to negotiation,
representing the cargo purchaser\'s inability to drive a hard bargain.
   Page 62, Step 3 (correction): The price column is in thousands of credits
on the Small Craft Hull Table.
   Page 63, Step 5 (correction): Configuration 1 should be labeled
Needle/Wedge. The Airframe Column for Configuration 6, Dome/Disk
should be x3.0, not x0.5. The Price Mod column for Configuration 7,
Irregular should be x 0.5 not x.05.
   Page 63, Step 6 (clarification): The armor value mass factor is in fact
the armor value mod (refers to the Mod column on the Armor Table in step
9).
   Page 64, Step 11 (correction): The second and third sentences should
read: If the vehicle has a chassis UCP of 0.2 or less, it cannot be enclosed;
occupants must ride on its outside. If the chassis UCP is more than 0.2,
the vehicle is enclosed unless selected otherwise.
   Page 64, Step 1 (corrections and clarifications): The table heading is
misleading. The Power Out, Weight, and Price is per kiloliter of volume;
thus the Power Out, Weight, and Price of each table entry is for 1 kiloliter
of power plant volume. The volume column should be labeled Minimum
Volume, this is the smallest volume to which the power plant may be
built.
   The tech level 12 Fusion Power Plant Kl/Hour entry should be 0.003, not
0.005 as shown.
   The tech level 17 Antimatter Power Plant Kl/year entry should be 250.0,
not 25.0 as shown.
   Also, further testing of vehicle designs using the hydrocarbon fueled
power plants has revealed that they are too inefficient as given. More
acceptable values are given below:
                        ----Per Kiloliter----  Minimum
 TL Description          Power Out Weight Price  Volume Kl/Hour Fuel Type
 5 Internal Combustion     0.25     1     1000   0.005  0.030  Hydrocarbons
 6 Improved Internal Comb  0.40     1     2000   0.001  0.025  Hydrocarbons
 7 Gas Turbine             0.60     1     5000   0.005  0.040  Hydrocarbons
 8 MHD Turbine             0.80     1    10000   0.001  0.035  Hydrocarbons
  Antimatter power plants use fuel pods: a special self-contained fuel
package that consists of a measured quantity of antimatter enclosed in a
strong artificial gravity "bottle". The bottle\'s gravity fields are maitained
by an array of superbatteries. Fuel pods are the heart of an antimatter
power plant, and they typically provide fuel for up to a year before needing
replaced. Fuel pods also have a minimum size to which they may be built:
    Minimum
TL  Volume (Kl)
17  2.000
18  0.800
19  0.200
20  0.050
21  0.005
  Antimatter power plant output increases dramatically as the ability to
safely contain a progressively larger anihilation mass occurs. This means
that a given fuel pod is "burned up" at a progressively faster rate,
however.
   On the Fuel Cells table, the headings for the two rightmost columns should
be: Price, and Fuel Liters/Hour.
   Page 64, Step 2 (correction): On the Small Plants Efficiency Decrease
table, the Volume column entry for Turbines is missing. It should be 0.10-.
   Page 65, Step 5 (clarifcation): An anti-grav unit requires a gravity well
to push against, so an anti-grav maneuver drive is less efficient at 10
diameters and beyond. The effective maneuver number of the craft drops
by 50% at 10 diameters and beyond; for example, a maneuver-2 drive drops
to a maneuver-1, and a maneuver-1 drops to a maneuver-0.5. Thruster
units do not suffer these effects.
   Page 66, Step 7 (correction): The minimum volume percentages should
be: Wheels: 1.5%, Tracks: 2.0%. Greater volume reduces ground pressure,
which in turn increases off-road speed.
   Page 66, Step 9 (correction): The Avionics table headings should be:
Volume, Weight, and PowerQnot Power, Volume, and Weight.
   Page 67, Step 4 (correction): The price note should say: If TL8, x2.
   Page 68, Step 3 (correction): The prices for Radar should be: Weight x
Cr1,000,000. All-weather Radar is Weight x Cr1,500,000.
   Page 68, Step 5 (clarification): An EMM package does not mask the
craft\'s emissions when it uses active electromagnetic sensors. Also, an
EMM package does not mask the craft from active sensor scans conducted
by other craft.
   Page 68, Step 7 (correction): The weights for tech level 10 and 11
regional Ladars are incorrect. They should be TL10, 0.016 and TL11, 0.008.
   Page 70, Step 15 (correction): The power requirement for the EMS Active
Array should be: Weight in tons x 10.
   Page 71, Step 3 (correction): The price column and hardpoints column for
the Meson Guns table are incorrect. The correct values are:
MESON GUNS (SPINAL MOUNT)

   Page 72, Step 6 (correction): The hardpoints for bays should be 10, not
100.
   Page 72, Step 8 (correction): The TL 9 column should be empty for the
Plasma Gun, Fusion Gun, and Repulsor. The prices for these weapons are
missingQthe correct values are: Plasma Gun, MCr5; Fusion Gun, MCr8; and
Repulsor, MCr6.
   Page 73, Step 13 (correction): Each Plasma Gun Turret can have 1 or 2
weapons, not just 1.

weapons, not just 1.

missiles. ROF only applies during personal combat: in space combat, use
the battery-round.
   Page 75, Step 20 (clarification): The Indirect Fire range lists a range
band and a number in parentheses. The number in parentheses is the actual
range in kilometers. Where the range band indicates a general range band
for "effect", the exact range in kilometers is much more accurate. We
recommend you use either the range band or the exact range in kilometers
in a given combat sessionQdon\'t use both. Mixing and matching range
methods can be confusing.
   Page 77, Step 22 (correction): The indirect fire range in kilometers for a
10cm bore is 20, not 22. Likewise, the indirect fire range in kilometers
for a 24cm bore is 60, not 90.

the task for determining surprise, change "If any mishap occurs..." to "If
exceptional failure occurs...". Thus if the attacker gets exceptional failure
on the surprise task roll, the defender has surprise instead.

I have, if anyone needs it, the Excel spreadsheet with all the stars from
the near star list in it.  I think i got it from the archives, tho
(accessible from any of the good traveller web pages).
Anyone have a good program to display them in 3d?  I used to have a program
called MacSpin (when i used my schools macs).  Now i have a dos machine, and
haven\'t been able to find anything similar.  Sure, one can plot them into
harvard graphics or corelchart, but i liked the free-rotate feature of macspin.

Please let me know.

1.      DROYNE LEADERSHIP

In Xboat 400, David P. Summers asked:
>A question about the Droyne and the workings of the caste system.  A Droyne
>of another caste will obey the orders of the leader caste without question.
>What if the leader comes from another Oytrip?

The general rule is this: within an oytrip (community), the leaders will be
obeyed. Across oytrip boundaries, however, things differ.

"On an internal level, the bonds of caste are such that all the leaders work
together for the common good. But such co-operation rarely extends from one
oytrip to another, for their leaders are unable to recognise the concept of
themselves answering to one another. The oytrip\'s needs come first; if a
resource is in short supply, a leader will do what it can to secure that
resource for its people". (_Droyne_, p 9).

This idea seems to be based on the primary motivation of the Protectors (from
Larry Niven\'s various Known Space texts). The difference is that they only
fight when they have to, and they do not conduct pre-emptive strikes.

In order to overcome this leader inflexibility (and incapacity for
negotiation), the Sport sub-caste of Speaker was developed. They "emerged as
a corps of professional diplomats. Sports could present their oytrip\'s needs
to their opposite numbers, who in turn could use the normal processes of
appeal to convey those needs upward to the leadership". (_Droyne_, pp 9-10).

The rule seems to be that a leader from outside the oytrip would NOT
be obeyed by any member of the oytrip. However, a Speaker-Sport could make
an Appeal to the oytrip member. Now, the Droyne were never updated to MT,
but resolution of the Appeal would have to be an interpersonal task -
probably
in a similar fashion to the use of Liaison skill, but at a higher Difficulty
level. The Appeal skill is shown below:

"Appeal: the ability to address persons within the Droyne caste system with
requests or suggestions, and to attempt to have them implemented.
Given the fact that there is a rigid caste system for the Droyne, there must
be some provision for inter-caste communication. Appeal is that provision.
Generally, Appeal allows the individual to present a cast to a leader or
caste superior and to be listened to. The request is taken on its merits,
with some DM based on skill for reactions and receptiveness". (_Droyne_, p
20).

The only Droyne who can receive Appeal skill from character generation are
Drones, Sports and Leaders.

Under the Reactions table, the rules are:
"Within a caste, Liaison works on inferiors# and Appeal works on superiors.
Between castes, Liaison works on all but Leaders; Appeal works with Leaders".
(_Droyne_, p 36). #A sub-note adds "and equals" to the Liaison list.

I would tend to make tasks by krinaytsyuni ("the deathless" - Droyne who are
outside of an oytrip, eg. most Droyne PC\'s) one level more difficult. This
is based on:
- the scorn placed on these individuals by Droyne who live in oytrips (SEE
  _Droyne_, p 9);
- the fact that krinaytsyuni are included on the "Out-Community Reactions
  Table" (_Droyne, p 39);
- that when the rules talk about a contact who is "Permanently loyal", they
  say the "_even_ a krinaytsyuni can Appeal to such a friend with some hope
  of response" (_Droyne, p 39), ie. they are lowest on the list.

Also note that many negative reaction results can be submitted to a
prediction
by the coyns. "A new reaction roll is made (with all standard DM\'s) plus any
modifiers resulting from the coyns." (_Droyne_, p 36).

..by the way, also note that the rules state that a failed Appeal against
one of your own leaders means that you must undergo krinaytsu!! "Lets...be
careful out there".

Sorry for the length of the reply, but nothing has been said about the
poor old Droyne for 10 years, so people may well be unaware of these old
rules.

..and yes, I do have one in my campaign. Do you know how difficult it is to
control a level-15 psionic?? And TNE doesn\'t even attempt to nobble them!

Here\'s some thoughts on this one.

Briefly, the failure of the Jump-Drive mid jump should result in the ship 
misjumping. (roll 1D, roll that number of D parsecs, in a random 
direction 1D on the sector maps).  To be fair to my players, I drop the 
ship into the nearest system, if the above process lands them in an empty 
spot on the map.  The misjump rules though do occasionally destroy a 
ship, on a roll of 18+ (from 2D with modifiers).

I\'ll wrap this up in some "science" and post that a little later.

        Sounds a lot like the Moties from "The Mote In God\'s Eye," by Niven
and Pournelle. The Moties developed a Mediator sub-species to negotiate
between Masters.

Sure, that makes sense. I agree with that. It gives the game that

well.

Anything as sophisticated as a field generator that alters the dimensions of
space-time can fail, especially if it is not maintained correctly or
frequently.

The thing that disappoints me about the description of hyperspace and
j-space in FF&S is the absence of reference to time as a dimension of space.
Denial of relativity is not necessary for the playability of the game if one
allows for the ability to alter space-time or make reference to a time
dimension. 
I don\'t like the descriptions of hyperspace and j-space that sound as if the
game is Spelljammer of AD&D and j-space is some kind of magical poisonous
ether. 
Adding a 3D aspect to the game doesn\'t make it less attractive of less
playable and nor should making reference to relativity if one builds in
systems that compensate for its affects.

Let\'s face it, the Droyne _are_ the Moties. Both have a rigid caste system
and different "sub-species" (Worker, Warrior, Technician, whatever). Many
things in Traveller can be traced almost directly to s-f novels, for
example much of H. Beam Piper\'s work (the Sword Worlds, the "Space Vikings"),
Niven, Pournelle, Heinlein (eg "Starship Trooper"). Some s-f novels can be
traced to Traveller (for example, in my opinion, David Drake\'s "Hammer\'s
Slammers", "The Forlorn Hope", etc).

My point about the motivation of Droyne leaders was just that it is
similar in many ways to the motivation of Protectors. The actual conduct
of two alien races has been portrayed quite differently. For example,
the Droyne do not seem to be the type to want to wholeheartedly
slaughter mankind - but the Protectors who are not human probably would.

I remember that in the original GDW Hivers sourcebook, there was a specific 
statement 
by Mark Miller that the Hivers were based on a combination of Niven\'s  
Puppeteers and 
the Outsiders.  Did he ever make any such comment about his other races?  I 
would be 
interested to hear about it.

I know I have always run the Droyne in a manner similar to the Moties, and I 
even went 
to the effort of creating a Watchmaker subcaste that got my PCs into big 
trouble once  
(this was the real reason Andory and Candory were Red Zones).  I was
pleasantly 
surprised to see that others were thinking along the same lines.

As for Drake\'s work, I don\'t think it is based on Traveller technology or 
background, but his 
Hammer\'s Slammers stuff definitely reads like a good (violent) Traveller 
campaign.

         I was looking over "Survival Margin" and it dawned on me that
         Norris and Strephon share a middle name (Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi
         and Norris Aella Aledon).  Does anyone know if this is a family
         name, and if so, how are they related?  I figured that the Aledons
         must have been related to Arbellatra or something.  It\'s a minor
         point, but given the re-integration of the two families in the
         Regency it becomes current again.

What "prefixes" do ships use in the CT/MT universe?  For

"U.S.S. Ship Name"; British navy ships are "H.M.S. Ship
Name"; some countries use "M/V Ship Name", and other
variations exist.  Is there any more or less canonical set
of prefixes (aside from the unwieldy five-letter prefixes
used by FASA:  I.S.P.M.V. Tethys, etc.)?

A question precedent, I suppose, is where or with whom are
the ships registered? in the Imperium, with the Imperium
itself (probably) or with individual worlds? how do other 
entities handle ship registration?

Obviously, a great many abbreviations could be generated
(Imperial Navy, Scouts, civilian; Zhodani Navy and
civilian; Aslan families; zillions of Vargr states;
Solomani Navy and civilian; Vegans; Hivers; Kkree; Ardenian 
Defense Force; etc.).  Has anyone tried to set a standard?

I\'ve also got it producing pretty pie charts of how much
each section (HULL, POWER, LOCO, ...) takes up of the

    As an exercise I\'ve typed in all the designs from the
Imperial Encyclopedia, or as close as I can get. I\'m thinking
of doing an analysis of "where the money/volume" goes on
ships of different classes with these as (bad) examples.

colourful pie charts don\'t work that way. (And neither do

I can\'t speak for the other races, but non-military Imperial
ships usually prefix their names with "ISR", which stands
for "Imperial Ship Registry".  Ships in the Scout Service
use (as can be expected) "IISS" and the Imperial Navy uses
either "INS" or "INV" (for "Imperial Naval Ship" or "Imperial
Naval Vessel".)

    'body' => 'A few years back a ran a very mercantile and plotical campaign, with the PCs 
acting as corporate and government leaders in the Glisten region.  In support

of this, I came up with a set of rules for naming and registering ships.  All

ships reagrdless of size or jump capability need to be registered with an 
Imperial member world to be considered an Imperial-registered ship.  Such
ships 
would have Imperial-mandated taxes and safety standards, which were to be 
enforced by the registering world.  In addition, ships with a Jump Drive
would 
need a separate certification of that drive.  This could be done at any 
Imperial Naval or Scout facility, but was actually managed by the Imperial 
Ministry of Trade.  Imperial ships without a current Jump certification could

be impounded by Imperial authorities.  Of course, the ship owners benefitted 
from this because the Imperial registration would naturally mean Imperial 
protection.

The naming convention I used was

INS  Imperial Naval Ship
INV  Imperial Naval Vessel
ISS  Imperial Scout Ship
ISV  Imperial Scout Vessel
IGS Imperial Government Ship
IGV Imperial Government Vessel
ICS Imperial Civilian Ship
ICV Imperial Civilian Vessel

The distinction between Ships and Vessels would be the presence of a Jump 
Drive; Ship\'s got them, Vessels do not.

For Civilian vessels, I also included a three-character designation in the 
registration number that would define the type of ship.  For example. the ICS

Alaric, MTH232301, was a Merchant Transport (Heavy).  Imperial ships do not
get 
this for security reasons.  Also, civilian ships that are armed with
offensive 
weapons (basically, anything but sandcasters, meson screens and nuclear 
dampers) receive an "A\' at the end of their registry number.

Aslan Vessels would be listed by clan affiliation, so there would be at

What are the ranges of starship weapons?

What kind of defense is there against ships jumping in to a system
and firing immediately?

Since light travels relatively slow, planet-bound targets won\'t 
detect the enemy until enemy fire has already reached them (since
energy blasts also travel at the speed of light).  

What\'s to prevent a battleship from jumping-in to a system and
immediately firing its weapons at premapped planetary targets?


If they fire from far away, it could conceivably take 10 or more 
minutes for the blasts to reach the planet.  By the time the planet
fires back, the attacking ships could easily jump back out of system,
or change vectors.

These questions came to me in the midst of designing a new space combat
system.  Your thoughts would be most appreciated.

By a simple count it appears the Imperium outnumbers and outguns the
Solomani in terms of fleet strength initially. It would them seem that
if the S. tried a strategy of stacking the whole fleet in the close
orbit box and telling the I. "come and get it", the I. could attrit
away the entire defense force and still have enough transport capacity
to transport the entire ground force to Terra in two waves (this
requires four transports and 6 BatRons, since there are 5040 I. troop
points including the 10 bases). Moreover, they can then do planetary
landings and bombardment without harassment (except for PD units).

It then seems to me that the space battle would go like this:

1) S. divide their forces into an attrition group, a group to hide in
the deep space box, and a group to hide in the oceans.
2) I. attrits away the attrition group.
3) S. harasses the I. player with the "deep space" group and uses the
ocean group to help the PD units.

Is this more or less what happens? I\'ve never played the game; I
bought it used some months ago, and have been looking at it recently.
(Actually, I\'ve never played Traveller in any form except for one game
of _Imperium_, but I have a large collection...)

systems.  Here are some of my major observations:
(Answers to your question, or at least attempts at them, are below.)

1. Don\'t try to shoe-horn large High Guard designs into a system, pick a 
scale (say, ships under 2000 tons) and stick with it.  Every time I try 
to create an "any size ship" space combat system, it ends up being 
unrealistic or unplayable for one end of the spectrum or the other.

2. Use a hex map and a vector system.  It\'s quite easy and fast to play.  
I\'ve developed such a system, inspired in part by Brilliant Lances.  If you 
want, I\'ll send you details.

3. The hardest part is usually the hitting and damage systems.  These are 
hard to make both realistic and fast-playing.

Having said that, here are some answers to your questions.  (Boy, that\'s 
a lot of "food for thought", I think I\'m geting cerebral indigestion)  Be 
warned, these are based on my own peculiar vision of space combat and may 
not mesh with other people\'s views, but this is the only realistic view I 
can think of.

> What is the range of sensors, such as the sensors aboard naval 
>battleships?

Book 2 says that ships can be detected to a range of several 
scale meters.  Each cm is 1000 kms, so we\'re talking on the order of 
light seconds.  I\'ve usually put it at about 500 000 km for civilian 
ships with scout and navy vessels doubling to quadrupling that.  

> What are the ranges of starship weapons?

If you can detect it, you can target it.  Missiles have no inherent range 
limitations, and lasers should be able to reach out to the several light 
second range.

> What kind of defense is there against ships jumping in to a system
> and firing immediately?

Nothing, except that they will be pulverized by ground-based defences
shortly thereafter.  Ships jumping in have a very high signature which
appears before they fully emerge from jump space, so defences can lock on
completely (no chance of missing, with modern computer tech and a stable,
"loud" target) and completely melt the invaders. Even a poor planet can
afford to sink a few BIG meson guns into the ground to mash invading
forces.  And that\'s not mentioning automated satellite defences and such. 
There was a very good article on planetary invasions in one of the JTAS
issues, though I can\'t rem which one.  Of course, primitive planets are 
easily taken if they don\'t have any such defences installed by other forces.

True, except for missiles of course.  But like I said above, most 
planetary defenses can be sunk a mile or two into the ground (think 
Cheyenne) with multiple outlets all over the planet.  Unless you totally 
pulverize the whole place in one shot, you\'re likely to get mauled right 
after the first wave.

> What\'s to prevent a battleship from jumping-in to a system and
> immediately firing its weapons at premapped planetary targets?

Targets cannot be premapped, as you won\'t know your exact position on
emergence (jump only gets you in the general vicinity of the planet, it
cannot give you a pinpoint location.

At those kind of ranges, lasers lose focus and won\'t do any damage.  For
example, the best lasers we have today become pencil-sized, harmless beams
of light by the time they reach the moon.  Missiles can be tracked from
far away and be destroyed by defensive forces. 

> How do you lock-on to a target that is 10 light-seconds away, that
> is continously changing vectors?
> How do you hit such a target?

	Once you\'ve detected the ship\'s position, it has already moved for
ten seconds (i.e. it has taken the light or whatever from the ship 10
seconds to reach your sensors).  If you fire back immediately, there\'s
another 10 seconds before your shot reaches him.  In those 20 seconds, a
ship at 1G can adjust its vector by 2000 m, effectively giving you a
"bubble" 2 km in radius in which your target could be.  
	What you then do is fire multiple shots through that area hoping
to hit him with one of them.  The way I picture it, during a 1000 second
turn, you fire several hundred shots and maybe only get one hit.  It\'s a
procedure something like artillery.  You try to create "beaten zones"
which will catch the enemy.  Of course, you can try to increase your
chances by anticipating his movements.  For instance, a ship running from
you will not likely decelerate, so that reduces your "bubble" by half. 
Also, remember that missiles just close and then hit, they don\'t have the
"delayed signal problem". 
	For the people in the target ship, the effect is something like 
being in a B-52 bomber under AA fire.  Lots of explosions are going on 
around you, but not much of it hits you.   

> What about the nuclear variety?

The way I picture missiles is that they are trying to get in close enough
that their blast radius will intersect with the enemy, but they can\'t get
in too close or they become easy pickings for the ship\'s beam weapons, ECM
and so on.  So what you do is similar to the above, you fire several
missiles (say 5 to 10 in one round) and they home in to form a pattern of
overlapping blast radii that the enery hopefully "flies into".  Either
that, or they carry one-shot beam weapons (e.g. X-ray lasers), that they
fire when they get close enough for a good shot.  Nuclear weapons simply
have larger blast radii and thus cause more damage when at the same
distance as HE missiles.

> What happens when such a missile goes off high in a planet\'s
> atmosphere?

A nuke?  Well, lots of people get irradiated and die.  It also blocks out 
sensors (overload) for a time.

> What sort of nukes are available by TL15?

I would not think it unlikely that they would have anti-matter bombs by 
then.  Even if antimatter doesn\'t appear as a power source until TL-17 
(?), TL-15 societies should still be able to produce anti-matter in large 
amounts for military use.  It\'s kind of like the way we have fusion bombs 
but no fusion power.  An antimatter bomb would have similar effects to a 
nuke, only bigger and badder.  I think 1 gigaton bombs would be available 
(though HIGHLY controlled).  In my own settings, weapons of mass 
destruction are usually banned on penalty of death.

> What is a "fusion" warhead in Traveller?

Just a big bad nuke.  The difference is that it can potentially be 
relatively "clean" (no radiation), though it need not be if the designers 
don\'t want it to be.

> Is it a form of nuke?
> If so, do Nuclear Dampers protect against it?

Yes to both, IMNSHO.

Again, let me state that these answers are just based on my view of space 
combat, and may not wash well with "official" views and so on.  Hope this 
is helpful.

Hi.  I forgot a couple of things in my answers to your questions.  First 
of all, when aiming for a ship in its "bubble" of possible locations, one 
only cares about a plane through the bubble perpendicular to the 
direction of fire (yeesh, I\'m technobabbling again).  What I mean is, if 
you were looking at the bubble, you would see a circle.  That is the area 
in question, since the laser beams you fire will travel all the way 
through the bubble\'s "depth dimension" anyway.  I\'m not sure I\'m 
explaining this very well, please let me know.

Secondly, is the space combat system you are developing for use during 
role-playing?  I\'d like to know a little more about it.  Space combat 
systems are a particular interest of mine. If the system is to be used 
during role-playing, then I encourage you to include some kind of agility 
roll for the pilot to make.  One thing that the Traveller space combat 
systems I\'ve seen tend to leave out is the pilot factor.

Bye for now,
Charles.

 ----
What is the range of sensors, such as the sensors aboard naval

AFAIK in CT 5 lightseconds (3 LS for civilians) tracking out to 6 LS for 
both.
In MT whatever the sensors are rated at 8-)

 ----
What are the ranges of starship weapons?
 ----

It generally seems to be taken as a few light seconds effective range at 
most.

 ----
What kind of defense is there against ships jumping in to a system
and firing immediately?
 ----

None except that the jumping ship would presumably be low on fuel and I have 
always assumed that the jump exit location is only known to within a 
considerable number of Light seconds.

 ----
Since light travels relatively slow, planet-bound targets won\'t
detect the enemy until enemy fire has already reached them (since
energy blasts also travel at the speed of light).
 ----

What about the burst of energy upon jump exit? Also not knowing precisely 
where  the jump exit point will be means some time must be spent in 
orientation and target acquisition before useful firing can take place.

 ----
What\'s to prevent a battleship from jumping-in to a system and
immediately firing its weapons at premapped planetary targets?
 ----

Uncertainty of exit points...

 ----
If they fire from far away, it could conceivably take 10 or more
minutes for the blasts to reach the planet.  By the time the planet
fires back, the attacking ships could easily jump back out of system,
or change vectors.
 ----

Light MINUTES! Thats a looong way out. I think you\'d need a bloody big focal 
array to get your lasers to do anything more than wake them up!

 ----
How do you lock-on to a target that is 10 light-seconds away, that
is continously changing vectors?
 ----

Ok. The simple answer is of course "with some difficulty" ;)

Really you don\'t lock onto the target, you lock onto the position the target 
was in 10 seconds (+ processer & weapon alignment time) ago.

How do you hit such a target?
 ----

Ok, you have the position of the target 10 seconds ago, if using passive 
sensors only you have the angular change in position relative to you, if you 
know the characteristics of the target or are using active sensors you have 
range data as well.

Using this you can determine the targets position and vector at t= -10 
seconds.
If the target doesn\'t maneouvre you can predict precisely where it will be 
when your laser beams hit it at t= +10 seconds

If you know the targets characteristics you have a limit on how much 
acceleration the target can use to change its position, if not then you are 
going to have to guess the targets potential acceleration based on the 
targets previous movement.

If the target maneouvres then its position can be anywhere in a sphere ( due 
to the fact that it would usually take an amount of time to slew the target 
ship it would actually be a cartioid like shape but a sphere is the worst 
case ) centred on the targets predicted position of a size determined by the 
targets acceration.

As light is so fast the depth of the sphere can be ignored so all you have 
to do is fire a pattern of shots over the area of the sphere\'s 
cross-section.

Your chance of hitting is determined by the number of shots fired, the size 
of the sphere of future target position and the target\'s cross-section in 
that aspect.

It then seems to me that the space battle would go like this:

1) S. divide their forces into an attrition group, a group to hide in

2) I. attrits away the attrition group.
3) S. harasses the I. player with the "deep space" group and uses the

Yes that is precisely what happened the last couple of times I played it.
The S. Batrons fight a round or two in the deep space box then go hide, the 
SDB\'s fight a few rounds and then go hide in the ocean.
This forces the I. player to use many Batrons and Crurons to escort the 
transports and maintain SDB overwatch instead of bombarding the S. ground 
units.
In the mean time the PD units attrit the I. squadrons....

Why don\'t you set it up and play it solo a few times?
That\'s my only experience with this game, by the way, and I 
found it quite enjoyable and informative (but then I\'m told 
that I have a high threshhold for boredom).  It seems to me 
that it usually goes more or less as you describe it, but 
it\'s eight years since I played it.

Something should be done about that.  It\'s a very good RPG, 
with very good related games.  Do find a group with which 
to play.

What does "range" mean in this context?  The range of the
human eye is many light-years, because we can see stars
that far away without assistance.  Of course, we can\'t
tell much about them.

The range of passive sensors is thus basically infinite -- 
whatever energy registers on the sensor will be reported, 
but degradations for distance (as well as intervening 
stuff) will occur.

The range of active sensors, on the other hand, is the 
range beyond which the returned signal is too corrupted to 
read.  How far is that?

> What are the ranges of starship weapons?

Again, you have to divide the weapons up.  A missile will
go on forever, I suppose, but it can only accelerate until
its fuel is used up.  Then it\'ll coast at whatever speed it
achieved with its last burn.

I hope that someone more knowledgeable than me about the
physics involved will describe what happens to energy at
long ranges.  I think that ranges (effective,
half-strength, weak, ineffective, e.g.) will be defined by
how much the energy is weakened by spreading out.

The attacker needs more like 8 hours to get ready for the 
next jump, per the Starship Operator\'s Manual, I think.  
Black globe-equipped ships are even more of a problem:  
They calculate where they\'ll enter the system in relation 
to where the targets on the planet will be when their fire 
arrives, jump, fire, activate black globe before anyone 
knows they\'re there, coast on a preset vector while getting 
ready to jump, drop black globe and fire and jump.  They 
just don\'t know whether their shots were effective or not.

I thought the Predict program did that.  Oh, you mean, how 
does the Predict program work?

This we might think we know a little about:  It spreads 
radioactive materials into the jet stream, to the detriment 
of the ecosystem and the enemy living in the ecosystem.  If 
it\'s big enough, relative to the atmosphere, maybe it blows 
part of the atmosphere off into space, but again, I hope 
that someone with a real physics background responds.

 
> What is a "fusion" warhead in Traveller?

I think it\'s a hydrogen bomb, like we have today.  A 
fission explosion compresses hydrogen enough to get it 
begin a fusion reaction.  At higher tech levels, gravitic 
devices cause the necessary compression.

> If so, do Nuclear Dampers protect against it?

Nuclear Dampers should only protect against low-tech fusion 
bombs using fission compression.

The answer can vary between campaigns, but the general consensus from past
discussions is that Jump isn\'t *that* accurate. Canonically, Jumps are
*about* a week - some take six days, some take eight days, randomly. Even
with precise control of Jump coordinates (where you land), planets move a
lot in a couple of days, and predicting when (and in many campaigns, where)
you\'ll arrive is difficult at best.

THe result is that ships jump in and get their coordinates. They may have
some time advantage over their targets, but not as much as a pop-in,
pop-out attack like the kind you imply.

This also depends on ranges, sensor quality, and so on. I don\'t know how
canonical this is, but a system could have sensors strewn out around
strategic locations and possibly detect the new ship before it could find
it bearings and bring itself to bear.

>Since light travels relatively slow, planet-bound targets won\'t

>energy blasts also travel at the speed of light).

True, but if ranges is short enough (even a few thousand kilometers) it\'s
likely that the ship will have been detected while traveling from the 100
diameter limit to weapons range.

>What\'s to prevent a battleship from jumping-in to a system and
>immediately firing its weapons at premapped planetary targets?

As above. You don\'t know when or where you\'ll land - pre-calc coordinates
are useful only when you get to a pre-calc location to adjust from.

>If they fire from far away, it could conceivably take 10 or more
>minutes for the blasts to reach the planet.  By the time the planet

Then why did yuou attack the system? That\'s just harrasment. Hit & run
might affect shipping but it won\'t win the war by itself - sooner or later
you\'ll have to land some troops, or at least station ships for space
superiority.

>How do you lock-on to a target that is 10 light-seconds away, that
>is continously changing vectors?

Try and predict where it will be in 10 seconds. I imagine that a thorough
understanding of Quantum Physics and predictability would be required. :)

>How do you hit such a target?

Perhaps targets do not engage until within more reasonable ranges.

People say "wow, that was the most beautiful one" while waiting for the fallout.

A lot of questions from Roger Sanger!  I\'ve been playing around with
setting up rules for space combat, for my online rules page
(http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~spe/Rules/), so here are some of my thoughts

> What is the range of sensors, such as the sensors aboard naval battleships?

Active EM sensors I restrict to about 500 000 km, or 5 000 000 km if
conditions are good.  Passive sensors can go much further; I take the
range ratings as a measure of sensitivity, although PEMS Interstellar
range refers to the ability to do astronomical measurements on nearby
stars.  I\'m also toying with the idea of resolution based on the
largest length scale of the starship; for a synthetic aperture sensor,
the resolution is roughly 57*wavelength/separation of sensor elements
(in degrees), so larger vessels can resolve things which are closer
together.  This also introduces the possibility of extended senor
booms, giving a vessel greater resolution than their size would
suggest; these booms would be more susceptable to damage in combat.

> What are the ranges of starship weapons?

I restrict my beam weapons to ranges of 50 000 km, and high energy
weapons to only 5 000 km; in my game, it is essential to get in close!
This is again because of the 57*wavelength/diameter law; any beam will
spread over a large area over fairly short distances, and infact I
think 50 000 km is pushing it (without FFS gravitic focussing magic!)
As for missiles, if you are willing to build them big enough, they can
have the range of any spaceship.  I keep my non-bay missiles to the
canonical (CT) mass of 50 kg, and fitting into 100 l storage.  I think
this gives my missiles a single-burn range equivalent to a beam
weapon.  I also make my missiles kinetic energy weapons; the HE charge
shatters the missile, allowing multiple particles a greater chance of
intercepting the target.  These things can be lethal if the relative
velocities of the launcher and the target are high, but the rocket
acceleration is sufficient to make them dangerous in any situation.  I
also have deadfall ordnance, with no rocket.  The greater final mass
leads to enhanced damage, but you aim them by pointing your ship\'s
velocity at the target!

> What kind of defense is there against ships jumping in to a system
> and firing immediately?
 (... some more stuff in a similar vein ...)

Range of beam wepons and sensors.  You can fire missiles, but as they
don\'t travel at the speed of light, the target has a chance of seeing
them coming.

>What\'s to prevent a battleship from jumping-in to a system and
>immediately firing its weapons at premapped planetary targets?

It was canonical that jump was not 100 % accurate; you cannot know
exactly how long a jump will take, or exactly where you will be.  On
interplanetary scales, a few 1000 km and a few minutes can make a big
difference to precision shooting.

> How do you lock-on to a target that is 10 light-seconds away, that
> is continously changing vectors?

You don\'t :-)

> How do you hit such a target?

You don\'t :-), or you put a wide cone of very high-velocity
heavy-metal particles in it\'s (possible) path, and wait for it to hit.


> What about the nuclear variety?

I haven\'t been able to fit nuclear missiles into my ideas yet


> What is a "fusion" warhead in Traveller?

I\'d guess this is a combined fusion-fission warhead, which uses a
fusion reaction to set-off the explosion.  I seem to remember
something about a "clean" nuke, which may have used fusion.

For an excellent, dramatised idea of interplanetary combat at long
range and high velocity, look at C. J. Cherryh\'s Rimrunner or
Hellburner or Heavy Time.  Essentially, the idea is guess where your
target is going to be when your weapons arrive, and put a lot of crap
in the way.

Sorry, v. long post!

In regards to various messages (from Charles Collins, and also from Roger 
Sanger); I remember reading (but not where) about the situation where a 
ship jumps into the outer area of a system. Assuming that it exits 
J-space about where Jupiter would be in our system, that gives the 
incoming ship an enormous intelligence-gathering ability.

Sure it\'s not all guns blazing stuff, but this sort of mission is 
*exactly* what is needed immediately before dispatching such a mission. 
It reduces the inteligence estimation error to a mere giggle (only a week 
old) rather then being ridiculously out of date. Whats more, it is highly 
likely that the spy ship will have exactly no exciting encounters out 
there (especially if it does not have to refuels which limits matters 
greatly.)

The reason for such a quiet mission is exactly the same as was mentioned 
as a problem predicting an enemy ships movements. This time the 
light-speed lag is working in your favour. If a ship jumps into the outer 
reaches of the system, and then accumulates data, it takes anywhere from 
eight hours to several days for the light from the ships emergence from 
jump to make it to the planet. The planet, being stationary, and emitting 
EMS signals for a lot longer than that is available on sensors of the spy 
ship immediately (admittedly some hours old.)

By the time the emergence flare has reached the planet, the ship is 
making ready to jump (home this time).

In regards to shooting at a ship 10 or more light seconds away, that is 
an awesome area to cover with lasers, and I would guess impossible to 
fill with shrapnel (most ships would not carry the amount of ordnance 
necessary and still have reloads). I personally would wait until they 
were closer. The amount of energy, mass, and stress expended falls 
according to the inverse square law. At half the range, it is a quarter 
of the problem.

I hope this answers more questions than it raises ;-)

This varies extensively from version to version of even classic
Traveller.  One version of Book 2 gave half a light-second for
civilian detectors, and two light-seconds for military and IISS
detectors.  I think that there were negative DMs for weapons fire
at long range, but I don\'t remember the details.  

High Guard didn\'t have explicit ranges, just Short and Long, but
MegaTraveller brought back the hex grid, which had four range bands;
Visual, Near, Far, and Extreme.  If Near == Short and Far == Long,
then Near is out to 25 Mm (one MT hex) and Far is out to 250 Mm
(ten MT hexes, or 0.8 light-seconds).  Sensors have their own
rated ranges, with negative DMs for range to target, as I recall.

Well, the 100-diameter limit for a big size-8 world is at only
4.3 light-seconds, and in any case, most Traveller sensors will 
have problems getting a target lock at this range, even if the
guns will reach.  The only other question is whether or not a
ship can jump in that accurately.  Many people around here say
no.  I don\'t, and use hand-waving about the effects of "large
gravitic disturbances near the exit-point" to "drag" it around 
with a planet that\'s the destination of the ship.  The reason
that I do this is to let military couriers use their pre-jump
vector to have a high speed approach toward the planet.

Jumping to within 100 planatery diameters is dangerous.

Planetary defense ships are likely to be in the near vicinity of the
planet.

So we can take the ship to be not *too* close, and not immune to
counter-attack.

A ship can\'t hit an ENTIRE planet in one shot.  The fraction of the
planet hit by energy weapons in the first few minutes of combat is so
small as to be "zero".  Unless your hypothetical planet has only one
small, localized target, it\'s going to have warning.

Energy weapons are unlikley to be useful against targets shrouded in
atmosphere (which scatters lasers, and is even more effective against
other beam weapons).  Meson guns, maybe, depending on how you view
their "magic penetration" as working.

So that must have been one small, localized target on a vacuum world.

On the *surface* of a vacuum world.  It\'s a lot easier to put 100\' of
rock between you and the surface than it is to put 100\' of rock around
an attacking warship, and according to the armour strengths of buffered
planetoids, even a small amount of rock is apparently good armour.

>What\'s to prevent a battleship from jumping-in to a system and
>immediately firing its weapons at premapped planetary targets?

Essentially, nothing.  But beam weapons aren\'t very effective, it\'s a
big world, and military targets will be dug in.  You could wreak havoc
on a number of civilian targets on a vacuum world----but given the risk
ov micro-meteroites on such a world, and the lack of scenery, even
civilian targets are likely to be dug-in on a vacuum world.

Missile attacks are a more realistic way of attacking a world.  A ship
could jump in and launch a wave of missiles.

High guard implies that jumping takes 40 minutes if power-plant
capacity is equal to the jump attempted and 20 minutes if power-plant
capacity is twice the jump attempted.

So we can suppose that a ship with a power plant capable of supporting
jump-6 could execute a jump-1 in about seven minutes.

A full combat round is twenty minutes, so in 7 minutes the ship should
only be allowed to do about one-third damage (either firing one-third
of its weapons, or firing all weapons for one-third damage, depending
on the ref wants to interpet it).

You would have to be using a fleet of overwelming force for one-third
of one round of firing to be more than a nuisance to a planet.  And you
can only do this nuisance attack once every two weeks with your ship.

It\'s an interesting tactic, but I don\'t think it "breaks" anything in
the Traveller universe.  If you want to do a real attack, you\'re still
going to have to hang around for the consequences.

What it would probably be is a terrorist tactic, not a military
tactic.  It\'s not going to hurt a world much in real terms, but it will
sure get the citizens scared and very ticked off.

I assume you\'re refering to NEMP (if I got the accronym right----Nuclear
Electro-Magnetic Pulse).  NEMP is most effective against wire-based
power distribution and communication (traditional copper-wire telephone
networks, cable T.V., and the entire power grid).  The wires act as
antenna, pick up too much power, and the networks are out of commission
until multiple overload-failures are repaired (days).

I doubt this would do anything to TL11+ communications; running copper
wire for communication is a 1900\'s solution, not a 1995 solution.  If
we didn\'t have so much invested in copper wiring, cellular radio would
be the dominant solution today.  Presumably even more so for
higher-tech societies.  And where wire still makes sense, it will be
fiber-optic, not copper.

Losing the power-grid... a society that can build fusion plants and fit
them into a 100ton space ship isn\'t going to need today\'s model of huge
power plants serving customers hundreds of miles away.  Again, at
higher tech levels, the target presumably no longer exists.

In addition to the target (large grid of metal wires) not existing at
higher tech levels, the technology should be much better at handling
overloads that do occur.

So at a guess, I\'d say at TL11 or higher, NEMP has no effect on a
world.

At TLs below telephone and power distribution, NEMP has nothing to
hurt.

In the mid-range TL\'s, NEMP could be very effective.  Military
equipment and installations will be unaffected (hardening against such
effects is standard) but civilians could be without power or
communication for days.

On inhospitable worlds, one could expect life-support to be as heavily
shielded as military----for one thing some natural causes can mimic the
same effects in milder terms.  You\'re probably not going to direcly
kill many people with a NEMP attack.

----

You don\'t need a nuclear weapon for this.  A nuclear weapon lets you
cover a continent with one blast, but if you have a more specific
target you can do this with conventional explosives.  Form a powerful,
small electromagnet, then use a conventional explosive to explode
(outwards) the coils of the magnet.

The effect is a very powerful magnetic pulse that has all the above effects
in the nearby area (few miles), plus the local EM field levels within
a few hundred meters will be strong enough to destroy electronics that
would be immune to NEMP\'s lower, but more widespread, effects.

This requires at least cryogenic cooling with today\'s technology to get
a strong enough electromagnet, making it an exotic idea without much
real application----you could use a convential explosive of the same
size as the cryo unit to outright destroy the object instead of frying
it).  At TL\'s where high-current superconductors exist, this becomes a
useful weapon.

Since this is a smaller, but more intense effect, it will work against
higher TL\'s (power grids as small as a block might be effected), and
probably almost any TL level of electronics within a building-sized
area would be destroyed.

>What sort of nukes are available by TL15?

Big nukes, little nukes, dial-a-yield nukes, extremely clean nukes,
filthy dirty nukes, high-radiation, low-blast nukes, high-blast,
low-radiation nukes...

What did you want?  :-).

Modern TL is capable of all of the above variations to a limited
extent.  TL15 should remove all of the "limited" from the variations.

Probably add some more exotic variations, like shaped-charge nukes.

Why not tell us what effect you wanted, and we\'ll talk about what TL
seems appropriate.

Well, I write stuff for TTC and try to make all my stuff as generic
(CT/MT/TNE) as possible. Everything I do can be set in TTC\'s Far Frontiers
sector which, having experienced little change throughout the Rebellion and
Virus periods, is fairly easy to adapt to any setting. So, CT content in TTC
is fairly good and one can always adapt ideas from TNE (sound of xboaters
hissing and spitting).

If you want to see some examples of TTC work, point your web-browser at:

http://eeyore.lv-hrc.nevada.edu/~indy/traveller.html

The Rock Called Jade adventure in Issue 7 is an example of a fairly generic
sort of scenario which could be adapted to any era.

>...I was wondering 
>what ever became of this idea for a Traveller Fanzine.  I think it would 
>be a great idea.  I would personally pledge one article a month...

Well, I know how much time it takes me to write stuff for TTC. I, too, have
millions of ideas, but my fingers can only type so fast... Therefore, the
success of any Net Fanzine depends on the persistence of at least 2 or 3
prolific writers who are willing to constantly produce work for no reward
(except Net recognition). PLUS any such venture should not compromise the
operation of current systems, i.e. xboat and TML; if you\'re producing stuff
and want to distribute it free, just shove it into xboat/TML - you don\'t
need a separate fanzine. If you ask for contributions to yourself and then
pass it on, then unless you\'re careful work gets lost and you edit out what
_you_ don\'t like... whereas if everything goes straight to xboat/TML then
some of the stuff you didn\'t like might really be the biz\' for someone else.

Use the above as a positive push rather than a negative downer: my
experience is that a lot of people talk about ideas but very few of them
ever get as far as writing them down. And fewer still get beyond their first
such article. So you need to have the persistence to keep going at it. Hell,
I regard myself as a sci-fi writer, having written several Traveller-based
books. That\'s a big undertaking, but that\'s nothing compared to the fight to
actually get something published... I\'m still waiting after 3 years... GDW
didn\'t like my stuff because it wasn\'t copied straight out of the TNE source
books (they went for Death of Wisdom instead - look how well that was
received [not])... so, anyone out there got a friend in publishing?

    'body' => '> Since light travels relatively slow, planet-bound targets won\'t 
Surly not!  To what is light relatively slow?

Sensors, Fire Control and Weapons
=================================
Based on my notes for CT.  For the Scout and Navy ships 
Sensor detection range 2light seconds, tracking is out to 3light 
seconds.  Civ ships detect at 1/2 light second.
I take this to be the capabilities of the fire control sensors.

In the 6 seconds for the light to reach the scout, and the laser fire 
to return, a ship doing 6g can change its projected position by up to 
1000m.  At 3light seconds this is 1 part in a million.  (At 1g this 
becomes 180m)

Obviously, the output of the engines can be detected, so the size of 
this circle can be predicted.  As Charles pointed out.  This is what 
the suit of Predict programs do, along with Gunner experience.  Then 
the Manoeuvre-Evade programs, and a good Pilot set up patterns trying 
to make the position in the circle as difficult to predict as 
possible.  The process though is mainly statistical mechanics.

The laser and beam weapons would be configured to be most effective 
at these sort of ranges.
Missiles on the other hand, have a much larger "circle of 
probability", to aim at due to the longer flight times.  But they do 
have their own sensors and propulsion for terminal guidance.

I expect space combat would look a little like modern ASW.  You know 
where the target WAS, and where she MIGHT be.  Your weapons can 
either strike at range, where you are guessing more, but allow no 
evasion (lasers).  Or close and use their own guidance, but could be 
dogged (missiles).

Or course the ships will have other sensors, with longer ranges.  
After all the Type-S can detect stars and Gas giants 2pc away!

Though the above might change for capital ships.  Though longer 
ranges needs more guess work.  I expect 3light seconds is an optimum.

Nukes
=====
Most missiles will only go up to about 10kton yield (turret 
launched), so letting on off in the upper atmosphere will cause EMP 
effects but little else.  Then their are the "Big Boys" with bay 
launched weapons!

Fusion nukes at early tech levels will have a fission initiator, so 
could be countered by Nuclear Dampers.  Higher tech levels will have 
laser initiators so Nuclear Dampers will be less effective.  At 
higher tech levels the initiation would become better (smaller!), and 
the overall weapon size would come down.

Jump(Pop)-Up attacks
====================
You just can\'t do it!
You cannot guarantee the accuracy of the exit point in space-time, (I 
can\'t remember the errors).  Or even possibly your exit orientation.  
It\'d take several minutes to sort this lot out, and target the 
planet.

Firing from 10 light minutes away!!
You couldn\'t deliver enough coherent energy to give a Nat sunburn!

You would then take a few hours to reset the jump out of the system, 
assuming of course that you had the fuel to do so!

The Traveller Chronicle is a magazine advertised on the web.  Just go to 
the Traveller Web Pages, there\'s a link from there.  It seems to have 
good  artwork at the very least.

That sounds like a good idea.  
IS ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE INTERESTED IN GETTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS GOING?
I\'m thinking that realistically, we can put out a small web page magazine 
quarterly.  Nothing fancy.

any way to get such a ship through an atmosphere (and then perhaps have it

is evacuated.)   I am trying to put together an adventure where I would
very much like it to be possible; however, I will find another way if 
such a landing is strictly forbidden (Captain, I canna change the laws

Nothing. As soon as you have a good idea of where the target will be at the
time of interception, you can lob shots to be there.

Nothing. But remember the effects of atmospheric degradation, and that a
jump will ALWAYS drop you at the 100 diameter point or further out, so
accuracy is querstionable.

You saturate a fire zone based upon the target\'s "potential endpoint bell",
a shape which describes their potential positions over time, accounting for
their accelleration and vector.

Yes (to all). One of the bombs dropped on Japan at the end of WWII was nuke
called an H-Bomb -- it was a fusion warhead.

For non-lased energy, the relationship is the inverse square law:

2x base dist gives 1/4 base energy, 3x dist gives 1/9 base energy, etc.

Lased energy (lasers, masers, etc) has significantly more range per degradation.

EMS is the easiest. (EMS= Electro Magnetic Spectrum). Passive and active
designs both work, depending upon ranges. Neutrino Sensors can tell you PP
type and output, but not too good for targeting.

The range bands in MT are for getting data. See DGP\'s _World Builder\'s
Handbook_ for details on MT Sensor rules, and tasks. Basically, though, it
workds like shooting a weapon to get a lock-on.

There is no difference between MT and CT sector generation. The MT

Nope.  The first H-bomb was exploded  a while after the war (\'53?).
Both Liitle Boy and Fat Man were _fission_ devices.  The former was a
gun type using uranium, and the latter was an implosion type device
using Plutonium.  I\'d have to check, but I belive they were both in the
13-20kt range.

I like the idea of the intelligence gathering mission, but to be safe, it 
would have to be at a far enough distance that it would not be able to 
gather precise data.  I like the idea better if the ship sneaks up with 
its plant cold (hard to detect) and uses passive sensors as it drifts 
past enemy forces.  An asteroid-hulled ship would be especially good for 
this.  You could even include batteries in case it got caught with its 
plant down (the batts would keep it going while the plant was being 
kick-started).  Ooh, I feel the design urge coming on...

Actually, unless the invading fleet jumps in, the spy ship has to send 
info back (1 week) and the invaders have to jump in (another week).  This 
makes the info at least two weeks out of date when the invaders arrive 
(though they can of course get the updated info from the spy ship when 
they arrive)

If it does have to refuel, it is toast.  Any gas giants or other sources

Yup, I like it.  But like I said, the data it gathered would be at least  2 
weeks out of date by the time an invading fleet could use the info.

You don\'t have to fill the area with shrapnel, just a bubble around the

Neat idea, but you\'re giving jump drives a LOT of accuracy if a ship can 
jump to a specified point AND with a specified vector.  Just to be 
accurate to within 1 light second, you\'re talking about accuracy around 1 
part in 100 million for even the shortest jumps.  To line up a vector 
relative to moving bodies within a system demands even more accuracy.

True, but you don\'t have to be within 100 diams to bombard the planet.

I agree.  I think the limiting factor on the kind of "smash and run" 
operation that Roger Sanger proposes is planetary defence.  Any planet 
with decent TL and pop is going to have some BIG defenses (bigger than 
spinal mounts, possibly <8( ).  And they won\'t need more than a couple of 
minutes to make quick work of anything within their awesome range of 
fire.  Also remember than planet-based sensors will be incredibly 
powerful, able to obtain locks on targets at virtually distance (and pass 
those locks on to any defending ship).  
The only way to take over a world (at least a fairly advanced one) is to 
lay siege and maybe pester it with long range missile attacks.  Either 
that or an attritional fight.  If you could get a fifth column to take 
out the ground-based defences, though....

> Energy weapons are unlikley to be useful against targets shrouded in

You\'re right missiles are definately the weapon of choice for planetary 
bombardment.  But beams will work too, just at closer ranges.  A beam 
weapon will cause explosions on the surface due to instantaneous heat 
expansion, and they can probably fire about once a second at a stationary 
target (no need to calculate aim or anything really, just blast away at 
whatever rate the mechanism can handle).  

> other beam weapons).  Meson guns, maybe, depending on how you view
> their "magic penetration" as working.

Hey!  Meson guns are not "magic", there do in fact exist exotic particles 
that can travel through solid matter and explode a present amount of time 
after being created (i.e. after their decay time elapsed).  Atmosphere would 
have no effect on this rate of decay, though relativity says the gravitic 
feild of the planet would 
delay their explosion (but you could compensate for that).  The only 
thing "magic"/high tech about Meson guns is the number of high-speed mesons 
produced in a given amount of time.

Again, I agree.  The advantage is extremely with the defender.

But then planetary defenses could take them out before they got close.

I\'m sorry, but I don\'t think the tactic would work.  This kind of "smash 
and run" thing would be suicidal (though it might be a great tactic for 
fanatic forces now that I think about it).  If the attacking ships come 
in close enough to do damage, they are going to be mashed by planetary 
defences long before they can escape.  If they come in at a great 
distance, their weapons won\'t be able to stay focused enough to do damage 
(and missiles will be taken out by defensive systems).

I liked the discussion on EMP effects of weapons!  Very well put!

Do we really have "dial-a-yeild" nukes?  Cool.

> Probably add some more exotic variations, like shaped-charge nukes.

I usually picture the ship-fired nukes as being a sort of shaped-charge 
nuke or x-ray laser that fires itself at the enemy once it closes.

I\'m not sure I agree with the 1000m figure.  Wouldn\'t the calc be 
1/2 A * T * T ?  Making it 10 * 6 * 6 = 360 m?  Or am I missing something

I think missiles on the whole would have an easier time hitting, since 
they can get close in and fire at the enemy (like I said above, I picture 
missiles as mobile one-shot weapon platforms, not just big bombs).

> I expect space combat would look a little like modern ASW.  You know 

I like the analogy.  I also use the comparison of anti-aircraft fire.  By 
the time your ordonance gets to the target, the target has changed 
position, so you have to try and "lead" the target and predict where he 
will be.

Actually, High Guard says you can do it in (Jump range/Powerplant factor) 
rounds.  But even if you give the ground defences just 5 minutes, they\'ll 
smash you.  Am I sounding like a broken record here?

Well, there are unstreamlined ships and there are 
unstreamlined ships.  High Guard recognizes nine hull
configurations:

needle/wedge		streamlined
cone			streamlined
cylinder		partially streamlined
close structure		partially streamlined (e.g., Gazelle)
sphere			partially streamlined (e.g., Broadsword)
flattened sphere	streamlined
dispersed structure	not streamlined
planetoid		not streamlined
buffered planetoid	not streamlined

Partially streamlined hulls can refuel at gas giants, so
presumably can withstand any atmospheric stress involved in
the unorthodox maneuver that you describe.  

As to a dispersed structure, I as a referee would rules 
that it cannot withstand the stress of atmospheric entry, 
and would be torn apart when trying to enter the 
atmosphere, not matter how slowly or carefully the crew 
tries to do so.

Planetoids and buffered planetoids should not suffer as
much meteorism as asteroids upon entry, because they can
use their maneuvre drives to slow themselves down.  

The use of repulsors to ameliorate the effects of 
atmospheric entry stress is worth considering -- could a 
ship repel the atmosphere below it, descending in 
essentially a vaccuum, until it gets close to the surface 
of the planet and stops its descent?

I don\'t consider gravitational stress to be an issue for
any ships, because they are all built to withstand their
own accelerations, which generally exceed the
gravitational force of any planet where they would want to
land their crews.

Yes (to all). One of the bombs dropped on Japan at the end of WWII was nuke
called an H-Bomb -- it was a fusion warhead.

I suggest you go read up on some history.
The first nuke was a gun type A-bomb.
The second nuke was a lens ( compression ) triggered device but still an 
A-bomb, a fission device.
The Manhattan project was almost entirely to get the latter type to work.
The first H-bomb (fusion) appeared several years after the war.

Unstreamlined vessels can\'t survive a landing... they won\'t be spaceworthy
after such a landing... but if their thrust is good enough and the pilot is
hot enough, alerted crew and passengers should be able to survive the
landing. Remember that a 2G thrust rating indicates the ability to take up
to 2 G\'s of force along the primary thrust axis.

On an USL (unstreamlined) hull, the problem is that the hull is stressed
for RCS thrusters and the primary thrust axis ONLY. So if you carefully
burn down (like the apollo and viking landers), you could probably even
save the atmospheric integrity! For CT ppurposes, this probably requires an
11+ on 2d6, DM+ pilot skill, DM+1 for dex 8+.

All the above basically just my NSHO. ;-)

"Can you crash-land an unstreamlined ship on a world?"

Nasty stuff atmosphere - makes your ship all hot and requires streamlining
to maneouvre once you\'ve got through the outer bit and cooled down a bit.
Well, dense atmosphere will burn you up then rip you apart for definite,
since an unstreamlined ship doesn\'t have the necessary heat-shielding and
fuselage shaping to withstand the atmospheric effects. Thin or trace
atmosphere gives you a chance because the heat-up will be much less and the
aerodynamic drag should be less so you might not get ripped apart. Given the
latter option I\'d do the following (to make the players feel they\'ve earned
their survival rather than just been allowed to land because you need it for
the plot...)

1) Atmospheric entry. Determine how many surface hits to apply to the craft
- say 6. Let the pilot roll for each hit, with the first 2 being easy to
get, the next 2 more difficult and the last 2 near-impossible. Adjust for
the ship hull type, i.e. close structure is probably easier to control than
open structure. Each failed pilot roll, apply the (random) surface damage to
the ship, with an appropriate description [turret hit]:

"The craft is buffeted by the atmosphere - you think you\'ve got it made when
red lights wink up around your turret - you\'re registering a huge
temperature surge... fire klaxons sound... lights dim as a small explosion
rumbles through the ship... your external viewer shows white-hot fuselage
peeling back from the turret... cut-outs isolate the turret and the lights
return to normal, but you\'re not through it yet..."

And that was just one failed roll...

2) Atmospheric \'gliding\' (avoiding the word "plummet" here). Same principle
as 1, but this reflects the aerodynamic strain - generate 6 (say) internal
damage hits and have the pilot roll again - perhaps an engineer could roll
as well to help the pilot: "Cap\'n, she canna\' take the strain. Ye canna\'
pull her up so  fast!" For each failed roll... [hold hit]

"The world outside is a roaring blizzard of tugging, dragging atmosphere.
Hull metal screams as something is gradually wrenched from its normal
position. Scotty (engineer) checks the internal cameras and yells: \'Cap\'n,
the cargo bay doors are buckling - if ye dinna slow us down that wind\'ll
push through and rip our insides out like an exploding haggis!\'"

3) Crash landing. Anything still left of the ship? Not after this bit...
Make the players roll, but frankly they ought to have baled out (ship\'s
boat, air raft, parachute, umbrella ala Mary Poppins...) by now. Ever seen
the photos of the wreckage of a _properly_ crashed air-liner. Not much left...

Not to be a stickler, but the bombs dropped on Japan were fission bombs.  The U.S.
didn\'t detonate its first fusion bomb until the early 50\'s.

No.  The ship\'s exhaust is the easiest way to detect it.  A secondary approach
would be to use the ship\'s albedo.

>Wouldn\'t a ship 5 times the size be detectable at 5 times the range?

No, since the exhaust size is the primary factor and exhaust size is not dependent
upon the size of the ship.

Strictly speaking, only passive sensors sensitive to EM radiation are needed.  The
ship\'s exhaust will provide enough of a signature that detection will be trival.

EMAIL MAGAZINE CONCEPT

As most of you have no doubt noticed, I have been putting up some
pretty big posts.  I think that this may be sort of a drag for
those of you who just want to exchange ideas and short answers to
quick question and so on (but let me know if I\'m right, wrong or 
stupid).  
So...

I have been thinking of putting together a Traveller fanzine,
perhaps to be called The Imperial Exchange (though other name
ideas are welcome).  I originally thought that it might be a web-
based hyperzine, but that would be too much work, frankly.  Also,
I thought that perhaps The Traveller Chronicle might be a better
place to put CT/MT stuff, but from what I can see, it doesn\'t really
put out a lot of stuff on Traveller Classic (still my favorite). 
Anyone want to disagree with this last point?  Lily?
 
My newest idea is to create an email magazine.  It would have
short to medium articles on various subjects, and would be put
out quarterly.  It would emphasize Classic Traveller and
MegaTraveller.  The only problem with this is that it could not
easily contain images.  It is, of course, possible to attach a
list of images to an email message, but they could not be
inserted into text, I don\'t think.  Does anyone have any
solutions to this problem?  I\'m no email expert...

I\'d really like input from a lot of people on this topic,
positive or negative.  I think the e-magazine would take some of
the bigger blobs out of the mailing list and provide a good place
to publish amateur articles for pre-collapse Traveller stuff.

If I\'m wrong about the overly-long posts, please let me know...


SENSOR INFORMATION

This is in response to Roger Sanger\'s request for sensor info. 
There is a good treatment of it in an old product for Classic
Traveller called "Grand Survey".  They discuss the following
types of sensors:  Neutrino Sensor, EMS array, Densitometer, and
Neural energy scanner.  In the very likely event that you cannot
find a copy of "GS", here\'s the basic low-down:

Neutrino Sensor:  This detects particles put out by nuclear
reactions (both fission and fusion).  There is no way to "shield"
or "hold in" neutrinoes, as they pass easily through matter and
are very long-lasting particles.  As a ship\'s plant is nuclear
based, the NS is the first thing to detect a ship in combat mode
(i.e., a ship with its plant working and its transponder off). 
However, the position given by an NS is somewhat general, no good
for aiming with.  Also, the only info one gets about the target
is energy output of the powerplant.  The NS detects ships at
distances on the order of 1 to 10 light seconds, depending on how
much energy output the powerplant has and how good a sensor it
is.  This sensor is passive only.  That is, it is no good trying
to send out pulses of neutrinoes, they only pass through the
target and don\'t return.

Electromagnetic Spectrum Array:  A group of sensors detecting
everything from radio waves to gamma rays (including light, IR,
UV, microwaves, etc.).  If a ship has its transponder on (i.e.,
is not at battle stations), then the radio detector will be the
first thing to pick up the ship, probably at a range of several
million km (way out of combat range).  This is also the group of
sensors one uses to ID and target a ship once the NS has found
it.  I generally rule that a ship\'s configuration and size can be
determined long before combat range, while positive ID of ship
type can only be made at around 5 light seconds (and there\'s
still some ambiguity, you couldn\'t tell a Scout from a Seeker
except by performance).  EMS sensors can be passive.  Passive is
less effective, but active gives away your position automatically
to anyone in the vicinity (it\'s like turning on a flashlight in a
night fight, you can see other people, but they can see you even
better).  The EMS array can also be used prior to boarding a
disabled ship in order to find where resistance is hiding (it can
detect the IR signals of the troops unless they are somehow
shielded).

Densitometer:  This is basically a super-sensitive gravitometer. 
It detects the graviton output of matter.  In space combat, it
can be used to detect a ship that is running cold (plant off) or
to detect asteroids and such.  The range is max 500 000 kms for
ships and 50 000 kms for man-sized objects.  When one gets very
close to the enemy (500 km or less), it can be used to get a
rough picture of the interior of the ship before boarding.  The
Densitometer can be used to map out the interior of any
structure, and is very useful in prospecting.  This is a passive
sensor only.

Neural Energy Scanner:  This one is a little far-fetched.  It\'s
essentially a long-range EEG machine.  It picks up the electrical
signals from the nervous systems of living things.  It can
determine the race/species of a creature  being detected.  This
has an extremely short range, on the order of .5 km, so it is not
much use in combat.  Also, it cannot pick up signals through
hulls.  I picture it as a very finicky sensor which can be
thwarted easily be randomized magnetic field generators or
electromagnetic fluctuations of various sorts, as well as psi-
shields.  This is a passive sensor only.

Typically, military and scout ships will have all these sensors,
civilian ships only the first two.  Some of the info I have given
here disagrees with GS stuff, but agrees with other published
materials.


MORE SPACE COMBAT STUFF

I mentioned an article called "Planetary Invasions in Traveller"
a little while back.  It\'s in "Challenge #25" (the JTAS part of
it, natch).  It sheds light on some of the issues raised recently
regarding "pop-in...fire...pop-out" attacks and such.  Basically,
it asserts that attacking a planet is a very difficult thing to
do.  Ground based defenses are awesome by comparison to ship
based weapons.  If you just want to harass a planet with extreme
range fire, this can be accomplished, though the idea of jumping
in, attacking successfully and jumping out again without
suffering any consequences isn\'t plausible.  
On the other hand, invading and taking a planet is much worse. 
Any ship which lands to off-load troops is a sitting duck for any
orbiting defence satellite or starship, so you have to take out
every single one first.  To get close enough to the planet to land
troops, you have to be able to take an immense pounding from
ground-based meson weapons.

Okay, that enough from me for today...

with a rapid orbital velocity.  The rapid speed is needed to keep the 
craft from dropping straight in like a rock, and also allows lift/braking 
against the rarified atmosphere at high altitude.
But in Traveller, ships have contra-grav, so they should be able to lower 
themselves slowly into the atmosphere no matter what their shape, and 
they need not have high speed to keep them from crashing.  After 
all, if a bunch of Vacc-suited guys in an open-topped air-raft can do it, 
why can\'t a ship with contra-grav?  It would just take lots of extra time 
and maybe some medium-tough piloting rolls.

(or its albedo), so size doesn\'t matter.  I hate to disagree with Master\'s
and Johnson, but size does matter!  :-) 

A ship which is larger WILL tend to have a larger exhaust due to its (on
average) larger powerplant (I assume you mean heat exhaust or drive
exhaust).  Also, if you are detecting it by its albedo (I presume you mean
energy bouncing off the ship?), then a larger ship will give off a more
powerful signal due to its larger profile.  For instance, if the profile 
of a ship facing your sensor is 100 m^2 and each m^2 is putting out 1 
unit of energy, then a larger ship with a profile of 10000 m^2 will put 
out 100 times the absolute amount of energy.

However, the relationship between ship volume and detection range will not
be 1 to 1 as Roger Sanger hypothesized.  Instead it follows a square-cube
law.  For instance, consider a cubic ship 1000 m^3 in volume.  Each side
of it will be 10 x 10 = 100 m^2 in area.  If we now increase the ship\'s
volume 1000 times to 1 000 000 m^3, then the sides become 100 x 100 =
10000 m^2.  In other words, ship volume has gone up 1000 times, but its
average profile only goes up by 100 times.  This kind of thing will tend
to apply to the heat profiles of drives and such as well.

GDW\'s AHL box set had (on the back) a  set  of  mission  briefing
papers set at the time of the Solomani Rim War.  It mentions  the
Solomani have the SSS Retaliation (a  dreadnaught)  and  the  SSS
Ultimate Victory.  Presumably this means \'Solomani  Sphere  Ship\'
.. so now they would use SCS.

In the same \'document\' it also mentioned  the  Imperium  had  the
IS  Bard  Endeavour  (an  AHL  fleet  intruder).  I  would  guess
\'Imperial Ship\'.

However, this was around year 1000 and things (sometimes) change.
In FASA\'s High Passage magazine they used INS ... \'Imperial  Navy
Ship\'?

So \'IS\' is canonic but dated, \'INS\'  is  less  dated  but  third-
party.

This is part of a previous posting to TML; posted here in response to 
Roger Sanger\'s queries of a non-Virus Imperium.

 "The Third Imperium is predominantly noted for being the first empire in 
which two branches of humanity held the regins of power cojointly.  It is 
also noteworthy for the unique blend of conservativism and vitality which 
this sharing of power produced....
  As a result, the Third Imperium achieved an impressive balance between 
expansion and consolidation, international vigor and domestic security.  
However, despite the longevity of the Third Imperium and its many 
noteworthy achievements, it is perhaps best remembered for its fragile 
governmental structure and its final, tragic disintergration."

 "Few of the fledging polities that attempted to band together against the 
onset of the Short Dusk (hard Times) lasted more than a few years.  Only 
a dozen or so survived long enough to be absorbed when the Safes of the 
post-Rebellion factions began to reexpand.  However, the fact that so 
many interstellar polities did strive to link themselves in common cause 
against the threat of social and technological recidivism offers insight 
into why the Short Dusk will not become another Long Night....
 "What many see as the death throes of the Imperium will soon be known as 
the growth pains hearlding the approach of a newer, more mature scheme of 
interstellar governance.  The Imperium is not dying of old age - it is 
experiencing childhood\'s end."

(Both quotations taken from the MegaTraveller supplement Hard Times, 
describing situations from 1125 to post-1128. Copywrited by GDW, 1991)

Now, if you look carefully at the first quite, you\'d find a major, major 
bit of information missing - any mention of Virus.  And if you look at 
the second quote, you\'d find what almost everyone expected would 
eventually happen to Charted Space, post-Rebellion.  True, the Imperium 
would still be dead, but it would have been replaced by about a dozen New 
Empires (ie. nations that consider themselves sucessors to the Imperium) 
and New Republics (ie. nations that wish to found a completely new form of 
government) governments.  The political situation would resemble Europe 
after Rome, or maybe South America after the Spanish Empire.

Question: Assuming that Traveller: The New Era was published 1992 (I 
don\'t have the book with me), had GDW decided to brew up Virus by the 
time Hard Times was published?

Irony: Has the universe continued in it\'s usual, non-Virus way, the 
quotes above would have been completely accurate.  Moreover, in such a 
fractured environment, rebuilding the Imperium would, indeed, be impossible.

Ooops: I just forgot about our Solomani friends.  Was this the reason why 
GDW created Virus, to prevent the Solomani\'s from conquering everything?
Hmmm....

This thread is starting to get interesting...

I disagree about the poor sensor readings.

If you have a asteroidal-looking ship, and move away from your emergent 
point, then you increase your survivability, and can remain after your 
emergence flare reaches the planet.

Two things need clarifying here.
o   How bright is the emergence flare?
o   Based on the emergence flare brightness and the inverse square law, 
How likely are you to be detected?

The inverse square law works in your favour in two ways. Firstly, the 
emergence flare brightness is diminshing at the square of the distance it 
has travelled. Secondly, the area of space to be searched (from the 
planets point of view) is increasing with the distance. What I\'m getting 
at, is that unless someone had a sensor pointed in the rough direction of 
the flare, then it is likely that it will be missed. Also, that rough 
direction has to be more exact at greater distances.

One of the best methods of surviving the jump is to begin moving at an 
asteroid like speed away from your emergence point. After travelling for 
some time, and using passive sensors to determine the likelihood of 
anyone (i.e. nearby ship) watching, *change course* at least 60 degrees. 
Preferably to something near the plane of the ecliptic, to look like a 
rock coming in from the plane of the Oort cloud. That way, your past 
trail no longer goes through the emergence point (if some defender was 
bright enough to calculate it.) 

Best yet, assume a speed which gives a far orbit, like a comet. That way 
you look *exactly* like something that is supposed to be there (every 
2755.3 years or whatever). Basically assume a stable, highly eliptical 
solar orbit, or make like a passing rogue.  BTW I *love* the idea of the 
batteries. As an aside, Russian Sub design use batteries on the *outside* 
of the pressure hull. This gives a shorter life, and harder replacement, 
but they are then effective as ARMOR. What about using the excess space 
in an asteroid in a similar concept. Treat battery cages as rubble ( 
hell, thats what lithium hydride _looks_ like anyway.)

By giving the ship some spin it should be possible to deploy sensors on 
monofilament cable, or similar, to increase the effectiveness of your 
sensor array. (very biy, very specialised folding EMS array). The spin 
keeps the cables taught. The small size of the pods, and their passive 
nature would make them impossible to detect, unless you collided with it, 
or watched it occult another object (chances: < 1 in 10,000,000,000 on a 
good day). The only problem with this is that the spin axis should point 
near the target (assuming using Focal Plane Arrays as collectors). This 
could be a giveaway.

In terms of shooting at things;
A 6g Fighter 10 light-seconds away will move a maximum of 1/2 A * T^2. or 
3000m, but in terms of total flight time of the laser, that\'s 20 seconds, 
or a sphere of 12000m.

How many small (i.e. player) ships are likely to be able to fill even a 
3000 m radius sphere repeatedly? Thats  4,188,790,204.786 m3 in the 
probability sphere for the 6g fighter postulated elsewhere (at a distance 
of 10 light seconds).

When I can find my old High school physics texts, I will do up some more 
accurate calculations.

I will endeavour to take a few hours and get a really good procedure 
worked out. Of course house rules may make quite a difference to your 
perseption of it\'s usefulness.

I assume you mean "in TNE" as you state in the title of your original
post...

The Darrians are still humming along doing their old Darrian
thing. They still have their Special Branch ships, but they now have
functioning Star Triggers (thanks to an intrepid band of adventurers 
who finished the adventure in Alien Module 8) rather than fakes.
The Confederation is good buddies with the Regency, licensing a 
TL16 ship design to the Quarantine Service.

The Sword Worlders, alas, have fallen on harder times. All of the
Border Worlds and all but five of the Sword Worlds (and, unrelatedly,
the entire Islands Cluster) have been annexed by the Regency. The
remaining rump state agitates for liberation of the "occupied systems"
from the "Imperials" (sic), and some in said systems heed this
call. The exact reason for the annexation eludes me right now, but I
think it was some kind of "security" matter (but aren\'t all
annexations that way?).  Significant numbers of refugees were settled
in that region after they fled the trailing Deneb sector area during
the Virus outbreak, and their second- and third-generation descendants
now live along side the original Sword Worlders\' descendants, creating
a bit of tension.

plates work?  Obviously, there can be no answer of a purely scientific 
nature, but it\'s nice to have a fictional operating principle for 
technobabbling purposes.  

Here\'s my major concern:  Why do grav plates not exert their forces on 
other bodies outside the ship?  For instance, if you turn on a 1G floor 
field, then why does it not pull on the planet below you with a force of 
1G?  If you\'re using a 6G field to compensate for an average fighter\'s 
acceleration, you should throw whole solar systems into disarray!

The problem arises because gravity is (according to Einstein anyway) not 
really a "force" with quanta at all.  Gravity consists of bends in 
space-time into which bodies "fall".  Therefore, to create a 1G floor 
field, you\'ve got to create a bend in space-time equivalent to that made 
by a size 8 planet.  And this bend would have far-reaching effects.

I may  have a way of explaining away this problem, but I\'d like to see 
what other people say.  My explanation goes like this:  Traveller grav 
technology  cannot really produce attractive gravity, rather it only 
produces a repulsive kind of "contra-gravity" (otherwise, why no tractor 
beams?).  Negative gravity, by the way, is perfectly allowable by modern 
physics/cosmology, though it has never been observed.  Traveller gravitic 
systems (inertial compensators, repulsors, etc.) work by producing 
anti-gravitons which push on things.  A "floor field" is actually in the 
ceiling pushing down (this effect would be indistinguishable from the 
opposite set up).  The anti-gravitons, because they repulse one another, 
have a very rapidly diminishing effectiveness.  Instead of their force 
dropping with the square of the distance, it diminishes with the square 
of the square of the distance (or distance to the fourth).

So, what do you think?

Its not going to be as simple as all of that.  The albedo is influenced by 
size, but a far more important element (in terms of detection) would be 
material and finish.  A 100-meter shiny white aluminum ball is pretty easy to 
detect, while a 100 meter blackened ship made of stealth-enhancing materials 
would have a much lower albedo for detection purposes.  Also, the drive heat 
profile would be affected by tech level and overall drive efficiency; an 
inefficient or poorly-maintained power plant will generate a lot of heat, and a 
poorly-directed thrust exhaust will make a much larger sensor target.

On average, I would expect that a purpose-built military starship will probably 
have a detection albedo one-tenth the intensity of a typical civilian vessel of 
comparable size, and possibly one-hundreth the intensity of some older or 
poorly maintained ships.  For a modern example, compare the radar crosssections 
of a typical Learjet versus a non-stealth B-1 bomber.  The B-1 is probably 10 
times the size of the Learjet, but has a radar crosssection vastly smaller than 
that of the Learjet.  And then there is that WWII German transport (JU-54?) 
with the corrugated metal finish; that aircraft has a radar signature that 
makes it look larger than a big dirigible.

Check out this file on Joe Heck\'s ftp site:

ftp://deneb.cc.missouri.edu/PUB/Traveller/software/TNEUtil.sea

It is a program I wrote a couple of years ago that included sector
mapping and world generation.  I don\'t remember if I provided a generate
entire sector option or not.  This program follows the CT/MT main world
generation procedure quite closely (it provides optional extras to vary
the generation a little).

In response to Andrew Madden (x422):

> I disagree about the poor sensor readings.

In retrospect, you may be right.  You can just move the ship around and 
triangulate readings from several widely-spaced positions, effectively 
giving you a huge array size and good resolution, even at the huge 
distances involved.  Or use sensor drones.

True, but in well-defended places, you can bet every rock above 2 tons 
displacement is mapped, catalogued and tracked.

Good question.  I have always pictured it as being a fairly powerful 
burst of exotic particles.  The fact that the radiation emited is of an 
unusual type makes the flare more detectable.

That depends on how well-defended the place is.  For hi-pop worlds, you 
can bet the whole sky is checked every few seconds at least, if not 
constantly.

Great concept.
I like the second idea better due to the catalogueing thing I noted 
above.  Defenders would be more likely to accept that they had missed a 
far-orbit comet or rogue in their catalogue than an inner system asteroid.

Hmm, maybe, but I\'d hate to have my batteries blown off by the ship that 
caught me with my plants down (bad pun intended).  It might be better to 
put the adjacent to the powerplant or alongside the jump-drive capacitors.

Yup.  I like it!  The spin axis doesn\'t have to be right at the target if 
you don\'t want to appear obvious, though that reduces the array size.  And 
again, you could just do away with the array and triangulate small array 
measures from different positions in space as your ship moves along.

That\'s what makes fighters so hard to hit!

First of all, 10 light seconds is at best the extreme range for combat in my 
opinion, especially for hitting a fighter.  Anyway, you forget that you 
don\'t have to fill the whole sphere, you just have to send beams through 
a circular plane perpendicular to the direction of fire (i.e., the 
profile of the sphere).  Once the beams get there, they pass through the 
sphere effectively 
instaneously, so the third dimension is "factored out".  Also, if one 
assumes the fighter has an equal likelihood of being anywhere in the 
sphere, then you can concentrate your fire mostly near the center of the 
circular area.  The reason I say this is that there is more of the 
sphere\'s volume subtended by the central areas of the circle.

Now, if you can measure the output of the ship\'s drives, then 
you can tell approximately by how much it is  changing its vector and 
thus greatly narrow down the area it might be hiding in.  If the ship 
accelerated at its full 6 G\'s, for instance, it will have to be somewhere 
on the surface 
of its "probability sphere", it cannot be in the interior of it.  You can also 
narrow down the area by common sense.  For instance, a ship running from 
you will be unlikely to use maximum deceleration as a dodgeing tactic.

Also, I think you are underestimating the firing rates of the weapons 
involved.  A single laser turret could conceivably fire several thousand 
times in a 1000 second round.  Missiles, on the other hand, don\'t have 
any of these problems, since they can close and thus reduce the signal 
lag.  

Still, this discussion points out an interesting thing:  it should get 
exponentially more difficult to hit and damage a target as distance 
increases, as the "probability bubble" grows exponentially.

Given: 

	1. A target at 3 light second\'s distance. (much more realistic, in my 
opinion, than the 10 light second figure that has been thrown around).
	2. A target profile of 200 m^2 (roughly far-trader sized).
	3. Target acceleration of up to 2 G\'s.

	When a shot reaches the enemy, it will have been moving for 6
seconds (3 seconds for signal to reach sensors, 3 seconds for the shot to
get there). 

	In 6 seconds, the target can move 10 * 6*6 meters, or 360 meters,
maximum. 

	That means that the area in which the target could be is
effectively a circle (not a sphere, for reasons I and others have noted)
with an area of about 400 000 m^2. (3.14 * 360 * 360 = 406944)

	Therefore, if one divides the "probability circle" area by the
target profile area, there are roughly 2000 "locations" the ship could be
in. (400 000 / 200 = 2000). 

	If an attacking ship can fire 1000 shots (1 a second) in a round,
then it has roughly a 50% chance to hit the target, and that\'s without
adding in the "common sense" and "gunner\'s intuition" factors.  It also
does not take into account the fact that one can improve chances of a hit
by concentrating fire on the center of the "probability circle", again for
reaons I have noted previously. 

	Now, I realize the above example isn\'t perfect.  For one thing, as
each shot is fired, the target continues moving, so one might at first
think that the "probability circle" would be continually growing as shots
were fired.  But, the sensor information is also continally being updated,
meaning the size of the sphere stays the same (though its position is
changing).  So the example is only roughly correct, but it does serve to
show that you have pretty good chances to hit assuming a high firing rate.

Folks say there\'s a "flare" when you jump in (must be a MT thing, I
don\'t recall it from CT). There *has* to be a range limit on this, or
folks would be sending out salvage crews to pick up the ships that
misjumped and landed a few thousand AU short...

So, that means it *is* possible to jump into the outer system
undetected, though it may be *way* out there.

By some strange coincidence <g> this is one of the better locations for
undetected refueling. You\'re in one of the cometary halo areas if you
are more than a hundred or so AU out. So careful observuing with a
one meter or so telescope for a day or three will give you tyhe
locations of some "nearby" bodies, and they are almost guaranteed to be
icy (ice largely, if not entirely made of various ices).

Bingo, supply some heat, and you\'ve got a something to feed thru the
fuel refining gear.

And given that these bodies are likely to be *kilometers* in diameter,
you\'ve got all the fuel a clandestine listening post could want. Plus a
nice "secret" refueling base. Nobody but the skipper anfd the
navigators (and maybe sensor techs) will have any idea *where* the ship
is. The Star will just be another star in the sky. :-)

Locating such a base is next to impossible. There\'s just too many cubic
AUs to search.

Now we come to the "hit and run" attack. 

Most likely is a planned "Pearl Harbor" type attack. Either to get a
quick surrender or to just plain pulverize an important world so that
you don\'t have to worry about it.

If I was doing it, I\'d look for a Ceres sized body that was still
fairly icy. On such a body it wouldn\'t be impossible to bore a tunnel
completely thru it. Nor would it be impossible to "nudge" the rotation
until it was lined up favorably (orbital motion hardly counts when you
are dealing with something that far out).

So, we now have a 1000km long tunnel. We build a mass-driver into it.
At 100 gee, the projectile will be moving at roughly 45 km/s when it
exits. At 1000 gee, it\'ll be moving around 140 km/s. We could build
such a driver. At higher TLs, higher accelerations ought to be
possible. 10k gee gives 450 km/s, 100k gives 1400, and 1 million gives
4500 (1.5% of c). 

Even a 1 ton projectile at those velocities is equivalent to a *large*
nuke. And a 1 ton *mass*, stealthed projectile made of say, nickel
iron, will be all of 125 *liters* (that\'s .125 kl). That\'s a sphere 38
cm radius (or 15 inches). Or to put it another way, it\'s about the size
of an 18 inch shell.

Terminal guidance *is* possible, even with *current* electronics. And
detecting this puppy could be *very* difficult. I seriously doubt it
could be detected before it got within a few light seconds. Which means
that backtracking it would be a *bitch*. You only have a ridiculously
small portion of the track to extrapolate from. You couldn\'t get within
billions of km.

Bad news is that it\'d take 4000 days from 100 AU at 45 km/s. Only 1000
at 140km/s. But at 450 it drops to 400 days, at 1400 it\'s 100 days, and
at 4500 gives 40 days. 

A major undertaking? Sure. It\'s a big project. But it\'s not an
*unreasonable* project. And take another look at that 1 million gee
version. At those speeds you are talking about a planet wrecker. And
the whole inner system covers such a small arc that aiming can be
handled by course corrections *after* the projectile leaves the
launcher.

Oh yeah, at 1.5% of c, if you can detect it 30 light seconds out
(bloody unlikely), the dectection message will get to you 1970 seconds
(32 min, 50 sec) before the projectile hits.  If you can only detect to
10 light seconds, you get 10 minutes, 50 seconds of warning. And if you
only detect it at 1 light second, you have 65 seconds to say your
prayers.

Someone mentioned reaction to the massdriver attack on the Narn
homeworld in last week\'s Babylon 5 episode as an example of why such
weapons wouldn\'t be used. I point to the same attack as an example of
how effective treaties about such things are when the chips are down. 

The *only* thing preventing me from doing you in this way is the fear
that you might do *me* in.

BTW, if anybody bothers to work out the costs of the massdriver and
base in CT. MT and even TNE, go ahead and post them.

I am a sad traditionalist. The first time in CT I realised how much the grav
pods cost just to lift one air-raft, I immediately concluded that full
contra-grav for a ship would be prohibitively expensive. A few old designs
intended to be really flashy yachts (e.g. the Lone Dragon from an old White
Dwarf scenario) increased their costs and had anti-grav units specifically
allocated to the job of in-gravity maneouvre. The manouevre drive itself I
have play ala Starship Op\'s Manual, i.e. it can only redirect a small amount
of its thrust off the main ship\'s axis - i.e. you have to be streamlined and
glide in, or come straight down on your tail. Only in the latter case can
you have any chance of \'hovering\' down slowly if un-streamlined, unless you
have 6G drives, in which case the % of G you can direct off-axis might be
enough to counter an Earth-type world\'s 1G gravity. (shouldn\'t G be g
anyway?). If we assume hovering in a dispersed structure on its tail is a
pretty risky thing ("Hey, watch out for that gust of wind..." - is everyone
assuming nice sunny days or can these planets be like the nasty storm-swept
one in Alien?) then we must consider landing. If a non-streamlined ship
isn\'t designed to land then it won\'t have anything other than emergency
landing gear (no manufacturer will put on unnecessary extras like that if it
means his ship will cost more than a competitor). Then there are dispersed
structures or even planetoids. Not normally nice flat evenly spread things
to try to land on a non-flat planet (or even at a nice flat starport). "This
is cap\'n Humbug of the planetoid Bull, to all ship\'s personnel. We have
landed safely... errrr... but we seem to be rolling down-hill..."

That\'s just how I\'d play it. If you don\'t like, don\'t use...

Yes, but this was a Solomani document, so I guess they weren\'t to
picky about Imperial designations.  I\'d say INS was the Imperium\'s
usage.

But before the Virus, the Solomani had taken to bickering amongst
themselves.  It is pretty easy to argue that the Confederation had so
many diverse member states that the only reason they remained cohesive
for the last century was the Imperial Threat.  With that gone, the
Confederation splits along internal divisions, and each member state
goes it alone.  In fact, the only area which may remain as the
Solomani Confederation may be that part of the Imperium (semi)willing
reabsorbed!

If my campaign ever gets into Hard Times, the main protagonists are
going to be wiped out, for being so stupid!  My favourite scenario to
date has Dulinor\'s secretly rebuilt fleet penetrating to Capital
(instead of hitting the Virus), defeating Lucan, and then just after
Lucan has been executed, and Aslan assasin (assisted by the remnants
of the disbanded Aslan Imperial Guard) challenges and kills Dulinor
for knocking off the ambassador.  The power vacuum left by
decapitation of what are still the two most powerful factions results
in such chaos across the heart of the Imperium that the remaining
factions cannot gain a hold on any significant portion.  Then perhaps
a Short Dusk, or maybe something longer.

A larger ship will have a correspondingly larger power plant only if the 
designers of the ship feel that it is important to have the same performance
as the smaller version.  My point was that exhaust size is a function of the
sizes of the maneuver drive and power plant and not of the ship itself.

The albedo (amount of energy reflected from a ship) of a ship is also not
dependent upon the size of the ship but on the materials from which the EM
radiation is bouncing off.  While it is true that given two civilian ships, 
one being 100 tonnes and another being 1000 tonnes, the former will generally
have a lower albedo than the latter, this is not a hard and fast rule.  A 
1000 ton pirate ship, equipped with special radar-absorbing paint, may well 
have a albedo much lower than a 100 ton scout/courier.

Maybe I\'m just nitpicking, but I wanted to make clear that the visibility of
a ship\'s exhaust and the albedo of a ship are not really related to size, it 
just works out that way most of the time.

In fact, I see an adventure possibility here.  The naive merchant captain 
identifies the ship (not having Sensor Ops skill) has being between 100 and 
200 tonnes based on the albedo and the drive exhaust.  Of course, the 10,000 
ton camouflage-painted Zhodani warship tricked the captain by powering down 
the exhaust ...

Its not going to be as simple as all of that.  The albedo is influenced by

I agree, I was assuming that those factors would be held constant, seeing 
as all ships in Traveller are said to be made out of "hull metal", 
whatever that is.  Also, nowhere in any of the design rules (book 2, High 
Guard)  does it have any mention of differing hull materials.  These 
would presumably cost different amounts, and no price diffs are given 
between military and civilian ship hulls.  I does make sense, though, 
that military ships would have "stealth" coatings of some sort. Still, 
for a given hull material/finish, a larger ship will be easier to 
detect. 

Also, if you are making initial detection based on neutrinoes emited
from the powerplant, then the ship\'s detectability would be entirely 
dependent on its plant output/size, which does tend to rise with the 
ship\'s size.  Your assertion that military ships would be better 
maintained and "less leaky" would make sense if you could shield-in 
neutrinoes, but you can\'t.  A neutrino can pass through something like 4 
light-years of lead on average before interacting with a single atom.  
Nothing you put around the drive could reduce their output rate.

And, as you pointed out, there are definately examples of military craft 
with huge signatures, even when size is factored out.

I don\'t think there\'s any canon from GDW on the subject, and I don\'t
know how others deal with it, but here\'s a re-post of the a message
I mailed to the XBoat list a few months back (in response to a question
about ships jumping from inside other ships.)

Anyway, the above posited behavior makes for easy and predictable effects

Leonard Erickson posted an idea for landing on an Oort cloud body and
melting it for fuel.  His claim was that such an undertaking would be
impossible to detect because there are "just too many cubic AU\'s to
search".  But, you don\'t have to search cubic AU\'s, you just have to have
sensors pointed at every part of the sky.  In other words, you, as a
defending sensor operator on a world, have to cover all *directions*, not
all units of volume.  There are some SETI ideas right now that would cover
10% of the sky continuously using only present day technology (radio
telescopes).  If you were to change their directions once every few 
seconds, you could cover the whole sky each minute.  If you assume higher 
technology and a MUCH more powerful motivating influence (i.e., survival 
instinct), then it is likely that most worlds will do *at least* this.  
They could then pick up the heat needed to melt the asteroid for fuel.  
Furthermore, if the Oort cloud is a good source of fuel, then it will 
definately be scanned for just this sort of activity.  

Remember, if you can think it up, the defenders have already done so, as
they are highly motivated to figure out anything you might do to kill
them. 

Leonard Erickson also posted an interesting idea about building a mass
driver in the outer system.  I don\'t think this is plausible either. 
You\'re talking a fairly big industrial effort here.  And, taking into
consideration the kind of monitoring I noted above as a *minimum*, you
would be picked up long before you finish the project.  Furthermore,
planetary defenses are going to be able to mash any asteroid you send at
them in under a minute.  A few big meson guns, firing at whatever rate
their mechanisms can handle (since aiming is not a consideration for a
non-maneuvering body) could pump out some serious destructive energy. 
And they don\'t have to vaporize it, just crack it into smaller masses and its
course will change or the peices will be vaporized by atmospheric
friction.  Vaccuum worlds, as previously posted, would build installations
deep enough to protect againt all but the biggest hits as a matter of
course. 

The bottom line, IMNSHO, is that both the above ideas might be possible, 
but they would be extremely difficult to pull off.

Response to Andy LiLLy ;-)

Bringing a ship in on its tail should not be a problem, even in a gusty 
wind.  The ship\'s sensors can presumably detect wind variations, and the 
computer can work out minute "tilts" needed to compensate.  Even a model 
1 probably make a Cray look like a 4-function calculator, so I don\'t 
think this would be a processing challenge.

In terms of landing gear, you won\'t need any if there\'s water around.  
The ship will float, assuming it\'s average density is that of liquid 
hydrogen (as the design rules do).

It might be real tricky with a planetoid ship or dispersed structure, but 
otherwise...

Yes, I agree, but see my other posting in this issue on this topic.

There have been a few questions asked Re: lasers  
that haven\'t yet been answered, so here is my contribution.
I hope it helps.

	Re: Lasers; Any beam of light will diverge from a perfect 
line by an angle given approximately by:

Theta = 1.2 L/d

where Theta is in radians, L is the wavelength of the light, and 
d is the diameter of the focal array. 
eg. for a 1-meter array and 10^-7 m light ( 1000 Angstroms, EUV)

Theta = 1.2 * 10^-7

This angle is useful for the following reason: the spot size on the target
will be (again approximately, since I\'m using the small-angle approx.
sin(x) ~ x for small x )

S = Theta * D ,  where D is distance to target.

THe area of the spot is then Pi * S^2

Conservation of energy implies that the energy flux put into the beam 
be spread over the spot area. Thus 

I = E * d^2 / ( 4 * L^2 * D^2 ), where  I is intensity in Mj per square
meter, E is input Mj, and d, L and D are all in metres.

At least this is what I\'m thinking right now. Mind you, it\'s rather
late and my brain is quite fried, so there might be a few mistakes in there..

However, the important point to remember is that a laser weakens at 
large distances above all by being spread out. A while back someone 
claimed a laser would be "a pencil-thin beam too weak to do any damage"..
not so....it gets bigger with distance, not smaller.
 
There has been some talk about laser combat at ranges around 10
light-seconds. Keep in mind that for the above mentioned EUV laser
at that range the spot diameter will be on the order of 300 meters.
=> energy per square meter is (input energy / Pi* 90,000). In TTNE they 
talk about 150 Mj lasers. that kind of input energy will result in a
few kilojoules per square meter. Thus grav focussing. At that point, 
you\'ve pretty much thrown physics out the window. Which is sort of 
a point of the game... However, the easiest way to compromise is to 
say that Grav focussing  changes the apparent aperture diameter. 

What\'s really cool is that you can apply these same formulas to a 
beam of neutral particles such as neutrons, using L = h*c/E where
E is the energy per particle, c the speed of light and h is Plancks Constant.
Be that as it may, the result is that L is many orders of magnitude
smaller for Neutrons -> thus a neutron beam will not diverge as quickly
as a laser beam. which is why you would expect an NPAW to be a long-range 
weapon. 

Final point: I vaguely recall someone claiming that mesons actually
could penetrate matter without resistance. I\'m afraid that is 
simply not true. The might not scatter off of electrons, but they do 
scatter off of nuclei.  Thus you have to sort of cough discreetly
and wave your hands when you\'re explaining how a meson gun works.
But that doesn\'t mean they\'re not cool, and this IS a scifi game, right?

Cheers,
/ben

I always paint them flat black, assuming that that would be

virtually no light and therefore be hardest to see.  I 
assume that the radar-absorbent camouflage doesn\'t have to 
be any particular color, and is therefore black, too.  

To develop some visual interest, I usually put on some
small insignia and pick out some details.

Is my concern with visual observation unnecessary in light

isn\'t normally part of space combat, I would want to have

Civilian and other non-military ships of course reflect
their owner\'s desires (often in the form of corporate or
governmental policy, and are usually brightly colored to
facilitate rescue and general rendezvous activities. They
may also use radar-reflective paint (or alloy tiles or
whatever) to make themselves easier to see.

Signal GK (adventure # something) shows a silicate self-replicating
life-form, which was compatable (mostly) with imperial computer tech. It
was enslaved and by 1110 was the basis of imperial transponders. More data
available in Survival Margin or TNE.

That\'s the only one I\'ve seen outside of purely medical references in TD
15-20.

What kind of missiles are you talking about? Take a look at Special
Supplement 3 - Missiles, and you\'ll find out that starship missile payloads
are relatively WEAK things... the missiles are 15x100cm, and mostly
propulsion. Non nuclear missiles get 2-4 hits per 10 kg of explosive. CT
missiles are not allowed to exceed 50 kg, so you could get about 45kg on
the slowest, stupidest missile allowed for a turret launcher. That won\'t
throw a 100ton vessel around at even 1 g, let alone at 10g\'s. Simple
momentum-mass-conservation_of_energy factors at work here.

My simple eplanations (not overly detailed) is that gravitics break down
into two fields: anti-grav and artificial grav.

Antigravs generate thrust. They do this by acting upon the existing gravity
well, and the energy of the system is maintained. Basically they use the
gravity well as a lever, and use the energy of the bodies in the system as
their reaction mass.

Artificial gravity I treat as a field existing between two plates, by flow
of pseudo-gravitons.

Neither of these match any cannonical sources I have found, but work well
in play. Note that my theory of Anti-grav and thruster plates prevents
using T-plates for interstellar travel... the gravity wells are strong
enough to push against.

           1g = 7m/s (I know this isn\'t accurate, but is good enough for
example.)

Remember that the target has a vector to begin with. He (in theory, at
least, if not in the actual game) has the ability to use some, all, or
(lord knows why under CT/MT) NONE of his acceleration to change his vector.

All fire has a vector, even lasers. In CT, a laser\'s vector is 1000 ls per
turn.
You have to get the laser to intercept the target, who could be within 1
turns worth of accelleration in any direction from the endpoint of her
previous (start-turn) vector. The length of your beam is (in LS) equal to
the duration of the beam... probably about 0.1 to 5 seconds.

Then stretch this back through the turn to find the cone of possible
vectors. Now add in the age of your data, and this increases the size of
the cone.

Next, saturate the entire cone with energy from the projected time of
arrival of your energy to encompass where she\'ll be when your fire gets to
the target\'s possible areas. It\'s a miracle that a target could be hit at
all past a few dozen LS, especially when one considers a 100m long vessel.
for a target at 5 LS: you have to make predictions in the 10 second range.
That target will have 70m/sec of accelleration, and be up to 385m per Gfrom
where it\'s vector WHEN you fired was. (7+14+21+28+35+42+49+56+63+70=385).
dividing this by basic length (vol^(2/3)), you get 3.85. Multiply this by
it\'self and pi to find area in Length by length sections, or minimum shots
for saturation. This is small enough an area to saturate with fire in a
circular area, as a 1 sec long burst is 300,000,000 meters long. 47 shots,
well placed, shoult be able to land 1 on her.

Take the same vessel at 12 LS, with 3G\'s (an old destroyer, say?).
24 seconds prediction time( 12 sec old data, 12 sec laser return time),
target max accell of 21m/s/s
Target max vector change: 6299 m
Meters: 21+41+63+84+105+126+147+168+189+210+231+252+273+294+315
Second:  1  2  3  4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15

Meters: +336+357+378+399+420+441+462+483+504
Second:   16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24

Saturate the cross section. 0.1 second pulses are still plenty long to
treat it as a cross-section. 12466 pulses required to place 1 per 100mx100m
segment of it\'s probable location cone intersect. that\'s 12466 pulses in a
VOLLEY. (assuming 10 shots per turret per second) that\'s a whopping 1250
turrets mounted. Just to assure 1 hit.

Keep this in mind. Also, when the cone gets to be longer than the length of
pulse (for this example, 0.1 sec, or 30 million meters) you must then
figure on saturating the area twice in that 1 second intercept, as the
length of the beam is now not long enough to cross the targe\'t sphere. If
you use faster pulses, the spheroid nature of target probaility becomes
important.

I normally allow for the cameleon option on military hulls, especially
scouts. A scout Operational livery would probably be based upon it\'s
current status:

XBoat: Bright Metal to allow tender aquisition
Survey, in space: Flat black
Survey, on world: appropriate cammo on top; Sky blue below.
Internal ops: Scout Blue-grey.

Naval cammo should reflect the nature of it\'s current mission. Landing
ships need the same type of cammo as scouts on downside survey. Ships of
the line need black with white speckles (moving stargrid is harder to see
tham total occlusion, or so it seems from the astronomy I have read.)

No you can\'t. Sensors have a limit known as "angular resolution". That
means that they can\'t resolve things that subtend less than their
angular resolution. The higher the angular resolution, the *wider* the
sensor array has tto be, abd thus the hard it is to turn.

For refeuling and observation, all you need is a body in the 1 km
range. 1 AU is 150e6 km. So 100 is 1.5e9 km. What\'s arctan 1/1.5e9?
Answer, a *very* small angle.

Again, you are wrong. If I do the melting on the "back" side of the
body, they won\'t be able to *see* the "heat" because it\'ll all be
radiating in the wrong direction.

But how it is scanned, and from *where* make a big difference. And
there is a distinct limit to how paranoid you can *afford* to be.

BTW, if your sensors are good enough to pick this sort of thing up at
100 AU, they\'ll get *fried* by the incredibly stronger signals from
things like other planets in the system, and ships manuevering.

This is one of the *major* limits on astronomy right now. There\'s too
much background noise.

But they have to balance the assumed likelihood of it happening vs the
costs of protecting against it.

We know damn well that a medium sized asteroid could wipe us out, but
we are only making half-hearted efforts to do anything about it.

But I\'m *not* sending an asteroid. I\'m sending a dinky little 1 ton
chunk of nickel iron, well stealthed, and equipped with manuevering
jets to make midcourse corrections. Less than half a meter across.

And what are the odds of them being able to hit a target that small at
several light seconds? Answer, just about nil.

The course *won\'t* change. Physics doesn\'t work that way. The pieces
will start spreading, but they should all hit a target the size of a
planet. And "vaporising in the atmosphere" sound great. But it isn\'t.
The *full* impact energy will go into the planet\'s atmosphere *if* the
pieces vaporise. That could ruin the planet right there.

For example, the million gee version will dump approximatelly 500
megatons into what it hits. That\'s enough to *kill* all unshielded
personnel on that side of the planet, and change global weather
patterns. It\'s also not certain that pieces travelling at 1.5% of c
will have *time* to vaporise.

On a vacuum world, you\'d have to dig one *hell* of a long way to be
same. Tens to hundreds of kilometers. And again, the radiation (X-rays
and gammas) from the plasma cloud would be lethal for hundreds or
thousands of km. You *don\'t* harden gear against *that* level of
radiation.

So, although I know that all the "old hands" on both of these lists

It has an ISBN number in the ad for it in the back of COACC, but I\'ve

    'body' => 'Hi all,
	I felt it was time to add something to the MD debate..

While it\'s a nice idea, it\'s not quite such a sure-fire thing as 
you might like, for several reasons;
a) physics. A 1-ton projectile travelling at 1.5% c has roughly 
10^23 ergs of kinetic energy. this is a lot (500 Megatons is 
reasonable)  and is roughly enough energy to vaporise about a 
million tons of water or dirt, etc. This would certainly
ruin your day if you got in the way -but it would NOT significantly
damage a planets biosphere, nor destroy "everyone on the side of the 
planet"
Bad news for a starport or other base  o even a city - not a planet buster.

Also, keep in mind that while we might not be able to do much 
about a rock of that kind today - a TL-15 world probably would.
after all, anti-ship missles are quite small and equally stealthed,yet 
point defence systems can deal with them. a 1.5%c rock would 
probably be detected - if for no other reason than that any EM radiation 
bounced off of it would be quite noticeably doppler-shifted. 
Once detected it can be dealt with by military forces. (more on that in a moment)
You talk about angular resolution. well, there is such a thing as interferometry. already there is semi-serious talk among astronomers of optical 
interferometers with orbital baselines. in the radio we already have VLBI.
the angular resolution you can get is quite amazing. 
I would be very disappointed if they didn\'t have stuff better than that 
at TL-15. Numbers? well, the angle subtended by a 1km rock at 100 AU is 
about 6*10^-11 radians. To resolve this with 5000 Angstrom visible light
 you need 
a baseline of 7500 meters. That\'s not really that bad....


Another point - you talk about mid-course corrections. You will need rather 
powerful thrusters to make a noticeable change in course, because of your 
high velocity. THose thrusters will be seen. they will also require power. 
are you going to put a power plant on your rock - or just solid bossters. ?
and if you do, then it\'s not a rock, it\'s a missile or guided bomb. which makes
knocking it out easier - you don\'t need to deflect it or vaporize it - just 
fry its guidance and it will miss. that is easy with a laser or five.

No, the best apprach is to launch an unguided rock with high precision. which 
unfortunately means that you have to be rather close by. 

And by the way - how do you want to get you 1 million gee accelleration? 
THat\'s a pretty powerful accellerator.. how are you going to power it.?
batteries? You can\'t use fusion, you know, or you will be seen.

this brings us to the second major area of objection;

logistics. So, you want to spend several months or years building this MD 
deep inside a 1km iceball in the Oort cloud of one system. Cool. that means
you have to figure out how to set up a virtual construction site with ships 
coming and going... you\'ve red the debate about jump flashes. I will leave that be since it has already been discussed to death. 
But not only that, your MD will not be very moveable. fine, you can hit any
base in one system. but if that system doesn\'t happen to be a depot, what 
have you won?. the enemy will start to get a clue once ner lightspeed rocks 
start flying out of the void and zapping their bases. 
  
To summarize; if you\'re willing to spend more money building this thing 
than the enemy is in keeping a watchful eye (with sensor drones no doubt),
AND if you won\'t need to move the asset, AND if you merely want to vaporize 
a few bases, THEN fine, go for it. 

I\'d rahter spend the money on a few Tigresses, so i could defend 
my home base, and then jump  in one fine day and nuke the planet - using 
screens, point defence lasers, and armor to survive until I was close enogh 
for a few nukes to do the job.

True enough.  I\'ve been trying to come up with a reasonable scan rate
for various sensors, however.  What is the size of the field of a 7500m
array?  How bright is the source----and how long will your detector have
to integrate to even have an object to resolve?

This is actually a pretty interesting problem.

If close enough, they woould pick up escape gasses. 1 au wouldn\'t be clse
enough at all. While they might be able to see you on the front, they won\'t
have a whole lot of energy to get from it.

Wrongo. we 1995 earthers can hit outter planets at 10+AU with really stupid
little probes using ion thrusters (post launch). Now add on-board guidance.
Forget lasers, they spread too much.

Earth is constantly being hit with several tons per week of miniscule
debris. (more probable, but I don\'t have the figures handy) Vaporization of
a whole cloud of chunks is MUCH less of a disaster than one big thud, which
adds vibrational, impact, and dust effects. And an explosion that can break
it will spread the parts out.

500 Megatons is just a big boom. Asteroidal impacts will not have the same
radiation profile as nukes. The MT rating is a matter of how much DYNAMITE
is it\'s explosion equal to.

Based upon MT sources, the rebellion would have ended with the short night,
and ended with 6-8 domain sized governments controlling pieces of the 3rd
Imperium. The strongest would be the Solomani (largest, but serious
internal problems), Domain of Deneb/Regency (Most able to apply force, most
adaptable), and the Ziru Sirkaa (Domain of Vland). The real strephon was
(we find out in TNE\'s Regency Sourcebook) really Strephon! Hard times shows
us the effects of the war. Very gruesome. (About 1/3 as bad as the virus,
overall.)

I realize that.  If you put a few satellites around your planet in an 
orbit a million kms out, you can easily and affordably get an array 2 
million kms wide.  If that\'s not enough, you can put them 10 million kms 
apart.  Whatever it takes.

But you don\'t have to detect the body, just all the neutrinoes coming off 
your power source (assuming it\'s nuclear).

Maybe, but you\'d have to be careful not to let any hot gases leak.  Also, 
depending on how much heat you generate, it could radiate through a small 
body or show up in any traces of "atmosphere" it has (i.e. gases which 
have floated off and accumulated around the body, not gravitically held 
there, but orbiting with it).  And there\'s still the neutrino problem.  I 
think you would have a hard time.

It doesn\'t cost much to put a few hundred or even a few thousand  
mass-produced sensor buoys all over the system (including the Oort cloud, 
if that\'s a consideration).  Besides, can you really put a price on peace 
of mind? :-)

The sensors won\'t get fried.  You simply adjust their sensitivity to 
whatever level of signal you\'re looking at.  The human eye does this, and 
can thus handle signals varying along 14 log units in intensity.  You 
think a mechanical sensor can\'t be built to handle the same thing?

Any level of background noise can be factored out as a known constant.  
Again, the human eye can do it, why can\'t a machine?

They would also factor in what\'s at stake.  As I mentioned, the cost of 
putting a LOT of sensor buoys all over the place is small.  And this 
network would provide very powerful detection abilities by coordinating 
signals and triangulating.

Personally, I think the reason we are not doing much about it is that

Ah, it has jets on it.  I must have missed that in your last post.  That 
changes alot.  I was thinking something which was coming in on an 
unchangeing vector.  No matter how small an object is, if it is ballistic 
then it should be trivial to eliminate it.

I disagree.  They could cover a huge area with overlapping fire, making a 
"beaten zone" through which the asteroid has to come to reach the planet.  The 
asteroid could thus be vaporized.  At the speed it\'s going, no matter 
what size thrusters you put on it, it\'s not going to be able to change 
course that much, so it will have to come through a predictable area.

Depending on the distance you hit them at, they may in fact miss the 
planet.  Also, any peices which hit the atmosphere at a low enough angle 
will "skip off".  Even if this is a consideration, all it means is you do 
have to vaporize the asteroid, which you can do.

I dont\' think 10 kms down is excessive.
If you\'re putting in 500 Megatons, you\'re basically hitting them with a 
medium-level nuclear bombardment.  Of course you\'d do damage, but you 
won\'t crack the planet open.  Anyway, I don\'t think it\'s that difficult 
to vaporize the thing.  If you bust it up into small enough bits, the 
impact will be spread out enough that its not a biggie.

> Not as difficult as you may think. :-)

Yes, as difficult as I think!  :-)  You\'d never be able to get the thing 
built before you were discovered anyway!

1.      EMERGENCE FLARES

I think you are all arguing about the definition. There is no "canaon" about
a ships producing a flare when jumping. I believe that the SOP reference was
just a throw-away line designed to add some chrome and pizzazz to jumping.
Chrome should not suddenly turn into rules.

..of course, in your own campaign, you can do whatever you want. In my
campaign, you generally cannot tell where a ship is jumping to, and the
"flare" is not bright enough to be detectable beyond Visual range (ie 50km,
according to digest 7 (?)). If you were close enough to the ship to see it
jump, you could predict a possible course based on how the ship\'s jump grid
was activated. Of course, for Zhos or non-standard ships, this would require
some time to accurately computer-model what occurred...

The Darrians recovered the Entropic Worlds in the 5FW. The SW lost the Border

There are a few references to nanosugical techniques. I don\'t remeber if
they were merely off-hand or significant. TD 15+ had a section called
"Medical Digest", covering purely medical rules for MT.

    'body' => 'Just a short question to Mr. Hostman.
Could you please explain how you got your numbers for how far a target ship 
could move between the time you detected it and your shots arrive...?
Last time I checked, the distance an accellerating body could cover was 
given by x = 0.5*A*t^2.
thus for a = 21 ms^-2  and t = 24 => x = 6048.

Another thing to keep in mind is that most ships cannot accellerate equally
well in all directions - they have to rotate their thrust axis. this takes time, and screwes up 
their own firing solutions. not to mention gives everyone severe cases of 
space-sickness if the ship lacks grav compensators. (recall the PLanet class
heavy cruiser in Rebellion sourcebook. :) thus the worst possible shape 
as far as evasive agility is concered is a long cylinder or dart.(preferred axis of rotation aligned with thrust axis) the best 
is a sphere, or a slab with the thrust axis aligned with the short side. 
I would imagine the best compromise between agility, atmospheric performance and stealth would be a T or a flying wing a-la B2.

Now, based on what has been mentioned re "probability bells of position" it
would seem that the best way to evade is to move on a plane perpendicular 
to the axis between the firer and the target, as well as to the velocity 
vector of the target. that way you maximize the apparent change of angle...
eg. if your ship is built like a standard free trader (down is pointng 
ventrally, not toward the tail) and you are being fired upon by someone straight off the starboard broadside, you should pull "up" or "down". If you are shaped like a B2 not only are you able to rotate quickly along that axis (pitch), 
you also present the smallest aspect... But on the other hand, if you are 
shaped like a B2 and the enemy is directly "above", you\'re hosed.
These things are very likely to be taken into account by a good designer, with
design reflecting relative importance of agility, stealth, mass,e tc.
Although it is interesting that the sphere not only wins the all-round 
agility contest, it is also the most mass-efficient. too bad it\'s so UGLY.

this is also  also exactly the kind of thing that "Predict" is designed to consider.In other words, each different target will ahve preferred axis of rotation, 
preferred arcs of fire (spinal mount), varying aspect area, etc.. 
I can easily see how you would need a good AI Expert system to deal with 
all the parameters in real time - as well as the knack of a good gunner.

switching topic to artificial grav - I think that one wouldn\'t need to worry 
about a 6-G fighter messing up solar systems. since the fighter is slightly
less massive than a planet, and assuming you aren\'t violating conservation of momentum what will move is the fighter - not the planet. although this might be annoying if you don\'t want to go towards the planet.
I would have to agree with the posted idea that artificial grav is a field 
projected between two plates, while anti-grav works by either attracting 
or repelling other gravity fields. The proble with these things though is that
we are VERY far from science, so we have to go by what feels cool and works in 
the game. Then again - I suppose someone could ask Kip Thorne how he would 
do this sort of thing. :)

In answer to Charles Collin:

I\'ve thought about artificial gravity, and come to some conclusions.
Firstly, I\'ve decided that the way in which artificial gravity makes
itself felt is the same as the way in which gravity does; ie. via
gravity, bent space-time, or whatever is flavour of the month.  Thus,
artificial gravity devices generate gravitons (which is the way I find
easiest to talk about it) at the same density as for the natural
gravity you wish to simulate.  This does not mean that you need to
distort space as much as a size 8 planet in order to get 1g.  The
gravity at the surface of Terra is 1g because (i) Terra is the mass it
is (ii) we are 6400 km from the centre.  If you compressed the mas of
Terra down to a ball the size of a spaceship (100m ?), then the
gravity 6400 km from the centre of that ball would still be 1g, but
the gravity on the surface would be about 16.4 thousand million g
because of the inverse square law (I think - certainly much higher
than at 6400 km) Thus, to get 1g on the surface of the 100m sphere,
you need much less than 1 Terran mass, ans the effect at 6400 km would
be 1/16.4 thousand million g.  Thus, the space-time distortion caused
by an artifcial gravity device does not need to be the same as that of
a planet with the same surface gravity.

In my game, I think grav plates work a bit like this: A grav plate
unit is a flat plain (sp?) which fits into the floor.  The controls
allow you to set a surface gravity and a "persistence" range, with
greater gravity and range requiring more power; the device obviously
has tolerences which causes it to break if settings are too high.  The
effect of setting strength and range is to place the origin (centre)
of the necessary pseudo-mass at a given distance from the plate.  I
then say that the plate can only have an effect in one direction, and
the gravitational origin is on the other side.

	     \\	  /
	      	 
	       \\/
		point of origin


Thus, the gravity at x is proportional to the selected pseudo mass,
and inversely proportional to the inverse square of the distance from
the point of origin.  Note, that because the gravity only exists on
one side of the plate, there is no gravity at y, unless there is
another source acting on that point.  

If you have a series of grav plates, the result is a "plain" of
origin.  With the tolerances for power, it is possible to form a
strong grav field at the surface which drops off very quickly (high
pseudo mass, nearby point of origin) or a weak grav field which
extends a long way (low pseudo mass, far point of origin).  To produce
a uniform 1 g field on all decks of a starship, it is necessary to get
all the grav plates working together, so that the residual field from
the deck below is added to that of the deck above.  It is also
possible to extend the grav field beyond the hull of the ship by
simply fiddling with the settings.  Indeed, the grav field of the
"top" deck will always extend beyond the hull, unless you are willing
to have your head at significantly lower gravity than your feet (with
unfortunate physical consequences!), or of course the top deck has
void, fuel, or ungravitied cargo hold above it.  I think these factors
also explain why MT densitometers can identify artificial gravity
sources.

My thought was that any form of close/dispersed, etc. structure would have
trouble supporting itself on land or water due to the structural stresses
involved. Then there are the straight logistics of the ship remaining
upright, etc. to be of any use. Picture almost _ANY_ of the bigger ships
from any Star Wars or Star Trek movie or Babylon 5, etc... and then picture
said ship landing on a flat surface or in the water. Nah! They would all
break up or roll over unless you provided a lot of extra supports or assumed
the entire ship had full contra-grav. Then again, that\'s only sci-fi and
Traveller is reality...

re. Detection and sensors

Glenn M. Goffin asked if his concern about visual appearence was
irrelevant in light of Traveler\'s advanced sensors.  I don\'t think so.
The visual and near-visual range band is the best understood in terms
of instruments to observe, and will probably remain so.  In addition,
on planets with Terran-like atmospheres, the visual range (along with
radio) will still be the most useful, so for flexible sensors you can
use for orbital survys or on-world, you need to consoder optical
sensors, and so you need to consider visual camo.  There is no point
in making your vessel radar absorbant, reducing your powerplant and
heat emission as much as possible, and taking various other steps to
reduce visibility to high-tech sensors if you then paint your vessel
bright orange with green polka dots and add a neon sign saying "we are
here"!  Of course, camo technology keeps up with sensor technology,
and you get chameleon circuits (which can work at visual wavelengths
as easily as IR/heat wavelengths, as far as I can see) and
looking-glass circuits.

Someone pointed out that to scan your sytem contents you only need to
consider two dimensions, ie. the sky area, and not the third
dimension, ie. distance from the observer.  Someone else said that you
*did* need to consider distance, as the further away an object is the
smaller it appears, and the harder it is to resolve.  However, if you
are just trying to *detect* an object, you do not need to resolve it.
You just look at your bit of sky, and wait for the characterisitic of
"jump emergence" or "melting ice" to appear.  The distance element
does come in, because what you are looking for appears dimmer the
further away it is; thus you need to look for longer (integrate) to
see further.  If you pick your required distance coverage, you can
determine how long you need to look for in each direction.  Resolution
is still important, but not fundamental.  The greater your resolution,
the more accurate the position you find, so the smaller the volume of
space which contains the observed object.  However, if this is out in
the Oort cloud, knowing something is there is more important than
knowing exactly where it is.  Also, the higher the resolution, the
smaller your field of view, so that you can only see a smaller bit of
sky at a given time.  This means you either need to move your sensor
more often, or build more sensors.  I guess a compromise between cost,
complexity, and effectiveness would be to have numerous "detection"
sensors of low resolution, and a few "lock-on" sensors to follow-up
the detections.  Resolution is also important in verifying identities,
and providing early warning of movement, etc.


This stuff about resolution brings us back to the use of visual
sensor/camo in combat.  As the resolution of a sensor is the operating
wavelength divided by the sensor aperture/array diamter (l/d), the
resolution which a 1 metre optical telescope can get at visual
wavelengths is as good as that of a 100 km radio telescope! On Terra,
in the atmosphere, optical telescopes are restricted to much worse
than this (the diffraction limit), but the Hubble Space Telescope is
very small compared with the major ground-based telescopes; its
location in orbit makes all the difference.  Thus, optical telescopes
and interferometers on a starship will be very important resolving
devices, which in turn is important for placing your targets
accurately.

There has been some debate re. the inverse square law.  Here is my Cr
0.02 worth.

EM radiation (light, etc.) from a spherical-wave source (which may be
spherically symmetric, eg. a star, or just part of a sphere, eg. a
spotlamp bulb) will diminish in intensity as the square of the
distance from the source, because the photons or wave-front are
diluted across the surface of a sphere, the area of which increases as
the square of the distance. This is why gravity also follows the
inverse square law, because the gravitons (or whatever the current way
of think is) are diluted across a surface. 

Laser light is not as affected by the inverse square law, as they
produce narrow beams of coherent light, effectively flat wave fronts,
so the photons do not dilute.  Actually, this has more to do with the
way we make lasers work, than the laser mechanism itself.  In radio
astronomy, we see astronomical masers (like lasers, but with
microwaves), which emit in all direction, although we can only see
them from one direction (because that is where we are!).  There is a
sort of inverse square law for lasers, due to diffraction.  Any laser
has an aperture, where the light escapes.  For light of wavelength l,
and an aperture diamter d, diffraction causes the beam to spread at an
angle roughly l/d (radians).  This means that the area of the laser
spot increases as rl/d squared, at a distance r.  Thus the energy
density of the beam decreases at the inverse of this, ie d/rl squared,
giving an inverse square law which depends on the diameter of the
laser and the wavelength it operates at.  The laser intensity is
greater at a given range than that of normal radiation for two
reasons: (i) by fiddling with d and l you can attempt to optimise d/l,
and (ii) lasers are able to get a musch greater intensity at source
for the same energy input.  Thus, lasers have a greater range than a
big heat lamp.

Another thing to keep in mind is that most ships cannot accellerate equally
well in all directions - they have to rotate their thrust axis. this takes 
time, and screwes up
their own firing solutions. not to mention gives everyone severe cases of
space-sickness if the ship lacks grav compensators. (recall the PLanet class
heavy cruiser in Rebellion sourcebook. :) thus the worst possible shape
as far as evasive agility is concered is a long cylinder or dart.(preferred 
axis of rotation aligned with thrust axis) the best
is a sphere, or a slab with the thrust axis aligned with the short side.
I would imagine the best compromise between agility, atmospheric performance 
and stealth would be a T or a flying wing a-la B2.
 ----

The fact that ships must slew (ie change direction) in order to evade 
produces restrictions on the size and shape of the "probability bell".
There is however no rules in Traveller which help determine what the 
restrictions will be.
eg. can ships be designed with vectored thrust maneuver drives?

As for mucking up your own firing solutions I assume that the evasive 
maneuvers are computer controlled using a pseudo random sequence. As this 
sequence is pseudo random you know what your ship will do therefore you can 
compensate for your own evasion.
These pseudo random sequences would be a closely guarded secret ( think 
Star-Trek shield frequencies ;).

 ----
Now, based on what has been mentioned re "probability bells of position" it
would seem that the best way to evade is to move on a plane perpendicular
to the axis between the firer and the target, as well as to the velocity
vector of the target. that way you maximize the apparent change of angle...
 ----

Yes, I would think that the pilot\'s skill would be useful here. An other way 
would be for it to be entirely computer controlled, the crew merely 
assigning threat levels to each bogey and giving target priorities.

 ----
eg. if your ship is built like a standard free trader (down is pointng
ventrally, not toward the tail) and you are being fired upon by someone 
straight off the starboard broadside, you should pull "up" or "down". If you 
are shaped like a B2 not only are you able to rotate quickly along that axis 
(pitch),
you also present the smallest aspect... But on the other hand, if you are
shaped like a B2 and the enemy is directly "above", you\'re hosed.
These things are very likely to be taken into account by a good designer, 
with
design reflecting relative importance of agility, stealth, mass,e tc.
Although it is interesting that the sphere not only wins the all-round
agility contest, it is also the most mass-efficient. too bad it\'s so UGLY.
 ----

The other thing is that a sphere cannot reduce it\'s cross-section to a 
target by changing it\'s orientation and always has a relatively large cross 
section for it\'s volume.

 ----
this is also  also exactly the kind of thing that "Predict" is designed to 
consider.In other words, each different target will ahve preferred axis of 
rotation,
preferred arcs of fire (spinal mount), varying aspect area, etc..
I can easily see how you would need a good AI Expert system to deal with
all the parameters in real time - as well as the knack of a good gunner.
 ----

Yes, this also makes it easier to hit a ship you are attacking from several 
directions...

Ah, but that "point" is in fact  the centre of a "fuzzy blob" if the surface 
roughness is apparent at the frequency of the sensor (some energy will be 
reflected from the bumps). If not then the point will glint and be very 
obvious...
The most important factor is retro reflection from surface fixtures at right 
angles to the hull.

I\'ve been thinking about this jump flare thing.  From what has been 
written about Jump operation, I\'d say that the flare on *entry* to jump 
would be stronger than that on *exit*.  The SOM (and maybe elsewhere?) 
says that after the jump capacitors are charged, part of that charge is 
channeled to the hull grid (about 10 %) I think to format it for the 
remaining 90 % of the energy, which actually opens the path into 
jump-space.  I\'m rule that the 10 % formatting energy is retained to 
maintain the protective field seperating jump space from the little bit 
of real space containing the starship.  Thus, more energy is released at 
entry than at exit.  Of course, depending on what you believe jump space 
to be like, the opening through which the ship enters or leaves may allow 
exotic particles to escape, resulting in a characteristic flare.  

In my campaign, I allow sensor readings of a nearby jump entry to 
estimate the intended jump range (as this depends on the gross energy 
expenditure), assuming they know a reasonable amount about the jumping 
vessel (its size - which scales the energy expenditure).  However, 
actually predicting the destination requires (i) high resolution imaging 
of the hull grid at jump and (ii) large amount of computer time.  Even 
then, it would be almost impossible without at least two points of view 
(otherwise, how do you know what is happening to the grid on the other 
side of the vessel?), and a good idea of the operating parameters of the 
jumping vessel.  I think that the hull grid is usually given as having 
about a 1 metre seperation, which is about 1/1000000 radians at 1000 km, 
or about 200 milliarcseconds.  This is the resolution of about a 60 cm 
optical telescope, which is not too unreasonable with sythetic 
apertures.  However, if you say that not all the information from the hull 
grid is emitted optically, you need an integrated EM array, and your
resolution is limited by the longest wavelength you are interested in 
(radio?)  Also, 1000 km is pretty close in space terms, and the amount of 
computing power is going to be more than that required for calculating a 
starship\'s own jump.  Thus, a superior vessel could probably handle the 
calculations for an inferior vessel.  Essentially, you can fiddle with 
the emitting wavelength until you reach a maximum range to allow such 
things to be possible with which you are happy.

I suppose the amount of energy that is used at jump can be estimated from 
the fact that the jump "drive" is a high-throughput, low-efficiency 
fusion powerplant.  90 % of this energy is released on jump entry, an 10% 
on exit.  I\'d be against easy detection of emerging vessels, as it 
flumoxes so many adventure ideas.  In general, I allow my players to 
determine the intended range of a jumping vessel, but little else; this 
way, they think they are getting something out of their sensor readings, 
but essentially it is of no use :-)

For simplicity, I figured out the deviation from endpoint by the manual
method:
*assuming maximum allowed thrust in a single direction, not accounting for
overthrust: Each second the ship adds it\'s accelleration in m/s to it\'s
vector, and covers (roughly) the vector from that second.
*I ignored precalculation vectors, as they are a constant; we only need to
know how far from projected endpoint of precalculation vector it will be to
saturate that area.
* I (i realize) used to low an acceleration per second; the formula from
book 2 is for burn to midpoint, flip and burn to endpoint. Also that
formula has different scales, and my book 2 is stored, as is most of my MT.
*This method is extrapolated from Triplanetary, BL, Mayday, and Book 2
Space Combat. MT (last I looked) doesn\'t use a vector system, or I
misunderstood the system in MT (I never used MT space combat rules).

To manually figure distance covered over time, with constant accelleration,
I will show another example, with 2m/s/s acceleration
Sec:    0 1 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 +1
CV:     0 2 4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18  20  22 +2
TDC:    0 2 6 10 18 28 40 54 70 88 108 130 +CV

Sec: is reference time index, with 0 being ignition of thrust at 2 m/s
CV: is current vector, assuming no change in direction, in m/s
TDC: Total distance covered, in meters

This is the basic method used over several turns in Book 2 combat, just
scaled down to 1 second and 1m references.

Traveller Book 2 combat is in 1000 second turns. 1 G is greater than the 7
m/s I used in my examples in my previous post, but should be around 9
m/s/s.  It\'s the method I was taught in science back in High School
(Aviation Science).

I didn\'t include current vectors in any of my examples last post.

This good? (I know it\'s scientifically sound).

The discussion of color camouflage schemes for ships has been interesting.
One way to use black/black with white spots paint schemes and still have the
visual appeal of the models is to apply a light drybrush of "dinosaur" gray
(gray with a slight bluish tint). This will accent the edges of the
detailing while maintaining the overall effect.

Any ideas on the best cammouflage for dropships? The problem is that they
function in both space (especially if transported externally), in
atmosphere, and on surface.

1) If the projectile has thrusters and a guidance system, then that makes 
it easier to detect.  Also, once you\'ve wrecked those, there\'s a good 
chance the rock will miss its target.  If it happens to be on course  for 
the world when this happens, it\'s still not a problem as the rock is now 
ballistic (i.e., not maneuvering) and its course will be totally 
predictable.  You can thus hit it with all sorts of stuff.
2) If you\'re firing the projectile from several AU away, you better send 
it through a part of space totally devoid of debris.  If the thing hits 
even a tiny pebble floating out there, it will vaporize or at least be 
cracked open.   In fact, this 
provides yet another way of defending against such a ploy:  the simple 
sand caster.  If you can put a cloud of particles in the projectile\'s 
path, it\'s gone.
3) To power the mass driver, you\'re going to need some BIG powerplants 
(esp. if you want to generate a million g!).  These can be detected.  In 
fact, I think this is the major problem with the idea.  It can never be 
built before someone finds it.

way: a ship that can stand the rigors of combat (e.g. shock waves from 
nuclear weapons, high-g maneuvers) should be able to support its own 
weight when landing.  Now before someone tells me about naval battleships 
trying to stay together on land or something, let me remind everyone that 
the original question was about a PC ship (i.e., less than 1000 tons I\'m 
guessing).  It\'s strength-to-mass ratio should be pretty good.

About water landings.  Its true that the ship might flip over, but the 
characters would still be able to get out intact (though maybe very 
wet).  And the original question was (if I recall correctly, which 
certainly isn\'t guaranteed) about a desperation maneuver of sorts.

The other thing is, the ship could hover on its grav thrusters and drop 
people off.  Someone 
said that equipping a ship so it could act like an air-raft would be 
expensive, but I\'m thinking the ship already has all sorts of grav plates 
and inertial compensators in the bulkheads.  How much more could it cost 
to put some on the bottom?  I\'ve always assumed that Traveller ships have 
three means of getting around:  grav for taking off gently and getting 
around in atmosphere, thrusters for space travel, and jump for interstellar.

Weather conditions should not be a problem either.  The ship can send 
small amounts of thrust in various directions to keep it stable.  
Otherwise, how do these ships survive to skim from gas giants?  There are 
some pretty powerful winds in there!

So, IMNSHO, there is no problem with unstreamlined ships landing, it just 
takes a lot longer and is against convention/safety rules (the Imperial 
version of the FAA would get all over you).

Well charles, if you think of the flow as a flow from cathode to anode,
when one of the plates is removed, so is the flow. Real simple. Remove
plate=no AG.

Charles: I am looking right at page 14 of _Starship Operator\'s Manual_:
Here is the cannonical quote:

Yes, I would imagine that you can vector your thrust by at least a 
few degrees without too much difficulty - and high-agility designs
would be capable of even more. Just like today, where certain fighters
can vector their thrust. This actually changes soem of the considerations 
I mentioned before - since you can vector your thrust, the long dart
or wedge is at less of a disadvantage. since it has a longer "lever" that 
will somewhat offset the higher moment of inertia. 

Yes, you would know how you are going to turn, so that isn\'t a problem.
However, if you rotate ro violently that the weapon you were going to
use will no longer bear...

The latter case is more probable due to the many factors that must be 
considered. However,  a human is useful for adding a little bit of 
random input into the evade sequence...

True. again, it depends on what you want. If you\'re so big you\'ll be found
no matter what - build a sphere. likewise if you don\'t care abou anything 
other than mass and cost.

I agree completely on every point. However, don\'t forget that densitometers
can probably help quite a bit in determining events. After all they do 
pick up disturbances in the space-time "fabric", i.e. gravity waves.
I would assume jump entry and exit would produce such waves.
who knows, when LIGO comes online and they start picking up strange signatures..:)

I think you are making a round-off error. the velocity doesn\'t increase 
in steps of 2 m/s, it increases continuously over time. 
eg at t=3 sec x= 0.5 * 2 * 3^2 = 9 meters.
why not just use that good ole\' formula from high-school physics:

x= (1/2)*Acceleration*(Time^2) + InitialVelocity*Time +Initial position.  ?
 
and yes, you can assume no initial vector for the sake of argument, 
although keep in mind that it will affect the apparent shape of 
the "probable position bell".

although the manual method is accurate enough for a game - it\'s just 
more grunge-work.

I think it might be an interesting twist to work as a fraction of the max 
JDrive output. (i.e. \'The enemy ship is jumping at half power sir\'... you 
dont know if that is J1 from a J2 drive, or J3 from a J6 drive, unless 
you know the type of ship.)

>However, actually predicting the destination requires (i) high 
resolution imaging of the hull grid at jump and (ii) large amount of 
computer time.  Even then, it would be almost impossible without at least 
two points of view (otherwise, how do you know what is happening to the 
grid on the other 
side of the vessel?), and a good idea of the operating parameters of the 
jumping vessel.
----
And this assumes you know the jump grid pattern. You\'d be stuffed if you 
were trying to reverse-engineer the hull-grid energising pattern from an 
Aslan ship without an Aslan navigation computer to work back from. 
Preferably for that style of hull-grid, too.

The first mention of Jump \'Flare\' is in the SOM. I think that it is 
intended to be entirely \'chrome\'. Also there is nothing to indicate that 
the emissions carry for any distance. They may break down quickly, only 
for a short distance appearing as EMS in the visible light region.

It may be possible to write software that would handle the 
reverse-engineering process. I suspect it would be a major project. Given 
that the SOM declared that the grid had to be charged in the correct 
sequence to the *millisecond* I doubt that anything other than a cpu feed 
from the departing ship would be adequate.

I wonder if one could assume that other heavy earth alloys produce 
different colors/spectra or lower magnitude bursts?

not quite...   ;^)

You see, the probability bubble is moving with the craft, the current 
vector is irrelevant. If you use the frame of reference of the target 
craft, then the probability bubble is **how much it can _change_ its 
vector in the next x seconds**. Not what the new vector is. What the 
current vector is, is usually irrelevant (unless they are going out of 
range, or they are so close your turrets cannot traverse fast enough to 
keep up.)

Also if you are maintaining a similar vector (usually the case when 
prosecuting an attack) then the vectors you each have almost cancel each 
other out anyway in terms of opening or closing the range.

In essence, how far you travel in a turn is irrelevant; how much you 
*change* your vector/speed is all that matters.

BTW I was more thinking of *missiles* having to fill that volume. A 1200m 
radius sphere is 7,238,229,473.871 m3. That\'s 7.3 cubic Kilometers!

Also, you cannot use \'common sense\' to narrow the area involved in the 
probability bubble, as some people *will* use unorthodox manoeuvres to 
evade. eg. During the 5FW as the Imperial player, at the height of the 
Zhodani assault, I invaded Zhodani territory, and started capturing 
planets. While this did not deter his main thrust (these were not my main 
defense) it did cause two of his follow-up and outflank fleets to be 
diverted. The Zhodani player diverted approximately 12-14 counters, while 
the Imperial invasion force was 4 ship counters (cruiser largest), in 
three fleets with some ground forces for garrison duty.

This unorthodox tactic made much better use of these four counters than 
if I had spent them in battle.

Regarding Nanites, I would guess that they would appear at roughly TL9. 
These would be basic robotic non-sentient machines which would require 
programming and control from a proximate computer via radio waves, or 
perhaps HF low amperage electrical stimulus. Or perhaps chemical triggers 
to set off certain pre-programmed functions. At TL9 this would be 
experimental and extremely expensive. It would probably be TL10 or 11 
before they become more widespread (perhaps to leading edge health care 
facilities). They would still be prohibitively expensive. I think it 
would be a few tech levels later for broader production. Perhaps TL16/17 
for mass production?

I would say it would be TL20 -25 before you saw a Von-Neumann Nanite.

All views expressed about nanites are of course arbitrary decisions made 
with respect to game balance from my perception. Any other views would be

Reading Xboat 428, I thought of an add-on to my idea of grav plates:  The 
gravitons from a given plate are "in phase" (whatever that may mean), so 
that when they encounter an appropriately tuned grav-plate, they are 
incorporated into that plate\'s field.  Thus, the field can be prevented 
from passing beyond the hull by using a set of "in-phase" plates with 
power settings to exactly offset the effects of incoming gravitons.  This 
is a bit dodgy, \'cos I\'ve just thought it up!

from a great distance, but if we are to take the SOM as gospel, it says 
the jump flare is "almost painful to look at".  That means (according to 
visual psychophysics), you\'ve got a light somewhere in the range of 10^9 
candellas per m^3, or roughly the brightness of the surface of the noon 
sun!  I think this signal would carry for a fairly good distance.  If we 
assume that the signal is "normal light" (i.e., non-lased and devoid of 
exotic energies), then the signal should roughly degrade with the square of 
the distance.  Now, assuming that EMS sensors can normally pick up faint 
reflections from mat black ships in empty space at distances of several 
light seconds, they should be able to pick up the above emergence flare 
at HUGE distances with no problem.

Incidentally, this also argues for the jump flare indicating the 
rough size of the 
ship coming in (larger profile = more emited light).  I don\'t think the SOM 
says anything about the flare varying with jump number.  

BTW, several people seem to consider the SOM a "non-canonical" source.  
Why is this?  I don\'t know what the criteria for "canonical" are, does it 
have to come from GDW or what?

Observing Base in Oort Cloud:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Okay! Okay!  I\'m willing to believe it could be done.  But there\'s still 
the problem of getting the ship there without its jump flare being 
detected (see my previous post in this issue).  Also, if the ship is 
running on fusion, it\'s still going to have that nasty neutrino 
signature.  Granted, you probably won\'t be picked up right away from 
this, but you\'d better be ready to split real fast in case you are.  

The fact that we don\'t know anything about our Oort cloud in the 20th
century has little to do with it.  Before WWII, we had little knowledge of
what lay in deep coastal waters, but now we watch them quite carefully,
because we know an enemy could put a sub out there and listen in.  

Also, you have to remember that the Spinward Marches is a sector that has 
been through no less than FIVE wars by 1111, and much more conflict as 
you go further forward in its history.  I submit that there would be 
loads of anti-espionage equipment and procedures all over the place.


Common sense in Gunnery:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I was not trying to imply that common sense would mathematically narrow 
down the area in which a ship could be, but a gunner who had a limited 
number of shots to put out there would be more likely to assume (for 
example) that a fleeing ship would be in certain areas of the probability 
bubble and concentrate his fire there.  People do use unorthodox 
tactics, but not very often (or they wouldn\'t be unorthodox would they?  ;)


Nanites and Von Neuman Machines:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Thanks for the info and comments!


Jump Emergence Flares:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I think I over-estimated the brightness of jump flares.  The 10^9 figure 
is the level at which damage occurs to vision.  In order for the flare to 
be painfully bright, it could be as low as 10^7 cd/m^2.

First I wanted to thank everyone for the "unstreamlined ship landings"
discussion.  It was very helpful and I\'ve got a good idea of how to
handle things now.

Second, I wanted to throw in my non-canonical (all I own is three little
black books and some supplements, no MT or TNE, although I\'m trying to
rectify this) opinion on jump flares--no rotting fruit or vegatables 
please.

I have always thought of a ship in jump space as being in "a high energy
state" (as opposed to when its in real space being more of a ground
state--sorry for the Quantum analogies; the physics dept. makes me think
this way, I can\'t help it.)  Therefore, much of the energy produced to 
enter jump is bound into the ship in order to place it in this high 
energy space.  However, I have always played, that when the ship emerges,
it must shed this extra energy to return to its "ground state" which
will retun it to real space.  Consequently, in my games there is a minor
flare upon entry (due to J-drive inefficiency to couple its output energy
with the ship) but its magnitude is nothing in comparison to the flare
when the ship emerges; as it must now dump the energy of tens to thousands
of tons of fused H.

This has worked very well in my games.  It is true (as was mentioned) that
this can limit adventure posibilities (as the PC\'s ship doesn\'t quietly
glide into a system) but on the other hand, my players have often been 
glad for the bit of warning that someone might be after them....So it cuts
both ways.  Anyway with all that space out there from which to emerge, and 
the inability for a sensors to look for everything, in all directions, at
all times, in my opinion makes detection rather remote.  (This is of coarse
assuming that one comes out of jump in a random location in the system, I 
know that there has been a great deal of discussion on this too--but I still
hold it to be true)

As I said this is non-canonical (all this "hull jump grid" stuff is new to
me and I\'m still trying to figure it out), but I just thought that it might
be useful to throw in another opinion that has been proven workable (well...
by me anyway) gamewise.

I have another question that I would like to hear some discussion on
(or a reference it there are already rules on this sort of thing)

Would it be possible to have a jump missle?  Imagine the following 
situation.  A border patrol ship is on a patrol (or is inside the
oppositions border) when it is attacked.  The ship is alone and is losing 
the battle (several of the enemy ships appeared and want to use the 
system as a staging area).  The captain of the doomed ship wants to let
his goverenment know that its border is no longer secure and so...
HAZZAH... uses a jump missle.  The jump missle is dropped (or launched--
possible pneumaticly) by the ship (from a suitable bay to house such a 
device) at which time it enters jump (having been preprogramed by the
ships computer and in radio link with it until jump is entered).  Once
the missle reached its destination, it would emerge and begin transmitting
whatever message it had been programmed with.  (Assuming it would be sent
to a friendly system) the knowledge that borders had been breached would
be known much earlier than would be otherwise.  (Basically, it would act 
like an xboat with no pilot, life support, passageways, etc...   Could
such a device be made small enough to be placed in a small enough bay to
make it worthwhile)

This is by no means certain.  The kind of forces and stresses that
a ship is going to have to withstand from a fluid shockwave  are
different than those from supporting it\'s weight on a hard surface.
It is quite possible to have a structure that can withstand
one and not the other.

Simple strength/mass may have very little to do with the situation.
You can have a structure that is designed to withstand certain
types of forces and is very poor at withstanding other forces
(and remember, we are talking about ships that were designed
with the belief that they wouldn\'t have to withstand forces
from landing.)

I understood "jump flash" to be a magnetic/gravitic engery pulse 
effect based on the rent caused by a ship entering normal space 
from jumpspace.

If "jump flash" means an instant\'s worth of blue glow, let me suggest
that that would have no effect in BL (or any other Traveller space 
combat system) simply because the effect is lost in the time 
length of a turn.  An entry flash does not provide enough data to do
anything with.  Signal strength at any appreciable distance (ie more 
than a megameter) is probably about zip - and the signal type is just 
light.

        Not necessarily ... it may help narrow down the destination. Making
a jump-2 when there\'s only one planet within j-2 tells me where you\'re
_probably_ going (barring deep-space bases or multiple jumps)

These would then be sent out again, continuing the process exponentially.

        Not under Classic or Mega Traveller, as the smallest jump capable
hull was 100T; however, TNE lets you design any size jump drive and ship.

My thought was that any form of close/dispersed, etc. structure would have
trouble supporting itself on land or water due to the structural stresses
involved. Then there are the straight logistics of the ship remaining
upright, etc. to be of any use. Picture almost _ANY_ of the bigger ships
from any Star Wars or Star Trek movie or Babylon 5, etc... and then picture
said ship landing on a flat surface or in the water. Nah! They would all
break up or roll over unless you provided a lot of extra supports or assumed
the entire ship had full contra-grav. Then again, that\'s only sci-fi and
Traveller is reality...

Not under MT or CT, unless it displaces 100+ tons. TNE would require that
it be at least 2.X m^3, as that is the minimum size of J-drive (if memory
serves).

The Imperium prefers to annex worlds willingly, but will not hesitate to 
annex worlds by force if it serves it\'s interests.  See the Pacification 
Wars.

Oftentimes, worlds are first settled by Imperials, who form their own 
governments.  Then, they become client states of the Imperium.  Finally, 
they are annexed.  It seems that most of the Spinward Marches was annexed 
by this method: Regina was annexed in this manner, and Subsector N 
(District 285? in 1202, called Plankwell subsector) is currently being 
annexed in this manner.  It takes time, but is largely nonviolent.

Imperial worlds have a number of requirements: 
         - pay taxes. Taxes are assesed by world: the world pays the tax 
           via whatever means it wishes, from income taxes, sales taxes, 
           loans, etc.
         - support the military, esp. the Imperial Navy.
         - each world and it\'s major continents, divisions, and cities 
           has a noble hierarchy, either selected from the locals or 
           parachuted in by the Emperor.
         - Imperial law -- a minimum law code, forbidding murder, treason, 
           etc. -- is enforced.

It has been said that the Imperium is a trade confederation: most nations 
join the Imperium for the trade benefits, esp. before the Pacification 
Wars. The Imperial borders have been largely stable since then, with the 
only areas of expansion being in the Domain of Deneb (economic/population 
reasons) and the Solomani (military security, and cultural reasons).

Never, to my knowledge. (Excepting \'Offworld Rule\', which would mean 
military rule).  The Imperium is a feudal nobility, but doesn\'t go out of 
it\'s way to encourage this form of government.

Sometimes.  Terra was placed under military rule after the Rim War.

The Regency is doing this with the Sword Worlders: it has not proven to 
be a success, as mutual loathing has risen between settlers and locals.

Although a Jump missile is not allowed under CT/MT rules, such a thing was
included in a CT adventure (Adv 4:Leviathan), where a one-shot
jump-capable message torpedo was provided.  I tried to fit this in with
the canonical rules, eg. saying that actually the 100+ displacement rule
wasn\'t completely correct; there was a sort of "bubble" of usuable volumes
at the very small scales, where you could fit a jump drive and send the
resulting device through jump. Unfortunately (so my rationalisation went),
the result was that the torpedo barely survived the travel through jump,
and was only able to transmit a burst of information before going
completely to pieces once it emerged from jump.  Couple this to a
posulated high expense, and obvious low security, and possibly low
reliability (high propability of never leaving jump space in one piece,
etc.) , explains why the Imperium uses the expensive Xboat/Scout/Courier
network (not very satisfactorily, though).  I really would have liked to
keep jump torpedoes in CT, but I think it really plays havoc with some of
the basic assumptions.  I think I decided to leave out this idea in 
Leviathan, which is a pity, because it is a nice idea.

The guidance system adds *nothing* to the detectability. Purely
passive, optical observations of stars and planets.

The thrusters are intended for *small* course corrections. Over a 40
day flight tme, it doesn\'t take much to nudge the final vector the
required amount. Probable thruster type is small ion thrusters, such as
are currently used for stationkeeping on geosynchronous satellites and
some probes. They have a *very* high Isp, and can produce milli-gee
thrusts for *months*. They are also almost impossible to detect.

The idea is that whevere the guidance package sees a course deviation
big enough to correct, it can fir the thrusters, which will make a
course change on the order of less than 1 second of arc.

See above, if you wreck the thrusters, it\'s unlikely to make the
projectile (*not* rock!) miss, because it\'ll have been on course within
less than 1 sec of arc!

The thrusters aren\'t *intended* for dodging. Just for course
correction. So the course will *always* be predictable. The problem is
*finding* the projectile in time.

It looks fairly clear that *physical* attacks are out of the question.
Lasers and PAWS aren\'t real likely to do significant damage in time.
Meson weapons *might*. One the other hand, what amount of damage does
it take to break up a 1 ton piece of *solid* metal, and what sort of
accuracy does it take to hit a less than 1 meter target at light second
ranges?

Plus, given that many here agree with me that *detection* is very
difficult, odds are that a detect at even *one* light second is
unlikely. How many shots can you get off in 66 seconds?

Finally, since it *won\'t* be making course corections in the last hour
or so, we could always mount a black globe on it and turn it on when
the projectile is an hour out. That makes both detection and
destruction essentially impossible. :-)

(of course, that\'s *real* expensive, and probably masses too much)

The projectile from the million gee version has 20.25e18 joules of
energy. That\'s 20.25e12 Mj. Assume 90% losses. That makes the
input 202.5e12 Mj. 

100 AU is 150 billion km. The surface of a 100 AU sphere is roughly
282e27 m^2. That give 716e-18 Mj per sq. meter. or 716e-12 j/m^2. And
that\'s assuming that *all* the losses radiate omnidirectionally, and
that none of them go into any sort of "heat sink". 

I don\'t have a the value of Planck\'s constant handy, so I can\'t
estimate how many photons per square meter that\'ll be. Plus we need to
figure out what *frequency* the losses would be at.

If somebody has a table of atomic weights handy, they can figure out
how many hydrogen-1 atoms need to be fused to helium-4 atoms to
generate that much power. Multiply by two to get the total number of
neutrinos emitted. Then divide by the area above to get neutrinos per
square meter. The result will show how ineffective nuetrino sensors
will be. 

And while doubling the distance will double the transit time for the
projectile, it\'ll drop emissions to one *quarter*. 

And all this is assuming that I\'m generating enough power to fire
essentially "continously". If I generate the power at a lower level,
and store it in a capacitor bank or the like until I need it then my
rate of fire goes down, but so do the emission levels. 

At one shot per day, I\'ve just dropped the power requirements by
86,400. 

BTW, an earlier message referred to the eyes ability to "subtract things"
(like the overlying blood vessels) as an explanation of why sensors
wouldn\'t be bothered by "background noise". Sorry, it doesn\'t work that
way. You *can\'t* see a candle at 100 feet, if I\'m at 10 feet shining a
spotlight in your face. Heck, you won\'t be able to see a *road flare*
aat 100 feet in those circumstances! So unless there are no *stronger*
sources in your field of view, you won\'t be able to see a weak source.

ps to William Hostman.

Yeah, so instead, I form the anode into a ring, and use multiple

create an electron beam. :-)

Tractor/pressor beams anyone?

Yup.  If you think the CT adventure Leviathan is canon, then just use
the 2 ton jump missile used for just that purpose.  It always kind stuck

In the CT adventure "Leviathan", a device called a Jump Torpedo was
described. It was essentially the same as Eddie the Shipboard Computer\'s
jump misssiles and was used for the same purposes he speculated about. I

CT/MT) they would have to be 100+ tons.  But that depends on the nature 
of the 100 ton limit.  I\'m sure someone will pound me with a bunch of 
canonical references about this, but AFAIK there are three possible 
reasons for the 100 ton limit:

1. The jumping object must be 1400 m^3 in volume but can be any mass.  If
this is the case, then one could have the jump missile as an unfolding or
inflating sort of thing with a tiny jump drive, powerplant and fuel tank to
carry the reduced mass into jump space.  Of course this doesn\'t work if 
you assume the size of the j-drive is dependent on the volume of the 
jumping object, so you have to make some pretty "convenient" assumptions.

2. The jumping object must be 100 tons in weight but can be any volume.  
In this case, it is easy to pack the missile full of lead (I know, it\'s a 
silly image, but bear with me) and it could be reasonably small.  Again, 
you have to make some pretty convenient assumptions about the basis for 
jump drive size etc.  There is also another question:  does the ship 
carrying this super-dense missile 
have to set aside 100 tons of space for it?  The lack of a volume/mass 
distinction in CT makes this hard to resolve.

3. The jumping object must satisfy both of the above conditions.  In that 
case, there is no hope for reasonably small jump missiles.

There is also a fourth (decidedly non-canonical) interpretation:  the 100 
tons limit is due to human limitations, not physical ones.  I\'ve pictured 
this as a problem of the bizarre physics of jump space intruding on the 
ship.  People on small ships get disorientation and nausea entering jump 
space due to these effects.  The bigger the ship, the more of a 
"stabilizing" effect it has on the jump space around it.  Below 100 tons, 
the effects become dangerous, causing epilepsy-like spasms and sometimes 
death.  In this case jump missiles are no problem, and people willing to 
risk injury and death can take smaller ships into jump space if they wish.
You could have groups of super-elite pilots who happen to be 
jump-resistant taking jump-fighters through and so on.  This sort of 
thing would have profound effects on the game universe, I think, as would 
jump missiles.

Also, if you do a soft water landing, you can use bouyancy to lower your

Charles Collin provided some useful information about the intensity of a 
painful-to-look at flash, and also said that the flare would indicate the 
rough size of the emerging vessel.  I\'m not sure about this second point; 
isn\'t the "blinding" flash just the initial bright point of light before 
the thing fills out to allow the vessel through.  In that case, the 
bright flash may not depend to any great degree on the size of the 
emerging vessel, it is just a metre-square (for example) so always 
represents the same initial energy burst.  Also note that the SOM 
description is from the point of view of someone watching the vessel, so 
will not include information about effects at other wavelengths or on 
other physical effects (gravity, neutrinos, etc.)  As jump appears to be 
linked in some manner to gravity (the 100 diameter rule), then perhaps 
there will be some noticable gravitational effect, as I think someone has 
already said.

I don\'t know how much the Imperium is still expanding by
the Classic Traveller era, ca. 1100.  I think that most of
the expansion took place during the Pacification Campaigns
after the Long Night, when joining the Imperium and getting
the protection of its navy and the benefits of its support
for interstellar trade made it a very attractive option for
individual worlds subject to raiding and reliant on their
own, often scarce and depleted, resources.  (A sentence
that long should perhaps be written in German or Zdetl.) 
The Pacification Campaigns lasted from about 76 to 120.

By the early 1100s, District 268/Spinward Marches is on
its way to becoming Collace Subsector, and part of the
Imperium, and I suppose that some absorption of border
areas was going on, but not on anything like the scale of
the first 120 years.  The absorbable border states, except
for the coreward border, are all small states lying
between the Imperium and the other comparably large
states.  Maybe the Imperium and the Hivers, Zhodani, etc.
prefer to keep some buffers in place.  Along the coreward
border are the Vargr Extents -- does the Imperium want to
absorb any of them?

Transformation probably wasn\'t too big a deal 1000 years
ago during the great expansion of the Imperium -- after
all, these worlds had all been members of the Rule of Man
and, before that, of the Ziru Sirka.  Most of them were
happy to join Cleon\'s Imperium and get out the Long Night
and back to prosperity, trade, and peace. 

Transformation today (ca. 1110, say) still isn\'t too big a
deal.  What makes a world an Imperial world is a commitment
to the Imperium, which takes the form of paying taxes or 
tribute, submission to the draft, and allowing starports and 
Imperial bases.  There is no Imperial culture per se that a 
new member has to adopt, nor any Imperial code of laws (at 
least none that affect local governance), so joining the 
Imperium may not require major changes to a world.  

That\'s not to say that it may not cause major changes, or
that joining the Imperium would not be a big deal, as
military spending drops or increases because of joining the
Imperial defense network, trade increases as Imperial
tariffs no longer apply (that comment should generate some
discussion), and veterans return from Imperial service
with new ideas based on what they\'ve seen.

It might do this if the former government were hostile and 
the world was threat to Imperial security -- Arden/Vilis

No -- I would think that a good frontier duke would be able 
to get an enemy of that world to that for the Imperium, 
saving cost and bad press.

This probably happpened a lot more during the Pacification 
Campaigns than later.

Some of each.

I doubt that it would be possible to scan enough of the sky at sufficient 
resolution to make the scan feasible.  It is highly doubtful that much of 
the Oort cloud will be mapped, except perhaps the shorter period comets 
(<1000 years). Don\'t forget most places have not had *continous* 
civilization for much beyond 2000-4000 years, and many places in the 
Spinward Marches, would be significantly less than 1000 years.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It don\'t matter. By T15 it\'s a piece \'o cake!
=============================================

How much do we know of our own Oort Cloud? Can anyone spell 
Shumacker-Levy? (I\'m not sure if I got it right but you know what I 
mean)  Does anyone remenber the warning received. And the original 
impression was that it would intercept the Earths orbit, fairly close to 
where we would be. (Lucky Jupiter got in the road).

I agree that a T8 isolated system like ours would be vulnerable but
by T15? I don\'t think so. Besides, how do you hide your power plant

You can always design a very simple ship with a 100 ton
hull, a jump drive, necessary fuel and computers and lots of
empty space. This should be faily inexpensive compared
to other starships, but will probably run in the MCr range
anyway (I don\'t have the rules with me right now). This is
because the size of the jump drive is a function of only two
variables: The maximum distance it can jump and the
volume of the ship. Then, no matter what you do (inflatable
hulls, etc.), you\'ll still need a full jump drive. No "tiny" jump
drives are possible.

Furthermore: Inflatable hulls would probably inflate a little
different each time, making the grid initializing erronous. It
might be quite unstable too. This results in a high risk of
misjumps (at best).

This is not to shoot down all the interesting hypotheses,
which has been made, but simply to come up with an
explanation consistent with canon why jump missiles are
impossible. It is my firm belief that the existence of jump
missiles would severely damage the background of
traveller as we know it.

answers to the questions about jump-drives.  The TNE offical line
seems to be closer to the Miller JTAS article than DGP\'s Starship
Operator\'s Manual.   

All quotes are Marc Miller, "Jumpspace", JTAS 24.

ON LANTHANUM COILS AND HULL WIRES:

"Starship hulls contain as an integral part of their structure a 
 network of wiring which maintains the jump field around the ship.  
 Without this field, the natural physics of jump space would invade 
 the ship\'s interior. [...] Breaks in the protective network within 
 a starship hull are a primary cause of the loss of ships in jump."
 
"The jump coils that channel the jump energy within the drive are 
 constructed of lanthanum, a rare earth which has exactly the right 
 properties for the purpose. [...] Other materials have been used or 
 substituted, but none function with enough reliability or efficiency
 to make them practical."
 
Depicted as two separate systems, but both exist.  He doesn\'t say how
far the field extends *above* the wires, if any distance at all.  We
do know that some ships can carry small craft on the outside of the
hull, though (the Fat Trader and Azhanti come to mind).  I suspect the
"one meter" figure comes from a certain Travelleresque Star Wars novel
by Brian Daley, but I don\'t know for sure. 

ON TIME SPENT IN JUMPSPACE:

"...jump drive is accurate to less than one part in ten billion.
 [...] the arrival point of a ship can be predicted to within 
 perhaps 3000 kilometers."

"The duration of a jump is fixed at the instant jump begins, and 
 depends on the jump space entered, the energy input into the system, 
 and other factors."

"The exact time of emergence is usually predicted by the ship\'s 
 computer and the bridge is well-manned for the event."
 
To me, this suggests that the time a jump will take is an integral
part of the jump solution; the crew should be able to figure out
how long the jump will take to their chosen emergence point, given
their entrance point and vector.  This will also allow accurate
placement of the exit point so that the ship\'s outbound vector can
be used as an inbound vector on arrival, as Miller mentions is 
possible for military ships and high-speed couriers.

Incidentally, Book 2 implies that jumps can be pre-computed if you
know what your vector and jump-point will be -- pre-recorded, one-
use tapes are available for ships on the xboat routes that lack the 
jump-course Generate program.

COURSE PREDICTION BY OBSERVERS:

"...a ship\'s jump destination cannot be predicted."

But he also says that the entry vector and energy expenditure are
crucial to making a correct jump.  This is probably the Regency
Sourcebook\'s justification for mentioning that ships may be able
to guess destination if they have a hard target lock on the ship
entering jump.

EXIT/ENTRANCE "FLASH":

Miller mentions nothing, except that a lot of power is generated
at jump.  Regency Sourcebook mentions some gravitic disturbances
that are generated beginning several minutes before exit, but it
also says that they\'re short range and that the sensor operator
will need to be watching the right place to see them coming.  It
doesn\'t mention a visual light flash.  Most of the adventures I\'ve
seen seem to imply that you can tell the difference between an
unseen ship going active and a ship stepping out of jump.

BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS:

"The biological effects of jump on travellers is negligible."

However, he does mention the nausea in some that gets worse if the
ship misjumps, and at least one alien race had been established in
a previous JTAS article that was thought to be jump-intolerant.

This episode is not part of the CT/MT universe (which is why I\'m
cross-posting to the TML).

However, it does leave room for some interesting socio-ethical conflicts in
what looked like a simple mercenary ticket.  Imagine this:

The players are hired for a cadre ticket: training the \'settlers\' in
self-defense and small-unit tactics.  Equipment is high quality, their
students are motivated, the pay is good, and the mainstream media calls them
\'heroes\'.  This seems like a dream ticket, until they begin noticing that:

1) The wants of a few hundred settlers take precidence over the needs of a
few hundred thousand locals, which seems strangely non-democratic.

2) The settlers seem to have nothing but contempt for the locals and treat
them poorly, provoking responses that are then brutally suppressed.  Settler
provokation goes unpunished, indeed unrestrained.

Let the players see a few starving children, possibly meet a young girl
willing to do literally anything to feed her younger siblings (both parents
killed in riot, which the players know was provoked by extremist settlers). 
Then have the players called out in defense of a unit of settlers that has
been surrounded while demolishing native homes and fields.  Do they honour
their contract, or prevent the settler militia from machine-gunning children?
 Can they do both at the same time?

(This final action could even make an interesting Striker II game, with the
veteran mercenaries switching sides if they witness too many settler
atrocities.  Hm, the settler player must keep the mercenaries away from the
bloodiest fighting, so they don\'t switch sides, while tha native player must
try to have some units wiped out in front of the mercenaries so they will
switch sides.)

So then your projectile is (for the purposes of hitting it) effectively 
ballistic the whole way?  That means anyone picking it up will be able to 
hit it every time at any distance.   Detecting a 1m rock at several 
LS is not difficult at all.  We can do it with the sensors we have today.
With 
TL15 sensors using interferometry to create sensor arrays with 
orbit-sized baselines, the resolution will be incredible!  You don\'t even 
need a planet, you can just use a group of ships\' sensors to create an 
array of extremely high power.

The accuracy required to hit a 1 meter rock at LS ranges is not a 
problem.  Any non-maneuvering target that can be detected can be hit at 
those tech levels.  Even today, we can aim a probe at Pluto at a distance 
of many AU.  Why?  Because it doesn\'t change course. Since you claim your 
projectile doesn\'t either, it is what is known as a target with a trivial 
solution.  I think you are under-estimating the power of technology here.  
TL-15 isn\'t just 20th century tech with jump-drives shoved in it, computer 
and sensor tech will have improved (very conservatively) a 
thousand-fold!  I think you are also forgetting that you are no longer 
dealing with ship sensors and computers here, but the resources of an 
entire planet (presumably and advanced one if you are going to go 
through all the trouble to build a mass driver to attack it).

Your assertion that lasers and PAWs won\'t do sufficient damage is at odds 
with the fact that they can demolish starships with hulls much thicker 
than that.  And again, we won\'t be talking about piddly little ship 
weapons here, but an entire defensive network of massive weapons designed 
to repel fleets of invading warships.  You honestly believe their 
combined might isn\'t going to be able to vaporize a 1m projectile?

Your assertion that putting a black globe on the thing will make it 
harder to detect and hit is again wrong.  An object with its black globe 
on is *easier* to hit because of the hole it leaves in the background.  
Also, the smallest black globe generators are about 15 tons, making your 
projectile much larger, easier to detect, harder to accelerate and so 
on.  Furthermore, the black-globe will make it easier to destroy!  All 
you have to do know is overload the capacitors carried with the thing 
(again the capacitors increase size), and the whole thing vaporizes.  
Hitting the black globe is not difficult because of the "hole in space" 
problem, and since the projectile is effectively ballistic, you can hit 
it every time and easily overload the capacitors.

BTW, my point about eyes being able to subtract out backgrounds stands.  
Just because the visual systems range of subtractive function is limited 
to 14 log units doesn\'t mean that the sensors you build must be that 
way.  You can in fact see a candle flame at a 100 feet by the way.  In 
fact, under ideal conditions, you can see a candle flame up to 1 km 
away!  But that doesn\'t matter, my point is that if a messy biological 
system like the eye can adjust to light levels ranging from 10^-6 cd/m^2 
to 10^10 cd/m^2 and still see detail, then TL 15 sensors should be able 
to do much better.  

Incidentally, you still haven\'t dealt with the logistical problems 
mentioned by several people in earlier issues.

I like the idea for tractor/pressor beams! :-)

The Traveller and Xboat mailing lists run on some remotley admined machines.
Apparently we ran out of disk space sometime over the weekend.  I came in
yesterday and tried to upload a file to the ftp site and got an out of disk

Nope. Only if they are close enough. Remember, PAWS, Lasers, and meson
guns all have range limits. And projectile weapons have to be close
enough to reach an intercept position before the projectile passes it.

No we can\'t. Especially if the *projectile* (not rock!) is stealthed.
Please state your source for thinking that we can.

Unfortunately, the *resolution* isn\'t the issue. It\'s the signal
strength. The wide baseline gives you higher resolution, but your
minimum observable signal is limited by the size of the *indivual*
sensors, not be the aggregate size. If you can pick up a signal, then
you can get great detail. But you have to pick up the signal first, and
that is *solely* a function of the collecting area at the given sensor.

 > The accuracy required to hit a 1 meter rock at LS ranges is not a 
 > problem. 

I beg to differ. Your pointing accuracy (for beam weapons, which are the
only things that have a *chance* of hitting) is physically impossible.
To hit at *one* LS, you have to be within .5 meters of your aiming
point. So we have a right triangle 3e8 meters on one side and .5 meters
on the other. That\'s a tangent of 1/6e8, or an arc of 9.5e-8 degrees.
or 344 *millionths* of a second of arc. 

To put it another way, if you have to be within .5 meters at 3e8
meters, then at 1 km you have to be within 1.67e-6 meters. Or in other
words, if your "pointing circles" are 1 km in radius (yeah, right!),
you have to be able to position on them to less than 2 microns! I\'ve
*worked* with micron tolerances. You won\'t get them on something that
big without making it too expensive to use, no matter *what the tech
level is. Besides, a temp change of a hundreth of a degree will cause
the setting circle to change size by *meters*. And vibrations will be
far larger than a the 2 micron tolerance.

Now, scale this down to the more likely size of circles a mere 10
meters across, and you get even less likely results (positioning to
better than the size of an atomic nucleus).

With the best pointing you can get, and with *no* change in settings,
your shots will be scattered over *hundreds* of meters. If you hit, it
will be by pure chance. So it\'ll take you hundreds of shots, but you
have to correct your aim after *every* shot because of the speed of
approach. And the time factor says you don\'t have *time* to fire
hundreds of times.

No it can\'t. As noted above, you reach a point were your CEP (circular
error probable) is so much bigger than the target, that hits are
essentially impossible.

Pluto is *much* bigger. And we have a much better trajectory solution
for it. And those probes require *numerous* course corrections along
the way!

And I *know* that you are over-estimating the extent to which the laws
of physics limit your ability to shoot back.

Sensor tech *cannot* improve that far. There\'s not a thousand-fold
increase in sensitivity *left* to make. Once you can detect down to the
level of the background noise, you *can\'t* get any improvement in
detection by increasing the sensitivity. We already have sensors that
can register individual photons at most wavelengths. You *can\'t* do
better than that. 

The problem is seperating the signal from the backround noise. And
other than reducing the noise generated *in* the sensor, you can\'t do
anything about noise. It is not *possible* to detect any signal weaker
than background noise. Period. If you think otherwise, you do not
understand the subject. 

Improvements in computer tech aren\'t relevant here.

No. I simply happen to know that there are inherent limits on some
things. Limits which *no* improvement in tech level can get around.

I didn\'t say that they couldn\'t. I *wondered* how well they will do
against a sold chunk of metal, with no systems to damage. Especially
considering the low odds of getting a direct hit. It\'s far more likely
that ghits will be the fringe of the beam. 

Remember, a ship is a target with a minimum of several *thousand* times
the cross-sectional area of the projectile. How many square meters of
target does even the smallest ship present?

If they can target it in time. The odds are better than a thousand to
one *against* their getting a hit at 1 LS. And by making *minor*
variations in launch velocity, I can do a "time on target" attack. I
can speend several *weeks* firing projectiles, and they\'ll all arive at
the same time. Can you handle a thousand of them? How about ten
thousand? A hundred thousand? A million? (a million would be far
cheaper than the mass driver, and could be launched in a mer two weeks
at a rate of 1 every 1.25 seconds).

At one light second, the odds of the globe occulting *one* star are
millions to one. So much for your "hole in the background". Work it out
for yourself if you don\'t believe me.

It was only an idea. On the other hand, I seriously doubt that you can
get off enough *hits* to overload it during the time between detection
and impact. Remember, it\'s almost impossible to get a hit until the
last few *seconds* of flight, due to aiming limitations.

Again, it\'s *not* possible to hit it except by blind luck. And it\'d
take several shots to overload.

You missed my point *totally*. I did not say that you couldn\'t see a
candle at 100 feet. I said that you couldn\'t see one at 100 feet if I
was shing a *brighter* light into your eyes from 10 feet away! That\'s a
*considerably* different situation, and it demonstrates the "background
noise" problem. Heck, light a candle outdoors on a sunny day. Then
*try* seeing the flame from 100 feet away on a bright, sunny day. You
aren\'t likely to be able to see it unless there\'s a dark background.
The ambient light levels overwhelm it.

And my point is that the sensor is going to be limited by the
*brightest* source in it\'s fields of view, as well as by background
noise. A ship at 1 light second will totally overwhelm any signals from
100 AU.

Because I don\'t think they are that significant. Since if reasonable
precautions are taken, we *won\'t* be detected from the inner reaches of
the system, the only real consideration is the expense. And more
expensive projects (in relation to GNP) *have* been undertaken.
 
And if it\'s possible to detect me at 100 AU, I can move out to 1000.
That makes the flight time 10 times as long, but makes me 1/100th as
detectable. That makes timing a bit more important, but you can abort
the attack simply by having a ship in the inner system beam an "abort"
signal in the direction of the incoming projectiles. This\'d make them
re-target on the star, and thus be pretty much unnoticed.

  Now assuming have thought about compressing it via antimatter, to compress:
       
      center
      2  (compression resistance)     -  2/3   (TOTAL explosive force) dr
                                              
     r=outer edge                            same
        H2 filled sphere
                     
                      (math stuff deleted.....)
                               
                                or!.....

  kg antimatter needed =  2.6 * 10^-13 * [kg mass of H2 sphere] ^9

1 kg antimatter = .625 Mcr (MT quote)
   This compresses the H2 1 million fold. The H2 sphere __MUST__ be
completely precooled to <100 kelvin (see below).

        yep.....I said kg^9! ouch.......

        This is good for compressing fuel. It MAY be good for a warhead,
but you would have to find a way to heat it to 10^8 kelvin (nuclear damper in
reverse??) Pressure is very important to the H1+H1 fusion reaction, but the
temperature must be about 10^8 K (the entire mass, that is) for it to start.
Since PV=NRT, a sphere at <100 K compressed 10^6 fold would produce a
compressed T of <10^8 K...safe (this is a relative term!)
        A thin shell of antimatter compress the H2, then another shell 
forms
a diamond \'coating\' from a thick carbon source to keep it stable. It 
then
needs ~6 weeks cooling with a nuke damper to keep H+H reaction down in 
the
condenced matter \'blob\'. A nuclear damper after that time period is NOT
needed.

    On the subject of oort clouds, I have a few ideas on how to build a 
station that won\'t be found:

    o Black globes (Factor 1, to decrease local temperature, IR should 
be the main way to find a station, beside:
    o Grav generators (to negate gravity signature of the asteroid and 
station gravity, which can be detected lond distance)
    o EMM (for shipborne stealth, see below)
    o Methane compounds (use as a degraded EMM, for stealth on the 
cheap. For surface of asteroids)
    O Quantum stealth (decrease number of photons emitted by increasing 
their average energy. VERY hard and of questionable usefullness: An 
opponent can\'t find you they dont absorb many photons from your 
station. This is essentially EMM, but can be developed more (tech 
sensitive.)
    o Heat storage and dump at a non-visible place (liq H2 evaporation)
    o Jump1 capable mega-ships (absorbs asteroids for fuel, lower IR 
signature)

    Please, email me with ideas/suggestions:)    Nrunner

I\'m cross-posting this to the digest list as well, as the discussion has
spilled over onto that list...

RE:      HULL GRIDS AND THE JUMP SHIP CONCEPT

In digest 472, Charles Collin said:

>For those wanting to carry ore strapped to the outside, you need a big
>lanthanum net (I remember seeing an illustration of this somewhere...).

The illustration is from _Supplement 9: Fighting Ships_. A craft known as a
"Jump Ship" is shown on pp 22-23. The design notes say:

"Comments: The jump ship is designed to provide maximum flexibility in
interstellar transportation. As built, it is capable of jump-6 and 1-G. Special
field cables attached to the rear of the ship extend the ship\'s jump field to
include this additional cargo. Alterations in displacement will affect the size
of the jump itself, but the amount of cargo carried can be varied to fit the
needs."

"Capabilities: For each 1,000 tons of cargo carried in the mesh cables behind
the ship, jump is decreased by one. Thus, if the 5,000-ton ship carries 1,000
tons behind it, it can only perform jump-5. If it carries 5,000 tons behind it,
it can only perform jump-1. In all cases, the internal fuel tankage of the ship
(3,300 tons) is sufficient to support the jump."

"Jump Pods: The jump ship can transport valuable raw ores, planetoid chunks, and
other materials directly in its jump mesh. Only durable goods can be carried in
this manner because they are exposed directly to the vacuum of space."
"To allow the transport of other materials, jump pods have been constructed in a
variety of designs. Typically, each displaces 1,000 tons and can function
independently of the jump ship. Some basic designs for jump pods include the
following:"
"Cargo Pod: A bulk carrier displacing 1,000 tons and carrying approximately 950
tons of cargo. Several varieties are available, including special liquid
tankers, bulk food or grain carriers, and compartmented transport containers.
MCr 100."
"Passenger Pod: A large pressurised hull with 225 staterooms, plus recreational
facilities, safety compartmentalisation, and fittings for comfort. MCr 212.5."
"Low Pod: Similar to a passenger pod, the low pod is fitted with 1900 low berths
for carrying people or animals long distances. MCr 195."

"Additional types of pods are available, and have probably been produced
somewhere in the Imperium."
_Supplement 9: Fighting Ships_, GDW, USA, 1981, p22.

I have always assumed the following:
  - the cables are lanthanum-doped and act as an extension of the hull grid;
  - the jump pods have their own integral hull grid (as Charles agreed) plus
their own power supply in case of failure of either the jump ship\'s power or the
umbilical conection to the pod, AND so that they can be swapped around in orbit.

..and despite what GDW alters, you can go on doing what you want to in your own
campaign. Isn\'t that why they allowed all those "alternate technologies" into
the FF&S book??!!

Any non-maneuving target that can be tracked can be hit with a missile of

Were that entirely so, we\'d know nothing about the corona. The problem with
dim objects isn\'t wheter or not the background is greater apparent
magnitude, but the ability ability to notice changes from background that
are orders of magnitude smaller than background, and in the same
frequencies as background. Computer tech can improve effective sensor
performance significantly, by allowing greater discrimination. The problem
with current low light sensors is that their sensitivity is only within a
low magnitude; the future is in sensors which have an operational
flexibility at great magnitudes, while still being able to discriminate
fluctuations of a tiny magnitude.

Again, look at coroagraphs: effectively looking at a candleflame right
round an arclight. By carefull notation, and useing very sensitive
materials with a high base magnitude, we can see the corona in some types
of solar imaging WITHOUT occluding the solar disk. Or we can occlude the
solar disk. It\'s all a mater of knowing 3 things:

        1) how to build a sensor with a wide enopugh range to deal with the
background magnitude
        2) How to make said sensor accurate within a VERY small magnitude
from the base magnitude
        3) how to interpret the tiny variations in said magnitude (or
setting the squelch right) so as to detect those variations.

       At that point, the limitation becomes not the background magnitude,
but how much the background varies.

I suspect that that\'s the TL 16-18 range limit: How much does background
VARY, not how strong it is.

By TL 15, the sensitivity should be pretty good. And yes, we can track
objects of under 10m out to several LS... NASA currently does to around
lunar orbit (over 1.5 LS). NASA and the USAF are actively tracking over
3000 objects in orbit, some under 0.25m. (Again, See "Nova", the recent one
about the threat of cometary Impact. {I thought fondly of this thread while
I wathced it})

This will only be a partial answer, as I don\'t have the
Players\' Manual with me right now. In my edition of the PM
(it\'s a newer edition, as the first one I had was worn out),
there are two alternate rules for hand to hand combat. One
rule is the original, where you first determine if an attack can
be made, and then determine if you acually hit. As far as I
remember, STR is a modifier to the first task (but I may very
well be wrong).

The second rule is one task combining the two
aforementioned ones. It is a confrontation task, and I _think_
I remember, that STR is a DM there (some of my players
have just got themselves some bionics - as detailed in TD
13 - with STR 40, and are very enthusiastic about how
awesome they would be in a brawl - they should maybe
have thought about all the social drawbacks I intend to
throw in their faces - but I digress...). Maybe someone on
this list with access to a newer edition of PM could check
this out.

There is a 100 ton jump-only starship already designed. It is called an 
Xboat and it is detailed in the Classic Traveller supplement Traders & 
Gunboats, along with the 1000 ton Xboat tender [I was looking at the tender 
about a fortnight ago when I was planning my new CT campaign...].

>From memory, the Xboat is 100 tons. It has one jump drive, giving jump-4 [I 
think - I\'ll have a look tonight], along with power plant, fuel and 
computers. It has two standard staterooms and a crew of one (the second 
stateroom can be used to carry a passenger, or as extra living space for the 
pilot). It mounts no manuever drives (the Xboat tender picks it up and moves 
it around insystem).

I seem to recall seeing it in Fighting Ships (the CT one, not the MT one), 
but I could be mistaken.

If you want to stick very closely to canon, then no, it can\'t be
done. Let me elaborate a little on this.

Apparently, canon is not one thing, but many, on this
subject. Old CT sources are at odds with MT sources like
SOM and the writings of Joe Fugate on the subject (both in
TD and on GEnie). In MT you can\'t easily use your jump
fuel to make two jump-1s in stead of one jump-2, for
example. The description of the jump drive itself is also
different. So what is canon depends on which game you
are playing.

In MT, starships cannot be remote controlled or automated,
according to answers by Joe Fugate to some questions
posed on GEnie. He doesn\'t explain why, and it never
made sense to me. In my campaign, it is at least possible
to guide a ship into jump via remote, because that makes
sense to me. But it isn\'t canon.

If you allow remote controlling of jumps, then the "jump
missile" mentioned above is possible. But it would still
have to be 100+ tons and have a fully functional jump drive
and computer. Not a very cheap jump missile, and it
requires a rather large ship to be carried on board. Not
very practical, in my opinion.

The problem with this is that in order to image faint sources and do it
well enough you\'ll be using narrow field instruments and you\'ll have
pretty long integration times on the detector.  You might well be able
to find the target, but how many of these things will you need to cover
the entire volume of space every couple days when your field is a few
arc seconds wide----and you have to integrate on the source for several
minutes?  Quantum efficiency of detectors is really really high now, and
you get get more than 100% of the photons.

It\'d be useful to figure out the scanning rate, as well as what kinda
magnitudes these critters would be at the distances discussed.

They also said that it would take them 500 years to complete one survey
with the 2 astronomers they have doing this kind of stuff.  More
telescopes would help, and running 24 hour days would help.  Seems like
it could get down to a scan every 2 days using these figures.

	But Jump Torpedoes ARE cannon. They can be found in the CT
adventure "Leviathan" published by GDW. They do not damage the background
of Classic Traveller; they are an indispensible part of it. The
challenge is to come up with an explanation consistent with canon why
jump torpedoes are POSSIBLE. There are no design rules for them as far
as I know. Rules need to be made that mesh well with existing starship
design rules so that players can fully explore the potential of
these devices. The problem is that design rules from Book 2, Book 5,
Striker and MT are not consistent with one another.

STARSHIPS AS "JUMP MISSILES"
----

Amber Zone: "A Dagger At Efate", BJTAS #2 (selected from JTAS #5-8).
The mercenary cruiser _Dagger_ returned to the Efate system on course
for the mainworld, but isn\'t acknowleging hails from control.  The
players\' ship is ordered to investigate.  The ship is deserted, but
Auto/Evade is active in the computer, and it is locked on a course
that will cause it to crash into the largest concentration of Imperial
troops and supplies on Efate.  Internal evidence in the adventure
suggests that the ship has about a 2 G-turn vector as it approaches
the planet, as I recall.


OFFICIAL ROCK-THROWING
----

It turns out that there are official references to rock-throwing in
classic Traveller, as planetary bombardment.  High Guard mentions 
that empty bays can carry "deadfall ordnance", useless in space combat
but used in planetary bombardment.  The "Battle Fleets of the Marches"
article by Marc Miller mentioned that most CruRons have an auxiliary
"bulk ordnance carrier" attached to them to carry missile reloads for
the CruRon -- but in some cases, a *second* bulk ordnance carrier is
attached to mine small moons and planetoid belts for large rocks and
asteroids that will be used in the planetary bombardment phase of
an assault. 

A ship dropping deadfall ordnance could go onto an impact vector with
the target, shove the rock(s) gently out of the empty bay(s), and fly 
away, leaving the rock in the merciless hands of physics.  They might  
not be as effective as missiles, but they\'re a lot cheaper and readily
available on site in quantity.  You don\'t even need a mass-driver,
since the whole ship can be used as a big mass-driver.  This only
works if your target can\'t get out of the way, of course.

Merrick: NASA isn\'t the only one doing close orbital checking... I know
that my brother-in-law does little more than count satelites for the USAF,
at a Hawaiian Observatory. ESA counts Sats and Space Junk. The Russian Fed
counts sats and space junk. NASA, USAF, RCAF jointly look and count space
junk.

to quote Schumaker (of Shumacher-levy) "only 12 people are looking" was a
reference to asteroid searches. Nobody will actually tell how many military
types are looking... Maybe no-one actually knows.

The current limit on scanning is a combined factor of lack of suitable
instruments, and a lack of trained perople to maximize the use of many of
the existing instruments (Like University of Alaska Fairbanks\' Radio
Astronomy gear... mostly dormant).

I feel that by TL 15, hourly scans should be possible to cover most of the
sphere, with relatively good range and discrimination... 4 high orbit sats
with huge PEMS arrays (4-6 per sat) could get a quite panoramic view, and
each could synthetically combine it\'s on-board arrays, or dump data to a
groundside clearinghouse which synthesizes them all.

A late reply...

In Xboat 420, William Hostman replied to a question about nukes:
>>What is a "fusion" warhead in Traveller?
>>Is it a form of nuke?
>>If so, do Nuclear Dampers protect against it?

>Yes (to all). One of the bombs dropped on Japan at the end of WWII was nuke

Merrick was quite correct, in his reply to William. "Little Boy" was a
gun-type
uranium warhead, while "Fat Man" was an implosion-type plutonium warhead.
H-bombs were not perfected until 1952 (by the USA; the Soviet Union\'s first
was
in 1953, partly sped up due to successful spying).

Note that "Fat Man" was essentially identical to the first A-bomb, "Trinity".
The Manhattan Project scientists were not convinced that it would work, as it
depended on conventional explosives to push a ring of plutonium into a tight
sphere. If the sphere was not formed correctly, it wouldn\'t have worked -
critical mass would not have been reached. "Trinity" proved that the bomb
worked.

The first one dropped in anger was actually "Little Boy" - they were so
utterly
certain it would work that they didn\'t even bother to test it.

Are we talking about stuff that close, or stuff winging in from
outsystem?  Space junk is usually counted with radar, I believe, and
satellites are at a whopping range of a couple hundred kms at most for
the ones the AF is interested in.

They are looking for deep space objects.  That requires big light
buckets to do.  The problem is that if you image deep, you image a
smaller field.  Radio won\'t work for a lot of the junk we\'re talking
about (wasn\'t it oort cloud stuff to begin with?)----well, it will as
long as the scale size of the source is bigger than the wavelength.

I\'m not saying it isn\'t possible at TL15, but I bet it\'s damn hard.  And
*much* harder if the object is trying to hide.  A 1m blob from a
massdriver would be hell to spot.  You\'d need a bloody large array to
resolve it even at 1 million km (around 610m dia. in visible, over a
million km in 1m radio).  I have a figure of 6degrees in my head for a
ballpark field width of a Schmidt camera... could be wrong.  This would
be the size of your image on the sky (and at the same kinds of visible
wavelengths).  You\'d need to take thousands of images to do the whole
sky.  The brightness of the object will determine how long you need to
hold the camera on that frame... the 1m test sphere will be pretty
faint.

I need to dig up a book at the other house to check the real poop on
this.

Actually, Merrick, No visual sources have imaged any earth-crossing
cometary/asteroidal materials; all imaging has been radio astronomy
(Shumaker or Levy). Visual sightings are said to be the rarity, due to the
"Light Buckets" needed, but with passive EMS (radio astronomy) it becomes
practical. Also, Radio astronomy seems to be much more common (UAF, for
example does almost no visdible light work, but extensive small-scale radio
work).

and as for locations, MOST is in the LEO range, but not all. THey still
track pieces from Apollo 13\'s debris (They think it is; it\'s in the right
place).

The important point is that they can and do track items under 1m out to
1LS; and can hit =842m target at lunar orbit with a reference laser for luna=
r
orbit measurements. (legacy of the apollo program, but I don\'t recall just
which one).

Yes, I _know_ that "Leviathan" contains jump torpedoes.
What I was trying to say in my last message is that
canonical sources are not mutually consistent (now where
have I seen that before :-)). The MT rules explicitly states
that a vessel, in order to be a starship, _must_ be larger than or equal to
100
 displacement tons.

All I\'m trying to say here is that we can discuss this issue
from now till hell freezes over, and keep hitting each other
in the head with quotes from different canonical sources.
But we are playing to have fun, and each referee can run
his or her campaign excactly as he/she likes it. _I_ don\'t
view "Leviathan" as a source that I can use (canonical or
not), because it conflicts with the way _I_ read other
canonical sources. Other people may view this entirely
differently, and that\'s okay with me. Let\'s not make a
religous war out of this.

I\'m just saying that the way _I_ read the MT canon, jump
missiles doesn\'t make much sense to _me_.

So try to reconcile the two. Play around with definitions. What is a
"vessel"? I suggest that a vessel has to be able to carry crew. Thus
we rephrase the two canonical sources to say that 1) A jump-capable
vehicle capable of carrying passengers must be at least 100 T and 2)
Jump torpedoes exists. Can you reconcile those two statements? I can.

        The world generation system is biased (IMO) towards making worlds
within the Imperium. Someone some time ago posted a "Wilderness" world
generation system, which is somewhere on my hard drive. I\'ll try to dig it
up soon & forward it to you.

First off, the above was regarding the use of *beam* weapons.

Missiles have a better chance, but since the object to be intercepted
is travelling at 1.5% of c, they have to be *very* close or *very* fast
to intercept unless the projectile is detected at unreasonable ranges.

Check a few issues back for the table showing how close a missile
launcher would have to be to make an intercept assuming *constant*
acceleration at various rates.

Well, remember that a 1 meter onject is 100 times harder to observe
than a 10 meter object. And that my projectiles are deliberately
stealthed. 

And even a 10 LS detection isn\'t as much help as some would think.
Remember, impact will be in less than 11 minutes from when you detect
it. What are the odds of having a missile that can intercept before
impact.

There are several laser reflectors on the moon. But it doesn\'t require
all that much pointing accuracy to hit them. The laser has spread out
to several *miles* across by the time it gets there. But since the
reflectors use special quartz "corner" mirrors, the part of the beam
that reaches them is reflected directly back to the source.

This still give *distance* measurements accurate to a high degree.

Although Leviathan was published by GDW, it wasn\'t written by them. It was 
written by the design team at Games Workshop here in the UK (who were 
printing Traveller under licence at the time). I know, because I saw the 
proofs for it at Games Workshop shortly before it was printed.

What this means is that the jump torpedo could quite easily have slipped 
through GDW\'s checking and become canon by accident. Classic Traveller had 
the \'not less than 100 tons\' limit for jump-capable craft too, and, as jump 
torpedoes are mentioned nowhere else (in Classic, MT or TNE), I can only 
assume that this is what actually happened.

Although they do not damage the background, I would dispute that jump 
torpedoes are indispensible. From his comments, I think Mark Seemann holds a 
similar view. As he says:

There are a lot of things I like in Leviathan, but I don\'t view jump 
torpedoes as canon, because they are not detailed elsewhere and the MT rules 
were not changed to allow jump capability in anything less than 100 tons.

> The challenge is to come up with an explanation consistent with canon why

You could always try GDW\'s original get-out clause (ancient artifacts), or 
you could say that they are experimental and that the Leviathan was the 
test-bed for them.

universe.  While one can play around with the canonical sources a bit and 
make them fit on the "fictional physics" level, this does not address 
certain important questions.  For instance:

1) Why have an X-boat network for delivering mail?  Why not just have a 
bunch of mass-produced little jump-6 torpedoes speeding all over the 
universe?  They could even carry some types of very small cargoes.  And 
they would be much cheaper.

2) Why not put some payloads on these jump torps and just send buckets of 
them into enemy systems as a cheap attack strategy (though it provide 
little more than harrassment, I don\'t know)?

This is not to shoot down jump torps, I just feel one has to deal with
such issues if one wants to include them in the Traveller universe.  An
interesting possibility someone brought up recently is that jump torps
have low survival rates (e.g., half of them don\'t make it through jump
space).  This might make them impractical for an empire\'s regular
communications network, but handy for emergency situations.

Um, in IR Astronomy, the noise from the sky and the receiver (ie. the
"background") is of order 1000000 times the signal from the astronomical
objects.  You can always increase your sensitivity by increasing the
number of independent samples of what you are observing by egs. (i)
increasing integration time (ii) increasing the "bandwidth" of your
receivers (iii) increasing the number of sensor elements.  Sensitivity is 
simply the weakest signal you cab detect.  All you have to do to detect a 
signal anywhere in your local system is build enough sensor arrays that 
you can integrate for long enough in each direction on a reasonable 
timescale to have a good chance of picking up the activity you are 
interested in.  The only limitation from the point of view of detection 
is an economic/political will one, not a technological/physics one.  BTW, 
when I sadi that IR astronomer deal with background noise 1000000 times 
the signal, most of that is due to the atmosphere.  If you can put your 
sensor arrays in orbit, much of the noise goes away, but you can still 
see thing 1000000 times dimmer than the (much reduced) remaining background!

variable (or as in the near-IR you "chop") then the related noise will only
be the square root of it and the signal to noise will increase as the
square root of the integration time, number of exposures or whathever else
you do to see something. 

It is also worth noticing that in the optical reaching levels 100 times
fainter

similarly 1000 times fainter than the background is "normal" in the K band
(2.2 microns).

A 1000000 times below the background = 15 magnitudes is not trivial...

Concerning getting rid of the atmosphere effects, one way is just to fly
above
it. Indeed in the next Hubble Space Telescope refurbishment mission "we" will
install NICMOS, a near-IR camera. Alternatively people are playing with the
idea of filtering out the (important) part of the atmospheric background that
is in emission lines. This gains a factor 10 or so when observing from the

The price of the torpedoes is not listed in Leviathan (not that I can
find). Their reliability is not mentioned either. I get the impression
that the lack of mention of reliability means that they are fairly
reliable. I would NOT imagine that they are cheap tho. (If you have to
ask how much, you probably can\'t afford it...) And they certainly cannot
carry as much information or cargo as an Xboat. And each one of them
would have to have a miniaturized model 4 computer and jump-4 drive. This
would run to what? MCr20? MCr40? I don\'t have my books here, so I don\'t
know how much the standard sized stuff is. I do not imagine that the
miniature models would be cheaper. And they would have to be to make the
Cr/megabyte cost of transport lower.

Given the fact that the Xboat network exists, I would guess either that
J-torps are very expensive, or that the Imperial Officials in charge of
the Xboat network are getting some serious kickbacks from the
contractors who build and maintain the network. Or both (and the two
explanations might be related.)

	Another explanation might be found by looking at the modern day
US. Why do we subsidize an expensive, high-maintainance Interstate Highway
System instead of a cheap, low-maintainance interstate rail system?
There are probably lots of reasons, both good and bad. I can think of a
few; and some of these reasons might still apply in the 57th century.

I would first like to thank everyone who put in input for the "jump
torpedo" question.  The idea that passenger carrying jump capable
vehicles must be at least 100 tons, while strictly instumentation
laden vehicles may be of even smaller size seems like a good one
to me (...perhaps smaller jump grids (< 100 tons) will not adaqutely
shield biological systems from jump space, but can easily protect
relatively durable electronic system).  Combine this with the idea
that many do not survive the trip through jump space and are therefore
not reliable as an xboat substitute and I think they (jump torps) have
been worked into Traveller without upsetting the balance too much.
They would be used strictly as emergency devices (however as tech. 
improves they might eventully replace xboats--(boo hiss...)  The pony
express didn\'t last forever).  Again thanks for the ideas.

Secondly, in Xboat 434 I asked Paul Colley if he would expound on his
post concerning a local EMP generator (Xboat 420).  I did not mean to 
restrict this question only to Paul.  If anyone else has anything on
this please share with the rest of us.

Finally, I wanted to add some possible fuel to the already terribly bloody
mass driver war we are currently experiencing.  Some quick (and possibly
incorrect) calculations indicate that in order for a _mostly_ ballistic
projectile to hit an Earth-sized planet at 100AU, the 1000km long accelerator
will have to be accurate to within 87/1000 of a second of arc (manuevering
of projectile not assumed) to the position of the planet 40 days in the 
future (is this position known w/o error?).  I assume thrusters on the 1000km
diameter oort body will have to move the accel to this percision and then
stabalize it within this degree of percision as well.  Also, at tech 15
will components of a guidance system be able to withstand a 1000g impulse and
still remain properly calibrated?  Be calm, I\'m not saying it isn\'t possible,
just that no one has dealt with the above questions yet.

Can anyone explain to me how sandcasters are supposed to work in CT
The rules say that a DM of -3 is applied to hit for every 25mm of 
obscuring sand.  So I take it one launches sand from one\'s sandcaster,
but then I get confused.  If the sand laucher rolls a "hit" (8+) does
this put a cloud of sand between him and his attacker?  If this is what
happens, is fire from _both_ ships now at -3?  If not how does the 
casting ship avoid the penalty?  Or does the sand impact the other ship,
somehow fowling its systems such that they operate at a DM of -3?   How
many successful "hits" with a sandcaster constitute "25mm of obsuring 
sand"?  Etc...etc...etc?

I apologies if this is too stupid a question for the answers to be posted;
feel free to send answers to me directly if this is so.  It\'s just that
I have never been able to figure out how to use sandcasters from the CT
rules  (It this matter is more clearly addressed in MT or TNE, I apologize
again.  GDW says that TNE is "out of print" for the time being and wouldn\'t
send me one, and I\'ve been having a hard time finding MT (anyone got a 
boxed set they want to sell?))

Again thanks for your answers to my questions in the past.  Hopefully you
all can set me straight on this too.

In a similar vein, how long does the obscuring effect of the sand last? It
should be moving along with the same vector of the ship, so it should work
as long as the defending ship doesn\'t maneuver, shouldn\'t it?

Wow, do you actually use the CT system?  I thought I was the only one!  
There are a couple of problems with the system as outlined in Book 2.  
Sandcasters are not very well explained, and neither are missiles.  They 
mention that missiles "start with the same vector as the firing craft", 
but don\'t explain any further (at what rate to do missiles accelerate, 
for instance?).  Also, have you ever tried a battle using fighters or 
other high acceleration ships using CT space combat?  Can anyone say 
"gymnasium"?  

The way I resolve these issues is as follows.  Feel free to lambaste me 
for my ignorance, as it\'s been a long time since I used the CT space 
combat system, but here goes:

Sand-casters:  Each shot from a sand-caster produces a circle of 
sand 25 mm in diameter that can be sent in any direction with a vector up 
to 100 mm in length.  That is, the sand is "shot", usually so as to be 
interposed between firer and opponent.  The sand has the vector of the 
firing ship plus whatever vector it was given when fired.  Any ship firing 
through sand gets a -3 to hit.  This is based on some information I read 
(in JTAS?) which said that sandcasters could be used as powerful weapons 
against ground troops, hitting them with a "giant shotgun blast" of very 
high velocity particles.

Missiles:  Based on some information in the Annic Nova adventure, I have 
missiles accelerate for up to 10 turns at 10 g\'s.  When they get within 
10mm of a target, they fire, doing 1D6 hits.

Gymnasium Floors as Space Maps:  One way to reduce the size of the 
surface needed for combat is to reduce the length of a turn but keep 
everything else constant.  A good turn length is 316 seconds (call it 5 
minutes).  With this, ships move 10 mm per g each turn instead of 100.  It 
keeps things more manageable, and you still have a scale which allows cool 
gravitational effects and such.

Well, there you go.  Some of my figures may be off in the above, as I 
haven\'t used the CT system in a while (I now use my own space combat 
system based partially on Brilliant Lances and partly on High Guard), but 
I hope this helps.

The basic idea is that you dump a huge current pulse into a coil
wrapped around a ferrite or steel core. This creates a *huge* spike in
the magnetic field. It also tends to impose huge stresses on the coil.
Left to itself the coils would either explode (the magnetic field
imposes a *significant* pressure on the coil) or melt from the high
current flow.

But at the moment the current peaks, you set off explosive charges
arranged so as to implode the coil. Since the field is "trapped" in the
core, imploding it raises the field density even higher. It also
amplifies an "uneven-ness" in the field. These inhomogenities, combined
with the the *huge* field density create the EMP. 

As I understand it, we can build a briefcase sized device that\'d
clobber most electronics for as much as 100 yards. And since the blast
is an implosion, there\'d be very little blast damage (the briefcase
would probably contain most of it).

Well, I knew better than to assume that sufficient accuracy could be
gotten on launch. That\'s why I put course correction thrusters on the
projectiles. Also, the position of the planet should be know fairly
well (from observations made during construction), and the guidance
package and thrusters should handle the rest. I was assuming only about
a 1 second accuracy on launch, and I expect that one *minute* would be
sufficient.

I wouldn\'t want that job. That\'s why I figured on only stabilizing to
one arc-second, and using course corrections.

Yes. Because we *already* handle that sort of thing. Proximity fuzed
anti-aircraft shells have a radar set in the nose. And they are fired
from artillery! We were doing this in WWII when the radar sets had to
use *tubes*. They retain calibration quite well. 

At one million gees, it\'s a bit harder. But I suspect that we can
handle this *now*. Solid state gear is *tough*. It handles acceleration
well. It\'s *vibration* that\'s a killer.

Hi.  I\'ve been lurking for a while, but haven\'t submitted anything, since I 
use the MT game-engine in a further-advanced technological setting. (Jumps 
in my universe are, on average, an hour per parsec, and if you have a J4 
ship with enough fuel for two jumps, you can "connect" the jumps, and do an 
8-parsec jump with one set of calculations.)

I\'m a heretic, I know.

At any rate, I seem to remember someone mentioning a website with tons and 
tons of ship designs.  Anyone got the address handy?

Thanks.

This contradicts my (admittedly imperfect) understanding of how these
things work.

First of all, it\'s damn hard to create a "*huge* spike in the magnetic
field".  First and foremost, the coil is an inductor that resists
changes in current.  Setting up a strong magnetic field takes time.
That\'s *why* you create the magnetic field, then manipulate the device
mechanically (how\'s that for a sanitized way of saying "blow the sucker
up"?  :-)).  It\'s easier to use explosives to suddenly change the
physical characteristics of the device than it is to suddenly change
the current.

The coils are under some stress, but it shouldn\'t be
excessive----looking at my physics textbook (Halliday & Resnick
"PHYSICS") the net force on the coils seems to be quite small in
comparison to the magnetic field strength.  On the other hand, the
wires are admittedly fragile.  This could be a concern for the failure
of the device, but not for it failing explosively.

And the force, such as it is, works to force the coils closer together,
not apart.  An explosion is unlikely.  If the device fails at this
stage, it would likely be by coils being forced together to the point
at which the insulation fails and shorts, changing the coil into a
linear conducting tube (and thus essentially eliminating the magnetic
field).

Melting is of course quite possible----That\'s why these things have to
be cryogenically cooled.  Superconductors remove the heat problem; or
even short of superconducting, cooling with liquid nitrogen would be a
real good idea (drops resistence, and thus heat generation,
considerably, and cools the coils to boot).

This part sounds plausible.

We can\'t create an "implosion".  To implode things, you surround them
with explosives which compress the interior----but viewed from outside
of the device, it\'s still just a explosion.

The blast is small because all it has to do is destroy/explode/implode
(whatever) the coil.  The goal of implosion does nothing to restrict
the collateral physical damage.

Is the Imperium trying to keep something from getting out

Hey, haven\'t I seen this question before from Sanger?
Not that it\'s any less interesting than before...

Personally, I think that Dulinor would have finally managed to seize 
Capital (remember that last fleet he sent to Capital?  Without Virus, I 
think he would have pulled it off.).  

However, it would have taken decades - possibily as long as 70 
years - until the Imperial Core had recovered enough to try to take on 
Vland and the Domain of Delphi.

The Domain of Deneb would have become either a formal monarchy or a 
republic.  Archduke Brkz was blown up - which led to the rapid 
disintergration of the League of Antares.  Probably, the area would have 
become a part of the Julian Protectorate.  The "Domain of Delphi" (aka 
Margraet\'s stronghold) and the Daibei Federation would have stabilized, 
and may have become rather powerful if the Solomani Confederation was as 
weak as is sometimes thought.  

Note: Archduchess Margaret bore twins, one of which was a clone(?) of 
Strephon.  The Domain of Delphi and Dulinor\'s Imperium would be at odds, 
probably leading to a new war.

The Vegans were well on there way to being conquered by the late 1120\'s.  
However, it may have regained it\'s freedom if the Solomani fractured as 
badly as people on TML/XTML seem to feel.  I persponally suspect that the 
Solomani would have simply reconquered it\'s Sphere, and then focused it\'s 
expansion efforts rimwards.

The Domain of Deneb would have been somewhat deal smaller than the Regency 
at 1200.  By the time the fighting there stopped, all Imperial holdings 
in Trojan Reach and Reft Sector would have been lost, although more of 
Deneb would have been recovered, at least to Segan. 

(sorry, but I\'m  following offical GDW history regarding the Aslan/Vargr 
ivasions, rather than admitting that - given our knowledge of their 
demographics and technology - any such invasion is impossible)

Very few pocket empires (The Covenant of Sufren, maybe?) would have 
survived the Short Dusk.  The Real Strephon wouldn\'t have, as it\'s bones were
being picked on by more and more raiders - including Star Vikings - by 1130.

Here\'s a nifty suggestion - what if sandcasters don\'t really shoot sand...
my idea?  WATER.  Pretty simple, absorbs a TON of energy, melts, vaporizes,
condenses, refreezes etc forever....well, okay, a long time.  Easy to store,
and useful, too.

They can\'t be trying to keep something from getting out of A & C, since
the starports prove (at least to me) that the Droyne have star travel.
In my universe only Jump-1 star travel, which they use to keep contact
between the two worlds, but star travel nevertheless. A jump-1 starship
with sufficient tankage could reach 5 or 6 parsecs out before it had to
refuel, so letting the Droyne have _any_ jump ships means you can\'t
keep them confined.

Wait! That\'s not quite true. You _could_ inspect each ship as it leaves
either of the planets and make sure it only has fuel for a jump-1. But
then there\'s that Droyne free trader in "Merchant". No, I don\'t think
that can be the truth. As for a cover for building up strength on the
other side of the Sword Worlds: Why would they need any excuse for that?

I still think that A & C is interdicted in order to prevent off-world
scavengers from plundering Ancient sites. Either that or the Imperium is
trying to prevent Joe Q. Public from learning that _every_ Droyne has
psionic abilities (Oh! The Horror!!)

I always understood that you didn\'t have to "hit" with sandcasters, you just 
dropped it in the vicinity of your ship and it moved with the velocity your 
ship had when you dropped it.  And, yes, it would affect both your lasers and

your enemy\'s.
===============================

In \'High Guard\' though, sandcasters must be "penetrated" by lasers, for
example, 
before they can damage a target. Your own \'casters don\'t affect your lasers,
only 
the other sides.

I\'ve never really gone beyond the CT system, I wasn\'t that happy with MT,

I have the JTAS supplement on missile design, if anyone\'s interested.

Charles, I like your use of sandcasters, I\'ve never really considered the 
problem enougth to solve it.

"Gymnasiums", how about using a computer.  You need 6 numbers per ship 
for its position and vector.  Some sort of standard language for coping 
with the ship description.  And away you go!

You could even present players with the "tactical" display for their own 
ship!

Wow.

There\'s been an unusual number of messages lately about GDW 
instead of about Traveller... I must have missed a few things
though.

Where is Dave N. going?
Someone said they called GDW to order a copy of TNE and GDW said
it\'s out of print! Could TNE be _permanently_ out of print?

Anyways, I hope GDW doesn\'t go the way of DGP, as I doubt Roger
Sanger has enough spare change to buy the rights to all of GDW\'s
Traveller material too. :)

Also, are there any list-lurkers in Ottawa out there who would
be interested in playing in the new year? Care to start commuting
up here for the odd game, Alvin?

I can only dream.... What I\'d like to do is give the Clasic Traveller 
rights to this list: _that_ would liven things up around here!

A mighty long journey!  However, I am a computer-programmer-in-training, 
so I might head for Ottawa for the job opportunities.

Hi, i am new in this list, but anybody have read the Megatraveller`s 
Journal 4?
In that Journal are a series of memos between Rob Caswell and other 
members with a history line, that it was supposed to be official, but 
with the virus everything went to the trashbin.
In that history line an alliance between Dulinor and Margaret was made 
and they defeated Lucan, I suppose i haven`t the material and there pass 
a lot of time since the last time that i readed it, if i am wrong, sorry 
for the incovenience.

Steve mentioned that you could effectively replace sand with water.  This 
brings up an interesting little question:  what is "sand" in the first 
place?  Is actually just rock dust?  I\'ve always thought it was some sort 
of reflective chaff-like material and that "sand" was just a 
colloquialism.  Is there any canon on these canons?  (sorry, bad pun).

In terms of the CT system taking up lots of room, I usually reduce the 
time scale as previously noted, but one thing I\'ve always dreamt of is 
doing the opposite: increasing the scale by a factor of 10!  Picture this:  
you get a football field, some long peices of rope with markings every ten 
cms, and every model spaceship you can find, then you go out and fight 
the mother of all Traveller space combats!  If any of you guys in Ottawa 
want to try it out, just let me know.

I\'m in a similar situation to Rob, except I\'m in Montreal.  Like him, 
though, I go up to Ottawa quite frequently.  I have a freind there who 
also plays Traveller, and I could bring him along (I\'ve been trying to get 
him to join the list, but he\'s busy.  I will, however, send his email 
address to other Ottowa-based list people once I get his permission).

It notes that, while "Thyo Supud was formed by a Droyne 
kroyloss ... from Andor (0236 Spinward Marches) and 
operates a single free trader ... along the Spinward Main

Yes, there is cannon. I don\'t remember exactly where, but it explains the
sand of sandcasters. Something about manufactured silicone based crystals,
doped with ferrous compounds at earlier TL\'s, held in place by magnetic or
tractor fields. The Screens roll is to swing the field into just the right
position.

As to water, it\'s a great idea, but it\'s definitly not going to be as
effective. I\'d halve the effects by system in use for water based.

As for natural sand, well, gravitic priciple sandcasters would be able to
handle it... magnetics probably wouldn\'t.

And remember, it\'s the largest legal shotgun. (also cannon from either MT
or CT, don\'t remember which. But my players seem to always be able to show
me on a moment\'s notice.)

I\'ve always assumed that it was sand to break up and refract the laser beam. 
In space it would work better than \'chaff\' (which is designed to look like a 
target to an oncoming missile\'s radar anyway).

A friend and I once used the CT system (actually the Mayday! rules, but the 
differences are very minor as I recall) to run a participation game at a 
show. We had a table about 6\' by 3\', covered with a black cloth and we used 
coloured thread pinned to the board (we had a cork board under the cloth) 
and some scratchbuilt starship models. It looked very impressive and we had 
a lot of interest.

I would imagine that Binges is just a port of registry. In order for the 
Thyo Supud  to trade in the Imperium, their ship would have to be registered 
and have a listed home port. Presumably the Imperium has some kind of 
regulation barring red zones being used as home ports (to avoid legal 
complications serving writs [or whatever] against the ship\'s owners).

I tend to the view, expressed elsewhere on this list, that the Thyo Supud 
_can_ go home if they want to (as can any Droyne), but non-Droyne are barred 
from Candory and Andor.

Since RICE papers seem to be quite popular, I was
wondering if anyone has assembled a complete list
of planets/systems that have already been described
in greater-than-UPP detail by GDW/DGP. 

It wouldn\'t be an actual reproduction of said material,
merely a list of things that have been done in "the canon"
somewhere so people don\'t walk over previous material.

(Everyone is free to ignore canon, of course, but I think this
would still be useful.)

Maybe I\'ll go through my own collection this weekend...
I don\'t have any issues of Challenge, Traveller\'s Journal,
MT Journal, etc, so people who have big article collections
are welcome to email me with a world/article/magazine lists.

That is, if anyone thinks this might be useful...

Yikes, that\'s totally different from the image I had.  Based on High 
Guard, I always thought that you were just firing large clouds of the 
stuff between yourself and the enemy.

Maybe you know something about this I don\'t, but why would water be less
effective?  It refracts light quite nicely.  Also, for you physics types: 
how effective would a cloud of sand be?  How dense would it have to be to
have a decent effect?  What mass of sand per shot are we talking about
here?  As for the giant shotgun concept, I love that idea.  I wonder if
you could load different sorts of things into it (NOW FOR SALE:  The
Universe\'s Biggest Rock Salt Shotgun!).  Other sadistic ideas welcome.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

But isn\'t part of the sand\'s effect to screw up sensors?  Why would it 
have effects against missiles and energy weapons otherwise?  Is it 
supposed to destroy missiles by impact?  The relative velocity could be 
really high, so that seems plausible, I\'m just not sure what the canon is.
Also, I can\'t see how a cloud of sand would really affect energy weapons.

Also from David:

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Sounds cool, but I think the Mayday! rules must be somewhat different than
CT if you could run a large battle on a 6\'x 3\' table.  In CT, a ship can
quickly build up a vector of a meter or more.  That is the problem I have 
with it.  

This is the movement system I use now, let me know what you think of it 
(be gentle):

Hexes are 10000 km, turns are 1000 s.  One g/turn accelerates a ship by
one hex per turn.  All ships start with an initial speed in hexes, and one
of 12 directions (the hex sides and vertices are used).  A
ship has two counters on the board:  One a picture/miniature of the ship,
the other a simple arrow for pointing at its direction of travel.  When a
ship moves, you do the following steps: 

1. Initial Vector:  Leave behind the vector counter as a marker of initial
position and move the ship counter forward a number of hexes equal to its
present speed (in whatever direction it is presently moving). 

2. Thrust Vector:  Move the ship counter from its new location in any 
direction.  The maximum number of hexes moved equals the ship\'s thrust. 

3. Calc New Vector:  Count the number of hexes between the ship counter and 
its vector counter (which was left behind).  This is the ship\'s new 
speed.  The new direction is figured by tracing a line between the vector 
counter and the ship counter and "rounding" to one of the 12 directions.

4. Mark New Vector:  Now you record the new speed and move the vector
counter to the hex with the ship in it, pointing in the direction of
travel. 

I find this system quick, simple, and a good approximation of reality.  
If you want gravitational effects, they\'re easy to add in, but it helps 
if you change the time/size scale to 316 second turns on a 1000 km hex 
map so that you can have grav bands.  Unfortunately, this scale puts the 
ships really close to one another for firing purposes and you have to 
come with a justification for them missing one another.

I have one problem with my system and every other vector system I\'ve seen, 
though: 
Why does the ship appear at the head of its vector?  Shouldn\'t it be
halfway along the vector?  Delta-V is AT^2, but distance travelled is
half that, no?  This can have relevance in terms of range for firing, and 
gravitational effects.  


I can see the tomatoes flying already,

Charles.

I had such a list for the Spinward Marches.  It includes everything
listed in JTAS/Challenge from 6, 9-77, all the adventures, plus the 
Traveller Adventure, all the Alien Supplements except the Droyne.

Having just bought the Spinward Marches Campaign, I\'ll update my
list and put it up.

I\'ve always wanted to play the campaign version, with the limited
information rules!  Alas, I\'m bogged in thesis work and can\'t make a
huge time committment in the next few months (as in, there\'s no way I
have the time needed to design ships...)

But, if somebody is running such a limited-information campaign and is
looking for a player to command a fleet, I could certainly find time
for that.

I thought that sand affected missiles by scraping off their 
external sensor arrays, but then I don\'t know if that\'s 
canonical or not.  Wouldn\'t sand diffract the energy 
weapon\'s beam like a laser beam?

    'body' => 'Hi All.  This is for you physics types.  I was thinking about some 
alternate settings for Traveller, and I\'ve come up with a few questions 
about antimatter.

1. Why is antimatter such a difficult source of energy to develop (i.e.,
according to the Traveller background)?  We can produce very tiny amounts
of anti-matter now, and contain it.  It seems like a simple matter to
allow it to annihilate with normal matter and harness the energy.  Is it
simply a matter of producing sufficient quantities? 

2. Does producing antimatter use up more energy than it can potentially 
return?  How likely is it that one could develop an efficient-enough 
production technique to yeild reasonable returns (i.e., is this a 21st 
century concept, or a 21st millenium concept?)?

3. How likely is one to find large amounts of antimatter in 
space?  If a system were made of anti-matter, would we know it?  Could 
there be large amounts of "dark" antimatter out there?  

4. This one is a bit psycho:  If there were a collapsed anti-matter 
object (black hole, neutron star, etc.), would it have different 
qualities than the same sort of normal matter object?  What if a normal 
matter black hole smacks into an antimatter black hole (do you get a 
galaxy-cracking explosion, or just a more massive black hole?)?

5. Aside from the particles having opposite charges, what are the 
properties of antimatter?  Does it follow the same rules for gravity, 
electromagnetism and so on?

I got this out of "The Journal" No. 14. I\'ve shortened it a bit to save on 
some space, but the most important parts are here.

 "Smaetal Swarms.  Populary known as \'smarts\', minnies, and pirhana bugs, 
are an extreamly small, flying life form native to Smaeta, near the Imperial 
core, but now found infrequantly on countless humid, tropical environments 
on worlds across the Imperium."
 "Each adult smeat weighs less than .1 gram, and has a wingspan of less than 
1 cm. They are generally encountered as an upright, pillar-shaped cloud, 
about 2 m tall, which drifts along just above the ground. One cloud may 
contain 50k individuals."
 "Smaets have a rather complicated reproductive cycle. The eggs, which are 
laid by the thousands on unripe fruit, seem to mature and develope as the 
fruit ripens, drawing on the fruit\'s internal chemistry in some fation. 
Various methods of ripening of the fruit seem only to delay the maturation 
of the eggs. When the eggs hatch, the tiny winged reproductive phase of the 
creature burrows out, and joins the local, rapidly growing swarm."
 "Smeats are carnivores. The cloud will approch any homeothermic life form 
of more than 50 kg mass at the speed of a man\'s run. A single bite is no 
more than an annoying pinprick, but thousands of bites in the space of a few 
moments can be deadly, and smaets are classified as dangerious life forms."
 "Attacks by a smaetal swarm causes 2D damage per turn. Individule roll are 
made against every character which occupies the same area as the swarm. They 
can be avoided by jumping into water or running through fire or thick smoke. 
Torches confuse them. Though they will attack a man carrying a torch or 
burning brand, they will inflict only 1D damage per turn. Each turn, the 
character may throw 2D to see if the torch breaks up the swarm long enough 
for the characters to escape (throw 9+ to do so). Smaets can pursue a human 
as fast as he can run, and for al long."
 "Persons partially protected by armor suffer only 1D damage points each 
round they are attacked, but most types of armor will not completely protect 
an individual. Only characters in compleately self-contained environments 
(vacc suits, combat armor, battle dress, or sealed combat environment suits) 
will be compleately safe from smaetal attacks. But they may suffer accidents 
due to vision imparement."
 "Unfortunatly, those weapons best able to disperse a swarm (gernades, wide 
beam plasma guns, flame throwers and the like) are inappropriate for use 
within the confines of a starship hold or starship terminal. Vacuume, jets 
of water, or blast from CO^2 fire extinguishers have been known to control 
them in close quarters. The eggs have thus far proven immune to all common 
ovicidal techniques, including fumigation and irradiation."

Why is water less effective? In space, once it\'s heated to 1=B0C, it\'s
instant vapor, and no longer crystals. Silicone crystals absorb more energy
per gram before turning into clouds o vapor.

Natural sand wouldn\'t be as cohesive as the silicone doped with iron. Not
due to lack of absorbtion, but do to the inability to swing it.

I\'ve always played sandcasters (when my gun-bunnies have even bothered with 
them) as a spacebourne version of chaff. The sand crystals refract and break 
up the beam from the laser.

If a missile flies through a sand cloud, the multiple impacts of sand 
particles work in a similar fashion to the rapid firing chain guns of today

I\'m not sure what the canon is either (or even if there is one). This is 
just how I\'ve always viewed it.

I can\'t remember exactly how we did it (it is more than 12 years ago now), 
but I think we just shortened the scale slightly. We also kept it to a small 
number of ships on the board at a a time.  Mayday! and book 2 (CT) are 
effectively the same system (I saw my copy of Mayday the other day - maybe 
I\'ll check what the differences are this weekend).

energy weapons are actually "plasers", meaning that the plasma \'rides\' a

otherwise scatter very quickly.  So, one could view sand as refracting the

I think del Rey means that SF fans want their future histories to be full
of big, decisive and clear cut events.  He is probably implying that these
sorts of events are unrealistic, but that they are none the less fun to
read about (and roleplay).  Some people even 
think the whole rise and
collapse idea in world history is innacurate and that historians have
latched onto it to make things seem more structured when they really are
not.  I\'ve had to defend the Long Night concept on several occasions
because my players considered it implausible for such a massive collapse
to occur (Safety Tip: Don\'t let ancient history buffs into your 
campaings!  :-).  I know some people on the T:TNE 
list do not buy Virus as a plausible cause of interstellar collapse. 

Oops, there I go, starting another contentious thread  :-)

Since you must (in anything extrapolatable from real scince) create
antimatter _ex nihilo_ so far as I know (e=mc squared in reverse...),
and no real world process can ever be 100% efficient, antimatter must
be considered to be an energy _storage_ system (like a battery) rather
than an energy source.  So, a "reasonable" return is not one which gives
more energy than it consumes, but one which allows you to retain enough
of the input energy to make the convenience (?) of using antimatter
worthwhile.

Now, if you are playing in the Spinward Marches, the Ancients apparently 
used a planet sized chunk of antimatter to bombard the plant which created
the Shionthy Belt in the Regina subsector, and loose chunks of it are still
floating around...energy storage, but over a rather longer period of time.

Hi All.  This is for you physics types.  I was thinking about some
alternate settings for Traveller, and I\'ve come up with a few questions
about antimatter.

1. Why is antimatter such a difficult source of energy to develop (i.e.,
according to the Traveller background)?  We can produce very tiny amounts
of anti-matter now, and contain it.  It seems like a simple matter to
allow it to annihilate with normal matter and harness the energy.  Is it
simply a matter of producing sufficient quantities?
 ----

It\'s a matter of producing sufficient quantities in an economic manner.

 ----
2. Does producing antimatter use up more energy than it can potentially
return?  How likely is it that one could develop an efficient-enough
production technique to yeild reasonable returns (i.e., is this a 21st
century concept, or a 21st millenium concept?)?
 ----

Yep, you can\'t get something for nothing!
The last time this topic came up several methods of producing antimatter 
were mentioned.
 - Particle accelerators (as used today)
 - mucking about with damper fields and stuff to somehow make it
 - producing primordal particles which decay in such a way that they produce 
antimatter.

 ----
3. How likely is one to find large amounts of antimatter in
space?  If a system were made of anti-matter, would we know it?  Could
there be large amounts of "dark" antimatter out there?
 ----

Not likely. If there were we should see where they mix, which we don\'t, so 
there isn\'t much out there.

 ----
4. This one is a bit psycho:  If there were a collapsed anti-matter
object (black hole, neutron star, etc.), would it have different
qualities than the same sort of normal matter object?  What if a normal
matter black hole smacks into an antimatter black hole (do you get a
galaxy-cracking explosion, or just a more massive black hole?)?
 ----

The difference is that it would be made of antimatter.
In fact black hole\'s absorb antimatter all the time, which is the mechanism 
that produces Hawking radiation (black holes aren\'t perfectly black you 
see).
If the collision reduces the mass of the resulting black hole to the extent 
that it isn\'t massive enough to be a black hole any more then it will 
explode, releasing all the remaining mass as energy (some of which will 
probably turn back into particles again).

 ----
5. Aside from the particles having opposite charges, what are the
properties of antimatter?  Does it follow the same rules for gravity,
electromagnetism and so on?
 ----

Yep, exactly the same except for the products of certain particle decays 
which produce more matter than antimatter, which is apparently how we ended 
up with more matter than antimatter in our universe.

If there\'s enough interest, I might be in position to run a small TCS 
campaign game. It would make good background for my club game. I\'ll look out 
my notes over the weekend and see if it\'s worth doing. If I do run such a 
game, it will be small fleet units (no monitors or BATRONS here) and, in 
some cases, individual ships.

If anyone is interested, mail me directly (dave.elrick@ps.co.uk) and we\'ll 
see what level of interest there is. This is a work account, I won\'t get 
back to you until Monday or Tuesday at the earliest.

If we run the game, you will definitely need:

     subsector maps and pre-Rebellion world UPPs
     High Guard (second printing) - or first printing and the tables from

you will also find useful:

     any of the CT-era alien modules
     Fighting ships

To contain the antimatter you need a magnetic "bottle", and to maintain the 
bottle you need great quantities of energy, thus to contain antimatter in the

bottle is very expensive, and very dangerous too :) , until the moment we
don`t 
have an efficient source of energy , and we won`t have it in a near future.

There is no posibility, in space there is no vacuum, there is tiny quantities
of 
Hydrogen and interstellar dust and if you have antimatter there (BOOM) ;) .

The laws of physics are the same, the only difference of the antimatter is to

have the spin changed, i.e. electron(spin 1/2) antielectron(spin -1/2), and i

told you in the point 3 that there is no antimatter free in the space.

I repeat the same, the difference is in the spin and the laws of physics are 
UNIVERSAL.

I hope that those ideas are useful to you , i tried to be easy to understand,
if 
you want an answer more precise, i can try to give you.

The cloud of sand will have an effect on an energy weapon or laser
simply because it is (effectively) a few mm to a few cm of "rock" in
the way. The particle seperation doesn\'t matter, what matters is the
total thickness of the particles in the way. 

That\'s why you can\'t see very far thru smoke. It\'s composed of
particles, and if there\'s very much smoke between you and what you are
looking at, you have enough particles to add up to an opaque layer. 

With plasma weapons, you are dealing with something thaty is more like
a "spread out" particle beam than anything else.

Whoa! The mechanism for Hawking radiation *doesn\'t* work that way.
What\'s happening is that virtual particle pair are constantly being
created everywhere. They are always a particle and its anti-particle.
They quickly recombine and the energy involved exists for such a short
period that Heisenberg uncertianity allows the temporary violation of
conservation of energy. 

Near a black hole, one of the particles (it doesn\'t *matter* whetether
its the "normal" one or the "antimatter" one) is likely to cross the
event horizon. That means that when the time allowed by the uncertainty
principle is up, there\'s missing energy. So the result is that the
*non*-trapped particle continues on its way, and the black hole loses
that much mass.

Black holes also only have a *limited* set of properties. Mass, charge,
and angular momentum. There is no such thing as a "matter" or
"antimatter" black hole. If you create a 1 ton black hole from matter,
and another 1 ton black hole from antimatter, there\'d be no way to tell
which was which. And if they collided, the result would be a 2-ton
black hole. 

If you want a "reasonable" (but wrong) picture of this, consider that
if the matter and antimatter *did* still exist inside the holes, when
they reacted, they\'d produce energy. Which, being particles and
photons, can\'t get out!

Remember, shining a laser into a black hole simply increases its
mass...

As for the related topic of how to get a "super-terrestrial" planet (ie
something made of the same materials as planets like mercury, Venus,
earth, Mars, etc) but *much* bigger (ie small gas giant size or more),
I\'d have to say that it might be possible. But it\'d be *very* rare. 

The problem is that anything that accumulates that much "rocky"
material is going to collect even *more* "icy" material since that kind
of stuff is much more common in the clouds that planets and stars form
from. 

The terrestrial planets have so little "icy" material because the sun
"baked" it out of them. And Jupiter gladly glommed onto much of the
baked-out stuff that was swept by it on the solar wind.

I can\'t see *how* to get something that big in near enough to a star
to have the gases baked off. I *will* say this. If there *is* such a
planet in the system, there\'s not likely to be much else. 

One possibility is that it was a "brown dwarf" in "close" orbit around a
star that went supernova. Of course, that means the main star is a
white dwarf or a neutron star... oh well...

-Second, there is no "antimatter" in the concept that you call matter, i.e. 
you haven`t a brick and an antibrick, what you have is antiparticles, that

for example, but they have the same mass  and the rest of properties he

is the same. The reason because we don`t have antimatter is that i said you 
yesterday, there is no absolute vacuum in the space. 

-Third, the problem to contain the antimatter  is that you have to avoid 
that the antiparticle crash with the matter to achieve this, in the 20th 
Century we are using electromagnetic fields to repulse the particles  and 
to contain it in magnetic \'bottles\', but this consumes a lot of energy, add 
this the lot of energy to produce antimatter, and the lot of energy to 
accelerate the antimatter, you need that they collide where you want that 
it happens to can receive the photons in you detector( and try to convert

don`t count the energy lost in the control systems, the facilities, the 
energy lost due to the heating of the circuits, etc, etc; we suppose that 
in the Traveller universe using grav technology( i remember you that 
antimatter has mass) the scientists can contain the antimatter in a way  
more effectice and cheap, and they obtain more energy that they spend in 
the process.

N.B.: a black hole is a star \'collapsed\', a dead star, to have an 
antiblackhole  you would need an antistar and an antistar is made of 
antiatoms, a lot of anti\'s i think, and if you remember the second point 
there is no absolute vacuum in the space and when an antiparticle is 
created,  it is inmediately anhilitaded by a particle.

 Actually, it would be a matter (no pun intended) of _containing_
 the stuff - and that would be more important than being able to
 make it.  When I was about 8 years old, I thought that antimatter
 oxygen would only react with "promatter" (our stuff) oxygen; the
 book I was reading wasn\'t clear on that.  In reality, as you know,
 _any_ antimatter coming into contact with _any_ promatter will
 cause a nasty reaction.

 Now, you\'re going to carry this stuff around with you - how?  You
 can\'t build something out of promatter to attach your antimatter
 to; it will just cause a lot of pretty (and deadly) fireworks.
 You need fields that have all of the properties of matter except
 for the physicality - and they have to be not only airtight, but
 totally anything-tight; even a promatter neutrino coming into
 contact with your antimatter will cause a spark.

 Conversion from promatter/antimatter to energy is one hundred
 (100.000000000) percent efficient.  Using totally unrealistic
 numbers, if the total annihilation of a single electron produces
 one joule of energy, then if it takes less than two joules of
 energy to create your antimatter electron _and_ capture into your
 fuel tanks you promatter electron, then you\'re ahead of the game.
 I\'d tend to think that it\'s probably not a XXIc concept, but
 should certainly be possible well before the CCXc.  Canon seems to
 imply that it\'s not possible in the LVIIc, but that it\'s not that
 many tech levels ahead.

 I\'d consider finding the stuff a doubtful proposition, regardless
 of the probabilities of its existence.  Antimatter has to exist
 pretty much in total isolation from promatter, otherwise you\'ll
 get reactions - and probably detectable ones, even with
 present-day technologies.  Some authors of speculative
 counterfactual literature have suggested the possibilities of the
 existence of entire antimatter galaxies, but the general consensus
 seems to be that they\'re not going to naturally coexist in the
 same galactic region.

 Our best information indicates that the electromagnetic and
 gravitic properties of antimatter and promatter are identical.
 The only difference seems to be in charge and spin.  The black
 hole question is a bit harder:  The definition of a black hole
 requires an escape velocity that is in excess of the speed of
 propagation of light \\in vacuo\\.  That implies that there would be
 no galaxy-cracking explosion when a promatter black hole and an
 antimatter black hole come together.  However, we usually discuss
 black holes in terms of mass density - and there would be no mass
 left afterwards.  It would all be converted to energy.  So where
 does the energy go?  The spectacular answer is that it goes
 nowhere until enough mass has been annihilated to bring the
 combined mass below the limit for a self-sustaining black hole,
 and then BLOOEY!  But, you still have the problem of where the
 energy goes _until_ the blooey point.

 More likely, IMO, is that where we talk of mass density for a
 black hole, or for any astrographic body, we should be talking
 about mass-energy density.  In which case, the total m-e density
 in the collision of a promatter hole and an antimatter hole would
 remain unchanged, and all you\'d get is a bigger hole.

Because when Traveller was written (in the 70\'s), the understanding of
antimatter (particularly by game writers) was considerably less than
it is now?  It\'s one of those quirks that populate the Classic Traveller
universe.

Not *exactly*, Jeff ...

Antimatter only reacts with matter particles of the same type: in other
words, an anti-neutrino will only react with the exact same type of
normal-matter neutrino.  Anti-electrons (positrons) react with electrons,
and anti-protons with protons, and so on.  Anti-protons aren\'t hard to make
(as antimatter goes), and are charged.  They *will* react with most objects
made of matter - because the nucleus of every atom contains protons.

Containing antimatter isn\'t quite as hard as you make out - *if* the
antimatter particles have a charge, they can be contained electromagnetically
just like any other type of subatomic particle.  You can use an airtight
containment vessel (made out of normal matter) to hold the vacuum, and inside
that have an electromagnetic container so that the antimatter doesn\'t escape
to hit the walls of the container.

Various clever designs have been developed for just this purpose; Dr. Robert
L. Forward mentions several that have been proposed in his book _Future
Magic_.  It\'s worth noting that current high-energy phsyics research centers
currently produce and store antimatter as part of their experimental
programs.  As a sweeping generalization, any technology that could contain
and maintain a fusion reaction for power generation could probably have no
trouble containing and controlling an antimatter reaction.

> X::>2. Does producing antimatter use up more energy than it can potentially
>  ::>return?

Yes.  Physics tells us that we cannot possible gain more energy from an
antimatter reaction than we used to create the antimatter.  The realities of
engineering are than nothing is 100% efficient, so producing antimatter will
require more energy than we could extract from an antimatter reaction.

On the other hand, antimatter does have the possibility of storing the most
energy in the smallest amount of "fuel" - you can\'t beat the energy density.
So at some point in the future, antimatter might be exploited as an energy
storage medium.

>  ::>How likely is it that one could develop an efficient-enough
>  ::>production technique to yeild reasonable returns

Dr. Robert L. Forward, in his book _Future Magic_ makes an argument to the
effect that for certain applications, antimatter could be a viable energy
storage medium for the forseeable (sometime in the 21st Century) future.

>  Conversion from promatter/antimatter to energy is one hundred

Several problems come to mind: depending on the antiparticles invloved, the
reaction emits a lot of it\'s energy in non-useful forms (such as neutrinos
or other difficult-to-capture particles).  In practice, the amount of useful
energy that\'s available for extraction from an antimatter reaction is (in
*really* round numbers) between 33% and 66%, depending mainly on the types
of particles involved in the reaction.  On top of that, you\'ll have to
factor in the losses by the energy-extraction mechanism, and any energy
required for containment of the reaction itself.

This is, however, a much more efficient reaction that fusion (which converts
about 0.1% of the mass involved into energy) and fission (about 0.01%).

> X::>3. How likely is one to find large amounts of antimatter in

If there were antimatter stars nearby, then some proportion of the primary
cosmic radiation would consist of antiparticles.  This hasn\'t been detected,
so we can assume that there are no nearby antimatter stars.  If there were
antimatter planets, nebulas, gas clouds, or other "dark" matter, the matter
in cosmic radiation (which pervades space) or solar wind (if there was a
nearby star) would react with the antimatter to produce all sorts of
interesting (and detectable) radiation.  Since no signs of these reactions
have been detected, it\'s been estimated that there are no significant
deposits of antimatter within our galaxy, and there are probably none in
nearby galaxies.

>  ::>If a system were made of anti-matter, would we know it?

Yes, from light-years away.

>  Could there be large amounts of "dark" antimatter out there?

Not in a galaxy with predominantly normal-matter stars.  They wouldn\'t be
dark, but would be lit up due to radiation from matter-antimatter reactions
with cosmic radiation and solar wind (as appropriate).

The properties of antiparticles which we\'ve been able to produce (which
includes anti-electrons and anti-protons, and probably more by now) have
been pretty-well investigated, and found to be "as expected" (the reason it\'s
so well-checked is that *if* there was a difference, there\'d probably be a
Nobel prize in it for someone ...)

Too bad Metlay doesn\'t monitor this list; he could probably answer this
better than I could (and fix the errors that probably exist in the above).

who replied.  Some of the information was a little contradictory, but 
very much appreciated nonetheless.  I would like some clarification on a 
couple of points:

1.  According to many, it is impossible to get more energy out of
antimatter than one puts into creating it.  I am of course familiar with
the laws of conservation.  But one can get more energy out of a log than
one puts into it by burning it.  This is because the log contains energy
which is released by a chemical reaction.  I guess my basic question is: 
why does it take so much energy to change the charge of a particle?  Why
does one have to put as much energy in as the mass of the whole thing,
isn\'t it just a matter of taking a mass and changing a property of it?  Or
do you have to "build" antimatter from energy?  (forgive my ignorance, I
let my subscription to "Exotic Particle Monthly" run out a year ago :-)

2. If one stores a bunch of anti-protons in a magnetic bottle, will there 
be a problem with free neutrons (i.e., radition) getting into the 
bottle?  Someone said that anti-particles will only react with the same 
sort of pro-particle, but others contradicted this.  Can I get a bit more 
input on this issue?  I realize that neutrinoes and such would not be a 
problem, as they would have low interaction probabilities anyway, and 
would only "use up" minute amounts of the antimatter anyway, but what 
about heavier particles?  You could sheild out any charged particles, so 
I\'m mainly worried about neutral ones.

3. If one allows anti-protons to react with normal protons, how much of 
the energy is released as waste neutrinoes and other "uncatchable" 
particles?  If I allow the whole mechanism of anti-matter plant to 
convert 10% of mass to useful energy is that unrealistic?  Fusion\'s .1% 
conversion, correct?  So this would be 100 times better.

Producing it for a net energy gain would require extremely high 
technology (it is theoretically allowed - see below). Todays production 
methods are wholly unfeasible for any sort of sensible use never mind the 
storage problems. For example CERN (Centre of European Particle Physics) 
takes as much power as the entire canton of Geneva and has probably never 
even produced a gram of anti-matter over it\'s entire history (just over 
40 years).

No - for example positrons have electric charge and therefore will INTERACT 
with ALL charged particles irrespective of type. Positrons will only 
ANNHILIATE with other electrons however for protons/anti-protons and 
neutron/anti-neutrons things are a lot more complicated since they are 
each made up of 3 quarks (or anti-quarks) and so and anti-proton can 
partially annhilate with a neutron and vice versa.

Yes it is! Electromagnetic containment works but is limited to extremely 
small amounts of anti-matter and it also has a limited life time since it\'s 
not possible to create a perfect vacuum so some will interact with air.

Yes we do BUT only for small quantities for small amounts of time.

I very much doubt this since fusion reactions generate a few MeV. A 
proton/anti-proton reaction will generate a few 100 Mev.

Depends on how you produce it! With current technology the answer is an 
emphatic yes - LOTS. However in theory at least there is no reason why we 
can\'t take a lump of normal matter and convert it into anti-matter. All 
the fundamental conservation laws are satisfied - charge, energy, 
momentum. The problem is that conservation of things called \'lepton 
number\' and \'baryon number\' are violated. Lepton number, for ordinary 
matter, is essentially the number of electron minus the number of 
positrons whereas baryon number is the number of protons and neutrons 
minus the number of anti-neutrons and anti-protons, again only for normal 
matter.

Theorists tell us that at extremely high energies these number 
conservation laws are violated - in fact our existence is good proof of 
this since we are made of protons, neutrons and electrons so, assuming 
the universe started in the Big Bang, something must have generated 
particles and not anti-partciles.

Because of this difference between matter and anti-matter it MAY be 
possible to build a machine to exploit this and convert particles into 
anti-particles but knowing there is such a difference is a long, long way 
from exploiting it. In fact the whole process is on very dodgy ground 
theoretically, nevermind experimentally, but heck this is science FICTION!

electromagnetic and gravity) they are thought to be (and to within 
measurements they are) the same but there IS a difference between matter 
and anti-matter for the weak force!

If you look at the decays of neutral kaons (a types of mesons made from a 
strange and a down quark) then you see a difference between matter and 
anti-matter. The clearest example of this is that the two decays:

	KL -> Pi+ Mu- Nubar

and 	KL -> Pi- Mu+ Nu

(Pi= pion, Mu=muon, Nu=muon neutrino. Pi+/-, Mu+/- and Nu/Nubar are 
particle/antiparticle pairs.)

occur with a difference frequency. This means that Pi- are produced more 
often than Pi+, for example, and so the weak force (which is responsible 
for this decay) sees some difference between them. The exactly mechanism 
as to why is not known, although several theories exist. In fact the 
experiment I\'m working on at CERN is currently trying to discover the 
mechanism behind this effect so hang around a few years and we may find out!

There was - in 1964 Cronin, Fitch and Turlay discovered the effect 
mentioned above and won the Nobel prize some years later.

  Actually your description fits perfectly into a not-too-unlikely
scenario.
  As you say, anything with that much terrestrial matter also
attracts that much icy matter and generally ends up looking like
a gas giant. So far so good.
  Most main-sequence stars go through a red-giant phase where
they swell up. Their surface expands outwards to about orbit
3 or 4 on average and (I think) their overall output increases.
  Gas Giants in orbit 4 or 5 are going to be rather buffeted for
a few milllion years by a bad case of solar wind. I conjecture that
this would "blow away" a lot of its icy material.
  When the star has done its thing it shrinks back down. You get
a dim star and a core of a gas giant.
  Does this fit the bill?
  You might play around generating a normal system. Then change
the central star type to a red giant. Use the luminosity and
stellar radius tables (only in Classic Book 6?) to recompute
the stars radius and output. Check this against the systems
in orbit. Lastly recompute the star back to something at the
end of the main sequence.
  I don\'t know exactly what you would get. From my knowledge
of stellar physics (of which, admittedly, 50% come from gaming)
you may end up with the "super-terrestrial" body.
  Since Gas Giants are frequent (in Traveller Generation) and
Main Sequence stars go through the above steps, it might not
be as uncommon as you think.
  Any astrophysicists got a better notion?

It\'s not that bad for starship-sized chunks.  Out at the Main Belt, the
escape velocity from the Solar System isn\'t much over a G-turn.  A decent
sized, properly braced ship shouldn\'t have too much trouble putting a
small rock, possibly larger than the ship, on a free trajectory to just
about anyplace, especially if it hangs around to make the occasional
course correction.  The only question is how much fuel you\'re willing
to burn, how long you\'re willing to wait for delivery, and whether the
ship making the delivery needs to leave the rock while it buzzes ahead
to get some more fuel.  You might want to make sure that your claim is
properly staked and that you\'ve cleared your trajectory with the local
traffic control center, too.

Babylon 5\'s psi-corp gives an excellent example of a slightly more open
psionic society than is allowed in the Imperium. Certainly such a person
would be \'encouraged\' to join a special branch of the local Imperial
administration. Naturally this is actually a branch of military
intelligence. Needless to say, refusal to join will result in
persecution/death (accidental, of course...). Joiners who don\'t meet the
grade will also be \'disposed of\'. Those who show high psionic talents will
be trained for military and/or intelligence purposes and become one of the
most secret and highly guarded assets in the Imperium services.

I stand corrected (the last time I read up on this stuff was some 12 years

Although if there were a crushing need for it, a production facility could
probably be built for antimatter that would be considerably more efficient
that the current research facilities.

In other words, it would be mostly unfeasable for any sort of sensible use,
as opposed to wholly unfeasable.  ;-)

That was me :-)
Mesons are a combination of a quark and an anti-quark. Since there are 6 
types of quark and each pair can be combined in different angular 
momentum states this gives a lot of different mesons

> Why not?  

Because they interact with matter to produce showers of particles. The 
experiment I work on is essentially a large meson gun (type K :-) which 
produces two beams of Kaons (symbol K!). These decay to pions (another 
type of meson)

> How massive are they compared to say a neutron?  

Depends on the type. The lightest eg. pion, are about a tenth the mass of 
a neutron whereas the heavier ones discovered eg. B0 are about five times 
heavier than a neutron.

> If you moved them up close to C, couldn\'t

Yes, for example the fraction left after travelling a distance X through 
iron is:
	Fraction = exp(-X/0.176)      (X in metres)
(note that this is independent of the particle\'s energy)

but this is the same for protons and neutrons. Essentially any particle 
accelerator is as effective as a meson gun. The claims made in Traveller 
that they will \'sail through a planet and then decay\' are complete 
rubbish. Anything that did that would not be a meson.

Depends on the meson. Generally the bigger the meson, the shorter the 
lifetime and the bigger the energy released. The energy will always be 
less than the mass of the particle and so will be insignificant compared 
to the energy you need to accelerate it to.

    'body' => 'Charles inquires further about anti-matter

I had refrained so far from entering the arena but will do so now..
(just to complement Roger Moore who, to be fair, covered much of the same )

1. antimatter is more than just a different charge. However this description
is not so far from truth for electrons and muons that are leptons ie light
and as far as we know elementary. Note that anti-neutrinos exist and are
different from neutrinos even though the neutrino has no charge. Anti-leptons
also have the lepton number reversed, not only the charge (by they way
there are also three brands of neutrinos commonly known as flavors).
For baryons, ie. protons and neutrons things are different since they are
composed particles. In high energy collisions between protons and antiprotons
often it is only a pair of quarks that anihilates leaving the remaining
four quarks do their business (which often means make mesons).
Indeed one makes antimatter out of energy, unless you have a magnetic
monopole and the laws of physics are about right to allow neutron-antineutron
catalysis (we do not know but looks unlikely).
On the other hand if you have mangetic monopoles either you are terribly
lucky or energy is not a problem for you..
Despite this if you could make anti-matter with more than 50 per cent
efficiency you would be well off since am would anihilate with ordinary
matter which you get for free.

2. magnetic containment is a tricky business but it can be done. The
problem is that of scale. At CERN they have been able to store something like
200 anti-protons for a couple of months..this is not what you would like..
Neutrons can be shielded relatively easily, getting a reall good vacuum
is more of a problem. Also one needs the antiproton beam to be really
cold, that is achievbed by the so-called stochastic cooling and also by
electron cooling if I am not mistaken. The trick is to cool it
down something you cannot touch (note that electrons can touch anti-protons
relatively safely). Perhaps Roger has more recent information on this.

3. I haven\'t any paper at hand to asnwer what is the typical fraction of
energy lost to neutrinos. I would not expect it to be large. However
even mesons (esp. the neutral ones) would be copiously produced and are then
you\'d need  a large shield to catch them before they escape with your energy.

Extra question. Mesons are particles made of two quarks, not to be confused
with muons that have no quarks since they are leptons.
Mesons can have quite a variety of masses, from 140 MeV (280 times 
the electron mass, but 1 seventh of the proton mass) to much heavier masses
when they include exotic quarks. The problem of the meson gun is not to
make it but to gain something out  of it. With just one particle it wouldn\'t
work since you would be releasing more energy in your ship (production 
efficiency of the mesons plus exponential decay) than in the opponent ship).
If you start using double decay meson guns, i.e. neutral mesons decaying into
charged mesons you could gain something. I doubt it would really work [but
it is fun to play!].

Since neutrons and protons are made of the same kinds of quarks (up and down)
anti protons can partially anihilate with neutrons.

Finally, on "natural" anti-matter sources. The astronomical upper limits on
anti-matter are quite tight. If there is any "nearby" it is probably so
far anyway that if you could reach it you wouldn\'t need it. This is
different for positrons. Even in our galaxy there is a source, known
as the Great Anihilator, that every now and then annihilates a few billions
tons of positrons in a nice flash that we can detected by observing gamma
emission peaked at 511 KeV. Standard models for pulsars and active
nuclei predict the existence of positron-electron atmospheres where the
number of e-p anihilating is compensated by the number freshly made by
hard radiation. instabilities are possible (ie the Compton catastrophe) and
one ends up with lots of gamma rays. I am not sure I would volunteer
to go and fetch them...

How is the 0.176 arrived at?  

Could you post some sample values for this for different materials if
you\'ve got \'em (or even how you calculate a pion cross section for a
given nucleus (first order would be fine).

I played with changing it based on the different weightings of Fe, and
soils, BSD armor, and such.  Looks like getting through a couple meters
of armor, or several 10s of meters of soil wouldn\'t be a problem, but
the fraction for even 1km was on the order of 10^-8 :-)  

Deep sites ain\'t so deep.  

Any pointers would be great.

	while most of the important points regarding anti-matter have 
already been discussed, there are still a few points to make;
storing antimatter is certainly not easy - however, with grav technology,
and superconducting magnets available, it might be feasable. you\'ve 
probably all heard about that superconducting magnet that was kept 
suspended for years thanks to its own magnetic field. also, while 
electro-magnetic fields won\'t affect neutral particles, keep in mind that
gravity fields will.
and certainly there are powerful such fields available, since that is 
supposedly how SD materials are made.(I am more comfortable blaming that 
on magnetic monopoles, but that\'s just my own opinion..)
and shielding antimatter from neutrons shouldn\'t be too difficult - 
you have superdense materials that will even reflect a few neutrinos 
(Starship Ops Manual). not that free neutrons are that common, since they
decay in about 11 minutes..

as for energy efficiency - when annihilation occurs the result is gamma-rays.
however, due to the high intensities, these gammas can produce other 
particles (which is where the losses might occur). However, recall that 
at TL-15 you can muck around with interaction probabilities as a result of 
mastering the strong and weak nuclear forces. perhaps you could increase 
your efficiency that way? 

when it comes to coverting matter into anti-matter - you are violating 
several conservation laws there. some beleive that such laws are violated at 
high energies - but then you need to get these high energies. I would imagine 
that is why you\'d need a powerful accelerator or some such... 

But why bother with all this messy anti-matter? You can use a black hole 
to get 100% matter-to-energy conversion thanks to hawking radiation. 
this was brought up a few months ago on this list - but the basics are this:
a small black hole will "evaporate" due to hawking radiation at rate that 
increases as the mass of the hole decreases. if you feed the black hole 
matter at the rate at which it is radiating, it will never stop radiating.
of course there are drawbacks - the black hole has to be on the order of 
10^15 grams, if you stop "feeding" it it will radiate away all its energy 
and explode in your face, and finally if you accidentially drop in into 
a star or planet - well, that\'s just too bad for that star or planet... 
but the pluses are this - 100% conversion and a great way to annoy your 
enemies.

On another matter - someone asked about mesons. they have restmasses lying 
in between those of nucleons and electrons ( hence the name mesons ), which 
is on the order of a few hundred MeV. on the other hand they are travelling 
VERY (0.999999+ c)
close to the speed of light (they have to since they don\'t last very 
long - you need a HUGE time-dilation in order for them to go anywhere)
so they have a lot of energy.. 
it is true that they will not penetrate normal matter without interacting -
since mesons contain quarks they interact with nuclei. typical penetration 
depths of neutral pions would be on the order of centimetres. 
however, they deposit all their energy in that distance - which makes for 
a great weapon. just not one you can shoot through planets with.
Now, if you like the idea of such a gun ( and I think deep meson sites are cool) you can always wave your hands and say that at TL-13 or so it becomes possible to create a co-moving (ie one that moves with the mesons) strong nuclear field that prevents meson-nuclei interactions.. or something equally sci-fi...
hope this helps..

Whoa! The mechanism for Hawking radiation *doesn\'t* work that way.
What\'s happening is that virtual particle pair are constantly being

period that Heisenberg uncertianity allows the temporary violation of
conservation of energy.

Near a black hole, one of the particles (it doesn\'t *matter* whetether

that much mass.

Ah, that explaination works _much_ better than the previous one I\'d read

A sort of particle ;)

  A while ago,

At "rest" about a tenth or so of a Neutron.

  If you moved them up close to C, couldn\'t
they penetrate quite a bit of matter?  How much energy does a meson
release upon decay (or is this another bit of "magic")?  Wouldn\'t you
have to get huge numbers of them into the enemy ship to do significant
damage?

If you moved them that fast most of their energy would be in their movement, 
not their mass. They would penetrate until they hit a nucleus and did what 
ever it is that they do to Nuclei. They do release a significant amout of 
energy (it is a nuclear type decay thingy.. as in nukes) upon decay. You 
would need no more than a conventional particle beam.

One thing that annoys me about Meson Guns is the assumption that all the 
particles are going to decay at roughly the same distance. I thought that 
particles only had half-lives so mesons should decay from the muzzle 
onwards... with the intensity proportional to 1/(n^distance).

No - for example positrons have electric charge and therefore will INTERACT
with ALL charged particles irrespective of type. Positrons will only
ANNHILIATE with other electrons however for protons/anti-protons and
neutron/anti-neutrons things are a lot more complicated since they are
each made up of 3 quarks (or anti-quarks) and so and anti-proton can
partially annhilate with a neutron and vice versa.

 ----

What about positrons colliding with Neutrons and producing Protons, (the 
reverse of Beta decay where a Neutron emits an electron and becomes a 
Proton)?

 ----
All
the fundamental conservation laws are satisfied - charge, energy,
momentum. The problem is that conservation of things called \'lepton
number\' and \'baryon number\' are violated. Lepton number, for ordinary
matter, is essentially the number of electron minus the number of
positrons whereas baryon number is the number of protons and neutrons
minus the number of anti-neutrons and anti-protons, again only for normal
matter.

Theorists tell us that at extremely high energies these number
conservation laws are violated - in fact our existence is good proof of
this since we are made of protons, neutrons and electrons so, assuming
the universe started in the Big Bang, something must have generated
particles and not anti-partciles.

Because of this difference between matter and anti-matter it MAY be
possible to build a machine to exploit this and convert particles into
anti-particles but knowing there is such a difference is a long, long way
from exploiting it. In fact the whole process is on very dodgy ground
theoretically, nevermind experimentally, but heck this is science FICTION!

NO!

For 3 out of 4 of the fundamental forces of nature (strong,
electromagnetic and gravity) they are thought to be (and to within
measurements they are) the same but there IS a difference between matter
and anti-matter for the weak force!
 ----

Which is what "Nuclear Dampers" are supposed to muck about with....

 ----
If you look at the decays of neutral kaons (a types of mesons made from a
strange and a down quark) then you see a difference between matter and
anti-matter. The clearest example of this is that the two decays:

        KL -> Pi+ Mu- Nubar

and     KL -> Pi- Mu+ Nu

(Pi= pion, Mu=muon, Nu=muon neutrino. Pi+/-, Mu+/- and Nu/Nubar are
particle/antiparticle pairs.)

occur with a difference frequency. This means that Pi- are produced more
often than Pi+, for example, and so the weak force (which is responsible
for this decay) sees some difference between them. The exactly mechanism
as to why is not known, although several theories exist. In fact the
experiment I\'m working on at CERN is currently trying to discover the
mechanism behind this effect so hang around a few years and we may find out!

This was the particle decay I refered to in my response but there exists the 
possibility of more such symmetry breaking stuff at higher energy levels.
I also heard the above decay is handy for describing Left and Right to 
Aliens that don\'t have any other common reference ;)

I don\'t think people just "become psionic". Normally you have
to get training from the Psionic Institute, or, more generally,
someone with existing psionic abilities. Even the Zhodani got their
initial exposure to psionics from Droyne they found on the moon of
their homeworld (or even right on Zhdant, I forget). The only mention
of "natural" psionic abilities are the Droyne and those silly monkey-like
things on Psyadi, mentioned in The Traveller Adventure.

Also, I was wondering, towards the Rim, where no one has probably
ever seen a real psionic and the worlds have been Solomani pretty
much forever, would people even believe in psionics? Imperials with
any sense of history would know about the psionic supressions and
the destruction of the psi. institute, but most Solomani would 
probably dismiss the idea of psionics as "Imperial nonsense", wouldn\'t
they?

You\'ve hit on one of the big problems with making someone\'s
status a crime.  Would a very honest Jew in Germany in 1939
who happened not to have been swept up just report for
transport?  Would a very honest gay soldier in the U.S. 
military before the current don\'t-ask-don\'t-tell just tell 
his CO?  Would a very honest Serb, Bosnian, Azerbaijani, 
Armenian, Kurd, Khmer .... you get the idea.

The actual answer to your question, of course, varies with
location.  It seems to me that _Imperial_ law doesn\'t
outlaw psionics (but I should look that up), but local law
does everywhere because of the Imperially supported
Psionics Suppressions.  So if the very honest psion is
living in a place like Nazi Germany, the authorities will
have a final solultion for his or her problem.  Other 
places might very prescribe treatment.  Some may deport, or 
urge immigration to the Zhodani Consulate (issues of 
Imperial emigration law arise, yes).  You know, it depends.

This would make a good plot for a novel, too.  >>Als
Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Traumen erwachte,
fand er sich in seinem Bett zu ein ungeheueres Psychischer
verwandelt.<<

So Citizen Samsa learns to his shock and horror that he
has great psionic powers.  When?  Maybe as early as the day
in first grade that he gives the school bully a bloody
nose just by wishing it. Maybe the day in his early teens
he pleads with his family to please stop shouting into his
mind at some stressful family holiday gathering.  

The Psionics Institute might hear of this and take an
interest in young Citizen Samsa and provide a shepherd to
guide him through the maze of life in straight society
(always called "deadheads" in my universe by psionics and
Zhodani) with a bent mind.  That won\'t produce a very
honest citizen, so let\'s change the story.

Young Citizen Samsa suppresses his psionics at the strong
encouragement of his terrified parents, but, becoming
alienated from his true nature, develops into a juvenile
delinquent who eventually lashes out....  No, wait, let\'s
tell _your_ story.

Young Citizen Samsa suppresses his psionics once he
becomes aware of them because he\'s able to spot the clues
in society that show what\'s ok behavior and what isn\'t. 
He grows into adulthood, does his education and military
service, gets a decent job, marries per the customs of his
homeworld, etc.  

Everything is ok, except, once in a while, he can\'t help
but hear his spouse\'s thoughts about her ex, or the boss\'s
perverse obsession with another staffer\'s child, and, to
deal with it, he goes a little nuts.  Just a little.  Like
going for a drink after and work and finding himself in a
cab with a professional companion laughing at his nausea
at 4 a.m.  Like spending all weekend so totally
reorganizing his house that no one can find anything
anymore.  Like sitting in his office holding his head in
his hands and feeling such pain and fear that he wishes he
were somewhere else -- anywhere -- and finding himself
skidding to a stop in his old room in his mom\'s house, half
a world away.

(A) Then Citizen Samsa can\'t stand it anymore and he tries
suicide which puts him into the hands of a psychotherapist
(like in The Lathe of Heaven by LeGuin).  The
psychotherapist figures out the problem -- it\'s no doubt
gotten into the textbooks in the 300 years since the
Psionics Suppressions -- and (1) calls the authorities
(see my earlier posting on this subject); (2) calls the
Psionics Institute (only on a 12+, DM +1 if pop B+, etc.);
(3) prescribes a course of therapy to (a) minimize the
psychic disruptions caused by suppression of psionic powers
and (b) empower Citizen Samsa to deal with it and get a
life, or (4) some combination of (1), (2), (3).  

-or-

(B) Then Citizen Samsa can\'t stand it anymore and he tries
suicide, which wakes him up.  He goes to the authorities,
who are dumbfounded at first that the violator of an
offense that hasn\'t been prosecuted in 300 years would turn
himself in, but, like authorities, they think better safe
than sorry:  "\'You can\'t go out, you are arrested.\'  "So it
seems,\' said K.  \'But what for?\' he added.  \'We are not
authorized to tell you that.\'"  Then, maybe, like Joseph
K, Citizen Samsa is "\'under arrest, certainly, but that
need not hinder [him] from going about [his] business\'",
especially if that business is as important to the state as
working at the bank or an insurance company.  

Or maybe they put hiim into a mental institution because
he\'s exhibiting delusional behavior -- thinking he can read
minds and teleport.  Or maybe they torture him until he
signs a release donating himself to a research facility.
Or maybe they prosecute him for "using an enumerated
psionic capability, as defined in Regina Penal Code sec.
15004, to wit, telepathy", and send him to jail for 20
years or until another prisoner kills him because psis are
lower in the prison hierarchy than child molesters.  Or
maybe they send him to the psychotherapist -- see above.
Or maybe they try to get him to emigrate to the Zhodani
Consulate, who are probably the only people who can help
him at this point in his life, but who may not want the
burden.  

Or maybe the case becomes known, and takes on a life of
its own.  The Ine Givar start a campaign of terrorism and
litigation to get him released, and use him in their
propaganda as an example of Imperial oppression.  The
hard-line anti-psionics people (how many of them are there
by the 1100s IE? I would guess as many as hard line
abolitionists around in 1995 CE.  We\'re all abolitionists 
now.  Oh, you\'re a slave owner?  Well, you\'ll have to start 
paying your slaves the minimum wage now.  No, we won\'t send 
you to jail.  We haven\'t done that in -- how long?) want to 
kill him.  The criminal defense bar wants his due process 
rights protected, like any other criminal.  Etc. 

Again, it depends on the world at which he goes to the
authorities.  How does that culture deal with those far
outside certain norms?

This could be a fun one to role-play.  One player playing 
the psionic and the referee playing all the authorities?  
One member of a group of adventurers playing the psionic, 
the others playing his possibly former friends -- "He\'s 
what! a telepath! and we spent how long together in that 
crashed cutter waiting for rescue?  I\'ll never be able to 
take enough showers to feel clean again!"?  The referee 
playing the psionic and the players playing the various 
authorities?

Hmmm.

Yes, it\'s Imperial law: I forgot which Emperess, though.  The Psionic 
Suppression orders were issued about 600.

Someone here (sorry, I think I already cut out your question) asked if 
the Solomani even believe in Psionics, never mind prohibit it.  Yes, they 
both know about and fear Psionics, as they were still part of the 
Imperium when the Psionic Suppression Orders were issued.

Nope, you do *not get more energy out of the log than was "put into"
it. The energy input was that required to take water, CO2, and various
minerals and turn them into wood. Believe me, the plant needed a *lot*
more energy to do this than what you get out by burning it.

You *can\'t* "change the charge" of a particle. That\'d violate a
conservation law. What you needed to do (before quarks) was "swap" the
charge between some particles, while at the same time shuffling or not
shuffling other conserved properties. But as noted in another article
"baryon number" and "lepton number" conservation made that unworkable.

Now that quarks are known, it gets easier to explain. Everything that
has a baryon number turns out to be made of quarks. Everything with a
lepton number turns out to be made of leptons. And there\'s no way to
turn a lepton into a quark, or vice versa.

So a proton consists of three quarks (I forget which ones) one of each
of the three "colors" (red, green & blue). An antiproton consists of
three quarks as well, but with the opposite "colors".

It\'s a matter of changing *all* the properties except mass. Charge,
baryon or lepton number, spin, and several others. If one could
"change" the properties that easily, you could just convert matter
directly into energy without bothering with antimatter.

Bingo! You "split" a sufficiently energetic photon into a particle and
the corresponding antiparticle. Or otherwise supply the energy required
to generate *both particles. Then you try and use eletric and magnetic
fields to capture the antiparticles before they run into something.

The current "best" efficiency in creating antiprotons is at Fermilab,
where it takes approximately sixty million times as much energy to
generate an antiproton as you will get by annihilating it.

There aren\'t many free neutrons running around. They are easily kept
out. A neutrino *can\'t* annihilate any part of a proton or anti-proton.
It\'s purely a lepton. And a proton is purely quarks. While they can
interact, you won\'t lose anything that way. The other nuetral particles
are highly unstable and not the sort of thing that you\'ll find laying
around. 

Anti-neutrons *would* be able to react with neutrinos, because they
effectively consist of an anti-proton, a positron, and a neutrino. So
in the rare case where an anti-neutrino wandered by *and* actually
intereacted with the anti-neutron, you\'d wind up with a bit of energy,
and a positron and an anti-proton.

As I noted, the proton and antiproton are made up out of quarks. One
has quarks with red, blue and green charges, the other has ones with
anti-red, anti-blue, and anti-green charges. To understand what
happens, you have to realize that mesons are made of out of *two*
quarks, with opposite "charges (ie and anti-red and a red). 

So it\'s a lot easier to turn into mesons than to turn completely into
energy. A proton/antiproton pair will produce a bunch of mesons of the
variety called pions. On average, you\'ll get three charged pions and
two neutral pions. The neutral pions almost immediately breakdown into
gamma rays. That\'s 40% of the energy. The other 60% is in the charged
pions, which are moving at around 94% of c! So even though they are
shortlived, their life gets "stretched". They\'ll travel about 21 meters
before decaying into muons, you can extract much of the kinetic energy
from them in that distance.

The muons will travel 1.85 km before decaying into electrons and
positrons. So an antimatter rocket needs a *big* nozzle. 

There\'s good explanation of all this in "Indistinguishable from Magic"
by Robert L. Forward. ISBN 0-671-87686-4 $5.99.

Mesons, as noted are quark *pairs*, rather than triplets. They are a
few hundred times as massive as an electron. A proton is 1800 times as
massive as an electron.

And yes, they have a limited lifetime. But it is a "half-life" That
means that on average *half* of them will decay *by* that time. A
quarter of them will last twice as long. And eight will last three
times as long, etc. So there\'ll be this long *trail* of decaying mesons
leading from the meson gun to the ship, and past it.

Also, they aren\'t likely to just pass harmlessly through matter.
They\'ll *smash* their way through.

According to Dr. Forward, they\'ve used a Penning trap to hold one
hundred thousand antiprotons for *two months* without losing any. 

That\'s not a huge amount, but they figure they can get as many as a
trillion anti-protons into one. That\'s about 300 joules of energy. And
the trap uses a 9-volt battery for power. Of course, the liquid helium
dewar (oversized thermos :-) is a little bulky. 

So it *does* look like it\'s merely a matter of engineering to be able
to store even more.

> Yes we do BUT only for small quantities for small amounts of time.

Two months isn\'t "small". And since they are finding medical uses for
antiprotons, there *will* be continuing work on getting the cost down,
and the storage times up.

Historically, Traveller "Meson Guns" are supposed to fire Pi neutral mesons.
The above is true for them as well, correct?

According to the official Traveller PSG (pseudoscience-gobbledygook)
explanation, these mesons are supposed to interact with matter only very
weakly, until they decay.  The distance they travel before decaying is
then controlled by firing them at relativistic velocities.

I suspect that the architect of "Meson Guns" in Traveller was either unaware
of the nature of the particles, or had managed to get mesons and neutrinos
confused, or just ignored the whole thing for a nifty-sounding weapon.  :-)

So do I.

This sort of thing has been discussed before on the list (that m-guns can\'t
really work as pictured in Traveller). However, they are one of the most
elegant weapons I have seen in a sf game:
- you park a few deep in your planet, and the enemy\'s jump-troops have to
destroy
the sensors to stop the thing working (can anyone say "potential scenario");
- the whole Sabmiqyes (sp?) thing (leading to the demoralisation of the
Vilani
due to Solomani m-guns) gave much more creedence to the Sol\'s conquest of a
much
bigger empire;
- the place of m-guns as a kind of "ultimate weapon" both in space and on the
battlefield is nice (this assumes no FF&S unlimited lasers ;-), and they have
been well integrated into High Guard; and so on.

I *like* m-guns that can shoot through planets - what more can I say?

Depends on what you want to do with it. Just producing it is fine take
any high energy beam and smack it into a lump of material and load of
anti-particles will be produced. The problem is that in order to store
the anti-matter you have to cool it and this is the big problem.  The
small acceptance of the cooling process means you loose most of the
stuff you produce. Also most of the anti-matter you produce is in the
form of mesons which decay. The probability of producing an
anti-proton, say, from a proton hitting a target is very small
compared to the probability of producing other particles (mainly
photons, pions and neutrons are produced).

Current research facilities, eg. the LEAR ring at CERN, are designed
specifically to capture as many anti-protons as possible and to cool
them for capture or use at low energies. Without a significant increase in
money I doubt you could build a more efficient system.

Stochastic cooling is still the initial method used for cooling. This
can then be followed by a variety of methods, one of which is the
electon method you mention. I believe there are other methods using
lasers but I\'m not really an expert in this field so I can\'t
comment. Once they have the anti-protons down to a few keV in energy
they trap them in an electric bottle and inject electrons in the
central region to cool them down further.

The protons essentially bounce back and forth scattering off the
electrons and cooling down to very low energies.

These storage methods cannot work for a very long time since
eventually the anti-protons will interact with the traces of air in
the container - it\'s not possible to make a perfect vacuum.

Stepping into the realms of science fiction now it may be possible to
trap anti-protons within a crystal lattice. We know that we can
channel charged particles by bending a crystal lattice (our experiment
actually uses this technique) and there are people who think it may be
possible to use crystals as accelerators by exciting vibrations within
them while passing charged particles through them, so why not the
reverse? Pass your anti-protons through a crystal and use the
vibrations to slow them down and let them get trapped in the gaps
between the atoms. Such a storage method would be extremely safe - no
problem if there is a power cut or your fuel tank gets damaged and to
extract the anti-protons just excite the crystal vibrations to
accelerate them out. Inside the crystal they will be protected from
the nuclei containing protons by a cushion of electrons which repell
them so they should be relatively stable. Anyway it\'s just a thought
on how you could safely store anti-matter.

Its actually 0.167m for iron, my typo, sorry! The parameter is called
the interaction length and you obtain it by experiment - you smack
some protons into various ticknesses of iron and count how many make
it through.

There is an impirical formula for calculating it which I can\'t find
right at the moment. I can give you the values for various materials
from a data book I have but they are not really everyday materials
(anyone have a beryllium teapot? :-). You may be able to find more

Yes, although these mesons have such a short lifetime that you would
need and ENORMOUS amount of energy to make them last long enough to be
of use. Since they consist of a quark and anti-quark of the same type
they will interact just like any other meson. What I think the meson
gun designer was thinking of was muons. These are NOT mesons but do
penetrate matter relatively well (not planetary thicknesses but 10m of
iron is no problem at all)

This is physically complete rubbish. Mesons interact through the
strong and, if charged, electromagnetic forces. They could also
interact through the weak force but the effect is so small you can\'t
see it in comparison to the others. The decay mechanisms quite often
involve the weak force though.

What you need to produce similar behaviour (although nothing I can
think of will make them all decay in one place) is an unstable,
neutral, weakly interacting particle, sort of like a neutrino which
can decay. Off the top of my head I can\'t think of any theories which
even predict such a particle, but then again we never know what\'s out
there until we take a look.........

Yes, the fade rate for Psionics is unchanged. The actual ability to use
psionics has gone up in TNE, as there is no longer a system of Psi-Points
to limit the number of uses.

Under the old rules, a single Zho commando teleporter was mildly dangerous.
Now, since he doesn\'t have to worry about PsiPts, and once he gets aboard a
ship, he\'s pretty hard to stop. With a Psi of 10+, and skills of 6-8, the
elite Commando teleport is lethal. (His skills are: Teleprt 8,
Clairavoyance 6) He can sit and wait, and act much more lethally. Under the
old rules, he was just a trooper after he made the pop aboard.

Please, I\'m not THAT much of a boob when it comes to physics (despite

Well, back and forth we go!  I\'d like to ask Roger why storing antimatter 
is so difficult in his opinion.

Also, regarding Meson guns, what do people think about the idea of using 
"control of strong and weak forces" to allow them to fire through 
matter?  Someone (sorry forget the name) suggested wrapping mesons in a 
field that prevented them from interacting with other particles.  This 
may be grasping at straws, but how far-fetched is it?  Couldn\'t one do 
this to any particle if one could do it with a meson?  

One more thing:  Mesons do have somewhat better ability to move through 
matter than other particles, no?  Doesn\'t their lower mass mean that they 
can get through a hull better than other particles?

There has been a lot said about antimatter on the list lately, most of
it quite good. There have been a few misconceptions stated here tho,
that I\'d like to correct before the subject peters out.

Misconception #1 -- An anti-particle has the "opposite spin" of its
particle. This is not true at all, an anti-particle has the same spin as
its coresponding particle. The authors of this statement may have meant
to say that the anti-particle\'s magnetic moment is equal to the negative
of its particle\'s magnetic moment, which is true. Or they may have been
thinking of helicity; a MASSLESS particle with definite helicity (like
the neutrino) will have an anti-particle with opposite helicity. Massive
particles never have a lorentz-invariant helicity, so this rule does not
apply to them.

Misconception #2:

>out. A neutrino *can\'t* annihilate any part of a proton or anti-proton.
>It\'s purely a lepton. And a proton is purely quarks. While they can
>interact, you won\'t lose anything that way. The other nuetral particles

>around. 

A neutrino could react with an anti-proton to make an electron and an
anti-neutron. You would not be able to hold the anti-neutron in a
magnetic bottle. This wouldn\'t happen too often tho.

I\'m not sure what you mean by "effectively consist", but I\'m sure that
the positron (ie, anti-electron) content of the neutron is pretty darn
small. That\'s ok though, since quarks and leptons do interact with one
another by way of the nuclear weak force, and also (for electrons, muons
and taus) by way of the electromagnetic force. So your anti-neutrino
would come in, react with one of the anti-down quarks in the
anti-neutron, turn it into an anti-up quark, and turn itself into a
positron. Meanwhile the anti-neutron (two anti-down quarks and one
anti-up quark) has been turned into an anti-proton (one anti-down quark
and two anti-up quarks.)

Yes!

NO! See above. Weak interactions can (and will, after 11 minutes or so)
cause an anti-neutron to decay into a an anti-proton, but it does not
anhilate or partially anhilate.

I think the idea came from meson gun experiments in Geneva, where
medical researchers fired charged meson beams into the brain tumors of
patients. The pions burned the tumor area, while leaving the intervening
brain matter RELATIVELY unscathed.

The science behind this comes from a peak at the end of the meson\'s
Bragg spectrum. A Bragg spectrum is a plot of the amount of ionizing
energy deposited per cm (dE/dX) by a charged particle travelling thru
matter. The Bragg Peak indicates that a charged particle deposits more
energy per cm towards the end of its path, as it\'s running out of kinetic
energy (ie, braking to a stop in the target material).

In addition to making this peak of ionizing energy, a meson will decay
rather quickly once it stops and it\'s lifetime is no longer
relativisticly dilated. If it\'s a heavy positive meson, it\'s decay
products often contain, among other thinks, a very energetic positron.
The energetic positron quickly strikes one of the nearby electrons and
makes a pair of high-energy gamma rays.

It was these gamma rays that ultimately nixed the pion as a medical
tool. (Everyone uses protons, which are stable and do not decay, these
days.) But as a weapon, the positive meson would be the "exploding bullet"
of subatomic particles. Their Bragg curve makes them ideal for
penetrating external armor, then doing ionizing damage when they stop.
(You tune the energy so they stop inside the ship. You need to estimate
the Hull thickness to do this.) When, they stop, they make, ultimately,
lots of gamma rays and neutrinos, thereby cooking a heavily armored ship
from the inside.

They are less than ideal for hitting a thin, unarmored target, since you
would have to tune them very accurately to do this.

As I said, I THINK this is the inspiration for the Traveller guns. But
real-life meson guns are not magic. To say they "pass thru intervening
matter without interacting" is a gross exageration. Say rather, "they
pass through intervening matter without interacting quite so much."

I may stand corrected:  Empress Paula II suppressed the

1.      OUTLAWING PSIONICS

Alvin replied to a psi query:

>Suppression orders were issued about 600.

I think you will find that Imperial law does NOT outlaw psionics, as such. This
could have been construed as interfering with member worlds, individual rights,
and so on. Imperial law has consistently bee portrayed as only dealing with
things that are a threat to multiple worlds in the empire:
- wholescale slave trading;
- secession;
- wars that escalate and disrupt trade;
- activities which could hurt or disrupt the empire (traitorous activities,
  rebellions and so on);
- private possession of nukes.
- etc (there must be some others, but I can\'t think of them right now).

The Suppression Orders only outlawed the Psionics Institutes, probably because
they discovered to be sponsored by the Zho\'s (this was all nonsense,
"discovered"
as part of the psychohistory experiment that led to the Psi Suppressions). In
this case, the institutes were seen to be conducting anti-Imperial activities;
ie. they were traitors.

It was left up to the member worlds to determine the fate of psionic
individuals. This is why the original rules said that discovery of a psionic
could lead to exile, deportation, execution, or lobotomisation. The law varied
from world to world.

2.      COPYRIGHT

Jeff Zeitlin posted "CONVENTION ON THE TOLERATION OF COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS BOTH
COMMERCIALLY AND NON-COMMERCIALLY PRODUCED" back in Digest 356. It was
intended to set out a fair and legally-sustainable compromise to the issue
of copyright.

Question 1:

Has anything more been heard of this convention? Specifically, have any major
gaming companies been approached with the convention, and how have they
reacted? Has GDW been approached?

Discussion

[The discussion below makes use of the details outlined in the convention
document as cited above, and is not intended as a challenge to the original
work. The convention was originally developed by:
        jimv@cs.ucr.edu (Jim Vassilakos)
        larrys@zk3.dec.com (Larry Smith)
        jhahn@nslsilus.org (Joel "Aardy" Hahn)
        guy.sbd-e@rx.xerox.com (Guy Robinson) ]

At first, I thought that the following was applicable:
"While the prop description may not be copied outright and verbatim, the vitals
of props may be inserted into unofficial game supplements and adventures as
long as the source of the material is properly cited (see Subsection II. F
below)."
"Prop" = a "thing" of an RPG, specifically an thing which a character can
         interact with. eg. a monster, a spell, a skill, a character class,
         an item (in our terms, a specific Vargr character is not a prop, but a
         generic Vargr thug IS a prop).
"Vital" = a specific value associated with a particular prop. eg. "HP=3, AC=6,
          Dam=1d4".
"Description" = information about the prop which cannot be quantified in game
                terms. eg. "The Giant Chicken lives in giant chicken coops in
                Wisconsin where hero-wizards tend their flocks of sheep".

Now, it may be that a planet\'s statistics can be considered to be "prop vitals".
Under the convention, the vitals can be used in unofficial game supplements
and adventures as long as the source is quoted.

However, after reading the convention again, I realised that a planet,
especially a complete list of planets for the Regency, might be considered to
be a "place".
"Place" = "an imaginary locality in a game setting". eg. Waterdeep, Shadowdale.

"Places" ARE under copyright, according to the convention, and you cannot use
them without permission of the copyright holder.

(BTW, note that "characters" are also copyright. In theory under the
convention, we cannot publish adventures that mention Norris or Plankwell or
Strephon unless we have permission. This is probably the main right that an
"Approved by GDW" sticker gives to its holder.)

Question 2:

So, with this in mind, what is the answer? Because planets have "vitals", are
they "props"? Or, because they are so much part of the game setting, are they
"places"? I dunno, maybe only the ones with descriptions are "places", just
like only fleshed-out NPC\'s are "characters".

I think that Psionics *is/was* illegal in the Imperium (at least the 
Imperial Encylopedia library data refers to it as the "...criminal use of 
mental powers...").  However, like murder, member states were able to 
decide the fate of those caught in breach according to local law; the 
Imperial Law just provided the minimum standard for the entire territory 
of the empire.  What the Imperium\'s reaction to a psionic would be 
probably depends on the noble or military commander/civil administrator 
called upon to judge the case.  As the Imperial nobility had a wide range 
of views (as wide as the worlds of the Imperium) punishments would 
probably range as widely as they would from any other source.  Of course, 
it is always possible that Imperial nobles would have pro-psi sympathies, 
and so act to protect the psionic (while still appearing to uphold the 
law).  Another alternative is that an unscrupulous noble (Lucan being the 
big daddy of these) might force the psionic into working for them in 
return for their continued existence.  In any system that supresses some 
naturally iccuring aspect of a person\'s make-up, there will always be 
those who use that supression to their own ends.

In general, you might treat the anti-psi predudice in a similar manner to 
the anti-gay attitude; many (perhaps the majority) abhor the psionic without 
any understanding what it actually means to be psionic, some have a 
fascination with psionics (in a perverse fation which grows from 
mis-understanding) and many just don\'t consider it at all, as it never 
enters into their lives.  There may even be a section of society in which 
being psionic is more acceptable (as with the acting profession and 
gays).  In general, the attitude to gay people at the turn of the century 
in England may be a good guide.  A psionic equivalent of Oscar Wilde?

People have been talking recently about antimatter.  I  came  across  the
following article by Ges Seger  recently  and  thought  it  might  be  of
interest ...



    Antimatter is currently created at accelerator facilities such as
    Fermilab and CERN for research purposes, and femto- to  pico-gram
    quantities are routinely stored and handled.  Scaling up  to  the
    kilogram quantities  neccessary  for  interplanetary  spaceflight
    (and higher quantities for  interstellar)  will  require  further
    research into long-term antimatter management, and the associated
    problems involving thermal, vacuum, and radiation issues.

    The main problem  with  thermal  control  in  antimatter  storage
    involves   sublimation   of   the   antimatter.   For   long-term
    containment, especially within electrostatic or magnetic  fields,
    it is convenient to store the  antimatter  as  a  "snowball".  If
    this snowball can be kept at or below 2 degrees Kelvin, virtually
    no antimatter will sublimate from it.  Should it get much warmer,
    antimatter sublimates rapidly from the snowball, and you\'ve  gone
    from a temperature problem to a vacuum problem.

    For obvious reasons, the snowball should be kept  in  as  good  a
    vacuum as possible.  However, no matter how successful you are at
    keeping  the  temperature  of  your  antimatter  snowball   under
    control, you will always get a few stray anti-atoms  leaving  it.
    There will also be a few stray  cosmic  rays  or  hydrogen  atoms
    which will manage to enter  the  storage  container.  You\'ve  now
    gone  from  a  vacuum  problem  to  a   radiation   problem.   If
    sublimation is kept under  control,  the  radiation  (and  energy
    coupling back into the snowball) is minimized to the  point  that
    the temperature increase of the snowball is negligible.

    Assuming you have safely stored your antimatter, how do  you  get
    it to your reactor?  The most  common  technique  involves  using
    ultraviolet lasers to  ionize  a  local  area  of  the  snowball.
    Intense electrical fields can then be used to remove the  ionized
    antimatter from the snowball and  move  it  to  the  reactor.  To
    insure the snowball\'s mass is not removed  asymmetrically  (which
    would tend to make containment difficult),  it  is  usually  spun
    during this process.

    Other (more speculative) schemes involve treating antiprotons  as
    negative ions and  storing  them  within  normal  matter  crystal
    lattices, or storing antimatter as an exotic quark gas.

  They were published by Digest Group Publications, the late lamented
company that published a wide variety of material for Traveller and
MegaTraveller in the 1980s.  They are MegaTraveller products, and contain
detailed descriptions of the social and economic structures of these
races, as well as history.  This is presented both from the point of view
of the Race itself and from a outside observer, so you get a real feel for
how the race thinks.  There are also rules for character generation and
sector maps .  The original plan was to do books on all the major races -
only these two books were finished before DGP quit publishing. 

  As far as content goes, they are updated and expanded versions of the
Traveller series of Alien Modules on the various alien races.  My favorite
one of the old series is the Solomani one - what other science fiction
game has people from Earth as aliens!?  The DGP books are worth getting 
even if you have the older Alien Modules, since they contain more and 
better written stuff.

  As to their worth, I consider them to be some of the best-written stuff 
for Traveller ever produced.  DGP has a well deserved reputation for 
high-quality products, and Rats & Cats and Doggies & Drones are among the 
best things they did.  If Sneaks & Geeks had been half as good, there 
would have been a lot less complaining on this list.  

  If you like Traveller, the two books are close to must-haves.  If you 
have further questions, let me know.

the ___&____ series consists of two books that I am certain were released:
_Vilani & Vargr_ and _Solomani & Aslan_. The third was to be _Zhodani &
Droyne_.
These were done by Digest Group Productions, under liscence from GDW, and
supplanted the individual race modules of the classic set. They are
specific to MT, but as with all things MT, conversion to CT is minimal.

Note that some future confusion may arise out of GDW\'s current release,
_Hiver and Ithklur_, which is nothing more than the old hiver book, with
New era conversions for CGen, and the Ithklur, who seem to have been added
purely for comic relief.

The DGP materials were the best alien modules I have worked with for any
gaming system, ever. They are complete, and give a wide range of detail
(they\'re almost 3/8" thick), and well laid out.

By comparison, the CT modules are good, but too short. The TNE aliens so
far are not taken seriously enough to allow PC\'s.

I don\'t know about all psionic powers, but - in most cases -
a neural acitivity sensor will be able to detect a telepath.
"WHAT?!" you may say, "a telepath is shielded and there-
fore invisible to a NAS." Quite so. This means that if some-
one is right in front of you and not wearing a psionic shield
helmet, and he or she doesn\'t show on a NAS, then this
person is either dead or or a telepath. Methods exists to
determine if the person is dead or not :-)

In one of my current campaigns, one of the PCs is a
telepath (one of her talents). After she found out the above
fact, she\'s often walking around with her shield down. The
risk of being discovered as a psionicist by a "normal"
imperial citizen is much greater than the risk of meeting a
hostile psionicist.

Wether there are other ways to detect psionics other than
the lenghty test performed by a psionics institute I don\'t
know.

TK and Teleportation can be pretty obvious WHEN USED. Critical failure on
Telepathy can get interesting (I have often made it be reversed
direction!). Slef and Clairavoyance are best detected by unusual behaviour.

In any case, except Teleport, one must either be around blatant uses, or
else one must be very observant. Teleport is VERY blatant, though.

What word are you translating as "firepower"?  They didn\'t use weapons that

Of course if you\'re REALLY cruel, waling around without a shield up 
could have other problems--namely, trying to keep everybody else\'s thoughts 
out.  Of course, this is based on thinking about psionics the way they work 
on _Babylon 5_, which differs somewhat from TRAVELLER canon.

Not a lot. It has a whole 2-3 pages on each race. If you want full Vargr
character generation for TNE, buy the next issue of the Traveller Chronicle.
If you want full Aslan character generation for TNE, buy the next issue of
Signal-GK.

Better still, subscribe to both mags!

Same as for materials that are in print. Generally, in most of the
world, that means that the copyright is good for 75 years for stuff
copyrighted by a corporation, and good for 50-75 years *after the death
of the author* for stuff copyrighted by an individual.

So not only is no Traveller related material out of copyright, none is
*likely* to be until the mid 21st century!

Even if a company has gone out of business, the rights are held by
*someome*. And you need to track that someone down to get permission.

The Greeks had superior armor and weapons. As I recall, at one point the
Greek technological innovation was that their spears or swords were a foot
or two longer. Another innovation was the development of the Phalanx
formation (which was not used int the Battle of Marathon).

In any case, I took it from the story of the battle in the Marathon CD game
- a Doom-like game in which the player defends the colony ship from hordes
and hordes of aliens. The quote is under the category "Lessons applicable
to the game." :)

It does include some rules for generating Vargr and Aslan who\'ve adopted
the Imperial Culture. It gives some guidelines for Zho, Swordworlder, and
Darrian characters. It doesn\'t compare to the "Contact" articles from JTAS.
It is useable enough if you have all that went before, but almost useless
otherwise. much like the whole RSB (except the maps).

More "en-passant" references than huge slabs, although the Sword Worlders and
Darrians get about a page each (as do the New/Old Islands). The Zhos do get a
large mention, although (as a list member said) more along the "destroyed alien
of the month club"-type line, than a real write-up. The Vargr seem to be i/c
most organised Regency criminal activity (although who ran it before??). The
Droyne are almost not mentioned at all, although if you have been following
the traveller list you would have seen the HUGE discussion on Candory and
Andor, still interdicted but now at TL 13-14 with B (?) class \'ports.

I can\'t find any mention of a neural activity sensor in my books,

Neural Activity Sensors are detailed in "World Builders\'
Handbook" from DGP - a product for MT. I also think
they appeared in the equipment catalog in the "Imperial
Encyclopedia" from GDW - also a MT product. I don\'t know
if there\'s been any mention of them in CT books, but I\'ve
always assumed that they are a very integral part of the
Traveller universe. In my campaign they are rather
common.

I assume that a telepathic shield shields the same way as
a psionic shield helmet, and people wearing those don\'t
show up on a NAS.

The GDW Boardgame "Imperium" covers the first to nth interstellar wars. Try
to get a 2nd edition one (red box) that apparently contains additional info
on the first Imperium.

Also the Alien modules: Solomani, Solomani&Aslan and Vilani&Vargr contain
much useful info.

Strangely enough I had been doing a bit of work on source material for that
era of the Traveller universe... prehaps we should pool talents?

It appears in the DGP CT books "Grand Survey" and "Grand Census". These were
later combined and re-issued as the MT "World Builders\' Handbook".
They probably also appear in other DGP stuff (eg. Travelers\' Digest) but I
don\'t recall their ever being mentioned in GDW CT products.

It strikes me that the term "shielded" here means camouflaged.  Therefore
a telepath, being camouflaged, would appear to blend in with the background
and would show on a NAS as a regular person.

I also have never seen or heard of a NAS, so perhaps I\'m talking out of
my hat.

I don\'t have my MT books with me right now, so I\'m not very
sure about this, but I think a NAS works somewhat similar
to the sense psionic ability (isn\'t that what it\'s called - the
ability to sense other living beings?). I\'ve also always
envisioned the psionic shield as working just like a psionic
shield helmet - maybe it\'s only a little weaker. The psionic
shield helmet defends against mind assault as though the
character had telepathy-15!

Could someone with access to their books maybe check
NAS out and see if I\'m right or wrong? I\'m not very sure, but
it\'s the way I play things myself.

And now for something completely different:

Someone (I _think_ it was Jo Grant) mentioned a CT rule
about stellar diameters. Where can I find this rule? Is it a
formula or a table? If it\'s not very complicated, could
someone post how it\'s done, or would that be in violation
of copyright laws? It\'s not very easy to get your hands on
CT stuff, so I\'d be interested in any information about how
it\'s done. Maybe via private email?

Mark Seemann asked about stellar diameters in CT.  The info appeared as
tables in Book 6 Scouts.  However, while the tables in the original form
may be copyrightable, I don\'t think that that applies to the actual
numbers, which are based on the real world, and so available in astronomy
text books.  I think the rule of thumb for main sequence stars is that
the diameter is roughly proportional to the mass; its different for other
sorts of stars (ie. those not like the sun).  If I get time, I\'ll look up
something more accurate.  As a suggestion, take a look at an astronomical
dictionary; at a few quid/bucks it can provide a wide range of background
flavour or dramatic adventure reasons.

According to the book, (Imperial Source Book) it works by picking
up the electrical impulses in a nervous system.  I don\'t

The psionic shield helmet just creats a an electric field

Just wanted to add my .02 cr about this book.

I enjoyed this book very much. It\'s the only New Era material I cared to pick
up. It recasts previous material about the Hivers as being an image that the
Hivers wanted to project to Imperials.

I liked the Ithklur even more as being a new alien race with a distinctly
different flavor. The ambiguity of the Hiver-Ithklur relationship intrigued
me. And I like the Ithklur\'s philosopher-warrior pose.

I found the Santa Claus references to be a bit sillier than I would have
liked, but I"m pretty serious about aliens.

I don\'t remember the chronology of the Ithklur offhand and don\'t have the
book handy, but I assume they\'ve been around since before CT times. So I\'d
want to use them in a CT environment.

I hope more alien modules of whatever stripe get published. Traveller used to
have the best-detailed aliens of any rpg.

("NAS") (available at TL 12) as "detect[ing] the electrical activity of a
life form\'s central nervous system and classif[ying] it according to amount
and complexity."  The NAS can indicate number, range, and motion to beings
exhibiting neural activity.

It can show brain pattern readings of simple, complex, and cluttered.

Neural classes are unknown, human/vargr, aslan, droyne, k\'kree, hiver, and
other (i.e., a minor race the NAS is programmed to recognize).

Intelligence readings are lower form (e.g., worms, insects, fish), not
intelligent (e.g., cattle, birds, bees), semi-intelligent (e.g. dogs, apes,
not uplifted dolphins), and intelligent ("Very complex brain functions
characteristic of sentient life").

These readings are not on a very fine scale, but quite gross.

(Have the EEGs of humans and other large-brained mammals actually been
compared?  I wonder if, e.g., a cow\'s brain really uses less electricity
than a human\'s.)

Imperial Encyclopedia, page 63, describes the Psionic Shield Helmet ("PSH")
as a "Battery powered helmet creating a weak electrical field at human
brainwave frequencies; psionic-talented individuals perceive this as static,
whic prevents undesirable telepathic influences or psionic assaults."  PSH
is only effective against telepathy and related abilities; it has no effect
on, e.g., telekinesis.

WBHB doesn\'t address the impact on psionics.  My approach has been as follows:

Assume that every psychological state has at least one physiological
correlative state.

NAS doesn\'t detect psionic ability, because (1) mere possession of the
ability does not use electrical impulses (like knowing a foreign language
doesn\'t involve electrical impulses until the subject begins to use the
language) or (2) brains vary too much and/or NAS is not sensitive enough to
distinguish between different electrical states and determine that a certain
state indicates "speaking French" versus "using telekinesis".  NAS
technology may be able to make such distinctions as to a single subject
after extensive mapping.

NAS doesn\'t detect that a brain is using psionics, for the second reason
that it does not detect psionic ability.

NAS directed at an individual wearing a PSH detects all of the individual\'s
neuro-electrical activity, allowing the full panoply of gross readings given
above.  PSH scrambles the brainwave readings in a characteristic fashion, so
the NAS will detect that PSH is operating.

    'body' => 'I am working on the real history of the Civil War of 604-622, and have
prepared the working hypothesis set forth below.  My objectives are (1) to
insert the people of the Imperium into this part of its history and (2) to
begin to explain the structure of the Imperial Navy ca. 1100.  I solicit
your responses.

The antebellum Imperial Navy emphasized ties of personal fealty to nobles
commanding ships and fleets, in a manner analogous to the land-based
Imperial feudal system.  Thus admiral of a large fleet might be like a duke,
and the squadrons would be led by commodores who were essentially his
vassals.  The ships\' captains, in turn, who owed personal loyalty to their
commodores, and the crews came from the same planets and owed loyalty to the
captain.  All oaths of fealty ultimately led to, and included, the Emperor,
of course, but ship crews were connected by blood and birthplace, and flag
officers were connected by the noble system or an analogue of it.

The Civil War erupted when Grand Admiral of the Marches Olav hault-Plankwell
won the First Frontier War and found enough discontent among Imperial
subjects, and the Navy, and the bureaucracy in the Imperium\'s handling of it
to indicate that an attempt on the throne would be supported.  What he did
not count on was other admirals finding the same thing and taking advantage
of it.  Hault-Plankwell got to Capital first, but other admirals were on the
way with their fleets.

The war lasted eighteen years, characterized by "fringe battles for power
bases, and central battles for power in the Core."  (Imperial Encyclopedia,
p. 21)  During the war, fleet supply became the critical issue.  No admiral
could attack Capital unless the fleet was in repair and had fuel, missiles
and other ammunition, and food.  Initially, the worlds from which the ships
and crews were drawn supplied them willinglly, but as the war dragged on,
the worlds began to suffer greater hardships in providing war materiel.

In addition, the "fringe battles" were fought for and too often on the most
productive worlds.  Sabotage of shipyards and weapons factories that could
not be turned to one faction\'s use gave way to terrorist attacks and raids
from space.  Shipyards and weapons factories were later supplanted as
primary targets by food processing factories, then cultivated land, then
atmospheres and hydrospheres.

The fleets thus found themselves at war not just with one another but with
the worlds of the Imperium.  In some regions, the fleets were little more
than unusually well-armed pirates, able to conquer whole worlds, but not to
hold them for long against other, similar fleets.  The rounds of conquest
and reconquest took their toll, and the worlds\' productivity dropped.

Each world of the Imperium, while largely defenseless alone, knew or assumed
that other worlds were faced with the same problems.  Agents began to travel
among the worlds, circulating variations of the same treason:  resist the
Navy.  Arbellatra, who had stayed out of the fighting as much as possible,
while defending the Spinward Marches from Vargr, Sword Worlds, and Aslan
opportunists (and Zhodani covert actions), had developed an effective
intelligence department.  Her intelligence staff learned of the new action
by the various worlds, and reported to her.

Instead of a new difficulty, Arbellatra saw opportunity, and started sending
her own agents into the regions of the other admirals, to sow similar
dissension in their worlds.  Her agents had an additional message, however,
which was that the Spinward Marches were better off than elsewhere, because
Arbellatra did not have to crush the worlds with in-kind taxes and forced
labor, because she did not waste her fleets on trying to usurp the throne.
Arbellatra was really the only patriotic admiral, just following her orders
to defend her assigned portion of the realm from all enemies -- foreign and
domestic.

With the advent of the Second Frontier War in 615, Arbellatra began to
increase the size of her fleet in three ways:  with increased shipbuilding
in the Spinward Marches, with donations from nearby admirals, who were glad
to have a neutral force at their backs while they fought each other, and, to
a lesser extent, from captured Outworld Coalition ships.  By the end of the
war in 620, Arbellatra was in Plankwell\'s enviable position:  leader of a
victorious, consolidated fleet, and the winner of a war grossly mismanaged
by the rest of the Imperial defense establishment.  In addition, she had
capably managed public opinion, that had come to detest the admirals as much
as any gang of pirates, to distinguish her as an admiral who was not trying
to be a usurper and who could be trusted not to crush the worlds under her
charge.

Arbellatra took power, but declared that she held it only "in trust for a
rightful successor" to Jacqueline.  (IE, at 21)  She put down the remaining
admirals by gaining the support of the Moot and the worlds.  The worlds
began to resist the roving fleets in earnest, and to declare for the Regent
Arbellatra.  The nobility supported her efforts to starve the remaining
fleets.  The fleets were by now so exhausted -- and often mutinous -- that
the Civil War ended in within two years.

Among Arbellatra\'s post-war programs were reform of the Navy and, after she
became Empress, reinvestment of power with the landed nobility.  The Navy\'s
practices of oaths of personal loyalty and same-world ship crews and
squadrons were replaced with a generic oath to serve the Emperor and the
Imperium, and systems of personnel rotation.  Naval personnel -- officers
and other ranks -- were (and are still by 1100) intentionally sent during
their careers into different regions of the Imperium, normally serving only
a few years on any single ship.  This policy entailed movement of naval
families and some enlargement of naval bases to accomodate them.

The talk about NAS and the ability to detect psionic talent, or use of
it, or not as the case may be, leads me to think about the psionically
operated "flick-switches" mentioned in the Zhodani alien module.  These
allowed devices to be operated by psionically trained individuals,
regardless of the talents they had.  Thus, any Zho noble or intendent
could operate devices by mind power.  How could this work, and be fitted
into the other aspects of psi-powers.

While your hypothesis is interesting, I don\'t believe that it is supported
by the known facts about the Imperial Civil War.  There are a number of facts
which have to be accounted for in any theory of the Imperial civil war,
including:

o All of the "Emperors of the Flag" were highly-ranked Imperial admirals.
  (this is explained adequately in your theory).

o The fighthing of the Civil War involved most or all of the Naval forces
  of the Imperium, but much fewer ground forces.  (This is also adequately
  explained by your theory).

o Several sources note that the Imperial Bureaucracy continued uninterrupted
  during the Imperial Civil War, and MegaTraveller materials indicate that
  the economic disruption of the "Rebellion" (Second Civil War) was much
  greater than the "First" Civil War of 604-622.  In particular, these
  sources note that First Civil War attacks on planets and production
  centers were not nearly as commonplace as in the Second Civil War.  (This
  seems highly at odds with your theory).

o According to Marc Miller (at a talk given at Origins in 1982), the Civil
  War was originally added to the chronology to make the (rather high)
  number of Emperors fit the age of the Imperium.  During the height of
  the Civil War, a vicious cycle was operating, where the de-facto ruler
  of the Imperium[1] would be assasinated by an ambitious subordinate or
  defeated in battle by the admiral of a rival fleet.

[1] Note that few, if any, of hte Emperors of the Flag were formally
    recognized by the Moot and/or Imperial Bureaucracy, but instead invoked
    Succession by Right of Assasination to "legitimize" their rule.  Those
    that proclaimed themselves "By Right of Fleet Control" didn\'t even have
    that - they had instead managed to capture the Capitol and Imperial
    Core.

o Also according to Marc at the same talk, Arbellatra\'s primary innovation
  was in *not* proclaiming herself Empress - but, instead, Regent; and in
  instituting a search for a legitimate heir to the throne.  This
  (presumably combined with effective suppression of possible threats to her
  rule) broke the cycle of ambitious admirals seeking the Throne.  It was
  possible to invoke the Succession by Right of Assasination tradition
  against someone who was Emperor, but the same rationale seemed even more
  flimsy when used against a Regent.  (Again, this facet of the Civil War
  should probaly be broughgt out by a history of the Civil War).

o Arbellatra re-organized the Imperial Navy, and instituted other measures
  to help prevent a recurrence of the Civil War.  A history of the Civil
  War should note how the previous system helped contribute to the War.
  (Your theory does this rather well).

Other things mentioned in passing:
- the Sabmiqys contact article talked about the Terrans inventing the meson gun

- somewhere (reference, anyone?) it talks about how the Terrans surpassed Vilani

This plus the m-gun plus the famed "Solomani drive vs Vilani stagnation" won
them the war.

100 diameters out from the Sun, which is the standard for Stellar Diameter.
This leads to a good approximation: The Stellar Diameter table (present in

While it is easy to tell IF a given moon is within the GGs Jump Horizon,
getting the GGs actual diameter to calculate travel times requires a dig

The original Hiver module mentioned the Ithklur. It gave a one
paragraph discription of them and of several other races, all of which
are mentioned in the New Era Book.  The paragraph basically said that
they were lizard like aliens which killed things for the Hivers.

I use both the sun\'s 100 diameter limit (adjusted according to its mass
compared to Sol) and that of gas giants (when attempting to jump in to a
planet which is a GG moon). The sun limit (for large suns) can occasionally
require one to jump in/out several orbits (many AU) out from the target
planet. This can be explained by using in-system jumps (which are allowed
because of the much shorter range hence grav fluxes don\'t affect jump
accuracy as greatly) or by moving the planet or ignoring the travel times to
some degree (i.e. reduce weeks/months to days).

Supplement 10, THE SOLOMANI RIM.  It was a brief blurb mentioning that a

Expanding on this....

The Travellers\' Digest article by Clay Bush on Imperial history (TD #18, as
I recall) clearly points out who was and who wasn\'t confirmed legally by the
Imperial Moot.  I don\'t recall if similar information was in the Imperial
Encyclopedia or not.  If you look at the progression of emperors, part of
the problem was that the Moot would often narrowly approve someone, and then
the faction that lost would support someone else, or some rogue would come
along and kill off the Moot\'s candidate and take power, sometimes with
enough strength to force the Moot to accept them temporarily.

For instance, notice that Arbellatra Alkhalikoi was appointed Grand Admiral
of the Marches by Cleon V, who was narrowly confirmed by the Moot.  This
may have helped her cause -- Cleon V was legally emperor, so her appointment
was legal as well.  This may have helped to reinforce the air of legitimacy
around her when she moved to become Regent, and may also have attracted a
core of support in the Moot from the noble senators who supported Cleon V\'s
confirmation in 615.

    'body' => 'FIRST IMPERIAL CIVIL WAR THREAD
 ===============================
   My take on the First Civil war is that it was similar to the wars of the
Age of Enlightenment. The Navies fought each other, requisitioned what they
needed from worlds, and otherwise left civilians alone. (Well, I also figure
merchant spacemen were subject to impressment, but the navies still left the
ships and merchant lines running.)
   It was not a war of populations--in most cases! Some power blocs/factions
probably had a cultural bent to them. The Imperial policy of absorbing
worlds and pocket empires probably left a lot of little factions around.
This might have been the most colorful of the Imperium\'s wars.
   Overall, though, the nobility was not directly involved. The Archdukes
are not mentioned. The lesser nobility, while also unmentioned, probably
contributed sons to the navies. This severely limits any theory of cultural
splits being behind the blocs.

SIZE Of NAVY
 ============
   The Imperium had been growing, just reaching Terra shortly before the
war. Consequently, as worlds were still recovering from the Long Night, I
assumed poulations were much smaller than they were in 1116. With the tech
level of the times, I _estimated_ the Navy only had one-eighth as many ships
as it did in 1116.
   The largest capital ships could have been up to one-million tons, but the
design philosophy was still for one ship meets all functions. (Like the
Tigress in Naval Ships.)
   Nothing is said about its organization. Squadrons and fleets based around
high-pop worlds could have continued cultural splits--but, again, nothing is
said. So I didn\'t add that to my compilation.

PERSONALITIES
 =============
   I thought about what a Shakespeare might do with the Civil War. There
wasn\'t space in the article to use it, so I didn\'t develop the musings.
   Plankwell comes off as a MacBeth. Oh, such bloody hands.
   Cleon V would probably be a towering, tragic figure like Caesar. That
Arbellatra\'s authority originated with him would only contribute to a
Shakespeare making him a white knight.
   Donald would best fit as King Lear. Successful, but family troubles.
(What was Emdiri to him?)
   Would Arbellatra be Henry V or Jeanne d\'Arc?
   What to make of Gustus, the last _man_ standing? :-)  His fall seems to
have been delayed by maneuver, but inevitable. Was he cleaning up the mess,
a Johny-come-lately, or what? And being Emperor he can\'t cut a deal with
Arbellatra. I suspect his cause was marked by growing desperation and
defections.

   The rest seem rather faceless in the history. They had to have their own
stories, though.
   I went so far as to determine that Catherine (less than three months in
619) came from Gateway. She was avenging Donald; her murderer, Ramon II, was
avenging Emdiri. Catherine\'s squadrons got away from Ramon with Catherine\'s
heir and settled an unpopulated world in Verge. The tie to Catherine was a
noble family\'s dark secret...but the adventure didn\'t run at the con, and
the Rebellion soon made such a secret fairly insignificant.

Imperial Encyclopedia is a MegaTraveller book (I think it was the third book
in the boxed set, but it was certainly available separately). It is no
longer in print, but it appears regularly in second-hand games suppliers (in
the UK certainly). As to whether it\'s worth buying, it really depends what
you already have. As I recall (and it has been a while since I last read
it), it merely repeats CT info, brought up to MT date.

Regency Sourcebook is the latest release for TNE (I know, I know, but he
asked!). It was released about two months ago and should be available from
your games store. It brings the Spinward Marches setting up to the New Era.

The Ithklur have been around since CT. I can remember references to them in
the Hiver articles and Alien Module from that era. I never understood why
they were never written up in JTAS.

The Shall Not Perish sourcebook didn\'t get too far. The sourcebook was
never completed or published. I think that it was in full swing when the
old TML at Sunbane closed down. From memory, that was the death knell of the
project. If you are interested in the work that was done, try looking at
the old archives at sunbane, particularly the ones just before the list
closed down. I *think* that is where you are likely to find it.

Well, the nobility was involved to some degree in the machinations of the
confirmation process in the Moot, as moot as confirmation was during the
Civil War.  We know the Moot was very divided about who should be emperor
starting as early as Jerome, and this didn\'t help end the Civil War.  It
was "radical nobles in the Moot" that backed the uprising that killed
Cleon V, for instance -- maybe not with worlds or fleets so much as with
their political support.  In my opinion, at least some of these "radical
nobles" were probably hard-line members of the Solomani Movement, which
may explain some of the division in the Moot.  If nobles supporting the
Solomani Movement controlled a large part of the Civil War moot, it might
help explain why all the barracks emperors were pure Solomani -- it was
required to have a chance at confirmation.

Also, recall that we know the Archduke of Antares was forcibly replaced
by Empress Arbellatra for not supporting her, and from what we know of
him, he would have gotten along well with the Solomani hard-line.

>   I thought about what a Shakespeare might do with the Civil War. There

I\'ve thought similar things about the Second Civil War.  The stories of
the bloody reformer Dulinor and fratricidal Lucan, the chaotic end of
Brzk and heroic stand of Norris (written by a Denebian playwright, of
course, for appropriate Shakespearian bias) could make some nice history
plays....

>   Would Arbellatra be Henry V or Jeanne d\'Arc?

If Arbellatra is Henry V, does that cast the Solomani Sphere as France?  :)

Not to mention that he murdered Martin VI to get the Iridium Throne, which
probably required him to have been on Martin\'s staff to get close enough at
that point.  Desperation is about right, too -- after 618, the Moot was
ready to confirm *anybody*.  After going through four emperors in 618,
and another five in 619, things must have looked grim.

Nicolai seems interesting -- he ruled nearly as long as Olav or Cleon V,
scattered the remnants of Olav/Ramon\'s fleet, and managed to win acceptance
by the Moot.  George finally murdered him, and the Moot didn\'t confirm
another emperor until Cleon V.  I can see Joseph supported by the radical
Solomani nobles, which would explain why some nobles would refuse to swear
allegiance to him despite confirmation, putting themselves in a sticky spot.

   Nicolai benefitted from coming right after the Plankwell/Ramon war fleet
shot itself up in the Plankwell-Ramon fight. He may have been fairly equal
in strength with other contenders, but nearer Core/Capital. Then it took
time for his competitors to gather enough strength to come after him.
   But still, as a recognized emperor _at that point_ he had a good chance
of pulling the Imperium back together again. That he didn\'t indicated the
other contenders put their own interests before that of the Imperium.
   Maybe he is more like King Lear than the others. A good man at the mercy
of disloyal forces.

RADICALS IN MOOT
   Regarding the "radical nobles": those are just the kinds of things I
wanted to suggest when I invented them and put them into the chronology.
Something like "the mountain" in the French Revolution, they forced people
to make choices by pressing for "radical" change.
   Their presence provided a mechanism by which the fighting would be
continued beyond the point when the reasonable majority would have cried
"enough!"

Very nice for a first attempt at a history of the Civil War. This is a good
look at a part of Imperial history that is just crying out for somebody to
write a scenario or a sourcebook, but I doubt if anybody can pry
GDW/Challenge away from their ridiculous Reformation Coalition. Anyway, some
suggestions: - these may have been covered by others already but I\'m not
about to edit every time somebody else has the same good ideas as me.  ;]

1.  I think your objective of explaining the structure of the Navy is coming
along nicely. I like the touch of having Civil War era fleets as feudal
fiefdoms - you are correct in assuming this to be a dangerously unstable
setup. One aspect of this that you have not explored is the high probability
that these feudal fleets within the Imperium had probably been fighting
against each other (on and off) since long before the Civil War; their
objective being to take out rival nobles, seize juicy territory etc rather
than become Emperor. In this situation, the Emperor might just keep out of
their way through fear - have a look at the relationship between the King of
England and the Earl of Warwick when the Earl was known as Kingmaker...
(?maybe around 1500-1600?)

2.  Your explanation of the politics of the Imperium during the Civil War
seems a bit too democratic. Imperial citizens\' opinions wouldn\'t really
matter to the Emperor, the Admirals, the Nobility, or anyone else including
the subjects themselves. Even in the Imperium around 1100 the ordinary
citizen (and most lower-order nobles!) have very little political power. The
power blocs would have been made up of large land-holding nobles (including
the Emperor), feudal fleet admirals, and megacorps.

3.  I got the impression that the Civil War didn\'t destroy the Imperium
because the bureaucracy kept going regardless of who was in charge. I can\'t
see them giving support to any of the factions - they probably functioned
like a feudal fiefdom in themselves, under their own highly hierarchical,
obsessively impartial, magnificently bureaucratic system,  - impenetrable to
your ordinary inbred noble.

4.  From what I know of history, I find it a bit bizarre that a Civil War
could cause minimal damage to the population and political structures.
Historically, civil wars have been a fight to the death mobilising the whole
population into massive repetitive assaults until the winner is the last
pathetic remnant left standing...but I guess if the CT canon says the Civil
War didn\'t do much damage, we work with that.

5.  What happened to the Imperium\'s borders while the fleet admirals were
off eating each others\' tails around Capital? During the civil wars of the
late Roman Empire, rebel generals usually recruited the same barbarians that
the Empire had spent hundreds of years trying to keep out. Once they got a
taste of Roman loot, and once their master had paid them off with very
generous grants of land within the Empire, they stayed around and
contributed nicely to further instability. SOMEBODY had to be maintaining
the borders against the Vargr, Solomani, Aslan, etc other than Arbellatra. I
can\'t imagine the nasties being particularly impressed by the news that
Arbellatra\'s navy away off in the Spinward Marches would come along and
spank their botties if they invaded...

6.  The feudal fleets probably operated on a system of "gentlemans\' war"; a
code of conduct that severely limited what they were allowed to do. eg: all
engagements between fleets only (no bombing planets, no ground warfare, -
therefore little impact on the civilian population), set-piece battles on
agreed battlefields, repatriation of prisoners of war, limited weaponry and
all that chivalrous stuff that hereditary nobles with severely limited gene
pool seemed to find honourable. There is certainly plenty of precedent for
this in history, and it would certainly explain why Arbellatra, just having
won a real, \'dirty\' war, could sweep through this pack of pansies in short
order. Think of Shaka taking over the Zulu tribes...ritual warfare with
feather boas wasn\'t much of a match for the disciplined and experienced Impi
armed with assegai.

Hi there Alvin,
I have the challange 53 article, but have had no luck in trying to find
the Challange 54 continuation.  (If you get hold of one, any chance of
getting a photocopy?).

I do have some old notes I made for Striker, trying to integrate ships
into it.  In the end I decided that large warships would be offshore
providing fire support.

Landing craft were just AFV\'s, with a moderate slopped front, no
transmision or suspension but an amphibious transmison only.

For small craft and patrol boats, I just roughtly worked out their
capabilities and didn\'t worry to much about the construction details.

I did try to create a design scheme for boats, but it didn\'t get very far!

Subject: Twas the Night Before Christmas, and All the Engineers were asleep.

        **** \'Twas the Night Before Christmas  ****
                       - Written by a technical writer working on a
                         Government contract

\'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual
Yuletide celebration, and throughout the place of residence, kinetic
activity was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential,
including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus musculus (mouse).
Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood
burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure
regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among
whose folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas.

The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective
accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual
hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically
through their cerebrums.  My conjugal partner and I, attired in our
nocturnal head coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the
hibernal darkness when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the
grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance that I felt
compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for the purpose
of ascertaining the precise source thereof.

Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this
fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without,
reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline
precipitation, might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself
- thus permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a
miniature airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight diminutive
specimens of the genus Rangifer, piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur
so ebullient and nimble that it became instantly apparent to me that he
was indeed our anticipated caller. With his ungulate motive power
traveling at what may possibly have been more vertiginous velocity than
patriotic alar predators, he vociferated loudly, expelled breath
musically through contracted labia, and addressed each of the octet by
his or her respective cognomen - "Now Dasher, now Dancer..." et al. -
guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through which
structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the
32 cloven pedal extremities.

As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was
performing a 180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved -
with utmost celerity and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke
passage. He was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony
residue from oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on
the walls thereof. His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed
largely to the plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in
a commodious cloth receptacle.

His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his
submaxillary dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging
amiability. The capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance
were engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the
former approximating the coloration of Albion\'s floral emblem, the
latter that of the Prunus avium, or sweet cherry.  His amusing sub- and
supralabials resembled nothing so much as a common loop knot, and their
ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small, tabular and
columnar crystals of frozen water.

Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey
fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a
decorative seasonal circlet of holly. His visage was wider than it was
high, and when he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region
undulated in the manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical
container. He was, in short, neither more nor less than an obese,
jocund, multigenarian gnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me
visibly frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being. By
rapidly lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head
slightly to one side, he indicated that trepidation on my part was
groundless.

Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the
aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the aforementioned
articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned previously
dorsally transported cloth receptacle.  Upon completion of this task, he
executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in lateral
juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in a
gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by
renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself
in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of
air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of
burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto observable
chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I
overheard his parting exclamation, audible immediately prior to his
vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility: "Ecstatic Yuletide to the
planetary constituency, and to that self same assemblage, my sincerest
wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period
between sunset and dawn."

I think that to get an accurate "canonical" picture you need the following
resources:
        1. Fifth Frontier War
        2. The Spinward Marches Campaign
        3. MT Rebellion Sourcebook

The 5FW shows the size of fleets in one major battle. SMC gives you an actual
breakdown of ships in one battle-rider squadron, whose counter actually appears
in the 5FW game. Finally, MT-REBEL gives a picture of the number of fleets
across the entire Imperium.

A supplementary source is Trillion Credit Squadron (for economies and naval
budgets). Remember, though, there was an earlier discussion on this list about
the Navy. I think that I said something about the ratio of supporting
infrastructure to the number of actual craft; AIR it was something horrible
like 10:1 (ie. only 10% of the budget is used to actually buy AND maintain
ships).

The Aslan would be constrained by the Peace of Ftahalr, which predates the
First Civil War, if by nothing else.

The Solomani Sphere, at least as far out as the Near Bootes Cluster, was
fully integrated into the Imperium by this period.  We know for certain
that Terra, and probably the rest of the Old Earth Union, was admitted in
588.  Beyond the Imperial border would have been a collection of fairly
advanced but small states of Solomani origin, similar to the OEU and the
Easter Concord, a number of individual worlds, and an open frontier.  The
Solomani Confederation doesn\'t exist until 871.

The Vargr.  Hm.  Well, the Vargr in Gvurrdon moved with the Zhodani based
Outworld Coalition in the 2FW, but we don\'t know if anything happened in
other places along the border.  Since all the barracks emperors were "pure
Solomani", and the region along the border is very Vilani in nature except
for the Marches, parts of Deneb, and maybe parts of Antares, maybe most
of those fleets stayed put.  Generalized unrest along the border, caused
by Vargr corsairs, wouldn\'t be surprising though.

The K\'kree are too far away -- their jump drive technology probably lagged
the Imperium even worse in the 600s than it does in the 1100s.  The Hive
Federation would rather trade with the Imperium and the non-aligned states
than invade anyone.

Michael:

You have some very good ideas.  May I post your comments to the History of
the Imperium Working Group list, where we\'re having a similar discussion?

I\'m afraid I agree.  Sigh.

Yes, this makes sense.  It\'s part of the constantly shifting balance of
power between the nobility and the Emperor.  Arbellatra and her successors
did what they could to weaken the nobility and strengthen the throne;
Strephon undid all of it with a few keystrokes.  (Yes, that\'s a gross
oversimplification.)

Opinions, per se, don\'t matter.  Mao Tse-tung was quite right to say that
political power comes from the barrel of a gun.  If the citizens find that
oppression is too hard to bear, they\'ll arm themselves (figuratively as
well as literally) and oppose it.  An example would be providing
intentionally contaminated food and/or fuel to the fleets.  Resistance
would be facilitated by agents carrying information, propaganda, etc. from
world to world.  Is this where the Ine Givar come from?

I\'m going to adopt this, too.

What is our canonical source for the First Civil War not doing much
damage?  The continued functioning of the bureaucracy is the only
indication that I have of it.

This is a nice thread.  The various fleets must have devoted some of their
resources to border defense.  They probably had an agreement to work
together as necessary in that capacity (which may well have been more
often honored in the breach).

Gentlesophonts\' war, we say here in Berkeley, but yes, this makes sense.
It also explains how the war didn\'t wreck the Imperium like civil wars
usually do -- the civs themselves weren\'t doing much fighting, although in
an 18-year conflict some recruiting would have to go on.  I\'m going to
have to rethink my oppression of citizens theme; it may be that I can
justify leaving them mostly out of it.

A) How do you fellow Travellers pronounce the following:
Efate (I\'ve usually heard F-8)
Ine Givar (I\'ve usually heard eenay zhi\'-var, but often ine giv\'-ar with
a hard "g")
Boughene
Moughas

B) What is the truth about the Ine Givar?  There seems to be a dearth of
canon about them.  I\'ve usually used the following in my campaigns, but
solicit your ideas and criticisms:

1.  "Ine Givar" is a label that the Imperial government uses to demonize
any internal enemy in the Spinward Marches or Corridor sectors.
Accusations of Ine Givar activity invoke certain anti-Ine Givar laws,
giving additional prosecutorial and investigative powers to Imperial
military and naval intelligence.  In addition, the population of the
region has long been conditioned to respond with fear and hatred to the
Ine Givar.

2.  The Ine Givar is a large cadre of revolutionaries operating primarily
in the spinward/coreward regions of the Imperium.  Its goal is to liberate
the region from Imperial/megacorp/noble domination and establish a free
state governed by the residents of the various worlds according to their
own needs and desires.  The Ine Givar is largely pro-psionic and some
branches receive funding from the Zhodani Consulate.  Outside control is a
constant, and divisive, issue within the Ine Givar leadership.  The Ine
Givar cadre devote considerable resources to training revolutionaries on
various worlds; the cadre itself, while large, is still small compared to
the population of a sector (maybe 100,000 - 200,000).

3.  1 and 2 are both true.

If anyone can cite me to canonical discussion of the Ine Givar, I would
be grateful.

a. F8 (there are many derivative worlds; I\'ve often made reference to "inthe"
if I type too fast %-)
b. "ine giv\'-ar" - I always wondered if it was from "indian-giver" ;-)
c. We usually call it "Bognor" as in "Didn\'t we have a lover-ly time | The day

In the Regency Sourcebook (TNE material), the Ine Givar was noted as a
genocidal Vilani terrorist group, which waznted to kill of fall other
human races.

It was also said that such a group is rather out-of-character for the
Vilani to form.

GDW deliberately left the Ine Givar almost totally featureless in order to
let every Referee develope them as they choose. They are revolutionaries,
before the 5FW they were backed by the Zhodani (who _claims_ that they
stopped backing them after the war), and they are multi-planetary. Beyond
that you\'re are on your own.

>From the 5FW boardgame we get the following information about the
Ine Givar:

    The Zhodani player has at his disposal the forces of the  Ine
    Givar - a guerrilla movement fighting against the Imperium on
    a number of worlds.  Each guerrilla unit  has  two  modes  of
    operations: covert and overt.  When covert, a guerrilla  unit
    is in hiding on its world and  is  ignored  for  all  surface
    combat and world control purposes.  When overt,  a  guerrilla
    unit is treated as a regular Zhodani troop unit.

    A guerrilla unit\'s tech level is the tech level of the  world
    on which it is operating.  A full strenth guerrilla unit  has
    a strength equal to 10% of the full  strength  value  of  the
    world\'s defense battalion factor, regardless of whatever  the
    current strength of the defense battalions is.  For  example,
    a full strength guerrilla unit on Efate would have a strength
    of 100 (battalions) and a tech level of 13.

    The Zhodani player places the ten guerrilla units before  any
    other units are deployed.  At least three must be  placed  on
    Efate,  and  at  least  one  must  be  placed  on  Ruie.  The
    remaining six may be placed on any Imperial controlled worlds
    that have defense battalion factors and are not interdicted;
    they may be placed singly or in groups.



Additionally, the Traveller News Service gave hints of  terrorist
activity on Efate, Pixie, Feri  and  Forboldn.  In  078-1107  the
Imperium  deployed  16  or  more  brigades  on  Efate  to   fight
insurgents.



Pronounciation of "Ine Givar" is either "In-Eh Jiv-Or" if it is a
Zhodani name or "In-Eh Give-Or" if not.  The last  "a"  being  an
"Ah" sound is aparently  peculiar  to  Solomani  languages,  both
Zhodani and Vilani pronounce it as "oc" (as in lock).

This is a bit delayed, I\'m afraid, as I\'ve just submitted my thesis!

I looked at the jump diamter problem when I discovered that for
planets orbitting large stars (giants/supergiants), then the only way
to make them a comfortable temperature was to place them so far within
the jump limit that it took 1 week+ to reach them.  This didn\'t fit in
with the worlds I was creating; they usually weren\'t wonderful garden
worlds, so the chances are they would be passed by, as they also were
not in strategic locations.

I solved this problem ny linking the jump diameter limit to the mass
of the body near which you are jumping.  For planetary bodies, with
earth-like densities, the 100 diameter rule is pretty close.  Stars
and gas giants have a much lower density, resulting in a lower jump
distance.  In the end, I said that the important thing was the *rate
of change* of gravity with distance that mattered.  Thus, you could
jump safely when the change in gravity over the length of your ship,
or over the short distance it moves during jump insertion, is
sufficiently small.  I now work out jump distance using one of two
formulae, depending on the central object:

J-dist=117.5*(cube root of star\'s mass from tables) million km for stars

J-dist=1.28*(cube root of planet\'s mass) million km for planets and gas giants
      =160*(cube root of density)*(UWP size) thousand km

All the masses and densities, etc. can be determined with Grand
Survey/World Builder\'s Handbook/whatever that T:TNE thing is called.
This gives answers for planets similar to those with the basic rules,
but also make stellar jump diamters more sensible.  I think in the
case of some big stars, it is possible to come out *inside* it, if you
are not careful about your destination coordinates.

I was  interested   not  in  the   rules  per  se,   but  in  the
ramifications of  the rules, and  their effect upon  strategy and
tactics in intership and space-based combat.

Here\'s what I learned:

Sensor  and weapon  range determine  the type  of space conflicts
which can occur.

    In  a  campaign  with   long-range  sensors  (and  long-range
    weapons), because  sensors (and weapons)  are limited to  the
    speed of  light, the delay in  time between the image  of the
    target travelling  from the target to  the firing vessel, and
    the delay  in time for  the weapon fire  to reach the  target
    vessel, scoring a hit is highly unlikely if the target vessel
    is evading (altering course often).

    Thus, a single  weapon (such as a spinal  mount) could easily
    be   dodged,  and   it   would   take  many   weapons  firing
    simultaneously in guessing patterns to make a hit likely.

    The  shorter  the  range  to  the  target, the less effective
    evasion becomes.


    Long-range  weapons would  allow  spacecraft  to jump  into a
    system, lock on to  planetary targets (adjusting for movement
    variables such as speed of orbit and rotation), fire upon the
    target, and leave the system before defensive action could be
    taken.  There is  little  defense  against an  energy weapon,
    because you can\'t see it before it hits you.

    To  prevent or  reduce the  effects of  the same  tactic from
    working  on  peaceful  ships,  those  ships  would need to be
    engaged  in  evasive  maneuvers  (randomized  by computer) as
    standard  operating procedure  at all  times. Otherwise, they
    could be picked off like  flies by long-range fire which they
    wouldn\'t know was coming until it hit them.

    The shorter the range of  weapons, the less effective hit and
    run becomes.


    In  a  campaign  with   short-range  sensors  and  long-range
    weapons, the hit-and-run tactic against large visible targets
    (planets) is  strengthened, as the  attacker remains for  all
    intents and purposes invisible.

    Ship-to-ship combat is deadlier in such campaigns, because in
    order to see the enemy, they  have to be fairly close to you,
    reducing the effectiveness of evasion. Though ship encounters
    would  be much  less common.

    Search and destroy missions  in space resemble groping around
    in the dark. Ships in  interplanetary space become needles in
    a haystack.

    Protecting against and catching  smuggling and pirate vessels
    is  harder.  The  shorter  the  range  of  sensors,  the less
    effective  sweeps (patrols)  become.

    For ship-to-ship combat purposes,  it provides little benefit
    to have energy weapons of greater range than your sensors.

    The longer the range of sensors,  the easier it is to protect
    a system against piracy.  Refueling points become much easier
    to secure.


    In  a  campaign  with  short-range  sensors  and  short-range
    weapons,  ship-to-ship combat  is about  the same  as in  the
    example above.

    But  the  hit-and-run  tactic  is  reduced  in effectiveness,
    because the attacking ship must  get too close to the planet,
    increasing the likelihood of running  into a patrol, or being
    spotted  by  the  planet   (which  likely  has  longer  range
    sensors). By the time you move into position, the planet will
    have spotted you.


    Things  really start  to get  interesting when  you vary  the
    range of  sensors and weapons based  on ship (and powerplant)
    size.


Digest Group Publications did a  lot of work on the MegaTraveller
rules. Of everything in the  main rulebooks, the sensors and ship
weapons  section  of  the  vehicle  construction  chapter  in the
referee\'s manual left the most to be desired.

We just want to do a better job with our upcoming sci-fi release.

Hopefully, the above observations will give us a basis upon which
to adjust the ranges made available  in the setting (to the limit
of technological level, of course).

Thanks for your interest.

Sincerely,

Roger Sanger

Clearly not, as you must be on some pretty serious drugs.

What color is the sky in your little world?

Remember, this is the GDW that - apparently on a marketing-dept whim -
trashed the entirety of the most complete, best laid out, thorough sci-fi
gaming universe in two stages.  First, the rebellion, then that STUPID

     <Do you have a list of  known ancient sites, especially in the Domain of
Deneb?>   The following is part 2 of a file by Clay Bush on the ancients:

                             Regina Subsector

Yori
(University of Regina)

   This small site is characterized by iridescent white building
blocks and occasional deep rubble-filled wells.  It was found
buried in a vast desert, surrounded by signs of destruction from
the Final War.

Beck\'s World
(University of Regina)

   Somewhat larger than the Yori site, it is a collapsed warren of
interlocking caverns.  It is only partially excavated.

Efate
       (IISS)

   Operated as a historic site.  Restorations show a gridwork of
thousands of walls spaced about two meters apart, and punctuated by
extremely massive bulwarks at random intervals.
   Discovered in 354, it has long since been stripped of any useful
items.

Pixie (Secret)
       (IISS)

   A flat irregular area meticulously inlaid with a mosaic of
multi-colored anodized aluminum bars.  There is no sign of the
purpose of this site.
   Located on the edge of a vacuum plain under the shadow of a
range of mountains, the site is protected by numerous security
devices.

Inthe (Secret)
       (IISS)

   Large artificial mounds of earth, tens of kilometers long, are
scattered over a thousand square kilometer, but analysis and
excavaton has given no indication of their purpose.  A large
volcanic crater (now water-filled) lies on the plain in the center
of the mounds, and may have been the site of the Ancient base.

Knorbes (Secret)
(Imperial navy)

   Ruined brick and mortar buildings here held a large cache of
2,000 black globe generators.  The Ancient base was originally
destroyed when a massive attack cratered the area, and then toppled
mountains into the craters.  In the thousands of years since,
erosion has uncovered the site.
   The navy has taken elaborate precautions to conceal the fact
that a site even exists here.  Similarly elaborate measures trap
and detain intruders.

                              Lanth subsector

Boughene (Destroyed)

  The ship destroyed itself after the adventure, Secret of the
Ancients.  The village and navigation beacon were reported to the
authorities.

Victoria (Lanth 0207)

   In 1077, Vlen Backett found an Ancient site in a clearing,
apparently a residence.  "Later, Backett loved to tell about the
wonders and magics he had found in that little warren of rooms and
closets.  His descriptions of the shimmering walls, The doors of
cloud-mist, the floors of focussed gravity, the paper-thin but
steel strong partitions, the many fantastic sights and sounds were
he himself admitted, inadequate."
   The site on the moon had been looted long before 1077.


                            The sites at Zhdant

   In -302,000 a fleet of droynestarships arrived in the Zhdant
system and within the space of a year or two established two
settlements or bases.  Once the bases were established, the fleet
of ships left.  Their further adventures are unknown.
   Over the next century, the two bases grew into cities.  Each
city created a thriving economy, and they traded goods between
them.  Orbital stations were established on asteroids moved into
place for the purpose.

   Zhdant City sprawled along the western coast of Qiknavra,
creating large networks of rail-guided grav transports, skyscrapers
in the western mountain ranges, and undersea dome cities off-shore.
The ancients dug gently curving trenches miles into the floor of
the ocean, and then gently filled them in.  They sliced off the
tops of mountains, lifted them twenty meters into the air, and
filled the gaps with artificial stone.  They built large reinforced
steel buldings totally empty and totally sealed against entry.
   The inhabitants also bred humans until the local human
population approached 500,000.  Evidence indicates they were a sort
of trained servant/pet.

   The other settlement occupied a wind-swept desert plain on the
eastern limb of Zhdant\'s tidally locked moon - Viepchakl.  The
foundations of Viepchakl city burrowed kilometers into the the
crust of the moon; its towers reached heights of ten kilometers.
Familiar activities include many identical buildings and a tunnel
network carrying utility servicing.
   Arrow straight roads tunnelled through intervening rock faces
without flinching, but stopped or were abandoned when confronted
with crevasses or chasms more than a few meters deep.  Desert sands
were sorted into stockpiles based on color or granular shape.
Viepchakl city shows no evidence of ever having kept or bred
humans.

   The two cities did have one common feature: in both cities, road
intersections were marked with a stone stanchion topped with a
polished crystal octahedron.

   Zhdant in the Final War.  The war was late in touching Zhdant.
Radioactive dating methods place the first nuclear explosion at -
299,700.  Nearly 500 megatons rained down on Zhdant City in a few
days.  The orbiting asteroid station was knocked from orbit,
crashing into the ocean and burying itself in the sea floor.
  Viepchakl City\'s buldings were cut off even with the ground, and
allowed to shatter when they fell.The city center become one big
crater kilometers across - although the weapons used left no
measureable radiation contamination.
   The attacking fleets left within a few weeks.  There is no
evidence of further attacks in the system.  Bacteriological agents
specific to each city\'s inhabitants were drop-launched, but were
each went to the other world.  This was discovered only when
Zhodani astronauts brought the two into contact in -7,950.

   Dust thrown into the Zhdant\'s air caused a nuclear winter, which
triggered an ice age.  In a short 20,000 years the glaciers began
to retreat.  The descendants of human survivors began the long
climb to civilization.

I\'ve finally got around to updating the planet generation system I first
posted here a couple of years ago. Besides minor changes to the star and
planet mechanics, I\'ve added systems for generating colonies and
intelligent species.

I\'m working on a set of programs for automatic generation of stars,
planets, colonies, and aliens; they should be ready early in the new year.

An HTML version is available; email me if you want it.

1. INTRODUCTION
----

This is a reasonably quick and simple system for generating complete
planetary systems in rough detail, and the most interesting planets in
somewhat greater detail. It also includes a system for generating
intelligent life forms. It isn\'t tied to any particular game mechanics, and
should be usable with any SFRP system.

I designed it because I\'ve never been very impressed by the planet
generation schemes in most SF role-playing games, which are usually either
too unrealistic or too complicated (or, frequently, both). I wanted a
scheme that was simple enough to generate systems fairly quickly, while
still being designed by someone who knew one end of a Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram from the other (hint: neither end is likely to have anything
resembling Earth orbiting it).

You will need some six-sided and ten-sided or twenty-sided dice (or, of
course, a computer with a good random number function). I assume you\'re
familiar with the usual dice notation (so you know what something like
"2D6+3" means). This system requires rolls on D6, D10, D20, and D100.
Unless otherwise stated, all results of less than zero should be counted as
zero, and all fractional results should be rounded to the nearest whole
number (round halves upwards).

2. STAR SYSTEMS
----

In the local region of the Galaxy, there is about one star system per 600
cubic light-years. I suggest using cube-shaped sectors either 25 or 50
light-years on a side. A 25 light-year sector has 8D6-2 star systems
(average 26); a 50 light-year sector has 6D20+145 systems (average 208;
more appropriate to generation by a computer program than by hand). Place
the systems at random within the sector (roll D100/4 or D100/2 for each of
the X, Y, and Z coordinates).

To find the number of stars in a system, roll D100 on the following table:

    D100   Stars
    ----  ----
    1-40   1
    41-90  2
    91-99  3
    100    4

Stars are classified into seven "spectral types", based on their
temperature and colour. The types are O (blue), B (blue-white), A (white),
F (yellow-white), G (yellow), K (orange), and M (red); astronomers use the
mnemonic "Oh, Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me" to remember the sequence. The seven
types are each divided into ten subclasses, indicated by a digit from 0 to
9 after the spectral type (except type O, which is normally divided only
into subclasses 5 to 9). The Sun, for example, is type G2.

A Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is a plot of stars with spectral type on the
horizontal axis and luminosity on the vertical axis. The majority of stars
fall into the "main sequence", which runs roughly diagonally, from bright,
blue-white O-type stars at the top left of the diagram to dim M-type red
dwarfs at the bottom right, with yellow dwarfs like the Sun falling almost
exactly in the middle. Other types of stars are above or below the main
sequence.

Red giants (indicated by a "g" prefix on the spectral type, e.g. "gM5") and
supergiants (indicated by a "c" prefix, e.g. "cK0") are late stages in the
life cycle of massive stars. White dwarfs (indicated by a "D" prefix, e.g.
"DA"), much dimmer than most main sequence stars, are the final stage in
the evolution of most stars. The most massive stars will end up as neutron
stars or black holes (these have no spectral types; the tables below use
"NS" and "BH" to represent them).

For each star in a system, roll D100 (one to three times) on the following
table, to get the general description and the specific spectral class of
the star. A subclass number should also be generated for main sequence and
giant stars (white dwarfs are not usually given a subclass).

The stars in a system should be listed in descending order of luminosity.
Take the basic groups in order (supergiants, giants, main sequence, white
dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes); within each group, list stars in order
of spectral type.

Many astronomical references use a more detailed system of "luminosity
classes", which run from I (supergiants) to VII (white dwarfs). This level
of detail is probably unnecessary for gaming. If you\'re using a star
catalogue that uses this system, you can convert the full luminosity
classes to the broad classes I\'ve used here using the following table.

    Luminosity class               Description
    ----  ----
    I                              Supergiant
    O-A II, F II-III, G-M II-IV    Giant
    O-A III-VI, F IV-VI, G-M V-VI  Main sequence
    VII                            White dwarf


3. PLANETARY SYSTEMS
----

Refer to the following table to generate the number of planets for each
star. First determine whether there are any planets; for multiple star
systems, roll only once for the whole system, using the spectral type of
the primary star. If the result is affirmative, generate the number of
planets for each star, based on the star\'s own spectral type.

    Star                     Spectral  Probability  Number of
    type                     class     of planets   planets

    Main sequence            O-B       10%          D10
    ...                      A         50%          D10
    ...                      F-G       99%          2D6+3
    ...                      K         99%          2D6
    ...                      M         50%          D6
    White dwarf              All       10%          D6/2
    Neutron star/black hole  All       5%           D6/2

Planetary systems are divided into three zones; different types of planet
will tend to form in each zone. Zone A is the inner or hot zone; zone B is
the intermediate or life zone; and zone C is the outer or cold zone (in our
system, Mercury and Venus are in zone A, Earth and Mars are in zone B, and
the asteroids and outer planets are in zone C). The following table
indicates which planets are in each zone for main sequence, giant, and
supergiant stars; all planets of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black
holes are considered to be in zone C.

    Total    Planets in   Planets in   Planets in
    planets  zone A       zone B       zone C
    ----  ----  ----  ----
    1-3      --           Planet 1     Planets 2+
    4-5      Planet 1     Planet 2     Planets 3+
    6-7      Planet 1     Planets 2-3  Planets 4+
    8+       Planets 1-2  Planets 3-4  Planets 5+

At this point, if the star is a member of a multiple system, remove the
outermost D6+1 planets (this may leave the star with no planets). Determine
the planetary zones before deleting planets.

For each planet, three parameters are determined: type, size, and number of
moons. Roll D100 and refer to the following table for planet type, then
generate the size and moons.

    Earthlike [*2] --      91-100  --      (2D6+5)x1000  D6xD6/10

    [*1: Count as "cold" if the star is a white dwarf, neutron star, or
    black hole.]

    [*2: Count as "hostile" if the star is anything other than a main
    sequence star of type F, G, or K.]

Asteroids: A collection of rocks that never combined to form a planet.
Usually there will be a handful of large asteroids a few hundred kilometres
across, and a vast number of smaller objects.

Giant: A huge planet consisting mainly of hydrogen, ranging from ten to a
thousand times the Earth\'s mass. Example: Jupiter.

Rock: A small, rocky planet with no atmosphere. Example: Mercury.

Cold: A small planet with no atmosphere, composed mainly of ice; found only
in the outer part of a system. Example: Pluto.

Desert: Comparable in size to Earth, but with a barren surface and a thin,
inert atmosphere. Example: Mars.

Hostile: Comparable in size to Earth, with an atmosphere containing no (or
a negligible amount of) oxygen, but possibly with some other active
component. Hostile planets may occasionally have native life forms, but
they will be based on a very non-Earthlike biochemistry. Example: Venus.

Marginal: Almost Earthlike, with oxygen in the atmosphere, but with some
serious problem that makes it an unpleasant place to live, such as very
high or low temperature, atmospheric pressure, or oxygen level; traces of
some toxic gas in the atmosphere; dangerous volcanic activity; or high
radiation level. No examples in our solar system.

Earthlike: Oxygen atmosphere, temperatures not too far outside the human
comfort zone, and a reasonably stable surface. Note that the presence of
oxygen in the atmosphere necessarily implies the presence of life (oxygen
is too reactive to occur in large amounts from geological processes alone,
and would disappear in a relatively short time if life were to become
extinct). Example: Earth.

The details of a system\'s planets can be conveniently written using the
initial letter of the planet type, the size in thousands of kilometres, and
a dot followed by the number of moons, if any. Asteroid belts are simply
indicated by an "A" with no numbers (and are not counted towards the
"official" number of planets). Use slashes to mark the zone boundaries.
Here are some examples, using our solar system and an imaginary one
generated for Alpha Centauri.

4. EARTHLIKE AND MARGINAL PLANETS
----

4.1. PHYSICAL DETAILS

Generate a planet\'s orbit period using the table below, dependent on the
spectral type of its sun. If there are two Earthlike or marginal planets
orbiting the same star, generate two periods and assign them in the correct
order (the inner planet, obviously, gets the shorter period). If the outer
period is less than 25% more than the inner one, generate both of them
again.

    Star type  Orbit period
               (Earth days)
    ----  ----
    F0-F4      (2D100x3)+600
    F5-F9      (2D100x2)+400
    G0-G4      2D100+270
    G5-G9      2D100+150
    K0-K4      D100+120
    K5-K9      D100+70

To find the planet\'s rotation period, roll D100, add 10 for each moon, add
10 if the planet orbits a K-type star, and refer to the following table.

    Result   Rotation
    ----  ----
    1-65     D20+9 hours
    66-90    D20+20 hours
    91-98    D10 days
    99-103   D100 days
    104-150  D10 days

Roll D6/2+3 (keep fractions, don\'t round) for the planet\'s density in grams
per cubic centimetre. Multiply diameter by density and divide by 70000 to
calculate the surface gravity in Earth gravities (round to the nearest
0.1).

Roll 2D6-4 for Earthlike planets, or D10+D6-6 for marginal planets, and
multiply by 5 to find the average surface temperature in degrees Celsius
(negative numbers should be retained here, not counted as zero). If a star
has two planets in zone B and both of them are Earthlike or marginal, make
sure the temperatures are in the right order; the outer planet should have
a temperature no higher than the inner one (greenhouse effects and similar
phenomena can affect a planet\'s temperature, but not by all that much on a
planet with an approximately Earthlike atmosphere). If the outer planet\'s
temperature comes out higher, either swap them around (if the planets are
both Earthlike or both marginal) or generate both temperatures again (if
there is one of each).

Use the following table to determine the proportion of the planet\'s surface
covered by dry land, water, and ice. Roll dice for the water and ice areas
(count less than zero as zero, more than 100% as 100%); the land area is
whatever remains. If the water and ice areas add up to more than 100%, roll
both again.

    Average       Water        Ice
    temperature   area         area
    ----  ----  ----
    -20 to -10 C  (D10-5)x5 %  (D10+10)x5 %
    -5 to 5 C     (D20-5)x5 %  D10x5 %
    10 to 20 C    (5D6-8)x5 %  (D6-2)x5 %
    25 to 35 C    (5D6-8)x5 %  (D6-3)x5 %
    40 to 50 C    (5D6-8)x5 %  (D6-4)x5 %

If the land and water percentages are both greater than zero, the oceans
are assumed to be salt water (unless the planet has the "freshwater oceans"
special feature; see below). If the land percentage is zero, any oceans
will be fresh water (salt reaches the ocean through runoff from the land;
if there\'s no land, there\'s no salt).

A planet\'s mineral resources are measured on an arbitrary scale, running
from 1 (worst) to 100 (best). The Earth is rated 80, fairly high, because
of its high density (implying a relatively high ratio of metal to rock),
and its active volcanic and tectonic processes (which carry minerals from
deep in the interior to the surface). A planet\'s mineral resources rating
is generated by the formula:

    Minerals = (Diameter / 500) + (Density x 10) + (D100 / 2) - 45


4.2. BIOLOGICAL DETAILS

Roll D100 on each of the following tables to determine the evolutionary
level of the local life forms, and their chemical basis.

    D100                  Level of development
    Earthlike  Marginal
    ----  ----  ----
    --         1          No life
    1-10       2-30       I: Single-celled organisms only
    11-20      31-45      II: Simple invertebrates and plants (in seas)
    21-30      46-60      III: Advanced invertebrates and plants (on land)
    31-40      61-75      IV: Simple vertebrates (fish, amphibians)
    41-100     76-100     V: Advanced vertebrates (reptiles, birds, mammals)

If you get the "No life" result, life must have become extinct fairly
recently by geological standards, or the oxygen in the atmosphere would
have combined with surface materials and disappeared (it\'s difficult to say
how long this would take -- perhaps a few million years). The extinction
was probably caused by nuclear war or an astronomical disaster such as an
asteroid strike or a nearby supernova.

    D100                 Biochemistry

    81-100     61-99     Carbon-based
    --         100       Non-carbon-based

For simplicity, the many possible varieties of biochemistry are divided
into four broad classes.

Earthlike: Essentially the same chemical basis as Earth\'s life forms, with
only small differences, if any. Plants and animals with Earthlike
biochemistry can often be safely eaten by humans (and vice versa).

Protein-based: Similar to Earth life in its basic chemical components, but
with enough differences to make the biochemistries incompatible. Life of
this type will nearly always be inedible, and frequently poisonous, to
humans.

Carbon-based: Based on the same elements as Earth life, but arranged in
very different compounds. Always inedible, and usually extremely poisonous.

Non-carbon-based: Completely different to Earth\'s biochemistry in every
way. Invariably poisonous. Very rare, at least on anything resembling an
Earthlike planet.


4.3. SPECIAL FEATURES

There is no such thing as a typical Earthlike planet; every world is
unique. To reflect this, some Earthlike or marginal planets will have one
or more "special features" that are not covered by the usual planetary
parameters. Roll a D100 three times on the following table to determine
what the features are. If you get the same result (other than "No special
feature") twice, roll again.

Most features are restricted to planets with certain properties (for
example, the "Freshwater oceans" feature obviously requires an ocean
percentage greater than zero), or are incompatible with certain other
features (for example, a planet can\'t have both "High inclination" and "No
seasons"). Some features are sufficiently hazardous to human health that
they are restricted to marginal planets. See the detailed descriptions
below for explanations of the incompatibilities and prerequisites. If you
get an result incompatible with what you already know about the planet,
roll again.

ASTRONOMICAL FEATURES

Eccentric orbit: The planet\'s orbit is highly elliptical, producing
extremes of temperature at closest approach (periastron) and furthest
distance (apastron). Incompatible with "No seasons".

High inclination: The planet\'s axis is tilted by more than 45 degrees,
producing extreme temperature differences between summer and winter.
Incompatible with "No seasons".

High tides: A large, close moon or sun produces extremely high tides.
Requires either a K-type sun or at least one moon, and both land and water
areas to be non-zero.

Meteor storms: The planet suffers frequent meteor storms, often including
large asteroid or comet impacts, making the planet\'s surface a dangerous
place. Marginal planets only.

No seasons: The planet has close to zero axial inclination and orbital
eccentricity, so there are no seasonal effects. Requires a single star;
incompatible with "Eccentric orbit" or "High inclination".

Rings: The planet has a natural ring system.


GEOLOGICAL FEATURES

Radiation hazard: Radioactive minerals, or fallout from a nuclear war,
create a significant radiation hazard over large parts of the planet.
Marginal planets only.

Rugged terrain: The planet\'s land surface is almost entirely covered with
mountains and rough, rocky terrain, with practically no flat plains or
rounded hills. Requires a non-zero land area; incompatible with "Swampy
surface".

Volcanic activity: The planet has many active volcanos, enough to make life
dangerous over a large part of its surface. Marginal planets only.


HYDROGRAPHIC FEATURES

Freshwater oceans: The planet\'s oceans have very little salt in them,
either because they\'re geologically young or because some life form has
affected their composition. Requires both the land and water areas to be
non-zero. If the land area is zero and the water area is non-zero, this
feature is automatically present, independently of the special feature
rolls.

Many islands: The planet\'s land surface is broken up into a large number of
small islands, with no large continents. Requires both the land and water
areas to be non-zero.

Poisonous oceans: The oceans contain some contaminant or (more likely) life
form that makes the planet\'s sea water (and probably some of its fresh
water) poisonous to humans. Marginal planets only; requires a non-zero
ocean area.

Swampy surface: Most of the planet\'s land surface is low-lying and covered
with swamps, marshes, mud, quicksand, and so on. Requires a non-zero land
area; incompatible with "Rugged terrain".


ATMOSPHERIC FEATURES

Cloud cover: The planet has a permanent cloud cover over its entire
surface; it probably rains most of the time. Requires a temperature greater
than zero; incompatible with "Very thin atmosphere".

Toxic gas: The atmosphere contains some gas which is poisonous to humans,
making filter masks necessary. Marginal planets only.

Unstable climate: The climate undergoes severe and unpredictable changes
from year to year.

Very dense atmosphere: The atmosphere is dense enough to be unbreathable
without special respirator equipment, except perhaps on very high
mountains. Marginal planets only; incompatible with "Very thin atmosphere".

Very thin atmosphere: The atmosphere is too thin to breathe without special
respirator equipment, except perhaps in very deep valleys. Marginal planets
only; incompatible with "Cloud cover" or "Very dense atmosphere".


BIOLOGICAL FEATURES

Intelligent life: The planet has a native sentient life form, which may or
may not have advanced technology. Requires at least level III life;
incompatible with "Semi-intelligent life". Less likely with life below
level V (25% chance, otherwise roll again).

Semi-intelligent life: The planet has a native life form which is not fully
sentient yet, but comes close, and may develop further. Requires at least
level III life; incompatible with "Intelligent life". Less likely with life
below level V (25% chance, otherwise roll again).

World forest: The entire land surface (except ice caps, probably) is
covered by a single huge forest. Requires a non-zero land area, and at
least level II life.


ARCHAEOLOGICAL FEATURES

Ancient artifacts: Artifacts left behind by aliens, thousands or millions
of years ago, exist on the planet. The aliens may or may not have been
natives.

5. COLONISATION
----

5.1. SECTOR CHARACTERISTICS

Two characteristics need to be determined for an entire sector. First,
decide how "civilised" the sector is -- that is, how much contact it has
had with interstellar society in general, and how much development has been
done. Second, choose the "opening date" for the sector -- the date at which
colonisation of the sector began.

Ideally, these should be decided before you start, rather than generated at
random. The following table is a suggestion for those who want one.

    D100    Sector description  Initial colonisation
    ----  ----  ----
    1-30    Unexplored          D6x50 years ago
    31-60   Frontier            2D6x50 years ago
    61-90   Typical             (2D6x50)+250 years ago
    91-100  Developed           (2D6x50)+500 years ago


5.2. PLANET QUALITY

Habitable (Earthlike or marginal) planets can be rated according to their
desirability for human colonisation. Of course, aliens may have different
criteria; if your universe includes many alien colonies, you may have to
modify these rules.

Planet quality (PQ) ranges from 1 to 99 for habitable planets (a planet
rated 0 would be uninhabitable, and 100 is excluded on the reasonable
assumption that nothing is perfect). Start with a base value of 50, and
modify as described below. If the final result is less than 1, record it as
1; if it\'s more than 99, record it as 99.

    [*1: Depending on what sort of interstellar society your universe has,
    you may decide that the presence of intelligent or semi-intelligent
    life would place a world off limits to colonisation.]

(For the statistically minded, to save you some calculations: Earthlike
planets average 74, with standard deviation 15; marginal planets average
24, s.d. 18.)


5.3. COLONIES

The basic chance that a planet will be colonised depends on the sector
civilisation level:

    Sector type  Colonisation chance
    ----  ----
    Unexplored   PQ / 2 percent
    Frontier     PQ percent
    Typical      PQ + 25 percent (max 99)
    Developed    PQ + 50 percent (max 99)

Roll the percentage or less on a D100. If the result is a success, find the
date of colonisation:

    Colonisation date = Sector opening date + (100 - PQ) x D100 / 10

If the planet failed the original colonisation roll, or the date is later
than the present date of your campaign, then the planet is uninhabited, and
you can stop here.

Find out how much contact the planet has had with interstellar civilisation
since its establishment. Again, the following is just a suggestion, and
should be adjusted to suit your universe\'s historical background. The same
contact level should probably be used for all inhabited planets in a
system.

    Sector type  Die roll
    ----  ----
    Unexplored   D6-3
    Frontier     D6-1
    Typical      D10
    Developed    D6+4

    Result  Contact level       Population modifier
    ----  ----  ----
    0       No contact          -6
    1-3     Occasional contact  -2
    4-7     Regular contact     0
    8-10    Extensive contact   +2

Now determine the current population and technology level of the colony.
The population level is given by:

    Colony age     Basic population roll
    ----  ----
    0-99 years     2D6 + (PQ / 20)
    100-299 years  3D6 + (PQ / 20)
    300-499 years  4D6 + (PQ / 20)
    500-999 years  5D6 + (PQ / 20)
    1000+ years    6D6 + (PQ / 20)

Adjust for the contact level, and use the following table to generate the
actual population and tech level. See section 6 for a more detailed
explanation of the technology levels.

    Result  Population         Tech level roll
                               No contact  Any contact

6. TECHNOLOGY
----

This is a brief description of the tech level scale I\'ve used. Some very
approximate equivalents are given for two well-known SFRPG tech level
scales, from SJG\'s _GURPS_ and GDW\'s _Traveller_.

Obviously any dates beyond the end of the twentieth century represent
little more than wild guesswork. Even if you use my technology scale, you
may want to change the dates and descriptions for the levels beyond
present-day technology. In particular, the point at which FTL travel is
developed will affect the history of your universe deeply.

Note that, in the interests of making this system usable with the vast
majority of SF universes, I haven\'t made any allowance for the possibility
that FTL travel really is impossible...

    And so he set to do it
    He tried to do what "couldn\'t be done"

7. INTELLIGENT LIFE
----

Obviously any system for designing intelligent aliens has to be based on at
least as much personal preference and just plain wild guesswork as hard
facts. Anyone who uses this system is urged to take a careful look at it
first and make any changes you think will bring it more in line with your
version of the universe.


7.1. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

This is intended to be a generic system for generating intelligent or
semi-intelligent species. Some minor modifications may be required to fit
some details of the aliens\' home world, if you\'ve already generated it;
most of these should be obvious enough that I don\'t need to spell them out
(for example, if the planet has no life more advanced than invertebrates,
you can exclude the vertebrates from the "metabolism and body structure"
roll).

Find the normal environment of the species:

Use the first column for all flying creatures; otherwise, use the column
appropriate to the creature\'s body type. If there are two types of body
covering, re-roll the second if it comes out the same as the first.

Find the type of body symmetry and the number of limbs:

    D100                      Symmetry   Number of limbs
    Invertebrate  Vertebrate
    ----  ----  ----  ----
    1-20          1-60        Bilateral  4
    21-40         61-90       ...        6
    41-60         91-95       ...        8
    61-80         96-97       ...        (D6+4)x2

    86-95         99          Radial     5
    96-100        100         ...        D10+2

(If you\'re wondering why most of the creatures with radial symmetry have
five limbs, it\'s not just Earth prejudice; there are good engineering
reasons why five is the optimum number of limbs for a creature with radial
symmetry. Having an even number of body segments is a bad idea, because it
weakens the body by placing several continuous seams around it. A creature
with three arms would probably be unable to survive if it lost one; five
are much better for redundancy. There are some echinoderms on Earth with
more than five limbs, but not many.)

For creatures with radial symmetry, all limbs are assumed to be dual
purpose arm/legs. Flying creatures with radial symmetry are assumed to be
lighter-than-air, balloon-like creatures.

For creatures with bilateral symmetry, roll once for each pair of limbs,
except as noted below:

    D100    Type of limbs
    ----  ----
    1-10    Wings if flying; fins if amphibious or aquatic; otherwise legs
    11-50   Fins if aquatic (not amphibious); otherwise legs
    51-70   Legs
    71-75   Dual-purpose arm/legs
    76-100  Arms

For flying creatures, assign one pair of limbs as wings without rolling
(wings generated on the table are additional pairs). All intelligent
creatures will have at least one pair of hands (either arms or arm/legs).
If you get a result that violates any of these checks, start again. If the
creature has more than ten limbs, roll only for the first five pairs; the
rest are all assumed to be legs.

Find the creature\'s diet:

    81-100        71-100        31-100        Live-bearing

Find the average mass and size of the creature; roll 2D10 for land-dwelling
or amphibious creatures, 2D10+3 for aquatic creatures, or 2D6 for flying or
burrowing creatures:

    23      100 t   (2D6+5) x 1.6 m

For flying creatures and snake-like creatures (any non-aquatic creatures
without legs), multiply the size by 4. The size generated is the creature\'s
greatest dimension -- height for humanoids, length for most horizontally
oriented creatures, wingspan for flying creatures. Round the size to the
nearest 10 centimetres (or 5 centimetres if it\'s less than one metre).


7.2. SPECIAL FEATURES

This section covers the sort of features that many role-playing games treat
as advantages and disadvantages -- natural weapons, unusually fast or slow
speed, non-human senses, and so forth. Some features relevant to your game
mechanics will have already been generated, such as the ability to fly or
swim, extra hands, or whatever degree of natural armour is implied by the
creature\'s body covering.

Attributes such as strength, dexterity, intelligence and so on are too
game-specific to be covered here. You\'ll have to wing it.

Roll D6-3 to determine how many special features the species has. Then roll
D100 on the following table the appropriate number of times; re-roll any
repeated results. Some of the entries are double (e.g. "acute vision/poor
vision"); the two are mutually exclusive, and there is a fifty-fifty chance
of one or the other. The "acute" or "poor" senses are relative to human
senses (which is why there\'s no "poor smell" feature -- the human sense of
smell is pretty poor to start with).

I haven\'t included precise definitions of the effects of each of these
special features; any details beyond what is implied by the names would
have to be worked out to fit your particular game mechanics.

    [*1: If you\'re creating an intelligent species for an already-generated
    planet, the planet\'s surface temperature will affect the natives\'
    heat/cold tolerance. If the temperature -5 degrees or less, the natives
    automatically have cold tolerance, and have a 50% chance of heat
    sensitivity; ignore and re-roll any of the [*1] results. If the
    temperature is 35 degrees or higher, the natives automatically have
    heat tolerance, and have a 50% chance of cold sensitivity; ignore and
    re-roll any of the [*1] results. If the temperature is 0 to 30 degrees,
    generate as above.]

    [*2: Sonar implies acute hearing; add acute hearing to your list of
    features (don\'t count it towards the total), and ignore any other rolls
    of acute/poor hearing.]

Two other special features are determined separately: natural weapons and
speed.

The chance that the aliens will have natural weapons (claws, fangs, horns,
or whatever) is 20% for herbivores, 40% for omnivores, and 80% for
carnivores. This refers only to close-combat weapons; ranged weapons are
generated separately from the table above.

Roll 2D6 on the following table to find the aliens\' running (or swimming or
flying) speed, relative to human speed. Add 1 for carnivores. For land or
water creatures, subtract 2 if their average body mass is less than 10
kilograms. For flying creatures, don\'t adjust for mass, and double the
speed (the final multiplier, not the die roll).

7.3. PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE

The psychological profile of an intelligent species is described by a set
of six numbers: social, cooperation, aggression, exploration, technology,
and art. Each runs from 0 to 100.

Social: Indicates the degree of gregariousness and social organisation in
their civilisation. A social rating of zero would indicate a totally
solitary species with no social interaction at all; a social rating of 100
would indicate a hive-mind species with no concept of individual identity.
Some social contact is assumed to be required for the evolution of language
and intelligence, so a social rating less than 5 is not allowed in this
system.

Cooperation: Indicates how willing they are to cooperate with other
intelligent species. A cooperation rating of zero would indicate a totally
xenophobic species that refuses to even recognise the existence of any
other intelligent life; a cooperation rating of 100 would indicate a race
with no sense of species identity at all, making no distinction between
their own conspecifics and aliens.

Aggression: Indicates how warlike they are, both among themselves and
against other species. An aggression rating of zero would indicate a
completely pacifist species that never fought anyone for any reason; an
aggression rating of 100 would indicate a completely warlike species with
no interest in any other activity. For obvious reasons there will be a
negative correlation between the cooperation and aggression ratings (but
not completely -- for example, a species that enjoyed fighting and
frequently hired themselves out as mercenaries to anyone who needed
soldiers might have a high rating in both areas, while a peaceful but
isolationist species, such as Larry Niven\'s Puppeteers, would have a low
rating in both).

Exploration: Indicates their curiosity and interest in research and
exploring the universe. An exploration rating of zero would indicate a
species with no curiosity at all (since this seems incompatible with
intelligence, a rating of less than 5 is not allowed); an exploration
rating of 100 would indicate a species completely obsessed with exploration
or science.

Technology: Indicates their technological aptitude. A technology rating of
zero would indicate a species with no technology of any kind; a technology
rating of 100 would indicate a species obsessed with technology to the
exclusion of anything else. There is a strong positive correlation between
the exploration and technology ratings.

Art: Indicates what part artistic activities play in their society. An art
rating of zero would indicate a completely practical and utilitarian
species, with no aesthetic sense at all (to humans they would seem cold and
robotic); an art rating of 100 would indicate that aesthetic considerations
completely dominated practical ones (this would not be a survival trait,
which is why an art rating above 95 is not allowed). There is a negative
correlation between the technology and art ratings.

If the result is outside the allowed range, roll again.


7.4. TECHNOLOGY

To find a race\'s typical technology level, roll 2D10, add one-fifth of
their technological aptitude (from the psychological profile), and refer to
the following table:

Really simple to figure: K\'Kree max TL is 14 (module 2), Imperial is TL 15
(with a few worlds being either isolationist tl 16-17, or emergent tl 16 in
a few fields). Under Bk 5: High Gurad, and all later Traveller design
structures, the following limits are in force:

TL      Max J-n
15+     6
14      5
13      4
12      3
11      2
9-10    1

Thus K\'Kree max TL 14 indicates a J-5 max, while Imperial max TL 15
indicates a J-6 max. Figuring 35 jumps per year maximum operational speed,
that\'s a full sector of difference! Realize also that the K\'Kree structure
of government has fewer levels, and less interstellar autonomy, so
decisions need to be made closer to home in terms of turn around time, so
the k\'kree would operate closer to home.

William,
Thanks for the clue. I never noticed this about tech levels before and it
does make a huge difference. I guess I didn\'t find any text where this
inference was made. Makes sense for the K\'kree to lag behind the Imperials.

What is harder to explain is how the Imperium has lagged at TL15 for so long,
after earlier climbs. I guess a basic Traveller premise is that technological
change is not steady-and-upward, but that it can level off.

I don\'t really have trouble believing in a universe that is stagnating. It\'s
just that it seems like the Imperium is a culture that would be continuing to
progress technologically, and I don\'t see why it has hovered so long at and
near 15.

The Traveller background provides a number of historical events -- such as
the Long Night -- to stop tech progress or send it backward. What gets me is
how LONG things take.

However, our current rapid change could be seen as a historical
anomoly...after all, things did stay much the same for many thousands of years
of human history.

I think you send a message with the line:

in it to xboat-request@MPGN.COM. A program will read it and remove you
from the list. Be sure to send the message from the account that\'s

I hope that works; my memory is often muddled when it comes to

TL10 - Era of Stellar Exploration (2150-2300 TT; -3250 IC)

In 2150 Terrans discover the jump drive and a new era of stellar exploration
starts that is worth TL10. A 1 parsec jump now lasts only 69 hours. Terrans
spead to the stars. Better understanding of gravitation forces allows
gravitation control. Weather control possible.

    'body' => 'Hi!

Just read the queries about the backward nature of Traveller technology, and
I thought I\'d add my 2c worth --

The clues are all there in the pre-Virus material - and it boils down to this,
the Terrans (and the Darrians, which were Terran influenced *without* Vilani
contact) were able to make massive advances in the Interstellar Wars that led
to the collapse of the Nasu Sirka, and trashed the Vilani, who were not. The
difference was that Terran *society* was one where individualism and the idea
of progress were *not* the dirty words that they were in the Vilani Empire.
The Terrans would, quite probably, have completely transformed Vilani society
in the aftermath of the collapse, except for the treason of the Fleet, led
by Admiral Estigaribbia ... as they planned to subsume the Vilani Empire into
the Terran mainstream. While this would have been unpleasant in the short term
for the Vilani, it would have been much better in the long term - as the
increased technology that would have resulted from untrammlled Terran techno
research would have been much more than they could have expected themselves.

Unfortunately, Estigarribbia and the Fleet were obviously a minority (despite
their justifications that they "understood the plight of the conquered" -
obvious propaganda of no value) amongst the whole set-up, and *required* the
support of the Vilani bureaucrats to set themselves up. The "price" for such a
deal - up front *and* as part of the ongoing Vilani influence (domination would
not be too fine a point to put on it!) in the bureacracy - adoption of a whole
variety of Vilani social attitudes ... including the strictures against "too
quick" technological research.

It is likely, though difficult to tell for certain, that the Traitors had to
use Vilani bureaucrats and security personnel to help their occupation of the
Terran Federation, as they were (as already noted) in a tiny minority. Terran
society was thus placed under the control of the ultra-conservative Vilani, and
their iron hand crushed Terran inventiveness and progressive ideas. Sure, the
society was not completely vilanified, but it *was* modified enough that it
lost the "edge" that it had had.

There\'s a lot more, of course, and I have (modestly) put together a complete
alternative history for the Imperium and Terra from before the Interstellar
wars through to 1120 - one which completely deletes Virus and provides an
explanation for the whole backward mess that the Imperium is (and will, likely,
*always* be until somebody reforms its society - by crushing it).

A small number of extra copies are available at a modest cost, as are a number
of other supplements that provide advanced tech for Starship Design (based on
High Guard), Personal Equipment, Planetary Vehicles and, as I get around to it,
Starships and Military Weapons. If you\'re interested, drop me a line and I\'ll
answer questions and provide further details ... but, one up front, none of the
stuff is FF&S compatible, as the so-called "advanced" technology provided
there, though it certainly fits in with the backward Imperium, has no claim to
be "advanced" at all!

So I wondering...is there any software available that will create

I\'m looking for something that will generate new systems, not

program to, hopefully, allow some sort of configuration of
the factors going into the system\'s creation, for example allow
you to lower/raise average tech levels.  I\'ve found some that
create systems in a graphical, but non-UWP format.  What I want
are text listings like from the old Scout book that I can print

Frankly, I think the designers of Traveller couldn\'t (or more likely didn\'t
want) imagine too much super technology. Nobody probably expected the
importance and power of computers in the seventies. Even at TL15, most
societies in Traveller aren\'t very different to our todays Western society.

Technological advances are very important for our culture, but there\'s no
reason why all societies should give new inventions such a high priority.
Some say that technology stagnation is indeed stepping backward but is this
really true?

What\'s about this explanation: TLs higher than 10 are tied to progress in
jump technology only. I understand TLs as artificial classifications of some
Imperial bureau of Technology and perhaps they didn\'t thought inventions or
discoveries worth an overall TL16 classification yet.

I think, it\'s a flaw of Traveller, that low and high TL-world coexists and
no one tries to raise all world to the same high TL but perhaps Imperial
authorities realised that diversification is the real strength.

..as shown on earth in the Dark Ages in europe. Greek knowledge was
declared wrong by believe. (Because it cannot happen what shall not
happen...) However, other nations like the Arabian world, raises to new
highs in mathematics, medicine and astronomy in the same era.

Lately, I\'ve been thinking about bringing about the Fifth Frontier

Are there any adventures published that are set in the 5th Front.
War?

 Just to confirm, you\'re asking for a simple UWP, TNE-style?  Not
 the extended system profile that the DGP World Builder\'s Handbook
 set out?

 If that\'s what you\'re interested, contact me.  I have some old
 stuff lying around that I might even be able to find, written in
 Turbo Pascal, which, if I can find it, I can translate into BASIC
 or REXX for you (and for the rest of the list, if there\'s
 interest).

 Also, I note that TNE has two or three sets of rules, to cover
 worlds in the Reformation Coalition or similar polity, to cover
 Wilds, and to cover Regency.  There\'s a lot of overlap, though.
 Which rules are you looking to start with?  My recommendation
 would be based on what part of your Long Night your campaign is
 going to take place in - at the beginning, right after the
 Disintegration, use the Regency rules; in the middle, the darkest
 part of the night, use Wilds; and at the end, when Dawns, both
 real and false, are occurring, generate RC-type worlds.  There are
 other modifications you can use, such as the Hard Times rules, but
 you\'ll still need the program to generate the basic UWP.

 BASIC or REXX are, as I recall, supplied with OS/2.  Turbo Pascal
 (at least the version I used for those programs) generated DOS
 (16-bit) .COM files.
