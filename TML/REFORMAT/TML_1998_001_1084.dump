coming out from the galactic core.  It\'s ripping up Zhodani (psionic) society.
Its percieved by psions to be a woman holding a staff (which may be
technological) w/ a city and a couple of suns behind her.  It\'s a "pregnant"

    It moves at the speed of light and will eventually go through the space of
the former Third Imperium.
    The cause?  Well its been insinuated that even in a few thousand years it
won\'t be known what caused the Empress Wave.  Apparently it\'ll cause a
"flowering" of psionics and pretty much completely change the societies it
touches, human, alien and in between. : )  In the meantime, it\'s wrecking Zho
society and will make any existing psions reach for Migrane Drug(to put it

    You don\'t shoot down space craft, but you can shoot an unarmored
trooper who strays off, take his better gun, use to to shoot another,
better armored trooper, take his gun, and so on.
    This is the logic used by the USA when, during WWII, it airdropped in
Liberator pistols into occupied France.  These were single shot .45 pistols.

    There are mil-history buffs who can lecture you on long standing LIC
wars were folks several tech levels lower than the occupying force have
made that OcFor\'s collective life Hell.

   It is easy for the Imperium to bomb a planet (and it\'s population) flat
and then build over the ruins.  It is much harder to hold an populated
planet.  Remember that you don\'t actually control the ground, until a 19
year old kid with a rifle can stand on it (without getting cut down).

There\'s a lot of stupidity out there. Many gun control laws seem really 
pointless. I can\'t have a handgun in the city, but I can have an elephant 
rifle. Guns with bayonet mounts are outlawed----as if there has been a rash 
of bayonettings! Then, when the bayonet lugs are removed, people get 
outraged when they see that it\'s really the same gun. You\'d think they\'d 
realize this proves the original law was stupid! A lot of people who 
scream for more gun control have no idea what the existing laws are like.

I mean:

I don\'t like it. I can see why you might want it, but it seems to me (admittedly 
without actually playtesting it) like a needless complication. If you really 
have your heart set on this rule (and hey, it\'s your game, you can put anything 
you like in it), make it optional (since, on average, the damage is going to be 
the same whether you use it or not).

Well, yes. That\'s why it\'s rated as 2D6. If it could do more, it\'d be rated as a 
3D6 weapon.

Yes. That\'s what you get when you roll min or max damage.

Excellent idea. Actually, I\'d simplify it further by saying "just a nick" does 
min damage and crits do max, which means you end up rolling *fewer* dice.

My objection isn\'t to the reduction of women to baby machines -- which is,
after all, intrinsically part and parcel of the outdated heteropatriarchal
mode of production, etc. -- but to your reification of a specific, very
historically limited set of instances to represent "colonial society", as a
sort of ideal type.  Russian settlement of East Siberia (except for the
Maritime Province in the late 1800s) doesn\'t fit the picture you describe
above, either in terms of birth rates and growth or gender roles.  Neither
does Japanese colonization of Sakhalin/Karafuto.  Or Chinese colonization
of Inner Mongolia in the 1900s-1940s, or of Manchuria in the 19th century.


Or, if you want to go farther afield, is there any evidence that the early
demography of eastern Polynesia followed this pattern?  That the first
arrivals to a given island or island group were obliged to breed like mad
for the first few generations?

This sort of ties into what someone else was saying about Traveller
technology: we\'re tending to formulate "laws" and "basic necessities" on
whatever real-world data happens to be handiest or most currently visible.

Well, the point of not being able to store the energy for jump, or not being
able to supply the energy from outside, is to make jump gates impossible.
If you want to have jump gates, then dropping those restrictions is exactly
what you want to do.  To be like Babylon 5 you would also have to drop
the fixed week long period you spend in jump space and the restriction
on ships in jump space detecting and communicating with each other....

I didn\';t say trying to compromise the system. I said trying to compromise.
Either the rules improvement works or it doesn\'t. When someone says "make it
an option." he or she means... "I don\'t like it; leave it out." Saying that it
could be an option is damning it with faint praise.

Either it works or it doesn\'t. Either it fits or it doesn\'t. Saying keep it as
an option is looking for excuses to not use it.

Instead, there should be straightforward arguments that it doesn\'t work,
supported by logic.

<<What I believe he is saying

If it would work equally well with or without the +D-D, then there is no
argument against implementing it. That\'s what equal means (I understand there
is an underlying argument for simplicity here), but if it does work EQUALLY
well either way, then there is no argument against it.

I can\'t speak for T4, but this is not the CT explanation.  In fact,

Actually, it looks like they designed the ships to be like the olds
ones were in spirit. They were actually good, IMO. The problem was
that in the same space a TNE warship could have been a munchkin ship
with the straight FFS rules. It was a lack of playtesting problem.

In emergencies I can see this, but really, if they were as dangerous
as Himalayan mountaineering (1 in 10 dead) you\'d find it hard to
sell trips I bet. Hell, that\'s about the same as your odds in a B-17
over Germany in 1943.

Huh? So you\'re saying that no one would have missiles at all (cept
the navy), right?

Besides which a det-laser (nuke or chemical) can be used as a KKM.
Vs. an unarmed (or underarmed) target just tell your missile to keep
flying until it actually hits the target.  Another reason some kind
of det-laser will dominate since they can always be programmed to
work as KKMs (albiet expensive ones).

Is there a version for MSDOS (*not* Windoze!)? And if so, is it cheap?

Ummm, Michael, you are thinking TNE again. FFS2 p12 puts the power needed
to maintain a jump bubble at 0.252 MW per displacement ton, or 25 MW per
100 dtons. 500 dtons therefore requires 125 MW to maintain the jump bubble.

40 MW provides 8000 kN of thrust, given 0.005 MW/kN. A 500 dton civilian
ship should mass about 4000 tons. The argument then becomes is the hull
shape in QSDS a hypersonic streamlined hull. If it is, airframe thrust
efficiency will let it achieve orbit.

The alternative is just to add 10 000 kN worth of contragrav, which will
take up 40 m3 (3 dtons), mass 13 tons, need 7 MW, cost KCr 200 and take up
200 m2 on the hull.

I have the first edition of Mayday (ziploc bag) which specifies 100 minute
turns, and omits a hex scale.  From a 100 minute turn and 10m/s/s unit of
acceleration, the hex scale would be 180,000 km (6 BL/BR hexes).  

I like this scale, because it leaves room for multiple engagements on a
single tabletop.  A 300,000 km sensor can\'t detect anything past about 13
hexes.  The range DM for beam fire was -1 per hex, so most beam weapons
were limited to less than half a dozen hexes range.  Terrestrial sized
planets would not even block one hex and their gravity could be
effectively ignored.  Only gas giants would be large enough to affect
movement and LOS except in special cases. 

In such a game, HE weapons fire could be limited to ships on matching
vectors that approach to visual range.  A hundred salvoes or more could be
exchanged within a single turn.

Did the boxed Mayday alter the scale?


Thanks,
Clark

   OK, let me bottom line it for you.  All weak and not so weak attempts
at handwaving aside (sorry Mr. Backman), the system used to generate
star systems is ***broken***.  Actually, it was never *not* broken. 
Years ago it was realized that the tables used to generate stellar data
(which first appeared in "Book 6: Scouts" and were reprinted in each new
edition of Traveller) resulted in an inordinate number of white dwarfs,
bright stars, and systems like you describe that have Earth-like planets
that orbit stars that do not have practical habitable zones.  

   Nothing was done about it.  Why?  Astronomy as a subject is boring to
most people.  They would much rather spend their time debating the
relative merits of kinetic-kill missiles versus nuclear-powered
proximity blast laser types, whether or not tasks should use 1 die, 2
dice, or 3, what the effects are of near-C rocks, why Virus is
impossible using 20th century computer technology, or why Americans are
barbarians/the last freedom loving people on Earth because they allow
private gun ownership--you know, the *really* important stuff.

   There have been a brave few who have suggested fixes for all the
**broken** data that was generated using the **broken** star system
generation sequence, and their fixes have appeared here on TML and
elsewhere.  During the TNE era, GDW even went so far as to publish one
in Challenge that was created by Geo Gelinas, but it was a partial
solution at best.  So was GDW\'s methods for fixing the white dwarf
overabundance problem published in "Mod I, Mk I" of the basic TNE book. 
Naturally, none of GDW\'s publications during the TNE era took advantage
of the modest reforms they themselves introduced (look at the stellar
data published in the TNE sourcebooks, most of it the garbage generated
by DGP, and you\'ll see what I mean).

   "T4" of course has for the most part dodged the issue by not
publishing stellar data at all.  Well except in First Survey...

   There is a new star system generation system created for "T4" waiting
in the wings, ready for publication.  Because it deals with Astronomy
however, and is therefore less important than whether there were three
or four megacorps at the time that Imperial scouts first entered the
Spinward Marches, you\'ll probably never see it.

   What I would recommend to you is that you pick up a copy of Geo
Gelinas\' work (available on the Internet at Joe Heck\'s site), my work on
companion stars (ditto), a good Astronomy text (I recommend "Astronomy:
The Cosmic Journey" by Hartmann and Impey), and the book entitled
"World-Building: A Writer\'s Guide to Constructing Star Systems and
Life-Supporting Planets" by Stephen L. Gillet.  

   Using the star system generation sequence published in the basic TNE
manual (Mod I, Mk I) as a *guideline*, or the DGP sector data as a basis
to work from, create subsectors to run your campaigns in and then use
the above resources to modify the results so that they are more
realistic.  If you have questions, send them to the Astronomy newsgroups
on the Internet or post them here--somebody will eventually get around
to answering them.

   The right thing to do was to stop DGP from letting all that bad data
makes its way into the Traveller canon.  IMHO, it has been more a source
of problems than any "T-Plates vs. realistic thrusters" debate or not
having any data at all.

   There is no reason for the star system generation sequences to be as
broken as they are (c.1995) except laziness and total lack of interest
on the part of certain individuals.  A better system (one that took
scientific reality and game playability in mind) *should* have been
introduced but wasn\'t.

I hate replying to my own posts but I goofed.  The scale implied by a 100
minute turn and 10 m/s/s unit of acceleration is 360,000 km per hex (12
BL/BR hexes): 

Accelerating at 10 m/s/s for 6000 seconds yields 60 km/s of velocity.  A
ship moving at 60 km/s will cover 60 x 6000 = 360,000 km in 100 min.  I
had forgotten the initial-displacement difference:  during the turn in
which it accelerates, the ship will only cover 180,000 km (this effect is
always ignored for playability). 

In this scale, a 300,000 km sensor will only detect out to about 7 hexes,
not 13, and it only works really well at 1 hex.

This THUDDD was the first one which allowed comments to be made as part of
the voting process.  Here are the comments I collected on each design.
I\'ve left them anonymous, though authors are welcome to claim credit for
their comments if they wish to do so.

Ritestar II Merchantman (Richard Fields):

* A good, solid design - but nothing to make it stand out in a ground.
  I also question the choice of 2G engines... uneccessary for a
  merchantman, in my opinion.
* Interesting close defense turret
* Judging from the fuel listed for the HEPlaR Drive and the size of
  the power plant this design appear to come from a version of QSDS
  earlier than 1.5.  Other than using an outdated design system it a
  fairly decent design.
* A "to the wire" design that should make profits on this run (even
  without subsidy).
  Liked the close defence turret, \'cos this class of ship doesn\'t
  stand in-line to a serious warship.
  Would take serious FFS2 optimisation to beat this.
  Not really a PC ship because its too profitable:)
  This ship deserves to be encountered at every starport.
* This one just didn\'t grab me.  A little bland and character-free --
  which, on second thought, means it should probably get the government
  subsidy.
* Jump drive cost low by MCr 58. Maneuver drive volume and price wrong.
  Fusion plant smaller than allowed at TL10. Laser TL too high for
  controls? Fuel purification a good idea.  Nice to see someone trying
  a low-tech design! (Did this design use rules in T4 book?)
* Nice price.

Caravel class Subsidized Merchant (Walt Smith):

* Another good, solid ship. The presence of a air/raft and sickbay
  are appreciated - although I feel the space from the engineering
  shop could be put to better use on a small merchantman.
* Very nice
* This ship, like the Ritestar, is another good design that suffers
  from having been designed with a version of QSDS prior to 1.5.
  Either that or the power plant is too small.
* Just one little problem: a 500std ship needs 252MW to achieve
  Jump 2 :(
  Also, 3 gunners cuts into profitability - bring back the
  laser/missile/sand triple turrets of the lbb days.
  11 crew must be too high.
  Still, if you swap the fusion for F+ and 20 days supply, it
  should all work out:)
* I could picture this one the clearest in the role designated for
  it.  Good price, sounds reliable and eminently mass-producable.
* Power Plant of 0.8 (improper rounding above) too low for J2.  Cost
  far too low; 75% of jump drive and power plant cost is more than
  given ship cost.  Don\'t think volume adds up: fuel+cargo+passenger
  staterooms+turrets+hull = 500?  Air/Raft a good idea.  Thought
  about economics.  A good first effort; take a look at QSDS again
  to see where went wrong (be sure using version 1.5)!
* Power was a little short, too short for j2.

Starhopper C1a class Transport (Michael D. Peters):

* I find the inclusion of both Thrusters an HEPLar odd.  
* A good ship, I like the addition of lifeboats and the dining area.
  A little big, perhaps - and I don\'t really see the need for the
  heplar drives.
* none
* Much larger than is needed to meet the design criteria without
  giving any justfication why a larger and more expensive ship meets
  then design requirement better than smaller and cheaper ships.
* This ship really needs that subsidy - its too expensive.
  Also, whoever said Heplar was cheap spent 1MCr on Fusion+, not
  100MCr on Fusion.
  I like the inclusion of the lifeboats as an idea. Also, at least
  the "Light Lances" aren\'t the usual TL12 bug swatter. Another plus
  for remembering the contra-grav for high G planets. But needs more
  G-Comp if you turn on everything:)
  Finally, I thought cargo handlers were in real tons, not std, so 6
  ton is too small.
* Huge and expensive; cargo is slighted in favor of passenger capacity,
  which seems a dubious proposition given the set-up.  Overkill.
  Lifeboats were a good touch.  I\'d see this one in use, I suppose,
  but elsewhere: it doesn\'t suit the route as well as other designs.
* The biggest ship in competition, allows carriage of more passengers
  when available (I think there may on some legs of route). 8 G-hour
  HEPlaR drive and lifeboats an interesting luxury.  MFD provides good
  defense at a price.  More a passenger liner than a merchant trader.
  (Not necessarily a bad thing.)
* Too expensive.

Irup Khularan Subsidized Packet (Steven Bonneville):

* Since the design specs specified that the entire route needs to be
  served, I doubt the Imperium will approve of a design whose main
  claim to fame is the ability to skip the route.
* Its impressive that you managed to get jump three on the ship. I
  feel that a merchantman needs a sand dispenser, however.
* Would meet the specs exactly, except for the J3 instead of J2 and
  probably should have tried fitted in a sandcaster or 2.  However a
  good case is made for the larger jump drive.  Overall an excellent
  design.
* Plus points for the business plan.
  I remain unconvinced about J-3 and the hull seems too expensive -
  the AA spreadsheet gives <1MCr.
  This ship does need all the discounts and spec cargo it can get.
* Overkill with T-plates, military/fibre optic controls, J-3 drive.
  Like another design said, the RFD wanted all planets on the route
  served regularly; long legs aren\'t the point.
  But! It uses real Vilani language!!  Extra points for the good
  writeup and vivid description.  The Naval Aux. bit is a nice touch.
* My design. Was surprised to notice that jump-3 drive appears to
  improve profitability on the route more than it cost in credits
  and volume. Made a subtle error in economic analyis of the subsidy
  which made it appear less profitable than bank loan.  If ship\'s
  captain buys own hold space to ship speculative cargo as freight
  and keeps speculative and operating money separate (as in Traveller
  Adventure), the subsidy makes more money than a loan for the captain.
  I\'ll make the figures available later.
* Even if I like J3, it decreased the Closeness to spec.  Usability
  in a game: because of economy calculations.

Gunraa Ushniira class Modular Freighter (Andrew Akins):

* Odd little bird.  I like it!
* very nice indeed
* This is a very VERSITILE design.  However this competition is
  about a specific route in which the Gunraa Ushniira comes out
  being wastful.
* Its the standard problem with modular/multi role ships - they\'re
  too expensive and don\'t excel at anything. Ideal for PC\'s:)
  If you want a Q-ship, what about 100std batteries+100std Meson Gun
  in the cargo bay: factor 9 at 30kkm.
  I can see some companies buying this sort of ship, but not for
  this run.
* As description says, not efficient, but versatile.  Assuming one
  has local infrastructure...  Small modular vessels don\'t "click"
  for me in this role.  The launch seemed a fifth wheel.  Intriguing,
  though.
* Modules don\'t seem to have tonnage for  supporting hull?
  Interesting design clearly reminiscent of TNE\'s Aurora. Loss
  of space for grapples probably an economic liability. Subsidiary
  craft useful. Most flexible design, if willing to keep spare
  modules around.
* I like modular ships, even if its expensive, and therefor
  -Closeness to spec and -Overall design

Issaries class merchant (Douglas Berry):

* A good, solid design, with no obvious weaknesses, but no real
  outstanding features, either. The small craft is a nice touch.
* Very nice design, but a bit larger than needed.
* like the flying saucer approach - a simple solution to the
  horizontal/vertical deck problem.
  Its a bit big and expensive for the intended run.
  4 light lasers to protect 222MCr? At least they\'re not 1-0-0-0.
  A low crew number was also a good target to aim for.
* Almost my pick o\' the litter.  Good price for specified
  cargo/passenger and then some, without The 50-ton hangar seems
  unneeded... no explanation given.  Nice writeup, good
  justifications (anything based on _Forbidden Planet_ is fine
  by me).  Definitely a good one for PCs, like the designer says.
  But bigger than was really called for.
* Large ship concentrating on passengers instead of cargo. Would
  have liked to see closer look at economics. Well armed. Low
  berths aren\'t terribly profitable, but potentially useful for
  roleplaying purposes.
* Too expensive.

Kah Ryn\'soo Class Subsidized Merchant (Brian Songy):

* The best design in the group, I feel (my own included). I have
  no complaints at all, and I\'m impressed at all the design has
  in it. This is a great design...good job!
* Good design nice small and cheap.  Tons of cool things like
  Trade Offices and HazMat Cargo Bay.  But forgot to actually
  install weapons.
* Like the crew - small and focussed on trade. Multi skilling
  to avoid paying pointless gunners is a good thing.
  But where did all the money go?
  The coating discount in FFS2 is far too high and adds an est
  25MCr to the high total. Also the hull needs to be 20.
  Does follow the spec, but will need subsidy.
* My fave. Definitely more features than needed for the route,
  but vivid and convincing enough to win me over.  Probably the
  one I\'d be game. Still, not what I can easily picture a
  government subsidizing -- casinos? Armories? Brigs as crew
  quarters?  Hrm.
* Very cheap yet efficient design. Only has defensive weapons
  (but easily changed). Are the crew figures correct?
* The price is ok, and I like the casino.

Kebra Nagast class frontier liner (Michael Koehne):

* To be honest, the poor spelling detracted from my enjoyment of
  this design.
* A fairly standard ship, good design. I don\'t like the lack of
  an active sensor (even a short range one - I feel you need it
  for landing and such) and the 2G. I don\'t see why a merchantman
  needs to spend the space and cost on a larger unit.
* Nice designed mared by its lack of installed weapons or even
  sandcasters.  Deckplans are always appreciated.
* I was wondering why it was so expensive - Ah TNE.
  Not only is the crew double M:0 requirements, but they get a
  large stateroom each instead of sharing a small one.
  Like the Captain\'s lounge (but it is an expensive luxury) and
  would work as a PC ship \'cos its expensive to run:)
* Decent design/price that meets  specifications; the   selling
  point for this one is, to me, the background and history of it.
  Another one I\'d likely put in a game.
* Another inexpensive yet efficient design. Small craft are
  interesting. Not sure that would agree with ease of refitting
  suggested in descriptive text.

At the risk of making it harder for Marc Miller, perhaps the year 1998
with Traveller T4.1 could correct this oversight.  Also, perhaps it would
not be too late to "fix" the Milie 0 and First Survey books by making the
newer editions change the Dwarf systems to normal M class stars.  Any M6+
stars could then be fixed to have normal atmospheres changed to exotic
atmospheres.  Also, a new "needed" trade classification could now include
those kinds of places that require Environmental support such as biodomes
and such.

  Also, perhaps a few volunteers could volunteer to redo the sector
information in a more scientifically correct manner.  As such, I
personally would be willing to work an a Sector - entering it in by hand
as an ascii file, with the corrections needed.  It may well be advisable
for the rank and file population of Traveller players, to already create a
new trade classification:

Ls = Biodome world, this world is totally hostile to human life.
Populations would not exist on this world except as prison farms, mining
colonies, or as a refuge where no one would expect exists.  Populations
should never exceed TL-2

  Just some thoughts to poke out for consideration...

Which would range from -1 to 9. What physical reality is modelled by
a damage of -1?  I see the point you\'re making (and like the idea)
but it seems like the range might as well be from 1 to something
since zero or less is modeled by missing the to-hit roll.

I had been thinking of a similar system for space combat since it
takes hits from some grazing value to a maximum into account.  So
you shoot 100 rounds into space near the target and roll a hit. The
damage is then from 1 shot grazing (damage =1) to maybe several
shots hitting dead on (damage = 16 (on 3d6-2, say)).

Anyway, it is very simple and produces the right range of values
(from 1 to whatever) for damage (and includes zero with the to-hit
roll).

For what it\'s worth, Geocities and other \'free\' webspace providers operate
virtually the same way. I have surfed many such sites and the annoyance
factor IMHO is minimal. The price is right, so I say go for it. You never
know some of that advertising might actually be informative. :-P

Did you ever try TIBASIC (Texas Instruments) for use on the infamous TI-99- 4A

    'body' => 'Hello Folks,
  I wish to take this moment to say thanks to those who responded to my
questions regarding the planetary generation system with respect to
Traveller.

  As was noted, the system is slightly, er, bent <grin> with two separate
situations that could result from it.  The first, is that those who don\'t
know anything about Astronomy, or have access to the later editions of
science fiction games, can be happy (after all, ignorance is bliss).
Those who know enough about what is broken, and easily enough fix it
<grin>.

  For now, I suspect I will just change the Stellar type from M9 to M2 or
something of that nature for the planet that I am currently running my
group on.  Originally, I started off creating a basic program that would
generate information based on a 3D map of the near earth vicinity.  I
even spent 5 days trying to download the HIPPARCOS data (some 50 meg) in
the hopes of having a really decent database to work off of <chuckle>.
But as fate would have it, I came to be bogged down in some things in real
life, and came to salivate over the idea of a GURPS TRAVELLER coming out,
so I went out, purchased Milieu 0 hardcover, Pocket Empires, FF&S2 in the
hopes that I might enjoy creating a GURPS TRAVELLER Hybrid until it came
out for real.

  Currently, I am using the concept that the players are part of a
privatized mercanary outfit currently being trained by the Imperial forces
as a favor to a Senator.  They were sent to Irurk as a part of a
Battledress Jump training exercise that happenes to run afoul of a Vargr
incursion.  The Incursion was the work of an enemy pocket empire in the
hopes that the Vargr would be blamed for the incursion, not the Pocket
empire...

  In any case, currently, the players are using Battledress (in GURPS
terms, Battlesuits) attempting to figure out just what the Vargr are up
to, and try to get enough information for the rest of the company of
battlesuits to jump down in an attack.

  The only thing the Vargr are trying to do, is steal some jump drives,
computers, and anything else small of value, destroy the jumpdrive
production facilities, and get away.  They have thus far destroyed the
Highport, and are working at loading some cargo ships before demolishing
the lowport and production facilities.

  Well, thanks again folks for listening and commenting on the "sin" of
traveller <grin>.

Making it Win 95 "compatible" means that it is *incompatible* with
anything else. I can\'t run Win 95 on my current equipment. And I see
*lots* of folks who have their system crashing on a regular basis when
using Win 95.

DOS is still the "lowest common denominator".

to run Traveller software.

Because if you are sending an STL ship on a journey that takes a

But it makes *quite* a difference in the *distribution* of the hits.

Actually, as has been pointed out, you can simplify things to:

add 2 dice to the number of dice rolled.
add dice together
subtract 7

With STL travel *all* trips are "one way". Even if it takes only a few
years ship time, it\'s going to take *decades* each way. The folks who
sent you off will likely be *dead* before you return.

And given the fuel required, the colony won\'t be *able* to send the
ship back.

Peter Hamilton\'s recent SF books have older spacers with almost completely
artificial bodies, able to operate without a vac suit.

WRT implants, given the fascination of some with bionic and cybernetic implants,
replacements, prosthetics etc., I\'m kind of suprised we haven\'t seen a supplement
along these lines, indexed by TL.  After all, if we can use artificial hearts to
day, what about TL 12?  State of the art prosthetic hands give temperature and
pressure sensors.  When can I get my superdense-alloy skeleton with requiste
retractable claws?  :-)

Actually, what you\'ll have *won\'t* be "embryos". They\'ll be fertilized
eggs. There is a difference. But for most mammals, you are talking
about something smaller than a pinhead. Allowing for "packaging" to
allow extracting individual eggs, I\'d say that you\'d wind up with
something about the size of a .22 cartridge, simply for ease of
handling. And for the animals, it\'ll probably contain several eggs. How
many depends on typical "litter" sizes for the species.

One of A. Bertram Chandler\'s stories has people on a gaussjammer (an
early form of FTL drive in his universe, subject to getting knocked
*way* off course occasionally) that\'s had to put down on a not very
hospitable planet. At one point, some of them raid the egg storage
because of hunger. They are convicted of cannibalism....

Chandler\'s stuff doesn\'t fit the Traveller universe very well, but it\'s
*good*. And he *does* have plot ideas that can be swiped. One involves
a ship with poor shielding that crashes on an isolated planet. Due to
the poor shielding, the rats onboard have mutated considerably. The
crash occured while they were trying to take over the ship! And tey
wind up getting the upper hand on the surface. This results in worlds
occupied by a *nasty* spacefaring species. 

In Traveller terms, they\'re a minor race since they didn\'t develope
star travel on their own. But they\'ve got it, and they are expanding...

But since it needs at least semi-refined fuel, you are even *better*
off with horses or some other draft animal. Then all you need is the
forge, and fodder. As some author (Heinlein?) said "Horses make more
horses. Tractors need factories."

And as I pointed out years back, one thing that a colony will likely
have is some sort of "library". Possibly using microfiche and the
handheld readers that merely require sunlight to use. The library will
have instructions on how to build *any* item their civilization has
ever had. It\'ll list the tools and materials required, and how to use
them to produce the item. It\'ll also list how to produce the tools and
materials, with similar specs. 

With such a library, a moderately hospitable environment, and time, you
could work your way up to anything.

There\'s no way a colony is going to start out with 10 million people.
On the other hand, 10 thousand is both workable, and likely large
enough to maintain an adequate tech level on its own. It\'ll be a *low*
tech level, but it\'ll be *maintainable*.

Aside from gear used in the initial setup of the colony, no colony is
going to *depend* on gear that can\'t be *replaced* locally. They\'ll
have and use higher tech stuff, but they don\'t dare *depend* on it.

Assuming you needed your car to get to work every day, would you buy a
car where if it broke down, you\'d have to send away for parts and wait
a month or two for them to show up? Somehow I don\'t think so.

So if it\'s your *life* rather than your *convenience, you are going to
be a lot more careful.

You\'ve missed the important point. It was a major breakthroug to
*realize* that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter was a
*constant*. Until you come up with that flash of insight, there\'s no
*point* in comparing the measurements.

And in any case, the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is only
pi in Euclidean geometry. Pi is a far more *fundamental* constant in
math. The value comes up in places that have nothing to do with
circles. One example is that i^i = e^(-pi/2)

Sorry, that\'s *never* been true. The position on the periodic chart is
related to atomic *number*, which actually *is* an integer value. It
turned out to be the number of protons in the nucleus, but originally,
it was a property having to do with xrays bouncing off the material.
And that was discovered long *after* the periodic table had been
established (based on chemical & physiscal properties).

Nope. The measurements of atomic weight just kept getting more
accurate. And from the *beginning* it was clear that they weren\'t
integers. You see, one of the more common element (I seem to recall it
being Chlorine) had *two* fairly common isotopes, which resulted in a
mass of xxx.5 for the very *earliest* attempts to measure atomic
weights.

> We tend to find what we are looking for.

Except that contrary to what you think, science has generally
progressed by someone *expecting* to find one thing, then finding
something else and folks then trying to figure out *why* he got the
wrong answer.

One of the classic examples is the Michaelson/Morley experiment. They
set up some gear to measure the speed of light, with great accuracy, in
two directions at right angles to each other. Their intent was, by
doing so at different times of day, to measure the motion of the earth
through the ether. Put they kept coming up with results that said light
was traveling at the *same* speed in all directions.

This made *no* sense at all, because the earth is rather obviously
moving. All sorts of things were tried to "explain away" the problem.
The "final" solution was relativity.

Same sort of thing happened with Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, the
phlogiston theory in chemistry, etc. Folks expected one thing, and
found something different. And by trying figure out *why*, the came up
with new knowledge.

You should probably quote a *little* of the text you refer to
(admittadly requests usually run the other way around :-) since I\'m
not sure what you mean.

Oh, I *do* know what you mean! HE has been thrown around for "High
Energy" weapons. This refers to Plasma and Fusion guns. Specifically
for use on spacecraft.

This is the "work for hire" doctrine.  If it was within the scope of you
employment, you probably would lose any case.

Well, thats not a bad idea, but it would certainly be confusing to the
company.  Their lawyer would (or rather \'should\') have to research the law in
that jusridiction concerning licenses, transferability of, and duration of.
But since the work is a literary work (and thus subject to copyright law), in
the US, most courts will have to use copyright law instead, because federal
copyright law pre-empts all state laws on the matter.  Additionally, they
might consider the non-transferability to be impermissable because its
unfairly restricts business.

For general outline of copyright issues in the US (maybe some UK stuff too),
check out   http://www.lawgirl.com  trust me, its a good sight.

Maybe I misunderstood the topic.  I assumed that the databases would be only
one or another not mixed.  The hex/log digit I proposed was only to
delineate how old the data was.  It seems sensible to me that a scout or
explorer or merchant would have some kind of idea as to how old the data he
was looking at.  Unless of course someone screwed up the transmission along
the line.  ;-)

And just *where* are you reading that the seafaring peoples said this?
The world has been *known* to be round for something like 3000 years.
This size was first measured well before Christ was born.

> I maintain that people find what they look for!

And as I pointed out in another message, history proves you wrong. 

Heck, if you were right, the world would only be 18,000 miles in
circumference and Columbus would have reached China as he intended to
instead of discovering the Americas.

And yes, *that* was where Columbus differed with his contemporaries.
Everyone *agreed* that the world was round. Columbus just argued for it
being much *smaller* than it actually is.

Please take the trouble to find out what happened in the past rather
than making silly *assumptions* that can easily be shown to be false.

Sorry, but pi being 3 has consequences. And they don\'t have to do with
circles getting bigger. It require *extreme* curvature of space. 

BTW, there *are* no historical references to pi being three. Before the
*concept* of there being a *constant* ratio between circumference and
diameter, they\'d refer to the size of a circular object by the
diameter, by the circumference, or even by *both*. They didn\'t *expect*
there to be a relationship between them.

Thus you find things like the reference to the "molten sea" in the
Temple in Jerusalem being 2 cubits across and 6 cubits around. If they
had the *concept* of Pi, regardless of value, they\'d have known that
they only had to specify *either* the circumference *or* the diameter,
and they\'d have fully described it. But they gave *both* because they
didn\'t know that they were related.

There are quite pronounced differences in how people *thought* between
modern and ancient times. So much so that most moderrns can\'t
understand the ancients.

No, while it was never done on the original show, it *was* mentioned in
several reference works that are considered rather authoritative. I
think one of them may have been the writer\'s guide, but I can\'t be
certain as I never had one.

That\'s right. It wasn\'t intended to land, but it was (supposedly)
intended to be able to limp along on impulse and maybe reach somewhere
safer.

Marc, 

Like I said, I like the concept of the +/- 5, but I was a little concerned
about the added rolling.  I played around with it this evening and quickly
a question came to mind.

Have you decided to change the way damage is applied?  I *thought* damage
was going to be applied one die at a time to the 3 physcial
characteristics, 

Example

STR 9
DEX 6
END 8

You take 2d damage

You roll a 2 and a 4

And choose to subtract 2 from STR leaving STR 7

and 4 from DEX leaving DEX 2

End Example

With this new method you\'d have had 2d+(+d-d), or roll 2 and 4 then +6-4.
The *total* would be 6+2 or 8, but how could you apply each of the dice to
a characteristic?  Which die does the +2 add to?  Or do you plan to take
the entire roll off one characteristic now?

Well my reasoning behind this is a little kown rule from CT-High Guard &
MT.  That when the jump capacitors of a ship are filled then that ship my
jump.  It does not say that you needed to use the fuel or not.  When in
doubt don\'t modify.

Jump capacitors in CT & MT, bubba.  Its canon so try to refute me.

One solar cell does not, but large amounts of solar cells would.  As for
generation of huge amounts of energy, well a star is a hugh fusion reactor.

Merrick, this isn\'t a shot, it\'s a serious question.  Where and when did
the *fact* of "peace maintained by squadrons of huge Battleships" take
hold?  It wasn\'t apparent in the 3 LLBs, it wasn\'t in the CT adventures,
and as you say it wasn\'t in HG.  I haven\'t gone back and checked JTAS, did
it take hold after the FFW?  Was it during the MT era that the
multi-hundred thousand ton BBs became orthodox?  As I\'ve written about I
didn\'t buy many of the MT books, staying with CT for flavor, setting and
feel.  It was a surprise for me to see the sizes of some of the MT and even
TNE era ships.

Wasn\'t AHL about 10,000 tons?  I remember that as being a *huge* ship, it
was a full-blown cruiser in my time!  Heck, to me, a BB would be 20 to 30
ktons, not ten times that volume!

My one and only experience with a "jam" was when the SKS I was firing
misfired. Best guess is an underpowered round, plus a bit of grit on
the cartridge. So the case didn\'t eject, nor did the next round feed. 

But from *my* point of view, it seemed to have cycled ok, and then
failed to fire when I pulled the trigger. In other words, a
"hang-fire". Not the most pleasant thing in the world to deal with. 

Speed was *not* a consideration... :-)

Well, one solution is that the atmosphere was formed by primitive life
while the planet was still young. At that time volcanic activity would
keep things warm enough. After that, the life can try to adapt as the
planet cools off. And as long as the planet is tectonically active and
has something approaching oceans, you\'ll have things like the critters
around deep ocean vents. As well as bacteria living in hot springs. 

Frankly, I think we should divorce atmosphere *density* and atmosphere
*composition*. 

To the best of our knowledge, planets start with an overwhelming ly
hydrogen atmosphere. In the inner system, the hydrogen is quickly lost
except for the amount that can be tied up in compounds. Carbn, nitrogen
and oxygen are the elements available for such compounds.

This gives you an atmosphere and "hydrosphere" composed of water(H2O),
ammonia(NH3), and methane(CH4). UV from the star will split the
molecules in the upper atmosphere over time. The hydrogen will be lost.
So you wind up with oceans of water with various nitrogen and organic
compounds. And an atmosphere that\'s mostly N2 and CO2. And a lot of
carbonate minerals as the CO2 combines with water vapor to make dilute
carbonic acid rain which reacts with the rocks.

That\'s the sort of atmosphere that Venus, Mars and Earth all had. Venus
was too hot and the heat caused CO2 to be released from carbonate
minerals, which increased the heat until the vicious cycle wound up
with the current situation. 

Mars lost a lot of atmosphere because it was too small too hold onto
it. And then as the pressure dropped, the water evaporated, got broken
up in the upper atmosphere (and later, even at ground level as the air
kept thinning). And as the planet cooled the CO2 started freezing out
at the poles (yep, part of the Martian polart caps is dry ice!). 

And earth had mostly nitrogen, with a lot of CO2, and some water vapor.
Then that soup left in the oceans resulted in life. The single celled
forms lived by breaking down the chemicals the UV had formed, or
extracting energy by "oxidizing" minerals (chemosynthesis). Then
came the invention of photosynthesis. And things changed "overnight". 

The oxygen level in the atmosphere increased from a mere trace to
present levels or even higher in a geological eyeblink. And this
reacted with all sorts of minerals, weakening them. Things like sulfur
and nitrogen oxides made far more "acid" rain than before. Whole
mountain ranges eroded far faster than before. This plus the
chemosynthetic bacteria are responsible for a lot of mineral deposits!

Eventually things stabilized as they are now. 

But the point of all of this is than many planets are going to have
"earthlike" temps and pressure, and *no* free oxygen. Just that
nitrogen and carbon dioxide atmosphere. And they may actually be
*desirable* because of surface or near surface deposits of minerals
that can only form deep in the ground on planets with an oxygen
atmosphere.

1 Joule = 1 Watt for 1 second. The 64 megajoule per m3 per parsec is for
jump one. Ooops, you\'re right. The ship needs another 60 MW or so of power.

Thrust is in kilonewtons. Megawatts power the m-drive, which creates the
thrust.

The 10t/dton rule is also a "guideline" to cover massy, heavily-armoured
ships and thin-skinned freighters. It\'s part of why I prefer using FFS -
you get complete details.

The short answer is "Traveller doesnt do cyberware".

The longer answer is that the presence of such things in members of society
helped the fractionation of humaniti during the Rule of Man, and is
therefore avoided by all right-thinking people, and discouraged by all
right-thinking governments. Anyway, most to all the neccessary knowledges
and technologies was lost during the Long Night.

The 3rd Imperium is therefore down 2 TLs in cyberware, and it has strong
social and political restrictions on it\'s use.

The Solomani have fewer scruples, however. But rest assured SolSec will be
keeping careful records on any privately-owned implants.

Maybe a notation for a "comment line"? Say that any line that starts
witha C is a comment and applies to the hex immediately above it. Any C
lines at the very start of the file apply to the whole file. 

This is easy to implement, and it\'s easy to strip out the comment lines
if you are using software that doesn\'t recognize them.

On the other hand, I\'ve always seen low passage as letting the low
berths that you ALREADY HAVE earn some money. Using them for hauling
some animals is possible. Using them as a place to stash small cargo
items is *not* a good idea. Too much chance of damaging something and
too little usable space.

That doesn\'t eliminate "canon". It just gives you 4 different canons.
Canon is, *by definition*, the "sum" of the authoritative works.

So when you jump you spray the fuel outside into space around your ship? 
LOL, what a bloody joke.  Next thing they will tell is that when you use
the jump drive the crew & passengers drink the fuel to maintain a "real
space" "jump bubble".  If this is the standard for T4, thank god I quit
buying after MT was ended.  TNE looked like unrealistic garbage.  T4,

Babylon 5 has invaded the TML in the form of me.  I like Babylon 5, you got
a problem with that?

As for a book or supplement that you don\'t know about, well I had the
thought of placing jump gates into Traveller ever since I bought CT 0, 1,
2, & 3, & thought, "Well if a jump drive weighs so much & uses so much fuel
why not use controlled wormholes?", but we will not get into my background.

I thought of a form of controlled wormhole a long time ago, but Babylon
5/B5 (I hate Bab5) just gave me the name.  As for what book I used, well I
used what I thought all gamers have, my brain & imagination, looks like I
was wrong.

<rant>
Do gamers need to be spoon fed ideas now a days?  I remember when I started
to game CT many years ago & all you had were the rulebooks (0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
& 5), a sector (Ley Sector from JG & I still have a copy of it), a GM
(Steve Crow, yes the man who helped to write alot of JG products), &
several players.  So what the phuc is up with you gamers today?  You want
all the information spoon fed to you.

Yes, I was a playtester at Judges Guild.  Yes, I lived in Decatur, IL. 
Yes, I know the school in which JG was based out of (Sunnyside).  Yes, I
knew Steve Crow, Rick Randel, Chuck Denning, & Bob Bloodsoe <sp>.  I used
to work at JG as a cashier/gopher for afterschool cash.  I also was a
playtester for some of the stuff that came out of JG.  I also know the real
reason JG went under.  So I am prob. on of the "oldest" gamers on this ML.

If you are running the game, you do all the rolling.  When you play my mail

With a Bussard ram scoop on the new design, if one of the auxiliaries were
streamlined and equipped with scoops, they could refuel the ship.  Even if
the destination were 15 LY away, the return trip would be let\'s say 17 years
there, 6 years to unload, 17 years back, 40 years, maybe some of the people

Phil,

Good idea.  I hadn\'t thought of that.  Such a system would be an excellent
failsafe in case of disaster.  Even though the eventual goal would be to
establish a colony on the surface, having the ability to produce food while
sourting out the adaption to the world is a tremendous advantage.  This has
to be considered a high priority item.  If it were capable of supporting
about 100 people, it would be able to support the scientific staff prior to
colonists awakining from cold sleep.  It would relax the need to get people
on the ground to produce food at arrival.  Thus, some of the major problems
can be sourted out prior to a single colonist being put at risk.

Sorry but the way to calculate hexes from gameturn lengths (if you want 1G
equalling 1 hex of vector change that is) is hex = a*t^2 not the physics
textbook s = 0.5*a*t^2.
Why is that? Do some gameturns of contiuous acceleration and check
distances travelled:
Turn    Speed   Distance        s=0.5*t^2
1       1       1               0.5
2       2       1+2=3           2
3       3       3+3=6           4.5
4       4       6+4=10          8
5       5       10+5=15         12.5
6       6       15+6=21         18
7       7       21+7=28         24.5
etc
Notice that s=0.5*a*t^2 approaches Distance when playing over several gameturns.
If s=0.5*a*t^2 formula was used the ships would travel half as far as they
would in reality over several gameturns and as MayDay et al are played over
several gameturns the correct formula is s = a*t^2 or as the actual case
is:
Each gameturn the ship increases speed with

dV = a*t

and then it travels at that new speed for the turn:

s = dV * t = a * t * t = a * t^2

As the timescale given was 100 minutes = 6000 s and we round 9.81 to 10
m/s^2 then each hex represents 10 * 6000^2 = 360 000 km or about 1
lightsecond.
Hopefully somebody understand this as when I read it myself it seems more
convoluted than necessary. The compact version of the above is:
If gameturn = t then each hex of acceleration a should be s = a * t^2

Thinking about this overnight... if the purpose of the +D-D rule is to
extend the range of possible damage results, then for combat this could be
achieved the same way that many other systems do it, i.e. by critical hits
(you do more or better damage) or fumbles (something bad happens). I see
two advantages to this approach:

1) The concept is already familiar to most gamers, one less thing to
learn/remember.

2) Potentially it eliminates a step, as the critical hit/fumble is
determined by the \'to hit\' score rather than by rolling +D-D. You have to
roll to hit anyhow...

I hope that you are being too pesamistic here but I suspect that you are
right Harold.

Please publish it, or make it available, yourself if nothing else.

I think that we need to have an accurate star generation system in
Traveller for two basic reasons.

1) Willing suspension of disbelief in the current, inaccurate, system
severely strains my mind.

2) One of the things I like best about Traveller (besides playing
slightly eccentric charecters) is creating worlds.  I prefer to do this
using MT\'s World Builders Handbook.  Almost all the times I create
planets, even ones that are purportedly in the "habitable" zone I end up
with them having an average temperature of -113 C or 71 C.  I usually
end up having to 1) change the planets orbit 2) really mess with its
greenhouse effect or 3) explain how the temperature has affected the
society.

I would like to see a backwards compatible accurate system generation
method.  It would need to say something like "This planet C 567123-9 is
habitable and therefore it probably orbits a star of this stellar range,
roll on this table" and "This planet C213567-9 is not habitable,
therefore roll its sun up on _this_ table."

I feel very strongly about this subject, I am tired of constantly
handwaving away iceworlds.

Look at Leroy Guatneys site at:

http://ouray.cudenver.edu/~lwlguatn/astro.html

or more specifically at

http://ouray.cudenver.edu/~lwlguatn/SF/egs.html

for a good attempt at both teaching Travellers about some astronomy
concepts as well as trying to fix the generation tables in Scouts and its
descendants.

David Brin, Bob Shaw, Piers Anthony, Robert Silverberg,
Poul Anderson, (I could go, the list is quite extesive, on but I

In case you didn\'t notice, you are speaking in a public forum.  And

IIRC it was in Supplement 8, Library Data, that the first mention of the
Battle Rider/Battleship argument was mentioned. The tone was that the
Imperial Navy had for a long time been using BBs, but in the last few
decades had switched over to BRs.

In CT it made a big difference to ship cost whether a ship was jump-capable
or not. Later versions of the rules made the cost difference less
important, but the bigger hulls, new armour and weapons (especially spinal
mounts), and power plant rules gave a real combat performance advantage to
SDBs (an idea first mentioned sometime around JTAS 7 in the original "SDB"
article). So ton for ton, an SDB/BR has always been better, either because
it costs less or has more teeth.

Until, that is, you start losing the battle. Now your BRs/SDBs have to
either go to ground, find a fragile mothership and dock before it jumps
(under fire), or surrender. Your battleships jump out, and live to fight
again.

IMHO, what players are interested in is hexes and mainworld stats. At least
mine are. I spent years fidgeting with system generation rules and
programmes, and eventually concluded that Marc had this important stuff
right all along. If anyone wants an explanation for it now, I do a handwave
that says "we only show habitable worlds, and those orbit single
main-sequence stars with luminosities between 0.4 and 2.0. That\'s about 5%
of stars, and the maps don\'t show the rest because nobody goes there"; and
another handwave that says "you travel through jumpspace, and the nature of
jumpspace is such that it is OK to represent it as a 2D map". I had some
technobabble for that once, but then I came up against an astrophysicist
who out technobabbled me, so I gave up. :-)

The implications of the handwaves are that (1) a hex is probably 3-4
parsecs instead of one in my game, and (2) that a sufficiently determined
jump-1 ship captain can cross, or hide in, empty hexes by wilderness
refuelling at gas giants and iceballs. If he can find out where they are...
it ain\'t canon, but it works for me, and without making any real difference
to the game.

You forgot average values and ranges:

This could work.  I\'d limit it to simply d3 damage weapons and do away with
the extra "+D -D" stuff that I don\'t particularly like (There-- I admit
it!).

Glenn\'s got a good point (I feel like Gilligan :)

True, it does modify the bell curve of the various dice combinations.  But
I don\'t believe that this is what Marc wishes (otherwise, the rule would
apply *all* dice rolls-- including tasks).

He could also be saying that "Some players may not like it; make it

Of course.  But if leaving out a rule "that works" speeds up game play, why
not make it optional?  This may be an excuse, but it is a valid one.

OK.  I will base further discussion purely on the rule\'s technical merit.

Yes there is an argument against implementing it.  Star Fleet Battles is an
excellent board/table-top game.  It has a whole slew of rules that are all
excellent in themselves and which work together as well.  But with so many
rules to digest, some of them were given the tag: "optional".  This wasn\'t
an excuse not to use an excellent rule or two.  It was intended to allow
players to choose the level of complexity that they wanted to use.

I\'m not a doctor, but as I understand it, gas bubbles in the blood can be
deadly. But, I suspect, not always. I understand that \'the bends\' can be
excruciatingly painful, but is usually survivable.

I also assume that a TL12 sickbay has some method [hands waving furiously]
of dealing with ebullism in the few minutes available before a gas bubble
gets into your brain and kills you.

"Vac burn" is just a form of surface bruising. Shouldn\'t affect the brain
at all. A serious case will make you pretty ugly, however. Hence my

Agreed. I\'m slowly putting together a list of such body mods for my game. I
plan to provide opportunities for the PCs to acquire them during chargen. A
failed Injury roll, for instance, might result in a prosthetic arm. Note,
however, that limb regeneration is TL 11 and thus fairly common in
Traveller. For someone to chose an artificial limb or organ, it would have
to have expanded capabilities, such as you suggest.

The fun thing with retractable claws, of course, is when you roll a
Spectacular Failure and they get stuck, extended. There\'s an incidental
character in Jack Womack\'s novel _Elvissey_ who is an obvious parody of
Bill Gibson\'s "Molly"; her finger-blades won\'t retract any more, and she
can\'t afford to get them fixed. This makes the simplest actions, such as
opening doors or typing, virtually impossible and extremely hazardous.
Hilariously sick guy, that Womack.

    'body' => 'Marc,

I\'ve been following the discussion of nD+D-D with much interest. After some
consideration, I\'ve decided I\'m not keen on this new damage rule.

Let\'s consider the pros and cons...

PROS:

1) nD+D-D adds a bit of realism: it means that even a 1D weapon can
sometimes do up to 11 points damage. And sometimes it will glance off a
belt buckle or some such, doing no damage. But most of the time, it will
still do 1 to 6 points damage.

2) It\'s easy enough to remember, whether as nD+D-D, or nD+2D-7.

I can\'t think of any other pros.

CONS:

1) nD+D-D adds a bit of realism...and no small amount of unnecessary
complication. What used to be one roll, added up, becomes one roll, added
up, then another roll, subtracted. But the results are *usually* within the
normal range. Extra effort expended for something that usually has no
effect.

2) According to the odds table (posted by Richard Flores, IIRC), it means
that a "hit" with a 1D weapon is about as likely to do no damage at all as
any other amount from 1 to 6. Hmmmm.

3) For a 2D weapon, it means you\'re *more likely* to do zero points than
any other value below 5 (IIRC - I no longer have the table for reference).
The probability curve makes no sense. Why is "no damage" more likely than
"a little damage", but less likely than "a lot of damage"?

4) For a high-damage weapon, the effect is barely noticeable. Why bother?

5) If you roll to hit and succeed (and your hit penetrates armor), you
should do damage. Discovering, after you\'ve succeeded in hitting your
opponant, that you didn\'t do any damage, would be really annoying:

   Ref:    "Roll to hit"
           [Rattle rattle]
   Player: "Yay!"
   Ref:    "You hit him! Roll damage."
           [Rattle rattle]
   Ref:    "You do... er... no damage."
   Player: "I don\'t like this game any more..."

6) Grazing blows and critical hits should really be a part of the roll to
hit. Indeed, critical hits already are, as Spectacular Successes. Grazing
hits can be much more easily implemented; forex: "Any roll to hit that
exactly equals the TN is a grazing hit, doing 1D reduced damage." Or some
such.

7) T4 already has a rule for intentionally reduced damage and intentional
extra damage hits, the Aimed Attack for Increased Damage or Decreased
Damage. Thus, nD+D-D is redundant, if implemented as an option at the
attacker\'s discretion (as implied by one of your recent posts. It wasn\'t
clear if that\'s what you intended to imply, though.)

8) T4 already has a rule for glancing blows: hit dice are reduced by armor.
A hit with a 1D or 2D weapon against an opponant with r3 armor will be
deflected or absorbed. Thus nD+D-D is an attempt to add something that is
already there in the rules.

9) How *does* nD+D-D integrate with reduction of damage due to armor? Not
very well, IMO. If a 1D weapon hits r1 armor, is the damage entirely
negated? Or does the attacker still get to roll the extra +D-D? Or:
consider a PC wearing r1 armor who is hit by a 2D weapon: 1D is absorbed,
the second die is rolled, but then the +D-D eliminates the damage
completely; suggesting that this r1 armor absorbed all the damage from a 2D
weapon! The armor/penetration rules in T4 are, I feel, one of its most
elegant and sensible features. nD+D-D confuses an otherwise beautifully
simple system.

10) How does nD+D-D integrate with the Blow-Through Rule? Damage from most
projectile weapons is limited to 3D, the rest is wasted. If you take damage
from a 3D weapon, can you still take extra damage from the +D-D? Or is it
wasted?

11) Extra dice to be rolled in a combat system already freighted with too
many dice.

12) I use a Hit Location chart, which can result in reduced damage due to
incidental hits (belt buckles, etc), or increased damage due to internal
bleeding, etc. So nD+D-D is redundantly reduntant, at least for me.

Considering all the above, I feel that nD+D-D adds a small amount of
realism, usually to no noticeable effect, is an unnecessary complication,
adds features that are already present in the rules, adds extra rolls to
the combat system for little gain, and does not integrate well with the
armor/penetration rules.

It\'s an interesting idea, Marc, but on careful consideration, I must
suggest you leave it out.

Keep the ideas coming, though. It\'s always cool to see what you\'re working on.

Best,

Yes, but some of use don\'t :-) My point was that after twenty years the
game is bound to change because the writers of the new material dosn\'t
have the capabilities to have a complete overview of everything that has
been published before. So they make the rules the way that is logical to
them.

How can my opinion be wrong? All you have to do is make up some handwave
that gives this race the ability to fight down and dirty. I didn\'t say
that the way it is in T4 is the ONLY way, I tried to convey that maybe we
should see it from a writers point of view and not only from the fan point
of view.

Then either you fight like you do now to change Traveller into what you
want it to be, or you buy some game that is more in line with your views
on how a sci-fi game should be. I have no problem with that. I was trying
to put forth my opinion on way these technological devices had been left
out.

I in no way intended to imply that my view was the only one correct. I
simply wanted to state what I say as the writers position, to somewhat be
their voice in the discussion. If I sounded snotty, I apologize. It might
be that my limited vocabulary sometimes comes in the way of what I want to
say. English is my secondary language.

I agree with this, but sometimes I have the feeling that canon comes in
the way of the roleplaying, the imagination. That (and some lack of sleep)
prompted the rather harse response above.

The primary source would be _Fighting Ships_ which details half a dozen
battleships with an average tonnage of around 300,000. _Trillion Credit
Squadron_ helped by showing the huge budgets a fair-sized planet would
be able to spend on warships. (Before TCS ships were a lot smaller; see
my .sig for an example).

AHL was 60,000 T and was a heavy cruiser. Battleships start around 100,000
T and go up from there. Tigresses were 500,000 T.

Yes it does. Well, I won\'t positively claim that there is no place where
it dosen\'t mention the fuel, but the one place I recall seeing the rule
about a ship being able to jump if its capacitors had been filled by
absorbing incoming fire, it continues \'...provided it has the fuel\'. In
other words, _none_ of the jump fuel is used to provide the power needed
to jump. This was the basis for the alternate suggestion some months ago
that jump fuel isn\'t use as fuel at all, but in some way to open a \'bubble\'
in jumpspace where the ship can enter. (BTW. did FF&S2 use this idea or
ignore it?). IMO this is the explanation that comes closest to resolving
the various problems with the CT jump drive.

The ratio of women to men would be determined by whatever social mores the
parent society espoused far more than the optimum for a new colony (By
parent society I mean whatever segment of the society that pays for the
ship, not necessarily the majority).

As I said in my first post, with other assumptions you can get some really
gross growth rates. However, under such circumstances another limiting
factor would apply: How fast the adults can develop the colony\'s ability
to support the new children. No use having triplets every year if they\'ll
just starve to death. Finally, a new society will need a lot of different
skill (especially one going to a completely unknown planet). I don\'t think
any SLT colony could afford to let half the population be mere birth
machines. The females of such a colony would IMO have been selected for
high skills as well as everything else and would have to schedule their
pregnancies to allow them to apply those skills.

you are allowed a max of 60 minutes in FFS2. I think 252MW is the magic
number.

This has been with us since J2 required PP2 in LBB days <cryptic grin>.

I\'m sure FFS2 also had the requirement to keep that level of power whilst
in jump.
But I havn\'t got FFS2 at work so treat that statement as a wild guess.

When you say you hope to use chat, I assume you mean IRC (or 
something similar) to handle combat situations? If so, look for an 
IRC server that will actually allow \'bots to be used. I don\'t know of 
one offhand, but there must be some out there somewhere, else there 
wouldn\'t be any \'bots. Then search out a dice rolling \'bot to use. 
The results are put into the chat window as an action from the \'bot.

For the PBeM games I\'m in or running, the GM handles it all. For the 
IRC game I\'m in, the GM handles it all. For the first IRC game I was 
in, the GM would periodically ask us to roll and trusted us to be 
honest in reporting the roll. Since that GM was my hubby, I\'ll let 
you guess as to the honesty factor on my end... ;>

Let me know how things work out...

This version is mainly a bug fix...here are the details:

* Fixed hull pricing (there was a bug).
* Fixed coating pricing - its now based on percentages instead of flat cost
(for both credits and costs).
* A whole slew of minor changes to the worksheet that should enable
non-excel users (and Excel 5.0 users) to use the program with fewer error
messages. I have now tested the worksheet on Excel 97 and Quattro Pro 8, and
it works without errors or warnings in both. If you are using it on another
spreadsheet (like 1-2-3, Excel 7, Excel 5, Excel for the Mac, Claris Works,
etc...) let me know how its working...
* Added TL tracking for hull materials, to inform you when you\'ve selected a
material that isn\'t available at your tech level.

And you can see, nothing huge - except to the non Excel 97 users, perhaps.

Let me know what you think - and keep sending the bug reports and
enhancement requests my way!

Note: Several people have written to me and asked for a more "GUI" based
spreadsheet - dialogs and the like to support data entry rather than the
silly little code numbers on the sheet itself. I\'m not doing this for two
reasons:
1) Never done it before, so I don\'t know how...
2) I\'d like this spreadsheet to be a cross-platform/cross-program as
possible - I\'ve already broken that rule with the Tech Level macro - if I
add even more VBA code, I take the chance that the sheet will be unusuable

I think I read this in the MT:Ref\'s Manual. About how the Black Globes work.
If the globe absorbed enough power from incoming fire (and the black globe
capacitors were large enough) the power could be transferred to the jump
drive.

So, a way to make a "jump gate" work, would be to have a black globe with
large enough capacitors. Have the jump gate "fire" the energy into the black
globe and "poof" your in jump space. You probably wouldn\'t need a "full
size" black globe. Just a small one, perhaps at the front of the ship, to
absorb the energy.

Of course, I could be remembering the books wrong.

Question about FFS/FFS2 Do these books go into a lot of detail about how the
different components work? Like sensors and Jump Drives. I\'ve gone through
every resource I have (again, I have nothing after MT) and can\'t find
anything other than the most basic descriptions.

Thanks for a very good and short description about planetary evolution.

The lack of planets with nonbreathable atmosheres in Traveller is a serious
one because it makes most collections of say 20 systems more or less equal
in value before colonization and there are no "gems" so to speak. We could
argue that tainted atmospheres actually include all cases where a person
could breathe with added (bottles) oxygen ie reasonable pressures and
harmless gasses (N2, CO2 etc) but that would be pretty canonbreaking.

My (secret to the players) solution is that most systems with life were
seeded with life from the mysterious progenitors for reasons unknown 3-5
billion years ago. Therefore most life vaguelly share the same biochemistry
and thus the many oxygenated planets around. The progenitors also
terraformed lots of planets cirkling those sinful cold suns we\'ve been
talking about lately.

Finally, the progenitors created a physical system for transporting HUGE
amounts of power from the galactic core to the rim in a couple of hundred
parsecs wide "tunnel". A side effect of this tunnel is that jumpdrives work
and therefore the lack of starfaring civs knocking on the door from other
parts of the galaxy. This explains the lack of understanding all
major/minor races seem to have about the underlying principles of
hyperspace as it is a "local" phenomena and all scientists swear to the
cosmological principle ("there is nothing special about where you are"). In
my universe, taken from some blasphemous ideas on the list (Eris?), all but
droyne are actually minor: the so called major races are just better at
hiding the fact. To complicate things more Grandfather stumbled on the fact
that hyperspace was an artifact and after that he got SOO yeallow he killed
of his children, destroyed all traces of himself in the final war, secretly
gave all major races the secret of jumpdrives with carefully planted
artifacts etc and finally built himself a pocket universe to hide in.
Why did he do all this?
Because he realized that his jumping about with starships actually had
started to interfere with the progenitors who had listening monitors placed
along the "tunnel" these were sublight ships that started towards the
galactic core to tell the builders what had happened. 150 000 years later
the monitors arrived at the core and the entities responsible for
maintaining the "tunnel" went out to kill the disturbance. These also went
by sublight so after another 150 000 years they arrived bringing with them
the black curtain etc. Yaskoydroy, the ultimate chicken even gave the
Zhodani artifacts to lure them into exploring coreward in the hope that
they would take the blame for messing with the progenitors "tunnel".
The "tunnel" maintainers are large robotic sublight craft filled with
antimatter and jump inhibitors that come travelling creating the black
curtain.

Maybe this is a bit over the top but at least it solves some astrophysical
discrepansies. ;-)

Except that the X-boats didn\'t need P-plants at all (I think it says so in
Traders & Gunboats). In High Guard there was some rules about the time to
jump depending on J-n vs P-n. I\'ll look it up when I get home after work.

- ----> The Canon comes from (CT) Supplement 9 "Fighting Ships" which
has cruisers in the 50,000 to 75,000 ton range and Battleships from
200,000 to 500,000 tons. In addition to maxed-out spinal weapons, they
tended to carry sizeable fighter squadrons, even on some of the
cruisers. Heck, the Light Cruiser was 30,000 tons.
	The MT fighting ships book did up the size on many vessels
Destroyers (3,000 tons in Supp9) ballooned to 10,000 tons, some
dreadnoughts went to 700,000 tons, but with the ship design changes
compared to High Guard, some of them had to happen to make them work.
The rebellion sourcebook also had a large battleship and cruiser class
with notes.
	Personally, I always liked the older book better, as, in
addition to stats there was a brief description of the capabilities and
roles of the different ships, a class name, and some comments about
deployment - you know, things to add some flavor to otherwise bare
stats...

	That\'s one way to do it. The spinal mounts are usually what
causes the majority of the damage anyway.

	As I believe someone else has posted, AHL\'s were about 60,000
tons, big spinal PA, and a sizeable fighter complement. To a group of
PC\'s in a Far Trader, might as well be a battleship. We ran a campaign
for a bit which was in a "Star Trek" mode with PC\'s as naval officers,
though, and at that point the difference starts to matter. "It\'s how
big?".

	I will say that the largest Vargr ship I remember seeing stats
for was about 10,000 tons. Kinda puny against a 200KTon BB, but then I
realized you can only fire that spinal mount so often, and there are a
lot of Vargr, and again, to a Far Trader etc, 10,000 tons  might as well
be 100,000.

This orbiting facility could also act as a communications satellite,
weather satellite, mapping, etc...  Maintaining a space presences could
be useful for a number of reasons.  Just make sure you have some reliable,
reusable surface to orbit vehicles and enough escape capsules to make
it back to the planet if anything goes irreversibly wrong with the
orbiting ship.

Actually, what he is talking about is listed in CT-High Guard (revised,
1980) on pg.39, under "Breaking Off:"

"Jumping: A ship which breaks off by jumping must have a destination and
enough fuel to get there. It must expend energy points equal to two turns
output from a power plant ... ."

Later, under "The Black Globe" (pg. 43) it states:

"If a ship absorbs enough energy to make a jump, and is supplied with
sufficient fuel, it may jump at the end of the turn."

He is incorrect, but I admit that until I went back and read it I shared
his misconception.

Of course, this brings up that whole "what is the jump fuel for, anyway?"
question again. If you have the fuel but not the energy to initiate the
jump, then you can\'t jump. It seems to cotradict the high-throughput
reactor theory, for instance. I don\'t like the "it\'s used to maintain the
jump bubble" idea, either. On GURPSnet, one proposal was that the hydrogen
was used as some sort of FTL reaction mass, and that similar technology
could be used to explain "reactionless" thrusters (the reaction mass is
ported into jumpspace).

When Dave and I were updating FF&S, we had pretty much the same sorts of
thoughts (particularly your first few, on fuel and energy for the jump
drive).

Since "canonical" Traveller didn\'t have stargates (except possibly as Ancient
artifacts) or similar forms of interstellar travel, we concluded that on the
whole, Traveller jump drives require both fuel and energy to operate, and
the drive must be on board the ship which performs the jump.  Then we added
rules and other comments to FF&S2 to this general effect.

If you want a Babylon-5 campaign, then your conclusions are entirely
appropriate - the Babylon-5 universe seems to work that way.  If you can
locate a copy, stargate rules were presented in the first edition of FF&S
as an alternate technology.

There\'s a number of things now - although in all honesty most PBEM\'s I\'ve
played don\'t have much need for dice-rolling - most of the work is done
through role playing directly with the Ref\'s doing any nessecary die
rolling.

http://www.webprg.com/ is one possibility, as well as a number of BOTs
for IRC\'s that simulate rolling dice, and the MU* variations there.

I\'ve been keeping my mouth shut, but I guess now\'s the time to speak up.
I haven\'t been paid for FF&S2, and neither has my coauthor.

The last communication I recieved from Tim said that he\'d pay me as soon
as he \'could\' (and I won\'t speculate in public on the conclusions I can draw
from that and the fact that I haven\'t been paid yet).

Sup. 9 Fighting Ships, and Library Data both talk about it (Library
data has a picture of a very Star Destroyer-like Sylea BB, for

The writers guide, (IIRC), and "Making of Star Trek". In addition, both 
sets of blueprints (the "official" set produced by Pocket books, and the 
fan produced ones) denote that the hull was seperable, showing explosive 
charges, reinforced mounting points, etc.)

Actually, while "flee at impulse velocities" was an option, the hull was 
also designed to at least be able to survive a re-entry and land safely 
(this was not so much flying as "controlled falling"; the ship used it\'s 
frisbee design and tractor beams to slow itself, and force-fields to 
protect the hull and crew from re-entry heat).

The Galaxy class Primary hull was also designed for re-entry, but this 
was considered a last-ditch option; the hull was large enough and 
expensive enough that they never wasted an airframe testing it (according 
to the tech manual), and no one was sure if it would actually work, even 
under ideal conditions. (of course, in Generations we see them land a 
primary hull under the worst possible conditions, suggesting this was 
about the only place Starfleet Engineering actually followed rules 
regarding over-engineering their designs; they certainly didn\'t with the 
design\'s power harness or M/AM reactor assembly!)

The early version of the Enterprise (no bloody a, b, c, or d...) did not 
have escape pods on board, according to the deckplans, but according to 
one fan produced set of deck plans, the Ent-A *did*. Ent-C, D, and E all 
have hatches on the hull for ejection bays, suggesting that they all have 
escape pods (and, of course, we\'ve seen them deployed on the Ent-E, in 
First Contact).

I had hoped that this one had been laid to rest from the last time, however...

The formula for change of position from accelleration is always: delta x =
(.5)at^2

The trick is that each new turn must be considered on its own. The velocity
from the last turn\'s accelleration cannot be considered when determining
the new accelleration for the new time period.
To illustrate this point, just accellerated in different directions, say
the four points of a compass over four turns.

I\'d rather not get into inertial frames unless I have to, so I\'ll leave it
at that.

1) Where are the rules for RF and VRF bonuses? These are mentioned in
several places - the Arsenal book and FF&S2, but I cannot find anything
which spells out exactly what they do for T4.

2) FF&S2 figures a Recoil number for small arms. Why? We had this in
TNE, but it wasn\'t in T4\'s main rules, or anywhere else I\'ve looked, and
again, no recoil numbers in Arsenal. So, I assume it\'s some kind of die

the TL.

and I haven\'t seen it locally (Dallas/Fort Worth). Every rulebook I\'ve

revision. Somebody update me!

Ug, I own The Babylon Project, but have not have the time to learn the
rules, yet.  That plus the fact that my MT game has been set in the B5
Universe for about 4 years now.  So why change to another game.  That plus,
I use the standard canon alien races, the races from B5, & a few of my own.
 Its a mish-mosh of stuff from MT, B5, & me.  Really a fun game to play in.

Mostly, for the Jump Gates, I use a bit of exotic tech that is theorticly

As to the fixed week long period, that was dropped the minute I thought
about this fact.  "A jump-1 ship can go one parsec in one week.  A jump-2

Therefore, it can be created using only energy.  Such that might come from

You would think that in that period of time they could develop jump drive,

If you have the ability to do so, Harold, why not publish it on your
Children of Earth web page? I\'d be happy to help with formatting. I think
there\'s a large group of us who *do* have an appreciation for astronomy and
would like to have an alternative system with which to more accurately
depict stellar phenomena in Traveller.

The basics of this idea are included in FF&S2.  We were trying to get as close
to the Classic Traveller jump drive model as possible (this meant that, by
necessity, FF&S2 differs from T:TNE and MT, since the operation of the Jump
Drive was changed for both rules sets).

Agreed.

As one of the people who kind of likes the idea, I will respond in kind.

Jeez, you mean they spray oil between the moving parts to keep them from
failing?  And the oil is used up?  This is a bloody joke....

Getting serious again, it is a reasonable hypothesis.  If you have ever
bothered to work out how much energy you would get from fusing that much
H2, you would see that it is a tremendous amount - enough that jump drive
power plants would replace all others if they had even a small fraction of
the efficiency of a regular power plant.

Perhaps even more telling, a jump is possible with unrefined fuel.  Damn
few power plants can accept a significant fraction of other chemicals in
the feedstocks, especially they horrific mix in most gas giants.

As a result, they are certainly not using the H2 for fuel, and I cannot see
many other uses for the massive quantities than cooling, ballast, or
reaction mass.  Given that you have alternative physics going on anyway,
you can answer it as you like, but it seems more useful to make it either
JS reaction mass or something that is used to form the fabric of your
pocket universe, than to assume it is just tossed away for no particular
reason.

In addition, if you work out the geometry of a universe the size of a ship,
it is either going to be expanding at tremendous speed, or contracting.
Since I suspect Traveller ships do not approach the energy density needed
to keep such a universe open, tossing some mass into the mix might make it
a lot easier to keep the pocket universe form collapsing to a point.

If there is one at all, it is likely free, if it exists at all.  I have
been reading the kaffe pages, and there appears to be a number of people
working on this problem.

There is also the Sun JavaPlatform dealy that is ~$100, and includes a web
browser, VM, and tools, but I think that is overkill.

I will drop a line to a few of them, and see if there is, indeed, a Java
solution for pure-dos machines.  Note that if you wish to go to C, DJGPP is
freeware.  I would rather do Java than C or C++ at the moment, but there
are free options in general.

(Java\'s advantage of a defined, if arcane, graphics API for all platforms
is kind of nice, really.)

It strained mine so much that I started writing new system generation rules
that completely ignore the old ones.  I have not yet done stellar classes,
but I will.  Having an astronomer in the game who objected to the number of
"habitiable" red dwarfs, or type O stars made life exciting.

Yes yes yes!

Too damn many iceworlds and lava balls exist for me to play in the
Traveller universe as is.  I have not yet completely decided how to deal
with it, but I have already come out with probability distributions for
main worlds, and am working on subsidiary ones that follow a more
"reasonable" course.  I would not mind seeing other\'s work, though, as I
was a physicist, not an astronomer.

There is a second possibility.  I have been playing with economic curves
for the last few weeks, and talking to a number of people who disagree
adamantly with some of my assumptions (Hi, Jo...).  It has been a good
discussion, and it has altered my thinking.

Unfortunately, it means my current best economic formula is a bear.  It has
six parameters, a power, some additions, and produces numbers I now do not
like.  I suspect it will get even more hairy, and this despite my desire to
keep it to the same kind of log scales that are in the rest of the
Traveller universe.

Would I inflict the current version on anything but a computer program?
No, as it is not playable in real time.  For real time play, I have a chart
giving the per capita GDP per tech level, with shifts for rich, poor, and
extreme starport types.  It is not quite right, but it is close enough for
quick use.

Now, do both of these belong in mailine text in a rule book?  Not really -
the table takes up 15 lines, three columns, and is likely good enough, with
the full formula being good "optional rule" fodder.

As far as the nD-D deal, I would likely not use it, as I rarely use dice
anyway, so i do not have strong opinions.  I had enough trouble noting
which die was the tens digit when rolling percentile dice :)

The problem is that I suspect that the Caravel and a couple of the other
designs don\'t add up correctly (in price and other variables).  Given the
amount of time I spend on other aspects of the THUDDD contests already, I
simply don\'t have time to go over each design for its technical validity;
I\'ve been counting on list discussions to bring this out during the voting
period.

However, that hasn\'t been happening to the extent I\'d expected.  Would
anyone care to form the "ISBA Technical Review Board" to go over the
designs soon after I announce them, and announce any problems found to the
lists?  Perhaps authors could submit their designs to the Board for
confidential vetting before the entry deadline, as well.

It is.

In the Traveller universe, it is very, very, very, difficult to make the
technological breakthrough required for the jump drive. Only 5 (!)
races  in all of known space in the past _several thousand years_ have
independantly discovered jump drives!

And questions remain whether *all* of these races merely, in one form or
another, recovered the technology from ancient artifacts developed by
*one* super-genius droyne known as "grandfather" over 300,000 years ago!

You are jumping to conclusions here. A jump-2 is not *faster* than a
jump-1. It just reaches a higher-energy jumpspace dimension. A jump-1
drive is incapable of reaching the J-2 dimension which "shortens"
distance *more* than the J-1 dimension.

There have been many different "handwaves" to explain why the jump time
is fixed at one week. The fact is though, that that\'s the way Marc wants
it, and that\'s a base assumption upon which much Traveller history and
background is based.

If you\'re running a B5 campaign, by all means, do what you want; just
don\'t discard the notion that jump times _can_ be fixed as some sort of
crazy or illogical idea.


Here are a couple brief synopses of pseudo-scientific
explanations/analogies for the 1 week jump time, the first of which I
came up with, and the second was another idea someone posted last year
that I liked:

1. Fixed Jumpspace Grid Reaction Time

(analogy: fixed time chemical reactions)

- - In order to enter and remain in jumpspace, a ship needs to generate a
jumpspace field, composed of exotic particles.
- - As long as the field is active the ship remains in jumpspace; it
*cannot* exit until the field is turned off.
- - The field is generated by the jump grid, laced throught the hull of
the starship.
- - The reaction created in the grid cannot be stopped once started, and
it runs its course naturally in 168 hrs +/- 10%.
- - The reaction cannot be restarted once begun, and has been maximally
catalyzed to react as fast as possible using current technology.

2. Equivalence of Potential Energy

(analogy: fixed time parabolic travel at constant acceleration)

- - No matter how "fast" one travels through jumpspace, there is a maxima
of potential energy available for travel.
- - To use an analogy, imagine that a *frictionless*, parabolic tunnel is
built from point A to B on earth, to a depth of 1 km. Another similar
tunnel is built from A to C at the same depth. If you drop a ball down
each of the tunnels, both will arrive at their respective destinations
at exactly the same time, no matter the distance travelled.

Be careful applying logic to fictional constructs.  Hyperspace by
definition does not conform to our understanding of space so movement
through hyperspace isn\'t necessarily going to work like we\'d expect.
You can have ships move at different speeds if you want, but it\'s no
more or less logical than having all jumps take one week.

Given the expense of sending an STL colony ship I\'d guess that the whole
ship would be used for something.  I also doubt that the colony would
have much to send back that would need a ship.  What I would expect is
that some part of the ship would be able to be converted into a huge
antenna to send messages back and forth.  If nothing else, the colony
would most likely generate scientific data that would be of interest to
the homeworld.   They may also wish to send STL data carriers back,
but these would be as small as possible.

Since files usually start with the world name you can\'t use a letter or
number for the comment character.  Software already exists that uses \'#\'
as a comment line marker, however, so this would be a good choice.

A more universally useful choice would be to ignore all lines starting
with characters outside a certain set.  I have some software from
sunbane (I think) that treats lines beginning with \'#\', \'$\' or \'@\'
specially.  How about a general rule to ignore lines which begin with
any punctuation character except for a few that might be useful as part
of the name field - perhaps single or double quote, brackets,
parentheses, \'!\',\'*\' and \'-\'?

I have an algorithm for recognising the most common variant file formats
(dgp, tab delimited, etc) based on certain assumptions and patterns to
be found in the text (e.g. 4 digits surrounded by whitespace for the
location, XXXXXXX-X with X alphanumeric for the UWP).  I posted this
some time ago; I\'ll try to write a portable C routine to parse sector
files.  And no, I don\'t want to learn Java just for this! 8-)

One of the big problem on this list is the habit of taking a single
sentence and trying to read to much into it.  The author could
well have intended this to mean that you could use energy from
both the black globe and jump fuel (and before anyone gets pendantic
on me, you have to prove that the sentence is worded exactly to
say what the author intended).  Balance this against other
references where you use just energy (including the adventure
where jump drives were charged by solar energy, but that idea
was ill considered for background consistency reasons).

> I don\'t like the "it\'s used to maintain the

Well, the problem is that you are trying have a drive and retroactively
come up with reasons why it just happens to use fusion fuel without
needing it for fusion.  That kind of thing always tends to (IMO at
least) leave hokey or arbitrary taste in the mouth.

Just a few thoughts here about High Population worlders going to a colony
world.  What would be the psychological impact to them?  What I mean is
that the people on the home world would think "Thank god, something is
being done about the problem."  But, with people raised in a dense
population situation would this not cause some problems with them working
together, i.e. not trust, thinking the other person is going to stab them
in the back.  By High Population, I mean in the tens of billions, not what
we have now.

Thank you, I\'m not totaly insane, just crazy. ;<)

OK, so it seems we have someone in the know here.  So why does Jump Drive
need both fuel & energy?

OK, but why do they need both?  As to stargates/jumpgates, well my thought
is that they were not ever thought of by someone with the power to do
anything about it.  That or the Jump-Drive builders don\'t want you to have
them.  (Look at Tucker, built a great car, but was forced out of bussinees
by the big three)

Actually a capacitor can.  Why else do they not want you to remove the back

Well, not only that, but the tonnage used in Fuel & Jump drive on a BB
could be used on a BR as more armor/defensive systems.  Both have the same
limits for teeth, but the BR has better defenses, which in turn means a
better chance to survive contact with the enemy, which in turn means a
better chance to win.  But of course technology does help out a lot.

You would not have to use a black globe at all.  Current tech will allow
for the transfer of energy without using a black globe.

Not really, I just forgot about needing the fuel, but I can work it all out later.

EM Sensors would work just like EM sensors do today.  One of the best

Myself, I cannot see why not.  Although, in order to make it simple, I
would either make shields equal to levels of armor, take so much damage, or
do both.  This system will make it simple to use.

Now here I would use EM waves to deflect the trajectories of HE weapons. 
Ice Clouds to do the same for lasers.  But, if you can create gravity &
anti-gravity well then depends upon the level of gravity you can create. 
Standard Shields from SF would protect from all attacks.

<< What limitations would there be? >>

Up to the GM.  But, I would not allow HE weapons to be used when EM waves
type shields are being used, Lasers when Ice Clouds are uses, etc  As to
shields it is up to the GM.  Myself, I do it this way, when you are firing
weapons at TL-15 the shields MUST be turned off one second before you fire
& can be turned on one second after you fire.  At TL-17 you can set the
shields to cover everything, but the weapons, so that you are protected,
but you can still be hit.  At TL-20 full prtection.


<< And how would this effect the ship in question? >>

See above.

Btw, does anyone else use seperate TLs for some worlds.  Like lets say you
have a R&D world with a average of TL-15, but has a TL-17 in a few areas,
like Power Plants, Lasers, Fuels,, & Medical?  Or am I just being strange?

Ooohhh...this _is_ interesting...if we have grav-FOCUSED lasers, what
about grav-UNFOCUSED ones?

One immediate problem I see is the scale you\'ll need...the handwave over
grav-focussing is that very high strength grav plates are used to bend the
laser into a long range focus. You would need astonishingly high grav
fields rather close to your ship to bend incoming lasers away. These
fields will also play havoc with your own sensors and weapons.

Hmmmm...it begins to sound like a functional description of Black Globe
technology to me.

Korriak (sp) or something like that. Smaller than a Tigress larger than
Plankwell. 250KT sounds about right
Its the one that looks like a Star destroyer. Just before the 5th
frontier was I believe the Spinward marches had 3 squadrons. All this
from memory about Book 9

Also don\'t forget the Lurenti/Nolikian battle tender/rider combo.
Tender had 6 I think riders(and several squadrons of fighters). I cant
remember the tonnages. I can check when I get home.

This comes from the CT Spinward Marches Campaigne Book. I really enjoyed
this one. It had the history & TO&E for the Regina\'s famous lift
Infantry Reg. Also had the history of BatRon. 

All in all a great book. Let me know if anyone wants the particualrs

The blood does not erupt into foam like a opened, shaken soda bottle. The
gases do take some time do come out of solution.

Actually, the bends can be rather slow to come on, occurring as long as
24-48 hours after a dive. The treatment is also pretty straightforward
you re-compress the diver and properly decompress them in stages.

Since your are (hopefully) _permanently_ recompressing the poor spacing
victim simply by bringing them back into the airlock, there\'s no special
treatment needed.

In MT and TNE the time in J-Space is 6,7, or 8 days at random.
But can this time be calculated before the ship exits J-space?

I mean, people in the ship have a countdown to exit time? so they ar at
battle stations when the ship emerges?

Or when the ship exits and the computer detects it in the 6th day we
have alarms . WARNING WARNING we are at real-space everybody to the

Does anyone knows other answers?

Normally, I could take extreme umbridge w/ that.  If fact, i do. : )

    TNE was the giant leap towards realism.  FF&S (the True and Original) was

Well my answer would be... if they\'ve been lugging around these heavy and fuel
hungry jump drives for like 10000 years now in basically the same form, they
must be necessary.

                      BATTLERIDERS VS. BATTLESHIPS
                                 - by -
                        Paul Montgomery Crabaugh


               Rumors are  being heard about a  civilian study of
         Imperial  naval   doctrine  which  may   cause  a  major
         explosion in the Navy\'s methods of ship procurement.

               This study was conducted by Interstellar Technical
         Consultants of Mora, in response to an IN request for an
         analysis  of  the  relative  merits  of battleriders and
         battleships  in naval  policy.  This  has always  been a
         difficult subject, with many partisans on both sides but
         no agreement. All  that can be said of  the ITC study is
         that it will undoubtedly provoke quite a reaction.

               Details are not available for the most part, since
         much of the report is classified, but the broad outlines
         are now known.

               The  controversy  surrounding  the  two  types  of
         capital  ship has  been built  on one  key point: that a
         battleship derives much of its  value from the fact that
         it  has a  jump drive,   for which  advantage it  pays a
         considerable cost in terms  of mass that could otherwise
         produce  energy  or  house  weapons.  A  battle  rider -
         essentially a battleship without a jump drive, delivered
         on target by a mother ship, which usually carries a full
         squadron - is more  powerful, kilogram for kilogram, and
         frequently less expensive, as well.

               Thus  it is  argued that  a 70,000  ton battleship
         will always  be severly handled  by a 70,000  ton battle
         rider, which demonstrates the  superiority of the battle
         rider concept.

               The ITC study contradicts  this view, labelling it
         "specious" and a "sophistry".

               The argument is that in truth, the strategic value
         of a 70,000 ton battle rider is nil; it is merely a very
         large system  defense boat. Only  when it is  mated with
         the mother  ship\'s jump drive  does it aquire  strategic
         value.  Therefore,  in  comparing  the  relative  combat
         effectiveness of  a battle rider\'s  share of the  mother
         ship\'s mass should be added.

               In  the  example  being  used,  it  is not fair to
         compare a  70,000 ton battleship to  a 70,000 ton battle
         rider;  after including  the equal  share of  the mother
         ship\'s  jump  drive  and  fuel,  the  battle rider would
         actually be  equivalent to something like  a 120,000 ton
         battleship.

               The  ITC report  drily notes  that it  comes as no
         surprise that a 70,000  ton battleship would be defeated
         by a 120,000 ton battleship.

               Futhermore,  the report  cites other disadvantages
         to battleriders.

               Among these  is the well-known  vulnerability of a
         battle rider  squadron to the  loss of its  mother ship.
         Whole squadrons  can be cut off  and forced to surrender
         by  a  few  well-placed  shots.  The  mother ship cannot
         adequately  defend  itself   without  becoming  a  major
         warship  itself,  a  self-  defeating design philosophy.
         Futhermore, using the battle riders to defend the mother
         ship  restricts  them  to  a  defensive  role.  Lack  of
         iniative is  to some extent  rewarded, a lethal  mode of
         thought in a naval battle.

               Another  disadvantage is  difficulty in  deploying
         battle riders. If an objective  or mission calls for the
         presence  of a  single capital  ship, or  perhaps two or
         three,  battle riders  are difficult  to use  in such  a
         role,  because they  can generally  only be  deployed as
         integral squadrons of a half-dozen or more. The only way
         to send a single battle rider  on a mission is to send a
         mother ship with it. Battle riders thus must be deployed
         with the main battle fleets,  and during times of peace,
         cannot be used for the "gunboat diplomacy" so often seen
         on the Imperial fringes.

               The ITC study also  claims that battle riders are,
         contrary  to  current  opinion,  actually undergunned in
         comparison to battleships. This rather esoteric argument
         relies  on  the  fact  that  the  number  and caliber of
         weapons  carried  by  a  warship  is  determined  not by
         available power,  since there is  generally enough power
         available for many more weapons  than the ship can carry
         if a trade-off in maneuverability  is accepted - but, by
         the mass, surface  area and shape, and crew  size of the
         ship involved.  All other things  being equal, in  other
         words, to the sheer size.

               Therefore, even  though a 70,000  ton battle rider
         is equivalent  to a 120,000  ton battleship, the  battle
         rider  is  armed  like  a  70,000  ton battleship, not a
         larger one. It is  exceptionally well-armed and has vast
         reserves of  power - but it  is still armed only  to the
         scale of  a ship half  its equivalent size,  which would
         ensure that  a 120,000 ton  battleship would be  able to
         crush it in a starship duel.

               The only way to recover the difference would be to
         arm the mother ship, making full use of the true size of
         the battle rider, not merely the small combat portion of
         it.   However,  again,   arming  the   mother  ship   is
         self-defeating: with  the weapons would have  to go more
         power   production,  more   powerful  computers,  better
         defences and more acceleration, all reducing its ability
         to  carry  battle  riders.   The  end  result  would  be
         something   like   a   carrier   which   carried  a  few
         extraordinarily  large fighters  rather than  many small
         ones.

               Altho  the ITC  study was  not commissioned  to do
         more than  compare the two  design philosophies, it  did
         include several recommendations  for long-range planning
         of naval construction. It called  for a shift to a fleet
         composed exclusively, of  battleships and the relegation
         of battle riders to main fleets in quiet areas.

               It also recommended that studies be conducted into
         the feasibility of a hybrid  sort of ship: essentially a
         battle rider  with a limited jump  capability, Jump-1 or
         Jump-2. It is pointed out that such a design might prove
         valuable. The  battle riders would no  longer face total
         defeat if their mother ship was disabled, for one thing.
         For another,  the mother ship  could in some  situations
         not even be exposed to danger; it could be used to ferry
         the battle riders to within a parsec or so of the target
         world  and let  the battle  riders complete  the journey
         under their own power.

                     Battleriders   vs.  Battleships
                          * The Navy Replies *
                                 - by -
                              John Harshman


               In  a  previous  issue   of  this  magazine,  Paul
         Montgomery  Crabaugh  reported   the  results  of  study
         conducted by Interstellar Technical Consultants of Mora,
         ostensibly  at   the  request  of   the  Imperial  Navy,
         regarding  the  relative  merits  of  battle-riders  and
         battleships. The results of  the study, if valid, reveal
         the  total  bankruptcy  of  the  Imperial  Navy\'s  force
         structure; it  is therefore incumbent  upon the Navy  to
         explain its position to the public.

               First  a   disclaimer:  the  ITC   study  was  not
         commissioned  by the  Navy;  indeed,  the Navy  has been
         unable to  procure a copy  of the study\'s  final report,
         and  this  reply  is  necessarily  based  wholly  on Mr.
         Crabaugh\'s article. (Although he  fails to so state, Mr.
         Crabaugh is an officer of ITC).

               Mr. Crabaugh begins with a common misconception of
         the traditional  argument for battle-riders:  this being
         that a  battle-rider, unburdened with a  jump drive, can
         defeat a  battleship of equal  tonnage. As Mr.  Crabaugh
         states, this  is both obvious and  meaningless. The true
         argument,  which the  Navy has  always used,  is that  a
         fleet  composed  of  battle-riders  (and  the  necessary
         number  of   fleet  tenders)  can  defeat   a  fleet  of
         battleships constructed at the same cost.

               It is profitable to  analyze the costs of starship
         design. Separating  the jump and  combat functions saves
         costs  in several  areas and  adds costs  in others.  In
         order to  fulfill its strategic role,  a battle squadron
         must be capable of  jump-4; jump drives and (especially)
         jump fuel make  up 53% of the tonnage  in a jump-4 ship.
         Battle-riders save the cost of armor, meson screens, and
         high-agility maneuver  drives for this  immense tonnage.
         There  are  additional  costs  for  more  duplication of
         hulls, power plants, computers,  and maneuver drives for
         the  fleet tender  (which Mr.Crabaugh  calls the  mother
         ship).  On balance,  however, the  battle-rider squadron
         comes in at a considerable cost savings.

               Another  useful  squadron  comparison  is  that of
         survivability.     Many     starship     systems     are
         tonnage-dependent; they take up  a certain percentage of
         the ship\'s tonnage regardless of its size. These systems
         fight for space within a design. Battleships, with their
         53% of dead space (for battle purposes), are at a severe
         disadvantage   in  this   fight.  A   battleship  cannot
         simultaneously  possess  the   best  armor,  best  meson
         screen,  and a  high agility;  with the  jump drive  and
         fuel, these components would add up to more than 100% of
         its hull  space. Compromises must be  made in the design
         of a  battleship, while a battle-rider  requires no such
         compromises.  A  battle-rider,   being  smaller  than  a
         battleship, is also somewhat harder to hit. This adds up
         to a much higher survivability for the battle-rider.

               The ITC  study presents several  further arguments
         against  the battle-rider/fleet  tender system,  none of
         which have been borne out in practice.

              It is claimed that battle-riders are undergunned in
         comparison   to   battleships.   True,   a  120,000  ton
         battleship can  carry more total weaponry  than a 70,000
         ton battle-rider (assuming the weaponry and power supply
         therefore  will  fit),  but  the  majority  of a capital
         ship\'s offensive power is  contained in its spinal mount
         weapon,  and  no  ship,  whatever  its  size, has so far
         proven capable of mounting  more than one spinal weapon.
         The battle-rider  can mount the same  spinal weapon as a
         battleship; their relative  offensive strengths are much
         closer  than  mere  tonnage  would  indicate.  Moreover,
         70,000 tons  is very large for  a battle-rider; most are
         between 30,000 and 50,000  tons, yet possess as powerful
         a main weapon as the largest battleship at a fraction of
         the cost.

               The  report   claims  that  unarmed   tenders  are
         vulnerable in battle. Actual battle experience has shown
         that a  fleet\'s battle-riders are  fully capable capable
         of   protecting  the   tender  from   enemy  fire  while
         simultaneously  engaging in  offensive aaction.  Only if
         the battle line were broken would the tenders be exposed
         to fire  (and in such  a case most  of the battle-riders
         would necessarily be crippled  or destroyed already). An
         admiral who  feels that tenders restrict  his tactics is
         fully capable of releasing the  riders from a jump point
         far from the  area of battle and leaving  the tenders to
         remain  there; it  is  very  unlikely that  a patrolling
         enemy  would locate  them given  such a  large volume of
         space  to  search.  Battle-riders  are  fully capable of
         operating on  their own for  periods of a  month or more
         (indefinitely if there is a source of fuel).

               Finally,     the    study     claims    that     a
         battle-rider/tender-based fleet is inflexible. One rider
         cannot be sent to a  trouble spot the way one battleship
         can; the smallest unit is  a tender transporting four to
         eight riders.  While true, this  has not proven  a major
         drawback. The  study correctly states that  the main use
         of  single  capital  ships   is  in  what  Mr.  Crabaugh
         indelicately terms  "gunboat diplomacy." (The  Navy uses
         the less emotionally  loaded "deterrent demonstration.")
         The purpose  is to safeguard the  lives and interests of
         Imperial citizens  in the various  smaller states beyond
         the    Imperial    borders    by    a   public   (though
         non-threatening) display of the Navy\'s power. However, a
         large   cruiser  is   generally  sufficient   for  these
         demonstrations.  There  are  enough  battleships  in the
         fleet to cover the few instances in which a cruiser will
         not  serve, and  most of  these are  concentrated in the
         appropriate frontier regions for just such uses.

               The  conclusions to  be drawn  is that  the Navy\'s
         current construction and  deployment policies are indeed
         the  best possible  solution to  our defense  needs. Any
         return  to  a  battleship  navy  would  have  disastrous
         consequences;  be  assured  that  the  Zhodani  and  the
         so-called Solomani Confederation  (whose fleets are also
         composed of battle-riders) are well aware of this.

Actually, very High-Pop worlds I\'d expect to be far more conformist; you
would have to be to get along in such high pop densities. They\'d have
little problem working together.

A more real problem with such a venture, would be the psychological
reaction of the colonists to suddenly being \'alone\' on a world; after all
moving from, say, Hong Kong to a Pop 200 town in Montana is going to be a
_serious_ adjustment, even if they all still spoke Chinese.

Bu, I suppose you could select for that, unless you\'re just scooping
people off the street, and shooting them off to the stars, which is a
different kettle of fish entirely.

Because capacitors can be used to hold _some_ energy indefinately does
mean they can hold the energy density needed to exceed what you get
from fusing a certain amount of hydrogen.

If you do put it up in C, I will likely turn it into Java.  I am currently
fiddling with that code in my program, and it is ugly ugly ugly, in a
number of ways.

	Well the two large canon Vargr ships are the Foghoks 10 kTons
	and Aek Naz 30kTons. As both are classfied as cruisers I think
	Vargr BBs could be bigger, if they had some. Perhaps they prefer

	The Aek Naz had just the size to mount a heavy spinal in MT.

- ----> All this is very interesting, but in CT (High Guard) and MT
also, the Spinal Mounts did the real damage, even with heavy screens and
armor, and many times getting the first shot made the difference. Once
either is large enough to carry the maximum size gun, the secondary
batteries become quite a bit less important. From a strategic point of
view, I would rather have fewer ships which could jump in variable sized
squadrons(assuming BB\'s are more expensive), rather than more ships
concentrated into groups (BR\'s) which I see as less flexible. Again, I
can see reasons for both, and I imagine you would see both in the
Imperial Navy. BR\'s would be better as attrition units, as it\'s cheaper
to replace the ships (theoretically anyway) without a Jump drive
- -assuming you don\'t lose the tender. They also make good
easily-repositioned defensive units if you know an attack may be coming.

	Oh, except for that "riders with lifeboats" bit. I can see
having jump-capable couriers on board, but the lack of a jump drive on
the ship means you lose a ship which requires years to construct, even
if the crew survives. Pretty soon, you have plenty of crews, and no
ships to put them on. I don\'t think that one of the knocks on BR\'s was
the lack of survivability of the crew alone - it was losing the whole
system.

 How about just multiplying the damage on a critical success by 2 or 3?  
I should be possible to kill someone with one hit, say with a sword(2D).
Realistically you can kill someone with one hit of a sword or one shot
from say a body pistol.  In game terms its impossible with out some
sort of criticle damage system.  Just using maximum damage as the
result still wouldn\'t do it.  
                  Ref: "The Aslan shots you with his body pistol.  You
                         take 6 points of damage."
                  Player: "O.K. I\'ll pull out my sword as I walk towards him."
                  Ref: "He shoots you again for 6 more points."
                  Player: "O.K. I walk up to him and attack."
He can take at least one more shot before he\'ll go down.  I like the T4
system for this better than TNE. Do you realize how many shots is takes
to kill someone who has a value of say 40 or so for his chest.  Even 
maximum damage from weapon with a 6d value only does 36 points of damage.
     Well sorry to ramble on, But I do like Mr. Miller\'s new idea. It could be
incorperated by just rolling two extra die of different colors(at the same
time as
the damage roll) and predetermine which is a minus and which is plus. For
example roll 4d for the 2d sword with 2 die being black, one being red(for
minus)
and one being white(for the plus).  Its not really much more work unless you
don\'t know how to add or subtract.  That\'s just my ideas and how I\'m starting
to run my campaign.  One last thing: A critical success might just add another
white(plus) die to the roll.

(for the uninitiated, this is largely the Mechwarrior damage system)

Not a terrible idea, but if we\'re going to revamp the damage system this
thoroughly, why not some kind of hit location system. I mean, which is
better :
"Ow - he shot me in the strength!"
- -or-
"Ow, he shot me in the arm!"

I\'ve experimented with linking attributes to body parts - say end to
torso, dex to legs, str to arms, but people always want to argue things
like "well strength would be more appropriate to legs than dex" etc and
it tends to get a little messy, but would a simple arm/leg/chest/head
system be too much to ask? Makes it easy to add in some kind of task
modifiers too.

- ----> You could look at the American west in the late 1800\'s for at
least one example of moving from a denser population to a more open
area. Granted, it wasn\'t Hong Kong, but it seemed crowded to _them_. Why
did they go? Economic opportunity was probably the biggest factor (own
your own land, etc). The "frontier" mentality may overcome a lot of this
distrust - being at a lower TL and a long ways from home can work some
pretty serious attitude adjustments. Same with some of the early
colonization of North America - different rules (more freedom for
religious groups), land, etc. I don\'t think you\'ll find a higher ratio
of women to men, just the opposite I think. Also, a higher proportion of
your colonists will probably tend to come from discontented segments of
the population, which may solve some "problems" at home beyond simple
overcrowding.
	Then of course, there\'s the Australian example. Involuntary
colonists...

examples I know enough about to comment on.

That\'s actually, a reasonable theory. Still doesn\'t sit well to me,
however. How does the energy get channelled into jumpspace? What kind of
current-carrier can withstand such energies? Why can\'t such a process be
used for weapons of mass destruction? How does a fusion reactor melt
down, anyway? Why is the amount of fuel dependant upon the *volume* of
the ship?

You\'ll have to come up with arbitrary answers to those questions.

I\'ll argue from the other angle, then. If fusion power plants can run
with a minimal amount of impurities (a reasonable assumption, imho) then
why are there misjump rules that specifically take into account risks in
using unrefined rules -- *fuel*, I mean?
                
I accidentally typed "rules", It seemed a propos, so I left it in. ;-)

Agreed. So, why the misjump rules?

Note: I\'m only arguing the point to try and illustrate that no matter
how you justify Jump Drive fuel, arbitrary decisions will be made, and
arbitrary handwaves will be needed to justify them. The Jump Bubble/Jump
Ballast theory is as reasonable to me as a high-capacity fusion
reaction. And it fits the rules better, to boot.

Well, Hydrogen has zillions of other uses besides being a fusion fuel.
After all, it is the simplest, most abundant element in the universe. I
don\'t feel the jump bubble theory is arbitrary or hokey.

What feels arbitrary to me is the theory that Jump Drives are capable of
generating a huge amount of energy in an impossibly short amount of time
by consuming vast amounts of fuel. Yet, strangely, this process cannot
be used in "regular" energy production. How can that paradox be
reconciled?

I guess everyone has their point of view when it comes to
believability...

Rules for such can be extrapolated from the T4 conversion rules in BTRC\'s
"Guns!Guns!Guns!".  They are as follows:

     ROF      Rounds/    Damage    RoF DM
               Turn*

Again, according to "Guns!Guns!Guns!", it is hard to model recoil in T4\'s
six-second combat turns (replace DEX with STR for particularly high
recoiling weapons).

Mark is still working on the super-duper neato keen replacement for T4--

Agreed.  The only time such a weapon will do damage outside its normal
damage range is when the original number of damage dice generate a result
towards either end of the bell curve average *and* the +D-D result
generates an amount that is substantial enough to push the total of the
original damage dice roll beyond the min/max limit.

For example: a 2d6 attack has a min result of 2 and a max result of 12.  If
a 2d6 dice roll generates a total of, say, 5 or 9, only a very severe
result on the +D-D roll (+/- 4 or 5) will shift such a result beyond either

Actually, I *do* like the idea of attacks which succeed in hitting but
which don\'t do any damage, which makes this point a Pro, IMHO.  I still
wouldn\'t use the +D-D rule due to all the other Cons, however.

The problem with RPGs is that it is often hard to model attacks that do
extremely small amounts of damage (ie: attacks that do between 0 and 1
point of damage), but which still hit.  Such is life in RPGs, however.

ACQ (and EA or 3G3, ICRW) inflicts half the number of damage dice (rounded

Not *really* redundant, since the +D-D rule reflects pure randomness while
the rules for increased and/or decreased damage are partially based on
character decision to use those rules.

This is a problem.  Solving it will no doubtingly require more text devoted

See above.  The +D-D rule text is becoming burdened down with additional

I couldn\'t really care how many dice I roll, being a veteran of Champions
and Shadowrun.  I guess it all depends on the number of dice people have
been using in the past.  It *will* raise an issue with those opposed to
more dice, however.

Correct, "at least for you".  Here\'s a better "Con #12":

Incorporating a rule that states \'players look at the damage code of the
weapon, and then either add the result of a +D-D roll or +2D-7\' may raise
some interesting questions by players not familiar with earlier
incarnations of T4.1.  Questions like: "Well, why didn\'t they just increase
all of the publicized damage codes by 1 and instruct me to simply roll an
additional D6 and subtract it from the total instead?"

Using +D-D or +2D-7 in conjunction with the currently published weapon
statistics will look like a patch job, rather than a seamless integration.
Because of this, making the rule OPTIONAL will raise far fewer questions as
to why the rule exists.

Agreed.

Similarly, you would have to prove that the sentence isn\'t getting the

Okay. We could clear this up. Marc\'s on the list. How do I get ahold of

I am not familiar with these other sources (except, of course, DGP\'s SoM).
This is, in no small part I am sure, due to my ignorance of many things
Traveller. Of course, we will have to contact the authors of those works
and prove that their sentences are worded correctly too. :-)

We are trying to come up with a logical explaination for something that
doesn\'t have any basis in physical reality. It may just be that there is no
good logical answer that will explain all the "facts" and satisfy everyone,
because those "facts" just don\'t jive.

I agree with your Occam\'s Razor approach, I just disagree with the
conclusions you have reached. :-)

I am as guilty as the rest of us in partaking of this mental exercise (some
would say masturbation) that is Traveller. That\'s why I\'m here. It\'s fun.
I\'m a self-important bastard that likes to state his opinions to a captive
audience. :-)

The easy answer is that such things would have a heck of a lot of
applicability outside jump drives.  Once you know the energy densities of
accumulators, you can quickly figure out the upper bound on the amount of
power that a jump drive can produce, and thus what power plant it seems to
be similar to.  If you use the HG idea that a jump drive is a third
capacitors, then you have an even stricter upper bound.  If the jump drive
is substantially above that upper bound, then it is going to be worth using
them for other applications.

Consider - a spinal mount that uses extreme amounts of power can be fired
by one of these.  It is not that different than a CPC powered laser, save
that the energy amounts are so much bigger.  Even if it only fires once
every few hours, I suspect you still will be ahead putting a dozen of these
in, as opposed to regular power plants, given the tremendous amounts of
energy involved.

As an alternative, why not put it in the bottom of a large heat sink, and
live off the heat for days.  This completely avoids the need for and use
for the regular fusion plants.

>So sure, you could use a jump drive plant to power a weapon or something -

Even so, the amount of power they are using has to either be substantially
above that produced by a fusion plant, or it could be replaced by one.
Space may be limited, but if it would let you not have the tremendous
amount of H2 that a conventional one uses, then you would still end up ahead.

>Now, someone wanna tell me how I\'m wrong? :)

In spirit, you are quire right, which is why we need a handwave for the H2.
 If the JD is nothing more than a large accumulator bank, a hull grid, and
a sprayer to put the H2 outside the ship, then replacing parts is not worth
the effort.

Sorry I miswrote I didn\'t mean the AHL, I meant the Kinuur Class
Frontier Cruisers. And now that I think about them, weren\'t they even
smaller than 10,000 tons? 

Well, anyway my point is that, to me, Traveller doesn\'t mean really big
ships slugging it out. It means little ships...PC sized ships...in the
100 to 3,000 ton range. More toward the 100 end than the 3,000 end as
well. ;->

Well another thought would be, that the Jump Drive fuse the H2 slowly
rather that at the fast rate of the Powerplant, but if that was true, why
not use the stored energy like I have asked before?

Yes, but there is a increased chance of a misjump so the chemicals in
unrefined fuel can cause wonky effects that are not in refined fuel.

Well, mostly I say that the Jump Drives on a ship need a slow & steady
supply of energy & as such either have to fuse H2 on its own as a safety
feature or have a hook up to the energy capacitors.

Maybe, but a few tons will not help that much.  A ship that weighs say
1,000 tons jumps, throwing in say 10 tons will not help that much.  you
must remember that, I think, fuel is part of a ships weight.

Actually, we do have a theory about hyperspace & how it works & I will be
the first to admit I do not understand it, but, until our TL gets to the
point that we can test it, it reamins just that a theory.  

Now, if you will note, I have only one problem with Traveller.  That is the
jump drive.  While I will admit that it is possible that travel time could
remain constant, I do not think so.  If that were the case, well then why
does it take the same amount of time to go one parsec as it does six?  In
order to suspend my belief system, the fictional construct must make some
basic sense.  Like if a vehicle that does 100 mph can reach a city that is
100 miles away in an hour, and you have a vehicle does 200 mph that goes to
the same place, but it to takes one hour over the same route at a different
time.  Then to me something is wrong.  I do not know why they did this, but
it would seem to me to destroy tactical possibilities.  Like in HG.  You
have a large fleet with an average Jump Drive of say 4, you are under
attack by a fleet that has an average Jump Drive of 3.  You fight a battle
with them & they jump out away from you.  You know they are going to system
X.  You jump to system X.  Well, I think, this is MHO< that you should get
there ahead of that fleet becuase you have more powerful Jump Drives.  But,
under the Canon Version, you will not.

This to me is illogical & the only place in which Traveller falls down.

I can see your point, but what I was saying is that you can get the fuel
cheaply & easily, so his point is off the mark. 

As to what a colony would have to much to sendback.  Well not at first, but
say 50 years down the road, yes, the colony & the homeworld might be able
to open limited trading.

As to useing the ship to build a huge antenna, why?  I mean that you could
use it to plate a depression on the colony world itself or, on another
world in the colony system.  Why build when you can modify what is already
there.  I mean a asteroidal<sp> stike forms a great dish for that sort of
thing.

As to the generation of scientific information, now you have hit the head
on the most valuable item in the universe.  Information.  With a new colony
there would new scientic discoveries.  Lets say on this new colony world
you find a form of plant that uses thermal energy instead of light to
create hydrocarbons.  Well think about it.  The heat from a fusion reaction
could be used to create oxygen & food.  What would be the price a goverment
qould pay for this?

Well, I have just a few things to say about the Traveller RPG.  It is one
of the best systems (ranks right up there with Palladium), but it does have
one problem.  Jump Drive.

  Regards to the jump bubble theory and such...

  One thought that crosses my mind (I haven\'t kept up with thead, so I
apologize if I am going over ground covered) isn\'t so much the problem of
using "dirty" fuels per se, as it is the effect that specific contaminants
intrude into the "Bubble" itself.

  The computer has to take into account all "known" variables (whatever
those might be) and account for them before translating into the jump
space.  Perhaps another reason why the "bubble" theory works so well is
that contaminants alter the bubble in unpredictable ways.  Consequently,
the misjump can occur, but the "program" generally is correct enough for
it to work despite the impurities - until the one day the computer is off
by .0001 significant figures somewhere, which causes the final calculation
to be way off in light of the "impurities" unpredictability.

  Also, what I\'d like to see with respect to misjumps?  A removal of the
concept that it can throw you off by up to 6 times the maximum jump
distance possible (ie 36 parsecs).  To my way of thinking, if it can be
acomplished accidentally, it should be reproducable deliberately.
Somewhere in the CT universe, it is implied that Man can achieve a Jump 36
using only a JUMP 1 configuration!  
  To "clean" this up, perhaps other alternatives should be sought for
means of adding "spice" for the unpredictability of a misjump.

Possibilities:
Total destruction
Jump sickness
Damage to components
  a) powerplant
  b) sensors
  c) jump drive
  d) hull structure
sanity checks
Time duration in jumpspace is *longer* than 168 hours.

  In all, the above mentioned seem more reasonable than being "warped" out
in a manner the implies that there are more "undiscovered" physics behind
the jump universe.  To be honest with you all, I wonder why, in 1,000
years, no one has bent their scientists to the realization that if a jump
1 ship can jump 36 parsecs on 10% fuel, using the drive configuration of
jump 1 - to the idea of making it a reality?

  Well, enough on that.  Each GM can run their world as they see fit
<grin>.  If it ever comes to a vote regarding the "best theory" for
jumpdrives, I would like to vote for the "bubble theory" - thus qualifying
me for the name "bubble head" <Grin>.  One futher proviso however: the
hydrogen used to create the bubble must exit from hyperspace along with
the ship - otherwise, our universe will be losing mass every time someone
jumps - thus seemingly violating the LAW: convservation of energy...

I would hazard a guess that the hydrosphere datum is for free standing
water so it would have to be 0, but if it is for all forms of water on a
planet then A.  Maybe a new level should be created for the hydrosphere
datum called B, Ice Covered.  But that is IMHO.

Depending on the TL of the ship it is on.  That plus what type of shielding

Aye, this is the rub.  We have canon sources saying one thing & another
canon source saying another.  Here we have a collection of people with
differant backgrounds & experiences.  Myself, I am a Network Administrator
& as such wanted to comment on the Computers in Traveller Thread, but got
drawn into the thread about the low-tech colony ship.  What we have to do
is work together to explain the things in Traveller that do not make sense
to one to that person.  Like, for me the Jump Drive.

Same here, but at least we are trying to get rid of that hokey taste by
trying to understand why if makes that hokey taste.  Or did that come out
all wrong.

My bad, I\'m sorry.  But, to me it looked IMHO unrealistic.  Mostly because
they took out the 3rd Imp.  I really like the 3rd Imp.  That, plus the fact
that Traveller is one of the best Hard SF games out there.  The whole Virus
thingy was the real kicker for me into the unrealistic garbage realm.

Not you too.  That is the most common reply I have gotten from this ML,
other than Flames because I dared to go against canon.  Heck, I was even
called a Heritic <sp> by a lurker on the list.

Not really.  As my DI once told us:  "Training is one thing.  Combat is
another.  We can only train you here for combat & give you a chance to
survive it.  But, everything comes down to the real deal in combat.  Its
kill or be killed.  Unlike training where it is pass or fail.  You will
survive a fail, but you will not survive death."

jump drive with the full energizing functionality; merchants had a stripped
down drive that got its power from the gate, and away it went.

At the time, the idea about using jump fuel as displacement matter in jump
had not occurred to me; I thought it was strictly for a quick energy boost
from a jump-specifc power plant.

Of course, at a certain point I part ways with canon anyway, so its just
one more difference between my game and "vanilla" Traveller.

As to how they compared to real-worl objects: Without the combat rules. it
was a tad difficult to tell.  It looked like the weights were OK, but the
armor values (assuming actual armor thickness) seemed rather low.  Alos,
there were some challenges in the engine area; the power plants sized a
little big, and ended up a little too fuel-thirsty.

I will say that most of the differences were within my own personal
fudge-factor of 10%, however.  I am probably a gearhead heretic, but I
allow for a certain level of slop in vehicle designs.  For non-starships,
this slop is 10%.  For starships, this slop is a percentage equal to the
Naval Architect skill of he designer, or 5% if I am doing it up as a
"standard" design.

Of course I wasn\'t refering to just you.  Since there

Well, first of all, much of this is more detail than other approaches.
I\'ve seen nothing (for the "jump gas bubble theory") that answers 
similar question about how the hydrogen gets put into jump space
or what holds it around the ship.

Also, this level of detail is getting down into a detailed
explination of how the drive works, which (since it is
impossible to do in current physics) is something that
the suspension of disbelief handles. The difference here
is that we have general ideas that hand together (you
use hydrogen because it is fusion and you can stick
a lot of energy in because the same effect that needs
a lot of energy allows it).  This is better (to me at
least) than trying to stick on theory into the requirements
for another.  In any case, even if we want to quibble
about this, one isn\'t any further along than one is
with other theories and you still have the fact that you are 
making a new theory try and fit an additional set of arbitrary
restirction so it can work like the old one.

However, even is we accept that a more stringent requirement for
this approach, we can, since we are being consistent all along,
have some hope to extrapolate.  For example, since supplying
energy to the lanthanum grid is the key to jump, the energy
gets channeled along the grid.  The kind of current carrier
that can withstand these energies is a Lanthanum grid that
is anchored in jump space (though it may be that any metal
anchored in jump space can withstand them, but only 
Lanthanum gets you there).  Of course it can be used
for weapons of mass destruction, it is fusion power
which is already known to produce the hydrogen bomb, but
that is nothing new.  The reason a normal fusion reactor
melts down is that you can\'t contain that much energy
and you can\'t channel it unless you have a huge sink
to throw it into (ie the Lanthanum grid anchored in
jump space).  The reason the amount of fuel depends on
volume is presumably the same reason it did under the
old theory (presumably because how much you can push
back jump space depends, in part, on huch energy you
put into it).

I would way that its because, for game purposes, having your maneuver 
drive hiccup doesn\'t really matter, esp. when compared to dying
in a misjump.

Right, that is why I contend that they need to be kept to a
minimum and why it is better to make one arbitrary change
to how power is tranfered than to make a similar change
to the entire jump theory.  It can\'t help but fit better
with the background and be more consistent with cannon.

Clearly we don\'t agree on this point.

At the time of writing PE, either we at CORE had a very rough draft of the

Marc and it was confirmed it would be added to T4.1. I\'m afraid it\'s too

SMELLS AND THE VARGR

Sam Thomas <sinbad@dfw.net> said, Re: Quoting, and the Vargr

FYI, these subraces are less well known in M0 times than in the MT/DGP

Eric Nolan mentioned:

Most importantly, as Marc himself keeps saying, don\'t judge alien races by
our own standards. What we consider \'flashy\' (gold lame et al) may barely
register in the average Vargr subconscious, whereas (please, I\'m not trying
to be funny or offensive here...) the body and mouth odours associated with
some humans (and barely frowned upon in some human circles) could be
considered the most extreme bad (or good?) taste... in summary, any alien
species provides an opportunity to turn your players\' concepts on their
head (anything to get away from the "person in furry suit" syndrome).

KEEPING CANON

aboulton@cix.compulink.co.uk (Andrew Boulton) asked Marc Miller:

>Agreed 100%. The question is, how are you going to make sure this happens?
IG 
>have made it very clear they neither know nor care about canon.

(1) Some writers brought in to write T4 stuff (even quite recently) don\'t
have a Traveller background and this can be seen clearly in their writing.
Trying to get them to keep to canon is clearly impossible.
(2) All writing for IG by CORE has tried to keep to canon wherever possible.
(3) However, all previous IG products have been written to such short
timescales that canon checking between writers was limited, and any further
canon checking was up to IG, i.e. we handed them our version of the
manuscript and it supposedly got edited (in the way that, IIRC, M0 *didn\'t*
for example). Early on, the understanding was that work would be provided
to IG and they would check things out with Marc in the final editing.
(4) Despite (2), and perhaps because of (3), some non-canonical data may
have squeezed its way into things like M0 (text only! We take no
responsibility for the sector data!), PE, etc.

WORLD BUILDER\'S SOFTWARE

"Christopher E. Webb" <cwebb@ctos.com> was asking about interest in
software for this topic.

FYI, if you want a \'canon\' Traveller world planet generator then the T4
World Designer\'s Handbook which I\'m working on at the moment will be
updating the MT and TNE systems. However, progress on this work may be
deferred if IG don\'t think seriously about coughing up the quite
considerable writers fees owed to me (and quite a few others).

Don\'t panic - the updates won\'t change any major \'canon\', simply add some
new concepts and update things for our current (still rather limited)
understanding of the universe.

HABITABLE WORLDS

Hal then asked about the problem of having habitable worlds around M class
stars, etc.

The T4 WDH will (hopefully) make it a bit clearer which worlds around any
sun (whatever their \'apparent\' UWP) will actually be habitable. The UWP has
many inherent limitations in what it can portray...

Ever seen an IG contract? I believe one is required to sign in your own
blood and donate one major organ for the honour of signing over all rights
to everything. And I\'m assured (from other friends who write for the RPG
industry) that IG do not "*pay* for it", i.e. their fees are hardly

The point is that the reason you want to do thing like  go to a gas 
giant to get hydrogen are clear if it\'s fusion.  It it\'s mass you
want to jump into jump space, you suddenly need arbitrary reasons
why it has to be hydrogen and not some material that, for example,
take up less storage space.

The idea that an effect that requires a large amount of energy
also means that it makes it easier to put a lot of energy
into it fits with our experience with nature (from equal
and opposite reactions to the microscopic reversibility of
physical processes).  The fact that you have to put energy
into a huge sink to get things to happen means that you
also have a huge sink to put energy into without melting
yourself down.  To me this makes the point a lot more
intuitive than arbitrarily fitting a theory to predetermined
requirements.

The key word in my statement and your reply is "sounded".  Funny isn\'t it,
I wrote that word and so did you.  There was no sound involved in the
process.  I need to be more careful of what I hear.  I accept your apology
and promise to be more careful in the future.

A lack of vocabulary is a limitation that we all suffer from from time to
time.  Working in a secondary language would make this even harder.  BTW,
you use the English language quite well.

I\'m nmot sure about that.  You take the fuel, powerplant space, and
space for a weapon that can only be fired once an hour, and I would
say you are going to be alot better off putting in more weapons t
hat you can fire whenever you want.

Unless ships can afford to carry extra weapons for occaisonal
special shots, you aren\'t going to be that interested.

It\'s not as simple as that.  We are talking enough energy to
turn a heat sink into plasma (unless of course it\'s very large,
but then you have to haul it around).

This relates to my original point----that what we know from
descriptive canon differs from what HG/MT produce. You are right, in
HG/MT a spinal hit is a kill, period (if the gun is big enough). A
factor T MG was ~5000dtons as I recall, so I think the smallest TL15
ship you could get one into was around 15,000 tons. 

A third stratagy to what you suggest above (using HG as canon, not
published ships/library data/etc.) would be to have numerous small
jump capable ships with big spinal guns. On hit with one is a kill,
even on a BB, so the best idea is to have more guns on more ships.
He kills 8 ships with his BatRon, but you have enough 15,000ton guys
to lose the 8, and kill the whole BatRon.

But since we know the historical debate was about BRs vs. BBs, not
BRs, BBs, or BCs (Battle Cruisers), we can assume the rules for
making ships that produced such results were in error. At least that
is how I look at it. I guess you could keep HG, but come up with
some wierd political reson for all the navies to use inferior
designs (which is also interesting...).

It is 1250 dtons. A (small!) Destroyer, Corvette might be a better
word.

For players, usually, yes. We always liked the idea that when the
Navy showed up you really noticed. A BatRon of Tigress BBs is parked
around the spaceside starport for liberty when your Far Trader shows
up. You are vectored through their (very loose) group and marvel at
the size of them, hell, they make the bloody *starport* look small!

I\'ve had military characters that were still in the Navy, but I was
assigned as a gig pilot on a Gazelle (the Dik dik), then after it
was wreaked the crew was split up and I was reassigned to a
Destroyer (the Cortez). We wanted the ships smaller for the scale it
gives you in the scheme of things. I hitched a ride on an AHL, though
which was interesting :-)

That said, Huge ships are canon IMHO, and I treat the Colonial
"Cruiser" and other wierd little toy navy ships as abberations.

	This is also a way I\'m thinking about. A second thing to be considered
	is the "canon" sycron jump necessary for fleet operations, like in
	"Knight Fall". So it must be posible to calculate jump for other
	ships, so that a complete fleet can exit in the same turn, just
	make some meson communications, course adjustments towards a GG
	and raise their black globes for drift.

	This exchange of jump syncronisation was one of the main path of
	infection in the wilds, where ships prefered to disable transponder.

Which is why I envoke the general treatement of jump drive in CT
and MT in including discussion of jump space intruding in due
to holes in the jump field, other examples of using just energy,
the connnection to a Lanthanum grid, etc.

True.  But we are also trying to fit with previous background.  If
you were tring to come up with an entirely new theory and didn\'t
mind all that old stuff about lanthanum being critical, etc.
then I would have no objections.  The jump bubble theory is
OK on it\'s own, but I think it is better to teak the old theory
than try and shoehorn a new into the canon requirement established
for the old theory.

It actually wasn\'t Occam\'s Razor, it was "KISS" (the design 
principal of "Keep It Simple Stupid") which may be related :-)

Well, yes.  That is trap.  Coming up with new theories is fun and
it is fun to tack things onto a background.  But, once the fun is
over the background is now weighted down with those new things

Well w/ all due respect to you and your expertise at being a network
administrator,  I don\'t think you or anyone else (save perhaps Nostradamus)
has any clue in hell what a computer is going to be like in the 57th century.
If u had been trained in the early 80s w/  no follow ups, u probably wouldn\'t
know what the hell was going on now much less in 3700 plus years.  It\'s my
understanding Virus was meant as a metaphor for technology beyond our current
understanding.  They chose to be explicit concerning the computer architecture
and were thus able to utilize Signal GK among other things.

Bloo,

This is mostly my opinion. However, Classic Traveller didnt have rules for
cyberware, predating Neuromancer as it did. TNE introduced them, together
with a number of other new ideas.

Now, you can argue pretty strongly that Trav does and has always had
cyberwear - the +1 Strength mod your Marine picks up is Muscle Replacement
etc, rather than 200 pushups a day for 4 years, your character with
Broker-4 has an implant with historical price data for most everything etc
etc.

You can also argue that cyberware is possible, but that, for some reason,
the Third Imperium doesnt do it, which is what I tried to do.

The third argument is that cyberimplants are impossible, even at TL12 and
up. This is possible, but difficult to justify.

I would finally note that the majority of Trav NPCs in various products
dont appear to have cyberware, so it either needs to be hiding "behind"
stats and skills, or for some reason it is heavily limited to certain persons.

Jump and Battle Riders

I\'m following this debate with interest, designing as I am a 90 kton
battleship and a 30 kton battlecruiser.

My feeling is that under FFS2 the most signifigant limit on a warship is no
longer volume but is rather surface area and mass. Jump drives and fuel
tankage, whilst volume intensive, add relativly little in the way of
either. But we need to do a lot more design work to be sure.

****************************

Required Execution

In Australia, I was under the impression that at an auction, a vendor was
required to accept any price that exceeds the previously set reserve price.
You can\'t just go "Nope. Not enough" once the reserve price is exceeded.

The reason the rule is there is to stop players going "Nope. We wait until
we make money" and getting a new roll each week on their speculative cargo.

General: This \'how does jump drive work\' thread has got more than tedious
so for Legate\'s erudition here is current \'canon\', quoting FFS2:

- ----
Faster-Than-Light Drives

The standard method in Traveller has always been the jump drive, which
pushes a ship into a tunnel through "jump space." Due to the nature of
"jumpspace," the fall through the tunnel takes about the same amount of
time (168 hours) regardless of distance. This is a rather unique feature of
jumpspace--no matter how far a ship travels, it stays in jumpspace for
about 124(2d6x6) hours. The distance traveled is controlled by the amount
of energy a jump drive can channel to create the opening. Thus, jump drives
are rated by their maximum distance, measured in parsecs (1 parsec = 3.26
light years).

Jump Drive Operation

The jump drive consists of two main components: the drive, itself, and a
lanthanum hull grid. The grid is applied to the exterior of the ship, and
the cost of the grid (and installation) is included in the cost of the
drive. The drive is connected to the hull grid network. The:jump drive
requires fuel (liquid hydrogen) and energy (electricity). Practically all
of the energy and fuel are consumed in creating the tunnel through
jumpspace. Once the tunnel ise open, the ship must enter jumpspace or risk
damage, misjump, or destruction. The amount of fuel required for a
successful jump is equal to 10% of the displacement of the ship per parsec
of jump distance attempted. The amount of energy required to initiate a
jump is equal to 64MJ per cubicmeter per parsec jumped. This energy must be
provided to the drive in an hour or less (meaning that a starship must have
0.018MW of power plant per cubic meter per jump number).

Once in jumpspace, the jump drive maintains a small bubble of real space
around the ship, using power input to the jump drive from the power plant
(0.018MW per cubic meter per jump number). The fuel remaining in the jump
drive\'s surge tank is used to create a thin hydrogen atmosphere around the
ship during jump, which helps to delay the, collapse of the jump bubble. If
power to the drive is interrupted, the bubble collapses, causing jump
sickness, death of crew members, misjump, damage, or destruction of the
(any or all of these, at the referee\'s option).

Sorry I miswrote I didn\'t mean the AHL, I meant the Kinuur Class
Frontier Cruisers. And now that I think about them, weren\'t they even

Well, anyway my point is that, to me, Traveller doesn\'t mean really big
ships slugging it out. It means little ships...PC sized ships...in the
100 to 3,000 ton range. More toward the 100 end than the 3,000 end as
well. ;->

even a couple of BRs should kill a big BB, no problem (At TL 15 I\'d
say 3 BRs as small as possible that hold a T MG will kill *any* BB
published. They will no doubt be cheaper, too).

In the TNE game BattleRider (unmodified) the BRs will win as well

Except that jumpspace is still part of our physical universe. No mass is
lost, it is just relocated to another part of the universe -- it is just put
"over there", as opposed to here. It\'s like moving an object from point a to
point b, but in 4D.

Bruce is right.  I\'m a player/GM in several PBEM games and "rolling" is
minimumized and "roleing" is maximized.  Tell you\'re brother that *you*
are going to make all the rolls that are needed, but it will be the
quality of his descriptions that settle most events.

Absolutely!  In one PBEM I\'m in a situation arose where my character
fired his pistol pointblank into the chest of an NPC (we\'re talking
execution here not combat) and the GM rules that I *missed* ;->!  He
*swears* he "rolled" that miss, but I really think he "ruled" it...if
you know what I mean.  OTOH, except for the occasional joke I make about
being such a bad shot that I can\'t hit the broad side of a Jocko I
raised no fuss and played on.  Players just have to TRUST that the GM
will be fair and won\'t abuse their trust.  

BTW, in case you think this GM is the sort that just won\'t kill, wrong! 
He\'s bumped off PC\'s left and right. ;->  

My advice is to do all the rolling yourself, and as little of it as you
can get away with. Heck! That\'s my advice for FTF games too. ;->

There seems to be some concerns about the "scientific validity" of the FIXED
amount of time a jump takes (approximately one standard week).  "Why the same
amount of time for a Jump-5 as a Jump-1?"

I\'ve always thought about it this way ...

My particle physics are a bit rusty, but as I recall from Nuclear Power Skewl
in the US Navy, electrons in atoms occupy discrete and FIXED energy levels
(which we choose to conceptualize as "shells" ... word on the streets is they
are really "quantum sphere probabilities").

You slam a certain amount of energy into an electron (usually in the form of a
photon) and *bam* it "jumps" (no pun intended) to another, FIXED, level in the
atom. There are only certain "legal" levels (i.e., the only ones that exist!),
and  the level it jumps to is dependent on the energy the photon imparted to
the electron. Most of the time, it jumps one or maybe two levels "up."  Later,
it may discharge the energy (again, in the form of a photon) and "drop back
down."

Regardless of how many levels an individual electron actually jumps, it occurs
(for all practical intents) instantaneously.  Now, it may be a bit hard to
conceptualize, but an instantaneous moment is a *FIXED* amount of time.
Electrons ALWAYS jump, and it ALWAYS takes the same amount of time (even if
the time is "no time at all").

See where I\'m going?  Punching that hole in hyperspace is an event similar to
changing the quantum state of an electron ... and depending upon the energy
imparted to the *punch* into hyperspace, you reach a different "energy level."
In game terms, your jump distance is determined by the power of your energy
*punch*.  And just like quantum states, there are only FIXED states that are
"allowed" in this universe, hence "Jump-1, Jump-2, Jump-3" ... etc.

"Dropping out of Jumpspace" is akin to an electron discharging energy and
emitting a photon to return to a lower energy level, in this case, returning
to "normal" space.

As far as the slighly random differential regarding the time in Hyperspace, I
just figure that that "instantaneous" moment we see in quantum mechanics
actually is some *slightly* varying time, and the elongated period of a Jump
simply magnifies a variable we\'d see if we were able to actually measure it.

Anyway, sorry for the long post, but maybe this will help with some of the
higher-order conceptual difficulties associated with Jump.

Conservation of energy seems to apply to closed systems, but it\'s really not
clear that the "Law" applies to the universe as a whole.

The dudes with the telescopes and the thinking caps are still working on it,
but it may be likely that the universe we\'re all experiencing together is a
dance of black holes and white fountains.

Some suck in (the black holes), some blow out (the white fountains) ... but on
the stellar, galactic, and universal scales, I\'m not sure the ledger sheets
are always "balanced."  I mean, this rock get a LOT of energy from that ball
of fire 1 AU away, huh?

Just a thought!

I prefer the beauty of the CT/T4 system, actually.  It is far more random
than a system that applies damage to hit locations with fixed amounts of
hit points.  If an arm can take, say, 8 points of damage, you pretty much
know exactly what will happen if it does take 8 points.

With CT/T4, those 8 points can be applied to the three physical stats in a
multitude of ways.  If a character\'s three physical stats are all of
different values, a hit to one could automatically render him unconscious,
while a hit to another may not.  A character could take 20 points of damage
and be close to death, or he could still be conscious and active.  In a
way, this does away with any extra dice rolling involving staying
conscious, etc.

Also, the current system works well with either point-source damage or
explosives.  Hit locations with regards to explosions are either handled
inappropriately (eg: damage caused to only a couple of locations) or made
needlessly complicated (eg: *all* hit locations take the same amount of
damage).

I\'ve been thinking about it this way:

STR hits represent injuries to bones, tendons, and other critical areas
required to apply a character\'s strength (not necessarily muscle mass).
Mainly arms and legs, but not including hands and feet.

DEX hits represent head hits (loss of motor control, shock) and hand/feet
injuries (loss of manipulation and/or balance).

END hits represent mainly trunk hits (general fatigue and/or blood loss).

Just MHO.

From some of the postings on this list, it would appear that IG seems NOT TO
PAY AT ALL for some of the content they publish.

Contract-law wise, that means they never really "purchased the rights."
"Purchasing" implies timely payment for services or products rendered.

They may have signed contracts and other legal mumbo-jumbo, but it don\'t mean
didly if they aren\'t forthcoming with the Credits.

Its sad to see great content not reaching an obviously interested audience
because a company seems to practice such unprofessional and unethical

Well, if you are willing to get CompuServe accounts, CB (their chat
equivalent) has a "Roll" command. It "rolls" 2D6 and displays the
results to everybody on that channel. It was put in *specifically* to
allow online gaming.

Oh yeah, it displays *both* dice, not the sum.

That certainly would be a nice feature.  Whoever it was that was thinking

Well, Andrew, I really am perplexed on how Marc intends to *use* this +d-d.
I just can\'t see how it works unless you total all the dice and take the
resulting number out of *one* pot. Is he going to stay with hits reducing
Characteristics or reducing some sort of hit point total?

I was hoping Marc would shed a little light on this.

This is a set of ideas I\'ve been toying with. 

How about a dual track system for damage?

I.  The LIFE FORCE track is the sum of STR+CON+WILL (avg 21).

        [Note the inclusion of WILL.]
        
    a.  The *sum* of damage dice comes off this total.  
   
    b.  To stay conscious you have to succeed at a 3d task against your
        remaining LIFE FORCE.
       
    c.  If remaining LIFE FORCE goes below 10 it will drop by 1 each
        turn until medical attention is received, or you achieve a
        critical success at the 3d task.
        
    d.  When remaining LIFE FORCE falls below 3 you are automatically
        unconscious, but you keep rolling each turn trying to make that
        critical success.  (That\'s 3 ones, in my system.)

    e.  If remaining LIFE FORCE falls to -LIFE FORCE you are *dead*,
        irretrievable dead.
        
    f.  LIFE FORCE is regained slowly, and only after combat ends and
        the character is resting, generally through medical attention.
        
II. The Skill Degradation track reduces Attributes die by die.

    a.  Different body locations affect different Attributes
    
        1.  Head:       INT, EDU
        
        2.  BODY:       STR, END
        
        3.  ARMS:       STR, DEX
        
        4.  LEGS:       END, AGL

            [Note both AGL & DEX, I include both, if you don\'t, you
             just use DEX for both.]

    b.  A roll is made for hit location. 
    
        [Glen has a good one, as does TNE.]
        
    c.  Each die is applied to affected Attributes one after another in
        a round robin fashion.
        
    d.  Attributes can be reduced below 0 affecting completion of tasks,
        but not otherwise affecting the character.
        
    e.  Each turn no damage is taken 1 point is added back to *1*
        Attribute of the player\'s choice.

When we were discussing the ship earlier, I wondered why they didn\'t drop
some on the way out.

You could get an adequate setup with 9 double 100,000 AU directional
transceivers.  But then again there would be the power problem, etc.  Hmmm,
if any one is interested, I might be persuaded to design them.

No, it\'s a form of physical reality/existance.

The formation of a "jump bubble" requires both energy and matter.  The
details are not explained, but from the things that are said, I would say
that you use the energy to set up a kind of net to hold the LHyd in place.
Perhaps in these discussion of jump drive, we should not refer to the LHyd
as fuel, because in this instance, it isn\'t fuel anymore than diesal is fuel
when used to lubricate and clean light weight machinery

I think that I read somewhere the turn around time with standard maintenance
is 18 hours.  With out, it could be a matter of minutes, but your risk
factor is higher.  A third jump w/o maintenance would be almost certain
disaster.

Take even a 100,000 (the largest size colony discussed) out of a
1,000,000,000 and what kind of dent do you make?  The answer:  none!  OTOH,
there is always the propaganda machine to turn this into a solution if you

I live on a high population world (6,000,000,000+), that doesn\'t stop me
from trusting total strangers with all kinds of stuff.  The people they are
going with will not be strangers.  They will go through training and
orientation together.  They might even have been friends before applying for
the colony.

As a hopeful contributor to THUDDD 9, perhaps I\'m not the best one to offer
to help...

OTOH, maybe I am.  Here\'s my suggestion.  Why don\'t you allow those who are
willing, to take as many designs as they care to evaluate (one at a time).

This initial evaluation would be solely to determine whether they actually
did the design properly.  They would answer questions like:  Is there enough
fuel tankage?  Is the acceleration properly figured?  Does the volume fit
within the hull specified?  Etc.

These "fault finders" would only check to see if the numbers added up.
There only job would be to find mistakes in the designs, not to do any kind
of judging.  Then weather the designs checked out or not, they would be
"returned" to you for actual judging.  In fact the designs wouldn\'t have to
be emailed back, only the notes.  Then when you receive the technical
reports, you can make sure that the Reviewer hasn\'t made a mistake (which
will be tons easier on you than reviewing the designs).  The process might
take a little longer, but, IMHO, would result in better designs.

The reason I think that I, as a hopeful contributor, would actually make a
good ISBA TRB member is that the only thing I could do would be to find the
problems with the someone else\'s design (which the judge would double
check).  Since a problem would eliminate a design, I would be motivated to
find them, if for no other reason than to eliminate one design that might be
competing with mine.  :-)

Well David, let\'s see if we can\'t clear that up a bit.  If the Jump Drive
had the same efficiency (energy output per unit of fuel) as a Fusion power
plant (a technology introduced at the same point TL9), that should give us a
better picture of what we are talking about.  The smallest JD allowed would
pass 10 tons of fuel through in a matter of seconds.  For comparison, that\'s
enough fuel to run a minimal Fusion PP-9 for almost a year (14/15 of a year
to be precise).

Let\'s run some numbers, shall we?  For the sake of argument, let\'s say a
year is 360 days long and the conversion process takes 8 seconds.  So we are
talking about 360 days x 14 / 15 x 24 hours/day x 3600 seconds/hour x 1,000
m^3 x 2 MW / m^3 = 58,060,800,000 megawatt seconds.  That gives us a through
put of 7,257,600,000 megawatts per second.  This is an amount of power that
is almost impossible to comprehend.  To give you something for comparison,
that\'s the equivalent of putting 35,954 square km of the sun\'s surface
inside a 140 cubic meter box.

I know what you mean.  When a friend of mine and I had disagreement about
which were better we decided to go with a "Trillion Credit Showdown".  The
rules we agreed on were simple, anything in Traveller (CT) went.  If it was
cannon, you could use it.  He built a handful of huge ships.  I on the other
hand built a handful of open structure tenders and thousands (ok hundreds)
of small fighters, capable of mounting those tiny meson guns from Stryker
(gosh I wish I still had those books).

On first approach, he assume it would be a toe to toe slug fest.  You should
have seen the look on his face when my heavies disintegrated.  It was
tedious, but it was a slaughter.  (I think he finally managed to escape with
a couple of scouts.  I lost less that 30% of my fleet.)

You must mean the Gravisonic Modulator.  The Gravisonic Modulator is
first developed (at TL 11) in a bulky "iron lung" type format.  At TL 12
it is refined to become a barely portable piece of equiptment used at
all good hospitals.  At TL 13 it is a portable standard Shipboard
sickbay item.  At TL 14 it is integrated into the standard AutoMedic. 
By Tl 15 it is portable.  

"The gravisonic modulator works using a variation of the standard
artificial gravity floorfield used in your starship.  It forces a very
weak (0.01 - 0.05 G) gravity field pulse into the patients body.  Using
a special type of modulation we force the beam to act only on gases.  It
therefore forces the gas bubbles out of the patient blood, preventing
ebullism.  Please note that these devices _must_ be used with extreme
care around the lungs to avoid affecting them.  To use the TL version of
the modulator the patient must be on a high pressure respirator.

Some of you may be wondering just how we get the modulator to affect
gases only.  The exact answer to that question is a trade secret but
basically the units  sonic sensors can sense the density of the
substance they are affecting.  You should also note that if you switch
the unit to reverse you can use it to recarbonate any flat sodas you
have :)"

Gravisonic Modulator

TL 	Vol	Mass 	Cost	

11	1 kl	250kg	75,000
12	50l	40kg	50,000
13	2 l	1.5kg	10,000
14  	included in a standard Auto Medic or if seperate
	1 l	1 kg	2,500
15	0.25 l	0.25 kg	1,000

All Medical recovery tasks for treating Vaccum exposure are 1 level
easier if a Gravisonic Modulator is used.  If using the TL 11 version of
the modulator a seperate Fatefull Routine test of Med & Dex must be made
to use the modulator.

Bummer.  You can look on the web or newsgroups.  If you\'re not following the
threads u might want to stay away from direct ordering from IG.  : ) I got an
SoM at an admittedly hideous price, but it was all a question of how much i
wanted it. I\'ve just acquired Supplement 9: Fighting Ships for 12 bucks
(including S&H).  That\'s not bad at all.  I\'ve got a decent line on a trade
for some of my old d&d stuff for the 2 DGP alien volumes.  Try
rec.games.frp.marketplace.  Don\'t make any posts unless u want big time spam
and/or got blockers ready : )

    Technically speaking, it would be impossible for non Christian to be
considered a Heretic.  Heathen, even, was generally reserved for Islam and
pagans.   Jews that would be burned as heretics would be those (especially
during the Reconquista of Spain) who converted publically but privately
refused to and were caught by the Inquisition.  It was usually the Great
Unwashed who persecuted Jews.  The upper crust almost always used them
extensively in the Middle Ages (a Christian was forbidden Usury until
relatively recently) xcept when someone wanted popular support for something
when Jews were a convenient scapegoat. 
     Ob trav...  hmm...  Something similar could be based on any govt type...
religious oligarchies and dictatorships especially.  Religious players
enthusiastically participating or (more likely) helping people escape and/or
thwarting the zealots.

This may be why the rebellion caused such trouble.  One of the tones of
the rebellion; made most obvious in Survival Margin, the Rebellion SB,
and Hard Times; was that the fleets available to all combatants were
steadily shrinking throughout the conflict.  New ship construction could
not keep up with the losses.  This is what caused the end of the
rebellion & the onset of Hard Times.  If Lucan had still had large
fleets he might not have had Virus developed.

_If_ the Imperial Navy had not switched to the Battle Rider concept
their ship losses would not have been so high, the war would not have
been so harsh, Virus might not have been released & the Empire might not
have fallen.  Someone needs to give those Imperial Navy strategists who
developed the Battle Rider concept a good swift kick in the you know
where as it looks as if they made the whole Rebellion even worse.

I have, but the problem is I live in a large town (Phoenix, AZ) and the
only stores that carry gaming stuff in my area carry only T$R.  In order to
get Palladium I have to drive across town.  When I got my MT stuff I was
back home in Decatur, IL & drove to Bloomington, IL to buy it there.

Thank you for the information.  The Great Unwashed are still around & the
other day I was at the Rusty Pelican & a little (6 or 7 y/o) girl came up
to me & say the Yellow Star of David Armband I wear everyso often & asked
me "Are you a Jew?"
"Yes" I said.
"I understand that you worship the devil & like to kill babies" she said.
"What gave you that idea" I asked.
"My mommy" she said.
Well I walked out of there & on the way out I asked the Mother why did she
tell her daughter that.
She said it was what her Priest told her.
I could not think of a witty remark to say here so I just turned & left stunned.

It was sad really.  To have in this day & age the same things that the
Inquisition felt are still around.

Well, I kinda like the idea of the Players being the Zealots.  Awhile back
a clerical career was posted that would do the job.  Now remember a zealot
is not a bad thing in & of itself, its how you use it, great for RP.  Like
a zealot of a God of Healing is a good thing, but a zealot of a God of
Death is a bad thing, esp on a starship in jump space with access to a
airlock.  Btw, this did happen once in a MT game I was in as a player.  I
thought the rest of the players were going to kill me for that. ;<)

Leonard, Bloo, guys -

Thanks for the advice, but when I submitted the articles to WD I
effectively cut a deal on copyright with GW, and I\'ll stick by it. Looks
like I can post the stuff if I want to, so long as I make it clear it\'s
theirs. That\'s good enough.

Thanks again :)

Of course.  But if leaving out a rule "that works" speeds up game play, why
not make it optional?  This may be an excuse, but it is a valid one.

Umm... Sorry, but I still haven\'t understood how adding it would improve
the game, regardless of the detailed mechanics. Sure it gives a wider range
of damage results, but it does complicate the damage roll, even if only a
little. The group I play with, like myself, want this part of the game to
be fast and furious - so maybe this is a style-of-play issue.

OK, I\'ve had my $0.02, I\'ll shut up now :)

01/30/98 10:45 AM

For those who asked, here is a summary of the colonisation programme
outlined in Duncan Lunan\'s book "Man and the Stars" (Souvenir Press, 1974).

Lunan assumes that the planet in question is habitable without major
life-support, and has locally evolved life - what 2300 AD would call a
Garden world. This scenario isn?t necessarily perfect, but it does give a
useful skeleton to hang fictional histories on.

Evaluation (Pop level 2)
====================
Team of 20 (bare minimum) to 100 (preferred) landed on planet to evaluate
and prepare for colonisation. Stays for at least two local years before
clearing the planet for colonisation. Preferred team consists of:

40 scientists (meteorogoists, archaelogists, at least seven different types
of biologist, agronomists, astronomer, doctor, psychologist, linguist in
case of aliens, etc)

40 survival experts/guards

20 assorted technicians, engineers, and ship crew (the team?s starship
stays in orbit for backup)

During this period the team has to check how the proposed introduction of
alien species will affect local life, survey and assess the habitability of
an area the size of Britain, probably an island or peninsula (more
defensible).

Lunan assumes round-trip times of up to five years between Earth and the
colony, so assumes that many of the eval team settle there. Part of the
logic behind there being a hundred or more people is to give them a chance
of survival and growth if suddenly cut off from their homeworld.

(How about a THUDD contest for an evaluation team delivery ship? Should be
able to carry this lot and enough gear to run them for two years (a hundred
tons of stuff?), plus a few vehicles, and deploy them to ground level with
a couple of ship?s boats. Probably unarmed.

Maybe other THUDD contests for wave 1, 2, 3 colony ships...)

Wave 1 Colonisation (Pop level 3)
=============================
Aimed at agriculture, mapping and prospecting.

1,000 colonists. 900 farmers, 900 newlyweds (not necessarily the same 900),
50 military personnel, 50 specialists, including 10 teachers and 2 doctors.
The military are there to maintain internal discipline, not to counter
external threats.

These guys arrive between 2-5 years after the eval team, and have up to 5
years to work up the agricultural base to support wave 2, plus any children
they have themselves in the meantime. They are all trained in arms, mainly
so they can hunt - they have to grow their own animals from embryos and
don?t have time to domesticate local species. They also conduct mineral
surveys for the benefit of wave 2.

They are organised along communist lines, in a cell system for mutual
support. This does not reflect their politics necessarily, it?s just an
organisation that should work considering the basic unit of exchange will
be foodstuffs for the next 15 years or so.

Their tech level is probably 4-5 for the most part, as they need to be able
to maintain equipment themselves without a sophisticated technical base.
Odd items (weapons and medical gear) will be higher tech.

Lunan assumes that more than 1,000 people will be too hard to control and
protect, and that landing several dispersed groups each of 1,000 people
will lead to friction between them.

By the end of this wave, cultivated land and labour are at a premium; there
is a tendency to feudalism, which is very likely to win if the colony is
cut off.

Wave 2 Colonisation (Pop level 3)
=============================
Aimed at developing industry and mines.

2,000 colonists; miners, ore extractors, some more farmers.

They arrive between 7-12 years after the eval team. The cell system has to
phase out here - not sure from the book what replaces it. Their tech level
is probably up around 7-8, there are more of them and more opportunity to
specialise.

Wave 3 Colonisation (Pop level 3-4)
===============================
Aimed at stabilising the civilisation. Consumer goods start to be produced
locally, e.g. washing machines.

4,000 colonists; technical specialists and service people, plus more
farmers. These people run the light industries

They arrive 15-17 years after the eval team. By the end of this wave the
colony is self-supporting, at around tech level 8-9.

Wave 4 Colonisation (Pop level 4)
=============================
Aimed at expanding the colony.

Doubles the size of the colony at a stroke. This is so the newcomers can?t
simply take over, they have to expand. The second-wave children are now in
their late teens, and help to fuel the expansion. There are probably about
25,000 people on the planet after this wave lands.

Regular flights are now set up to the colony?s mother world, so a starport
is presumably built.

What feels arbitrary to me is the theory that Jump Drives are capable of

Excellent. So if realspace momentum is conserved in jump, you will jump
insystem and poof! an expanding cloud of hydrogen appears out of nowhere,
flying down your previous trajectory. You then make a course change and
exit the cloud. Some time later:

"Sir, I see their emergence cloud. When they jumped insystem they had a

a couple of hours."

That is exactly the problem. Why do you need the fuel? The CT jump drive
had the following characteristics:

1)	ALL jump fuel was used BEFORE the ship entered jump space
	(Evidence: Drop tanks).
2)	A jump drive of a given sized required a power plant of a given
	minimum size.
3)	The capacitors of a jump drive held a comparatively small charge
	(I don\'t have the books here, so I can\'t give the exact figures,
	but they can be calculated from the Black Globe absorbtion rules).
4)	Even if all energy was applied from outside, you still needed jump
	fuel to initiate the jump.
5)	The hydrogen used for jump fuel had to be in pure form rather than
	as a compound like water or ammonia (Both of which gives you more
	hydrogen per volume).

Now, some of those things were changed in MT, and I\'m not going to try to
fit the MT version into the explanation. I don\'t know exactly how FF&S2
explains it, but the explanation that I came up with is that very little
of the jump fuel is turned into energy. What little that is (enough to
fill the capacitors) is enough to create the jump bubble, to open the
interface into the jumpspace dimension, and to propel the ship into
jumpspace.

However, there is a problem. Do you know that if you hit water with
sufficiently high speed, the result is exactly the same as if you\'d hit
a solid surface? The water don\'t have time to move away and is as rigid
as steel for a brief instant. In the same way jumpspace is too dense for
a ship just to slip across the interface. So the ship projects a bunch
of hydrogen into jumpspace ahead of itself. This creates a bubble (a bad
choice of word, perhaps, because it can be confused with the jump bubble
that is created by powering the jump grid, so let\'s say opening instead).
It creates an opening for a brief moment where the ship can enter
jumpspace. Once inside jump space there is no need for more hydrogen to
keep this space open, since the ship is already inside. The jump bubble
is maintianed by the power plant (that\'s why you need a power plant of
a certain size).

As for why you need more hydrogen to make an opening into higher
jumpspaces, those higher jumpspaces are denser and requires more to
create the same sized opening.

Using completely pure hydrogen creates a predictable environment and
allows the computer to predict the jump exactly. Impurities in the
hydrogen introduces unpredictable variables. Mostly ithe jump goes
all right anyway, but once in a while it creates a misjump.

As I said before, this explanation is not perfect, but it is IMO the best
one yet that explains the 5 points above without opening up undesirable
corrolaries.

Oh, yes, one last point: Why would they call it jump fuel if it isn\'t
used for fuel? Well, a little bit of it IS used for fuel, and the very
same substance is used to fuel the power plant, so for convenience it
is all called fuel rather than distinguish between the part that is used
for fuel and the part that is used for "access mass".

I agree. It oosen\'t fit with the fact that all jump fuel is used up before
the jump.

Same problem. All the fuel is used before the jump.

I believe it. For years, my father-in-law (himself tolerant of other
religions - he let me, a foreign heretic, marry his daughter) would
occasionally test people\'s views on this matter by saying: "I think they
should kill all barbers and Jews."

He reports that the most common answer he got was "Why barbers?"

Scary, isn\'t it?

Thank you. That\'s a good scenario idea - I occasionally run time travel

I have a use now!

Dice pools.

As an example, let us say you have tactics 3. This gives you 3 extra dice to
roll at any time in the combat. In this example you have a 3D task and total
asset of 10. The roll is 4,5,5 for 14. You failed, but then you say I spend
2 tactics dice and you roll a 2 and a 3. With this you take the lowest
numbers (2,3,4) on the required number of dice (3). Now the roll is 9. You
succeed due to your tactical savvy.

For strength bonuses in hand to hand. All melee weapons would have a minimum
and advantageous strength. If you did not have at least the minimum you
would roll an extra die on the damage check and take the lowest. And vice
versa for advantageous. You expend one strength pool for each swing. You
would have to expend a number of strength pool dice equal to the base damage
of the weapon to get a bonus die. There, of course, would be a maximum
number of extra dice, equal to the original dice. When you have exhausted
your strength pool you take a penalty to damage

eg.
Knife Str Min 4/Adv 8, Dmg 1D (max 2D)
Sword Str Min 6/Adv 11, Dmg 2D (Max 4D)

THus Wimpy Will (Str 3 could get a bonus die by spending one from his
strength pool, bring him to normal damage, since he takes a penalty due to
his pitiful strength)
When he uses a sword he can spend two of his dice to get a bonus die, and
the one for the swing. On this roll he gets 2D (base damage) plus a bonus
die (spent pool) minus a die (for weak strength) for a net total of 2D. The
next turn he takes a penalty for his weakness, another for his exhausted
strength pool, so he rolls 4D and takes the lowest 2.

Big Bill (Str 13) swings his sword and decides to put extra effort into it.
He expends 4 for the effort of the sword (2 strenght pool for each bonus
die) and one for the swing but he rolls 2D (base damage) + 2D (extra effort)
 + 1D (high strength) for 5D and he takes the best two. 

Any comments?
Questions?
Does this make sense?

It\'s not really non-canon. The Gazelle class close escort and numerous
other vessels from the CT period had L-hyd drop tanks, allowing
them the additional fuel and lower mass to boost their Jump capabilty.

All the "Jump Gate" does is replace the drop-tank with a
"droppable" space station.

Personally, I think it makes a lot of sense, especially for
low tech spacefaring societies. It gives a Babylon 5 or
(for the oldies) a StarForce/Outreach, feel to  the environment.

Yeah.

Just thought I\'d comment that IG\'s policy in this regard is
what prevented nme from even considering sending in any work
for JTAS. (Not that that\'s neccessarily a great loss)

Ain\'t no way I\'m giving a company total copyright

Perhaps I should have said "In the context of the Traveller Mailing List,
and the discussions on Traveller Canon, being called a \'heretic\' is akin to
a backhanded compliment. Ask Eris..." That would have been more specific to
the meaning I wanted to convey. It wasn\'t meant to be a comment on real

I put together a minimalist design to act as a baseline against which to
compare the entries. (The Postmark Design Bureau was unfortunately
unable to submit a design due to a high priority order (a ship for my players)
and I got the dates all wrong :-(

Assuming no fundamental problems with Andy\'s spreadsheet (and since all
the expensive stuff (eg jump drives) is correct, I expect none,
then I would suggest that merchants can be built for 10std/MCr.
weapons/armour/thrust/semsors/computers/jump/power factors all point
to larger ships being more cheaper per ton carried.

I think that the problem is most of the merchant designs around are a bit
too role-playing driven and not cost driven, so are far too expensive.
Especially in established, safe areas.

With this revision, the cost differential between military and civilian ships
heads towards 10:1, which, IIRC, was what some members of the list wanted
last year.

Yes. This is probably a foolish commitment, especially since members
would have to get designs done before they vetted other peoples or
not enter at all (I could certainly achieve option 2).

Hy folks,

even If I\'m a TNE freak, I like adopting rules from other sources.
I think to remember that HG had a tl-computer-size limit table.
Can anybody who have it, be so nice to type it in (6 rows are
not much ;-) and to post it here.>>>>>

 From my understanding of US contract law, there has to be 
consideration if the contract is to be valid. If none has been agreed 
upon, the contract is not valid. If: as here, there has been 
consideration agreed upon, but on side is not fulfilling it\'s side of 
the contract, the other side can sue for payment or voiding the 
contract. However, do not, i repeat do not wait to long, because

I feel safe to say that none of us mind you commenting on Traveller (that\'s
what the TML is here for).    All of us have parts that we don\'t like or
notions that we would like to see introduced into the game.  The key to
civil discourse in such a forum is consideration.  When I first started
playing Traveller (CT that is) 17 or 18 years ago, I didn\'t like the jump
drive either.  I still can\'t say that I\'m overly fond of it.  But, it is
integral to what Traveller is.  If you want to use some other FTL system,
then you are not playing Traveller.

Of all the RPG\'s I have seen, Traveller has the best technology
systems/descriptions bar none.  Even in CT there was an attention to
scientific detail that made Traveller a cut above anything else available
(then or now).  With the introduction of Stryker (a forerunner to FF&S), you
could actually design vehicles that made sense.  There were parts that
weren\'t perfect, but when you try to simulate life that\'s to be expected.

If you gave them the rights in exchange for pay and they don\'t pay
you, then they\'re in breach of contract and the contract is null and
void and the rights are yours.  You can\'t have a contract unless
there is an exchange of goods or services.

No, they don\'t "attract weapons fire", they simply absorb weapons fire.  

When they are turned "on" (100%) they absorb all the energy and every 
shot hits (there are no other defenses active).  When they are on 
"flicker" they absorb energy from hits after other screens are 
considered...

In the original descussion, the trip out was to take a millinium.  After a
thousand years, who is going to remember that there was a colony?  Even if
they could get back just 50 years after establishing the colony, they would
be trading with complete strangers.  Consider how our world has changed in
the last 1,000 years.  Then try to imagine how a person from 1898 would do
trying to trade with us today.

The Lanthanum grid was a new explanation at one time. There is no reason
why the grid can\'t coexist with the hydrogen bubble.

Here are some things that, imho, any jump theory needs to explain:

- - How does a ship enter jumpspace?
- - How does a ship travel once in jumpspace?
- - Why does a jump drive need so much Hydrogen?
- - Why is a jump 168hrs +/- 10%, no matter what distance travelled?

Here\'s brief synopsis of how I explain them -- there he goes again!
Crazy Glenn and his jumpspace theories...

Note that I try and fit with the latest published "canon", while getting
a bit more specific. I believe it\'s a relatively simple explanation.
YMMV

- - A ship enters jumpspace by creating a special exotic particle field,
that surrounds the ship. This field "pinches" the ship out of normal
space, allowing it to enter jumpspace.
- - Before entry, the ship\'s computer calculates the energy and particle
density required to allow it to reach a destination.
- - This particle field is created by a reaction in the ship\'s Lanthanum
grid, initiated and energized by the Jump drive proper.
- - Energy from the ship\'s power plant is required to initiate the
reaction.
- - The reaction cannot be stopped once started, and requires 168hrs +/-
10% to come to an end.
- - The particle field needs to be of a particular density and energy,
depending upon what "level" of jumpspace is being entered, and the
distance the ship wants to travel.
- - In order to keep the particle density of the field constant, large
quantities of gas need to be released. The Lanthanum Grid includes a gas
release system.
- - This atmosphere surrounds the ship, and prevents the outside pressure
of jumpspace from collapsing upon the ship; keeping the exotic particle
field far enough away that jumpspace incursion does not occur.
- - Hydrogen is used because of its abundance, simplicity, lightness, and
relative inertness to jumpspace matter.
- - Jumpspace matter is composed of "Tachyons" -- the speed of light is a
*lower* limit.
- - Actual travel to the destination is therefore nearly instantaneous.
The time spent in jumpspace is merely a result of gradually allowing the
Lanthanum Grid reaction to terminate, resulting in a *controlled*
dispersal/collapse of the Jumpspace Field. The ship "precipitates" into
normal space at that time.

Amazing coincidence - that is also my test system (I actually owned one once).
I havent tried it on VDSD 1.0 yet but I bet that it would work decently as

enough fuel in reserve for a J-1 out system to a deep space location

trouble, they can meet the tender there and then boogie away.  A certain

the tender and the requirements that the BR\'s defend it, while
minimizing the extent to which the fighting ships are penalized by
having to armor and accelerate fuel and jump drive.  One variation was
droppable fuel tanks the same displacement as the BR\'s which could be
presstationed at the deep space rendezvous by the same tender.  This
would be more of a system defense forces retreat and regroup sort of
scenario.  Of course, locating a deep space iceteroid would be even
better, but this is for strictly defensive scenarios.

I never got a chance to try this in a TCS game, but it might be fun.

Has anyone tried anything similar with newer flavors of Traveller?

Once could be an accident.  But twice?  No.  So the 36 above was no typo.
Ok, how do you figure?  What did you read that made you think you can get 36
parsecs out of a jump drive engine?  (I\'m not being critical, I\'m looking

Actually, our skin is quite adequate to handle exposure to vacuum. It\'s
just that it needs some support against the pressure differential. It
can handle the "gas tight membrane" function of a suit on it\'s own.

That\'s where the idea of a "skin suit" comes from. It\'s basicly a
*close* fitting elastic leotard, with padding in the areas where the
body isn\'t convex. 

The problem is designing such a suit that fits tightly enough, but that
you can get into and out of. :-)

You also need a sort of "bladder" over the chest area to allow for
breathing. Anybody who has hung vertical in the water and tried
breathing through a snorkel knows how hard even a *small* pressure
differential makes breathing.

The nice thing about skin suits is that you don\'t need the fancy
cooling system. If you get too warm, you sweat, the sweat evaporates
and cools you. In space this works even better than in an atmosphere. 

At a higher tech level it ought to be possible to have the suit expand
so it\'s easy to get into, then shrink to the required tight fit. They\'d
still need to be individually tailored, but this\'d make them easier to
use.

Add another tech level or so, and the "fabric" may be sturdy enough for
you to do things like shower with it on. Spacers might wear them the
way you\'d wear long johns. In case of an emergency, you\'d pull out
"plastic bag" helmet and seal it to the neck ring. Then you\'d attach
the gloves (you could operate without the gloves for an extended
period, but fluid accumulation in them would cause damage much like
frostbite (G. Harry Stine calls it "vac bite")).

So unless you caught a spacer while he was in the john or taking a
shower, he\'d be ready in a matter of seconds. 

Oh yeah, I\'d make the "bag" helmet designed so that it was still
possible to seat a proper  helmet while wearing it. That way, you\'d be
able to put on a regular helmet while still in vacuum, and not worry
about accidentally damaging the bag.

For this to work, the air inlets need to be below the neck ring. And of
course, you wear a comm "headset", rather than having the comm gear
built into the helmet.

For missiles, you\'d need "gravity" strong enough to have an "inverse
escape velocity" greater than the missile\'s approach velocity. For
beams, you\'d need an "inverse escape velocity" of c. 

By "inverse escape velocity", I mean the speed that would be escape
velocity if the field was attractive instead of repulsive. 

In any case, you can see that this is *way* beyond available tech.

and RPGs in general.

He bought a few Classic box games, and MegaTraveller rules,
and never liked them so much.  He\'s thinking T4 might be
okay, though.  I told him the supplements were well done
(I forgot to mention book 2), but to not worry about the
new rules book until it\'s revised.

He was unversed in the Gospel of Traveller, so I witnessed
to him about the Good Old Classic Days, and the coming of
Meticulous Megatrav and TNE, and how I thought a decent 
job was done in the T4 "Classic Synthesis".

The Point:

We agreed that combat wasn\'t fast-paced in RPGs, and he
showed me an AWESOME solution.  It\'s published by some 
small game company, and consists of 

	1) a body outline, subdivided into small regions
	   (maybe 20 regoins)

	2) transparent overlays for shots at each range band.

Shots and swings are called, and the overlay is placed over
the body centered at the called location.  Dice are then
rolled to determine hit location.  Numbers are scattered  
around the overlay at calculated distributions (the dice
used here are percentile), and the resulting number shows
where the shot landed, whether on target, off target but
still a hit, or missing the mark.  It\'s clear for all to see,
it combines hit probability, called shots, near misses and
"oops, you hit his head by accident" situations.  This is
a wonderful system I think, one that any RPG could benefit
by.  The sales clerk said combat is swift in this system.

I didn\'t want to buy a rules book just for a body outline and
range-probability overlays -- but the idea is brilliant.

Anyone else see this system before?

P.S. Could such a system be applied to starships as well?

Exactly so. This is much the same as the way I see it.

One thing people seem to skirt around is *how* the entry to jumpspace is
made. Sure, you need energy. I\'ve heard words like "tear" a hole in the
space-time fabric, "tunnel" an opening, "pinch" the ship off ... etc.
How does the ship accomplish this?

I think you need some sort of exotic energy/particle "field" created
around the ship, this field "pinches"/"tunnels"/"tears" the field\'s
contents out of normal space.

But without the hydrogen "access mass"/"atmosphere"/"bubble", the
contents of jumpspace, having higher "pressure", collapse upon the ship,
destroying it.

How is this *not* a simple explanation? How does it break canon?

I\'ve never believed that it\'s *mass* that\'s required. You need an
"atmosphere" of gas.

The fact that it is the _simplest_ and _most abundant_ gas bears
consideration. I don\'t think this fact is arbitrary. Would you rather
use Neon? 

Here\'s a simple answer: _Neutrons react violently with jumpspace_ Sure
it\'s arbitrary. But so is the *idea* of jumpspace. The fact is, it is a
*simple* explanation that explains a *lot* about the Jumpspace Bubble
explanation.

That is why pure Hydrogen-1 (Protium) is used. That is also why you need
a hydrogen bubble of sufficient pressure to protect the ship from
jumpspace incursion. It explains why vast quantities of hydrogen are
required during jumpspace entry. It also explains why the amount
required is dependent upon the *volume* (not mass) of the ship.

It also explains misjumps due to impurities. To many impurities
(Deutrium, Tritium, other gases etc.) and a chain reaction could happen
at the jumpspace interface, working its way to the ship...

Occam\'s razor in action! One simple statement explains a lot.

Still, how do you get the energy into the sink fast enough, so that the
equipment doesn\'t melt down?

The problem I have with "incredibly vast amounts of energy are needed"
is: exactly how is this energy channelled to jumpspace? Since
energy/matter are equivalent, isn\'t the visible Universe losing entropy?
Isn\'t this a Bad Thing?

This is why postulating that a "moderate" amount of energy used to
create a highly exotic and difficult to create energy/particle field
around the ship -- and this field allows entry into jumpspace -- makes
more sense to me.

Yes.  It\'s probably from _Millenium\'s End_ by Chameleon Eclectic (I
collect systems).  Its not a bad system, but it has some problems.  If
you miss your roll by (for ex) 15, you may still hit, but if you miss by
5, you may miss.  Part of this is offset by the firer choosing how to
turn the template.

A slightly better (IMHO) and quicker system is used in _The Babylon
Project_ (also by CE).  There is a hex overlay on the body outline.
Choose a hex on the body.  The hex you actually hit is determined by how
you rolled.  You may miss the hex you want to hit and hit another, but
that hex may still be a body hit.  (ie - you arm for chest, miss, but
his the leg.).  More details later, if you want.  I don\'t have my books
at work. :(

The only real problem about these things are the need for outlines for
each type of creature (or vehicle - GW had a similar system for
vehicles) and, maybe, for different poses or angles.  Not a bad idea,
but I never really liked them, being more conformable with a hit
location table (like in T2K).

Resources and Infrastructure: 

System Contents
For tech level 8 or less do not add planetoid belts and gas giants to the
resources score.  At tech level 9,  add only half the planetoid and gas
giant numbers (round up). Only add the full numbers at tech level A+.

Star Type
The star type modifier is added to the resources roll. This represents the
overall value of the system. Smaller stars would capture chunks of rock
rather than metal, new stars do not have any resources yet (still forming). 
Certain charcateristics of the world itself may increase the odds that
useful, accesible resources are available.

This is ex post facto. A larger population would need more resources to
survive, so if there is a large pop[ulation, it indicates that there are
some resources at the very least. Infrastrreucture must be better at higher

POCKET EMPIRES, Reality Check

For calculation of the GWP use the following reality rules formulae. Always
round down.


Effective Rating	
Infrastructure, Law Level	- 1/3	plurality  - 1/5 Law Level
Culture	+1/3 plurality	+1/5 Law Level

If this results in an effective rating of zero or lower, then treat it as a
one with a further penalty of 5% to the total economy per number below one.

These numbers are for GWP calculation only. Upkeep and maintenance is as per
the regular rules.

Demand:
Base=Population+DMs for infrastructure and culture. The roll for current
demand will be a 2D6 roll with the following modifiers. 

(Infrastructure/2)-3 (down)
(Culture/3)-2 (down)

2D6		Demand 
Roll		Modifier
2		- 3
3		- 2
4-5		- 1
6-8		+0
9-10		+1
11		+2
12		+3

The demand modifier will never be greater than the original demand. Change
any rolls that exceeed the base demand to equal the demand . Thus a demand
of 2 will never have a modifier of 3, it would be treated as a 2.

Atm.												TL
0																		8
1-3															7
4,7,9,D,E,F	5

A																		9
B																		B

Figuring the GWP:
(P x T x I x ND)  100

P: Population
T: Technological level
I: Infrastructure
ND: Net Demand: If demand exceeds resources, then use resources minus the
demand in excess of resources multiplied by the starport multiplier. If
resources exceed demand then use resources minus the demand in excess of
resources multiplied by the starport multiplier.  In both cases, multiply
the excess number by the Resource Shortage/Surplus modifier

I think it kind of depends on the location of the target world. If it is a
neighbor, say Barnard from Terral or Alpha Centauri, they probably would.
Think about the shock of giving up a millenium and finding out that the best
real estate on the world you were ready to colonize was already taken!

On the other hand. a world with newly developed Jump technology might still
use STL to colonize. Jump-1 technology requires the construction or
re-fueling stations or extra fuel to reach beyond that limit. Example Terra
in the First Contact era, needed to build a re-fueling site to reach
Barnard.

It might be more practical, concidering cargo space conciderations on those
early ships, to launch an STL ship, although I think a millenia is rather a
bit too long to travel to a nearer star, years naturally, decades probably.
Any way, the STL ships are used to establish the colonies at distance that
are impractical for the Jump ships. But by the time the colony is
established a re-fueling point or points can be built and trade developes.

I\'d need to sit down and look at some of the numbers for STL travel times to
the nearer stars, and distances, but I think that this may be the way Terra
actually expanded before the First Interstellar War. Especially when the
distance of the none Terran Confederation colonies are taken into account,
colonies in Reaver\'s Deep and Dark Nebula Sectors, as well as out toward the
Rim. These seem like a bigger "leap" than can be accounted for by normal
Jump progression, even with Jump 2 or 3, when you concider the usable
planets in between that weren\'t colonized.

    'body' => 'Just a friendly reminder, most of the people on this list are digest
subscribers and when you reply to a message try to avoid quoting the entire
message or even a subsequent part.  Only include what is absolutely
required or summarize.  Here are the reasons why this is important:

TML is a busy list.  People can read the messages faster, and generally can
follow threads without having to re-read the entire message.  The only time
when this fails is when people sign on in the middle of the list.  However
they can go to the ftp site and get the previous digests to catch up.

Secondly, when people read their digests, there is a good chance that they
have just read the original message that is being quoted anyway, so it
isn\'t necessary.

Thirdly, it increases the size of the messages which slows down our mail
server and can create log jams that cause you to not get your TML in a
timely fashion.   Kinda follow this a bit.  The excess traffic causes
accounts to go over quota and then we get bounces which slows down our mail
server even more.

There are certain rules of Netiquette that should be followed on mailing
lists, at least until mailing list and email software catches up in
technology.

1.   Make sure you contribute more than you quote.  If you quote 5 lines of
text, your contribution to the thread should be at least that much if not
more text.

2.   Your contribution should be meaningful.  Avoid "Me Toos", "I agree"s,
and "You go, Girl!"s.  Humor while entertaining, can be wasteful as well.
So hold back on the sarcastic and humorous comments unless it really adds
to the thread.

3.  Keep your signatures short.  4 lines or less is recommended.  Make sure
your original content is more than your signature.  This means avoid
sending PGP keys unless you can get that signature down to 4 or 5 lines.
Your PGP key can be a simple one liner:

       For my PGP public key:  http://www.somesite.com/~me/mypgp.html

Mailing list traffic is clear channel anyway, so no need to clog up the
airways with all that encrypted stuff.

4.  Avoid attachments and styles.  Attachments get imbedded into the
digests and are annoying as heck.  This means turn off automatically
sending Vcards in IE and Netscape.  Do not send attachments.  If you are
using Eudora 4.0, IE or Netscape, do not send "Styles" to mailing lists.
What happens is that your message becomes MIME encoded with multiple copies
of the message, one plain text and one rich text, and possibly HTML.  Each
copy gets stuck into the digest and can mess up peoples ability to read
digests.

5.  If a thread\'s subject no longer matches the thread, change the subject.

6.  Try to avoid restarting topics that end up in long debates.  So no
Asteroids as Missiles type threads.

Thank you for your attention.

A recipe for The Ultimate Weapon of Mass Destruction

choose a hull (size and configure to the taste of the destroyer)
add a small computer (specialized for cybernetic application)
add minimal sensors
add impulse engines (if not launched by external apparatus)
add a 2 Td jump drive and 30% LHyd*
use all remaining space for armor

Once completed aim the UWOMD at a planet you don\'t like.  Program the
computer to activate the jump drive just before arrival w/o opening a jump
portal.  Make sure that you are sufficiently removed from the scene of
destruction, because it will be massive.

*I chose 30% because we know that a second jump can be initiated almost
immediately after the first.  A second would be risky and a third might not
be impossible, so we might be able to use as much as 30% before the engine
was destroyed.

This is the best argument I can think of for why jump drives are not high
speed, short duration power plants.

How about using ICQ http://www.mirabilis.com with MS Netmeeting.  Share
the die rolling applications and you would both see it in action.  You
could also use the "white board" to draw or describe actions.

     I used to hate this for TNE/Twilight 2k also....but I have found what I
believe to have been on omission in the combat rules.  In T:2000 (1st ed) the
damage done by a weapon was 4*the dam rating of the weapon + 4d6 (at close
range)  At medium range it was 3*Dam +3d6, and so on down the line.  This gave
an M-16 (Dam rating of 2) the abilitiy to cause 8+4d6 at close range (12-40
pts, avg 22) PER SHOT, while an average character had only 30 pts to absorb
damage with (in the chest).  I believe this system was intended for T:2k (2nd)
as well as TNE, but was accidently left out (The combat rules for TNE are
almost word-for-word the rules in T:2k (2nd) ).  If nothing else, it certainly
works as an optional rule for those still using TNE...and maybe someone who
worked on the game can confirm my hypothesis??

I believe the answer to that was given by Glenn,  "...[hydrogen] is the
simplest, most abundant element in the universe."  It\'s simplicity would
surely be attractive in calculating it\'s characteristics as a normal space
matterial in the jump bubble.  It\'s abundance will obiously make it less

Ah, there\'s the rub.  I don\'t know about the author, but when I read this,

Because it\'s _one_ of the more benign consequences of a mis-jump. (1D6*6
parsecs in any direction) The problem with studying it is that it is
completely uncontrollable, and most misjumps result in the jump drive
going off into jumpspace and never coming back, or exploding.

Some handwaving theorists have said that it\'s likely that the jump drive
precipitates out into normal space in some form or another, most likely as
dissociated atoms somewhere along a 36 parsec path (again derived from the
1D6*6 rule).

kinda hard to study something when most of the time your experiment simply
destroys itself.

I have a question for all those involved with this tread -- there was an
adventure way back in CT, ( I think it was in a Journal article), entitled
Annic Nova. That ship used "solar collectors" to power its jump engines.
Once you charged up, you could jump. No Liquid Hydrogen was needed. I think
it used a solar sail to travel in system. Doesn\'t this technology negate 
arguments like the one above which hand-wave the need for hydrogen as a 
material component for jump, or is it just accepted that CT canon has been 
changed/evolved on this issue?

No lie buana,  I was trained in the late 70\'s and early 80\'s (including some
pretty impressive historical background) and active (including teaching
others) for much of the 80\'s with the cutting edge technology.  Then I
dropped out during most of the 90\'s.  In December I had finally saved up
enough money to get a new computer, so I could get back into the field.  I
am constantly amazed at the changes that have occurred during just the 7 or
8 years I was not paying close attention.

Even back in the 70\'s I was opposed to including specific details on how
computers work in Traveller.  One of the things I like about T4 is that they
don\'t try to explain how, only what.

When I bought my new machine, I wanted a large hard drive.  I told the
salesman that I wanted at least a couple of hundred meg.  He looked at me
kinda funny and asked if I were sure.  Having given that look, I told him no
and would he not be so polite in the future and just correct my
misconceptions.  I have a 3.8 Gig HD and can see how that is not going to be
too big.  (I\'ve had the machine for less than 2 months and it is already
over half used.)

I just found out I can compress the disk, so I\'m not really worried.

You are right about the use of solar collecters.  Travel in system was 
by means of push from a boat giving .1g.  We used this derelict for some 
time before we could afford something a little more predictable. IIRC, 
you had to roll a number of dice (?d) to determine the number of days or 
weeks required to collect enough energy....

I don\'t remember, but where did it store the energy?  Was it alien 
technology?

When explained that way, I can see a point to it.  However, the explanation
of the trade process doesn\'t say anything about auctions or a reserve price.
I will consider implementing the special rule under an auction situation.
However, IMO, to be able to do that, the process should not take a week.  A
couple of days should suffice if there is a regular auction for speculative
goods.

Presuming that the enemy *happens* to be where the tender bursts out of

We agreed that combat wasn\'t fast-paced in RPGs, and he
showed me an AWESOME solution.  It\'s published by some 
small game company, and consists of 

	1) a body outline, subdivided into small regions
	   (maybe 20 regoins)

	2) transparent overlays for shots at each range band.

Shots and swings are called, and the overlay is placed over
the body centered at the called location.  Dice are then
rolled to determine hit location.  Numbers are scattered  
around the overlay at calculated distributions (the dice
used here are percentile), and the resulting number shows
where the shot landed, whether on target, off target but
still a hit, or missing the mark.  It\'s clear for all to see,
it combines hit probability, called shots, near misses and
"oops, you hit his head by accident" situations.  This is
a wonderful system I think, one that any RPG could benefit
by.  The sales clerk said combat is swift in this system.

I didn\'t want to buy a rules book just for a body outline and
range-probability overlays -- but the idea is brilliant.

Anyone else see this system before?

Rob

P.S. Could such a system be applied to starships as well?

On getting Jump-36 out of a Jump-1 drive:

In Classic Traveller, a misjump would send your ship 1d6 d6\'s in a =
random direction - it didn\'t matter if you had a Jump-1 drive or Jump-6 =
drive, or if you used Jump-1 or Jump-6 out of your drive. You could go =
anywhere from one parsec to 36 parsecs (six on the first die, 6\'s on the =
six dice this makes you roll - a 1 in 279,936 chance, but it could =
happen. Fuel usage occurred at the start of the jump, before misjump was =
rolled, so your fuel usage was as if no misjump had occurred.

Still, there is no substitute for actually going out there and looking.
That is what the IISS is for.  There is a very nice outline for a system
survey given in DGP\'s World Builders Handbook.

Stellar mapping (which is, I assume, mapping star positions in jumpspace
as well as normal space); system mapping; planetary geological assaying;
first contact procedures; biological surveys; journeys founded by
universities.

Except, you would also want secondary ships to explore many bodies in a
system at once, to increase the resolution of your sensors, and help
refuel; a large crew to be able to leave long-term survey teams on
planets; large storage spaces for lots-o-food and spare parts; cargo
space/low berths for storing samples being returned; at lease one of
each type of sensor available (and multiple copies of each for
redundancy); large amount of rec space for the crew (long months in
space can make you space-happy); extra fuel tankage; etc.  All in all, a
different philosophy from designing a warship.  Science ships will
seemingly be expensive, very space inefficient, and not well armed.

I am also interested.  Stay tuned for the incredible exploits of the
crew of the HMS Eddie Bauer.  The Bauer is a Magellan-class long-range
Scout ship.  She will be around 22000 dtons, with a fairly large crew
(back of the envelope calculations, details to come).  The PC\'s will be
the command staff.  The total journey is expected to last at least three
years.

The Bauer Files will be available on a soon-to-be created website,
starting with an overview of the Bauer, created with Mr. Akins\'
excellent FFS2 spreadsheet, followed by deck plans and write-ups of its
mission.

Where is this theory? I\'ve heard of no serious scientific theory of
hyperspace. Alternate universes, perhaps...

Because you\'re using a different dimension of jumpspace.

Think of it this way: Each layer of jumpspace is a "river". The speed of
Jumpspace Layer 1 is 1 parsec/week, the speed of J-2 is 2 parsecs/week,
the speed of J-6 is 6 parsecs/week, etc.

The Jump Drive doesn\'t actually propel the ship, it just provides the
energy to lift the ship off the bank of "normal space" and put it into
the waters of "jumpspace". The jumpspace medium propels the ship!

The drive rating is a measure of what "rivers" the jump drive can
access. Each Jumpspace dimension requires higher energy levels to enter,
and some are only accessible by uncontrollable misjumps.

<snip of erroneous analogy of jump-drives to speed of vehicles>
> This to me is illogical & the only place in which Traveller falls down.

It\'s not illogical at all, as long as you use a logical frame of
reference.

I say again, the Jump number is *not* a measure of the "speed" of the
jump drive. That may be the way \'warp drive\' works, but the jump-drive
is what makes Traveller unique.

Actually, no. I bought it when it came out, thought "This is brilliant!",

Killing someone with one shot isn\'t that likely. Hitting somebody once, 
and then they die *from loss of blood* sounds much more realistic (see my 
earlier post). Also note that average damage from a 2d weapon will knock 
out an average person, which is as good as dead.

I tried exactly the same thing years ago, but gave up for the same reason.

Didn\'t you use the quick kill rule?  That solves that quite nicely.  If you
use it to mean, as i do, that for every POINT of damage, that # or less rolled
on a d20 means instant death for head and torso shots.  In addition to the
home brew rule (that\'s quite popular) for using d10 rather than d6 for damage.
That means if u have 6D weapon theres a 6 in 20 chance that they\'re dead.  I
use it to mean i roll 17 total on those 6 dice (d10 or d6) that person is only
saved on a 18 through 20.  Those aren\'t nice odds of survival.

Of course, that would work, too, but the quick kill rule is simpler, i think.

It depends if you get rid of all the pets it has first.

More importantly, would the Vegetarian Society approve Hresh as a dish?

Thinking again, if the Hresh ever want to start a jihad against the K\'Kree
does anyone want to help?

Essentially, the logic is as follows:

1) if it can happen accidentally - it implies that it can happen again -
deliberately.

2) a lot of man\'s early achievements were the result of noticing something
that happens naturally, and trying to recreate the circumstances by which
it occurred

  Just as an example of what I am talking about.  If it is known that mass
affects the chances of a misjump, that would be a starting point in the
research and developement of the "misjump" theory.  If a misjump can, with
only 10% of the volume of a ship, along with a Jump1 engine set up -
produce a jump 36 result - how can it be done deliberately?  From there, I
would hazard a guess that scientists would use mathematical models (the
same models used to produce normal astrogation programs I would guess) as
well as robotic machines hooked to a jump drive.  Best place that I can
think of to work on this?  The rifts...  Out there, there would be a lot of
open space that one can work off of and not worry about what happens to the
ship itself (in case some really catestophic things happen!).

  In any case - misjumps contradict the "logic" of jumpspace in a major
way, and should be removed (IMHO).  However - this is NOT canon...

The Sayat have cobbled together a deviant, er, divergent jump drive
technology that works something like the Annic Nova, maybe.  It requires
the same large amounts of power in a burst, but much less hydrogen mass
for... well, for whatever it\'s for.  They\'ve got great big capacitors to be
charged up with fast & inefficient fusion reactors (built as part of the
jump drive), plus solar panels, batteries, fuel cells, etc.

They don\'t use a hull grid of lanthanum, either, but have a small, massive
_Thing_ that sits in the very center of the ship and generates a jump
envelope of a given radius.  They don\'t like to talk to outsiders about how
it works.  They also sacrifice small animals to it on a regular basis, to
prevent misjump.  Many strange taboos around the whole subject.

The technology in question seems to be derived from a combination of
sources: unearthed 2500 year old Hiver starships, peculiar devices
recovered from a small group of Ancient cyberpunks who spent the last
300,000 years stuck on a comet hopped up on immuno-suppressants, and
decades of research by friendly math-genius lampreys.

Of course, it hardly needs saying that they\'re all totally non-underwear.

I don\'t agree.  While there is some danger of ships exploding, there 
doesn\'t seem to be a great danger to others "in the area".  I think this 
is an extrapolation of the "big sky little bullet" theory....  I would 
have the experiments done in a rather poplulous place, other wise you 
are looking in the rifts (lots of dead space) for a single starship 
which precipitated out of jumpspace at some unknown location.  I would 
think that you would want it to come out of jump space near a system so 
that you could get a beacon on it and go see what happened.

If it ends up in an empty hex, how would you find it again?

There is one, small problem.  That Jump36 that you get from a misjump is
uncontrolled.  The destination is in a random direction, so you have no
idea where you will come out.  It has been stated (I believe that it is
canon) that there can not be a *controlled* jump greater than 6.  So,
yes, you *could* deliberately create a misjump using your J1 drives to
throw you 36pc, but you would not be able to determine where you came
out.  With this, there is no contradictions to jump theory.

   I\'m not sure what time pressues Marc has imposed on himself with regard
to "T4.1" but I think that it would make a worthy addition to the basic manual.

   I have already redone the Solomani Rim, and have volunteered to do more.
Others have already fixed the Spinward Marches, Deneb and other adjacent
sectors.

   Problem I can see with this is that *every* world that doesn\'t have a
breathable atmosphere (particularly worlds with atmosphere A+) will have
some kind of bio-domes.

We agreed that combat wasn\'t fast-paced in RPGs, and he
showed me an AWESOME solution.  It\'s published by some 
small game company, and consists of 

	1) a body outline, subdivided into small regions
	   (maybe 20 regoins)

	2) transparent overlays for shots at each range band.

Shots and swings are called, and the overlay is placed over
the body centered at the called location.  Dice are then
rolled to determine hit location.  Numbers are scattered  
around the overlay at calculated distributions (the dice
used here are percentile), and the resulting number shows
where the shot landed, whether on target, off target but
still a hit, or missing the mark.  It\'s clear for all to see,
it combines hit probability, called shots, near misses and
"oops, you hit his head by accident" situations.  This is
a wonderful system I think, one that any RPG could benefit
by.  The sales clerk said combat is swift in this system.

I didn\'t want to buy a rules book just for a body outline and
range-probability overlays -- but the idea is brilliant.

Anyone else see this system before?

Biohazard Games produced a supplement called "Killer Crosshairs" that used
a system much like ME\'s.

When we were playing ME, we found that photos from Newsweek and color
plates from the Osprey series made for excellent targets.

Do people have any strong views about how we might visualise the grids:

1) the jump grid is lots of narrow (1 mm dia) wires over the surface of the ship.  For this case, do these wires go "over" or "under" such fixtures as turrets, bays, sensor antennae, spinal mount openings, HEPLAR exhaust ports.  is there a maximum separation for the wires? Does this separation reduce with jump number?  If the wires go over other features, why bother to assign a surface area to them in FFS2?

2) the jump grid is mostly contained in a few area (say, near the fore and aft of the vessel, plus near the tips of wings, tailplanes) with half-a-dozen grid lines joining the key nodes?

Following the SOM, I used to handwave things as (1), saying that turrets had to be in the correct position for jump (so their grids matched the rest of the ship), antennae had to be retracted and thin doors closed over spinal mounts, M-drive ports and so on.  I always liked the idea of last-minute EVA to unjam the turret, or to re-lay a section of damaged grid with a lanthanum welding rod as the ship flees combat.

Now that FFS2 assigns a specifc surface area to the grids, and this reduces the
area available for turrets, airlockes and so on, I decided I needed a new
handwave.  One option is to keep my original hand wave and add in the "node
areas" of (2) and claim that these are what FFS2 is refering to.

What does the team think?

A major problem I see with researching the 36 parsec misjump:

Considering how much interstellar space there is in a 36 parsec radius, =

unimpressed with things like time, you could set your test ships to =
broadcast their positions if they ever get back to normal space - that =
would mean you would wait several years (or decades) for the data from =
each run of the experiment.

Races with that kind of view of time won\'t worry about making speedy 36 =
parsec jumps, they\'ll just jump-1 36 times.  ;)

   I am not the author of the "T4" overhaul of the star system generation
sequence, but I consulted (along with several others) by the authors of the
project.

   If it were submitted to Traveller Chronicle for publication, it would get
published if I had to run the printing press myself.  Unfortunately (for TTC
at least), it is now in IG\'s hands, having already been submitted for
publication there.  It would be up to the authors to make a change should
they wish to do so.

   We are once again in total agreement.

   BTW, in Scouts, Earth is used as an example of how to calculate a world\'s
temperature.  The resulting number, 15 degrees C is 2.5 degrees C above what
the number actually is.  No wonder DGP thought the polar ice caps were
melting...

How big would such field be? I don\'t have the chemistry or physics formulas handy, but isn\'t a Jump-5 vessel dumping half it\'s volume in compressed hydrogen, then energizing it? And of course, the more energy you add to a gas cloud, the farther apart the atoms get, the more the volume increases...

Here\'s where I\'m going with this: in Traveller as I\'ve played it, the heroes are running for the 100 diameter (or even 10 diameter!) limit, bad guys in hot pursuit, the heroes pop the clutch, squeal the hydrogen and throw their ship from the middle of the battle into the safety of jump space.

Same scene with jump drives making a hydrogen-based field around the ship:
Heroes activate the jump drives, the field starts forming...and any laser,
particle beam or HEPlaR exhaust particle touching the field (not the ship,
mind you - the _field_) disrupts it. Again, we\'d have to do the math to
determine what kind of volume the field would have, but I think it would be
pretty big. Now they don\'t have to hit you to stop you - every near-miss makes
your astrogation program throw a fit.

I imagine a poor man\'s jump suppresor, a low-power plasma beam that washes over
the ship - not hot enough to scorch the paint, but enough to over-excite that
hydrogen you\'re dumping. Something for the revenue cutters that are tired of
smugglers jumping away right before the inspectors board?

The right kind of disruption might even detonate the field. Hard on the ship,
worse on your fuel supplies.

It sounds to me like explaining jump drives with the real-space particle field
effect would make jumping out of space combat impossible, or at least very
dangerous. When they worked with lanthanum grids in your hull, you could armor
your field - it\'s a little harder to armor a surrounding gas cloud.

I believe most people are ruling that canon has evolved, given the very
early release of Annic Nova, and the later release of High Guard.

  Send out a fleet of robotic ships at a minimum of 100 displacement tons
with "shoddy" jump drives (ie cheap - not expected to work more than a few
times...)

  Use continous broadcast radio...

1) make sure you keep track of the variables you had control over...

2) keep various recording devices working at all times during the initial
jump sequence.

3) keep various recording devices around the exit point at all times...

  Then...

  at select points - place radio recievers...

  Thennnnnnnn

  go visit those recievers.

Thoughts:
 1) the map of Traveller is two dimensional not three.  
 
2) if you use the idea of placing radio recievers in the 6 radial
  directions, you would only need 216 of them - one for each hex in each
  direction.  Six scouts, each taking 72 weeks can collect the data from
  each collection point and bring it back to the central collections
  point.

3) radio travels at a speed of one parsec every 3.26 years, so any one
radio station would only need 1.63 years to recieve the radio broadcast
assuming that you plant the station exactly in the center of the "hex".

4) despite the problem of a roughly 2 year time lag getting the data
initially, one could launch a "ship" every two weeks, every week, or even
every day if one has access to that kind of resources.  The data would be
limited only to the collection times required.

5) also, it would not be hard to use a secondary collection point at the
midway mark of each "arm" such that data is taken there, and from there,
back to the central collections point.

  In all, a systematic approach to "why" things happen would go a long way
towards discovering the principles of getting a jump36 machine.

  As one person did mention earlier, the "energy" required is paid up
before the jump, so some of the recent "theories" of how and why jumps 1
through 6 work would preclude the ability to jump 36 parsecs on only 10%
hull displacement seemingly are voided by that observation.

  Personally?  Since Traveller is noted as being the *best* sci-fi game
system that structures it\'s technology and technology descriptions - don\'t
you all think it is time to structure the Jump Drive theory as well?

  I think it is time, that Traveller looks at the facts of what it has
made "gospel" and ties it in with what is known today.  T4 has already
done this once with respect towards computers (take a look at the CT
computer volumes versus T4\'s computer volumes and you will see what I
mean).  If this is done, take as many "facts" from CT and list them.  Find
the facts that contradict each other and either resolve them or eliminate
the most troublesome datum.  From there, make an explanation that fits all
facts as best as possible without violating any other "facts".  Once that
is done, and "canonized", future writers won\'t make novel changes to the
system in addenda or suppliment form.  In short, this is what most
builders would call "laying in the foundation".

  The alternative to this is to permit "chaos" to flower where it need
not.  Those who want their versions of Traveller to remain unchanged?  You
already have the books for the version you want to play.  I am talking
about the survability of T4.1 folks.  T4.1, with all the work that Marc
will/is putting into it, deserves to last as a lasting tribute to his
original concept: a space science fiction roleplaying game to bring
enjoyment to those who purchase it.  It deserves to have an internal self
consistancy such that 10 years from now, people are going to play T4.1
instead of GURPS SPACE or some other game system that delivers what T4.1
won\'t.

  Well enough on this, since it\'s really two threads in one...

    'body' => 'Hello Folks,
  I started on one topic earlier on another thread, and realized that what
I ended with was really a different "thread".  Consequently, I thought it
would be best to condense my thoughts on the matter into this post...

  First off, let me make a "comment" for Marc Miller...

  It is my belief, that Traveller started Science Fiction roleplaying much
like D&D started fantasy roleplaying.  As such, a lot of thanks goes out
to you for having started this.  Furthermore, your attempts to predict the
future technology were good ones.  Couple this with the relatively good
roleplaying mechanisms you used in the original, and the ease of play this
engendered means that CT is worth remembering as a good roleplaying
system.
  However, as more and more people came to enjoy it, more and more people
spotted errors in it, or discovered that it needed more to be added to it
than what was there.  It is ludicrous to expect that you (Marc Miller)
should be an expert surgeon/doctor, Engineer, Astophysicist, Military
General, etc...  What has happened however, is that others have been able
to bring their understanding and education to the process.

  If I may be so bold as to ask/point out to the list...

  Instead of telling Marc "build the best error free T4.1) you can, so we
can rip it up showing where the errors are, why don\'t we all work together
on submitting things to him specifically with the express intent of
helping him?

  Instead of saying "this is wrong - fix it", why don\'t we all actually
take the current rule that we thing is wrong, or the proceedure that we
think is wrong, and submit something that fixes it?

  #1 rule to abide by though: this *HAS* to be a labor of love, no
monetary rewards expected...

  #2 rule to abide by: all judgment must be left in Marc\'s hands.  If we
disagree with something, but he disagrees with our disagreement, then take
it for what it\'s worth...

  #3 Although it would be nice to see our names in print - we should be
content with the fact that something was fixed, and enjoy the *self
satisfaction* that goes with that thought.  Thus, no listing of credits
for who did what or who was involved unless Marc feels it necessary.
However, to be fair, those people who submit concepts are also playing a
vital role in the creation process by virtue of showing Marc what he
doesn\'t want and/or why.

  Now, why am I mentioning this?  Number one: despite my love for
Traveller when it first came out during my college days back in 1978, I
have moved on away from it.  The reason I moved away from it is because it
had certain deficiencies in it that made other games more attractive.

  I think that if T4.1 was made as "tight" as possible, that future games
will not be able to Lure players away from Traveller.  This would ensure
that it is not a niche game for a few people, but a Game that will endure
for a long long time to come.

  In a way, T4 has already made steps in the direction I think Traveller
can go with the addition of FF&S (either edition) for the simple reason
that FF&S allows the players to create the technology base they want to
use either as canon or as non-canon approaches.

  What I\'d like to see happen, is that Traveller builds a solid
foundation, and builds from that.  Thus, the Jumpdrive theories that have
been sprouted before?  Have a single theory that maximizes everything with
the least hassle of contradictions.

  Ok, having said that, I think it remains up to Marc Miller to either
second my thoughts and let people know he would like the added help, or
shoot it down as the meddling that it is (ie unasked for comments <Grin>)
that violates the direction that he wants to go.

  In one respect, I liken Marc\'s job, should he like my proposals, to that
of an editor with "THE ONE TRUE GUIDING LIGHT" in his eyes.  Those who
submit help would be an anthology collection group of authors.  Thus, Marc
has the final say, and the final task of writing the whole thing, but in
the mean time, he doesn\'t have to sweat out the details of things that he
isn\'t expert at...

  Well, soapbox mode off...

Yes.  There was a book called "The Caves of Steel" written by Asimov that
deals with this whole thing.  Basicly, yes they would have training, but a
goodly amount goes insane because of the shock of being on a new world. 
IMHO, great read.

Actually the largest size colony discussed was 1,000,000 people but that is
neither here nor there.

Governments today run on propaganda & who is to say that the governments in
the future will not do the same.

This is a point in your favor, but what about involentary colonization with
that form of colonization.  I.e. we find a great colony world & about half
the people train to live there & the other half are from the prisions?

How about a \'skin\' only a couple of molecules thick, that you rub into the skin.
Could be temporary, higher TLs, longer duration and more complete protection.  NO
getting into or getting out of.

WRT UV radiation, ought to have an SPF 1k that you apply to skin once for life,
or per year or some such.  Circa TL 10 maybe?

That doesn\'t sound like any Priest I\'ve ever talked to.  Not even any of

Yeah, it would have stunned me, too.  It\'s just a shame you weren\'t able to
correct the mother and child\'s perception.  You probably *couldn\'t* have, I
know, but it\'s still a shame to leave a child with such a perception.

You\'ve got that right, however bigotry will probably be with us always.


Ob Traveller, I hope you don\'t object to the term "heretic" being used in

Well, if Jump/hyperspace is part of our universe then the mass isn\'t lost
just reallocated. ;->  However, I do agree that most of the "injection

In my view, when a ship exits jump it is with a blinding flash of photons,
a large gravitic disturbance, and a rapidly expanding cloud of highly
energized ions.  So, I\'d refine your narrative slightly for one of my
games...

"Sir, I\'ve got a spike on the gravitometer..on our *inside* leg!"

"From the fade it looks like bearing 233 mark 15.  That\'s right at Timber
3.  It\'s about....um 9 megaclicks from us, 14 from Timber 3."

"If we were another half hour out, we\'d have missed that spike, Sir."

About 30 seconds later...

"Sir, I\'ve got the Jump Flash on IR, mark, mark, mark. Judging by the
energy frequency and dispersion rate it\'s from a 40kton ship on a J2
bounce."

"Damn!  Bring us around and radio Command.  If it\'s a Zeristu Crusier it
can do about 18 ls, so it\'s still almost three hours out.  If we go to full
military power can we intercept it before it reaches Timber 3?"

"Checking, Sir."

"Yes, Sir, but just barely, and only if we commit right now."

"How soon will we have the bogie on sensor plot, if it *is* making for
Timber 3?"

"Twenty minutes, Sir, but if we go to FMP they\'ll pick us up about the same
time."

"And if we don\'t go to FMP, Commander, the Zerk will beat us to Timber 3 by
a half hour and get a free shot on our base.  We\'re the only ship that can
beat her there."

"Full Military Power!  Start buttoning up for combat."

"Sparks, have you got Timber 3 on the comm yet?"

Alas, it cannot be so in the universe of Traveller.  CT & T4 both state
categorically that no ship under 100Td can survive the transit.

They didn\'t say why, but they did say so.

Again, we\'re straying far from the original concept, which was for a
sub-light large scale colonization effort. No government is going to put
that kind of effort into transplanting prisoners. Far cheaper and simpler
to just execute them or stick them into big orbital habs.

Penal colonies only work if you have cheap transport, and a known
destination. Wooden ships in the 1700-1800\'s were cheap, and, (foex)
Australia was known to be able to support people (ie they could breath,
eat the local lifeforms, etc) 

In your case, I suspect that what happened in Australia would be a good
model. The \'trained\' ones (ie: non-convicts) would rule the roost and get
the good land, and the convicts either dumped somewhere inhospitable to
scratch or die, or live as slaves.

Probably, but (you knew that but was coming didn\'t you), you would need a

Unfortunately, you will have to sue to get the rights back.  Until you have

If you are using a Bussard ram jet the travel times are easy, figure the

In defense of those who ask "Why barbers?":

Such a statement while (hopefully) not condoned would at least be understood
concerning Jews.  It has been going on for years.  Before beginning the
discussion of why it should not be done, I would want to know why barbers.
Racism is a dangerous practice and should not be allowed.  But human nature
is what it is, we are curious about the unknown.

Disclaimer:  The above defense of those who ask "Why barbers?", in no way
indicates a tendency on my part to be anti-Semitic.  If the quote had been
all barbers and [insert the name of your least favorite race, nationality,
religion or fraternal organization here].  I would still want to know "Why
barbers?"

    'body' => 'An update on my software proposal:

 It has received tentative approval from the CS department -- as soon as I
produce a written specification, I\'ll be given full go-ahead on making the
software for credit (otherwise, I would have done it "just for fun").

 The features I will implement:
 * DOS-based -- I am using the DJGPP C++ compiler.  The software will be
DOS native.  The software is Win95 compatible -- my machine at home and one
of the two machines I have set up at work on campus are Win95 (the other is
Win3.11) and I have _no_ problems running the software from a DOS window on
any of the machines.  I can include .PIF files if needed.  Since I am using
DJGPP, the software is 32 bit protected mode -- I don\'t know if other
platforms/OS\'s have issues with implementing the DPMI.  I have run software
compiled in this fashion on Win NT4.0, but I haven\'t had a Power Mac or
Amiga or anything else to try it out on.
 * [G|T]UI -- There will be a command-line interface (even if I am the only
person to use it) for system generation.  I will also hammer out a
graphical user interface by the time the final round of changes is done
(one step at a time).  In the interim, I will work from a simpler
menu-based interface up to a text-mode UI before tackling the final GUI.
If I can complete the components soon enough, I may be willing to port it
to a Windows environment, but that is the lowest-priority task for the
project and not a requirement presently.
 * Hi-color graphics -- I am currently targetting a screen resolution of
640x480, using 16 bit color.  I will include support for 256 color mode,
also, since one of my development platforms can\'t support higher color depths.
 * Ability to read formatted text sector data -- I haven\'t decided how to
choose stars yet (whether or not to use the canon system generation
sources), but I will include the ability to detail sectors automatically
with this software.
 * System "editing" -- SysGen will allow the user to modify a star system
once generated.  The user will be able to move planets, tweak the UWP
ratings, or add/remove planets.  The same editing features will apply, of
course, to the natural satellites.
 * Various system displays -- a) an overview of the system, showing the
primary star and the ellipses of the planetary orbits; b) overview of the
individual worlds, with ellipses of the world\'s natural satellites; c)
displays of the system (as in \'a)\') with moving points representing the
planets; d) displays of the planets with moving points representing
satellites; e) a scaled view of the star system showing the relative sizes
of the planets (& satellites).
 * System UWP info -- for each of the planets and satellites, with options
either to write data to a text file or display it on screen.
 * System generation from several differing starting points -- So that you
can say, "Give me a solar system orbiting a G2V," and <poof>, there it is.
Or, you can say, "Give me a solar system orbiting a G2V with a main world
UWP of C854653-B", and, in a moment, it is there.  Or, you can specifiy
only the UWP & let the software choose a star; or, you can specify the UWP,
and the number of gas giants & planetoid belts; et cetera.

Features that I may implement:
 * Data exchange ability with Metator -- once I have specifications for
what Metator stores and how, I will see if the data I am generating can
work with the Metator data format.
 * Ability to handle multiple-star systems -- the system generation
software I am adapting has no support for binaries/trinaries/n-aries.  When
I get further into my research, I may find a model that allows for multiple
stars.

 What I have right now:
 I\'ve completed a basic test program that simply builds a solar system
around a G2V.  The readable-text details of the system are on the order of
80Kb.  The stored binary data is about 1/4 that size.
 I\'ve also put together a quick-and-dirty graphical display that allows me
to display the system on screen (as a set of concentric ellipses) or to
view planetary motion (as points moving along the concentric ellipses),
zoom in and zoom out on either display, and change the time scale.  The
major axes of the ellipses are co-linear (I\'ll have that changed this
weekend).

 What I have yet to implement:
 WBH/WTH details about resource availability, resource richness, biological
compatibility, etc.
 Trade Codes.
 Traveller population-related information (allegiance, etc.).
 World/system names.

 System Requirements (expected):
 The DPMI will set the minimum requirements for the software.  SysGen
currently requires the following: 80386 or better CPU, DOS 5.x or higher,
VGA monitor/video card (640x480 screen resolution, 256 or more colors).

 I am going to get my ISP account updated this month so that I have a web
page so that I can upload the software (and interim versions) when it is
ready.

 Any questions or comments, please feel free to direct them to me via
e-mail or the mailing list.

I don\'t see that as a problem, unless the stats for planetary
defense installations are more constrained than I realize.  So
you can build one with 3x more firepower if you have access to
the extra hydrogen....  Does that cause any problems?

Why does simple matter?  And pure hydrogen is not all that 
abundant in environments were star ports are.  

I don\'t want to get into "dueling theories" here.  I just
want to point out the broader issue here.  You have a theory
and you want to make sure that it just happens to require
hydrogen, so you focus on the properties of hydrogen and
come up with reason why it has be those.  IMO, this is
never going to work as well as theory that started with
a general principal and chose what makes most sense for
that principal.  It is always going to be apparent that
the theory was made to fit the how things work rather than
the other way around.

[various theories about why it has to be hydrogen deleted.]

> Occam\'s razor in action! One simple statement explains a lot.

Well, no.  Occam\'s razor would not have been to have to
invoke special problems with neutrons in the first place
(which still doesn\'t answer why you don\'t have a problem
with the ship itself, or with molecules it is sure
to outgas during the trip...)

> The problem I have with "incredibly vast amounts of energy are needed"
> is: exactly how is this energy channelled to jumpspace?

Again, this isn\'t necessary and is more than you are
requiring for jump bubbles.  Just as the initial supposition
is that somehow an atmosphere of gas protects you against
jump space, here the supposition is that somehow being
anchored in jump space means you can dump energy into
the lanthanum grid without melting it.

It doesn\'t matter if you put energy or matter into jump
space, the same situation holds.  Either it all comes
back out when you return, or the Universe is loosing
mass/energy.
 
[Of course canon is that you get a burst of energy when
you come out which fits with the old theory but is something
else you would have to come up with an explination for in
a jump bubble theory.]

Like the broader issue, it\'s not a question of "can\'t",
it a question of wjether, once you are done coming
up with reasaon why you need both jump bubble and
a Lanthanum grid, and why other constraint designed 
for the old theory have to apply, things aren\'t
noticably more arbitrary.

This is based on one interpretation of one sentence (which never
explicitly
said you need more fuel after the energy needs were met and even if it
did, it doesn\'t prove that you simply don\'t need to generate energy
after the jump starts and you can\'t get anymore from the black globe).  
As I said in a previous message, I think it is a long way from being 
established and that sentence conflicts with other comments which
are much more explicitly stated.

Which is also true of the hydrogen being used for maneuver drives,
weapons, etc.  (clearly energy related uses.)

Well, this is the sort of thing I don\'t like.  To fit the jump
bubble theory to a situation that was designed around another
theory, you start having to explain things away (like why it\'s
called fuel when it isn\'t fuel).  Sure this can be done, but
it leaves things that much harder to accept.  That is why I
prefer to stick with things closer to the original.  It is
always a better idea to limit decisions on things fundamentally
work to the beginning of the design of the background as
much as possbile, at least in my mind.

Two words:  "The Six Million Dollar Man!"  Can you say Bionic?  :-)
Just kidding with you.  Say you lose you arm is some horrible accident.  Wouldn\'t
you love to get a Str 20 replacement?

I recognize that lack of cyberware/bionics is a choice.  Probably lack of time and
interest.  But there things are getting closer and closer to reality.  As of this
very day, there are prosthetic arms that are touch, pressure, and temperature
sensitive.  There are devices just 500 yards across the river from me (which would
be MIT) that project text and images onto the retinas so that people with sever
vision problems can read.  (its also the first step to the cyberspace that Neal
Stephenson describes in SnowCrash (no \'jacking in,\' just using lasers to work on
your retina to give you full 3D peripheral picture.).

In the future, given the pressures of military combat, I just think that some
amount of tinkering is inevitable.  Imagine an Army artillery commander that uses
an artillery computer in his head.  Saves on shipment and can\'t be stolen.
Internal intertial compasses and maps for navigation?  Pilot-ship syncs that let a
pilot work without having to sit in a bridge in the center of the ship?  Internal
radio transceivers?  Medical self diagnosis readouts?  An aiming computer for
tracking targets?  And these are just ones I can think of with immediate military
implications.

I\'m not asking Marc to create another book.  However, I do think an outline of the
relative capabilities by TL would be appropriate.  I understand that some
society\'s will not use them, that doesn\'t mean they are unable.  And you can\'t put
the genie back in the bottle.

I guess the ultimate cyberware is a completely artificial body with only a brain.
Then we\'re getting close to immorality, maybe?  Assuming proper maintenance and a
cure for Alzheimers.

Yes, but the significance of the consideration will not be examined.  As long as
the consideration was not illusory or the contract unconscionable, it\'ll probably
stand (although some states are increasingly willing to look at the contract for
fairness).  If one party has significantly more bargaining power, they will look at
it more closely.

Failing to pay, in a reasonable time, is breach of the contract.The non-breaching
party can then sue for expectation damages (how much you expected to make),
reliance damages (how much you spent relying on the other part to fulfill the
contract - often called \'out-of-pocket\' expenses), and/or restitution damages (what
they took from you).

Of course, as Volker intimates, one parties performance is excused by the other\'s
breach.  They don\'t pay, you don\'t play.

Umm, the way you\'ve stated this, Volker, it sounds extreme, but the more I think
about it, the more eloquently you\'ve stated it.  There is no per se time limit for
contract suits.  Although, in most US states, failure to bring a claim within a
certain time period after the cause of the claim has arisen, will result in the
courts not allowing the action to proceed.  There are 2 common periods in the US: 3
years and 6 years, some states use 5, I don\'t know of any shorter than 3.  These
apply to all civil, i.e., non-criminal, claims.  This is the statute of
limitations.

Having said all that, guess what?  ITS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT (Sorry for the
caps).  Of course, as faithful users of all things traveller and veterans of the
QSDS, the SSDS, and FFS2, etc. you knew nothing is ever as easy at it seems.

We\'re dealing here with Copyrights.  And the law here gets messy.  At least its not
software which many judges are completely unable to understand, the young ones
maybe saw Pong, once, on TV.  They\'re used to Univac sized stuff and dont know a
meg from a gig, except that gigget had her own TV show (thats a joke).

Copyright law is Federal, which means state laws don\'t mean diddly-squat (not sure
how to translate for our non-Norte Americanos  - Diddly Squat is Jack Squat\'s
younger and smaller brother).

The literary works you\'ve created may be "works for hire," which is a fancy way of
saying you were never the "author" for legal purposes.  However, since most of you
all don\'t actually work at or for IG, you probably wouldn\'t have to worry about
this.

I can talk about what my understanding of the law is.

I am curious, though, and I do know lots of lawyers.  Some who even specialize in

Where is IG?
  Doh!  Beverly Hills, CA.  Well, you see, thats your problem right there!  :-)
Is IG owned by someone else?
How many of you haven\'t been paid?
How much haven\'t you been paid?
Did you sign a contract before you submitted your work or after?
What are the terms of the contract?

I happen to know (electronically anyway), an entertainment/copyright lawyer in Los
Angeles who runs LawGirl.Com   http://ww.lawgirl.com/
You might want to take a look at her pages concerning copyright law.

Although, individually, most of your claims aren\'t worth the costs involved, in the
aggregate, they might be.  Also, they are things a lawyer can do for you short of
going to court; I don\'t know why but letters from lawyers tend to result in payment
of debts outstanding.  Funny thing that.

There\'s alway the better business bureaus.

You could call the game distributers and let them know that Marc has just made all

side.  That wouldn\'t be a good idea.

How about calls to the IG accounts payable department person in the wee hours of
California time?

It\'s not, IMO, that bad.  The problem is that you either have to 
risk people or have a probe.  If a probe gets thrown 36 parsec off 
in a random direction (and sticking with cannon that machines can\'t 
handle jump without human help), you would have to wait decades to get 
the info back from each experiment.  People might not have a problem
with finding their way back 36 parsecs, but they might object to the
fact nothing every comes back at all.  (And as to making sure you
always get the "emerges at a random spot" result, that restriction
might depend on a variable that doesn\'t even occur to you.  Like the
net kinetic energy of the to 10% of the neutrinos that happen to
be passing by when you jump).

While this means that the misjump effect has the potential to
be used for >jump 6, it is also reasonable that solving it is
simply to difficult and dangerous to assay.

That theme has been used in a *lot* of SF over the years. Here\'s a filk
song on the subject.

            Space is Dark (words & music: Bill Roper)

Chorus:
	Space is dark and space is deep,
	And the price we\'ve paid is far too steep.
	Though we\'ve gained a hero\'s name,
	We\'re all cripples just the same,
	And the scars we bear will testify
	To the pain we\'ve found beyond the sky.

We set out in our starship in twenty-forty-nine,
Sent to ply the galaxy, another earth to find.
They put us in our coffins and gently closed the lid.
And if I\'d known then what I know now, I\'d\'ve wished we\'d wake up dead.

And so we flew a thousand years through interstellar space.
Light years seperated us from the human race.
Then at last we slowed as we approached our target star,
And now we\'d find the reason that we\'d travelled so far.

CHORUS

As we awoke from frozen sleep, we each knew what to do.
We\'d scan the sky about the star for a planet shining blue.
We\'d pull into an orbit, and check her atmosphere,
And run a half a hundred tests to see if she proved fair.

We\'d monitor the radio so that we could see
If there were any aliens who\'d come here before we.
Then from our receiver a tiny voice we heard,
And it spoke to us in English and we understood each word.

CHORUS

Ten years we had been on our way when they found the hyperdrive,
And man spread to a thousand stars while we were half alive.
But still they could not stop our ship to save us from our fate.
And so we have arrived here but nine hundred years too late.

They told us we were heroes, pinned medals on our chests,
And they gave us a fine pension and sent us off to rest.
For we\'re anachronisms from another place and time,
And so they have retired us though we\'re all still in our prime.

CHORUS

And of the ten men in our crew, but two of us remain,
For trapped here in the future, we all have gone insane.
We knew when we set out that we\'d be gone a thousand years,
But we never thought we\'d end up as unwanted pensioneers.

And soon we two will follow where the other eight have gone,
And then our long sad journey will finally be done.
In the next room waiting is my time-lost lonely wife,
And I\'ll see her one last time as we take each other\'s life.


Bit of a downer, no?

Consensus in the SF community is that going on a sleeper ship or a
generation ship is a *bad* bet.

The Journal was like this ML, a place to propose new concepts.  People tried
them out and the writers got feed back.  If the feedback was appropriate,
then someone would make a statement adding a concept to canon.  One article
in the JTAS doesn\'t make a thing canon.  Just like if the list decided that

Let\'s see at TL 9 would that be 10% of the mass of the hard drive, or is

I would guess that the scientist who study this periodically would all come
to the same conclusion.  You can cause a misjump in all kinds of ways.  Even
predictable ways.  You just can\'t control the outcome.  I wouldn\'t have any
problem with being able to misjump, just because you wanted to.  Being able
to control a misjump is another matter.

I had the impression that most of it was sent ahead of the ship into jump
space to make the tunnel.
And that only the stuff in the surge tank was actually pumped out around the
ship, to add an extra buffer space.  The hydrogen isn\'t even around the ship
until it is in jump space.  So, you don\'t have to worry about baddies
disrupting it.

	as said in BBvsBR I, if an overwhelming force attacks, victory
	can be nearly sure. The BR only have a problem, when they are in
	the lower position. A BB can jump out.

	Well from a certain point, a BR/BB will show a turtle aproach:
	Good defenses to stand in the line of battle, is for more
	importance than having first strike weapons. If screens are bigger
	than meson guns, and if armor is superior to any PA, the "temporary
	damage - ship explodes" or "temporary damage - screen" can kill.
	The great equaliser in TNE:BR are of course missiles, they can make
	a 6 points hit, and can cause 2 points of permanent damage even to
	large vessels. For this reason the Valor Corvette has a high value.

	From: Jump Theory Research Group (Platon)	31-1201
	To: Gushemege Mercantile Guild (Usdiki)
	Distribution: classified

	Recent analysis on the miss jump occurances of our Roaches Class
	of vessels, allowed to predict and partly influence miss jumps.
	This is the second time that JTRG-Platon managed a break through
	over imperial standard. Even if we know that the Roach has not
	the strategic value a perfect Jump Torpedo could have, because
	of the high likelihood of miss jumps. The leak of the information
	to the Regency, caused their fear of our superiority and massive
	research on their side to build Jump Torpedos also. As long they
	have just managed to reduce the size to 55dt, if our intelligence
	is true. Even if the influenced miss jump, could be considered a
	greater bluff, than the working Jump Torpedos, using SuSAG contacts
	to inform the Regency should be considered.

	Their fear, that we have attack weapons, we don\'t use because of our
	peacefulness, gave us a not at war opportunity to develop during
	the last 50 years.

	The experiment : We modified a Milavi-12-350 to use a Roaches
	mainframe for jump calculation, who was known to be insane
	since jump and miss jumped all the time. A second mainframe at
	TL:16 from Platon production, was between the Roaches mainframe
	and the jump control computer, using dynamical firewalling
	bridging for communication to avoid cross infections, to recalculate
	the given data, and to initiate jump. The key is sorting those
	jumps out who are J1 miss jumps and have a high likelihood of
	falling in the right direction, and most important being non
	cataclysm.

	The first jump was trail wards from Platon deep into Tansa, where
	the ship needed about 2 weeks of repair. The second jump went
	rim wards to avoid ending in a rift, and exits in upper Truax
	where the ship was found by a prospector two month later, who
	sent for a Kazuo JumpPort to repair. Well the Milavi had its
	home run inside the dock, reducing the Kazuo to J3, as its jump
	drive was beyond repair.

	Conclusion: Using an insane computer for calculation, and a sane
	at TL:16 for cross/checking/sorting, points of chaos can be found,
	showing a high likelihood of a miss jump in the "right" direction.
	We should build a handful experimental ships containing at least
	3 jump drives and as much independed computer networks, to use
	them in courier service. Center of the operation should be
	Kamurinmur, as this would both show our strength there, and is
	a more save landing than the Rurevayn. Even if we know that this
	would be an expensive enterprise, its a necessarily that we show
	them up and running before the Regency itself is able build
	2m3-sealed jump drives.

	Well the later Gazelle (TNE-FFS1) had its fuel calculated that

	drop tank - J5 " double jump, or " J3 - drop tank - engage
	in battle with full HEPlaR tanks " operations.

	usage of fuel, accellerated at C avoids that the jump bubble
	collapsed because of the "pressure" of the event horrision -

	also exit jump space within a week, but converted by E=MC^2.

	Even the standart jump explosion can be viewed with human eye, as
	the LHy bas to tunnel out of the event horrision, before the ship
	itself exits. Those 40% of fuel of an xBoat is a lot of energy !

	This has of course tactical implications. A fleet that exits at 100
	diameter, will produce a white out for one turn. Unfortuntely itself
	will exit AFTER the white out, so anybody knows arriving ships, and
	if the planet has advanced defense, its sushi - dead fish.

	So fleets take the advantage and exit somewhere deep in the system.
	BB and BRs receive tanker support, TF and BT jump out.  The timelag

You know, you may have something there. Rocket engines generate truly
*incredible* amounts of power. But you can\'t "use" the power for
anything except propulsion without downgrading them rather severely.

So I got this silly idea. What if a J-drive turns the hydrogen into
some sort of "energy" that isn\'t *usable* for anything except jump. Of
course, this means that the "jump capacitors" or whatever they are
can\'t be used for storing power either. 

Say that just as a rocket engine turns thermal energy in directed
motion, a j-drive turns the "binding energy" of the fusing atoms into
warping of space time. 

One thing that\'d help decide if this handwave is workable, is if
nuclear damper tech shows up at or near jump tech. I don\'t remember,
and since MT is the latest stuff I\'ve got, I can\'t be sure.

If this works, the "jump capacitors" (or whatever you use to store the
"power") might be something that "stores" the power by "expanding" one
of the 7 dimensions of space time that are currently "wrapped"
(theories say that the universe has 11 dimensions. It\'s just that in
the extra 7 "directions" the distance around the circumference of the
universe is smaller than an atomic nucleus.). 

This is something that you might try to do as a means of getting around
the lightspeed barrier. We can state that it doesn\'t work, but that if
you take the "energy" from when the \'"inflated" dimensions snap back to
normal and feed it ito a J-drive, it lets you enter jumpspace and make
a jump.

This gives the evolutionary path of the drive as this:

First they try to build something that allows expanding the extra
dimensions big enough to get a ship into. These efforts do manage to
cause some expansion, but they can\'t get the expansion to a useful size
*and* they can\'t maintain the expansion for more than about 30 minutes.

Collapse of the expansion field tends to be rather spectacular. Much of
the energy ppumped in comes back out as heat.

Various attempts at stabilizing the expansion they *can* get lead to a
device that surprises researchers when the collapse of the expansion
field causes the entire apparatus (and a lot of surrounding items) to
vanish. 

There are no injuries as the standard precautions against an
uncontrolled collapse of the field dictate that the experiment be
carried out in a sort of bunker well away from anything important, and
controlled remotely.

Various sorts of beacons and recording gear are added to the units, in
the hopes of finding out where they go. Finally a group that is testing
out in space (in an asteroid belt) puts a unit in free space, more than
100 diameters from their asteroid lab. Several weeks later, the beacon
is picked up. Jump has been discovered. 

The problem is that while they know it work, they don\'t know *why* it
works. They\'ve finally figured out that the "expansion" gizmos *didn\'t*
cause the jump. Instead, it was the "stabilizer" that somehow does it
*using* the controlled collapse of the expansion field. 

Jump physics is rather an empirical science. They try things, and see
what happens. 

BTW, this *could* give an explanation for why there seems to be a "jump
6" limit, and why it\'s so hard to go for j1 to J2, J2 to J3, etc. 

Those extra 7 dimensions each key into a *specific* jumpspace. And the
J1 space is associated with the dimension that\'s easiest to try to
expand. So to increase J number, you have to figure out how to work
with a *new* one of the dimensions (and they can be as different as
space and time). 

So some suspect that J 7 is the limit. Others look at misjump and
wonder if there are *other* "micro-dimensions" that our theories don\'t
cover, or that combos of dimensions may be involved. But since misjumps
are so disastrous (and *expensive*) they can\'t do many experiments. 

I just came up with this off the top of my head. But I think it has
possibilities. It\'s still technobabble, but it seems to fit together
nicely *and* explain some of the oddities about jump drives.

Just a minor quibble. You need more than two numbers to specify
*someone else\'s* vector. You can specify your own *heading* that way.
And you can specify their heading that way. But to specify a *vector*,
you need an origin cordinate. And that takes *three* numbers (either
X,Y, and Z, or Rho, Theta, and dex). 

So it should be:

"Emergence plotted at 233 mark 15, range 2.5 gigameters. Heading of
 emergence cloud is 135 mark 85."

That\'d mean that the ship emerged 233 degrees from the "zero" direction
in the reference plane, 15 degrees above it, at a distance of 2.5
million km. The heading you can figure out on your own. :-)

Yeah, but each tender with ships is a unit. Each BR can take out a
BB----whoever hits first wins in HG, right? So a Tender with 2 BRs
will kill any BB. And that combo of tender +2 BRs might even be
cruiser size. I\'d say the BBs are *always* outnumbered since
published tenders (in BR) carry 6 BRs.

I was talking HG for the most part in the one shot one kill type of
"canon" it creates. In BR the first Outstanding sucess kills you
with a spinal MG. defenses mean nothing in BR, if you beat the
screen by any real amount (from an Outstanding success) you will go
through the screen. The attack will be DV-screen and will do
multiple criticals in BR. PAWs aren\'t serious weapons in BR (the
game). They have more use in HG, though.

That\'s why I never used their missile rules, it was the _first_
thing I threw away. The fact that all the tasks in BR are one level
too easy doesn\'t help, either! (check out the task mapping to TNE in
the back of BR and you\'ll see what I mean)

Sorry, wrong answer. It was determined quite a few years back that the
conservation laws are actually just another way of stating certain
"invariances". It\'s called Neother\'s theorem. 

Conservation of energy is just a way of saying that the laws of physics
don\'t change over time.

Conservation of momentum is a way of saying that the laws don\'t change
with *location*. And conservation of angular momentum is a way of
saying that they don\'t change with *direction* (ie the laws are the
same when you face east, as when you face north).

So the boks *do* have to balance, or things get a bit too weird to deal
with.

Easy. To make it *reproducible*, you are going to have to perform
"controlled" experiments. That is, do *deliberate* misjumps, while
attempting to control the variables, and then get make *extensive*
observations when it emerges. And finally, you need to get the ship
back. 

Doing that *once* is expensive. Doing it enough times to collect a
reasonable set of data is going to be *hideously* expensive. Heck,
until J-3 or so, the odds of getting the ship back are pretty slim. 

And don\'t forget that the circumstances that can result in a misjump
can also result in the *destruction* of the ship! Plus, since many of
the circumstances are things like lack of engineers, or overdue
maintenance, we don\'t *know* what caused the misjump.

You need a high J number *and* a large enough "empire" that all the
likely destinations are inside your borders. Plus a lot of luck.

As it is, I bet most governments will pay a premium for *good* (ie
reliable and reasonably certain to be untampered with) data from ships
that *have* misjumped.

Read the misjump rules. Here\'s a quote from The Traveller Book:

"A misjump is an unpredictable random jump. Throw one die to determine
the number of dice thrown (1-6); throw that number of dice to determine
the distance of the misjump in hexes. Then throw one die to determine
the direction of the misjump (one of the six directions possible on the
hex grid). Finally, throw one die to determine the number of weeks
spent in jump space before the ship re-emerges at its new location."

So if the first roll is a 6, you roll 6 dice for distance. If all six
come up sixes, that\'s 36 hexes. 

If I was going to re-write that rule, I\'d consider two changes. First,
I\'d make the initial roll be 1-Jn. So for a J1 ship, you roll 1 die.
For a J-2, you roll 1-2, J3, 1-3, etc. Second, I\'d tie the number of
weeks to the number of dice rolled for distance.

Here\'s a thought, why are words called fuel?  Oh, yes they are.  As in the
expression "fuel for thought" or "fuel for the debate (or argument)".  Are
words fuel?  No, but they act like fuel, they start or keep something going.
What is LHyd?  It\'s a fuel, it\'s a coolant, if it\'s cold enough and under
sufficient compression, it\'s even a metal.  My point is, when you think of
LHyd, what do you think of?  Probably fuel.  LHyd is required to start a
jump drive.  So, naturally you would call it fuel.

The Rusty Pelican is supposed to be one of the nicer fish/seafood

I have considered that myself.  I still wanna know do they taste like

OBTW, someone lurking over my shoulder has asked, "Wouldn\'t that be

I tried to explain why it wouldn\'t be, but I need someone else to validate

Stars don\'t "capture" chunks of rock or metal. Stars form from clouds
of gas and dust. The gas condenses into tiny ice particles. The ice and
dust accumulate into "dirty snowballs. These collide, and form bigger
snowballs. At the same time the whole mess is contracting under its own
gravity. 

The star forms in the center, the planets and planetoids form from the
snowballs farther out. So the available materials are the *same*. 

When bodies get big enough, heat from radioactive isotopes can cause
partial melting. That causes the dust to settle towards the core, which
causes even higher temps. Large enough bodies differentiate into a
layer of ice over a layer of rock over a metallic core.

Close enough to the star, the heat and solar wind (which is *much*
stroner in forming stars and very young stars) drive off the ice on the
nearer bodies unless they are *very* large. They can even drive off
some of the elements in the "rocky" layer (Mercury is a *lot* denser
than Earth from this effect). 

In the outer regions of the system the gases lost by the inner system
get drawn in by the bodies there. In the middle ranges, collisions
between planetesmals can knock large chunks of the stony layers off of
each other, as well as break off chunks of the metal core.

So smaller planets will have metals, but mostly in the core, except for
stuff brought up by tectonic activity. Asteroid sized bodies may be
rock, metal, or a mixture. And they\'ll be easily available.

But the only difference the *size* of the star makes is how close in
you have to deal with extensive ice layers. 

The age makes a difference in the extent to which the planetismals have
conglomerated, and the extent to which bodies have differentiated. 

Now if you get into the matter of stellar *generations*, then there are
big differences in what *kind* of metals are avialable, as well as the
quantity. But here we are talking about tens of billions of years.

Stars like Sol are third generation. That\'s mostly what you are going
to find in the spiral arms. They are about 5 billion years old.

Second generation stars are about 10 billion years old, and are much
poorer in the heavier elements. 

First generation stars are more than 15 billion years old and
essentially date from the formation of the galaxy. The have only
hydrogen and helium. They are pretty much restricted to the galactic
core, and to globular clusters.

You aren\'t going to find any first generation stars anywhere the
players are going to get to. Second generation stars are possible, but
they\'ll be *really* rare, as they won\'t be native to this part of the
galaxy. They\'ll tend to be passing thru at high relative velocities.

Not really. Heck, *I* would tend to ask that. Not because I agree, but
because while I\'m familiar with most of the reasons folks dislike jews,
I\'d be wondering what he had against barbers. *After* he answers, then
I\'ll likely know if there\'s any point in arguing with him.

In the continuing effort to present a balanced menu of socio-political
options to the TML, may I point out for additional consideration another
pair of temporal transplants, from the Strugatsky brothers\' early stories?
Sergei Kondratev and Evegeny Slavin were the only survivors of the first
~jump drive experiment, who suddenly reappeared a century or so after their
disappearance and found themselves in a massively more technologically and
socially advanced humanity.  Slavin adapts fairly quickly, gets a
girlfriend, and becomes a journalist.  Kondratev mopes a lot more,
exploring the traditional anomie and feeling useless &c., until Gorbovsky
drops by and sets him up as a submarine fish-herder in the Kuriles, and he
lives happily ever after.

Obviously, their superior adaptation to the situation was made possible by
their "home" and "target" societies having transcended the capitalist stage
of society.

ObTrav:  Speaking of Gorbovsky, anyone else ever use Leonid Andreevich as
an NPC or patron in a Traveller game?  And what _are_ the sofas of the
Third Imperium like?

	imho 1 million people are a good number :

	- its large enough to sustain TL:6 by its own production, and
	  a much higher TL, if aided by trade.
	- a atmos 6 or 8 world can be classified "Rich" to encurage trade
	  and to help the new colony to sustain a higher techlevel.

	Hell why colonisation, if not for adding an other productive system ?

	Well why not recolonisation of a system with a popcode of 6 with
	about 30.000 people some TL\'s higher than the natives. This would
	also add for production.

FWIW, I\'ve run across openly anti-Semitic clergy and layfolk of various
denominations, or had them run across me.  Some are quite outgoing.  I
still  get hate mail every so often from one Aryan Nations church over in
Idaho; they picked my name out of the phone book because it\'s _obviously_
Jewish as well as foreign-looking -- foreign besides Jewish-foreign, that
is -- and I was rash enough to taunt them.  And mocking the sheep is the
same as mocking the shepherd, isn\'t it?  <G>  In any case, yes, I\'m told by
these folks -- and one other Catholic parish priest out in Michigan I met
up with -- that we Jews _routinely_ pray to Satan and hate wee Christian
babies with a ferocious passion.

Just recently the holy people over the mountains were so powerfully
RIGHT!!!! with the LORD!!! that they sent a FINAL!!!! death threat to me,
presumably in reaction to that infamously Jewish holiday, Martin Luther
King Day.

(Exclamation marks as per original.)

For you fringe-watchers out there, this is the same clique as whose
spokesmodel, a few years back during that Weaver business up in those
parts, was interviewed outside their compound by a swarm of network
reporters, denounced Z.O.G. and proclaimed that "Randy Weaver is the ONLY

Well, all it is is a jumped up version of a Red Lobster in many ways, but
as I had a business meeting we ate here instead of Red Lobster.  I does
have a very good bar & wine cellar better than most bars that is.  As for
it being on the water front.  No it isn\'t its near the Arizona Mills Mall,
& as Arizona is a desert, I have not been able to find the a waterfront
dive, yet.  ;<)

But, hey if this person thinks that we have beachfront land, we can make a
fortune. ;<)

I was wondering even about the "wider range of damage results" part.

2d6 is a range of 2-12, or 11 values.

2d6 +1d6 -1d6 = 3d6 -1d6 = -3 to 17, or 21 results, 3 of which are
meaningless (4 if you count the 0 which is dealt with by missing the
to-hit roll), so it is 18 (or 17). 

A straight 3d6 roll has 16 values.

It seems like a lot of trouble for gaining 2 (or just 1) useful outcomes
- --and what do you do if hit by a bullet for -3, heal? :-)

I think a better way to get at what is wanted is to ask "what do we
want here?" If the answer is "Damage values that go from 1 to some
number for a hit" then either use different dice, or do something
like 1d6, 2d6-1, 3d6-2, 4d6-3, and so on. This does make a lot of
sense because you can get the same grazing would from a pistol shot
that you might from a rifle even though the maximum damage of the
rifle might be higher.

Probably. Though there aren\'t a *lot* of unusual stars in the measley
couple of hundred parsecs than constitute "known space". 

> What about nebulas?  Are there any in Traveller?  Any rules for em, i mean...

Contary to what they show in Star Drek, nebulae are *light years*
across. Anything from a few hexes to multiple sectors. And they are
still a pretty damn good vacuum. The glow is from *very* energetic
stars inside.

The "dark" nebulas are only noticeable as absorbing light over light
years of distance. If you were inside one, you\'d notice some sensor
degradation but only at extreme ranges. Except from your astronomy
folks, who\'d notice they couldn\'t see the stars. :-)

The only nebula I can recall in known space is in Dark Nebula sector.
But I can\'t find any details.

Antares is the only red giant nearby. And it\'s thought that it may go
supernova sometime in the next thousand years.

Star systems have differences in vector that a jumping ship would have to
take into account.  What is the range of differences that could be normall
expected?  Is it closer to 10, 30 or 100 km/s?  And would these differences
be better modeled by a normal or uniform distribution?

How easy would it be to determine vector differences between systems within
a 6 parsec radius?  If it would be a routine task then ships would make
these calculations on the fly, but if the task was difficult or took an
extended period of time some sort of table of vectors would make more
sense.  If such a "book" of vectors was appropriate, how often would it
need updating?  Would it still be good after a thousand years? Five
thousand?

Within a system ships would have to match orbital velocites when moving
from jump point (or planet) to planet.  _Scouts_ had a lot of information,
but it didn\'t include formulas for calculating orbital velocities, and, it
seems to me, that would be rather important.  Are planetary orbital
velocities based solely on distance from the primary? Are factors such as
planetary density and stellar type important enough to be taken into
account?

Merrick, I think your idea has a great deal of merit.  I\'d agree that most
personal weapons have the potential of doing some sort of minimal damage (1
point).  Some weapons\' minimum damage, OTOH, might be 2, 3, or more points. 
CT rated weapons rather like this, didn\'t it?

However, I still wonder just how any of these techniques are going to work. 
Unless, we\'re talking about moving to a Hit Point system and away from
individual dice reducing individual Characteristics.  I think arguments can
be made for both methods of applying damage, and that\'s why I proposed
using both.  ;-)

You have missed my point.  Sure you can come up with a reason why
"fuel" might not mean fuel, just as you can come up with fiddles
to make the jump bubble theory fit all the other aspects that
were made up for the original approach.  But then you are left
with all these odd little things for no apparent reason, and
it gets a bit more hokey.

Marc.   We love your work.  We really do.  Or at least I do.  But Merrick\'s
argument has a great deal of merit.  I hope you can consider them objectively.
I\'ve lurked without comment for much of this D+D- discussion.  But the time has
come to say that it is going to be a hard sell, especially to experienced
RPGers.  You defended a lot of critiques previously by saying that proposed
alternatives.  But that argument proves too much against the whole idea of D+D-.

I\'ll not comment further, but I thought you\'d appreciate another sincere comment
from one who greatly appreciates your works.

  Not entirely true.  If you use the literary work, they will have to sue you.
An expense for them, to be sure.  If they do, the doctrine of "fair use" will
protect you somewhat, if you didn\' create the work.  If you were the author,
and agreed to transfer the rights, but they didn\'t follow through on their part
of the deal, your rights are still your rights.  You wrote it, you use it.

    'body' => 'Hello Eris,
  To answer your question regarding the "physics" involved (I am not an
expert, but have been digging into astrophysics for answers to the very
question you ask), here are a few "thoughts"...

1) the gravitational pull (attraction) between two objects is based upon
not only the distance, but the mass of the two objects.  The attaction
varies inversely with the distance.  When dealing with a mass 10 object,
and a mass 20 object next to a mass 2.3 e 10 mass object, the mass 20
object actually falls in towards the center of the mass 2.3 e 10 object
faster than does the mass 10 object.  However, the difference is so
slight, that for all intents and purposes, they accellerate at the same
rate.  The way this affects planetary orbits?  The force of attraction
between the planets mass must be equalled by the centripetal force of the
planet\'s speed.  The idea of a string attached to the ball and you
swinging the ball applies here.  The string represents the gravitational
attraction between the ball (planet) and your hand (sun).  The faster you
swing the ball, the stronger that force has to be.  If you rotate that
ball so fast that it breaks the string, it then escapes from you.


2) stars (according to the one accretion theory I read, have a center of
density that is higher towards the center than it is towards the outer
orbits of the star system.  I don\'t know if this "aspect" is true or not,
just that it was a given in the accretion theory.

3) stars contain better than 90% (I am inclined to say 99% but I am not
sure if this is correct, so I hedge with 90%) of the mass, while the
planets contain a similar ratio of rotational momentum (hope I am saying
that correctly).  In essence, the star has the most mass, but the least
rotational energy, while the planets have the most rotational energy, but
least mass.

  An object in motion tends to stay in motion unless an outside force is
actin upon it.  Thus, stars moving at a specified velocity will tend to
maintain that velocity until something else massive enough can affect it
(such as a gravitational mass - stars, dead stars, etc).  Theoretically
speaking, the stars will continue in the direction they are going in
unchanged.

  Ok, having said that mouthful above, every stat I have seen on star\'s
velocity is based upon "relative" to earth/sol.  Stars that I have come
across the stats for speak in terms of "teens" speed.  I have never seen
speeds in hundreeds of kilometers per second (doesn\'t mean there aren\'t
any, just that I haven\'t seen any <grin>).

  If I might suggest, there is an EXCELLENT program that I purchased for
my amiga many years back, and is currently available for the IBM.  It is
called DISTANT SUNS, which you can still find available if you do a web
search on that title.  It\'s put out by Adromeda software I believe.  In
any case, it shows not only the name of any sun you click on within the
screen, it will also show you the star\'s type, as well as it\'s velocity...  

  One final thing to note:  Scientists can tell what temperature a sun
burns at by using spectral analysis of the star\'s light.  Each "element"
burns at a specific temperature (yadda yadda yadda - explanation not even
attempted because of lack of full understanding) which produces a
signature.  Scientists can also measure the doppler shift of the star
involved, and get an idea of it\'s velocity based on the dopler shift.
Over a period of time, both the dopler shift, plus the shift of the
observed star in the skies by use of mathematics, we can get the apparent
direction of speed plus the speed of stars.

  Hope this answers your questions regarding the astrophysics involved

PS - if anyone can correct my presentation of facts *PLEASE* do, since
this is mostly self taught, and may be fraught with errors depite my best
attempts to have reasoned this correctly.

The phrase I was looking for above was angular momentum <sigh>...

Also, the formula that I spoke of before regarding gravitational
attraction is:

G(MaMb/r^2)

 where G is a constant Ma is the first mass and Mb is the second mass and
r is the distance.

G is listed as 6.67 e -11  N*m^2/kg^2

Hit Location

Milleniums End is the game that person has been talking 
about.

IMO the game is not so swift as could be, there are charts
for various guns quoting the MV of them with and without
silencers and the MV and wound effects of the projectile 
type being used at various ranges. There was a comprehensive 
range of body armour to be taken into the calculations, along
with a very realistic seeming method of death by trauma etc.
I have played one game of this and the emphasis was a 
military style one.  The characters got killed fairly 
easily, even when wearing fairly good body armour.


I can say it may be a little faster to play combat in this
system than say Aftermath by FGU which uses up to 20 phases
in each of which a person may speak one syllable.

Instant Kills

I do not like the instant kill rules of any game system.  When
someone has spent a number of hours developing a character, only
to have a minor combat and end un unlucky and have the character
die.
Even if they may be of a militaristic bent then I do not feel
that when they are used in the manner for which they were 
created there should be such a level of realism.  There is
the Reallife (tm) for being realistic in, whereas in a RPG
I feel that I want to have fun and play some kinda comic book
hero - who can battle amazing odds and somehow with some 
cunning scrape by and survive.


Luck

I do not know about other peoples instances but sometimes
you know you are going to roll a certain number.

DM - A enemy is pointing a laser rifle at your character, if 
you roll two dice and don\'t get a 2 then he will not shoot 
at your characters vacc suit face plate.

ME Rolled a 2

Another instance - new ship darn good crew - fully annual maintenanced
they misjump first two jumps.

Another instance - Pilot rolls a 2 - failure rolls a 12 - Crash lands 
	Next trip Same Pilot rolls a 2 - failure rolls a 12 - Crash lands again

Another instance - Grav Bike - rolls a 2 - failure rolls a 7 - falls off
        Gets straight back on rolls a 2 - failure rolls a 7 - falls off

It all depends on your handwaving.

Jump sequence
: Field strength increased at primary node (jump "exhaust" port)
: small "hole" opens into j-space
: rapid discharge of hydrogen into j-space to form bubble
: field str increase to cover whole ship
: ship translates into j-space - inside the bubble
: field modulated to keep bubble from expanding too much

This allows you to re-introduce drop tanks (if you want them in your universe) without needing the huge j-capacitors or "old" canon.

The need to translate into j-space before the hydrogen bubble can dissipate adds that time critical element - "bring the field up to level three now!  Use the fuel reserve to supplement the bubble, but get me that power now!"

Jump
	In the best of circumstances, a ship leaves a world and accelerates directly
toward the safe jump point 100 planetary diameters out. When it arrives there
it jumps (spending a week in jumpspace) and breaks out about 168 hours later.
Upon arrival, it retains its speed and direction (which happens to point
directly at the intended destination. The ship then decelerates to the
destination, and lands to complete its journey.
	Complication 1: DestinationWorld is smaller. If the DestinationWorld is
smaller than the OriginWorld, the ship will leave jumpspace closer to the
world. The ship will be unable to decelerate enough to stop at the
DestinationWorld and it will have to spend extra time maneuvering.
	Complication2: DestinationWorld is larger. If the DestinationWorld is larger
than the OriginWorld, the ship will leave jump space farther out. The ship
will have to travel farther to reach the DestinationWorld.
	Complication3: DestinationWorld is not in the direction the ship is going
(that is, when it entered jump, its vectors of speed and direction was
retained; when it leaves jump, that vector is not pointed at the
DestinationWorld). If the DestinationWorld is not in the exact direction the
ship is travelling, the ship will have to maneuver to reach its destination.
This may require a course change of up to 180 degrees.
	Complication4: DestinationWorld is occluded by another world or star. If
another world or star in located on a straight line between the OriginWorld
and the DestinationWorld, the ship will leave jumpspace when it first crosses
a sphere 100 diameters out from the intervening body. This may cause the ship
to leave jumpspace elsewhere in the intended system, or even in another
system.
	Complication5: DestinationWorld is within 100 diameters of the system star.
If the DestinationWorld is within 100 diameters of the system star, the ship
will leave jump space farther out from the world than desired. The ship will
have undertake additional maneuver to reach the destination.

I have to disagree here.  I\'ll use my own (unofficial) rules as an example
to explain why I support optional rules.

I\'ve created a set of detailed trade rules intended for small
owner-operated merchant starships(1).  Although my group liked them (the
rules), we only used them when the thrust of the adventure was trading. 
In adventures where the more interesting stuff was, say, an espionage
mission, we used the standard Merchant Prince-style trade rules(2).

Why?  Because although my rules are fairly simple, they do add some
complexity to the game, in the sense that there is more for the players to
keep track of.  Eg. instead of carrying 20t of TL5/A goods they are
carrying 10t of grapple grommets, 5t of refined aluminium, and 5t of
petrolium byproducts.  More interesting (for a merchant), but more
complicated too.

Although I (naturally) think that my merchant rules are pretty good, I
wouldn\'t advocate making them the standard merchant rules because they do
take longer than many groups will want to spend on economic matters.  I
also took care to make the general results similar to those obtainable
using the standard rules, so that there is no gaming advantage to using my
rules - just increased enjoyment for those that like trading.


To summarize: I believe that optional rules have their place, because they
allow individual gaming groups to select the balance between simplicity
and realism that\'s right for them.  These optional rules should produce
the same general results as the regular rules, with an increased level of
detail.

This sounds like the ship _must_ come out at the 100Diam point.  Is this
a necessity?  That would seem to preclude useful insystem
jumps(microjump)if there are no large planetary bodies in the outsystem.

In the real universe, nearly all systems have high relative velocities
to one another(ex 140km/sec for Barnards Star WRT Sol, the highest of
our local cluster.(1))  This a minor problem but should necessitate a
ship matching vectors before jump, probably well away from the mainworld
to avoid traffic.   To calculate a vector match I use: 
_____________________________________________________________________________
Time to Kill 140km/s Relative Velocity(140km/s to 0km/s)
 
t=V/a

	V=140km/s(for Barnard, top end of local group)
	a=1.0g(10m/s) (up to 6g available in Trav!)

 t then is 3.9 hrs
_____________________________________________________________________________

All velocities are relative, and the target planet "not going in the
right direction" match is less than the vector match of the target
system\'s relative motion (as the target world is always being carried
along with the system at approximately its relative motion.)  Just shave
a few km/sec off the target v and you have a ship vector matched for
opposite direction in orbit.
_____________________________________________________________________________
Angular Velocity of Earth to Sun

V= x/t  (where x= dist and t is time)
	x=3.141(2)(149 E 9m)=	936 E 9m (pi x diam)
	t= 365.25day/yr(24 hr/day)(3600s/hr)=315.6 E 5 s

V then is 2.97 E 4 m/s = 29.7 km/s
_____________________________________________________________________________

This is almost an order of magnitude lower than the relative motion
match, and could be assumed to be taken into consideration in the ships
nav programs.  The maximum V to accel to would be about 170km/s, and min
would be 110km/sec.  Better run those programs!

A nice complication if the ships jump precipitates by gravity (ala Larry
Niven.) I never envisioned Jspace to be like that-it would be more of a
hyperspace system. Jspace seems more like diving "into" space using
higher dimensions, so that the only points a jumpship travels through
are _literally_ the exit and emergence points.  There are no intervening
bodies in realspace(that we know of.) This allows the time independence
of jump ~168 hrs because that is the shortest distance/time between the
two realspace points.

This is valid.  It would also put Earth within the 100 diam limit. 
(Sol=1 million mile diam, Earth @ 93 million miles radius.) There will
not be a whole lot of ships precipitating out near worlds in the
habitable zone.

Finally, an additional complication or two: 
 
a)Space is not a vacuum.  What happens to a rouge rock, dust mote or
hydrogen atom when ISS Oblivion drops out of jump right "on top" of it? 
I propose Jdrive is sort of like a wormhole, and drags its origin space
along with it when it jumps "extruding" into realspace.  

b)TrafCon- having everybody and their brother jumping at random points
insystem could be a big hazard.  What if SS Bulkhauler is transiting the
emerging ships exit point when it precipitates?  Controlled systems will
have definate spaces set aside for jump/precipitation, with certain
EXACT corridors defined for incoming/outgoing ships, and arrivals from
nearby origin worlds.  Since there is no FTL comm, you can\'t tell
control of your intentions to "arrive here at this time," so the next
best thing is having arrival windows - preprogrammed slots and quadrants
for your origin world.  Of course you could drop in waaaaay outsystem,
but that wastes valuable time and money.

Marc, I hate to disagree, but many of us simply refuse to use Win95.  I\'m

Unless the population is a native species...  I kind of like this addition
as a trade code.  It would make for a good market for Ag worlds (anything
but cultured yeast!), and differentiate worlds that have bio-domes from
those that have adapted or modified colonists.

Marc,

My apologies for misplacing this e-mail (I forgot about it when I moved.
I was wondering if you still have these on hand?  If so, I would like
to order a copy of each.  How should I make the check out and how
should I address the envelope?

The project I am currently working on, At Close Quarters, is a variant
combat system based on my years of experience shooting, my training as a US
Army Sniper, and talking to dozens of police officers and combat veterans.
I offered to give it to IG for T4.1 for just the credit.  Others have done
the same with other projects.  So far, the only item I know has made it in
was QSDS.

Some of the best products for T4 have been written by list members, but
Marc has the final say, for better or worse.

Once again, we have discussed endlessly ways to fix Traveller, to correct
the stellar data, smooth out clunky rules.. I don\'t know how much effect we
have, but our collective complaints about the T$ task system has lead to
some changes.

>  #1 rule to abide by though: this *HAS* to be a labor of love, no

Considering IG\'s record of paying people, that\'s already assumed.  But on
the other hand, my time and effort are valuable.  I\'ve put hundreds of
hours into ACQ.  I\'d *like* to get something back for it, even if it\'s a
minimal amount.  I\'ve just sold a history of Traveller article to Troll
Magazine.  The contract arrived promptly, and the editor assured me that my
check will be mailed when the issue is printed.  This makes me feel good,
and I\'m enquiring if they would like further material from me.  Contrast
this to the work I\'ve done for IG, where I have to beg for information,
what work I submit is massacred (the illustrations for my JTAS article, my
ship designs in IS) and payment is no where in sight.

If this is a labor of love, it\'s starting to feel like an abusive
relationship.

It is his game.  We are all eager to help and playtest.

Sorry, but no.  If I do something, I want at least public acknowledgement
of my acts.  I did the ships for IS because Joe is a friend of mine and he
needed help.  No money was discussed.  But I did ask for a nice credit.  I
don\'t care if my name is in 8-point type in the "Additional Design and
Development" section as long as it\'s there and spelled correctly.

<snip>

I agree with you that we should provide help when asked, but my faith in IG
is so shaken by this point, that I have to wonder if it\'s worth the effort.
 I\'m a die-hard Traveller fan, but even I have my limits.

I apologize for the tone, but I am getting very frustrated with being told
that I should write more and more for less and less.

 The project I am currently working on, At Close Quarters, is a variant
 combat system based on my years of experience shooting, my training as a US
 Army Sniper, and talking to dozens of police officers and combat veterans.
 I offered to give it to IG for T4.1 for just the credit.  Others have done
 the same with other projects.  So far, the only item I know has made it in
 was QSDS.

I\'ll make the point that I am writing on T4.1 just about every day, and that I
share with the list the completed materials (so far: Chargen, Tasks, Skills).
I am working on Fighting / Personal Combat at the moment. I suppose, if
pressed, I could complete Equipment, Weapons, and Vehicles fairly quickly if
pressed.

As to offering ACQ to IGF, everyone knows that don\'t respond very quickly to
anything.

Personal Combat (in draft) is explicitly task based... an attempt to provide
in spelled out form how to actually do combat.

This, and other complications, are solved by making a "standing" rather than

I still don\'t like this new idea (well, new to Traveller, but you\'ve suggested 
it before). If this were true, ships would most likely move to a location 
above/below the plane of the ecliptic before jumping (and arrive at a similar 
location), to minimise the chance of meeting something along the way. Secondly, 
you would expect to see more misjumps arriving along the route, (and in the 
destination system, near a different world), whereas in fact they arrive 
randomly. Third, it implies a much closer connection between real space and 
jump space than has previously been suggested. This change breaks canon and may 
have far-reaching implications. I can\'t think of a single reason for including 
this.

OTOH, I use W95 and refuse to touch W3.x with a 10\' (sorry, 3.048m) pole. 
My preference for the s/w would be:

1. Designed for W95
2. Designed for W3.x, but will run under W95
3. Designed for DOS, but will run under W3.x and W95
4. DOS only
5. Something else

What it means is, you can\'t come out *within* 100d; you can come out at any point 
outside it.

Thanks for the reply Hal. It agreed with what I *thought* (we always like
our thoughts agreed with don\'t we?), and theory is always useful, but for
gaming purposes I was looking for something more along the lines of what
Charles and Bruce posted...

Hum...let\'s leave Pop II stars aside for the moment because they are
sports that won\'t come up very often and deal with Pop III stars.  We\'ve
got three suggestions for relative differences in motion between stars:
Hal suggested in the "teens", Charles suggested in the "less than 10km/s
range", and Bruce suggests "on the order of 50 km/s."  I consider Bruce
the resident expert on matters astronomical, so I\'m leaning *heavily*
toward his number, BUT just to clarify...

Bruce, are you saying that, on average, there is a 50km/s difference
between nearby stars?  Or are you saying that stars distribute normally
around 50km/s, and if so with what variance?

I was hoping that *most* stars within a few parsecs of each other would
have rather low relative motions.  

What I want to do is include a number (Vr) with the UPP for each system
that is an *abstract* representation it\'s relative motion to some fixed
point (a distant pulsar should work).  Ships jumping would have to perform
a "burn" changing their delta-V by the difference in this number between
systems A to B. (I know a heading and velocity are really needed, but I
want to abstract that for simplicity.)

After subtracting the Vr of A from B the resulting difference would be
the magnitude of the burn, in km/s and the sign would be the direction
of the burn.

My first thought on this was 4d6-4 (min:0, avg:10, max:20) for each star,
but this was just a SWAG.  It also doesn\'t handle sports with very high
relative motions.  I\'d like to be able to generate one of those
*rarely*...perhaps if a 0 comes up on the roll, reroll is done using a
1d100. 

This jibes with Charles and Hal\'s posts, but if I\'m not misreading
Bruce\'s post is *way* too low. What about it Bruce?

I think I\'ll go with a Difficult Task with normal sensors, Routine with
Science-grade sensors. 

Now, about Task duration...30 minutes sound about right?

Charles...

Agreed, but that would be up to the players.  If they want to depend on
their "bible", I won\'t stop them.  OTOH, I also want to know how likely
they are to royally screw up if they *don\'t* do a confirming observation.

Charles...

How long a database would stay "good" does depend on the era.  CT/MT\'s
Scout Service would have maintained upto date databases, so yearly updates
during annual maintenance would handle that.  TNE\'s databases would be
mostly trashed, and all the observations/calculations should be redone from
scratch.  M0, however, simply had *old* databases, in some cases over a
thousand years old; would these old bibles still be good?

That\'s what I had in mind.  

In "mapped" space each ship will have a Bible containing the
astrogational information needed to calculate the burn needed to match
orbital vector from Alpha-3 to Beta-2.  The Astrogator would consult the
database, do the calculation (or have the computer do it) and direct the
Pilot to make the appropriate burn prior to jump.  On jump-emergence,
the Astrogator would make observations, calculate addition vector
changes (as required delta-V), plot a course from the jump-point to the
target world, and pass it on to the Pilot.

In "unmapped" space the Astrogator will have to calculate the burn from
observations, and won\'t be able to match orbital velocity with planets
in the target system because she won\'t know what or where they are.
However, I would think our explorer would want to, at least, match the
stars relative velocity and *maybe* try to hit the orbital velocity of
the jump-point she is aiming for.  

Bruce...

Ah!  That\'s a complication, but with a hook.  In an exploration setting
then, the Astrogator would want to "shoot" all the stars in area from
each system as the ship moves through, correct.  This would refine the
distance calculations as they go.  How fast would the area of
uncertainty collapse, that is..if you have an uncertainty of a few
hundred AU with a one star sighting, what uncertainty will you have with
a two, three, four, n star sighting?


Now about the other half of my question...

The ship is in orbit around Alpha-3 and wants to match orbital velocity
with Alpha-7, ignoring how the ship gets from planet to planet, the
delta-V needed is simply the difference in orbital velocity, correct?

Orbital Velocity would be calculated as:

 R = Distance from primary in AU
 M = Mass in Solar Masses
 
  Period = (R^3 / M)^.5 * 31,557,600 seconds
  
  Circumference = 2 * (R) * Pi
  
  Orbital Velocity = (Circumference / Period) km/s

Example:

Terra-Earth :   Period = 31,557,600 sec
                Circum = 9.3996e8 km
                Vel    = 29.79 km/s
              
Terra-Mercury : Period = (.4^3/1)^.5 * 31,557,600 = 7,983,512 sec
                Circum = 59,800,000 * 2 * Pi      = 3.573e8 km
                Vel                               = 47.06 km/sec
                                
Terra-Jupiter : Period = (5.2^3/1)^.5 * 31,557,600 = 3.742e8 sec
                Circum = 777,900,000 * 2 * Pi      = 4.888e9 km
                Vel                                = 13.06 km/sec

Needed burn for Earth to Mercury is 47.06 - 29.79 = 17.27 km/s   

                Earth to Jupiter is 29.79 - 13.06 = 16.73 km/s
                
Does all that look right?

What happened in Australia was actually very different. The colony was
exteremely short of labour, and the convicts were quickly able to turn this
favourable bargaining position into good wages.

The colony was very short of cash money, and a rum economy soon developed,
managed by the local military (the NSW Corps). The problem for employers
was that whilst you could force a convict workforce to work by legal means,
getting them to work well required their co-operation (ie by paying them).
This was especially true for convicts who had to work without supervision,
such as shepherds.

Many of the convicts were also trained professionals at various things, and
these people often ended up being more successful at their real trade than
they could have been as criminals. I am especially thinking of a famous
architect, whose name I forget (*grin* doncha hate forgetting what you
learned in high school).

The colonial authorities also realised that convicts on parole needed much
less supervision etc, and developed a system of "tickets of leave", where a
convict had most of the rights of a free settler, but couldnt leave the
colony until their total time was up or they got a full pardon by other means.

This could be worded better (in addition to the missing close paren).
It sort of implies, if the reader reads it causally, that velocity
pointing at destination is part of the jump, rather than how it
was arranged to be.

I would make it... "Upon arrival, it retains its speed and direction
(usually arranged to point at the intended destination).

What are the odds of this?  Not very significant I would think (unless
you are talking about a nearby moon or something).

Also, should there be some mention that one also has to account for
the relative orbital velocities of the worlds and the galatic motions
of the stars in this process?

I also assume this will be more background and something the
GM will abstract rather than something that need to be calculated
each time a PC jumps...

Brilliant Lances (the TNE small-scale tactical space combat boardgame) had
that effect.  When you hit a ship, you rolled for location, depending on
what aspect of the ship was facing you. Different facings had different
hit tables.  One of the features I liked about the game, and will try to
reincorporate into T4 (if I switch to T4 for space rules).

I\'m not an astronomer, but I know enough to write an astral navigation
program that will give you exact vectors if someone else could provide the
database.  Fact is that the computing power required to do such calculations
is so miniscule that you could do it on your business ring and not interfere
with it\'s normal functions.

However, what you should be asking is:  "Are there currents in jump-space
that would need to be accounted for?  Are they constant or do they change?
Will such currents (if they exist) be consisistant?"

If there are currents and they are consistant, the the programming could be
added to the business ring program without any problem.  If the changes are
gradual, then you should be able to get updates from the starport you are
leaving from (assuming there is one) or from other spacers.

I chose the business ring because it is designed to exchange information
with other simular rings with the wearer even being aware of the transaction
unless the information fits within certain pre-established parameters.

Can you fix a grontonator?  Your character knows how and really, that\'s all
that matters isn\'t it?  OTOH, a little orbital mechanics and understanding
of the vectors involved probably wouldn\'t hurt any thing.  If you are not
well versed in higher math though, most of what\'s available would be of no
use to you.  I\'ve only seen one set of algebraic equations that deal with
the subject.  They were fairly straight forward and would give you enough
information to add a little flavor to your game.  They were written by Jerry
Pournelle in Galaxy magazine.

If you are interested,  I\'ll see if I can\'t find that issue and post them.

You can "home-brew" some of your own with just a little thought.  Presumably
you know the radius from the primary and the length of the year, from that
you can derive the angular velocity (speed at which the planet is moving).

Before I offer any more observations, perhaps I should wait and see if this
is what you had in mind.  I warn you though, it gets kinda hairy and the
astrologers (excuse me, I mean astronomers) aren\'t going to like it in it\'s
simplicity.

are fixed.

Relative v depends on the stars involved, but my example between Sol and

Planetary motion for earth could add/subtract 30km/sec worst case from

As I see it, that\'s an entirely different problem. ;->

In my games, overcoming the N-space relative velocities between systems and
matching orbital velocites with planets are something that will be taken
care of by the reaction drives.  If I was dealing with reactionless drives
for this I wouldn\'t bother to include it, but I want the players to have to
keep an eye on their fuel gauges, so I need to know whether I\'m talking
about a few , a few ten\'s or a few hundred\'s of km/s.  It looks like it\'s
in the few ten\'s range.

Jumps are done through wormholes created by the jump drive. That\'s part of
what the hydrogen is for, and I\'m not going to debate it, because I\'m
talking about *my* games here. ;-> 

The Astrogator uses special sensors to look down the wormhole and lock the
ship\'s course through it to another system. The quality of the sensors, of
the drive and the skill of the Astrogator determine the distance a ship can
jump, I even rate J-drives as 1.5, 2.5, etc drives. These half drives
indicate the equipment is good enough to allow a jump at the next higher
level with success on the "Jump Lock" task by the Astrogator at a higher
level of difficulty.

As you suggest, the shape of jump space doesn\'t have to be completely
uniform or stay consistant over multi-year periods. In my games it isn\'t. 
Every few years you have to update your "Jump Bible" or risk increased
chance of misjumps. If you haven\'t got an up-to-date book, you can waste a
load of injection mass (what laymen call jump fuel ;-) making a sighting,
or take your chances at an increase level of difficulty.

Yes, but is the Sol-Barnard\'s Star differential near the mean or is it a
sport?  Bruce is suggesting the differential is about 50 km/s (I think
that\'s the mean differential he\'s referring to), and other people have
suggested lower mean differentials. 

>Planetary motion for earth could add/subtract 30km/sec worst case from the

For earth, yes.  What about the difference between Regina-2 and Regina-3? 
My players don\'t just travel from mainworld to mainworld, sometimes they
travel between worlds in a system. ;->

I can figure the orbital velocity for the planets when I create the
systems, and I guess I\'ll have to.  It\'s just another calculation for the
program.

Hum, I\'ve seen that this would be everything from trivial to a year-long
exercise. It might be time to just come up with a good for play SWAG.

>Who does these things?  The scouts...when they are not drunk.

Yep, but my players will be going where the Scout Service hasn\'t been in
several thousand years...if ever. ;->

These are acceptable to me (as I use NT4 almost exclusively), but please 
take care what shortcuts are used: some of them flake NT rather nastily

TOTALLY off the subject (since my new zip drive managed to eat the 50MB of 
accumulated TML since last November when I vanished, take my ignorance of 
the jumpwar with a deer lick):

IMO, jump fuel is just that: no blowing bubbles, no matter insertion, no 
jump atmosphere, no silly crap like that.  Since grav technology seems to 
keep pace with jump, it makes much more sense to use a jump drive that is 
1) high speed energy converter, 2) mostly dedicated capacitors, 3) not used 
to do anything but convert pure H into e=mc^2, and then 4) use all that 
energy to create a highly focussed quasi-gravitic field to rip a hole in 
the weak fabric of interplanetary space into j-space, where we can tool 
along in a different quantum level before returning to n-space.

As we ALL know, contrary to archaic 20th Century theory, gravity wells 
STRENGTHEN the fabric of space rather than weaken it, and hence it is 
monumentally more difficult to open a jump-hole into j-space anywhere near 
a massive gravity well.

Any questions?

At one point (in the CT era), the Kforuzeng corsairs
were building a ship that mounted a type-J
meson gun as primary weaponry.

As I don\'t have convenient access to my copies of
High Guard and CT Fighting Ships, could someone
who does give stats for the type-J and check
the size of Imperial vessels that had J-Mesons?

I dont have his design, but I did a TL9 Slow Freighter using FFS2.

The good news is it is a 200 dton freighter that carries 1400 m3 of cargo a
jump 1 for 36.5 megacredits (even cheaper if bought with Imperial credits).
The bad news is it goes at 0.0022 gees, acheiving a velocity of 0.8 km per
second after 10 hours acceleration. It has enough reacton mass to maintain
this acceleration for 50 hours. Total mass is 2206 tons, assuming a full
load of cargo at 1t/m3.

200 dton sphere, stressed for 1 G with 3 cm of Light Cermaic Composites
(28.83m3, 172.98t, MCr 0.26)

2 Small Staterooms (56 m3, 4t, MCr 0.08) - 0.002 MW

1400 m3 cargo (1400 m3, 1400 t)

Note that this ship does not react well to newfangled ideas like having to
match angular velocities with target systems (seriously ... have people
seen what requiring 1 gee for n hours is going to do to TL9 starfaring ?).

If any players inherit one of these from their great great great
grandfather, I would think strongly about selling the GCNTR to a museum and
buying something modern. Like Heplar.

Yeah. Can I use this high-speed energy converter and capacitors to power
other ship systems ? If it just energy, why not ? Converting 280 cubic
meters of H into energy in one hour should allow a *big* battery of fast
firing weapons.

Also, it isnt more difficult to make jump inside a gravity well. It\'s just
more difficult to get out the other side in n pieces, where n is a rational
number.

As someone who makes my (meager) living writing RPG supplements, I thank
you. 

My saga with IG is most interesting.  I first wrote my two articles for
JTAS in June of 1996 (a few months before T4 came out).  I wrote Ken
Whitman about submitting articles to JTAS, he wrote back and I submitted
them, as did my friend an frequent co-author Aaron Link.  I then asked if
my articles had arrived and heard nothing more from Ken Whitman (ever
again).  A few months later I contacted Tim Brown, when I found his name
and number, about working on other projects for Traveller.  When talking
to him he told me about the problems they had experienced with Ken and I
assumed all problems had been solved.  Then, JTAS # 25 came out.  My
friend Aaron\'s article appeared in it.  He received no contract and was
not paid.  After several letters to IG he finally received his check.  He
is one of only two people I know to have been paid by IG, and the other
person had to sue them (see below).  Around this time, Courtney Solomon
mentioned I should resubmit my two articles, since they had likely been
lost. 

I did so, "Contact: Suerrat" was published in JTAS # 26, in May.  I was
never notified about this, I heard about it on this mailing list.  I asked
about contracts and payments was assured they were "in the mail...".  Over
the summer Tim offered me a contract for a book for IG.  Fortunately for
me, I was a bit too busy and Imperial Squadrons wasn\'t my specialty, so I
declined.  I talked to Tim at GenCon 97 and he assured me that I would be
paid soon and that my contract should arrive within "a few days". 

In October, after another round of letters I received a contact in the
mail.  However, it was for my other article, a 8 page scenario, to be
published in JTAS # 27.  In spite of several emails and letters (I\'ve
given up on phone calls) I\'ve heard nothing more from IG since then.  They
now owe me a 20% kill fee for my scenario in addition to my payment for
the article in JTAS # 26.  I expect I\'ll never be paid for either. 

This has happened to me before in my projects, but usually when a company
is too broke or decides to cancel a product a line, not simply because
they decided never to pay me. 

IG are thieves, don\'t give them a dime of you money, and for gods\' sake
don\'t write for them.  From now on, all IG products I buy will be bought
used. 

Either they are about to go under (if they can\'t afford to pay me my $90
they are pretty hard up) or they simply have a policy of not paying
people.  I suspect it\'s the second.  One author (who would likely prefer
to remain nameless) had to sue them because they offered him a contact
with royalties and then decided to lower they royalties after the contact
was signed and the book was on sale (it sold better than they expected and
they simply didn\'t want to pay that much).

This line of thought gets my vote. Just because I move from the city to
the country doesn\'t mean that I have to be forget all the advantages I
had (or thought I had), it only means that I may have to adapt to
earlier technology in order to continue to exist because of lack of
available or easily obtainable product. Such would be the case on a
colonial world (country).

My question is not about the time taken but the distance travelled
particlarily in a mis-jump.
If the length of the jump is determined by the power input, are we then
saying that in a mis-jump, more power was inadvertently applied to
create a longer than maximum jump 6 (if that is what the random role(s)
generate).
Also, how could/would we generate the extra power suggested above, when
tech only allows j6. I can justify the random direction.

Well the sofas of the Rule of Man were presumably Second Empire style. 
:)

Canonical references to furniture styles in Traveller are scarce.  One
of the only ones I am aware of is the following:

"4. Phaeton Suite (Passenger Stateroom):  This luxury suite is
habitually assigned to high passengers.  It is decorated in a stark
post-Civil War style (transparent or translucent materials for
furniture; solid colors for walls and floor)."

CT\'s Adventure 13 Signal GK, page 26 (by Marc Miller, additional design
by J Andrew Keith) discussing the layout of the Ad Astra, a 600 ton,
Type M, Subsidized Liner "a standard design widely available within the
Imperium."

Travellers Digest also had some nice bits of information on furniture in
the article about the Imperial Palace, however there  are not going to
be a lot of Iridium Thrones on most planets so I suspect these bits are
less usefull in most contexts.

Furniture appears in some of the illustrations in Traveller material but
always in a supporting role.  Unfortunately most of the art in Traveller
is of people, spaceships, and guns, but not of furniture, for some odd
reason.

Maybe BITS would do 101 Pieces of Furniture, so we could discover what
furniture of the Third Imperium is really like ?	:)

So we know what the height of fashion circa 650 or 700 was.  The fact
that this style is still used in a suite "habitually assigned to high
passengers" suggests that such styles still have some popularity and/or
implications of social standing in Milieu 1100 (the adventure is set in
1110).  The Third Imperium is a more conservative culture than our own
with a lower rate of technological advancement so it might not be
unreasonable to believe that their Interior Design and Architectural
styles might also be conservative.

Is it legal to only have a robot Engineer?

Absolutely!!!  You use a similar system EVERY TIME you fire your 150Mj 
triple laser turret, just on a smaller scale: same technology included at 
NO extra cost.  No reason not to use up all of your jump fuel...  (Jump 
drives are just optimized to discharge through a different system, and 
isolated from the rest of the ship\'s systems "just in case," but should 
you, with your manly Engineering-5, want to re-wire the ship, who am I to 
stop you?  The other players on the other hand may take a dim view of 
becoming the next members of the Bundy family...)

My next question, dear player, is now that you\'ve blasted two out of three 
bogies rather handily with all that extra juice, assuming that you don\'t 
yet resemble the Colonel\'s extra crispy, and drained all of your jump fuel 
(assuming you had the foresight - aren\'t psionics wonderful? - to begin 
running the thing up a couple of hours in advance of the firefight to 
charge the capacitors - it\'s not instantaneous, you know), where in 
Grandfather\'s name are you going to run to?

No jump, no peace.  Heh.

I don\'t see this as necessarily contradictory...  The end result is the 
same: don\'t jump near Jupiter!  Opinions vary, even on the current 
postulate of quantum teleportation (another explanation for jump?).  As 
long as the perceivable end result are identical in games terms, I care 
even less than Nietzsche...

There _is_ a product called SafeSkins, which are clear plastic overlays
for keybords. We used them in the lab to keep various liquids out of the
keyboards; I see no reason they wouldn\'t work for various potables.

A bent piece of lexan works for monitors.

You know, I\'d better set myself up as a distributor...either for that
stuff or keyboards and monitors...what with the variety of stuff spraying
onto systems around here, I\'ll bet that collectively we\'re going through a
bunch of keyboards and monitors every week;-)

We\'ve got to be carefully about this. The K\'Kree alien module describes the
ships as enormous saucer-like things... have you seen \'Independence Day\',
and was that an atmospheric PA in action?

Not to mention they have nuclear dampers.

But that means all we need is a souped up Mac Powerbook and Jeff Goldblum
to win the Jihad ;-)

And if we do that you can export cooked K\'Kree..

PS

At EuroGenCon we ran a tournament scenario called \'White Dwarf\' which
involved an AHL class cruiser called the \'Tactical Withdrawl\' (with a crew
of 6 thanks to high automation ;-) ), several famous characters (Captain
Jane, Rimmer, the Cat, Felix, Hayes....) and a mission which involved
setting up a McBurger franchise on a K\'Kree world.. bit of a scream that
was.

up (as breif as possible) of how I operate Jump drives in My Campaign (tm).
It is NOT meant to reflect canon (other than in my own campaign universe)
nor is it represented as The Only True Way. It is merely for informational
purposes, in the event that anyone sees an idea or 2 that they wish to
incorperate in their own campaign, please feel free. It Does Not attempt to
explain WHY Jump works, but, merely, the mechanics I use during game play.

Please keep in mind that I use the TASK SYSTEM FROM THE TRAVELLER REF SCREEN

1) The Jump Navigator, in conjunction with the Sensor Operator, determines
an entry point thet has a direct, unobscured, route to the Target Star.

a)   Unobscured means that there is, along the direct route, no Gravity Well
GREATER than the ship itself within 10 diameters (of the intruding gravity
well), and preferably within 100 diameters ( of the intruding gravity well).

b)   Each intruding gravity well within 100 dia. ( a determination of the
Ref at the time the checks are made)adds a plus one to the chance of a
misjump.

c) An intruding gravity well within 10 dia. will cause the ship to
percipitate out of Jump at that point, the ship\'s Jump fuel will have been
used to enter jump and will be gone.
Notes: All of this is determined by a series of Navigation and Sensor Ops
Task Rolls:

Navigation Task Roll to Determine Jump Route: (Uncertain Task (1D)) (time
variable)
(Intelligence+Navigation) - Computer Rating < System Information(*)

(*) System Information  Difficulty
Assume a STAGGERING (4D) difficulty modified as follows:
- - 1D for Scout Service Info package
- - 1D for successful Sensor Ops Roll (see below)
+ 1D for failed Sensor Ops Roll (see below)
- - 1D if previously visited Start System

Sensor Op Task Roll the Scan Jump Route: (Uncertain Task (1D)) (time
variable)
(Education+Sensors) +/- Sensor Rating DM(*) < System Information

Sensor Rating DM :

Sensor Rating                      DM
1-2                                          +2
3-4                                          +1
5-6                                           0
7-8                                          -1
9-10                                        -2
11-12                                      -3
13-14                                      -4
15-16                                      -5

Ref sets the time spent for each task. Players can re-rol as many times as
they like, spending the appropriate amount of time. (Note2: I usually have a
Captain start to get figety if a Navigator or Sensor Ops re-rolls TOO many
times, the competence level of the PC comes into question).

2) Since stars do not really sit in the exact center of a "hex", dispite
mapping conventions, it is possible to "pass" through an "occupied" map hex.

a) Optional: For each occupied hex passed through, the Ref can roll for the
possibity of a mis-Jump.

3) Objects in the target system may cause the ship to percipitate from Jump
early.

a) If the object is greater than that of the ship.

b) If the object is within 10 dia. (it\'s size) of the course of the ship.

Note: I usually handle this as a Refs option and haven\'t written any random
rules yet.

3) Objects with a smaller gravity well than the ship are simply "blown"
aside by the shockwave of the ship\'s exit from Jump.

4) Running Jumps

a) All of the above applies, additionally...

b) The ship must be running in the general direction of the intended Jump.

c) It will exit travelling in the general direction of the inner system of
the target star.Picture a cone starting at the exit point with the target
star at it\'s center.

d) If a shi percipitates out early due to an obstruction The object will be
within a cone in FRONT of the ship measureing 10 dia. (of the object) "out"
from the point of entry and 20 dia. across, at it\'s widest point.

Note: roll a D6 2-4 indecated above, below, left or right of the ships
course, a 1 or 6 indecate it\'s directly on the ship\'s heading.

e) The ship will retain the same velocity as it entered Jump.

Obviously these are not complete rules. I use them as guide lines with a
liberal amount of "Ref\'s Option" thrown in to create the amount of
excitement I want at that time.

System Data is valuable in My Campaign(tm), the more the better. I auction
off IISS data packs at various times and locations, containing newly
discovered system information to Traders and Corperations. These packs also
contain information on the contents of the system.

It\'s also why Scouts and Freetraders are concidered a bit on the crazy side,
in my games. Company men tend to stick to the safe, mapped systems.

Freetraders are encouraged to register their system data with the IISS. This
is usually in the form of credits or, if the data is on a totally unexplored
system, the Traders can "lay a claim" to the data. This will keep it form
the public domain for a period set by the Trader in question, up to 2 years.
The information will be available to the IISS and the ISN. I see this as a
way of "leveling the playing feild" between the Freetraders and the Corps. A
rich trading world found and registered in this way is a Freetrader\'s dream.
Either from the profits of their own trade or byt sale of the informtion to
one of the Corps.

Any way, there it is, sorry for the length of the post. I hope somebody sees
something useful in their own
campaigns.

Well, yes and no. Yes, a gravity well is a gravity well is a gravity well, but 
canonically it\'s only end conditions that have been considered - it matters if 
you\'re in a well when you go in, or come out, but j/space "goes around" 
anything along the way.

Let\'s say there are three systems:

A - B - C

A ship jumps from A to C, spending 7 days in jump. What happens about system 
B? Do you appear there instead? Do you have to \'dodge\' it in j/space (another 
Astrogation roll)? If so, when? Is a jump from A-B, or B-C, easier than A-C 
(it should be)? Is jump to a system you know little about harder (it should 
be)?

Could you communicate with a ship in jumpspace, or force it to leave where you 
wanted it to (pirates?) with artificial gravity?

As a straight SF idea, I have no problem with this idea, but IMHO it ain\'t 
Traveller.

    'body' => '>> 3)	The capacitors of a jump drive held a comparatively small charge

  The charge held by the Jump drives integral capacitors is either too
large or too small, depending on what you\'re comparing it to.

  Compared to standard capacitors used in other equipment (vehicles,
weapons, robots) the stored energy densities are vastly too high, and
costs are ridiculously low.

 - per J-drive value, 0.5% of the ship is capacitors. E.G., 100 DT Scout
(J-2), has 1 Dt caps built-in.

 - at turn length of 1200 seconds, output 250 MW per EP, the storage of
36 EP\'s equals 10.8 million (1.08 x 10^7) MW/seconds. 

 - 1 Dt of batteries is 14000 litres; batteries range from 2.25 to 25
MW/s per litre (TL\'s 9-15; Striker).

 - 1 Dt of J-drive is 4 MCr, or Cr 285/litre if non-battery component
is free. TL 9-15 batteries cost Cr 375 to 10000 per litre.

  OTOH, If this is being compared to the fusion energy in the jump
"fuel" (10 Dt for the type S), then the J-capacitor has effectively
zero energy storage ability, relative to the product of fusing all
that LHyd. One ton of LHyd (in proton-proton fusion) produces about
6 x 10^11 MW/s of power, or 1.2 x 10^13 for that Scout doing a J-2.
This means about a half-million more Dt\'s of storage for the type S.

  Calculations are correct, hopefully?

  As per all rules from CT, with the possible exception of the _Adventure_
(not rules book) Annic Nova. Specified in High Guard.

  Interestingly, short of channelling incoming damage into your black
globe (or your outgoing rocket engine into it for 100% power generating
efficiency!) there\'s no way to use your Jump-drive "reactor" version to
bootstrap itself into providing power to run itself. So, no Power Plant
operating to run Jump-drive means you can\'t use the presumed super Jump
reactor. However, it could require a certain power flow to run, and use
LHyd (why only LHyd?) as coolant.

  To avoid technological side effects, it would be best to assume that
both the super-capacitors and the super reactors are artifacts of the
early game design, and whose logical conclusions were not foreseen at
the time. Normal power plants can\'t fill those batteries very fast -
18 turns for a Scout doing a J-2, rather than the canonical one turn.

  Someone suggested a while ago that Annic Nova was canonical in their
campaign for possessing an artifact (artificial or natural) that gave
it the necessary "jump-mass". This could also explain some Ancients
jump-drives (as could small pocket universes full of L-Hyd - these may
very well not count against the 10% Jump entry mass). Very neat idea.

He received no contract and was not paid.

I realize that it is common practice to send manuscripts to publishers "on
spec", but how can they print them without a signed contract?  Until the
author signs a contract, doesn\'t he still own the copywrite, wouldn\'t
publishing without a signed contract be a direct violation of law? 
Wouldn\'t it be both a civil and criminal offense?

I\'ve had my say about this subject in the past, and won\'t rehash things,
but I find it interesting that those who use Windows 95/NT prefer that
programs be designed exclusively for, and work only on, their operating
systems.  That may not be *your* conscious goal, but I strongly suspect it
is MicroSoft\'s, and it would be the effect if you have your way. 

There are techniques and programming languages that allow, even make for
easy, cross-platform compatibility.  Just as I see "no one true path" to
Traveller, I don\'t recognize and "illuminated" operating system. Choice,
ladies and gentlemen, provide for personal choice.

Go the exclusive Win95/NT route and I won\'t/can\'t *run* it, but it won\'t
make me cry. As per Pink Floyd, "it\'s just another brick in the wall."

Ob Traveller, I think I see why Marc and many of our Traveller compatriots
are comfortable with the oligarcy that is the Imperium. They appear to
support virtual, if not de facto, monopolies in the real world.  And M0\'s
"Expansion Process" *does* like the business plan for a certain

- ----> Well, I\'m not too sure it was "left out" as in 1st ed T2000, each
shot represented approx 3 real bullets being fired, which is why the ammo
#\'s of those guns look so weird. In 2nd ed, they went with an actual 1 to 1
ratio. If this change works for you however, don\'t let this stop you. Also,
is it really a problem that your characters are too resistant to damage? I
know pistols aren\'t too threatening under these rules, but with all the
autofire flying around, it usually doesn\'t take too long to get hurt. There
are the various aimed shots and things to use as well. Don\'t know, just that
my group played a long 1st ed, a long 2nd ed, and a moderate amount of TNE
and I never thought they were too tough. The instant kill rules for NPC\'s
also made them pretty frangible too.

  So what? At least it simplifies delivering high V projectiles to the
target, as you can now specifically get your run-up before jumping. A

Actually, the normal stars are "Population I" (they were named before
anyone understood the order of formation.)

I\'m pretty sure that the sun\'s velocity relative to the local standard
of rest (a hypothetical average going around the galaxy) is on the
order of 50 km/s. This might be somewhat higher than average, but not
too much. So star velocities should be distributed around zero with
a variance of (say) 30km/s.
I\'m writing at home so I can\'t look this up, but
it jibes with my memory of the average motion of my favourite star
cluster, the Hyades (motion in the plane of the sky is 0.1 arcsec
per year at 50 parsecs = 25 km/s; radial velocity is of the same order.)
You can certainly make the average velocity of stars zero (and probably
should), measuring it with respect to the LSR; if you want to measure
with respect to the center of the galaxy the average is about 500 km/s,
with a variance of 50 km/s.

Probably not true, unless they\'re part of a cluster - most stars 
have drifted far away from the ones they formed with.

Something I forgot about is that while it\'s easy to measure the
motion towards or away from you (through doppler shifts) measuring 
the motion in the plane of the sky (proper motion) is harder - 
though not impossible for nearby stars with big science-grade sensors.
Maybe make it Formidable for non-science sensors, +1 DM for sensors
below PEMS-13.

>Now, about Task duration...30 minutes sound about right?
Make it a couple of hours , I think - with a decent-sized sensor
(resolution of a few milliarcsecond, astrometric accuracy a few 
microarcseconds) you still need a couple of hours to measure the
proper motion.

It\'s the second sighting that nails it. If you move back-and-forth over
1/10 AU inside a single system to get a baseline you get a distance
error to the target system about 20 AU for a PEMS-14ish sensor.

If you sight from two different stars, the error goes down to about
a few thousand kilometers. More sightings are irrelevant.

On the average (depends on where in the star\'s orbit it is.) Almost
all these velocities are negligible for Traveller ships, of course - 
1 hour at 1 G is 36 km/s. One can recognize evidence of Eris\'
Stutterwarp Heresy that he even asks these questions - the Inquisition
will be along shortly.

(Though it\'s an interesting issue for 2300 AD ships with stutterwarp
but low delta-V - they have to make up the velocity difference through
clever maneuvering around gravity wells, which is probably fairly
time-consuming.)

options to include in a SCHOOL PROJECT (caps for emphisis). As such, and if
his intentions are to find employment in the computer field IN TODAYS MARKET
PLACE, he should probably use either Win95 or NT as the platform for which
to write the program. Let\'s face it in the Real World (tm) this is the
Dominate platforms (no matter what we would like it to be). As a School
Project, I feel it is a disservice to the gentleman in question to urge him
to use a platform that is not in current, widespread commercial and
industrial use, as a learning tool.

On the side of personal preference... My favorite was always the Atari ST
system, but work and a sever lack of support forced me into the IBM PC,
first in DOS then Win3.x and now into Win95/NT.  My programing skills (alas
long unused) were in Atari GWBasic then in Turbo Pascal on the PC. Now I,
barely scrape by with some rather crude Excel spread sheet work, so I would
PREFER he write the program for another system, but if he is attempting to
learn skills valid for todays market place he should go with the Evil Empire
and the latest version of that (even though it will, with Emporer Gates I
marketing approach, be outdated by the time he leaves school).

Obviously other systems are still in use, but he will most likely be
applying for a job using some version of Win95/NT, if todays market is any
indecation, and a project written for either of these formats will have the
most value to HIM. It not a matter of supporting MS\'s monopoly by choioce,
but learning Basket Weaving 101 in an attempt to get a job in Astrophysics
just isn\'t the best route to a goal.

The only problem with this is that the motion of stars relative to
each other is a vector quantity with three values: x, y, and z.  This
makes a huge difference since two stars moving at the same speed in
opposite directions, have a relative speed twice their speed.  This
is a problem no matter what you use as your reference point.

Cumbersome system - as I indicated in a few private notes, and distracting 
if you\'re anal retentive about accurate depictions of the target - like me. 
 2nd ed. Millenium\'s End has been out with quite a few supplements for 
awhile besides UF, but they\'re production schedule is *worse* than IG\'s 
(yes, it\'s true).  But maybe I\'m bitter - the publisher and I had serious 
differences in style and content about the 2nd ed. of the operatives 
handbook, and we mutually tore up our working contract a year ago: after 
two years of correspondence and work.  *big sigh*  Hence, there is still no 
2nd ed. of the handbook for Millennium\'s End.  If there ever is, and any of 
my stuff\'s in it, I flame him in court, and Texas courts are *very* lenient 
in deceptive trade practices suits.  Needless to say, I\'m very sympathetic 
with you adventurous T4 writers.  Wish there were something that I could do 
to help out.  How much antimatter would cause SoCal to...?  Just kidding,

    'body' => 'First off, I\'d like to congratulate Brian Songy on his winning design, the
_Kah Ryn\'soo_ subsidized merchant.  Nice work!  I\'d also like to thank the
judges for choosing my ship as the second place winner overall and to tie
for first in the "Usability" category.  I\'m glad you liked it.

I initially decided that a subsidized merchant should be designed for the
route it serves, and encouraged by the THUDDD-8 specification, I looked at
the economics of hauling speculative goods on the route.  As it turns out,
some worlds are cheap sources of goods in demand everywhere (Khula, Vland)
and some are expensive sources of goods few want (Uushiish Uun).  Worse, 
the worlds like Uushiish Uun don\'t even generate much freight traffic.  So
much of the time the ship will be either fairly full or quite empty.

So I looked at the route.  It turned out that besides the two jump-2 loops
mentioned in the specification, there was also a jump-3 circuit which 
connected all six worlds before returning to the point of origin.  It also
had the great advantage of allowing an extremely profitable run from Khula
to Tauri.  Furthermore, all six worlds were still visited.  Instead of
skipping worlds altogether, the jump-3 drive allowed me to visit them in
a different order.  I also realized that most competition ships would use
the minimum of jump-2, and in the interest of a little variety and being
a bit different, I went with the jump-3 drive.

After that, everything else came together.  I used QSDS because I hate the
endless pointless noodling with numbers the other design systems have; why
should making a hull be so hard?  I only used "bighulls.txt" because the
final design was a bit over a ton short of room, and using a tech-12 hull
fixed that problem.  At least one laser was required since I wanted to
carry mail; two were better, and I figured people could rearrange type of
weapon to match their own tastes.  A ship\'s vehicle was important for role
playing purposes.  My main indulgence was in the military-grade computer
system.  In TNE, particle accelerator hits on non-fibre optic computers
caused a computer System Reset, essentially disabling the ship.  By using
military-grade computers, the intent was to harden the ship against this 
sort of attack.  Otherwise, everything was kept stripped down, since the
use of a jump-3 drive meant the loss of about 55 tons of cargo room.

The one minor mistake I made was in not keeping the ship\'s operating fund 
and ship\'s speculative trading funds separate in the economic analysis.  
The corrected figures follow.  

REVISED ECONOMIC ANALYSIS:  (Courtesy of Zirunkariish)

Revenues are calculated based on average selling price for cargo, and
the assumption that no passengers or cargo will be carried from any of
Tauri, Guuiish, and Uushiish Uun.  Brokers are utilized, but kickbacks
are not offered.  The ship waits a week in each system, whether or not 
it will probably leave empty.  Maintenance services can be provided on 
Khula.  Some costs assume 48 weeks regular operation; the assumption 
is that the IN pays some expenses while the ship is in their service, 
or that the ship is idle for two extra weeks.

The ship\'s operating fund is kept separate from the captain\'s fund for
speculative trading in this analysis.

I\'m not a lawyer, but I\'ve always thought this was true.  Does anyone else

My contract for Strike! specifies that I will be paid within thirty days of
publication.  When did JTAS #26 come out?

According to my Father-in-law, who is a lawyer, I own Strike! and could sue
them for damages.

This reminds me of a great story.

During WWII, when the Ameicans began bombing the Japanese home islands with
the high-flying B-29 Super Fortress, crews were amazed when their ground
speed plummeted to zero at certain altitudes, then shot back up when the
crew climbed or dived as little as 200 ft.  Coming back from Japan, an
equally odd effect was observed, where the plane would accelerate far
beyond what was expected for the amount of thrust.

It wasn\'t until the end of the war that a meteroligist figured out what was
going on.  The pilots had discovered the jetstream, the constant "river" of
wind that wraps around the globe at high altitude.

Perhaps something similar is taking place when a ship jumps with bad fuel,
or inside a gravity well, or with poorly maintained engines.

Not true. He said that it uses DPMI. Which means that the program uses
the DPMI API to *request* the 32bit resources. DPMI support *is*
available in things like Windows and OS/2. Either as an add-on or as
part of the OS (I don\'t deal with that sort of thing often enough to be
sure which).

Excuse me? Screen print has been possible from the very beginning. If
all else fails, there\'s this program called GRAPHICS.COM that comes
with DOS. 

And programs can do their own screen printing. 

And I\'ve got 256 color apps that run under DOS.

From the "Traveller Adventure".  The Vargr were stealing two "J" meson guns

When you do something "on spec,"  you generally give up whatever rights you
had in the first place.  If they use it, and don\'t pay you, you could sue
them, but your chances of winning are going to depend on the jury more than
anything else.  Its possible but its a crap shoot.  Its the common law
doctrine of misappropriation, that is frowned upon my many courts, but some
still support.  This is why most publishers and especially tv/film producers
will not look at anything you send.

Not necessarily, see above.  You do have the copyright but you can give it
away, contract or no contract.

>  Wouldn\'t it be both a civil and criminal offense?

Civil action for copyright infringement, yes.Criminal, perhaps.  But the value
has to be in excess of $1000 US (in the US anyway).

I\'m a law student who has studied copyright in depth.
I urge you to check out http://www.lawgirl.com/  (she is a hollywood
entertainment/copyright lawyer).  or http://www.copyright.com/  (might be

If it was once thought to be in *our technology*, then in a whole galaxy

That is what I would like as well. However, if it is frowned upon by the

Yes, you could.  But that would be a pain in the arse because of the lawyer and
filing fees.  As well as the delay.  What you could do, is publish/release
Strike! yourself.  Its your copyright.  They breached the contract.  Its yours
to do with what you wish.  Sell it at dougberry.com or give it away.

True, and you can screen print to the clipboard, paste into Paint and
manipulate it to your heart\'s content. I do it all the time.

Also true, or use utilities. Heck, Galactic added screen printing to its
last version and it\'s about as DOS as you can get.

>And I\'ve got 256 color apps that run under DOS.

Sure, and virtually all of those apps can also run in Windows, OS/2 and be
emulated by the Mac and various *nixs. It\'s possible to write a DOS program
that won\'t run in Windows, but well-behaved programs work fine.

Ah heck, this isn\'t worth arguing about, is it?  Chris has already said
what he *intends* to do, so we should back off on the arguments and just
support him as best we can.

"Cannibalism" generally refers to the eating of members of ones *own*
species. For example, the word is used in describing species of fish
that eat their own young.

We don\'t *have* a term for "eating a member of another intelligent
species".

It\'s unuusual for a Darwin Award to *not* be awarded posthumously!

High.

At least the odds are higher than you might expect.  They always are.  
What are the odds of two airplanes colliding in the sky or two ships
colliding at sea?  Both are operating in expansive media, constrained 
to optimized flight routes that will ingress to certain high traffic
zones. 
Yet collisions happen with alarming frequency.  

Why?  Because traffic lanes are crowded.  Candidate jump precipitation 
points are not all created equally.  Narrow cones of courses will exist 
in which ingressing ships will not have to maneuver excessively to make 
planetfall (Due to relative velocities between sytstems and worlds, as
Marc has pointed out).  The probability of interaction  will increase 
inversely with the distance to the objective.

Deconfliction is a necessity and cannot be left to chance.  Murphy
has seen to that.

This is what I was looking for. I need a way to get across the void
from  the Marches or Trojan Reach to say Gushemege or Verge or Llelish
without going around the claw. Do you think it is possible to have a
mis-jump go that far or is there such a thing as a worm hole that would
be OK in the Traveller world. I want my party to go from some known
area  and star charts to a totally unfamiliar area, where they have to
figure their way back (or around or whatever). I plan to use it to take
them from CT to TNE and T4 worlds and problems.

The "cultured yeast" bit is *way* out of date. Check out the *current*
reseaerch for long duration missions, and the Space Station. They\'ll
have a variety of foods, maybe a bit light on the larger meat critters.

Beef, pork, and other meat animals not suited to close quarters and
fish not suited to small ponds would all be good products to import.
Ditto for tree products that require *large* or *old* trees.

And new varieties of small plants, animals and fish would be good
"one-time" imports. Picture the profit for introducing something like
raspberries. 

BTW, smuggling any agricultural products past quarantine on such a
world would get you in *big* trouble. They don\'t want any pests
introduced by accident. Here on earth folks get upset enough about the
possibility of destroying cash crops. Think how upset they\'ll get when
it\'s the *life support* system at stake. :-)

Well, after about a dozen e-mails to both Tim Brown, "sales@imperiumgames.com"
and the main IG address, a few faxes and a few exchanged phone messages, I
have finally gotten both "Emperor\'s Vehicles" and "Naval Architect\'s Manual"
in exchange for my JTAS subscription and the failed "Citizens" product. 

Sorry to say, but this has utterly soured me on IG as a company. I will
definately not be ordering directly from them anymore. This includes T4.1,
whenever that comes out. I was looking forward to buying a autographed
"deluxe" edition, but after all the hoops I had to jump through to fill my
orders for "EV" and "NAM", it\'s just easier to buy at the store or even to
wait for copies to go on sale second hand!

Now there may be stars higher or lower than this, but not much greater

highest local be it 140km/s or 78km/s.  Its still 4 hours burn at most,
and that can easily be sone prior to jump for zero relative on
precipitation or even keep some relative in to zero burn orbit with.

As for needing to spend a lot of time to calculate jump and relative v,
a mistake could be tragic.  ex 4.3 yr x 15km/s is a hell of a lot of
space.  Still probably not that mush for Trav drives though.  Just don\'t
get the ACentauri with empty tanks:)

(I\'d have to run some numbers and I\'m too lazy tonight, but I think it
is a minor problem over short jumps.)

There\'s a *big* problem. most planets and other bodies are *moving*.
That means that there are going to be cases where they *might* be in
the way, depending on *when* the ship "goes thru" that area.

This *rapidly* gets out of hand. If you run into something "halfway",
does that mean that you drop out of jump after only 3.5 days? If the
jump takes the full week +/- then the body *won\'t* be in the way. 

I think Marc needs to reconsider this. 

I can see getting "kicked back" to the 100 diameter limit if your
emergence point would be inside. That can be a matter of the gravity
well "pushing" on the *exit point*. 

But if you can get affected in mid jump it just gets *too* weird, or at
least requires *way* to much figuring.

Admitedly very small, but it only takes ONE booboo in the 1100 years of
the Empire and the whole Imperium is calling for the TrafCon officer who
thought up the deconfliction plan to be hanged, tried and put on
Heraldo.

This is the way things really work in real ARTCC, and close calls are
nearly as bad.  One guy gets fried and the rest implement CYA.

Things probably worked like that for 100-200 years, then something
happend.  This would only be a player in core systems, with the fringw
wondering what the fuss was about(low traffic count.)

As a (possibly humorous) aside...I had one combat I ran where the PCs where in

    'body' => 'Hello Folks,
  Maybe someone on the list can help me with the following:

  I got a hold of a formula that states the following:

Vesc = (Density of planet x Radius of planet^2)^.5 in Earth escape
velocity units.  Thus, escape velocity calculated to equal 1.3 using this
above system, would be equal to 6.9 x 1.3 miles per second (or rougly 8.97
miles per second).

  When I used the next portion of the formula, it indicates that in order
to determine if a planet is a gas giant or not, it must have an "S" value
(why they chose the letter S, I will never know) of greater than 2.40.

  The the second half of this formula is:

S = V^2*R/L   where V is escape velocity in Earth units, R is disance in
Au\'s and L is luminosity in Earth Sol units.

  In any event, I noticed something interesting.  The values for given in
OTHER SUNS match those values in TRAVELLER 2300 AD.  The only real
difference however, is that the values given in OTHER SUNS depend upon the
luminosity as well as the distance from the sun, whereas it appears that
TRAVELLER 2300 AD relies upon just density and diameter (perhaps a default
of 1 AU and 1 Luminosity is assumed?).

  Theory behind the formulas: it is my understanding that escape velocity
of gases (and thus Gas retained) depends upon the temperature the gases
are heated to, and the gravity well the gases are in.  Since temperature
depends upon the luminosity of the sun as well as the distance, the second
stage formula looks ok to me.  Here is the kicker though... any planets
of approximately the correct density (earth norm of roughly 5.5 grams per
cubic centimeter) result in Gas Giants if their diameters are are more
than 1.55 times that of earth.

  Thus planets with a diameter of 12,400 plus miles will turn into Gas
Giants via the formulas above that I mentioned (assuming an earth normal
Luminosity at 1 AU distance).  Such a planet with a density of roughly 5.5
grams per cubic centimeter will have a gravity at tops of roughly 1.5
g\'s...

  Can anyone tell me if I should be junking this formula or not, or should
I accept it as being reasonably accurate, and take it from there?  These
are the same people that are using the formula of 

Temperature = (295 x((L/R^2)^(.25)) in degrees Kelvin.  This jives with
GURPS SPACE as saying that the Average Earth normal temperature is about
80 degrees at 30th Parallel.

  Well, enough musings for the night I guess...

I don\'t mind this wrinkle, but, it will complicate the sector generation

I haven\'t gotten anything in exchange for JTAS or Citizens yet, but I
haven\'t been pressing them.  I figured they probably have enough troubles
right now, so  I\'d leave them alone, and just see how long (or if) they
contact, or send me anything. Eventually, I\'ll get tired of waiting and

    'body' => 'Sofas, hum, I\'ve not done anything on interior decorating. I did post an
article about the return of the skirt to the Solomani fashion awhile back.
Give me a day or so and I\'ll knock up a brief essay on the subject.

Meanwhile I\'ll repost my article on the skirt:

  ***The reintroduction of the skirt in the Old Earth Union***

During the later years of the Interstellar Wars and the Rule of Man, the
skirt and dress entirely disappeared, replaced by the ubiquitous unisex
jumpsuit or slacks and shirt combination which came to dominate fashion
throughout the Rim during the Long Night. Many reasons have been advanced for
this; the final achievement of equality between the genders, the abandonment
of luxury under the pressure of the Vilani threat, the lack of practicality
of the dress or skirt in space etc. None of these reasons hold up to close
scrutiny, but it remains that for some reason over a 200 year period the
dress and skirt vanished from humaniti\'s collective wardrobe, not to return
for some 2000 years.

Naturally after so long an absence, the return of the skirt has been marked
by controversy and scandal. The first inkling of the return can be found in
Yokio Verruchi\'s summer collection introduced on Terra in 4537AD (year 18
under Imperial reckoning). Her use of a colourful short breach clout [a very
short apron like accessory] over a traditional shirt/trouser combination
created a storm of comment at the time. Most orthodox designers condemned it
as a pointless fad, but next season many young and up and coming designers
had worked the breach clout into their offerings; and they were to been seen
on many daring socialites of both genders.

The next major development came in 4544AD (25 Imperial). Over the intervening
years the breach clout had been gradually achieving more acceptance, having
become almost respectable in certain circles. However the entire Old Earth
Union was scandalised when Ulongo M\'bow took the basic breach clout and
turned it into a complete wraparound. Many commentators where shocked by this
development, claiming it drew far too much attention to the hips and
buttocks. Several major retail chains refused to carry any of M\'bow\'s designs
as a result. However it did catch on with a minority of the young and the
scandal may have actually aided it\'s acceptance in certain circles; it is
interesting to note that Hine Gordon (founder of the Hellfire Movement) was
seen wearing a wraparound on a number of occasions before her death. However
despite this, the wraparound remained an item only worn by the daring for at
least a decade.

The next stage was slow in coming and notable for being far more widely
adopted by women than men. In 4557AD (38 Imperial) Yokio Verruchi took what
now appears the minor step of transforming the wraparound into a short
overskirt (still worn as an accessory over trousers or a jumpsuit). Even
though this was on the surface a very minor innovation, it caused a greater
scandal than M\'bow\'s introduction of the wraparound. Most of the fashion
establishment was aghast at Verruchi\'s 57 winter collection. Compared with
the soft lines of the wraparound, the overskirt\'s hard lines were regarded
as altogether too provocative. Even amongst the \'smart set\' in which the
wraparound was now widely accepted (if still considered daring), the
overskirt was very slow in being adopted. However Verruchi persevered with
it. In her 58 summer collection, she lengthened the overskirt and added a
soft flowing flounce [attachment at the back, vaguely similar in effect to a
bustle] with a light fabric cascade.

Over the next few years Verruchi\'s designs where characterised by the both
the developing overskirt and the flounce (added to both wraparounds and more
conventional trousers and jumpsuits). Slowly Verruchi\'s overskirt and flounce
were taken up by other designers; and while they have yet to achieve even
the limited social acceptance of the wraparound, they are both now well
established as independent fashion trends. As previously noted, the overskirt
was not widely adopted in men\'s fashions until well into the 4560\'s, though
the flounce was taken up far sooner. whilst the flounce is now as common in
men\'s garments as in women\'s; the overskirt remains predominantly a female
fashion item.

This situation remained relatively static for the next nine years or so.
However over this period there was a slow trend for the overskirt to
lengthen (going from just below the hip in Verruchi\'s initial offering, to
just below the knee in Adam Frazers 65 summer collection). However the entire
fashion industry was taken aback in 4566AD (47 Imperial) when Jane Husaski
unveiled her summer collection. In this she took the overskirt; lengthened it
to mid calf, and made it an independent garment; doing away with the trousers
or jumpsuit entirely. The resulting uproar made the scandals surrounding the
wraparound and overskirt seem positively tame by comparison. Claims that she
was perverting public morals were leveled at Husaski; and one socialite was
even charged and convicted of lewd and indecent behavior for wearing one of
Husaski\'s creations to a diplomatic function. Numerous politicians called
for such lascivious clothing to be banned and many social commentators
decried it as a sign of imminent social collapse. Many are still outraged by
those wearing a skirt as a solo garment.

Naturally, this almost universal condemnation by \'the establishment\' lead to
cautious popularity amongst the young. Many daring young men and women were
soon to be seen wearing shirt and skirt combinations without the benefit of
trousers (clothing sure to get one barred in respectable restaurants). The
situation was further confused in 4571AD (53 Imperial) when a year before her
death Verruchi combined the overskirt with the shirt to produce a high thigh
length overdress to be worn with trousers (another development decried in
polite society).

The conversion of 280 cubic meters (10 tons) of LHyd results in an energy
output of over 23,000 times that of our sun!  Even if streached out over an
hour, that\'s still over 6 1/3 times the output of the sun.  Think about it.

I would also think that capitalism/greed would have various corporate
entities competing to produce these things.  Any number of scientific
advances can occur when backed by corporate entities and competition.  
Not unlike plastics research over the years.

This sounds like a good hook for scientists.  Determine the exact impurities
that will give the same results each time.

Of course, they never would.  If they did, it wouldn\'t be Traveller any
more.

Then after they found the proper fuel mixture, they would then have to
figure out how to control the direction...

Someone has suggested sophonophagism.  That sounds like as good a name as
any for the eating of a sapient species.  Of course if you murdered them
first, then there would be an additional charge of sophontocide.

If faced with such a prospect, I would get a .1 G Bussard ram jet added to
my ship.  Then I would go for it.  If you misjump, then at least you could
accelerate to 3,000 km/s and scoop your fuel from the surrounding space.
Come to think of it, you could accelerate to ram speed and just make normal
jumps.  It would still be shorter than going around the claw.

I think we need to agree on terminology here. I think "jump bubble" is
being used for two different concepts. One is the bubble of normal space
created by the jump grid and maintained (presumably) by the power plant.
This is the \'jump bubble\' that has been used for many years. The other is
the comparatively new idea about a small bubble in jump space created to
allow the ship to slip into jumpspace. I propose that we start calling
this an \'access bubble\' or \'access space\'.

Anyway, assuming you mean that it can\'t be used to create an access bubble,
why do you think that? The whole point of the idea is that you have to use
the fuel before the ship can enter jumpspace.
 
>>3)	The capacitors of a jump drive held a comparatively small charge
> 
>I haven\'t seen enough to be convinced on this...

Just work out the size of a jump capacitor and the number of energy points
that can be stored in them before they explode. Then work out how many EPs
a power plant produces in four weeks using 1Pn% of fuel and compare it
with the number of EPs you can produce in 40 minutes using 10Jn% of fuel.

Oh, I\'ll grant you that if this was the only objection to the "a jump
drive is just a super-efficient/super-inefficient fusion plant"
explanation, then I\'d be the first to advocate just forgetting about
this sentence. I just think that an explanation that also takes this
into account is better than one that dosen\'t. Especially since allowing
the energy to be supplied from outside opens up so many more problems
(Like why does any ship on a commercial route ever use internal fuel
tanks?)

>As I said in a previous message, I think it is a long way from being 
>established and that sentence conflicts with other comments which

I never claimed that the "access mass" explanation didn\'t contradict
numerous statements made here and there. I just claim that it explains
the odd features of a jump drive better than any other explanation I\'ve
seen. To use a concept someone else suggested a few days ago, while it
contradicts canon, it agrees with Canon.

Quite right. Better not to say that too loud, though. It opens up an
entirely new can of worms. Why DO ships carry their power plant hydrogen
as LHyd instead of as, say, water? It dosen\'t really make much sense,
does it? Not as long as you assume that volume is the prime constraint
on starship design.

Oh, I agree that it would be better if nothing needed to be explained
away. I just don\'t agree that it is less artificial to explain away all
the oddities of the traditional explanation than it is to explain away
a small etymological oddity. 

>Sure this can be done, but it leaves things that much harder to accept.

Harder than to accept that a jump-drive type power plant wouldn\'t improve
in efficiency from TL 9 to TL 15? Harder than to explain why such a power
plant is completely useless for any other application? Harder than to
explain why jump drive capacitors are so different from capacitors used
in any other field?

>That is why I prefer to stick with things closer to the original.

Heh. So do I. I just think that my explanation is closer to the original
(in spirit, that is) than yours.

I agree with you 100%. As much as possible. But is it possible to believe
that [insert previous comment about what I find difficult to believe about
the traditional explanation]? Obviously it is possible for you. I just
wish you would explain it to me so that I could believe it too.

I think the idea was that a running jump does full acceleration to jump point

decelerating to jump point.

This is something that you might try to do as a means of getting around

difference can ruin your whole day, as can not having the fuel to match it.
I think orbital velocities can be worked out from Kepler\'s Laws, you might
need stellar and planetary masses as well? [Help, guys, I\'m drowning here!]
I think for an approximation density and start type could be ignored...

     I\'ve reached feature freeze on my PE extensions for Galactic and I\'m
not opening it to the list for "Beta testing". You can upload it from
"ftp://ftp.maths.tcd.ie/pub/jaymin/trav/pe.zip". Jim Vassilakos\'s Galactic
can be found on "http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv/progs.html". This must be
installed first. The datasheet is below. Although you can play around, you
really need to own a copy of Pocket Empires to be able to work out much of
what to do.
     Refer to the README.PE inside of pe.zip for installation instructions
for the extensions and, once installed, refer to the galaxy notes that come
with it. Please report bugs to me at jo_grant@lotus.com (NOT Jim) and put
PE somewhere on the subject line.
     PLEASE do not request new features, or ask about joining a PBEM. I
just want to get this working first. If all goes well, I\'ll officially
release it with Galactic 2.4 and probably start a PBEM around mid-February.
The software supports a maximum of 16 empires so I\'m sure there will be
plenty of room. I\'ll notify the list when I\'m ready to start taking
applicants. The best you can do in the meantime is install the system, get
familiar with it, and chase down any remaining bugs.
     Unless, of course, someone else likes it so much that they want to run
their own PBEM, in which case I\'d love to play :-).

     Cheers,

PROGRAM NAME: "GALACTIC" [v2.3] {July 1997}
GAME SYSTEM: Traveller/MegaTraveller
AUTHOR: Jim Vassilakos (jimv@empirenet.com)
FUNCTION: Sector Viewer/Generator
OPERATING SYSTEM: IBM (MS-DOS)
SIZE: 3,153,415 bytes zipped
COMMENTS: Allows user to randomly generate sectors, displays the maps in
VGA, translates the UWP code to English, and keeps campaign notes in text
files which can be accessed directly from the map. The maps all mesh
seemlessly. Lots of official & non-official Traveller sectors are included.
There\'s even world mapping and star system mapping software. Contains
enough online help that it can be used by someone who has never before
played Traveller and is just getting into it. Note, you must use "-d"
option when unzipping.

I haven\'t seen the results yet, but I was glad to get the feedback =
(positive and negative) on my first design, the Caravel.=20

There were design errors, some of which voters pointed out made the ship =
unworkable (particularly power for the jump drives). I found a copy of =
QSDS 1.5 on line and checked the design from that point of view, and was =
able to fix it - an erroneous table reading (2 tn HEPlaR drive installed =
when a 1 tn drive would have sufficed) allowed enough room for the extra =
50 Mw power plant _and_ an additional 6 tns of cargo. This made me a bit =
happier, as those deck plans I worked so hard on were still workable. =
The price was still screwy due to the low jump drive prices in the =
original book (come down to QSDS 1.0, where our Jump Drive prices are =
IN-SANE!!!!  ;)   ) - I\'ll rework the economic analysis on the web page. =
http://hartwick.edu/~smithw/main.htm , the Deck plans are on the =
Traveller page.

While the derivation of the word is not 100% certain, it supposedly comes
from a corruption of the Carib indians, who were accused of being cannibals
by their neighbours. (fact: they were not, and actually said their
neighbours were instead. This is usually the case, it is always those people
"over there" are cannibals)

The escape velocity for gasses depend solely on the gravity well but the
thermal volocity of the molecules depend on the temp. When a small portion
of the speed distribution in the gas is above escape volocity those
molecules will never come back and yor gas starts to leak away.

Wrong, whenever something is studied each answer to a problem leads to more
questions. 3I probably knows HUGE amounts about stars that we don\'t but
that is nothing compared to what the 3I don\'t know about them (and we don\'t
even know that we don\'t know).

I suspect one thing the 3I can do is sample the interstellar medium by
jumping into deepo space and search for iceballs etc that have accumulated
interstellar molecules for millions of years, then carefully study them
layer by layer to get a history which can tell you how the currents in
space flow etc. They could also try to match vectors with one of those
multi AU long matterspikes shot out from supernovas as I\'ve read about.
They could search for lost generationships etc that old legends speak about
(to give the scientist adventurers some spooky stuff to chew on).

I used that handwave before but gave it up as I like my players to be able
to see neighbour stars, measure travel time for sublight ships, send
messages across parsecs with the lasercannons etc all requiring that the
maps actually map normal space so that 3 parsecs is 3 parsecs wether by
jump or by sublight.

Use the hyperspace is 2D handwave but only after deciding wether saying no
to the above mentioned plotlines is OK.

Look at the publics opinion about smoking today. Think about how people
living in a cramped biodome with badly maintaned LS equipment. Yes, there
could be a death sentence on smoking in certain places and this could be a
very nice plotline for players who are careless.

They poured all their resources into building the ship (called Ozarr) but
never got the gun as some PC stopped the deal in Traveller Adventure (my
players stole a nuke from Roet Bannerji and put inside one of the cargo
crates to explode in jump). Canon says Kferuzeng nearly disbanded prior to
the rebellion, reading between the lines: because of the massive loss of
charisma in building the ultimate corsair but never getting the gun. My
Kferuzeng joined with another group in the raid on Depot to finally get
their gun. They didn\'t and are now moving around, all bark but no bite.

Generation ships - if anyone has FASA\'s _Sky Raiders_ trilogy, _Fate of =
the Sky Raiders_ has a very good lost generation ship scenario - the =
heroes trapped on a crippled mega-asteroid ship, parsecs from the =
nearest star, trying to recover enough Sky Raiders jump technology to =
escape...an interesting adventure series, but not really one calling for =
a full-fledged science vessel.

I think that most scientific investigations would not call for a =
dedicated "Science Ship" - just as most field investigations on Earth =
have been done by people travelling as others do, just bringing another =
camera and some notebooks with them. That guy chartering your Far Trader =
to some backwater world might fill your cabins with research assistants =
and your hold with expedition equipment, but in his case he just needs a =
ship to get to the research area.

However, I think that any star system intended for colonization would =
need orbital science ships to act as bases for pre-colonization =
research. You\'d want orbital for quarantine purposes (no one wants to =
discover a Final War biowar virus while jumping back to Sylea), and for =
orbital scans - while your ground teams are doing biosamples and =
ecosystem surveys, your science ship is adding meteorological, solar =
radiation and cartographics data. Whatever government or corporation =
backing the effort would find science ships a very cheap innvestment, =
compared to the other costs of a colony and the catastrophes likely to =
occur if you colonize without a full survey.

Why use a dedicated science ship for this? Because you need the lab =
spaces, science-grade sensors (which may be better than military grade), =
and self-reliance (shops, spares, other things needed for long duration =
away from starports). A freighter or warship would need so much =
conversion for this that it would be price-comparable to a purpose-built =
vessel, IMO.

What advantages does a lab ship (with it\'s jump drives especially) have =
over an observation satellite, or a ground base? The lab ship can move =
on when the survey is done, either of the other two have to be hauled or =
abandoned. If the phenomenon you\'re investigating changes or moves, you =
can move with it. ("Commander, the Anomaly is flaring, reading 350% and =
rising!" "Damn! Helm, prep for emergency jump!")=20

I can see a military patrol squadron\'s sensor logs being routinely sent =
to the local Astrography department of a University as raw research data =
(once they\'d been vetted for military secrets).  Hmmm - plot hook: Spies =
realize some military data might be left in the logs, try to get the =
originals from the University...well, I digress. My point for this =
paragraph was that some functions of science might well be carried out =
or assisted by other types of vessels, but there should be plenty for a =
dedicated science/survey/research support vessel to do.

A science ship should, like everything else, have a why. If a space =
phenomena, region or project is best studied by that package of jump =
drives, sensors and lab spaces we call a Science Ship, someone will =
build one to do it. Though it can lead to interesting complications if =
you really need a science ship, but can\'t get one...

He\'s right.  I don\'t know about Keplar\'s laws but this will work

V = sqr(K * M / R)

Where
V is the orbital velocity
K is the gravitational constant (6.67259 * 1e-8 cm^3/g s^2)
M is the central mass
R is the radius of the circular path

This works for stars and planets.

Yes, a "J". They "borrowed" one from the Imperial
Navy, or at least planned to. Likely they wound
up with something a bit more home-grown, but
the ship was designed to be big enough to
house and power a J.

The actual design was never defined, but the
requirement of using a J at least would give
some clue to minimum size.ssels that had J-Mesons?

[snip]

Definitely interested.  Relatively complete, though?  I\'d personally rather
see a vetted "best of..." myself.  There has been a huge amount of white
noise.  Although, who am I to complain?  I just accidentally nuked the 50MB
I had archived.  doh!

> I would be willing to pay this. (I\'m not even interested in search

Flat text files would be best, with a standard naming convention of some
kind... and NOT the digest versions.  Ick.  3i dating would be a nice touch:
3-digit day number - two digit year number (anyone on the TML who gets
confused after 2000 is probably too old anyway ;-) and a letter or two for
the spammers amongst us.

Will you be sorting by category, date, or putting all messages in the root?
That would be fun.  Heh.  Category wouldn\'t work real well, for those who
respond to more than one unrelated thread simultaneously with lame segueways
(guilty! and you, too, Harold!).  By month might be the best way to go.

A yearly archive?  Consider putting them on zip disks instead of CDs?

> I *would* be upset if the files were still .zipped, however...

Don\'t compress \'em, please...  Kewl!  One more thing to look forward to
splashing cash on.

It is not the map that came with Deluxe Traveller (it was a Spinward

Well, just for record I didn\'t mix up whether the PC or the

You can use pulsars to calculate the passage of time.  The rotation 
of a (solitary) pulsar decreases at a predictable rate, so, given 
suitable sensors and star charts including pulsar info, you can 
figure out your location in space and time.

Well, this has been covered so I\'ll will just recap for those unfamiliar
with the arguments against this.  (and ignoring there is nothing
"magic" about ram type situations where you can get highery throughput
by
sacrificing efficiency and required throughput...)

Well, no.  It doesn\'t have to be that much more powerful. It only has to
be powerful enough that you can\'t do the same thing in the same space
with the other reactors.  And if using them requires the you burn all
your jump fuel in the time it takes to get one shot, and then you have
waste space carring bigger weapons (that will only ever be put to full
use for one shot only when you have fuel and only when you can waste
that
fuel) it isn\'t that much of a problem.

> Once you make it that much more efficient

I\'m not sure what you mean.  Efficiency of all reactors would be
expected
to improve and so the trade off of using a high throughput reactor that
either runs at full tilt or not at all will stay the same.

However, if you don\'t care for this, you can always just invoke the
idea that the same effect the requires a lot of energy to jump also
makes it possible to pour a lot of energy into it.  (Because the
Lanthanum grid become a head sink right into jump space, or whatever).
This is no more of a stretch than things like jump bubble theories
and fits more seamlessly and plausibly with the existing background.

The definition of "airframe" hull is that it has aerodynamic lifting surfaces*
and control surfaces sufficient that it can actually fly in an atmosphere.  A 
"streamlined" hull doesn\'t.  The space shuttle orbiter is an example of a
hypersonic airframe hull.  An ICBM RV (reentry vehicle) is an example of
a hypersonic streamlined hull.

* I used "lifting surfaces" rather than "wings" so as not to overly constrain
  the designers imagination - it could be wings, a lifting body, or even a 
  flying wing design.


The maximum speed of an object in an atmosphere is when the available thrust force equals the drag force.  The thrust is determined by the vehicle\'s propulsion system.  Drag depends on many factors, including the shape of
the hull, the area of the hull, the density of the atmosphere it\'s flying
through, and the velocity it\'s travelling.

When comparing an airframe hull to a streamlined hull, the primary 
differences are in surface area and induced drag.  The surface area
difference is easy to see - if the two hulls have the same enclosed volume
and general shape, the hull with wings is going to have a larger area.  This
directly coresponds to more drag, and a lower maximum speed for the same
amount of thrust.

On top of that, wings generate a drag force (called "induced drag") as a
direct consequence of producing lift.  The more lift produced, the more
induced drag.  Different wing shapes are more or less "efficient" (that is,
produce more or less induced drag for the lift the create) but all wings 
cause induced drag (this is the "price" you pay for the lift).

Does that make sense?

I\'m working on, even if a lot of the bandwidth right now is discussing
which OS is a better choice.  At least there isn\'t any major disagreement
over the content of the project.

For those of you questioning my choice of target OS, let me provide a
couple of explanations that may or may not justify my decision:

* I am not writing a Win95-specific app (initially) for the simple reason
that I do not have nor have access to a Win95 compiler.  I have a wedding
to pay for (my own), and I can not justify buying a Win95 compiler and the
accessory books that I would need to learn the compiler & API.

* I am not writing a Win 3.x application (for which I _do_ have a compiler)
because I am more interested in the background research and algorithms
needed to implement this application than in learning the API for Windows.
Between work, the wedding, school, and the limited time I have for my
hobbies, I have neither the time nor inclination to study the Windows API.
Yes, Win programming is significantly marketable; however, my experience
and interests lie in lower-level programming.

* The compiler I am using is a DOS port of the GNU compiler, an instance of
which exists on most (if not all) major OS\'s.  I am minimizing the amount
of platform-specific coding I am doing in order to minimize portability
issues (all of the platform-specific code is related to the graphics
package I am using).

* Since I am doing this project as a programming project for my degree, I
had no intention of charging for the software (ie, freeware).  However,
when I do get around to porting it over to Windows 9x, I am going to have
to get appropriate compiler & books, and I will (probably) consider
charging for it.

I want to thank everyone who has contributed to the discussion, and I ask
again that any comments or suggestions about the project be directed to me
or the TML.  When I have a web page up and running, I will post the URL and
make semi-regular notices to the TML about relevant changes.

I\'m not sure how this is different.  To me the difference was either
fuel is used to create a field by the grid to protect the ship and
the other is that some matter (which is arranged to have to be hydrogen)
is injected into jump space to form a bubble of normal matter that
protects it from jump space.  In that latter, if you want to have
drop tanks and such, you have invoke being able form some sort of
access to jump space the matter can transfered in, but come before
the actuall jump and the 10 diam requirement....

I\'m not sure where this is coming from or how you are getting how much
energy
goes into capacitors.  The numbers you mention are for CT and everything
I\'ve
seen for capacitors is for MT (which seperates jump and main power
plants).

I don\'t think we are forgetting about a sentence.  I think we are
just refraining from reading dubious conclusion into it.

Well, I agree that allowing energy to be supplied from outside is
problem (and I actually don\'t have a problem with any theory that
"drops" drop tanks since they open up a dangerous precident, though
one my consider it too late because they are too much a part of the
time line).  However, using jump fuel for energy doesn\'t have a problem
with that.

Well, I guess I just don\'t happen to agree.  I think the way that
clearly
explains the canon features of jump drive it that the hydrogen is used
for energy.

I had always assume that, at jump drive throughputs, you couldn\'t split
the water and prurify the hydrogen "on the fly" (and in fact, if you
look
at the purifier plants from MT, they can\'t convert fast enough to be
able to jump, esp. if you invoke the power being used in minutes or
seconds).  If you aren\'t going to use it before hand, then you need to
convert it before hand and so you need to be able to story the hydrogen
anyways.  And if you are going to store it, why not convert it before
you take it on board?

However, I don\'t know what kind of scrutiny this will stand up to.
Since no theory does a better job of answering that particular
question, I haven\'t tried to find out.

Well, I\'m not sure what you mean.  I think the etymological (is that
spelled
right?) oddity is fairly irrelevant and is very slim reed to base
_anything_
on.  I happent think that the fuel for energy is the simplest, most 
intuitive, and most consistent with canon approach.  I guess you 
don\'t agree....

Not really, if fusion is a mature technology, it\'s efficiency won\'t
change
a lot.

I have explained this.  Whether you disagree with them or not, I stand
by them...

I would just drop jump capitors altogether.  There is not need to
invoke them at all.

So we don\'t agree.  I think it is the spirit of the original that
these new theories about jump bubbles violate the most.  To me
it just doesn\'t fit the treatment (both explicit and implied)
in CT and MT.  Unless you want to look for etymological oddities
the implication to the casual reader is that the hydrogen is
being used for fuel.

Believe me, I try. :-)

version. It says nothing about jump torpedoes on page 18 or on any page I
can find. There are only descriptions of small craft and weaponry.

The way I figure it, is that the trip itself is virtually instantaneous, 
no matter where you emerge.

It just takes a week for the jumpspace effect to wear off.

So you check "line of sight" gravity wells the moment you jump.

	The additional data can be very concise: absolute micrometer
accuracy isn\'t required. You need six elements to define an orbit
(plus possibly a reference time?) So, in binary format, it\'d take
six or seven floating points. Call that 70 bytes, assuming
standard IEEE 80-bit floating point. In text format, a line or
two. In fact, one of the standard ways of distributing orbital
elements is the NORAD "Two-Line Element" or TLE ...

	Airframe hulls actually have greater drag (aka lift-induced drag
and surface drag) that tend to slow them down. Which is faster, a
long pencil with minimal surface area and frontal cross-section,
or a similar pencil with wings that increase the frontal
cross-section AND the surface area?  Assuming identical thrust,
of course.

The problem with a general statement like this, is that there are many 
different MacOS versions and configurations, and many different win95 
configurations.

For example, a PowerMac 8600/200 I\'m using at work at the moment came 
with sys 7.5.5. It crashes every time I look at it funny, while my home 
6400/180 w/ sys 8.1 is as stable as a rock.

The two PC\'s at work running Win95 crash every now and then, with the one 
system crashing hard for no explicable reason. I\'m going to update the 
system on the 8600, I suspect the crashing difficulties will go away.

I\'m finding the problem with win95 (and most MS software) is that they 
don\'t *admit* their software is buggy. "Service updates" they call them, 
and they don\'t give important ones out for free...

Their was an editorial in JTAS (CT era) that specifically stated
that everything within was not canon :-P

I can go home and dig through them, or Loren can tell you which one
(since he wrote the editorial, I belive). It was aimed at just the
questions raised about what appeared in JTAS. 

I *think* that it was in the one with the rules for nukes that
included the planet buster versions, but I could be wrong (it is
frightening how mush traveller I have in my head compared to real
stuff :-)

Nope. It was a place to explore *all* of traveller, which was always
something to customize. Canon is what is in the official history of
the published Imperium. Some rules have been canon, but personally
the rules only matter in the ways they would change
history--allowing FTL commo, for example would change huge chunks of
the history, so anything written about that would obviously be a
house rule.

On the other hand, there is a unique answer to the question "given
a straight line between my entrance and (planned) exit point, what\'s
the closest body present on that line one full week from now"? - one
always exits after one week, and the resultant path ends at the first
body it contacts. This sounds weird, but is easy to deal with.
ANd, in practice, all the bodies in the way will be at the 
destination...perhaps one only drops out of jump if you pass within
100 diamteres of a body *and* you\'ve been in jumpspace for >6.5 
days.

(Although I do prefer the "jump exit point is fixed in space at
your initial velocity" model - as long as you match velocity with
your target before jumping even a day\'s error in jump duration will
keep you out of the 100d limit.)

Current theory is that the crucial variable is the initial temperature
where the planet is forming. If it\'s colder than 0 C, an ice core
can form rapidly (the most common "solid" in a protosolar nebula
will be nice), which gets big enough to directly accrete gas, resulting
in something that sucks up enough mass to be a gas giant. If the
temperature is higher, only rocks can accrete, which is slow. (Note
that temperatures in the protosolar nebula are higher than 
corresponding temperatures today, so that Mars was too warm to 
accrete ice.) I think the density formula you have and the thresholding
for gas giants is fairly coarse...Note that a gas giant can be 
stable (after formation) evan at quite high temperatures, like 51 Peg\'s
planet (surface temp might be as high as 1800 K.)

Exactly, and it\'s amazing how poorly understood science can bit your ass.
Some bright boy decided to send a flight of B-29s home form Japan with
light fuel loads, since everybody knew they\'d get the wind assist to Iwo
Jima.  Guess what?  The Jet Stream had shifted north, and six Supe\'s went
down in the Pacific.

Good call.

My idea of a jump gate is strongly connected with how, from a CT perspective,
jump travel seems to work. There are three specific technologies from the old 
school that seem to be key:
1. LHyd drop tanks
2. artifact ships like the Annic Nova
3. use of black globes to charge jump engines.

I\'d always seen 1 thru 3 and the original sources books 1-3 + highguard as 
implying that an enormous amount of energy, over a very short duration was 
needed to initiate the jump. This is pretty much the "jump-capacitor" style
of jump technology. Once initiated, the ship either simply continues until
it reaches the end of its trip and simply drops from j-space back to n-space, 
or else perhaps some sort of "maintenance" energy is needed to power some
sort of equipment to maintain the jump. While this was never specifically 
spelled out, it was a general consensus among the other players I\'d met.

If you accept this sort of jump technology, then why couldn\'t one simply
construct a gateway or enclosing structure for ships to enter which pushes 
the them into j-space. A gateway setup is much like B5 technology. The 
second would work more like a sort of transporter where whatever is inside 
of some apparatus is moved to j-space. The big question is whether you need 
another jump gate, or some device to exit j-space, or do you just precipitate 
into n-space? Do you need some sort of maintenance drives to keep you going 
to your destination? 

I could envision huge open structure container ships, whose purpose it is to 
provide non-jump capable ships with the needed equipment to transfer them to 
some destination, with the advantage of the space usually being taken by jump 
drives and jump fuel going to extra cargo. Such a setup would be very 
expensive to construct and maintain. Therefore you\'d only see it on the 
busiest of space lanes. Still it would potentially reduce the cost of 
transporting goods from planet to planet. Thus encouraging interstellar
commerce.

I actually can\'t see how to all the different sources into agreement. Of 
course my bias is toward the older stuff. If Marc has already addressed this 
one, I must have missed the posting -- hardly surprising with the volume as
of late, and I apologize for adding to the confusion.

This induced drag varies with weight, so the top speed is weight-dependent.
An unloaded aircraft will have a higher speed than a loaded aircraft.
Not a big deal for a two-passenger fighter but significant for a cargo
plane or a passenger plane.  Also, fuel load is significant...

  Thank you for your input regarding the formula I mentioned earlier.  As
a "crude" approximation, I am happy that I have it, as compared with out
having it.

  Based on a few trial runs with the really crude program I have written,
it generates gas giants easily within Habitable zones.  By means of
looking at the planets, I suspect that there are going to be two means by
which gas Giants will be formed (with the parameters of the program that
is, not reality!).  The first method will be those planets that are of a
high enough gravity within the habitable zones that they retain the gas
anyhow.  The sun\'s luminosity will be too low to burn off the Hydrogen,
and that will be that, despite the fact that the planet\'s core will be a
density of 5.5 or better.  However, using the Traveller 2300 AD rules for
multiplying the initial core of worlds that are found to be Gas Giant
material, the final density will drop rapidly.
  The second form of Gas Giants will be those planets with a high enough
density and large enough diameter to qualify as Ice rocks, thus growing
into Gas Giants - again requiring that the diameter be blown up beyond the
initial generation.  It is my hope that I can find some happy median that
I can folllow that will permit realistic enough planet formation within a
solar system without running into the problems that CT-T4 planetary
profiles seem to create.

  If you or anyone else knows what the outer limits for orbits should be,
or have a formula that I can use to figure out the outer limits, I would
be happy to use it <grin>.  Right now, I am looking at the relationship
between gravitational attraction along with centripedal momentum to see if
there is a "size" and "mass" limitation as the planets get further out.
Also, as per Acrete (I got my hands on that paper and wish I could figure
out how to write the code for it!), it would seem that the "density" of
the solar system decreases as you get further away from the star\'s center.
I will try to use the formula that is listed in the paper for the
decreasing magnitude of density as one gets further out...

  If people here have pet peeves that random generation fails to address
in other game systems, feel free to sprout off to me either on the list,
or personally, and if it seems easily enough done, I will be happy to
incorporate it.

  Well, time to bring this to a close...

I agree with the idea of what you are both saying, but someone has to
map and calculate the numbers/vectors for 11,000 inhabited systems plus
how many other uncharted rock/systems, across 300+ parsecs of 3
dimensional space that sophonts like to occasionally go to.

This isn\'t one planet any more, but different star systems with lots of
individual worlds all doin their "thing."  Each body will have its own
"TLE" relative to Reference/HypGalCenter etc.  By big tables I simply
mean the tabulation of all this information, very much like shooting
celestial navigation with a sextant-you have huge books of data simply
to get the right ten minute increment of the single day for the
ascension/postion of the astronomical body to be used for navigation. 
(Or else it is wrong.)

I remember in old Trav you could buy a nav tape or cartidge for jumping
to a new system. 

The computer(in my game, with or without tape) can do this in seconds or
less, and to PC\'s and Vilani who have been doing this for eaons it is
second nature.  But if we were to see the tables, they would be BIG due
to the enormous volume of info.  Probably simple data, but big
nonetheless due to number of mapped elements.

An analogy I use for jump space is that of an airplane (the ship) 
flying at 29,000 feet (jump space) over the mountains and valleys 
below (normal space gravity wells).  The critical times for the plane 
are takeoff and landing.  At these times, the terrain below has to be 
flat and even (minimal gravity) or the plane will "crash" (misjump or 
be precipitated out of jump space).  But, once the plane has achieved 
cruising altitude, the mountains (of gravity) below cannot reach or 
affect it.  I say cruising altitude is 29,000 feet because there is 
_one_ place in the world where a mountain reaches this high (Mt. 
Everest).  Everest might represent the extraordinary gravity well of 
a black hole, the one thing that might affect a ship even in jump 
space.

Scratch that.  Traveller content is *not* "mandatory" and the link can go

After I posted, I went back and looked at Scouts again. There *is* a
formula for orbital period there, and given the period and radius I can
figure the orbital velocity.

 R = Distance from primary in AU
 M = Mass in Solar Masses
 
  Period = (R^3 / M)^.5 * 31,557,600 seconds
  
  Circumference = 2 * (R*149,600,000) * Pi
  
  Orbital Velocity = (Circumference / Period) km/s

Quite correct on all points.  Since performance is computed from
acelleration (which is by definition a thrust:mass ratio), this is
already handled by the design sequences.

The designer has to figure out what the significant configurations are,
and work out the weights and corresponding speds.  I suggest using
unloaded, typical load, and fully-loaded (cargo or ordinance).

Thank you Dave, you are correct.  The time referant is critical.  
It tells you when the data was collected, from the orbital data 
you can determine the exact position of any heavenly body.  
Perhaps there would be one more that being mass (especially 
needed for the star).

Even if a stellar system has a dozen planets and a couple of 
companions, that is still less than a kilobytes of data.  
The computer I\'m typing on right now could hold the records 
of 4 million such systems.  And could actively manipulate 
all the data required to reach anything within 6 parsecs for 
the highest density regions known to or hypothesized by 
man.  As I have mentioned before, a business ring would 
be capable of handling the computations in addition to it\'s 
normal functions.

I plan to implement this new rule in my campaign.  I think that Bruce
has it right.  And as the previous poster points out those bodies are
moving.  The relative velocities of these bodies will be measured in
km per second.  Unless it\'s a star, how long will it take to move out
of the way?  Let\'s say we are talking about something like Jove.

100 diameters of a huge gas giant would be less than 5 light seconds across.
If it were travelling at a speed of in excess of 13 km/s.  So that it would
pass out of interruption range in just over 3 hours.  So, what\'s the big
deal, you wait in port or in orbit an additional 3 hours before you start
your run for the jump point.

Now, I\'ll grant you that if it\'s a star like Sol and you don\'t have the fuel
to skirt it, you could be stuck in port or orbit for over 18 weeks.  With
that kind of delay, it would be worth you time (and credits) to make
arrangements for mid-flight refueling.

Besides, the only time that my characters will be precipitated somewhere
other than their destination will be if they make a misjump (hmm, if the
navigator blows his roll, instead of jumping long, perhaps...  never mind)
or if I want them to go someplace that no one knows about.  There are
endless adventure hooks that come with this complication.

Don\'t look at the problems, look at the opportunities.  :-)

No arguments there.  One of the reasons I keep mentioning the 
business ring as being capable of doing the calculations, is that 
I envision a spacers ring that automatically deluges the collected 
data on the most recent jumps to all other spacer\'s rings while 
getting the data they have.  Then when the captain, pilot, 
navigator, etc. gets back to the ship, it automatically downloads 
the information.

But then a nasty competitor might feed you faulty data.  But of 
course, that would probably be against the law.  Hooks, hooks, 
hooks, everywhere I look are hooks.

That\'s the way I do jump too. The time it takes for a ship to change
position is instantaneous, but it takes roughly a week for the ship to
emerge. The roughly relates to the purity of the injection mass and the
vagries of jump space.

>So you check "line of sight" gravity wells the moment you jump.

Right, but except for jumping *though* the star at either end, the odds of
intersecting something on the way are slim and none, and slim just left
town.  

Seriously, let\'s say you jump though five hexes each with a star on the way
to a sixth, each of those hexes is (even *flat* hexes) is over 8 light
years in area! The odds of any of these five stars\' 100 diameter limit\'s
overlaping are *very* short.

     Are there any rules for any of these?  Are there any black holes and/or

	It\'s even worse ... how do you figure out if you ran into it or
not? It\'s 100 diameter limit may not cross a straight line
between you and your destination right now, but maybe in 4 days
it will. So, do you assume each day your "jump space position"
corresponds to 1/7 the distance from source to target world? Do
you immediately enter jump space, reach the destination area, and
"hang around" in jump space for 7 days waiting to precipitate

Actually, this brings up a detail often overlooked in running players
thru artificial environments. The will be air fees, just like you have
to pay for water in current cities. 

For visitors, it\'ll be included in ticket fees or hotel fees. For
residents, it\'ll be some sort of periodic charge *payable in advance*. 

Smoking won\'t necessarily get you lynched. But if your air tag doesn\'t
show the extra sticker, you are going to get hit with a *hefty* fine.

"Public" facilities may have "free" air, but "community" areas will
require an air tag or other proof of payment. 

"Public" would be something like customs, the port offices, and maybe
the passages between them and the hotels. "Community" would be any
other non-private areas.

One cute item is having a drunk character getting "rolled" for his air
tag. :-)

And it should be possible to take advantage of the planet\'s velocity by

Actually, if we restrict things to 2-d, you only need 4 or 5 elements.

Let me try an analogy. Take an unprotected man and throw him into the
ocean. He will drown. Now build a small submarine around him. He will
be able to survive inside the submarine for a time regardless of whether
you throw him into the water or not. In my concept the jump bubble that
is created electromagnetically along the jump grid is equivalent to the
shell of the submarine (Though the analogy is not perfect because the
formation of the jump bubble precipitates the ship into jump space). As
long as that is maintained the spaceship can survive in jumpspace. Without
it it cannot.

Now take this submarine and throw it into the ocean from a great height. If
it goes to fast it will be smashed as it reaches the surface because at
those velocities the water will be like steel for a fraction of a second.
In my concept jumpspace is like that: much too dense for a ship to enter
even if you can open a hole into it. But if you inject a quantity of
hydrogen first, you create a small area of jumpspace where the density is
temporarily low enough for a ship to slip into it. Once the ship is
inside jumpspace this is no longer necessary because the ship is already
"under" the surface, ie. inside jumpspace.

>To me the difference was either fuel is used to create a field by the grid
>to protect the ship

Now, that can\'t be, because all the fuel is used before the ship enters
jumpspace, so how can you maintain the bubble? I\'ve always assumed that
the energy from the fuel was used to open the hole into jumpspace and
that the power plant maintained the jump bubble.

Check the rules for black globes and for breaking off combat. It specifies
how much of a jump drive is capacitors, how much extra capacitors cost, and
how many energy points a ton of capacitor can hold. It\'s CT all right.

Yes it does. Check it yourself. If your capacitors are fully charged by
black globe absorbtion you can jump, _provided_ you have the required
fuel.

Except that in a normal jump you can\'t get any more energy out of the
jump fuel after the jump starts because all the fuel is used up before
the jump starts as evidenced by the rules for drop tanks.

Quite right. But they are plenty good enough for other applications. So why
waste volume on hydrogen for power plant fuel?

Except that other kinds of fusion power plants DO improve (significantly)

But jump capacitors are just as much part of canon -- CT canon at that --
as the jump drive as a special kind of power plant. In fact, and I know
that I may be completely wrong here, I\'m not at all sure that the whole
jump drive as a special kind of power plant explanation isn\'t a MT
phenomenon. Was it ever stated anywhere in CT that the jump drive
burned up all the jump fuel? Or did it just say that it used all the
fuel? I\'ll have to have a look through my little black books when I
get home...
 
Anyway, that was a side track. What I started to say was that jump
capacitors are canon and when you advocate dropping them you are
violating the spirit of the original.

It\'s not a theory. It\'s a handwave. Whether you agree or not, some of us
believe that the \'special kind of power plant jump drive\' involves some
major oddities to say the least. We don\'t believe it could work the way
it is described in CT, nor that if it did work that way it could do so
without at the same time having other applications. We also believe that
the idea that much of the "fuel" is used for some other purpose will
explain away all the oddities and leave the jump drive functioning
_exactly_ as described in CT _without_ needing any other embarrasing
handwaves. As far as I am concerned we are trying to uphold the original
spirit by fixing a crack in the game universe.

And so it is. Some of it. A small part of it. A few percent of it ;-)
 
And I defy you to find three quotes from the background material (as
opposed to the rule books) where it is explicitly stated that all the
jump fuel is converted to energy.

IIRC, canon never stated anything about jump travel taking place in a

Jump gates (or Jump Projectors as I called them when I had the idea some
years back) will eventually change the economic face of the Imperium. You
can either assume that they are not practical at all (If you set the time
before you can use a jump drive again once it has been used to about a
week you can reduce them to the usefulness of any other kind of drop tank
arrangement) or you can assume that they don\'t become possible before the
capacitors that makes drop tanks possible are invented in the late 11th
Century and that the practical wrinkles aren\'t ironed out before the
Rebellion starts.

Jump torpedoes are possible without disrupting canon history if you assume
that they cost something around that of an equivalent jump drive and have
a 1 chance in 36 of failing that manned ships don\'t have.

The simplest solution is to invoke the Ancients. Perhaps the Annic Nova
had one of those nifty pocket universes brim full of hydrogen that is
mentioned in _Secret of the Ancients_.

It all comes down to handwaving (as usual :-).

<handwave = ON>

Each jumps space (J-1, J-2, J-3 etc) is a different dimension, and when 
you enter a given jump space it is is not possible to interact with 
systems that lie in a lower or higher jump space.  Because your 
departure point is always in the "current" jump space, it is possible 
to perform micro-jumps (in-system jumps) with any jump engine, although 
most will use J-1 to conserve fuel.

For hyperspace cartography it is convenient to show valid destination 
systems on a 2-D realspace grid; howoever the behavior of jumps space 
is more complex than that.  One simplified explanation is to use the 
analogy of the firing and ballistic flight of a bullet in a gravity 
well.

Enter jump space = fire bullet
distance travelled depends on "angle" at start of ballistic flight
1 week jump time = time for bullet to rise and fall to the ground
exit jump space = bullet hits the ground.

The analogy is inexact, as in jump space the journey time is not 
influenced by the "angle of entry" (and clearly is for the bullet), but 
this is one of several "ballistic models" used by the Tri-V popular 
science programs across the 3I.

One of the reasons that these "ballistic models" are popular is that it 
is easy to visualise the bullet hitting the ground as the end of the 
journey through hyperspace.  The 100-diameter limit is often depicted 
in these analogies as a body of water ... you can hit "land" anywhere 
(i.e. come out of jump a long way from a gravity well), but the "land" 
close to a significant mass is "below water level", and it is thus 
difficult to exit jump space closer than 100 diameters.  The analogy is 
also used to explain why it is possible (and risky) to enter jumps 
space from "below the water".

Unfortunately, the real nature of jump space is much more complex than 
this and the ballistic analogies fail in many key areas.  The main 
purpose of such analogies is to "demystify" hyperspace travel and so 
make it more acceptable and accessible.

The builders of the Titanic provided more lifeboat places than they were
legally required to (by about 200 places). They were proud of this fact and
of all the modern safety features they had installed. One of the big
impacts of the sinking was the legal requirement that vessels carry
sufficient lifeboat places for all crew and passengers.

Interestingly, the Titanic\'s basic design still complies with the Solas

Also, Astronomy is an *observational* science. So while better sensors

Easy. You can synchronize clkocks across interstellar distance with
maser or laser comm. It just takes a decade or two. So the scientists
send a signal over the link when the ship jumps, and the scierntists at
the other end send a signal back when the ship arrives. Several years
later the signals arrive and are compared with local clock data.

(It\'s a bit more complex than this, but it *is* possible to measure the
time between departure and arrival.)

IIRC this was handled in The Traveller Adventure in the chapter "Leedor

certain peiods pass. Police harrassment can occur , and locals can
be \'anti-\' with people not paying the tax. An excellent way of handling

\'upstanding visitors\' by fair treatment at public offices. The only thing
is that there were no \'Public\' areas but this was cool! Gives the PC\'s
an excuse to get out into the city, and not stay in starport.

I know! We could have a table in the rules that lets you generate jump

Seriously, that approach would be in line with Imperium and the first

starport class is decoupled from population - you put high spec starports
in systems where you can jump to a lot of others, if there is only one

Someone posted earlier about Sweetpea Entertainment

exclusive rights to do a D&D film, and have had the rights
for a couple years. At one point a possible D&D movie
had attracted the attention of people like James Cameron
and Francis Ford Coppala. Currently Universal pictures
is the foriegn distributor, and Joel Silver (Leathal
Weapons, Die Hards,..) is the executive producer. The
good thing I\'m hearing though is that the producer and
director, was a long time D&D player, and has spent
the past 6 years of his life trying to get a D&D movie
made. I\'ve also heard that the script is very good and
will appeal to the wide viewing audience, while still
keeping true to the core D&D fans.

I\'d say to look for the film in the next year.

Don\'t have it with me at work, but my copy of the original LBBs from 1977
contains a statement under missiles which (IIRC) says something like "the
standard missile is a homing missile with an HE warhead. Other types of

I always thought that once you\'ve charted a course for jump space (which
takes a few minutes with the Nav program on the computer) and entered
jump space, in effect you "dissapear" and nothing affects your ship until
you come out of jump space.  

As a matter of fact, if two ships enter jump space, one behind the other,
and the second jumps farther than the first on the same bearing, the
first will not "see" the second pass by.

So no effect from planets and stars until you exit jump space.

THE controversial history of cold fusion has made many scientific
researchers very wary of hailing bold claims of new energy sources. Back in
1989, two American experimenters, professors Stanley Pons and Martin
Fleischmann, triggered one of the biggest scientific debacles in modern
times when they claimed to have created a nuclear reaction at room
temperature using cells containing water and metal hydrides. Usually atomic
nuclei can only be fused at extremely high temperatures such as those
inside the sun or in a hydrogen bomb.

Pons and Fleischmann argued that if this cold fusion process could be
harnessed commercially, it could supply a limitless source of safe, clean
energy. But the blaze of publicity and acclaim surrounding the breakthrough
was extinguished when, after five months of tests, it proved impossible to
replicate the results. Since then, countries such as Japan and Italy have
continued to pursue small-scale research into cold fusion, but the efforts
have proved largely disappointing and inconclusive. Despite running the
risk of being labelled crackpots, a few vociferous researchers are
continuing with their cold fusion experiments. This has led to recent
reports of devices claimed to produce amazing amounts of clean energy at
low cost. Most of the time these claims have been quickly dismissed, but
some early trials have been more encouraging. Perhaps the most intriguing
energy innovation is the Patterson Power Cell. Developed byJames Patterson,
chief scientist at Clean Energy Technologies in Dallas, the cell is touted
as the first device to demonstrate chemically-assisted nuclear reactions
reliably. It has been tested by the US patent office and there is little
doubt that it generates heat. The controversy surrounds how it achieves
this.

The Patterson Power Cell measures 40 cubic centimetres and comprises a glass
enclosure containing thousands  of specially coated metallic beads which
serve as electrodes. The electrolyte is water, with lithium-sulphate as the
current carrier. When subjected to a small amount of electricity - about
1.4W DC - the cell is said to put out up to 1,300W of heat. Clean Energy
Technologies cites recent experiments carried out by Motorola as proof that
the Patterson Cell works. It says that after the cell was heated to around
60"C, the input power was turned off. The cell continued to put out 20W of
thermal power to water flowing ar. a rate of 20ml/minute. This lasted for
12 hours before eventually tailing off over the course of several days.

Other researchers around the world also claim to have created startling
results from innovative devices. Two professors at Osaka University in
Japan claim to have fused heavy atoms of hydrogen inside a thin sample of
palladium. This, they say, creates low-grade heat that amounts to many
times the energy used to initiate the fusion. Similarly, Evan Ragland, an
American engineer, claims to have created a "triode cold fusion reactor
cell", with two positive terminals and a negative one. This, he says,
overcomes the problem of blocking, the bane of conventional experiments
using two diodes in which reactions within the cell cancel each other out
before reaching fusion level. Ragland reckons that an input of between 1W
and 2W produces an output up to 9W. He says he has sold demonstration
models to research establishments worldwide.

Cold fusion researchers have attempted to find theoretical models to
explain the observed effects of these devices. However, the scientific
fraternity is nowhere near establishing a theory that explains all the
phenomena. While cold fusion diehards reckon the explanation may lie in
nuclear reactions or something more bizarre, such as tapping the zero-point
energy of space at the atomic level, some traditionalists refuse to believe
cold fusion is possible. One such sceptic is Peter Stott, head of
experimental physics at Jet, the thermonuclear fusion project based in
Oxfordshire. He is intrigued by the claims of the cold fusion researchers,
but doubts their results could be reproduced. He says: "I am not denying
that some forces appear to be at work within these experiments. However,
these quirks are likely to come from a flaw in the experiments or an
electrochemical effect, but certainly not at nuclear level."

Stott argues that cold fusion remains very unlikely and would require a
radical change in the fundamental laws of physics and inter-nuclear forces.
"It would be as big a change in physics as has been seen so far this
century," he adds. Indeed, failure to produce significant cold fusion
results has persuaded the Japanese government to abandon statefunded
research into the phenomenon. A five-year effort costing $200 million and
involving Hitachi, Toyota and Toshiba has failed to turn cold fUsion into a
practical energy-producing technology.

Nevertheless, cold fusion still has its high-profile converts. The author
and scientist Arthur C Clarke is quoted as saying that cold fusion will
eventually lead to "a technological revolution comparable with the
discovery of fire". He is also reported to be willing to fund a British
institution to research the subject.

Know what you mean - my PowerBook 190cs/66 was stable as can be with sys
7.5.2, but my 6400/200 w/ sys 7.5.3 was more like my Win3.11 machine (a

The Win95 system my friend has got crashes a hell of a lot (for no apparent

Glad to hear you\'ve finally got something.

I\'m still waiting for my books, that James promised he\'d ship three weeks
ago.  Meanwhile, the package that Dom sent me from England arrived in less
than a week.  

I see no reason why I should pay any more money for long distance phone
calls to California, just to get what they owe me.  I\'ve disputed the
charges with VISA, and reserved copies of the missing products at Fandom
II (a mere five hours drive away).  As to my \'missing\' JTAS subscription,
I haven\'t decided yet.  Anyone got any good revenge ideas?

In many cases, energy is required to set up a field and not to maintain
it.  (It takes electricity to set up an electric field in a capacitor,
but once that has been done, you can disconnect and it will hold that
field, even letting you get the energy out later).  Obviously, in a
real world situation you may require _some_ energy to maintain, but
this can be so low as to be not worth worrying about in game terms
(heck, you make that the job of "jump capacitors).  This fits with
references to trickle charges that have been passed around for
keeping a jump field up.

I will.  I\'ll get back to you on that.  However, even if true, it
doesn\'t
prove that the problem simply isn\'t that capacitors aren\'t big enough
to hold all the energy involved.

Yes, and there is nothing in that sentence that says that the
fuel isn\'t used for energy (in fact that is the common meaning of]
the term fuel).  So that fuel is required after the _capacitors_
but not after the energy (since that is what all the fuel is for).
Now you can read alternative explinations into what they really
meant by "fuel" and why you needed some after the capacitors,
but I don\'t see this as being anything close to saying anything
about need hydrogen for non-energy purposes.  I hardly see this
as standing alone as showing a non-energy use for fuel, let alone
against how one would inuitively see a lanthanum grid working, 
things in the story line about jump space intrudes when the
field starts to collapse, etc.  (including things I mentioned
in previous post but forgot, I haven\'t made a list....)

This is actually reading way too much in.  Do you really think that
the when they introduced drop tanks they back checked them with
Black Globes?  And don\'t drop tank description specifically mention
the use of capacitors to store the energy and then starting to
jump _after_ they have been blown away?  And don\'t they give
absolutely not mention about blowing hydrogen into jump space,
or doing anything to start a jump, before they are blown away?
(I don\'t have it in front of my, I will have to check when I
get home).

What are "plenty good for other application"?  The purifiers?  If so,
the
answer is that you need to be able to store the hydrogen after you 
purify it anyway (since the purifier isn\'t fast enought to convert water
on the fly).

<shrug>.  It depends on thing they haven\'t mentioned.  It depends on
how the fundamental methods of energy conversion are different for
jump drive.  There are actually a number of different approaches.
I know for my pet theory (where the jump process enables energy
conversion rates that aren\'t otherwise possible) it may simply be
that you are already getting maximum conversion and the advance
in technology is simply allowing reactors that don\'t have jump
space as a sink to approach those kinds of efficiencies.

Well, the jump drive in CT depended on the size of the main power
plant.  The heavy implication here (IMO at least) is that it uses 
the same power plant.  Similarly, I\'ve never seen the idea of
capacitors except for optional things (like using black globe
power) and in vague references.  And even then they have never 
really been consitently addressed.  But if you don\'t want to
drop them there is so much wiggle room you can almost anything
with them you want.

I would say that making fuel into "jump space ballast" is harder
on canon.  You can alway just keep the capacitors and remain
similarly vague about what they store (perhaps their primary
purpose is to store energy to keep the jump field up during 
transit and the black globe use is simply a sidelight).

This is FTL travel.  That doesn\'t really exist.  Everything here, on all
sides, is
at least partially a handwave.  Anyone who doesn\'t think so is deluding
themselves.  The question is, which "theory" requires the reader to
accept the least handwaving to remain consistent with connon.  As I have
said, I believe taking a whole new "theory" of jump drive and handwaving
it to fit into a set of parameters based on another theory can\'t help
but be more of a handwave.

> Whether you agree or not, some of us

We clearly we have discussed this and disagree.

> We don\'t believe it could work the way
> it is described in CT

Well, I don\'t agree that it couldn\'t work.  I do agree that CT (since
it uses the same power plant for both jump and maneuver) leaves open the
question of why you don\'t use that energy for other things. Now this
isn\'t really a problem in CT because you simply don\'t have room to
stick in larger drives, weapons, etc. that could use all that extra
energy.  But in GURPS Traveller (where weapons power will depend a
lot more on available power) this is a problem, and is why I have gotten
into this.  Again, rather than trying to cludge a whole new theory
of jump drive into existing canon, I took the "Keep it Simple Stupid"
approach of  making a simple, inuitive change. 

> We also believe that

As I have said, I think it requires more handwaves than other
approaches.
We are clearly going to have to disagree.

So am I.  I just happen to think you uphold the orignal spirit
by only changing what needs to be changed, rather than replacing
wholesale.

> And I defy you to find three quotes from the background material (as

Oh, I agree that if there isn\'t an explicit statement.  So the
question is, what is the most consitent and what is the general
implication?  The use of a shared powerplant in CT, the use of a
lanthanum grid as the central effect, the fact that _is_ called 
"fuel", the fact the jumpspace sickness is caused by a collapse 
of a field, the fact that there is a mention of an signature of
energy being returned out of jump space (when the ship returns) but
there is no mention of any mass returning, the use of capacitors
including being able to jump, in one adventure, on solar power 
alone,  the fact that at least a portion of the hydrogen is used 
as fuel (and there is never any mention of how it is used in any 
other way and there is never any distiction at all between the
protion used for hydrogen and the portion used for mass), etc.
more than outways the sentence or two that I\'ve seen that can
be read either way.

Quite right, jump gates are something that should only be introduced
as a new invention and even then the GM should be prepared to do a
lot of working thinking out the reprussions and dealing with unexpected
implications as players explore them.

This is something that not everyone agrees on and was the subject
of an extensive discussion a while back.  While Hans was adamant
that this assertion was true, there were other (myself included)
who felt equally sure it wasn\'t.

EXPENDABLES
Certain materials for starship (and non-starship) operation are not
considered to be routine operating expenses, but nevertheless involve
occasional purchases on an irregular basis. These include ammunition and
repair parts.
Missiles: Missiles for missile launch racks are expended when they are
fired; replacements must be obtained for reloading purposes when the
situation warrants. Basically, a missile is of the homing type, costing
about CR 5000 each. Such missiles are committed to a specific target when
fired, and after launch, home towards that target until either the missile
or the target is destroyed. Other types of missiles are possible (for
example, jump capable message torpedoes, or bombs for attacks against
planetary surfaces), but such require either specific alterations to
ordinary torpedoes, or location of an arms supplier who deals in such
items. Specific attributes of such non-standard missiles are the realm of
the referee.
Sand: The abrasive particles used in the sandcaster are of a special
composition, combining prismatic crvstals and ablative particles, which
allows interference with laser beanms and pulses, as well as inflicting

This makes the smallest jumpable hull very much less than 1400m3 but many
things have changed over the years so I wont worry.

Don\'t think so.  It may be heresy here but I have never, ever, read any of the Mega
Traveller stuff.  I did look at TNE the basic rulebook anway, but none of that stuff
really caught my fancy.  I also took an extended break from gaming in college.  So I
really don\'t have any clue about any of that stuff.  I\'m a hardcore, little black
book CT kind of guy.  T4 seems to be right in the spirit of those, and thats why I\'m
back into it.  Wish I had access to some of those little black books.  I think
Mercenary, Trillion Credit Squadron and High Guard were my favorites  (I think High
Guard had the more complete Naval career stuff?).

Oh, for those books to be re-released.  Or, for T4.1 to be released in that format!
That gets my excited in a strange way.   hehe  :-)

Short of that, if the data from those old books were released on the web, on a disk,
in a stack of xeroxed copies, sometime real soon, I\'d be a very happy little man.

While not a servant of the Evil Empire, I can instruct you on how not to
send rich text over the TML.  When next you respond to a post, click on the
filing card icon next to the "To:", "Cc:" or "Bcc:" line.  When you get to
the address book, select TML.  If you don\'t have the TML in your address
book, add it.  Then click on the properties button.  Check the "Send E-mail
using plain text only" box.  Then when you send e-mail with rich text
(HTML), Outlook Express will tell you some people prefer plain text and you
will be asked if you want to send plain text.  Just select the Send Plain
Text button.

In FF&S1, any power plant (fusion, fission, internal combustion, fuel

it\'s a type of fusion drive.

Chairdogs (and the sleeper model, beddogs/bedogs) were from his
Jorj X. McKie/BuSab novels, _Whipping_Star_ and
_The_Dosadi_Experiment_.  Excellent writing, good stories, lots
of interesting material that could be included into Traveller -
although there was enough differences between his universe and
the Traveller universe that his universe couldn\'t, IMO, be called
"Travelleresque".

I\'d _love_ to have a "Contact: Gowachin" for Freelance Traveller.

And I wish Herbert would write more stories in this series.  N.B.
As near as I can figure, his story _The_Godmakers_ feels like it
was/should be set in an earlier period of the same universe.

No, you don\'t if you are running the project on a system with Visual Basic.
However for distribution you can create a .exe form which can run without

I haven\'t actually played in years and over time I\'ve pulled out the old

"High-Efficiency Plasma Recombustion"
 ----
"...HEPlaR adds a heat exchanger/recombustion chamber to any existing fusion
(not Fusion+) power plant.  Hydrogen injected into the chamber is heated to
a plasma state, then magnetically accelerated further to produce a
high-velocity stream of reaction mass.  HEPlaR thrusters require input
power."  FF&S2 p 65

So, apparently, you have to have the fusion power plant before you can add a
HEPlaR engine.  However, I remembered reading something on fusion rockets.

"Fusion"
 ----
"Appearing experimentally a TL8 and perfected at TL9, a fusion rocket is
simply a fusion reactor designed to \'leak\' fusing hydrogen plasma, under
control, out one end."  FF&S2 p 66

So, it seems to me that you could use a fusion rocket to provide the "power
plant" required, as a "pre-heater" of sorts.  I would say you would have to
go with a fusion rocket .25 (0.00125/.005) times the size of your HEPlaR
with a minimum size of 11 1/9 m.  Bearing that in mind, you will need a
minimum of 44 4/9 m of HEPlaR producing 88,888 8/9 kN of thrust.  If you
use less, you will have to deal with the radioactive exhaust.

I guess that didn\'t help much did it.

Does anyone know what the operating temperatures are for fission piles?

I must be Travelling,

Richard

PS:  It seems that I have found another error in FF&S2.  Table 167 (p 105)
lists the TL\'s as 9 and 10.  Does anyone know which of these are right?
It\'s not in the errata data I have.

As I said earlier, the JTAS articles are not canon until someone like Marc
says they are canon.  Since the drop tanks are included in everything from
LBB5 (High Guard) to FF&S2, I would guess that\'s confirmation enough.

In answer to your first question, just under the speed of light.

If all you want is contact, then just launch a small ship with a double
100,000 AU transceiver.

At TL9 using a Bussard ram jet engine, a ship could reach better than 98%
the speed of light.  Spanning a parsec would take less than 5 years at 1 G.

I did check this out, and it does say what Hans claims (and my
proviso applies).  Interesting is what it also says (it pays
to refresh one\'s memory sometimes).  Under fuel it states that
"A ship requires fuel for its jump drive and for its power plant;
the power plant converts fuel to energy for computers, jump drives,
maneuver drives, weapons, and screens."  The fact that the author
stops to delineate what fuel is used for and fails to mention
it being used for anything other than energy, to me is telling.
Otherwise, one has to wonder why an author would choses to
explicitly delineate the most obvious usage for fuel (to
get power) and somehow not see the need to point out a use
that the reader can\'t be sure of otherwise.

Well, in fact the description of drop tanks in CT is no
help either way.  I must be remembering a later description
of drop tanks (though I am sure that some mention of this
sort exists).

Actually, maneuver drives don\'t improve in efficiency either, so
it might be best concluded that there simply wasn\'t an exhaustive
analysis of which things should improve by TL when the book
was written.

There must be more than one version of the CT Book 2: Starships

I checked my Book 2 last evening and on page 18, 6th line of the paragraph about missiles,
"jump capable message torpedoes" are mentioned as an example of a missile.

I cannot see any edition or revision numbers in my Book 2. But it is printed in the UK by Game\'s 
Workshop under license from GDW.

The computers ability to accout for such pertubations is really dependent
on the software and time used. If you have orbital elements that are a
hundred years old, you need to do the calculations from that day to the
present to see if there are any significant pertubations. That is going to
take a long time, even for a TL12 computer.


Today it is really hard to make good predictions on orbits of high
accuracy. The last sentence was meant to indicate that there are other
objects than planets in a starsystem. Asteroids and comets will be much
harder to predict the orbit for and to locate one based on a hundred years
old data can be quite a daunting task.

Another source I use for new games (at 30% off) is Titan Games.  In the

Yes, my original 1977 LBB book 2 has the following on page 18:
"Other types of missiles are possible (for example, jump capable message
torpedoes, or bombs for attacks against planetary syrfaces)), but such
require either specific alterations to ordinary torpedoes, or location of
an arms supplier who deals in such items."

My apologies to the original poster for questioning the truth in his statements.

Note: this ship uses the unofficial fuel in waste space rule.

The \'Tjurkala\' Class Tramp Freighters are commonly found plying the star
lanes of the Solomani Rim.  The \'Tjurkala\' design has changed very little
since it\'s entry into service early in the Rule of Man.  It\'s design specs
are well known throughout the area once controlled by the former Terran
Confederation, and is still being built on a good number of worlds in all
five major states of the Solomani Rim.

New \'Tjurkala\' Freighters are often built as cheap, quickly constructed
freighters by a number of governments, either as government-owned
transports, or as part of subsidized merchant operations.  Once paid off,
many are sold to private individuals and operated as Free Traders.  The
ships are a popular choice for start-up operators, as parts and service are
easy to obtain on most developed worlds.

The \'Tjurkala\' is lightly armed, carrying a small dual laser in it\'s single
turret (although many variants forego the armament alltogether).  A
sandcaster provides some small measure of defence.

Beyond the reach of interstellar government (and their tedious starship
operating regulations), examples of this class as old as half a millenium or
more ply their trade.  One famous (indeed, almost legendary) example was the
\'Hat Trick\', operated by the infamous \'Black\' Jack Cooley, the former Terran
Navy Captain discharged and exiled from the Old Earth Union in -225
following the \'Harpoon\' mutiny.

IIRC the Andes plane crash case, where survivors ate the bodies of the
dead, no charges were pressed. In fact I recall seeing a Catholic priest
interviewed on TV about this who said that in his interpretation of
doctrine, the survivors actually had a duty to do this, as otherwise they
would have been allowing themselves to die when a means of survival existed
- - this would have been tantamount to suicide and therefore a sin. So eating
sophonts is much less likely to be a crime than killing them especially for
the purpose.

Don\'t vegetarian Tibetans have a religious clause that says it\'s OK to eat
meat if the animal died by accident?

Jump torpedoes were mentioned in passing in the first edition (1977) of
Book 2, but dropped in the second (1981) edition. I\'ll dig out the page
reference for you when I get home.

Other changes that were made to the ship rules between those two editions:

1) Originally, your Computer Model/No did not have to equal or exceed your
jump drive number, so long as the computer had enough CPU to run the jump
programme for your jump. So for example Type S had a Mod/1, and Type M had
a Mod/2 IIRC. These changed to Mod/1bis and Mod/3 respectively in the 1981
edition.

2) Originally, your power plant number did not have to equal or exceed your
jump number. So the Type M had jump-3, manoeuvre-1, power-1. This meant you
could have a 200 ton jump-6 courier, which is no longer possible.

3) Ship\'s Boats did not have a variable payload. This is because between
1977 and 1981 High Guard came out with ship\'s boat design rules, and the
standard boats were reworked to match.

4) Power plant fuel was used up in manoeuvring in the 1977 edition (and
Mayday, come to that) but not in the 1981 edition.

Hmmm, We know that "Xenophilia" is already taken, and eating isn\'t usually
involved (although biting might be).  The meaning of Xenophobia is well
established by the 1980\'s video game of the same name, and has its place in
Traveller.

I like your ending; -phage is one that eats, and -phagia is eating of a
specified substance or in a specified manner (according to the American
Heritage Dictionary btw).

So probably Xenophagia is eating of and a Xenophage is one who eats aliens.

This does not, as you point out, convey the desire to eat intelligent
beings.  I can see a (human) cult around eating intelligent beings in the
belief that this makes the eater intelligent (I won\'t get into the
possibility that, for some alien species, this may be true).

How about "Sophophagia" and "Sophophage", or "Sapiphagia" and "Sapiphage".

I think the latter is easier to say.  A cursory search found no other
prefix roots that are readily applicable.  Suggestions welcomed.

Now, "homo-" means "same", and, to my suprise, "homophagia" or its related
words are not listed in the dictionary.  This could be the act of eating
one\'s own race (the word cannibal is based on the name of a tribe in the
Pacific Islands and has ritualistic implications, rather than casual
consuption).

"Sophont" is used in scifi, meaning "intelligent being" but is not present
in the AHD or on Webster\'s on-line dictionary in that form.  The word is
based on the Greek "sophos", menaing clever, and lending meaning to the
word \'sophistry\' and sopohmore\' (which AHD says is \'sophos\' wise + \'moros\'
foolish...sounds about right).  Sapient is listed as meaning "having great
wisdom".

Incidentially, I would take the view that there are races who (like humans)
would be deeply offended and go to war over eating members of their race,
and others that would not care a bit, even to the point of not objecting to
killing of other members of the race (as long as they, themselves are left
alone) to do so.  "After all, their raised in captivity just for this
purpose."

im working on a traveller champaign that takes place in an alternate
historical setting of traveller...  and i was hopeing someone out there would
know were i could find some TL-10 to TL-12 warships....   i already have ideas
of what they look like, infact i am working on a set of drawings for the game
and currently working on one of the major battlegroups preparing for an
assault.

i need designs for the following ship types:

Milatry ships:
Dreadnought (these monsters are ment only for one thing...  the massive fire
power that is needed during planetary assaults- prime weapons are spinal
weapons such as Mass Drivers...  Heavily Armoured, Heavily Armed, but slow and
manuvers like a drunk and overweight cow)
    these behemoths are older in technology levels- thou they have undergone  
    massive refits to keep them combat ready...  crews vary from 400 to 600 
    personnel, plus 40 to 60 fighter pilots, 100 marines for use as security
and   
    planetary assaults.  

Fleet Carrier (carries between 85 to 125 fighters, used in larger battlegroups
to supply larger interface support and fighter cover for larger capital ships
like the dreadnought who are vulenerable to enemy fighters)
   crew total of 350 to 455 personnel, plus the pilots and support personnel
for the 
   carried fighter craft

Carrier (carries between 40 to 85 fighters, used for multiple purposes from
commerce raiding to operations in flanking attacks)
   crew total of 225 to 360 personnel, plus the pilots and support personnel
for the 
   carried fighter craft

Battleship
   crew total of 350 to 455 personnel, plus 150 marines for use in boarding
actions
   and ground combat.

Battlecruiser (used for independent operations, such as commerce raiding and
flanking attacks)
   crew total of 225 to 360 personnel, plus 50 marines for use in boarding
actions.

Heavy Cruiser
     crew total of 160 to 220 personnel, plus 25 marines for use in boarding
actions

Cruiser (used for the \'meat\' of most battlegroups..  heavily armed, good
speed, and moderate armour.. they provide support for the slow capital ships
and large convoys that are transporting troops)
    crew consits of 80 to 140 personnel, plus an additional 25 marine boarding
party.

Frigate (used for independent operations, such as commerce raiding, picket
duty, showing the flag, and flanking attacks)
   crew size varies between 40 to 80 personnel, plus a marine boarding party
of 25.

Destoryer (escorts whose prime weapons are missles)
   these guys are primarily nothing more than large, fast missle boats that
run 
   around the convey or battlegroup they are escorting...  crew size varies
between
   20 to 30.

Stealth Ship (small ship equipted with stealth technologies- think primative
cloaking devices)
  These are the latest and cutting edge ships used by the Terrans.  extremely
small
   crews (total of 12..   pilot, co-pilot/navigatior, commander,
commun/sensor, cheif  
   weapons officer, two gunners, cheif engineers, three asst. engineers,
medical 
   officer/specialist)

Corvette (also known as a Light Escort Carrier, carries one full squadron, 6
fighters.. used only for operations in escort duties of conveys and troop
transports...  some are assigned for system defense of important areas...)

Support Vessels:
Medium Transport, Supply
Medium Transport, Troop
Heavy Transport, Vehicle
Fast Courier/Diplomatic Boat

Fighters:
Heavy Fighter (Fighter/Bombers and Torpedo Bombers)
Medium Fighter (attack fighters)
Light Fighter (interceptor fighters)

Civilian Vessels:
Tramp Frieghter (think of a free trader or better yet.. the Millienium Falcon,
used by
    independent traders and smugglers)
Bulk Frieghter (big, slow and ugly... but they carry a lot of junk, good for
the small  
    business person out for a fast buck)
Armed Merchantman (big, fast, and beautiful.. used mostly by big corps and 
   national governments for important cargoes...)
Pleasure Yacht (just what it says...  a private starship used by the wealthy
for 
   startravel...  many diffrent designs and sizes...  some are modified for
use by 
    some smugglers)
Luxury Cruise Liner (big ships that use a spin gravity belly- like the cruise
ships on
    Bablyon 5... uses older technology for its construction..  they aren\'t
that fast, but 
    they are an enjoyable and luxurious cruise...)
Customs Interdiction Frigate (used by the \'Coast Guard\' with the systems
defense    
    boats in close defense of all systems...  keeps the smugglers on their
toes)

i dont have the FF&S sourcebook so i cant build these for my self...  cause i
think it would be better if i went ahead and built these buggers from scratch
for my game.

thanks for the help in advance...

 Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Frank Herbert died some
time ago.

From the Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia of SF (1995 edition):

"(1920-1986) US writer born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the
University of Washington, Seattle. FH worked as a reporter and editor on a
number of West Coast newspapers before becoming a full-time writer. He lived
in Washington State."

Wow.  Now that\'s a campaign!  Honestly, though, do you actually need to know
all about EVERY SINGLE ship?  How many PCs/players do you have?  Are you
writing for "Traveller: The Movie" yet?  Heh.  It sounds like you\'re putting
together the artwork, why not just give generalities and spend time only on
the ships you actually need?  "The Lewinski-class \'missile\' frigate
displaces about 1200 tons, has twin..."  You get the picture?

That\'d make for one helluva campaign binder, though.  And *long* battles if
that many fleet resources are involved...

For several months there have been  a rumors of a Trans-Core-Rally
sponsored by the ISBA, we are now pleased to announce that the rally
will take place.  The exact date has yet to be announced but the ISBA
is now accepting entries for the contest.   This is a Role Playing
adventure on an epic scale : )

The back ground is a Milieu Zero setting using mostly T4 rules with a
few exceptions.  The Core sector  will be the one found in Milieu Zero

1: Travel rules will be based on a modified Mega Traveller: Starship
Operator\'s Manual system

2: Combat will be done using Joe Walsh\'s and Eris Reddoch\'s Role
Playing Space Combat System V.095

3: I have some modified Broker rules that I will be using to make them
more realistic.

Starship Design, cost and crewing will be done using QSDS, SSDS, both
FF&S  i.e. same as THUDDD.

I hope to run this across the ISBA role-playing list, e-mail, IRC,
snail mail, phone and from my web site over acourse of 5 months or so.

I have drastically shorten this message to save band width so for more
information contact me at tim@premier.net.  If you are on the ISBA
list more information will be forth coming.

yes, its a real large undertaking...  my players are going to be playing the
movers and shakers in what is going to be my Traveller Universe\'s Frist
Interstellar war.  

They will be playing several ship captains and command crews(and flag officers
at a later date in the champaign) in the opening stages of the First
Interstellar War.  The Terran Confederate Navy has had form 2109 to 2290 to
build itself up and get combat experence with its fighting against several
smaller spacegoing powers (they fought and destroyed the war capacity of a
Genocidial race who had attempted to wipe out several other races.... yes, i
stole that one from Bablyon 5).

The Terran Confederation is a loose confederation of the Earth\'s nations and
their colonies (think of the 2300Ad setting with a Confederate Congress and
Confederate President that is made up of the world leaders of the various
nations).  

The Confederate Navy is still made up of the Individual National Navies, just
under the combined Confederate Naval High Command (whose leaders are the best
flag officers that the Terrans can find).  

I am combineing aspects of 2300Ad, Bablyon 5 and Traveller itself.   

if you want anymore information on the champaign, drop me a line....

No.  There are two "versions" of FF&S1.  There is the version as-printed,
and there\'s the Mk.1 Mod.1 version (basically, the as-printed version plus 
several pages of updates and errata).

At least in theory, FF&S2 is based on FF&S1 Mk.1 Mod.1; but there are a few
instances (such as one equation in the gauss gun sequence) where errors
were perpetuated from FF&S1 as originally printed.

  You could also jump to the outer system (Neptune, Pluto, wherever),
refuel (GG or fuel station) and then jump "around" the system primary.
Same effect, but much more efficient if you don\'t have thrusters?

The original (FF&S1) intention of HEPlaR was that it could use any 
power input, and that it simply heated the hydrogen reaction mass to 
a plasma state.  It was acknowledged that it was much too fuel 
efficient, but gave something of a hard-science feel while allowing 
characters to take off and land on planets with standard ships.

I don\'t have FF&S2, but others have posted that it has changed to 
requiring a fusion power plant.

Eww...  What\'s up with the "rights of passage" cruise o\' doom thing?
Desperate content...  Oh, spoiler warning...  Heh.  "The Gauntlet Cruise,"

improvement over some previous, but Milieu:0\'s still my favorite (but why\'d
the clip the cool clouds from the top of the front cover, but not the
back?).  Somebody get Chris Foss some new paint buckets, too.

* Nine "noble" missions relation (loosely from what I can see) to what
nobles do with their \'free time.\'  [A stealth tax collection mission against
an "ancient noble house from the Emperor hisself?  Come on...]

* No new gear.  [Sorry, \'heads.]

* No new socio-political background [bummer!] that cannot be gleaned from
the plot (i.e. no long-winded dissertations that I love so much).

* No obvious, glaring typos, formatting boo-boos that I could see whilst
perusing so far.

* Interesting insertions of modern US slang: somebody tell the editor that
"My bad" [meaning \'my mistake\' for those not familiar with it] may work for
prime time sitcoms and Hollywood, it just doesn\'t evoke "Traveller" to me.
\'Wilkins, fire the Solomani, and get me a good Vilani editor!\'

There are various versions... the pre-Rebellion version, and the Rebellion

Notice the blank sector map in MT (printed I think in the Ref\'s Companion)
which is the Spinward map with the worlds blankeed out... thus some hexes are
unnumbered.

planet Porrozlo.

I led the characters around the Marches using the Twilights Peak scenario.
During the search for the location for the fabled base, the group discovered
(among other things): an insane miner who ate his companions 30 years before
he met the group (and hid the bodies in an octagonal building on Kinorb), a
slaving ship that had crashed on another world, killing all the unfortunates
on board and giving the group the outrage required to chase after the
organisation sponsoring the ship and an ancient evil that has decided to
kill the group for no reason (at least that they have figured out by now).
They also met an insane king on Porrozlo (Derek the XXIII, God King of
Saanth) and a strange alien that generates crystals from her body that
"carry" emotions through them (Does it have a relation with the strange
jewel in a dagger that makes the wielder feel pain?).

All in all, an average day in the Spinward Marches...  Oh yea, there are
rumors of a conflict in the Navy between supporters of one admiral and the
Duke of Regina.

At the end of every evening, I type the notes from that session, I now have
100 pages.  It also helps me keep track of all the NPC that the characters
have met before...

MegaTraveller.  I rebuild the published sectors in 3 dimensions, overlay
known stellar data and then lay sectors above and below for a shperical
Imperium.  My work has a lot of artistic lisence but leads to unexpected
environments, geographical relationships and visual aspects 2d Trav
doesn\'t have.

Funny you should ask....  ah, hum...

Hello and thank you for the inquiry,

Please find attached the specification for the proposed Sword Class 10000std
Cruiser. It is intended as an independant patrol vessel, in addition to
fleet operation roles.  The specification speek for themselves. However let
me highlight some of the features that may not be readily apparent.

The centerpiece of the Sword class\' offensive armament is the 4X4 missile
bays, allowing an substantial 16 missile to hit space at one salvo, and
magazines carrying enough ordinance to launce 76 salvos. In addition 4 Heavy
laser bays are backed by 12 Light Lance laser turrets. The shipboard weapons
are intended to be suplimented with 12, 15std Flacette Fighters (still in
testing stages) and 5 50std Transported (also in retro-fit design at this
time).

Of course crew comfort is more spartain on this vessel than your Highliner,
however there is more than sufficient entertainment for the crew, each of
the crew compartments, with a total capacity of 300, contains bunks
incorperating individual sterio monitors tied to the ships entertainment
computer, allowing access to hundreds of prerecorded videos. Three fully
equipted gymnasiums are also incorperated in the ship\'s design. There are 44
Junior Officer cabins, and 16 Senior Officers staterooms. These numbers are
slightly higher than the maximuim crew (which allows for contious 3 shift
operation) and the 60 Marine contengent normally carried by the Sword Class,
allowing some flexibility in the exat crew composition.

The Sword Class also mounts an ample sensor suite, including back ups.

Purchase Price  $25,673,433,544
Down Payment  $5,134,686,709

While the price for the Sword Class is rather steep, you must ask yourself,
"What price security?!". Volume discounts may be arranged.

Well, there will be times of year when it costs less in fuel to jump to
a given system. But it won\'t be much worse than the current situation
for aircraft or ships dealing with adverse wind conditions. You can
still do it, it just costs a bit more in fuel.

I seriously doubt it\'ll get *that* miniaturized. Why? Well, I just took
apart a couple of TV remote controls yesterday (I found one, and after
looking at it I examined the one for my set to confirm what I\'d found).
The components *other* than the keypad will fit in a thimble with lots
of room left over. One *small* IC, a tyransitor, a IR diode, a crystal,
3 caps, and a couple of resistors.

All that space is to make the thing easier to handle and hard to lose.
I expect that watch sized units will exist. Rings are exposed to too
much banging around. And notebooks will be useful as you have a decent
sized display and writing surface.

In any scheme like that you\'d identify all data with a *source*. And if
you got data from several sources, you\'d store all of it, and offer the
user the option of deciding which source to trust if they differ.

Frankly, I\'m pushing for there to be a file listing differences between

Remember, you are exchanging signals *both* ways. So you know the round
trip time. And half of that *has* to be the time the light takes. This
is as good as you can get, give the way relativity works.

That\'s "pulsars" not "quasars".

Slight problem. 10% or light speed relative to *what*? Right now you
are moving a lot faster than that relative to various distant stars.
And relative to things like cosmic rays.

Here\'s another possibility: remember the Star Trek NextGen
episode with the Pakled -- the race of "slow" hijackers?
Who had such witty dialogue as:
   "We look for things make us go."
   "Our ship broke."
   "Please help us."

Evidently the scriptwriters didn\'t think of
it, but it occured to me that Picard might have 
ordered a diagnostic run on the translator just
to make sure it wasn\'t "overtranslating" things.
   After all, if the translation was erroneously
oversimplified, the message:
     "We are dilithium prospectors. Our vessel
has suffered a critical malfunction in our warp
core. We request assistance..."

...would come out much like the baby-talk above.

It\'s been tested with a plate recovered from the Titanic. At the temp
of the water at the time of the accident the stuff practically
*shatters* when given Charpy test.

The TV program that showed the test above also tries to find that ship.

When I get the money, I plan to have a network with the following
systems on it:

PC running DOS
PC running OS/2
PC running Win 95 (or successor)
PC running Win NT
PC running Linux
Mac

And if I can handle the interfacing issues, I\'ll have some old 8-bit
systems linked in. :-)

Regarding Ghostscript: I hate to say this to you but I\'ve already
implemented a Ghostscript interpreter. I\'m happy to see that someone else
has recognized the need dead people have for computers. I have included an
example of the output of my Ghostscript at the end of this letter.

The interpreter is written in a language called cant-C, developed by Mr.
Turing last year. The compiler is easily ported to any environment you
care to name. I would be more than happy to send you a copy, but you must
first contact my lawyer for this venture, Thomas Jefferson of Phila. Pa..
(As a side note, Mr. Jefferson is very excited by Ghostscript. Look for
The Declaration of Independance V1.1 RSN).

The possibilities for Ghostscript go far beyond Deathtop publishing, I\'m
sure you\'ll agree. I have contacted numerous authors who may be interested
in using Ghostscript (Shakespeare, Hemingway, etc) and all have been very
excited by what they\'ve seen. (Shakespeare wants to write a modern Romeo
and Juliette, called Romeo and Julio, the story of 2 gay hispanic men kept
apart by their parents.) 

Anyway, here is the Ghostscript example I promised. Feel free to show this
to your friends and colleagues, I\'m sure they\'ll all be suitably impressed.

You mean to tell me that actual English (well, American English) speaking
people actually use that expression?  When I saw it in some of the posts on
the TML, I assumed it was a misconstruction by one of our English as a
second language people.  They can be expected to misconstruct our language,
but home groan errors like that are (to me) unbelievable.  I suppose it\'s
ebonics.

I don\'t, except to know which ones to avoid in my limited TV watching time.

I was going to post that the passage was in my LLB, but was beaten to the
punch.

One thing I note is that this special "jump capable message torpedo\'s" size
isn\'t mentioned. It could still be a 100dt vehicle. It would be a *big*
honking torpedo, but would still meet the size limitations.  Not that
meeting the size limitation is that big a deal, is it? ;->

It may not even be a social blunder. I can see societies where the
deceased is reverently consumed (at least the parts ruled edible by the
coroner) at the wake. Won\'t *that* shake up your players.

I can even see societies where condemned criminals are sold as meat.
Somehow I can\'t see you acquiring "kreef" that way, but long pig is
possible. It\'s also possible in some societies for a person to will
their remains to someone. I\'ve met folks working thru the legal mess
for this so they can will their tattooed skin for artistic displays,
and even to will some bones for use in an art project.

I\'d *like* to use my own sectors if I ever get time to game again, but
the existing sectors make that kinda hard as the Imperium is pretty
much surrounded.

I\'m sure in a couple thousand years they\'ll be using slang that we haven\'t
even dreamed of yet...  Geez, look how much slang has actually changed in just
60 years in the U.S. and in Britain!  :)

"This Trader is PHAT, yo!  Jump Three?  That Drive is off the hook!  Yo, I\'m
all _about_ engineering..."

or

"This Trade Ship is the _limit_!  Jump Three?  Isn\'t that just the bees-knees?
When it comes to engineering, I\'m on the trolley!"

When meeting locals in a hostile situation:

"Yo, backdaf***UP!  You steppin\'?  I\'ll bus\' a few caps in yo\' a** with my
plasma gun!  You think that combat armor\'ll protect ya, you been straight
trippin\'.  Check yo\'self _now_!"

Actually, all of the above sound kind of like my Traveller sessions already...

Sorry...  Weird mood.

Currently, I\'m running a game in the Daibei sector, with subsectors I created
myself.  Not a big fan of the canon subsectors (nothing wrong with them, its
just, why dedicate pages to world building if you\'re not going to use the
rules?)...

In addition, I\'ve always found it easier to run a game in a locale I\'ve
invented myself rather then published ones.  Easier for me to imagine the
relationships between things and such when I create instead of read.

I\'m not sure 6 sandcasters is enough, either.

This is a *very* weak meson screen. Either put in one that will stop a

I dont like the acute lack of non-missile, non-laser armament on a 10 000
ton ship. Sure you couldnt shoehorn in a 60m long meson gun ? It wouldnt
have to be that high in output - just enough to keep the other side honest.

What is the range, megajoulage and RoF on the lasers ? It\'s important for
translating to, say, Bruce\'s Revised Space Combat System.

I\'d replace one of the engineering shops with another sickbay myself. The
debriefing room is a nice touch, but I\'d do what I could to get some more
sickbay rooms. Getting hit by PAWs or Meson Guns would tend to leave a lot
of crew with radiation sickness, even when the ship survives.

If you are looking for a 15 dton fighter, you really cant go past Svensson
Small Craft - best known for their excellent lifeboats, the Wasp class
Light Fighter is completing it\'s test flights even as we write.

And let me guess ... the 50t small craft are Marine Landing Craft ?

It strikes me as being a very big frigate - pure laser/missile armament but
high gees - rather than a cruiser-type ship, but an interesting design.

Actually, you don\'t have to get *nearly* that convoluted. The known
instances of cannibalism as a feature of a *culture* all invlove
warriors eating the slain enemy or portions of them. And the usual
logic is either that you are honoring them, or that by eating them you
are incorporating their bravery or some other desirable characteristic.

So by that model, a culture that went thru that stage and then got
re-contacted might retain it. Which could lead to problems for players.

"I suppose they\'re mad at us because of those guys that got killed in
the bar fight?"

"No, they\'re a warrior culture. Dying in a fight is accepted. It\'s just
that you haven\'t made arrangements to eat the bodies yet..."

The technical term for cannibalism is "anthrophagia" or something like
that.

And themn, as above, there are races who\'d be offended if you *didn\'t*

As a matter of fact, I seem to recall that there\'s a court ruling from
the 19th century that establishes that it is *not* a crime to eat human
flesh in an emergency as long as the person(s) being eaten died of
natural causes. 

It\'s only a crime if you killed them (and probably if you did something
that allowed them to die when you could have kept them alive). 

Given this, I suspect that something like "The Church of All Worlds"
could even win a case for serving the deceased at the wake.

I don\'t know for sure. But as I recall, Jewish rabbincal law has a
clause that allows for violating the dietary rules for emergencies.
That is, if all there is to eat is pork, and it\'s not your fault, you
can eat it.

I wouldn\'t be surprised to find that Islamic law has a similar rule.

At TL11, thruster plates - at minimum sticker cost of MCr 2.5 per set - is
the poor man\'s option, because the smallest fusion power plant costs MCr 20.

At TL10, the smallest power plant that can have a Heplar maneuver drive

Now, when I say space vehicles, I am including missiles.

This is silly. If you can have a plasma gun at TL10, you can have a plasma

thats what Heplar seems to be.

It most certainly is a big part of the problem that the capacitors aren\'t big
enough to hold all the energy involved. What more do you require to admit
that a discrepancy exists? If magic capacitors that can hold only a modest
amount of energy in one situation and a humongous amount in another isn\'t a
swift kick in the old willing suspension of disbelief, what is? Furthermore,
you don\'t solve the problem by upping the capacity of the capacitors, because
than you introduce a TL 9 capacitor that is vastly superior to any other kind
of capacitor ever mentioned in Traveller.

I think you are trying to disprove something that I\'m not trying to claim.
I\'m not saying anything one way or the other about what the original
intention of the authors were. In fact, I\'d be inclined to guess that they
did think of the jump fuel as being burned for fuel. Otherwise they would
have said so. What I\'m saying is that if that is the case, then whatever
energy the jump drive provides is in addition to the energy used to fill
the jump capacitors.

>Now you can read alternative explanations into what they really meant by

I\'m not trying to read an alternative explanation into it. I\'m trying to
change the explanation. I happen to believe that the orginial explanation
have implications that requires really, really big handwaves to swallow.
I\'m proposing a simple, neat, and economical handwave that leaves the jump
drive have exactly the same _effect_ as it always have had, but neatly
resolve the discrepancies.

Only problem with that is that whatever the jump fuel is used for it is
something that happens in addition to filling the jump capacitors (since
that is done by the power plant (or the black globe)) and before the ship
enters jumpspace (since all the jump fuel can be in drop tanks that
separates from the ship after the jump fuel has been used but before the
ship jumps).

Excuse me, am I misremembering, or weren\'t you the one who accused me of
picking and chosing the parts of canon I liked and ignoring the parts
that I don\'t like (Which is absolutely true, only I like to believe that
I only pick and chose when the parts don\'t agree with each other or with
common sense)? Aren\'t you doing exactly the same thing yourself here? You
can easily make me believe that "they" didn\'t back check, but what does
that have to do with the price of fish? The fact is that drop tanks and
black globes and breaking away from combat works according to different
rules and if the rules result in a contradiction then, IMO, it is better
and more in the spirit of the original to resolve the contradiction than
to try to ignore it.

>And don\'t drop tank description specifically mention the use of capacitors

>away?

The TNS release certainly do. I can\'t find it in the rules. This is what is
technically known as a discrepancy. Two bits of canon which CANNOT both be
true. What\'s your point? That the bit that you prefer is superior to the bit
I prefer?

Actually, if the idea that the jump fuel isn\'t used as fuel at all is adopted,
the TNS release could easily be dismissed as a reporter talking through his
hat. Whenever I see news items about things that I know about there\'s usually
an average of about three major mistakes (Makes me wonder a lot about the
stuff I don\'t have firsthand knowledge about).

>And don\'t they give absolutely not mention about blowing hydrogen into jump
>space, or doing anything to start a jump, before they are blown away?

Absolutely none. But it does talk of converting the huge amount of hydrogen
to energy and storing the energy in the capacitors. Which is one of the bits
some people finds a tad unbelievable in itself. When combined with a rule
that makes the amount needed so small that the regular power plant can supply
it on its own in less than 40 minutes and with only a fraction of the fuel,
it becomes more than a tad unbelivable.

>[Regarding storing fuel as hydrogen...]

You mean water, right?

>What are "plenty good for other application"?  The purifiers?  If so, the
>answer is that you need to be able to store the hydrogen after you

A power plant with a rating of 1 for a 1000 T ship requires 10 T of hydrogen
in 4 weeks. A 5 T TL 15 fuel purifier can process 333 T in, what is it, 8
hours? (I can\'t find the exact time anywhere). Anyway, for any ship larger
than about a 1000 T (for TL 15; larger for lower TLs) the saving in volume by
carrying the hydrogen as water and processing it on the fly would easily
outweigh the volume taken up by the puel purifier. Assuming that you wouldn\'t
have the purifier anyway, in which case the saving applies to even the smallest
ship.

It leaves the jump drive functioning exactly as described and it resolves a
discrepancy in the rules at the expense of claiming that a TNS reporter
didn\'t know what he was talking about. What\'s so hard on canon about that?

Of course the black globe use is a sidelight. So what? The main point is
that if the jump drive capacitors can be used to store energy at all, it
should be a lot more than stated.

But that wasn\'t what I did. Instead I took a set of parameters and developed
a handwave that fitted all the parameters (something the original handwave
didn\'t).

>>We don\'t believe it could work the way it is described in CT
>
>Well, I don\'t agree that it couldn\'t work.

Right. In that case please reconcile these two facts:

1) The jump drive converts the fuel into energy and stores it in the jump
   capacitors.

2) The power plant fills the jump capacitors from its regular output in less
   than 40 minutes.

(I\'d also ask you to explain why, once the capacitors are filled, additional
fuel is still needed for some purpose which must be accomplished before the
ship enters jumpspace, but since you claim that this bit of canon is
inferior to other bits of canon, I\'ll let that one go for the moment.)

I\'ve obviously missed something here. What simple, intuitive change? I

Well, if you have a change that will fix the crack without having to
introduce \'access mass\', then that will obviously be preferrable. Provided
it does, indeed, fix it and provided that it dosen\'t introduce more
cracks elsewhere. Trot it out.

None of this, with two exceptions, cannot be accomodated by a theory that
expends a majority of the jump fuel for a purpose, other than converting it
to energy, which cannot be more efficiently performed by alternate methods
(like using it for coolant, for which a number of things would be better). 
The first thing is the jump on solar power alone, which, if true, implies
that the jump can be performed with just an ordinary power plant (the amount
of solar energy a ship like the Annic Nova can collect in six weeks can\'t be
all that much, can it?), so why would anyone bother about jump fuel in the
first place? (BTW. The capacitors on the Annic Nova must also be of a very
non-standard type, because they can store energy for jump over a six week
period whereas standard capacitors must do it in 40 minutes or less).
The other thing is the lack of any mention of differentiation in what the
fuel is used for, and that is just something you have to accept when you
make such a change.

Sorry. You\'re absolutely right. Let me rephrase that. If you assume that
jump torpedoes are very expensive (on the order of an equivalent jump drive
plus a bit more) and there is a small loss rate that does not apply to
manned ships (3% will do), then an X-boat network will demonstrably be
cheaper than an X-torp network. There may be other reasons why you don\'t
believe that X-torps are possible, but I don\'t know of any, though other
people think differently. Anybody interested should consult the archives
for an exhaustive (and I use the word deliberately) discussion of these
matters. They are also summed up in the FAQ, but you lose a lot of the
nuances ;-).

[Back to the jump drives]

Really? What page? I can\'t find it in my copy of "High Guard". Perhaps we have
different editions.

>The fact that the author stops to delineate what fuel is used for and fails

You\'re beating a dead horse. I have no doubt that the authors didn\'t intend the
jump drive to use most of the jump fuel for "access space" or anything else
exotic. If they did, they would have said so. But what is telling for me is
that they did introduce various rules that contradict each other unless one
assumes that most of the jump fuel is used for other purposes and, furthermore,
that said purposes couldn\'t be more efficiently accomplished by alternate
means.

So you either have to change one or more of the rules and keep the handwave or
change the handwave and keep all the rules. If you really think that changing
the rules is preferrable to changing the handwave, then so be it. But don\'t
claim that you can keep both the rules and the handwave, because it just
isn\'t so.

You\'re remembering the TNS release and you\'re 100% correct. It does say so.

It\'s pretty obvious to me that Herbert originally intended Children of Dune

Due to the fact that they\'re nothing like plasmaguns, they\'re plasmaguns
with an efficiency coefficient way beyound 100%. If you want cheap
spacevehicles, put a fusion drive on them.

Every starfleet needs a vast number of these unglamourous ships - although 
you never seem to see them in "Imperial Stars", "Strike Fleet", or any of the 
other popular VR entertainment programs in the Imperium.  Never mind 
that: without thousands and thousands of glorified cargo barges like these, 
the Imperial Navy would swiftly grind to a halt. 

First built in 138, these flying bricks perfectly reflect the big, bulky 
and dour design philosophy of the Vilani.  They also happen to be quite 
capable in their work: after all, 1000 years later they still serve in 
innumerable frontier fleets, as tankers and second-tier naval logstics 
vessels.
  
(In a pinch they can support Marine contigments, but lack the
armour to serve in any more hostile environment than your typical 
bushfire rebellion.  They also lack sufficent on-board cargo shuttles, 
and the Marines get to sleep in the cargo hold - hopefully modified to 
house them, rather than sleeping on the bare floor. 

The Orrimot DOES at least have CG lifters, unlike most dedicated space 
tankers/freighters.  So it can lift off, as well as land...)

These ships are rarely seen in civilian service: the two large hamster cages 
used to mimic gravity is rather unpopular among merchants, and civilian 
fuel stations have rendered tanker jumpships a poor economic gamble.  
Also, most merchants find the additional cost to maintain the inefficent 
dual fusion plants not worth the greater safety margin.  And the 10 
lifeboats are SO passe, and an unnecessary expense - although the crews 
doesn\'t seem to mind.

Funny thing happened at work\'s Christmas party.  Another driver and I
discovered we had both served as infantry in the US Army, and started
comparing notes.  Within minutes, we were speaking Armyese, complete with
borrowed German, Spanish, Korean, and vietnamese words and phrases.  On the
way home, Kirsten complained that no one could understand a thing we had
said to each other!

Makes you wonder what lingustic short-cuts the Imperial Navy and Marines
will develop.

The phrase "my bad", was popularized by rap artist/actor Will Smith (aka
"The Fresh Prince).  He used it on several songs, and it was a catch phrase
on his TV series "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air."

I believe the energy was stored in a battery array.  (How is it that I 
can speak in past tense about something that is suppose to happen in the 
future.  Should I have said \'the energy will be stored\'?)

I think that your questions are too broad astrographically.  Humans
develop whole languages relatively quickly when even small groups get
separated from other groups, and accents and regional dialects develop
still more quickly -- even with mass media to lend some measure of
consistency.  Rather than considering how people speak "behind the
claw", or in the Zhodani Consulate, we should probably be looking at how
people speak in the major cities of Regina versus the mines of Dinom
versus the outback of Emerald -- or even, how do Regina city-dwellers
sound compared to Regina miners and Regina farmers?  
Class (along with education) is another factor influencing accent.  The
head of the mining company and the city councillor both went to good
schools where they improved their high school Galanglic by broadening
their vocabularies and reaching certain standards of diction.  

Remember, on Earth today there are hundreds of separate, not mutually
understandable, languages, as well as many other languages that, while
separate, can be mutually understood.  (E.g., India uses English as a
common language in part because it has so many totally distinct
languages.)  Earth is probably a better template for Traveller languages
than it first appears.  The minor human races were seeded some 300,000
years ago, so their languages have had just as long to develop as
languages on Earth -- and their planets have had just as long and
complex political, military, religious, and social histories as Earth,
virtually guaranteeing the existence of many conflicting languages. 
Earth isn\'t as good a model for planets only recently colonized.  

This is a difficult problem in running NPCs in Traveller games.  My
players can\'t really distinguish my Menorbian nomad\'s accent from the
Regina street tough\'s.  

I haven\'t even addressed how non-human linguistics work.  My Vargr NPCs
sound a little like the dog Astro from The Jetsons.

Yes, we have rules much like that for nearly any sin in Islam (from choosing
edibles to self-defense while fasting), and I mean *nearly* any...  There
are some sins for which no such "hardship" permission is available and
you\'ll have to accept the consequences for your actions, as you choose, but

interpretations of fiqh -- but aren\'t there always?

future a heathen athiest?  ;-)  Just curious...

Or seven... but then again, what need would most scout teams have for
language (besides comminicating with the locals)?  Aren\'t they all part of
that fascist Imperial psionic conspiracy?  Or maybe they\'ve just spent far
too many years trapped in the same 100-ton tin can with each other (or
alone!)...

It might be hard to decipher that they were even speaking in that
"combination of growls, howls, screaches and whistles,
wind-moaning-in-the-trees noises, and hand-waving" (did I miss any non-human
major races?).

Mercenary had prices dropping 5-15% per TL, and full price items at 
higher techs incorporating improvements.  I can\'t recall if Striker 
includes such a rule <hangs head in shame> (Striker book 3 is my most 
worn CT book).

Not quite, unless you cross pump 2625 Cubic Meters or about 188 tons of fuel

Thank you. I like the HEPLaR as a back up/Afterburner type arrangement, for

Leftover preferences from a by-gone day. This is the second "published" ship

Well, if it\'s "My bag" this is referring to, I heard the expression a lot
in the Navy.  But then the USN isn\'t the best indication of any version of
English.

If memory serves me the power was stored in a power accumulator made up

I agree.  I created a sector just far enough from the Imperium and the
"canon" maps to be mysterious.  This sector has it\'s own political
climate, trade routes, and agendas.  The interaction with various "canon"
alien races and the Imperium creates interesting scenarios.

Diplomats trying to get the leaders of the sector to join them etc. 
Also, various counter groups within the sector with their own agendas as
well.  

Anyway my sector is "Spinward" a decent distance from the "Spinward
Marches".  (Left a few sectors) I\'ve always found the Spinward Marches to
be the most interesting sector.  Therefore, to get anywhere within reason
of the "canon" map the ships from my sector have to enter through the
Marches.

  It\'s reasonable to assume that the supposed zuchai crystal capacitors
are the only ones related to the Jump drive. Evidently their charging is
separate from the activation of the Jump drive; it may in fact be the
preliminary to using the J-drive. 

  The problem there is that the numbers in HG don\'t add up; the listed
charging period is not enough (by a factor of ten or so) to fill the HG 
designated capacitors. So, is that a glitch, or is the Jump drive an
internally-inconsistent super-fusion reactor that uses the majority of
the LHyd for coolant?

Is it possible that some of the illogical, incorrect, not neat, or not
economically feasible problems in canon could be explained by the "funny
business" that we can find in our own time:

- -deals done for political reasons that make no sense but have long term
effects
- -Scientists who lie or skew research results to get a grant or forward an
agenda
- -Nepotism, some bigwigs no talent son-in-law is put in position of power
- -Under the table bribes of officials swaying choices or gaining licenses

Need I go on.

I\'m not saying that the creators didn\'t legitimately make mistakes. 
However, these mistakes may add flavor to a campaign by using a
circumstance that could add intrigue to the game.

Just a thought.

You and me both, Marc.  I installed 4DOS 6.55 under windows 95 because I

I have yet to find any sort of program I can\'t run from Windows 95, with
some tinkering.  Yes, this counts clicking on icons that launch MS-DOS
mode first.  Some memorable toughies to run were Rennasaince\'s
Assembly-94 Demo and Future Crew\'s Unreal and Second Reality.

Yeah, but only if *you* want it to be.  The problem with trying to adhere
to canon strictly is you constrain your freedom to create.  Take the parts
of the Imperium, and it\'s history that you want and leave out the rest.

It\'s very easy to create your own sectors, and as for placing
them...just do it.

That\'s my Heretic answer. Now my orthodox one...

If I wanted to keep as much of the orthodox Imperium as possible, but keep
an open frontier, I\'d invalidate just the trailing-rimward end of the map. 


The K\'Kree and Hivers aren\'t all that important to Imperial History, and
making them small pocket empires bottlenecking an open frontier to trailing
works for me.

Moving the K\'kree coreward and leaving a gap between them and the Hivers
allows an opening out of the "trap" and frontier expansion to trailing. It
also puts the K\'kree closer to the Vargr and that has interesting
possibilites. ;->  Place new sectors in "The Gap" and beyond.

Well, except that I don\'t think the zuchai crystals will store energy
indefinately like the capacitors listed with the black globe.  It is
also mentioned that they are used only for jump drives (not to
store black globe energy).  Besides even if this wasn\'t true, you
would be basing everything on the assumption.

Or maybe you assumption is correct.  Or maybe the rest of the hydrogen
is converted to energy and used directly in the jump drive.

My my high school education in the projects,  this phrase was, as Zane explains,
"My Bag" to mean "my fault/mistake/etc."  Later, due to the illteracy of many,
it became "my bad" with the same meaning.  Of course, if said in the correct
vernacular, it is impossible to distinguish which version was spoekn.

Its certainly a lot better than "Oooh!  Crack your face!  Pick those pieces up
off the floor."  Or "For real?  You be lying."  - pronounced "F\'real? You be
Lion."

An early precursor of Aslan influence.

TL12 and down nuke det lasers go out to 15 000km, so I\'d suggest 20 or 25
000 km. If you\'re conservative, go for 50 000 km.

120 megajoules output ... you aint kidding when you call them light lasers.
120 MJ output is damage value ummm 28 or so, which means they can punch 1.5
cm of superdense or so. With any sane and reasonable combat system, this is
going to have a lot of trouble penetrating real armour.

OK. It is over-engineered, in that it has an effective range of seven
light-seconds or so. Drop the diameter down to give it a sane and
reasonable range - about a million kilometers sounds about right to me.

Megajoulage is about right, at TL maximum :)

One trick, if you have the spare area and volume in a bay or turret, is to
max out the limiting factor with Fusion+ units. This will reduce the load
on your main power plant.

But, no, I guess you\'re right.  Nobody\'s ever heard of Star Wars...  What

Unless of course it, as many things do, evolved in a parallel fashion in two
different cultures at once.

And what does the "illteracy" of many have to do with a phrase that is most
often heard not read?  But yes, your point about "illteracy" is well taken.

You mean TNE *scrapped* Thruster plates as canon because it wasn\'t
believeable or realistic and replaced it with something verging on broken?

Am I right in thinging that a Heplar drive is basically an add on block to
a fusion reactor now, not a separate  fusion reactor?

Well, regional accents form a very large part of internation in modern
Dublin (where we have at least 12 in the city alone), so we use them quite
a bit in the game.
I actually use Chinese, not Russian, for my Zhodani.
Sword Wolders do quite well with South African accents.
For Darrians I use a broad American accent.
For Vilani, particularly bureaucrats, I use a more whiny American accent.
Nobles of all races use a British accent.
Local indigents of all worlds have localised accents. I tend to mix and
match between various inner city Dublin accents for them.

Jo

99. Merchant Sign Language
     When making a sale dockside merchants will often work with more than
one person on a single customer. Each will hand over between them and hope
to wear them into accepting a sale. To coordinate clearly they have
developed an informal method of exchanging opinions non-verbally of how
they should progress the sale.
     Stroke the nose - Customer is not going to make a purchase, wind it
down.
     Tug the ear - Customer will buy at that price, keep talking.
     Rub the chin - Rescue me! Customer is just a talker, won?t buy and
won?t go.
     Tounge in left corner of mouth - raise the price/offer.
     Tounge in right corner of mouth - lower the price/offer.
     Finger tap on the right cheek - use a soft-sell approach
     Scratch bridge of nose - go for a hard sell
     Rub forehead - make the final offer
     Scratch left ear - sweeten the deal
     Crack knuckles - my turn to talk

Actually, I find "The Moon Is a Harsh Mistres" to be the best example.
It\'s a great example of linguistic mixing. Yet it can be understood
with a bit of effort. 

Invent something like that for some common culture and you might wind
up with your players speaking it.

I would assume so. Of course, very little deteroiration is likely at
that depth. Between the cold and the lack of oxygen, most corrosion is
driven by biological mechanisms.

No luck. But the last position info is considered *very* untrustworthy

Orbits only decay under rather special circumstances. Otherwise the

That\'s Old English (aka Anglo-Saxon). "Dost thou..." is *modern*
English. Chaucer is Middle English, and probably at the extreme for
likely drift between now and the Imperium

Remember, printing slowed the rate of change considerably. We are
farther from Shakespeare than he was from Chaucer, yet we can read his
works with little trouble. 

Audio and video recording are slowing things even further. It\'s highly
unlikely that we\'ll get any major shifts in the *language*. What we may
get is more streamlining of grammar and a lot of vocabulary changes.

This is a good solution, but is really not necessary if you go to 3
dimensions.  The overlying and underlying sectors of the standard
Imperial map give a huge amount of growing space without moving the
aliens.  New directions are GalNorth/GalSouth. 
 To imagine this imagine nestling small spheres next to the big spehere
of the Imperium.  Where the small spheres dont block the Imperium has
expanded out some, providing lots of frontier.
The problem is the falsehood of a 3 dimensional universe where we all
know it is flat;)

In answer to your first question, just under the speed of light.

If all you want is contact, then just launch a small ship with a double
100,000 AU transceiver.

At TL9 using a Bussard ram jet engine, a ship could reach better than 98%
the speed of light.  Spanning a parsec would take less than 5 years at 1G.

Not really.  most human activities are influenced by superstition.  For
example, Michael Jordan wears his University of North Carolina basketball
shorts under his Bulls\' uniform for every game.  He thinks they help him
keep his youth.  I know several pilots who will not fly if certain rituals
are not followed.

despite my level of training and experience, i was convinced I would never
hit a target with a M-21 unless my spotter and I quoted Monty Python just
before the shot.

I doubt it.  I use the plain-text mode and don\'t get any complaints.  If he
does need to change back to rich text format, then probably I do to.  If we
do, let us know.

I suspect that Haegan was only curious as to what he was missing.  If so,
then I believe I can reasure him that he\'s not missing a thing.  Like J-Man
said, it\'s just a format incompatability.  Someone is sending information
that your system can\'t use, so it tacks it on just incase you need it for
something else.

>And to Herr Koehne - flames and personal attacks for someone else\'s

Did I miss something?  Has Michael sent a message I didn\'t get?  I haven\'t
seen anything from him yet today.  Or is there another Herr Koehne on the
list that I don\'t know about?  If you are talking about J-Mann\'s (oops in
the German mode there, that should be J-Man\'s) response, I don\'t think it
was intended as a flame or a personal attack.

When I first started using the internet, I used to get winmail.dat
attachments on my email from a friend when he was at work and none when he
was at home.  I quoted a couple back to him and he said it was exactly what
was sent.  So, I followed J-Man\'s advice before he gave it.  It didn\'t seem
to affect anything, so I just ignored it.  If the email itself didn\'t say
there was an attachment, I didn\'t look at the attachments from him from
work.

I think you\'re being a little oversensitive Walt.  I\'m not being critical.
Really I\'m not.  We all have to deal with incompatibility issues from time
to time.  If we could learn a lesson from our computers, perhaps things
would go better.  The lesson we could learn is illustrated by this
winmail.dat attachment.  His computer can\'t fully use what someone else\'s
computer is sending (probably not yours Walt), so it just ignores it and
does it\'s job, but keeps it in case it\'s needed for something else.

If we were more like that, I think things would probably be a little easier
on all of us.

<preacher mode OFF>

I\'m sorry I got so long winded there.  I wouldn\'t have, but, I bet Michael
will feel a little upset when he reads the missive that lead to my response.
J-Man too if he thinks your response was directed at his attempt to offer a
word of helpful advice.

Actually, it wouldn\'t.  Unrefined fuel usage is almost always
froma gas giant which is mostly hydrogen and the premise would
be that urefined fuel is using that hydrogen without processing

I don\'t know about "against".  The implication is that the volume
is the "most important" variable so it, at least, add things not
previously addressed.

	I\'m have a site in UseNet for nearly 10 years. The best thing to
	say about the old net was, that is was imposible for windummys
	to use it. Its imho a shame for your university to use MicroSoft
	and not a Unix system, and its even more shame that its badly
	configured. Unlike you I have to pay for my phone, and for my
	diskspace. I\'ve received about 100 copies of that junk within
	the last weeks. And the number are steady growing as are the
	numbers of WinDummies in the Net - Its a bit like running
	against windmills, I think I will have to install a filter.

	Ok to be constructive :

	Take the flames - PRINT THEM - and put them on the desk of
	your system operator with the request, to solve the problem
	IMEDIATE!

PS : Its of course a shame for me, that I\'m wasting time and space with
     this posting. Previous flames to him have been private, but he has
     adressed my name here in public. I would prefer that followup
     flames use the private way as usual to reduce noise on the TML.

In FF&S2 mass is only a consideration for impulse engines.  Jump drives are
strictly a matter of volume as they always have been.

I didn\'t mean this as a serious treatment of the linguistic elements
involved!  Gack!  I\'ll leave that to Kenji and the boys on the travlang list
(I only lurk there).  There\'s no feasible way of EVER doing that for the
10,000 worlds of the Imperium, any Imperium.

*snicker*  The problem is, yes, NPCs, and in my own humorous way (humorous
to me ;-) I was asking the populace at large how many of them even bother
trying to feign accents to differentiate different "nationalities" (for lack
of a better term)...  Along the same lines as the discussion of scents and
scent memories that recently took place on the Dark Conspiracy list.  (I
covertly open the vial of Chanel No. 5, and a chill horror begins to fill
the room...)

I think you\'ve got the right idea with Rover there.  That\'s what I was
talking about.

Heh.  I love the command line (*nix or dos), but I\'ve recently discovered
that it doesn\'t work with some hardware the way one might expect (Iomega Zip
drives)...  The whole reason that I have begun posting again instead of
trying in vain to wade through the 50MB of TML I accumulated from November
to January was that COPY in a batch file managed to trunk the email file
from 48418 bytes to 11 bytes.  Heh.  Read all of real quick like.  ;-(  One
more example of failed backward compatibility, and my ability to read the
documentation.  [That\'s the one thing that\'s so eerie about Macs...  No
command line that I can find.]  "Don\'t use copy from DOS" in the readme
should\'ve been my first clue.  Heh.

We discussed programs last year a couple of times...  I\'m thinking about
imposing on o/s upgrade on my PCs ship; easy to do since only two of the PCs
are even part owners in the ship.  Heh.  Or is that too evil?

I agree 100%. But you *can* have different original premises, few in
number, that give the effect required.

The theory I like requires just *2*:

1. To enter and remain in jumpspace, you need to create an exotic
particle field surrounding the ship.

2. Jumpspace matter interacts violently with normalspace neutrons. The
"pressure" of jumpspace matter is such that some sort of non-reactive
barrier (read: protium) is required in order to keep the aforementioned
field stable, and jumpspace matter at bay.

Hans\' theory requires hydrogen to "punch" a hole into jumpspace, and
works equally well.

from those two (just 2!) premises, entire reams of jumpspace theory
explaining the little details can flow... (which I have posted earlier)

The grid generates the field to enter jumpspace, the hydrogen is
required to keep the field stable. They coexist easily and intuitively.

I have no beef with your point of view, btw. I disagree with the notion
that this hydrogen atmosphere hypothesis has no merit. You\'ve yet to
convince me that there are holes in this "theory".

From: "Richard A. Flores" <cybernot@gte.net>
Subject: Silent auction

Hello all,

I actually used a somewhat similar system on one
world. (Note this system took place outside starport-
you could conduct normal trading from starport, but
the potential for profit was MUCH bigger outside,
using the locals\' trading customs).

It went like this.....
The crew went from the starport into the capital city
to find a likely buyer for their trade goods after being
told of the lucrative, but quirky, market to be found 
there. They were shown into a large hostelry, with 
lots of secluded booths around an open plan centre.
The booths looked to be filled with affluent people, the
tables in the centre being occupied with much lowlier
looking patrons. On arrival they were met by a hostess
who judged them to be worthy of a mid-room table.
When they asked her about the situation she told them
that her job was as an intermediary between off-worlders
such as themselves and other mercantile businesses.
(open trade between businessmen was a taboo for their
culture- creating a special class of citizen - a go-between)*

It all boiled down to the character\'s generosity in tipping
the hostess to attract the attention of potential buyers.
The more she got tipped- the harder she traded for them.
For game purposes I treated it just like they were using
her services just like a broker\'s, and for every 5% of
final selling price she was offered, they had +1 to the
actual value table (using MT rules). 

It ended up as a very interesting nights role-playing. 
Their particular hostess went home with a very large
smile on her face, and the characters made a killing.
The players loved it, because it showed another side 
to trading that they had never \'really\' experienced before
...many beers were consumed, and all in all it was a good 
laugh!- must have been, \'coz they kept plotting that world
in their trade runs for ages after.
I admit that my cargo spreadsheet took most of the 
repetetive work away from me, and let us get on with 
role (rather than roll) playing.

*(another taboo was that the \'hostess\' who\'d done the selling
was not allowed to act as their \'buyer\'- bad business practice
in the eyes of the citizenry)

Cheers

So you\'re set to UU?  Why?  Do you have to communicate with Groupwise users?
MIME should be your choice, I would think, unless you have other
circumstances.

You might consider also a .pab "internet address" entry for TML and unselect
"Always send rich text format" when you post directly.  If you\'re sending it
as part of replies, something else is wrong.  (I\'m using Outlook, and I
don\'t think anyone is getting them from me.)  Which version of Outlook are
you using?  Get 8.03 if you don\'t have it.  Mail me directly
(dreed@shellus.com) if you\'re lost already.  ;-)

Anyway, when you reply to a message Outlook should return it in the same
format that it was sent, unless you manually change the format/font/etc.

Actually, that is what is known as "psychological focusing" and while no
one knows exactly how that works, it just does.  You tell yourself, "if
I do this, I will not miss" and you don\'t.  I think it\'s tied in to how
the sub-conscious affects the conscious mind.

Rather than postulate a Trek-style \'purple barrier\', you might consider an
idea that Glenn Hoppe and I developed: the concept of "Jump Planes". These
planes divide the galaxy up like a layer-cake of multiple levels. Thus, on
the level represented by the canonical Imperial maps, you can access
jumpspace; but a few parsecs up or down you can\'t. A few more parsecs up or
down, and jumpspace is again accessible. We handwaved this by supposing
that jumpspace is a phenomenon generated by a very large, spinning mass,
such as the black hole at the galaxy\'s centre. It creates these planar
disk-shaped regions (or, more accurately, parabolic regions projecting from
the core singularity) of alternating jump planes and slowspace planes.

We also suggested that very massive stars (say, some O and B types, over 4
solar masses) create local distortions in the planes, which cause separate
jump planes to overlap - thus providing bridges or junctions between the
planes.

The cool thing with this idea is that it allows you to have a 3D campaign
without mucking around with 3D coordinate maps or computer models; you can
use canonical flat sector maps, but multiple levels of them. You can\'t jump
between levels except via the junction stars, so you don\'t have to worry
about the relative position of stars that are on different planes.

For more, see Glenn Hoppe\'s Jumpspace web-site.

There isn\'t a very easy solution to this unless you have a computer.  At

rotate 3D starmaps.  The problem comes in that you can\'t see depth on a
2D screen unless you can rotate the "box" of stars.  Then you can
percive the relative postions.

On paper you could over and underly normal 2D sector maps, but then you

That is an ok handwave.  But I\'m working on fixing the problem and will
solve it to my satisfaction within a year.
I\'m thinking along lines of cubic sectors with very high resolution
isometric illustrations.  Joining sectors would be problemtic, but since
each sector would have a coordinate and each world its own
(x,y,z)position in its sector, it will be straighforward to figure
distances.

Jump drives will be variable and work much like a former poster stated-
with a range variable around the standard canon range, directly
proprotional to the lenght of the wormhole the drive can bridge/tunnel.

3D is allowing me to put in diverse objects, rifts, dust clouds and cool
stuff that doesnt show up on the normal Trav maps.  If you really like
SF this is the way to go.  2D is gameable but I figured out it didn\'t
work right when I was 15. 

If you want, just photocopy your Trav 2D\'s onto transparencies for
comparing navigation in the vertical.  Then you don\'t have to thow any

Yes, I heard this too, and can\'t figure out WHY?  I must admit, the idea

Well in the case of the DEMOS, I wanted to see how much better they ran
on a Pentium-100 with 81megs ram and a 4meg PCI grfx card, then the
486/33 with 4megs ram and 1meg ISA video card they were designed for.

I too, must confess a bit of confusion.  I re-read the previous messages
several times looking for the "flame" reference, but did not find one. 
Yes, I am anti-microsoft, but specifically, anti-internet explorer.  I
htankfully use all other Microsoft products but Internet Explorer IS
crap.  The early versions are full of security holes and the latest will
gradually wipe your system out.  (took about 2 months on my system). 
Netscape is obviously a much superior product but it looks like Netscape
is throwing in the towel to Microsoft.  This is a very bad thing.

I love this!  Now all we need is an Ancient device that will allow us to

Not understandable?  In 3000 years I think we may know something more
about electromagentics, gravity and the fundamentals of our universe
than we do now.

Physics fails to explain jumpspace?
The real theory of hyperspace is growing.  It is called string theory
and simply says the universe is not 4 dimensions but instead
11(minimum.) It appears this is the fabric of the universe.

This comes from the idea that in multi dimensional math the equations
that govern electromagnetics and gravity can be nicely summed up into
matrix of higher dimensions.  And that is "jumpspace"-"inside" space.
All those other dimensions are curled up or collapsed on themselves, but
through jump drive are accesible for travel.

Some of you\'se guys can take your anicents handmedowns, but I\'m gonna
build my own jumpdrive that works on real, hard principles.  And I\'m
going to improve it, because I know how it works.  And my starship
engineers can rip this stuff down, rebuild it and make it hum while
corresponding with Depot and the Jumpspace Institute development teams
because they are not mystical shamans praying to the black box. 
Terrans(at least) conquered jumpspace in 2087 through advances in the
hyperspace theory we are beginning now.

Of course a lot of people feel the same way about electronics and
computers as you folks are talking about jdrives, and what do you think
of that?  

Jump drive is a tool, understood in the 56th century not perfectly but
well enough to be used and improved and speculated on.

Linguists Morris Swadesh and Robert Lees devised an approach in the 1940s
which determined the rate at which a language changes over the centuries.
They posited that the more cognates (i.e., shared words) between two
languages the more recently the langauages have diverged.

(To illustrate, the Italian "padre" and the Portugese "pai" are
cognates...but the Esquimo "ataataq" is not a cognate.  Further, if two
languages spoken today share 70% cognates, they probably diverged 1000
years ago.)

The approach is controversial and does indeed reflect Earth\'s climate,
geography and political history...but perhaps may be used for Traveller
purposes (muatatis mutandis).

Using the chart below, referees can calcuate how unitelligibly colonies
lost during the Rule of Man speak English (or Turkish).  Or how many
cognates exist between English and Vilani (perhaps a little under 1%!).
And myriad other uses, to be sure.  Enjoy!

As you can tell, my Zip Drive is "F:".  C and D are my 2.1 gig hard
drives and E is my 24x Cdrom.  this program works really good for my
needs, EXCEPT when I re-config my system and re-install things, and
forget to edit where the Zip Drive gets placed.  Example, say it was
drive E next time.  Hehe, jcopy.bat won\'t work too well trying to write
to the CDROM drive.

As for other DOS things, I use the following aliases :

S=`INPUT Filename: %%THE_FILE^LIST %THE_FILE`
W=`INPUT Filename: %%THE_FILE^*W %THE_FILE`
C=`INPUT Destination: %%DRIVE^SELECT COPY (*.*) %DRIVE`
M=`INPUT Destination: %%DRIVE^SELECT MOVE (*.*) %DRIVE`
D=SELECT DELETE (*.*)
R=`INPUT Old Filename: %%F^INPUT New Filename: %%NF^RENAME %F %NF`
E=`INPUT Archive Name: %%F^ARJ y -je %F `
T=`INPUT File To Try: %%F^pkunzip %F d:\\dl\\temp`
B=`DIR *.GIF^INPUT GIF Filename: %%F^INPUT New BMP Filename: %%NF^BMPIT
%F %NF`

You\'ll notice DELETE and not DEL, I use a program that moves files in
DOS to the RECYCLE BIN just like deleting files in Windows, because
there have been times I accidentally deleted files I needed, and unlike
previous versions of DOS, DOS 8.0 does not have the UNDELETE function.

The rename command up there works for directory names as well.  Just
type : \'dirname.\'  and no extension, as the old filename, and a new
\'dirname.\' for the new name.

What the rest do is put up a menu of sorts that you can navigate with
cursor keys over the file list, selecting files with SPACEBAR and ENTER
to perform the action.

Take my word for it, if someone has just upgraded to Outlook, they don\'t know
they are sending the Winmail.dat file.  Hell, this is what I do for a living,
and it took me 3 weeks to figure it out why the system suddenly started spewing
them out (albeit, it was a year ago).  And I got such a rash from certain
members of the list I almost dropped off of it (if I hadn\'t been able to do the
majority of my TML at work on a UNIX system, I probably would have).  It is a
published bug with the program that is specific to \'REPLY-TO\' addressees.

Unix isn\'t required to use the list.  Admittably, we (MS users) need to
configure our mail programs to the _lowest_ common denominator, but there is no
reason to beat up on people who are not even aware of what their mail program is
doing.  (and there are other mail programs that spew html format, which I find
personally annoying...)  And for the few of you who are gathering breath to drop
the hammer on how everyone should know exactly what their email program
does...please calm down.  No matter how much we may wish it, the internet is no
longer the exclusive domain of the computer-elite.  While the downside of this
can be seen in the level of conversation that occurs out on the bulk of USENET,
it also allows for many creative people who really don\'t care what their
computer does, or how it does it, access to forums such as our own.  It also
means that those of us with a clue, need to help those creative people who don\'t
care about their computer software (other than it being the latest and
greatest), but can contribute in other ways.

I hereby volunteer (that means no charge) to assist any TMLer having problems in
Outlook to reconfigure their software so as to _not_ annoy the
\'I\'ve-been-here-forever-and-you-should-be-using-what-I-use-because-it-works-for-me\'
list members (sounds kinda Vilani-ish, don\'t you agree?).
So from now on, when someone starts posting winmail.dat files, politely point
them to me (or directly to the MS site for the Office 97 SR) and let\'s keep the
OS wars out in the flam...I mean newsgroups where they belong.

I will take any comments about this post offline, my email address is at the
bottom.

OBTraveller: How do you suppose the Imperium handles software upgrades?  Is the
computer hardware OS-independant?  Is there one Megacorporation (Imperial
Business Machines?) that cornered the starship computer market early in the
Imperium\'s history that keeps the releases compatible?  Or is the software you
buy in one Sector going to be compatible with what you buy in another Sector?

Well, the issue is not that the theory would be OK on it\'s own.

Well, no.  The problem is that the previous constraints for
the field theory make you do things that don\'t follow from
a "ballast" theory.  It does not follow inuitively that 
ballast has to be hydrogen (yes, you can come up with
rationalizations, but that is the point, you do have to
come up with them).  It doesn\'t follow intuitively that 
you would be getting energy signature when you come out
of jump space rather than matter.  When you center the
theory around one effect, and then also require another
effect (the lanthanum grid) it isn\'t as simple.  Etc.

The problem, as I see it, is not so much "holes", but that
you need to patch and fill to stick it into the requirements.
I don\'t have any problem with the "bubble theory" if you
wanted to build a background consistently around it from
the ground up, but if you want to make changes to an
existing background they should be as small and simple
as possible (many of the holes we are looking at, like
drop tanks, seemed like equally good ideas at the time :-).

OK. Now we know who\'s responsible.

First of all, Fusion Plus is a marginal advantage to the TL12 Imperium.
Compared to the TL12 Nuclear Damper, the TL12 Meson Screen and the TL-12
Jump-3, it is an afterthought on the list of Sylean direct military
advantages vis a vis the Outworlds.

Fusion plus is a mere 380% efficiency increase on TL12 batteries for the
first hour of operation, or a mere 900% efficiency increase on TL12 fuel
cells.

It does not allow the impossible, as nuclear dampers, the meson screen and
the Jump-3 drive do.

Secondly, the concept of the Fighter, so lauded in the propaganda of the
Imperium, if fatally flawed by the fact that a fighter, by it\'s very
nature, is limited to laser and missile armament - it does not have the
length to mount PAWS or Meson Guns that will have a signifigant range in
combat.

Now, this wouldnt be so much of a problem, except that the cheapest missile
with other than a primitive engine one can build now costs MCr 2.5 with
thruster plates and fusion plus, or MCr 2 with a hot fusion engine and
Heplar. And thats before the warhead. Add in a nuke det laser warhead and
you can add a megacredit to the price. Volume is 10m3 minimum for either
the t-plates or the hot fusion plant, so a TL12 missile isnt going to get
within cooo-eee of the half a displacement ton of a "standard shipboard
missile".

Lasers, too, are limited in megajoulage by TL, which means the most
powerful laser that can be built is 600 megajoules. 600 megajoules output
will not penetrate 5 cm of superdense armour, unless we wave our hands and
rule that all sheet armours ablate and get thinner when hit but not penetrate.

Thirdly, TL9-10 ships are not neccessarily big. TL9-10 ships that need to
get out of 100 diameter gravity wells are, in order to use Fusion maneuver
drives, but a ship designed to operate between, say, Jupiter Belt on Sol
and Mitcheson Belt on Alpha Centauri could well be 200 dtons. It is just if
you have to get out of a gravity well before next week, you need to get big
enough to profitably use a Fusion m-drive. I would imagine such belts would
have many small traders who do the interstellar runs, and a few large
insystem craft that move the goods to the mainworld.

Finally, you dont need Fusion Plus to build a t-plate powered small craft.
4000 kN of t-plates needs 10 MW of power. 10m3/60t of fission plant will
provide this, and 40m3/80t of TL11 batteries will provide 40 MW a second
for an hour - enough to power a 250 MJ "standard" laser for a shot ever 32
seconds or so.

Ian Whitchurch

PS You also dont need Fusion Plus for grav tanks etc - use explosive power
generators or Chemical Laser Cartridges for the main armament, and 10 MW of
fission plant power a lot of contragrav modules.

PPS It is intriguing how Heplar, a TL10 technology, will come into it\'s
peak of use at TL13 and beyond, as 1m3 and smaller fusion plants make
Heplar missiles and small craft economic.

    'body' => 'Why build fighters?  

Well, let me start by saying why we use them today.  They are
comparatively 
cheap compared to the price of a ship and can carry armament that can
effectively "mission-kill" most capital ships in existence today.

While I was on patrol in the Carib last year, my brother
sent me an e-mail off of this list concerning Battleships
alleging that very large ships held no advantage other than 
being flashy.  The writer opined that the optimum size for
a battleship was in the 30,000 to 50,000 ton range using 
reasoning that was apparently based on the MT or CT spinal
mount tables.  He stated that at this size you could obtain
a "decent" spinal mount, ship, etc...

Within that context, I would concede the writer\'s point.  However
that context is itself incorrect because it assumed an arbitrary
"off-the-shelf" spinal mount maximum size and didn\'t specify the
most critical factor in modern weapon design, which is range.

The ship which accurately fires first often is the one which fires last.
Given the design tables in FF&S (either version) there would exist a
continuous pressure to build ships of ever greater length to support
the development on the massive spinal mounts that formed their cores.
The needle design is the most efficient for this purpose, perhaps
along with the long wedge, since it gives the greatest maximum 
weapon length per volume.

Battle riders, constrained by their tender lengths and the requirement
for nesting, would necessarily be constrained in length and
therefore have a much shorter "first hit" range than dreadnoughts.
In other words, they would die in a fight without ever getting a shot 
off.  This concept, "standoff distance" would ensure that longer ships
have an advantage in deep space combat and battle become ranging duels.

This mirrors the way battleship development progressed during the
first half of this century, although the critical factors included
armor penetration as well.  This would be true for the weapons I am
talking about as well.

For the BR concept to be effective, jump tenders would have to carry
very "long" BRs, perhaps 2-4 and the JT would have to be a lattice
like dispersed skeletal structure much like the Valley Forge from Silent
Running.

With ships this massive, the fighter would cease to be a major
asset in large fleet actions as it would carry armament incapable
of inflicting significant damage on large ships.

Fighters would be valuable for patrol work, system interdiction, 
anti-piracy patrols off of a larger launch platform.

    'body' => 'Yes, life can indeed be interesting at lower TL\'s if you like small
potent ships (like me -- on both counts), but here are a few design
concepts I\'ve monkeyed with:

1) The HIW (High-Energy Weapons) Interceptor. So the smallest fusion
plant you can get at TL10 is about 36 tons. Big deal. If you get lemons,
make lemonade -- wrap a 90-ton fighter around it armed with a blistering
array of laser turrets. Jack the rate of fire as far up as you please.
You now have Power To Burn.

2) What\'s Wrong With Fission? Nothing, as long as you don\'t mind
inflicting a Chernobyl on yourself every time a bad guy shoots one of
your fighters down. So build orbital stations to park them on, or put
them aboard grav-only fighter carriers. No problemo. Twenty or thirty of
these will represent enough hell to wreck anybody\'s afternoon.

However, this is a poor solution compared to...

3) Internal Combustion: The Affordable Power Plant! Won\'t all your smug
Fusion Plus neighbors in bed with the Imperium be surprised when you
field an environmentally safe, fiendishly maneuverable fleet of grav
fighters powered by MHD turbines (refer to the Central Supply Catalog).
A 30-ton fighter at 6 gees requires an 1800-ton drive of some sort; if
plain old contra-grav, that requires 24mw of power, which can be
supplied by a mere 3-ton MHD requiring 3.5 tons of fuel PER TEN HOURS,
including the extra oxygen you need to make the bugger run in deep
space. Your fighter is now ridiculously cheap and readily available
(TL8) and it turns and it burns and it makes cool screeching sounds like
an M-1 tank. Rad. Low-tech pocket empire kicks Imperial puppet heinie.
News at 11:00.

None of which solves the problem of deep-space travel. For commercial
purposes, how about a binary drive -- a 1G anti-grav drive (powered by
fission or MHD) combined with a 1G fusion rocket to nudge it out of the
gravity well? Or a fusion-rocket-equipped \'ferry\' to cart jump-capable
trading ships in and out of the gravity well so they can jump?

And if you\'re going to do that last, why not go the whole hog and apply
the battlerider concept to commercial transport? and have JUMP ferries
that take whole squadrons of small trade vessels from world to world on
pre-scheduled routes? Makes buying a free trader (now a glorified
shuttle) much cheaper... what better way for a low-tech goverenment to
subsidize trade than to build a few of these behemoths and cart civilian
ships around? Puts interstellar trade within the reach of the common
man... stimulates tourism (any dork who can buy a ticket to orbit can
now go anywhere, if he\'s willing to wait for the right ship)... how very
enlightened of them... think it over. 

For military applications, of course, fusion rockets remain the only way
to go. Again, you gotta keep them away from your worlds, or Greenpeace
will complain and skin cancer rates will soar. Our hypothetical 30-ton
fighter would need a 14-ton rocket that costs 70 MCr. Argh. (Well, not
so bad when compared to 20th-century fighters. How much of an F-15\'s
bulk is taken up by ITS jet engines? And the sonofabitch can cost almost
80 million bucks if it\'s the latest model... naturally a spaceworthy
version MIIIIGHT cost a BIT more. Everything\'s relative. Consider that
at this TL the smallest possible fusion plant runs a cool 100MCr). 

The fringe benefit is that it generates 36Mw of surplus power -- an
interesting and colorful handicap, if used to power your fighter\'s
armaments and you can\'t fire unless you\'re at a certain amount of
thrust.... "I\'ve been hit! I\'m only at three gees! My main laser battery
is hosed!"

I wish I had some designs to send you, but I don\'t. The dipshit
multiplicity of incompatible design systems in this game have seen to
that. I\'m waiting patiently for M. Miller to ride to the rescue (?) with
T4.1 before I commit myself. (Please, God, oh PLEASE let it include
small craft). Until then, weird ideas are all I can offer. Here\'s hoping
one of them proves some use. If you don\'t have any of the books, email
me and I\'ll give you the exact stats on the power plants I mentioned.

Enemies of one side could have supplied the other side with arms and

Just a thought.

Carriers are the new wave of ship-to-ship warfare, just ask the japanese
who thought they had eliminated our naval power in the pacific theatre
of world war II by sinking our capital ships in Peral Harobor, while our
carriers were out on manuevers.  With only carrier and a small handful
of capital ships left, the US Navy was forced to do a paradigm-shift
about how naval battle was to be conducted, and found out there is a
distinct advantage in Carrier vs Capital ship.  Carriers cost less, they
are faster and more manueverable, and can strike from a safe distance.

This has been debated in the Wing Commander books as well, with the
Kilrathi dealing a deadly first blow to the Human Confederation because
the humans believed Capital ships were the end-all of warfare.

You are correct.  Your memory serves you well (I had to look it up).  
The storage device seems to be \'several solid silver buss bars\'.  They 
are, however, located under the canopy created by the solar collectors 
and not under the astrogation dome.

   I\'m not so sure about that.  With the conquest of the First Imperium,
English would absorb a large number of Vilani words (as it absorbed a
large number of French words after the Norman Conquest).  During the
isolation of Long Night, regional dialects would almost certainly arise,
eventually leading to different gramatical structures, variations in
spelling, pronunciation, useage and so forth.  Galanglic therefore would
first appear in the early Third Imperium as a "pigeon" dialect that is
in reality an amalgamation of all of those new forms of English (which
would be as similar to each other as Spanish, Portugese, and Italian are
today).  Over the course of the next few hundred years Galanglic would
attain a status as a language in its own right, and evolve as new words
are imported from Vargr, Zhodani, Aslan, etc.

   It slows it, but not to the degree you\'re thinking.  School children
today have trouble with some parts of Shakespeare, and it\'s not because
of outcome based-education.  The rules for useage and words in the
common language have already changed that much.

   Considering that the Imperial year 1116 is about 5634 AD, or about
3,632 years away (3,632 years ago would be 1634 BCE, before the Saxons
or Angles even showed up on the shores of the North Sea IIRC), I would
expect that even with mass communications I would have as much trouble
speaking to my great+ grandchildren as I would talking to the writer of
Beowulf, perhaps a little less if they stayed on Terra and didn\'t move
to Sylea, or some other world many parsecs away.

"In the beginning there were the little black books, and the number of the

without guidance and many great adventures where had. Then after a number

In the very early days of Traveller, there was no official setting and
everyone had to create their own sectors and settings from the ground up.
(Andy Slack published a first class article in one White Dwarf magazine
on how to do this called "Backdrop of the Stars")

I wonder how many players still use their own settings? I can think of a
least three off the top of my head.

Actually, there is a method for charting stars 3 dimensionally on a flat
surface, but it doesn\'t work with the constraints of hexes.  See the
subsector illustrated below.

Unfortunately with starmaps as shown, there are no clear relationships (to
our 2 dimensional thinking) between the stars distances.

I guess you take your simplifications and pay with realism.  Oh well.

To my way of thinking, it\'s the differences that make the game sooo much
fuuuun.

I would think that if you work for or sell to the Imperium, that you would
be required to provide products that were compatable with Imperial
standards.  As stodgy as the Imperial types are, I would think that changes
would be very sssllllooooowwwwww.

In my campaign, the Imps have access to a great deal of ancient data and
warehouses full of artifacts.  As much as possible, they would design
Imperial Standards to be forward compatable with as much of this stuff as
they can.

OTOH, the people at large, will have to either conform to ImpStd or deal
with the kind of compatability problems we deal with.

	ups, Marc is violating CT canon ? why that ? I\'ve just managed

	size for TL:A is 10kdt, for TL:B 50kdt, for TL:C 100kdt and for
	TL:D 1Mdt. So any techlevel gives the advantage of building larger
	ships. Besides that old FFS was sufficient to limit minimum size
	for fighters. A RamPart was only posible at TL:15, lower techlevels
	will have 20dt as minimum effective size. Now the RamPart is posible
	at TL:C, which I cant call canon from MT references and TNE design.

	The new FFS2 minimum for fusion plants will also make ships like
	the TL:A-200dt Yacht imposible, which is a classical design.

That, Sir I take as a challange :*>. I already have a number of small low

    Well... there might be an obscure canon source that one can prove anything
from.  Kinda like bible lawyers.  If you want to find something hard enough
you\'re probably gonna going to find it.  Especially in something that\'s been
around as long as Traveller.
    Jump drive is supposed to take alot of fuel.  It\'s been long established
that noone has gone past Jump 6.  Somewhere it\'s been said that J7 is
impossible.  Some places just don\'t say anything about it at all.  It always
takes a week (plus a minor variation).  Some sources said there\'s Zuchai
crystals. Some don\'t mention em at all.  All that\'s important is that it
works.  :::insert your favorite handwave here::: 
    A babylon 5 like Hyperspace (also in Star Control 2) is popular now.  How
it works?  Who knows?  It looks cool, though.  If something is overdesigned
people are going to try and pick it apart, for various reasons.  Exactly what
happened w/ Virus.  People who know just enough to be dangerous say "nope
can\'t be done" when it\'s really just a lack of imagination.
     But Jump grids?  I started Traveller w/ TNE.  Don\'t need Jump grids,
though i\'m kinda partial to the idea.  I\'ve gathered various CT and MT
products.  I see no mention of jump grids in Supplement 9: Fighting Ships.( i
just managed to get a copy... : ) ).  Neat background info (why i got it) but
all the stats are pretty much worthless to me.  All of the MT mentions i\'ve
seen are negligible except for the Starship Operators Manual.  I like the idea
of reactionless drives.  I\'m not going to invalidate the rather extensive
collection of designs i have to put in jump grids or t-plates.  Most of em...
there\'s plenty of surface area leftover... but not always... especially on the
larger ships.  I can simply put T-plates at tl 17 or 18 or 19 where i think it
belongs.
     Unless someone puts together a "Traveller Writers Guide" things are going
to keep straying.  The toll of time puts all of these rare collectors items
that told all kinds of info about all kinds of thing are slowing going the way
of the dodo.  I don\'t think detailing every piece of Traveller hardware is a
good idea.  Computers, FTL, even STL thrust should remain vague, follow
science as we know it now as closely as possible until real high tech, and
make for a playable game. : )  3D would be nice, but how can someone model it
w/o bringing a computer along w/ em?

I don\'t think this should\'ve ever been done.  Worse than TNE ditching T-

I agree entirely. The MT Imperial Encyclopedia tells that Cleon eventually
ended up w/ control of the Sylean Federation.  Though his control, the
Federation increased in size until he didn\'t think it was suitable for his
needs anymore (ruling an Interstellar Empire). He claimed to be a lawful
successor of the first two Imperiums and laid claim to all their old
territory.  Then... being the biggest baddest guys around, they absorbed the
others.  There was no need for TAKAFP.  They came, they saw, they conquered.
Did they need a trick up their sleeve?  Not IMO.  Just a war machine,
motivation to use it, and resistance too weak to stand against them.  Canon
*didn\'t* say so either, but out of sight, out of mind.... : )

If jumpspace is two dimensional and "ship passing through jump space
could not reach stars above and below the galactic plane." why is it
that in Traveller there are several examples of cultures who travelled a
long distance at sublight speeds through normal space but still ended up
in the Imperium (such as the sublight earth ships that colonized the
islands) ?

Are they just the ones who stayed in the plane of jump space ?

Maybe there are several cultures out there descended from sublight ships
that are presumed lost by the senders but which actually arrived quite
nicely.  Maybe these cultures are jealous and angry at the people who
live in the plane of space where they _can_ use jump space.  Perhaps one
of these cultures, which happens to be matriarchal, has sent out a
message that will destroy Imperial (& Zhodani first) society as we know
it.

We don\'t have any evidence for this sort of message do we ?

<ducks rapidly>

Conspiratorial Traveller is easy isn\'t it ?

My take on this isn\'t that cultures didn\'t do this, but that the majority
of systems are in the plane (+/- a few degrees). Systems do exist
\'up\' and \'down\' there, but not too many. Targets for colonization
by Sub Light ships can be out there but with the onset of Jump,
and the fact that Jump can\'t reach them, they have become \'lost\'
to the economic viewpoint of the Imperium. Any civilization colonizing
via sub-light travel, (in the plane) IMG, has done so long before the
current Imperium
and has now absorbed the jump technology, effectively cutting themselves
off from their \'relatives\' out of the galactic plane. While I would say
that
journeys to these worlds are possible via SLT, they are few and far between
\'cos of the length of the journey and the costs. Maybe a few isolationist
cultures still do them.

I take it your references to this matriarchal society are something to do
with
this Empress Wave that people talk about. I don\'t claim to know too much
about this as it isn\'t relevant to my campaign (MT) as it stands. (I stuck

Check out the TML archives from about 12 to 18 months ago where there was a
long (and hot) thread on fighters, which suggested that the technology
proposed made them non-viable against capital ships, as they had to fly
into the definite kill zone of laser batteries. Against smaller vessels and
pirates the balance moves in the fighter\'s favour.

If you are using CSC VDS rules (ie those in Infini-V) it does make a
significant difference; the lower tech solutions are bulkier and (certainly
in the case of MHD turbines) more costly.

I discovered this when designing an APC for a planned BITS book.

Perhaps the \'fighters\' were more like the smaller riderships described by

Well that may be so, so you just arm your fighters with longer-ranged
missles (ship busters) equipped with their own ECM and such.  You\'d want
them IFF tagged as well, so your own missles don\'t come after you!

One neat idea is to image the cube in 3D(red/green) and include 3D

I like the rational behind this second argument.  

Fighters rely on speed and high maneuverability, and are consequently
lightweight and low armor units.  The comparison to WW2 is useful, but
aircraft operate in a 3rd dimension not truly accessible to ships. 

An analogy is that you are a flatlander (from the spinward marches) and
have to maneuver on your spinward marches map (2D)to avoid the 3
dimensional predator stalking you.  The predator can swoop down(from
jumpspace?) on you an move in a way you can\'t(up to J6!), giving it a
decisive advantage.

The "power" in airpower really has very little to do with a fighter\'s
maneuverabliity.  It has everything to do with taking advantage of a 3rd
dimentsion not usable by the enemy, be they sea or ground forces.

This advantage disappears in Trav.  Batteries of DE weapons/repulsors
kill fighters and neutralize missiles before they get close,and these
ships have the armor to take the punsishment should they get hit.  Ships
all operate in the same medium and dimensions.  Except some ships have
very long range weapons, tons of power and great sensors.  Others have
relatively poor sensors, a laser and a couple of missiles, and a pilot.  

I think I know which will win.

Nevertheless in massed attacks a well trained fighter formations will
act as a weapons batteries, inflicting systemic damage and possibly a
statistically lucky kill.  This alone, and the need to counter the
enemies fighters, will make fleets have substatial carrier wings.

Real world info:  as a pilot the worst thing I can think of is trying to
attack an armed warship.  It can reach out to outside my weapons range
and deliver enormous firepower onto me. One hit and I\'m dead.  
Within 15 years these ships will be mounting higher power weapons and
maybe lasers, making things tougher still.  I do not see this trend
reversing as we move into space.  The only thing a big seaship has
against it is that it is a sitting duck.  (ie 1 Exocet = The Stark)

As for the Kilrathi, it is easy to write a story.

Long range missiles with ECM are long range targets.  The only reason
sea skimming missiles get a shot against phanlanx guns today is due to
poor radar pickup at low alt.  In space this advantage will go away.  

We watch baseballs and smaller in orbit today.

My argument is that the master fire directors of warships will be more
than enough to neutralize anything but batteries of missiles. 
Statistically a single shot may occasionally work.  (Never say never.)

I suppose my assumptions are based on the speed of light arguement:with
computers operating and killing one shot targets at roughly the rate at
which they are aquired, that is going to add up to a lot of fighters and
missiles.

Another reason aircraft were the main weapons in WW2 and on was the
plane functioned as a much longer "gun" for the carrier than the
battleships main guns.  This is not as true today or in 5600.

I really feel combined forces are the way to go here: a lot of capital
ships with large fighter screens.

Hmmm.  Some very good points I cannot debate.  I had figured a mass of
fighters could launch shipkillers from out of capital weapons range, but
you\'d need thousands of fighters to guarantee a kill.  With the capital
ships weapons having all the range they need, you\'d sacrifice a lot of
fighters to get that kill.

Ok.  Scenario #2 :

Have long range capital ships bearing huge missle batteries attack
first, at long distance.  These ships b\\need not be more then mobile
starbases, heavily shielded and armored.  Then you\'d have other capital
ships for close-in fighting with carriers for support and raids.  How
does this sound?

I\'d think it would be possible to build something at a lower TL one
you know it can be done and have seen it. Like getting a TV repaired
at a small shop in India when you know that they could never build a
TV from scratch there (in the shop, not India :-).

I think technology transfer needs to be modeled some way--a JTAS
article about it would be cool. The whole TL thing is a recurrent
thread and this comes up. So maybe the typical TL A yacht requires
outsourced parts (like the PP).

Technically, though you are right, 36% of the ship for a PP might
scrag the design. Think, though, about a place at TL A with no
outside contacts. Would they have yachts at that TL anyway? Do we
have any SR-71 capable planes tied down at the local airport next to
the Cessnas? (and the SR-71 isn\'t even current tech).

My point is that the only time I bet you start seeing yachts on a
TL10 world is when there are higher TLs around anyway.

That\'s what they should be. And on purpose. A T-plate missile is
very, very dangerous. The whole idea was they they should be very
expensive--too expensive, in fact. Missiles in traveller haven\'t
been t-plates before (the Missiles Supplement from the old JTAS
doesn\'t mention them :-)

Actually, I don\'t agree. Speed (here on earth) is the reason. WW2
surface ships attack each other with guns, and aircraft as well.
Being up doesn\'t protect you from CPR guns. Speed and range are the
key. In space you get neither. (which you point out below, I\'m
talking about the wet-navy stuff :-) Lets say not totally, 3d helps
some in the ww2 setting, less and less since. As you get farther
past ww2 speed domintaes more and more as the main plius, IMO.

Yup. They key for space stuff is that fighters are not faster, they
are likely to not even accelerate as fast as a big ship. And if you
want to get nitty gritty about speed, big ships can probably go
faster relative to dust, etc. in system because they have more armor
(and there is duration at thrust, and so on).

I think so. Look at the TL15 Imperial fighters--they are 50 dtons
with a crew of 2. These can carry a bunch of missiles, and have a
laser turret. They can attack bigger ships with the missiles, and
act as an anti-missile screen as well (and away from the mother ship
to thin out the attack) with the turret.

True, and because one might work, they get used sometimes. As a
result the defenses against them get built.

And a mission kill on same can just be knocking out the
sensors--which in the case of a missile have to be pointed at the
target. This makes them pretty easy to kill. You can armor the
missile, but not the IR sensor in the nose pointed right at the PD
laser. Blind the missile and it misses.

Yeah. Screen is the key word, IMO. It allows for a pile of small
beam weapons a distance closer to the enemy for killing missiles,
etc.

Well, not to re-ignite the Japanese naval theory discussion, but they knew
damn well the value of the carriers and it was pure dumb luck on our part
and bad intel on theirs that the carriers were\'nt at Pearl when they
attacked. In fact, the carriers were one of their primary objectives.

Possible. The far off ships don\'t need the armor, etc. if they are
never meant to close with the enemy and mix it up.

You\'d have some "normal" mix of big ships. CAs with big weapons, but
less armor--best drives you can put on them. Some lower accel
(perhaps) BBs with similar weaponry, but more armor/screens/etc.

Fighters would be thrown out in between you and the main enemy
force. Their missiles might be massed against big targets, or use
them to pick off small escorts. Their beam weapons work on missiles
launched against your fleet from long range (kind of predigesting
them for your real escorts).

Battle Riders are just fighters big enough to take on capital ships,
BTW. So you have "fighters" that go from little screening guys to
small Destroyed sized ones, to CA sized ones.

 ----

Prior to the invention of jump drive, travel between the distant stars 
required epic voyages at slower-than-light speeds through normal space.
The technical challenges of such a flight are daunting, and it is not
until efficient fusion reaction drives are developed at tech-9 that the
construction of these sublight or "STL" starships becomes feasible.

Even once it becomes possible, many species don\'t have the drive, the
desire, or the patience to engage in this form of starflight.  It is
known that the Vargr, for example, were not able to mount the combined
effort required to engage in STL travel before they developed the jump
drive.  Remarkably, several human subspecies have engaged in sublight
interstellar travel, including the Vilani and Solomani; the Suerrat 
built STL starships and used them to colonize and maintain an "empire" 
of twenty-some worlds before being contacted by early Vilani explorers.

These vessels are primitive by modern standards.  An STL starship is 
nothing more than a fusion rocket, a lot of fuel, and a small payload
which is everything else (power, cargo, crew, controls, and so on). 
A typical ship operated by the Triad on the Vland-Tauri run traveled
at an average velocity of one-tenth of lightspeed (30 Mm/s), taking
over twenty years to make a crossing that today takes only one week.

For this reason, few STL starships are seen in the modern era.  Some
species, such as the Jgd-ll-Jagd of Lishun sector, suffer from extreme
forms of hyperspace sickness and are unable or unwilling to use jump
drives.  Some ships still exist that are relics of the early stages of
interstellar exploration, and are museums or static bases today.  And,
out on the fringes, in far distant backwaters, tales are told of lost
Solomani expeditions which still use these ships as the only means of
travel from star to star.

DESIGNING THE SUBLIGHT STARSHIP

In order to design a slower-than-light starship for Traveller, you\'ll
need a calculator which can find hyperbolic tangents ("tanh", or using
"hyp" and "tan" keys), natural logarithms ("ln"), and square roots.

Any Traveller design system can be used.  The only restriction is that
it must be possible to calculate the fueled mass and unfueled mass of
your starship from the design.

The key idea is to design a starship which can reach the highest speed
possible.  A sublight starship should accelerate slowly but steadily,
coast at high speed for years, and turn over to decelerate to a stop.
Carrying enough fuel tankage to reach a high speed is of much greater
importance than a high acceleration.  A one-gee drive (or less!) will
be sufficient, but the ship will probably need to be at least ninety
percent LHyd fuel by volume.

Provision should be made for the fact that passengers and crew will be
aboard for years at a time.  Ample living and recreational space must
be provided, as well as sick bays and repair shops.  Consider using a
streamlined hull if you intend to refuel and reuse the ship after it
arrives at it\'s destination.  Very fast sublight vessels may also be
streamlined to reduce the erosive effects of interstellar dust.

CALCULATION OF CRUISING SPEED

First, we need to find the "mass ratio" of the ship.  This is simply
the ship\'s fueled and loaded mass, divided by the unfueled but loaded
mass.  

  EXAMPLE.  The _Voyageur_ masses five million metric tonnes when 
  fully loaded with LHyd maneuvering fuel.  Of this, the fuel has
  a mass of three million metric tonnes; unfueled, _Voyageur_ has 
  a mass of two million metric tonnes.  Therefore, the mass ratio
  for _Voyageur_ is 5/2 or 2.5.
  
Next, we need to find the "exhaust velocity", the speed at which fuel 
leaves the drive as a fraction of lightspeed.  This is based on fuel 
efficiency of the drive technology used.  For the standard drives in 
the Traveller starship design rules, these are:

  Fusion Rocket  (TL 9):     0.3185
  Daedalus Drive (TL 9):     0.3327    
  HEPlaR         (TL 10):    0.1332
  Thrusters      (TL 11):    1.0*

  No drive may have an exhaust velocity greater than 1.0.
  * Thrusters are a special case.  See below.
  
  [NOTE.  If fusion rocket fuel consumption is changed to be ten
   times as fast as given in first edition FFS, then use 0.0336 
   instead of 0.3185.]

Given the exhaust velocity and mass ratio of the ship, we can find her 
coasting speed as a fraction of lightspeed.  If mass ratio is R and 
exhaust velocity is E, then

  coasting speed == tanh ( E * ln ( sqrt ( R ) ) )
  
  EXAMPLE.  _Voyageur_ has a mass ratio of 2.5 and uses a Fusion
  Rocket (exhaust velocity of 0.3185 lightspeed).  Therefore,
      coasting speed == tanh ( 0.3185 ln ( sqrt ( 2.5 ) ) ) 
                     == 0.146 lightspeed
                   
If the ship is not intended to slow down at the end of the trip (for
instance is a robotic probe that will fly through the system with dry
tanks at full speed, radio survey data home, and then be lost forever), 
don\'t take the square root of the mass ratio.

THRUSTERS

Thrusters are tech-11 reactionless engines that lose effectiveness at
distances greater than 1000 diameters from the largest nearby mass, and
so aren\'t suitable for deep-space operation.  In some cases, this isn\'t
an issue as the gravity wells of the stars at both ends of the trip are
large enough that the ship can reach cruising speed before it leaves the
system, and has enough room to brake at the end of the trip.  Otherwise,
thrusters are used primarily as high-efficiency boosters in-system, and
reaction engines take over in deep space.

The only species that use thrusters in sublight starship design either
cannot use jump drive for physiological or psychological reasons (as
the Jgdi) or have achieved advanced levels of technology but haven\'t
stumbled on the secret of the jump drive (perhaps the Suerrat before
contact by the Vilani).

As most sublight starships are not technologically advanced enough to
have thrusters, further discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of
this article.

RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS

"Gamma" is the factor by which time appears to be compressed for 
crew of a starship relative to the world they left.  If V is the
cruising speed of the starship as a fraction of lightspeed, then 

  gamma == 1 / sqrt ( 1 - V^2 )
                  
Divide the amount of time the trip appears to take on the world they
left by gamma to find the amount of time the trip appears to take to
the starship crew.

  EXAMPLE.  _Voyageur_ has a cruising speed of 0.146 lightspeed.
  Her gamma is (1 / sqrt ( 1 - 0.146^2 )) == 1.01.  A one hundred
  year trip on _Voyageur_ would take only 100/1.01 == 99 years 
  from the perspective of the crew.  (Incidentally, in that time
  the ship would travel 14.6 light-years, or 4.5 parsecs).
  
RECORDING THE RESULTS

When the design is completed, the cruising speed, gamma, acceleration
fully fueled and acceleration unfueled should be recorded on the data
sheet for the ship for later reference.

   Yamato knew better.  He hoped that he could force the American
carriers into a decisive fight later on, but sooner rather than later,
because if he didn\'t the Americans would use their superior numbers and
manufacturing capabilities to wear Japan down to dust.

   That paradigm-shift was well under way in 1941, Pearl Harbor merely
accelerated the process.  

   There are those "historians" (and I use the term loosely since most
of them are fiction writers with PhDs), who claim that the Americans had
already concluded that battleships were obsolete and thus left theirs
like sitting ducks at Pearl knowing that the Japanese were on their way
to attack.  The theory (ficition) goes that Roosevelt wanted the
Japanese raid to be a spectacular success (lot of large obsolete ships
getting blown up and lots of obsolete fighters destroyed on the ground)
so that there wouldn\'t be any question about him being able to declare
war on all the Axis powers (turns out Hitler declared war on the US
anyway) and that the American people, because of the "disaster at Pearl
Harbor" would be behind whatever decisions he made regarding the
prosecution of the war.

   It\'s a wonderful conspiracy theory, too bad the facts say
otherwise...

   If fighters can be built in sufficent quantity and they can deliver a
*killing* blow to a capital vessel, then they are feisable as weapons
for a fleet, thus so are carriers.  Economic practicality is of course
another matter and would require further analysis.  Fighters are always
practical and economical as scouts, thus they will always exist in some
form.

Absolutely. Fighters are invaluable but I do think they will be less and
less so in line combat if armor and directed weapons range again become
important.

	Your plasma gun is several orders of magnitude less powerful

	The hull grid is spread out over the surface of the entire ship,
and the actual volume of the *grid* (not the rest of the drive)
can be assumed negligible and included within the hull itself. It
just occupies surface area.

Sounds like an asteroid monitor to me.  Nothing like sending your
battleships in and getting unloaded on by 10,000 Factor A nuclear
missile batteries.

It isn\'t fun being a manned missile pilot in the Imperium.  Sure they
get all the Vid coverage and the movies all depict them as the ultimate
hero, but they die fast.  BTW, So does everyone else in fleet
engagements.

I think what you are saying is the long range to deliver ordnance is
what is important, functioning as longer range artillery.  

What I mean by 3D envelopment is the maneuverablity and speed to react 
against an enemy in an axis he can\'t work in.  Note that missiles change
this arrangement and are much feared by any trained aviator.  Especially
Russian missiles and the new AMRAAM.

BTW, Remember those nice pictures of the Kamikaze in the Leyte Gulf? 
How fun do you think it is to fly into a porcupine to deliver your
ordnance? That is Trav space combat for a fighter, except the defenses
are lasers, repulsors, sand and missiles.  Not fun.

Thanks for responding.

Actually, the "new wave" of carrier warfare is over.  The new wave is
actually the submarine.  Carriers still exist today because of their 
capability to project power, primarily ashore.  nevertheless the carrier
is a considerable package if unopposed.  Also, it was not the carrier
that brought Japan\'s war effort to its knees, it was the combination of
unrestricted US submarine warfare against their shipping and the bombing
campaign.

My point within the context of the game is that at higher TL\'s when
Capital
ship size becomes very large, fighters lack the ability to impact
capital
ship operations and are therefore insignificant.  Ony when a fighter can 
carry a weapon which can significantly harm a large ship does it become
a significant player in the battle.  That is the case today (TL7-8) but
not
at TL 15, possibly not at TL12 either.  It depends on ship size.

Hi Richard,

Sorry to say that I disagree, simply because many of us (like my brother
and I) 
wish for Trav to continue on as the preeminent game of science fiction, 
not science fantasy.  The science is important to me, and if we are
willing
to expend tremendous effort to decide why jump drives use so much
hydrogen,
(a question which can only result in speculation at best, although
interesting speculation) and we publish books about how to accurately
and
realistically design future hardware, then we should at least accurately
depict the local region of the galaxy.  We can...We should.

All of Trav\'s basic sociology and astropolitics are based on a hill of
sand if we don\'t get this right.  It matters.

The missiles still would lack the power to inflict significant damage
unless used in large numbers (1000\'s? 100\'s?).  The reason the IJN
was able to make the Pearl Harbor attack was due to their development
of the "Long Lance" oxygen torpedo, the preeminent weapon of its type
and time, specifically designed to destroy capital ships sitting at
rest in Pearl. ISYN.

Concur!  This is the doctrine that my brother and I have basically
arrived
at.  Use the small ubiquitous fighters for clean up after
the dreadnoughts have smashed each other.  Fihters have their place
but remeber this for C-ships (capital ships), their striking power
at acquisition is determined by their spinal mount range.  In Trav
given that ships have roughly equivalent power, range and accuracy win
the 
battle.  The ships that strike first strike last, and the spinal mount 
with its speed-of-light delivery will strike beforre the missiles can 
acquire.  Nevertheless, hadronic (nuclear) missiles used en masse are 
devastating against ANY target.  

You should see the ship we are talking about!

"Identify, Friend or Foe"....A system by which radar operators know
the ID of a contact, whether firndly or hostile.  It requires
cooperation
on the party of the "interrogated" party, who must tell you (using coded
ciphers) if he is someone you don\'t want to shoot at.  Civilian
airliners
and the like have characteristic IFF "squawks" which let you know who
they are.

Well seeing JTAS isn\'t canon that doesn\'t really matter. : )   I support that
Heplar and Tplate missles aren\'t wanted but i think making fusion plants so
big is pretty dumb.  seems to me cost alone would be prohibitive for heplar
missles.  Especially if the Imperiums military equipment is anything like the
the US military equpiment... built by the lowest bidder.   There might be
Heplar missles for special projects but not in large #s in fleet engagements.

	Yep. If you actually use PGP, you\'ll quickly discover that
copying a signature and pasting it on the end of a changed
message is completely worthless. The signature doesn\'t match the
text of the message, and your astrogation program quickly rejects
the bad data as just that--bad. So you *can* be sure that the
original message WAS from me, and the second one, with the
signature pasted on, is a poor forgery. Merely "duplicating" a
signature is doomed to fail.

First, this supposes a single common language from which all others are
derived, i.e., at one time, the people who became Inuit once spoke the same
language as the people who became Europeans.  How can they diverge, if they
were never connected.  While that may be jake for Traveller, it ain\'t for
this little clod of sod we all call home.

Second, this example of Italy and Portugal does have a common ancestral root
relatively close in time!  They are both developed from the Aryan / Indo-
European language group.  Whereas, neither of them have a demonstrable link
to Inuit, at least to my meager knowledge.

Heres some examples to think on:
English: Father, Mother
German: Vater, Mutter
Latin: Pater, Mater
Greek: Pater, Meter
French: Pere, Mere
Armenian: Hair (consider the German Herr for Sir), Mair
Sanskrit: Pitar, Matar
Russian: Otyetz, Matz
Japanese: Chichi, Haha (not really all that far from "Mama")

These languages mostly, but certainly not all, share a common source, but I
think the time of divergence calculation by cognate percentage won\'t help
you.  Of course, thats true for any isolated example, but look at the strong
phonetic similarity of words for mother in these languages.  They certainly
didn\'t diverge at the same time. (Which is a whole \'nuther issue about when a
language diverges.  How \'bout on Tuesday we start speaking Travellerese?  ;-)

No offense to the point you are trying to make, but this is a very bad
example.  How is "padre" and "pai" a shared word?  Sure they have
similarities in the first syllable, but that doesn\'t mean anything.  You can
find much closer parallels between Irish Gaelic and Russian, yet not only are
they much further apart geographically (although there is evidence of some
contact via Viking Sailors - if I knew more about those languages, I\'d bet on
some more parallels).

Besides the fact that Italy and Portugal are very close, whereas
Alaska/Western Canada is not, we know that these languages are not even
within shouting distance.  Languages grow independently in different areas at
different rates based on whatever circumstances they face.

One thing this theory as described doesn\'t seem to contemplate is a shared
written form of communication.  Italian and Portugese use the Roman
Alphabet.  Inuit never did.  Until relatively recently, it wasn\'t written at
all.  This congate divergence theory might be more accurate when based on
divergence of two languages that share the same written phonetic alphabet.
In this area, its interesting to think about Chinese and other Pictogram,
i.e., non-phonetic languages.  China has one written language, but since its
is pictograms and not phonetics, its pronounced in radically different ways.
An old example from school:  there is a pictogram in Chinese that means
"Bathroom" (Water Closet for you non-gringos).  A native of Hong Kong and a
native of Szechuan will both know what it means if they read, but probably
won\'t be able to understand if the other says it.  (One reason I find
Japanese so interesting is its unique use of its own phonetic alphabets, one
for native words, one for foreign words, with the Chinese pictograms).

So, for Traveller, because there is a shared alphabet by and large, I think
the rate of divergence will be slowed greatly, at least by those who preserve
it.  Remember that there wasn\'t much written communication among the masses
at whatever time Portugese and Italian diverged (hate that term by the way)
from Latin.

Also, languages diverge, but they also converge.  They converge especially
when communication / travel across cultures is feasiable.  This happens a
great deal when (1) trade flourishes and disposable income goes up; (2) a
language gets codified, i.e., a dictionary is made.  Look at English.  Formed
from Norman, Saxon, German, and a whole bunch of things.  Its grows and
grows.  Absorbing whatever works.  One of the things that slowed the dynamic
nature of English was the dictionary of Samuel Johnson.  All of a sudden
there was a preferred / proper / right way to say / pronounce and to write
words.  While personally, for spoken language, I hate this, especially when
someone \'corrects\' my red-necked pronunciation of some word (I am forced to
remind them that dictionaries are \'descriptive,\' not \'proscriptive.\'), it
does have the amazing effect of putting everyone on the same page.

For traveller, language standardization becomes a tool that assists in
maintaining the stability of an Empire.  Ever heard of "the Queen\'s
English"?  Ever wonder why?  :-)

Here\'s what I do like about your comment though:  For traveller especially.
For worlds formerly in the Solomani Empire, or this Empire, or that one, a
table
giving a basic percentage of language divergence based on the time spent in
isolation, the long night, whatever, would be very helpful for dealing with
recontact situations.  This could then give a modifier to all skill tasks
involving communication.  For example, Man from Empire attempts to use his
Liason-3 skill on a planet with a 20% divergence from Imperial standard
language.  Make that a DM to the roll of -1.  The exact percentages would be
whatever was effective.  Of course, I\'d only want such a table for the base
reate of divergence.  Because language is dynamic, I\'d want a roll with a
list of modifiers to allow for possibilities like a world that, based on
time, would only have a 10% language divergence, because of a catastrophe
that decimated the population and/or the infrastructure, actually had a
divergence of 30%.

While the chart you provide is a good starting point, because I have some
questions about the accuracy of this cognate comparison, since I think the
determination of what is a shared word and what isn\'t is informed by a lot of
other factors than the word itself, I cannot imagin how this table would not
vary by the primary base language.  Sure, I might have great difficulty
speaking to another \'english\' speaker 700 years ago.  But I\'m not so sure
that the same is true of a person in China.  While certainly in recent times,
a similar rate of divergence might be seen, it begs the question, which 700
years are you going to look at?  2000-1300?  1900-1200?  1000-300?  I contend
that you\'ll get drastically different divergence in those different periods.
(which for traveller, means to me that Tech Level / Communication speed-range
will play a huge roll in any such calculation - look at the rate of language
divergence/convergence before and after the Industrial Revolution in Western
Europe).  Heck, English wasn\'t even really a distinct language a thousand
years ago.

[snip]Why would those two have any cognates at all?  Where humans speaking
the same language before there were seeded around the rest of the galaxy?  I
don\'t know Traveller history as well as many on this list, but I don\'t think
so.  No common base language, no cognates, no divergence, since they were
never together in the first place.

At any rate, for traveller, any such chart is going to have to be arbitrary
in some fashion.

Before I forget, another TL will play a huge roll is the ability to preserve
recorded commnication / information and access it.  Sure, a world might lose
Jump ability, but if they maintain their ability to play recordings, and are
able to recieve the vast amounts of insteller communciation blanketing this
whole area of the galaxy at the speed of light, there me be an extremely
small divergence, regardless of the passage over time.

So for me, the tale is in the modifiers not the base table.  This is an
interesting starting point though.  Thanks.

Bloo

P.S.  This as well as several other threads on TML have led me to the
conclusion that what we all really, really want to have/write/use/etc. is a
comprehensive book about running instellar campaigns against a very large
backdrop of both time and space.  A Campaign Builders Handbook if you will.
Or perhaps Universe Engineer\'s Manual.
Some topics: language divergence over time and in response to events, the ebb
and flow of tech levels, the size and duration of various empires throughout
known time/space (in snazzy-color-coded graphics :-), how to quickly react to
a century long / millemium long nap in the cold coffin for your PCs without
rewriting the whole universe (and if they\'re revived in a lower TL
environment, how fast can they jumpstart the TL they find themselves in,
e.g., imagine the impact of a TL17 Genius Physicist awoken from emergency low
birth by Cleon I at the birth of his Imperium - oh wait a sec, that\'s how he
got Fusion Plus :-), etc., etc.  Something to think about.

	The encryption isn\'t something you can analyze and simply
repeat. Just like cutting and pasting a PGP signature from one
message to another won\'t work, you can\'t just record someone\'s
IFF transmission and resend it. Now, if you can quickly crack
military grade cipher systems, you can inpersonate a friend. But
if they were that easy to crack, nobody would rely on IFF.

	Here\'s a simple example using PGP. I\'ll use my PGP key as if I
were the Imperial Navy\'s cryptographic authority. Valid
identifications will be signed using my private key, so anybody
can verify them using my public key.

	Let\'s say you send out a sensor signal that activates Joe\'s
transponder. Joe\'s transponder squirts out the following message:

- ----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----

This is Joe--I\'m a Friend.
- ----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----

	Your system receives this message, and verifies the signature by
checking it against my public key. The answer you get is:

Good signature from user "David J. Golden <goldendj@pcisys.net>".
Signature made 1998/02/07 19:32 GMT

	So you know that Joe is a friend. Now Mike records the same
transmission,  and tries to forge an IFF identification for
himself by copying the signature. When you ping Mike, he sends

	Note that knowing my public key does nobody any good in forging
my signature. The only way of forging it is to know my private
key. That\'s the beauty of public-key cryptography.

When Yamamoto was informed that no carriers were destroyed at Pearl, he

    'body' => 'Bits has published a new Traveller supplement, 101 Lifeforms.  I
received a copy from Andy Lily last month.  I was avoiding commenting on
it because I had wrote a (_very_ small) part of it.  However no one
seems to discussed it much on the list & I wanted to let you all know
that it is out & is quite good.

101 Lifeforms is a digest sized 44 page book.  It has 6 pages of
copyright, table of contents, and introductory material (including
skills for animals) at the beginning.  It has 5 pages of Index and
Glossary at the end, including two complete indexes one alpha by animal
name and one sorted by habitat type.  The remaining 32 pages are filled
with the description of the 101  Lifeforms (mostly animals w/ some
plants & exotics).  Each page of the book has about 3 animals on it. 
About 20 of these animals are illustrated in small black & white line
drawings within or color illustrations on the cover.

A sample animal is as follows

48.  Dragoon
Beach, marsh, swamp (rare 2d) [native terrains & frequency]
Amphibian Pouncer 200kg A9 F6 [type, size & behavior]
S 0.5 [land] / 3S [water] 0/1 [armor value] 20/11 [hits] Bite2d, Butt
1d.  [This block also has usefull icons fof armor (a shell), hits (a
heart) and dammage (a crocadile about to bite).]

Description: This 3m long swimmer has rough skin, lines of tiny spurs
down each side and four stumpy flippers.  Its underside is flattened and
covered with suckers.  The top of the head is protected by a plate of
thick skin.  It has a pair of large eyes and a beak.
Referees Notes: [about 175 words snipped, some animals have ref notes of
only about 50 words or so - this is actually one of the more interesting
parts of the animal description]
Habitat:  Dragoons can spend longperiods floating totally motionless in
the water waiting for large prey to pass nearby.  Their body is 
remarkably flexible, allowing them to move easily through root filled
swamp water. 

This is a usefull book.  It includes notes on the lifeforms habitat,
range, domestification if applicable, etc.  Recommended.

Or as the Darmine would explain:

101 Lifeforms [base 10] 101

	1 + 0 + 1 = 2
	2^2 =4

We than crosscheck this in base 16 for confirmation:

	101 [base 16] = 65
	6 + 5 = 11
	1 + 1 = 2
	2^2 = 4

This book is significant :)

Your own side would pick up on the code and shoot you down.  also, under
the Laws of Land Warfare, duplicating IFF codes is considered the same as
wearing an enemy uniform to decieve him.. grounds for execution if captured.

Look at it this way.. you\'re flying your fighter, at least 2-300 km from
your wingman.  Definitely out of visual range.  The only methods for
identifying who is who is by the sensor returns (size, performance,
activities) and by transponders.  You, being a sneaky devil, dial your IFF
box to the other side\'s code.  Meanwhile, your wingman picks you up,
interrogates the bogey, and doesn\'t get a return.  He launches an anti-ship
missile and brags about bagging the retreating enemy, and everybody wonders
whatever happened to you...

Not really.  I just say that it\'s a representational map of Jump Space

Space, and this is why navigators drink a lot.

Never, ever, say the word "leg" around paratroopers who are about to jump.

My own personal superstition.  If I bring a really good book to work, to
read in our holding lot, I will not get a break all day.  sounds silly, but
it works for me.

Gotta agree 100% here.  In fact, the most generous estimates of when full
modern language capacity developed in Homo sapiens is about 200 kya -- as
an extreme outlying date.  More conservative and probable estimates are
about 100 or 50 kya, or even less.  At the point of abduction, there wasn\'t
any language to diverge.  Probably not much in the way of shared
predisposition, even, at that point.

Somehow, magically, the transplanted Vilani (and Zhodani et al.) taken off
Earth around -300 kya just HAPPENED to develop cognitive and anatomical
speech capacities matching those of Terran Homo sapiens sapiens.  Of
course!  It must have been Gramps again.  He must\'ve snuck out of his
pocket universe and tweaked all the little proto-jabbering primates a
couple times more to get it to work out right.

And WHY??? Eh?  What\'s his vested interest in having all these human
subspecies sharing the same language capabilities?  Like, think about it!

Did he plan ahead a hundred thousand years or so so that the
Zhodani-Vilani-Solomani axis would be able to try to sweet-talk the Empress
into bed^H^H^H going away and leaving old Grampy alone?

This is a great genre question!  I don\'t know.  I\'m sure there are some
Shadowrun, Rifts, et al type sources that have a take on this...  Even
Activision/Auran\'s "Dark Reign" have a similar theme, at least about water.

This would probably remove all significant action from the realm of the
individual and into the realm of the megacorp, though.  I think that
Traveller in general has circumvented development to this level of
technology in most cases by recurring "long nights."  Some folks have
pointed out that it\'s roughly 4k years to M:0, and for linguistic purposes
it\'s one-way linear, however, for technology we moved forward a thousand or
so, fell back for a thousand or so, and then had to re-learn a lot of it
along the way to where we are now...  Most of the worlds, at least in my
Imperium, that the players visit are more reminiscent of very active 2nd and
3rd world ports on Terra in the 21st relative to life "in the big city USA."
There are instances of high technology: ships, loaders, robots, grav
vehicles, but technology is not the overwhelming factor in everyday life...

Perhaps on Sylea or Terra such a Paranoia-like supertechnological
environment might exist, but I would find it too much of a headache to run
or describe or keep consistent.  Inconsistency is easier to mask in the
frontier...  Heh.

I would like to read your take on it, though.

Societies based on such nonsensical hatred are great for space opera, but in
"reality" (heh!) very seldom survive very long in that form... they tend to
fragment or transform into more stable, tolerant, capitalistic societies --
people really just want to get by for the most part, and it takes quite a
charismatic leader to talk them into warlike, lemming behavior (especially
on the order of mounting a massive, sublight assault as the one you
intimated).  An outlier in this respect (and many others) was Nazi Germany
- -- the charisma required to maintain, unwavering, the malice and motivation
required to carry out such a pogrom for the length of time that it was
maitained is enormous!  In the end, I think, it would have collapsed of its
own weight -- just a Saddam\'s regime would, if the U.S. would give it the
chance, by lifting the embargo: we only strengthen and deepen the support by
attacking the nation, rather than distinguishing the individual (as George
Bush did so eloquently).  His support would more likely slip and more
moderate and peaceful internal forces could replace the current power
structure more easily if they were not daily threatened with war.  Allah
help us if we do eliminate the power structure that exists now without
something to replace it immediately and produce the kind of vacuum that Iran
could instantly fill, and grow from the unclaimed resources.  If you think
Saddam\'s bad, wait \'till you get a load of Shiite ayatollahs on oil-based
economic steroids.  [Oops.  The author has wandered too far afield and will
now be redirected.  -ed.]

Very few institutions maintain such a long-term focus or goal... and those
that do tend to be religious in nature.  That is why, to me, Herbert\'s
Fremen were so "alien" (from the Western world) and moving: they were
willing to work toward a goal that was so much larger than each of them
individually as to be unfathomable except in the abstract.  "My childrens\'
childrens\' grandchildren will see this thing come to pass, and for this I
will give my life, my wealth, and my soul..."  Such extraordinary actions
are seldom those made by selfishness, hatred, or revenge -- in any culture
- -- such *evil* motivations generally demand personal involvement in the end
result.  Perhaps, at heart, I am an optimist, though.

Would make for a great plot, though, wouldn\'t it?  I think too often in our
Darwinian evaluations of people, plots, and motives, the vision of the other
great "survival instinct," that of species-survival, is lost... but such has
our modern, urban, individuall-isolated, global culture taught us to spurn
self-sacrifice in the name of profit motive and individual survival.

This is certainly true in most traveller combat systems. I\'ve been
leaning towards a slightly less deadly system where capital ships
can at least take a few spinal hits (not always, of course). The
reason (as I posted a few days ago) is that if one shot is a kill,
then I\'m not sure big ships would ever get built, and we know that
they do in the official history.

That said, I agree. Even in HG fighters and smaller, missile armed
ships were used to predigest targets--that or finish others off.

Ok, I didn\'t do any analysis of the signature.  I just cut and pasted.  But
the analysis could be done and a signature could be attached that would fool
the PGP.  I don\'t care enough to do the analysis and would have no use for
the results.  I like staying on the legal side of things these days.

But if I did feel the need and had a use for it, I feel sure that I could.
Once a program was written to do the analysis and do a better job of
forging, I guess the originator would have to come up with a new system.
So, I guess like locks, these things are only designed to keep the honest,
honest.

	Theoretically, yes, the analysis can be done. The usual quotes
thrown around by those semi in the know start with a timeframe
greater than the age of the universe and go up from there,
though. It ain\'t nearly as easy as you seem to think it is.
>But if I did feel the need and had a use for it, I feel sure

	I will bet you every single last cent I own that you cannot do
it. I\'d suggest actually looking into cryptography before making
such blanket statements. And if you CAN do it, you\'d better watch
out for the NSA--they\'d be very interested.

 Where does it specifically state (in canon) that there is an energy 
signature, and how specific does canon get in describing what form the 
signature takes? Why *wouldn\'t* a cloud of hydrogen materializing in 
normal space, being bombarded by the solar wind, produce an energy 
signature?

It does follow intuitively. I\'ve discussed why the need that the ballast 
be hydrogen before follows intuitively *for me* (and others), so I won\'t 
rehash it.

Maybe I should turn the arguement around. *IF* you agreed that a 
"ballast" or "atmosphere" were necessary in jumpspace, what material 
would make the most sense to you?

Well, I guess the point that members of this side of the debate are 
trying to make, is that the hydrogen bubble fits the background *better* 
(more consistantly) then most other theories.

No matter that it seems to you to be more complicated, and seems to 
rationalize to much for your taste; it does explain basic statements 
previously made about how jump drive works.

ie. massive amounts of H2 as jump "fuel", drop tanks, keeps power 
generation ability and need down, etc etc.

To us, on this side of the debate, you have to "patch and fill" in order 
to explain away how the jump drive can consume so much fuel and create so 
much power; and yet this technology is not useful in *any other* 
application.

We are both equally entrenched. Your concerns are as equally valid as 
mine. IMHO both theories are equally sound and equally flawed. I choose 
the H2 solution, because I have a more difficult time swallowing the 
flaws of *massive* energy creation and fuel consumption.

May I respectfully submit, when you get to 50+ dt you are moving into the
realm of the "boat"..as in missle or torpedo boat.  Ok, maybe it\'s just a
difference in terminology, but I see screens of, slightly larger, MTB\'s
serviced by Ship Tenders covering the movement of large capital ships, not
tiny fighters buzzing around.

I think, the MTB\'s would slide up to 70+ tons with some transitioning from
boat to ship and being jump capable.  They would carry crews of 3 to 6,
mount substantial anti-ship missile resources capable of hurting capital
ships (if they can get a hit on them) and anti-civilian ship lasers.  

These larger MTB\'s would be able to fill a number of roles.  They would be
large and powerful enough to operate independently for several days at a
time in an anti-pirate/raider role.  They could serve as picket and patrol
ships ranging around a fleet providing intelligence and early warning.  In
squadron or flotilla groups they could provide screens and flank protection
for capital ships.  

Frankly, I think, squadron or flotilla sized "charges" against capital
warships would be acts of desperation, perhaps to divert attention while
other units withdrew, but *could* prove effective with *massive* missile
barrages in doing surface damage to even large ships.  Now, I don\'t like
ablative armor, so it\'s unlikely these sort of attacks will destroy large
warships, but surface damage could still "slow them down."  

If we just assume ship\'s will have radiators and sensors exposed on the
surface then "hull scraping" attacks *do* become effective.  Damage a
ship\'s sensors and its ability to hit multiple targets and targets at long
range is decreased.  Damage the ship\'s radiators and it has to reduce power
consumption, which *could* mean lower accelerations and less frequent (or
shorter ranged) spinal firings. 

Personally, I think battles will tend to be won by the side with the most
accurate, longest ranged energy weapons.  (and TL ought to play a big role
in that, but that\'s a different discussion ;-) It *might* be that Fusion+
didn\'t make MTB\'s possible, but *did* make them enough faster, able to
carry enough more armor, and able to carry enough more *larger* missiles to
make these "hull scraping" attacks against opposing fleet\'s capital ships
really effective...for a while...giving the IN\'s capital ships a decisive
velocity and range advantage.

I don\'t know what is supposed to be there, but what I see is a
superscripted 2 enclosed in quotes and a blank character enclosed in
quotes.

A number of posters\' messages turn up here with strange characters
scattered throughout them, Marc\'s T4.1 posts come quickly to mind, but all
are more or less readable.  The ones that are in html, otoh, require me to
run them through a browser and that isn\'t automatic with my email
client...those I grumble about.  ;-> It would be nice if everyone\'s message
reader could read the output of everyone\'s message editor, but that\'s just
not the case.  Because of that we should strive to make our posts as
generic as possible, at least, that\'s my thinking.

As for winmail.dat, it does seem to cause problems in the digests, and is
wasted bandwidth (and storage space) for a lot of us.  The polite thing to
do would be to turn it off for posts to the list, and if it causes as much
trouble in the digests as I *think* it does we are probably past simply
being polite.

Now, I enjoy a good argument as much as the next guy, but let\'s all
remember we are here to have *fun* arguing (Ok, discussing ;-) "things
Traveller."  So, let\'s help each other enjoy the list by arguing about
Virus, .1c Asteroids, Jump Drives or even the dreaded Task System, *not*
haranguing each other about our choices of computer systems, software or
architecture.  There are plenty of other places we can do that, right?

Because the encryption key doesn\'t last long enough to do that.

Much simpler to just shoot everything that moves ;-)

Current levels of encryption technology are such that it\'s impossible to
break these schemes in the real time it takes to respond. remember that
missile querying your IFF system is coming at you _fast_! I have no doubt
that 3I level systems will be much harder to crack.

Meanwhile they\'re changing frequencies at several hundred times per second
too.

I\'m mearly talking about the official traveller universe, YMMV :-)

The Heavy Fighter used in every ship in Sup.9 is 50 tons, they even
have launch tubes for them. Actually the text even states that most
ships have facilities to deal with these small craft!

And a single Tigress carries *300* of these 50 ton monsters.

There are two different kinds of boats, really (military): SDBs, and
fighters. The latter includes 50,000 Battleriders. It is kind of
grey where the transition from fighter to battlerider is. Crew level
might be a good starting point. Get the crew up above what we see in
aircraft, and it starts looking like a BR I guess.

Interestingly, this is how the  Heavy Fighter is described in Sup.9.

Small fighters somehow turning the tide (grossly, as suggested by
T4) is rather goofy, IMO.

have to say that in the wake of the sad news regarding the T4.1 hardback

good sign for the future of Traveller -- regardless of what basic rules

Yes it could, which is why you also make the message time-dependent. You
can break PGP and other public key crypto systems, but the best we have
today is brute force, and unless you have a basement full of Crays you\'re
not going to break it in a reasonable amount of time.

Actually, all you need to do is up the ante by increasing your key size a
few bits...

There have been contests recently to break current available DES encrypted
messages. The system uses space cycles on thousands and thousands of
computer systems around the world, trying keys at thousands per second.

I seem to recall it took something like 30 days to break the single
message.

Like I said, a basement full of crays...

Public key cryptography is an amazing thing. Check out PGP sometime.

But it was just getting good. :-)  Ok, now I understand, it\'s not just a
matter of encryption, it also involves a number of variables that I as your
foe might not even think of.  Like the location bearing off a marker or in
an environment the altitude, or even the temperature.  The date and time
could be part of the signature and I suppose that if all friendlies were
coordinated before the assault, then even the variables could change.  It
was time and date Greenwich (sp.), but now it\'s time and date IS.  Etc.
Each change makes a new authenticator code and a new encryption scheme.

Maybe they got so many threats of legal action they were *forced* to return
money/cheques?

As for their policies improving, well, there is the alternative explanation --
this is a way of saying "Don\'t hold your breath, this is unlikely to ever
appear" for (pick one) --

1) Inadequate financing from Sweatpea
2) Incompetent business practices by IG
3) Lack of Cash Flow (because of 2, probably)
3) We\'re soon to be out of business

Have they finally pissed off so many committed customers, so many distributors,
and shops, with inferior, bug and typo ridden products that they simply cannot
proceed?

We can only *hope* (if anyone still cares about IG) that this is the case
(personally, like I\'ve said since its announcement, it seems to me that
Traveller\'s real hope for the future is GURPSTrav).

Or you don\'t see the allied identification markings on a British APC in
the heat of combat, and bag it as an "enemy."  
Good IFF among allies would/should have prevented that.

But the Imperium was mapped over corresponding space.  TAke three points
anywhere and they form a plane.  The 3I map is 2D no matter how you look
at it, jspace or not.

But it is a useful handwave.  My only problem is if you use this answer
it doesn\'t tell you where a damn thing really is, and that is what I
want to know so I can map the local regions of our galaxy into Trav.

Sounds very easy but is not.  You need to have a copy of the emanating
system for this to work, because IFF "interrogates."

Freindly interrogations sent...respose of proper code=friendly
				no response = bogey/bandit

There are 4 types of IFF that can be interrogated in NATO, which I will
not go into.  
As my Army buddies say, missing one of those codes is an 80% we will
fire on you.  Missing 2 of them is 90%  More than that and some Patriot
gunners have their way with you.

The Long Lance torpedo was a surface launched weapon, 24" in diamter.
The Japanese air-dropped torpedo was a standard 21" weapon. The
difference was they were fitted with wooden fins that allowed them to
run in the shallow waters of Pearl Harbor, otherwise they would have
buried in the bottom mud.

Their success was the training of the pilots, the lack of preparedness
by the American ship crews, and the innovation involved in getting the
torpedoes to run correctly.

Quite possibly, the reason is much less important than the act itself.

Phillip, you really do have it in for IG don\'t you :*> We all know that
Marc *IS* still working on T4.1, and from what has been seen of it so far
(which is quite a lot) it is going to be good. I for one like T4, it has
seen some of the best material for Traveller yet (and some of the worse).
The system is simple and elegant.

Is IG going under? don\'t know, really don\'t. If it does it will happen
fast and without warning, we\'ll wake up to a message on the TML saying
IG has closed their doors. However I\'ve said it before and I\'ll say it
again: if IG goes under and GURPS is producing Traveller worldbooks, it
will be the end of Traveller as an independent game and I for one will
morn its passing.

This is why ships  carry not only spinal mounts, but armor.  These
developments are quite reminiscent of the Battleship building race
earlier this century.

Cships CAN survive single hits, maybe even multiple hits.  A MT
Type-T spinal mount packs the explosive power of several hundred
tonnes of TNT in a single shot.

	300,000 MW x 60 sec = 1.8 x 10^13 MJoule

	1KT TNT = 4.14 x 10^12 MJ

	efficiency = 20%

	=> single shot yield = 0.870 KT i.e. 870 tons of TNT !

	This assumes that Meson Gun efficiency DOES NOT rise with
	TL, a flawed assumption (in my opinion) common to all
	varriants of FF&S.

Well, you can\'t just "analyze" it.  It\'s crypto, theoretically
unbreakable.
Retransmitting the basic interrogation response might work unless keying 
from the original interrogation sequence were encoded in the response. 
In 
that case the system would recognize the difference between a valid
response 
and a simple duplication of a now invalid signal.

I distinctly remember reading that the LL was developed around a long
standing plan to defeat the US PacFleet at Pearl.  A one battle war.
I don\'t doubt that what you say is correct, but I cannot recall the
reference I am drawing my memories from.  It distinctly detailed the
japanese startegy and I remember my surprise at learning how that one 
weapon had been so crucial to the strike.

Yamamoto knew from the outset that "winning the war" was a matter
of defeating the American\'s will to fight.  A victory at Pearl would
have bought Japan 3 or 4 years to consolidate the WestPac holdings
and gain control of the shipping lanes out to the second island chain.

The failure to destroy the Carriers was a significant setback indeed.

Excellent work, Steven!

Two little additions.  

Magnetic Sail Technology - Although, magnetic sails won\'t be able to give
you enough acceleration to really matter they will be able to effectively
brake the ship at the end of its journey with *much* lower mass required. 
Additionally, the magnetic sail could be used to perform the slight course
corrections that might be needed after the ship exhausts its fuel.  This
will allow you to effectively double the ship\'s maximum velocity to 20%,
30%, 40% plus c, because you can use virtually all the fuel accelerating.

Low Berth Technology - Effective cryogenic, or whatever, techniques might
allow you to carry a much larger effective payload.  A few crewpersons
could rotate through "sleep"/work cycles surviving an entire (or even
several trips) and delivering a large number of frozen colonists to the
Outworlds.  Personally, I\'ve got my doubts about "sleeper" tech, but it is
an SF staple, so you should build it in.

How the hull grid is applied to the hull is an interesting point that
hasn\'t been addressed.  The grid could be located outside surface the hull,
inside the hull material, or on the inside surface of the hull. Where you
decide to place it will effect whether surface damage can prevent a ship
from jumping, and how much it will cost to add, repair, or replace the
grid.  Placing it on the outside surface would make it easiest to add or
repair, but would leave it most vulnerible to surface damage (either from
interaction with the system medium or combat. Placing it on the inside
surface would probably cost more to add or repair (unless you normally use
double hulls), but would protect it from surface damage.  Placed inside the
hull material would make it almost impossible to add after the fact, would
be quite difficult to repair, but would protect it from surface damage.

If the hull grid projects a field around the ship (for whatever reason
you\'ve decided given your theory of how jump works) it is going to have to
project far enough out to cover any exterior features and externally
mounted vehicles.

Just some thoughts,

I\'ve seen a 3-d *model* of the nearest 20 or 30 stars. If you pick the

to *build* models of a 3-d sub-sector. Then you can just *look* at it.

	Doesn\'t even have to get that complicated, and in fact the more
complicated it gets, the more possibility of problems. The
encryption alone covers most of it. Breaking a full-strength
public/private keypair, a 20th century technology, is an
incredible feat at the same level of technology. If you\'re
actually trying to do it brute force--the easiest way is *brute*
force (i.e. beat the key out of its owner). It would be a fair
assumption that cryptosecurity and cryptoexploitation would both
advance about the same as always--security will usually be ahead,
but occasionally, the very cutting edge exploitation side may
pull even.

	Since you asked: Dave\'s brief primer on public key crypto, no
math needed (delete if not interested):

"Normal" or symmetric cryptography: you have a given algorithm or
process, and a secret key. Use the process to apply the key to
original message or plaintext, and you get the encrypted message,
also called cryptotext. Apply the  *same* key to the cryptotext,
and you recover the plaintext.

The main problem with this, assuming a sound algorithm, is key
exchange. If you wanted to send me something secure, you\'d have
to find some secure way of getting the key to me so I can read
it. If you\'ve already got a secure link with me, why not send the
message that way? And what if you want to send secure stuff to
Alice, too? If you use the same key you gave me, then I can
intercept and read that. So you\'ve got to provide a different key
for Alice ... and of course Alice needs a separate key for me ...
and they\'ve all got to be securely distributed.

Public key cryptography uses different mathematical principles to
come up with a key pair. Take the plaintext, apply one key, and
it CANNOT be decrypted with the same key! Only the other key will
decrypt it. Likewise, anything encrypted with the second key can
ONLY be decrypted with the first key.

This provides some very useful properties. I call one of the pair
my private key, and the other one my public key. Now, instead of
trying to find a secure way to get a key to you, I do the
opposite. I send it via email, I put it on public servers people
can read, I plaster it all over billboards, and shout it from the
rooftops. EVERYBODY has my public key. Anybody wants to send me
something secret, they use my public key to encrypt it--NOBODY
else can decrypt it with the public key, and I\'m the only one who
has my secret key! If I want to send a secure reply, I use your
public key.

An additional feature is authentication, and that\'s how this
whole discussion got started. How do you know the message you got
from "David J. Golden <goldendj@pcisys.net>" really came from me?
It\'s incredibly simple to forge email headers, after all. Well,
remember how anything encrypted with one key can only be
decrypted with the other? What if I sign my message with my
private key? Then if it decrypts properly with my public key, you
KNOW the person who sent the message has to have the private key.
Since I\'m theoretically the only one with the private key, you\'re
confident I sent it.

There are some simplifications in the above, of course, but
that\'s the basic idea. For more information, as well as a bunch
of other fascinating stuff, I\'d recommend Bruce Schneier\'s
"Applied Cryptography, Second Edition," published by Wiley. He
gives a full and readable explanation of the basic concepts of
cryptography, a top-level explanation of the math, and full
algorithms and C code. The disk for the book has to be ordered
separately, as it\'s restricted under the International Trade in
Arms Regulation (ITAR) ... the book can be freely sent overseas,
but not the machine-readable version.

Actually, it makes me quite sick to my stomach.  The way it reads to me is
that *IG* is "Free Trader Beowulf" and Steve Jackson Games is going to
"rescue" Traveller-- all hail SJG!  Bah!

And as Phillip McGregor pointed out in another post, GURPS Traveller is
(almost without a doubt) the future of Traveller.  Again-- Bah!

Traveller\'s future has always been in the hands of the *people* that play
the game.  The original Beowulf dialog on the front box cover of CT was
aimed at would-be players, IMHO, giving them the opportunity to play
characters coming to the rescue of Free Trader Beowulf.  I\'m sure it
*could* be interpreted as an answering hail to that cry for help circa 1105
(thus keeping the timeline flowing), but considering the timing of the
advertisement and IG\'s current "problems", I somehow doubt it.

> Also, in SJ Games News on page 5 is a bit of information about the 1998 
> release of GURPS Traveller and their tentative plans for its future.

Please tell us more.  I honestly can\'t see how a release schedule for GURPS
could even hope to keep up with what Traveler players have been used to in
the past.  Just like White Wolf and their five "storyteller" games-- after
a major release the supplements seem to move along quite quickly.  After a
while, however, you\'re down to one or two books a year (or the line gets
completely ignored altogether).  Or worse: Games Workshop-- where games
come and go, never to be seen again.  At least IG is dedicated towards
their one product and the T4 line will only disappear when IG finally does.
With Steve Jackson, they could drop Traveller support the moment something
else comes along.
 
> Count me still excited about any new Traveller product that comes out -- 
> regardless of who is producing it.

I guess so.  As long as it is aimed at Traveller *in general*, and not at
SJG\'s "non-rebellion, Strephon-is-still-alive, non-canon" universe.
Remember the huge stink that erupted when GDW released TNE-- with HEPlaR
drives replacing reactionless Thrusters?  How about when IG released system
after system for starship construction and/or combat and players bitched
about no backwards-compatibility with previous material?  Whatever SJG
comes up with that goes against everything in Traveller after 1116 will
make those debates look insignificant.

For those devoted fans that still play in the CT era, GURPS Traveller /may/
be a good thing.  However, for those that prefer to play in either the MT-,
TNE- and/or T4- eras, GURPS: Traveller would have to be pretty damn good to
make them switch over.  Why switch to a clunky, rule saturated system like
GURPS when they are already happily using a house-modified version of MT,
TNE, or T4.x?

How many of us can *HONESTLY* say that we will adopt the GURPS rules system
just to play in a non-canon SJG universe where much of what GDW and IG have
published is considered "non-canon"?  Especially when it means invalidating
the usefulness of many current and out-of-print Traveller supplements.

IMHO, the only ones that will gain from the release of GURPS Traveller is
SJG.

Ditto.

Will the free trader Beowulf still be around when "help" finally shows up?

Here\'s some relative snippages from what I have on file:

THE FOURTH FRONTIER WAR (1082-1084)
	An incident near Quar/Cronor unintentionally began the war. A
series of battles ensued in the Jewell and Cronor subsectors. Neither side
was prepared, and the war was little more than a skirmish-compared to
earlier conflicts.
	Esalin (Jewell 0204) fell in the opening weeks. The Vargr and the
Zhodani jointly assaulted Jewell and Regina subsectors, but the initial
assaults stalled at the borders. Most of the later fighting occurred in
Jewell subsector.
	The final battle, the Battle of Two Suns, was fought midway between
Yres and Menorb. Losses on both sides were heavy, but the Imperium held the
field. Had the battle gone the other way, the loss of both Yres and Menorb
would have forced the evacuation of Efate and the collapse of the coreward
end of the Regina subsector. Instead, lengthening supply lines prevented
further outworld advances.
	Emperor Strephon had delegated war powers to Norris, Duke of
Regina. This brought a speedy end to a conflict that otherwise could have
been hampered by long delays in communications between Capital and the
front. An armistice ended the war after 18 months of fighting. Instructions
and reinforcements had not reached the Marches from the Imperial capital.
	The war resulted in some realignment of accepted boundaries, but in
no real gains for either side. The Imperium lost Narval/Chronor, but it
regained two worlds from the Sword Worlds. Esalin/Jewell shifted from
Imperial control to neutral status. A joint communiqu by the Imperial and
Zhodani governments declared Esalin a neutral world in 1098.

I know, I\'d just prefer to *call* them boats not fighters.  See, fighters
bring zip-zoom SW/BG to mind, I just don\'t see space combat working like
that (don\'t think you do either), and would like to avoid any potential
confusion. ;->

As far as scents go, expose dome hardcore EPT players to the odor of

Well...the effect you are describing certainly would throw Imperial naval
tactics on its ear. Just imagine, jump-mines...um, do they jump *into* the
middle of the enemy fleet or do they jump into jump space as the enemy
fleet passes by?

The Long Lance was developed to defeat the Pacific Fleet at sea, not
in a surprise attack by aircraft. Nearly all the IJN\'s cruisers and
destroyers had it, as well as reloads for the torpedo tubes. With a
range triple that of the standard 21" torpedo in USN service, as well
as a higher speed, wakeless engines and a huge warhead, it came as a
major surprise in early WWII surface battles.

Surprise was the greatest weapon used at Pearl Harbor, that and
complacency on the part of the USN.

Oddly enough, had the PH attack not taken place, both sides had a
similar plan to put into effect. The two surface fleets would have met
out near the Marianas Islands and engaged in the biggest surface
battle ever seen. Considering the skill of the IJN in night torpedo
attacks and their superiority in carrier airpower, it is just as well
for us that they did attack at Pearl.

At least most of the battleships sunk there were raised. Had they been
sunk at sea that would not have been possible.

Actually, you\'re recalling my Imperial Interstellar Scouts Service Anthem,

Some things *can\'t* be greatly improved over their original form. Both
electric motors and transformers were over 90% efficient from their
introduction. And they haven\'t improved much since. Thiey\'ve gotten
lighter, and new materials make the remaining inefficiencies less
important.

You get improvements in things discovered before theory can explain
them. And in things where the technology limits how well the theory can
be applied (that\'s what happened with semiconductors). Others aren\'t
thought of until theory points them out. And then, if the
*implementation* technology allows, you wind up with a "perfected" tech
almost immediately.

As I vaguely recall, you need to go into the addressbook (or whatever
they call it, the list of "frequent correspondents"), and if there
isn\'t an entry for the mailing list address *make* one. Then somewhere
in the prperties for that address you have to tell your mail program
that this *specific* address can\'t handle the RTF format.

You can\'t turn it off globally. You have to do it address by address. :-(

I was thinking they would be stealth-shielded until the enemy fleet is
all around them, then they would all go into jump.  If a jump field near

I\'m not employed by SJG but I\'ve been following GURPS Traveller and from
what I\'ve heard from SJG they have no intention of competing with IG
and are gearing their Traveller line to not compete.  This is a separate
product... it is GURPS rules with the Traveller history, primarily
CT.

GURPS Traveleler is a GURPS product, not a replacement for Traveller.  If
you are currently playing T4 then it won\'t affect you.  The idea is to
get GURPS players playing Traveller... maybe they\'ll buy some T4 stuff
as a result...

GURPS Traveller is going to be aimed at the non-rebellion, Strephon-is-
still-alive, non-canon universe.  I think that this is part of the not
competing with IG thing.  I\'m sure that you will be able to use the
GURPS rules and GURPS Traveller to convert and play in any era, though.
GURPS Traveller is explicitly a deviation from the standard Traveller
universe.

GURPS is a perfectly good rules system that a lot of people use and
will make a fine Traveller game.  There\'s nothing wrong with Traveller\'s
systems, though, and nothing to force anyone to change.

GURPS Traveller is not trying to steal customers from T4.  The point is
to make it different... it will appeal to CT players who want to keep
playing in that universe...  I know it appeals to me.

> IMHO, the only ones that will gain from the release of GURPS Traveller is

And all the GURPS players who find that they enjoy the Traveller universe
and all the Traveller players who find something they like in the GURPS
supplements and possibly IG if GURPS players start buying T4 supplements
to add to their collection.

Frankly I don\'t see how GURPS Traveller can do anything but help.  At
worst it will fail and be ignored.  At best it will encourage more
people to play Traveller.

Yes, let\'s hope...

I would expect nano-tech to thrive in the medical field the most.  Other
industries would be too regulated or have paranoia hindering any
advances.  Medical nanobot solutions to many problems would be treated as
pharmaceuticals are now.

Nanobots would be treated like other biological weapons of mass
destruction.  Of course, individual acts of terroism will occur.  

If nanobots were used as weapons then anti-nanobot nanobots would be
made.

Trade would depend on what is valuable to others.  Even if you could
fabricate everything you need in the 24th century, there will always be
things you want that may be unique to another planet.  Maybe, it takes a
while to make a copy.

What I was getting at, is, when mankind has the ability to create
whatever he/she wants, the only thing still needed would be the
RESOURCES to create with.  Even NanoFabs need matter to create with.

I was wondering if RESOURCES would be the new monetary unit?

Also, with the advent of medical nanobots, would mankind create
immortality?  i.e., \'bots that constantly repaor cell damage, thus
eliminating the aging process?

	The Yacht is a versalite diplomatic vessel used by ambassadors

	I think Vilanis at tl:B had a lot of them. In FFS1 the Yacht
	was even cheaper at 40MCr/TL:A and had 2G. In FFS2 this ship
	would need fusion rockets and a fission plant reducing it 0.?G

	The problem arise of course with TPlates. HEPlaR\'s energy
	efficiency calls to the clue that HEPlaR must be a fusion
	process. TPlates are even more energy efficient, and they are
	even reactionless. Reducing the low techs now will make a

	a pp is 1m3. If the minimum size of TPs is limited to lets say
	10dt at TL:11, 25m3 at TL:12. You\'ll see them in TL:11 warships
	and TL:12+ fighters. If additionaly HEPlaR is back to powered
	from everything, we would have the TL:A small ships but not the
	near C TPLated rocks.

	the capital ships in traveller can be as many agile as a fighter,

	As its best to shoot fighers before they come in range with your
	weapons, ships have larger lasers and better sensors to have a
	higher range. Capital ships additionaly have spinal mount against
	other capital ship ships.

	They have its called sandcaster and is versalite also agains

	Canon is from the german canon where its priest prayers songs.
	For real its the shorthand of canonic.

	Instand FTL would address some implicit time paradoxa, for this
	reason canon is that nothing is faster than ship, and a ship
	take one week regardless wether it jumps from terra to jupiter
	or bernard star or even up to 36 parsec.

Alright, you can\'t leave me hanging on this one.  How are Kanji not pictograms,
Kenji?
(oooh, bad pun, also slightly off since Kanji is the Japanese term - I have no
idea what the Chinese term is).  I see the Chinese paper every day at my news
stand.  The characters are Kanji [sic].  Looks like pictograms to me.  What am I
missing?  (and please say more than something about a pictogram is a
representational drawing/symbol of the concept meant to be communicated, e.g.,
the character for "tree" looks like a tree).

Yes indeed, under the CT rules in High Guard, I had a 2 million ton

I don\'t think Sandcasters are what he had in mind.  All they are is
canisters of sand particles that obscure laser beams.  I think he meant
a forcefield of charged particles as a barrier to beam weapons.

I\'m not sure that\'s workable, and probably not \'Canon\'..:)

That\'s a *direct* steal from Heinlein\'s "Citizen of the Galaxy". And as
Heinlein notes, the idea goes back to Pheonican traders bartering with
African natives!

You can see from the above that they come thru in "quoted printable"
format which doesn\'t do me a lot of good (especially note the "split
line" mess).

Also, If I convert (by hand) the above I get a shaded box char for the
B2, and a single vertical line graphics char for the B3. Checking my
references, I suspect that they started out as a superscript 2 and
superscript 3 respectively.

For a Mac, they are the trademark symbol and not equal sign (QuickDraw
chars) or 1/4 and 1/2 (MacLatin).

I could go one and list what they are on other systems I own, but I
trust that you get the idea. :-)

Actually, explosive bolts are far from destructive. They are
*frequently* used currently when you have something that has to be

unbolting will take, or you can\'t afford the *stresses* that an uneven

Dig around for collections of stories by John Brunner. One collection
has the three "Galactic Consumer reports" articles he wrote. One is
about "twin tube wishing machines" which are essentially an enhanced
nano-factory that builds from the user\'s mental images. 

He covers the shortcomings pretty well. For example, one planet had a
kid get access to the family machine, which had a faulty "censor unit"
(he calls it something else). So the kid, who is upset at not having
been given an ice cream sundae for desert, creates a bunch of
super-robot soldiers and conquers the planet. He has a mile long soda
fiuntain built. There\'s a comment that things are expected to return to
normal in a few years as he\'ll have died from improper diet by then. :-)

The resources are all around you. Anything capable of nano-fabrication
can also *dis*-assemble stuff. So you can feed in junk plus energy and
get out what you want. As long as you stick to the *practical* side of
things, you don\'t rerally need all that much of the harder to find
elements. 

What will be valuable are the "design" patterns you feed into the
system so it knows *how* to build something. A Star Trek replicator
isn\'t much good without a databsase of stuff to replicate. :-)

Dig through the archives. I went into this at *great* length a year or
two back.

Which part of my signal is the encrypted IFF, and what part is "junk"?
And remember that it changes from second to second.

One method is for the transponder to read a code in the interrogate
pulse (the "challenge"), and return a code based on that. This means
that unless you know the codes, you\'d be responding with the response
to the *previous* pulse. Which makes it *really* clear that you are
trying to spoof the IFF. :-)

Challenge:	53 87  (encrypted)
Response:	4611   (encrypted)
Challenge:	81 63
Response:	5103
.....

In the above example, the challenge is sending a pair of numbers, and
the response is returning the product of the numbers. In reality, it
gets a lot more complicated.

And the cost of each missile is getting close to a fighters\' cost.

Unfortunately, fighters aren\'t really viable against capital ships. In very
big massed swarms, maybe, but they are viable in the small
ship/anti-piracy/ground support element.

(note the same type of definite kill range applies to missiles as it does
to fighters)

Merrick, my reading of M0 was that the fighter gave the Imperium an edge in
destroying the piracy problem in Core. The actual absorption of systems
into Cleon\'s new empire was done by the Imperial Navy\'s capital vessels or
economic domination. Fighters were more critical in breaking the back of
the problems stopping trade. IMO, of course.

(In voice of Rick Moranis out of Ghostbusters)

Boyyy, Ahhm glad Ahhm just a little ol starliner out here....I know
those  fighter guys don\'t ever engage beyond visual range \'cause they
don\'t issue us military transponder codes.

Its good to know someone\'s out here protecting the spacelanes from
thoase nasty doggy Vargr raider guys, so I can get all they nice, paying
passengers to Dentus.  I love the Imperial military except when they
board me.

Hey...whats that...it looks like a..miss....ooooooooooooooooooooooh!


Dentus/Regina (0601-C979500-A) Date: 176-1110
According to Admiralty sources Imperial gunship units mistakenly engaged
and destroyed the Moranis starliner Strange Brew late yesterday evening.
Naval elements and system rescue forces are responding, but due to the
lethatlity of weapons involved little hope is held for survivors.
A spokesman for the Admiralty cited poor adherance to visual
identification rules of engagement , and stressed all pilots would be
briefed on the necessity to properly identify targets in the future. He
also went on to state that transcripts show a partial and improper
identification took place from the starliner\'s IFF, resulting in an
"engage green" verification to the units operating insystem during Vargr
cleanup operations. 
Forces from Vice-Admiral Elphinstone\'s command have been ordered to
stand down for a period of one day to review rules of engagement in this
heavily transited civilian system.

Carefull what you bet, Dave.  What did he counter-offer?  Heh.  I would tend
to agree with you at this point, however, you are assuming one thing which
may not in fact be the case: did anyone but you take the time to evaluate
the message or sig?  I didn\'t, even though I have the tools to do so -- it\'s
a big pain in the Aslan, and I\'ve not been impressed with *any* email client
that\'s attempted integration with PGP.  Most people like their privacy, but
the economic time tradeoff of using electronic envelopes is still too high
for most "honest" people (like there are any! I\'m a cynic today - forgot to
take the medication).  Besides, no one that I correspond with wants the
hassle, and it\'s not important to me as I haven\'t decided yet how to bomb
the... oh, nevermind!  Heh.

For military applications, it would definitely be useful and used, I hope,
but civilians are lazy, and most would certainly be taken in by a forged
post with a public key sig on it that looked like it was from you (hell, it
wouldn\'t even have to be your own key -- we could make a new public key with
the name Dave Golden as the owner, sign the message, and even register it
with a public key server or two as YOURS, and then sign the message, spoof
your email address, and viola, you just threatened the UN Secretary
General\'s life via email -- try and explain it away in court that you never
had the key in question on your easily erased electronic storage media...
presumption of innocence only applies after the kind and gentle officers of
the law get you to court, if you get there -- ask Steve Jackson).
Cryptography is only as good as the security of the keys and how the
veracity of the key holders\' identities can be determined: ultimately it
comes back to physical security.

And in other news, a single transmission was intercepted from the
starliner.  Apparently it\'s captain thought the Vargr were attacking,
from this little bit of voice transmission :

I would think John Brunner\'s works would be way too outdated to be of
any consequence?  Or has he written anything since the 70\'s?  Last book

I\'m convinced that I could not duplicate the IFF signature of the enemy.
Could my character, being the sneaky devil he is, install an enemy\'s

Yes.  Better have the correct days codes though, or you will wind up
with the correct box but squawking yestredays code.  This shows up as a
"negative" interrogation, meaning the fighter marks you as

"Kill me, please"

How to get the correct codes?  Seeing as the can change very fast and
multiple times(ie what was good 1 hour ago ain\'t good anymore,) fat
chance.

How do they change?  Manually.  Its a huge pain in the butt to remember
to swap squawks especially since you may be "busy" at the time dodging
rocks, fighters, etc.

Problem with 2D is a lot of those familiar stars are scattered
vertically.  You culd build a real map of stars in a 1 parsec 2D plane
of Sol, but it would be very empty.

I\'m currently detailing an area in the Aquila Rift.  Contrary to popular
thought in Trav rifts are not voids.  Instead they are areas of immense
dust(compression) clouds.  They are unnaviagle by jdrive due to the fact
you can\'t see what is in there and range it properly.

Starcharting with elements like true rifts requires 3D.

As for Sol centered, 2300 near star map did that quite nicely out to
50ly.  The chart went no further, but with the Hipparcos data now
becoming available for the entire girth of the Imperium I think I\'ll
have a valid 3D image of Imperial/charted space within a year or two.

A problem is the sheer mass of data.  Could be tough.  Hipparcos imaged
600,000(?) systems out to 300ly(?)  Corrections requested here

First, how did you get it?

Second, there are many, many settings for an IFF transponder to be set
at. Pilots and vehicle drivers are given that setting right before a
mission. You might have the equipment but no way of knowing what
setting to use.

True, but storage becomes a problem and I want to stack and rotate
sectors atop each other to give an overall picture. Neither does this
image the dust clouds and other stellar debris I want in my game.

Nope, we got the octopus project.  Biggest in the world, right out my

Someday soon (relatively speaking), the mssuranonultuplanssugadalisa will
be appearing on Freelance Traveller as a new "minor race" for Traveller...
feedback/collaboration from others familiar with both the Third and Petal
Throne Empires will be requested.
