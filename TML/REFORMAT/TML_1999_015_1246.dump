Short-range is a relative term. I don\'t know about ASRAAM, and AIM-9X doesn\'t
technically exist yet, but people are talking about IR missiles with 20-mile
rear-aspect ranges, which is close to medium-generation AIM-7 sparrows...
and the new-generation french missiles (whose name escapes me), I believe, will
have an IR seeker for its medium range version. They won\'t replace radar for very
long (80 mile+) ranges, but are pretty respectable for medium (20-40 mile) ranges.
Past that, range is limited by atmospheric absorbtion among other things...but only
because you\'re looking through a *lot* of air - much more than looking up or down 
from a satellite.

I certainly wasn\'t making those claims. Resolution will be limited by diffraction,
though, not by atmospheric effects, which is what the post I was responding to
was claiming. (Diffraction is worse for IR than visible, so resolution even from
low orbit - which is where the imaging satellites are - will probably be a 
couple of meters.) Whether IR imaging from orbit could see a human with that
I can\'t say. Probably an engine (not seeing details, but telling that the source
is there), probably not a cigarette.

 Until the players realize that, while computer games have AIs that limit
 their actions, RPGs have far fewer constraints.  (At least, I know that
 _I_ have been frustrated by computer games that wouldn\'t let me try what

	I just wanted to clarifiy my post a bit.   I find FtF games much more
satisfying than any computer game, by far.   What I meant when I said "tame"
and "stodgy" was not in excitement sense but rather in the "moral" sense.   In
other words I think that parents might find RPG\'s much less "dangerous" or
"offensive" when compared to computer and video games with graffic depictions
of guts blowing up all around.  I just don\'t see that there would be as much
of a reaction to RPG\'s in the present "graffic" environment.

Tastes vary; I didn
care for it too much. Allt he conspiracy stuff seems to undermine
Niven\'s early work quite a bit - you have to either assume that smart,
powerful people like Lucas Garner are (a) evil conspirators, or (b) really
really stupid dupes, neither of which I like much. I\'ve never been
a big conspiracy fan. Also the (early) books I read suffer from 
everyone stumbling across Thrint/Tnuctipun prevered in stasis from
billions of years ago - kind of like people in Traveller always stumble across
ancients, I suppose - very overused. And too much of the inate superiority of
humans to stupid aliens...

The satellites haven\'t gotten any bigger, and resolution is limited by mirror
size; it\'s hard to fit anything bigger than 4 meters into a Titan payload shroud.
So the ability of satellites to see fine detail is unlikely to have changed.
(At least the professional satellite watchers - AvLeak and the FAS -
think so.)

I have no professional knowledge but I understand the physics involved.

You still don\'t want *snipers* to do this.  You\'d use regular line troops.

So what?  If they\'re not going off in my face, they\'re not my problem at the 
moment, they\'re *somebody else\'s*.  The only time I worry about grenades is 
when somebody\'s throwing them at me.  At somebody else, well, tough luck,

I didn\'t really need to go back and read it again. I remembered it
specifically. However, I\'ll gladly repost an excerpt from your original
post:

\'You could hear them "a mile away" and could pick some of them off, but
they\'d get their "food" for the day.\'

Those are your words, not mine. I call your attention to the part where you

But why then even bother with the howl? Just because they\'re descended from
dogs?

Would you like me to quote the entirety of your original post on the
subject? Y\'know, the one I quoted from towards the beginning of this
message? The one in which you ascribe moronic tactics to Vargr based on the
fact that they\'re descended from dogs? I wasn\'t even referring to your post
about the real world soldiers.

On the other hand, I see you\'ve reduced yourself to personal insults. I have
responded to your messages politely. I have not insulted you, or harassed
you. Even though you caused problems on the list with other folks, I wasn\'t
being an asshole to you.

I\'m going to ask you politely:Would you kindly deal with me with the same
respect that I have given you? In other words, don\'t be a dick to me. If you
have a problem with my request, then don\'t expect me to acknowledge your
existence in the future.

Look, you are flipping back and forth between ground combat and space
combat. Settle with one or the other for now. If you want to talk about
space combat, say you\'re talking about space combat. If you want to talk
about ground combat, say you\'re talking about ground combat. Most of the
examples you\'ve given have pertained to ground combat.

I don\'t have the time or inclination to discuss this with you if you\'re
going to flip flop whenever you feel it suits you.

Alright. I refer you to your own quote towards the top of this message. You
are the one who said it, not me.

>But the booms have secondary effects, nevertheless, which was my point.
>(You think I don\'t know that artillery is used to blow shit up?)


I had pointed out how "chest-thumping" to avert combat were remnants of the
behavior of our ancestors.

Your response was that artillery and tank fire served the same purpose.

I then pointed out that artillery and tank fire has a specific reason on the
battlefield, in that it directly destroys enemy resources...

Silly rituals and behavior that gets you wiped out on the battlefield are
two _totally_ different things. You can\'t mix apples and oranges.

You rudely accuse me of not reading your post (which I did), and then you
just ignore segments of my post at whim.

Please scan up a few lines and read the part where I said, clearly, "No
Kafer did not act like roaches, not one bit. They acted like creatures with
a low degree of sentient intelligence."

Now, how that would imply that I was saying that roaches were sentient is
anybody\'s guess. I was saying that Kafer were sentient.

Which thud gun are you talking about? A book reference, or page reference
would be really handy. In fact, after a cursory scan at the "Director\'s
Guide" and "Kafer Dawn" I have found no references to Kafer dislocating
their own shoulders. In fact, I see a line ("Kafer Dawn" p. 27) that says
"Kafer technology appears to be, on the whole, more advanced than that of
humans."

Further, I see plenty of nifty gadgets listed. In the "Director\'s Guide" we
have a large ship, a fighter craft, and a stutterwarp missile. In "Kafer
Dawn" I see a revolver, an assault rifle, a laser rifle, a vehicle mounted
plasma gun, a remote anti-vehicle missile system and several vehicles.

On the whole, I\'d say they must be pretty damn smart in the wild.

If you knew all this, you\'d probably not say that they acted like roaches. I
was merely informing you that you were underestimating what the Kafers
_could_ do when they weren\'t in danger.

>So by your previous statement, are you saying that the palmetto bugs here

Not at all. Perhaps you should do what you accuse others of not doing and
actually read the post you\'re responding to.

If the target is defenseless and your plan is to overwhelm it, why bother
psyching it out? Vargr go to war for Charisma, for self-preservation, for profit, 
out of anger, even for principles, but they don\'t seem to have a racial 
tendency to go to war for entertainment purposes.

Economy of force. While you focus an overwhelming amount of your
forces on an easily-destroyed and helpless target, those forces of yours 
are unavailable to counter moves by less-than-helpless enemy forces.
A unit wasted by inefficient deployment is almost as useless as a unit
thatstays home and watches "Packmates VII: Heat of the Night" on holovid
(the pay-per-view channels, you know).

Perhaps you gain a morale advantage by slaughtering an exposed
enemy unit (or group of enemy civilians) with your mobile force.
Perhaps your enemy gets a morale advantage as all his drop marines
start taking up Vargr hunting as a personal hobby. Regardless, the time
you spent butchering something of his that was harmless your enemy 
probably spent butchering something of yours that was useful.

Of course, if Vargr attacked this way, there will always be the
minimally clued-in enemy commander who will provide a perfect
target for such a raid. 

"Force leader! A human mobile hospital convoy has fallen out of position!
We are overrunning them right now...." <static as the fusion bomb in one
of the fake remote-piloted "hospital trucks" detonates...>

Add the Vargr racial pride. If my reading of Vargr source material is
accurate, frightening or otherwise "gaining Charisma" over a human or other
non-Vargr  would be considered pointless - a Vargr who bothered with such 
games would probably suffer a loss of vital Charisma, as he obviously is 
scaring humans because he\'s too much of a wimp to scare another Vargr.

As for Cliff\'s idea for a howl-sound-inducing ray gun - Cliff, are you now
suggesting that the ability to create a "howl" is a minor ability of a more
complex weapon, much as firing starshell flares is a minor ability
of a US Navy Ticonderoga-class Cruiser? A weapon that can make
hull plates of a tank or starship resonate in piercing howls needs
capabilities just to pull off that stunt that would give it some very
magical...er, "sufficiently advanced technology" capabilities.

Vargr may have Psychological Warfare units. As Vargr are scientifically
capable sentient beings, I believe their Psychological Warfare techniques 
will be oriented towards what their enemies are vulnerable to, rather than 
how Terran canines may have behaved thousands of years ago.

3I wins it hands down.  Not only does their technology overwhelm the Pak 
Protectors, but also the Protectors are extremely predictable.  As Brennan 
said, there\'s very little free will in a Protector.  They\'ll figure out the 
best possible tactic every time and use it.  All you have to do is figure out 
what it\'ll be and sucker them into it, then clobber them.

There are a couple of points I\'d like to respond to here:

First of all, every kid plays video games. Well, nearly every kid plays
video games. When parents see their kids playing video games, it\'s not so
bad. The opponents of violence in video games have not done a very good job
of getting any sort of decent lobby going, so it\'s not to abnormal. Video
games are a hot commodity. There\'s tons of books floating around on the
history of video games, the relevance of video games in society, etc...  I\'m
not sure if it\'s the violence in video games that bothers most parents, but
how much time their kids spend playing video games when they should be doing
homework.

Roleplaying games are another story entirely! Parents may see their kid with
a roleplaying game and wonder what they\'re up to. After all, the kid sits in
his room for hours rolling up subsectors and animal encounter tables. What\'s
he _really_ up to? Then they half-remember the seminal (and atrocious) Tom
Hanks made for TV movie "Mazes & Monsters," which was about the dangers of
roleplaying... Then they remember how roleplaying games were "suspected" as
the "cause" for several teen suicides throughout the 80s. Hell, if they\'re
from the Philadelphia area (like me) they may even remember how roleplaying
games supposedly had something to do with a highly publicized rape and
double murder.

What, do you think most parents pay attention to what it is that their kids
are doing, exactly? If they already think that "Dungeons and Dragons" is
bad, then Traveller will be just as bad.

A friend of mine travelled from the USA to Australia (Sydney area
I believe) some years ago, and one thing that struck her was how
the average Australian response to any request seemed to be "No."

For example, she went into a bank and asked the teller, "Can you
give me change for a dollar?"
Teller: "No."
Her: "No? But I have the dollar right here!"
Teller: "Well, maybe."
Her: "This is a bank, isn\'t it?"
Teller: "Well, OK..."

She had a few more examples...the pattern she seemed to see was
that the intial answer to a request would always be "No", the second
answer would be "Maybe", and the third (or so) answer (to a reasonable
request) would be "Yes". 

I\'d imagine there would be impatient or meek people who would give up
and go elsewhere on the first "No".

Is this kind of response common in Australian culture, or was she getting
some kind of different treatment because she was a tourist/outsider?

ObTrav: Thinking about all the little vagaries between how people do things 
from planet to planet, and the misunderstandings this can lead to.

Where? I\'d love to get my hands on a legit copy of MT1 (actually, I do have
a legit copy of MT2, however the disks are dead. Oh great, I still do have
the manuals, though!).

It\'s a shame that these games are so long out of print and so difficult to
find.

    'body' => 'It\'s difficult to make the aliens in our games sufficiently "alien" to make
them feel right, without going so far as to be silly, or making them
ineffectual. Taking a racial trait to extremes is not always the right
answer.

Certain threads about Vargr in combat seem to fit into this category. How
should we make a Vargr raid seem different from an attack by a squad of
human cut-throats, without taking it to a silly extreme?

Well, Vargr are pack animals  - I\'m not going to be specific and say
"dogs" - whose ancenstors had reached a lower level of social spohistication
when they were transplanted than humans had. From canon we also know that
Vargr society is turbulent and fluid, characterised by struggles for power
and charisma.

It seems to me that while vargr are more than smart enough to realise that
acting like a mob on the battlefield is ineffective (and lethal), you might
get the situation where some idiot decides he wants all the charisma for an
attack, and hey, this target looks weak enough to take without sticking to
the tame and safe plan.... so somebody might go off at half-cock and attack
early. Occasionally. At other times a position might fall apart because
somebody thought that there was less charisma lost in abandoning a hopeless
position than in getting pounded.

But this\'d be quite rare. vargr can fight, and fight well. They can use
technology to give them an advantage. Perhaps their organisation might be a
bit feudal in nature, with, say,  the support gunners all being the personal
following of whomever has the most charisma among them, but nobody is going
to challenge for leadrship in the middle of a firefight (well, not usally.
But then stupidity is not an exclusively human trait).

We know from canon that Vargr favour the raid. I also infer that their pack
metality would mean that their small units would be very cohesive, and
loyalty to pack-mates would be an important factor. They would be very good
light infantry/rangers or assault troops. Vargr "special forces" might be
fun... but bigger organisations would tend to fray about the edges, unless
led by a very charismatic leader - who had better keep on winning to provide
evidence of his charisma (perhaps setting up a string of easy victories?) or
watch the whole thing start to come apart.

Knowing the effect that wild animal cries in the night have upon humans,
vargr might engage in psyops to unsettle their targets or to misdirect them.
They\'re certainly smart enough for that. But they would also know that
advertising that you\'re about to attack (this "howl" business) is not a
great idea.

I see vargr as thus being very good infantrymen, with squads fightng
tenacisouly but suffering breakdowns at the higher command levels. Sudden
attacks and pockets of stubborn resistance would characterise any action,
while high command struggled to keep everyone following the plan.
Glory-hunters might derail the plan completely, or might carry through an
attack which has gone horribly wrong, just on balls alone.

But however they do it, vargr will fight smart unless some other
consideration gets in the way.

There\'s a tendency (especially, I seem to recall among teenage gamers) to
write in stuff becasue it "sound cool", which upon examination doesn\'t work.
I refer to inverse laser microphones and stuff like that - a laser capable
of inducing vibrations (sound) in a metal structure would have to do so by
hitting it with a great many of those quantised engergy packets in order to
get the metal moving.

Sadly, this causes an effect called "heating" which is detrimental to the
metal. IE: This device would vapourise the target before making much useful
sound. An example of a "cool" device that doesn\'t survive reality. If we
want aliens to be plausibly alien they have to be believeable. Better to
focus on what they do and how they organise themselves to  do it than some
single trait and a few gadgets. "Vargr howl beofre an attack" does not make
them alien, it makes them one-dimsneional and a bit dumb. We need, I think,
to be more subtle: how are they different from human? How are they similar?

Bottom line is: everyone is influenced by the way everyone else does things.
Being killed is quite a strong influence, anfd Vargr like anyone else will
try to avoid that by a bit of common sense. I think that\'s called Evolution?

Space combat in 2300 AD is at ranges where a cockpit view would show
nothing. According to the directors guide it use a map of hexes each 600 000
km in diameter. Ain\'t no point having a cockpit view at those sort of
ranges. I haven\'t seen star cruiser but I wouldn\'t expect it to be a
dogfight kind of system.

I thought sound was vibrations? I thought that lasers heated things up,
which does make the electrons speed up, but with a rapid enough change of
heat so the target expands and contracts thus moving the atmosphere so as to
produce audible sound? So the laser heats the area up ,what\'s cooling the
area down again? Wouldn\'t most solids shatter with such a rapid temperature
change?
These and many more questions remain to be answered, if you have a relevant
URL to look at please post it.

I was amazed to be looking over the list tonight to find these 
posting on Stratfor.  I am also very happy to see them and glade that 
you enjoy them.  Considering that I use to work for the company when 
they were in Baton Rouge and LSU and still do work for the Profesor 
who edits them I ll pass along the fact that I saw these post.

	How about this:    Jump drive doesn\'t work in a gravitational field.    The
inside of a ship has artificial gravity equal to 1-G, much more than
experienced at 100 diameters from a world surface.   Thus by using only canon
information we can conclude a Jump drive will not work inside of another ship
(in Jump space or not).

Just a little nit, Brennan wasn\'t Pak, he was a human protector.  He took
over "Home" (not Wunderland) in the process of trying to kill the Pak
colonization fleet.  That\'s the problem with the Pak using the technique
you suggest; human protectors will try to *kill* the Pak, lest they do the
same to humans, and the humans start with better technology.  I\'m trying to
imagine what a protector could do with Traveller-style gravitics and meson
weapons.  It\'s not pretty.

Personally I consider this very, very unlikely. Yes, Aslan clan lords _might_
send off huge battle fleets to support their _ihatei_, but I think it is
completely contrary to their main interests. However, I had a long discussion
with someone else about this a few months ago and was unable to convince him
one little bit (and vice versa, of course), so I\'ll try another tack this time.

First read this quote from _Alien Module 1:Aslan_, p. 4:

"A deep-seated territorial instinct causes male Aslan to have an inordinate
(from the human point of view) concern for the aquisition and control of
land. The ownership of land is a major goal in the lives of most Aslan
males."

Now imagine that you are an Aslan clan lord, and consider what priority you
would place on the following concerns:

        Retaining control of your present holdings.

        Investing in expanding the size and strength of your own
        holdings.

        Adding neighboring planets and systems to your holdings.

        Taking over control of planets and systems so far from your
        core holdings that the forces raised there would have
        difficulty supporting you.

        Settling _ihatei_ close enough to your holdings for you to
        retain direct control of them.

        Outfitting _ihatei_ expeditions that will travel scores of
        parsecs away from your holdings and settle down there.

Once you\'ve decided on your priorities and once you realize that all your
fellow neighboring clan lords propably have similar priorities (those of you
who know the game DIPLOMACY will realize what I\'m getting at), decide how
big a percentage of your yearly budget you\'d want to spend on outfitting
_ihatei_ expeditions. Then decide how big a slice of your regular clan forces
you\'d be willing to send away for several years to escort your _ihatei_.

Now, once you have an idea of how many _ihatei_ fleets you can expect the
Aslan Hierate to produce, put yourself in the place of an _ihatei_ admiral.
First have a look at the map and decide how close you\'d have to be to the
Great Rift crossing to prefer going across it to travelling to the other
borders (Hint: It takes a typical jump-3 _ihatei_ fleet a full year to cross
the Great Rift).

One figure we unfortunately don\'t have is the size of a typical _ihatei_
fleet. We do know that one typical _Ihatei_ squadron had two 10,000 T
cruisers and two 50,000 T transports (and two scouts), but we don\'t know
how many squadrons to a fleet. So work out how many squadrons you think a
typical _ihatei_ fleet would have and consider your fighting assets:

For each squadron you have two small obsolescent cruisers (Imperial cruisers
and battleriders range from 20,000 to 75,000 T) of a TL 3 levels lower than
Imperial standard and 2 levels lower than Imperial colonial standard. You
also have two transports each carrying 10,000 people in low berths. Since
these are complete immigrant families, only 20-30% of them would be males.
How big a percentage of those would be warriors is up to you. Possibly all
of them.

Once you have an idea of how strong you are, have a look at the map of the
Trojan Reach and decide where you\'d have the best chance of establishing a
lasting settlement with the best chance of long-term survival. Keep in mind
that the _average_ expenditure of Imperial planets on system defenses (army
and COACC included) is 2% of GWP and decide how likely it is that systems
that have spent the last 500 years across a 10 parsec neutral zone from your
typical Aslans would be among those spending less than the average.

Since I know from previous dicussions that not everybody consider the notion
that a major world like Tobia would spend practically nothing on system
defenses, relying almost completely on Imperial forces for their defense
completely ridiculous, you might also want to ponder how many warriors it
would take to conquer and control a TL 15 world with 20 billion people and a
law level of 5, even assuming they have no other system defenses than their
police forces and whatever freedom fighters would spontaneously arise if it
was invaded by Aslans.

Of course, you can always team up with other _Ihatei_ fleets. Before you do
that, you may want to consider your own ambitions and those of your fellow
admirals and decide how far you want to trust them.

In ACQ, the morale of Vargr NPCs is heavily affected by the ststus of their
leader.  If the leader goes beserk, they go beserk.  If the leader breaks
or is killed, the Vargr under him tend to crumble.

The reason I prefer FtF gaming over the computer is two fold. The first is
that AI sucks (IMO). Second, and more important to me; is the social aspects.
I prefer to be surrounded by a table of friends and aquaintances and
interacting with them, then to stare at a computer tube, and type away. I
would even prefer to talk to the TML face to face or at least on a telephone,
but that\'s impractical... I game at a store that does both. I see a hell of a
lot more people skills at the table than at the screen (and this is a bank of
5-6 computers, so friends can kibitz to each other about their computer
games...). I think face to face gaming is healther IMO...

Ob Trav: Hmm...the need for face to face sentient interactions, even though
there is enough tech for one to never leave one\'s apartment/flat... A good
example is on a passenger starship. Each cabin is self contained as far as
needs goes (food, clothing, entertainment, bodily functions). However, there
is still common space for entertaining and socializing. One can eat by oneself
in their cabin, or at the dining table with the others. This must be preferred
in the majority of the cases, as high passage implies served meals and
entertainment, while middle passage suggests spending more time in the cabin
fending for oneself....

So according to my postulates, a ship that engages th J-Drives in jumpspace

this is very dangerous ! And if you go to the n+6th dimension or higher,
chances are high those

shown,
that you can survive higher dimensional jumps. The rules implie that. What
exactly happens in those hyperhyper dimensions (behind the n+5 barrier) should
be up to 
the gamemaster.

 In which way do CT an T4 use the same TL scale? Looking at FF&S2 it
seems pretty much identical to FF&S1 in the treatment of TL:s. Also, IIRC
the TL-8 section of Emperor\'s Arsemal looks pretty modern day.

  Of course I don\'t have nearly all T4 material. Does Emperor\'s vehicles
for example have air/rafts at TL-8?

 I agree, that The GURPS TL system is a pretty solid one. Adapting it to
Traveller takes some serious re-adjustment, however, and much of that
seems to be heavily taste-dependent.

  Most technologies thst would break the GTL-12 = TTL-15 comparison have
been either moved to other TL:s or stated not to exist at all in GT (eg.
force screens). Starangely, antimatter power seems to have been omitted.
At least I couldn\'t find any mention in GT at a quick glance. (Could be
there, though. Somebody tell me if you find it.)

  Indeed. So my question is, would it really have been impossible to move
FTL drives from GTL-9 to GTL-8, and make the conversion TTL-9 = GTL-8 ?

There were adds in various computer magazines, many (4-5?) years ago, for a
"Star Cruiser" based multiplayer game with 3-d Wing Commander-type
views. If memory serves me well, it was being advertised by the very mpgn
that hosts this list (in its primitive early incarnation.) It did explictly
mention being based on "Star Cruiser". (MPGN had several other games based
on gdw wargame titles.) 

However, I never actually heard of anyone *playing* this, even in beta-test
form - my assumption is that it never got past the level of having 
mock-up art for ads.

As others have noted,since "Star Cruiser" combat takes place at 
million-km ranges, it can\'t have been a completely faithful implementation.

(Boy, two posts vaguely supportive of Clif in one day...)

Though I do not in any way agree with much of what Clif has suggested...the 
general view now of TNE\'/T4\'s magical "Grav focus lasers"[1] is that they
have a gravity wave travelling with the laser pulse to keep it collimated.
The wave is too weak to be a weapon itself - about a G or two for a 
millisecond - but could produce a "whumm..." and/or slightly shake a ship
in a near-miss. You could imagine firing the grav pulse without the
laser to give people a wake-up call.

It depends where you come from:

One of the Junior members of my Wargames Club let slip that he visited
a *gaming* club every Friday night and he was asked to explain himself
to the headmaster (his mother was summoned to be present as well)

As far as the head was concerned, whereas a *games* club was perfectly

A sniper is just a soldier who has been trained to snipe and has the right

Yeah but why does it constantly get "best place to live" votes? I spent a
summer at Cedar Rapids (1981) after 11th. grade. I took a computer science
course (in Fortran!) for college credit, at the University of Iowa. Very nice
college town. They had a game store, and I was introduced to wargaming; yea!.
I bought Ogre/GEV, and played D+D in the dorm. Unfortunately I didn\'t see
Traveller. That had to wait another year...:-(. I was impressed by the
"niceness" of the people. The one thing I hated was that the town went to
sleep at 9PM (and this a college town!). I didn\'t have wheels, or much money,
so I was bored out of my mind when I finished my work, and I couldn\'t get a
game going. I wouldn\'t mind living there, as long as I had a car, so I could
road trip to some place more fun on the weekends....

Ob Trav: Maybe this is a good description of a high tech high pop world. A
nice, pleasant place to live and raise a family, but boring as hell. The

A Canadaian gunsmith made a bolt action *pistol* to deal with bear and

I don\'t even want to *think* about .50 BMG "hollow point" if such
exists. :-)

Well, I expect that they\'d be more or less equivalent, just with
different temp ranges, and (possibly) different "precipitation".

Of course, truly *alien* biochemistries are going to be rare, simply
because the elemental abundances in the universe favor water/CO2 on
"rocky" type planets. Gas giants will be very different, but also not
visited much.

Have any details? Because as I understand it, *horsetails* (one of the

You\'ve just destroyed both ships. 

Ship A is *definitely* inside the "10 diameter" danger zone of ship B,
no matter *how* you calculate it. In fact, you are effectively doing a
jump from *less* than .5 diameters (ie a jump from the "surface" of a
planet). So Ship A has had it.

I figure that the side effects of ship A *trying* to establish a jump
bubble will be sufficient to ruin ship B.

If I was the ref, I\'d ask for the ship and character sheets. Then when
asked what happened, I\'d simply say "The ships are never heard from
again, so your *new* characters won\'t know what happened..."

There are absolutely no used software stores in my area (as a matter of

You are correct to an extent. However, it\'s not _exact_ memory that we have
to worry about. ;)

It\'s half remembering the excellently bad "Mazes and Monsters" (both the
book by Rona Jaffe, and the TV movie it spawned), and any number of "yellow
journalistic" reports on the subject that we have to worry about.

Then again, perhaps it\'s more recent around here! There was just a rape and
double murder in the area just a couple of years ago which the media claimed
was tied into the murderers roleplaying...

If they\'re so weak, why the need to overwhelm them?  You use psyops to
shake a steady force.  It worked well in the Gulf War for one side (70% of
the Iraqis who surrendered had a Psyops surrender flier in their
possession.) and very poorly for the other ("Bart Simpson is sleeping with
your wife!" Radio Baghdad propaganda broadcast)

Yep.  And that\'s rarely a matter of trying to scare people.  Psyops is a
matter of destroying the will to fight.  The best one I ever heard of was
the Allies printing up bogus editions of the German army newspaper Signal,
and air dropping them with captured German parachutes.  The papers were
well written, and subtly contained information about how bad things were
going.

To the subject at hand, yes.  We aren\'t discussing "some race that is
wolf-like, in a blank setting."  We are discussing the Vargr of Traveller.
This means we have to pay at least a little lip-service to the established
canon on the subject, along with the rules and spirit of the game.

Right.  And those signs at Schofield Barracks, Ft. Benning, Ft. Bragg, Camp
Casey, etc., etc., all said "we\'re number 2, we try harder?"  In the real
Army (what was your MOS and dates of service anyway?) every organization
claims to be the best, every branch claims to be doing the real work, and
we all agree the Navy are a bunch of fops in silly hats.

Clif, the term "stand-off" has a specific and exact meaning in terms of
weaponry.  It means that the weapon platform is firing from a position
where it can not be hit by return fire.  Your use of the language is
imprecise.

Ah.  Once again, Clif shows his masterful self control and tact.  Clif, Now
that we\'re back in space again, why not just pump a few hundred thousand Mj
down that laser and actually hurt your target?  In space combat, you have
two goals; you either want to destroy the enemy, or disable the enemy so
that you can board her.  If you wish to board, the optimal solution is to
intimidate the enemy into surrendering.  We have an interesting concept
here on the drawing boards called "radio."  It works something like this:

"Human trader!  We are the Kfoueng ship Tzarr\'agh, cease maneuvers and
prepare to be boarded!  We have you locked, and any change in delta-V will
be met with fire!"

If you want to destroy, don\'t bother with warnings, but just open up.

You have got to be kidding.  Grenades make less noise than a popping
balloon if you throw them far enough.  The noisiest thing I was exposed to
was being in front of a .50 when it opened up over my head.. now that was
loud.

>You don\'t understand what I was saying about the ADJUTANT CALL, do you?

Yes I did.  I also saluted officers even though I didn\'t have a visor on my

*sigh*

Roaches do not speed up any more than any other creature on Earth moves
faster when it runs.  Care to provide any evidence to your theory?  Kafers
do not speed up, they think faster and more clearly when threatened.  I can
not find a single reference in 2300 to Kafers being physically faster when
threatened, only mentally.

Your point was wrong.

What you have done is assume that because a race looks like something
familiar, they will act that way.  Vargr *will* act like wolves, down to
howling, Aslan *will* act like cats, including a fondness for pouncing, and
in a reversal, cockroaches will act like Kafers..  this is wrong.

You don\'t understand the difference in mindsets between a sniper and a line 
trooper.  Sniping is a terror tactic most effectively used when nobody *else* 
is shooting off the guns & banging the bombs.

Who was talking VC?  You sound like one of those idiots who saw one too many 
SEAL movies or who believes that *everything* in that John Wayne flick about 
the Special Forces was 100% dead on target.  It wasn\'t even *close*.

Wanna know what goes on inside somebody\'s head when they\'re in combat?  Simple 
enough to say.  You wanna stay *alive*.  The only things you\'ll pay attention 
to is what\'s happening right in front of you.  What\'s happening someplace else 
is *NOT YOUR PROBLEM*, and if you try to do anything about something that\'s 
*NOT YOUR PROBLEM*, you get a ride back to The World in a body bag.  How do I 
know this?  I\'ve *BEEN* there.  Nothing \'macho\' to it.  Just pure survival.

Now, if hearing artillery hitting on a ridge 3 klicks out scares the hell 
outta you, my advice is to stay the hell outta uniform and let the pros handle 
it.

How many people would like to see an \'official\' licensed play by mail/email
version of Traveller ? One with all the background of the Traveller
universe, but with an intuitive command system for performing actions and
actual roleplaying ? One that would allow thousands of players to play
together at the same time with and against each other ? One that is played

enjoyable for new players as well as Traveller veterans ?

Anyone interested ? Feedback ? Thoughts ?

Oh he _said_ it was \'to deal with bear and moose.\' It was built because
they wanted the baddest pistol that could be carried. If you\'re talking
about the Maadi-Griffin, it was available in carbine form too.

The thing is huge...here\'s a ref:

http://www.prairienet.org/guns/big/mg.htm

and a gif:

http://www.prairienet.org/guns/pixs/lpb.gif

and someone _firing_ it. Fairly average to petite someone, I\'d say, too.

http://www.prairienet.org/guns/pixs/tw.gif

This is nothing, there is one gunsmith making a _20mm_ rifle! Take THAT,
you Star Viking!!!

No, they aren\'t.  Snipers are a precise tool, not something that you waste
on an attack like this on a (as you describe it) defenseless village.  The
best employment of snipers is either covering a known route of
communication, or involved in deep penetration against enemy command assets.

Gee, thanks.  There is a lot more to sniping than being a shooter.  Ever
take eight hours to crawl fifty feet?  Ever have to do it twice?  Snipers
are specialists in both shooting and recon.  The USMC and Army treat
snipers differently, but in both services we are not considered overly
expendable.

The VC/NVA did train snipers.  Since the supplies of SVD rifles, along with
the match-grade ammo, was limited, VC snipers did attend training camps
that pushed the three main elements of successful sniper ops:

1: Infiltration
2: Target Selection and engagement
3: Extraction

In 1969, an American LRRP Mike team overran a VC sniper school.  The lesson
plan on the chalkboard was "The danger of American long-range patrols"
That blackboard is now at the HQ of the 75th Inf (Ranger).

Clif, for you to discuss honesty..  from what I\'ve seen, your discussions
of the military have mention one rotation at a training facility.  You
haven\'t told us what you MOS, rank, or any other duty assignments you might
have carried.  We don\'t even know your full name.  To be blunt, from the
way you write, I believe that you\'ve never served a day of active duty.
I\'ve a friend at DCSPERS, so if you want to email me your Service Number, I
can confirm that you aren\'t BSing us.

You can find Traveller stats, along with a picture of the damn thing at:

http://www.hooked.net/~dberry/pistol.html

Under ACQ, hollopoints do x2 damage, with armor protection doubled.  Assume
that the bear has armor 1.  The gun does 5d6, reduced to 3d6.  Average
damage is 10.5, doubled to 21.  Ouch.

I\'ve heard the same thing. The figures I saw a little while ago put the
biomass of deep rock bacteria at 98% of the earth\'s total biomass.

Where in the hell do you get a match-grade 20mm barrel?  I doubt this
monstrousity will be of much use, since the sheer size of the round brings
down the effectiveness to that of a .50, which is already a cumbersome
enough weapon.

Cool! An escape from AD&D to Traveller? Was there a table to see if a

transported you back to the Spinward Main too?

Or, the hydrogen gas used to inflate the jump bubble (cf FFS2) mixes with
the oxygen/nitrogen atmosphere in the seconds before jump and detonates
before jump insertion is complete, totally destroying both ships.

Or you could use the grav pulse (which must move at the speed of light) and
use it to accelerate and guide a stream of plasma from a plasma gun to use
against enemy vessels? Hey presto, HG plasma and fusion guns become viable
again?

Or is there a major flaw in my thinking?

future looks, etc.

I must say, i feel the opposite. Finally, The future seems optimistic.
Let me explain:
What we have is:
- -T5 in production for a long time now. No haste-products, no hassle, its
done when its done!
So the quality of this product should be amazing.
- -Traveller has been through a hard time with IG on the wheel, but it showed
everybody how not to do things.
- -G:T is out, products of good quality, that help newbies grasp details of
the background that made Traveller so great. G:T should help bring in new
players, or at least buyers.
- -BITS are producing supplement of pretty good quality, maybe not yet up to
DGP standards, but 
a possible successor.

The Brand: Approved for use with Traveller is back!
I just saw it on the usenet, that a book with deckplans for Holistic
Designs Fading Suns has been "Approved for use with Traveller". They are
proud of that brand and to be associated with Traveller. People who see
this will say: Hmm, Traveller, lets check that out as well. It brings the
name back into the gamers mind. 
When i asked who approved it, i was told it was by MM. I must congratulate
you on this move, Marc, as it helps marketing Traveller as well. Its free
Advertisement. 
If MM keeps this up, and regularly "Approves" good quality products, that
can be used with Traveller, this will help people forget all about the
errors of IG.

Concluding, i must say, that to me, Traveller seems to be on the rise
again. When T5 comes out, lets be ready to promote Traveller. Lets make
Traveller a success again, for the greatest resource of Traveller,
regardless of the creed or System, is us, the fans.

The idea is the same, whether you\'re talking about "2-D" planes or "3-D"
space.  Stand off at a distance, fire off a preemptive strike, howl before
it hits, then close in on the meat in a pack while the others run from an
outnumbering force...

You can\'t see that sometimes I\'m using analogies employing ground-based

whether it is taking place in 2D or 3D?

But no one said damage to Vargrs was a prerequisite.  It goes without saying
that the Vargr are going to try to get their meat for free, if they can.  I
simply anticipated objections by making the allowance of a few being picked
off.

Ohhh, now it is to AVERT combat?  Well, a couple of Nukes once "AVERTED"

a plane, it matters not, since it is the boom we are talking about).  Those
who saw the image surrendered.

In a previous post SOMEONE (I can\'t keep track) said something that

That\'s a little difficult when the books are so hard to come by.

Of course not!  They are designed for Kafers!  But if a human picks up one
of these weapons that SOMEONE called "nifty", they could dislocate their
shoulder with the recoil.

Though I do not in any way agree with much of what Clif has suggested...the 
general view now of TNE\'/T4\'s magical "Grav focus lasers"[1] is that they
have a gravity wave travelling with the laser pulse to keep it collimated.
The wave is too weak to be a weapon itself - about a G or two for a 
millisecond - but could produce a "whumm..." and/or slightly shake a ship
in a near-miss. You could imagine firing the grav pulse without the
laser to give people a wake-up call.

Bruce
>>>>
I like this!  This provides the cinematic feel that Real World (tm) lasers don\'t give (shaking the ship when it receives a hit from an energy weapon).  Bruce\'s reading of the material differs from mine (I had the impression that the gravity focusing happened in the weapon itself), but I might be persuaded to make the \'feel\' of space combat more familiar to those who grew up on Star Wars and Star Trek.

Yes, and the effect of those vibrations on auditory organs.

Well, that\'s a question.  Could a quick burst from a laser beam of whatever
power level "punch" a metal surface without punching through it?

You wouldn\'t have to hit the same spot with each burst.

I\'m still asking if you could "punch" or "jar" a solid with a laser without
cutting through it.

I\'m making an educated guess that there are people on this list with a
sufficient scientific background who can answer these questions and provide
relevant information.

P.S.:  Of course, the laser microphone doesn\'t have to heat up a surface to
that degree, if at all.

Nailing down the equipment is kind of tough though, because Greg Porter did
the stuff in the core rules, and he tweaks TLs a little bit. We do have
GCarriers and air/rafts at TL 8 in these rules as well, while bullpup rifles
are listed in T5 as being TL9. Like I said, this is a difficult concept to
draw a bead on because Greg mucks about with the Tech Levels.

I was just going by the raw TL scale (as given on p 134 of the T4 rule
book).

No, but the core rules do. look on page 84.

I noticed the antimatter bug as well, when I started using GURPs vehicles.
Maybe Loren had a change of heart or something? I don\'t know.

Possibly. However, if you use GURPS: Vehicles, the huge jump in efficiency
happens in just the right way for my tastes. Vehicle armors and structures
get extremely light.

Well, hell, the end result is, it works for me :^)

entertaining. I do it for fun. I enjoy the game, and I enjoy speculating on
the future possibilities in the Third Imperium.

You are swiftly sucking some of that enjoyment away for me, personally. From
the posts that I\'ve seen, from others as well.

I treated you with respect, I discussed your point. In short order you ended
up showing me none. You refused to read my posts that you responded to in
any but the briefest, glancing manner. You lowered yourself to personal
insults aimed at me (and others) for no reason whatsoever. You continue to
be quite rude and patronizing to myself and others. In short, you\'re not
only hurting (or annoying) others, you\'re making an ass of yourself.

If you keep this up, you\'re going to find that no one wants to talk to you.
Eventually, you\'re going to piss off everybody on the list, and then you
will be a non-entity. You\'ve already pissed me off, and that\'s difficult to
do. I may be hardheaded at times, but I\'m supremely tolerant of the views of
others. You have strained that tolerance though.

You have managed to do what nobody else has ever managed to do on this list.
You are written off in my book. Even when you try to make good posts you
lose it within one response cycle. You seem to be completely unable to
handle the fact that not everybody sees your genius and not everyone bows
down and worships your ideas.

I won\'t be responding to your posts on the list anymore. In fact, to be
honest I won\'t even read them.

Before you get a martyr complex about this, let me fill you in on a little
secret: You are doing it to yourself. You have insulted a number of people
(including myself) already for merely disagreeing with your posts. In almost
all cases, these people respected you enough to converse with you civilly.
You betrayed that respect and simply had to act like a know-it-all, and post
things merely to piss people off.

I don\'t want to kick you off the list. I don\'t want to see you gone from the
list. On the other hand, I just don\'t want anything to do with you anymore.
In fact, I even stood up on your behalf at one point, telling people how sad
it was that they were sniping you left and right.

My conscience is clear though. I gave you a chance. I tried to discuss
something with you pleasantly and you ruined it. So now I say, goodbye, have
a nice life.

My friend the physicist doesn\'t know anything about "inverse laser

I disagree. Computer games leave very little to the imagination, and give
the players far fewer choices than a role-playing game.

Computer games tend to appeal to kids who spend time watching TV rather

How about this, I adjust the artificial gravity to a microgravity level
around the ship, then its Jump Drive, in theory could work, if you remember
we have removed the variable of gravity from the equation, not the rest of
the variables...

Write to Marc (farfutures@aol.com) nicely and he\'ll probably send you the files. 
I don\'t know for sure, but from what I\'ve seen so far T5 is most certainly an

>Seriously, do you have a copy of the story(s)?


I don\'t have a copy of it, but I can give you the lowdown, basically this
sick bastard worked at his father\'s clothing store. He had a peephole built
into the changing booths and everything.

So one day, he\'s alone at the shop with a girl and her young baby, and he
rapes and kills the mother and he kills the baby. He goes and dumps their
bodies off and then goes to a nightclub later on.

Of course, it was a gothic nightclub, one that I as well frequented during
that same time period.

First, the media in countless stories pointed out how he "thought he was a
vampire." Later on, in the trial, he never mentioned anything like this.
Then the next week, there are news reports about the dangers of gothic music
on your children! They beat that one long after it was dead. So then, one of
the investigators leaks to the press that they found "Dungeons & Dragons"
books and "Vampire: The Masquerade." Man, the news people went _crazy_ over
this one! They vehemently went after this angle for about a week, and then
the whole thing died down.

As it turns out, the guy was just deranged, perverted and lonely, like the
many deranged perverted and lonely people that decide to take someone else\'s
life for no reason each year.

Of course, had he been a star quarterback for his local football team, we
wouldn\'t have heard quite the same line they handed us here in this area.
"Investigators discovered that Caleb Fairley, the accused killer of Lisa and
Devon Manderach was a star quarterback on a football team. Football... where
players dress up in armor, or \'pads\' and attempt to knock each other down to
gain possession of a ball, originally made of the hide of a pig. Some
concerned groups believe football is the cause behind countless suicides
each year."

I digress, I\'m not trying to badmouth football. The whole thing just leaves
a bad taste in my mouth. I was just trying to point out how ludicrous the
kinds of things they said were.

Bruce\'s reading of the material differs from mine (I had the impression that
the gravity focusing happened in the weapon itself), but I might be
persuaded to make the \'feel\' of space combat more familiar to those who grew

Actually, that\'s not true.  The -5/-10/-15 modifiers are for _any_
engineering/mechanics roll related to the item, and are cumulative with any
other penalties.  As reverse-engineering an item at your _own_ tech level is
frequently not a zero penalty, this gets pretty prohibitive for higher tech
items.  The base penalties probably mostly apply to trying to use the item, not
to understanding it.

Yes, but don\'t forget that all you need to do is buy (or pirate) a game and
you\'re ready to go. You don\'t need anyone else, and you don\'t need to pay
"maintenance costs" to keep a campaign going. A GM has to put time into a
game. Good GMs are hard to find (I\'ve played tabletop RPGs that have less
options than crude computer games), and a lot of younger kids don\'t have a
place to "hang out" and play a tabletop RPG. Hell, when I was very young, we
had to play D&D on the front steps of our houses (two slabs of marble, four
feet or so wide)!

>Computer games tend to appeal to kids who spend time watching TV rather
>than reading books.


Not always, but the immediacy is compelling. Just boot up the computer,
bring up the start menu and *whoosh*, the player\'s off defending his base
from the Zergs, or blasting the menacing, cybernetic Stroggs with his trusty
combat shotgun. Nowadays, with the ready availability of the internet there
are literally tens of thousands of opponents (or in some cases, allies) just
a mouse click away.

In some out of the way areas, it\'s the only way to play _any_ sort of game
with other people.

Keep in mind, as well, that prowess plays a major factor as well. With the
exception of universally denounced cheaters, it takes at least a modicum of
skill to play. The GM doesn\'t fudge the game for a good story. With all the
mechanics in the hands of a machine, there\'s no room for error. There are
plenty of kids who pride themselves at being good at these games. In some
cases, they see other kids, just a few years older, making _money_ on the
professional gaming circuit!

Roleplaying games have given me experiences that computer games can\'t, while
computer games have given me experiences that roleplaying games can\'t. With
LAN-parties so prevalent these days, dedicated computer game fans can even
joke and parlay with their friends _in person_ while competing against each
other.

I\'m very active in both circles, so I thought it might be fair to give a
somewhat balanced viewpoint. I have a map on Activision\'s upcoming
"Extremities" addon pack for Quake2, and I\'ve written a couple of tutorials
on mapmaking and customizing controls (key binding) and met some fine people
doing it. The funny thing is that there are plenty of parallels between the
computer game market and the roleplaying market.

The end result is still the same, however. Computer games have taken a huge
chunk out of the potential RPG market. It\'s only going to get worse, too.
Especially if "Baldur\'s Gate" is any indication.

I would like to say as a Recon Specialist (MOS 0311) that the use of a
sniper as a line trooper is a waste of years & years of training...  Being
a sniper is more that shooting people in the head from 500 yards away... 
It is an art & a science..  Snipers have to be able to hit the target each
& every time they are called upon to hit it...  Also, I have to say this, I
would not want a sniper next to me when the enemy rush my foxhole...  They,
tend to take their time to make a good shot...

Amen brother, with me you are preaching to the choir...  I have been in
combat...  I have been shot at by people who did not know my name or even
care who I was...  I have done the same...  War is not pretty, to
paraphrase a Great, Great, Great Man...  "War is hell, War is not
honorable, War is not pretty, there is no glory in War - only death...  War
is the ultimate gutter fight...  War is sitting in mud for days on end
while you wait for an enemy you have never seen attack you from the
shadows...  War is eating shit on a shingle...  War is blood, pain, tears,
& death...  My brother, I do not like War, but sometimes, just sometimes,
War is better than peace, where peace is giving away that which you so
dearly love..."

Hell, to me it is music to my ears...  The sound of Mr Art Illery landing 3

No, it wasn\'t.  You were asserting the "howl-then-attack" model as a
military strategy, used during open combat with more or less equivalent
adversaries.  What you describe above is not so much a combat scenario as
a "psy op," an intimidation exercise.  You don\'t want to kill many of the
villagers; you want to terrify them, perhaps kill one or two as examples,
then leave.  Now they\'ll be far less effective to the enemy, knowing that
it could happen again any time, and not wanting to bring it down upon
themselves again.

Beating your chest and howling works really well as an intimidation
strategy.  It makes no sense when your objective is to kill quickly,
efficiently, and without quarter.  As Douglas noted, wolves hunt silently.
So do humans, for that matter.  And recall the classic scene from _2001_
when Moon Watcher\'s band arrived at the creek not to posture, but to kill.
The eeriest aspect of the scene was that MW\'s band remained entirely
silent while the opponents screamed and waved their arms.  (Yes, I know
it\'s a movie, but it captures perfectly what we\'re discussing, and I find
it utterly realistic.)

The one case where such posturing makes sense is when you are utterly
cerain of victory, but hope to goad your opponents into surrender or
withdrawal in order to avoid casualties to your own or the other side.  An
excellent if uncomfortable example is Waco, where the sound/light assault
was maintained for many weeks in order to wear down resistance and
resolve.  The ATF obviously could have stormed the compound on day 1, but,
having absolute tactical control, they opted to try for a surrender.

Might work, actually.  But I\'d guess any range you could rattle the ship
enough to make a "howl" rather than a "what\'s that tinny whining sound?"
at, you could actually damage the ship with the same laser.

> Intelligent races USE psychological warfare!

This is the key question:  When does the value gained by intimidation
become less than the value lost through throwing away surprise?  Douglas
and I agree that, in almost all modern combat, surprise is infinitely more
valuable than intimidation.  In pre-gunpowder combat, a battle involved
convincing a great many men to stand fast or advance despite having many,
many other men with sharp objects approaching them.  Here, morale was a
primary concern, and had to be maintained over long minutes in a single
engagement, and many hours during a battle.  Conversely, the tempo of
modern combat is such that any target in view can be engaged, more or
less, and engagements tend to end one way or another in one or two
minutes.  Hence the stress on quick, reflex-level reactions to combat
situations; there\'s no time for deliberation.  In this sort of battle,
getting the first shot in can win the engagement, period.  That\'s why
surprise is so much more important.  After all, a Roman legion *never* had
tactical surprise.  That\'s why they developed the whole shield-banging
thing; if you can\'t have surprise, might as well intimidate.

At first.  Rommel realized that Patton could predict him, and changed his
strategy and tactics.  The Vargr would presumably do the same.

Mine (the duplicate) is laminated. It\'s around A2 size and goes very well
with the A2 Spinward Marches from the same time.  (For US viewers, GURPS
Traveller is approx A4, A3 is double that, A2 is double A3, LWB are A5).

My copy came  with the Megatraveller advertising poster (WBH one), Spinward

Marc has a website he recently launched with SFRPGs on it to buy. I think
he posted the URL here?

Either would do - I have CW5 and AI7 so can read them no problem. Would

Bruce Johnson sent me a PICT, but it misaligns slightly in both. If you can

If it calls itself ClarisWorks Office or Appleworks it\'s 5. Usually says on

I\'ve got a PICT and Zane has offered to try and convert them - will let you

The problem with doing the grav focusing in the weapon is that the only way to
get the ranges specified is to use gravity to make a really big lens - tens
of meters across. That means the (smaller) beam must exit the physical laser
aperture in a diverging cone, get "caught" by the grav lens and bent into
a collimated or slowly converging beam. The problem with *that* is that it
requires gravitational fields in the millions of G\'s. If, on the other hand,
the grav focus is a pulse travelling along with the laser pulse, it only
has to be continuously bending it very gently,s o you can get by with
fields of a G or so - within known Traveller capabilities. Plus it allows
for cool sound effects.

Good, I am glad you understand this...  If you build a laser able to create
a sound of a howling dog in a target ship, so that everyone can hear you
aboard that ship...  Would it not mean that the entire ship is vibrating? 
If you could build a laser like that, why not destroy the ship?  Lets see a
laser large & powerful enough to do that should be able to also destroy the
ship in question...

Now, I can see a Vargr ship sending out a radio signal with a howl in it,
as part of its IFF...  Letting people know that it is a Vargr ship, but I
cannot see an Inverse Laser Microphone...

    'body' => 'My Friends and Acquaintances on the TML,

In addition to attempting to develop and maintain an active Traveller 
existence, I sometimes participate other games.  Some of them are 
live-action, and two of them have international support.  While I 
won\'t mention any names, one of them has an extensive array of 
mailing lists that supports its varied genres.

On these lists, just like the TML, the participants occasionally have 
conflicts.  They used to have a lot more, as people reacted before 
cooling down from misunderstandings.  Thus, they\'ve enforced an email 
policy that I think would serve us in good stead here.

The 24 Hour Policy:

If you read an email that upsets you, to the point where you feel the 
need to respond in an aggressive, assertive or otherwise 
confrontational fashion, wait!  Wait for 24 hours, re-read the post, 
postulate your response, and answer in a calm, civilized fashion.

In retrospect, we often discover that the original intent of the 
message was not how we took it.  Even if it is, why give someone the 
satisfaction of knowing that they\'ve upset us.  Hey, discuss it 
privately with a friend or other supportive person, but take the 24 
hours wait before responding to that person.  It works.

Even if you feel the person you\'re conversing with is neither calm 
nor civilized, wait 24 hours before responding.

Even if you (or the other person) have grown up using emotional 
attacks to undermine another\'s argument when logic just doesn\'t work, 
(you know, the old bait-and-switch between logic and emotion to 
break another person\'s argument), wait 24 hours before responding.

Even if the person has insulted your family, your lineage, your 
country, your religious beliefs, your race, your gender, your sexual 
orientation, your favorite conspiracy theories, whatever, wait 24 
hours before responding.

And if you can\'t wait 24 hours before responding, then that is 
especially when you _need_ to wait 24 hours before responding.

And if that doesn\'t work, send it via personal email and take it off 
the list.  And even then, it\'s still better to wait 24 hours before 
responding.

It\'s a very valid email etiquette rule that will make our list much 
more pleasant to subscribe to.  In these days where we are trying to 
attract more people to the game, be aware that our actions can also 
chase them away.  Even if "the other guy" is "rocking the boat," none 
of us have to support it by replying in kind.  And if we can wait 24 
hours, at least the response will be more well thought out and 
appropriate to the situation at hand.

So please, please consider your actions and wait 24 hours before 
responding to emails that upset you or make you feel attacked.  
Usually, you\'ll find that the person didn\'t mean it the way it 
sounds, or that the person is deliberately trying to provoke a fight 
to lead you into making yourself look like a fool.  Do you want to 
prove him right or wrong?  Then wait 24 hours.

I know I\'ve over-emphasized it, but normally calm people on the list 
have been agitated lately, and that\'s not cool.  I don\'t want to 
unsubscribe, but I bet you a number of our lurkers already have.  Who 
knows what talent we may have already lost?

If you have any comments, constructive or destructive, I welcome 
them.  I would prefer they be sent to me via private mail, so as not 
to waste bandwidth.

Thank you for your time.  I apologize if anyone feels that I have 
wasted their time, and return you to your normal Traveller threads, 
already in progress....

ObTrav:  It\'s a suggestion for TML list etiquette.  Thanks.

In Service,
Jason

Just thought I\'d point out an interesting article in a recent "Nature" 
(10 Dec, vol. 396, issue 6711, pg. 513).  It regards models of solar
system formation based on the (admittedly meager) data available on
extra-solar planets.  The most interesting finding, IMO, is that placement
of planets of varying sizes seems to be highly random and chaotic, with
the only constraint being that planets be "not too close" to one-another. 
It certainly implies that the Titius-Bode relation is just a coincidence. 
Mind you, even the authors admit that there are too many unknowns in the
physics of the matter for this to be considered more than a first step in
understanding such things.

Another thing I found interesting was their noting that gas-giant cores,
before they acquire their huge atmospheres, would have masses in the 5 to
20 earths range.  Does this imply that young systems might have giant
rockball worlds with 5 to 20 gs of surface gravity?  What would such a
world be like?  Could life evolve there if for some reason no large
crushing atmosphere was developed?  What would it be like?  Would it have
a hope in hell of developing space travel?

I guess that most people would, but I\'m looking for rough numbers as well as

before moving to the next stage.

Not necessarily. I got several people off my back when I was facing all 
of that pressure by switching to another "less mystical" game, one that 
didn\'t even use all the magical stuff:Traveller.
When those who wanted to criticize the group looked at the rules, they 
saw spaceships, not demons. I never heard any more complaints.

<BLATANT PLUG>
We\'ve got a wide range of products in development that aim to remedy this
and actually put the Role Play back into RPG Games. This is all based around
a roleplaying engine that generates storytelling prose as narrative and
dialogue interaction between characters using our proprietary EDGE system.
The game is even better than some GMs I know and have played with over the
years. It\'s taken two years to get into production but bridges PBM and RPG
games, taking storytelling and multi-player interaction to a new level.

On a related note:

In GDW\'s Twilight: 2000 (version 2.2), the requirements to be a Marine
sniper are more exclusive (Strength+Agility+Constitution of 19+) than
those for Marine Force Recon (Strength+Agility+Constitution of 17+), US
Army Rangers (Strength+Agility+Constitution of 17+), or US Army Special
Forces (Strength+Agility+Constitution of 18+).

Didn\'t work for me. As I said, I only lost a single player to the hysteria
in my youth, and we played Gamma World.

As for high school, we weren\'t allowed to have _any_ sort of wargaming or
roleplaying club. No Battletech, no Avalon Hill Games, not even Axis &
Allies. When I took it up with the principal, he stated that wargames and
roleplaying games were directly linked to teenage suicide.

Finally, at work, it was the very fact that I was a roleplayer that was
negative, not what roleplaying game I played. In this case, I didn\'t put up
with it, and even had a couple of sessions with a girl from my workplace and
a couple of her friends...

I can only judge as far as I\'ve experienced I guess :^)

  I\'d rather say we\'re in transition between Traveller TL8 and TL9. At
least our current computer technology seems to be way beyond what any
Traveller edition has given for TL8. Medical and genetic tech seems to be
racing ahead also. (Then again this might all just be the impetuousness of
us Solomani compared to the cautious Vilani mindset, that seems to
dominate the Imperium.)

Nah.  Just blow them up. ;)

honourable way for Traveller players to sort out their differences is
called Trillion Credit Squadron.

Clif, old man, perhaps you should reconsider the wisdom of discussing
holes, heads, and the possible juxtaposition thereof.  Some TMLers might
misunderstand....

ObTrav:  Regardless of how annoying some may find some of Clif\'s posts,
at his very _worst_ he is not nearly as bad, IMHO, as the twit from TNS
who keeps pestering Professor Kuligaan in "Survival Margin."  At his
best, he does contribute useful material to TML.

    'topic' => 'Ihatei Motivations',
    'body' => 'Hello all.

Somebody (I forget who, the digests just keep pouring in!), mentioned that
it would be unlikely for the Ihatei off the Marches to have huge fleets
due to the distance from the Hierate.  I mostly agree, and the Ihatei IMTU
are rarely equipped with more than a few destroyer-sized vessels and are
thus limited to taking over small low-tech worlds with no effective
defences. Now that such worlds are running out, they are pushing into
Imperial or soon-to-be Imperial worlds such as those in District 268. 
What I\'d like to do now is start a discussion on the motivations that have
caused the Ihatei to cover such a large expanse is such a small time in
the first place.  After all, we are talking about two or three sectors to
cover in, what, 10 years?

In the TNE universe the motivation was the perceived weakness of the
Imperium. The second sons saw all the rich developed worlds of the Marches
as rich and easy prizes to gain due to all the problems the Imperials had
to face.  But in the G:T timeline this is not the case, so why did they
rush over like that? 

One factor to consider is Aslan birthrates.  If each established Aslan
leader has only 1 to 2 sons, then the Ihatei "population pressure" is less
than if they have huge broods containing 5 or 6 sons (remembering that
Aslan male:female ratio is 1:3, this means upwards of 20 children).

Another factor to consider is how well-equipped the Ihatei are and
therefore what sorts of worlds they can hope to conquer.  If each second
son is given an 800-ton mercenary cruiser and told to "go find his
fortune", then he\'s going to have to join forces with others just to take
over a TL3 world and hold it for any length of time.  On the other hand,
I\'ve heard that Ihatei fleets are supposed to contain big 50Kt cruisers
and the like.  (This strikes me as a lot of resources to be thrown into
such risky ventures, but then these are aliens we\'re talking about.)  If
this is the case, then a single Ihatei fleet could take over some
relatively significant worlds on their own. 

I prefer the "under-equipped" Ihatei idea myself, for a couple of reasons. 
First, it just seems more plausible to me that an outcast second son would
get a few destroyers (in the 1 to 10 Kt range) to make his way with than
an entire task force complete with dreadnoughts and escorts.  Second, it
provides a motivation for rapid expansion.  If all you can take are small
defenceless worlds, then you quickly run out of these and start searching
further and further for "easy pickings".  Of course, this doesn\'t explain
why they haven\'t done more expanding spinward from the Hierate instead of
coreward...

One thing I wanted to take issue with was the assertion that "a typical
Jump-3 Ihatei fleet" would take a year to cross the Great Rift.  Wouldn\'t
the fleet have to be Jump-5 to get across at all?  Or are you talking
about setting up deep-space refuelling stations and the like?  Also, on
the "big map of the universe", there\'s a chuck of Aslan space already on
the other side of the rift.  Doesn\'t this imply that some Aslan clans are
already well-established on that side?  Couldn\'t much of the Ihatei start
from there?  Or, failing that, couldn\'t they come across the rift and buy
equipment (read: war ships) from the Aslan on that side (at massively
inflated prices of course)? 

Just some thoughts...

To be fair, I can see a physical basis for laser-induced sound-frequency
hull vibration.  Just amplitude-modulate a beam powerful enough at high
amplitude to vaporize a thin surface layer of the hull.  These shocks,
AM\'d to carry the desired signal, would result in sound-frequency
vibrations in the hull, and hence sound.

The question is whether a sound loud enough to qualify as an intimidating
howl could be produced without damaging the hull (i.e., being a weapon
rather than an intimidation tool).  My guess is that it couldn\'t.

Actually, the rules state that to repair an item of two tech levels

chance of breaking it permanetly.  I guess because your flub 
chance increases as your skill goes down ...

What kind of penalty would you apply to reverse-engineering

I remember that herbivores had to evolve continuously-growing teeth, and
that there was a big shake-up. Grasses also created prairies and steppes,
where previously there was scrub.

Thanks to those who posted regarding my question a while back about
genetically engineering intestinal flora/fauna for digesting alien
nutrients.  The discussion was quite enlightening even if it got quite
technical at points.  

I was wondering, would you all consider it fair to say the consensus is
that it would be easier to have some sort of "food processor" that took in
alien food and output edible product?  Or would even this be difficult to
devise?  If it\'s plausible, what would you do for emergency situations? 
Could you have a small pack of enzymes to pour onto food ("1. Open packet
and put into bowl.  2. Add local stuff.  3.  Mash and stir thoroughly" :-) 
that would do the trick?  Or would the diversity of alien biologies defeat
this sort of strategy?

To me, one of things is _not_ to look at dogs for "cute" things
to attribute to the Vargr.  Instead, look at what the sentient
Vargr are described as.  They are carnivores so having them
eat meat makes sense.  They are not dogs so having them
drink out of bowls is silly.  They are a described as not
tending to hide their feelings and the similarities means
that humans are able to pick up on this.  However, they
aren\'t any more likely to howl in battle than a human is
to hoot and throw leaves...

One thing I would do is make them the aliens that are "sort"
of like humans.  To a human the problem with a Hiver is that
talking to it is like talking to a wall.  Since you can only
ever get the meaning of the worlds, understanding is harder.
However, with a Vargr you can get a much deeper understanding
of what they are trying to say, most of the time.  Most of the
time, sometimes those species differences will turn around and
get you.  Relations with Hiver will be cool, slow, and careful.
Relations with Vargr will develop much faster and more fruitfully,
but will be caracterized by occaison blowups.

Well, one should also tend to avoid say "Vargr are".  A lot of
what I see described for all Vargr are things that you can
find humans doing.  The fact is that Vargr are going to be just
as diverse as humans are.  The wording should reflect that.
Vargr tend to do things in groups.  They aren\'t "pack animals".
Similarly, you wouldn\'t say that a Vargr always does things
for Charisma, instead you should say that not being appreciated
for his/her accomplishments weighs more heavily on a Vargr than
it does for a human.

>the support gunners all being the personal

>But then stupidity is not an exclusively human trait).

They might if the leader has made a real mess of things.  It
is quite known for humans group to loose all confidence in
a leader who has clearly screwed things up and dump him
on the assumption that they will surely loose if they don\'t.
The main difference is that the human habit of following
incompetant leaders into disaster is much less common among
the Vargr.  Otherwise, I agree (this is, after all, an
extreme case and might not even occur in a Vargr society
that is much more merit based).  Normally, the main effect
is that Vargr will tend to switch leaders between battles,
not in the middle.

>We know from canon that Vargr favour the raid.

I dont\' think this is directly caused by Vargr society.  The reason
they prefer raids isn\'t because they are like wolves that a snatching
food.  They favor raids because the states they from tend to be
small and unable to conquer and hold land.

As I think you are saying, I don\'t think that they would "instinctively"
do this.  However, a Vargr might read a story by a human about
how the howls in the dark unerved him and say "hmmm, if they are
afraid of such things, lets us it".  (Though if I were them
I would record some holws and play them from places were we
weren\'t so that any attacks against the sound will be wasted).

>There\'s a tendency (especially, I seem to recall among teenage gamers) to

Yeah.  This is also why I caution against things people want
to introduce.  Thing that sound cool often also, upon extended
examination, cause background problems.

Reminds me of the movie, "The Big Bus", in which the driver of an
experimental nuclear-powered bus had scandal in his past:  he was the
driver of a bus that was stranded in the mountains for some time; when
rescuers had arrived, he was the only survivor----and he had gained
weight.  (He claimed that he ate the seat cushions....)

And then you\'re ignoring what these experts say.  People like the two
Bruces put a great deal of thought into figuring out the implications of
_fictional_ technology, making everything as consistent as possible.  They
freely make their professional knowledge available and answer questions,
often dumb ones, because they like the game and enjoy helping people
understand science.

Even if you turn off the artificial gravity, you still have the natural gravity of ship B (that ship A is launching from).  I suppose if ship B had a big enough (evacuated) cargo hold that ship A could use it\'s thrusters to hover in the middle of it, and still be "100 diameters" from anyplace on ship B, we could handwave away any further influence ship B would have on ship A\'s attempt (though that would have to be a mighty big cargo hold to be 100 diameters away even for a 100 dton Type S scout, unless you want to add in the possibility of Jump Torpedos).  We still have the problem of forming a Jump bubble inside another Jump bubble, but I will skip that for the moment, hoping to see some more interesting thoughts along those lines.

They\'d actually be iceball worlds (part of why they get so huge being
that ice is much more common in the outer solar system than rock is in
the inner.) It\'s perfectly plasuible that one could fail to acquire an
atmosphere, due to clearing out of the gas from the protoplanetary disk
and/or transfer of the iceball to a wide orbit with little gas. Surface
gravity wouldn\'t be all that terrible (gravity only 
goes as mass^1/3 and density^2/3, so gravities would only be 0.8 G to
1.4 G unless I\'m messing up the math). Of course, such a planet couldn\'t
be in the habitable zone since it would melt...

Another thing that peole on this list might do is not seek
to be able to "declare victory".  There is a tendency to
demand that someone either defend a postion in post after post
or admit that they were a "duplicitous fool who never really
believed what he was posting and was mostly lying anyway".

If someone says that they don\'t agee with your position but
that they don\'t want to get into it, respect that.  They
are, after all, giving you the last word and if your arguements
are as convincing as you belive them to be, that should be
enough.  Don\'t respond with demands that the person defend
why anyone might disagree with you (which only forces the
thread to drag on that much longer).

If this were in \'My Traveller Universe (TM)\',

I would say that by using artificial gravity, i.e Grav plates, all you\'re doing
is creating an equal and opposite gravity field. Not the same thing as having
NO gravity field at all, you have two! So it would not work..

IMTU, you can have it work in yours!

Well, first of all, that was before the sun fired up.  (That is
the difference with the gas giants, they managed to get big
enough to hold on to their gas when the sun ignited)  It also
was a period while the plants were accretting (and so probably
had a molten surface).

Hm..how exactly is it a theoretical problem for a planet to be liquid?  It
isn\'t like mechanical factors are a big deal in holding it together. 
Fortunately, escape energy goes up as mass ^ 2/3 and density ^ 1/3, so a
goodsized iceball should be able to hold on to its lighter elements fairly
well.

Ah, but you specified (rather forcibly) that this was a LASER.  Lasers are
real world artifacts that have very well-known properties.  You shine a
laser on something, and it will heat up.  The more powerful the laser, the
more powerful the heating.  You propose a laser capable of turning hull
metal into a speaker.. care to figure out how much energy that would take,
and what percentage of the energy would be transferred as heat to the
target?  Hint: you\'re much more likely to bore a hole straight through the
INV Coronation than deliver a message.

This takes the cake.  The first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on
August 6th.  Japan keeps fighting.  The second bomb takes out Nagasaki on
August 9th, and when the government attempts to surrender, the military
attempted a coup that was stopped only by the personal intervention of the
Emperor.  Japan finally agreed to surrender on August 14th, after realizing
that the Allies were still preparing for Olympic, the invasion of the
Japanese home islands, and all the destruction that would cause.

American units were still on the recieving ends of organized attacks well
through November of 1945.  This does not include single holdouts like Hiroo
Onoda, but large or technologically advanced units.

Nope, pretty Vargr like.

At Ft. Benning (that\'s an Army base, Clif) we had to hunt down the dog
packs that formed when people dumped their pets in on base.  Ever seen a
feral poodle?  This detail was handed to snipers because we needed the real
practise.  

Yes, they do howl.  Mostly at evening, and mostly to locate of packs.  We
heard \'em to, to now where to set up.  When the hunt they are *silent*  I
saw a group of dogs bring down a deer once, most violent act I\'ve ever
seen, and not a bark or growl during the chase and kill.  When we opened
up, then they started barking in warning.  The state Game Warden with us
explained that since dogs pant to lose heat, they *can\'t* make noise when
hunting.

You should learn more about canis canaiede, might I suggest "Cujo" or
"Lassie Come Home"?  Given you penchant for learning through popular media
I figured you\'d enjoy these.

I speak, hopefully, with a bit of an insight into the workings
of the modern day British Army, having served until 2 years 
ago \'for Queen & Country\' (or something like that!). I haven\'t 
heard about, or seen, bagpipes being played in battle. 
Fair play, the pipes were taken along to the South Atlantic,
and I have heard they were taken to the Gulf, but not really 
to be used in the attack to demoralise the enemy, just to 
bolster morale before and after, and provide a bit of entertainment
afterwards, and on the way home....As well as routine duties like
waking up the SSM / CSM !!!

I seem to remember, Clif, that certain highland regiments wore
the kilt during WW2, and this demoralised the German forces,
who thought they \'were fighting women\'*, but I\'m pretty certain
that nowadays we all wear dpm combat fatigues. (Unless we have
a currently serving, or ex scottish regiment member to correct
me. Or anyone else who has done more than watch a movie
based 50 years in the past for his evidence of the actions of
Todays Army)

Ok, instead of slowing in down with the gravitic field, how about changing
direction? Effectively increase the armor slope by having the gravitic field
shift the direction up or down so that the shell doesn\'t get a solid hit.

Feasible?

Not really, though it depends on the length of the field.  In order for 8G to
make a projectile miss by a useful amount (say, 1.5 meters) you need to keep it
in effect for 0.2 seconds, which means the field has to be present at several
hundred meters from the tank.  Also, traveller gravetics doesn\'t seem to work
sideways.

   This is one reason I was somewhat reluctant to post a great
deal on biomes (or types of plant cover) in the first place.
Terrestrial biomes are a bit too heavily dependent on terrestrial
plant species. Information on what kinds of plants grasses
displaced in the climate zones were grasses are common is a bit
hard to come by unless you already know where and how to look for
it. 
   I\'m tired of trying to find stuff that is buried in eight
different scientific journals over fifteen years and written in
such technical terminology that you need at least a BS in the specialty
just to read it.

I thought of that.  At the low end of the scale, it doesn\'t seem
to matter a great deal if the average temperature is -20 C or -
40: Below freezing is still ice.  I\'m not about to try ballroom
dancing with an organism that is comfortable at the temperature
of dry ice.  I could see extending the higher end of the
spectrum,
25-35 Tropical, 
35-45 Supertropical, 
45+ Extreme.

    Extreme deserts could be expected to have summer daytime
temperatures occasionally pass the boiling point in place.
The boling point sets an approximate upper limit just as much as
the freezing point sets an approximate lower limit for
terrestrial-type life.
    It should be possible to go even higher in temperature zones
before running against boiling point limits, but since 1) The
(evaporative) human body cooling system starts to break down in
the supertropical range, and 2) my imagination breaks down when I
go too far beyond terrestrial experience, this is as far as I
want to push it.

If we go up in temperature, I could also see adding
400-500    :  very wet
500 or more:  drenched

to the precipitation table.

   Elfin woodland, Temperate rainforest, and tropical rainforest
are all environments which are about as wet as the temperature
allows. Warmer temperatures allow more water in saturated air,
and so increasing amounts of precipitation. However,
precipitation has a moderating effect on rainfall.

For worlds with supertropical temperature zones, add their
combinations with arid through very wet climates.
  For worlds with extreme temperature zones, add combinations of
extreme with arid through humid, and a supertropical drenched.
   An associated biome might be called supertropical rainforest,
and I would expect it to be taller with even stronger zones than
a tropical rainforest. (Lighted canopy where rain resembles a hot
shower; a dark, cooler middle zone, continually dripping or
raining, perhaps even cloudy; wetsoil floor).

As a handwave from the chart I consulted, I\'d say:
   If the maximum average temperature is in the supertropical
range, add the combinations:
Supertropical/arid through very wet.
   If the maximum average temperature is in the extreme range,
add extreme/arid through extreme/humid and supertropical/drenched
(500 cm/yr or more)

  Another effect to be considered is that atmospheric pressure
affects the boiling point range and the humidity. A world with a
thin atmosphere will find that water boils somewhere around 80 C
and the humidity is lower for a given temperature. A world with a
dense atmosphere will find the opposite effect. 

  I noticed that the "bog" biome appeared twice: as #6 and again
as #19.  Drop the #6 and move everything below it up.

Good point.  But the mass of the launching ship would still affect the

Working from my long distant memories of the BAOR, the highland regiments 
(IIRC the lowland Scot regiments don\'t use pipes, though the Irish regiments 
do) did wear kilts in both world wars and Korea (kahki coloured :*>). Pipers 
appeared in battle during the 1st WW, they definitely appeared at El Alamain, 
they may have been used in Korea (though I\'m much less certain on this); but 
the highlanders definitely no longer use pipes in battle (especially since pipers 
are also medics and have rather more pressing duties in combat).

Why aren\'t they going further spinward instead? Lots of small single worlds
there.

Not quite. The first _ihatei_ reached the Marches around the end of the 6th
century. These would have been isolated groups, because today, 5 centuries
later, the Aslans are still only really established in the rimward half of
Trojan Reach. Since they are known to have been there at least 4 centuries
ago (the Glorious Empire was founded about then), this pose quite a puzzler.
My own explanation is that shortly after the Civil War, the Imperium
instituted a policy of discouraging the Aslans from encroaching any further
corewards than they were at the time  --  that is, about halfway up Trojan
Reach. This would explain the roughly 10-parsec band of neutral worlds
(which I call The Buffer Zone) between the Aslan and the Imperial worlds.

BTW. I also think that when Five Sisters and District 268 was created
District 267 and 268 in 610, Pax Rulin, Gazulin, Tobia, and Usher/Reft was
declared Districts 269, 270, 271, and 272 at the same time.

I\'ve tried to persuade Loren that they wouldn\'t and to cut down on the use
of Aslan _Ihatei_ in GT publications. I\'m anxiously awaiting the publication
of GURPS:Mercs to see if I had any luck.

Spaceships are expensive and it takes a large population base to send off
even a few people. If you try to work out something based on _Trillion
Credit Squadrons_ and allow the Aslans to spend a full 1% of GWP on
outfitting _ihatei_ (remember, 1% is what some people think is too much
for the full military budget of the Imperium), then they can export
between 1 and 2% of each generation.
 
>If each second son is given an 800-ton mercenary cruiser and told to "go

If each second son got an 800T cruiser the clan would be bankrupt.

_Ihatei_ are equipped with obsolescent ships. The big clans do have big
ships in their fleets. It seems that when such a ship becomes so old that
the Imperials would shunt it into their reserves, the Aslans instead turn
them over to their _ihatei_. Note, btw. that thais means that the functions
covered by the reserves in the Imperium would have to be covered by the main
clan forces, reducing the relative effectiveness per credit of clan forces.

>If this is the case, then a single Ihatei fleet could take over some
>relatively significant worlds on their own. 

The significant word is \'relatively\'. I\'m not saying they wouldn\'t be able
to sneak in on some small backwater worlds if the Imperial Fleet was
distracted, but no world with significant system defenses of its own.

>One thing I wanted to take issue with was the assertion that "a typical

Yes I am. The figure came from a canonical statement. I haven\'t checked
the logisitcs myself. There\'s another possibility: The clans that control
the Great Rift Crossing have large jump tugs and can be paid to carry ships
across the jump-5 links. But that costs money, of course.

>Also, on the "big map of the universe", there\'s a chuck of Aslan space
>already on the other side of the rift.  Doesn\'t this imply that some Aslan
>clans are already well-established on that side?

Certainly it does. But check out just how much that space covers. About 13
subsectors worth all in all. And that is split up between hundreds of clans,
which means that each individual clan controls only a small fraction of
the total strength. The Domain of Deneb covers about 34 subsectors and is
able to coordinate their efforts.

Now think about those 13 subsectors a little. The Asalns first crossed the
Great Rift in -1044. That\'s more than two millenia ago. During those 21
centuries the number of _ihatei_ that crossed the rift PLUS the natural
population expansion of the early establishements has sufficed to cover
13 subsectors. Now, suddenly, they are supposed to cover another 8 in 3
years. Am I the only one who think there\'s something wrong with that
picture?

>Couldn\'t much of the Ihatei start from there?

That\'s what I assume. But how many can that amount to if it has taken 21
centuries to fill out what they already have? Even if we assume a few
decades accumulated buildup.

>Or, failing that, couldn\'t they come across the rift and buy equipment
>(read: war ships) from the Aslan on that side (at massively
>inflated prices of course)? 

Buy with what? Money isn\'t wealth unless you can convert it into goods, and
the transportation of goods across the Great Rift is subject to the same
problems that plague the transportation of _ihatei_.

Now please explain to me (First Degree Electrical & Electronic Engineering,
second Physics) how this inverse laser device of yours works in a hard-SF
universe.

J-drive and artificial gravity are handwaves accepted for the sake of a good
game setting. They are accompanied by plausible pseudo-science. Your howlgun
violates a law of physics which says that to make a large object vibrate
enough to get any useful amount of sound, you need to supply a great deal of
energy. Now, as we know, sound waves caused by the transfer of kinetic
energy (vibrations) from the solid to the surrounding medium causing several
pressure wavefronts (these caused by vibrating air molecules which do not
themselves move) to move outwards (we call these successions of compression
and rarefaction in the air "sound waves"). Problem is; a laser is a highly
focussed "beam" of coherent light (yes, it has to be, else it\'s not a laser
but a flashlight). That means that all the energy you\'re supplying arrives
at one point, melting the target (or else not applying sufficient energy to
do anything useful). Now that means you CAN produce a sound with eough
energy (a sort of "Whoom!" of displaced superheated air as the target
undergoes rapid expansion and a change of state from solid to liquid and
perhaps on to gas. It then burns for a while, making a nice crackling sound
perhaps.

Can you please tell this ignorant physicist how your magic device works...
and have you filed for patent yet?

Point is: if you can hit the target with a laser this powerful, why not just
kill it?

Worse. Consider a Zhodani Protector. Increased psi would see a logical
effect, since the virus increases intelligence.

Solomani protectors are going to be a lot like Brennan and Teela.
Vilani protectors, on the other hand, are going to be a lot like Pak!

Hmmm. *That\'s* why Grandfather is hiding. He discovered not only that
humans weren\'t native to Terra, but that they were descended from Pak. 

I\'d hide too!

Fusion rockets weren\'t the most efficient drives the humans had. Check
out "The Warriors", the story of first contact between humans and
Kzinti. The humans had a ship that had reaction drive that gave it an
acceleration somewhere between 1/100th and 1/10th g. Not even worth
paying attention to, right?

Only thing is, it was a *photon* drive. In other words, a laser. And a
laser *that* powerful can be used for carving up asteroids, much less
Kzin warships.

Slight problem. You are confusing "lack of free will" with stupidity.
They "lack free will" because they are so much smarter than we are that
there\'s usually only one solution for a given problem given a specific
set of tools and to *them* it is obvious.

That means that they are smart enough to *know* when the best tactic is
something that mere humans can figure out. 

Fighting something *that* much smarter than you is not easy. The only
way to win is to *continually* be able to make use of informatiuon
unknown to the protectors.

Also, against a foe the size of the third Imperium, you can be sure
that the first thing they\'ll do is grab some isolated ships both for
info, and to learn the technology. And there goes your tech advantage.

Yes. Jump space destroys normal matter. That\'s why ships carry a bubble
of *normal* space around them. So Ship A is *not* in jump space. It\'s
in a small chunk of normal space that\'s inside jump space.

Alas for ship A, it\'s also in "normal space" that\'s nowhere *near*
"flat" enough for safe activation of a jump drive. So it suffers the
same fate as a ship trying to jump from the surface of a planet. 

Ship B runs into trouble because Ship A\'s attempts may disrupt the
bubble of normal space around it. In which case *it* goes away.

No, that\'s going from solid to *gas* in one step. Going from solid to

Hmm. You\'ve given me a nasty idea. I\'ll have to get a copy of the

Well, it\'ll require one *hell* of a lot of paperwork, since anything
above 50 cal is a "destructive device" unless it is black powder. 

But I vaguely recall someone designing an alien race for a wargame.
Said race was larger than humans and a *lot* more massive. Enough so
that they carried 20 mm "small arms". 

Consider, for example, what sort of pistol or rifle intelligent polar
bears would carry.

No, I want you to put a tag like \'Joe Bloggs wrote" at the start of the

Brevity would be nice, but the source would be a start. I don\'t believe I
asked you to clip everything originally sent.

Really. Gosh. That reads more like \'I can\'t be bothered to source the
quotes\', which is strange as at most it is a cut and paste, and some
packages do it automatically.

But I suppose that politeness isn\'t one of your strong points. As we have
seen repeatedly. Admittedly you\'ve had provokation, but you do that
yourself to others too.

I\'ve argued that you should be here on the list when others disagreed; Now
I start to agree with them - you seem determined to p*** off everyone on
this list, even those who argued for you to be here. Sadly, that\'s
something that I don\'t think will stop until you cease behaving like a
petulant teenager(*).

Waiting in hope that Clif will show some email ettiquette.

My high school (UK type - 11 to 18 age range, RC Church funded) actively
supported me in setting up an RPG and wargames club when I was a student
(aged 11). The content didn\'t bother them, but I suspect some of the more
extreme stuff now would. We regularly played Traveller, AD&D, CoC, RQII,
Paranoia, 2300 and a few others.

My wife\'s school (see teaches 11-16 Math) allows it\'s kids to Roleplay -
this involves a few RPGs and also some GW stuff.

Ammo size is a primary concern.  Go with 20 mm caseless.  :-)
Also, at 20 mm you can start building rather complicated rounds
with special penetrators, incendiary, or explosive variants.

Didn\'t the Stainless Steel Rat use a .75 cal (recoilless) pistol?

Obviously, the laser idea is a dead end.  How about dropping the

Yes, I know many of you will argue that this is progress, but T4 burnt out
in little under the space of two years. The rule books were badly edited and
the rules flawed in places.

I agree the T4 rules are flawed and I hope that Marc Miller learns from the

	I must admit I (and probably many others) felt really burned about the fate
of T4.  I honestly liked T4 alot, when it worked.  The source/background books
were excellent and I liked Emperor\'s Arsenal too.   While Starships and
Emperor\'s vehicles books were very irritating.   Nevertheless I played T4 and
had alot of fun--it was Traveller for real.   
	When T5 comes out I will buy it, I mean I had ordered the abortive revised
hard-backed T4 main rule book after all.  One thing I found while playing T4
was that much of the CT material and MT material was still vey useful in T4
(examples:  76 Patrons, "Broadsword",  The Chamax Plague/Horde, Imperial
Encyclopedia, Mercenary, Striker, Spinward marches, Solomain Rim,  MT alien
supplements).  

	They only big not-compatablity between systems was Starship and Vehicle
design specs.    It would be nice if one could use either T4, or MT or High
Guard ship designs in the new version, but if not, I\'ll design new ships as
needed.  (Although I admit, both in MT and T4 complilations of ground/grav
vehicles were among the last things to come out, and were one of the first
things I wanted).

	But back to the main point,  yes we should all feel burned by the fall of T4,
but Imperium Games deserves the blame and they are gone:  what good would
anger against them do us.   If we ignore T5 and don\'t support it, then the
result is the real "end of Traveller"  and that\'s precisely what we don\'t
want.  
	
	So my suggestion is to keep playing whatever version of Traveller you like
and buy those new Trav products which might be of interest, adventures,
sourcebooks etc.    As for me, I love reading Traveller stuff almost as much
as playing and will buy most of what comes out  (hell, i bought Gurps Trav and
have no interest in playing Gurps system--threw away my Gurps basic years
ago).

	It\'s funny that on the AD&D discussion list they\'re bitching and moaning
about the possibility of a third edition, when 2nd ed has been out for 10
years,  here we\'re really gearing up for edition #6 (if you count Gurps as 5).

I appologise if my post bothered you. I did not mean it as an attack or
flame and should have made it clearer. What I meant by it was that if
certain people\'s posts got to the point of being more annoying than
useful one should just shunt them into the dead file. I did this during
the ROM flame war, and have been doing this with the "Clif" crisis. by
doing this I may miss some useful bits but it does not raise my blood
pressure to the point where I become involved in the flame throwing. 

In other words if someone or some subjects bothers you just ignore it.
Eventually it all dies down and the list returns to normal. In my
experience the more it is ignored, the faster it dies down.

Again, I appologise for the comment.

    'body' => 'Some thoughts I had in response to Charles Collins comments on aslan

Aslan didn\'t rush over, they have been in the area of the Marches for
centuries.  They were in contact with the Zhodani hundreds of years ago,
and had a thriving trade in the Marches in the 500\'s (IIRC) with Dustspice.
Aslan among the Darrians have provided that empire an elite corp for some
time as well.  With the aslan hunger for land, I would assume they had at
least small colonies in the Marches for centuries.
Tthe ihatei problem in the Marches and Trojan Reach has been brewing for
some time.  It has reached critical mass in the late \'teens.  In TNE
timeline they had no organized Imperial resistance and overwhelmed the
Trojan Reach worlds (more on that below).  In the G:T timeline they are
meeting plenty of resistance.

In BtC the ihatie are described as \'inheriting nothing\' and as worthless
failures in the eyes of aslan society.  How does a bunch like this get
ahold of 10,000 dton cruisers and transports full of families?

Hans Rancke examined the motivations of an aslan clan leader.  Where do his
priorities fall, rembering that his main motive is control of his land?
Not only does a clan leader have to consider what other clan leaders are
doing, but he has to consider what all those worthless ihatie are doing.
Without something better to do, they are going to hang around the clan
holdings, attempting to knock off the clan leader get his land.  It would
be better if there are rival clans around, so that they go over there, but
the THEIR ihatie will be sniffing around here.  What do you do?  You can\'t
give your ihatie anything, it isn\'t fair to your first born.
You might set up a \'general fund\' to ship these ihatie offworld.  This
would almost certainly have to cross clan lines, to avoid the inheritance
taboo.  It would be more of a welfare program.  Multi-clan worlds, or a
cluster of single clan worlds would especially benefit, since they would
not have to deal with each others\' ihatie attacks.
The type of ships thus available to the ihatie would vary depending on the
wealth of the region they came from and the number of ihatie it has to deal
with.  The more ihatie or the less wealth, the smaller the ships.  The clan
leaders, only wanting to get rid of the ihatie, not necessarily making them
successful, will primary give them obsolete ships.
So you could have a range of anything, any size.  The only stipulation is
that they are old.  Most would be in the smaller size ranges, at a guess
(without doing an economic analysis of the aslan colonies in the Trojan
Reach).
I would think the transports follow later, only after word of a successful
conquest reaches the home system(s).  I haven\'t seen either of the aslan
books, so I don\'t know how cannon this is.  This too would be part of the
welfare program.  The ihatie wouldn\'t leave if they weren\'t absolutely sure
they would have families come after them.  No self respecting females would
follow worthless ihatie until they proved they could get land.
BTW there would be zero males in these transports.  Only females looking
for land owning husbands.  Why transport a bunch of rivals after you have
just risked your life fighting for this world, a place in society and a big
harem?

How did the ihatie take Tobia?  Probably without firing a shot.  Just
threaten to.  The aslan and the Tobians both know that in a fight, the
ihatie haven\'t got a chance.  However, how many of your 20 billion are you
willing to have killed?  How much control can you retain after a billion
are killed, and blame for the deaths pointed at you?  What are a few more
aslan anyway, as long as you can stay in power, ala Vichy?  The leaders of
Tobia, and lots of other worlds, would "sell out", pragmatically of course,
to the aslan invaders if they promised to keep the power structure in
place.  The aslan would only be furry Imperials, after all...

Traveller struggles to be a hard SF game.  Hard SF is the sub genre where
you try to keep the science part accurate.  A good example of hard SF can
be found in the works of Dr. Robert L. Forward.

There are three major technological assumptions made by Traveller.  FTL
travel via the jump drive, control of gravity, and cheap, effective fusion
reactors.  Beyond that, the designers have labored to keep the
technological magic to a minimum.

Take for example weapons.  We all agree that the blasters and phaser look
cool, but the fact is that the easist way to damage someone is to smack him
with a club.  A slug-thrower is a small club that works at range.  Without
making some wild-assed guesses about the base technology of a culture, it\'s
probable that in the future wars will still be fought by men carrying
rifles.  Of course those rifles will be as advanced as my M-16A1 was
compared to a Brown Bess, but the principle will be the same.

Doing this is a good thing in my opinion, since it serves many functions.
It keeps the game consistant; all the equipment plays by the same set of
rules.  It cuts down on the need to explain technology to the players,
since most people are familar enough with the concept of a pistol, you
don\'t have to stop the game for a long discourse on the apperance,
capabilities and operation of the Gridlore Technologies QQ-37 Atomic Space
Modulator, with Extra Flaam-Seeds!  For us Gearheads, we can expand the
universe rapidly with things like the THUDDD contest.. Hell, go out to my
GT pages and you\'ll find lots of toys that will work in any Traveller game
because they\'re designed using the same rules as everybody else\'s stuff.

The odd, unique Gizmo has a place.  One of my favorite JTAS articles was
the Casual encounter with Finger.  This guy was a gateway to weird
adventures that always involved odd gadgets.  But you have to be careful
about introducing amazing new technologies into the general population.
There is a rule of warfare, that any new technology will be countered
before the end of the conflict it is introduced in.  So if you introduce a
new tech, remember to think out how it will effect the entire campaign
enviroment.

Somewhere in storage I have a history of the Korean War which mentions a
Scottish unit that was being harassed by NK/PLA forces.  The Communists
were shouting, blow horns, all that.  So the Scots had their pipers start
up.  After a few numbers, the bad guys realized they were out done, and
slinked back down the hill.  I\'ll see if I can dig up the book and give a
proper reference.

IMTU the Imperial Marines use bagpipes.  One of the proudest skill
qualifications is Pipeman, and many in the Navy think that the only reason
the Marines love the pipes is because it annoys the Navy.

When the marines are prepping for a landing, they will jam enemy
communications with recorded pipe and drum corps music.  After a few dozen
renditions of "Sylea the Brave"*, most opponents will give up trying to use
their commo nets.

*There is a grand tradition of renaming songs and adopting tunes for new
uses.  The US national Anthem is sung to the tune of an old drinking song,
and we changed "God Save the Queen" to "My Country \'Tis of Thee."

OK, I\'m planning on going to GenCon this year.  Shall we make plans to have
a Traveller party?  I have a friend who microbrews, and he can provide all
the Scout Brew we can drink.  :P

I\'m serious about this, and I\'ll be happy to plan it if enough people
decide to go.

Hear hear! If i reacall correctly, the last time i PLAYED Traveller was
back in the MT-days.
Still, I love to read the books, even if i have no chance or time of playing.

Some people I know bought what they considered to be AD&D 3rd.! What was

Why? I have probably bought more different Traveller rules set than any one
of you:
CT (Normal and Deluxe)
German CT
MT
G:T
TNE
T4
and will happily buy T5 as well. My favorite Set is still the MT set, but
in every new set there has been something that made it worth buying. I
bought T4 knowning about its flaws, and still mined it for some tidbits. I
am looking forward to T5 as it will be, I hope, better than T4 and
therefore a good lead-in to Traveller for new players. Traveller can now
truely boast that it has something for everyone. What you like, you use,
and the more choice you have, the more quality your game has.

Welcome to the Club. I have started with German Traveller, and switched to
MT when it came out. The MT set had everything CT missed, a task system,
details of the background (something the CT rules CT sorely missed). Then
MT got discontinued, so I got TNE. Didnt like it as much, but still
continued to buy (only missing the Regency books: -anyone???). TNE got
cancelled, and i had great hopes for T4. Bought it. Being a Gurpsist, i
needed to get G:T as well, and am greatly impressed with it. Qua usability,
it comes second on my list. It didnt have much new stuff, but had it
organized in a different way, so it was well worth the expense. I will also
buy T5, for which I have great hope. And: When i start promoting Traveller
locally again, I will have to have the Rules system to present to the new
players. 

>Yes, I know many of you will argue that this is progress, but T4 burnt out

...and we hope T5 will change all that. Traveller had an image of being
slightly bad edited, in Germany it was often considered a bit bland (due to
the German edition, which was a  mediocre translated CT). If T5 is what i
consider perfectly executed, I can say, ok that was the past, but look at
Traveller now. Traveller updated for the 90ties, designwise.

It\'s OK for  (American) football players to be a----s. They can rape,
assault, and vandalize; it\'s oh boys will be boys; all because football is
such an ingrained American institution. It\'s a cultural substitute for war,
and tribalism (ie. "the Jets rule-Miami sucks!" or some such drivel). Jocks
are coddled and spoiled and always bailed out of trouble, if they are good.
Agression is rewarded, not punished as agression and physical size are vital
for football. American universities spend enormous amounts of money on
football and basketball, and very little on academics. They say good sports
brings in the money and donations. This is true, but most of this money is
pumped right back into the athletic program.

Contrast this with the intellectuals in America (and this includes gaming).
They are usually seen in school as marginal "nerds", etc. American culture
doesn\'t appreciate brains. Intellectuals are distrusted as "controlling
elites". Look how intellectuals are portrayed in film. They are geeky buffoons
and their brilliant plans need brawny jocks to carry them out (who always get
the credit and the girl). Thus the moment that a gamer gets in trouble (or any
intellectual for that matter), he/she is slammed by the press and has the
legal book thrown at them. We Americans are morons when it comes to picking
our heros...:-(

When I teach, if I end up coaching (and that is a certainty in Las Vegas, as
this town is sports crazy, and I want a job), I will not let my players get
away with this garbage, anymore than I would let my gamers (though I bet the
gamers will be much less of a discipline problem) in the gaming club I intend
to run...

Sorry for the rant...

Marc Miller may have good intentions, but it is the publishers of Traveller
who are abusing our following of the game. They know we will rush out and
buy the next Traveller publication as soon as it is released. Probably why
Steve Jackson Games bought a license and created the ultimate bastardised
version (which I wouldn\'t piss on if it was on fire).

AD&D has been in print around 30 years and they have only felt it necessary
to revise it 2 times to date. I still play 1st Ed. as in my opinion if it
ain\'t broke don\'t fix it. What does that say about Traveller? Someone is
trying to rip us off.

I will not be buying T5 when it comes out. Instead I will wait some time and
assess public opinion. I have sufficient CT, MT & T4 sourcebooks to keep my
happy in my Traveller gaming and unless T5 is really something very special
(and perfectly edited with flawless rules) I won\'t be buying it at all.

I know the leaning of this group, but I\'ll stick my neck out anyway.

Look, there were many disappointments with T4 and hard feelings abound
because some, even some on this list, were never paid for their work
on the project.  But how about the rest of the story...

As has been noted, T4 had some very good products and some bombs.  But
all systems do.  Early copies of G:T had wimpy bindings that
disintegrated.  How can that be excused from a company that has been
publishing so "well" for so long?  T:TNE had cartoon artwork that made
Chris Foss\' stuff look like Masters.  MT was 80% repackaged CT.  Even
my beloved CT had it\'s share of duds: I have never used Supplement 2,
The Traveller Adventure was a bad joke and Atlas of the Imperium was
worse.  Yet each of these systems has it\'s steadfast proponents.  And
with good reason.

T4 had some big problems in it\'s first published items, but the
important things were fixable.  And the new milieu was enticing.  The
production schedule was nothing short of amazing.  GDW never supported
Traveller with twenty publications in an 18 month time span.  The
rules and setting had more the feel of CT than the iterations in
between.  The magazine had a good format and look-feel.  Pocket
Empires is a great idea and actually can work with a tiny group or
even one-on-one.  Missions of State is a challenge.  The physical
quality is a cut above the T:TNE.

Perhaps the best thing about T4, though, was the fact that it was new.
 It was a re-entry point, too.  I would certainly be on a different
mailing list right now if it weren\'t for T4.  It got me interested
again after a long absence and prompted me to pull out my boxes of CT
and "get back in the game", so to speak.  Now I wear my T4 t-shirt and
tell the curious about Traveller.  I have published web pages, started
buying CT stuff, and joined mailing lists and a PBeM.  For me T4 will
always have a place in my heart and on my bookshelf.  Between 1986 and
1996 I grew to think that maybe Traveller had died off.  Today we are
both quickened.  Works for me!

Now a few words about you - do you remember the basic set?  Were you
able to open that box, take out those little black books and have some
fun?  So what happened to you?  How come you can\'t be happy with less
than a full bore, pre-arranged, fleshed out, infallible system?  You
hide behind the excuse, "Times have changed, RPGs have advanced,
Traveller has to compete or be left behind."  Poppycock, I say.  CT
succeeded with me because it was simple and sensible compared to D&D. 
I could create anything, do anything, try anything.  And each GMs
universe was so different that the game was totally new when played
with a different group, yet the mechanics were the same.  In my mind
Traveller was the first universal role play system.  And 2d6 is still
the most powerful system because it has suspense and yet is instantly
understood.  No one is ammune to that shiver that goes up your spine
when someone rolls "snake eyes".  Anyway, consider yourself chastised.

From the sci.space.* newsgroup faq list:

<http://www.lib.ox.ac.uk/internet/news/faq/archive/space.math.html>

 Vc	= sqrt(M * G / r)
 Vesc 	= sqrt(2 * M * G / r) = sqrt(2) * Vc

where:

3.986e14 m^3/s^2 (4e14)  	= Gravitational constant times mass of Earth (M *
G)
6371 km (6400)  		= Mean radius of Earth (r0)

You should be able to use these figures and plug in M and r as multiples of
Earth\'s mass and radius. Note that Vesc is different on the ground and in
orbit (r > r0).

Interested, yes.

Personally, I like the roleplaying aspects of Traveller a lot more
than the wargame or political/empire building elements.  I would
*not* be especially interested in an automated "Trillion Credit
Squadron" or "Pocket Empires."  

What I would be *very* interested in, is software that focused
making it easier for groups of players to *roleplay* in the
Traveller universe.

So, what do *you* have in mind?

>Can you make the software Linux compatible, too?

More to the point will you, *please*, plan, from the start, to make
it NON-PLATFORM specific?  Will you write the client-end in pure
java, so people with Macs, Linux/Unix, OS2, DOS, *and* Windows based
systems can all play with the same features and interface?

IMTU, jump is through an artificially created wormhole (that\'s
*part* of what all the hydrogen is for).

No, Bruce, Craig, Suz, Tim, Keven, James, Carlos, and Greg, IMTU,
you can\'t do it and if your characters try they\'ll damage or (more

Well...in the *orthodox* TU you probably do.  The grav pulse just
doesn\'t have the power to accelerate a stream of plasma up to useful
velocities for ship-to-ship combat.  The only reason it works with
lasers is that both are already ls beams.

OTOH, a weapon that created a rapid series of grav-pulses, each of
which accellerated the plasma just a little more, *might* make
fusion/plasma weapons handwavable for very, *very* short ranges.
The problem is that the energy needed to accellerate the plasma
might be too great, and even if not would probably be more
effectively used in other ways...like powering more lasers.

Hee!  Hee!  "Inverse laser microphone" should have been described as
a modulated laser...that\'s what Clif is describing, I think...and I
don\'t see why it wouldn\'t work...in theory.  However, it would
probably work *very* poorly. ;->

We *can* modulate a laser, it\'s the basis behind laser comms after
all.  Such a beam striking a ship hull, would cause waves that
propagate through to the inside.  IF these waves were still strong
enough to vibrate the air inside the ship in the right frequencies
you would get audible sound. That sound *could* be a howl.

However, Clif\'s "howler" doesn\'t seem practical (even *if* possible)
in Traveller-reality.  The amount of energy needed to create
vibrations strong enough to create a howl like sound would be so
high as to, probably, make it\'s use prohibitive for communication,
IOW\'s it would just be an inefficient pulse laser.  Additionally, to
get the right frequencies of sound inside the ship would be next to
impossible, just because each ship hull would have different armor
thicknesses, materials, and things attached to it.

BTW, and I\'m NOT going to get involved in Vargr combat tactics, but
where did the idea that canines howl to announce the intention of
combat come from?  I\'ve never heard that animals in the canine
family, dog, wolf, coyote, jackal howl *before* attacking, and they
never have in attacks I\'ve seen.  If it was a dominance or defense
attack, there was barking, whimpering and growling, yes, but not
full-throated howling.  If the attack was predatory it began silently
with barks, growls and yips taking place *during*, but not before.

So, why *do* canines howl?  I suggest it is as a form of
communication announcing and marking their territory, and announcing
their location and identity to the rest of their pack.

Do Vargr howl?  It wouldn\'t surprise me if they did, but not in the
way, or for the reasons, Clif suggests.

Do Vargr bark and growl?  That wouldn\'t surprise me either, but it
would surprise me if the sounds a Vargr *normally* makes are any
closer to those of dog or wolf than human sounds are to chimps and
bonos.

At 200 G, Kzin warships should be able to dance/evade laser fire at a 
a hundred thousand km, and hammer terran ships, laser and all, into
pate with kinetic weapons. Not even a challenge (unless Kzin are too
stupid to evade and/or prejudiced against kinetic weapons and/or the

velocity when you turn the drive off.)

Thousands?  10s would be plenty.

It might be interesting but I think to do it right, you\'d need a team of GMs
to coordinate smaller groups and individuals and to share the load.
But assuming you could get such a team together, it would be cool
to have crossing theme lines where players might be working against
each other, and not knowing if the people they talk to are players
or NPCs.

Timing might be tough though, if player groups iinersect each other.

I\'m game though.

You mean the highland regiments didn\'t take their kilts off as
the auld highlanders used to?  I wonder what effect on German
morale that would have had?

I agree with that.  Personally, I\'m not a big fan of computer games
that call themselves rpgs.  There is a place for them, just as there
is a place for solitare card games, but no one is suggesting that
poker or bridge should be replaced by computer-poker or
computer-bridge.  It\'s the interaction of several humans that make
most card games interesting to me, just as it is the interaction of
several humans (one of whom is the Ref) that interest me in rpgs.
 
I think a great marriage of rpgs and computers *is* possible.  You
would have a system where several people could participate in a
universe presented through a computer, but where the plot and
interactions between that universe and the PC\'s were controlled
*interactively* by the GM.  This is where MUD/MUSH/MOO, PBEM, IRC
and ICQ games are headed, but haven\'t gotten to yet...IMO.

But this has nothing to do with Traveller\'s Last Chance. ;->

Really?  That explains why only a handfull of singers on the planet have the
necessary vocal range to sing the song correctly.  IIRC, its greater than 4
octaves.
Of course, I prefer Marvin Gaye\'s rendition. Not many countries have anthems
capable of so much soul and funk.  ;-)

Theres some software being tested now that along these lines.
(PC only though at this point) But the idea is good.  Its called
Infinite Worlds by Black Isle (www.blackisle.com).  I think
its only for fantasy worlds, but the idea is what important here.

I can\'t get my brother and friends interested in Traveller PBeM.
What they want is a software front end that contains a GM-created
and controlled and created environment and allows a number of
players on clients to play together.  Ideally it has voice communication
as well.

Black Isle\'s Baldur\'s Gate seems to have a working model for
the clien side of it (for PCs), how the players can work together in
the same environment (and the company I work for has the voice
software - www.resounding.com).  However, for a good environment,
you need a lot of data on the client\'s system.  Updating on the net wouldn\'t
be feasible currently.

I think Java-native client would also be a nightmare at this point.  It would
be easier to make a PC version and then port to Mac and other OSs.
Also a nightmare but some internet games are successfully cross-platform
(such as WarBirds - www.imaginconline.com).

The basic idea my brother and I have had is that you put all the software
and data files on CDs and each client would need one.  The GM then
creates the envirnoment by selecting artwork, texture maps, terrains,
objects, AI controlled NPCs, etc., and putting them together.  That way
the clients just need to be told which object or texture to use on their
front-end.  Different CDs could have different sets of objects, art and
npcs/monsters, so you could have a generic fantasy, generic Sci-Fi,
Traveller-licensed, etc. CD for GMs to work with.

Mutli-platform is an ideal, but more platforms = less features, at least
until Java lives up to its ideals.  And the money is in the PC market
at this point.  As much as I\'d love a  multi-platform traveller
multiplayer environment, I think thats a long way off.  However,
a PC-Traveller for single or multi-player is feasible right now.

I wish Marc would license Traveller to Black Isle.  I think they
could do for a T5, and even G:T what Baldur\'s Gate is doing
for AD&D.

Sorry to ramble.

\'Britons\' it depends what part of Britain you come from. As I am from
Scotland you can call me a Scot. The English south of the border can be

In the UK RPGer\'s are referred to usually as \'sad, lonely, miserable

Scotsmen never removed their kilts when faced by the enemy. Not a good idea
when faced by an enemy to have your kilt round your ankles. They would
either perform a \'Sunny\' or a \'Moony\' i.e. Lift the kilt to show Genitalia
or lift the kilt to show the buttocks.

It is still quite a common occurance these days at Scottish weddings, well
all the ones I have been too.

No, no, your missing my point. I liked T4 too. I felt it had the right

No offense intended but might your profession be school teacher? I have
played Traveller since it was first brought out in the UK (i.e. over 15
years). I have a large collection of CT, MT and T4 books and take great
delight in their content. What I object to is spending hard earned money on
a product that is not merchantable standard. Editorial problems and flawed
rules are unforgiveable in a gaming system. Many times I have received a T4
book from my mail order supplier only to be disappointed by the books poor
content. Only Pocket Empires and Psionics Institutes stand out as the two
highlights of the system.

Traveller doesn\'t have to compete, in the RPG world it is almost unique. How
many gaming systems excepting AD&D have lasted more than 20 years. It is
RPGing in general that is in demise.

Out of interest, how many people on this mailing list are below 25 years of
age?

It\'s not merely a matter of manners. It\'s a matter of direct insults. In the
time I\'ve been on this list, I\'ve seen very few folks resort to name
calling. Clif has not only done it repeatedly, he\'s done it crudely. At one
point during the Vargr tactics discussion he called Doug Berry a j*rkoff.

Boy, that\'s what I love to see. That is also what set me off.

>Nobody wants to read the rants over and over again on the list.


Fine, however, you\'ve added to the rants yourself now. You could have just
as easily made this appeal via private email, but you didn\'t.

On the other hand, I don\'t know about anyone else, personally, I don\'t want
to see my fellow Travellers, who I\'ve come to like and whose posts I enjoy
get called a _j*rkoff_ because they disagree with someone else\'s posts!

Nor do I want to be insulted by someone for disagreeing with their posts.

If such behavior is tolerated by us, as the members of the TML, then,
personally, I\'m out of here.

>THIS is a TRAVELLER LIST, not a MOMMY, HE HIT ME FIRST-LIST.


You\'re right, this is the Traveller list, Volker, not the "<blank> is a
j*rkoff because he doesn\'t agree with me list." If that\'s the way you\'d like
the list to go, then I\'ll be happy to leave.

My apologies to all for the use of implied profanity in this posting. I did
it to make a point. Personal insults are one thing. If it was simply me that
Clif was insulting I\'d have just ignored him. However, it wasn\'t just me,
and it wasn\'t just about "hot button" topics like politics or religion. When
such activity gets dragged into normal, Traveller related discussion, that\'s
it for me, personally.

Well, when I was at school, role playing wasn\'t invented <sigh>. However, at the
schools I have taught at for the last 22 years (Government High Schools -- Years
7-12, or around 11-18 years of age) there has been no policy at all about role
playing. At one I actually ran a role playing campaign with some of the students
at lunchtime for around a year and a half before I transferred elsewhere.

At my current school the only role playing (related) activity I am aware of is
that there is a hard core of a dozen or so students who tend to be in the
Library at Recess and Lunch playing Tragic: The Addiction. There must be more
than that, but not at school, as the kids are also reasonably aware of what
"Dungeons and Dragons" is (mainly when I tell them what I do with *my*
Saturdays).

I thought banning them was very much an American fundamentalist inspired thing?

Okay, to ObTrav the discussion: What is the proper word for Imperial
citizens? Is it \'imperials\'? I use that one to refer to the navy, the
marines, and the direct _Imperial_ types. Is there a generic word for the
dirthuggers of the Imperium? You know, the people who are citizens of
specific planets, but not specifically involved in Imperial affairs? Is such
a distinction needed?

We refer to them that way here, too! :^) Although, I must admit, in certain
circles games like Vampire: The Masquerade have done wonders for the "chic"
of roleplaying...

This is true, but you have to remember that gravity affects everything
around it, & at 100 Diameters the level of gravity is in the microgravity
range...  But, with the amount of energy released when the second ship
jumps inside of the first...  I would have to say the amount of energy
comming off the second would destroy the first ship...  As the first ship
explodes, the second ship would follow suit...  In other words, as I like
to say, "Ships go boom"...

Then a lot of history books need to be fixed.
I\'ve read countless reports of this being a common occurrence
among the Scottish highlanders, long ago.  This story relating to
the reasoning for not wearing anything under the kilt:  throw off
the kilt and your naked (maybe a shirt).  The reason for doing that
being that the old kilts, which were yards and yards of fabric
wrapped around the waist and shoulder, was an encumberance
and danger when fighting close in.  Especially if they got wet.

And of course, the intimidating sight of dozens of blue-painted, sword-wielding

naked highlanders charging downhill at you with the bagpipes blaring in the
background and setting your teeth on edge would certainly give rise
to a morale check.

I\'m not talking about Rob Roy and William Wallace era, but
long before that.

With all honesty, at least on the East Coast of the U.S., that movement
wasn\'t quite as big as it sounds. However, more secular materials (such as
Rona Jaffe\'s "Mazes & Monsters") had much more of an impact. The book,
"Mazes & Monsters" sold well, and it was really nothing more than a pathetic
attempt to cash in on the newfound popularity of Dungeons & Dragons (about
1981 or so, major toy chains started picking up on the game, and in short
order a tremendously bad cartoon series would make an appearance).
Roleplaying-specific stores turned into chains (in the case of \'The Compleat
Strategist\').

Anyway, "Mazes & Monsters" (which starred Tom Hanks) was made into a
television movie. It spawned a slew of imitations... Although the book and
the movie are hardly remembered, people _do_ still remember certain elements
of the movie as fact. The basic story is that an emotionally disturbed young
man became seriously and (presumably incurably) mentally and and withdrew
into a fantasy world as a result of his brush with "Dungeons & Dragons." The
media made a big thing about "D&D related suicides" during that period,
which also sits in the back of people\'s heads.

Around here, that\'s what people really remember. I collect religious
pamphlets, a couple of them attack heavy metal music, and in passing mention
Dungeons & Dragons, not terribly interesting. I do have one_classic_,
published by the Catholics during the height of the roleplaying boom that
goes into alot of detail about the evils of Dungeons & Dragons. Apparently,
in Arkansas and other states there was more made of the "Satanic" angle than
around here.

My apologies for the kind of off topic post.

I\'m new to this list.  I never realized until now that any such thing 
existed.  It\'s great to read all these posting about my favorite game.  
I started playing Traveller in 1979, when I was a junior in high school.  
Yes, I started with the 3 black books.  Now I have all the black books, 
supplements, Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society issues, Challenge 
issues, and a few Megatraveller books.

Does anyone think as I do that the books and supplements and rules and 
materials serve as a GUIDELINE to great role playing?  The group I\'m in 
pretty much uses the Megatraveller play system and character generation, 
and we use all the background history (Spinward Marches, The Dark Times, 
The New Era) as the backdrop for our adventures.  We don\'t harp so much 
on flaws in the game system, as we make workarounds for them.  If 
something doesn\'t suit us then we change it, or if something is not 
complete or missing altogether, then we add it.

Does anyone have anything that they\'ve changed in the game system or 
worked around or added that makes play better?  If so, I\'d love to hear 
about it, and share what changes and additions we\'ve made also.

Thanks all.

I picked up the game "Tribes" (from SJG) to use in class. I can _highly_
recommend this one-it\'s great fun, educational, and cheap ($10US).

Essentially, all the players are primitive humans, trying to survive. The
winners are the male and female with the most surviving adult children
after 20 years.  Check out the description on teh SJG web site for more
information.

The sad commentary?  The writers apparently felt it necessary to include
in the rules that pregnant women can\'t get pregnant again until after the
baby is born.

ObTrav?  There\'s some suggestions for modelling alien biologies included
after the optional rules. It would be interesting to model, say, primitive
Aslan and see what social structures evolve. Anyone interested in a PBeM? 
I\'ll coordinate.

Didn\'t someone say once that technology, if sufficiently advanced, is 
indistinguishable from magic?  Could anyone 200 years ago, with their 
understanding of science, explain a device such as a laptop computer for 
example?  Surely they would say it was "fantasy" or "impossible".

Think about it.

?

>I have played Traveller since it was first brought out in the UK
(i.e. over 15 years). I have a large collection of CT, MT and T4 books
and take great  delight in their content. What I object to is spending
hard earned money on a product that is not merchantable standard.
Editorial problems and flawed rules are unforgivable in a gaming
system. Many times I have received a T4 book from my mail order
supplier only to be disappointed by the books poor content. Only
Pocket Empires and Psionics Institutes stand out as the two highlights
of the system.<

I certainly admitted it\'s faults.  The only solution to getting that
"burned" feeling over and over would be to refuse to purchase the
offensive products.  The reviews of each title were available on the
web very early on.  I am one of the completist fools who would have
anted up no matter what.  Errata and fixes started to circulate early,
too.  You are right to say that the number of flaws in the product
became unforgivable.  That is why the publisher went belly up and lost
their license to boot.  Most of the errors in the product were due to
poor editing and a rush to publish, not creative lack on the part of
the writer (tho some were).

To visit the sins of the father on the son is fine.  Vice versa is
unfair.  Certainly Marc had a lapse in judgment when he allowed IG so
much free reign.  But the problem was "who" he gave the freedom to,
not the fact that he gave it to them.  IG is entirely to blame for the
product they produced.  Marc is at fault for licensing it to the wrong
people.  I\'m sure that Marc has learned his lesson well and will go
and sin no more.  Remember, for Marc to be able to pull the license he
had to have a contractual reason.  By far the most common contract
breaches are those that involve money.  I assume (though I do not
know) that Marc went unpaid in some portion, too.  If we were stung by
T4, it\'s safe to assume that Marc was more so.  The only way for him
to redeem his good name will be to publish a much better product.  Can
he do it?  I don\'t know.  But he has, by virtue of his contribution to
the genre, earned the right to attempt the feat.  I will keep an open
mind and a positive attitude, based on the content rather than the
execution of T4.

The other problem, which is a problem for FtF play too, is what happens
when players try to go "off the map".  This is why the Islands Cluster in
Trillion Credit Squadron is so isolated, of course.  

It\'s not such a worry if there are live GMs, but if it\'s to be at least
semi-automated, it would be.

I would like such mega-games to be playable on both high and low levels.

An example:  Take the situation in Aramis subsector/Spinward Marches, as
described in the Traveller Adventure.  You have high-level entities -
subsector and planetary governments, corporations, Vargr corsairs, and so
on.  You also have low-level ones - ship crews, local corporate reps, and
so on.  There are also "mid-level" possibilities - Aramanx, IIRC, is a
balkanised, war-torn world.

A subsector level game like this (details fiddled of course), could keep a
lot of people busy - traders, corsairs, corsair-hunters, maybe explorers,
mercs, planetary rulers, corporate wannabes, criminals....

Of course a subsector is precisely the level where people will jump off the
edge of the map.  A whole sector would be better - start everyone in the
middle subsectors, and subtly hint that they shouldn\'t go outside the
sector.  Of course, the more area you have, the more sparsely the players
are distributed, and of course it\'s their interactions that make stuff
really interesting.  Why talk to/brawl with an NPC in a bar, when you could
brawl with/talk to another PC?

And, of course, there\'s no reason why people couldn\'t play both high and
low level characters - I\'m sure Archduke Norris has his trusted agents.

Welcome to the list, Rick!

Yes, with a capital Y.

There\'s potential to start a great discussion here :^)

Anyway, yes, I don\'t tend to muck around with the rules too much (except
when I have to patch something on the spot in a game). I tend to be much
more into screwing around with the background stuff. Automation and
computers are more prominent in my own game. Biotech pops up quite often,
artificial intelligence exists, and a certain degree of nanotechnology is
commonplace. That\'s the technology end of it, at least.

My own Traveller universe is one where giant Megacorporate cargo ships weave
their automated way through the Imperium, while free traders struggle to
compete (by being flexible enough to carry small, high value cargoes). It\'s
a place where nanotechnology is so commonplace that citizens walk under
lightposts never even noticing the hight tech Delgado manufactured
nanomachines that roost on them, keeping them safe from microscopic assault.
It\'s an Imperium where public opinion is starting to turn against the
Imperium as the Imperial "hands off" policy is tested by nasty atrocities.
Basically though, it\'s the same old Imperium with a technology upgrade...

On the cultural end, it can be a little difficult to juggle the existing
Traveller background and update it to more properly reflect real world
developments. I\'ve learned from the list that this type of thing isn\'t to
everyone\'s tastes though.

At any rate, I\'m perfectly willing to toss something official (or canon) if
it doesn\'t fit into my campaign. It might not be perfect, but hey, my
players don\'t seem to mind when I do. The again, it\'s me, not them, that has
pumped countless dollars into Traveller materials.

>Thanks all.


I don\'t know if this is the kind of thing you were looking for...

But summer is the best time to visit Vacationland, Maine!  I have the

riding trails and big barbeque pits.  Woo hoo, Traveller Reunion

Sorry about that.  My wife says that you were talking about Pat
Robertson.  Guess I made a mistake.  And she said that she thinks
Traveller vs. Mel Gibson was a good trade.  So, I guess you\'re off the
hook (this time).

Hi Jeff, I kind of missed this when you posted it (and now I feel like a

Not me, by a number of years.  I\'m 37, and bought first edition, first printing
Traveller when it hit the shelves in 1977.  I kept up with CT as it was published,
MT as _it_ was published, and decided that TNE didn\'t have anything I wanted.  T4
sounded good, but I waited a bit, and T5? Well, we\'ll see.

With all due respect, Mazes and Monsters was inspired by the real case of James
Dallas Egbert III, who disappeared from a Michigan State dorm one day in, um,
1979, I believe.  When it came out, people still remembered the Egbert case,
so the identity of the character in the book who disappeared was a "twist", since
it wasn\'t the most Egbert-like of the bunch.

I like the idea, and my parents live in the Detroit area, so Toledo would be great.

Hehe, had one of those here in NZ too, it had some crazy quote about the

Now, wait just a minute! Calgary, Alberta has a spot that\'s free,

I recall a Murphy\'s Rules cartoon (from way back), "A Family Way". It

Actually the technical maximum of the Imperium (in Milieu 1100) in TTL
16 which is equal to TTL 13 (although I would call TTL 16 _early TL 13 &
have most GTL 13 items be TTL 17).

TTL 15 = GTL _12_ not 13.

Well "canonically" the Imperial Navy does make crude copies of the
Ancient Black globes they find.  These crude copies are TTL 15 or GTL
12.  If the original Ancient Black globes were say GTL 15 and the
Imperium brought in their top research people [Say skill 20-25 and with
TTL 16 [GTL 13] backgrounds.] who were therefore working at -10 +
unfamiliarity penalties. They should indeed have been able to copy these
items so cannon makes sense. 

Even if a particular ancient device _could_ have been first constructed
at "only" GTL 14 any particular example might have been built at GTL
16.  So just because Gurps Ultra Tech I calls a Braincorder [a device
that can copy someones entire mind to tape at range] GTL 14 you are free
to say that the particular example the PC\'s find is the improved GTL 16
version.

It is perfectly acceptable in GURPS to also apply an "unfamiliarity"
penalty (-4 is typical but it can vary) to use of high tech level
gadgets just as you would for unfamiliar gadgets of your own tech level.

Remember that in GURPS failing to make your skill roll by 10 points is a
critical failure.  Lets take the case of a "typical" band of Traveller
adventurers who have found an Ancient Artifact.  They let the ships
Engineer look at it.  We will call this Engineer Skill 16 [Traveller
skill level 4 (which is pretty good)].  She does not have a TTL 16 [GTL
13] background.  They have just found a handheld something and ask her
to try & figure it out.

The something is [unkown to her] GTL 15 so she has a TL penalty of -15
to skill.  She does not know what it is so she has a further
unfamiliarily penalty. [We will say that the something has a very simple
design with only a few buttons and call the unfamiliarity penalty only
- -2.]  Her effective skill is 16-15-2 = Skill -1.  Her player rolls 3d6
and gets a 10.  That is 11 points worse than her effective skill of -1
so it is a critical failure.  The Ancient Artifact happens to be a
Disintegrator Pistol.  Our protagonist has just disintegrated somone, or
several someones, possibly including herself.

[If you want to be a real jerk about it just rule that all the cool
Ancient Artifacts are psionic in nature & can\'t be used if you are not
psionic.  Not only will this stop players from running around with too
much power but it even fits cannon.]

[Note to self If I want my my Gurps Travellers want to be able of trying
to analyze Ancient artifacts make sure to give them Luck during
charecter generation.] 

I note that this is my first post to the TML in over a month.  I used to
post every other day or so.  The signal to noise ration here is getting
a bit higher than I prefer.

IYTU, what is the worst thing you can call someone? That is, worst

they forgot their snub pistol and came after your (Brawling-5) character

What if you could have 2-3 different games ? Perhaps one aimed at freeform
roleplaying, one more mission based, and another that was a political/empire
building game. All of these could be independent games, but played in the
same game world.

So for the roleplayers in the group comes complex interpersonal relationship
development. For the goal-bunnies who like to achieve a target and
wealth/fame etc, there would be hundreds of opportunities to boldy go where
no-one has gone before. And for the god-heads, the control of politics and
the market in the gameworld would be dictated by them. Each of these types
of players would be affected by cascading causality based on interaction by
players on different levels.

How about an Event Driven Game Engine that does nothing except generate the
kind of prose (dialogue and narrative) that you would find in a novel, or
short story between player characters and the world around them.

Actually, our EDGE System can generate turn results in many formats - either
direct to printers or fax, as the body of an email, the attachment of an
email or as a binary file that can be read by a front-end.

If there was to be such a front-end developed (and I\'m not saying there is,
but I\'m also not saying there isn\'t - so what exactly am I saying ?) then I
perceive that it would be written in Java in two forms, as a main executable
for each platform, or as an applet that would embedded in a web page.

Who say\'s you need to use a team of GMs ? More to the point why do they have
to be human ? We\'ve already developed our proprietary EDGE System for
PBM/PBeM that allows exactly what you\'re talking about above. It\'s currently
in playtest for another product. Here\'s a sample of what it can generate:

======================================================

Background: The "Gala Princess" is attempting to dock at Hibernian Station.

RESULT:
Slowly, inexorably, the ship\'s thrusters gently manoeuvre it into a holding
position in front of the Hibernian space station.

"Clear for docking, Gala Princess. Disengage your thrusters and allow for
station docking control."

Jenn let go of the ship\'s controls. "I don\'t like letting someone else take
control of my ship."

Barra leaned forward from his seat. "Neither do I. You might fly this ship,
but it\'s me that has to fix the bits that break."

Jenn grinned at the big Vargr engineer. "Let\'s hope Hibernian control have a
gentle touch then ..."

Docking arms were extended from the Hibernian station. Long grasping metal
arms that caressed the hull of the Gala Princess, and brought her slowly to
a standstill. There was a slight judder as the docking walkway was extended
and secured onto the ship\'s hull. A hiss of air, and docking was complete.

"Well people," said Jenn. "Shall we see what we can see on Hibernian ?"

======================================================

Whilst not strictly relating to Traveller, this was generated from several
player character positions and other gameworld data using our EDGE System
and one single command - dock the ship. Imagine what a Traveller game could
be like ....

> Timing might be tough though, if player groups iinersect each other.

Not if the game was played on a regular turn basis, and in a particular
fashion.

> I\'m game though.

Glad to hear it. Watch this space.

Who says ? <g>

Perhaps a company has developed a computer-moderated game engine that runs
from a HUGE database backend with oodles and oodles of gameworld data,
intelligent NPCs controlled by an AI, and features galore. As well as being
fully customisable by a game administrator/moderator and pushing the
boundaries of interactive story-telling. Where 1000s of players can interact
with each other and re-write the gameworld as the go. Where only the limits
of imagination (and the laws of physics) could stop a player from allowing
his character(s) to do anything.

Lets also say that perhaps that company is very interested in doing
Traveller. And is also in the process of scoring several other major
well-known RPG titles to turn into the same kind of game.

Perhaps I\'ve said too much <s>.

Will it have real Scouts in it?

[Said in by best Wednesday Adams voice.]

Did you ever wonder if Scout brew requires the use of (unspecified) body
fluids and/or tisues in the recepie? [Naturally the best Scout brew
would incorporate parts from Scouts of multiple species.] With Traveller
Tech levels they can always grow the blood, or fingers, or whatever, in
the base medical lab.  Maybe Scout brew brewing attempts should require
access to a Med Lab, or dead Scouts?  [Logically this would explain what
Vilani are doing in the otherwise culturally Solomanish IISS, it is
theri only way of continuing their cannibal past.]

Perhaps the reason the Imperium does not go in for nanotechnology is
because their had a nanotech disaster in the past when Scouts [Imperial
or Sylean, depending on when you want to set the incident] used
nanotecnology to make Scout Brew with and the results were, shall we
say, less than a complete success....

I\'m not sure who produced them but I happened to visit a hobby shop
today, unfortunately they\'ve pretty much reduced their gaming section to
some Magic cards and D&D books. However they had 4 packs of TNE
minatures stuck in a corner. IIRC there were 2 packs of "techs" with a
Hiver and human per pack, a pack of "marines" humans in combat armor,
3-4 I think, and a pack of Aslan warriors. 

Since I use 15mm I just looked at them. If there\'s interest I could go
back and grab them for someone. I think the price was arounf $5.00 a
pack.

Ah, but you forget that in Summer all of Mass. comes to Maine, so all

Note also that temperature has a moderating effect on the ammount of
precipitation that is required for a specific type of climate.  The
distribution of the precipitaion is also a factor.

For example the city I live in, Anchorage Alaska has a (30 year average)
precipitaion of only 11.9" [30 cm] per annum.  However we do not have
the "arid" climate that the recently posted tables describe as being the
result of less than 50cm of precipitation per year.  Instead we have a
typical, or even a damp, climate.  This is because at cooler
temperatures more of the water goes into the ground before evaporating &
more of your precipitation falls as snow in the first place.  In
climates where winter temperature are below freezing your winter
precipitation builds up & all melts in the spring.  Spring is one of the
times plants need water & the melting snow provides it.

Note also that mountains will have a vast impact on precipitaion
patterns.  Consider two areas.  One (west of a barrier mountain range)
gets a flash flood of 6cm of rain once a month.  The other (by the
ocean) gets 2mm of rain every day.  Both these areas get 72 cm of
precipitation per year yet their climates will be quite different.

As a more extreme example most of Alaska North Slope gets very little
precipitation but permafrost less than a meter down stops this water
from getting away & most of its are is in fact wet.  So a subarctic
tundra can be a "swamp" during its (brief) summer.

In Traveller where the length of planetary days & years will vary this
can have a large impact on climate.  For example on planets with shorter
years the seasons will be shorteer & the climate will be less extreme.

Thanks, Rick, for reminding us of this.  Most of us probably do
play this way, changing what we need to change, ignoring stuff
that we feel doesn\'t work, and so on - but then we\'ll turn around
and debate the endless minuti of "canon", seeming to forget that
the books are like Egyptian traffic rules - pretty decent
suggestions, but by no means obligatory in the slightest...

You\'ve picked a good place to do this.  Most of us float ideas
here at one time or another; sometimes they provoke weeks of
discussion - on a list that sometimes emits half-a-dozen digests
per day.

I\'d also advise checking out some of the web sites of the people
who post here - many people will put their better ideas up on
them.  One good one (in my biased opinion - it\'s my site) is
Freelance Traveller (http://come.to/FreelanceTraveller) where I
have a section specifically set up for rules mods that people
have written - look for "Doing It My Way".  If you do a nice
writeup of your mods, I\'ll be happy to post them on that site as
well.

Thanks for the reply, Walt

That certainly provided a valid financial reason for the habit.  I had
the impression it was merely managers setting arbitrary dates ( which
is what we get in the software industry ).

I largely ignore any deadlines set by managers myself, as they rarely
check with the developers before they do it, and when they do they
don\'t like what we tell them, and don\'t take any notice of what you
say anway.

I suspected, ( given the behaviour of certain product line managers in
RPGS that have gained bad names on the net ) that this was a similar
situation.

Still, I suppose it\'s a lot easier to distribute software

I still stand by my statement that the book (and made for TV movie) were a
pathetic attempt to cash in on the new found popularity of D&D and
roleplaying games in general. I own the book, and the film and this is the
conclusion I had to come to.

I didn\'t know about this Dallas Egbert character until now. I\'m kind of glad
that you told me. Was there any proof that he really did go over the edge as
a result of D&D? Or was he already mentally ill to begin with? I\'ll have to
look this character up...

How will inducing a current on a conductor passing through a magnetic field

You\'d need one hua of a big magnetic field to reach across 1km, let alone
30000km (1 hex range)

I know MAD detectors are used to detect submarines and such, but they are
looking at anomalies in the earth\'s magnetic field caused by the presence of
the sub, not at a filed created by the sub... (please correct me if I am
wrong on this point).

This is the goal I was attempting to reach.  I felt that the
single-digit code was inadequate, and the extended profile that
DGP used was also inadequate in a different way, so I set out to
write something that would give a better picture of how the
government worked.  Fundamentally, most of the information will
be less than totally useful to the player/character (consider: to
the average tourist or business traveller, how important is the
difference between the representative democracy of the United
States and that of the United Kingdom?), but is a good base for,
say, RICE Paper information or severe detailing of a world.  When
coupled with the DGP notable customs, one can get a real "feel"
for a world, and this can give the referee what s/he needs to
make the world "real" to the players, instead of merely "Ho-hum,
let\'s do business at this cardboard cutout theocracy this week".

I\'d appreciate it if you and others would try plugging in your
various favorite "planets of the week", and seeing if that does
turn up any inadequacies; I would find it astonishing (improbable
or unbelievable would be more accurate) if something I wrote off
the top of my head, without significant experimentation or
planning, actually proved not to be flawed in some way.

Something that should be pretty universal would be "su madre"
("your mother")

You don\'t have to say anything else, everyone usually fills in
whatever they think you might say about their mother.

If you\'re talking about personal insults, anything derogatory to a
creature\'s sexual equipment or performance would probably be good.

I\'ve always found insults with big words are good, as the sort of
people you usually use them on are stupid, and don\'t know what the
words mean. They attack you anyway so they don\'t have to admit they
don\'t understand what you said.

Something like : "You micro-encephalic descendant of a copraphagic
flatworm" should do it.

True. But we do have "impossible" things in Traveller. Jump drive,
contragrav, and so on. 

What makes Traveller a hard science fiction game is that we try to examine
_all_ the implications of these technologies.

To use your example of a laptop computer, if our hypothetical predecessors
played an RPG that had laptops, but still had rooms full of clerks doing
sums, then it would fail the \'examine the implications\' test.

I would expect some counterpart of Bruce to point out that these laptop
gadgets could be combined with optical semaphores (then the latest in
communications technology) for long-distance transmission of pictures.
Eris\' remote ancestor would no doubt believe that not every laptop would
use the same commands. Michael might point out how manufacturing would be
changed by these new machines, while Bloo would explore the possibilities
of a laptop assisting lawyers in making cases and judges in trying them.

Over a decade ago, some of use in HIWG debated what Traveller cities would
look like, given cheap and plentiful contragrav. I\'ll post the results
tomorrow (out of online time today).

For a Vargr referring to them as "Lassie\'s lost love child" should do the trick. 
For an Aslan referring to them as the opposite gender would work well. A

I count at least four editions of D&D ( not including what _they_ call

plus several oither versions

The original beige books, AD&D first edition, AD&D second edition,
Basic D&D,

Then there\'s the second version of AD&D first edition (basically the
same as 1st edition but re-packaged and advertised in such a way that

Sure thing.

I was thinking about this, and there might be a minor grey area with the
system that you may or may not want to address: Perhaps you could add a
qualifier that describes how happy the citizens are, on average? Maybe just
a simple 1 to 10 scale (er, 1 to A scale) or something like that, with 1
being an extreme dystopia and A being a an extreme utopia. Granted, most
worlds would probably be in the middle of the scale, but still. It would add
a good deal of extra flavor.

If DGP already covered this in one of their books, I apologize. I don\'t own
any DGP books so I\'m not sure.

I don\'t doubt it. Strictly speaking, "free" can imply a lack of value (in
the broad spectrum of the word). It\'s so often that our media here in the
U.S. takes that literally ;^)

On the other hand, to ObTrav it, that\'s exactly what my Imperium is like.
When anybody and everybody can say whatever they want, everybody\'s theories
and opinions, no matter how backwards, have the exact same weight. People
with valid issues concerning the Imperium are quickly drowned out by those
with bizarre, lunatic, crackpot theories...

Of course, that might just be me :^)

Optional Rules for High Guard (Classic Traveller)

Introduction:

Ships in a fleet can provide missile defense support to each other,
at a reduced level from their abilities to defend themselves from
such attacks. The mechanism for this defense is dependent on
the current engagement range and the ability to assign ships to
escort duties.

While the engagement is at long range, both Area Point Defense
and Escorts may be used. At short range, only Escorts are effective.

Note that for purposes of these optional rules, "ship" can be taken to
mean starship, non-jump capable ship, or even any small craft.

Changes to Combat Sequence: The Escort Step

If using these optional rules, an additional step must be added to the
High Guard combat sequence: an Escort step. The Escort Step occurs
after determination of range, but before Combat.

During the Escort Step, ships are assigned Escorts. These Escorts will
be able to assist in the defense of their assigned ship. 

A ship may not be assigned to escort a ship with an Agility equal to or
higher than it\'s own, as it requires a maneuver advantage over the ship it
is protecting in order to escort it effectively. Emergency Agility should be 
included if necessary, for either the Escort or the ship being escorted - a ship breaking off with Emergency Agility may leave it\'s Escorts behind.
Note that a ship may elect during the Escort Step to voluntarily reduce it\'s 
Agility so Escorts can keep up with it.*

Effects of Escorts:

Escorts may decide, for each Repulsor, Laser Battery, or Energy Weapon
Battery, to assign it to defense of the escorted ship _instead of_ it\'s usual
self-defense or offensive role. If fired in this fashion, decrease the effective
factor of the battery by one for purposes of determining penetration. Treat
batteries with an effective factor less than one as factor one.
 
Area Point Defense:

While the engagement range is long, all ships in the fleet can use Area
Point Defense. Once all fire is declared, a commander has the option
of assigning any Laser Batteries, Energy Weapons or Repulsors from any 
ships in the fleet to defend against any missile attack. Batteries fired
offensively, fired in self-defense, or fired to protect an escorted ship (as
above) may _not_ be used for Area Point Defense. For any battery used in 
an Area Point Defense role, decrease the effective factor of the battery by 
three for purposes of determining penetration. Treat batteries with an
effective factor less than one as factor one.

- ----
* The design purpose of this rule is to prevent two (or five, or ten, or all
the ships in the fleet) from escorting each other. 

Notes on these optional rules:

I was reading some of the space combat sequences in David Weber\'s
entertaining Honor Harrington books, and the tactics described for
space combat got me to thinking - especially since in Honor
Harrington\'s universe, missiles are the shipkillers - a lot of interest
in applied to how they kill and how they are defended against.

Weber had a lot of point defense support going on, it got me wondering
what all these escorts in the Traveller universe were tagging along with
the fleet planned to do to protect the big ships they came with.

This makes perfect sense from what I know of our current missile
armed surface navies - there are ships specifically designed to kill
every missile around them, no matter which ship that missile is
aimed at.

I recall one Naval combat simulator, _Strike Fleet_ - the bad guys were
gunning for one of my spotting helicopters, I had it fly low over the fleet
so my Ticonderoga could shoot down the surface-to-air missile swarm
that was following it. I don\'t know how feasible this scenario would be,
but the idea of the chopper pilots buying every drink in the nearest port
for the Ticonderoga\'s fire control crew appealed to me. <G>

These rules give fighters yet another job to do - enough of them can
make enemy missile attacks on the ships you are willing to defend
much more difficult.

These rules limit point defense to defense against missile attack. To
my way of thinking, point defense versus lasers or energy weapons
would consist of shooting down the craft that\'s firing these weapons
at you.

Comments welcome.

Well, if my dog is any indication, the word "tyrant" could send vargr into a
blind rage. Seriously! If you say that word (only that word, no other word
like it) my dog goes into an insane fit. It would be funny if he wasn\'t so
terrified by it!

So, if you mention the word "tyrant" to a vargr that is in _any_ way related
to mine, he might react unpredictably ;^)

I\'d argue that the "right to bear arms" has _nothing_ to do with weaponry.
It is merely the right for a noble and his retinue to wear the livery, including the
"Arms" (as in "coat-of-arms") of the noble.

At least, that\'s how I\'d argue if I was Imperial Bodyguard Commander
and Dulinor tried to get past me to see Strephon wearing a sidearm, or
a high-law level planetary government trying to annoy or otherwise
deal with a stroppy noble.

A displacement ton of Hydrogen is approximately 14 cubic meters, the reason
13.5 m^3 was used was for mapping purposes, a map square on Traveller deck
plans were 1.5m x 1.5 m x 3 m tall.  This comes up to 6.75 m^2, thus 2 map
squares (13.5m^2) was called a displacement ton for mapping purposes, and
to simplify mapping, MT used that as the standard.

I\'m so happy to be actually discussing _Traveller_ on this list!  

<Hans>
>Somebody (I forget who, the digests just keep pouring in!),

That was me.
</Hans>

Hi Hans.  I should have gone back to check it, it was a good post, but
I unfortunately deleted it.  If you still have it around, please send me
it (charles@hebb.psych.mcgill.ca)

<Hans>
Why aren\'t they going further spinward instead? Lots of small single
worlds
there.
</Hans>

Ya, I mentioned that in my original post.  I realize there are some
problems with the Ihatei coming up to the Marches in GT, but given the
fact that they\'re there canonically (mentioned in BTC attacking Motmos(?)
and a couple of other places), I\'d like to come up with some plausible
reasons for it.  The problem of them not going Spinward is difficult to
explain without getting highly creative.  One might postulate that the map
represents the width of a galactic arm (or "sub-arm" or something) and
that stars thin out beyond the edge of the map, but I\'m not sure that fits
with canon.  Or you might say that they expanded in both directions, with
the more well-equipped coming coreward to capture the richer targets. 

<Hans>
Not quite. The first _ihatei_ reached the Marches around the end of the
6th
century. These would have been isolated groups, because today, 5 centuries
later, the Aslans are still only really established in the rimward half of
Trojan Reach. Since they are known to have been there at least 4 centuries
ago (the Glorious Empire was founded about then), this pose quite a
puzzler.
</Hans>

This is interesting.  Where\'s it from?  Solomani&Aslan? (I have to get a
copy of that!)  This largely gets rid of the problem of rapid expansion,
but now we have to come up with a reason why they were "dormant" for a few
centuries and are only now presenting a problem.

<Hans>
My own explanation is that shortly after the Civil War, the Imperium
instituted a policy of discouraging the Aslans from encroaching any
further
corewards than they were at the time  --  that is, about halfway up Trojan
Reach. This would explain the roughly 10-parsec band of neutral worlds
(which I call The Buffer Zone) between the Aslan and the Imperial worlds.
</Hans>

This explains why they stopped at that point, but why are they now getting
expansionistic all of a sudden?  I don\'t want to just throw up my hands
and say it doesn\'t make sense, I would like to find an explanation for the
canon.  

<Hans>
I\'ve tried to persuade Loren that they wouldn\'t and to cut down on the use
of Aslan _Ihatei_ in GT publications. I\'m anxiously awaiting the
publication
of GURPS:Mercs to see if I had any luck.
</Hans>

If my understanding of the state of things in TNE and GT is correct, they
have decreased the incursions of the Ihatei quite a bit in GT, but they\'re
still prevalent enough to require some sort of underlying motivation.  

<Hans>
Spaceships are expensive and it takes a large population base to send off
even a few people. If you try to work out something based on _Trillion
Credit Squadrons_ and allow the Aslans to spend a full 1% of GWP on
outfitting _ihatei_ (remember, 1% is what some people think is too much
for the full military budget of the Imperium), then they can export
between 1 and 2% of each generation.
</Hans>

1% might be too high for the Imperium, but the Aslan are a "warrior race"
whose major motivation in life is to gain land and hold it against others.
I think one could plausibly increase this percentage quite a bit.  What\'s
the US GNP percentage for military expenditures? (Let me guess, I\'m
opening up a whole other can of worms, right?  Please summarize the
arguments for me if you are so inclined) 

In saying that 1 to 2% of each generation could be sent off, do you mean 1
to 2% could be given a ship?  If so, this isn\'t a problem, since those
ones are going to need fighters and vassals to go with them.  

In any case, sending off 1 to 2% of the population might be enough if we
assume that only the upper-class Aslan sons are sent off in this way (the
lower classes being relegated to labor jobs and other "disgraceful"
pursuits).  If 25% of Aslan children are male, then you\'re sending off 5
to 10% of them.  Hmm, that doesn\'t seem like enough...


<Hans>
If each second son got an 800T cruiser the clan would be bankrupt.
</Hans>

Wow.  So where do all these 100K fleets come from?  Just a few very
wealthy clans?  Or are you saying it would only be a problem if it was a
new 800T cruiser?  Hmm, maybe you mean if all the second sons of all Aslan
males got one?  I meant all the upper class sons who have to go out and
prove themselves.  I picture the lower-class males going with the upper
class ones as fighting forces and potential vassals.

<Hans>
The significant word is \'relatively\'. I\'m not saying they wouldn\'t be able
to sneak in on some small backwater worlds if the Imperial Fleet was
distracted, but no world with significant system defenses of its own.
</Hans>

Oh, I\'m definately thinking they would be limited to worlds outside the
Imperium.  The BTC mentions an attack on a couple of Imperial worlds, but
these are quickly dealt with.  My picture of the Ihatei is that they\'re
grabbing up all the low-tech or low-pop worlds in the Trojan Reach, which
worries the Imperium, but not enough for them to risk great resources to
deal with it.  The idea of them posing a serious threat to Imperial
dominion over the domain of Deneb just doesn\'t work in the GT timeline. 
At best (or worst, depending on your point of view), they\'ll act as
another "raiding threat" like the Vargr.  More likely, they\'ll just
encroach uncomfortably on Imperial space without taking on the Marches in
any concerted way.  Hmm, I just had a thought: What would a Sixth Frontier
War with the Imperium facing a four-group Outworld Coalition be like?
They\'d be fighting on three fronts, with the Sword Worlder providing added
harassment.

<Hans>
Now think about those 13 subsectors a little. The Asalns first crossed the
Great Rift in -1044. That\'s more than two millenia ago. During those 21
centuries the number of _ihatei_ that crossed the rift PLUS the natural
population expansion of the early establishements has sufficed to cover
13 subsectors. Now, suddenly, they are supposed to cover another 8 in 3
</Hans>

Crap, this is all from Rats&Cats, right?  I have to get that book!

<Hans>
years. Am I the only one who think there\'s something wrong with that
picture?
</Hans>

No, you\'re not, but given that the canon contains it, I\'d like to come up
with an explanation that gives me peace of mind.  One thing I was
wondering:  When did the Aslan acquire Jump-5?  If it was relatively
recent then that could be a contributing factor to the sudden expansion.

<Hans>
Buy with what? Money isn\'t wealth unless you can convert it into goods, and
the transportation of goods across the Great Rift is subject to the same
problems that plague the transportation of _ihatei_.
</Hans>

I\'m not sure I understand what you\'re saying here, maybe I\'m just not
reading it right. If an Ihatei comes across the rift with his daddy\'s
credit card and orders up a couple of ships from an industrial world on
that side, why would the world refuse him? 

Okay, now on to Joe Webb\'s comments...

<Joe>
Aslan didn\'t rush over, they have been in the area of the Marches for
centuries.  They were in contact with the Zhodani hundreds of years ago,
and had a thriving trade in the Marches in the 500\'s (IIRC) with
Dustspice.
</Joe>

Okay, more stuff I was not aware of.  Like I said above, this deals with
some of the difficulties of "rapid expansion".

<Joe>
Aslan among the Darrians have provided that empire an elite corp for some
</Joe>

This I knew about, but always figured it was an Aslan "far expedition",
like the Solomani one that founded the Sword Worlds. 

<Joe>
In BtC the ihatie are described as \'inheriting nothing\' and as worthless
failures in the eyes of aslan society.  How does a bunch like this get
ahold of 10,000 dton cruisers and transports full of families?
</Joe>

Well, I\'m not sure "worthless failures" is used, is it?  I think they say
"outcasts", but there is a sense there that the second son has to prove
himself.  It\'s a "sink or swim" test of vitality and ambition.  As father
to a second son, you\'re motivated to give him some resources on the off
chance that he\'ll really make something of himself and add to your
land-base.  

This reminds me of an idea I learned in an Animal Bio class a few years
ago:  Generally male children are considered more \'risky\' than female
children.  Females are very likely to have at least some offspring, but
males often have none.  However, males will occasionally have very high
numbers (certain Sheiks come to mind).  This has led to the effect that
male children tend to be born more often in times of plenty and less in
times of stress (because you can afford to take the "long shot" when
resources are plentiful).  Perhaps the first sons are akin to females (but
don\'t tell them _I_ said that :-) and the second sons are akin to males? 
When resources are plentiful, you take more chances with the second sons. 
Perhaps an economic boom in the Heirate could explain the sudden upsurge
in Ihatei activity? 

<Joe>
Tthe ihatei problem in the Marches and Trojan Reach has been brewing for
some time.  It has reached critical mass in the late \'teens.  In TNE
timeline they had no organized Imperial resistance and overwhelmed the
Trojan Reach worlds (more on that below).  In the G:T timeline they are
meeting plenty of resistance.
</Joe>

If I\'m reading you right, you\'re saying that the Ihatei have been in the
Trojan Reach for some time, expanding slowly and have only recently gained
sufficient numbers/power to push into the Imperium.  IYTU, is there some
event that triggers their expansion?  

<Joe>
Without something better to do, they are going to hang around the clan
holdings, attempting to knock off the clan leader get his land.  It would
</Joe>

I\'m not sure I picture Aslan sons knocking off their superiors too often.
The Aslan are supposed to value loyalty to a great extent.  I think Aslan
would often refuse to follow a "leader by assassination" (though it of
course depends on politics, an unpopular leader taken out by a handsome
prince type might work).  Likewise, I\'m not sure an Ihatei killing the
leader of an opposing clan would get control of that clan\'s lands, he\'d
have to defeat it\'s military unless he could make some sort of political
coup as well to turn the people in his favor.

<Joe>
BTW there would be zero males in these transports.  Only females looking
for land owning husbands.  Why transport a bunch of rivals after you have
just risked your life fighting for this world, a place in society and a
big
harem?
</Joe>

No males?  But then where do your fighting forces come from? I think you
might bring in many males, giving them chunks of your world to take on as
your vassals.  Of course, the guys you brought with you initially would
have priority and you would only bring in others if there was room.  It
depends on how much rivalry one sees in Aslan society.  I think it\'s
mostly a pretty stable vassal system.  BTW, don\'t forget you\'re going to
start off with plenty of females on sight.  You need them as engineers
pilots and the like on your ships (males don\'t do tech jobs).

As for Tobia, I like your idea.  I think the Ihatei might take many worlds
this way, with promise of "fair treatment" in return for no violence. The
Ihatei gets put in as a figure-head, the government structures continue to
work pretty much as normal, the people of the planet don\'t have to fight
and die, and the Ihatei now "owns land", so he\'s happy too.  Plus he is
now entitled to full clan support, providing the world with better
defences against other nastier Ihatei who might come in and just bio-nuke
you off the surface.

Wow, that got long!  But like I said, it\'s nice to be talking about
Traveller for once instead of various irrelevencies...

F=GmM/r2 gives the force, F, due to gravity (G is the gravitational
constant: 6.67E-11 (Nm^2/kg))

F=ma, right? a is acceleration, in this case g is usually used (why
I write 6gs instead of 6Gs, but I digress :-)

g = GmM/mr^2 =GM/r^2  You need the radius of the world, r, and the
mass in kilos.

Earth is around 6E24kgs, Jupiter is more like 2E27kgs.

For traveller purposes we need to get from UWP to mass. Earth\'s
density is about 5.5, Jupiter is 1.3, Saturn is 0.7, Uranus is 1.25,
Neptune is something like 1.7. You can use the radius from various
traveller books for UWP code, then plug that sucker into 2/3*(Pi)r^3
to get the volume, and you know a ball park density (~5 for rocks
like earth, something like 1 for Gas Giants). Then work it out from
there.

And how badly does it hang when a player doesn\'t respond?

And what does the player have to do to get their actions interpreted
correctly?  It seems to me that Out Of Character comments to the GM
that help clarify in game actions might be a big hurdle.

It\'s a game.

If the rule wasn\'t there, a player would surely argue that because the
rules don\'t prohibit it, you _can_ be pregnant multiple times.

That\'s how I see it.  The upper class males are the leaders and the lower

The term "client states" comes to mind.  The Imperium is very interested in
what happens outside its borders, particularly to its allies.  It\'s quite
likely that there are a lot of subsidies and mercenaries heading rimward in
GT.  In some cases, there might even be Imperial ships.  The Joes might
even be interested in what happens to Pa\'an, their formerly lost colony in
Trojan Reach.  Joe patrol ships where going there in CT Adventure 4:
Leviathan.

All this actually has great adventure potential, IMHO.

Ihatei fleets are how clans extend their holdings.

Thank\'s Jeff, a perfect  solution !

It will annoy the gearheads though, they\'ll want to know how to design
a referee now !

You\'ll also need a spreadsheet for designing said referee,
 preferably compatible with FF&S2 and Striker ) and another
correlating location, damage, time and date, that a "referee" can be
plugged into in order to solve the equation.

I\'m not sure if someone else already posted this to the list or not: Keep in
mind Microsoft only bought FASA Interactive, not the whole company, lock
stock and barrel. From what I understand, this is the segment of FASA that
made those nifty combat simulators for use in arcades... er... interactive
gaming centers.

As far as I know, this doesn\'t extend to the previous Battletech inspired
games (which were put out by Activision a good while back). Activision lost
the license for them years ago.

This has very little to do with your post directly. I\'ve seen a number of
people concerned that Microsoft would destroy FASA\'s pen and paper product
line.

One point that is being overlooked is that the Kzin telepath
confirmed for its Captain that these humans had *no* weapons, and in
the minds of the humans they didn\'t.  So, the Kzin didn\'t expect
anything leaving their ship open to a point blank attack.  It was a
"leap of imagination" driven by desperation by one of the humans
(the misfit who was always in trouble, if I remember correctly) to
think of using the reaction drive (and I think it was a laser) to
carve up the Kzin.

It\'s been a *long* time since I read the "Known Universe" stories,
but as I remember, the idea of war (and aggression in most any form)
was being bred out of humanity by the world government in the name
of peace.  A few misfits, Beowolf Shaffer was one of them if I\'m not
mistaken, still had these evil, anti-social, aggressive tendencies,
but were being slowly rounded up and "cured" for humanity\'s own
good.  After it became clear the universe *was* filled with red claw
and fang it took several generations to breed aggression back into
humans.  ;->

And you know we shouldn\'t tell those that haven\'t read the stories
too much about the slavers, the pak and the protectors.  Those were

Acually, it wasn\'t a drive, it was a communications laser.
And the Kzin weren\'t that stupid.

They had their telepath scan the human\'s minds to determine whether
the ship was armed. None of the humans considered the comms laser a
weapon because weapons had been outlawed by the ARM ages ago.

Therefore, the Kzin thought they were dealing with an unarmed ship,
but the Kzin Captain didn\'t believe it, and the Kzin still played
safe. Finally the Captain was convinced the ship was unarned because
no-one who had a weapon could act the way human ship acted, so he
decided to take the ship intact.

When one of the huiman crew figured out they were all going to die, he
realized that he could use the comms laser as weapon, the Kzin were
sitting ducks, fully convinced the ship was unarmed and about to
surrender.

Technically, by ARM, and therefore Human, standards at the time, the
crewmember who thought of this was verging on the sociopathic just for
thinking of it.

Shaffer came later, after the Kzin wars.  Violent tendencies were not being weeded out.
But for the curious, the world gov was wiping out all references to military and war.
mentally ill people who would think violent thoughts were constantly treated.

I did like the idea of organ leggers, folks who stole people for their
organs. Of course this lead to organ banks that were legal.  The punishment
for almost every crime (including the equivilant of traffic tickets) became
being sent to the organ banks.

Yeah; but your country at least still considers military history a legitimate
intellectual persuit. Here in the states; they are pushing really left wing
(no flames; I\'m really a moderate - I swear) cultural history. Most history
professors think that those who study military history are automatically
militarists...The few colleges that offer it are losing it as the professors
retire (ex. Gunther Rothenburg) and the chairs are eliminated. I had to major
in generic American and European history with no military history at all. This
bias filters down to the secondary and primary school teachers (American
teaching colleges are even more left wing...) who consider gaming as VERY
anti-social (except for the enlightened teachers on this list)...:-) ). This
combined with the conservative right\'s (there I insulted them too...:-) )
hatred of D+D\'s "devil worship" make it very frustrating to run wargaming
(even when we call it "adventure gaming") in the public schools...

Ob Trav: cultural and political "wars" between left and right wing
Ideologues...? Hard to use in adventuring unless it gets really interesting
(civil war, or at least political "dirty tricks" that need the PC\'s touch...)

Isn\'t that a contradiction in terms ?

My recruit course, a girl got herself slugged out for rotating to be
_almost_ in line with the other cadets on the range whilst saying
"Sarge, it didn\'t go off ?"

Before she could revolve to a danger point, a corporal GSI slugged her
while the sergeant grabbed the gun and forced it back down the range,
before carrying out the standard misfire drill.

I believe she later tried to bring a charge of sexual harrasment.

"Left wing" here means liberal, I suspect.  I\'ve played RPGs and boardgames
with Trotskyists.  I saw a Stalinist in my local games store yesterday! 
They consider military history a legitimate topic of study - ie they
study it.  So apparently did Marx, Engels and Trotsky!  They might have
objected to a "rah rah rah" version of history, however.

Let\'s see... Should I give you the short or the long version?

I\'ll give you the long version, since I tend to run at the mouth a bit and
if I try a short version it\'ll just get long.

In My Traveller Universe:

In my version of the Imperium politics are vastly important, even if they
are invisible to the PCs during specific adventures. Different planets have
different agendas. Different subsectors may have different agendas.
Different sectors may have different agendas. Not all of these agendas jibe
with the Imperial status quo.

The Imperium, as a whole, is not the Empire from Star Wars, it\'s not about
evil or subjugation, or removal of free will. The Imperium is about turning
a profit, the profit is for the nobles, the megacorporations, and the
planets involved. If a tyrant runs a planet and lets his people starve and
live in poverty, that\'s fine, as long as the tyrant doesn\'t interfere with
interstellar trade. Needless to say, that means that the Imperium is hardly
a truly stellar example of individual freedoms or even handed rule!

There are "leftists," and they range from the benign (trying to change the
system from within) to the malevolent (actively working to bring the
Imperium down as quickly as possible). I invented, and mentioned, the
Brotherhood of the Rorani for an article I wrote on a Daibei/Vilani singing
sensation. The Brotherhood of the Rorani would be seen as a watchdog group,
something along the lines of Amnesty International. There are others, like
the Ine Givar and the Rule of Terra that wish to overthrow the Imperium.
They have their own agendas and their own methods, and sometimes they even
work together. Then, I have other groups, that would act (sort of like
Greenpeace) to intercede and take down specific nasty and brutal regimes on
specific worlds. They may be wide-eyed idealists teaching the citizens about
non-violent revolt, or they may be active commando groups funded by
megacorporations for their own ends. Of course, they may be wide-eyed
idealist commandos, or megacorporate funded teachers of non-violent revolt.

Actually, that brings us to megacorporations. Not all of these massive
companies are created evil... er, EQUAL. Some branches may be cut from the
same mold as Weyland-Yutani ("the Company" from Alien), big, huge,
impersonal and ruthless. On the other hand, some may be more along the lines
of Rizome (the company from Sterling\'s "Islands in the Net"), with a policy
of economic democracy and leftist leanings. Maybe a nicer megacorp may
intervene on behalf of the citizens of a world. Of course, there may be
other reasons, and they may _look_ like they\'re intervening on behalf of the
citizens.

Finally, you\'ve got the folks who don\'t think that the Zhodani are really
all that bad. They feel that the loss of life on both sides has simply been
way too much and it\'s got to stop. Of course, these people are a little
irked about the "standard" line in Imperial history books about what bad,
bad, people the Zhodani are. The same thing could be said about the
Solomani, as well, to a lesser extent (I intimated that in the post I made a
long time ago about the holovid "Tom Jetland: High Passage")...  And so it
goes.

So, anyway, what does this all have to do with your question? Basically, the
full realm of politics (and then some) exists in my Traveller universe. The
detractors of the status quo have some really valid points. Should they ever
get their hands on the full realm of information concerning the Psionics
suppression, well, that\'s the Imperial equivilant of the Kennedy
assassination information here in the United States, the mother of all
conspiracies. Should the citizens of the Imperium find out about the
psychohistorical plot, well, the entire regime would likely come down around
Strephon\'s ears (I play in the classic Traveller timeline, IY 1107 to be
exact).

The real kicker is that the pro-Imperial types have a valid point as well.
We\'ve all seen the MT stuff, we know what would happen if the Imperium split
apart!

So my basic answer is, yes, there are cultural and political "wars" between
left and right wing  types. Even though "left" and "right" may not have the
same meanings to the average Imperial citizen, or may not have the same
meanings to citizens from Core and citizens from the Spinward Marches.

Then, of course, over top of it all is the Imperial media, but don\'t get me
started on them, I could be typing all night (and actually I\'m very tired).

   What\'s the typical native vegetation near Anchorage like?
I don\'t know what your mean temperature is like; I\'m guessing
cold temperate with taiga (evergreen needle-leaved forest).
"Arid" doesn\'t necessarily mean "desert".

   Spend a rainy season in the tropics and you\'ll come to a whole
new understanding of "damp". <g> As a source of water, snow is
inferior to rain. First, you have to get several inches of snow
for every inch of rainfall. Second, it\'s solid and blocks the
sunlight. Third, it\'s cold, which inhibits life\'s chemical
reactions. Fourth, it has to melt before it\'s usable. Fifth, it
concentrates the water from precipitation at one part of the
growing season, instead of evenly distributing it.
   The colder the average temperature and thus the slower the
evaporation, the more likely it is that you will find "wet soil"
communities even in arid zones. As you observe, the tundra in
summertime is an example.

   The tables are based on RW vegetation, and they take this and
many other random factors into account already by giving more
than one biome for each zone of temperature and precipitation.

  These biomes grade into one another. Just for an example,
tundra might look a lot like barrens in the winter under a few
feet of snow and ice. Go up north where there is mostly bare
rock, less lichen, and even less grass, and you have have a hard
time telling it from arctic-alpine desert. Turn summer when the
snow melts but permafrost prevents drainage, and it might look
and act a lot like a bog, which in turn might look a lot like its
warmer cousin marsh, as you observed. Go down south where it gets
pretty luxuriant and find evergreen trees like juniper or
whatever, and you start to wonder where to draw the line between
tundra and taiga.

   The tables I posted (Adapted from Encyclopedia Britannica,
"Biosphere" article, to give credit where credit is due) are
intended to give a world designer a clue about what kind of
vegetation to put where without requiring him to be an expert in
ecology and climatology. They also give some freedom to vary the
scenery without doing violence to the laws of nature.

You probably should then. Be forewarned, as far as the background, there\'s
not a good deal that you don\'t already know if you own the MT: Imperial
Encyclopedia, or the Library Data supplements.

Other than that, it\'s pretty solid.

A load of pompous nonsense, but true.

Equally "relevant" to Traveller, but more amusing:

"There is only one God!
 He is a Sun God!
 Ra! Ra! Ra!"

I don\'t answer for Greenpeace, but I suspect they would deny what you wrote
about them!

Incidentally, I was one of the people that introduced "non-violent revolt"
as an alternative to minority putsches (look it up in your dictionary, damn
it!).  I don\'t necessarily see such revolts as "non-violent", just as not
necessarily being the same as guerilla wars/terrorism.

All hunky-dory in my book.  Oberlindes Lines, IMTU, is a candidate
Megacorp.  It\'s still hooked to the free trader crowd.

I\'m also looking for copies of articles related to Traveller which
appeared in White Dwarf and Space Gamer.  I say "copies" in the legal
sense which allows libraries (in the United States, your local legal
system may vary) to photocopy articles from a magazine upon request
for patrons of other libraries.  Unfortunately, I have yet to find
a library which saved any issues of these magazines.

I used to collect the articles and then pass the magazines on to my
other gaming friends, like the fool I was in high school...

The same would go for articles in "The VIP of Gaming" and "Far & Away",
but I suspect those will be more rare.

Note:  I\'m not a wealthy man.  If you\'re hoping to make serious $$$
from my situation, you won\'t.

I\'m writing up a planet, with a sulpher compound trace in the atmosphear.
I assume that an easy way to filter the compunds out would be to pass the
air through water   to produce solphuric acid. Is this right ?

Sulpher taint would also mean that the seas were realy weak acid, and if I
remember my chemistry lessons, all you need to do to remove the acid is
add metal, but there must be less expensive way to do it, distilling ?

So to live, you pass the air through tainted water, to get good air, and
then distil the result to get pure water with a bi product of sulphuric
acid.

This must be good for some sort of industry, but what ? Metal refining ?

Any suggetions or corrections would be appreciated.

Thanks

We have *our* fundamentalists, too.

Fortunately they have close to zero influence in politics or anywhere else.

I mean, we are a nationed founded by *convicts* ... not a nation founded by
religious zealots (I dunno, which is worse?). Gee, even my paternal great-great
several times grandfather was sent out as a "guest of her majesty"

Actually, Mel is a yank. He migrated here with his family when quite young,
married a local girl (years later, of course), did his training here, but always
kept his US citizenship.

So, technically speaking, he\'s a Yank who lives (or, more accurately, *lived*)
in Oz.

Got it in one.

Typical native vegetation in Anchorage varies based on soil & altitude,
but climax vegetation is black spruce & scrub in areas with wet soil;
white spruce in areas with dryer soil; and mixed deciduous in non climax
areas (cottonwood, birch & alder).  Most of the Anchorage basin was
wetlands before developers went landfill happy in the past 50 years.  A
good portion of our fir trees are dying from spruce bark beetle
infestation & its likely that the vegetation will be mostly decidous in
less than fouty years. The Anchorage basin is alluvial terrain
surrounded by mountains on two sides & inlets [fjords really] on the
other two.

Mean annual temperature (30 year average) is 37.3 F [2.3 C].  [This
reflects some warming in the last 5 to 10 years, the 80 year average is
more like 35 F [1.7 C]].  The few areas in town that used to have
permafrost are loosing it.

We have about 60 clear days a year, 65 that are partly cloudy, and about
240 that are cloudy.  We have about 40 days per year where we get more
than 0.1" [2.5mm] of precipitaion.  We get about 72 inches [180 cm] a
year of snow, which melts down to about 6 [15cm] inches of water.
Typical July high temperatures are 62 F [17 C] & typical January lows
are 11 F [-12C].  Yearly record temperatures might be 77 F [25C] and
- -15 F [-26C].  All time [80 years] records are probably about 90F
[32 F] and -40F [-40C].

And you always do that is why precipitaion is measured based on what the

No snow insulates the ground & stops heat loss.  It also creates a micro
climate for small animals where the temperature is just below freezing,
instead of much colder.  Their isn\'t much sunlight in the winter anyway 
[5 hours 20 minutes at the winter solstice, about an hour more today] &
it\'s probably cloudy anyway.

This seems to be a bit of a chicken & egg comment, if it was not cold it
would not be snowing.  It is true that snow makes things colder but that
is because of its high albedo.

Yes and it is a lot likely to get lost in the meantime, sublimation of
snow is less than evaporation of rain.

No what it does is take winter precipitaion, which would otherwise be
wasted, and move it to the spring.  It takes weeks to soak into the
ground & those are the weeks the trees need to bud leaves in.

The tables were quite good & I do not mean to criticize them but i just

My recruit course, a girl got herself slugged out for rotating to be
_almost_ in line with the other cadets on the range whilst saying
"Sarge, it didn\'t go off ?"

Before she could revolve to a danger point, a corporal GSI slugged her
while the sergeant grabbed the gun and forced it back down the range,
before carrying out the standard misfire drill.

I believe she later tried to bring a charge of sexual harrasment.

I don\'t disagree about the book attempting to cash in on a recent news story.
I never saw the movie version, so I won\'t comment on it. As for the quality of it--
I make my hobby money by freelance proofreading, and you haven\'t seen pathetic

The more-or-less full story of Egbert and the investigation into his disappearance
can be found in a book called _The Dungeonmaster_ written by the private investigator
brought in to the case by his parents.  I can\'t think of the guy\'s name at the moment,
but that ought to be enough to winkle the info out of the Library of Congress
online catalog or wherever.  The short version is that, no, it didn\'t have anything
to do with D&D.

I just think this sort of information is important in establishing the state
of Traveller in the late 90s and whether it has a future in the 21st
century. I wouldn\'t be surprised to find that the majority of people on the
mailing list are over 25 years and have been playing the game for over ten
years. Perhaps we should do a survey of the list membership?

It doesn\'t. If a player doesn\'t submit a turn for play - they\'re ignored.
The main game engine runs through a queue of player turns processing turns
in a particular order. If in this situation a player didn\'t respond, they\'d
simply still be left in the same position they were in, whilst the rest of
the world moved on. Just like in real life.

> And what does the player have to do to get their actions interpreted

It uses a simple but effective parser and command system. You nominate each
character that wants to perform an action. For every action that you try to
perform, you issue a command, and the target of that command. This either
uses code, or labels (names for objects), or a mix. Our parser can
differentiate between the two.

So to have character A (Jenn) in your party dock the ship at Hibernian
Station (Station 12), the command could be:

	A	Dock Ship	Station 12

		or
	Jenn	Dock Ship	Hibernian Station

It looks a little like disjointed English, but the essentials of the command
are the same as \'Jenn docks the ship at Hibernian Station\'. In a normal
roleplaying situation, a GM may make the player roll piloting skill to see
if Jenn is successful (our GOD program does the same) or might decide that
the station\'s automated docking procedures may kick in (our GOD does the
same). Then player interaction may ensue before the finally docking sequence
is complete (our GOD does the same).

Out of character comments can be handle by including messages through the
Out Of Game Message system to the GM. However the command system is designed
to handle almost every situation that occurs. Of course having a human
moderate the game would help, but would also slow down the processing or
results depending on factors.

Point understood. This is one of the long-running arguments in PBM/PBeM
circles - why pay for games when you can get games for free. The answer
always comes back to the same reason why you\'d gladly take the local bus or
purchase a new car with all the latest trimmings. It comes down to wants,
needs, interest and features. There are a lot of good games out there (I
play some myself) but quality of features, gameplay and continuous
development tends to be more greater in commercially developed systems.
Especially in computer-moderated games.

The point is that whenever you play in a roleplaying game, you can strip the
language down to some base elements. Disregarding the emotional,
psychological and physical state of your character, when you\'re being
attacked by 15 Vargr all carrying heavy weapons, for you to return fire you
still have to do the following:

1) Choose your targets
2) Fire your weapon at your targets

So you could tell your GM \'I\'m going to shoot at the lead Vargr\'. At base
essentials, you\'ve using a more involved system for roleplaying that still
relies on an underlying \'command system\' - shoot weapon at target. You\'ve
nominated your target, you\'ve nominated your action. You\'ve passed
parameters to the GM about what you want to do.

With computer moderation of any PBM/PBeM game you have to create a simple
interface for you to operate in the real world. Even Baldur\'s Gate and
Ultima Online rely on this. But our system allows you to perform most of the
actions that you would in a normal roleplaying by using an easy to
understand command system. You\'re still using language, just not as complex
as a human GM would be used to. But it is an effective bridge between
roleplaying and PBM.

Besides how many human GMs could handle 1000 players playing 100s of
different missions scenarios at the same time and have all the players
interacting with each other in some way in a few minutes processing time ?

So do I. And we\'re not going down the Ultima Online road. The game software
that allows you do play Ultima Online is limiting is some ways - there\'s no
true player interaction and roleplaying, just defined situations that can
occur within the parameters of the gameworld, with information passed from
the player interface to allow particular actions. When are updates issued,
do they develop more actions for you to accomplish in the gameworld, are the
NPCs continually developed, can each game be customised to suit the players
?

What we are doing is not what you perceive to be computer moderated
\'role-playing\' as these games have come to be known in the software
industry. All the gameplay is run by a single game administrator/master on
their own computer network. Turns with player actions are submitted to the
GM who then inputs them so that the main computer program that moderates the
game can process the information. The GOD program then processes the turns
and updates all the game data, including player data and world data. The GM
then prints out the results and sends them to individual players. Players
can either read these results as a straight text report incorporating their
characters stats, or load them into a special client front-end that reads
and writes turns for the game and also acts like an advanced character sheet
with lots of paper holding background information ?

My sources in the industry have confirmed that it\'s only the Interactive
(computer game) line that\'s been sold. The pen and paper line is safe as far
as we make out.

Besides, I\'d hate to play BattleTech 2002 (with all new MS Agent Mechs that
cave a cute cat that tells you how to operate the Mech itself. What the hell
do you do when you delete the help files by accident ?!) with Service Pack
5, connected to Roleplayer Explorer v10 and integrated to Direct Dice D1000.
The game would crash more often than a drunk blindfolded player character
piloting a shuttle backwards through an asteroid field when his skill rating
in piloting is only slightly better than 0.

Scary thought.

	Actually,  I wouldn\'t recommend GT unless you really want to play using the

a real Traveller version being out there.  To me, without a Traveller-style

	I think that sourcebooks like BtC and StarMercs (hope, hope, drool, drool)
may be just as useful for real Traveller and that\'s why I don\'t dread SJG.
But,  we need real Traveller! That\'s what I want to play!

The Galactic People\'s Party, a leftist organization, that was ostensibly a
multi-world political party but was in fact a terrorist conspiracy funded by
several pocket empires who were oppossed to Imperial expansion.   I think that
leftists-Marxists are the ideal enemies of the Third Imperium--I mean it
represents everything they hate,  Big Corporations and rulership by a
hereditary land-owning caste.  So my players ended up blowing up alot of
hippies for the sake of Cleon by the end.

I am not questioning your sources but, a number of things make the me
question this:-

1) I think I would rather be encumbered than face an army of sword wielding
Englishmen with my wedding tackle dangling ripe to be chopped off. The kilt
is made of heavy plaid and would probably do a reasonably good job of
weakening any blow. Also, remember they were fighting English troops who
would probably be wearing light chainmail. They would be as encumbered if
not more.

2) The weather in Scotland is not exactly the best in the world. Anyone
running about without their kilt or trousers for that matter would probably
catch their death of cold. And I am sure an Scotsman back then would rather
die by the cold steel of an Englishman\'s sword than lying sniffling on their
bed.

I had heard that when required to move quickly and on forced marches they
would remove their kilts. But, this then raises the question of what they
did with them? If they carried them, surely they would still be as
encumbered?

James Dallas Egbert was a 16 year old genius who went to Michigan State
University in East Lansing, MI. His dissapearance came about when he went to
Texas, partially to get away from the pressures of school and partially
because of a situation involving his sexuality. This dissaperance was linked
to D&D when the private investigator who was trying to find him discovered
that a.) he played D&D, b.) some of the students played "Live-action" D&D in
the steam tunnels beneath campus and c.) he has been in the steam tunnels.
The theory was that he had gotten trapped down there and died. That theory
was played up by the national media; when he was found it was discovered
that his vanishing act had nothing to do with D&D, this fact was
conveinently ignored by the media. After his return, he later committed
suicide. Again, this had nothing to do with D&D, but this event (IMO) linked
D&D and suicide in the minds of the public. James Dallas Egbert was a
troubled young man and his death was a tragedy, but it had nothing to do
with D&D.

In a bizzare addendum, I met Egbert at Rider\'s Hobby Shop in E. Lansing in
1979; I had just started gaming and was there to buy my Player\'s Handbook.
This was shortly before his dissapearance, and I recall we talked about one
of his characters briefly. I didn\'t know who he was until I saw his picture
in the paper.

ObTrav: nothing, really...

2300 AD just solved the problem by allowing the colonists to inhale a
bacteria which lived in the lungs.  It ate sulphur from the air as it was
breathed. Or something like that.

Of course once you left the planet, you had to be reinfected before you

Actually, I was thinking of inducing a current in the leads
to existing speakers on the target ship.  I figure that it
would take a lot less power to vibrate some speakers than
to rattle a whole ship.

As to magnetic fields and their ranges, is there any
precedent for powerful manipulation of forces?  Perhaps
a modified grav-plate can serve to channel/focus a
truly heinous magnetic field that could be used.

Anyway, it sounds more plausible than the previous attempt.

type spacecraft ever created?)

Well I\'m 20 and been playing Traveller since the reliease of TNE in
Sweden (I was 15-16 at the time). I was probably born a gearhead and 
love the setting. It was really FFS that made me go out and buy the 
books.

I don\'t play Traveller much now as my RP-group is spread all around the 
country due to studies, military service and so on..

I\'ll be 36 in March.

I wish I was under 25, the number of years I\'ve played Traveller under 
the age of 25 is exceeded by the number of years I\'ve played Traveller 
25 or over.  But I can say now that I\'ve played the game over half my 
life  :)  having started at age 17.

In response to the "role playing in high school" question.  My school 
only had a policy concerning "live action" roleplaying.  They did NOT 
like the Assassin game we used to run, but they didn\'t mind us playing 
D&D or Traveller.

Remember how in World War II, the Germans designed their fighters to 
emit some sort of "whine" that had a very demoralizing effect on the 
victims of their attacks?  (This is also the reason behind the whine you 
hear from Imperial TIE fighters in Star Wars).  When humans are alone at 
night and hear the howl of wolves in the distance, it tends to strike 
fear and apprehension.

Perhaps the Vargr know this of humans and howl accordingly to demoralize 
humans when they attack.

Just a thought.

One motto we had when we played Traveller in high school was "never call 
a Vargr doggie".

There is an article in "The Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society, #9" 
(yes from way back in 1981) called "Epithets of the Fifth Frontier War" 
that is a hoot to read.  Allow me to exerpt:

Things to call the Zhodani:  "dirty, stinking zho", "psike".
Things to call the Vargr:  "snarl", "barkers", "doggie".
Things to call the Sword Worlders:  you only need omit the expected 
title "Sir" from any dealings with them (no offense to Sword Worlder).
Things to call the Imperials:  "deadhead" (lack of psionic training), 
"pinkie" (lack of fur), "outworlder".

Admittedly these are very mild by today\'s standards, but if you call a 
Vargr "doggie", he\'ll drop his plasma gun and go for the throat!

Me for one, I\'m a 22 year old computer tech who has heard about traveller for
years, and I own a few T4 books, but I didn\'t really get intrested in traveller
until I tried Jovain Chronicles on my gaming group (which they didn\'t like or
couldn\'t get into), The general feel amoung my group is that being "trapped" (as
they put it) in a single star system is too limiting.  So I purchased several T4
books and ran a short campagin over the course of one summer untill half the
players had to return to college.

I was intresting for me, I could almost feel the sense of history while reading
the T4 books and I tried to instill that in my players (who are all younger than
me by anywhere from 1 to 5 years).
The thing I really liked about T4 was the character creation system.  Almost all
aspects of the character can be randomized.  I know a lot of people don\'t like
that, but I find it great for when you burned out of character ideas.

I think what scared alot of people away was the deadline: One to two
months!  That\'s pretty damn tight in my book.  I know a lot of folks who
have published gaming books and supplements (PLUG: Buy Heavy Gear!  It

One of my great lottery fantasies involves buying the rights to publish T5
and doing it right.  One of the things I would do (if I had the money) was
pay off Imperium\'s outstanding contracts to encourage good writers to
return to the fold.  Another thing I\'d make sure to do would be to offer
some sort of rebate for owners of T4 materials when the T5 equivilant came
out.. say if you mail order FF3, you get 20% off if you include the title
page from FFS2.

We didn\'t win last night, so this won\'t happen this week..  :P

You.. you COWBOYS FAN!!! 

sorry, that\'s the worst thing I can call someone in real-life :P

In Lunion, calling someone "Sanvinur" (SW for "true friend") is a real
insult, as it implies much the same thing as "fellow traveller" did in the
American 50s.. you\'re a traitor to our way of life.  Depending on the level
of anti-SW feelings on a planet, just suggesting that peace is possible
might get you labeled a sanvinur.

"Mind-raper" or "rapist" is common derogatory slang for anyone suspected of
being psionic.

While not the worst, saying "ah, he must be from Lunion" is code for this
person is dull, anal-rententive, and has no sense of humor.

Whatever you used would induce a current in _all_ conductors, not just
speakers. Which would pretty  well knock out the electronics and jam the
sensors, so if it could be shielded against then designers would shield,
which means that it wouldn\'t work on most ships.

Now, if such a weapons can exist it would make a dandy pirate weapon,
because the pirates could \'stun\' a ship by disrupting its electronics, and
then capture it while it is dead in space. (This is one reason I would
assume all ships would shield against induced currents. Another is that
passing near a gass giant will induce some pretty large voltages, which a
sensible designer would shield against too.)

  It\'s true the GT core book doesn\'t contain much new stuff, but I\'m a
total junkie for well-made RPG books, and this is one. I don\'t regret
buying GT for a second.

  It\'s interesting, how much peoples\' tastes in game mechanics differ. I
would personally never referee or play a game, that didn\'t allow the
players more or less total control over the generation of their
characters. (This is why I always felt the T4 character gen. system was a
70\'s backdrop, that had no place in a game published in the ninties.)

  I\'d be interested to know if this preference for CT-style random
character generation is prevelant on the TML. Are there any others like
me, who prefer a GURPS / WoD style point based generation? Please
enlighten me.

  BtC is certainly useful for anyone running a Marches campaingn. (At
least I haven\'t seen capsule writeups of every single world in the sector
in any other source.) StarMercs looks promising, and if the Far Trader
supplement delivers what it promises (see SJG web page for a description)
it might just be the best thing done for Traveller in years.

  I await T5 with interest, and will probably buy it when it comes out.
Meanwhile, i\'m going to continue buying every GT book I can get my sticky
fingers on. (Being a junkie is not friendly for one\'s budget.)

Personally, I don\'t like point based systems.  Perhaps I am a holdover from
"the good ol\' days", but my major gripe with point based systems is two
fold:  First, when you boil things down, all characters are equal.  True,
some have penalties, but when you total everything up, the points are the
same.  This leads into the second reason which is that soon characters
becom maximized for the role they are to be used in and the more
experienced player will usually have a more powerful or useful character
than the less experienced player will.

For me, the best system was MT, where you had the randomness of the die
roll, but also had the ability to modify the roll with the brownie points.

Just my opinion, YMMV.

Assuming you know which one is the leader.  More realistically, its
Shoot the one that looks like he is leading, shoot the tallest one, the
closest one, the one with the meanest looking gun, shoot over their heads
and command them to put their guns down, hornswoggle them by pretending
to be their superiors, telling them to look out for the Aslan Ihatei behind
them, throw a nice juciy steak and run, etc, etc.

Leaving the player in the same position is precisely the problem.
If you\'ve got a fire fight going on, in a real PBeM, there comes
a time when the GM will need to step in and control the character
of the player for the sake of gameplay so that everyone can move
forward.

So who creates the goals and handles NPCs?  You need a human GM for that.

Your software sounds like it might make a great GM aid, but nothing I\'ve
heard suggests to me that it will or can take over effectively.

Best of luck though.

Actually, neutrino sensors can be used with a *lot* of computer help to
do scans of planets and smaller bodies. Densitometers will detect
secret rooms and compartments unless they are a *lot* broader focused
than I think they are. After all, a hidden room or compartment is one
hell of a density variation.

Just keep in mind that we are *already* up against some inherent limits
on this sort of thing. Between atmospheric turbulence and diffraction
limits on optics, last I heard was that a KH-11 or equivalent (1 meter
or so optics, 100 miles up) could identify a licence plate (by colors
and position), but not *read* one. 

So IDing indivuals will have to rely on something other than their
faces. But IDing *troops* should be easier. I don\'t see it being any
easier for the 3I.

Please note that at Earth\'s distance from the sun, you get something
like 1 kW per square meter of solar energy. At 24% effiency, that means
that you get 240 kW from that thousand square meters of panels. That
won\'t power much of a rail gun. 

The solar power stations that will produce *gigawatts* of power have
arrays *kilometers* on a side. 

And even then, it\'s quite possible that the arrays will be of
*mirrors*, focusing heat onto piping carrying some liquid (possibly
sodium or mercury) which will then be used to run a turbine. A heat
engine operating at those temps is likely to be *more* efficient than
solar cells. Also, a lot cheaper.

But the Topaz reactors didn\'t have much shielding. They were intended
for unmanned satellites. The also stick out like a sore thimb. Between
the leaking gamma rays, and the termal radiation, they are a big "shoot
me" sign.

Shielding is *heavy*. For a manned unit, one solution would be to put
the reactor at the end of a *long* boom, and just place shielding such
that the station is in the "shadow" of the shielding. 

Only trouble with shadow shielding is that you have to stay in the
shadow when approaching the station. It works a lot better for a power
plant intended for an interplanetary ship.

Slight problem. The impact energy is equal to the power input *minus*
both losses in the gun *and* losses due to air resistance. 

There are also limits on the acceleration, mostly due to materials
strength. I\'ve attended talks by folks who worked on them at Lawrence
Livermore labs. They had to quit using metal projectile because the
metal would *flow* under its own "weight". And then jam in the rails...

But a rail gun that is effective against something *other* than
thin-skinned aircraft or missiles is gonna take a *lot* of power.

Ammo is actually fairly light. Since the damage depends on KE (.5MV^2)
velocity is more important than mass. 

a 1 gram BB at 10,000 m/s is better than a 10 gram bullet at 1000 m/s.

I spent two years at a high school that had a pipe band. I enjoy the
pipes, but even I wasn\'t thrilled the day I got picked help re-arrange
some stuff backstage in the auditorium while the new members of the
pipe band practiced. A newbie on just a chanter can make fingernails on
a blackboard seem *nice*.

Also, pipe is "confined spaces" can get rather intense. I recall
listening to *one* piper in a fair sized tavern and it was almost
unbearably loud...

Ever hear *real* "war pipes"? With the *huge* drones, deliberately out
of tune with each other....

The only way to "detect temperature" without direct contact is to use
the IR radiation given off by the object. The peak frequency of such
radiation depends on temperature. The *amount* (brightness) depends on
both how hot something is and how *much* of it is at that temp. 

So both items work on IR. It\'s just that one merely picks up a "band"
of IR wavelengths, and reports the intensity as a gray scale. 

The other tries to scan *several*, narrower bands, and assigns colors
based on which bands have a signal, and brightness based on intensity
of the signal in the various bands. 

So they are *both* IR. And they both detect "thermal" radiation (which
is just another name for IR). 

But the "false color" displays require multi-spectral detectors and a
bit more processing.

Supposedly, it wasn\'t all that uncommon (in the old days) to discard
the kilt and charge in wearing just your shirt (which, btw, was
fastened between your legs so as to form a sort of "underwear"). 

But charing into battle *naked* wasn\'t at all unheard of. Berserkers
(Bare-sarker) tended to do that sort of thing.

Ok, gravity is *acceleration* rather than force. So the equation is:

A = GM/R^2.

A in meters/sec
GM see above
R in meters

So either plug in the figures from the above, or else use the Traveller
shortcut formulae:

Gs=K*D/8
Gs = surface gravity in gees
K  = density of planet (Earth = 1.0)
D  = planetary size from the UPP

M=K*(D/8)^3
M  = mass (Earth\'s mass = 1)
K  = density of planet (Earth = 1.0)
D  = planetary size from the UPP

Well, certainly.  But I\'m also reasonably certain that you wouldn\'t paint
yourself blue and rush headlong into a sword fight.  But when in Glasgow . . .

Its not that tough.  Especially against edged weapons and spears.
Now if it were made of silk, certainly you\'d want to wear it, as the
Mongols did, because it makes taking an arrow out of your body
much easier because the silk would conform to the shape of the
arrow head.  But that isn\'t the case here.

Wet chainmail isn\'t much heavier than dry chainmail.  Where wet tartan plaid,
and the quantity we\'re talking about, would be a major hindrance.  We\'re not
talking about the simple kilt and spooran arrangement you see today, but the
lengthy cloth wrapped around and around the waist and shoulder.  You take the
chainmail, I\'ll take the freedom of movement and the fear I\'d instill,
especially
since you\'ve been hearing bagpipes for days that have set your teeth on edge
as they play all through the night, after marching through rough terrain.

Also, we\'re talking long before there was an England to speak of.
Pre-1000 AD.

Its only for the duration of the fight, and you don\'t catch a cold based on how
much skin you have exposed to the elements.

I never heard that and it doesn\'t make any sence to me, unless
chafing was an issue.

No choice there.  Toledo is like 70 miles from Detroit/Windsor.  If we get a bit burnt out playing Traveller for a week straight, we can always go hit the casinos in Windsor.

Or, if we get *too* bored, we can always go down to the lake & watch the fish die.

Hmm..

It\'s central, has great meaning to Traveller fans, and should be cheap.

Since TravellerCon will probably be under a hundred folks (drawing upon the
wife\'s experiences with Callahanicon), things like function space aren\'t
really a concern.

Which is why I suggested using GenCon.  Let TSR/Andon/WOTC pay for the

I was merely drawing parallels between the active, stunt heavy Greenpeace
folks, and the 3I revolutionaries I have created. It\'s more along the lines
of the activity level that I\'m drawing a parallel with, not the activity
itself.

When I was saying non-violent revolt I truly _meant_ non-violent revolt, ala
Martin Luther King (among others). I was just trying to describe that the
_full range_ of human activities goes on in my 3I. That\'s all :^)

I admit to being \'mid-40s\' someplace, been playing since \'78.

IMTU, a laser hit on a vessel will always rock the vessel slightly. 
After all, there is an outburst of kinetic energy as the hit section of 
hull metal explodes from such heat. If the fuel tanks were struck, the

Has anyone considered the east coast for a TravellerCon.
Say Reading PA.

Costs are lower and very easy to get to by car, bus , plane, and soon train.
Philly a major east coast city is only 45 mins to an hour away.

Think about it.

points. I thought I\'d jump into this debate.

One statement that was made was that point based systems produce characters
that are more or less equal. This is one of the greatest strengths of this
kind of system, IMO. If all the characters are at roughly the same level of
ability it not only cuts down on players resenting those with "better"
characters, but it makes adventures easier to plan and balance as well.

As for characters being "optimized", that can happen in any game system,
random creation or not. I saw it happen a lot in AD&D over the years. if a
player feels he needs to have an \'edge\' over the other players, he\'ll find a
way to get it. It is the job of the GM, not the game system, to prevent
this. GURPS does have some built-in safeguards to prevent this kind of
thing, but there are ways around it. In the final analysis, my experience in
almost 20 years of gaming is that players are happier when the character
matches their conception of what they want to play. I can remember being
really frustrated when rolling up Traveller characters, when I wanted to
play a hotshot pilot and got stuck with yet another Marine who got mustered
out after one term. I won\'t deny that creating characters for CT and the
later incarnations can be fun, but I like the Quick Generation options I see
in the T5 draft, and will likely be using those.

In the final analysis, we all go with what we enjoy. There is no right or
wrong way to go about it.

Actually I realize this very well, shipping costs and signing customs
sheets for game items. I actuall started the tagline as a jab at the
fact that the biggest organized fan support network active in Traveller
today ISN\'T in the country where Traveller was created. It certainly
wasn\'t meant to offend our neighbors to the north. That and the fact
that NATS sounds better than "USTS"

Appologies for any offense and if it is a problem let me know and I\'ll
drop the tag line! There\'s been enough hard feelings on the list lately!

No I\'m not.  I\'m keeping in mind that Pak starting tech is way low compaired 
to human tech.  For instance a \'true line\' Pak wouldn\'t know about advanced 
computers.  Why build a machine that processes information just as good as a 
Pak can?  This means, no Jump drives for them until they *do* capture some 
human tech.

Remember, the Pak had only ramscoop ships.  Brennan blew one up by domping a 
heavy element (boron gas, I think it was) into its scoop field in a 
semicontained stasis chanber where it fused up into the transuranics and blew 
out the scoop.  You take out their scoops, you *have* them.  And they\'re only 
4 or 5 G accelleration due to them not having gravitic compensaters.

You\'re forgetting that humans have advanced computer technology at their 
disposal.  Feed the info into a TL15 expert system, and it\'ll give you 
detailed plans on how to sucker them every time.

*IF* they can.  Remember all those \'piracy is impossible\' posts?  Well, they

I\'m definitely your polar opposite, then.  I\'d rather decide the
character for the player to use (tournament style) than let them make
their own.  Allowing players to generate the character under my direct
supervision would be second choice.  I have a habit of giving the most
experienced players the most challenging characters, while giving the
newbies someone straight-forward and powerful, like a ship
owner/captain or a burly marine.  It makes for a fun game when a
powerful newbie is attempting rash actions while the well-rounded
players run around trying to keep the adventure from falling down
around their ears.  Bull in a china shop, and all that.  It counters
typecasting and court-holding, too.

There ARE a lot more options. I was just citing a breakdown of a particular
action. In the execution of that action there are obviously a lot more
factors and pathways for the development of the execution of that action.

A lot of these options are available. But to perform these above actions,
you still have to pass more parameters than just \'fire your weapon at the
target\'. You have to nominate your target, or perform another action
(telling them to look behind).

The complexity is still the same, just the communication medium changes.
It\'s like playing a game with a Frenchman, a Spaniard and an Italian, all of
whom know some English but not to the extent that you do. You can still
communicate the ideas, just the sentence structure changes to eliminate
errors in communication. (Apologies to any French, Spanish or Italian
members of the list, who are generally much better at speaking foreign
languages than those of us in the UK - my hats off to you. You have my
respect).

Because some people like that level of complexity. More to the point, it\'s
how a real econo-social system operates. Millions of small actions
controlling the destinies of other actions.

If the player was caught in a combat situation the combat would be resolved
and players wouldn\'t just be left high and dry. The software does something
pretty much the same. There are a lot of factors that are taken into account
for every situation that the game engine encounters.

It\'s a completely different game from a PBeM freeform or rules-based RPG
game. It\'s more an RPG/interactive fiction/storytelling system.

That\'s not moderation of game rules. That\'s development of game world, which
although most of it is self-regulating, there is need for human creative
skills. Which is what the administrators of the game do - they set up all
the missions and other gameworld data from all the possible combinations.
The NPCs are controlled by the computer software after being set up - they
have their own drives, needs and ambitions, which the software uses to make
them interact with all the players, PC and NPC in the game.

That\'s because I\'m not giving out too many details. It\'s not even a GM Aid -
as it controls all the aspects of the game world and process results and
doesn\'t just aid the GM in the execution of thank.

Why not wait until it\'s available and then try it - you may like it ...

My town has a used up nuke plant that we are remodeling into an
amusement park.  The Mass.\'s throng here!  Don\'t tell me that six
hours of bumper-to-bumper (each way) would keep you from seeing a
great site like that?


ObTrav: In the New Era, are there any tour agencies that take
curiousity seekers to ruined centers of technology as if they were the
dino exhibit at the Peabody Museum?

Actually, I like the idea of allowing antimatter powerplants in GT. If we
assume antimatter powerplants have a higher crew requirement than fusion
plants at G:T tech levels, then fusion will be far cheaper for starships
and canon will be unchanged.

Even if you let antimatter be cheaper to operate, powerplants in G:T are
sealed units so the game effect of having antimatter-power starships will
be nil.

Hey, it sounds good to me, since Philadelphia is home for me. Being a
student on limited funds, this is a more realistic option for me personally.
However, the logistics of such a thing are truly daunting. If the people on
this list are serious about it, I\'ll look into seeing if I can get a
location for free or very low cost. What kind of location would be needed?
We don\'t need a convetion center or anything, right? Something like a hall?

He specifically said, "for you to return fire".  He probably could have
spent the rest of his life outlining every possible outcome, but I fear even
then you would have come up with another option, just so you could piss and
moan.

Because you\'re talking about how many systems and because more players means
more variability and more variability means more realism.  Kinda the old

In Traveller, ships have used artificial gravity for centuries without
interfering with jump drives. YTU could use "Jump floating" (switching off
artificial gravity when initiating jump), but this is not canon.

The notion that the second ship is inside the other ship\'s "10 diameter
limit" is also problematic since every ship is obviously inside its own
diameter, and this ruling would make canon jump drives impossible. IMTU,
the jump limit is caused by a gravity gradient, not intensity, and things
like ships do not produce a sufficient gradient at any distance.

over a year.  But in Traveller thats hardly enough time to jump back 
and forth to another system let alone a long trip.

I figure most enlisted and NCO\'s would get the above form of 
vacation not counting shore leave.  Officers on the other hand may 
actually get leave of absents for up to a year maybe more if there is 
no major conflict, with the condition that they are on a recall 
standing.

This is my opinion:
Traveller is a role playing game that the referee can do anythign he 
wants to.Some people get stuck on rules: this can\'t happen because of 
this, that or whatever. I have had a two players who have left my games 
because I didn\'t folow the standardized rules set forth in the 
Traveller-Bible-rulebook.

IMTU, as a referee, I do whatever I want to the players. My entire goal 
as a referee is for everyone to have a really enjoyable session, and my 
players never have a complaint. (Well, at least I haven\'t heard any, and 
one of them is on this mailing list, so I might get some unexpected 
feedback here.)
:)
Remember the most important things are:
1. Whatever decisions you make as a referee, stay consistant. Make sure 
if the players know something is considered a constant, then stick to 
it. This can be real science (which is easier to remember than alot of 
pseudo-science), and totally off the wall "magical technology".

2. The entire goal is to have fun. As a gamemaster, you are a host. You 
create the realm for the players to enjoy. Just make sure to try to tune 
into the desires of the players and mold your designs and adventures 
into what they tend to like. It will often stretch your imagination as 
well.

If you want a gizmo or a gadget in your game, then make one up. Try to 
use hard science when you can, but there is nothing wrong with 
experimental equipment that noone understands.

The primary rule of all RPG\'s is to have fun.

Well, one thing you could use as a reference is Andrew Akins\' FF&S2
spreadsheet (version 3.2).  That would give you just about all the
values you\'re looking for, rolled up in a spreadsheet you can use (in
several formats, including Excel 5, Excel 97, and Quattro Pro 8.0).  You
can download it from:

http://www.truserve.com/~igor/traveller/frames/index.htm

Alternately <plug>, you can download the Akins spreadsheet (Excel 5),
with the data for my TUSCALOOSA-class heavy cruiser, from my Web site
(see address in my sig file). </plug>

When I said that it was possible that Loren had a change of heart for one
reason or another, that\'s kind of what I meant. Maybe there\'s a major flaw
that would drive folks away from antimatter and to fusion?

Let me get out G:Vehicles and see what the truth of the matter is. At GTL 11
(Traveller TL 14) antimatter reactors first become available. A fusion
reactor at this TL weighs (0.2 x kilowatt) + 2000 pounds, while an
antimatter reactor weighs (0.1 x kilowatt) + 4000 pounds. A fusion plant
will weigh a little under a ton less than an antimatter plant with the same
output. At really high outputs they\'ll get closer and closer together. At
GTL 12 (TTL 15), however, there is no change in fusion plants while
antimatter reactors dip down to (0.05 x kilowatt) + 2000 pounds.

Fusion plants at GTL 11 cost $25 per pound, while antimatter plants cost
only $20 per pound. Minimum cost for both is $20,000. The reactor cores have
an extra cost for both, GTL 11: fusion $100,000... antimatter $200,000. GTL
12: antimatter $100,000

Where the big difference comes in is the price and frequency of refueling.
Fusion plants run for 200 years on their fuel, while antimatter runs for 2.5
years at GTL 11, and 5 years from GTL 12 on up. It costs nothing to refuel
the fusion plant (it runs on hydrogen), while fuel for an antimatter plant
costs $1,000 per gram. One gram makes it run for 2.5 or 5 years, depending
on GTL of the plant. Antimatter bays (for storing extra fuel) cost $500 per
gram of antimatter stored, have a volume of 0.5 cubic feet and weigh 50
pounds at GTL 12 (double that at GTL 11).

So where do all those numbers put us?

Let\'s see. With a fusion drive on a ship, you know you\'re going to run for
200 years on a full tank of hydrogen. You can get hydrogen cheaply anywhere.
At GTL 12, a fusion drive is going to weigh less and be a bit cheaper.
However, in order to be able to run for 200 years, you\'d need to pump a good
deal of money into containment tanks for your antimatter, and a fair amount
of weight. That would be an extra $10,000 for the containment, and an extra
half ton. Further, you\'re going to have to find a planet that manufactures
antimatter fuel if you need a refill. It\'s not that hard to make antimatter,
we\'ve been able to do it since the 30s (if my science is correct). However,
there may not be enough profit in it until higher TLs. If refuelling is
chancy, well... nobody\'s going to use it in ships.

Will liquid hydrogen explode if it is hit by enemy fire? I suspect that if
your antimatter containment unit is breached, then you\'re in for a pretty
big explosion. That might be something of a limiting factor.

In any case, you can use antimatter as it is in the GURPS universe, which
doesn\'t really give enough of an advantage to put fusion plant manufactories
out of business. You can move the GTL of antimatter plants up one level,
which would mean at TTL 15 (GTL 12) you\'d have a technology that wouldn\'t be
able to really compete with fusion drives. You could move it up 2 levels,
which would mean it would become available only in the future of the
Imperium.

You can also up the price considerably (a factor of two would be enough, but
if you really want to go crazy, a factor of ten would make antimatter a
really ugly option for shipbuilders to consider). Or you can do any
combination of these ideas! Hell, you could even move antimatter to GTL8 and
put fusion out of business before it really gets off the ground. It is YTU
after all! ;^)

The above is a typical "Clif" reply to a recent post.  It\'s getting to
be a regular thing.  Since we don\'t know Clif\'s parents phone number,
and therefore can\'t ask them to correct their youngster\'s behavior,
what say we just give this NPC a cyber-spanking and jettison his
carcas into jump space?  Nah, on second thought, the caca-mouth would
probably enjoy it!

OTOH, I wouldn\'t expect the level of personnel turbulence one finds in,
for instance, the US military.  Personnel would tend to enlist, serve,
and retire in the same unit in the Imperial military.  Thus, there would
be less need to travel to take leave, as your immediate family is
probably living nearby.

Imperial Navy vessels, and Imperial Marine units, would probably operate
in a fashion generally similar to the way USN and USMC units do today. 
They would spend several months on a cruise, then return for some time
to their home port.  The home port time would be used for such things as
military schools, ship refits, and leave.  In addition, shore leave at
various ports of call would be an option.

I wouldn\'t think that a policy of putting officers on leave for extended
periods of time would be a good one.  Taking the officers out of their
units in such a fashion would hurt unit cohesion (it\'s harder to develop
teamwork when the person who is expected to lead a unit isn\'t there, and
won\'t be there until the balloon goes up).

One way you can involve active duty military characters in adventures is
to assign them to duties outside regular line units.  For instance,
personnel assigned as advisors to reserve or planetary force units would
likely have more time available to adventure, as might recruiters and
military/naval attaches.

I agree with the concept of a support organization (that\'s why I joined
BITS). It\'s just that I\'m _not_ a Yank, so your tagline eliminates me.
(And probably those proud Texans, too, come to that.) Possibly you could
widen the scope...?

(And I\'m not offended - I saw the smiley, and I\'m known you long enough to
know that you are making a joke. But we _have_ recently seen some people
assuming that US laws apply to the rest of the world, so I decided to
respond.)

What I\'m looking for, though, is a word for the description of the citizens

Folks, I\'d heartly suggest *everyone* ignore this individual. He\'s a troll.

ObTrav: From a design standpoint, a lot of Aslan equipment as depicted seems
to me to be less than efficient. Are they a race that places aesthetics
higher than functionality? For example, would an Aslan ACR have all kinds of
flutes and ridges, or would it be of a more workmanlike design? [I\'m trying
to draw some images of Aslan and I am wanting to develop some ideas.] In a
lot of cases using the most efficient form for an object (an air/raft, for
example) will make objects of the same function (other air/rafts) look
pretty similar, regardless of the species of the builder. Would an Aslan
designer take this into account, and, for example, build a vehicle that is
less streamlined than a human one based only on aesthetic principal? Or
would they be satisfied with just an Aslan-style paint job and grillwork?

On a related note, how would you describe the Aslan aesthetic sense, in
words? Do you envision them as having a unified cultural sense, or as having
a more diverse set of aesthetics (i.e. abstract expressionism v.
neo-classicism, etc.)

With Loren\'s encouragement I submitted a proposal for just the Aslan

doing just the K\'Kree that would suit me... ;-)

I got home from holiday yesterday and haven\'t had time to read this

Walt,

Are you quietly beavering away on High Guard 3rd Edition? I really like
this stuff - combined with the recent posts on logistics (and possibly with
some minor mods bringing back 10 dt bays, sticking in a fusion drive

Very nice, and simple, set of rules.

I know what you mean. In my case it would be bye bye social life until it
was delivered, which would have taken a negotiation with my wife.... well,
I offered the money I made on it to her for the Purple iMac she wants and
things eased up a bit.

Anyway, in discussions with one of the potential authors I agreed someone
else was better placed to do it than me. <sigh>

One tertiary industry that we decided we would found on Tavonni is the
provision of conferences for sector-wide organisations - organisations that
span the Spinward Marches. We reasoned that the Marches are big, but there
is still enough need for F2F meetings that there should be a market for
these conferences - especially if you market yourself as providing a
central, neutral meeting place, with high-tech (TL 15) security and
defences, and fast J6 courier transport.

[Adventure Hook: PC\'s are hired by some company as personal bodyguards.]

That\'s why the "Welcome to Tavonni" marketing publication touts Tavonni as
"the centre of the Marches" - it means this figuratively (Piccadilly Circus
- - everyone comes here) as well as literally.

Of course, this is an ADVERTISING slogan, and we all know how true _they_
are...

Ok, well the line worked in at least your case Rob (i.e. it got some one
to talk about the situation). Now, how can we expand the support here in
North America (not the US, not Canada, all of North America!). Is
something like NATS viable, either as a "chapter" of BITS or as a
stand-alone organization? Would people be willing to join, support such
an organization (one dedicated to supporting Traveller, say by running
games at conventions or even local stores)? What type of organization
should it be? 

Anyone want to talk about this or am I just wasting bandwidth? If so
tell me to drop it and I will.

As for playing pipes over radio channels etc. this is actually done in one

Regarding the MS takeover of FASA it was actually FASA Interactive which has
been bought which produced the more recent computer games and produced the
Battletech arcade games. FASA itself is still independent and has plans for
their game universes.

Plus, it makes training excercises about as close to the real thing as you can

IMTU, Aslan military equipment, combat vehicles, and other male dominated
stuff is all _highly_ artistic. Scientific equipment and stuff designed to
be used by females tends to be much more workmanlike.

It\'s not that Aslan women don\'t like or appreciate art, they just aren\'t
overwhelmed by the need to have everything in sight decorated and touched
up.

Even imperialized Aslan would tend to decorate their own weapons with little
aesthetic touches, IMHO.

I hadn\'t really thought long and hard on the differing _styles_ of Aslan
art, but I don\'t doubt that such a thing might be the case. Perhaps each
clan might have a certain aesthetic vision that is compatible with( but not
exactly like) the visions of other clans. It\'s a start.

No problem, I\'m highly interested in this line of reasoning. If we can
manage to squeeze out a few books (ala BITS) Traveller would only be the
better for it!

I think the advantage (and I may have missed some posts here) would be
that NATS (or whatever) as a partner with BITS would allow for joint
creation of
products (which actually isn\'t a problem now), but more importantly,
joint publication and distribution.  Not sure how it would impact the
BITS/SJG
deal that is pending.

I think its vital that they be related organizations both to avoid working
at
cross purposes, as well as to cross-polinate ideas and reach critical
mass on developing products.

Actually I think just the opposite. THe Rebellion source book and
several other source show art work depicting the Aslan ships as highly
streamlined, more like clusters of teardrop shapes. This indicates to me
a bent toward the aesthetic. I\'ve always pictured the Aslan as having
more "hand worked" equipment than your average Imperial would. Artwork
showing the ornate staffs carried by some Aslan, etc., are probably
highly customized weapons. This would seem to fall in line with the
"pride" of male Aslan, kind of an effort to "show-off". 

As Chris said in another post, the females probably tend more toward
"business-like" equipment. They are probably still more ornate and
individual than a factory produced Imperial item for the same use.

I would believe that each clan has some differences within a general
racial preference. Kind of like the differences seen in Celtic artwork
through areas of Europe. Cross fertilization would make them similar but
close examinations would show up subtle differences.

Not higher than functionality, but more important than in contemporary
NorAm.

Think Swedish design philosophy, where looks and aesthetics are considered
during product design instead of being tacked on afterwards. (Not that
Aslan equipment _looks_ Swedish, but the philosophy is similar.)

So, their ACRs are just as good as Imperial ones, but more decorated. The
fluting wouldn\'t interfere with functionality.

<shrug>  Artistic license on the part of the cinematographer?  What rule is there that war flicks *MUST* be true to life?  There is none.

The corollary, of course, is that one should *not* rely on movies targetted for mainstream audiences as primary source material.

game.

A "24 hour" policy was thrown about.  Its not what I would call a policy
but a part of self-discipline.  It is a very good concept.  It is like 
"count to 10 when you are mad" kind of thing.  If you wait 24 hours, and go
back and re-read it when you are less emotional you will most likely respond
in a more rational and less emotional manner.   I recommend that everyone 
follow this concept.  In face to face conversation, we are forced to civilty
by the fact that other person can bust our noses.  With e-mail and chat, you
are out of reach of the other guy and you have to take responsibility for 
your words that your bodies laws of self-preservation do in face to face
talks.

Ii thank the list for above average discipline level!!!!  Lets not let
these few incidents start a trend!!!

Thanks

IMTU, Aslan military equipment, combat vehicles, and other male dominated
stuff is all _highly_ artistic. Scientific equipment and stuff designed to
be used by females tends to be much more workmanlike.
</Chris Seamans>

Ya, I definately like this idea of a gender dichotomy in artistic tastes.
Goes well with the overall theme of the Aslan.  

As for equipment being "ornate", one thing to consider is that intra-Aslan
battles are often highly-staged things with lots of rules and rituals, so
there\'s more room for ornate equipment.  For instance, if two Aslan lords
decide to settle their differences with a medeival-style battle on an open
field, cammo is not going to help anyone much and they might as well wear
their "pride colors"  to raise morale.  Also, if there\'s a rule against
sniping officers in your war, they can wear fancy uniforms.  Then you can
get into standard bearers, games of "steal the flag" and all sorts of cool
looking stuff.  You could even extend this to space battles:  "No shooting
the standard-bearer ships" means they can have outlandish color schemes
and broadcast powerful radio messages to inspire troops or taunt enemies
("Your mother was a Terran and your Father smelled of Uffleberries" :-). 

Mind you, they are smart fighters, so when they go up against Imperials
and (especially) Solomani, and they know rules won\'t necessarily be
respected, they\'re likely going to go with efficient and plain stuff. Even
in this case though, it doesn\'t decrease your combat efficiency much to
have a rifle that has some esthetic appeal.  Consider 19th century
weapons:  Usually nicely made, not cold and angular like today\'s weapons. 
They could have made them blocky and chunky, but since it didn\'t affect
performance one way or the other, they went with the aesthetic option.

Steve,

Understand, this has NOT been discussed with BITS! I agree that a close
relationship must be developed so that duplicate efforts etc. not become
a problem (but then again a bit of competiotion never hurts either!).
Other than a few knock off messages on other lists, this is my idea, for
which I take total blame. If there is enough interest then BITS could be
approached to see if some official relationship could be worked out.

In reference to books or other publications, much the same applies. I am
"wildcatting" on this. I have no idea if Marc would grant publishing
permissions. I\'m assuming that if a NATS type organization could be
formed a portion of any dues would go to trying to secure such rights
from Marc, as well as (maybe?) compensation for some or all articles in
a news letter (e-zine format or paper?). I really like the IG idea of a
"Citizens of the Imperium", admittedly they screwed it up, but a fan
organization COULD provide some of the same things (with permission from
Marc!)

Let see, resources... I\'ve said before my wife works in the graphic arts
field. I personally have contacts in printing, screen printing, and
embrodering (hats, jackets, etc.), I belive someone else on the list was
talking about this before as well. Bloo knows the law. Others have
skills and contacts. I really don\'t see how some type of organization
with hats, tee shirts or jackets moving around a game convention
COULDN\'T create some type of interest! From what I\'ve seen there are
people on this list from all over North America (I DO know about those
outside of NA! I\'m somewhat narrowing the scope for this converation,
and do NOT mean to slight or insult those people, Please accept my
appology in advance!)

Then there are store front games. With enough interest from a creative
group like this list a couple of easy "Con-type" advertures run in a
game or book storemight get us all some of that "new blood" we here so
much about. Who knows may be some of those card players might get
interested?

I generally only download TML about once a week. So imagine my suprise when I
downloaded my messages, and was skimming through them...and finding things
spiraling down further and further, until the tone of the messages were things
like:

"The howl is in a LASER, jerk-off! "

Now, folks, is this really necessary?

Let\'s (first off) try to stick to the topic at hand. The topic at hand is
Traveller, in it\'s various forms. If you want to talk about Texas leaving the
US, fine, make it relevant. If you want to talk about religion, fine, but make
it relevant.

OTHERWISE TAKE IT OFF THE LIST!

This is a list about Traveller. Some of this pay for our online time. And I,
for one, am getting pretty sick and tired of having to edit out all this non
relevant crap.

Second, can we try to attain a level of civility on this list? Think of these
people as your friends. Would you call your friend a "jerk-off" (or worse, and
there has been some wosrse of late)? Even if you can\'t think of them as your
friends, think of them as colleagues, colleagues in the vast Traveller
collective.

And if you can\'t even make that stretch, try this. If you were in the room
with these people and you were discussing something as mundane as a game,
would you call them a jerk-off to their face?

Folks, it\'s a game. As serious as I take it (and I\'ve been playing with this
stuff since 1977), I have never--never--gotten so angry over a game to call
somebody some of the names that have been thrown on this list.

So, please. If you\'d like to argue, take it off the list. If you\'d like to
discuss US government conspiracies, please take it off the list. If you like
to bash religions, or politics, or Bill Clinton, or Newt Gingrich, or Prince
Charles, or WHOEVER. Take it off the list. If you\'d like to bash one list
member TAKE IT OFF THE LIST!

Now, could we please get back to idle speculation as to when Marc will get T5
published?

Hmm.  How could the K\'kree be integrated with Imperial settings?  They\'re a
long way away from the SM and Sollie Rim?

This, and the fact I didn\'t have my books around, I was busy and I\'m
bone-idle was really why I didn\'t put my proposal in.

I could crank up my proposal again.  I\'m not currently working on a
contract, so I\'ve got a month or two I could spend on it full-time.  Anyone
with Really solid GURPS skills out there?  I\'m still a little marginal.

May be not higher functionality but perhaps a higher degree of
reliability? Greater care in the design and production generaly tends
that way. That\'s one of the reasons I picture them as being more
"hand-made" or at least hand modified.

The distinction is, I think, that males that _remain_ landless are worthless
failures. Young males yet gone\'a-viking\' are probably not held in such contempt.

The reason that they are given these huge ships is a) their eventual
landholdings reflect on the prestige of their clan, and b) it get\'s them the
heck away from plotting to take the land back home. Remember the Ihatei was a
concept that the Aslan came up with to end the endless cycles of internecine
war and fratricide that characterized their pre-space history.

Who said that? The firstborn get the landholdings and prestige. They
themselves might be more than willing to finance ihatei expeditions, just too
get their younger sibs off planet. \'Uneasy rests the head\', and all that.

The other problem I have here is that everyone\'s assuming that the Aslan are
taking over via military conquests...They actually have a strong disincentive
not to...those ships become the way the next wave of Ihatei get shoved out of
the nest. 

I could very easily see Aslan Males seeing the (figurehead) post of \'Boss of
the Corporation\' as a way of showing off his warrior skill...he gets to play
macho, \'Barbarians at the Gate\' type corp games. Of course, the female
\'underlings\' make sure he doesn\'t have any _real_ business decision role,
merely the swaggering Boss show. He gets to go off an helm the corporate yacht
in the races, fly ballons around the world, rescue his employees from
religious fanatics or revolutionaries, that sort of thing.

(any similarity to real-world corporate executives is not quite coincidental ;-)

  What was wrong with TTA? I\'ve skimmed it, but not yet had the chance

  FWIW, the Atlas of the Imperium had at least one advantage over FS - 
the info (what little there was) was correct, AFAIK, and it did you allow
you to design your own sub-sectors with stats of your devising, but with
system placement to support traffic in material to be developed later.

Hmmm... This is an interesting idea, but I don\'t think it\'s
really part of the _government_ profile.  If I ever work up one
for population, it would fit in well there.

I\'m not sure, however, that the characterizations of the extremes
as *topi is really appropriate; they\'ll have some "objective"
connotations that may not really apply.

However, starting from the idea of "popular happiness", I may add
a section on "popular support" - something which is quite
appropriate for a government profile, and may be related to
happiness, but is in fact distinct.  Thanks for the idea.

DGP\'s _World_Builder\'s_Handbook_ was the starting point for my

Piper\'s "Space Viking" was the starting point for Marc to develop
Traveller.

I assume you are within travel distance of a library?  Fine.  Go look up a
book entitled "Six Armies in Normandy."  Author forgotten at this point.
It mentions Scot and canadian units bringing pipers in as early as the
second wave at Gold and Juno beaches.  For a better look at the war in
general, read Eisenhower\'s "Crusade in Europe".

As for your second point.. you do realize that both "The Longest Day" and
the opening sequence of "Saving Private Ryan" are both based on the actual
D-Day landings on 6 June 1944, right?  The landings on Omaha beach (as
portrayed in SPR) were by far the most difficult, with high bluffs all
around the landing area and well prepared German troops.  So of course both
movies draw from the same source, the actual events of what was termed by
many vets "the longest day" of the war.

  A friend ran into something vaguely similar in his (prison guard) intake -

IMTU, Imperial Navy and Marine personnel can request leaves of abscense
from their unit if they need it.  These leaves can be quite lengthy, up to
several years to allow for necessary travel.  The SM will be expected to
report on what he did during his LOA, and will still be subject to Military
Law while on leave.

This is based on the Victorian preactise of keeping good officers with
wanderlust active by allowing them to go off and prospect for gold or
whatever.. by keeping them on the muster roles, it extended the Empire.

Imperial Army units are stationed on their homeworlds, so the leave issue
is handled by more conventional means.  FYI, soldiers in the modern US Army
get 30 days leave a year.

	The Traveller character generation system with its randomization I think is
really a springboard for role-playing--since you have to work with what you

can have some serious baggage and an attitude problem  (failed hopes and

	Besides,  generating a character is actually a game in and of itself!  It\'s
just plain fun.  It\'s more fun to have to "try" to make the character you
dream of rather than "calculate"  how to do it.

IMTU, the Marines wear maroon berets as a node to their oldest antecedents,
the 82nd Airborne.  All marines have a field beret that the stuff into a
carrying pouch and change into as soon as the DZ is secure enough to allow
removing ther helmet.  Marine mess-dress does include a kilt.

Back when AHL was released, my group realized that battleaxes and
battledress were the best way of capturign a starship. (Great penetration,
and no nasty equipment damage when you miss!)

So naturally the Scottish-descended units sported Kevlar kilts, claymores,
and had pipe music playing through loudspeakers. Sort of a "surrender now
or we let slip the Scots of war" kind of threat :-)

Especially since, as soon as they get land of their own, the ihatei could then 
found their own clans.  Aslan society is just as much about how the clans get 
along with each other as how the Aslans themselves get along with each other.  
Your little brother going out and forming his own clan can give you a boost, 
especially if you helped him get it started.  Aslans are *not* stupid, nor are 
they prisoners of their biology.

Rick,
I tried to warn you. These people don\'t play. I saw a black helicopter 
circling my neighborhood last night...

The Traveller Inquisition is out there.
I believe it...

Doug\'s reminded me of something, and it will get to ob.trav. quickly.
Just after I saw SPR, I saw some newly found or restored color
film footage of this attack.  Stunning, of course, as you\'d expect.
Surprising was how similar the real thing and the Spielberg thing were.
(Except for Spielberg\'s washing out of the colors, and some of the
montage points - and other points I will save for the film criticism
discussion group in my head).  If you looked at portions of both,
without knowing which is which, and scratch Spielbergs up only a little,
you\'d think the real thing was faked.

Ob. Trav.: Sometime ago, there was a thread that discussed
TL15 infantry and armor techniques.  What I remember is someone
asking something along the lines of what sound does the plasma cannon
on a grav tank make?  This was a great thread and some of the pictures
in my head won\'t go away.  In fact, when I saw that one dramatic explosion
atop a Baghdad building a couple of weeks ago, I thought about that thread.

I know a couple of relevant works are in progress in this general area,
but I\'d love to see some development of tactics, techniques, and
above and beyond all, things that add this kind of color.  Ideally some
artwork, too.  Is anyone running a military/merc or heavy weapons
campaign?

LOL.  At my college, I was often awoken by our school marching band.
They were 5 pipers and 3 drummers.  I love the pipes.  But you\'re right about
the coyotes.

Ob. Trav.  Sound as a weapon.  IIRC, there are certain low frequencies that
can cause nausea and even strong psychological reactions, i.e, paralyzing
fear.
Would these be used in a TL 15 Third Imperium?  If only to keep Vargr in
line with whistles?  ;-)

Actually, the Texas leaving the U.S. thread was 100% percent relevant to
Traveller. Somebody made a Traveller related post concerning their version
of future history and asked for comments. That discussion was made up of
those comments.

IMTU, sonics are installed on embassy walls facing out in case of protests against the owning governments.  Helps keep down the lawsuits when things get messy.

I wouldn\'t exactly say that.

It\'s even a little more psychotic than that.

(From  the holovid "Aslan & Harriet")

Aslan: "Honey, I\'m home!"
Harriet: "How was your day on the front?"
Aslan: "Great, I fought with extreme honor and we won the day!"
Harriet: "Wonderful. I\'m glad to hear that"
Aslan: "Wait until you check out what I did with our Clan\'s G-Carrier!"
Harriet: "It\'ll have to wait until later, I\'m trying to work out how we\'re
going to pay that honorable band of yours!"

>I now have an entirely new way to play the Aslan, based on every waiter in

I imagine the male Aslan as a warped combo of muscle-car freaks and interior
decorators,  myself.

And the female Aslan as more along the line of no-nonsense accountants.

Well Wednesday, I have to disappoint you. If I remember the article 
correctly, the Scout\'s brew was invented by bartenders who were tired of 
listening to the Imperial Scouts brag about all the different places 
they visited and the exotic (read:dangerous, intense, wonderfully mind 
numbing) drinks they had tasted. One bartender somewhere decided he had 
enough and mixed about a dozen of the most powerful liquors behind the 
bar, (and added a dash of the old internal combustion engine fuel his 
car used) and named it Scout\'s brew.
I have to admit it worked. The drink is quite famous...

Aren\'t the Europeans currently working on something like this for use in
riot control? I\'m not sure where I heard this, but it was a sound "weapon"
that would make victims sick to the stomach.

The Nazis had some research into the subject, although they never got
anything workable. Survival Research Labs made sound cannons from the
research and got sued as a result when they used them at an event in
California. As it turns out, it wasn\'t to damaging to people watching in the
crowd, but people on a nearby highway, in their cars, were deafened (some
permanently).

Still I don\'t think it would be effective on a battlefield. Both sides
would "armor" against it as a matter of course.

Thank you, Rob. Not that he didn\'t come up with an interesting thread or
two, but I think I can speak for a few of us and say my ears were getting
overloaded with all the noise.

Our resident Droyne, Ervmisbe, added an audio holocrystal recording of "The
Flight of the Valkyries" to his Very Silly Battlesuit, "Eric". Does this
help?

It definitely sounds more plausible, maybe if there was a way to modulate
the magnetic field, taking into account the frequency of the AC used to
create it... Hmmm.

Possibly you could create a stealth drone thing that could get close enough
to induce the message. But probably it would be easier just to bung a radio
on the drone.

Never heard of this being done with fighters, but the Ju-87 dive bomber had
the "Jericho Trump" - a whistle (built into the wheel spats, I believe)
that made an ungodly screech when the plane went into its dive.

  As an interesting aside I read a comment today trying to analyze the
response of the Soviet public to their adventure in Afghanistan; it was
along the lines that the "15,000 men killed in ten years was roughly
what they lost in the worst _one hour_ at Kursk" - possibly a factoid
but also reasonable for the opening bombardment and break-ins into their
first defense lines.

I misspoke, sorry.  I was thinking of SMC, which was a rehash.  It\'s
value is that it put\'s the stuff in one volume, but not much new
ground gets covered.  The name implied (to me) a NEW campaign.  I was
miffed with it.  But I got over that long ago.  These days I refer to
it often.  Go figure.

Whats wrong with the Traveller Adventure? I love that thing (so much i own
two)!
It was a good read and should be fun to play. It had lots of interesting
bits of information on most of the planet in Aramis...
In fact if my plans for a permanent Traveller Game become fact, thats what
ill probably run first.

I like both. As a referee, I have given characters to players to 
challenge them, or in some cases, I have allowed players to create 
personal ones with only a veto option on my end. My players and I have a 
really strong trust arrangement: I trust they will bring a reasonable 
character to the game, and they trust if I hand them one, that they will 
be reasonable comfortable in playing it. I don\'t even care if the player 
simply chooses stats and skills instead of rolling them on a table.
(Call me a heretic, I so blatantly confess)
:)
I have only had one player that really abused this rule. He ws one fo 
the two I mentioned before. (Rules Lawyer)

Ayuh.  My official status is "displaced by foreign competition" under
NAFTA due to a supposed glut of cheap Hydro-Quebec power.  I\'m
eligible for up to two years of retraining and extended unemployment
benefits.  Funny, I thought my plant shut down because of
mismanagement ;->

Er, yeah. I\'m running a Space Marine campaign, but at Tech 12 without Jump
Drives (use Stutterwarp instead), battledress (Flack Jacket and Helm is it),
Heavy energy weapons, contra-grav and a whole lot of other Traveller bits. I
guess I just like the system...

That was me what started that thread. PC\'s in the campaigns I have
run never even touched a Grav Tank or hit the firing stud on a Fusion
Z-Gun - we simply didn\'t run heavy weapon Mercenary campaigns.
There was a time or two when what the PC\'s did caused the hard rain
of Imperial attention to fall on some baddie - and I got some beautiful
ideas from the list on what the "special effects" of such activities
should look like. Fusion guns. Ortillery kinetic strikes. Big budget
special effects!

The _Striker_ tables tell me how many dice of damage a weapon does.
I wanted to know what it looked like over the shoulder - as in, "What
does a PC see as he looks over his shoulder while running like H*ll
away from ground zero?"

If new people to the list are interested, send me private email and I\'ll
forward a summary of "special effects" ideas that cropped up in the
thread.

IMTU, Imperial Navy and Marine personnel can request leaves of
abscense from their unit if they need it.  These leaves can be quite
lengthy, up to several years to allow for necessary travel.  The SM
will be expected to report on what he did during his LOA, and will
still be subject to Military Law while on leave.

This is based on the Victorian preactise of keeping good officers with
wanderlust active by allowing them to go off and prospect for gold or
whatever.. by keeping them on the muster roles, it extended the
Empire.

Imperial Army units are stationed on their homeworlds, so the leave
issue is handled by more conventional means.  FYI, soldiers in the
modern US Army get 30 days leave a year. --


and  said Black Ice

OTOH, I wouldn\'t expect the level of personnel turbulence one finds
in, for instance, the US military.  Personnel would tend to enlist,
serve, and retire in the same unit in the Imperial military.  Thus,
there would be less need to travel to take leave, as your immediate
family is probably living nearby.

Imperial Navy vessels, and Imperial Marine units, would probably
operate in a fashion generally similar to the way USN and USMC units
do today. They would spend several months on a cruise, then return for
some time to their home port.  The home port time would be used for
such things as military schools, ship refits, and leave.  In addition,
shore leave at various ports of call would be an option.

I wouldn\'t think that a policy of putting officers on leave for
extended periods of time would be a good one.  Taking the officers out
of their units in such a fashion would hurt unit cohesion (it\'s harder
to develop teamwork when the person who is expected to lead a unit
isn\'t there, and won\'t be there until the balloon goes up).

One way you can involve active duty military characters in adventures
is to assign them to duties outside regular line units.  For instance,
personnel assigned as advisors to reserve or planetary force units
would likely have more time available to adventure, as might
recruiters and military/naval attaches.

I guess this comes down to how you view the Imperail Navy.  Is it Age 
of Sail(steam) or is World War Two and later.  I think both me and 
Doug see it as Age of Sail or Victorian in Nature.   I like Age of 
Sail so I guess Ill go with that.  Chalk one up for Brits in Space :)

Speaking of Brits in Space, for people who would like to read 
something not from a Yank point of view, try Rick Shelley and any of 
his books.  I believe he is English, and does a great job of writing. 
His best books are based on a British Empire in Space with 
Marine and Naval forces in war.

While I appreciate the level of detail we get from current Traveller ship
design systems - especially with the nice spreadsheet work available
on the net - I\'m interested in developing some straightforward fleet action
and operation rules.  Logistics. Alternative fighter tactics. Command

Perhaps there will be a place in T5 for this material, if it can make

Seems as if you have been reading the Lensmens books...  *weg*  Were the
Battleaxes called "Spaceaxes"?

Of course, but did they use "Spaceaxes" or "Spaceswords"?

Maybe in a Pocket Empire near you.  But as of c1200, on the Solomani end
anyways, the 3I isn\'t very popular, due to numerous factors.  To name a few,
the Solomani wars and any lingering propaganda, and the devastation of the
Rebellion, Collapse, and Lucan\'s madness (Virus, if for none of the other
reasons).  Course, there are alot of remnants (even Remnant organizations in
the Reformation Coalition) who might be able to appeal to a growing, more
rational civilization.  On the Regency end, most of the good stuff is trying
to be smuggled past the Quarantine.

Maybe more towards c1300, when the Reformation Coalition spans 3 or 4 sectors.

No, they want someone  who will fill the door when they do

it cost to train a big guy, and the big guy turns out to be more effective.

how to get military characters into an adventure without starting a
war.  The problem is how long are military leaves.  I know that in
most militaries you build up vacation time (about 2weeks to a month)
over a year.  But in Traveller thats hardly enough time to jump back
and forth to another system let alone a long trip.


Well Canadian military leave works like this. You get 24 day leave per year.
You do NOT have to take all of it. Any un-used level carries over.
So if you\'ve been in 5 yr.. you can have up to 120 day to work with. Plus
when filling out your leave you only need 5 day per week (why burn your
leave for a weekend that you normally get off any way). So in the above 5
yr.. term you get 14 week off (plus any stat. hol.). Also if you have done
any extended duty away from you base (at sea in the navy/peace keeping for
the army/air force) you get post deployment leave (2 more days per month of
the deployment) over and above you normal leave. It start to add up real
quick.

Hope this helps you.

For now you can use the following address, although if anyone else has an
active players list, please post it:

http://www.pil.net/~semo

Follow the instructions and maybe we\'ll get a big ol\' group of people on
there so _all_ Traveller players out there can find Face to Face or PBEM
games to play in! Good luck!

The page is a temporary page, and the address will be for a bigger and
cooler website, but for now I wanted to give something back :^)

I agree, as well.  Course one of my players once read a TML digest on my comp
and said the exact same thing.

Clif may or may not be many things, but he has made me (at least) laugh out
loud quite a few times.  His latest exploits, no exception.  There are others
just as bad.  They just sugar coat their shit flinging a bit better.  I\'d
advise more tact, and to nix the blatantly personal attacks, as well as an ob
Trav, but it seems the only off topic things complained about have to do with
the USA or American holidays.  He shouldn\'t be removed without at least a
couple warnings and violations from the list admin, as others have been
playing the game with him.

Rob,

I just want to say, for the record, that you do a fine job running this list.
I\'ve always felt comfortable here (even when I\'ve gotten into the crud with
others in the past, like we all do).

I\'m on other lists, both RPG related and non-RPG related, and I\'ll say that some
list administrators are a real pain in the butt and really detract from the
experience of being on the list.  There\'s one RPG list in particular that has an
administrator that is always bitching about something.  This person is too much
of a nit-picker for me, and I can tell that she is probably not a very happy
person in life.

But, I just want to give you a pat on the back and say that I wish some of the
other lists I\'m on would run things the way you do.

Thanks for the good work,

Kenneth.

So what you are saying is that it is a wussy version of the "Hairy
Buffalow"?

The "Hairy Buffalow" is a drink in which one shot of every liquor behind
the bar is mixed with two shots of lighter fuild...  *weg*

The same thing can be said from TNE Deluxe, and w/ the full design system, and
a full sectors sector data and map (and character creation aids).

I hate to break this to you, but times *have* changed, and they continue to do
so.    Does *anyone* here think vanilla CT would sell today?  Especially
against the would-be T5\'s competitors, Alternity and Star Wars, Revised &
Expanded (leaving off many more numerous small press competitors)?    For that
matter, where is Traveller and where is D&D?  Where is GDW and where is TSR?
The dynamic is much much bigger, but in the end, D&D has grown and evolved
(and thrived) and Traveller is dead as (at least currently) an independantly
supported game.

G:T, u say?  I want to support what I think I might be able to use in my
campaigns. I\'ve bought the first three books (even the core book, which I knew
from teh beginning to be pretty useless considering I don\'t like GURPS and
already have the Imperial Encyclopedia. A side note: Does anyone else think
the Ref\'s section (library data) should\'ve been bigger?  At least the size of
the IEs?)  I don\'t know if i\'ll continue to do so.   So far, it\'s been very
little.  My Regency campaigning keeps getting pushed to the backburner, though
I find I don\'t yawn like I do when I read of the Santanocheev affair or the
Nth Frontier War (and have been happily surprised that G:Ts TNS entries don\'t
do the same)...  But so far, concerning G:T, I see nothing on the horizon
except mostly a rehash of what has already gone before.  BtC (impoved Spinward
Marches), Mercs & Far Trader?  (Book 4, Book 7).  Solomani Rim?  Aliens
Modules?  Is G:T going anywhere with the setting?  It seems to be (from the
TNS anyways and hints in BtC.  Sadly, not a sign in Zhos and Vargr), and i\'ll
be happy to support and maybe even actually game in it, if it will, but the
next question is: Anytime soon?  

Or is it just window dressing on the same old material?

Never played much D&D?  The \'1\' has teh same effect.  The \'20\' a positive.  In
TNE, it\'s reversed.  : )

Now, i\'m not permanetly adjusted w/ TNE mechanics.  The game system isn\'t
perfect (though it\'s as close to that chimera as me and my gaming groups have
yet discovered).  I do think d20 allows a better curve than xd6.   But I was
quite... unimpressed... by T4s mechanics (indeed chose TNE over T4, even with
the explanation of Traveller\'s history in T4 explained).   If T5 is going to
do nothing but cater to the middle aged grognards who have clung to the game
of their youth, which seems to be nothing but a diminishing herd, i\'ll have NO
reason to support it.

My age?   I would appear to be one of the few 20 year olds so far, at about 2
weeks past 23.  There might be more, but IMO 20 year olds are far less likely
to lurk than the older ones.  Certainly an internet mailing list isn\'t
representative, but it\'s quite useful for comparisons against other rpgs and
their mailing lists, especially for ones as old as xD&D and Traveller.   A
survey (private?  with anonymous data posted on teh web somewhere?) of the
list would probably be quite interesting.

One of the defining features of Australian culture is we dont really have a
\'service\' culture.

In America, it is expected that people who sell you things will say \'Have a
nice day\' and so on. Personally, it annoyed me when I was in America that
salespeople pretended they cared about me.

The defining statement is probably the reply to the stock Macdonalds
question of \'Do you want fries with that ?\' which is of course \'If I wanted
fries I\'d <obscentity> well ask for them.\'. The reply to \'Have a nice day\'
is of course \'Thank you, but I have other plans\'.

<example of bank declining to give change deleted>

>Is this kind of response common in Australian culture, or was she getting
>some kind of different treatment because she was a tourist/outsider?

Australia is developing more of a \'service\' culture, but it\'s still a
cultural difference.

>ObTrav: Thinking about all the little vagaries between how people do things 
>from planet to planet, and the misunderstandings this can lead to.

Not just cultures. For example, yesterday\'s Washington Post (Sunday the
ummm tenth) had an example about the slow decay of America\'s volunteer
urban fire brigades. Now, Australia has a system of professional urban fire
brigades, but the rural bushfire brigades are amateur volunteers (which
makes sense to me ... an urban brigade has to deal with stuff like chemical
fires). Now, in Australia, it is expected that the local council will fund
a fire brigade, but in a rural American town it would be assumed that this
would be done by volunteers (to haul this ob-Trav, I like the idea of the
Duke of Regina\'s Own Bush Fire Brigade ... His Grace provides the funds to
buy the equipment for the rural fire brigades on some poor world. I can see
some IISS or IN commander \'arranging\' things so that there is spare
capacity on some military ship going to that world. His Grace would get
*very* upset if the local military tried to requisition the grav trucks and
grav-powered water bombers and use them to fight the insurgents).

An example that is close to my heart is sports facilities. I used to live
in Marrickville, a suburb of Sydney that was in the lowest 30% of median
incomes in the country, had about 70% of the population born outside
Australia. In the US, it would be a barrio.

Now, Marrickville Municipal Council covered about 70 000 people. One of the
local political issues was the local council declining to fund repairs to
the second 50 meter swimming pool in the municipality. The council either
funded or part-funded about fifteen football fields of various sorts, about
forty soccer fields, two tennis centers of about half a dozen courts each
(one with two grass courts), four turf cricket pitches (Petersham Oval
pulled double duty with baseball) and a golf course. Schools had additional
facilities that were not council-funded.

Remember, this is just Marrickville. Canterbury, South Sydney and Ashfield
councils could come up with a similar list, and that is only the
inner-western chunk of Sydney.

My wife is from Bremerton, a middle-class satellite city of Seattle in
Washington State. She cannot think of any council-funded sports facilities
in Bremerton.

The point is that Australians expect council-funded sports facilities to be
available, and that local teams should be able to rent these facilities off
the council for minimal cost. It is a public service that is expected, and
any council that sells off sports fields can expect to run into problems in
the next elections.

In the US, there isnt that expectation.

Now, to bring this ob-Trav, worlds are going to have radically different
expectations on what should and shouldnt be government funded, and how this
should be organised.

Health care is one obvious example, while airports are a less obvious one
(\'You want to use the starport ... our system is not showing you as a
stockholder\'). Security is even better (\'We Triaari are responsible for
this list of locations ... you say the guy shot you at Attapi Park ... I\'m
sorry. The Billaamo are responsible for that Civic Zone ... are you paid up
?\')

Dont forget the bit in Dumas\' Three Musketeer\'s where the Commander puts
Our Heroes on extended leave so they can officially have Porthos get a rest
cure for his injury and thus go and do a private mission for Her Magesty in
a completely deniable fashion.

TNE\'s FF&S was probably the most adaptable design system that Traveller has
ever had. If you wanted to make Star Trek style starships with different FTL
drives, you could do it. If you wanted to muck around with the technology
and reproduce nearly any sci-fi elements, you could do it. And the book\'s
commentary was informative and handled so even an armchair scientist like
myself could use it!

Probably the one book from any Traveller line that I used the most.

Actually, for the moment, Star Wars is not much of a competitor to
Traveller. LucasFilm has revoked the Star Wars license from WEG, and they
are open to other negotiations at the moment. All of the majors have
released new sci-fi lines, each with a good deal of support. TSR\'s Alternity
is a major contender. White Wolf\'s Trinity is one to watch for especially,
IMHO, the books for this game are totally top-notch and relatively cheap
(one of the smaller ones, a handbook for Trinity\'s alien races costs a
whopping $5). SJG has put out their GURPS Traveller line.

That\'s all well and good, however, Last Unicorn Games is up and running as
the latest Trek license holders. LUG isn\'t a major player, and this wouldn\'t
be newsworthy _however_, they\'ve got three important things going for them.
1.) It\'s a roleplaying game set in the universe of one of the most popular
science-fiction franchises, 2.) the system is _extremely_ simple and the
books are geared towards beginning roleplayers, 3.) they\'ve got the backing
of a major distribution network: Simon & Schuster.

Some standard bookstores in my area carry AD&D, some carry Vampire, a couple
used to carry Star Wars, ALL of them carry Star Trek. These are plain-Jane
bookstores, and there\'s ST:TNG right up there with the sci-fi books.

I\'m not even bringing the truly excellent spate of second and third string
sci-fi games into the picture here!

There\'s obviously a good deal of interest in "to the stars" style sci-fi
roleplaying at the moment. They are all extremely professional, and they are
all competing for the same market. Times have changed, the market is much
bigger than it used to be and there\'s alot more competition.

For the record, I\'m not trying to spread doom and gloom for Traveller here.
I love Traveller, and I want it to succeed very much. Traveller\'s got to be
sleeker, meaner and better looking than ever to compete. The hobby is
completely different than it used to be, and there are companies with a good
deal of resources at their disposal.

You complain about G:T not doing anything new for the setting, and that\'s
fine. To a large extent I agree with you. However, keep one very important
fact in mind: There are no more copies of older Traveller materials that
will hit the market, period. Sure, the library data may not be useful to
owners of the Imperial Encyclopedia. Keep in mind, however, that the
Imperial Encyclopedia wasn\'t extremely useful to people with the CT Library
Data supplements. G:T has to woo new players to the fold, and you can\'t do
that by assuming that everyone has a copy of _any_ older Traveller
materials. These older materials, barring a miracle, are not coming back
into print anytime soon. I read the GURPS: Traveller discussion on Pyramid,
and I\'m heartened to see people reading these library data entries for the
first time and asking questions about what\'s going on.

  The Traveller Book / TTA probably could, maybe with some colour/upgraded
B&W art in TTB. IMHO.

  WEG is still living on the edge, and TSR has pined and been re-animated by
the Wicked Witch of the West (Coast). GDW closed in a dignified and orderly
fashion, which puts them ahead of those groups. It remains to be seen whether
Alternity will succeed on any basis other than sheer advertising power, which
didn\'t save any TSR products that come to mind.

  But seriously, you really think SJG won\'t pack a bit more info into what
will probably be 144-page large-format books than went into a 52-page LBB?
And that even before considering that these G:T sourcebooks shouldn\'t be
rules heavy - which is precisely what Books 4 & 7 were providing?

  As much as I like B:7, there\'s every indication that the average chapter
in GT: Far Trader will include more background info (B:7 did of course have
the entire rules section on expanded Merchant generation and play, as well)
than that entire LBB.

Wow.  US Navy (and, I assume, other US military) leave accrues at 2.5 days
per month.  You can let it build up all you want, but on 1 October (the
beginning of the US government\'s fiscal year) you lose everything over 60
days - hence "use-it-or-lose-it" leave, taken in September to avoid losing
excess leave.  (One year I had to take 24 days!)  Exceptions are permitted
in the case of ships, aircraft squadrons, &c, which are deployed to
locations where taking leave would be difficult; this excess leave must be
used within two years, or it is lost.

So how long would a player have to respond?  A couple days?  A couple
hours?  Nothing like being in the middle of an important battle or other
event and then losing out because I have duty and can\'t get home to my
computer, or have to get under way for a few days....

I use these ultra-low frequency devices as riot control equipment starting

I got across the basic idea of "su madre" to a friend by dropping into
the appropriate "dialect" and saying "yo\' mama!" He got the point.

A *lovely* one I picked up somewhere (possibly Cottman IV?) is "Your
parents were brothers." I\'ve actually used it in real life. It was
interesting to watch as the meaning slowly pentrated...

Ditto for comments about parentage/ancestry. See my example above, or
the one I *know* comes from Cottman IV "seven-fathered" (ie implying
that the person referred to is the result of an orgy or a mother with
morals so loose that she couldn\'t narrow your father down to less than
7 men!)

Do keep in mind that until you get chainmail armor, said "wedding
tackle" is *just* as vulnerable to a sword regardless of whether you
are naked or fully "dressed" for battle. 

And a sword blow isn\'t likely to hit *there* without hitting something
a lot more critical, such as a leg or your abdomen, on the way.

And in any case, while the kilt might make it harder to *cut* you, even
a *dull* sword causes massive damage by concentrating the force of the
blow in such a manner as to break bones. 

The SCA is *all* too familiar with these issues, because even though
our "weapons" are lighter than the real thing, and have a broader
striking area, we have found it necessary to set up *strict* standards
for "minimum armor" so as to avoid serious injuries. And even a great
kilt doesn\'t come *close*.

Contrary to popular belief, chainmail is *not* that encumbering. It
doesn\'t hinder your ability to bend. It does add weight, but it\'s far
better distributed than (say) a field pack. 

And don\'t forget that the *only* thing holding up a kilt is your
*belt*. If something happens to it, you will have your legs caught in
*yards* of heavy woolen cloth. Unlike modern kilts, the pleats are
*not* sewn in. They are merely *folds* in the cloth, kept in place by
the belt.

>> I had heard that when required to move quickly and on forced marches they

For a battle, you\'d leave them back with the rear ranks. A kilt was a
major portion of your wealth! A dozen or more yards of plaid was *not*
cheap.

Not quite. Basic D&D, Expert D&D, Immortals D&D, etc are all parts of
one "system". The later ones just add extra rules for dealing with
higher levels and more power. 

So we have "original D&D". This gives birth to both AD&D, and to the
"Basic, etc " D&D family. The BASIC family hasn\'t been revised much...

AD&D has gone thru several incarnations. 

So I\'d say we have this:

Original ----+---- AD&D ---- AD&D 2nd ed ----AD&D 3rd ed
             |
             +---- "Basic D&D" (and follow ons).

Not exactly. Sulfur *dioxide* (SO2) will react with water to produce
sulfurOUS acid (H2SO3). This is pretty weak stuff. 

To create sulfurIC acid requires sulfur *tri*oxide (SO3). This is a lot
harder to create and is a fairly strong oxidizing agent all by itself. 

Also, H2S (hydrogen sulfide) is a possible candidate for a "sulfur
taint". And it *won\'t* react worth beans with water. Though you can
*burn* it. Which gives you water and SO2.

Even "weak" acid seas will tend to erode the hell out of rock,
neutralizing the acid in the process.

Distilling is possible, but complicated.

You won\'t get rid of *all* the "taint" that way. Posibly not even
enough to make the air safe to breathe for extended periods. Best bet
is to pass it thru an *alkaline* solution (say "limewater" (CAO2 in
solution). The sulfites and sulfates will react with the calcium and
precipitate out as gypsum (calcium sulfate). 

> This must be good for some sort of industry, but what ? Metal refining ?

Not really. But such high levels of sulfur compounds in the air tend to
indicate either massive amounts of volcanic activity (which implys lots
of useful mineral depositsin the process of being laid down) or
*enormous* amounts of sulfur in the planet\'s makeup (in which case you
just mine the sulfur). 

The mineral deposits mentioned above would be hydrothermal ones. That
is, water seeping through very hot rock dissolves various minerals, and
they precipitate out when the water gets somewhere that it can cool.
Metal sulfides are major components of such deposits. They are also
easy to refine.

Metal sulfides are things like galena (lead sulfide) iron pyrite (an
iron sulfide), and a bunch of others. Lead, copper, and silver are
prominent parts of such deposits.

  No way, no how, not on today\'s market. The selling trend today seems to
be either 1)quick to learn, easy to play systems favoring loose
storytelling-type games os 2) high-detail games with a lot of options and
detail plus a heavy dose of gritty realism. CT doesnt even come close to
being either (by today\'s standards, that is).

  I have high hopes for GT: Far Trader. If it can really deliver what it
promises, it might just be the hottest thing since sliced bread. I mean,
just how long has Traveller languished without a working trade model?
Could this finally be it?

  I have this standard test I try on all combat sustems I come across. I
call it the "9mm test". It invelves using the game mechanics to shoot an
unarmored man in the chest with a modern 9mm pistol from a few meters
away. The results should be very painful, quite messy and potentially (but
not invariably) lethal. TNE failed this test, other systems have passed,
so I use those systems. I did kinda like the TNE character generation
system, though.


> I do think d20 allows a better curve than xd6. 

  Excuse me? I\'d have to disagree, d20 has a linear probability
distribution. It\'s the xd6:s that give curvilinear distibutions. For me
3d6 (as in GURPS) seems to give the best spread, but this is of course
strictly a matter of taste.

  Quite a provocative way to put it, but I think I\'d still have to agree
with you on this.

I see what you mean. It makes sense that Repulsors shouldn\'t work
for at least Area Point Defense, I\'m still thinking of letting Escorts use
them to protect the ships they are defending. Consider the handwave
for why ships can only escort lower-agility vessels - the Escort needs
the agility advantage so it can place itself between the target and the
threat, even while the target is dodging.

Lasers and Energy Weapons have both offensive and defensive roles.
Repulsors are only defensive, so I think it would be balanced to allow
Escorts to use Repulsors. Besides, it\'ll make people design 5000tn
or so ships with Repulsor bays.

>Well, I\'m not sure "worthless failures" is used, is it?
Page 24 of BtC "Landless Aslan males are failures, worthless to society."
IMHO, this contradicts G:T Aslan library data that the landless are indeed
the lowest class, but are farmers, laborers, craftsmen and factory workers.
Not exactly worthless to society.  Granted, females would make up the vast
majority of those jobs, just from sheer numbers, but per G:T those males
aren\'t worthless.  BtC says different.

>It\'s a "sink or swim" test of vitality and ambition.
I don\'t think the Ihatei taboo against inheritance allows for the testing
you suggest.  I\'ve interpreted it to be along the lines of bastards in a
feudal society.  Get rid of them as soon as society allows you to.  This
probably means infanticide, when the father can get away with it, although
I doubt that Aslan society would allow this in the open, no matter how low
Ihatei are considered.  Second sons will be dumped on the street as soon as
they can fend for themselves, like Dickensian street urchins.  With claws.
Unless you can afford to get rid of them some other way.  They\'ll be
trouble all the same, no matter what you do.

>When resources are plentiful, you take more chances with the second sons.
Perhaps an economic boom in the Heirate could explain the sudden upsurge
in Ihatei activity?

I agree.  Ihatei ships, no matter what size or how old, don\'t come cheap.
You only have more sons when the risks to society aren\'t as great, ie the
economy is doing good.

>event that triggers their expansion?

Well, Aslan crossed the Rift two millennia ago.  The Florani, a human minor
race in the TR, got the jump drive from them in -170.  I\'d guess, since
they didn\'t swamp the Florani at the time, that these groups were
colonization spikes, like the Sword Worlds and Terran descendant Darrians
you and Alan Bradley mentioned.

IMTU, infighting among Ihatei over prize worlds is what slowed Aslan
expansion.  Thats why the Florani found a wrecked ship to get the jump
drive from, and not an invasion fleet.  Also, the Glorious Empire, a
heretical Aslan state smack in the middle of the TR, served to keep the
Aslan hedged rimward.
Just as Hans suggested, MTU has the Imperium active against Aslan expansion
after the First Civil War.  It\'s more of a clandestine, espionage campaign,
as the Glorious Empire uses human slavery, and who likes that?  Also, the
Imps don\'t want the Zhos adding the Aslan into a new Outworld Coalition.
Lots of adventure hooks in the old Sindalese Empire worlds.  But I
digress...
Ihatei raiders could get past the GE, especially if the GE is troubled with
slave revolts.  But this would be only  random, one shot affairs, not a
wave of invasions.  In the TNE timeline, lack of Imperial support allowed
the GE to be overrun, the booty from the GE funded a lot of Ihatei and
regular clan fleets to push into Imperial space.  This isn\'t happening in
the G:T timeline.  Only long range spikes are hitting Motmos etc.
Population pressures are making more Ihatei spikes, but it won\'t get too
serious as long as the GE is still there, but its coming under a lot of
pressure too.

>I\'m not sure I picture Aslan sons knocking off their superiors too often.
Badly phrased.  Sorry, I didn\'t mean to suggest that, exactly.  Its more
along the lines of knocking off the neighbors clan leaders and taking the
neighbors land.
I think it\'s cannon that the Heirate standard line is "those raiders are
Ihatei, not Heirate troops, we don\'t control them at all" then giving those
\'raiders\' protection once they have land (since they are now upstanding
members of society and not worthless).  This line probably works better
with other Aslan.  Ihatei would attack other clans, not their own.  Only if
the attacks were success would they suddenly become clans members.  The
attacked clan could not retaliate against anyone except the Ihatei.  Once
the Ihatei are clan, the victim clan could attack the first clan, but it
would be considered unprovoked since "the clan" didn\'t attack them, the
"Ihatei" did.

Alan stated "Ihatei fleets are how clans extend their holdings."
I disagree that they see it that way, exactly.  I think the Heirate
actually believes that line (used a lot by the Serbians during their war -
"Those are extremist guerrillas, they have no connection to our government.
We think its a shame they are killing our enemies...").  Due to Aslan
psychology/culture, they actually believe this stuff.

How do they keep general warfare from dissolving the Aslan worlds?  Don\'t
arm your Ihatei, make them laborers instead.  Unless you have too many of
them, you have a good economy, and a few obsolete ships.  Then you pack
your Ihatei aboard, and tell them to get out of your sight or you will blow
them out space.  The Ihatei head for the border as fast as they can, and
start making trouble there.  This is why they don\'t go spinward.  An Ihatei
fleet would be seen as a threat by everyone, especially Aslan, and
therefore subject to attack.  It would be a huge gauntlet to run starting
from the middle of the TR, for example, to get to The Beyond.  You push
straight for the border instead, where there are guaranteed empty worlds.
Empty in the sense aren\'t controlled by Aslan clans.

>No males?  But then where do your fighting forces come from?
Oh, yeah, right.  I\'m thinking the transports are the support your clan
gives you after you are more or less established.  I\'d say an Ihatei fleet
would consist of a ragtag assortment of attack craft and troop transports

350 tons of depleted uranium weapons, considered useful by the military 
because of an unusual ability to destroy tanks. Almost certainly, the 
radioactive dust produced on impact caused the "Gulf War Syndrome" which 
has sickened over 200,000 Americans and an unknown number of Iraqis."

Is this antinuclear activist group just going overboard here because the 
weapon has the hateful word "uranium" in it? I\'ve never heard anything before 
about depleted uranium rounds being any kind of radiation or contamination

En Garde, for those of you who are unaware, was actually the first
roleplaying game GDW put out.  The first edition apparently came out in
\'75, and it was revised in \'77, if I\'m reading the copyright notice right.

It\'s essentially a duelling system, with a fairly high-level (weekly turns)
roleplaying system bolted on, set in something vaguely resembling 17th or
18th century France.  (More like 17th, IMHO).

Anyway, its relevance to Traveller is that it\'s set in an aristocratic
society, like the Imperium, and focuses on the week to week life of
(mostly) the upper classes.

It\'s already been ripped off for Traveller once:  Marcus Rowland, I think,
used it as a basis for a military academy situation in a Challenge article.

It would need some serious mangling to work in Traveller, including
modifying it to include female PCs(!), but I think it might be worth
looking into.

The weekly turn level is particularly interesting.  It\'s an intermediate
level between the second to second play of "normal" low-level Traveller,
and the monthly (World Tamers\' Handbook) and yearly (Pocket Empires) turns
of high-level play.  This might be worth sticking on to those systems, to
bring them more in synch with lower level games.

I\'m thinking of looking at it more deeply, in between all the other mad
projects I\'m doing.  Would anyone else be interested in seeing the results?
 Has anyone else done anything along these lines?

I always liked the big (ancient) billboard up in Kokadjo ME.

Need for context here;  You\'ve just passed the bustling metropolis of
Greenville (pop like 4,000 in that many acres), after driving (1) 4 hours
in the Maine Tpke and (2) 2 hours on country highways through some of the
most beautiful country I know.  The last billboard before this was in
Boston.

The billboard reads something like;

another problem with SO3 is that when you mix it with water, you get
what can be best be described as a stable mist.

I recall the experiment from school - stand outside and a small amount
of SO3 passed through water = acidic mist that floats off across town,
assuming the teacher gets the wind direction correct. :-)

Apparently you can\'t easily turn this into a liquid, so the industrial
solution is to dissolve the SO3 into Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) to produce
Oleum (sp?) (H2SO7).

You then add the Oleum to water to get the Sulphuric acid.

Oleum appears to be one of those very nasy chemicals that industry
probably wishes it didn\'t have to play with.

I doubt that Aslan society would allow this in the open, no matter how low

IMTU, I\'ve seen Aslan as being very concerned with family responsibilities.
I can\'t see anyone but the lowest of the low landholders committing male

honor to your house is there in having your unwanted children begging
in the streets outside your doors?

Too many Ihatei in a clan is a problem, certainly. Aslan face their problems,
they don\'t quietly dispose of them or toss them out and ignore them.

I think more "Questing Knight" than "Dickensian Orphan". You must send
your Ihatei out into the world. The stronger and better prepared you send
them out, the better honor their departure brings to your clan - and the
better chance they will found a clan that will extend your clan\'s power.
Sending them out in rags, on the other hand...

They aren\'t?  Well, it seems to me that a "Hairy Buffalow" would be the

Well, "depleted" uranium is still radioactive, but not dangerously so.
Inhaling
uranium dust is probably not good for you, of course, but I doubt depleted-
core
rounds kick up any significant amount of such dust.  An armchair strategist
such as myself is probably not the best person to address that.

My guess is, you\'re right about the knee-jerk reaction to the word "uranium."
Much as I hate falling into Jerry Pournelle\'s camp, my experience has been
that most anti-nuke activists have no understanding of the science involved
(and are proud of their ignorance).

My thoughts are that you would not. As you go into the Low Birth and are
"frozen" as you go in, your sate of mind, and sate of boady would be the same
when to were taken out.

But then do people think that there is a period of relaxation that the low
bearth buts the boady through before they go under ? If this was the case then
they would up unfrozen, and would wake up refresed and relaxed.

Any suggestions, comments and oppinions would be appreciated.

Depends on the item.  I\'d probably use the invention rules, with a bonus for

Also, don\'t forget that your brothers will be a (I think they call it)
cadet branch of your clan, adding to the influence and prestige of your
own. After all they are related, so the family relations will continue.
Your younger brother will also welcome the backup of the larger family
clan in conflicts with other clans.

So I don\'t think it\'ll be at all adversarial.

This must be the same reason kids whine when parents say "No".  If they
whine enough and long enough they know parents get demoralized and give
in with much less of a fight.  And sometimes I\'ve been told that kids
even begin to whine when they get off the bus because they know that at
certain frequencies, whines have been known to strike a chord with
overworked parents that sets up a resonance that makes them give in even
before the questions are asked.....

			Dule Alphonse could order the subsector/reserve fleet to act against the
pirates and would probably be able to get the Regular fleet to act if they
were otherwise unengaged, bypassing any request for action to Capital or
Archduke.
			What would the Marquis be able to do?  I don\'t know.
			Or perhaps the same planet cannot be a Count\'s fief and part of a Marquis\'
fief--I\'m unclear.     Clearly every planet is beholden to a Subsector Duke,
and very often a Count and/or marquis too, with sections of a planet beholden
possibly to a baron.

First I think you need some background...  I am running a TNE game using MT
Rules & a dash of PE...

 A player in the game has captured a TL-8 balkanized planet...  Upon this
planet was several large stockpiles of nuclear weapons...  Anyway, after he
captured this world he moved all nuclear weapons of this planet, using
surplus TL-11 fighters he has mated the TL-8 Nuclear Weapons (in the 10 to
100 Megaton Range) with them for use against primarily ships, but can be
used against ground targets, & using surplus TL-10 Air/Rafts he has mater
the TL-8 Nuclear Weapons (in the 20 Kiloton to 10 Megaton Range) for use
against Ground Targets...

Now the question...  I know the effects of the Air/Raft-Nuclear Weapon
combo on Ground Targets because I am using the Morrow Project rules for
that, but what I would like to know is the effect ot the Fighter-Nuclear
weapon combo on ships...  Like what would a 10 Mt device do, a 25 Mt
device, a 50 Mt device, & a 100 Mt device?

Well, the problem is not as much that they\'re radioactive (they\'re not,
that\'s rather the whole point of the _depleted_ bit) but that they _are_
toxic, especially if you go crawling around a wreck where one has hit
and vaporized. These are not just uranium, but they have stable fission
by-products, as well, which are also toxic. Lots of heavy meatals
floating about in fine dust form. 

I rather doubt that the Gulf War Syndrome is solely caused by these
things. In fact, I suspect that it is an unholy synergistic reaction
with _all_ the toxic crap floating around the troops during the war,
what with the insecticides, anti-anthrax injections, other assorted
inoculations, breathing burning oil well for months on end, mustard gas,
possibly nerve gas combustion products, and heavy metals from blowing up
all those Iraqis with our depleted uranium rounds...we really should
have worried less about the chemical warfare committed by the Iraqis and
worried more about that we inflicted on ourselves. :-/

A number of the symptoms of Gulf War syndrome have been documented in
refinery workers, both petroleum as well as metals extraction. I suspect
that the inoculations and such given all the troops probably primed
their immune systems as well to be much more sensitive to environmental
insult.

This is not to say that the anti-nuke folks aren\'t going to scare people
with the fact that \'uranium\' is a boogey-man word, they\'ve played fast
and loose with the truth for a long time. (Given, they learned that from
the AEC and the government, I\'m not all that surprised...)

they\'re posted at:

One shows all the sector names, both canon, and a  lot beyond canon. The
other is a political regions map, showing the 3I in scale and context of
the surrounding olitical entities, such as the Zhodani, K\'Kree and

Fascinating maps, and if whoever did them wants to let me know the rest

True.  However, most insurgencies aren\'t going to use \'hidden\' rooms per se;
they\'re going to use perfectly normal rooms which people who aren\'t their
friends rarely enter.  A basement with boxes of condiments and one with boxes
of weapons probably don\'t look all that different...

Yes. Jump space destroys normal matter. That\'s why ships carry a bubble
of *normal* space around them. So Ship A is *not* in jump space. It\'s
in a small chunk of normal space that\'s inside jump space.

Alas for ship A, it\'s also in "normal space" that\'s nowhere *near*
"flat" enough for safe activation of a jump drive. So it suffers the
same fate as a ship trying to jump from the surface of a planet. 

Ship B runs into trouble because Ship A\'s attempts may disrupt the
bubble of normal space around it. In which case *it* goes away.

The standard definition of Jump says it needs to be about 100 diameters from the nearest significant gravity source.  If ship A were in a big enough cargo hold that it was 100 diameters from anyplace on ship B, it would by definition be further than 100 d from any point of the Jump bubble ship B is in.  You are saying that 100 diameters from the closest point of a Jump bubble is not flat enough space?

Personally, I use active military players only when the mission is of 
military (or political) importance. I might run a Navy Covert Op with an 
Intel team of active officers, but anything which is the "usual style" 
of "adventuring" with player characters I require no military 
attachments, i.e. having finished the service committment and retired or 
simply didn\'t reinlist.

This way if a player nukes a starport, noone can say he was active duty 
Imperial military and start a war. Anyone that is retired is officially 
out of the service. (This becomes a fine line when they have become 
independent mercenaries, or some other such type of operator.)

Good luck making it work in YTU.

I\'ve been hearing something about this too, but I can\'t quote anything. 
Seems like there is some thought about that in the area here around
Washington DC, but again, I can\'t remember where I saw it.  Evening News
or something.  There was a point made about the military not doing the
research into what would happen when you used those rounds and that
basically we were asking our tankers and such to be guinea pigs.

Could be true...

DU isn\'t a particularly significant radiation hazard, but uranium is a highly
reactive metal, and can cause heavy metal poisoning -- it\'s more toxic than
lead.  However, there\'s no shortage of things in the burning wreckage of a tank
which are contamination hazards, so its not clear how much it really adds to
the risk.

Note that DU may be being phased out anyway, there\'s some evidence that its
superior armor penetration has to do with a rapid chemical reaction that occurs
when it impacts against steel, causing the metal to soften, and newer armors
can be constructed that don\'t behave in this way, which means tungsten is just
as good.

In any case, the concept that use of DU makes a war \'nuclear\' is rather absurd.

So we take possible contaminated water, and add an alkaline to it, until
satureated. (The alkaline will remove any weak acid from the contaninated
water first). Then pass the air through it untill the water sulution is PH7,
and we end up with pure water, clean air, and gypsum. Is this right ? Is
Gypsum useful for anything ?

If the world were a water world, where would you find the alkaline ? apart
from off world.

Im trying to wright up a world, that would survive the long night, on it\'s
own, at around TL 5, 6, or 7 (the lower the better) with a small population
(pop code 5), although it is looking more like I will have to change the taint
(something I don\'t realy want to do).

Any suggestions, comments, or oppinions are always welcome.

Because the game is turn based and turns set at a specific period of time
(up to the licensees of the game, but usually around 7 days) things are made
easier. All combat is resolved before the end of a turn. Generally a turn is
made up of a number of commands that you can issue - initiating a combat
would use one of them. Once the combat is over, and your position survives,
you would continue onto the next command that you issued.

Each player position also has a \'flee factor\' so that when they take a
certain amount of damage, they attempt to initiate self-preservation and
leave the combat in the quickest way possible. In a game of Traveller, this
could be landing on a planet, firing thrusters and escaping the battle zone,
or jumping straight to FTL. Each game is different.

Also each character in a game not only has combat skills, but can specialise
those skills. There are also a series of options that you can set for combat
using a \'combat sheet\'. Simply select the options you want to use for the
coming battle and they are initiated - these include, stunning or killing
your victims, frightening rather than hurting them, targeting options as
well as retreat and other options.

Well, since Force = Mass * Acceleration, you can still do as much damage.
You\'ve decreased the mass, allowing those swords and staves to be whipped
about much faster and still do signficant damage.  And there isn\'t much you can
do add drag.

Well, there may some dispute here.  My academic sources say the
average suit of chainmail wieghed 60-75 pounds and it was all borne
on the shoulders.  Whereas plate mail, commonly depicted as very
encumbering, was actually very good at distributing weight over
the entire body and was actually fairly light.


Which gets me back to Ob. Trav:
Body armor.  I think the rules in FFS, and even FFS2, are very weak
on the materials available at higher tech levels.  Although I do
appreciate the body armor creation rules in FFS1, the flexible
body armor materials available stops at TL8 (ballistic weave)
It seems to me (and I should probably just develop something)
that higher TLs will have better quality flexible armor materials.
After all, we know have Real World (tm) improved kevlar
that will stop a .357 Magnum round at pointblank, and not even
knock a large man back (although braced).

I also have a problem with the -1 Agility for rigid plates on
any part of the torso.  It seems to me that smaller plate
inserts wouldn\'t hamper movement so much.

Thing is, *NONE* of the Czech bio/chem warfare experts who were in the Gulf 
War came down with Gulf War Syndrome.  These guys are considered the world\'s 
best at detecting and responding to biohazards on the battle field.  It\'s 
generally accepted that Gulf War Syndrome is due to Iraqi bioweapons that were 
partially destroyed , allowing the active agents to escape.

Or the onesium rounds.  Though with the extremely limited availiability of onesium, these rounds would be scarce.

Question...  How vulnerable to Dreaded Beachball laser fire would depleted uranium \'crowbars\' a la THOR be?  Would the uranium ablate too drastically at the power levels used by point defense lasers or what?

I\'m looking for information on how to present starship combat in a 
more fluid manner.

I\'m sure we\'ve all been there at some point in time; trying to bring
new players into the fold.  This is no exception.  My players are
relatively new to s/f gaming, and they get bogged down with the 20
minute turns and related concepts from Traveller starship combat. 
It seems that the more realistic dimensions of Traveller\'s starship
combat does not jibe with their perceptions of the "dog fight"
scenarios of Star Wars, Babylon 5, and Star Trek.  They\'re used to 
quick melee combat, and want to handle starship combat on the same 
time scale.

Does anyone have any recommendations of how to (at least partially)
combat the players\' initial resistance?

I\'ve tried to explain the vast distances involved, and the need for 
time to pass to see measurable change in relative position, but they 
keep getting caught on things like:  "What do you mean, I can only 
fire once every 20 minutes?"  (And they don\'t buy the "Many shots are 
launched/fired, but only a few hit" theory.  These are the same 
players that have problems with AD&D one minute combat rounds, and 
they\'re pulling the same arguments and resistance to counter any 
discussions on the time scale in Traveller.)

I did find several links to a webpage discussing Roleplaying Starship 
Combat, but all the links are dead.  If that would help, I\'d love to 
access that information if anyone still has a copy of it on file 
somewhere.

I\'ve considered the boring exercise of breaking it down to one minute 
and even 12 second turns (I use the HERO System due to player psych 
lims), and showing them how unexciting it would be, but they are 
apparently caught in the glamour of SW/ST/B5 combat scenes.

Any help in this would be appreciated.

Please, just let it die for the time being.

My own request? Please don\'t bother him at the moment. With the month off,
maybe he\'ll come to his senses. Losing _anyone_ from the Traveller
community, IMHO, is a major loss. IMHO, trying to get a service provider to
drop someone should be saved as a complete last resort, when things go from
insults to threats. I don\'t want to take advantage of the average ISP\'s fear
of litigation for personal vengeance.

I\'m a big believer in this myself. Scouts IMTU are easily identifiable from
a distance as Scouts, just due to their own personal decorations, usually
being a clashing mishmash of items and stuff borrowed from different worlds.
On one planet in the subsector I\'m working on there\'s a polluted atmosphere,
and anybody who ventures out into the outside has to wear filter masks.
Pretty basic, but these folks have prefected decorating their masks to an
art!

One of my *other* PBEM characters, in Nick\'s game \'Star Viking Legacy\', has a 
highly customised high tech \'skinsuit\' that\'s been worked over for max 
efficiency.  He also had some artwork done to it so that it was easier to 
distinguish him at a distance just by looking at his suit painting, simular to 
the Belters in Niven\'s \'Known Space\' universe do, for exactly that reason.

FWIW, this guy\'s name is Gil Hamilton.  <grin>

So ?

There would still be more kinetic energy on impact in one of these
than there is
in a standard APDS round, which has the same draw-backs and is even
less efficient at trransfering it\'s energy to it\'s projectile.

Looks like we\'re talking about completely different things, the ones I

use a 100g solid tungsten projectile with a sabot, see

No more than we have already discussed, and nowhere near as much power
as a _laser_
that is designed to attack something other than thin-skinned aircraft
or missiles.

In fact, a rail gun designed to destroy modern AFVs can be powered by
the same energy required to power a laser designed to take out
thin-skinned aircraft or missiles.

But it\'s less likely to hit than a 100g spin-stabillised projectile,
Also, the longer the projectile the more the electromagnetic field has
to interact with, a spherical shape is very hard to accelerate
compared to a cylinder.

Good point, all.  So, we can scratch it\'s use against sapce craft.
Same point can be made for combat vehicles dirt side.  How about
infantry equipment?  Would the shielding on a co-axial cable be
sufficent to protect them for such electro-magnetic vandalism?

Many, not all, sulfur compounds will be removed by water.  It
is easier to neutralize the acid with lye (sodium hydroxide).

Old B5 used to be great--a shot of a NArn Cruiser shooting, then a
cut to a shot of the target cut in half. Now every damn fight has
both combatants in the same frame (even as the weapons officer gives
a range in thousands of klicks. Oh well.

What theory? That\'s the way it is. You could allow them to fire once
every fraction of a second and have most shots miss, I guess :-)

be doing is presuming that the target of the insults is familiar
enough with human/Imperial/Terran culture to recognize that some
of these would _be_ insults.  If an Aslan isn\'t aware of (a) the
perceived resemblance between himself and a Terran lion, and
between the lion and a housecat, and (b) the relationship between
humans and housecats, the Aslan will simply be uncomprehending
when you do the "here, kitty" thing on him.  Analogously for
Vargr, K\'kree, Zhodani, Solomani, et cetera.  Note that "et
cetera" includes other humans from other cultures as well; the
problems and the techniques I describe in this article are no
less applicable to other humans from Terra than to any documented
Traveller societies.

The most effective insults require that the _insulter_ know the
_insultee\'s_ culture.  That way, you are telling your target "I
know how you expect people to behave and to think, and I don\'t
think much of it", _in_addition_to_ any insult inherent in the
phrase used.  Thus, it would be _very_ insulting to an Aslan
warrior (a male) for a human to suggest, for example, that he
(the Aslan) is "better as a technician than as a warrior".  Aslan
technicians are female; the separation of gender roles is _very_
strong in Aslan society, to the point that even outcasts - who
couldn\'t survive without learning gender-inappropriate skills -
would never admit to knowing any of them, even to another
outcast.  You can bet the farm that an Aslan warrior would find
this highly insulting; whether you\'d survive long enough to
collect the bet is an interesting problem in itself.  Additional
effectiveness is added when you can deliver the insult in the
target\'s own language, colloquially; it emphasizes your presumed
knowledge of the target\'s culture.

The key is not to fix on something that you perceive in their
characteristics or culture that dovetails with yours; it is to
lock onto something so key in _their_ culture that there can be
no possible mistake that you know exactly what you\'re saying
(again, colloquial knowledge of the target\'s language helps
here).  It also helps if you already know what some of the worst
insults within their culture are; you might get an idea of what
subjects are taboo even in insults.  Then, use those subjects.

I always prefered to think that the military used DU rounds
because they\'re economically and environmentally conscious
and they want to do their part in recycling uranium.  After
all, it\'s pretty expensive stuff.

As to the radioactive concerns, I\'ve worn watches that

This \'electro-magnetic vandalism\' is merely an application of an
Electromagnetic Pulse, EMP for short, and presumably all milspec systems
in a post TL-7 ish culture (ie: _after_ nuclear weapons are widely
deployed) would be hardened against it, since that\'s a major effect of a
nuclear blast.

You might want to check out Silent Death by ICE.  I find the combat 
system extremely fast and is quite fun to play.  You might even be 
able to come up with a simple conversion system for converting

higher UV).  Another had created a kind of symbiotic lichen which grew on
their skin and fed oxygen into their bloodstream in return for other

I\'ve only been skimming this thread, so this may have already been
discussed, but I just had some ideas I thought I would share.  It\'s been
argued that a ship inside another can\'t jump because it\'s within the 100
diameter limit of the larger ship.  But there must be some sort of limit
as to what kinds of masses can prevent jump, otherwise errant bits of
space dust near the hull would cause ships to misjump all the time.  

One might counter-argue that dust near the ship is taken within the jump
bubble and jumps with the ship, but this is just beggin the question, as
the "jumping dust" is still to close to the "non-jumping dust" at the
threshold of the jump bubble?  Since the dust inside the bubble is part of
the jumping mass, wouldn\'t it have to be 100 diameters from the dust
outside? BTW, you can substitute "particle"  for dust in this context and
get the same argument. Actual grains of dust might be sparse enough to not
prevent jump, but what about photons and other particles with very small
mass?

I\'ve always thought the original "100 diameter limit" was actually meant
to be a gravitational amplitude limit, and they just used diameters for
simplicity\'s sake.  A gravitational gradient limit still has the
dust/particle problem, I believe, as (if I understand the concept
correctly) the gradient around a particle is going to be just as steep as
around a planet.  

Just some ideas...
Charles.

Simple - call it a "police action".  ;-)

More seriously:
     - check out the various assignments in Mercenary and High Guard
       (or just use the MT Player\'s Handbook) such as
       Counter-Insurgency, Patrol, etc;
     - create a number of scenarios based on these assignments:
          - small anti-guerilla (or anti-Ine Givar ;-) ops;
          - border patrol duty, such as:
               - customs;
               - anti-Sword World incursions;
               - contain a plague ship (and then try to explain to
                 other Impies why YOU are not plagued - old Challenge
                 idea!), etc;
          - military assignments to Efate;
          - security duty at one of the Imperial target-range planets,
            possibly involving being on the wrong end of a
            "friendly-fire" incident;
          - interdiction exercises (eg. at the site of the Battle of
            Two Suns);
          - put them in the Frozen Watch, only to be woken up in the
            middle of a live-fire "border incident" (hey, I _really_
            like this one - an idea for a freeform (LARP), anyone??);
          - Special Duty assignments:
               - Special Weapons school;
               - attaches to Imp allies/client states;
               - aides/bodyguards to a general/admiral who is
                 visiting the Darrians or Five Sisters etc...

If you want a mixed service bunch, have some as Navy and some as Marines,
serving in the same IN squadron. You can even add Scouts, serving aboard
attached auxiliaries.

Hmm, is that enough pointers?

Another thought is from an old Challenge article (#29??) - actually run the
PC\'s through military college and then start them in the service. Sorry, I
can\'t remember all the scenario ideas from this article at the moment -
maybe someone else can look them up?

Any more ideas, folks??

This is the detailed, \'right\' way to approach the problem.  Fortunately,
there\'s an incredibly useful simplification available.  Take p as the
body\'s density, Earth=1; r as its radius or diameter, Earth=1; g as the
surface gravitational acceleration, Earth=1. 

  g = pr

Really.  That\'s it.  Cool, huh? :)

I\'ve used Mayday quite successfully to teach vector movement in physics
class. The kids have a ball, and a game lasts 5-10 minutes once they get
the hang of things. Can you find a copy of Mayday?  (This is essentially
the CT system with hexes instead of miniatures.)

You won\'t find anything that mimics SW/B5/ST and is realistic yet simple
as a melee combat, although the B5 system from Earthforce Sourcebook comes
close.

Dom (and others) can vouch for Full Thrust, although that is probably too
complicated for what you want to do.

Yeah, of course.  WEGs problems weren\'t do to its industry habits, but to its
relationship with its parent company, no?   TSR could blame much of its woes
on that Williams person.   I said the dynamic was bigger than that, but my
point was just that the game will have to adapt.  That T5 must be more than
reprinted vanilla LBBs  that wouldn\'t be glanced at by the New Gamer (tm) if
it\'s displayed right next to a copy of Alternity or ST:TNG or SW:R&E or
Trinity, much less all of em (w/ the smaller competitors).   TNE was on par w/
anything from TSR at the time, but T4 (nor even G:T) couldn\'t say the same.
The real flashy stuff was just coming in IIRC.

I wasn\'t complaining about the lack of utility of the main G:T book (hardback,
i wouldn\'t touch the softback w/ the obviously fragile binding).  I knew it
wasn\'t going to have anything other than the sidebars, that I didn\'t pretty
much already have and/or want, from browsing the softback pretty thoroughly.
I\'d buy it again.  I want to support Traveller and G:T (in that order),
especially for things that will work for me and my campaign.  BtC and Zhos and
Vargr should prove useful to my nascent Regency campaign.

There will be appropriately more material in Mercs & Far Trader as there is in
Btc as compared to the Spinward Marches, but i\'ve been noticing a few errors
in BtC that aren\'t significant but are annoying.  I don\'t know if SJG is
adhering to a schedule it can\'t keep up with.  If it is, i think they shoul
purposely alter their schedule to 1/3 months or *something* to avoid obvious
similarities with IG.  I\'m referring to things like the starmaps and the
red/amber zoning and the difference in practice on the maps and the
explanation of the key.  That sort of thing.  I don\'t expect a flawless and
flashy manuscript, but I am not the gronard who will buy anything just because
Traveller is stamped on teh cover somewhere.

That said, if Mercs and Far Trader live up to the expectations that are being
piled upon them, i\'ll most likely buy them, but only have after a fairly
thorough inspection in my FLGS.   : )

It won\'t be "realistic" with the capabilities of Traveller weapons and sensors
(which are what make the long distance ranges), but you could probably use the
vehicle rules for close in stuff?  Ranges would have to be much much shorter
and a general brain fart and/or deliberate ignoring of the long range
capabilities.

I showed my players the cover of Brilliant Lances w/ the Aurora Clipper and
its escorts (who still probably wouldn\'t be in that tight formation unless
that was a seperate BR Task Force, which is still probably just an artistic
rendering) firing off way into the distance.  Then told em a bit bout the
ranges and the size of the hexes and acceleration measured in Gs.  Also the
sizes of various planets and Sol (mentioned in BL and BR).   I\'ve since
acquired the BL designers notes, which would help too.  

> keep getting caught on things like:  "What do you mean, I can only

You\'re using G:T or another system, i take it.   For BL it\'s 10 shots/ 30
minutes at standard levels.  Overpowering is possible to a ROF of 800 / 30
minutes for lasers (though that requires massive power and extra design size).
Outstanding success means two hits.  The others are ranging shots, etc.

Hmm... combative and argumentative players...  "Because them is the rules"

I would usually have at least one of the BL/BR maps always unfolded and w/ the
planet/whatever there.  When there was a bogey detection, i would determine
distance and then unfold the appropriate maps (or go for the big rolled up
mat-one i got at my FLGS) and place the bogey counter.  I never found BL
cumbersome like many here apparently did, but of course, i\'ve always used BR
for NPC ships.

Hmm... sounds like they\'re out for vehicle combat in space.  That\'s what I\'d
advise, if u\'re not going to be able to get them "real" Traveller space
combat.  Hope that\'s useful.

This has been gone over ad infinitum.  This also goes into real handgun
lethality (another done to death topic).  Using the instant-kill quick kill
(as opposed to the recommended double damage) would simulate "the 9mm test"
accurately enough IMO.  This ignores using different dice for firearms damage
(d10s is what i used, though i jokingly considered d12 to both increase
lethality and use the dice i hardly ever use <g>) and using something like the
T2k/M2k/or DC "quick kills,"  of which i prefer the T2k (increases wound level
to the next step).    

Again, like i said, not perfect, but as close as we\'ve found for us.  A shock
type rule might\'ve been in order.  I once experimented by cutting the hit
values by half but found accumulated damage became too lethal.    Maybe
something simple like only half hit capacity from any one particular wound?
Or a certain damage threshold?  I don\'t find it broken, but i can see how some
might dislike it, especially w/ the differing perceptions and opinions on
handguns and their lethality.

D\'oh!  You\'re right, of course.  That\'s what I meant (i know, yeah right).  It

In either case, hundreds of tons of this stuff is still sitting around in
Iraq and Kuwait.  There\'s a school of thought that thinks dropping

Probably a good thing.

Well, Vietnam was a \'chemical\' war.  Agent Orange contamination is still a
problem there.

The link between "Gulf War Syndrome" and DU has been speculated on.  It\'s
not proven either way.  I tend to suspect the chemical connection, myself. 
There\'s also the theories about the undertested drugs the US, but not some
of the other allied troops were given.

OBTRAV:  Cleaning up worlds after wars is a real hassle.  Even with dampers
and so on, it would probably take years.  There are probably worlds in the
Spinward Marches where they\'re still cleaning up after the FFW.  PCs could
encounter contaminated sites, that, of course, they have to enter.

SuSAG, the main CBW system producer in the Imperium would more or less
permanently be dealing with lawsuits and threatened lawsuits.  SuSAG\'s
methods of doing so aren\'t necessarily nice.

BtC also contradicts CT Alien Module 1, where it describes some junior sons
in leading positions in their clan, and one of them indulging in a little
treachery.  I would say that the statement in BtC is too hard line, but
it\'s really up to the individual GM.

Alien Module 1 describes a case where a clan couldn\'t afford to send out a
fleet.  The second sons hung around in junior and advisory positions.  They
weren\'t entirely happy about it, but they did it.

AM1 has an ihatei fleet taking over existing Aslan worlds.

Well, there is regular Imperial/Aslan trade, so the Aslan know the way.

I would suspect, and have suggested before, that the smaller client states
in Trojan Reach, such as the Senlis Foederate are having a really bad time.
 It would be even worse for those that aren\'t Imperial allies, like the
Belgardian Sojourn.  

Maybe it would be worth converting the canon Trojan Reach subsectors to GT
format?

We have examples of both.  The fratricidal example was clearly socially

Maybe.  But the clans do war against each other, and it\'s a safe bet
captured territory gets colonised.

Transports also carry equipment.  Potentially they can go for a year or
more outside Hierate borders.  Also, most colonisation is, by preference,
peaceful.

Ihatei movements are more like mass migrations, rather than invasions,
IMHO.  Take a look at the "Barbarian invasions" of the Roman Empire.

Get out a copy of Mayday and let them go at it.  Mayday uses 100
minute rounds and takes two hours to play through.  After that they\'ll
be cured.  20 minutes will be lightning rounds!

LOL.   I\'d advise taking up golf anyways.  A good game... ahem sport... to
play.  : )

FWIU, the key word here is \'depleted\', as in, \'barely radioactive anymore\', as 
in, \'we used it up & now it\'s just layin aorund\'.  It\'s dense and carries a 
lotta kinetic energy.  Good enough for government work...

I\'ve never seen one of these puppies up close.  I\'ll take your word on their 
radioactivity, as I didn\'t notice them pulling the ammo out of lead lined 
boxes on CNN during the war.  What I *will* say is, if I was hit with a 30 mm 
antiarmour round, the *LAST* thing I\'d be worried about is how radioactive the 
round is.  Course, I\'d most likely be *dead*.  30 mm is a big round that\'s 
gonna make a big hole.  *NOT* something you\'d wanna take elk hunting; there 
wouldn\'t be much elk left after you hit it...

Can\'t do.  I\'m a bit too crippled up to pull it off.  <frown>  Though mebbe if 
I used that 12 gauge driver I saw in a movie once...

ObTrav:  Do they still golf in the 3I?  Are they still exporting Scots 
greenkeepers to service these golf courses?  In the Principality of Caledon 
(an Imperial client state in Reavers\' Deep that tried staying neutral during 
the first part of the Rebellion), golf is alive and well.  *The* premier golf 
event is the Andrew\'s Cup Invitational on Caledon itself, held once a year for 
the last *thousand* years!!

  IIRC, T5 (or even a colourized TTB) would have some real advantages over
Alternity, as the latter is rules only (_two_ books required? $$!) with the
background being separate. The rules do seem well done, but it still seemed
to me that there was a distincy air of space opera involved - well, more than
is customary in Traveller products, anyway :>

  Sure, I wouldn\'t complain if a new Traveller rules book had colour illo\'s
(although page after page of Foss art in a section in the back...), but I\'d
prefer content and layout before the art goes colour or takes up more than 10%
of the page area (not necessarily counting diagrams). I picked up a lot of later
TSR product second-hand last year, and the amount of space wasted on blank half-
columns and lousy artwork was absurd - in some cases the amount of artwork was
so excessive that the product would\'ve been compromised even if the surplus
weren\'t recycled or bargain rate filler.

  It seems that there were unfortunate (and possibly unavoidable) time
pressures on some of the early releases, and Mercs may be one of them;
however, that problem appears to have gone away, and the Far Trader
sections that have been play-tested to date were flogged within an inch*
of their lives with plenty of time to spare.

noted with some interest is that all the drive dTon useage is not all drive.
The size of the *compartment* is correct, but the drives themselves are
anywhere between 10% and 20% smaller than the compartment.
        Is this a non-standard assumption on FASA\'s part, or do most folks
doing deckplans make the same concessions?  I wonder, because I am
invariably unable to make a hull fit into its dTonnage if I actually try and
lay it out in a fashion based on my Wet Navy experience with machine rooms
and control spaces.
        Just curious wha\'ch\'all doin\' in this respect.

        Over all, I liked the designs.  I liked the orbital platform the
most, as it is a great bit for any game environment...  small,
single-purpose platform, of which any busy world might have dozens above it.
Heck, it might be an "apartment" building for orbital steevadores, given its
layout.  Some of the other designs were obviously attempts to shoe-horn all
the components into the shape given to the designer by the artist....  The
"Endeavour" class patrol frigate is a good example....

        Myself and a friend last night ran a scrimmage between a convoy and
a few high-speed raiders last night.  All ships were TL10, and in the
250-300 ton range.
        Does agility not count against any attack *except* meson fire?
Since my TNEC campaign is Max TL11, the only way you can build a meson gun
is with a spinal mount.  All the ships I have got designs for are all high
agility, since I *thought* the last time I did any HG combat agility was a
DM against all attacks.
        However, we were looking at the attack roll modifiers, and the only
weapon that mentioned it was meson guns.  Which radically changes the entire
design philosophy for a low TL fleet...  who cares about agility, pile on
the armor!
        So, to get to the point =), am I missing some errata?  Does the
target\'s agility affect all attack rolls or just meson gun attacks?  Thanks
for any observations.

        --Michel

        PS:  If anyone cares, I can post the turn-by-turn results;  short
version is that the convoy defeated the raiders.

Actually, everyone so far has been missing one set.

Chainmail gave birth to the LTBs (Little Tan Books), the LTBs gave birth to
the Blue D&D Basic Set, which was made with the dual intent of getting new
players into the game, and codifying the rules a little better for the
upcoming Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. After the release of the AD&D books,
the D&D line was kept due to grumblings by fans and the desire to have a
simpler, introductory system. When the first Red D&D Basic Set came out AD&D
and D&D were completely different product lines. Rules were significantly
different in some ways. Around \'83, both the AD&D books and the D&D line
(now with an Expert Set as well) got a complete visual overhaul. The AD&D
books stayed exactly the same on the interior. The D&D books were rearranged
a bit and clarified. In the late 80s, AD&D published a second edition, and
in short order the Basic Set got a new edition, a bigger box, and cardboard
miniatures. Recently, AD&D want into a new printing with art changes, but
the exact same text. D&D may have gotten a new edition as well, but if so I
never saw it.

AD&D has had two distinct editions. D&D has had the LTBs, the Blue Basic,
the Red Basic, and the "boardgame" Basic, and possibly one more, that\'s 5
editions.

I have every one of the books I speak of, so if anyone needs more info on
any of them, I can fill you in in private email.

It depends on how recent the stuff was. In TSR\'s "Dark Days" they turned out
some real crap, and began to depend on the "churn" (new players who enter,
buy the hardcovers, shelve them, and go away) to make all of their money.
Since WoTC has taken over, their quality has improved so much it\'s actually
_astonishing_.

WoTSR has attempted to win back the old school (getting back with Gygax for
one, printing a new Greyhawk line, and reprinting "Tomb of Horrors").
Further, they have had some impressive "maintenance" releases as well. In
this case, by maintenance release, I mean books that really appeal to people
who seriously play AD&D as opposed to the casual consumer. Their 4 volume
Magic Item and Spell Compendiums are amazing. They break every single "new
player" rule in the book, (little art and dense text). However, TSR has the
consumer base to support these types of books.

Most chain was supported at the shoulders AND the waist.

As a ex-SCAian and armorer I\'d like to churp in here. My original set of
full plate circa 1650\'s designs weighed in a 85 lbs sans helmet. It
wasn\'t *very* encumbering but heat did become a problem. The hardest
thing about it was breathing in a closed helm.

Later versions, including the suit now packet away became increasingly
light, with the use of (gasp) aluminuim as the primary material (Hey, it
looked as good and was down to 45 lbs for the same coverage!). "Loose"
joints rather than "hinged" articulation made it almost as flexable as a
leather jacket. The weight was distributed over several points, the
shoulders for the breast and back, the hips for the upper legs, while
the lower legs actually rested somewhat on the upper boot.

A note about kilts. They actually were one of the best ways we found to
cover the areas between the cuishes and the breast and back (in
particular the butt!), heavy material was flexable and padded the area
somewhat. The next best was leather straps suspended vertically.


OBTrav:

Plastics and laminates would probably increase armor factor, while
decreasing weight. I\'ve always pictured battle dress as hard shells
attached to some form of flexable body suit of ballistic weave. The
joints "float" over the various areas allowing great flexability, while
the body suit contained coolant channels to prevent over heating (Plate
tends to really trap body heat). One neat additin that came from my sons
jaunt in the Marine Corp. is the "Camel pack" he uses, A bladder carried
ruck sack like in the middle of the back, He clains to fill it with ice
and water and wear it under a field pack on marches, where it cools him,
as well as providing a cool drink as needed.(Wish I had one when I was
still in the SCA!).

Douglas\' kilted Marines, IMTU, would wear their kilts in battledress. A
kevlar lined kilt of an appropriate tartan, to cover un armored areas,
since from the bottom of the breast and back to the thighs are an area
the NEEDS to be flexable.

Hum, I still think that impact would be a problem unless the armor was
powered.

I agree, a "coat of plates" type of armor is extremely flexable. Of
course ALL flexability depends on how taylored the armor is. Properly
fitted even plate it surprisingly agile, while poorly fitted armor of
any kind is a really dexterity minus.

Lawyers are the larval form of politician.  It\'s a good thing not many mature to that form, but the rest are still a pain.

It\'s like one of my characters said once:  "St. Marx right.  Shoot lawyers *FIRST*".

SHIP\'S DESCRIPTIVE PARAGRAPH

Capital-class Convoy Escort (Type AE)
TL 10.  330 tons. 
        Using a 330-ton, connical hull, the Capital-class Convoy Escort is
designed to protect Frontier convoys against piracy and privateering.
        It is performance-rated at jump-2, 5-G acceleration and 19.8EP
        Fuel tankage for 118 tons supports the power plant and 1 jump-2 plus
1 jump-1.  The ship is fitted with fuel scoops and a purification plant.
        Adjacent to the bridge is a computer Model/2 with a redundant
computer Model/2.
        There are 6 staterooms, no standard low berths and no emergency low
berths and.
        The ship has 3 turrets. There is one triple missile turret organized
as one battery and one triple beam laser turret organized as one battery.
For defense it has a triple sand-caster turret organized as one battery, an
armor belt of 2 and an agility of 5.  There is a 15-ton magazine and are no
nuclear weapons normally carried.
        There are no ship\'s vehicles.  
        Cargo capacity is 0 tons.
        The hull is fully streamlined.
        There are 0.1 tons of waste space.
        The Capital-class Convoy Escort requires a crew of 9.  A Pilot,
Navigator, 4 Engineers and 3 Gunners are required.  
        The ship costs MCr377.83, including architects fees and takes 56
months to build. The Capital-Class Convoy Escort is routinely found in the
employment of private organizations, and has the distinction of being the
first non-UN commissioned warship design.  Normally, corporations wishing to
protect their Frontier convoys against piracy and privateering own these
ships.  However, some small EscRons owned by private individuals exist,
available for hire by corporations or planetary governments requiring some
extra muscle for a short time.  
        The UN-DSN does not mind the existence of these craft, as they are
rarely encountered on the wrong side of legal considerations.
        First ship launched in 2088, production on-going to present.
Requires 56 weeks to construct.  72 of these ships have been built to date.

muscle for a short time.  The UN-DSN does not mind the existance of these
craft, as they are rarely encountered on the wrong side of legal considerations.
        First ship launched in 2088, production on-going to present.
Requires 56 weeks to construct.  72 of these ships have been built to date.
Lead ship is the UNMS-Moscow.

My \'quick fix\' for this was, roll 15+ on 2D6 for an M-drive failure.  DM -1 *cumulative* for each combat turn (20 mins) running in redline condition, DM + best engineer\'s ENG skill level.

For ex, a ship is running for the 5th combat turn in the redline.  That\'s 100 mins, or almost 2 hours!!!  The \'redline\' DM is +15, the best engineer\'s skill is ENG-3, so it\'s DM -3, for a total DM of +12.  GM rolls a 2, and the ship keeps on going for one more turn.  Had the GM rolled a 3, the M-drive would have shut down pending repairs.

One question.  How would you deal with the old Athenian system?  Many
of the executive offices in classical Athens were selected from the citizen
population by random chance.  Kind of like the way juries are selected from
a pool of candidates.

These offices weren\'t *elected* but they weren\'t run by direct participation
either.  How would you classify them?

(Incidentally, this system has been fairly rare in democratic practice but it
does appear to have its advantages -- I\'ve been hearing a few reformers
suggest reviving it for certain applications here in the States.  Given the
diversity of cultures and political systems in the Third Imperium, I wouldn\'t
be surprised to see it pop up from time to time.)

Cambridge, MA is certainly not a low-law level area.
Machetes are banned, double edged knives over 4cm are banned,
ownership of chemical sprays (mace for example) require a 
background check and a police issued license.
All longarm (rifle/shotgun) sales are recorded & tracked.
Pistol permits can be denied at a LEO\'s whim.
All firearm owners are tracked in the same database the
state uses to track convicted criminals.

Ob-Trav:  In such a setting, players will need streetwise skill
to obtain weapons without such legal hassles.

OK, Agility helps determine initiative under HG.  Agility is also used on the 
Missile, Beam Weapon, Meson Weapon, and Particle Accellerator tables.  Agility 
is affected by Pilot skill as well as powerplant output.  The Pilot DM is 
determined by dividing the Pilot skill of the ship\'s command pilot by 2, 
dropping all fractions, and adding it to the ship\'s agility.  Agility must be 
at *least* 1 for this to take effect.  I.E., who cares *HOW* good your pilot 
is if your ship\'s dead in space.

Pilot skill is detailed on pg 44, the Missile & Beam table is on pg 45, and 
the Meson & PA info is on pg 47.  Emergency agility is on pg 28.

That would be interesting to see, especially if the corrected die rolls indicated a different result.  <grin>

or in units of measure:

looks like p*r gives kg/m^2 when we want meters per second^2

Try g=pr for a gas giant:

usually quoted as ~2.5, and that may be at some inner surface (your

One of the nice touches of T4 was Sylean heavy revolver.  A noble\'s weapon.
Crafted by custom gunsmiths with detailed decorations.  A suitable holster
and belt are a nice touch.

The *big* problem with infrasound as a weapon is that unless you are
using reflectors that are more than a wavelength in size, you wind up
with an essentially omni-directional signal. 

And since the wavelength is related to the speed of sound, that gets
*really* impractical. Using 750 mph (1100 feet/sec) as the speed of
sound:

freq	wavelength
- ----	----
 5 Hz	220 feet
10 Hz	110 feet
15 Hz	 73.3 feet
20 Hz	 55 feet
25 Hz	 44 feet

That covers the entire useful range of infrasound.

Ah!

	"IMPIES GO HOME!"

According to an ex-biker I used to know, one of the scariest moments in
his life was in a cantina in back country Mexico. *Way* Back country.
The kind of place the Federales visit only in squads, when they visit
at all. He and a couple of friends had stopped in for a drink and a
bite to eat. Then from behind them they heard "Hey gringo...."

What happened after that sounds like a Traveller adventure. Right down
to making their escape under fire!

But the protectors can *think*. An expert system can\'t come up with a
solution not embedded in its ruleset. A human (or protector) *can*. Or
at the very least, has an *enormously* larger ruleset.

Sorry, but you obviously don\'t program computers. Computers are *not*
"smart". They are downright *stupid*. They are merely *fast*. They can
only do "simple" operations. But they can do so far faster than a
human. They can\'t do complex reasoning. Protectors *can*, and can do so
better than humans.

Ah! But those posts are about a *career* of piracy. The protectors only
need to grab a few ships, and since they are after *info* they can do
so in exactly the sort of systems where piracy works best.

Incorrect. It\'s a matter of "curvature of space". An artificial gravity
field, such as in the ships, has *no* gradient (except at the edges of
the field). That is, the *slope* of the field remains constant. 

The rate at which the slope *changes* is what the drive is sensitive
to. And even a *small* mass can have the required rate of change if you
are close enough. Inside, the *natural* g field changes oddly since the
mass distribution *isn\'t* uniform. That field is added to the
artificial field, causing changes that people won\'t notice, but a j
drive might.

You\'d need a mass distribution map of the ship (in 3 d) as well as some
messy calculations to determine *how* the curvature changes inside a
ship or even close to it.

I came close to doing that in a D&D game. One of the players was
about to teleport into a stasis field. :-)

(I\'d have handed the sheet back... once enough time had passed. Heck,
 the field was dropped only a few game years later.... :-)

Check out the practices of the British Army between say, 1700 and 1900.
Ditto for the French Army and those of other "colonial" powers. Heck,
Traveller is *based* on the period before telegraphs and steam made
travel and communication so fast.

I get the impression that "leave" tended to get used for *local* R&R,
as there really wasn\'t the time to go elsewhere. 

However, I also get the impression that NCOs and officers (and maybe
even enlisted) could get "detached duty". This allowed them to wander
around getting into (and out of) trouble without being AWOL. This
tended to be restricted to "lifers" (ie personnel who had signed up for
the full "20 years", as opposed to a single "term") as that way there
was no worry about their term of service running out while they were
detached.

I doubt that there\'d be a true "leave of absence". Detached duty is
more likely. For example, if an an officer (or sometimes even an NCO)
is going to attend college to gain some skills/training that will make
them more useful, they are "detached" to the college. They are thus
still in the service, and subject to regulations, except as modified by
the orders detaching them.

Jason,
You might not like to hear this,but here goes:
IMTU, I run starship combat so fluid that many referees may cringe. I 
use phrases like, "The enemy vessel is at medium range, and has fired a 
pair of missiles. They are locked and homing in. Who is targeting the 
vessel and who is on missile defense?"
Make the rolls.
"Turret one fires, the beam laser missed."
"Turret two fires, laser strikes one missile, and now the other one is 
closing into short range. Your sensors display has marked the radar lock 
in bright red for your immediate attention due to threat level. You may 
only get one more shot at this one Turrent One;
Will you take it?"
I never bothered to tell the players how long starship combat lasts, 
unless we discuss it. Why drag out this twenty minutes of time unless 
there is a reason to do so? (If you are specifically trying to build 
tension in the players, then drag it out all you want...) Otherwise, I 
know I would simply be glued to the screen waiting for the results of 
the shots anyway.
:)
Remember, Jason, I\'ve been called a Dramatist. I plead guilty.

Let me guess - only if the engineer is from the Principality of Caledon or
related states.

Of course, on their ships, everyone is called "Scotty"...

10g *bursts*.  It was mentioned that they can work rather well under 4 to 5 g 
accelleration for long periods of time.  4 to 5g\'s was their \'standard\' cruise

Maybe current Solomani tech expert systems can\'t, but they\'re what, TL8?  3I 
tech is more on the order of TL14 average, with TL15 max (except for the 
occaisional TL16 world).  That\'s a difference on the order of from the 
beginning of Solomani human history to the present.  Previous canonical 
sources (cf \'Kinunir\' Adv 1) indicate that limited artificial intelligence is 
possible at TL15, which punches the hole into that argument.

Not with present day technology.  But with TL15 tech?

And yes, I *do* program computers.  I\'m *VERY* aware of current computer 
software limitations.  I just don\'t expect them to remain limitations into the 
53rd Century.

I agree. 

Doug\'s GenCon suggestion is a *good* one.  The hard work of
organizing would already be done for us, all we\'d have to do is sign
up, book rooms and show up.  Of course, I\'m not too enthused about
being in a crowd of 30,000..even (especially?)..30,000 gamers. 

On the subject of why no NATS...

Well, I ain\'t no Yank...I\'m a true-grey Southern boy...but I get

I don\'t know why we don\'t have a NATS, let\'s organize one.

Now, that\'s a trip, I could make!  ;-> And we DO have

It might make more sense to pick a two or three Cons scattered,

About deck plans, Marc has said that he always takes things and spreads
them around. For example, instead of the bridge being exactly 100 tons, he
would use it for accessways, galleys, etc AS WELL as the "bridge proper". I
guess this extends to the power plant area. Certainly the stateroom tonnage
is spread around as other things, such as the ballroom on the subsidised
liner, circulation space, and other common areas.

Marc\'s final rule-of-thumb is that, if the plans are within 10-20% of the
specs, they are acceptable.

Of course, this doesn\'t help the 3D modelers out there who cannot reconcile
the Empress Marava plans (400t worth!) with the given stats of the ship
(200t).

Although, I wouldn\'t go that far, I do tend to agree.  Randomized,
or at least, semi-random character generation is an important part
of Traveller to me.  Although, I had problems with TNE, it\'s chargen
method was close enough to *Traveller* for me to use it.  Something
more like MT/CT Advanced would have been nice as an alternative, and
would be for GT too.

Different strokes for different folks.  I don\'t have anything
against the points based chargen in GURPS (other than my tastes),
but would like some random and semi-random options.

I\'m sure there are people all along the spectrum on this issue.

My general rule of thumb is equipement takes from 50% to 75% of allocatedvolume,
generaly closer to the 59% mark. The rest is access. FFS1 stated
that certain componants could be treated this way.

   Sulfuric acid is the single most important industrial chemical
on earth. Rest assured that whatever chemical industry you have
can use all of it they can extract from the atmosphere and
probably more. It\'s possible they would have an air liquefying plant:
that\'s another way to get it. Sulfate minerals might be more abundant 
and  cheaper than we find them.
   Extraction from the atmosphere probably beats mining
and burning sulfur, which is our principal source of sulfuric acid.
About half of what we produce is used in the production of
fertilizers. Probably the second use is to remove the oxide
coating that develops on freshly produced hot steel (pickling).
It and its compounds are used in explosives manufacture (starting
with black powder), in lead-acid batteries, petroleum refining,
and as a reagent and catalyst in all kinds of other chemical
processes. 

> Is Gypsum useful for anything ?

At least in the Western US, it\'s commonly used as a building
material.  (A primarily gypsum product sold in 4x8 foot sheets, 
trade name SheetRock is used for paneling on interior walls.)

An international "register ton" is 100 cubic feet, and is supposed to
represent the volume of an average ton of cargo. Whether this is a long ton
(2240 lb) or a short ton (2000 lb) I don\'t recall. "5 metric tons per
displacement ton" is a good quick and dirty rule of thumb.

Don\'t forget: most cargo does not physically fill the hold space it
occupies. There is wastage for packing, blocking, bracing, tie-downs,
access and inspection, recirculation (liquid bulk), etc.

Some of it is unitized for handling, generally on metal pallets the size of
ISO container bases (with or without side strakes).

Lumber and steel plate that loads as general cargo normally requires
shoring to spread the weight out across the deck, tie-downs to prevent
shifting in transit, etc. Lumber further requires spacers between layers,
to prevent water or humidity from standing between layers and ruining them.

Even so, it is quite possible to overload a general cargo ship with dense
cargo. The captain normally takes on as much of the heavy cargo as he can,
then "tops off" with lighter stuff.

I seem to recall, by the way, that bagged coffee beans wind up being one of
the densest-packed cargos.

	I have always assumed it to be to your left if your feet are

	IIRC, coreward (when used in stellar cartography) refers to
	the geographic center of the galaxy rather than the Imperial 
	core.  An imaginary line running from the galactic core through
	Capitol is considered zero for the Imperium\'s mapping (IMTU).
	Any point can then be defined to spinward/trailing, coreward/
	rimward, and north/south of this line.

</gduke@orca.esd114.wednet.edu>

IIRC, Galactic North would be towards the observer as you look at a trav
map.  It\'s towards one end of the axis about which the galaxy rotates, so
it\'s orthogonal to the coreward/rimward and spinward/trailing directions.

BTW, this ties in nicely with the thread about 2D vs. 3D space and "what
is the biggest hand wave in Traveller" question.  I would tend to agree
that 2D space is the worst one.  Jump drives, contra-grav, etc., can all
be accepted as future technological developments based on better
understanding of the universe and so on.  But we know right now that the
universe is 3D, that\'s not going to change, so it makes it impossible to
suspend disbelief.  

I like the "jump space is 2D" solution.  I think the canon references to
"real" directions pose a problem for this, but not a huge one.  Directions
only have to be roughly correspondent on a large scale (The sleeper ships
from Sol) and in certain isolated local cases (The Darrian Te Zuyez). Yes,
it\'s arbitrary and overly convenient, but so are a lot of things about
jump space (time unit is a week, distance is a parsec, etc.).

One of these people has (repeatedly) announced that I\'m just an alias for

It was avalible for a time as freeware, but I\'m not sure if even that is an
option anymore.

I still have the files for Reft, Deneb, and the Spinward marches, if any

There might also be copies in the Missouri Archives (at least they are 
available on a site somewhere, I can\'t remember where though). They are also 
available with much other software on the HIWG CD.

I already (or we already) have most of the MT rules scanned, just not 
proofed. And yes we do have permission from Marc for this project. Although 
admittedly it\'s taking a lot longer than I hoped (everybody wants it, just 
nobody wants to help enough; my fault to in part).

I also have permission from him to republish any of the licensees material in 
CD format (provided of course I can track them down and get permission; I 
have three so far, a probable fourth; and everyone else is in the air). 
Currently the several of the White Dwarf articles are available.

I\'ve also had permission to post to my web site magazine articles from JTAS 
and Challenge (provided I get the authors permission). Several are available 
currently.

Hee hee, thanks Bloo.  I appreciate a good plug.  Thought I\'d add the
cow-eyed, pleeding remark that your purchases from The Traveller Trader
("T3") help to support Downport.com in it\'s mission to provide a Traveller
domain on the web.  I try not to do too many shameless plugs on the list,
but it\'s been awhile so I guess it is time.  Also, I have created a
"tasteful" banner ad for T3 that I would like to find places to post.  I can
offer reciprocal links.  It\'s worth a visit to see what I have done even if
you aren\'t buying.  I\'m trying to run a Traveller-only shop and would
appreciate comments and suggestions about it.  The direct links are:

Try Leisure Games in London http://www.leisuregames.com IIRC or
http://www.btinternet.com/~leisuregames or Best Books and Games in The
Palace, Slater Street, Liverpool. Both do mail order. There is also a game
shop in Harlow IIRC. If you\'re not a BITS member I\'d recommend joining as
many of the LBBs are available to the member\'s in an auction at prices
lower than the usual 2nd Hand dealer. BITS is at http://www.bits.org.uk/
and I am biased in recommending joining as I run the website (update RSN).

I would recommend that you do not buy Starships for T4 as the designs are
broken and the version of SSDS needs errata. Instead, download the bugfixed
SSDS from the Missouri Archive (linked off BITS) and visit some sites on
the Traveller webring to get designs. Andrew Akins\' spreadsheet for FFS2
(needs Excel 5 IIRC) is great for ship design - if you have a Mac look at
the low cost QSDS software by Rob Prior (also at BITS). The Starships book
does make a good emergency mouse mat.

My real recommendation is that you get hold of Traders & Gunboats for CT (I
got this off BITS for 7), and get bugfixed QSDS1.5 or SSDS.

FFS2 has flawed equations ( a typo replaces the multiply sign with
doubleheaded arrows) but a number of sites on the Trav Webring have
solutions and errata. Otherwise, FFS2 looks useful but in need of a
spreadsheet or a scientific calculator.

It was based on my refutation of his claim that 600,000 NWO troops were
poised to seize control on the night of July 3rd this year.  (Funny how you
didn\'t notice it happening, ain\'t it?)  My labeling him a putz was all the
proof he needed.

It was an awesome post, I wish I had saved it.

GCE? Gearhead Cognition Error?

Craig Barnett did some work on vectored & unvectored thruster modules back in
digests 182/183. Though for some reason he used 1760 pounds to the ton. 
Mumble American units mumble metric mumble.

Anyone care to explain the cost of GTL12 thruster modules to me?
I calculate them at MCr 0.65 each (GT lists them as MCr0.29 each).

It\'s a bug; they\'re computed at $40/lb.  After it was pointed out, the general decision was to ignore the problem.

Actually, You dont!

I agree with you there. BTW, i darkly recall that someone once said that he
scanned the complete MT rulebooks and put them into some format or another
(dont remember wheather it was PDF or html).
As a own multiple copies of the game-books (dont ask, you cant have them...), Id

Actually, something like this exists:
A small german Company (never heard of them before or after this product)
reprinted the GDW alien modules+alien realms into one big hardcover.
Its absolutely beautifully made, but the price tag is a great obstacle, 
as it costs about 250 Marks (~140 USD) without shipping.
It can still be ordered from Fantasy Encounter (http://www.fanen.de)

An example:

A place where I used to work would get rolls of 75 mm wide steel band on
wooden pallets to turn into tubing for condenser units and the like. Each
pallet was roughly a meter square (actually a little longer parallel to the
tines of a forktruck), with the rolls on top of it stacked 5-6 high so that
the whole package weighed about a metric ton (2,200 lbs.). These skids were
less than half a meter high.

The pallets were never stacked in the semi-trailers they were shipped to us
in because they were so heavy. Instead, we would get shipments of mostly
empty space, with the steel skids laying on the floor of the trailer,
strapped down to keep them from shifting around during transit.

I imagine a metal-laden free trader\'s cargo bay would look very similar.
Lots of open space, with the cargo low to the floor.

The one I have is for the Diaspora Sector and yes it\'s Windows 3.1 but will

Certainly the Imperium would claim this authority.  I\'m not so certain that
they would always attempt to exercise it.  Trying this kind of stuff out on
the K\'kree, for instance, tends to lead to \'incidents\'.

In fact, I think that the Imperium claims a great deal more authority than
they actually exercise, if only to allow the authority to be exercised by
Imperial forces on the spot, whenever they deem it necessary.  This is a
bit like the Imperial Warrant thing - an open-ended clause in most imperial
decrees including the authority for the IN, MOJ or whoever to "take such
other actions as are required to protect the peace and security of the
Imperium", with a court-martial waiting for anyone who messes up.

I suspect Planetary Navies and space-capable COACC forces would actually be
responsible for most policing of the systems that possess them.  In fact,
many "planetary" governments would actually be "system" governments,
controlling their moons, belts, gas giants, and anywhere else of economic
importance, to the limits of their ability.  Of course, their authority
would be subordinate to that of the Imperium - they would not have the
right to interfere with Imperial installations and shipping, and would be
subject to trade regulations and treaties.  Their actual rights would vary,
depending on the terms under which they joined the Imperium, the presence
of Autonomous Regions, or aliens not fully included in the Imperial
mainstream (such as the Jgd-Il-Jagd (spelling?)).

In short, the Imperial claim that "The Imperium rules the space between
worlds and leaves the dirt to the 
worlds itself." would be substantially modified in reality, even if it is
true in theory, and can be invoked if required.

I suspect most Zhodani-Imperial trade goes through intermediaries - Vargr,
Sword Worlds, Arden, etc.  There would be direct trade through places like
Esalin, and there would also be the odd Joe ship going all the way in to
Regina, Jewell, or Vilis, or maybe even deeper.  Imperial ships would
occasionally go into Joe space too.  The Zhodani and the Imperium have
actually spent a lot more time at peace than they have at war, and there
are credits to be made trading between them.

More to the point, IMTU, I\'ve usually used boarding and search procedures
rather sparsely.  Even when PCs aren\'t carrying anything dubious, it tends
to get them killed, if only through stupidity.  The best time to introduce
this stuff is early in a campaign, to get them used to normal procedures,
or, of course, when they\'re smuggling.  Once you know that they know not to
do anything stupid it can be assumed to be routine.

Of course, all this stuff really only applies in a \'civilised\' interstellar

You should probably ask Marc for a license to distribute

It depends on the geology of the planet the meson gun is sited on. If we
assume that the sensor array can get to an altitude of 100km above the
surface of the planet (?a big if with appropriately layered planetary
defenses?), the array can look 60km below the surface of the planet.
	This means that deep meson sites on an Earth-like world would have to
be sited in the mantle to avoid being seen. The extremes of heat and
pressure makes this an unlikely place to build anything.
	On rockball and iceball worlds without active internal geology, you
could bury your meson guns pretty deep.
	In any case, neutrino sensors would pick up any significant nuclear
reactor (given that neutrinos readily pass through planets without much
fuss). Triangulation may be possible, thereby eliminating the need for a
densitometer \'lock\'.

You have already thought about low berths and commo gear.
	Situations may arise where some passive sensor may need to be running
(e.g. avoiding detection by enemy vessels) ; the sensor recognises a
friendly ship\'s signature and transmits a tight beam message ("Over
Here!" or "Help!").
	It may also be worthwhile having the life-support system ticking over
minimally to prevent undue heating or cooling of the ship (depends on
local environment ; a liquid hydrogen boilover could be problematic,
say). Vacuum is a good insulator though, so venting the atmosphere and
keeping everyone \'on ice\' is probably a preferable strategy.

I hope these thoughts may be of some assistance.

I reckon that anagathics, genetic sequences, some medicinals and
possibly stem cells or organs (between lower tech worlds) would be hot
commodities.
	At TL 8, what would you be willing to pay for a cure for your cancer?
Limb regeneration for your amputation? Repairing your sectioned spinal
cord?

I agree with the lawyers on the list that the Imperium doesn\'t really
care (unless the compounds could also be used to violate the Imperial
Rules of War, but this is unlikely). It is a matter of individual worlds
to determine what\'s legal or not in their jurisdictions.

IIRC, in economic terms, it is estimated that drug trafficking is the
second or third largest industry in the world, based on the volume of
money moved about.

In the Imperium, I think that mercenary medics are going to be around
(perhaps not as common as soldiers for hire), as per the \'Mercenary
Doctors\' thread about two months ago.
	Smuggling of any sort is probably common ; drugs are high value low
volume goods - an ideal commodity for the smuggler!

	Sorry, I\'m not sure I can buy that one, as it depends solely on the

to be the same regardless of the numbering system you use, as Hiver

	Unfortunately, my understanding of the original topic of discussion
was that jumpspace had LESS dimensions than our space ... hence the
classic hex map represented the jump space relationships between
locations in real space ... a mapping from 3D realspace into a 2D
jumpspace, which begs the question of how you get the mapping back.

	Unless Grandfather is keeping track.

	The original discussion, at least as I perceived it, was a rehash of
the old handwave about why Traveller maps are 2D, in that they are
supposed to be a representation of a 2D jumpspace corresponding to 3D
realspace. Which is where I have a problem. If you don\'t have a
one-to-one mapping, you can get from 3D to 2D fine. But then multiple
3D points map to a single 2D point. Now how do you get back? When you
come out of jumpspace, you don\'t come out at infinite realspace
points, you come out at one single point. And it\'s repeatable. A
3D/2D mapping doesn\'t work that way.

	BTW, I\'m not in any way trying to shoot down how anybody runs things
In Their Traveller Universe. I\'m just yakkin about why I don\'t do it
that way and exploring the idea a bit further.

	If you do get permission, please reserve a copy for me (I can prove
I own a [water-damaged] set of MT manuals ...). I figure Marc\'s
currently trying to read 6.02x10^23 emails from people asking for
permission, so I won\'t bother him directly ...

	OK, I changed my mind. More specifically, Richard Hough explained it
in terms that make sense to me. So now that *that* minor stumbling
block is out of the way, I\'m warming to the idea of jumpspace being
2D, and hence the 2D maps. 

	This would also handwave why a jump error can take you J36 when
controlled jumps only can go J6 ... it\'s an artifact of how the
"mapping" back into realspace occurs. And theoretically, then, if we
ever truly understood jumpspace, we could actually predict and make
use of that. Right now, though, we\'re limited. Think of it as an
analogue to only being able to understand whole numbers, not
irrational numbers ...

500 grams, or half a kilo. Close enough to the Imperial pound, which
is 454 grams. My mother is originally from central Europe, and grew
up with the metric system -- but in her neck of the woods, they did
use "pound" (500 grams) as a unit of measurement.

I have no argument with the rear-facing bridge.  However, I would think
that, on a ship intended to land, the best placement for a bridge would
be someplace that can view the landing approach.  I\'d consider putting
the jump drive on Deck B, and the bridge on Deck D, so that the bridge
would have a view of the ground.

Just my Cr .02, of course....

I said "in my opinion". I don\'t know how you rank these things, but 2D
space is the one that bugs me the most. It\'s also the most unnecessary one.

Jump drives violate laws derived from detailed observation of the physical
universe, but 2D space is not even our physical universe. For example,
electromagnetism as we understand it can\'t exist in 2D.

IIRC, a form of nuclear beta decay is affected by electromagnetism, so I\'d
be careful about claiming nuclear dampers among "the biggest departures
from hard science".

Well, first you have to get within 160 km of a deep meson site.

I\'ve always ruled that densitometers and neutrino sensors do not have
enough resolution for fire control. You can use them to detect the
existence of enemies, but not target them. This explains their absence from
the basic starship combat rules.

We were talking about the movie, Cube, which was on sci fi.  They

three coordinate system, could not only describe your position in 3d

but also the position in time.

He argued that if you go from a higher dimension to a lower dimension
you will lose
one reference.  You will not be able to get back to the higher
dimension.

Therefore, I am thinking that hyperspace being 2d won\'t work, even the
map as
a representation.  You can\'t get the 3d aspect back.  Therefore,
hyperspace
should be a higher dimension.

The map is a 2D representation, because, well, its easier to show it as
2D (just like
its easier to show the solar system as 2d on a sheet of paper, but all
the planets do

Granted (that\'s why I asked the follow-up question of what _would_ be a
useful range).

In starship combat, I would agree (I would use them as "cueing" sensors
in starship combat).  However, unless the deep meson site is located in
an area with significant void spaces, such as extensive caves (which
would themselves draw the attention of densitiometer-equipped ships),
even a "near-miss" with a meson gun would tend to damage fixtures within
a deep meson site (due to transmission of shock waves through the
rock).  An analogy would be depth-charging a submarine in World War II. 
Even though the sonar of that era was not sufficently accurate to ensure
destructive engagement, the near-misses caused damage to submarines,
thus reducing their combat efficiency.  The addition of neutrino sensors
would help improve the "fix", thus increasing the chance of damaging the
deep meson gun\'s power plant.

Thanks for the input.  Expect newer AuricTech Shipyards military designs
to reflect the need for greater range on both densitometers and neutrino
sensors (at least 5000 km, preferably more), in order to deliver
accurate meson fire against deep meson sites.  (Of course, densitometers
and neutrino sensors are rather costly.  _Well_ in keeping with
AuricTech\'s design philosophies....)

It is actually cheaper (in the UK) to buy it like this than buy all the

The metric pound weighs exactly 500 grams, or was it 250 grams, damn, you
got me confused now, and its late.
I think it was 250...
I am vaguely aware that in the US, a pound is slightly less than that.

Don\'t change too quickly.

Whilst it is mathematically possible to have a 1:1 mapping between a 2D
and a 3D space, jumpspace clearly isn\'t 2D - try walking around a ship
with multiple decks.

I suppose that it\'s possible that jumpspace is 3D but the Z dimension
is only a kilometer or so, but then the jumpspace map would be really
crowded. Or maybe (as has been suggested before) jump space is a stack
of 2D planes but you can\'t move easily in the Z dimension.

Note that jumpspace is clearly 3.5D at least - there is a time axis after
all.

Expect the power supplies for a deep site to be lots of small generators
well distributed to reduce signature.

Also expect the designers to drill lots of false caverns and don\'t forget
that they have an entire planet to play with.

The PDB(ETD) solution to this was a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber of
500kt displacement, mocked up to look like a Tigress (essentially
a vast fuel tank).

You then fit all the sensors facing inwards and when the deep site
fires at you, observe the internal explosions to get a track back to
the site.

Having a deep meson site is much like a citadel in a walled town.
It deters people from being annoying but if you have to use it,
either help had better arrive quickly or expect everyone to die.

My take on it has been for some time is that jumpspace is 3d but that normal
space is represented in jumpspace(s) as a "terrain" (maybe of energy rather
than matter) - not quite 2d, the irregularities in the terrain are what support
navigation. 

While the terrain is apparently flat it could be part of a very large sphere
(eg the galaxy might be a sphere in jumpspace).

The jumpspace z dimension is (at least apparently) infinite - current
navigation is fairly crude as to how far in the z dimension you end up from the
realspace terrain - the small journeys which take place in the z dimension at
entry/exit to/from jumpspace are what determines the slight variations in jump
times

The jump "planes" could be multiple planes but I\'ve had it that they actually
relate to the distance from the "reality plane" - an orbit closer to the sphere
would cover more "ground" at the same "velocity", but the closer you are the
more energy you have to expend resisting the pull of the reality plane. The
trade-offs between this resistance and distance travelled result in only 6
viable "altitudes".

I think I got the idea from Niven and that this is broadly how hyperspace
worked in the known space stories - but I just checked the story I thought it
was - There is a Tide - and it doesn\'t seem to be the case, or at least it
isn\'t openly stated there.

I did, but got no response. I took that to mean he wasn\'t interested in giving

Erwin,

I, along with alot of others, would _love_ to have online copies of the MT
manuals. I\'ve tried scanning them in using a rather decent scanner and the
outcome is still unacceptably bad.

I\'d be willing to send any nonsequential pages from each of my MT
manuals as proof I have them. After all, if I get on online copy, I don\'t
really need the books, right?

Besides, if my books are damaged, then I can\'t sell them and your having
individual pages from my books won\'t make you any profit either.

It may be quite a pain for you, though, to keep track of which people are
sending you which pages.

About the only other way this could be worked is for you to sell the
manuals on a CD and give Marc M. a cut. *I\'d* pay for it!

Just some thoughts which can be freely ignored...

David

I am not sure I understand the requirements, does it matter I have never
bought MT stuff? All I have bought are LBB\'s and the compiled "Traveller
Book" and T4 M:0. I would love to sign up for some MT though.

I can do proof-reading, but I am not familiar with MT to notice errata
specific to the setting. Unless it is a contradiction in the material at
hand.

	I have no doubt that the Traveller maps were writen in 2D for

	have tinkered with 3D fixes, they\'re not really that hard). On
	the other hand, representing the solar system on a 2D map is

	Is there a canon reference for this? IIRC Traveller maps have

North, being a directional, should refer to a consistent point.  If it is on
the axis of galactic rotation, how far from the midpoint of the galactic
plane would it be?  Projected out to the axis\'s intersection of a sphere
encapsulating the galaxy?  The term Galactic North would seem to say it is
only relative to our galaxy and not the universe in general.

I think jumpspace would have to be 4D+, or 5D+ if you count time as a fourth
dimension in our universe.  The relationship of jumpspace to
realspace/normal space would therefor be akin to the relationship of 3D to
2D, so a 2D map might be a good reference for travel between systems via
jumpspace.  The effects of the gravity wells represented by the major bodies
displayed on these maps might have some sort of nulling out factor for the
difference in the Z coordinate since it would be small relative to the
overall gravitic field of the galaxy which is largely planar being a disk.

This would mean that standard jump drive settings, calibrations, and
equations might still be accurate in areas of sparse density such as the
rift and other such Sargasso\'s as they would still be in the main gravitic
body of the galaxy, but would be wildly inaccurate for the space between
galaxies or in a globular galaxy.

just thinking out loud.

Not necessarily. In fact, it\'s easier to just to define a direction as
parallel to a stated vector. The vector we\'re using here is the normal to
the galactic plane.

Well, yes. Each galaxy will have their own North (well, spirals will anyway.
Globular galaxies will need a different system defining.)

It may be, that there was some misunderstanding, due to the fact, that I 
considered your mentioning the Vilani Legal Tradition as dealing with the 
corpus of laws applicable within the empire, while you seem to consider the 
Vilani tradition as part of the corpus of laws of the Imperium proper.

Actually I would think, that the fall of the Vilani Imperium, the Long Night 
and later the rebuilding by an obviously more Solomani influenced Sylea must 
have removed the remnants of Vilani Law from the Imperiums books but would 
also definitely have preserved its institutions on Vilani Worlds.

Thus we should definitely some interesting but unexpected legal customs on 
some worlds, maybe even balkanization of laws like in the U.S., where 
supposedly Louisiana is still Code Napoleon or Germany before 1900, when a 
mixture of corpus iuris/Pandect law a.k.a gemeines Recht ( strangely 
translates as Common Law) and germanic regulations e. g. Sachsenspiegel was 
in existance in the different territories ( some fairly small).

But I think, imperial law will be complex enough even without introducing too 
much Vilani stuff into the laws of the Imperium itself.

One wonders btw, whether there would have been legal institutions as we know 
them in the Vilani Imperium or whether there would have been a strong 
influence of forced mediation/arbitration in their society.

best wishes

Check out the "Copyright myths" FAQ.

Not charging is apt to get you into *bigger* trouble. The violation is
the "making of unauthorized copies". Giving them away makes it easier
for the copyright holder to argue that you\'ve damaged the market for
his work (why *buy* something you can get for free?). This makes
punitive damages ($10-$1000 *or more* PER COPY!) more likely.

You can make copies for your own use (say to keep from getting junk
food stains on the original). But you cannot sell *or* give away those
copies unless you transfer the *original* at the same time. Likewise,
if you sell or give away the original, you must either send the
copies with it, or destroy them.

So you can *legally* copy songs off *your* CDs to a tape to play in
your car or your walkman. But if you get rid of a CD, you have to get
rid any copies you made of materials on it.

The co-ordinate numbers were *way* too small. I had to laugh at the
girl complaining that the numbers (3 digits!) were "too big to factor
in her head". 

Sorry, but the biggest prime factor *possible* is 31 (sqrt(99)). It\'s a
*pain* check for that sort of thing, but given her memory it\'s not that
hard. The primes involved are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31.
2, 3 & 5 are *easy* to check for. Even numbers have two as a factor.
Numbers that end in 0 or 5 have 5 as a factor. Numbers whose digits add
up to a multiple of 3 (or something like that, I\'d have to run a quick
check) have three as a factor. I think there\'s a simple test for
divisibility by 11 as well. It\'s the sort of thing she\'d have known.

Well, it\'s possible to map 3d to 1d, through some convolutions with the
*digital* representation of the co-ordinates. But you lose adjacentcy.
That is, points that are close in s-space aren\'t close in the line.

	This is where I pull out the handwave of the jump field maintaining
a "realspace" bubble within "jumpspace"--hence there\'s a 3D "raisin"
embedded in the 2D "muffin" of jumpspace ...

	The entire bubble actually maps to a single point in jumpspace. It
has to, given that jumpspace isn\'t topologically equivalent to
realspace. Since points close to each other in realspace don\'t
necessarily map to points close to each other in jumpspace, and vice
versa, two points side-by-side in jspace could come out parsecs, or
even megaparsecs, apart in realspace. Bummer if point A is part of my
head and point B is part of my body ...

For those of you desparate to get MT I seem to recall that Marc had some
new copies available at $10 a book last year. Have a look at his website
(linked off the jumpsite page on http://www.bits.org.uk/) and he may have
it listed as still available.

Hee hee, I think the direction in question is *out* from the paper, as in
above it when the map is flat on a table. Perpendicular to the paper. That
is the correct word, right?

Just to be hard to get along with, I\'ve got to disagree.  They\'re good for
filling in a whole in your collection if you JUST have to have every
Traveller book printed.  They\'re also good for taking up valuable space on
a bookshelf.  They make good fire starter....  You get the picture :^)

Directions do *not* refer to points. For example, contrary to popular
belief, "north" on earth is *not* "towards the north pole". It\'s a
*vector* parallel to the earth\'s rotational axis, moving from the south
pole to the north pole.

Likewise, "galactic north" is a direction *parallel* to the galaxy\'s
axis of rotation, not one *towards* any point on said axis. You just
assign one "side" of the galactic core as the "north" side, and thus
points on the same side of the galactic *plane* (a plane perpenidicular
to the galaxy\'s rotational axis) as the "north" side of the core are
north of the plane.

Another quick way to determine galactic north. Hold out your hand.
Arrange your thumb so it is pointing "up", and your index finger is
pointing out (like you are imitating a gun). They should form a rough
right angle.

Now uncurl your middle until it is pointing at right angles to both of
them. 

Maintaining your fingers in thier relative positions, turn your hand
until your index finger is pointing coreward, and your middle finger is
pointing spinward. Your thumb is now pointing galactic north or
galactic south (depending on which hand you used). 

I can\'t tell you *which* hand to use to get your thi\\umb pointing to
galactic north because I can\'t recall which way "spinward" is on the maps!

But to put it another way, if you orient a flat map with coreward to
the top and spinward in the "normal" direction" then Galactic north is
*up*. Remember, it\'s *parallel* to the spin axis of the galaxy.

That\'d be the same as using timers on lights and appliances, which, as

The mass of the cargo would include packing material, dead space,
access space, *and* the material being shipped.  And if the material
wasn\'t some sort of bulk cargo *it* would also contain dead space.
So, in many cases, the *cargo* you\'re shipping is much less dense
than the material that makes up that cargo.  

Examples:         tonnes
                  per m^3
Gold ingots        ~29
Iron ore           ~ 6
Water              ~ 1 
Bulk Grain         ~ 0.7 
Consumer Chemicals ~ 0.5*
Shotguns           ~ 0.3**
Computer Monitors  ~ 0.1***

* 3,500 - 120 ml plastic bottles in cardboard boxes of specialty
chemicals for the consumer market packed in a 1 m^3 shipping crate
(3,500 * 150g) = 525 kg
 
** 100 shotguns packed in a 1x1x1.5 m shipping crate each massing
3.75 kg plus 1 kg for packing (4.75*100)/1.5 = 317 kg

*** Each monitor shipped in a 1 cubic meter cardboard box, with
styrofoam packing, and massing 100 kg per box

See what I mean?

I\'m from the Phoenix Branch of the only Cabinet level Department to have
2 confirmed and 3 acting Secretaries in the last year- nobody wears the
same outfits-except lately the Ally Mcbeal outfits seem to be more
popular for some... and umbrellas would be a total waste here.

Of course every so often I wander around and look at other offices too..

As a damnyankee transplanted to Louisiana, I can assure you that
Louisiana is indeed a civil code state, rather than a common law state. 
It amuses an attorney friend of mine (our game\'s ref, BTW) no end to see
people use "lawyer on a PC" software in this state, as they end up
risking much more in potential legal fees than they save by not seeing
an attorney in the first place.

ObTrav:  As a legal layman, I can imagine five basic sources of legal
decisions:
1.  Arbitrary (the whim of an autocrat; not really law, although
obviously binding in the autocrat\'s realm);
2.  Common law (the source of Anglo-American law; based on judicial
precedent);
3.  Civil code (rooted in the Justinian Code; the source of law in much
of continental Europe and the state of Louisiana);
4.  Divine law (examples being Hebraic and Islamic law, both of which
are meant to apply to both ecclesiastical and temporal matters);
5.  International treaty law (rules that, in theory, bind all signatory
sovereign political entities, such as the Geneva Conventions of 1949 or
the Law of the Sea treaty).

This leads to several Traveller-related questions:

1.  What other sources of legal decision are found within Imperial
borders?  (This category can include non-Terran divine law.)

2.  What is the dominant source of legal decision in Imperial law?

3.  What is the dominant source of legal decision in extra-Imperial
entities (such as the Zhodani Consulate, the Solomani Confederation, or
the Aslan Hierate)?  Legal theorists are asked to speculate on all of
the above-mentioned examples, plus whatever other examples occur to
them.

4.  Are there any major treaties between the 3I and the various
extra-Imperial entities?  If so, what areas do they cover, and what
mechanisms for enforcement exist?

5.  How is the Law skill (from T4; other versions of Traveller may have
equivalents) affected by the presence of multiple bases for legal
decision?

*No* normal material has that high a density. The record for normal
solids is osmium or iridium (it depends on details of how you measure
them) at around 23. Gold is a "mere" 19.3.

You don\'t get into higher density\'s until you are dealing with
degenerate matter. And *that* requires some rather unreasonable
pressures.

This lets out many sessile *animals*, such as sponges and coral.

This lets out starfish. They *evert* their stomachs against whatever
they want to eat, and the stomach produces the digestive enzymes and
absorbs the released nutrients. When they are don, they pull their
stomach back inside.

Plants do this at night.

Many creatures become *less* mobile as they mature.

Ah, you *do* know about Venus Flytraps. But plants turn out to be
capable of a *lot* of "voluntary" motion in response to chemical
stimuli and light.

This gets even worse. You\'ve combned plants and fungi (which are now
seperate kingdoms) and made a few other assumptions. 

There\'s a reason that the current biological kingdoms number 5 or 6. I
don\'t remember the classes for certain but it\'s something like this:

Animals
Plants
Fungi
Protista
????

The last two cover what used to be "prokaryotic bacteria" and
"eukaryotic bacteria".

I\'m not sure where lichen fall in the above scheme.

Well, when you get right down to it, we may not even be able to fit
some alien lifeforms into even the current, expanded set of "kingdoms".
It\'s all a matter of drawing relatively arbitrary lines anyway.

Galactic North as you look at a 2D trav map is *away* from the viewer,
assuming the galaxy rotates clockwise and assuming that spinward, coreward
and north are considered the "positive" directions in our coordinate
system.  Spinward is on the left, trailing on the right, coreward up and
rimward down.  North is into the page, south out from the page. 

Of course, you could take trailing as the positive direction for that
axis, or rimward as positive for its axis, and then North becomes towards
the viewer (use the left-handed three-finger axis trick to see what I
mean).

Of course, I probably have this all wrong...let me know...

    'body' => 'Hello,

I have recently gotten back into Traveller, and have purchased a number of
items lately and have a few questions regarding the various ways of rating
spacecraft for combat.  To clarify, I currently own: FFW, LBBs 1-6, TNE
rules and FF&S, BL, BR, T4 FF&S2, Pocket Empires and Imperial Squadrons.
Some of these I only recently purchased and therefore may not be entirely
familiar with (i.e. if the answer I seek is inside one of these please don\'t
be too harsh).

Within these products are some vastly different ways of rating fleets/ships.
Pocket empires is the most strategic in scope, and very abstract (and I
don\'t much like it).  FFW and Imperial Squadrons seem to be one level down,
and to the best that I can tell pretty much share the same rating system.
Similarly, on the individual ships level it seems to me that FF&S and BL
share the same system, which is an update of the CT systems from the LBBs.
And BR seems to fall in-between the last two groups.

So my first question is:  It seems that Battle Rider has no "design system";
i.e. you can only fight with the ships given.  Has there ever been published
(or has anyone developed on their own) a way of converting from ships\'
ratings (a la FF&S or HG or BL or whatever) to the ratings system used in
BR.  Or is this obvious and am I missing something?

My second question is similar:  Imperial Squadrons tells you how to develop
squadrons of a certain strength based on the economics of a given Pocket
Empire, but is there a way to convert already designed ships into a certain
squadron rating.  Say, for example, you have a BatRon consisting of 3
Battleships (BB Sylea) and 5 Cruisers (CA Mercury).  Is there a way to
determine the BatRon attack-defense-bombardment ratings a la FFW or T4
Imperial Squadrons?

Thanks for any help

We\'ve had some interesting discussions of this on rec.arts.sf.fandom.  It\'s
a odd but true fact that during the Persian Gulf War, the UO rabbis in
Israel gave permission to their followers to turn on the radio if they
heard air-raid sirens, as log as they did it it with a stick or their
elbow, to mark the sabbath.

	There are also animals that absorb food from their environment
	such as tapeworms.

	The last is called "Monera" and includes all prokaryotic
	organisms (bacteria and blue-green algae). The Protista
	include unicellular organisms, though some may aggregate
	into filaments or other superficially multicellular bodies).
	Examples are amoebas, Paramecium, diatoms, "fire" algae,
	Euglena, and slime molds.

>I\'m not sure where lichen fall in the above scheme.

	Lichens don\'t fall neatly in one of the kingdoms because
	they are actually made up of two organisms: a plant and a
	fungus. This is a classical "symbiosis" in which each partner
	gains a benefit from the relationship: the plant provides
	sugar to the fungus which "pays" with improved moisture and
	nutrient uptake. AFAIK, the species of plants (green algae)
	and fungi that are found as lichen are never found elsewhere.

	Yup. Although the divisions of life into kingdoms, classes,
	orders, etc. were not initiated with evolution in mind, they
	are now seen to reflect the common ancestry of related 
	organisms. Thus, any alien life that evolved independantly
	of Terran life would not be included in "Plantae," "Animalia,"
	or any other Terran kingdom. Other biospheres might or might
	not evolve equivelent groups, but they will not be related to
	Terran groups (unless genes have been transplanted).

Actually, plants respirate the whole time. It\'s just that during the day

the creation of oxygen.

Sure do, two places different weapons, it was an article in "White Dwarf" if
I remember correctly, a shoulder fired multitubed accelerator "rifle" anti
armor type weapon.  The name came from the sound made when it hit some
thing.  There was also an hand weapon in a scifi novel of the hard boiled
detective style if I remember correctly.  I do not recall the title but
vaguely remember that it was part of a series.  The weapon\'s name came from
the sound of the round hitting concrete.  The weapon was essentially an
improved i.e. more powerful snub pistol, styled like an automatic in the
classic 1911A1 mold.  The name of the second one might have been a "frump"
gun though.

I liked the irreverence of the Swain character - the way he hated

I think I like the Garret character in Glen Cook\'s fantasy-based private
eye series better, though. Quite a few similarities, of course, as they
were both inspired by the same first-person perspective detective.

Sorry, I probably should have said "detectives" - Swain and Garret were
inspired by a genre, rather than individuals (though the two you mention

Lichen are related to mosses (bryophytes) - so they\'re plants.

I like the Inyx.  They\'re a parasitic lifeform.  "Their original
hosts were whale sized sea creatures that could generate 
electrical currents in the same manner as electric eels."

I\'d still recomment it.  The bang for the buck is still very
high...  The Devi Intelligence are a bit wierd... and defy
any short description I could provide.  btw: They\'re only
8 pages of the book.  The Inyx are also only 8 pages.

The definitions I used were from the dictionary - I didn\'t 
create them... but Leonard Erickson\'s points were well taken.  
My question still stands - why are the Devi Intelligence 
described as pseudo-fungi at all?

It does? It claims to, but all I could find was an armwave in that general
direction. I couldn\'t convert either PE military budgets or ATT/DEF, TRN,
JMP factors into IS squadrons without introducing arbitrary fudge factors.

Going from PE to IS, I finally took 1/10 the PE military size and gave a
planet that many TCr worth of ship squadrons to plug into the base squadron
cost table on p28. IMTU, that gave Sylea with a population of 30 billion at
TL-11, a fleet of about 7 90 kton Federation class battleships (the
predecessor to the Coronation class) and about a dozen 30 kton cruisers,
plus tankers etc.  Those numbers felt about right to me, but if someone
wants to disagree, I\'ll listen to what\'s wrong with them. 
I got so frustrated trying to make the numbers match that I gave up trying
to go the other direction.

 I\'m pretty sure there was one in Space Gamer many years ago. It fired ten
snub rounds in timed sequence to make BIG holes in things. First, IIRC,
were five HEAP rounds in a regular pentagonal pattern, followed closely
by five straight HE in a slightly smaller pentagonal pattern. Made for big
messes, but had a real kick...

A bit of a misunderstanding here... I was not trying to say that you could
convert from the stats of the actual military units as presented in Pocket
Empires (the book), but rather you could build squadrons based on the
economics of your pocket empire (the entity).  If I were to use PE and IS
together, I would ignore PE\'s military units, using my Planetary UPP info to
construct the fleets and military units based on the rules of IS.

Can you give me the UPP of Sylea (I don\'t own any T4 other than IS, PE, and
FF&S2).  I\'d like to see what I get using the IS system.

AHL stats:
Effective=50m(25)+4;Long=250m(20)+2;Very Long=500m(15).

CT stats:
Range:
Close -3, Short +1, Medium +6, Long 0, Very Long, -4
Armor DMs:
None=+5;Jack=+5;Mesh=+4;Cloth=+3;Reflec=+5;Ablat=+4;Battle=+1.
Damage is 4d per shell hit.
The rounds spread out like shotgun shells at long ranges. At Close and
Short ranges, all 10 rounds hit a human-sized target or vehicle; at Medium
range all 10 hit a vehicle and perhaps 4 hit a human. Bu long and very
long range, the "group hits for shotguns" rule may be used, with each of
four adjacent human-sized targets taking two shells each and up to two
adjacent ATV-sized targets splitting the burst between them. Firing at
short range is not recommended unless the firer is wearing battledress,
and firing at close range is considered a very spectacular method of
committing suicide.

For MegaTraveller, I suppose I\'d estimate it as a weapon with Pen/Atten
25/2, ROF 10, Damage 4, max range Very Long, recoil/signature both Hi.
Magazine capacity is 10. Note that the magazine empties itself in one
10-round "shot."

All life is classified into three groups ("domains"); the Archea (also
known as the Archebacteria (I may have the spelled wrong)), the Eubacteria

The Eukaryotes branch out with varous members splitting off
until you get the the three branches for the three "kingdoms"; fungi,
plants and Animals.  (Note, genitically, all these are a rather small "bud"
on the larger tree of life).

A copy of the tree can be found at
http://www.panspermia.org/tree.htm
(It is flakey web site (ignore all that drivel about "cosmic ancestry), but
they have the best picture of the tree I could find on the web.  For more
detail see http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/phylogeny.html)

Plants are that short line going to "Zea" (corn, all the other plants are
left off to make the tree readable).  Animals are the line going to "Homo"
(man).  Fungi are the one going to Sachromyces.  Note, the tree shown is
rooted (it shows the Eubacteria splitting off first).  The root of the tree
of life is controversial and far from settled.  Things aren\'t that simple,
either.  It is known that genes have been laterally transfered between
organisms.

Unfortunately, traveller includes a basic assumption that a lot of
transplanting has occurred....

And, while unlikely, it is possible that some "crossbreeding" might occur.
The odds do severly suggest against it, however.

  For CT I always assumed that the 1,000 kg allotment amounted to fairly
trivial volume at best - assume that the 100 kg of the bulkiest stuff is
in the cabin (clothing and grooming, etc.), and that the rest amounts to
maybe 3m^3 locked up in the hold - if used. A good way to discourage the
carriage of needless junk (you _know_ that some jerks will want to bring
empty boxes just to amuse themselves) is to allow unused luggage capacity
to be applied as a credit towards the bar-fridge tab :>

That\'s why I specifically referred to T4.  On page 75 of FF&S2, luggage
allowances for various types of passage are listed.  Bottom line, the
following amount of cargo hold space is allocated to passengers as
indicated below:

High passage:  14 m^3
Middle passage:  1 m^3
Low passage:  10 kg, which is carried in a .01 m^3 locker (included in
the volume of the low berth)

Note that, for High and Middle passengers, carry-on luggage is _in
addition to_ the allowances listed above, and is stored in the
passenger\'s stateroom.

Having said all that, I do like your idea of providing an incentive to
take less baggage than one\'s passage allows.

Of course, the fact that, under T4 rules, a High passenger brings in Cr
10,000 for 5 dtons of space (rations volume being relatively low), while
a Middle passenger brings in Cr 8000 for just under 2.1 dtons of space,
provides incentive to cater to the Middle passage traffic.

slightly-garbled story about an Australian journeyman soccer player that
would make a great NPC.

The kid gives up soccer at 12, then takes it up again at 17, playing for
Granville in the Sydney competition.

He scores a bunch of goals (his uncle played for Colo Colo in Chile, and
still holds a couple of Chilean scoring records), and an opposing coach, an
old Polish bloke, says \'Look, I\'ve got some friends ... mind if I give one
of them your number\'. He says \'Whatever\'.

Two weeks later he gets a call from a bloke with a thick Polish accent,
asking if he\'d like to come over for a trial game. To Belgium.

He says \'Bullshit\', but the tickets arrive the next day by courier, so he
goes over.

The Polish coach knew an agent in Belgium, they\'d played together in the
\'50s, and the Australian Ned Zelic had done good things in Belgium before
hitting the really big time in Italy, so the agent figured it was worth a go.

The club looking to try him out came last in the first division the year
before, and only just fought off relegation. They were playing a preaseason
match against the team that won the comp the year before.

To cut a long story short, he puts the ball into the back of the net in the
17th minute. The other club claws back another one for a draw later, but
they love him.

He gets signed for a fair chunk of change (Granville\'s cut is enough to put
hot water into their change rooms), and plays in Belgium until his back
goes halfway through the season (it\'s a fair jump from training twice a
week for a club side in Sydney and being a full-time professional).

He goes back home, and then after six months of rehab he gets another call
from his Polish mate in Belgium, who has found him another club. The Army
team in the Warsaw district competition.

Journeyman footballers ... gotta love it :)

Pulling this viciously obTrav, has anyone else used the Polo Grounds in

Well, I have the rules for converting from Declination and RA to
galactic co-ordinates (and hopefully, even the functions buried in a
library). So if someone will dig out a couple of stars that are clearly
placed on the map, and give me RA, dec, and distance for both, I can
attempt to convert them to galactic co-ordinates (along with Sol\'s
co-ordinates) and see whether spinward or trailing comes out "positive".

After all, last I heard we *still* weren\'t if the spiral arms *lead* or
*trail* the rotation of the galaxy.

	Well, sure, but if we use "North" the way it is used on Terra,
	then the direction of rotation of the galaxy becomes the
	determining factor. "Spinward" is in the direction of rotation
	(i.e. East), and Trailing is the opposite direction (i.e. West).
	Coreward is towards the central axis of rotation (i.e. Down),
	Rimward is away from that axis (i.e. Up), and North is the
	direction from which the rotation of the galaxy appears to be
	counter-clockwise (on Terra, North is the direction to a single
	point: the North Pole; however I see Galactic North as being
	parallel to the axis of rotation).

>Of course, I probably have this all wrong...let me know...

	I thought that you guys at McGill knew everything ;-)

	This is true, I would certainly consider Vargr mammals. On

	That is an understatement. We are genetically closer to a

	to a sponge than we are to a maple tree, closer to a maple

	In fairness to the much-maligned taxonomists, although there

	In my earlier post (you probably didn\'t get it before sending

They decided to errata the rulesin that case -- VG + lifting body can do supersonic.  This presumably because VG streamlining generates convenient numbers (20% of volume) and superior does not (23.077% of volume).

Awwww, that ain\'t nuttin.  We got us an HPG to be admired; 72 tons spinning
at 1800 RPM - and an alternator about 30\' long that turns 1/4 of that
energy into 300 Megawatts of electrical power in about three seconds.  I\'m
told the flywheel has about 2 Billion Joules of stored energy (=2 thousand
megajoules?), but I didn\'t do the math myself.

Why?  To make Fusion of course.  It take energy to make energy after all.

Come now, Peter...we\'re onto you. 

We know that you use that thing to power the Meson Gun we bought from
the Greys five years ago. You know, the one that Hillary used to shoot
down JFK Jr. 

The story about the mini-black holes being fired from Sandia labs is
just a cover-up of a cover-up.

:-P

Hey, you! Get away from me with that...<flash>

Not only that it quotes our very own sensors guru, Bruce Macintosh: (I\'m
presuming it\'s him...how many of \'em could there be?)

"The dark material could be a sea of liquid

 Livermore\'s Bruce Macintosh said. "It\'s one of the

 solid organic material." 

I am now desperately trying to find useful rhymes for Titan, and come up

    'body' => 'I\'d like someone to double-check my thinking here. The numbers were
generated using the World Builders Handbook. The only exception is my way of
figuring the temperature when the satellite is being blocked by the
mainworld, those formulas I have made up and that\'s what I want checked.

I broke up the satellites orbit into quarters,
    1 while satellite is between the sun and the mainworld
    2, 3 while the satellite is beside the mainworld (counts as two
quarters)
    4 while the mainworld is is between the sun and satellite.

In the 1st quarter, the satellite has normal effects:
    R = L / Sqrt of D  L=Luminosity, D=Distance from the Primary
R=Rotation-Luminosity Factor.
    R = 0.642 / Sqrt of 0.4
    R = 0.642 / 0.63
    R = 1.02

In the 4th quarter, the satellite has effects as if stellar luminosity was 0
(this is my guess)
    R = 0 / Sqrt of 0.4
    R = 0 / 0.63
    R = 0

In the 2nd and 3rd quarters the effects would be the average between 1 and 4
quarters.
    R = (1.02 + 0) / 2
    R = .51

The satellite has a base temperature of 86 degree Celsius
It orbits the main world once every 5.09 days.
It rotates every 21 hours.

The first quarter gets 10.5 hours day, 10.5 hours night
the second and third quarters: 5.25 day, 15.75 night
the fourth quarter: 21 hours of night

The max daytime plus would be:
    1st quarter: 0.5 x 1.02 x 10.5 = 5.4 degrees C
    2nd, 3rd quarter: 0.5 x .51 x 5.25 = 1.3 degrees C
    4th quarter: 0.5 x 0 x 0 = 0 degrees C

The Max nighttime minus would be
    1st Quarter: -1 x 10.5 = -10.5 degrees C
    2nd, 3rd quarter: -1 x 15.75 = -15.75 degrees C
    4th quarter: -10.5 x 21 = -21 degrees C

Examining hex row 7:

Hottest Day in 1st Quarter:
Base Temp 86 + Lat Mod -12 = 74
Summer Plus +23.4 x Axial Tilt mod 1 = +23.4
Daytime Plus +5.4
Orbit Ecc Plus 0
Highest Possible Temp = 74+23.4+5.4+0 = 102.8 degrees C

Coldest Night in 1st Quarter
Base Temp 86 + Lat Mod -12 = 74
Summer Plus +23.4 x Axial Tilt Mod 1 = -39
Nighttime Minus -10.5
Orb Ecc 0
Lowest Possible Temp = 74 + 23.4 + -10.5 + 0 = 86.9  degrees C

Hottest Day in 2nd and 3rd Quarters
Base Temp 86 + Lat Mod -12 = 74
Seasonal Plus= 0
DayTime Plus +1.3
Orb Ecc 0
Highest Possible Temp = 74 + 0 + 1.3 + 0 = 75.3

Coldest Night in 2nd and 3rd Quarters
Base Temp 86 + Lat Mod -12 = 74
Seasonal Plus = 0
Nightime Minus = -15.75
Orb Ecc = 0
Lowest Possible Temp = 74 + 0 + -15.75 + 0 = 58.25

Hottest Day in 4th Quarter
Base Temp 86 + Lat Mod -12 = 74
Winter Minus -39 x Axial Tilt Mod 1 = -39
Day Time Plus 0
Orb Ecc 0
Lowest Possible Temp = 74 + -39 + 0+ 0 =  35 degrees C

Coldest Night in 4th Quarter:
Base Temp 86 + Lat Mod -12 = 74
Winter Minus -39 x Axial Tilt Mod 1 = -39
Nighttime Minus -21
Orb Ecc 0
Lowest Possible Temp = 74 + -39 + -21 + 0 = 14  degrees C

So, looking at that, it seems that for the 30.5 hours spent in the 1st
quarter the temp ranges from 86.9 degrees C to 102.8 degrees C, then for
then next 30.5 it ranges from 58.25 degrees C to 75.3 degrees C, then the
satellite reaches the dark side of the mainworld and the temp ranges from 35
degrees C to 14 degrees C, then back to the 30.5/58.25, then back to the 1st
Quarter.

Am I right?

THE TITAN WILDCATTERS

Hear about ol\' Titan way out Saturn\'s way
With a nitrogen atmosphere
and hellish nights and days
Then they took a look at it using HST
Seems that they\'ve found some hydrocarbon seas

That\'s oil.  Oceans of it.  Free for the taking. 

So we\'re hoping this oil sets fire to the race
To get us up and running into deeper space
We\'ve tried research and heroes
But all we really need
Is some good old American slavering greed!

Titan Ho!

<banjo solo>

OK, it\'s a little rough.  The scansion is off, and it needs work.  That\'s
what weekends are for.  Now, since I\'m listening to Weird Al\'s parody of
"Money For Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies"...

HYDROCARBONS FOR NOTHING

9AU, 9AU, 9AU away...

Look at those photos, photos down from Titan
Mapping the surface of that distant moon
It could be oil, oil in vast oceans
Oil to make OPEC swoon

We got to build interworld tankers
Space-going refineries
We got to head out to Saturn\'s orbit
Kick start this century

Stop at the asteroids, grab a chunk of iron
Nickel-iron spinning like a wheel
Send it back home, in a slow orbit
Arrives at Earth as a block of steel

We got to build interworld tankers
Space-going refineries
We got to head out to Saturn\'s orbit
Kick start this century

This ain\'t SF, this really happening
Out there past the ice line
The new Gold Rush, and once get on out there
Who knows what else we will find?

We got to build interworld tankers
Space-going refineries
We got to head out to Saturn\'s orbit
Kick start this century

9AU, 9AU, 9AU away... (fade)

Seriously, folks, what\'s out there as far as Traveller support
software these days?  I am particularly interested in Linux/Unix
programs, with an eye toward utilities that can produce nice
spiffy sector and subsector maps, and/or something that does
3D space with links & mapping, like Jo Grant\'s beautiful CHVIEW
program.  So far I\'ve heard mention of and found :

- - World Builder Deluxe
     pros: does detail system generation, spits out various formats
           of text mode files, fast.
    cons: no source code, DOS/Windows, so I can\'t port it or change
          it to tune for MTU.  Uses World Builder\'s Handbook, and
          I\'ve pretty much decided I like First-In/Gurps Space rules
          better. A few bugs you need to look at-- I generated a
	  system around a K2 II giant star with gas giants in orbits
	  0 and 1.  That shouldn\'t happen.

- - TravTools
     pros: cool sector maps in categories I hadn\'t thought of, but
           are darn useful in a campaign.  Nice subsector maps, lots
           of *useful* command line utilities (How do I know they are
           useful?  I once felt the need to write utilities in REXX
	   to do some of the same jobs-- I think those REXX scripts 
           are still in the TML software archives somewhere on ftp.mpgn.com)
           ;-)  Source code--I can port it or tune it.
    cons:  DOS programs, and the source is in Turbo Pascal. I can
           work with that, though.  Nice graphical maps have no
	   provision for dumping to file in, say, GIF or JPEG format.
           It would be nice if you could save the maps somehow...
	   Also, the detail system generation is using MT, not GT rules.
	   Again, with source code available, the features can be added.

- - CHVIEW
	pros: NICE 3d Space map.  
        cons: WINDOWs, no source code. Where is Jo Grant these days?

I haven\'t yet installed someone\'s suite of Traveller tools based
on wxGTK, but it looks interesting, and it runs on Linux.

What else is out there?  Whatever happened to Jo Grant\'s Library/TTG
program?

I made my maps for my website by running it in a DOS window in Win95, before 
I salvaged the Win95 drive and went totally Linux.  You call it up, have it 
make the map you want, then ALT-PRNTSCRN to push it onto a buffer.  Exit back 
to Windows, & paste the map into Paint, & save.  Convert it to GIF using XV 
or Xpaint.

Mick was going to be working on a SVGALIB version after porting it to FPK, 
but he kinda dissappeared over the Australian summer there...  If you *DON\'T* 
have FPK yet, *GET IT*!!!  It\'s a TP workalike for Linux & Windoze.  It\'s at:

I took a fresh look at the problem. The fudge factor I gave
earlier was based on some other estimates and may not be
reliable. PE, IS, and TNE Path of Tears all give different but
hopefully somewhat related estimates for a planet\'s military
forces. I took my "best" numbers for Sylea\'s UWP,  figured its
military with each approach, and compared them. After some
grumbling and headscratching, I have some revised fudge factors
for conversion among these.

1]   Starship squadrons are a base 1 Trillion Credits. IS gives
more detail on a planet\'s military establishment: PE includes
support and maintenance expenses in addition to new construction.
2]   IS combat and transportation factors for starships are about
1/10  of 1 PE combat factor. I ignored Jump Factors and Depot
(base) transportation factors, but included Starship
transportation factors.
3]   Figure SDB squadrons are 1 Billion credits each, with the
limits IS gives.
4]   Each SDB squadron is 1/100 of a PE Combat ATT or DEF point
for space forces.
5]   Defense Battalions in IS correspond to Combined COACC and
Ground forces at the rate of about 1 PE combat ATT or DEF point
per 70 battalion equivalents or so. (Troops carried aboard ships 
are a lot more expensive.)
6]   These fudge factors coulld be adjusted 50% in either
direction and still be about the right order of magnitude.

Which UPP do you want? <G> I have four.
The T4 main rulebook gives
Core 0201 Sylea     A586A98-C HiPop  NS xxx  
(It has its own version of Core sector)
In the text, Milieu 0 (M:0) gives it as
Core 2118 Sylea     A586A98-C           population 14 billion.
In the referee data for M:0 and in First Survey, it is given as
Core 2118 Sylea     A586A98-C HiPop     305  G2 V
On the web I found a "corrected" version of First Survey, (core
sector only) which gives:
Core 2118 Sylea     A586530-C Ag Ni     305  G2 V

All sources considered, the "best" data for Sylea in Imperial year 0
seems to be:
Core 2118 Sylea     A586A98-C HiPop  NS 105  G2 V
MTU is slightly earlier than M:0 with Sylea still at TL-11.

Wow, that was a really intriguing read. Thanks for the URL, but I have one
query. I saw on the page about plasma control a reference to "high field
tokamaks", shouldn\'t this be "high yield tokamaks"? Not to be picky, great
page! :)

Well,

- - The granddaddy of them all, I think, is Galactic. wonderful program, IMHO.
- - Jo Grant has done some work, as you said...
- - Then there is Rob Prior\'s work for you Mac users...the CSC program, GT
Shipyard, and Metator (sp?).

And there are a few of us working on things (like the excellent World
Builder Deluxe), but its rather hard to churn something out when the real
world (job, wife, kids, health) interfere. I\'m releasing an early beta of
some Java 2 Traveller programs for GURPS Traveller, but I don\'t expect it to
be ready for prime time for a while.

Also keep your eye out for spreadsheets - there are a ton of them out there
(insert shameless plug here for my FF&S spreadsheet). There are WBH sheets,
ship design from all rule sets, pocket empires, etc..tons of stuff...

You just gotta look for it :)

I just downloaded and played around with v.5 and I liked what I saw.  I use
WBD quite a bit and I am glad that the new version is even more useful.

My only gripe is the green text on black.  I prefered the old black text on
white.  <shrug>  A minor detail, since I export the data.

Regardless, keep up the good work.

I am looking forward to all of those new features, but I have to say that I
like \'c\' the best.

That would be my fault Keith :)  When Stuart and I talked about doing some
graphics for it, I came up with the green print on black for the system
mapper.  It was black on white (too harsh in my opinion for the mapping),
and suggested green on black.  After I sent a comp to the WBD development
list with this scheme, everyone liked it and Stuart went with it.

Best,

Look at the bright side (for FS, that is, not for Terrans).  Given the
state of Solomani space exploration in the last years of the 20th
century, they may have found it, but they aren\'t going to _get_ any of
it for quite some time.  Plenty of time left for FS to siphon off the
good stuff....

    Do you use rules from Traveller in other games?  For example, I also
enjoy playing Rifts - Phase World & Macross II, both from Palladium & I have
turn Rifts - Phase World into a quasi-Traveller game.  I.e. I have used the
General Background from Phase World, but use many of the ships, Mega-Corps,
Trade & Commerce Rules, World Building Rules & Mappers (World , Sector
Mappers (Galactic 2.4), etc to fill in the gaps in what they have presented.
Has anyone else done this?

	Question...  would a 100Mw chemically-pumped laser, if fired from
the ground be sufficient to incinerate something the size of the Hubble?
Say firing time is in the 3 to 6 second range.  Or would the energy level
have to be higher?  Doing a reality-check on a game situation and was
wondering.  Thanks.

1800 RPM. How quaint! The units on the Urenco site were tested for normal
operation at up to 700 Hz (42,000 rpm) when I worked in the field. I know
the intent was to push this beyond 800 Hz with the generation of carbon
composites they were using. Speed is much more effective than mass in
increasing the power density. Of course, you can gang up a set of these
units in a modular fashion (albeit needing some 75 to 100 to get the same
total *useable* energy). These units weigh in at <1000 kg IIRC, and are
around 500mm dia, 1m height.

Out of interest, does your HPG run to rest when discharging, or do you run
it between resonances to increase life? With the speed and mass quoted I\'d
guess you\'re using a metal based unit, which has some material strength
limits?

Gearhead challenge: Why is the flycylinder arrangement inherently more safe
than the flywheel (disk arrangement)?

BTW - the fusion stuff looks interesting!

That somebody would be me, and it\'s Mark\'s Traveller Utillities
(available at http://www.visi.com/~markn/index.html ).  Yes, even
I think it\'s a pain to install and build, and yes, it still has 
bugs (the list of known ones is included in the tarball).  

Although it will handle a lot of the issues you raised about wbh
and trtools, things like 3d sector mapping and GT isn\'t in there.
I won\'t say they won\'t ever be in there, since the modular nature
of the application allows for replacing the Book 6 method for
system generation (for example).  And, it is Open Source (L-GPL),
so your suggestions are encouraged (although some of the code is
not real pretty to look at).

If you already have it, take the time to try and install it.  If
you have problems, email me, I can\'t address unknown bugs.

I\'m not pushing this thing because, well, I\'m a software geek by
trade not a marketroid.  So, my time is better spent writing code
;)

It\'s terrific. I\'m about to send a group of PC\'s (IISS External Mapping
Branch) into Aslan space to do an extensive survey. Their mission will
require that I have detail system stats, as well as an interesting series of
plot lines to tie it down.  I can see that WB will allow me to spend more
time preparing my plot lines and less generating system stats.

Well, prior to the release of GURPS Vehicles, I used to use the
STRIKER/MegaTraveller vehicle design sequence to create vehicles for my
GURPS Cyberpunk campaign.  I suppose I could have used the design rules
from GURPS Autoduel, but they weren\'t quite right for what I had in
mind--and would have had to fudge too heavily to design my favorite
vehicle from my homebrew GURPS Cyberpunk campaign: the 2019
Mikoyan-Gruevich Roadster (the front two-thirds is a surplus
attack-helicopter turbine engine and a substantial front bumper, the back
third is a cramped crew compartment. It\'s considered the high point of
Russian muscle-car engineering.)

Well, for starters, energy delivered is:
	 (power * time) * atmospheric absorption

Where the absorption is a number from 0 to 1. 

So assuming *no* absoroption, you\'ve delivered 3-6 Mj. For reference, a
"kilo of TNT" is 4.2 Mj. 

So you\'d severly damage it. But it\'d be mostly in one piece. And it
*definitely* wouldn\'t be "incinerated".

To *incinerate* something (actually "vaporize") you need to figure the
mass and "average" composition. Then look up the specific heat of the
material. That\'s the amount of energy it takes to raise one gram (or is
it kilo?) one degree C. So figure what it takes to heat it from the
starting temp to the melting temp. Now you need to look up the "heat of
liquefaction". That\'s how much energy it takes to change one unit of the
solid at melting temp to one unit of *liquid* at melting temp. Then you
use the specific heat again to figure out how much energy it takes to
raise the liquid to boiling. The you use the heat of vaporization to
see how much energy it takes to change a unit of liquid at boiling to a
unit of vapor at boiling. 

In general it takes *hideous* amounts of power to vaporize anything.

Odd, I never throught about it before.  My guess is after (it
doubles your move score, not your basic speed) based on the
wording of the rules.  However, I might go ahead an allow it to
be applied before if I was a GM.

    'body' => 'I\'m visiting my folks in Maryland, where I have a much easier time finding
nautical books than in Colorado. I picked up a copy of
_Modern_Ship_Stowage_, US Dept of Commerce, 1942. 

Broken stowage is "the waste and loss of space caused by irregularity in
the size and shape of packages or the incidence of hold pillars, frames,
deck beams, and other obstructions."

Broken stowage for various types of cargo (not allowing for filling the
space with smaller goods):

Miscellaneous package freight	10-25%
(average probably 15%)
Standard package freight
	Bales				3-20%
	Sacks				0-12%
	Barrels			10-50%
	Cases				4-20%
	Drums				8-25%
	Rolls				10-25%
	Coils				10-25%
Bulk freight
	Grain				2-10%
	Lumber				5-50%
	Stone				5-10%
	Pig iron; ore			0-20%
	Car material			15-35%
	Locomotive material		10-25%

"It will be noted that broken stowage of 15 percent means that 15 percent
of the hold capacity remains unused because there is lost space between
units of cargo. It is assumed that the space is not filled with goods....
Some of these percentages are unnecessarily high, but are given because
they were provided by the stevedores."

These figures are pre-containerization, but there will be some broken
stowage with containers as well: either the cargo hold is designed for
general cargo and there are corners where containers won\'t fit, or the
cargo hold is designed for containers and there is some waste space where
the shape of the hold doesn\'t quite match the shape of the hull.

There are extensive lists of stowage factors in this book, but the only
generic figure I could find was an estimate of 40 cubic feet per long ton
(2,240 lbs). This works out to 1.11 m3 per metric ton, or 12.6 metric tons
per dton. Clothing packed for shipping in wooden crates is as close as I
could find to general baggage, at 2.90 m3/mton or 4.83 mton/dton. Both
figures do not account for broken stowage.

If someone has specific questions, I\'d be happy to look them up.

Side issue: has anyone (former Air Force loadmasters, maybe?) considered
weight and balance in the design of starships and the stowage of freight?
Specifically: can the use of artificial gravity and/or contragravity
compensate for unbalanced loads -- both design loads and cargo -- and if
so, how?

       The Traveller Saga
   Douglas and Kirsten Berry
(music: American Pie, by Don McLean)

A long, long time ago,
I can still remember how the first game stirred my soul
Known Space on the StarForce map
A fist of stolen dice and that[1]
Was all it took to make my dreams take flight

Every weekend at the game store
With my ten hard-earned bucks to buy more[2]
Now twenty years have flown past
Of wars and life and mishaps
I know I\'m not that wide-eyed teen
But I still look up and I still dream
Whatever comes I do believe
I still will play this game

(Chorus)
So say hey, this here Traveller game
The rules set may be changing
But the concept\'s the same
And it lets me travel through the stars and through time
Saying: Gonna play this game \'til I die
Gonna play this game \'til I die


Do you remember when CT
Was only Books 1,2, and 3
and a homespun setting that you wrote
Do you recall Bill and Andrew Keith
Early FASA and JG[3]
All the products out to help us play
And slowly the Imperium came to light
With enemies for us to fight
Then in Supplement 3
We met the Zhodani
It was a glorious time of change and growth
And we couldn\'t ever get enough
So we sat down and wrote our own stuff
And I still played this game

(Chorus)

Then came some folks called DGP
About as passionate as you or me
About this universe we\'d made
They filled in all the holes and cracks
They fixed some rules, they wrote a patch[4]
And changed the way the game was played
But GDW had a plan
Strephon died at an assassin\'s hand
The Imperium fell to war
Much worse than before[5]
And in \'87 we got MT
To play through this galactic catastrophe
But the new rules didn\'t mean much to me
\'cause I still played the game

(Chorus)

For six years, we played through Hard Times
While pretenders fled and planets died
And we wondered how it all would end[6]
Then we got the horrid news
about a Virus that would use
any means to kill humaniti
TNE made its bright debut
While the Old Timers hissed and booed
Much dissent was spoken
The TML was broken!
And while X-Boat waxed on days gone by[7]
GDW up and died
The hard core fans sent up a cry
They can\'t have killed our game[8]

(Chorus)

Then Marc Miller took back control
And promised Traveller like we had before
But did they try to push too fast?
For T4 was a sorry mess
Barely edited and the rest
Of the releases, well they didn\'t shine much more[9]
The authors grumbled we\'ve not been paid
Imperium Games quietly sped away[10]
Then Loren brought our reprieve
A deal with Evil Steve
A return to all those Classic themes
Of hard-sf and future dreams
It may be GURPS, but what the beans?
I still will play this game[11]

(Chorus)

<slowly>
Now twenty years and more have past
From first edition to the last
But the setting is the game to me
I went down to my local store
Where I bought the first books years before
But that store now is part of history[12]
And nowadays the kids play Magic
Superheroes or Vampires tragic
No more the sound of parties-
The quiet hum of PCs
And books for which I once did lust
Sit on the shelf collecting dust
But I have them and that\'s enough
For still, I play this game

(Chorus)

(Chorus)

Notes:

[1] My very first game was played on the map from SPI\'s StarForce game,
using Larry Niven\'s Known Worlds.  Besides the two dice provided in the
box, we raided every board game in the house for extra six-siders. Craig
was the Ref, and I played Beowulf Shaeffer.  I still remember how the last
session ended.  I was mind-controlled by a Grog.

[2] Personal note: As a teenager, I would make $10 a week for cleaning the
house.  I would then spend two hours on buses to blow the remaining eight
bucks on Traveller products.

[3] FASA (publishers of Shadowrun and Battletech) started out as one of the
tiny Traveller support publishers.

[4] Digest Group Publications was yet another fan-run Traveller support
company.  The difference was that they did incredibly good work.  For a
time in the mid-80s, they were responsible for most of the quality
Traveller material out there.

[5] In 1987 GDW killed off the Emperor Strephon to ignite the misnamed
Rebellion setting for MegaTraveller.

[6] The eventual resolution of Rebellion was a hot topic on the early TML.

[7] The use of GDW\'s House System, plus the odd nature of Virus, and the
complete change of setting and assumptions caused a major rift in Traveller
Fandom.  The Traveller Mailing List was actually broken into two separate
lists: X-boat, for classic/MT only, and the TML for all versions of Traveller.

[8] In 1995, Game Designers\' Workshop closed it\'s doors after twenty years
in business.  This of course caused much debate on the fate of Traveller.

[9] Marc Miller\'s Traveller (aka T4) was an ungodly mess of poor editing,
awful layout, questionable artwork...

[10] To the best of my knowledge, nobody was ever paid for any freelance
work done for IG.  I wasn\'t.

[11] When GURPS Traveller was announced, some people took great exception
to the very idea of learning GURPS.  Others took a more casual approach.

[12] The Game Table, Campbell, California.  Remains the best gaming store I
ever knew.  Closed sometime in the mid-eighties while I was in the Army.

Final Note: My spell checker thinks that the most probable replacement for
"MegaTraveller" is "meatball".  Make of this what you will.

This is exactly the reason I got involved in the project some time back.
My PC\'s were \'requested\' as part of their \'Detatched Duty\' to go exploring
and filling in maps and patchy survey areas in Foreven, Far Frontiers,
Beyond and Vanguard Reaches, (and further afield if thier trusty Donosev
will let them!)

One very good thing is that using the Random Number Seeding aspect of WBD,
all of my players can have the source details on their PC\'s to do the write
ups
for their reports out of game time. (They\'ve made \'interesting\' reading).

Because of the seeding, they can run WBD on their machines and get exact
replicas of the information that I have here. I trust them to only look at
what they\'re
supposed to (ie what their characters can determine from surveys)

The only real problem is that I need more hard disk space, (particularly if
Stuart
successfully does the world mapping routines he keeps promising)


I\'m glad you like it, I\'ve enjoyed working on it!

Cheers

This page has detailed (though not yet complete) descriptions of the aliens
of the "Farcast" Sector (a sector IMTU, some distance spinward of the
Spinward Marches), their biology, history, cultures, governments, social

One of my major goals (aside from good background for gaming) is believable,
truly *alien* aliens.

This is a work in progress (updated usually daily), and I would appreciate
any suggestions, comments or constructive criticism from the list.

Thank you VERY much!

	I\'ve always assumed balance taken into account in loading the
starship, and that you could (and did) compensate in flight by
shifting fuel around between different tanks. In fact, that\'s one of
my "stock" malfunctions: something goes wrong with the automatic
balancing system; all piloting tasks are +1 difficulty (trying to
compensate). More of an annoyance than a life-threatener.

O.K. The original hosts had capacitors made from modified nerve tissue
which could be used to generate electric currents (on discharge).
	So the Inyx led a rather marginal existence siphoning off
power from their original hosts. They would probably be more successful
behaving like Chlamydia, etc. - tapping mitochondria directly for their
energetic needs (although I guess this is difficult if you\'re
multicellular).
	We could postulate that the Inyx use the electrons they steal (more
likely to be in the form of \'reducing equivalent\' cofactors, but this
still requires tapping cell contents) to drive their metabolic
processes. This does *not* free them from requiring other biological
molecules and solvent (of whatever type) to survive - \'building blocks\'.

My guesses are as follows :-
1. They alternate between a \'spore\' and a \'fruiting body\' form.
2. They fill the ecological niche of \'reducers\' or \'recyclers\' - they
close
nutrient loops, processing organic material so that producers can use it
again to make biomolecules.
3. Thay are incapable of exploiting inorganic sources to meet their
metabolic
needs e.g. sunlight, heat or chemical gradients.

Reducing alien ecologies to their simplest elements :-
1. Producers - turn simple compounds into \'biological\' ones with the
assistance of external energy sources e.g. green plants and algae.
2. Consumers - eat parts of the producers to meet their metabolic
requirements.
3. Reducers or recyclers - as above.

* Introduction
For surface life, factors that determine climate will influence the 
variety of environment types present.
	A key determinant of climate is the amount of energy available
from the primary and the ability of the world to retain some of this
input. The properties of the atmospheric gas mix are important in this
regard. For example, carbon dioxide and methane are well known 
"greenhouse" gases, as they limit the amount of infrared radiation 
reflected into space.
	The presence of life is critical to maintaining atmospheric
composition. The present levels of oxygen in Earth\'s atmosphere are 
due to photosynthesis. Life with alternate biochemistries using 
gaseous reactants will doubtless affect the atmospheres of their 
worlds in a similar fashion.
	Local differences in the albedo or surface reflectivity of a
planet causes heat gradients to develop in the atmosphere. For 
example, water (oceans) is less reflective than land which is usually
less reflective than clouds.
	These heat gradients, in combination with planetary rotation
(the Coriolis effect), form the basis of weather.
	Solvent (and some nutrient) cycles will have an atmospheric
phase. Vapour will be taken up into warm atmospheric gases, and 
precipitate out as liquid or solid from cold ones - e.g. rain. 
In the case of some nutrients, some living things actively incorporate
compounds into their bodies.
	Three Earthly examples :-
	1. The water cycle. Almost all (over 97%) of water is in the
oceans. Polar ice contains about 2%.
	The balance is in relatively rapid circulation (weeks), in the
form of lakes, rivers, water vapour and rain.	
	2. The nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen is a key constituent of amino
acids and nucleotides, the building blocks of proteins and DNA 
respectively.
	The most important reservoir of nitrogen is the atmosphere. 
Converting gaseous N2 to usable compounds such as nitrates, ammonium 
salts and urea is called \'nitrogen fixation\' and is performed 
predominantly by bacteria.
	Most animals and plants maintain a fairly even nitrogen 
balance except during periods of growth (positive nitrogen balance
as protein is deposited) or illness (negative nitrogen balance with
protein breakdown).
	Urea and purines (one of the nitrogen containing bases that
make up the core of nucleotides) are excreted by animals, and recycled
by bacteria.
	3. The carbon cycle. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the 
\'fast compartment\'. The CO2 living things \'breathe out\' is 
incorporated into glucose by photosynthesis. Significant amounts of
carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans (n.b. : gas solubility 
varies inversely with temperature). Carbonate based rocks e.g. 
limestone make up the \'slow compartment\'.
	Terrain features influence rainfall. As air masses move over a
mountain range, they cool and water vapour precipitates out. The
formation of deserts may be assisted by the effects of equatorial 
heating - warm, moist air masses move to cooler regions,
and dumps its water. The now dry air masses circulate back towards the
equator, creating dry regions in the mid-latitudes.
	The density of plant life also influences rainfall. Plants
produce water vapour from photosynthesis and vent it into the 
atmosphere (except those plants native to very dry climates) : 
transpiration. Increased humidity, in combination with effects on 
albedo, alter the likelihood of rain.

* Soils
The interaction of geology and weather determines what elements and 
compounds are available for plant life to use. Soils are the 
substrates on which plants grow. They are formed by partly by erosion,
but mainly by the action of living things. Their key
function is to act as a reservoir of solid nutrients (and solvent) 
for plants.   
	Essentially, they vary in moisture content, aeration and 
nutrient content. Areas that enjoy high rainfall or are in the
catchment of run-off from hills, mountains, etc. will obviously have
more moist soils.
	Aeration is a function of both animal and plant activity - 
making the soil increasingly fine grained enhances diffusion of 
oxygen, nitrogen and water into Earthly soils, optimising conidtions
for animal and plant growth.
	Nutrients may be either intrinsic to the soil or washed in
by solvent flows.
	Most soils are complex mixtures of organic and inorganic 
compounds. Their fertility or carrying capacity varies with their 
ability to retain nutrients - or toxic materials e.g. clay soils and
aluminium salts.
	
	On other worlds with more acidic solvents, erosion may be 
greatly accelerated and soils relatively better aerated. However the
latter factor may be offset by the decreased stability of nutrients or
their increased solubility (the only large fertile areas may be where
rivers empty into oceans).
	Differences in local gravity, the presence or absence of plate
tectonics, and atmospheric pressure and constitution will also alter 
the rate and extent of erosion and other geological processes.
 
* Energy flows and food webs
Organisms can be loosely divided on how they obtain the energy they 
need for metabolism.

- - Primary producers obtain energy from \'non-biological\' sources e.g. 
sunlight, heat, or chemical gradients (chemosynthetic bacteria in hot 
springs and thermal vents use energy released by oxidation or 
reduction of sulphur compounds).
	They are responsible for making some nutrients available to 
the rest of the community (e.g. CO2 -> carbohydrates ; phosphate -> 
energy containing nucleotides; nitrogen -> nitrate, ammonia -> amino
acids and nucleotides).
	Terrestrial examples : plants and bacteria, green-blue algae,
etc.
	Producers can be further divided into point and area 
subgroups. Point producers are typically single large organisms (trees,
creosote bushes), area producers groups of many small organisms 
(grass, bacteria). This division is a consequence of scaling
laws and niche competition (see below).	
- - Primary consumers eat plants (herbivores) ; secondary, tertiary,
and quaternary consumers (carnivores) eat other consumers. 
- - Decomposers or reducers (e.g. bacteria and fungi) produce simple 
(in)organic compounds that primary producers use again from other dead
organisms. They play an essential role in the cycling of nutrients 
such as nitrogen and phosphorous. 

Food webs are maps that describe how each group of living things 
interacts with each other from a nutritional standpoint.
	There are two broad types :-
	Grazing, where there is enough energy to allow primary 
producers to arise and grazed. 
	Detrital, where the activity of local producers is not 
adequate to supply consumers, so nutrients must be \'imported\' e.g.
some soils, the bottom of a pond or ocean, or a cave. 

At each level, energy is consumed in metabolic activity. Each level of
a food pyramid is 10% the size of the level below i.e. 100kg of 
producers (plants, etc.) supports 10kg of primary consumer (herbivore)
supports 1kg of secondary consumer (carnivore), etc.

This \'biomass\' relation is universal.
Pyramids based on number of organisms may be partly inverted e.g. in a
forest ecosystem, there are a few large producers (trees) with many
small primary consumers (insects, and other herbivores) and few 
secondary consumers (predators).

* Ecosystems and the Koppen classification system.
(examples kindly provided by Leonard Erickson)
An ecosystem can be defined as a \'spatially explicit unit that 
includes all of the organisms, along with all components of the 
abiotic environment within its boundaries\'.
	A synonymous term for ecosystem is biome.

Variation in temperature (available energy) and precipitation ranges
(nutrient flows) are the most important determinants of what types
of biome will appear.
One descriptive system used in geography is the Koppen classification
based on temperature and rainfall.

Koppen classification and example ecosystems
* A : hot, mean monthly temperature > 18 C
Examples :-
Tropical/ dry               Thorn scrub, Savanna
Tropical/ Moderate          Savannah, thorn forest, tropical seasonal
Tropical/ humid             Tropical seasonal or rain forest

Variants : h (average temp > 18 C) or k (average temp < 18 C)
Examples :-
Tropical/ Arid              Barrens, Tropical desert
SubTropical/ Arid           Barrens, Warm temperate desert,tropical
                       	    desert
Warm Temperate/Arid         Barrens, Warm Temperate desert, semidesert
Cold Temperate/ Arid        Barrens, Semidesert scrub,
                            Temperate shrub, Taiga

* C : temperate, mean temperature of coldest month -3 to 18 C

			    Temperate shrub, Thorn scrub

* D : cool, mean temperature of coldest month < -3 C
Examples :-
Cold Temperate/ Dry         Taiga
Cold Temperate/moderate     Taiga, Elfin woodland
Cold Temperate/Wet Soil     Bog.

* E : cold climates, mean temp of hottest month < 10 C
Variant : H > 1500m above sea level
Examples :-
Arctic-Alpine/ Arid         Barrens, Arctic-alpine desert, Tundra
Arctic-alpine/ Dry          Tundra, Arctic-alpine desert
Arctic-alpine/ wetsoil      Tundra, Bog
Polar/ Arid                 Barrens

To this list we can add the following aquatic biomes :-
Rivers
Lakes and ponds
Estuarine & marine mudflat: Coastal shallows
Sandy Littoral              Ocean Beaches
Rocky Littoral              Marine cliffsides
Marine coastal              Ocean floor, lighted. Kelp beds and coral
                            reefs
Marine Benthic              Ocean floor, dark zone
Marine Pelagic              Open sea. (further divided into lighted 
			    zone, dark zone, and near-bottom).

Two other biomes that have been recently discovered are geothermal 
(deep ocean vents, hot springs) and deep rock (e.g. bacteria found in
oil fields and even deeper porous rocks). As noted in the first post,
subsurface microscopic life exploiting chemical and thermal gradients
for energy may constitute much of a world\'s biomass.

Another less obvious biome is the environment occupied by the "aerial
plankton" - bacteria, etc. that waft about in the air around us,
massing 0.1 grams or less.
	On other worlds with lower gravity or chemistry and 
temperature favouring aerostatic flight, the atmosphere might look 
more like the sea, with jellyfish-like \'floaters\' competing with 
bird-like creatures for prey... a common motif for life
in gas giant atmospheres in science fiction.

So in general terms, ecosystems vary in the energy and solvent 
available to them, which influences the amount of life they can 
support. Life\'s presence helps maintain conditions that the ecosystem
continues to florish. In time, however, the effect of life on an area
may cause conditions to change, favouring different organisms.
	This process is called succession and will be discussed in a 
later section.

* Niches, habitats and species interactions
(with assistance from Leonard Erickson and Ian Ferguson)
A \'niche\' can be defined as \'the functional role of an organism 
within its community\'.
Niches are well described in the various Traveller rules (e.g. 
scavenger, hijacker, omnivore, etc.)
	In general terms, habitats can be divided into the following 
areas :- aquatic, land and air. Most organisms span across two or 
more of these.
  	e.g.	mud (bacteria or worms in the lake\'s bottom)
                liquid (algae, snails, crayfish, fish)
                soil (earthworms, fungi)
                gas (deer, bats, bryophytes)
                mud/liquid (sea-weed, clams)
                soil/gas (trees, gophers)
                liquid/gas (whales, waterstriders, ducks)
                liquid/gas/soil (beaver)

	Adaptations to a given habitat are driven by remorseless 
evolutionary pressure, based on the relevant physical laws that govern
it.
	The fish that can swim faster will escape a predator ; its 
progressively more streamlined descendants will eventually dominate 
the watery niche in which it lives.
	So traits that assist survival are passed on (though sometimes
\'bad\' genes hitch-hike on the \'good\' ones).
	
Species interactions result from the interaction of niches and the 
food web.

Types include :-
- -Predation :- plant is eaten by herbivore is eaten by carnivore.
- -Competition :- use of similar resources - e.g. herbivores in a given 
ecosystem
- -Allelopathy :- inhibition of competitors e.g. fungi and bacteria 
making antibiotics, pine trees acidifying the soil around them.
- -Parasitism :- dependence of one organism upon another (the latter 
may or may not benefit from the association). E.g. tapeworm and man
(amensalism) or remora and shark (commensalism).
- -Protocooperation :- a mutually beneficial but non-obligate
relationship e.g. goby fish and pygmy shrimp (the latter digs a 
burrow for the former who catches the food).
- - Mutualism :- symbiosis : mutual benefit, mutual dependence 
(lichens are communities of algae and fungi).
 
* Evolution and succession
Charles Darwin\'s \'The Origin of Species\' is one of the most important
works in all science. In that book, the theory of evolution was first
brought to the attention of a wider audience.
	Drawing from observations made over many years as a naturalist,
Darwin proposed that organisms were in a continual struggle to secure
their place in a given environment. \'Natural selection\' is the term he
used to describe this process and its consequences.
	As mentioned above, natural selection is based upon the 
gradual accumulation of improvements.
	Consider flight as an example. There are many theories as to
how flight began. Given the long history of life on Earth, it was
probably discovered independently several times throughout the 
animal kingdom.
	Wings may have begun as radiators for insects ; as the insects
grew larger over evolutionary time, their radiators grew too - 
eventually attaining a critical wingspan. Halteres or wing stubs still
persist on flies, but act as control surfaces during flight.
	Vertebrates variously sport wings that are modified arms or 
forepaws, gliding membranes between fore and hind limbs and even 
modified ribs. Leaping from tree to tree, or making running jumps
from the ground to flee or catch prey are logical starting points for
the development of flight.
	Lastly there are the cephalopods - octopi and squid can 
forcibly empty their swim bladders to effect \'jet propulsion\'. There
is at least one species of flying squid.
	Vision has a similar history of many independent starts 
(at least forty times). Across the animal kingdom a vast
range of visual systems, from clumps of light-sensitive skin cells
to sophisticated camera and compound eyes can be seen.
	Interestingly, the genes that code for overall eye development are
tightly conserved across species ; there is not very much difference
between those of a fruit fly, mouse or man.

Succession can be seen as a form of ecosystem evolution.
Changes in the environment are brought about by a progression of plant
communities and the  formation of increasingly nutrient-rich soils. 
	E.g. on a sand dune, the bare sand of the beach gives way to
dune grass, then perennial herbs, shrubs, light-loving and 
drought-tolerant trees, and finally shade-tolerant trees that require
moderate to high soil moisture.

There are two types of succession. 
	Primary succession begins with bare rock, sand, or mineral 
soil. Examples are sand dunes or a volcanic blast zone. 
	In secondary succession, nutrient rich soil is already 
present; because of this, changes in plant communities are more rapid 
and are driven by the availability of light and water. An example 
would be an old field becoming forest. 

Sucesssion can be divided into three stages :- pioneer, intermediate
and climax.
	In the pioneer stage, diversity of species is low as the 
supporting plants are small and sparse.
	Over the course of years, species diversity expands greatly as
more plants arise ; this intermediate stage is the \'richest\' one in
terms of diversity and plant density.
	In the climax stage, the environment has matured. Trees 
dominate and support a wide range of animal life.

The flycylinder is equivalent to a group of flywheels with a small
radius. So I\'d go with smaller moments of inertia and a reduced torque
requirement to stop the thing in event of a problem.

My take on load balancing is that while you *can* compensate for an
unbalanced load by messing with "thrust offsets" with the drive, no
pilot in his right mind will do it if there\'s *any* other choice
(Including abandoning the cargo!).

This is one of those situations where a normally survivable systems
failure would be near-fatal. 

This is one of the reason I figure that ships intended for cargo have
"spare" tankage for water in the "waste space" of the hull as well as
carefully space "bulk" tanks. That way you can pump water around to
help balance the load. 

Thankfully, they\'ll have computers to help figure this stuff out (even
a personal laptop can run he calculations in real time. 

The *big* problem is that not only do you need the *mass* of the cargo,
you need some idea as to how it is distributed. That\'s so you can do
moment of inertia calculations for both the ship and for "tie downs" on
things. 

You\'ll need a *much* different tie down arrangement for a container
with the CG 50 cm from one end than for one with it roughly centered.
Even if they have the same total mass.

Luckily, space ships don\'t impart a lot of "twisting" loads on their
contents.

A Billion credits doesn\'t buy many SDBs.  You would only get about 2-4 of
them, I suspect.  Anything cheaper wouldn\'t be able to fight.  

I suggest your fudge factor should be about 10 billion.  That would match
the 1/100 of a PE ATT/DEF point figure too.

ISTR some figure in Invasion Earth, or somewhere like that, quoting SDB
wings as being around 50 SDBs.  The 10 billion figure would give you
something in that order of magnitude.

Just a suggestion.

strange.

In the sidebar on page 56, there\'s the following stuff:

"The Terran Confederation dates as a centralized world government to the
signing of the Treaty of New York in 2022 (although it was not officially
called that for another century).  This treaty allowed the placement of the
armed forces of the major nations of Terra under the centralized control of
the United Nations (until them, a loose organization of nation-states, with
no governmental authority)."

This seems to contradict previous canon, including material elsewhere in
the book.  I also don\'t like it!  My reading of the other material suggests
that the UN wasn\'t a "centralized world government" at this point, even
though agencies like UNSCA were controlling aspects of space operations.

Fortunately there is a fudge - this text is presented as part of a
Vilani-prepared history of the Ziru Sirka.  It could well be incorrect in
its details of Terran history, or be mistaking a loose coordinating body as
a world government.

I would rather not see this suggestion becoming the canon truth - it tends
to foreclose too many opportunities for interesting 21st century "history".

Is this stuff based on Marc\'s article on Luna in The Dragon?

Don\'t worry, it\'s legal on Titan.

Besides, all FS has to do is get there first.  Claiming it as FS property

Supplement 9 says they\'re about 254.5 MCr each at TL15.  Obviously, a 
customised design would let you build 5 for 1 billion.
 
Might take some work, but it\'s do-able.

	I\'ve always assumed balance taken into account in loading the
starship, and that you could (and did) compensate in flight by
shifting fuel around between different tanks. In fact, that\'s one of
my "stock" malfunctions: something goes wrong with the automatic
balancing system; all piloting tasks are +1 difficulty (trying to
compensate). More of an annoyance than a life-threatener.

I don\'t know it could be a life threatener on vessels without contra grav or
inertial compensation such as TL9 merchants. Or even at later TLs where
compensation may be inadequate.

Also, since worlds are more or less spherical, light strikes much of
the planet at an angle from the vertical. The greater the angle the
greater the area the energy is spread over. Thus you get less heating
the farther from the sub-solar point you get. 

For those who aren\'t aware of it, the "Tropics" are defined by two
lines on the globe that delimit the farthest north and farthest south
that the sun can be overhead at noon. 

The Arctic and Antarctic circles are defined by something similar (at a
guess the line where you get a "sun never rises/sun never sets"
phenomenon). 

For a planet with no axial tilt, the tropics and the equator are the
same line. Likewise, the Arctic and Antarctic will be the poles. 

For a planet with a 45 degree tilt, the tropics and the arctic/antartic
circles will be the same line. No Temperate zone. (I do *not* want to
find out whatweather is like there!).

And for planets with greater tilts, not only is there no temperate
zone, but the artic and the tropics *overlap* to a greater or lesser
extent. 

At 90 degree tilt you hit the limit. Climit is best described by
reading the article by an astronomer that is included in the back of H.
Beam Piper\'s "Uller Uprising".

And the biggest limit on growth of most organisms. The phosporus cycle.

Rain, being acidic, washes small amounts of soluble phospates from
rocks (mountains, especially fresh volcanic ones). This gets caught in
the soil or washed into streams and bodies of water. Some seasonal
lakes form deposits of phospates on the bottom. 

Plants extract phosporus from the soil. Animals eat the plants and get
phosporus. Also, animals excrete phosporus (it was first isolated from
the residue of fermented urine). that puts it back in the soil. So do
their bones when they die.

A lot of phosporus gets tied up in sedimentary desposits. 

Calcium follows a similar path, but isn\'t as critical. 

Note that these elements are *so* critical on earth that even nominally
herbivorous animals such as field mice will gnaw on bones or discarded
antlers just to get the calcium and phosphorus.

Also, the deep waters of the oceans tend to be rich in
nitrogen/phosporus. Thus the equatorial oceans are a virtusl desert,
but the areas in the far north and south where the deep currents come
to the surface are the richest fisheries. 

As I recall, at one time the phosporus  was blamed for algae blooms.
Later they started wondering if it was the nitrogen in the same wastes
(mostly treated sewage and farm runoff). 

Trace nutrient requirements can have *major* effects on what lives
where.

There\'s also been some recently discovered evidence that rudimentary
wings on some insects were useful for propulsion (but not flight). Sort
of a water strider with wing stubs. It can (could? I don\'t recall if
this was a current insect or a fossil) skim across the water like an
insectile airboat!

That gives a niche where even a stub of a wing is useful.

It was under one of the right-most menu items - "special", I think.  But that 
was only if you generated an entire system.

I keep running into a file path error when I\'m switching between generating 
one world and generating a whole system (or vice versa).  It will unstick 
after a while, but I don\'t know what I\'ve done to make it disappear.

What I\'d like to see is a "now that I\'ve got a nice world, generate a system 
that this fits into" and "now that I\'ve got this nice system, show me all the 
separate worlds stats".  It looks like you should be able to save one and 
generate the other from it, but I\'m evidently not doing it right.

Can anybody give some straightforward instructions please?

Define \'incinerate\' -- objects in orbit can\'t burn, which is the normal definition of incinerate.  That\'s also dramatically (several orders of magnitude) too little energy to actually vaporize the Hubble.  However, it\'s probably plenty of power to disable the Hubble if it\'s focused in a small area, most satellites aren\'t very tough.  Of course, an unlucky shot might just kill a solar panel or something similar.

No, for starters he\'s delivered 300-600 MJ (100 MW * 3-6 seconds), equivalent to maybe 100 kilos of high explosive.  However, he isn\'t delivering the energy fast enough for explosive vaporization (unless he happens to hit a coolant tank) so the damage is even less efficient than a comparable amount of high explosive.

Jens Maskus:-

I assume your trying to generate system maps for single worlds. The system
mapping function only works when a system is generated (Kinda makes sense?)
The system map can be viewed by selecting the \'View\' menuitem or by opening
the GIF file in the System folder once the system has been generated.

WBD uses MT system generation rules. If a gas giant is present in the
habitable zone of a system then the mainworld becomes a satellite of that
gas giant. I was quite surprised myself to find out just how frequently this
happened.

The problem is that WBD is trying to create a World/System folder which
already exists. The best way to resolve this is if you are going to
duplicate the generation of a World or System rename the previous files.

The System Generation routines only accept input from a WBS file. The only
way to actually input unique data would be to create its own WBS file. I
will probably introduce input of UWP data for System Generation in a later
version.

Hope this explains everything.

I\'ve always assumed that the laser "beam" was actually a pulse only a few
nanoseconds long, fired every couple of seconds.

(You don\'t need a high ROF due to the see it, hit it principle.)

Otherwise you\'d have problems trying to keep the laser focussed on the same
point on the target.

Doesn\'t need to be that short, and probably extremely difficult to make it that sort.  I\'d guess at around a millisecond for most designs.

For the TNE 2 cents, the TL-12 Shukugan SDB (the 400-tonne one with 2 laser
turrets and 2 missile turrets) costs in at 166.59 MCr. That\'s almost exactly
six for a billion. (A spare 60,000 credits...about a tank of fuel.)

Gosh, it\'s almost as if there was a game about Billion Credit Squadrons....

True. The problem is that as you shorten the firing time you dramatically
increase the power you\'re putting out, which strains the design of certain
parts of the laser. Chemical lasers need to up the combustion rate (which is
quite tricky to do without dramatic increases in combustor/collector size).
Flashgun lasers can pull that kind of firing time off, but they\'re a lot
harder to build big. And whatever type of generation system you use, the
high power requires you to get clever with the optics, otherwise you
heat/melt/generally break stuff. MIRACL, the USA\'s satellite-whacking laser
uses ten mid-IR lasers on different bands firing out of the same hole to
help offset this, but there\'s a limit to how clever ou can get there before
the different wavelength beams start to behave differently.

This looks a lot like something I posted about 6-8 months ago,
which I adapted from a graph published in Encyclopedia Brittanica
("Biosphere" article). The Temperature/Rainfall categories with
associated biomes are as I gave them. I had simpler definitions
of the conditions, though.

Mean annual Temperature (degrees C)
 Below -15 Polar
 -15 to -5  Arctic-Alpine
  -5 to  5  Cold Temperate
   5 to 15  Warm Temperate
  15 to 25  Subtropical
  25 to 35  tropical
  35 to 45  Supertropical
  Above 45

Mean annual Precipitation (cm)
   50 or below  Arid
   50 to 100    Dry
  100 to 200    Moderate
  200 to 300    Humid
  300 to 400    Wet
  400 to 500    Very wet
  Above 500     Drenched
  Any           Wet Soil (Discontinuous or seasonal areas of 
                shallow water)

  I should note that these assume a standard atmosphere.
The maximum possible humidity of the atmosphere is determined by
the vapor pressure of water; and the vapor pressure of water
rises with temperature. In practical terms, cold air can contain
less water vapor, and cold climates are inevitably drier (above
the ground, that is) than warmer ones can get. Warmer climates
aren\'t necessarily wetter: there\'s just more room for the
humidity to vary.
  The boiling point of water is the temperature where the vapor
pressure of water equals the atmospheric pressure: Water vapor at
greater than atmospheric pressure has a temperature above the
boiling point, requires a container, and is called superheated
steam.
   Thin atmosphere worlds have a lower boiling point and a lower
range of possible humidities and thus precipitation, so they will
be limited to, perhaps, the bottom half or 2/3rds of the tables.
Dense atmosphere worlds have a higher boiling point for water,
and a wider range of possible humidities and rainfall.
  Since this behavior is typical of liquids and gases in general,
not just water and water vapor, beware of published information
on freezing and boiling points: these usually assume a certain
standard atmospheric pressure.
  The range of conditions is the approximate livable range for
humans (unaltered Solomani, anyway) without artificial assistance
such as environmental suits and heated or cooled shelters.
   The correspondence between temperature/humidity categories is
not one-to-one. One temperature/humidity category may have
several possible ecosystems associated with it, and one ecosystem
may fit several temperature/humidity categories; and neigboring
communities tend to grade into one another.  The variability is
accounted for by different soil types, distributions of
temperature and rainfall, and the biological history of the
region.

I haven\'t seen either, I have a three mile driveway and live over an hours
drive from the nearest hobby store. Despite the name, does the WBH cover
system generation too? First In seems to cover orbital dynamics, steller
types, etc., all things I would like. But maybe WBH does too?

Yes, WBH does cover that. But...there\'s a big caveat....it\'s likely that
when you make that hours journey, your nearest hobby store _will_ have
First In. World Builders Handbook is long out of print.

  Hmm. A tortuous chain of reasoning gave me an estimated average
of 1 "major" combatant (over 1000 dtons), and 3 "minor"
combatants (under 1000 dtons) per squadron. IS says a
billion credits buys a "small" squadron of 100-300 dton ships or
maybe one battle cruiser, which fits roughly with your 2-4 ships,
and with the thousands of SDB squadrons allowed for a high
population world. I haven\'t designed or even used any SDBs, so I
don\'t know. I\'m not familiar with Air force structure: How many
craft are typically in a squadron, and how many squadrons in a
wing?
   Using the conversion of 5000 MCr per RU, and 200 RU at TL-11,
1 PE point is 1 million MCr. 1/100 of this is 10 billion credits,
as you observe. 
  The last time I worked out conversions between PE and IS
military forces, I looked at starships and got the same kind of
discrepancy. If I converted directly from PE costs to MCr, I got
10 times the forces that IS gave for the planet I was working on.
My intuition screamed that IS was about right, and PE was giving
me 10 times what I wanted. I decided to assume that only 10% of
PE\'s RU costs for adding fleet capacity is the construction price
of the ship. The rest goes into parts, supplies, munitions,
salaries of crew and support personnel, recruitment and training,
support craft, base capacity, and other military overhead
required to support the new unit. IS costs include none of these.
   The grumbling and headscratching had something to do with the
breeze generated by all the handwaving I did. I\'m more
comfortable with the 1 Billion credit per SDB squadron fudge
factor, but 2 billion works just as well if not better.

I\'d go for the 2 billion. Four 400dt SDBs are almost worthless as a fighting
unit. Even with half as many squadrons, eight is a decent sized unit, able
to engage most opponents if using the right tactics. Or at least, that\'s my
view.

	True. However, I usually didn\'t assert the most severe form of any

maintenance or repair tasks. IMTU, for TL15 ships shifting fuel was

Good point, I was figuring I\'d have to find it on e-Bay or something, plus I
know of one store nearby (to my perspective ;) ) that often has out of print
stock. Is it rare though? The only concern I have with First In is how
GURPsafied it might be. I have *no* GURPs material, and don\'t like the
system much, however I really want better steller system construction
guidelines as I know squat in that area. I am competent in biology, so it is
more the orbital dynamics stuff I am looking for than the Xenobiology. And
the Xenobiology 101 thread has been wonderful. I do often twiddle with
rules, and that is what I liked about CT. So if the GURPs is not, gee, how
do I say this? Filled with proprietary jargon? Would I find obscure acronyms
that are system specific alot? Or is the book fairly stand-alone in nature?
I have currently been fiddling with Renegade Legionaire\'s orbital dynamics
rules, but the are very, um, skeletal. The wording is unclear on min/max
distances of orbital zones, motion mechanics seem a little arbitrary, etc.

Thanks!

Oh, it\'s quite stand-alone. Basically, the ship specificaions are in
GURPS terms, but quite easily converted to CT, the player chargen stuff
is, obviously, GURPS, but the rest is easily used in just about any
game. The only thing is that since GURPS uses American uniits, so does
this book, meaning a fair bit of metric conversions.

<snip reasons why my idea doesn\'t work>

Ok, so lots of very short pulses or fewer longer ones, but I still
reckon that just turning the laser on for 3 seconds won\'t work
against the sort of armour and radiator tech that Trav uses (although
even this should make the Hubble very unhappy).

Hmmm, do I detect a basis for the 50MW*TL limit for lasers handwave in T4?

I don\'t even really like all of CT/HG ship design (ducking), but I like
looking at pictures, and deckplans are somewhat universal.

Same as above, I am very free-form in chargen.

Well, I guess I can stand American units, however, do they use miles for
steller scale measurements like orbital zones, etc.?  Or do they use light
secs, mins, AUs etc.? Speaking of which, is there any unit of measurement
that is *not* Sol-centric? As I understand, even parsecs are calculated by
Terra\'s orbit, right? Just curious...

Fairly rare, but there\'s other stuff that\'s rarer still. You\'ll see it on ebay
every few weeks or so.

>The only concern I have with First In is how
>GURPsafied it might be. 
Character generation/skills stuff for Scouts is GURPS
Vehicle & starship stats is GURPS
Starport classes and tech levels are GURPS (this is the area where I really
think they ought to include CT stats as well)

One of the other downsides to the GURPS material in general is that they don\'t
follow the Miller/Fugate rules of including all the tables/formulae on a couple
of pages so that you can follow the process without the verbiage, once you\'ve
read the book.

Whatever, the world/system generation stuff compares fairly well to WBH. I
prefer WBH but there is some nice stuff in First In and I\'d definitely
recommend it. The generated system data can be used independently of GURPS -
only the starport classes and tech levels need conversion.

Some examples of stuff in First In that wasn\'t in WBH:
- - stellar age
- - settlement history (similar tables can however be found in Pocket Empires)
- - weather (some rules could however be found in Grand Survey)
Also note that the extra level of detail in WBH often has the effect of making
most of your "garden worlds" (by UPP) less attractive by introducing
temperature extremes - First In is more relaxed and in that respect at least
it\'s more true to Traveller.

Couple of things I noticed when I was going through First In in some detail
last night:
- - you can only generate class III, class V or class D primaries. Several of the
planetary systems. Admittedly a) they\'re all single planets and may
conceivably be brown dwarfs and b) if they are planets they\'re all Jovian gas
giants. Whatever I\'m no astrophysicist and I\'d like to know how class IV stars
are so easily discarded.
- - the settlement tables make it quite difficult for a planet to have been
settled in the First Imperium. Was the First Imperium so sparse?

They use AU for planetary orbits, miles for lunar orbits.  There\'s no common unit of measurement which isn\'t human-centric, though lots of measures aren\'t sol-centric per se (neither the foot nor the meter has anything to do with the sun).

Bear in mind the cylinders are usually laid up by being glass/carbon
filament wound into a resin. Almost inevitably you will get a filament
bobbin running out of thread. The only real problems occur if a fibre
projects through the resin surface and can act as a stress concentrator.

What causes failure?

1) offgassing instability - instability and out of balance forces.
2) Overspeed - material bursts due to forces.
3) material/structural defect (see above)

Also - bearing or vacuum pump failure, or miscalculation of clearances
which change due to speed increase. Resonance modes.

The key to the performance of the cylinder is in its geometry...

Now, shall I tell you the answer I was after, or do you want another go? ;-)

CSC has almost every piece of equipment ever described in Traveller (as
published by GDW). The vehicle design system is workable, but not the same
as FFS2. I use it, along with Emperor\'s Arsenal and the T4 book with Marc\'s
Playtest t4.x/T5 material as my core rules. I also use High Guard but
that\'s another story.

The Alien Archive is good, and has plenty of scope for use as background
material, but suffers from being padded by increasing the text size to fill
the book.

Of the two, both are useable for CT, but I personally would buy CSC first
as it has more utility.

Why not email Marc Miller and ask if you can get a copy of the playtest
draft? From what I\'ve seen of it provided he doesn\'t alter combat too much
a lot of the T4 stuff will be useable.

WBH, but First In is really nice too.

Note that the BBC doesn\'t seem to know the difference between
"ethane", "hydrocarbons", and "oil"; the "seas" would be liquid ethane/methane
mixture. (Liquid natural gas, I suppose), not oil.

I\'m actually fairly proud of the result. The most interesting aspect is that
on Titan
one seems to have organic molecules (methane) getting broken down by UV
light and reassembling into other molecules (ethane, acetalyne, maybe solid
tholens) - kind of like chemistry on the pre-biotic earth. One could get some
quite
exotic organic compounds occuring. In some ways, Titan is the most earthlike
place in the solar system right now...

Not vapourize - 100 MW isn\'t that much power. Badly mess up, certainly,

Well, a few seconds of MIRACL was enough to frag that USAF recon sat (that,
incidentally, the USAF wasn\'t entirely sure it was finished with). But that
was, as you say, a soft kill.

In Trav, the armour and active defences are a lot heavier, but then the
lasers themselves have been uprated from the 1-MW range to several hundred
times as large.


>Hmmm, do I detect a basis for the 50MW*TL limit for lasers handwave in T4?


I think you found the basis for the convincing handwave. I think the actual
reason is to prevent ships like the Beacon Heavy SDB (2000 Mj superheavy
lasers).....

here\'s
the quick Traveller stat:

Titan: X3A4000-0

(I can\'t quite decide between poisonous and corrosive atmosphere - it\'s mostly
nitrogen, so an oxygen mask would suffice, except that it\'s only 90 K or so,
and the hydrocarbon gunk would probably sting exposed skin.)

(Of course, with most Traveller rules it\'s impossible to actually generate
this...)

The atmosphere is 90-99% opaque to visible light; the surface will be dingy -
like moonlit earth at best. Visibility is probably less than a mile for human
eyes.
Over much of the surface, a continuous mist of liquid ethane rains down.
Speculatively, one might have "snow" of solid organic tholens, possibly
associated
with tropospheric clouds. The "seas" are black.

Heavily non-earthlike worlds like this are kind of rare in Traveller
campaigns,
which makes sense - with jump drive, you can afford to be picky - but kind
of sad, too.

Traveller: Titan is actually kind of mysterious in the real world.
Calculations
show that the methane in its atmosphere should all be converted into ethane in
10^7 years or so, A methane "ocean" might supply a reservoir to replenish it,
but the "seas" we see aren\'t big enough for this (radar results reinforce this
conclusion.) Also, Titan\'s orbit is slightly eccentric - more eccentric than
it should
be; tides from Saturn should circularize the orbit in 10^8-10^9 years.
So (in Traveller), perhaps the atmosphere is a recent artifact - possibly
Titan
was the site of a primary base for the Ancients surveillance of Earth
project...
so it attracted a massive bombardment by 0.1-c comets, sufficient to
generate the current methane atmosphere and knock it into a less eccentric
orbit. Other evidence for this includes the "death star" crater on another
Saturnian moon, and a third moon that is half-covered with black soot...
(Note to the credulous: the above paragraph is pure science fiction. Hopefully
the BBC will never get ahold of it.)

All told, though, an easily transportable petrochemical feedstock...once
a _little_ infrastructure gets built it should be cheaper to drop it in
system from Titan than boosting it up from Earth, to just about
anywhere. All you really need is a big tank and some relatively small
rockets. If they\'re unmanned, you don\'t really care if they take a long
time to get there.

Heh.  Including braking, I\'m not convinced.  Delta-V from saturn to mars (via hohmann transfer orbit) is about 11 kps total, delta-V from earth to mars is only about 6 kps.  However, this isn\'t counting in effects such as slingshot manuevers, and the cost of escaping orbit, or the fact that solar panels are more effective near earth, so I\'m not sure which would really be cheaper...

There are descriptions of Milieu 1100 IN squadrons in a couple of places. 
They tend to have about 8 or so major combatants, or a single tender and a
bunch of battleriders, all _well_ over the 1000 ton mark, plus about as
many escorts, also over 1000 tons.  This is the kind of squadron that
ballparks to around a trillion credits.  

Actual squadrons designed for play in TCS tend to be rather different, of
course, since they tend to be optimised for the sole purpose of killing
other TCS squadrons, and don\'t have to operate in the "real" world.

The kind of "battle cruiser" that can be designed for a billion credits is
something like the good old Kinunir class - not a battle cruiser in any
serious sense of the term, unless you are operating in an arbitrarily
tonnage limited environment (and such environments can be fun,
incidentally).

May I suggest you check out your ship design rules, and see what you can
churn out for various amounts of cash.  The other thing to do would be to
check out the various gearhead pages, and see what kind of ships they have
for various systems.  This would give you a feel for what is possible, and
then you can work out what you want.

Of course, the real fudge factors are the ones that give the answers _you_
want.  The squadrons I described above are just the ones from the books -
the ones in your game are the ones you want in your game.

Oh, and as for how many SDBs you can build for a billion credits:  well,
none of the figures people have posted change the basics of my original
argument - they\'re still in the same order of magnitude.

I have all three.  The shortest way to put it is...

First In = B6+WBH.

For complete system creation you need Book 6 for the system down to
the UWP level and WBH for the physical, cultural and technological
details.  First In gives you both in one book, *but* with a GURPS
spin.  

At this point, I still like B6+WBH better than First In, but that\'s
because I\'m more familar with the older books...and the spreadsheet
I use is based off them.  If you can get B6 and WBH right now, get
them! Your chance may not come again. ;->

First In is very good, it\'s more commonly available, and probably
less expensive in today\'s market.  I don\'t think you\'d be
disappointed with First In if you get it instead.

Now, about the other two books you mentioned.  

I liked CSC a lot when I got it, and although some things in it
frustrate me, I still do.  The armor system doesn\'t match any of the
other Traveller rules, neither FFS, Striker or MT, and it doesn\'t
handle layered armor, that\'s all that really breaks it.  Fusion+
seems to be T4 specific...and non-Marc approved at that.  The
computer rules included are very interesting, but aren\'t *used*
anywhere else.  However, given all that it\'s worth having and using
for small vehicles.

Alien Archives has sat on my shelf unopened since the week after I
bought it.  I read it and put it on the shelf.  I didn\'t *hate* it,
I didn\'t love it, and I haven\'t used it.  If I were you, I\'d pass it
by.

<snip reasons why my idea doesn\'t work>

Ok, so lots of very short pulses or fewer longer ones, but I still
reckon that just turning the laser on for 3 seconds won\'t work
against the sort of armour and radiator tech that Trav uses (although
even this should make the Hubble very unhappy).

Hmmm, do I detect a basis for the 50MW*TL limit for lasers handwave in T4?

This may interest people, in Perth an industrial laser used primarily for
light cutting work is computer controlled.
It had a computer glitch and was powered up to more than 10x its rating.
Somehow the laser survived this but it put a nice hole through the wall of
the room it was housed in and a wall of an adjacent building.
I don\'t know what the power rating for the laser was, perhaps someone could
enlighten us on the actual power of industrial lasers at current tech
levels.

Well, the enclosed spacedock does beg the question: "What did they build the

Probably how they are building the spacestation. A bunch of
astro-construction workers doing the assembly work with their spacecraft and
its truck driver near bye. So the answer is it would be built in space.

I\'ve been working on some Java software to automate First In (insert

non-Traveller like.

Now, several disclaimers. First, I have discussed this with John. Second, I
LOVE First In, and as an amature astronomer (minor in Astrophysics) I think
John has done the best realistic job - compared to all the other games I\'ve
seen.

The problem is, from a Traveller standpoint, there just aren\'t too many
liveable planets. The vast majority of planets generated appear to be
airless rockballs, no water - including worlds in the lifezone. While this
may be realistic, it doesn\'t _feel_ like Traveller.

So I guess I have a few questions -
    One: has anyone else noticed this? \'Cause if you haven\'t, maybe there\'s
a bug in my software.
    Two: Is this something that should be changed for a "Traveller-esqe"
campaign?
    Three: How could it be changed? What tables/rolls/DMs can be fiddled
with to get a few more planets with atmospheres and hydrospheres as
mainworlds?

Quite probably. From all information it seems that the Ziru Sirka was rather
weak on the biological sciences. Consequently alot of the more marginal
worlds would have been effectively closed to them. Thus it seems likely
that the ZS would have had to restrict it\'s settlement to worlds with
"freindly" environments.

        Hi, Nick!
        What is the output on MIRACL?  Just out of curiousity;  the scenario
is a TL~8 world where the players have a situation where a rival stellar
government has replaced a shut down weather sat with a mutli-projectile
massdriver battle-sat...  which, of course, is about to slag most of the
population centers of the planet.  Which, of course, the players have found
out and are trying to stop.  They hit the battle-sat with a ground-based
laser;  I had WAG\'d it at around 100MW, and figured that would be enough to
at least disable it if not blow it to pieces.

Yes I have noticed this.  On my first try I had to start over and

	I don\'t follow this distinction. Any organism may be large or

	This is a very good rule of thumb. I would just add that a given
	organism is not necessarily restricted to one "trophic level."
	For example, bears can be considered primary, secondary, and
	sometimes even tertiary consumers.

	Biome is usually reserved for larger-scale divisions, while

	I\'m not familiar with the Koppen system, but these divisions
	seem a little awkward. For example, B overlaps with the other
	biomes. Typically, biomes are identified on Terra without any
	attempt to generalize the system (so that it might include 
	other biospheres). The nearest biology text book here 
	identifies 12 biomes (the term is usually reserved for
	terrestrial systems): tundra, boreal forest, temperate 
	deciduous forest, grassland, cold desert, hot desert, 
	Mediterranian, thorn forest, tropical savanna, tropical
	deciduous forest, tropical evergreen forest, and montane 
	forest. These divisions are not always clear-cut (pardon the 
	pun) and each may include numerous ecosystems.

<snipped>
>A \'niche\' can be defined as \'the functional role of an organism within

	This is possibly a useful definition of a niche, but bear in
	mind that organisms do not exist to fill a role in the 
	community. My old biology text defines "ecological niche"
	thus: "The place occupied by a species in the community 
	structure of which it is a part; the way in which an organism
	utilizes the resources of its ecosystem."

	This might be seen merely as one particular tactic in 
	Competition.

>- -Parasitism :- dependence of one organism upon another (the latter

	Parasitism is usually considered to be detrimental to the
	"host." Amensalism refers to a relationship in which one
	organism is harmed while the other is unaffected.
	Commensalism refers to the case where one organism benifits 
	while the other is unaffected. Tapeworms are definitely
	parasites, as the host loses resources to the tapeworm (in
	western societies, we have so much food that the negative
	effects of the tapeworm are negligible). The remora/shark
	relationship is probably a commensalism, but true 
	amensalisms and commensalisms are probably rare.

	This brings up the notions of "homologous" and "analogous"

	Early successional plants are usually good dispersers, sun-

Maybe with Traveller technology...but not with most plausible
reaction drives. (Especially at current oil prices, but even in the moderate
term,
until we run out of oil down here completely.)

On the other hand, it\'s quite possible there are more exotic organic
molecules present - the kinds that don\'t form in the presence of oxygen but
can
occur in bizzare reactions in the nitrogen/methane atmosphere. One can
imagine those being too expensive to manufacture on Earth, and building a
device in Titan\'s seas to sift them out for shipping home.

"Tholen" is really astronomer-speak for the general class of solid organic
gunk you get when you run electricity through methane/ethane and let the
results condense. I think the term was coined by Carl Sagan (though I don\'t
have the reference handy) when he was a working scientist. It generally
signifies a mix of bizzare solid organic H/C/N combinations that are solid
at room temperature and pretty black. Much more an astronomer term than
a chemist term.

	Didn\'t you say in an earlier post that ecosystems based on

Ok, so it\'s what chemists call \'gook\'. As in "$#%@$!# it! I can\'t clean
this %%$@$!# gook out of the bottom of this $500 reaction flask!"

It was curious, since I did a search for tholen on the web, and one of
the first hits turned up one David Tholen, a planetary scientist who got
his degree here at the UA, who is working at the U Hawaii Institute of
Astronomy...

Good news for the independant filmakers of the world: in it\'s first weekend
of general release, BWP took in S28 million at the box office.  The only
film that beat it was _Runaway Bride_, which did 34 million on three times
as many screens!  (Dollars per screen is what the industry really watches,
so BWP kicked some serious butt.)

Not bad for a film with a total cost of US$ 60,000.

Uhh.....I\'d have to look it up. It\'s theoretically classified, but it\'s been
interpolated by lots of military analysts. IIRC the smart money\'s on 2.2 MW,
or thereabouts. That may be totally wrong, though (2.2 GW, 1.1MW, the
possibilities are endless) - there\'s a lot of useless crap floating around
in my head and sometimes numbers jump from one thing to another.

2.2MW will slag solar panels almost instantly, and will melt external
fittings (comms and sensor antennae) in a few seonds. The body of the sat is
probably armoured (gold foil, ablative coatings* etc) so it probably won\'t
get a hard kill. That\'s what happened to the USAF \'target\' sat. Stopped
working (or transmitting, anyway) but stayed in orbit.

100MW on the other hand, is a damned hefty weapon. That\'s 10 megajoules in a
tenth of a second (about as fast as you can flip a firing switch up and then
down again). Obviously, a stellar-tech sat could be armoured against that,
but if it was a small simple job that wasn\'t intended to get shot at it
might very easily not have been.

Your 100MW laser could have a wide range of effects, from instant boom
(rapid penetration of a propellant/coolant tank leading to explosive
decompression) to slagging (even just by overheating) vital electronics, to
melting part of the structure, to slagging vital bits on the outside. It
depends on how well armoured the sat is, how long the beam stays on target
for, and a bunch of other stuff you can make up to get the result you want.

Anything with several rows of USP-9 lasers and missiles is a big scary
opponent and you really want to be calling in a battle fleet.

Most of the published SDB designs seem to be in the 400-500 ton range (with
a few tending up towards 1000 tons), and seem to be intended to fend off
pirates, Vargr coarsairs, noncompliant freetraders and the like, plus of
course heroically throwing themselves in huge numbers at the oncoming enemy
cruiser in wartime.

Ton for ton, a hundred SDBs can probably get enough missiles off to slag a
50,000 ton heavy cruiser*, although a whole lot of them will die in the
process. I suppose the point is that by the time you\'re using SDBs you\'re
going to be desperate enough ("Hold The Line - nobody gets through, no
matter what...") that taking casualties will be accepted if that\'s what it
takes to stop that cruiser from burning the world.

*Though most of my experience is with TNE, so I don\'t know if this holds
true for HG and MT. The main penalty imposed on the cruiser is that its
spinal mount will be limited to overkilling one SDB per turn, and they\'re
all equally small pathetic targets.

    I have to agree, C.E. did not do the show justice at all.  I have run a
B5 game using MT rules.  It is looking more & more like the Traveller rules
are a rule set with a setting tacked on, not a setting with rules tacked on.
    I.e. CT/MT/TNE/T4 are rules with a setting tacked on, GURPS Traveller is
a setting with rules tacked on.  It is a question of style.  CT/MT/TNE/T4
will be classics, while GURPS Traveller will be a flash in the pan.

This suggests a really interesting idea for sabotage.  Picture having
several powerful contra grav units in various part of the cargo cycle in red
line mode when you least expect it.   Talk about your loose canons.   I bet
she would fly like one of those cat toys with an excentric weight wobbling
around inside, like a high tech Mexican jumping bean.  I can\'t see how it
would be possible to create a "false mass" and prevent a ship from going to
jump, but could such units be used to so potentially distort the jump field
that it would make going to jump either unwise or impossible until they were
shut down?

Oh no, it was much worse than that!  We didn\'t even have e-mail, never mind

The only thing that bugs me about this is that the "friendly" environments
tend to contain life, which the weak Vilani biological sciences might have
trouble dealing with.  "Unfriendly" environments have the benefit of being
sterile, and in that sense are easier to settle.

That\'s not the case for the generation tables. The settlement table tells you
when the planet was first settled (assuming no native minor race), then the long
night table allows any 1Imp/2Imp survivors to be wiped out.

Also, re: Andrew\'s previous comment ... the DMs on an initial 3D6 roll for
settlement are: 
- - how close the next nearest system is (2 parsecs +2, 3+ parsecs +6)
- - +2 if the world is not an eden world (from skim reading I\'m not entirely sure
what an eden world is - it\'s not in the index - so eden == earthlike?)
- - subtract the planetary population

a modified roll of 2 or less gets you a First Imperium world. So within a
main the primary determinant is going to be population. First In encourages you
to develop population based on the world development stat, but also bows to
tradition in allowing you to use the CT method (2d6 -2). Anybody generating
from canon data will have no choice in the matter, the 2d6-2 roll has already
been made for you, GURPS or no GURPS.

In other words, using this table, the ZS settlement pattern has very little
relationship to friendliness of the environment, since the CT population roll
has zero relationship to the UPP\'s physical data.

I\'d been looking at using the First In tables to complement a WBH-based
generation. I think the answer is going to be to use the equivalent Pocket
Empires tables (World Settlement/Settlement Date/Alien Race*/Long Night
Event/Dead World) and then to use the First In Early Imperium/Recent Events
tables.

(* = not in the book, have to get the errata, good old IG.)

Also note for the Early Imperium Events table: roll 3d twice on this table.
Result of 10="roll twice on this table". ????

    There could be other reasons to settle a world, other than climate.
Mineral wealth could be one.  Think about it.  If world A is perfect in
everyway, but does not have mineral X & you need mineral X for Jump Drive &
world B is a hellhole, but is very rich in mineral X, you will settle both.
A for food & living space, B for Mineral X.  That could be the reason for
the 2d6-2 roll for population.

You had pips and something to tie with?  You really had it made. 
We simulated random numbers by spitting on one side of a rock and
tossing it to the ground.  Wet side up was good, dry side bad.  If we 
wanted to move we had to pretend like we were carrion and hope 
that a scavenger would pick us up in its mouth and carry us somewhere!

Supplement 9 has a 200t SDB and a 50kt "armoured" cruiser.
the cost ratio is 100:1 (because the SDBs are carting around 100 model/9
computers)

The cruiser\'s spinal mount is largely irrelevant (due to the target\'s small
size and agility and it only has one) but the 40 missile bays should
damage about half a dozen SDBs per turn. A single critical won\'t kill them
though, due to the factor 13 armour.

In return the SDBs will do about 40 hits per turn (due to the cruiser\'s
large size and so-so agility vs 100 laser turrets and 100 missile
turrets). These aren\'t going to destroy the cruiser but will scrape off
all the weapons in about 3 turns (the armour factor is only 5).

=> The cruiser is trading a lot of combat capability to do Jump-4.

With TNE and T4 the armour scales better (so the SDB shouldn\'t out armour
the cruiser) and it should be more even.

No, this is a reason for a random factor in population.  The point is not that climate should _solely_ determine population -- the point is that it should _affect_ population.  Certainly, there could be high-pop hellworlds and low-pop garden worlds, but they should at least be unusual.

    There are several reasons for it.  The 1I, 2I, or 3I could have
restricted colonization on a world because of an environmental hazard, the
first people to colonize it could have been wackos.  A Nobleman could keep
that world as a private hunting ground.  It might not be on a main.
    While on the other hand a hellworld might be on a main.  It might be a
dumping ground for criminals.  It might have a rich vein of needed ores.
    The UWP gives us just the raw data, we still have to do the work.  Take
a planet with a UWP of D866971-8, or IMHO Earth\'s UWP.  This is raw data.
It could mean anything to a good GM.  He could create an earth from it, just
like the one we live on, or one where psionics have been developed ahead of
mechanical science.  Or 1,000 different reasons for it to be different from
earth.  It is up the the GM to think of a reason for something to be, not
the game.  Remember, this is only raw data.

I like the idea of the open structure, simply for the economic model (it
should be less expensive to manufacture... always a concern to official bean
counters).  They build trucks in a building, but the truck manufacturing
plant isn\'t built in another building, so that doesn\'t concern me.  However
(and I\'m not into the politics of ST, so I\'m not sure how the following
applies), what about security, as in distant spying by radio telescope or
fly-by?

An enclosed dock would cost one\'s enemy more expenses (I\'m let to believe
spying is a financial drain compared to recon) to place an agent inside to
see what is being constructed, or to find out why that starship is in dock
(Repair?  Refit?  Modification?  Taking on secret cargo/passengers) and how
it\'s situation can be used?

Just a thought...

There might be a bug in your software, but it\'s not causing this
problem.  If you follow First In rules, strictly, you don\'t get many
earthlike worlds.  That\'s realistic, but not Traveller.

The handwave in my system is the Gaia factor.  IMTU, any world that
comes close to being able to support life does, and the biosystems
themeselves moderate the environment toward an Earth-like mean.

Specifically, what I did was widened the Life Zone, allowed more
borderline worlds to support life, and gave biosystems a lot more
credit than they probably should have.  

Sol system example...if Mars and Venus switched places both would be
candidates for habitable systems.  The new, further out, Venus would
retain atmosphere and water long enough for life to develop and the
life would regulate the temperture and pressure producing a colder
and drier world than Earth, but quite possibily habitable.  The new,
further in, Mars would lose atmosphere fast enough to prevent a
run-away greenhouse from starting early in it\'s history, giving life
a chance to get a foothold and regulate temperture and pressure
producing a hotter and wetter world than Earth, but also quite
possibily habitable.

I don\'t care if it\'s bad science, it works for me.  ;->

Nick, you young Whippersnapper!  We didn\'t even *have* game shops.
We had to make do with back corners in an occasional card and toy
shop.  There we competed for space with the more popular, but
equally socially unacceptable AH, SPI and *GDW* wargames.  That was
the route that got me into RPGs, wargames.

Let\'s see what the CRC handbook says for iron and aluminum:

Hmm. I can\'t find heat of fusion or vaporization. <sigh>

I did find heat capacity, melting & boiling.

          melting  boiling  capacity
          ----  ----  ----
Aluminum  1051 C   3198 C   0.897 J/g K
Iron      1538 C   2861 C   0.449 J/g K

J/g K = Joules per gram per one degree K temp rise

So to raise one kilo of aluminum from 30 C to 1051 C takes
897*(1051-30) or 915,837 J. Pretty close to a megajoule. 

For iron 677,092 J. About 2/3rds of an MJ. 

*Ignoring* heat fusion and heat of vaporization:

Aluminum  2.84 MJ/kg
Iron      1.27 MJ/kg

I\'m sure there are references out there *somewhere* that give this sort
of thing. I just don\'t have any. I suggest a trip to your local
library. Preferably a college university that has engineering courses.

Check Heinlein\'s "Farmer in the Sky" for a simplified dissertation on
the subject of just what it takes to turn rock dust, sand and gravel
into fertile soil.

Also check Clancy\'s "Red Storm Rising" for a (all too realistic!)
discussion of the ecological effects of killing off the "unnoticed"
microfauna of a large area (it\'s the paper on what extensive use of
chemical weapons would do).

The idea is that the "point" producers produce their chemicals at a
relatively small point, and the chemicals have to diffuse outwards.
Area producers produce chemicals fairly evenly over a large area. 

This sort of thing *does* make a difference.

The radio telescope can\'t get much detail. It\'s limited by wavelength
and by size. Also, for the sort of "spying" you are talking about, it\'d
have to be operated as a giant radar unit. That\'s about as obvious as
using a searchlight at night.

Flying by too close will result in your violated restricted "air
space". 

It\'s actually easier to just rig "tarps" over and around items you want
to keep secret rather than enclosing the whole "dock"

The playtest draft of First In had an alternate system for orbit placement
that started with placing the mainworld somewhere in the habitable zone and
working in both directions from there to locate the other planets.  It went
to essentially the opposite extreme, where there\'s always a planet in the
habitable zone unless you decide you don\'t want one. This seemed like a
better solution; I\'m not sure why it got dropped.

I\'ll see if I can dig it up if people are interested (and Jon doesn\'t
object.)  IIRC, it does not use the Bode Law spacing scheme, which is also
a good thing, because Bode seems likely to be an accident rather than a
law.

Having run CE\'s Bab Project, I will give it the following kudos: CGen and
skill rules are quite well put together, work well together, and are easy
and memorable. Combat, however.... Suffice it to say the Gropo was most
unhappy having to get surgury after being hit in the gut by a Religious

One of my problems is that CT, MT, TNE, and T4 are ALL very different
rulesets in many ways. The closest two being CT & MT... The settings tacked
on to the various editions have been the the most harped on differences,
but the fundamental differences in mechanics are profound, and strongly
seem to flavor the opinions of the various ruleset adherents/proponents.
GT, having almost NO mechanical comparisons with the other rulesets, relies
on reworking, almost from scratch it would seem, the setting which was an
afterthought of the CT rules.

T4, IMHO, will be even less of a splash, unless MWM gets T5 out soon (next
2-3 years), since it shares less with CT/MT/TNE (*pick any one*) than the
others do to CT/MT/TNE (*pick any other one*) , including background and
mechanics.

I kind of view a navy construction facilities or "navy docks", rightly or
wrongly, like our-world equivilent... that is, in Sydney harbour, you can
sail right past and look over what ever is in port at the moment.  Looking
at pics of SF, I thought it was similar, but I can\'t say with veracity on
that one.

Unlike many (as it seems) that impose strict airspace restrictions,
security, whatever, in TTU\'s, I allow for such things in plot elements as
unrestricted space near certain military emplacements during peacetime...
which make it easier to play certain scenarios, not near impossible to play,
YMMV.

Again, for a sci-fi game element, I\'d prefer to have PC\'s sneak into an
enclosed dock and make their way through a complex than sneak up on a tarp
covered rig and cut a hole in it... purely for plot element and story
telling.  Again, YMMV.

However, this is my line of thinking, not something I recall having done.
For example, to make such a plot workable, I know my old TU had facilities
for sneaking a starship through blind spots in planetary defences and
sensors with the arbitrary decision that they "had" to exist.  To read the
TML, it is near impossible -- if possible at all -- to sneak a land a ship
illegally dirtside when you listen to the posts real life facts and physics
without such an arbitrary call.

ObTrav:  How do other GM\'s get around this problem?  There are military
grade turret weaponry in a warehouse that *have to be loaded from there* a
few cliks from the Starport and smuggled out.  The activity will draw
attention and by the worlds laws, gives a high chance of being caught.
Therefore the only option is to sneak past the sensors and land, load and
sneak backout...

For regular IN squadrons including battle cruisers, battleriders
and tenders and the like, I do use the Trillion credits, and I do
get the kind of numbers you are talking about.
But IS talks about giving hipop worlds, for instance, 3 starship
squadrons and 1200 SDB squadrons. This makes NO sense to me
unless the SDB version of a squadron uses fewer and smaller ships
than the regular naval type.  I got the impression from my
sources that when an IN admiral and the local SDB commander talk
about "major combatants" they are discussing entirely different
animals. The IN admiral is thinking something like 50 kT and up,
and the SDB admiral more like 1 kT. The kind of thing you can get
for a billion credits or two looks to me like about the size an
SDB squadron should be.

What is the role of SDBs, anyway? For moderate population worlds
that can only afford a squadron or two, it must be principally to
discourage piracy, chase smugglers, and rescue stranded pilots
(Rather like the US Coast Guard) but how many squadrons do you need for
that kind of work? For high pop worlds, it looks more like
keeping potential invaders from having a free hand in case the
regular navy is out chasing wild geese.

In ST, the Federation has the Argos array that can, from within its
own borders, get a clear enough picture of someone on Romulus so that
he can be identified - even though he\'s a well known personage who has
been disguised well enough that a Romulan standing next to him won\'t
recognise him.

So security looks like a real problem it that universe.

BITS will be there for four days. In a break with previous tradition we are
moving the stand from the demo hall to the trade hall, and having a
separate demo area. We will be running three tournaments -

- - SpaceDogs II - fun and games with the Vargr Underdogs
- - Delta 3 is Down - an important Zhodani Courier Mission
- - The obligatory silly Traveller adventure.

plus demos ranging from normal Traveller (CT/MT/TNE/T4/GT) to games like
ACQ and the Full Thrust Traveller version we\'ve been working up. It\'s
probable that we will have a computer demonstrating Rob Prior\'s MacOS
software.

There will be up to four new releases if all goes will. Only one of these
is a 101 book. ;-)

It\'s likely that the big box of old Traveller material will also make it to
the stand, selling at the low prices BITS members have got used to...


I will be there from Wednesday night, and the stand should be up Thursday
AM. Andy Lilly will be there for a few days, and other BITS members are
likely to be around. Come and see us at the stand! If you\'d like to a demo
or to run or play we\'ll be there. If you want to help, let me know....

No, this is a reason for a random factor in population.  The point is not
that climate should _solely_ determine population -- the point is that it
should _affect_ population.  Certainly, there could be high-pop hellworlds
and low-pop garden worlds, but they should at least be unusual.

There is a world in the Solomani Rim I cannot remeber its name, which is a
garden world in all aspects, lots of native life etc. Only problem was it
harbored an organism which removed metals, including iron from anything it
was in contact with. The colonists all died of anemia with their equipment
breaking down around them. The world was interdicted.

In the TNE era I hope it is widely known that the world is interdicted and
why, else that organism is going to spread. I would be surprised if the
interdiction squadron or satellites survived the virus era.

IMTU, at least, and based upon the few worlds shown in detail in _The
Traveller Adventure_, _Knightfall_, and the CT numbered adventures, many
worlds either don\'t have or cannot afford all-inclusive monitoring.

Why might they not have the comprehensive monitoring?
1) Lack of interest
2) Political fears of "Big Brother" on the planet.
3) Religious Prohibition
4) Lack of Technology to support and maintain (See also Psaydi, in _TTA_)
5) political &/or military corruption/inefficiency/ineptitude

Land based sensor systems also have one other drawback: many of the smaller
pop worlds will have their populations all near a single center of
population. In such cases, it would require putting monitoring stations
around the circumferance of the planet to maintain 360x180 degree
monitoring; not practical unless you have a credible threat to something
you value. So, unless something on the wrong-side IS of value to the
locals, they aren\'t going to pay too much attention. Note that value here
is not a tightly defined term, and so can include any number of rationales.

Additionally, Earth has extensive Air and surface monitoring coverage for
several reasons, including (but not limited to) balkanization, lack of
trust, and imminent threat. Most worlds in the marches don\'t have this.
They do have one thing we don\'t: interstellar and interplanettary traffic
with significant sensors on a regular basis. Most worlds need not rely on
ground based or orbital sensor platforms if they have a customs "fleet" (4
ships in a tetrahedron {d4 shape} formation can cover all the orbital and
beyond to the limits of their sensor ranges around a sphere)...

IMTU, monitoring is generally limited to approaches to the planet and (from
orbit down)  to the major urban areas... except on ExtLaw or HiPop worlds.
If there is a high port, it generally handles orbital assignments....

Blind spots exist because the "Credible threat" is not sufficient to
warrant the long term deployments of men and materiel to prevent them. Or,
rather, the threats are not sufficiently high that full-time full-up
systems are used.

And, despite the touting of some of our "Sky-watch" capabilities, we can\'t
even track how many chunks of rock atually fall into the troposphere each
year...

I live near one of the most powerful radar systems in the world (The US
DEW-line), and know for a fact that Russian aircraft frequently were
detected after crossing the DEW-line, rather than being detected by the DEW
system it self.... It\'s amazing what you learn just by hanging out on an
active interceptor base... so few GI\'s realize how much they let slip.

Speaking of slips, that\'s another way around security... just find out the
"Ignore me, I\'m nobody" codes from some drunk (or drugged) GI. The
automated systems then think you are a friend.

Oddly enough, back in the 70s, there was an article in Analog that made
a good case for a slightly modified "Bode\'s Law" working for the
satellite systems of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. 

I\'v never had it and the voyager/pioneer data on the "new" satellites
in the same place, so I can\'t say how it stacks up now.

Ok, I\'ve *had* it. I\'m going to do the unforgiveable. Tell the truth...!

Back before 1980 I did my figuring for all these grandiose schemes
on a 4 function calculator (with no memory) using a 60 row *abacus* to
store intermediate results.

Actually, you usually take aged manure, fermented urine, and a generous
amount of wood ash (*not* charcoal!) and mix in a barrel over a fire
tto extract the saltpeter. (I\'ve got more accurate directions if you
*really* want them).

You also need sulfur and charcoal for gunpowder. Or you can mix sugar
and saltpeter to make a decent solid rocket fuel.

I think you are confusing Traveller with Star Trek, I do not think that there 
is a overly large abundance of Earth-like worlds in the Traveller system 
(regardless of version). Look at the spinward marches for example. It would 
be interesting for some one with a spread sheet to show us the break down of 
various types of worlds are in the most canon of all sectors, the Spinward 
Marches. I really do not think that there are that many truly "Earth-like." 
Lots of terrestrial, but few truly standard atmosphere, standard gravity, 
etc. Of course I could be wrong, but most of the worlds I remember fell short 
of being truly "human-friendly", if memory serves most seemed to require 
special life support apparatus to move about freely in. 

Have I misunderstood your point?

I have done something similar in which the PC\'s ship misjumps and they
wind up on a primative world.
At least at first it seems primative.  It\'s fun to watch the PC\'s waste
their ammo on thugs and highwaymen and get a false sence of security.

What the PC\'s don\'t realise is the fact that "magic" exists on this world.
They soon see that when they encounter their first \'wizard\'.

The \'magic\' is of course high technology and psionics.

I have used this scenario many times at conventions, with interesting
results.  Got the idea from an old issue of Challenge.  Can\'t remeber the
issue number, but the article was called "Just Like Magic" or something
similar.

Another fun thing to do is the reverse of the Conneticut Yankee, that
being the case in "The High Crusade".
In this case the \'primative screwheads\' are about to be invaded by a high
tech society but end up taking over that high tech society!  Imagine
midaeval soldiers using catapults and trebuchet to lob tactical nukes.

Hmmm, maybe there\'s a reason why most low tech wolds are interdicted? ;-)

On page 60, the Planetoid Belt Value table - its impossible to roll 18 (and get 
Motherlode) because all dms are negative.  

Also, is there any technical reason why Planetoid Belts and Terrestrials have different 
resource tables (and possible values) - thought PBs were made up of the same material 
as Terrestrials - just broken up and strewn about. I\'m toying with the idea of giving 
Terrestrials the Planetoid Belt table and see how the numbers pan out.

	I\'m not sure what you mean by chemicals, but if we look at
	trees or creosote bushes growing in natural systems, I
	believe that we would find water use, photosynthesis, detritis
	production, O2 generation, etc. would be just as diffuse as

Look at the bright side--your odds of being burned as a witch are
considerably lower. Besides, your social-sciences degree will prepare you
better for genteel interactions with the locals, which can be as helpful
in such a situation as knowledge of how to make gunpowder. The best-suited
to such a situation would be a non-specialist, with a high
Jack-of-all-Trades skill...

more like "Indistinguishable from Magic", as in, "a sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable from magic," which is Clarke\'s Law, and
applies perfectly to this sort of scenario.

I\'m aware of the problem Igor has pointed out, although I don\'t
entirely regard it as a problem. . .I don\'t expect that people who
are trying for classical Traveller feel will use the First in rules for
fully random generation of star systems.  If you do that, Earthlike
worlds will indeed be rare.  People committed to Classic Traveller
feel may want to use First In more to fill in details for systems that
already "exist."

A few suggestions, if you want to tinker:

Page 47: There\'s an alternate method for generating primary star
spectral type if you know there\'s an Earthlike world in the system.
Use that method for almost *all* stars, and ignore the "realistic"
distribution which generates a lot of red dwarfs.  Red dwarfs are
extraordinarily unlikely to harbor Earthlike worlds.  Yes, I know
that Book 6 generated lots of red dwarfs too.  I suspect most
Traveller referees won\'t miss them.

Page 52: Ignore the age of the primary star, thus throwing out the
possibility of a star system that\'s too young to harbor advanced life.
For other steps which make use of the age, assume the system is
(say) 5 billion years old.

Page 54, sidebar: If you want, widen the life zone by tinkering with
the constant factors in the formulae for the inner and outer edge
distances. 0.7 for the inner edge distance and 1.6 for the outer edge
distance are a reasonable match for the assumptions that were made
a few decades ago (those values would place Venus and Mars inside
the solar life zone, barely).  If you do this, you may have to fudge the
given formulae for surface temperature -- the over-wide life zones in
Book 6 were why so many "habitable" worlds turned out to be iceballs
or ovens under those rules.

I\'m working on a system for placing planetary orbits that doesn\'t mimic
the Bode sequence and will allow you to start with a planet placed
where you want.  The reason a similar system was dropped from the
draft is because it didn\'t work very well for some systems -- the innermost
planets turned out to be right on top of each other.  When I\'m done with
that I\'ll put the semi-official rule on my web site and post to this list too.

Speaking of which, I am building a web site for First In as time allows.
I intend to collect all kinds of variant and additional world-building rules
there, so if you\'ve got any suggestions, let me know.  I\'ve been getting
a fair amount of material already (including from SF author Steve White,
of all people :-).  Can\'t make any promises, but I may be able to put the
site up for use by the end of this month.

I\'m going to be there from Wednesday (with a group  from  Luton).
Based on past experiences the  only  difference  between  "Basic"
accomodation and "Standard" accomodation  is  that  there  is  no
garentee of a sink in ever room with Basic.  Last year a dozen of
us went "Standard" and got run-down moldy accomodation on the far
side of the campus ... 20 min walk from  all  the  events!  There
were people in "Basic" who\'s rooms were better quality  and  much
nearer.  This year (unless the organisers screw up)  we  have  an
entire floor in one of the towers all to ourselves.

Therefore, don\'t be suckered into paying premium rate "Standard",
go "Basic".

(Oh, yes: don\'t bother with local B&Bs ...  most  don\'t  want  to
know or have a 11pm shutout.  Last year we were playing pool with
guest star Claudia Christian at 1am :-) ... she cheats!!!)



See ya there ...

Well, as fair as I can see, this thread is pretty analogous to the two
schools of character generation;
a) You generate all the stats, a la CT, and the fun part is creating a life
story about thos stats, or
b) You roleplay through the life (the fun part) and assign stats along the
way. (Often used for TNE).

Just as both of the above are equally valid, so both ways of creating worlds
are valid. I have feeling we\'re going to see the same arguments stated and
restated on both sides without reaching a conclusion. Don\'t worry about it,
there\'s really no conclusion that needs to be drawn.

Isn\'t the reason because even the minerals that would be buried four hundred

Andrew,

I love the fact that you\'ve got your app working, and the data
results look very good.  While I can follow your suggested format
with some intrepidation, I\'d like to request that if it were
possible, I\'d also like to see a subsector listing, generated under
First In rules, with data formatted in a UWP as it exists under
CT/MT/TNE/T4/EtcT.

It\'s much easier for me to follow than the new format you\'re working 
on.

Also, may I suggest the following, to make the system easier to read, 
and closer to the CT/MT/EtcT UWP set-up:

* Move 8-Starport to before 2-Mainworld Diameter.

* Move 6-Population rating to after 7-Population value, so that it 
reads more easily: 2 4 becomes 2 X 10^4 rather than 4 X 10^2, which 
is opposite of the direction we read them in the current format.

_OR_

Move 6-Population rating to just before H-Planetoid Belts, and move
G-Gas Giants to just after H-Planetoid Belts, to match the MT UWP
code: PBG (Population rating, Number of Belts, Number of Gas
Giants.)

* Move C-Allegiance to after the PBG codes (MT), or to after D-Bases 
(CT.)

* Move E-World Trade Number to after F-Trade Codes.

These changes will make it easier for me, and possibly others, to 
follow, since it will bring the format closer to the classic UWP 
format.  Thanks for all your hard work.

In Service,
Jason

I accept that for the 3I stats (it is after all part of Traveller), but:
- - these tables don\'t determine 1I/2I population spread, but whether worlds were
settled at all
- - if the settlement is far sparser than the 3I it should be more defensible -
under the 3I almost every system is settled
- - First In actually assumes that environmental suitability would determine 1I
settlement, because its default mechanism for generating population (unlike CT)
also takes this into account. Unfortunately a) canon data already exists for
all mainworlds in the Imperium and b) even if you use the First In method it
generates so few earthlike worlds that 1I settlement is even more rare.

The problem with this is that it makes the trade information more 
annoying to actually *use*.  You need the WTN more often and earlier
than the trade codes so it makes sense to place them first. Besides,
Andrew\'s current lay-out is based on that used in GT.  

Rather than having a "hybrid" lay-out that crosses the UWP with 
GT conventions, perhaps Andrew would be kind enough to allow people
to choose from GT and genuine UWP options?

(My mailer sent this before I was finished, darn it)

I accept that for the 3I stats (it is after all part of Traveller), but:
- - these tables don\'t determine 1I/2I population spread, but whether worlds were
settled at all
- - if the settlement is far sparser than the 3I it should be more defensible -

also takes this into account. Unfortunately a) canon data already exists for
all mainworlds in the Imperium and b) even if you use the First In method it
generates so few earthlike worlds* that 1I settlement is even more rare.

Using a fairly broad definition of "eden" world = world with standard
atmosphere and >4 hydrosphere, with canon data, I get about 2-4 worlds per
subsector settled in the First Imperium. Not only is this way out against the 
similar tables in Pocket Empires, but it ignores the fact that a civilisation
initially capable of only Jump-1 would have to provide facilities at far closer
intervals to create a sustainable empire.

Plus the tables provide no way of working out the prevalent tech level during
the Rule of Man. :-)

* to be fair to First In, there are 2 basic system generation methods in
Traveller, post scouts.
The classic method which generates the mainworld first, and which was used to
generate the canon data, is the default.  Alternatively you can generate the
extended system data first, and then use the world with the largest population
as the mainworld.
First In has the default/alternative the other way round, but you could still
use the classic way - though unfortunately the GURPS Space/Behind the Claw world
descriptions are less efficient for this method than was the CT UPP.

Um, well only if you\'re using GT:FT will you use WTN more than the trade codes. Remember, there are still a lot of, maybe more, CT/MT/TNE travellers than GT travellers out here.

There was a very short thread about this in digests 748 to 752. Hopefully more
people have First In now.

>One: has anyone else noticed this? \'Cause if you haven\'t, maybe there\'s
>  a bug in my software.

I posted in the previous thread that, using First In, I tried to generate an
earth like planet in the hab zone of a star completely at random and it took me
46 attempts to do so. Then getting an earth like temperature was even more
difficult. Rob Prior also posted that Scouts was similar in this respect.

>Two: Is this something that should be changed for a "Traveller-esqe"
>  campaign?

I like it generating "realistic" systems. I also feel that there should be sets
of refinements to allow it to meet each persons TU requirements. 

>Three: How could it be changed? What tables/rolls/DMs can be fiddled
>  with to get a few more planets with atmospheres and hydrospheres as
>  mainworlds?

The Base Orbital Radius & Bode constants could be made more continuous. The
discrete numbers First In generates using D6s give a smaller probability that a
world will fall into the hab zone, than a continuous sequence would. This should
increase the overall probability that a world falls in the hab zone by about 10%
(every little helps). So indirectly it helps by giving you more planets in the
hab zone to work with.

You could use a linear probability method for planet size (e.g. size 1-10 [or
0.5-10.5]), rather than a bell curve using 2D6-2 (or 1-8 for 2D6-4). This gives
you more variation in size, increases the average planet size by 0.5, and ups
the odds of an ocean planet by about 10%.

You could use a different planet size distribution that favored bigger planets. 
e.g. 3D6-3, rerolling any result over 10.

You could also roll planet size twice and keep the biggest.

You could stick with younger stars, say Disk population and younger (which seems
reasonable anyway). Thereby increasing average planet density (step 9) and hence
its size class (step 12).

I think you are still going to get a lot of small Desert worlds and very small
rockballs. To be earthlike and uninhabited they must have been terraformed
sometime in the last million years or so. So handwaves involving ancients and
TL9+ technologies may still be required. 

Perhaps just say that all Desert and Hostile worlds in the Life-zone have been
terraformed. This doesn\'t seem unreasonable in the OTU. Then use reduced
penalties on the hydrosphere table (halved? minimum of one?). 

The rules allow you to vary all hydrosphere results by up to 5% so you could
have up to 5% hyrographics, quite legally, regardless of a roll of zero :)

I don\'t know what you can do with the very small and tiny category worlds (size
3 or less). I personally would be tempted to drop them as habitable planets and
ignore canon (gasp).

wanna see worse? Try getting accrete (I think Doug Berry has a link to
it via his web site), which is a system generation model built on
real-world constants and assumptions.  I think I ran it about 120 times
before I got a habitable planet. 

All this aside, what do people count as \'habitable\'? I have the Spinward
marches data in a database, and I can generate some numbers based on it.
(I also have all of the rest of the second survey, as well as the first
survey data, so I can look at statistics for the entire 3I)

at a first guess are we only talking standard atmosphere, with 30-80%
hydrophere? What about tainted atmosphere? Thin? Should I look at
10-100% HYD, only excluding pure dry worlds?

   I take it that SDBs typically aren\'t _meant_ to stand up to
ships of the line. Most of them most of the time are sitting
around waiting for something to happen, which is usually ethics
adjustment (mostly smugglers & speeders) and flaming idiot
cleanup (S&R). Quite a few them are patrolling class B ports and
medium population worlds that might be able to afford a single
destroyer if they saved for a century or two.
   If your hipop worlds want something that can survive long
enough to keep the marines from landing anywhere valuable until
the Navy gets its pants pulled back up and comes to the rescue, I
don\'t see any compelling reason they can\'t turn in ten squadrons
of "ordinary" SDBS for one with ships ten times bigger.

I have never been a fan of codified data and the UWP/UPP. I would prefer a more
descriptive output, column headings, and a key (e.g. what the letter codes mean
- - Co, Bur, Im, NiVa). Perhaps you could use icons for each section of the code
(e.g. wingdings characters - water droplet for hydrographics, etc.). I have
always hated having two codes for the population, why not just give the
population total. Also combining BG as one number makes me cringe. Sorry to be
so negative but I like things easy to understand. I have always thought that
codified data is a sure way of turning off a large proportion of your potential
target auience.

The bases column seems to be missing.

I assumed planets were more stratified, so that stuff that was in PBs may be
deeply buried in planets. I would expect mineral wealth of planets to rise with
density. There again I would expect dense planets to exist in the same system
where PBs had higher resource values. Perhaps this table should correlate with
age of the star. Younger stars have better resources?

OK, Aliens and alien life forms have been discussed any number of
times, but we all know that Travellers are in it for the money as
much as anything else, and money often means metal and minerals.
So exactly what ARE Sternmetal Horizons and Ling Standard
Products fighting over, and where, and why?

 In my Planetology 101 posts a while ago, I discussed the "big
four" elements (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen) and their
relationship to life. In this series, I look at the principal
rock-formers and their relationship to planets.

In one of his Xenobiology 101 posts about a month ago, Robert O\'
Connor gave a list of cosmic abundances of elements. His appeared
to be based on mass with hydrogen as a standard. This list is
based on numbers of atoms (more useful, to me) with silicon as a
standard. These solar system abundances are thought to be fairly
close to cosmic proportions, but, as I will show at the end,
minor differences on a cosmic scale may be very important on a
planetary scale. 

Solar system abundances (per 10^6 Si atoms)
H    27.9e9    Cr   14e3      Ga   38

1. The Noble gases.
     Helium and Neon are important industrial gases. They are
comparatively rare and expensive at lower TLs, since they are
light and easily lost from terrestrial planetary atmospheres, but
they are make up some 25% (by weight) of a gas giant\'s
atmosphere. The same noble gases that are contaminants in the
jump fuel are essential in the superconducting magnets in the
fusion reactor and weapons systems. Skimming and separation
facilities located in orbit or on a convenient moon of gas giant
at TL 9+ worlds are major suppliers of these gases.

2. Oxides
     There is more than enough oxygen in the cosmos to combine
with all elements less abundant than carbon, with plenty left
over. Oxygen in some form is hard to escape. Most elements have
one or more compounds with oxygen, and all but a few are solids
at temperatures comfortable to humans.
     The number one oxide and compound in the cosmos is water,
but at pressures below about 1/20 earth atmosphere, it does not
exist as a liquid and behaves like dry ice. Carbon dioxide can be
liquefied at high pressure and low temperature, but, as discussed
in Planetology 101, most planets with such conditions keep their
carbon as methane.

Next up: Silicates.

	Hi, Thad!
	Well, any doctrine discussion I have ever read indicates they are
supposed to be ambushing the Big Boys in places like the Gas Giant during
fueling ops.  No number of 400dton SDB\'s are going to worry a Tigress, or
even an Atlantic;  even encumbered by a gravity well.  So the design seems
contradictory to the mission doctrines I have read.  Really, the SDB ought
to have at least a bay weapon to worry a cruiser.

	Yeah, I suppose this is a good job for small ones...  treat them
as non-jump Patrol Cruisers.

	Hmmm...  I dunno if I can accept that...  even with TCS rules, any
world big enough for a class B port ought to be able to build a DesRon per
decade, even if they are frugal about defense spending.

	Which is most likely the case, now that you say it.  Light patrol
SDB\'s that you don\'t mind being out in the open, and the bigger attack
ships that you keep hidden.  Yeah, that would make some sense.

A friend of mine brought the (7-CD I think) set of Hitchhiker\'s several
years ago down here in Australia... I copied it to cassette, so I can\'t tell
you who put it out... but it is available, that being the point.  Any record
store in Australia (well, SE Queensland anyway) can get it in by the name
alone, perhaps your local can to.

You had hills!  Why when I was young hills had not

You had _stores_ ? (much less phones).  Why when I was young games
were not available in stores.  Stores had not been invented yet.
I had to carve early character sheets into the sides of

You had paint ?!  Why when I was young paint had not yet

our own circulatory fluids.  When we were done we had to

You had dreams ?!?  Why when I was young dreams had 
not yet been invented.

You had coal! Why when I was young the organic matter that
would later become coal had not even formed for
the first time.

Not under High Guard - factor 13+ armour, agility 6 and a model/9
computer mean that the 200t design in Sup 9 can win against the
cruiser designs in that book - but they need odds in their favour
of about 30:1. The cost odds are 100:1 but since it is cheaper to
attack one planet than defend everywhere you aren\'t likely to get them.
However it is certainly possible for a pack of SDBs to hide in a
system and then mission kill individual ships.

The Sup 9 cruisers are all let down by their low armour factors and the
lack of agility 6 which seems to be the compromise required to get
jump-4.

Under High Guard, this means that a pack of the 200t SDBs from that book
can mission kill the cruiser with Weapon-1 hits.

Using a 1kt design with a bay weapon won\'t help against the bigger
targets, since bay mounted nuclear missiles and mesons won\'t get
through decent screens and even a factor 9 PA still gets the +6
on the damage roll, which puts it off the table.

Something nearer 10kt with a spinal mount is going to be needed against
proper battleships.

This is for High Guard.

Later systems tend to penalise small ships more for carrying armour,
and have a more progressive effect for bigger weapons (instead of the
factor 9-A divide) so the results are likely to be very different.
