That would be fine, but may I suggest that you *not* use the systems given as
examples of pocket empires in Pocket Empires?

You realize that now every other phrase put out the translator will be "I

Oh yes, you will.  But only after watching the "Hungarian phrasebook"
sketch by MPFC about thirty times.

My nipples tingle with excitment!

I think you are thinking of mass drivers.  Different concept.  A PAW fires
a stream of energetic particles (as in atomic patrticles) towards the
target.  A MD accelerates a chunk of ferrous metal using a magnetic field.

One thing that you\'re missing is that thruster plates have a minimum
size - about 10m3 - so you can\'t fit them in a small missile.

14m3 missiles, on the other hand, can have T-plates in them and will
indeed have infinite endurance (though they\'ll be damned expensive.)
I argued to make thruster plates bigger at one point but was
overrulled...

I think J-man\'s got a point here that leads to an explanation of why many think
that Aslan might act like earth cats.  I think its undeniably that much behavior
is biologically determined.  Each part of one\'s physiology is due insignificant
part to their biological evolution.  If a cat has claws, theirs a reason, and
that reason will affect behavior.  That reason is to snare and hold prey so the
killing bite can be applied.  Play behavior is usually training in some part for
adult behavior.  Cats are hunters, not always lone hunters (e.g., groups of
lionesses who hunt cooperatively).  They are to use their claws against each
other in play.  They are also trained to track movement more and strike.  So a
ball of yarn isn\'t exactly ridiculous for an infant Aslan.  Bladed jacks might
be especially useful to prepare an Aslan for the realities of combat, especially
pain tolerance or agility in avoiding damage).  I could go on about how humans
and how their behavior relates to biological factors, but we all know enough
about that I think.

What I\'m basically saying, that we need to know the reason for the Aslan\'s
biological adaptation to even begin to figure out their culture.  (I\'d speculate
but I don\'t have anything about the Aslan except for whats in T4).

To name them after a famous Literary Lion only begs for the connection to be
made in the readers mind.  If its artificial to attribute Terran Feline behavior
to Aslan, is it any less artificial to compare them to Terran Cultures?  I
suggest not.  (and even though its works, I\'ve grown tired of the Samurai Cat in
a plethora of sci-fi over the years from Larry Niven to Wing Commander.)

Dear God!!!!!!!  I bet this ENTIRE LIST IS CHOCK-FULL OF PERVERTED

If this is true, it make sense.  I think cats evolved smaller, but I\'d have to
research to be sure.  I was surprised to learn a while back that most
researchers beleive that domesticated cats could never have survived without
human intervention due to a variety of reasons.  I know that a lot of
evolutionary scientists believe that early humans were driven to the forests and
water-rich areas of Africa (and thus losing the need for massive amounts of body
hair and adapting to swimming and operating underwater) to escape the big cats
which would have dominated the plains and savannahs and been undefeatable by
early homonids until weapons were developed.  Those big cats could easily have
appeared to be the dominant predators on the planet then.

Also interesting is that most breeds of dog existing today were consciously
created by humans.

Geez, Kenji, when I said remind me, I kind of meant privately.... <G>

This week\'s topic will be Robots. We will meet on Undernet 
#traveller. Springfield is becoming the server of choice, with 
StLouis and Phoenix as good backups in that order (addresses to 
follow). We\'ll begin at 8:00pm Central, but there will most likely be 
early arrivals (like me <G>).

springfield.mo.us.undernet.org
stlouis.mo.us.undernet.org
phoenix.az.us.undernet.org

See you there!

In *that* case, may I suggest Hobbes\' _Leviathan_. The problem with MOST =
government (with the possible=20
exception of dog-eat-dog capitalism) is that it is against human nature. =
The whole point of government (according to Hobbes) is to coerce =

There is one historical example of true communism.  It worked because all
the participants were voluntary and free to leave at any time.  This is also
why some of the communes formed in the US during the 60\'s and 70\'s were as
successful as they were (and some still are).

That historical example is the first century Christians.  They held
everything in common and if any of them needed they got.

There are about 35 BBS\'s still active in this area.  No, we aren\'t as busy
as we used to be, but we\'re still out there.  

I\'ll bet there\'s a BBS near you that would welcome you dropping by to say,

Me too!  Did you know there are connections between the Foundations series

Carlos Alos-Ferrer\'s Geonee information is available on Scott Galliand\'s
excellent web site... which seems to have moved.  Hm.  Either that or AOL
is doing horrid things again.

Some information on the Suerrat appeared in JTAS 1, as written by another

designing the seventh-grade curriculum I\'m teaching....)  Let me know if

Perhaps we should use  a more scientific designation such as species.  Then
the alien species would  more clearly delineate the differences.

I am unaware of any GDW source that says this (if so, I declare it invalid,
and I\'m sure Marc and Frank will agree with me). This is pretty much how the
Vargr developed, however. Perhaps you are confusing the two?

This sounds like a wonderful idea.  As a matter of fact, it\'s a good enough
idea that organizations like Tukera should be doing it as a matter of course
in the height of the Third Imperium.

We can make one of two assumptions about this, then.  The first is hat Tukera 
(and most other "large" lines) were indeed operating like this all along.
The second is that there is something about the nature of interstellar travel
that prevents such a scheme from working.

The first assumption doesn\'t seem to be confirmed or conclusively denied by
the Canon, and little material is available on the second.  However, what
material is available tends to support the conclusion that a starship needs
a significant amount of time for drive recalibration and routine maintenance
between jumps.  

While the engineers would probably _like_ an entire week, in practice they
could probably do the absolute minimum required work in a few hours.
Given 24-48 hours, could probably have the drives in good enough shape that
the crew would feel safe jumping again in a non-emergency situation.

We do have particle accelerators.  They are not weapons.  They are tools for
scientific investigation.  The difference is only one of application.  If
you were to point one of these tools were pointing at an enemy, it would be

Actually, they want ISP\'s declared common carriers so they can kill them
off and take their business.   They are acting like any Mega-corp with
their fingers, toes and other appendeges stuck deeply into various

Golly Gee, Kenji!  If what Bruce wrote qualifies him as a "pinko socialist
ideologue", then I must be a fellow traveller, at least, ;-> because I
pretty much agreed with him.

Deregulation is a good thing. Competition is a good thing.  But
deregulation without competition is NOT a good thing. I\'d prefer to take
the government out of communications completely, but as long as we have
effective monopolies in local service we won\'t really have competition, and
we need government regulation to protect the public.

    libertarian, really!

Actually, we\'ve always viewed Traveller, in all its incarnations, as the

Just how effective could they be with current technology?  They require
long acceleration tunnels and are extremely energy inefficient.  I think
trying to fire them though the atmosphere would severely limit their range.
And finally, just what sort of energy density can we get?  

Sure we\'ve got \'em, but I think we\'re a ways from PA\'s being effective
weapons.

 In the traveler game that I\'ve been playing in for years we\'ve had agents
on planets along our route. All the time that we are jumping around they
stay on planet and look for good deals. When one comes along that can\'t be
passed up they buy for us and warehouse it til we come round. They know our
approximate schedules so can plan to meet our ships. 

Sometimes we lose our shirts but most of the time we turn a lot better
profit than A ship can showing up and seeing what\'s for sale this week.

But if you accelerate them to near C velocity, doesn\'t the matter break

My take was that Traveller was largely based on a combination of
Foundation, Dumarest, and Flandry, with a few bits of Dune, Skylark,
and Asimov\'s Robot series thrown in for good measure.

Thank you for the examples. My main point was what we consider to be
communism today and what we try to rid ourselves of does not hold to the
principal of equality for all. The two are not synonomous. nuff said.

Traveller is LARGELY based on the Dumarest saga, everything in it you
can also find in Traveller, including SPECIFIC things like Low passage,
high Passage, Medical drugs like Slow and Fast, the thoroughly
SNAPSHOTish hand-to-hand combat, etc.

Ok.  I\'ve never heard of Dumarest, which surprises me given the years of
book retail experience I have.  Oh well.  Amazon shows the following
titles, which may or may not all be Dumarest related.  Virtually all of
them are "Hard to Find."  Any hints on which one is best?  Or should I
start with #1, "Winds of Gath."  I\'m always game for at least one novel of
a sci-fi series.

Although you can bet that somewhere, sometime, someone is getting ripped
off by the on-planet parts of their orginisation, I dont think it\'s that
common becasue (a) factors are more disposable than starship crew, (b)
factors earn damn good money, and want to keep the captains they rely on in
business and (c) if the factor vapes, then there is always the fallback of
wasting a week orginising your own cargo.

Routine Maintainence :

This makes more sense (you need the week of ship downtime to keep the jump
drive ticking over), however ...

Engineer characters get really bored, unless you just set it up and the
computer burbles away to itself for a couple of days running diagnostics.

The same would presumably apply to simultaneous jumps in other
circumstances eg you always need to spend a day/3 days/whatever between
jumps doing routine maintainence to be safe.

Adventuring Implications :

If the players are doing it, it sets up a different kind of game ... the
Lando Calrissian/Han Solo comparison is a good one. There are still lots of
adventuring possibilities, especially for shipless parties (eg the boss got
a really good price on four tons of ivory, but you need to go pick it up
from the middle of a brushfire war).

If it part of the "background" then it makes scrabbling a credit as a
short-haul free trader even harder. As I said before, I think the key is
going into the long-haul lunury goods buisiness, as then the week or more
at each end sorting out a cargo is less important.

Costs :

I actually think costs would go down at low TLs, becasue you are presumably
paying in Imperial credits, and warehouse space, local labour etc are
priced in cheaper local credits.

Well provided you can look up tables (I don\'t have my MT books handy to
check) it seems correct to me - you forgot the range DM to hit though
(which might be zero).  Whether it is \'right\' is a matter of taste.  If you
think it is too easy you could always rule no gunnery skill is being used
so all tasks are one level higher for being unskilled - the to hit task
then moves to rolling 12+ (making it nigh impossible) and penetration 10+
(not much better).

It could be argued that a far trader is not a combat machine and is thus a
sitting target to the missiles, hence the reasonable chance to hit and the
puny sandcaster (even at UCP 4) dosen\'t do anything (sand not being so
great vs missiles anyway).

On the other hand:
I\'ve never really liked the MT to hit task because the computer has such a
big weighting (it is also included in the defensive DM as well) - hence why
the fighter in the IE has a model 6.  The far trader in the above example
couldn\'t hit a barn if said barn contained had a model 6 computer
(defensive DM +8).  A better task to hit IMO is

Difficult, Off: Weapon UCP, Gunnery. Def: Agility, Pilot or Ship Tactics

which gives the same result in the example above but moves the barn with
big computer to an 8+ to hit rather than 13+.  The computer model number I
use as part of the tactics pool with ship tactics and fleet tactics.

To penetrate try something like:

Difficult, Off: Weapon UCP, Gunnery. Def: Screen UCP, Gunnery

Which makes it 12+ in the far trader example above.  Perhaps a routine task
would be better (8+)?  You might have to add in special modifiers for
missiles against sand to make them penetrate better than lasers.  To
replicate the tables you need something like:

Missiles versus Sand: Off DM +1;
Nuclear Missiles versus Dampers: Def DM +4;
Meson vs Meson Screen: Def DM +8;
Meson vs Configuration is a mess.... :)

Another advantage of the two tasks above is you remove having to look up
lots of tables for each shot.

You sort of need some critical hit system in MT because the way the damage
table is written, surface damage CANNOT destroy a ship - only sand blast
all the weapons, fuel and maneuver drives off (leaving a nice hulk to
board!). A critical hit allows you the chance to destroy the ship.  Plus
missiles are big - far traders small hence combat is dangerous for them
(fitting with the rest of the MT combat system - dangerous for unarmoured
combatants - which a far trader definitely is).

MT combat as written between two far traders is analogous to Dulinor and
Lucan standing at 5 paces with loaded magnum revolvers.  Whoever hits first
wins.

Wouldn\'t know - I only play MT.  You might want to check out RPSCS or James
Garris\' SSCS (both for T4) for ideas if you want to tweak the MT space
combat system - both fulfill the \'Role-playing\' aspect of space combat
between small ships admirably - neither works for larger actions.

I\'m working on a new (small spacecraft) space combat system for MT
currently.  It\'s a synthesis of the best bits of RPSCS and SSCS with MT
tasks, written for MT ships.  I\'ll post a precis when I finish if anyone is
interested.

I bit the bullet and read the rest...

The cursed ship (second adventure) involves a subsidized liner (The
Annililik), a mad scientist and psycho robots. It could be rescued and
turned into a Trav scenario, but the basis of the plot (almost AI
computers) would be better at TL14/TL15.

The Cursed Cargo (part 3) is possibly rescueable, but again involves loads
of robots, mutant killer fungi (Gamma World? - really irritated me after
the work we put in on 101 Lifeforms), and encouragement to play liberally
with the canon background of the Alien Archive...

All three adventures show no understanding of what a jump drive is and how
jumps behave, and have no real link except they are somewhere along a trade
route from Core to Vland.

Dom\'s Top Tip - spend your money on Starships or First Survey instead if
you want a turkey. They bear more resemblance to Traveller and make a
useful substitute for a mousemat.

Forgot about barren worlds... Anyone got the Tab delimited First Survey

???

They already do.







Oh - sorry I\'m being Eurocentric here - for your information we get charged
per minute here in the UK and across the rest of Europe. (And we get silly
amounts of tax on fuel too but that\'s another story...)

Not everyone in the Internet gets it so cheaply - similarly computer hard
(and soft) ware translates directly at pound for dollars (so we get to pay
50% more). Why? Because that\'s what the market will bear.

On the discussion about TSP charges - we used to get a magazine called
\'Telephony\' from the US in work. I do recall several pieces on such a
proposal - the logic behind the argument was that the levels  of
infrastructure installed by the RBOCs were based on around calculations
that assumed an average call length of around 5 min, so even a few users on
for 20+ minutes can start to skew the calculations.  As security of supply
is a big issue, the RBOCs are looking for a way to pay for necessary switch
upgrades. Or at least, that\'s how they view the point. I suggest that you
try looking out some backcopies of the magazine.

Erm... you could set them to flicker..... handwave ....handwave.

It was *so* much easier when we didn\'t have all the pseudo-scientific
techno-babble. (Not that I\'m knocking FFS2 - it\'s nice to have a solid

Those interested can find files updated to Hipparcos distances at:
http://members.nova.org/~sol/chview/chvc.htm
        or
http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~jaymin/chview/chvc.htm

The files are in *.chv binary format which is described in ".../chvb.htm".
However, *.chv files can be exported to ascii format, which is described in
".../chva.htm".  (If I didn\'t get that right, check under "CONTENTS" in the
link areas at top or bottom.)

The file, "10ly-ht.chv", contains stars within 10.9 light-years (ly), which
includes Tycho Catalogue objects (Tyc #) with parallaxes (Plx) equal or
greater than 300 milli-arcseconds (mas).  While the original goal of the
Hipparcos team was to obtain Plx with (standard?) errors +/- 20-30 mas, all
but 2 of the 792 objects included have a standard error ("e") greater than
30 mas.  I excluded almost an equal number that have negative Plx (-300 and
smaller mas).  Johnson Vmag ("Mag") and converted absolute mag (Mv) are
included.  BTW, PPM # are from the enormous Position and Proper Motion
catalogue(s).

Francois Ochsenbein of VIZIER says that the nearby Tycho objects are too
bright and not red enough to be brown dwarfs.  I believe that even if they
are mostly dim M dwarfs, however, there may be too many of them.  If my
memory is correct, increasing the distance to 15 ly of Sol also increase the
number of Tycho objects to over 9-10,000.  Oddly enough, there seems to be a
"hole" (lack of objects) within 5 ly of Sol.  Hence, I wonder about an
error(s) in the algorithms used to calculate the Plx and e of the dimmer
objects observed, since dim objects require much more observation time for
accurate measurements.

The largest file, "100ly-h.zip", contains over 5,100 stars and objects
within 100 ly with updated Hipparcos distances.  Updated stars have a Hip #
in the "Notes" section and two decimal places in their distance from
Sol/Earth (e.g., 99.99) for convenience, unless rounded.  While most numbers
should be rounded up one digit, the additional digit is provided for reference.

I\'ve queried VIZIER (which, in turn, queries SIMBAD) to identify Hipparcos
stars (Hip #) for all dwarf GABO and subgiant-supergiant/etc. stars from
previous catalogues (1991 Yale Bright Star, 1984 Ochsenbein BS, 1991 Gliese,
and earlier Woolley) that did not have a HD (Henry Draper) or DM
(Bonner/BD/B, Cordova/CoD/CD/C, or Cape/CPD/CP/P Durchmusterung) number.
Querying the others (dwarf K and M, and white dwarfs) will take another 1-3
months for apparently very little gain (some stars are much further away).
While it\'s possible to avoid querying star by star through the internet to
VIZIER by using the Hipparcos Input Catalogue to get HIC numbers that link
to the Hipparcos and Tycho catalogues, that would also take a lot of time
and cross-tabs with a file of trully enormous size and you may still need to
use SIMBAD.  Querying SIMBAD/VIZIER through available HR/BS (Harvard
Record/Bright Star), G(iclas), Gl(iese), GJ (Gliese and Jahreiss),
LHS/L/LFT/LTT, Ross, Wolf, and others (such as Bayer/Flamsteed and proper
name) seems easier for small files.  In addition, I heard that Hipparcos Plx
is too imprecise for virtually all stars greater 500 ly away, many much closer.

All stars in the "50ly-h.zip" file have been queried for Hipparcos matches.
In addition, all available angular separations in arcseconds (simple "sep"
and semi-axis "a") between stars in multiple star systems have been
converted to astronomical units (AU).  Orbital periods ("P") are presumably
from long-term observation.  (P and a can be used to calculate total system
mass).

Stars in the "25ly-h.zip" have also been queried for Tycho matches.
However, few matches were found, and those had large errors.
In general, I also tried to match all non-Hipparcos G and brighter stars
with 100 ly with Tycho, but the few matches had bad Plx (noted in "Notes").
I think that I wasn\'t able to match Alula Australis(?), Xi Ursae Majoris# (a
multiple star) with Hip or Tyc -- too bad, because one of these G-F stars
has a brown dwarf/planetary companion.

Anyway, I hope these results provokes some discussion.
Cheers,
Ben

Be concerned.

Actually my ISP, Internet Alaska, did send me email telling me the

has spent most of the past week on this subject.  I encourage U.S.

I wonder which role the AAB repositories could play in this scenario. They

Ships need Age/10 days of routine maintainence between jumps.

This way, the brand new megacorp freighters can do their fast turnarounds,
aided by trade stations, while the creaky old freighters have to sit on the
tarmac for 5 days or so anyway, so the captain and/or purser might as well
avoid the costs of paying for on-planet infrastructure and go looking for
cargoes personally.

The engineer just needs to oversight the process, needing age of ship in
hours per day divided by engineering skill.

Of course, this will also increases the rate of depreciation on starships
by reduing their rate of earnings ... between being slower and more
expensive to maintain I believe you could buy a 50 year old freighter for
as little as 35% of sticker cost. Add obsolete (eg a TL11 freighter in the
early 3I) and I think you could get the total price down to the cost of a
deposit on a brand spanking new ship.

The large European collider at CERN (French/Swiss border) also has the
disadvantage
of being a ring several km in diameter and many metres underground.

If your enemy did stand in one of the detection chambers (ie in the path of
the beam)
it would be a lot simpler to drop one of the 100ton detectors on him.

You\'d actually have to accelerate them to C or beyond, but you can\'t do that
with current technology.  Unless, you have a copy of Dr. Beer\'s work which
was classified and buried.

Why do I see a human walking into a Sayat-Spofulam weapons shop, reading   
from the book and sounding a bit like the Monty Python Sketch:

"I will not buy this Pelvicly Mounted Plasma Gun, it is scratched"
"My Air-Raft is full of eels"
"My (insert favorite body part here) explode with delight!"

Mind you, this could be common conversational speech to the Sayat :)

More insanity from the Commander
Cheers.

 Well, I don\'t agree with this viewpoint. Real world (say, TL 8-9), high-
energy particle accelerators are enormous, delicate and energetically 
unefficient machines (just consider the power needs,dimensions and cost for
the LEP ring at the CERN or the failed SSC project, for example). In 
other words, I don\'t think they satisfy any of the physical requirements 
for a device which has to be used at war.
 
 PA\'s have another drawback: they are only suitable for use in vacuum. If 
used within an atmosphere, the particle beam would be quickly absorbed 
and dispersed by the air molecules along its path (and air would also 
enter into the vacuum chamber of the weapon itself, rendering it 
inoperative). This last drawback could be maybe solved if a laser beam 
was used to make an "tunnel" of hot, ionized air before shooting the PA 
itself (something like 2300 AD plasma weapons, at a MUCH larger scale). I don\'t 
have the figures but I remember, from what I readed, that the energy cost
would make it prohibitive (if this discussion continues, I will give some 
bibliography about the topic; it was a paper at "Scientific American", 
but I don\'t remember the date now. Sorry).

 A PA could use either charged (protons, electrons, alphas... or neutral 
particles (neutrons). Charged particle beams are more difficult to 
control, since they are affected by electrical and magnetic fields. This 
would be a great source of nice special effects: near a planetary 
magnetic field, we could have a curved beam! This leads to 
fascinating tactical possibilities (knowing the exact configuration of 
the planetary field at a given moment, you could "skip" planetary 
curvature to strike an enemy who is out of your line-of sight; he would 
have to destroy your magnetic orbital sensors before you have enough 
data to fire), but also to many complications, as the magnetic field is
very complex to mathematically model to predict its behavior. 

 On the other hand, generation of neutral particles such as neutrons 
require a radioactive source (as far as I know), with all its associated 
problems. They would not be affected by magnetic nor electrical fields, 
though.

 To summarize, I don\'t consider low-TL PA\'s to be efficient weapons in 
general (maybe we could suppose this changes at higher TL\'s, but that is 
quite risky in a hard SF setting. We need a good explanation).

  Anyway, they could be used as nice plot devices, if we consider them 
\'objects\' rather than just weapons. They can make space combat much 
richer, adding new tactical posibilities like the one I mentioned, but 
they can also give ideas for good scenarios :suppose that an attack 
against an orbital fleet is being planned with the "curved beam" 
technique, and the PC-s are hired by the attacker to make extensive scans of 
the planetary magnetic field, or escorting a surveying team to make them; or 
maybe a planetary government restricts research on mathematical modelling of 
magnetic fields for "national/planetary/whatever security reasons", and 
they have to steal the data from a military research center. Or maybe a 
space combat wits charged PA\'s coincides with a high stellar activity 
period, or...the possibilities are endless.

Actually, for cargo that can tolerate it (or whose containers can), the
warehouse may be nothing more than an orbital slot near the station,
with a beacon, and a cheap "foil" sunshade. 

Security is actually pretty good. Because traffic control will have a
record of everything that even came *close* to one of these "parking
slots".

	Hmmmm...against the determined political interference and active
trade embargo by it\'s natural geographic trade partner and largest
economic force in the world (the US) I think the fact that they\'re still
there and kicking is pretty well success enough. 

Yes, Cubans live in austerity, but they\'re a hell of a lot better off than
some of the _capitalist_ paradises in caribbean...Haiti, anyone? 

I dopn\'t want to get off in an off topic rant about evil commie cubans,
but 99% of their troubles have arisen because the US didn\'t like how they
did their revolution, and how they ran _their_ country, not because of any
inherent flaws in the communist system. 

Believe me...Cuba under Batista was in no way a democratic showcase. It
was just that he was on our side, not the Russians.

Besides...it\'s all the Yankees\' fault. If they\'d signed Castro as a second
baseman, none of this would have happened. ;-)

Just as support, (as if you needed any) Traveller Alien Module 1 : Aslan,
subtitled "Aventure and Intrigue with a Proud Warrior Race" states  :

" Aslan are descended from four-limbed carnivorous pouncer stock which
  was originally near the top of the food chain in the forests of
  Kusuyu (Kilrai\' 0406 A876986-E). "

and the original "Contact" Article from JTAS8(?) (by Loren & the Keith\'s)
states :

"They are descended from four-limbed, upright, bipedal
 carnivore/pouncer stock, originally adapted to a solitary
 arboreal existance. The earliest Terran explorers saw in
 them a vague resemblance to the terran lion, and they have
 been described as lion-like ever since, although there is
 very little resemblance"

I\'d suggest Maximus, it\'s free, runs well in a multitasking environment

However, these days it\'s probably more appropriate to use Bink
or something similar to set up a PPP login, and just provide
a web server. Web pages are more fun than BBS menus.

There should be a minimum size for T-plates that makes their use on missiles
this small prohibitive.  Please check the text, because a lot of these items
are located in the text because they don\'t fit (or make sense) on the tables.


This reminds me of a question someone had recently about FF&S2 hull designs and
skimming.  FF&S2 states that the hull has to have hypersonic streamlining if
it will skim fuel (on the theory that if you\'re going to go flying through an
atmosphere at double-digit Mach numbers, you\'ll need a hull that was designed
to handle flight at double-digit Mach numbers).  The question was that this
requires a high amount of "waste space", according to the streamlining tables.

The answer is to check the text - hulls over 1000 cubic meters have waste space
calculated as if they are 1000 cubic meters.  In other words, if the table
says 15% waste space for streamlining, you waste 15% of the volume of the hull, 
or 150 cubic meters, whichever is smaller.

Foundation had a massive star-spanning empire that was vaguely feudalistic.
Long travel times between planets (although in Foundation if I remember
correctly this was based on computational time, not jump drive ability).  As
in Traveller, the long travel times led to a fuedal society.  Psychohistory.

Is it possible for a squid to get tuberculosis?  And if it is, can it become
acute enough to be called Advanced?  I applaud Avalon Hill for supplying us

I like this, because it also allows for all sorts of aftermarket add-ons!  (I\'m
always looking for ways to separate the player from their credits)

\'Equenden Light Industries, LIC is proud to present ELI field stabilization
unit.  Connect this unit in parallel with your Zucchai crystals* and activate
after Jump breakout - this unit is damp the post-jump field harmonics, returning
your Lanthium grid to a zero state in 75% of rated time!  With our automated
controllers and damping technologies (available as upgrades), it is actually
possible to return your grid to a zero state in as little as 50% of the normal
rated time!!  See your ELI representative today for additional information and
estimates!

* Use concurrent with an active jump field voids the warranty and is strongly

We do have them, but they\'d make truly lousy weapons.  Obviously, if you
were standing directly in front of the business end of (say) the Stanford
Linear Accelerator, you\'d be in very bad shape...but you could do
equivalent damage with a pistol, which is considerably smaller and cheaper
than SLAC. :)

Also, all current PAs accelerate charge particles only, so the output beam
would very rapidly disperse (over just a few meters, mostly likely) in an
atmosphere. 

In point of fact, I\'ve never understood how an in-atmosphere PAW was
supposed to work; how do you maintain vacuum in the tunnel, but allow the
particle beam out the end of the tunnel?

	first of all Stalinism is not Communism, its a dictature comparable
	to Hitlers fashism, imho. If you compare them and add Maoism, you
	have about 100 million victims, 4 times those 25 million victims of
	Hitlers fashism. Both are a shame.

	I would rather think, that the successful communes have been anarchist.
	Anarchism can be economic viable inside a capitalist system.

	I\'ve founded and lived in the Finkenburg for years, and this commune
	has grown from one house 10 years ago to a dozen houses plus one former
	US barrack today. The housing allone is worth of around 5 million DM.

	Together with several similar anarchist communes it forms the
	"project A" which has an unknown size of several 100 millon DM (0.7$)
	including its own association bank. Once you managed to build up a
	shadow economy, the lack of tax in this economy becomes an important
	factor for accumulating capital. "The Power of Disaperance" is of
	course a major factor in success, and makes counting difficult, as
	only members have a shimmer of links between the many small projects,
	and nobody holds a general overview.

> That historical example is the first century Christians.  They held
> everything in common and if any of them needed they got.

	As (unlike you suggestion) not all members had been "voluntary and
	free to leave at any time", and I\'m drawing the line between anarchism
	and communism with the distinction of mutual free share of life and
	the slavery of a "masters plan", you could call them communist with
	full right. In this definition Israels Kibuz system is the most
	successfull working communism in current time. Most funny its in the
	same region. Traditional communism can also be found in many rural
	regions in the 3rd world, where the whole cottage shares the same
	acre and pasture. In Europa this system of "communism" was destroyed
	late between 1700 and 1900, by landlords claiming the former pastures
	and drawing fences for their sheep.

	Communism as a economic system can work under a lot of conditions
	including religious or political belief, tradition or oppression,
	often its a mix of all.

	ObTrav: Traveller does\'nt have communism/capitalism as government
	codes as its posible to interprete communism into nearly of the codes.
	But Traveller has a canon region (Tansa) and culture (Lancia), which
	could be considered communist in a lot of relations. An other canon
	reference of communism can be found at World Tamers Handbook page 41,
	that pointed out that most Colonies start out with "Controlled Economy".
	As communism has nothing to do with freedom a "captative colony" is
	likely to classify as being communist.

Ah, yes.. I remember Craig throwing me to the floor, sticking his copy of
Foundation in my hand, and threatening me with dire effects (such as the
end of our Traveller sessions) if I didn\'t read it immediately.

I read it in one sitting.  Great stuff.

Of course, I also read The Hobbit in one sitting, on board a cruise ship,
and was so engrossed that I ignored a life-boat drill...

If you were in front of the business end of SLAC, you\'d also be under a
mountain.  For those not familar with the facility, SLAC is a building

I never said near C.  In an atmosphere, 5000ft/sec is about the upper limit
before *any* round starts to melt.  Once you get the power supply problem
fixed (MDs need a load of power), the advantages are obvious.  All of the
round is projectile; you aren\'t hauling propellent and casings with you,
this allows a larger load.  Due to the extremely high velocity of the
round, you can build a smaller bore weapon with the same damage
characteristics as a much larger conventional gun.

The US Army was messing around with an experimental railgun-armed vehicle.
Before the project was dropped due to the power supply problem, they had
built a 40mm cannon which hit as hard as the sabot round fired from the
120mm main gun of a M1 tank.  The thing was almost 5m long, and had other
problems, but the technology is coming.

First, let me say that I am *not* trying to ressurect the whole cargo loading
debate that flamed so wonderfully during the infamous piracy wars...

I can see where it would work for some cargos, especially ones that need
long-term storage and can take hard vacuum.  (what to do with that cargo you got
stuck with, and there is no market?)

I\'m not sure that putting it in orbit around the mainworld would work tho\'.
Close orbits are expensive (that\'s what we pay cr 100 for the first week, then
cr 100 per day for...), and the further out you place it, the worse the security
would be.

Which brings up another point...are insystem craft (shuttles, etc) required to
have transponders the same as jump ships?

What skills would be required to break into a warehouse? (Intrusion and
Electronics?)  What skills would be needed to get the cargo off-world? (Admin
and Bribery/Forgery?)  What skills would be needed to access free-orbit cargo?
(Forgery/Bribery?)

Let us not forget the Chinese.  Last I heard they were under a communist

What I meant to say was:

Also, all current PAs accelerate charged particles only, so the output
beam will suffer serious absorption effects at quite short range (just a
few meters, probably).  Even if one buys the FFS model of \'atmospheric
tunneling\', current PAs probably don\'t have beam energy densities high
enough to produce the effect to a useful extent.

No argument here, but in the Tulsa local dialing area (the largest in USA),
there are over 100 active public BBS\'s and many of them have some great

Well 2 out of 3, I\'m not on the above list but yes to the other 2. So I

I would at least put them on a profit share. Give the crew 10% of net
revenue a ship earns as pay and bonuses, and have the brokers cut in for
three points of the profit on every cargo they arrange. Or something like
that.

Yup. You might even store them on lo-tech worlds, where warehouse costs are
lower.

Patrol cruiser ? Feh. Assuming you are fighting light ships, you want light
weapons. Sit down with a copy of FFS2 and design a 10 dton fighter with a
600 MJ laser (well, at least 400 megajoules).

In game, pay a naval architect a lot of money to design a way of modifying
one of your existing standard-model traders to carry a half-dozen or so of
these.

Quietly get your count friend to investigate the possibility of getting one
of the licences for nuke-det missiles that the Navy doesnt issue. Or at
least a nice note from the Subsector Admiral in case you get busted. And
equip your Q-ship with a nuke damper (50kkm range) in any case.

Then go pirate hunting. Seven laser-armed bogeys should overload his sand
capabilities, allowing the hope of hitting two of his power plant, jump
drive and maneauver drive.

The alternative is the Elisabeth class Frontier Trader - although it *is*
probably well armed enough (2.1 gigajoule laser battery) to be classed as a
Colonial Cruiser *grin*.

At risk of being self serving, I also like the White Lightning for
anti-pirate work as well - it\'s the militarised version of the Moonshine 9G
Famile Spofulam fast freighter. Basic 9G hull, plus a pair of PAWs, extra
sand and a nuke damper. Armour is thin, but for 9 gees, what do you expect ?

If you want to be really sneaky, put out feelers to the pirates, and offer
to fence goods for them. Build up a relationship. Be nice to them. Then rat
on them to the Navy.
It\'s hard to be vengeful when you\'ve been nuked to glow.

Bits of it. In the end, I think it comes down to whether you regard the
Imperium as having the world or the noble as it\'s integral unit.

If you think the Imperium is made up of worlds and a series of interworld
bureaucracies headed by the Emperor, then taxes are probably levied on the
Imperium\'s consituent governments, then spent thru the IN, BuJustice,
BuColonisation and so on.

If you think the Imperium is made up of nobles who hold fealty from the
Emperor, then taxes per se may not be levied by the Imperium - rather,
nobles would own worlds or parts of worlds and/or have limited or unlimited
rights of taxation on their feifs (eg Duke Snorri is owed Cr10 per
displacement ton of hydrogen extracted from his most noble fief, the gas
giant Makhudan VI). The Emperor and his Imperium would be funded by the
rights held directly by the Emperor (eg a "golden share" of 20% in all
companies with an Imperial Warrant <eg xyz LIC>), and by the various feudal
levies on the nobility (eg having to pay the Emperor a years income when
the fief passes etc etc).

The Imperium could also have drifted from one system to another over time
.... between Cleon the Mad, Arbatrella and the Civil Wars, through to the
reforms of the seriously delayed if not late Strephon, there is lots of
room for fundamental reform of Imperial taxation.

There are also canon references to privately owned starports. It is also
cool to have starports given as fiefs ("In recognition of your services to
the Emperor Cleon and His Navy, we hereby invest you with a life feof to
the starport of Wendlesson/Massilla"), or owned by the planetary government
but still not subject to planetary law. Or have an Imperial starport
(inconvenient, but with an extrality fence) and a local starport (all the
traders are there, but it\'s subject to local law).

I think that "changes" is a better word than decreases.

I think T4 needs Merchant Prince brought up to speed. I think mapping out a
process of how a company managed the slow haul from fledgeling up would be
an excellent theme to wrap the supplement around.

It can happen backwards too ... the death of a megacorp would be a massive
opportunity for adventure and profit (I am reminded of Alan Marshall\'s
autobiography ... he was an accountant in a failing company in the Great
Depression, and the day before the company was to be liquidated, he sold
the worker\'s rented houses to them for whatever cash they had. He risked
legal action from the company\'s liquidators and possible jail, but the
ex-employees would have a legal title to their houses and not be thrown out
onto the street).

Looking at the numbers, it\'s not that much money, at least not compared to

*nod* although having the Factor safe and in orbit could have advantages as
well.

Has anyone designed any small, cheap orbital facilities under FFS2 ?

	I agree that the "technology" behind the story line is not as close to
Traveller, but my intentions were to point out my view point of how the
background stories are similar.  There may not be a \'real\' connection
between the two sets of books (i.e. Traveller and Foundation), but I
certainly see several points that _could_ be used to help flesh out the
traveller time line during a period that is vaugely recorded.

   How successful Cuba turned out to be was determined the day the Russians
(aka Soviets) cut off all the aid they had been pouring into the country
(IMHO, the real reason the Americans didn\'t invade Cuba all those years
wasn\'t the fear of Soviet nuclear retaliation, it was the drain Cuba placed
on the Soviet\'s budget).  Cuba continues to survive on the infrastructure
built during the Cold War era, money generated from European tourists, and
the charisma of Fidel Castro, who has managed to keep the majority of Cubans
under his thumb and obedient through a combination of secret police tactics
and hours long hate speeches aimed at the US.

>Yes, Cubans live in austerity, but they\'re a hell of a lot better off than
>some of the _capitalist_ paradises in caribbean...Haiti, anyone? 

   Cuba is a repressive dictatorship, but it is well-run repressive
dictatorship.  Corrupt officials are rounded up, given a "show trial" and
shot (this has the side effect of making Fidel look good to his people).  In
Haiti, and in too many other places, corruption is considered to be part of
the social fabric.  The exceptional government official *not* on the
take--bribes are part of a business\' operating expenses.

   In conditions such as those, it\'s no wonder that Cuba looks good in
comparison.  A capitalist economy in and of itself is no guarantee of
prosperity for the masses.

>I don\'t want to get off in an off topic rant about evil commie cubans,
>but 99% of their troubles have arisen because the US didn\'t like how they
>did their revolution, and how they ran _their_ country, not because of any
>inherent flaws in the communist system. 

   We had no problem with their revolution per se, it was the company that
Castro insisted on keeping afterward, and his own words that made the US a
mortal enemy. 

   Remember, this is the guy who allowed the Soviets to base nuclear
missiles in his country aimed at the U.S.--that doesn\'t get you "Most
Favored Nation" Trade status, even if you paid the Clinton \'96 Presidential
Campaign a sizeable bribe (it did however work for China...).

>Believe me...Cuba under Batista was in no way a democratic showcase. It
>was just that he was on our side, not the Russians.

   It was a stereotypical banana republic, where the American Mafia
controlled a hefty percentage of hotels and casinos.  The US frankly didn\'t
give a rat\'s ass about Batista, which is probably why Castro and his people
were able to run a guerilla operation down there.  US intelligence was no
doubt looking at Castro\'s credentials (graduated from USC if I recall
correctly, and had spent a lot of time in the US) and figured that in the
worst case scenario he\'d turn out to be another Batista and if they had to
they\'d bump him off.  Seeing him standing around and buddying up to
Khrushchev and the gang later on came as a surprise to everybody (in a Ellen
Degeneres sort of way).

>Besides...it\'s all the Yankees\' fault. If they\'d signed Castro as a second
>baseman, none of this would have happened. ;-)

   There was more than one missed opportunity in the Cold War.  For example,
Ho Chi Minh was for all practical purposes in the back pocket of the
Americans (an OSS agent was present at the official ceremony in which Ho
declared Vietnam\'s independence, and Ho\'s guerilla band had regularly
cooperated with efforts to help locate downed American flyers, and resisted
the Japanese occupation) before British troops arrived and restored French
colonial rule as WW II came to an end.  

   Later on in the 1950s, the Americans sided with the French in their
struggle against the Vietnamese resistence (by then, Ho had started cozying
up to the Chinese--the Vietnamese natural enemy).  Had things worked out
differently, the newspapers of the day would have talked about "our friends
the Vietnamese, who stood in the face of Communist aggression from the north
(in this case the People\'s Republic of China), and their leader Ho Chi Minh".

As far as design, I guess much of ship design elements could be
utilized: power plants, hangars, airlocks, hatches, life support,
accomodations, sensors, communictations, weaponry and defenses, laps,
workshops, etc.  But what about things like stabilization thrusters,
manuevering gets, etc.?  The need for them would be much less, but the

Basically, it seems to me that many such structures would be fairly

ones.  But trading stations and starports might vary widely.

I guess what I\'m looking for is a Space Stations Architect\'s Manual more

Great supplement! I really like the stuff inside, although I do
sometimes wish the text matched the plans a little better. You notice
there just "aren\'t" any small ships using these layouts? Who cares - you
can always cram but I never had good layout ideas for the really, really
big ships (luxury liners, etc).

inflexion of a single statement, couldn\'t something similar be done in a
Traveller scenario? Often two words - or names - sound similar but mean
different things. There are two systems in the Spinward Marches that have
similar sounding names, and actually border each other. They are Dinom and
Dinomn. What fun one could have spending six months sending the characters
to the wrong place!

	And of course, there are a few systems too in the Marches that have
completely the same name! Heroni for instance is the name of a system in
both the Rhylanor and Mora subsectors! There are others, but I can\'t
remember what they are.

	So, be seeing ya!

Please allow me to correct a typo or two.  The first word of the 3rd line
(only) and the first two words of line 4 (were pointing) should not have
been there.  I replaced the errant words with a [] to indicate the
correction.

True, but they were not designed to be weapons.  A high pressure water jet
(like those used to clean hardwater deposits out of boilers) will cut a man
in half, but a long sword is cheaper.

The last thing I read on the subject (several years ago) was about a
proposed new technology using stimulated emission (like a LASER or MASER) to
seriously shorten tunnel lengths.  IIRC, it was on an order of thousandths,
so that a "tunnel" a few meters long could do the work of the old style
facilities that had tunnels measured in km.

Maybe one of the scientists who monitor and/or comment on TML will know what
I\'m talking about and could perhaps offer an update on progress.

I believe the "Yankees" are also to be blamed (by some) for Maoism.  Mao
came to the US to ask for help and was turned down cold, so he went to the
Soviets and they helped him.  Who knew?

I did not like it very much, though I do salute him for the many good
predicitons he made while looking into the future.  James Hogan\'s "Past
Through Tomorrow" had a strong communistic streak, and had a more
"realistic" feel for me.  But then, I am a sucker for any book with
antimatter as a power source.

Hogan also creates a society without money or material wealth being related
to status, but it has a more SF feel, as it is set on a colony in Alpha
Centauri.  It seems to mesh better, partly because he is writing closer to
today.  He has the advantage of high tech robots to do production, no
outside influences to force conformance, and a very small first generation,
such that a fad could become a culture.

I was reading the Deathstalker books recently and was intrigued by the
Church of Christ the Warrior.  Commando Deacons, Militant Monks,
Battling Bishops.  The leader of the church wore black battledress with
a white cross on it (I also pictured a little white square in the
rectangle).  While I can see that a game makers would want to keep out
of this potentially sensitive area (although I don\'t know if it was a
conscious decision or not), I think religion can be a very powerful tool

in both holding an interstellar empire together, or expanding one,
especially into low-tech systems.

There could be a connection to psionics, although I\'m not sure thats
ideal.  I had considered a parallel "Faith" stat, that would give
abilities similar to psionics like healing, etc., but that isn\'t ideal.
I think ultimately, no powers, etc., are necessary, and that those who
belong to a religion may receive what ever tangible benefits that church

can give (e.g., the church can give you a career assiting with spreading

the word or battling the infidel), but that they should be limited to
that church\'s codes of conduct losing those benefits if caught violating

them (and branded heretic, excommunicated, denied communion/nirvana,
etc.), with all the excellent role-playing opportunities that might
provide.

[Forgive the vaguely catholic tilt to my examples, they are presented as

illustration only.  Pastors, Rabbis, Imams, Dalai Llamas, those who
serve St. Elvis, etc., would all be possibilities.]

I appreciate any feedback.

The Simulated Emission system I spoke of earlier, would overcome the beam
density problem quite handily, without even needing a longer tunnel (just
longer to power up).  Just like a laser\'s energy density is directly related
to the length of time you can hold the energy in the stimulation system.

This has the interesting effect that it\'s actually vastly more efficient 
to streamline the whole AHL than to streamline
the fuel shuttles.

I was the person who asked about this, and I still
disagree - it\'s not clear to me that the
waste space numbers oare reasonable or
that you need the equivalent of hypersonic streamlining for earth to do 
meaningful skimming of atmosphere from a gas giant (where either the 
densities/pressures are much lower, or you\'re deep in the atmosphere and
don\'t need to move at hypersonic speed.)

Seriously, though: anyone who has SERIOUS (really, I mean it) serious ideas

In our game all ships have a reliability number. That is based on age ,
grade of annual maintenance and number of misjumps. You can rush turnaround
for jump but the reliability number of the ship affects the chance of
misjumping and the results. Sort of similiar results with newer ships being
the prefered ship for safety and for turnaround. the older the ship the
harder it is to keep up and the more expensive it is . After a while you
really would rather have a newer ship than the old clunker. It may be more
expensive but you can sleep at better at night knowing that you will live
to get to the next port.

If you have FF&S then you wouldn\'t ask, so here are some ideas I used before
I got it:

Using the QSDS:  Start with a 4000 Td Box U, and 6-5000 Td Wedge U.  Weld
the back ends of the 5,000 Td hulls to 5 of the 6 sides of the 4,000 Td
hull.  You now have a 34,000 Td hull.  Add 1,000 Td of Small Craft External
Grapples (say for 20 Pinnaces or 100 fighters or 25 Cutters or some
combination adding up to 1,000 Td total) to bring your total to 30,000 Td.
Install a 108 Td HEPlaR drive (or a 536 Td T-Plate) to give you 1 g (10
m/s/s) accelleration.  Or install an 11 Td HEPlaR drive (or 54 Td T-Plate)
to give you a 0.1 g (1 m/s/s) accelleration.  Or...  Everything else (power
plants, accomodations, weapons, etc.) is pretty much standard.

Let me know if you find anything like that.  If you want some ship deck
plans, you might check out http://www.ifi.uio/~tommyg/Trav/Trav_ships.html
or, you might try following the ring.  I think I saw more elsewhere on it,
but I can\'t remember where.

I was wondering if you could use the waste space or a portion of it for fuel

As of right now, I pay $19.95/mo. for my access to the internet, including
my access to the TML  This does not include the line charge (another
(estimated) $20/mo.).  Both of which go to GTE who provides both the
telephone and internet service.  So that is not even the question.  The
question is (or should be) can the TSP change the terms of my agreement?  I
signed up for them to provide a line into my house for c. $20/mo. with an
understanding that I could use my line at any hour of the day, and for as
long as I wish.  My sister and I have both grown up and moved out, but, I
can remember when the line at home was constantly tied up from about 3:30
\'til after 9:30 every weeknight and from 9:30 or 10 AM to as late as
midnight on weekends.  Did they offer to add a charge on our lines then?  Do
they offer to add a charge on homes now with a talkative teen now?  No.  So
why should I have to pay a per minute charge, just because it is my computer
actually doing the talking?

And what do you think will happen if they allow the TSP\'s to charge per
minute for connections to an ISP?  My dear old granddad used to say,  "There
is nothing more permanent than a temporary tax."

>... Now you\'ve got people tying up a line all the time and they expect

Once again, that is not even the question.  I made an agreement with GTE
will they be allowed to renege on or not?

How long did you save for yours?  I\'ve been saving for years.  I pulled in
all the favors I was owed, and I still owe on the machine I am responding
on.  Your argument is specious.

Frank and Marc made up the list of Emperors...I don\'t know if it was
intentional or not. In any case, Isaac Asimov influenced us all. How could he
not? He was one of the group that invented the future...

the Mean Time Between Failures and Decay over Time rules for Trav. (pet
project low priority). Any way, I have come across several pages of
information on MTBF in hours for modern day subsystems (mostly electronics)
that I believe will parallel those found on Star Ships.

At any rate the reason for writing this at this time is this particular
thread and the discussion it\'s generating fits in. What I\'d like to ask the
list is: What type of subsystems do you see involved in a Jump Drive? If you
accept the theory that the J-drive is a massive geration unit I can use some
modified models on Gas Turbine Generators (which are currently FAR more
reliable and need FAR less maintenence today than any of the current game
stats! Of course your not placeing your life on the line everytime you use
them either!) that I already have running. If some other theory is to be
used to base the J-drive on, what type of modern equipment (ie, electronic,
turbine, compressor, reactor etc.) most fits the theory? Most other systems
have modern paralells that just need to be tweaked, but, of course the
J-drive is totally unknown! Any and all input is appriciated.

Don\'t hold your breath waiting for results. They WILL be posted, but I\'m not
sure when and it\'s liabel to be a while down the road!

Yeah. Waste space is dumb just for the fuel reason. Waste in a ship
that needs 20%+ of its volume for fuel--and fuel that\'ll fit in any
shape container at that? Dumb.

Adding something that allos _inner_ walls to be tought enough so
that fuel can fill the spaces could be a cheap add on.

              and                     6,1,0 meaning sector 6 (Coreward
Spinward), etc., etc.
Band two is made up of  1,2,0 and 1,2,1   -   2,2,0 and 2,2,1   -  
3,2,0 and 3,2,1 
                                        4,2,0 and 4,2,1   -   5,2,0 and

                                        2,3,0 - 2,3,1 and 2,3,2
			    etc. etc.
Now lets say we use Capital  (2118) Core as the center of our universe.
It becomes 0,0,0. Using the Atlas of the Imperium, Nimluin (2209) Core
becomes 1,9,1, Ispumer (2615) Core becomes 2,5,0, Gurishi (3022) Core
becomes 3,9,0, Skeen (2226) Core becomes 3,9,8 etc.
If a navigator was at Nimluin, Gurishi or Skeen, he would know that he
had travelled a total distance of 9 parsecs away from Core (5 in the
case of Ispumer) and had made a 1, 0 or 8 respectively parsec starboard
deviation from the norm.
Continuing out a long way, Terra (1827) Sol becomes 4,131,3, Regina
(1910) Spinward Marches becomes 5,130,128. Terra is 131 parsecs from
Capital at a 3 parsec starboard deviation ( (3/130x 60)+(3x60) or
181.385 degrees).  Regina is 130 parsecs from capital at a 128 parsec
starboard deviation (128/130x 60)+(4x60) or 299.076 degrees).
Notice that the deviation number can only total to 1 less than the band
number, the (((sextant number -1) times 60) plus the ((deviation number
divided by band number ) times 60)) will give the degree angle direction
from center, and  the deviation parsec is always at an angle of  the
((band number times 60) + 120) degrees.
I realize the numbering system is a little more cumbersome than our
present system but it appears to relay more usable information without
remembering the location of 560 sub-sectors within 35 sectors, or more
if you go outside *known* space. 
Using the s,bbb,ddd number combination we could expand our borders out
to 997,000+ parsecs in any of 6 directions. It could also be applied to
those referees using 3D space adding a fourth number set indicating
plus/minus for up/down direction.

I would use a high energy power transfer system, plus a high-energy antenna,
plus mechanical pumping components.  The drive would probably not be unlike
the GTG\'s you mentioned provided such systems generate large amounts of
electricity.  And you added the antenna (the jump grid).  Any part doesn\'t
work, no jump.

 There are indeed deckplans in several places in the webring, and a number
off of it. Despite the age of the list (and the stale addresses therein)
the list of links on the Imperium Games Links page has several with good
deckplans on them. Hunt around.

  As far as stations are concerned, several options occur to me. If you
have any of the oooold traveller stuff from, say, Judges Guild or FASA,
take a look at "The Doom of the Singing Star" (from JG). The ship named
in the title is a ~30kton "liner" with decks for quarters and decks for
entertaining and decks for shopping.  The ship is oriented with
perpendicular decks (like the Lightning class and the XBoat Tender).
All you would need to do is create one new deck type that provides
docking booms, then ignore the need for drives. Stack decks to taste;
reasonably instant station.
  Similar can be done (and has been done, in Challenge) with the
deckplans of the Lightning class.
  Judges Guild also did an adventure called Drak\'ne Station, which
is a large, tunneled-out asteroid.

  FASA did a very small station in Adventure Class Ships Vol 1. The
depicted plans cover a pair of administrative shuttle docks and central
traffic control, but happily ignore the rest...
  FASA also did a Hotel complex plan set. Like the Singing Star, this
can be tailored easily to become a stacked station.

  Borrowing from the starships again, take a look at the Classic/MT
version of the Lab Ship. Treat the plan scale as if it were a 6m or 12m
scale instead of the 1.5m scale it really is. Treat the original internal
walls as major bulkheads, do some typical office/retail/entertainment
spaces, and you have a serviceable torus station.

  For the big spheres in use in later Imperial space (the big fellow
in "The Flaming Eye"), just do the plans for the bits visited by the
PCs and don\'t worry about the overall picture. Since the central docking
wells of these stations can be 150m or more in diameter, you simply
don\'t need to worry about the little details for the whole station.

  If you _really_ need to, try to dig up a copy of the deckplans for the
original Enterprise (Star Trek: The Old Fogeys).  The plans for the saucer
are nearly circular and can be stacked with a great deal of disregard for
their original purpose...  The original Star Trek Technical Manual is also
worth a look, since it has plans for the big tug pods and for a typical
starbase of the period.
  Newer Trek yields Deep Space Nine, a monster of a flat torus station.
Quite big enough that walls rarely need to show a curve. Use fairly
ordinary building plans for internal detail. If we are patient, that
new company that is doing a Star Trek RPG might produce deckplans for the
thing...
  From the FASA attempt at Star Trek, find a copy of the Regula-1 station
supplement.

  If you want true monsters of stations, simply chop three long rectangles
out of a county map and make them into a single station of the classic
L5 type (see the anime Mobile Suit Gundam for some examples). You don\'t
need deckplans as such, because the station is mostly an outdoor
experience!

So you could replace the JD and the Hull :)

Richard A. Flores countered:

The hull should be unaffected.  However, the grid could degrade with use.
Even so there are rules for adding a jump grid to an existing ship.  Costs
and time should be the same, just lay the new grid over the old one.  They
don\'t weigh much and they only cost, lets see... "Adding a hull grid to an
existing hull costs cr 150 per [cubic meter] of hull."  (FF&S p 12)

Thanks for the suggestions, but like I said, I have no CT, MT, TNE stuff.  Used
to have CT but my collection was spotty, although I still remember the tactile
thrill when one of those odd-sized little black books with the cover that was
smooth but more than smooth.  No offense to Marc and the rest, but those sure
beat the hell out of the current perfectly bound, regular sized books whose
spins show wear and tear after only a couple of gentle perusings.  Having said
that, as a GM, I\'d love each component to be in separate smaller books with
three hole punches.   oh, wait.  I\'ve made this rant on the list before ;-)

  One essayist (Craig Thomas - not that I\'m recommending the book)
argues persuasively that Hobbes\' purpose was to present the best
argument that a coercive gov\'t was simply necessary. He manages
to largely ignore the fact that the ECW made this a pretty good
case to be made at the time, but he\'s mainly concerned with the
current decade anyway.

  Interestingly, it\'s entirely possible (either through the Long Night
or the period 0-1100 3I) that many worlds will have gone through a
wide range of government and/or ideology types, not always at the
same time.

  Some possibility for humour in the backwoods can arise if the players
learn of a revolution in ideology, complain that the UWP hasn\'t been
updated, and then learn that the IISS considered no change to have
occurred. "Worse", they might be right :)

I don\'t think that even naval bases (orbital, or deep) would be all that
similar.  They may be built from the same modular components, but that\'s where
the similarities would end.  At least the way I imagine space stations (of all
sorts).  I would think that they would get pieced together over a long period,
sections would be removed and replaced when the cost of maintenance got too
high.

But that could be my own personal bias, because I rather like the idea of
things like this "growing" and "shrinking" based on use.  For example, a
station near Vegan territory might have been alot larger when the war with the
Solomani was in full swing.  After the conquest of Terra, the personnel and
hardware may have been moved further forward, the original base being reduced
considerably in the process as maintenance of all of the empty spaces would
become more expensive and time consuming.

Probably. The "Dumarest" books I read were in old Ace Doubles. And they
quit making thoses back in the late 60s or early 70s. The individual

Microfoil:

Starship crews, surface teams, military and mercenary units, and those in the
civilian sector all have a need to join metals at one time or another.  Tanks
of fuel and oxygen require a good deal of volume and can be quite heavy.

Microfoil is the solution to this problem.  Microfoil is made up of a number
of extremely thin layers consisting of boron, carbon, silica or aluminum
combined with a transition metal.  The different components are selected
carefully to ensure a self-propagating, high temperature exothermic reaction
when exposed to a small amount of heat (such as the spark from a battery, a
match or a lighter, for example).  The temperature is high enough to melt a
filler to make a weld.  The thinner the layer, the less time the reaction
takes, and the less time oxygen has to mix with the metals, so the joints are
stronger then those welded with more traditional welding equipment.  The
layers of foil are generally between 20 atoms and 2,000 nanometers across.

The technology is introduced at TL9, but it is prohibitively expensive due to
the exacting specifications the foils must be made to.  At TL10, the
production process is refined, but still rather expensive.  By TL12, microfoil
can be made cheaply and easily.

Microfoil welding kits will vary in mass and price, due mostly to the
availability of the filler metals and the strength of the joints required.
Most members of a starship engineering crew, combat engineers and many
mechanics will carry thick pen-sized "sparkers" to perform on the spot welds
when required.  The foils themselves mass very little (the average packet
weighs about as much as a small notepad, and can contain several hundred
applications).

TL9     Cr2,000 per application.  (About 25-50% more for starship hull grade)
TL10    Cr500 per application.  (About 10-25% more for starship hull grade)
TL11    Cr25 per application.  (No extra charge for starship hull grade)

  First I typed "hull", then changed it to "deck plating". So
you buy a model with easily installed replacement grid modules.
It seems to be the techno-babble fix(^n) problem. I much prefer
to just nail them on yearly maintenance costs, say x%, where x
increases by one-tenth of its starting value each year, so that
a ten-year old ship costs double to maintain.

  If x starts at 1% (high, perhaps, YMMV), then a 40-year old
ship costs 5% of new cost to maintain each year (average). This
allows for the tramp to develop a tendency to suffer expensive
repairs on backwaters or when the players lack liquidity <snicker>.

I use it exclusively in my campaign. The big advantage of RPSCS is that
well suited for using during a game session. If is action-packed and fun
for the players because they take an active role in the combat. The only
complaint I have of it is its use of spaceship counters and a map board. I
find these to slow down the play for little benefit, so I just use an
abstract distance scale (boarding, close, medium, long, and extreme range)
in my campaign.

RPSCS is easy to use, too. I think it\'s needed because the T4 space combat
system is not well suited to using in an active campaign, IMHO. It doesn\'t
take the skills or actions of individuals into account, only provides an
active role for a single player for an entire ship, and is undramatic in
the sense that the crew is treated as an undifferentiated unit. It seems
designed more for a wargame than a role-playing game. Moreover, I simply
like a lot of the RPSC combat rules better; like ranges, sensors, missiles,
and battle damage.

Ideally, I would like to see the RP and basic starship combat systems
integrated; so I could run a combat for a large number of ships, including
a player ship. The players would role-play the combat while the other ships
could be handled in a more wargaming-oriented method.

No. I read all of them in the mid seventies. My copy of "The Winds of Gath"
the first in the series is copyright 1967, and even "Jondelle", the tenth
in the series, is copyright 1973.

Of those listed in the post, Collision Course, Breakawway (Spacee 1999
TV series novelizations), The Coming Event, and The Terra Data
are definitely not Dumarest Saga books, and some that are not listd as
Dumarest Saga books, such as Veruchia (6th), Melome, Jondelle(10th),
& The Jester at Scar (5th) are Dumarest Saga books.

I\'d say wherever you got the list from needs they\'re data updating.

My only complaint is that it should have been released either as a
piece of software (so you could assemble all those pieces into complete
deckplans and print them out ) or with all the layouts printed on
heavy cardstock like the pieces from "Space Crusade" so you could
assemble them manually on your table as required.

In fact, that\'s the thing I\'ll most likely do with it, photocopy the
whole book, cut out the deckplans and stick them on cardboard.

When I said Bink I was just talking about the Binkleyterm
mailer, which is a free and pretty standard Fido mailer.

I got mine from a local BBS :-)
I\'d presume that it\'s probably available on a web page somewhere
too, try an AltaVista or Lycos search on it.

I currently run Bink as the front end,
It manages my usenet news and mail callouts to my
ISP via RASdial PPP, accepts incoming fax calls, and
allows callers access to my Maximus BBS.

I\'m currently researching how to kick off Windows Dial-up server
from a command line utility, so that I can provide dial up access
to my web server. So far, looks like I might have to write
something.

If I can get it going though, Bink handles mutltiple BBS\'s with ease,
and I hope to be able to convince it that DUS & PPP is just another BBS.

I would suggest that you base your maneuver drive and power plant
MTBF charts on those for modern nuclear submarines, and base your
maintenance practices on those also,

Jump drives, however, are different. They should be based on
the MTBF and maintenance practices of a modern particle accelerator or
fusion power plant like Sandia Labs.

My take is that they really aren\'t the sort of technology that the FAA
would normally allow in commercial use, but they are just too damn
useful to regulate out of existence.

A good modern (and ancient) example of this would be the Chinese.  They have
an ancient saying, "You may conquer us today, but, tomorrow your children
will be Chinese."  This was usually said to the Japanese that conquered that
nation several times.  As you see history unfolding, it seems that the
communism that now rules that ancient land is coming more and more to
resemble what China has always had in they way of government.

	Yup, most of ours too I should think.

	Maybe the answer to everything else is under our noses too, like,
logically, the universe should not exist. So if we proved it so, would it

I know of no works predating the works of the good doctor that refer to such
a system of mathematics/manipulation.  He didn\'t introduce robots, but the
3(4) laws of robotics are all his.  He said he didn\'t care who used them as
long as they didn\'t quote them.

Anyone ever hear of or use "Evening Star"?  It was an asteroidal source of
monopoles (that\'s what the history said), converted to a Luxury Resort.  I
used to base a campaign out of that thing.  I still have the book around
somewhere.

The point is if you want to go for something like that, you could get high
altitude survey photos of just about any town or city.  "Deck Plans" would
be any standard housing, shopping, etc. floor plans you can get your hands
on.

Don\'t forget just how much room there is. even close in. And "close"
can be "a couple hundred km".

Yep. For the same reason all commercial aircraft have them (and private
aircraft would too if the FAA had its way). It\'s pretty much a
requirement for traffic control.

ECM skill and gear, for one. And it\'d cost very little to add a radio
"screamer" proximity alarm to the setup. Fail to send the right
"combination" and the alarm starts broadcasting to everybody that
somebody is trying to rip you off.

My version of routien maintainence is it must be done once every 30
days.  It takes only
1 day and costs 0.01% of the cost of the ship.  (filters, gaskets, light

True Story. A friend was vacationing in Wales, and literally *stumbled*
across Port Merion (where the Village" scenes were shot) while out
hiking. Not knowing that it was a *real* place, rather than a set, he
almost had heart failure. He noted that he *would* have had one if
there\'d been any partially inflated weather balloons about!

Hypersonic streamlining is hypersonic streamlining, at least for a
*wide* range of fluid densities (from near vacuum to something over 1
one atmosphere). 

All that changing the density (which follows the pressure) does is
change the speed of sound, and thus the speed at which you are
"hypersonic". But it\'s virtually certain that you\'d have to be
travelling at hypersonic speeds to skim from a gas giant. Going down
where low speeds will do requires a *lot* of delta-v, or good CG. *And*
it exposes you to storms and turbulence that make hurricanes look tame.

The title has "Tommorrow" in it, or perhaps "Tomorrows", but it *isn\'t*
"Past Through Tomorrow". That was an old Heinlein collection.

A quick check of the only two Hogan books I have that *aren\'t* in
storage gives "The Two Faces of Tomorrow" as the likely title.

Swapping out the J-Drive (including required tests to make sure the
"new" unit is hooked up ok, and properly integrated with the ships\'s
systems" probably takes *at least* a week. Maybe two.

You *could* design ships where the J-Drive was in a sort of "pod" that
bolts onto the ship, and has pre-placed connectors. But that makes the
design more expensive. And you need to have the right sort of "pod"
available. I\'d be willing to bet thast designing the drive that way
makes it *harder* to do the "maintenance" on once you get it removed
from the ship. So you\'d be paying for *increased* maintenance costs,
*plus* the cost of labor and equipment for swapping the drive pod
*plus* the capital costs of keeping drive pods around so that they\'ll
be available for swapping.

In short, you could save time that way, but it\'d $cost$. As usual in
the real world, saving time takes money.

I\'ve also heard the quite reasonable *counter* argument that the model
being used was *known* to no longer match actual usage as early as the
mid 70s. but they kept on using it.

comp.dcom.telecom tends to cover this sort of thing from time to time.

Ok, right off the top of my head, *regardless* of what theory you use,
we know that a J-Drive has to handle a given amount of LH2 in a
specific (fairly short) period of time. So if nothing else, one
component *has* to be a high speed, high volume pump for *very*
cryogenic liquids. That\'s going to require a moderate amount of
maintenance.

It may also be one of the system limits, in that you have to start by
runnning "cool" hydrogen gas thru it and increase the speed and
decrease the temp according to a definite "schedule". Ditto for
stopping it at the end and warming it back to ambient temp.

And there\'s also little argumebt that the J-drive *is* handling a large
amount of energy. So at least part of the drive is going to be
equivalent to a high voltage/high current electrical switching unit.

The part equivalent to the gas turbine is likely to be more like an MHD
generator, which is actually *less* likely to need maintenance. Other
than throat erosion, there\'s very little that *can* happen to an MHD
unit. 

Somewhere in there, there\'s a unit that fuses a greater or lesser
portion of the hydrogen. What portion depends on which theory you use.
Buit in any case, we need a high flow rate unit to take LH2 and feed it
into the "reactor" without disrupting the plasma. And a unit to extract
the "waste products" from the plasma. I assume that these would both be
a sort of counter current heat exchanger where the "exhaust" (possibly
*after* the MHD generator) is used to preheat the incoming LH2, and the
LH2 cools the exhaust.

(Attempt at block diagram)

+----+
| LH2 pump |
+----+----+
      |           +----+
      v        +->+ reactor |
+----+----+  |  +----+----+
|    heat   +->+       |
|           |          v
| exchanger +<-+  +----+----+     +----+
+----+----+  |  |    MHD    |     | jump |
      |        +<-+           +---->+      |
      v           | generator |     | grid |
+----+----+     +----+     +----+
|  exhaust  |
+----+

This leaves out all the flow monitors and other control & monitoring
circuitry. But all the connections shown (except the generator->grid
link) are going to be some pretty major "plumbing". The generator->grid
link is going to be heavy duty *cabling*.

All the other wiring and plumbing is going to be the usual festoons of
wires.

For the "hydogen supports the jump bubble/opens the "gateway" school,
the heat exchanger/exaust setup is the most important. For the "it all
goes into \'charging\' the drive" school, the reactor/generator is the
most important.

When you are using waste space to represent streamlining, the space isn\'t
really there.  It\'s a way to represent the increased hull area for the
same volume that you get when you start streamlining.  There are two ways
to go, multiply surface area by some factor or decrease usable volume by
some factor.

	I visited there a few years ago, and it is a wonderful place. It\'s very
much smaller though than it appears in The Prisoner. Across the road from
the complex, is the Festiniog Railway, where they shot Ivor the Engine, if
anyone remembers that.

This isn\'t 100% true at low tech levels; it\'s hard to make efficient
cryogenic fuel tanks in arbitrary complicated shapes. For example,
the X-33 (which probably qualifies as Hypersonic AF streamlining) will
have a fair amount of interior waste space. Of course, it\'s 
weight-driven much than a Traveller ship is...

Although I agree with you in principle, I\'m afraid that line of
reasoning is erroneous.

You see, when you connect with the internet, you are not making *just* a
local call. You are using all kinds of long distance exchanges and
hopping around the world. If your talkative teen calls up someone in
Hong Kong, do you expect per minute charges? Of course.

Now, there\'s all kinds of other arguments against per minute charges for
the internet, which have already been discussed. Cable companies, and
even digital satellite dish companies, are or will be offering internet
services, so I\'m quite confident that in North America internet service
will tend to be charged by a flat rate.

Good point - to succeed they\'d need to handle it with kid gloves and be

the last time I played was just as MegaTraveller was coming out.  I have 
a few questions to ask of anyone who really knows the down and out of 
what\'s ogne on in the traveller universe, but I apologize for those of 
you who have seen questions such as this a hundred times on this 
list...feel free to respond in private if you wish to save the rest of 
the list from boredom...

First of all, could I get a timeline on the various games?  CT was around 
1105 or so, right?  And then MT was 1115 or 1116 and the following years; 
TNE was years after that (the whole virus thing) and then T4 is 0, which 
is 1115 years before MT?  Is this correct?

So based on this, how much of the universe is mapped out in T4?  The Core 
subsector is entirely different from that of MT...there is a Sylea 
region, but no Sylea world in MT, whereas Sylea (the world in Core 
subsectot) is the origin of the third imperium, apparently, in T4.  Have
the rest of the subsectors in the Spnward Marches been 
discovered/explored yet, or are these subsectors going to be 
rewritten as well?  And/or when they ARE discovered, will there be an 
identicacl layout to that of the spinward marches from MT?

Forgive me if there are easy answers to all these questions in books such 
as First Survey or Mileau 0...Shipping appears to be quite behind ai IG, 
and I haven\'t received these yet...it\'s been a month since I ordered 
them, at least...<SIGH>


So anyways, thanks in advance for any help that I amy receive from any of 
you on this issue.

My appologies to those on the TML who are feeling more rodent like.

I also sent many test to my home (where I am sending this post)  I

I don\'t understand why this program insists on sending winmail.dat.  I
followed the help instructions and turned off the "send as microsoft

I know this is off topic but if anyone has experience with Microsloth

understand it is unwanted, anoying, and eats up drive space. My most
sincere appologies for this.

Untill I figure this out, It looks like i will have to not send posts

Exactly my point.  The Imperium licenses and controls Jump-capable ships, do they
also control non-jump ships?  To use your example, the FAA requires transponders
on commercial aircraft, but they do not require them on private aircraft, even
tho\' the two operate in the same area.

So knowing the response time of the security crews responsible for the cargo would
be a good thing!  :)

I think that having \'shelters\' would probably be better.  Cheap hulls with a small
power supply, docking facility, and floor plates.  It has the advantage of making
cargo handling easier, doesn\'t take up potentially valuable ground space, and it
would not be possible to tell at a glance whether or not cargo was currently
present, or how much cargo it contained.

 Bill (and any others thinking of using Outlook):

There is an error in the original code (i.e. what\'s on the CD) that causes any \'reply to:\' address to automatically be formatted in
..rtf format (creating a winmail.dat).

There is an upgrade on the MS website that will resolve this problem.

True story.

A german woman was going to visit San Jose, Costa Rica.  Her travel agent
put her on a plane to San Jose.. California.  Luckily, the hotel she ended
up at had a German-speaking desk clerk, and they managed to get her on a
flight heading south, but the possibilites are there...

Got it in one.  TNE is set around 1200.  The final end of the Imperium was
about 1130.  T4 is set at the Imperium\'s founding, the Year 0 up to about 200.

The Milieu:0 Campaign has a useful guide to how fast the Imperium expands.
In 0, the Imperium has at least explored most of Core, and recontacted Vland.

Explorers and Merchants reach the Spinward Marches around 50 (since they
contact the Zhodani around 60, and that happens spinward of the SM.)

I tried reading it years ago, but never got more than half way through the

I think *some* of it should be,  but there are no rules for doing that

That\'s right.  However, FFS2 includes both Waste Volume AND Waste Area
in it\'s streamlining calculations.  A hypersonic hull loses 15% in
Volume and 35% in Area to waste, and yes I know about the >1000 stere
rule. I\'m less uncomfortable with waste volume than I am with waste
area.

Well, in that case, security _does_ matter, because your insurance company

Consider the situation where a world\'s TL is high enough where it\'s
reasonable that the average person/family has a grav vehicle as their
\'family car\'.

You can immediately see that the air traffic control problems would be
roughly equivalent to everyone in today\'s US having a personal VTOL
aircraft or helicopter as their primary means of transportation.

My contention is that the only practical way for a society to allow
personal grav vehicles is if they are under automated control of a
central traffic grid, with mid-air \'traffic lanes\'.  For a government to
allow otherwise is to accept that there are crashed grav vehicles
raining down from the sky onto the buildings and pedestrians below, on a
frequent basis.  Even given a collision-avoidance system in the grav
vehicles, you must still have traffic lanes, and only a centralized
system could enforce those.

I think in my game I\'m going to have as background material that all
grav vehicles operating on civilized worlds MUST have provisions for
automated control, and unless specially-licensed (police, fire, etc.),
must always be under automated control.

This means, of course, that such automation must be standard equipment
on all grav vehicles.  It also means that given such automation, the
only skill needed to operate one under normal conditions would be \'Grav
Vehicle-0\'.  Get in, punch in your destination, and sit back.  Welcome
to the friendly skys of Traveller.

The only psionic connection I would advocate would be that psionics, like
sex for pleasure\'s sake, masturbation and homosexuality, are outlawed.

I have a picture of the Catholic Church in the Third Imperium exerting all
its old influence and power.  I especially like the image of Cardinal as
Subsector Marquis, regal in her bright red robes.

I hadn\'t though of it as a Player tool, only as background.

 I tend to agree within certain boundaries.  It will depend on the population
size and density, and the law level of the world.

IMHO, as long as the population code is less than the world size code there
would not be a demand for personal grav-vehicle ATC (exception - in urban areas,
where the density would be higher).  I would tend to make a LL roll (2D vs. the
Law Level code) to see if that planet has a specific problem in this area.  I
can also see exceptions for people who are \'certified\' grav-operators (Grav
Vehicle 1+).

On the other hand, I\'ve always believed that the autopilots of vehicles,
advanced aircraft, and starships can be operated on a \'push-button\' basis for
non-difficult manuevers.  Probably the majority of the population on any world
with a traffic net only know how to select their destination and sit back.  The
manual controls are something that are used in extreme emergencies (and by the
kids when the parents are not with \'em).

As opposed to direct control, I can see where personal vehicles have hard-
and/or soft-wired \'safeties\' that prevent them from being taken outside certain
limitations.  Vehicles must travel at at least 500 meters unless the landing
cycle is engaged, privately owned passenger vehicles may not be able to climb
over 3 Km, a commercial vehicle may not exceed 15Km, etc... - without specific
licenses and equipment.

I did run an adventure once where the protaganist (who was being chased)
bypassed the autopilot of the gravcab and took it to orbit to escape....

Just as a suggestion: there should be some point where you "cap" the
degradation.  Also, perhaps a simplified concept of a "really bad roll"
determines a Failure of a system.  For example: on a roll of snake eyes (or
is it box cars?), the unit breaks down no if\'s, and\'s, or buts.  Since this
statisticallly works out to be once in 36 die rolls, this means that the
statistical Mean time before Failure will be roughly 1 in 3 years.

 One thing that puzzles me regarding safety of ships in the imperium.
First off, maritime law (if I recall correctly) requires ships to have some
lifeboat provisions for crew and passengers.  Why don\'t traveller ships
have this requirement?  Also, safety should be a number one requirement for
ships.  Imagine the effects of a space going ship, entering into the
planet\'s atmoshpere, and losing control or losing engine thrust, or
antigravity?  Can you say MAJOR IMPACT kiddies?
  In any case, perhaps one should have a situation where the ships come in
for a landing (or docking in orbit) where shipboard inspectors come aboard
not for inspection of contraband and such, but for purposes of inspecting
equipment and testing for reliability in key areas?

>Has anyone ever developed a religion career for traveller?

   In the "Children of Earth" material I wrote for Traveller Chronicle (a
setting which covers Earth and its neighbors in the New Era) there are
several priestly orders that are a part of Gabreelism, a religion that
arises on Terra in the wake of the Colllapse.

   I dove into the water in the half pike position...

   My thinking: the story behind the whole New Era milieu had this sort of
Old Testament "wrath of God" feel to it.  Gnashing of teeth, tormenting and
lamenting, etc.  People in such times find religion *really* fast, or they
invent one.  Also, I got a bit tired of the same old "religious oligarchy
that oppresses the people" sterotype in Traveller and sci-fi RPGs in
general, and came up with a world where the religous types are the *good* guys.

   However, in my setting Gabreelism has a role more akin to the Catholic
Church c.1200, or to the role it played in the Byzantine Empire than to the
setting you describe.  There are those individuals who do things with and
without Faith sanction (and with Faith sanction but not government sanction)
that would be similar, but the basic theme isn\'t "Holy Justice" or "Holy
Vigilante Justice".

> (although I don\'t know if it was a
>conscious decision or not), I think religion can be a very powerful tool

   To be perfectly blunt, at one time game designers were scared sh*tless by
Protestant religious groups, and "concerned" parents groups here in the US
(nothing hurts sales like a picket line outside your game store).  Things
have loosened up over the last several years, but there are still subjects
that are taboo, particularly for the major players like TSR (IIRC, your
character can still drink grog or ale in a tavern until his sides split, but
there are no official rules for drunkenness in AD&D).

>There could be a connection to psionics, although I\'m not sure thats
>ideal.

   Actually in Gabreelism, there are trained psions (all new priests are
tested), and the Faith has a monopoly on training.  However, not all priests
psionic (actually the number is something like 5 percent that are).  The way
character generation is set up for Children of Earth, psions are extremely
rare, and those that do exist and have powers that can effect the game are
almost always high faith level priests.

>  I had considered a parallel "Faith" stat, that would give
>abilities similar to psionics like healing, etc., but that isn\'t ideal.

   This is something I included in Children of Earth, and it works quite
well.  \'Faith\' level is generated as an extra stat using 2D6.  The more
extreme your Faith level up or down the scale (characters with low Faith
level aren\'t necessarily agnostics or atheists--they just don\'t adhere to
the practices of the Faith as closely as others), the more likely it is that
it will have an effect on your character\'s behavior.  I\'ve also noted that
my players take one of two approaches to it: since the rules allow you the
option to select your Faith level rather than have it randomly rolled, most
of them have chosen a Faith level that more or less matches their own
beliefs with regard to God.  Most of the others have seen playing high Faith
level characters as a role-playing challenge, and have deliberately chosen
to play someone of that nature.

   I felt the need to add Faith level and some other things to give the
setting more of a feel of a interstellar state in which religion plays a
preeminent role.  Otherwise, \'God\', \'heretic\', and all those other words and
phrases you mention that should have powerful meaning are just window
dressing for the same old "let\'s get into a rocket ship and get into
trouble" scenario.

Harold

P.S.  The basic material you need to use "Children of Earth" are available
from Sword of the Knight Publications and appear in issues #10 and #11.  You
can pick up both for a total of US$8.00 (unless Kevin changed the prices on
me) plus postage.  Given how much IG charges for one sourcebook, that\'s a
pretty good deal.

I agree with Bruce on this one. While I understand how the rules currently
read, I don\'t agree. I would think that some sort of inverse log scale
would work slightly better, and keep things a bit more realistic.

While it may not be VASTLY more eficient, it should be generally more
efficient.

Please be so kind as to list the invasions of China by Japan before 1900.
Perhaps I\'m getting old, but I cannot remember _any_ succesful ones prior to
the Sino-Japanese War.

I\'m sure the saying was quoted to the Mongols, however.

This is, for the time being, a bad thing.  There is a five-county

there have been (and will continue to be, in the near term)
difficulties in printing this item, which I am told _is_ in the

Special note for gearheads: In your various designs for power

when I was listening to the radio this morning, they said that
one municipality in Qubec was using two of them as emergency

	The TNE had a technical priesthood, and perhaps you can find
	similar during the long night. But its allways posibible to
	discuss a career with a referee, as long as it does\'nt give
	more skills than usual.

	Requirement for technical priest was :

	Edu=5+, homeworld techlevel=pre industrial-, 10+ on 2d6 for commission,
	Edu 7+ and Soc A+ give a bonus for commission.

	Acolyte skills : armed martial art, recruiting, service, streetwise,
	  unarmed martial arts
	Priest skills : act/bluff, armed martial arts, computer, electronics,
	  gun combat, instruction, leadership

	Nice try (looks like MT), now what we know about (TNE+T4) :

	- 1/3 of volume is HPG - mechanic and normaly not intended for
	  8*24 hours works, but for short combat situation
	- Important but of insignificant volume is jump grid.
	- the jump drive consumes LHy and power, it does not produce power.

	So here is my try :

		power plant
		 |   |
		 |  HPG
		 |   |
	fuel ->	Jump Drive -> jump-grid

	The power plant produces power stored in the HPG, the fuel is
	feed trough the jump drive, and pulsed through the grid. The
	jumpdrive itself as a "black box" is not only an oversized
	contragraph for producing the jump bubble (a black hole
	tunnelling with more than light speed towards the next mass) 
	but also "charging" the LHy that will become dispenced to the
	bubble to avoid collapse.

Would you believe "Voyage from Yesteryear?"  ISTR that Two Faces was a near

Sigh.  And I read it in the last couple of years, too.  More recently than
the Heinlein omnibus.

  Just a tidbit I thought I\'d share with you all...

  After having run TNE twice with my gaming group, and noting the general
effects of my players on civilized areas when authority tries to chastize
them when they are committing a no no...

  Spaceport Authorities handle ships in three different manners, depending
on the classification of ship.  

  The first is Warship.  Warships are presumed to have right of way in
space regardless.  Commercial traffic will be warned or rerouted whenever a
warship\'s path will bring them anywhere near where the commercial traffic
is going.  In instances where warships require security of any kind, a
restricted "space" will be declared forcing ships to reroute.  Of course,
those ships that have yet to file a flight plan, or are in the process of
filing said flight plan, will be told to respect the no flight zone, and
reroute.

  The second category is the armed warship.  These ships are supposedly
registered.  If they are not in the registry due to the information not as
yet having been distributed (why the hell aren\'t they registered - the
x-boat express is supposed to be faster than normal ships!), then the
ship\'s captain must advise the spaceport authority that they are armed.  At
which point, safely outside of effective firing range for most weaponry at
either the planet\'s boundry or spacestation boundry, the armed ship is
expected to wait until boarded by a customs team.  Said team will insure as
best as able, that the weapons are not powered up, and perhaps a lockdown
performed to insure that the ship\'s weapons cannot be readily discharged.
Also, nuclear weapons are a no-no - and confiscated upon discovery!

  The third and final category of ships is of course, unarmed.  These
ships, aside from interacting with no flight zones, may fly straight to a
docking zone, or to a landing zone.

  Also, as an idea, perhaps ships that are armed, might be required to post
a bond, or be bondable by external agencies, in an effort to induce armed
ships not to randomly fire upon civilized areas.  Thus, a ship that has
fired in anger against authority, will be required to relinquish their
escrow account (bond)  and be hunted down as criminals etc... wherein
which, a board of inquiry will be effected against the captain of the ship,
and the guilty perpetrators executed/incarcerated.

  Just some thoughts on how to handle Player characters who think nothing
of using nuclear warheads on civilized populations!  I don\'t know about
anyone else, but if I lived on planet, within distance of weapons of mass
desctruction, I would be extremely nervous...

	sounds good, but why not using the canon (TNE) maintenance and
	wearvalue rules. Each item has a maintenance value equal to the
	numbers of hour per week. Each item has also a wearvalue (between
	1-10) and if you use that item, you have to roll more or equal
	than that number on 1d10. If failed you have a potencial breakdown,
	to avoid having a real breakdown is average mechanic, rolled by
	the one who done the maintenance. If there was no maintenance check,
	well the think will break without taskcheck. A posible breakdown
	can be delayed by 1d8 hours, if running at half power. Spending
	twice the number of hour for preventive maintenance will decrease
	the breakdown chance by 2, spending 3 times by 3 and so on. On
	overhaul will usualy half the wear value (round up).

	e.g. if a thing has a wear value of 6 and needs 4 hours maintenance,
	and you spend 12 hours before using it, you have to roll 3 or more.
	If you want to asure that it works, spend 20 hours.  If it has an
	overhaul it will have a wear value of 3, and double maintenance will
	secure steady work.

	A breakdown can be minor or major. If the mechanic test failed,
	a second roll against the wearvalue will clarify this. The
	distinction between minor and major breakdown, is that the major
	breakdown will need major repair parts, while the minor can be
	repaired with the aid of the mechanic+electronic shop. To rebuild
	a part in a M&E shop is at least difficult mechanic and takes 1d10
	hours. Roll 1d10>=wear value and increase difficulty anytime failed.
	Beyond imposible means that you have to buy a new part. Battle damage
	is also classified in minor and major damage (less or more than 20
	briliant lances points) and handled by the same repair rules.

	All 10 real breakdowns the wear value will increase by one, an item
	with a wear value of 10, is worn out. Under normal use each part will
	increase wear by 1 every 10 years.

Because it was one of a kajillion things we never got the time to mention. 

They probably _do_ have requirements, but since no formal design ever included
lifeboats, the law probably specifies a certain ratio of rescue balls to
occupants for vessels under <mumble-mumble> tons. 

Larger passenger vessels have lifeboats in at least one canon source (see
Marooned/Marooned Alone*).

Well, one would have to avoid the controversy of any "endorsement" of a
religion. Also of mistakenly (or intentionaly) mocking the precepts of a
contemporary religion.       
    The concept would fit w/ the medieval imagery and i wouldn\'t mind seeing a
cardinal in HIS red robes.   I\'m not that hard assed about such matters,and
i\'m not interested in a theological debate on the tml, but being a Catholic
Christian, I wouldn\'t like any of the Clergy being female (much less any of
the Cardinals or the Pope).  Ditto goes for marriage.  Anyone who wishes to
debate these issues (or any others) ; ) is more than welcome to take it into
private email w/ me.  
    These are the problems (amongst others) one will run into with portraying
any contemporary religion in anything as fickle as a rpg.

This is called a modular vehicle.  "A vehicle designed to have large,
easily replaceable chunks will have double the structure cost and
mass. In addition each module will suffer a 10% volume penalty and
cost 50% more than normal.  That is the total volume of the
components is increased by 10%, and their total cost is increased
by 50%.  These disadvantages are offset by the ability to replace
modules in modules in short order (25% of the equivalent "repair"
time) to meet a given need." (CSC p 55)

Even with the assumption that starports are constructed and
maintained by the host system/world, design and layout will
still follow (more or less) a given format.

Another thought I had is that a starport upgrade may not be
a simple job;  it might mean the construction of a brand new
starport with extended facilities (for example, any new 
airport or airport wing is a new building).

Ok, on to the basic format.  With a little guidance from a
couple of friends, here\'s what I\'ve come up with:

Starports are planetary or orbital installations built for the support of 
people and machinery in space.  Starports may be used for individual, 
corporate, military or government purpose.  This document gives an abstract 
of the minimal facility requirements for each starport class.

Assumptions

1. Established systems separate military starports from commercial starports.

2. At higher TL, satellites (remote sensors) allow the traffic control tower 
   to be nestled in the safest part of the starport\'s interior.

The Abstract Starport Template

All starports follow a similar layout, with zones interconnected according to 
the following diagram:

		Admin	Insystem
                   |      /
                   |     /
Dock----Concourse----Maintenance
		   |
		   |
		Shipping

A starport is divided into these separate zones:

Dock: where spaceship and starship services are provided.
Concourse: the public section of the starport.
Administration: where starport offices and traffic control are located.
Shipping: where all freight is managed, and corporate offices are located.
Insystem: for all insystem-related passage.
Maintenance: where life support and starport repair facilities are located.

And now for a breakdown of these zones:

Dock

The dock  holds docking facilities, drydock (construction), repair and 
overhaul facilities, and fuelling stations.

		Drydock		Fuel
		       \\	|
			\\	|
		Overhaul----Port----> to Concourse
		       /

Dock Subzones

What follows is a prioritized list of subzones for this zone.  After each 
subzone name is a list of starports where that subzone is guaranteed to exist.

Port: ABCDFG
Fuel: ABCDFG
Repair: ABCF
Overhaul: AB
Drydock: AB

Concourse

The concourse is equivalent to airport terminal wings.

		  Medic		Ticketing

subzone name is a list of starports where that subzone is guaranteed to exist.

Security: ABCDF
Lobby: ABCF
Ticketing: ABC
Medic: ABCF
Shops: ABCDF
Banks/Hotels: ABCDF

Administration

The administrative zone is the brain center of the starport.  Offices and 
traffic control are located here.

Shipping

Shipping contains all cargo services, as well as corporate offices which are 
interested in doing business in the subsector, and keeping an eye on cargo 
shipments through this starport.

Not in 2nd edition, but 1st edition had the Intoxitaion Table in the DMG.
As your intoxitation level increased, several stats went down (DEX and INT
I think, although it may have been WIS), while something else went up
(moral I think - might have been CON or STR though). It also had things
like recovery time, and possibly various after effects. I\'m not really sure
that the whole thing warrented a table (or the small section discussing the
table), but given the tendancy for PCs to go drinking it could have some
use =).

One of the things that will be fixed in version 1.7 - the economics

tankage in cubic meters rather than displacement tons to calculate fuel
cost - thus, fuel cost was WAY too big. Ack ack ack ack.

Thanks for your help, and I hope everyone using the spreadsheet enjoy

I don\'t know (or care) if it\'s cannon, but at least one DGP source has an
excellent lifeboat in it.  Sorry, that stuff is currently impossible to get
to so don\'t ask me which it was.  One of the magazines I think.

  Ok, on with the next question.  What constitutes a spaceport in
Traveller.  Oh, I don\'t mean that class A starports can manufacture jump
drives and so forth.  What I mean, is how difficult is it to upgrade from
one starport to another?

  The reason I ask, is for those of us who want to look at "historical"
forces and try to decide what starports are going to come into being years
down the road.

  If I may, I would like to point out TWILGHT\'S PEAK adventure #3.  It it,
it discusses how the MagnetoDynamics corporation was able to create a
class A starport.  What I am basically looking at, from this point of
view, is what are the minimum requirements to go from what would appear to
be an X or D class starport, and transform it into an A starport.  How
much to build the factories that build jump drives, how much to build the
support infrastructure that permits cargoes to be collected quickly and
efficiently, how much for the repair shops, the ship fabrication shops,
the shipyards themselves, etc...

  As you can see, this seems to be an area that has been neglected in the
long run, unless this has been addressed prior to my resumption of this
mailing list <grin>.

No arguments from me.  However, have you considered how the Catholic Church
has changed in the 1000 years?  Or how about how many offshoots have cropped
up in the same period.  \'Nuff said.

For T4, the religious types question starting this thread, they could be a
subset of many of the already given CharGen sets.  For example, members of
knightly orders could come from Army, Navy or Marines.  Priestly types could
come from any of those as retired (or even active) Chaplains or Scouts (you
know missionaries would need much the same skills) or Agents (for religious
intriguers) or Rogues (well, we have probably all know a roguish clergist or
two) or Scholars (a real natural for the more bookish types).  Heirachical
types (bishops, cardinals, et al.) could be generated using Nobles.

  That\'s the approach that I would use. My point is that telling
the players that it\'s solely the J-components that are at issue
will simply encourage them to do the math to prove that every NPC
ship-owner in the universe is either stupid or already doing the
J-drive replacement (or re-build, etc.) at a pre-determined age
as cash-flow or financing allows.

In response to Zane\'s comment in response to Loren Wiseman\'s to Hal\'s
<grin>...

  I have in my hands a copy of THE BEST OF JTAS #2, page 34 of the SHIP\'S
LOCKER area...

LIFEBOATS: 20 tons, TL8 14 MCR, holding 3 conscious passengers and 20
frozen passengers.  Pilot of the craft needs to roll an 8+ with bonuses
for ship\'s boat skill.  In the same "section" of the ship\'s locker, are
entries for Rescue Ball as well as Hostile Environment kit.

  All in all, If Marc Miller is willing to reprint all of the old Classic
Traveller stuff - you people should jump on it.  If he\'s selling photocopy
"reprints" of the old traveller JTAS - JUMP ON IT immediately!
Personally, it is my sad regret that I didn\'t keep both the floorplans of
the FASA series from ADVENTURE CLASS SHIPS #1 and #2.  Also, I threw out a
copy of AZANTI HIGH LIGHTNING <sob>.  If those are ever re-released,
people, don\'t walk, run to get them.

  This is my not so cute way of saying "put these on the CD ROM, willya?"

  I actually meant to imply replacing a 15 or 20 year old drive, when
such proved to be uneconomic by the maintenance rules that started
this thread. By HG, a new J-2 of the same make would cost 12 MCr per
100 Dt, while at TL 11-12 the powerplant alone costs MCr 18 per 100 Dt.
I don\'t see that podded drives would necessarily matter; it becomes a
ref issue as to whether certifying the newly clipped on drive as perfect
would be faster. After all, the local contractor for Valu-Jump might be
Gator-Aid Enterprises :)

>You *could* design ships where the J-Drive was in a sort of "pod" that
....
>*plus* the capital costs of keeping drive pods around so that they\'ll
>be available for swapping.

  Both the Freight Tractor and Express Packet from GW\'s "IISS Ship Files"
use podding; the latter swaps empty for full fuel tanks while dropping off
the mail-bags - this presumes an ability/willingness to make at least some
jumps with only the checking that can be done while maneuvring into the
world and out. The FT simply functions as a flatbed tractor/trailer, having
a pre-loaded cargo box clipped into place before leaving. Theoretically, in
most systems this would take place at a station or rendezvous point just
inside the 100 diam. limit, one assumes.

  These designs don\'t use drive podding as such; they use payload podding,
and as such aren\'t really part of the "maintenance" issue, but are directly
related to the point of maintenance, which is minimizing turnaround times
to maximize economic returns.

I think that there needs to be more then just this somewhat simple view of it.
Starports, as far as I can figure, are very much like old seaports and seaport
towns.  A seaport couldn\'t just be built _anywhere_ on a coast, certain
specific things had to be in place already in order to build an area up to
being a seaport.  In addition, a number of support industries had to exist, or
be able to exist as well.

You would have needed in, say, the 18th and 19th centuries, a fresh water
supply, stable land (that is, not swampy land [yes, there were a couple of
exceptions, but these were not the rule]), you needed a reason for ships to be
in the area at all (trade routes, stuff like that), you needed a ready supply
of lumber, preferably cheap lumber (the British encouraged the early American
colonies to build ships since Britain didn\'t have the needed supplies after
years and years of ship-building, and it was cheaper to ship a ship back then
raw wood).  Although not necessary, a defensible position was highly desirable
(small bays and the like were commonly chosen, and fortifications could be
built on high rocks and such).

The same types of things would go for a class A starport as well.  Somebody
would have to build and maintain the shipyards in the first place (I can
imagine that j-drive factories would be extremely expensive to build and
maintain), and it would have to show a profit.  The maintenance would be the
killer, not the building costs...  Which is why class A starports aren\'t all
over the galaxy.

You\'re correct, but, I don\'t suspect this has anything to do with the
Protestant religious groups and their overbearing attitude towards RPGs (and
having been through a Catholic grade school and high school I can say it
wasn\'t only the protestant types, and I have a really nice anti-roleplaying
pamphlet from an order of Catholic nuns that would be funny if it didn\'t cause
the loss of a couple role-players due to irate parents as a kid).  I would
tend to think that anyone who needs rules for drinking in AD&D is _way_ too
much into roll-playing as opposed to role-playing.  I\'m trying to think of
exactly how much a specific rule for drinking would help any game I\'ve ever
run or been in...  and it wouldn\'t.

Furthermore, drinking is very hard to model as far as rules go anyway.  Do you
base it on constitution or body weight?  Then, even if you do model it on the
real world, then you run into problems:  what is the alcohol tolerance of a 35
year old fighter from the northern wastes?  How about the alcohol tolerance of
a 350 year old grey elf?  Or a stubby, dour dwarf?

It would be pages and pages of rules that would most likely be complicated,
and not really all that needed, when role-playing it makes it simpler anyway.

That\'s why Joe and I started working of RPSCS last year.  We wanted to get
the PC\'s and their skills involved in the action. 

I\'d like any combat system in a roleplaying game to involve roleplaying for
all the participants.  For squadron/fleet actions that aren\'t going to be
roleplayed out use a wargame, but even for big actions that involve
roleplaying we need a system that focuses more on the roleplaying and less
on the wargaming.

Hum, seems I\'ve said *that* before..that\'s how RPSCS got started. ;-D

I posted this to the ISBA list awhile back:

Okay here\'s my take on what safety equipment the Bureau Of Starships Safety,
Health, and Transit Standards would require a starship to carry as a minimum.

1) Vacc suits: 3 per airlock (located in the airlock), 2 per driveroom
(located in the driveroom). Note that these are not \'normal\' vacc suits,
rather these are specifically designed to be used by most humaniod races
within the Imperium. This results in them being somewhat bulky and
uncomfortable (-2 on all tasks). Most crew refer to them as "Baggies" and
will only use them in emergencies.

2) Rescue Balls: 2 per stateroom (located in the stateroom), 1 per low berth
(located with the low berth), 1 per acceleration couch (located underneigth
the couch), 1 per workstation (located at the station); plus others totalling
the maximum possible crew and passenger compliment (excluding low passengers)
located at easily accessable points throughout the vessel.

3) Imperial Standard Individual Survial Kits: 1 per airlock (located on the
hull exterior at the airlock), 1 per driveroom (located in the driveroom),
1 other (located on or by the bridge or pilot\'s workstation). Note that these
are in sealed compartments, and accessing them will trip audiable (very)
alarms throughout the vessel.

4) Paramedic kits: 1 per airlock (located at the airlock), 1 per 10 passengers
or crew (located at easily accessable points throughout the vessel), 1 per
driveroom (located in the driveroom), 1 per 10 low berths (located by the low
berths, 1 other (located at or by the bridge or pilot\'s workstation).

5) Hull patches: 1 per displacement ton (located in easily accessable points
near the exterior hull throughout the vessel). Note, as with the Survival
kits, these items are alarmed (you want to know if the hulls been breached!).

6) Emergency beacon: 1 (located at an easily accessable central point).

7) Handheld illumination devices: 1 per 2 passengers or crew (located at
easily accessable points throughout the vessel).

8) Electronic tools: 1 set per driveroom (located in the driveroom).

9) Mechanical tools: 1 set per airlock (located in the airlock), 1 set per
dirveroom (located in the driveroom)

10) Metalworking tools: 1 set (located in the main driveroom). If the vessel
has more than 4 driverooms then there must be 1 set per driveroom (located in
the driveroom).

11) Atmosphere testers: 1 per airlock (located in the airlock).

12) Radiation counters: 1 per airlock (located in the airlock), 1 per
driveroom (located in the driveroom).

NOTES: Since most accidents requiring an "abandon ship" will happen within
100 planetary diameters (and there is virtually no chance of survival
regardless of equipment anywhere else) no vacc suits are provided for
passengers. Rescue balls are provided instead, unlike vacc suits these can be
used by anyone regardless of training (vacc suits require at least basic
familiarisation).

Also, these are minimum standards only. Other more stringent standards will
apply in some cases (specific types of vessels, vessels engaged in specific
activities, and vessels in specific regions). Also, prudent captians will
ensure that their vessels are better equiped.

What makes you think that an alien being has DNA for information storage?
Okay, I admit that all the major races are not included in xenobiology (in
TNE), but still there are organisms on Earth which use RNA, not DNA, for
saving the genetic material. 

Other point : DNA is such a complex molecule that it is very impossible
for it to occur spontaneously, ergo there must have been some simplex
replicators before DNA. So I wouldn\'t think that an alien organism would
have DNA, even with different transkriptase.

Other ships - ones that fail the check - simply aren\'t allowed to enter the
highport dock, but are placed in \'safe\' parking orbits and made an offer of
renting a shuttle to gain access to the port. This carries a fine levied as
punishment for bringing an unsafe ship into orbital space. 

Anal-retentive? Oh yeah. But their line is, "If you want to come here and
trade for our excellent high-tech goods, you\'d better come in with a decent
ship. If you expect to breeze in in any old junkheap and endanger our
citizens, expect to pay for the privilige."

They don\'t have many accidents....

This is an extreme case (Strashnaa is known now as \'safeworld\' to my
players, one of whom was arrested for the (in rare cases, capital) crime of
Endangering The Public Safety, and also Slandering The Dictator\'s Strenuous
Efforts To Ensure The Saftey Of The General Public.)

But I can see a similar system being used elsewhere, too. Who wants a
thousand tons of starship falling out of the sky on their head because the
captain\'s too cheap to maintain his CG lifters?

I have some other thoughts about safety inspections, but thye\'re going in
Edge of Empire so I\'ll not mention them here....

Anyway, if a whole tv series can be made around the incorrectly assumed
inflexion of a single statement, couldn\'t something similar be done in a
Traveller scenario? Often two words - or names - sound similar but mean
different things. There are two systems in the Spinward Marches that have
similar sounding names, and actually border each other. They are Dinom and

You see, this is only ahint of the potential troubles I was hinting at in my
orignial post.  As an ex-catholic, vehemently \'devout\' aethiest, but nonetheless
appreciative of the Catholic culutre and its ability to preserve, if not accept
and incorporate knowledge. I wouldn\'t accept such a religion in my campaign that
excluded women without a damn good reason.  Not being able to coneceive of such a
reason, you guessed it, equal opportunity.

Although I certainly don\'t want to get into an argument about \'real-world\'
religion with anyone on the list [trust me, even if you\'re agnostic, you would
come to loathe me, and vice versa, - I should probably call myself militant
fundamentalist aethiest to give you an idea of the strength of my non-beliefs], I
do wonder how you would defend the idea of a male-only clergy for the
gender-neutral Traveller setting.  Not flame trollig here, I sincerely welcome any
good reasons to do something such as you suggest.  However, since I haven\'t met a
woman who\'s even heard of Traveller since  Mini-Con in Joplin, Missouri, USA,
around 1977-78 (which was my introduction to the little black books). gender
discriminatinon hasn\'t really been an issue for me or my players.  Besides, if
there are girls around, the last thing we were going to do was play Traveller.
Making complete asses of ourselves was much more of a priority.

Rambling too much.

Mr. Flores\' ideas mirror my own ultimate ideas.  As much as I would like to have
a separate ranks table with Acolyte, Deacon, Chaplain, Priest, Monsignor,
Cardinal, Pope, it doesn\'t seem necessary since a galactic shurch would have
nearly as many divisions as the government, when it wasn\'t the government.  And
the necessary range of capabilities and practices should vary.  Seems I\'d be
better off just detailing such an organizastion and allow players characters to
shift from career table to career table while in the clergy to reflect time
spent in different capacities: missionary, battle-chaplain, crusader, etc.

There\'s Champa starport issue of JTAS with lots of background on starports
complete with a map. There was an excellent article in an old White Dwarf
about starports with maps of starports from E to A that I\'m currently using
as a template for my own maps. The aerticle argued for startown being
inside the extrality fence and thus Imperial property and with Imperial law
ruling.

I included "liferafts" in the Coronation.  3dtons, an emergency lowberth,
radio beacon, covered with solar panels, HEPLaR engine with just enough
fuel to kick the raft clear of the disabled ship, then stop it so the raft
is falling along side the wreck.  Makes you easier to find.

The Big C has 500 of these, which will take 2000 of the crew off.  The
remainder have to either hope that the shuttles are still operational, or
risk a rescue ball.

Not so fast!  Yes he unmasked himself, but when he returned to London, the

I was a volunteer at the local PBS station the last time they ran The
Prisoner.  KTEH got a local TV columnist who was also a fan to do
introductions and closers for each episode.  Scott whatshisname was a
blast, and for "The Girl Who Was Death" we shot in a park where the
temperture had to be over 100F.  Scott, in his Leo McKern #2 outfit,
managed to put off heatstroke long enough to tape both sections.. in rhyme.

One of the greatest Murphy\'s Rules ever was that drinking table.  An

What I meant is that the complex DNA (and also the RNA) consists of
nucleic acids which ARE simple molecules and have been found to be one of
the first molecules that existed on earth and in space. So the probability
is high that they exist on other planets, and together with the ribose
and desoxyribose with phosphate links they could (not must!) evolve there,
too. This does not say that an other way of storing information in
lifeforms is impossible, but the same principle that worked on earth could
do so on an other world! But I won\'t imagine how many different ways there
also exist ... those would be really exotic lifeforms.

The Traveller Aliens, at some exotic they are still humanoid (well, most
of them, if we bend the K\'kree and Droyne a little) what means here
walking upright, talking, eating and using weapons. So I would propose
their biochemistry is not that far away from ours or earth fauna. Only to
ease things for a pseudo-scientific description on that.

The basics of (our) life are: water, proteines, carbohydrates, fat and
nucleic acids along with some special molecules for coenzymes. Although
they can be complex, they consist all of little, simple molecules. 

If you want to build a really exotic alien, I believe, you must go far
from chemistry as the periodic system until now only knows 109 elements,
of which the carbon atom is unique.

(The organic chemistry knows some 4.000.000 compounds built with carbon,
against ca. 100.000 anorganics for the whole rest. See the difference.)

A diesel-electric locomotive is largely generator! 

And for that matter, back in the 60s after the Great Blackout, more
than one port city got their power back by "boostrapping" from the
powerplant on a ship in the harbor. 

You see, modern powerplants need a certain minimum amount of power
*before* you can turn them on. Power to operate the controls, the fuel
transport mechanism, etc.

Ok, for a starport, you need the following:

1. a large, relatively flat area that is either rock, hard packed
   ground, or that can easily be stabilized.
2. a location where typical landing & takeoff patterns *won\'t* run
   ships over anything too important (in case something goes wrong).
3. Decent weather. You *don;t* put the port someplace that has gale
   force winds most of the time. Rain is ok, as is reasonable amounts
   of snow.
4. Water supply, both for fuel and for people. Likewise, easy method of
   handling sewage and trash.
5. Easily accessible via local transport grid (not a problem at higher
   tech levels, but very important at lower ones).

Other requirements depend on the type of port, and on whether things
like construction/repair can be handled with local tech or require
imported tech.

But given the 5 things above, you can *build* anything else the port
needs, or bring it in via local transport.

It\'s instructive to consider ports on world with tech levels below 9,
it makes for some interesting possibilities.

There should also be a "ground hug" mode, where the vehicle can follow
the "streets" at an altitude dictated by local rules. It might be 3
meters (so you can\'t hit pedestrians walking down the "street"), or it
might as much as 20 meters (to avoid hitting the trees they plant in
the "streets".

I say "streets" because they are more likely to resemble a greenway.
Grass, and maybe some graveled/paved paths for joggers and bicycles.

In "ground hug" mode you cruise along at a fairly low speed, far enough
overhead to not run into things, but low enough to enjoy the scenery.
You might even spot a nice open air restaurant and tell the car to land
there for lunch.

Ground hug mode is favored for sightseeing, and for semiprivate talks.
In many areas, the "lovers lane" is an area with a 2-3m limit for
ground hug. That\'s deliberate so that if a date gets fed up with their
partner, they can just hop out and walk home (It\'s considered *way* out
of line to try "pressing" things by making out at higher altitudes).
Though "forcing" a door open in ground hug mode *will* automatically
drop the vehicle to 1-2m for safety.

Only in ground hug mode are you allowed to fly with the windows open or
the "top down". That\'s to prevent people from throwing things out the
windows and "bombing" the people below. (Just like the wire fences on
freeway overpasses)

Lucky for him it was air tight, rather than just using a system to
pressurize outside air. :-)

Well, *your* line of reasoning below is rather erroneus.

No, he *is* making a local call. The *ISP* is hooked to a T-1 or T-3
line, and is paying for the use of it. 

As an analogy, if you call a local branch of a company and to answer
your question, they patch you thru their corporate phone network to
someone in Hong Kong, *they* are paying for the call to Hong Kong, not
you. And while the cost of that call *is* going to be reflected in the
cost of their services to you, I think you\'d be *justly* upset if the
phone company wanted to charge extra because you were getting
information that hadn\'t originated locally, even though you had made a
local call.

And in the case of ISPs the analogy doesn\'t work that well anyway. If I
see traffic that originated in Hong Kong, it\'s *not* because my ISP
calls Hong Kong. 

RAINnet hooks up to an academic network (I forget the name) and that
hooks up to ione of the nets that comprise the "backbone". I\'m not sure
if our T-1 hooks into the academioc network here in portland, or if it
does so in Seattle. Either way, the T-1 is paid for, and the rate does
*not* depend on usage. All the telco does is provide and maintain the
"wire" between the two sites. This costs them the same regardless of
the traffic on it. In fact, as I recall, the charges for a T-1 are
generally based on *mileage* BECAUSE it\'s a dedicated link.

The same goes for the "backbone" and the links to it. They are also
dedicated lines. Heck, in the case of the backbone, the lines are often
as not *owned* by the network, not by a phone company!

So the *only* place the local phone system contacts or is affected by
the Internet is the *local* calls made to connect to the ISP.

BTW, the long distance argument is specious anyway. You see, back
before BBS systems started dropping like flies, the phone companies
were trying to do the same thing to them. And they *were* purely local
traffic, except for things like Fidonet mail/echoes which were carried
at regular long distance raters, over regular phone lines, usually late
at night.

The whole thing is based on two factors:

1. The phone companies decided that residential data calls weren\'t any
   reason to update their traffic models.
2. Now that their interoffice trunkage and some portions of the phone
   switches ned to be expanded to handle more simultaneous calls, due
   to #1, they don\'t want to pay for *their* mistake.

Let me amplify that last point. If they\'d updated their models back in
the early 80s, they\'d have been budgeting for the extra equipment
needed. Now they *have* to do something, they haven\'t budgetted for it,
and they\'ve done too much cost cutting "to improve their ability to
compete", so they can\'t *afford* to keep service at reasonable levels,
so they are trying to blame someone else.

US West and several other RBOCs are in trouble with state utilitity
commissions because they can\'t install lines in a reasonable amount of
time, they can\'t repair lines in a reasonable amount of time, and they
can\'t keep the lines that are installed working. And yet they\'ve spent
the last several years laying off service techs!

Add in things like the fact that ISDN was first tested in the early
80s, yet most phone companies couldn\'t seem to market it until a few
years ago. 

The phone companies haven\'t got a *clue* about what their customers
want or how to provide it. They persist in trying to go on as if things
haven\'t changed. But things *have* changed. And they are going to have
to change.

PBS stations can occasionally be talked into running the series.
There\'s a "special" version they get that has some added "narration" in
the form of some academic types discussing the episode after it
finishes. And they are actually worth listening to!

Because lifeboats (other than the ship\'s boats) really aren\'t
*practical* in space. If you are close enough to a planet with an
atmosphere, the reentry pod idea is of some use. 

If the ship is orbiting a planet, it\'s not going to "sink". So you can
stayt with the ship. Ditto if it\'s heading for the jump point or
heading in from the jump point. Traffic regs (and sensible procedure!)
are such that you *don\'t* put your ship in a trajectory that\'ll
intersect the planet\'s surface (or even atmosphere) until you are ready
to land. 

If the ship is landing on a planet, or taking off, the situation is
much like that in an airliner. If something goes wrong, either they can
land it you can "walk" away" or they\'ll crash, and you aren\'t likely to
be in good shape anyway.

What the shop *will* have are "rescue balls" (basicly a fabric and
plastic ball with air supply that you crawl into and zip closed),
emergency suits (for those with Vacc-suit 0 and better), and lots of
emergency life support kits.

So the passengers with vaccsuit skill get into the emergency suits (or
their own suit if it is handy) and the rest get into rescue balls. No
doubt passengers with vacc-suit skill will have their accomodations
placed so as to keep a reasonable ratio of suited to "balled"
passengers. 

Then the crew and trained passengers will help move the rest of the
passengers into areas that still hold air (or have been patched to do
so) and set up the life support kits to supply air until rescue.

The reason ships need lifeboats is because they *sink*. :-)

Which is why you won\'t be *allowed* to assume an "impact" trajectory
exceptas part of a landing manuever. And then, your assigned course may
well be chosen so that right up until the last few minutes, your impact
point if you lost control would be relatively harmless.

It may help to recall the situation that is not at *all* uncommon near
the US coast. 

	"US Coast Guard. Please heave to for a safety inspection"

This over a loud hailer *and* the radio, while they have a .50 cal
pointed at you (or a 3-5 inch gun if you are a freighter).

The gun is because sometimes the ship turns out to be a drug runner...

One not so minor detail. since they will be growing in 3d, it may not
be that *easy* to remove the "old" sections, since they\'ll tend to be
in the *middle* surrounded by stuff.

Instead, they\'d becomre the "low rent district". Both because of age and
because it takes longer to get to them from the docking areas. 

Eventually, they\'d just get sealed off. And you\'d wind up with
something like Babylon 5\'s "downbelow". People living in module with
life support that\'s patched together and doesn\'t work all that well,
and may stealing power to keep it working. 

Shrinkage will happen if there\'s a reason to strip the newer modules
off the *outside* of the station. 

Inner areas will sometimes get redone either after an accident that
guts a bunch of compartments, or when someone decides to gut them to
put in something. So you could be led thru a maze of old passageways
some scarred by explosions or fire, and then go thru a battered hatch
to find yourself in a state of the art facility that someone decided to
"hide" in there. Crooks, shady operators, and intelligence types will
all be fond of this dodge.

In Norton\'s "Uncharted Stars" there\'s a station run by the Guild
(Thieves Guild gone techno). It\'s based on a core module that must be
multiple thousands of years old with patches and repairs made over the
millenia by whoever was occupying it at the time. And it\'s surrounded
by a virtual graveyard of old hulks. Some abandoned as not worth
fixing, others dumped by pirates as not worth salvaging after they\'d
stripped the cargo.  It\'s been "lost" and "rediscovered" many times. 

I can see something like that in some area where the various imperiums
and pocket empires have soread and then fallen back.

Not the Catholic Church, surely

Whilst possible for a Church of England Archbishop or Chief Rabbi (as
occurs in UK)
and for other religions, I thought that the Catholic Church had a specific
rule against priests holding positions of secular power.

Thus the church wasn\'t a calling for the first son of a family.

But the *brother* of the Marquis being a Cardinal...

Well, I think automated control over cities is likely. Out in the
countryside (if any) and over large private tracts manual control would
work. 

I\'ll also note that at starports, manual control *is* allowed, but
there are defined "lanes" and there\'s a rigidly enforced max altitude.
If you use the "berms around the pad" design I described a year or two
back, the max altitude is about the same as the berm height. That way
you *can\'t* fly over a ship that\'s getting ready for a vertical
takeoff. And of course, flying over the "runways" (for horizontal
landing or takeoff craft) is *not* allowed without tower clearance. 

Since violating the rules at a port can result in losing you
*spacecraft* pilot\'s license, folks don\'t mess up much. :-)

Following disposable contact lenses, we now get disposable jump drives?

Sign up with Stickemin and Swapem, LIC and you can exchange that jump
module at any class A starport. No more need for that irritating, expensive
maintenance of your jump drive, just use it, and swap it. And for a little
extra take our maintenance plus contract, where we take over the

vacuum suits, to rescue bubbles. A rescue bubble... ...contains enough air
to sustain one individual for one to two hours."

"Various views exist among starship designers as to the need for lifeboats
on a space vessel. They take up valuable space that could be devoted to
improving on board conditions. Many do not include them, because (they
argue) where are the fleeing survivors going to go? Likely as not, they
won\'t be anywhere near an uninhabited world. So what good does a lifeboat
do them? Other designers insist that even a miniscule chance to escape to
safety os better than no chance at all."

White Dwarf had a nice design for a 20dt life boat (the Reliant Class).
Kenneth Bearden has posted some useful ships locker emergency stuff in the
past.

THE SITUATION INSYSTEM
	A star system is composed of a primary star and one or more stellar
companions. Orbiting these stars are a variety of planets, planetoid belts,
and gas giants. Orbiting planets and gas giants are a variety of satellites.
But the focus is one world... the mainworld... which is the overall best
planet or satellite in the system.
	The mainworld has a starport which, for all practical purposes, is the
destination of interstellar traffic entering the system. Starports vary in
their capabilities and facilities, depending on the details of the world
itself.

CLASSIFICATION OF STARPORTS
	Starports are classified by their location and by their capabilities.

Location
	A starport may be located on a world surface, or it may be in orbit above the
world. 
	Down. A starport may be located on a world surface. If so, the starport is
most frequently referred to by the world name followed by the word Down. Thus,
Sylea Down is the main world surface starport for the world of Sylea. 
	Why a surface port? Landing close to the market is convenient for all
concerned. If the environment is at all tolerable, then life support and labor
costs are minimized.
	Highport. A starport may be located in orbit above a world. If so, it is most
frequently referred to by the world name followed by Highport. Thus, Sylea
Highport is the main orbital starport for Sylea. A highport maintains
scheduled links by shuttle with the world surface (if there is no surface
starport, then with an air transport hub).
	Why a highport? Many very large ships never land on a world surface; the
cargo they carry is off-loaded in orbit and shuttled down. Some worlds are
naturally inhospitable (bad surface weather, a water world, fluid oceans, or
perhaps government type D or E) and ship owners prefer not to risk their
equipment venturing down to the surface.
	Class A and B starports for worlds with Atmosphere 2+ generally have a
Highport. Class A, B, or C starports at worlds with Atmosphere B+, or
Hydrographics A, or Government D or E can b expected to have a Highport.
	Spaceports. There is typically one major starport in a star system. Other
facilities, especially those on smaller, less important worlds in a system,
are called spaceports. They are established primarily to foster in-system
travel.
	Good spaceports are often established in support of farming projects, mining
projects, or small colonies.

Starport Type
	Starport type is based on a simple letter classification system (ranging from
A to E) which details their basic facilities.
	A. Excellent quality facility with refined and unrefined fuel available on
site. Facilities include capability to perform annual overhaul and new
starship construction (TNAS certified designs). A naval base may be present. A
scout base is usually not present. A surface installation is present. A
highport may be present (generally if the world atmosphere is 2+).
	B. Good quality starport with refined and unrefined fuel available on site.
Facilities include capability to perform annual overhaul and new spacecraft
construction (TNAS certified designs). A naval base may be present. A scout
base may be present. A surface installation is present. A highport may be
present (generally if the world atmosphere is 2+).
	C. Routine quality starport with unrefined fuel available on site. Facilities
include some capability for repair (primarily replacement of TNAS-certified
parts). A naval base is usually not present. A scout base may be present. A
surface installation is present. A highport is usually not present.
	D. Poor quality starport with unrefined fuel available on site or close by.
It has no repair or construction facilities. A naval base is not present. A
scout base may be present. A surface installation is present. A highport is
not present.
	E. Frontier starport. With no facilities, the installation is little more
than a flat expanse of bedrock and a sign. This designation effectively means
there is no starport, but there have been previous landings and that location
is indictaed in records.
	Y. No spaceport or starport. The world has no indigenous space access
capability. 

Spaceports
	Worlds other than the mainworld in a system may also have spaceports. 
	F. Routine quality spaceport with unrefined fuel available on site and minor
repair facilities. A system defense field may be present. A military base may
be present. A surface installation is present. There is no highport. This
designation is a poor cousin to starport type B.

	Beacons. In some cases, a beacon for a long-established frontier starport may
no longer be operational.
	Type Y. Indicates the world has no designated starport or spaceport.
	Class A and B starports for worlds with Atmosphere 2+ generally have a
Highport. Class A, B, or C starports at worlds with Atmosphere B+, or
Hydrographics A, or Government D or E can b expected to have a Highport.

 	G. Poor quality installation with unrefined fuel available nearby. No repair
facilities are available. A system defense field may be present. A military
base may be present. A surface installation is present. There is no highport.
This designation is a poor cousin to starport type C. 
	H. Primitive quality installation with no facilities beyond a beacon
identifying the location. Unrefined fuel may be available nearby. This is a
surface installation; there is no highport. A system defense field may be
present. A military base may be present. This designation is a poor cousin to
starport type D.
	Y. No spaceport or starport. The world has no indigenous space access
capability. 

THE ELEMENTS OF THE STARPORT
	A starport at its simplest is a bare spot of bedrock capable of supporting a
ship which wants to land. The remaining elements of a starport are added later
to support and maintain the traffic that passes through the port.

The Basic Elements
	Each starport is characterized by a few basic elements. Without them, the
starport is not really a starport.
	The Beacon. The location of the starport is broadcast throughout the system
from a central beacon. At its simplest, the beacon puts out a continuous tone
which allows ships to home on its position. In more complex systems, the
beacon provides range and position information for ships in the system,
traffic control information on sister frequencies.
	The Landing Pad. Starships approach from beyond the atmosphere. When
starships set down, most make use of their lifters in order to make a smooth,
relatively slow approach along designated approach corridors. To deal with
ships  with disabled lifters, or for ships which use lifting surfaces, the
landing pad includes long, broad runways.
	For highports, this a designated holding area.
	Traffic Control Facility. Space traffic controllers provide basic information
to ships within the system, vectoring them safely in their approaches or
departures. The traffic control facilities are located at the starport. In
some systems, an auxiliary control facility is located in an outer orbit. 

The Terminal
	The starport terminal houses the basic services for passengers and freight.
	The Concourse. Passenger services are handled at the concourse. Ticketing,
baggage check, and final boarding all take place at this facility.
	Freight Docks. Freight (materials carried by ships for a fee) is loaded and
unloaded at the freight docks. Speculative cargoes are held until sold at the
exchange.
	Customs and Immigration. Applicable laws concerning the people and goods
moving to the world are enforced by Customs and Immigration.
	The Exchange. Speculative cargo is bought and sold at the Exchange. A variety
of brokers handle the transactions and make the process 
	Accommodations. Passengers passing through the starport can stay overnight at
the starport hotel, buy meals at a variety of restaurants, purchase basic
goods and souvenirs at the shops, and pass time at theaters or entertainment
complexes. The level of accommodation available varies widely.
	Data Terminals. Information is available about the world, its products and
services, and recreation at a variety of data terminals. On some worlds, the
data terminal may be a computer; on others, they may be staff people with
prodigious memories; on yet others, they may be librarians).
	Message Center. Access to communications, including physical mail, electronic
mail, telephone, and video is generally available at the message center.
	Emergency Medical. Suitable facilities are provided for emergency medical
treatment. The medical staff has the training and experience to deal with a
wide variety of medical emergencies.

Peripheral Facilities
	Situated around the edges of the starport are a variety of associated
activities and facilities.
	Starport Defense Establishment (SDE). In addition to security personnel (who
function as police), a starport may have an SDE (with a military function).
The SDE is established to defend the starport against organized assault, and
its equipment may include troops, fighter craft, missile defenses, and
artillery. The SDE, to maintain its independence from the local world, is
often a mercenary force specifically created for the job.
	Since an SDE is rarely larger than absolutely necessary, it is possible to
gauge the local perceived threats to a starport by observing the size and
equipment of the LDE.
	Scout Base. The scout service (whether of the Imperium or of some other
interstellar community) may maintain a port facility for the support and
maintenance of its vessels (including those vessels which it may have out on
loan to detached duty scouts). It is possible that the world on which a scout
base is located is not a member of the  interstellar community which the scout
service serves.
	Many scout bases make the information they have accumulated available outside
of their service (including maps, charts, and world surveys).
	Naval Base. The Navy (whether of the Imperium or of some other interstellar
community) may maintain a port facility for the support and maintenance of its
vessels. The base includes administration sections, warehouse for provisions
and resupply, and some security personnel.
	The continuing interest of naval personnel in their career area makes naval
bases favorite stopovers for veterans (even of other navies).
	Sometimes a specific naval base may be considerably more extensive than the
typical installation. Their facilities and equipment come to dominate the
starport rather than complement it.
	System Defense Field. The interplanetary defense forces of a system may
maintain a facility for the support of their vessels (system defense boats) as
they rotate off station from the outer reaches of the systems. The field has a
minimum of facilities (provisions are trucked in when needed; repair trucks
call as required). 
	Shipyard. Ships are built at shipyards. For ships of moderate size which will
be streamlined and capable of landing on worlds, construction often takes
place on world surfaces at starport shipyards.
	Most shipyards specialize in the construction of a specific assembly (which
local industry has shown itself capable of producing) such as jump drives,
avionics, detectors, or even stateroom modules. Other components are purchased
from other shipyards and imported as part of the TNAS-certified parts system.
	Warehouses on-site store components until they are ready for assembly. Ships
themselves are constructed in open-air bays (or in enclosed assembly
structures if the local environment requires).
	Repair Facility. Minor repairs to ships are often accomplished on the landing
pad. More complex or extensive repairs require that the ships be moved to the
repair bays at the edge of the starport. Support installations near the bays
house the instrumentation and equipment necessary for repairs.
	Transport Hub. The starport is usually integrated into the global
transportation net, and arriving passengers transfer from the terminal to the
transport hubs. Depending on the world, the hubs may support sea or undersea
transport, air transport, or ground rail transport. In addition, personal
vehicle rental may be available.
	Industry. Many industrial processes are best carried out in zero-G and/or
vacuum. What better place for such operations than adjacent to a major orbital
transportation center? Industrial modules attached to the Highport create
products or commodities which benefit from immediate access to the ships
calling at the port. Some factories have long-term supply contracts with the
highport itself.

Organization
	A starport has an organizational structure which includes a leader and a
mission; the details of each starport are different, although they are
generally variations on a basic theme.
	The Port Authority. Regardless of the local government in power at the
starport, the governing authority for the facility is the Port Authority.
Financed by a variety of charges and levies on passengers, cargo, and ships,
the Authority uses its money to build and maintain its facilities, and to
provide variety of services. Like starports, Port Authorities vary widely in
structure and approach to their responsibilities. Some are strong corporate
organizations devoted to the pursuit of profit; others are non-profit
organizations which view their responsibilities more as services to the
citizenry; yet others consider themselves a quasi-official arm of local
government.
	The Port Warden. The person in complete charge of the starport is the Port
Warden. Appointed by the Port Authority, the Warden is the chief executive
officer for the facility, and wields great, but not unlimited power. 
	The Mission of the Starport. The starport, as an organization, is committed
to a mission (although that mission may not be clearly or publicly stated).
Typical missions are:
		To efficiently provide facilities and services necessary to accommodate
interplanetary and interstellar traffic for this world.
		To produce a maximum of income for the organization which operates this
starport.
		To insulate this world, to the maximum extent possible, from outside
influences.
		To meet the minimum requirements for maintaining interstellar trade.
	Regulation Enforcement. The police and security arm of the Port Authority has
the responsibility of protecting the orderly operation of the starport and of
enforcing its regulations. It consists of enforcers and emergency technicians.
	The typical enforcer carries out the role of helpful police officer, often
assisting passengers in mundane tasks. Behind the scenes, however, a stronger,
better armed force stands ready to back them up if necessary.
	Emergency technicians provide basic services such as paramedical response,
rescue operations, and fire fighting. Emergency tech stations are situated
throughout the starport, providing the ability to make a quick response
anywhere within the starports boundaries.

Each Starport Is Unique
	Starports vary widely due to the circumstances and environment in which they
exist. When the differences in world size, atmosphere, and hydrographics are
coupled with population and technological levels, government, and trade
classifications, it becomes clear that each starport is an individual
facility.

UNOFFICIAL FACILITIES
	Not all facilities at a starport come under the jurisdiction of the Port
Authority. 
	The Scout Lounge. Those who conduct surveys of star systems and who
continually venture out into unexplored or under-explored space are a special
type of people. After long periods of time alone or with their fellow crew,
they naturally gravitate to others of their kind... to share stories and
experiences which may help them survive. The typical starport has a Scout
Lounge for this type of people.
	The Scout Lounge is usually operates as a semi-private club; theoretically
anyone can use its services, but in practice it is only patronized comfortably
by scouts (and those with an affinity for scouts).
	The Hiring Hall. Crew members looking for work gather at the hiring hall.
Ships calling at the starport look first to the hiring hall when they need new
or replacement crew. Because of ship schedules which must be met, it is
possible for a crew person to be hired and off world within a few hours
notice.
	The Lone Star. Many starports have a recreation facility which welcomes and
serves all comers. At its tables, people meet and enjoy light music or video,
conversation, and meals. To many the Lone Star is an opportunity to meet
others on a casual basis, to develop acquaintances, and even grow them into
friendships.
	The Travellers Aid Society. Some individuals make travel their primary
vocation. If they are able, they join the Travellers Aid Society, which
provides facilities to its members. The Travellers Aid Society is a joint
operation of several large hotel chains, which provide the facilities within
or adjacent to their own hotels and restaurants.
	Members join by depositing a large sum of money as annuity, with the proceeds
paying for the benefits they receive.
	Startown. Although starports are often established near large cities, the
community which springs up at the gates to the starport has come to be called
(generically) Startown. This community is the home of many of the starport
employees and houses many stores, restaurants, and meeting places that serve
those who want to wander outside of the starports boundaries.

EXTERNAL CONTROLS
	Starports and spaceports exist to participate in interplanetary or
interstellar trade. They belong to a network of similar installations, and
each depends on the other to provide the traffic that gives meaning and
purpose to the installation.
	Starports and spaceports must be responsive to three distinct external
controls or powers.
	Local World or System Government. Local government exercises considerable
power over a starport (or spaceport). Through taxation and law, the starport
is dependent on the goodwill of local government. This influence is primarily
felt in the statement of the mission of the starport.
	Interstellar Government. Interstellar government has a vested interest in
creating and maintaining viable starports on worlds where trade produces
economic benefits. Interstellar Government influences starports through
pressure on local government, and by establishing bases (naval or scout) which
increase the viability of the local starport.
	The Ship Owners and Operators. Ship owners and operators serve starports
which allow them to make profits. Even high service fees, taxes, and
assessments do not deter them if there are profits to be made.
	The Passengers and Freight Shippers. Passengers and Freight Shippers are
rarely organized, but their power is felt if they do not patronize a starport.
The organization representing the passengers is the Travellers Aid Society,
which works with starports to improve facilities and services as is
economically feasible.

Travel Zones
	A Travel Zone is a notification that a specific world may be dangerous to
travellers.
	Amber Travel Zones. An Amber Travel Zone label is cautionary: the location
may present some level of hazard to travellers. That hazard may be natural
(disease, local predators or parasites), sociological (uncommon or strange
social practices), or governmental (repressive, intolerant, or xenophobic
policies). Travellers are warned to be aware of these hazards and guard
against them. The Amber Travel Zone label is applied by the Travellers Aid
Society.
	Red Travel Zones. A Red Travel Zone label is interdictive: the location
presents such a level of danger that travel to the location is prohibited. The
Red Travel Zone label may be applied by the Travellers Aid Society, or by an
interstellar government (for the worlds within a system), or by local
government (for a world within a system).

UNDERSTANDING STARPORTS
	The key to understanding a starport is a continuing awareness of its purpose.
Starports exist to foster traffic, and thus trade, between the stars.
Governments may attempt to control or suppress the activities of starports,
but when they do, they naturally suppress the benefits of trade and commerce
for their worlds. The natural state of starports is to flourish; if the
starports world has resource which can be profitably marketed to other
worlds, the starport generate economic benefit.
	Extra-Territoriality. In order to foster interstellar traffic, starports are
extra-territorial. Just as embassies are treated as if they are the territory
of their owning nations, starports are treated like they are off-world space.
Passengers and crew alike are allowed to leave their starships and wander
freely (subject to security and safety restrictions) throughout a starport.
Goods are not subject to customs or taxes until they leave a starport. The
laws of the world do not apply to until a traveller leaves the starport.
	Law and Order. There must be some law and order within a starport, and the
means of achieving that order is the local Starport Regulations. Established
by the Port Authority, these regulations define in detail what behaviors are
permitted and prohibited. For most people, ordinary behavior is sufficient to
stay within the regulations. Strange requirements are typically posted
clearly.
	Ship Construction and Repair. Starships and spacecraft require an extensive
system of construction and repair sites, and the overhead of designing and
maintaining the many parts which go into ships can be overwhelming.
Consequently, many starports subscribe to the TNAS (Quality Ship Design
Scheme): a set of standard component specifications which are manufactured on
worlds with the appropriate tech level and industrial capacity, but which can
be assembled and maintained at any starport of the appropriate type,
regardless of local tech level or industrial capacity. 
	Money. Ultimately, every starport must make money if it is to remain in
operation. Starports cannot give their services away, but most find a way to
hide those charges away from the consuming public. Restaurant charges include
a surcharge; starship lines pay a portion of their ticket price and freight
charges to the starport. Since all of this is concealed from the typical
passenger, the impression is that the starport is a free facility.

STARPORT AMBIENCE
	The ambience of the starport is of prime importance. When travellers arrive
at a starport the atmosphere and the condition of the facilities create an
impression that will stay with them for a long time. This impression (and the
elaboration of this impression) develops over time. 
	The appearance of a starport may range from modern or new to old and decayed.
	The staff of a starport may be respectful and attentive, or rude and
obnoxious.
	Officials may be straightforward and honest, or they may be corrupt and self-
serving.

MANY DIFFERENT STARPORTS
	Starports vary in the way their provide their services. Major influences on
them include the world trade classifications, the elements of the UWP, and
other less clear factors.
	Water World. With land at a premium, starships land in the water (perhaps
sheltered by natural or artificial islands) and are serviced by boats.
	Asteroid Belt. Ships dock in the microgravity of an asteroid.
	Storms. If a world has an exceptionally turbulent atmosphere, most traffic
may choose to call at the highport and shuttle down on craft specifically
engineered for local conditions.

Private citizens of the Imperium was supposed to be able to buy missiles
for their ships in CT, MT and so on. When TNE came out some wize guy
decided that x-ray det laser nukes were cool so he decided that the
missiles were of this kind.

So in TNE and T4(+) private citizens may own their own cozy x-ray det nukes
(how that meshes with the Imperial rules of war is a question for the
listoids that like the TNE/T4 explanation of missiles).

AS far as I know US and Chinese citizens are NOT allowed to own nukes,
nerve gas etc. The right to bear arms of the US does not allow you to own
nukes does it? (I\'m shure some gun geeks out there think it does but...).

Pocket Empires tries to model this; to build a starport A from 
scratch would take  60 years and cost 15,600 TCr (or double the cost 
and halve the time).

the cargo bay.  When a ship accelerates no one feels it because of the
ineratial compensators. I stole Star Treks structural integrity field to
allow higher G ratings (remember no jump drive. The warp metric

  Perpendicular is too complex, inconvenient and costly for me. Yes
costly. I have too many things that cover too many decks. I believe that

many small sections rather than two or three large ones.
   As to parellel designs being like airplanes, I prefer to look at subs

remember, the only difference between an ocean and space is space is
larger, colder and has gravity. 
     I think the discussion, while interesting, is moot. None of the

Just one point here...  If a ship has Contra-Grav then would it not be able
to hover for the time you need it to?

  It might be useful to consider that we now know that a CT powerplant
really produces "only" 250 MW per HG powerplant # per 100 D-Tons of
vessel. Beyond that it\'s unclear whether Mr. Costikyan was being
absurdist or merely careless. Given his other work on interstellar
trade and his analysis of trade in Traveller in particular I have
to wonder just what his purpose might have been in making such incomplete
or inaccurate observations.

  I once ran a too-brief campaign where the background made supposedly
more realistic interpretations about the ramifications of cheap energy
technology, although not to the extent that you\'re likely thinking.
There may very well be scarcity still of certain things, not least human
talents and skills. Also, while an installed facility might provide large
amounts of cheap power, it may not be mobile (a la fusion in 2300 AD), or
it might just cost like hell anyway.

  The cycle has to maintain itself for some time before cheap energy
extends to a potential cheap supply of the power generators themselves.
You can make some startling contrasts in such a background between the
various have-nots and the ultimate haves.

Hmm. Have plentiful energy, do lots of things.
My take on this is that the tech level index in Traveller is a
logarithmic scale based on energy availability in a given culture.
Examples of fiction set in energy rich universes include John Varley\'s
\'Ophiuchi Hotline\' and the Culture novels of Iain Banks : \'Consider
Phlebas\', \'The Player of Games\', \'Use of Weapons\', and \'Excession\'.
Greg Costikyan\'s comments were made about Classic Traveller, given the
quoted date.
A rationale advanced in later years, perhaps in response to this
criticism, was that part of the fuel required for the jump was fused to
energise the jump grid and create a jump bubble ; the majority of the
fuel was emitted from the ship while it was in jump space to stop the
bubble from collapsing and destroying the ship.....

Fusion produces a lot of energy ; all of the good gear that becomes
available at the same time uses it up.

The command rules are what makes it *interesting* and more realistic.  In 
other miniatures rules I\'ve seen, you can exploit an opponent\'s mistakes 
instantly.  In Striker, you *HAVE* to use chain of command in both directions. 
 Cool stuff, IMNSFBHO.

There are no coincidences Citoyen Hudson.  You do not really think that
_They_ would not have ensured their influence over the chaotic French
state.  Since, as Kenji & I have already established, we know that the
Nineteenth century was a hotbed of plotting between Vilani & Hiver
agents is it really all that surprising that a few other "Major Races"
(ie those that Cthul, er Yaskodr, er nevermind, helped out) had agents
in place.  

Which other Major race of terran descent would be most comfortable in
the chaotic quickly changing political conditions of the Comite de Salut
Public, conditions in which a politician could quickly rise to the top
using only their Charisma (and a suitably large pile of guillotined
Ci-devant aristo bodies)?  Of course any plan of _theirs_ was bound to
fall apart sooner or later due to their own disorder.  This is how the
Var, er Jacobins, fell and were replaced by the Directory as part of the
Vil, er Thermadorian Reaction.  Little did the Directorate know that
they too were on the way out.  It is sort of odd that the powers behind
the Consulate did know ahead of time that a little Corsican nobody was
destined for greatness.  Why it is almost as if they could see the
future....

Picture a world with an airborne version of rabies, with a long incubation
time.  *Any* exposure to the world\'s atmosphere exposes you.  Might be
easier to declare the place off-limits.

High radiation levels, extremely nasty local wildlife.. any yhting that
presents a real threat to anyone who landed there.

A few years back I did a critter that had a telepathic ability to track
prey, and used the telepathy talent Assault to kill prey.  The beasts\'
homeworld was Red Zoned.  Why?  Because if you survived the attack, it jump
started the victim\'s natural psionic abilities!

Red and Amber zoning, remember, is designated by the Travellers Aid Society,
not the Imperium. TAS Red zones Imperial naval quarantines, so those are
automatically on the list, but the others are done by the TAS based on their
danger to travellers. Officially it\'s for TAS members only, but as the TAS
became a well known and respected organization, their designations took on an
air of official status.

However, much like Mobil\'s restaurant guide, they\'re still designated by a
private organization, so they can set the criteria any way they want. So lots
of places that are just the pits to visit, get designated Amber or Red. Or
anyplace that\'s pissed off the TAS...heh heh heh...

Given that TAS runs the most widely known news service as well, the actual
power that TAS exerts over the Imperium is considerable.

BUT, given that most of the Old Boy/Girl/Vargr/Etc nobles that _run_ the
Imperium, are also probably TAS members, it\'s a much more intertwined thing.

	1. Interior structure calculations changed, resulting in larger
ships requiring proportionally more structure.
	2. Material toughnesses are *exactly* (15/10.5) times the FF&S1
values.
	3. Hull factors (MVM, etc.) were corrected, and additional variety
in configurations added.
	4. Primitive rocket numbers were supposed to be corrected to match
realworld values--I *believe* but have not confirmed that there were
problems in this.

mounts, in the amount of volume required to provide different levels
of pointing.
	7. Fusion rocket fuel consumption was corrected
	8. Asteroid hulls returned.
	9. Fusion power plants below TL-12 have a minimum size 10x that of

spacecraft, grav vehicles, and aircraft.

	Those are the big ones that pop into my mind for the parts I did.

	Errr ... I thought "replacement value" EXCLUDED depreciation--that\'s
how my homeowner\'s policy works. I\'m not covered for the current

replace it with the equivalent.

FYI, your second example is an issue of honorable dealings with other
nations, not with one\'s own citizenry.  The service in question was Army
signal intelligence:

"The [Army] all but retired from the field [of signal intelligence] in
1929, when President Herbert Hoover\'s consipicuously honorable new
secretary of war, Henry L. Stimson, reacted angrily to the Japanese
intercepts appearing daily on his desk.  \'Gentlemen do not read one
another\'s mail,\' he decreed and ordered it stopped...." (Dan van der
Vat, _The Pacific Campaign:  The U.S.-Japanese Naval War 1941-1945_,
[Touchstone, 1992], pp. 89-90)

I realize that my post does little or nothing to answer your post, but
it poses some interesting spin-offs:

1.  Does the various Imperial intelligence services still use SIGINT to
any useful degree?  If so, how do they collect?  (Possibly listening
ships out in the Oort Cloud area [300 AU or so] or beyond?)

2.  What other means of colecting intelligence are used by Imperial
intelligence services?

3.  We know that, at very least, the Imperial Army and Navy run
intelligence schools (Book 4, pg. 5; Book 5, pg. 9), and that the IISS
both debriefs detached duty scouts and maintains agent nets in
[unspecified] vital areas (Book 6, pg. 5).  What other canon/near-canon
intelligence services are there in the Imperium?

4.  Is there any kind of coordination between Imperial intelligence
services?  If so, what agency is in charge?

Since the tech is futuretech, we can\'t be sure of what it can and
can\'t do; I\'m willing to allow an environmental Amber on the
assumption that it\'s either of a nature or intensity that
readily-available tech can\'t handle easily (Red if not at all).
Perhaps it\'s an insidious atmosphere that can defeat _any_
protection (not just any protection) in _minutes_ instead of
hours (sounds Red to me).  Perhaps the planet is Trenco, with
those wonderful winds (Definite Amber, without the Thionite
plants; I can see it being Red if Thionites grow there).

IIRC, it\'s a TNE artifact.  Blues are Balkanized TNE worlds; the
GOV digit would then give the predominant form of government on
the world.

Look at the date; he was writing in 1982. The 1 power point = 250 MW conversion
was introduced in Striker. Prior  to that (1983, if I recall correctly)
the conversion between power points and MW was undefined...and given the
huge fuel consumption, Costikyan\'s statement - while somewhat 
absurdist. - wasn\'t too exagerated. (It shows that he wasn\'t a gearhead,
foc of course - a gearhead wouldn\'t look at those number and conclude
"therefore the trade frrules are brokeb" but "therefore the fuel consuption
rules are broken".)

(Excuse bad typing - bad termnal.)

For what it\'s worth, my wife the primate geneticist gonna-be geek (her
words) says that gibbons are wickedly difficult to work with - they are
allergic to the gluten in wheat, and thus much more demanding to maintain
in captivity.

I know what the canon says, but I\'ve recommended Bonobo chimps as a more
viable alternative.

Also, GURPS Uplift has rules for chimp and dolphin characters, but that
won\'t help with MT.

Well, technically, the doors in question weren\'t opened; they were blown,
with demo charges.  But point taken.

Note that your policy will also keep people from venting compartments to
space to put out shipboard fires... hope your fire-suppressant system
is up to snuff.

Oh, you can vent - it just takes time measured in minutes (to stay
kosher with the CT space combat rules about depressurizing for
combat). A compartment going to near-vacuum (enough for fire
suppression or to prevent a compartment from explosively decompressing
in combat) in a matter of minutes will be no threat to a vac-suited
boarding party, and will give unsuited people a chance to grab suits.
Explosive decompression is what can bounce people about, even be
a danger to people in suits.

My take on Amber Zones like this was local flora, fauna or conditions
that were unusually or deceptively dangerous. Carnivores that stunned
you through your suit at range with sonics then pack-attacked you.
Thin atmosphere coupled with very high meteoric activity. A standard,
tainted atmosphere, traces of the taints can cause psychotic 
hallucinations and paranoia when the traces make it through
the kind of decontamination available on most spacecraft.

Amber zones are travel advisories. Red zones indicate travel is
forbidden. Amber means travel at your own risk, red means
Navy or Scout ships will intern you or blast you out of space if
you insist on travelling there.

Once you stop using radio, sigint is less useful, on the grounds the other
side isnt actually broadcasting.

The good old traditional ones, I think - human factors and observation.

Lots. I think there are 2 Intel branches in the IN, plus about 8 discrete
branches of the IISS have intelligence type roles (if I remember correctly,
only 5 of them report via Operational Control, but I cant find Book 6 right
now). Then we have quasi-intelligence branches such as Imperiallines, and
the traditionally close relationship between the megacorps (and their
covert bureaus) and the Imperial government.

I think Ministry of Justice would also have some sort of role.

Then we have people like Bubbles, who went to school with Cha-Cha, and who
tends to know all sorts of people.

I wasn\'t aware that Orangs and Gibbons _played_ MT.

As everyone knows, Orangs prefer TNE, while Gibbons are still waiting for T5.

I would have to say, yes...  SIGINT is a great source for intel...  Esp.
about what a foe will do...  Where his ships are...  Etc...

HUMINT would I think be a real biggie...  I mean in a nation the size of
the Sword\'s Worlds I think you could even slip in serveral agents in & use
free traders as the communications vector...

Free Traders are everywhere & as such everyone knows them...

Dragon Mag had an Intelligence Agent Career done a few years ago for
CT/MT...  They talked about Imperial Intel, Sector Intel, Sub-Sector Intel,
Planet Intel, Private, & Mega-Corp Intel Agencies...  I think I may have it
around here somewhere...

> 4.  Is there any kind of coordination between Imperial intelligence

Yes, I would have to say that Navy, Marine, Scout, Sector, Sub-Sector,
Planetary, & Mega-Corp Intel Agencies all would work together, but as to
who is in charge, well I think you would have to go via Sr. Service...

First, Navy, second, Marines, third, Scouts, fourth, Sector, fith,
Sub-Sector, & sixth, Planetary, & last Mega-Corp...

  Drop off passive sensor units and then infiltrate to collect data every
once in a while - with accurate deep-space jumping neighbouring interstellar
states border regions can be lousy with listening posts (one shudders to 
think what the Islands sub-sectors piranha pool is like).

>2.  What other means of colecting intelligence are used by Imperial
>intelligence services?

  Agents/informers work both inside and out; intelligence ships also, but
most risky where most useful - in the other states territory. Disguising
yourself as a trader might help, but you might end up MIA regardless,
peacetime or no.

  The most cost-efficient (and possibly most effective for some purposes)
internal security aid would be collating flight plans and starport records.
Any ship that retroactively can be determined to have done something that
it claims it didn\'t, or that it supposedly _can\'t_ do, is desperately asking
to be listed as "search or seize when encountered", cc\'d to the relevant
authorities.

  This would tend to the conclusion that the most valuable form of "enemy"
data is their own ship traffic data stream, and an agent or tap into that
would be a most valuable asset for getting a genuine picture of the other
sides economic structure - a lot like real-life recon photos of rail-nets.

...
 (point 3 on canon 3I intel services skipped due to incomplete collection)
  Actually, wouldn\'t ImperialLines in its\' various forms count?

>4.  Is there any kind of coordination between Imperial intelligence
>services?  If so, what agency is in charge?

  Presumably, although there may be an interrupt between internal political
info and everything else - it might be prudent _not_ to have INI involved
in the former. It might not be improbable for the central clearing house to
be in the Imperial Household staff - similar things have happened.

Thanks, and I have those rules already but I much prefer BL
and BR, a FF&S1
version would be great, but only if it is radically different from FF&S2,
I do not have the latter so I do not know how different it is

Hmm.... OK, I can see your point.  I just got to remember that
RedZ worlds need to be REALLY mean, while AmberZ
system\'s just need to be mean or weird.  One of my implicit
assumptions was that TL 15 science would have completely
transended the natural world, on the planetary scale.

What I really need is naturally occuring threat\'s, worthy of
being Red or Amber Zoned.  It\'s been too long since I have
read some interesting Sci-fi, so excuse my lapse\'s of
imagination:

Psionic animals (stolen from Douglas Berry, who sole it from... ?)
Jump-hating star\'s (from Challenger)
Hostile, sophisticated airborne diseases (Douglas Berry again)
Naturally occuring EMP pulses (or other influences that
  ruin\'s electronic\'s)
Continuous, severe earthquake activity (Amber zone)
Regular, heavy meteor shower\'s
Solar Flame activity (Better lift off NOW!)
Massive tidal activity (Amber zone)
Worldwide, unpredicable fires
Enormous, very active volcanoes (including the super-hot gases
   those volcanoes may give off)
Endless, incredible electrical storm\'s (Maybe Amber zone, maybe not)
Hollowed-out crust: major section\'s of the ground can collapse at any time
  (Amber Zone)
Very hostile, intelligent biospheres - especially if they can
   quickly create new animal\'s and diseases to defeat countermeasures
   (This isn\'t really natural: more like an artifact of preHuman
intelligence)
The air is full of naturally-occuring monofilimant wire ("Red Zone" taken
   very literally)
There\'s Something in the Crust that\'s big, fast, and like\'s eating buildings
   (Amber Zone, at best - thank\'s to densitometer\'s and meson gun\'s)
Non-corporal lifeforms (at *least* Amber - who want\'s to live on a world
   of ghosts?)
Mental interference (for example, Human\'s MUST dream, or go mad: but if the
  electrical field won\'t allow sleep or dreams...)
Jinxed worlds - worlds that, for unexplained reason\'s, seem to harm
  all those who set foot on it.  (ie: within a ten-year period, EVERYONE
  who land\'s on Sarina eventually burst\'s into flames.  No one know\'s
  why, but until then the Red Zone stay\'s.  If the system caused sterility
  instead, it might be Amber Zoned...)

I\'d like to see a lot more of this kind of stuff in the Imperium: civil
organizations that have a major impact on how people actually
live and operate.

True... who exactly is TAS\'s constituency?  Free trader\'s,  manufactoring
corporations, the tourist industry, the MegaCorporations?  Taking their name
literally, I\'d assume that they work for Traveller\'s, that group of
interstellar
vagabond\'s that provides the grease that keep\'s the Imperium humming.
The MegaCorp\'s and the other major interest\'s have their own intelligence-
gathering services (mainly overt and public, btw).

Mainly a form of "soft power", but power nevertheless.

>BUT, given that most of the Old Boy/Girl/Vargr/Etc nobles that _run_ the
>Imperium, are also probably TAS members, it\'s a much more intertwined
thing.

Incidentally, my guess is, of any 10 high nobles (subsector Duke +)

1 - other non-human race
1 - Vargr
2 - Vilani
3 - Solomani
3 - Mixed Vilani/Solomani

Vargr nobles are concentrated in the Coreward Imperium
(Spinward Marches - Antares, close to the Vargr Extent\'s/
Julian Protectorate.).  Vilani nobles are common,
but noticably fewer in the region\'s Behind the Claw (which were
never part of the First Imperium).

Mixed Vilani/Solomani are common, but especially numerous
in the rimward Imperium, close to the Solomani sphere.
Solomani nobles exist throughout the Imperium: they are
not very numerous compared to the general popualtion,
but are over-represented in the noble ranks.

Yep, I\'d like a published clarification on both honour ( a major thread

how honour affect\'s the secret service\'s.

If I remember Survival Margin correctly, it mentioned that there were a
mess of secret servcies within the Imperium, often at loggerhead\'s.

We really need some oversight, here.

IMTU, the Navy is the primary coordinator of intelligence activities.  The
IISS provides most of the HUMINT personnel and SIGINT platforms.  Army
Intel is more focussed, ususally on a threat-by-threat basis.. Lunion Army
cares about SWC activities, and nothing else.

A) When do you resolve planetary devolpment tasks?
1-When The RUs are paid
2-when the nominal time is up
3- during the immediate resolution phase (10)

The last seems most likely since otherwise oustanding success will come to
late in time (Oh we finished doing that 30 yrs ago) or Could deliver an
overly large bonus (Oh no how do i spend 1200 RU in a single turn, My GWP
is only 250!)  However it means that failures are immediete, even if I
have not spent the money.  

B) If I fail a planetary development meta-task, does it cost any RU?, Do I
lose what I would have spent?  Spectacular dfailure on Infrastructure
seems to imply not. 

C) How does popularity work?  It says (Part 6 p. 55) the popularity action
bonus "is determined by the sauccess (or failure) of any world-scale
meat-tasks undertaken in previous turns."  What meta tasks?  The only ones
I can think of are planetary development, and these have no popularity
effects except inasmuch as they modify BASE poularity.
Does leadership carry over with action bonus? I think not but...

D) When a new world is  added (whether willingly or not )to the empire
what
happens to the
poularity? (p.55) states that its popularity is "inverted" and becomes the
new values?  Is this a change in base popularity (surely not) or more
likely an Action Bonus?  (&if so then it may be more than 15)  If the
latter then it continues on until eroded
by +ve points. (And I can find no way of earning them)
 
E) Part 3 p. 29 states that "popularity = Base + Action bonus" leadersip
is
not mentioned? Action bonus is defined in terms of presige modifers
(glossary p. 98); are there suposed to be two different kinds of action
bonus (which I think is the case?)

F) Part 7 page 66 states that when a world is forcibly added to the empire
;
you shpuld set the popularity to "15 less the current popularity"  does
this refer to  base popularity or total popularity?  is it vsupposed to be
an
action bonus?  How does the restriction  on its application (only
forcibly acquired worlds) square with \'D\' above?

G) There seem to be some tables missing.

H) Part 7 p. 73 suggests that unilateral metatasks listed in this chapeter
impact upon "World realtionships, Relationships and popularity";
popularity seems to refer only to PE prrestige, and not popularity in
general - is this the case?  What is the difference between "world
realationships" and "relationships" -  I thought that there were only
relationships between PEs?  Given the effects of Bi-lateral meta-tasks(p.
76), it seems that only the meta-tasks previous to the section "impact on
World..." p. 73 and only in Part 7 are so affected by that section - is
this true?

I am utterely mystified by some of this.  My copy is listed as being
edition 4.1.  If anyone can help I would be grateful.

You know, I was working up the Islands Clusters for GT.  Using the GURPS
Space rules for installations (bases, universities, alien enclaves, etc.),
the main planets in the Clusters can have an effectively limitless number
of espionage facilities on them - roll 3d6 less than TL+PR (=*19* for the
major planets) for the first installation, keep rolling additional
installations until you fail... [GURPS Space, p. 123]  Of course, some of
those "espionage facilities" may consist of only one agent.

I interpret this to mean that spy-tech is big business in the Clusters.

     Now this I can agree with. At the cost of TAS membership, the
probability of anyone less than nobility acquiring it by outright
purchase would be remote to non-existent. Given this to be true, the
majority of members are nobility, and therefore the information would be
biased to that group OR whoever paid sufficient to the piper. Only those
persons (speculative merchants, scout surveyors) who survived an
especially violent world and reported same may have had their report
picked up by TAS. (ala Alien / Aliens)
     But whoever believes the lowly? I\'m sure that some mercenary would
want to check it out. "Der ain\'t nuttin\' out dare what can wup me." sort
of scenario.
     The only operation that may adhere to those ratings would be the
passenger only merchant. If such a world was *in the way* without a way
around it, his jump route would terminate just before it.
     TAS ratings are (should be) on an enter at your own risk basis.

IMTU, TAS is a Mega-Organization.  It is a huge non-profit
corporation that dwarfs even the largest Mega-Corp in size, revenue
and influence.  The only other organizations that approach it in
size are a couple of religious ones:  the Catholic Church and the
Church of the Universal (The Listers).  IMTU, TNS is a TAS
subsidiary...and maybe qualifies as an intellegence agency.  It has
it\'s own small exploration division, and (maybe) ships and repair
facilties of its own as well.  It owns, or has interests in, banks
and investment houses all over space, and if a Traveller needs her
credits changed for local currency TAS is there to help.

In many ways TAS is almost a "shadow government" in the Imperium,
and IMTU (where there isn\'t an Imperium) it crosses government lines
to cover most of "known space."  Much of the business involving
trade (among other things) that gets done, gets done at a TAS
facility...either in a conference room or across a table in the
ubiquitous TAS Lounge.  

Because of it\'s close association with star travel, you can usually
find the TAS facilities somewhere in the Starport area.  Usually
near the local Ship Registry Office, Port Captain\'s Office and
Spacer\'s Guild Hall.

One quick way to get designated a Red Zone is for the local
government to give TAS a difficult time.  You won\'t find TAS
facilities in a Red Zone system, and when TAS pulls out so does most
of the trade and traders.  Amber Zones *might* have limited TAS
facilities, especially if they are for "important" system, but for
whatever reason, TAS has determined that Travellers and Merchants
should be careful there.

As to whether there\'s something *more* to TAS than providing Aid for
Travellers is left to the imagination of the GM and players.

As you can see, TAS, as presented in the published material, always
seemed too limited to me.  ;-> IMTU TAS has a number of membership
levels.

The Individual Membership is the normal one, similar to the one in
the books.  It costs a million, or being voted in by a TAS Subsector
Board and approved by a TAS Sector Board.  The benefits are periodic
high passages and free access to all TAS facilities (including some
private ones) and data...don\'t forget the data!  A full member could
*live* in a TAS hotel, but those rich enough to be Individual
Members usually want something *more* than middle class, and it\'s
fairly middle class living at TAS.

Corporations can (and most often do) buy Corporate Memberships with
TAS.  This doesn\'t give them the passages, but it does allow
corporate employees access to TAS facilities and its datafiles on a
low charge back basis.

Independent merchants, wealthy travellers and the lower nobility
often buy Associate Memberships giving them access to *some* TAS
facilities and data for specified periods of time.  [ For fees
inquire at your local TAS facility.  ;-> ] 

Members may also bring "guests" into TAS facilities.  These guests
are there on a "pay as you go" basis.

In a game, *somebody* usually has either a full or associate
membership, allowing the others in the party to get access to the
facilities.  I tend to use TAS as the common location that players
can depend on being there...even on an unfamiliar planet saying
"Meet me in the TAS lounge." or "Take me to TAS." usually works.
Beyond "known space", where TAS hasn\'t penetrated yet, travellers
are on their own.

Marc has said something like, "all adventures start in a Starport",
I modify that to, "most adventures start at TAS."

BTW, one career that I\'ve never seen discussed is that of TAS
employee.  IMTU, there\'s more to it than being an innkeeper.  ;->

For the Sword Worlds they\'d pretty much have to be natives. IIRC the Sword
Wrolds all have cultures that are _very_ slightly different one from the
other, to the point that only Sword Worlders can tell the difference. I
would be easy for an agent or other imposter to trip up in such an
environment.

That\'s great, and so it is (or will be) IMTU, as it should be, even in 
the TNE where it probably lost most of its vast fortunes to the results
of Virus.

Again we are in agreement in that is as it should be.

Now we are at loggerheads. If the TAS organization is a just and good
thing then it should be fair and unbiased in it\'s assessment of the non
member world. Otherwise in their limited view they are chastising every
free trader and legitimate trade association with their biased view.
This sounds like the spoiled kid routine. "No we don\'t want to play with
your rules in my backyard." "OK, I\'ll take my bat and ball, go home and
tell everyone your no fun to play with."

Ditto above.

If you meant that, in both cases, there was a real danger that the
traveller should be aware of (and I don\'t mean that government big mucky
muck has paid enough to purchase this no no designation) then I can see
a real value in the organization. That is the way I view it as operating
IMTU, i.e. not subject to the wims of those with   m o n e y . I see the
information as having been obtained by direct examination and probably
at some cost to someone. Is that not so IYTU.

and thus my remark about cost. The average PC character should not be
able to \'afford\' to buy a TAS membership and would only receive same as
a gift or employer supplied benefit while she/he stays employed.

nice touch. I like it. Makes it even more restrictive to get in.

but this shouldn\'t give them the right nor TAS the obligation to falsify
the danger to travel there unless it is in fact true. (It just may be if
the de-facto Megagcorp has fighting equipment in orbit to stop intrusion
by others.)

Another nice touch that has merit.

I didn\'t know that! I thought your membership paid for me when I\'m your
guest.

Yeppers. No disagreement there.

Well, I have found few locations outside the Imperium that don\'t have
some sort of TAS listing. Whether in fact it is TAS now, it will be when
they get there cause they\'ll probably be able to buy them out.

Both are usually in the same place, as I recall.

decks perpendicular to the main thrust; i think it looks \'cool\' and
\'spacey\'. Other people prefer decks parallel to the main thrust; they think
it looks \'cool\' and \'spacey\'. There are already at least six impossible
things in Traveller, so do whatever you think is cool. However, i have been
bothered by some specific statements presented in this thread. Hence, my
own humble, scratch calculations of the thrusts experienced by existing
constructs which have been used as models.

Buildings:
Buildings resist gravity. Their \'decks\' are perpendicular to this thrust.

Ships (and submarines):
Ships are pulled down by gravity and supported by the bouancy of water. If
a ship is not supported evenly, the hull acts as a beam when suspended
between two wave crests or as two cantilevers when supported by a single
wave crest. Everything inside a ship (or submarine) experiences gravity.
Marine vessels also experience the thrust of their engines. Gravity creates
and acceleration of 9.8m/s^2 which is the equivalent of going from zero to
100km/hr in under 2.5 seconds. Clearly gravity is the dominant thrust for
marine vessels and their decks are perpendicular to it. When decks are not
perpendicular (as in rolling and pitching) ships can run into severe
difficulty, as can aircraft.

Aircraft:
Aircraft experience gravity which is counteracted by a lifting force
generated by airfoils, rotors, jets or bouyant chambers. They also
experience a driving thrust from their engines which for most of the time
produces no acceleration (constant velocity). Excluding high performance
jets (which don\'t have decks anyway), gravity is the primary thrust
experienced by cargo, passengers and crew. Decks are perpendicular to
gravity.

Space Shuttle:
On the launch pad the decks are parallel to gravity and engine thrust. The
crew takes lift-off on their backs in couches. In orbit the vehicle
experience micro-gravity and orientation is irrelevant. On landing
(gliding) the decks are perpendicular to gravity. By Traveller standards
the SSV is an extremely primitive vehicle and probably not the best
standard for design details ;^)

Except the space shuttle, every existing constuct which has been presented
as a model for  Traveller space ships has \'decks\' perpendicular to the
dominant thrust, which in all cases is the Earth\'s gravity.

You may forget about gravity, but it never forgets about you.

Think about it like this, why send in an agent when you can have the agent
come to you...  Many agents are from the are you want to know about... 
They join up in your service for one reason or another...  Debt, greed,
hate are all things that would cause the 3I to gain an agent inside the
enemy camp...

As for slipping in an agent, well lets see, TAS is there...  Trade Houses
are there...  All you have to do is get good reliable information...  And,
from what I see the Swords Worlds have almost total freedom of the
press....  In other words, a 3I Mega-Corp allows 3I Intel to place a few
agents into it operations in the Sword Worlds...  Use their Ships to send
back the information, or to use Free Traders to do the same...  Not a
problem...

Yes, that\'s true.  In my version of TNE, it\'s the remments of TAS
that are the strongest influence in restoring travel and trade.  Of
course, I pretty much play in a universe thousands of years after
"the collapse"...no dark age or twilight for me, it was a 5,000 year
collapse where everyone (that the PC\'s know about) went back to TL0
and started over with a crazy intermix of all the races and species.

Well, that\'s not exactly what I meant.  By "give TAS a difficult
time" I mean kill/inprision/deport TAS employees, seize and/or
destroy TAS facilites, ipso facto that would make the system
dangerous to travellers.  However, who\'s to say that all the
employees of such a far-flung organization are going to be good
honest sophants?  Adventure seeds:  1.  The PC\'s are TAS auditors
sent by the Director General to investigate the Red Zoning of a
system and determine if the designation is justifed; 2.  The PC\'s
are citizens of (or hired by) a system unjustly labeled Red/Amber by
a corrupt TAS manager seeking to get the designation overturned; 3.
The PC\'s are interested parties trying to *get* a system ruled Red
or Amber because of some danger, but are running into a corrupt
manager that is being paid off by the local poobahs...complications
insue.

I do to, but any organization can have corrupt people working in it
and powerful people trying to influence it.  Usually, TAS works as
it should, IMTU, but *sometimes* it takes a wrong turn and the PC\'s
get caught in the cracks. Make sense? ;->

No, it shouldn\'t and doesn\'t usually, but it can when you bring
people into the equation.  I think we agree on the goals of TAS (the
public ones anyway ;-), but maybe my version is a little more
corruptible than yours.  

In mine, TAS has to continually self-police itself to stomp out
corruption, and it never *completely* succeeds.  However, it\'s the
self-policing and even-handed fairness that maintains its "pure and
the driven snow" public image.  Without the belief that TAS is
completely fair it couldn\'t *be* in all the systems of all the
competing stellar empires.

It might in the published material, it doesn\'t *exactly* IMTU.
Generally, the member\'s account is billed and it\'s up to him as to
whether he pays for his guests or he collects from them later.

Why do they have to?  They\'re not Imperial states.  They *could* be like the 
situation in Reavers\' Deep, only a bit more extreme: several small pocket 
empires each striving to come out on top of the political / economic struggle.

You\'re welcome, and I appreciate the comments.

Like a lot of folks I know, sometimes when I post an article to the
list that I\'ve put a lot of time into, and get no replies at
all...like it just dropped into a blackhole...it gets discouraging.

I want to let *everyone* that has posted interesting and thoughtful
messages that I appreciate them, and have saved many of them away
with the intention of using their ideas, and often with the
intention of replying...eventually.  If you haven\'t heard from me,
it wasn\'t because I haven\'t appreciated your work, generally it has
been because RL distracted me.  I\'m sure the same can be said by
*many* of us.

NEVER underestimate the power of Bubbles!
I mean, the women in the Traveller universe have *extraordinary*
level\'s of power, if they choose to put their mind to it!   (Completely 
ignoring the Aslan females, too.)

THEY know who\'s involved with who, THEY know what Daddy really 
did with the Amamda Expedition, THEY know who\'s wearing paste, 
and who\'s wearing genuine Dessri Fire Stones.

And remember that power in the Imperium flow\'s through the bloodlines.
Now, everyone know\'s that\'s it\'s the women who actually keep the
family rolling along harmoniously, and the women who know all 
the dirty details, which they may or may not choose to share with 
their husband\'s.  And God only know\'s how many are scheming to put
*their* child as Archon, complete with unfortunate accident\'s and 
rumour management.

True, I\'m assuming a patriarchal Imperium, which is only somewhat true
(power can flow to either men or women on an equal basis, but the 
very nature of power and the Imperial Hierarchy tends to promote 
masculine values - honour, duty, bravery, etc.).  However, I consider
it self-evident that women and men operate on rather different 
set\'s of principles and goal\'s, and these different goal\'s will
manifest themselves in different behaviour pattern\'s.

Which leaves the big question: what are the differences between 
Solomani and Vilani women, when it comes to behaviour and 
atitudes to children, husband\'s and family?  Are Vilani women have 
the same taste for the supernatural as Solomani women have?
Is Vilani civilization as biased to males as the Solomani?
Does Vilani women control the family wallet, as Solomani women
tend to?  Are mariages pernament in the typical Vilani household?
Are concubines expected?   

(Obviously, I do NOT have the Vilani & Vargr book...)

Star Trek premiered in 1966. So, except for C.S.Lewis, all the authors on
my rough list were active post Star Trek. Many have had new work published
in the 1990s. 2001: A Space Odyssey premiered in 1968, two years after Star
Trek hit television. (Development work began on Star Trek in 1963.) Solar
Odyssey (not a great movie, but rather interesting) is 1986 or 88 IIRC. In
comics Albedo (1980s) leaps to mind.

Urban legend has it that Traveller was influenced by Star Wars: A New Hope.

BTW Star Trek and Star Wars are both space opera. In Star Trek, Star Wars
or Traveller terms space is -still- a dream. The shuttle, Mir, Freedom
(can\'t remember the new name) and both U.S. and Russian manned missions are
designed to operate in microgravity, therefore no orientation in the sense
we have been discussing. And the shuttle is not going to Altair IV anytime
soon :^)

All three orientations (parallel, perpendicular and \'micro\') appear from
science fictions earliest days - in parallel, if you will ;-} The history
and body of science fiction and its sub-genres is very rich. Which, in a
round about way, brings me to another, greater point. How many here are
familiar with Alberto Manguel\'s and Gianni Guadalupi\'s work
_The_Dictionary_of_Imaginary_Places_? It\'s a magnificent work which details
places in fiction. Their criteria was that the place had to potentially
exist on Earth. Therefore, Burroughs\' Mars, for example, was excluded. (I
received my copy as a reward for academic excellence in grade 7. The same
teacher taught us to play Dungeons and Dragons: we had an hour on Friday
afternoons to play.) Who on the list would be interested in participating
in a similar compilation for planets detailed in science fiction? For
copyright purposes this tome would be restricted to private use and free
distribution within the group.

All reasons for having the ship laid out rather differently than is
usually seen. :-)

When/if I get the required info and do the designs for some
perpendicular ships, you\'ll see stuff laid out a lot differently. 

I hope to see cargo holds surrounding the drive on the bottom deck, for
instance. And docking for small craft would be with their decks
parallels to te ship\'s decks. And hopefully, close to the
crew/passenger quarters for easy evacuation in emergencies.

The same is true if they are perpendicular to thrust and the small
craft are docked with their decks parallel to the ones in the ship.

Trying to justify "treknology" is usually futile. If the ship shakes
every time it gets hit, then they ought to be turned into a thin film
whenever it accelerates.

Too much of the designs are based around the needs of TV and the (lack
of) intelligence in the producers and much of the audience.

Only if you insist on making the ship long and stretched out. Heck, the

Space *doesn\'t "have gravity". Or rather, the effects of gravity, being
uniformly applied , aren\'t *felt*. That\'s what free fall is all about.
Space isn\'t "cold" either. 

And BTW, ships, planes and subs all have perpendicular decks.
Perpendiucular to the major *acceleration force*! The "thrust" of the
engines is nowhere *near* the force of gravity. For spacecraft that\'s
not true.

Also, ships and subs are long and narrow because that lets them move
thru the water faster. It reduces drag. But take a good look at vessels
that don\'t have to move very fast, bu need to hold lots of stuff.
Ferries are a good example. They are rarely much more than twice as
long as they are wide. The wider beam gives more stability *and* makes
it easier to get stuff into them.

Sorry, but you must not "know" of many SF authors. Heinlein, Clarke,
Pournelle, Norton and many, many others designed "perpendicular" decks.
BTW, there are a lot of so-called "SF" movies where SF is "science
fantasy", not science fiction, regardless of what the publicity says.

One of Christopher Anvil\'s stories about Col. Towers and his group[1]
dealt with a planet inhabited by lizardman-like natives who could
teleport. Their abilities were both logically developed and "limited".

It developed that they could teleport to any *object* that they\'d had a
chance to "scan" (involved at least a brief touch). They could also
detect a little about the surroundings (mainly if there was enough room
for them to arrive). And they could tell if pieces were broken off the
target object or if it was broken. They had an *interstellar* range.

The above was basicly discovered when the scout who\'d first visited
went to investigate an asteroid in another system and accidentally
bumped his ship against it, crushing a seasheel that had somehow been
stuck to his ship with some sort of tarry substance. Suddenly there
were a bunch of very dead "lizardmen".

Now, consider the situation of the Centrans who\'d landed on this
planet. How do they get away without taking the natives with them?

The solution is lovely. 

[1]these stories are an offshoot of "Pandora\'s Planet" in which the
Centran Empire "conquers" Earth.

With power that cheap, you can process raw *rock* (and other solid
wastes) thru what amounts to an overgrown mass spectrograph to seperate
out all the elements present. So what if gold is one part per million?
That means you\'ll get one gram per ton of rock processed, plus one gram
each of the other "one part per million" elements.

Only if the *ship* is "high and narrow".

Each deck of the mother ship is about 3m tall. The small craft docks
while thrusting in the same direction as the mother ship\'s thrust.
If the small craft is longer than it is wide, then the hangar bay will
be several decks tall. Even for a ship\'s boat, you\'ll have a hangar
bay cargo hatch that\'s about 3m wide and about 12m tall.

My assumption was that for maneuver purposes it would be easier to
dock a small craft while it was travelling the same direction as the
mother ship - travelling paralell to the mother ship\'s direction of thrust.
Add to this that some small craft are longer than the cross-section
of their ship (Kinunir\'s Pinnace, for example).

There may be a structural integrity benefit to docking your boats with
their long axis paralell to direction of thrust. If your hangar bays
are laid out perpendicular to thrust, you have large areas with no
vertical load-bearing bulkheads. Hangar bays with long axis paralell to
thrust (regardless of how the mother ship\'s decks are laid out) 
give you more strong bulkheads over a cross-sectional area.

But the deckplans for this particular ship (Enterprise-D) were an

Its one of Travellers convienient "look the other way" bits. Power in the TU is 
mindbogglingly cheap (so cheap that parallel ship decks become econmically 
viable even :*>). The logical extension of this would be that there would be 
much less interstellar trade than is represented. This was Mr Costikyan whole 
premis (even though the article is based on a slightly faulty assumption). 
Therefore in order to retain playability, we just ignore this inconvient little fact.

BTW: Its frightening that I remember this article from when it was first published 
in Ares <shudder>. Even more so after I visited Mr Costikyan\'s website. Hey

Masculine values?  In our own culture, quite true, but I would hardly
expect any of this to remain constant over 2000+ years

Given that different Earth cultures have wildly different standards of
appropriate masculine and feminine activities, values, and professions,
and the fact that easy access to birth control seems to rapidly promote
female equality, I would expect the Solomani to be both more egalitarian
and quite different from us in terms of what is regarded as masculine and
feminine.  Since the Vilani evolved for 300,000 years on an entirely
different planet I would expect *great* differences between our ideas
about men and women and theirs. 

As a first guess:

My guess is that since they rigidly break society up on species grounds
the Solomani would be exceedingly egalitarian wrt men and women, to the
point of having effectively no sex discrimination, or even any sexual
division of labor, other than physically bearing children (and with
artificial wombs coming in at TL 9, may women may never bear children). 

In social terms I would expect that they would find the idea of separate
masculine and feminine activities & values somewhat baffling. 

The Vilani are a very status and class oriented society, so I would expect
moderately strong gender attitudes (likely no stronger than those in the
modern-day First World). 

However, I would expect these attitudes to be *very* different from our
own.  Evidence for a gender based personality traits is exceedingly
contradictory and such differences seem much more likely to be largely
determined by culture.

They never got out a third book, although several others beyond the 
two they started with were proposed.

Completed MT stuff by DGP:
World Builder\'s Handbook
Referee\'s Gaming Kit
101 Vehicles
Alien Vol. 1: Vilani & Vargr
Alien Vol. 2: Solomani & Aslan
Flaming Eye Campaign Sourcebook
MegaTraveller Journals #1-4
(Many of the later Traveller Digests had Megatraveller related 
material as well)
The Early Adventures (The Feature Adventures from Traveller 
Digests\' 1-4, reworked for MT).

In addition, they contributed heavily to most of GDW\'s stuff for MT, 
including writing Knightfall for them.

  Yes, because we\'ve been told (RSB, TCS) that just about the only thing
they agree on is the desirability of hammering away at each other. One
does begin to wonder what it\'s in aid of, as it hardly looks like they
want to co-habit or even administer each other.

  Worse, a campaign setting where campaign has its military meaning...
Seriously, perhaps the switch from STL to FTL culture went off so badly
because of its sudden nature - the quaint hatreds of the other European
cultures didn\'t matter much when they were isolated (nor did they make
much sense), but the same attitudes persisted into the Jump era, where
they immediately justified their paranoia by trying to conquer each
other. In other words, fluke/it\'s all self-inflicted.

I just had to build an adventure: military types,  please correct
where appropriate, so we can learn to do it right.

Traveller Adventure: Time for a wupping!

The PC\'s are recently discharges ex-military (Army or
Marines, Imperial or system), just breaking into the mercenaries field.
Looking for work, they sign up with a decent-looking outfit, Sammy\'s
Army (aka The Black Fist).  It\'s got a reputation for bravery and a
very nice, five-year contract with Gammite Corp, a mining/refining
concern found in 10 subsector\'s.

Setting:

Sammy\'s Army is mainly a battalion of leg infrantry (about 700 men), with
an artillery arm of 12 light howitzer\'s (six projectile gun\'s,
three laser, three meson) and a construction platoon of 20, routinely
supplied with local labour.  They used to have a small artigrav
air arm, but lost that in the opening actions of a battle seven year\'s ago.
Air support is now provided by the three merc jumpships (_Woe_,
_Lamentations_, and _Disaster_).  Armed with laser\'s and anti-ship
missiles, they do a less-than-desirable job of ortillery, but they do
manage.
Their equipment level is typically TL 13, but the starship\'s are at TL 12.
They can be rated as three-quarter\'s veteran, one-quarter regular.

Their greatest claim to fame is their destruction of Parsel\'s Panzer\'s,
a TL 13 armoured calvary unit that had successfully repulsed
two previous attack\'s.  Also, they helped to protect a TL 11 system
government for four long, bitter year\'s, suppressing a nasty local
insurgency.

The leader of Sammy\'s Army is Samuel Noonan, a large, powerfully
built man of mixed Solomani-Genoee ancestory, with an ego twice
as big as life.  Noonan is a very capable ground commander, and
isn\'t shy in letting you know about it.  On the financial side, he\'s a good
negotiator, letting his naturally bellicose personality do most of the work,
and knowing when to tune it down when it\'s time to rope the money in.
Sammy cares about his men, but only as a workman takes care of his tools, as
a mean\'s to an end.  And that end is fighting: the Chief really does
love the smell of cordite in the morning, and never feel\'s as alive as
he does in a middle of a firefight.

Situation:

Gammite Corp has a problem, and they want Sammy to solve it.
There has been several hit-and-run incident\'s at their masssive
Sarodandto facility, located on a TL D world, population in the
1-20 million range.  The local government and has beefed
up security around Sarodandto, and is building light fortification\'s
around the site.  But Gammite prefer\'s to be
pro-active, and they believe that they have located the armed camp
where the attacker\'s are based at.

It\'s in a polar region, completely wihtout sunlight and icy cold, so heat
suit\'s and special equipment preparation is called for.  Also, there
are some anti-space emplacement\'s: the corp sent two low-orbit
satilites over the region, and both were shot down from the ground.
It\'s currently winter, and the region will remain in pitch darkenss for four
Imperial month\'s yet.

The local government is in contact with the base: the base claim\'s that
they have no dispute with the local government,  but only with Gammite
Corp.  The local population has no desire to get involved in an off-world
dispute, and the government feel\'s that it\'s
already doing enough by protecting Sarodandto.  They want to encourage
talks between Gammite and the attacker\'s, but Gammite isn\'t interested in
talk.

What images the satilites provided is of a tiny base, of no more than
200 people, and the equivelant of two small ship laser batteries.
Radiation and neutron emission\'s suggest a TL of at least 13, with
TL 14-15ish more likely.  At least part of the base is underground, and
there is
a meson communication facility, set for interplanetary ranges.
No vehicle garages are seen.

Sammy Noonan is confident that the Black Fist can handle this.  He has
fought against superiour-tech opponent\'s before, and won - there is nothing
magical about technological superiority, and assumption\'s that the
enemy makes about your supposed inferiority can be made to cost
him dearly.  A bit of laser ortillery to soften the ground, an unexpected
landing in the current  winter season (ie no daylight, and really frigid
weather), killer artillery strikes using the starship\'s as observer,
harrassment
fire, coupled with faked emission\'s and "failed attack\'s"  to draw out the
defender\'s to the killing zones - properly planned, and with just some
cheap, second-hand TL 15 electronic decoy\'s and faker\'s, this could
play out very nice.

Referee\'s Section:

The referee should give careful thought regarding the defender\'s.
They don\'t have grav tank\'s or a starship at their disposal - but they
do have one or two hidden missile bay\'s, 50 miles from the base, and several
beam pointer\'s in a variety of sites, as well as around a dozen
grav vehicles, including a few armoured grav APC\'s, complete with fusion
gun.

The  base itself does not exist as a supply & training point at all - it\'s
a ship trap, to lure merc\'s to a ground landing, so the ship\'s
transporting them can be crippled, and unable to make lift-off - if not
actually blown to scrap.   If the ship\'s are successfully destroyed or
crippled,
the defender\'s will kill who they can catch, then leave, destroying their
base and it\'s food stores: they have succeded in their mission, and
Sammy\'s Army is temporarily marooned.  If they have no heat, they will die.

The leader\'s of the base know that there are only two or three mercenary
group\'s
Gammite Corp deal\'s with - and the most likely one to be used against
the base is Sammy\'s Army.  They have a fair understanding on how Sammy
Noolan work\'s (rumour, stories, mercenary news articles, etc),  and have
planned
accordingly.

Yes, Sammy, there *is* something out there that can whup you.  Hard.

Sammy is a smart, fast-acting ground commander: he may yet pull
a victory from defeat.  It\'s more likely though, that he will struggle to
capture
the base, suffering expensive lossed (men and equipment) only to see an
unexpected relief force snatch the defender\'s away.  The attack\'s on the
Sarodandto facility continue, and - with Sammy\'s Army
repositioned to help in the defence of Sarodandto - Gammite will begin
negotiation\'s with the attacker\'s.

If Sammy\'s Army surrender\'s, it will be accepted:
The Army keep\'s their lives in the cold and the dark, but lose their
equipment as part of the term\'s of surrender (how much of their
equipment depend\'s on negotiation\'s.)

If the ship\'s are crippled, but still capable of lift-off, there will be a
struggle
over ownership of the base.  The personnel on the base have limited
counter-battery fire (four light laser turrent\'s): there is also
a few mortar\'s available.  They will fight hard and well (they are half
veteran,
half elite).  If they believe there\'s a reasonable chance of victory,
they will fight on, even to the last man.

If the local base is nearing defeat , their main base, over 200 km distant,
will
send grav transport to retrieve personnel from the local base,
it is not tasked to engage Sammy\'s Army, unless necessary: the
main goal is to pick up the base\'s people.  If this fail\'s, the base will
surrender.  The main base is very well hidden,consisting of over 2,000
men on craggy highlands: the "mountain\'s" are actually made of ice.
Sammy\'s Army could take the place, but it\'s unlikely: the defender\'s here
are just as professional as at the smaller base, and will use their TL15
equipment, the highland\'s, and their numerous grav vechiles to good
effect.

However, the power\'s behind the base don\'t want a fight to the finish:
the cost in good men and equipment needed to defeat Sammy\'s Army
is greater than they are willing to pay, and they would be quite aware of
the
Chief\'s unexpected victory at the smaller base.  Here, it\'s more likely that
the base will negotiate with Sammy or the world\'s government, and arrange a
peaceful pullout.  The attack\'s on the Sarodandto facility will end, and
Sammy\'s Army pull\'s off a remarkable victory, and get\'s a nice bonus, too!

Aside\'s

Note: Sammy\'s Army is very loose when it comes to rank.  There is no
formal ranking system, but there is an unoffical division of Chief (Noonan),
Officer (commander\'s) and Men (everyone else).  The uniform code is
also rather light, mainly consisting of a black silk scarf and a unit patch
of
a black fist on a black circle, with both fist and circle outlined in gold
(riflemen,
artillery, and the Chief) or silver (everyone else).

If you place Sammy\'s Army in the Spinward Marches, over a third of the
men are actually Vargr: Sammy Noonan has charisma and confidence
to spare.

If you want to make the mission more easier - and give the player\'s a real
chance
of victory - you can lower the Tech Level of the defender\'s, or eliminate
the
main base.  If you want to give a really goood wupping, increase the
level of anti-ship fire, and give the defender\'s some small meson artillery
pieces.
Also, provide the main base with 4 or so fighter/bomber\'s.   And pity your
player\'s,
especially when they realise that the Cold is coming on, there\'s nothing
to eat, and they had better learn to navigate by the star\'s very quickly,
as that\'s all they can see.

I have deliberately been vague on which organization Sammy\'s Army is
fighting
against, or if the defender\'s are corporate, national troop\'s or part of a
noble household.  They are definitely professional, working against Gammite
Corp
on this world, and well-funded.  They are not Imperial - if they were,
Sammy\'s Army
would probably have to flee the Imperium - quickly - for daring to challange
Imperial authority.

There has been some discussion on the TML recently about structural
strength of various design options. I present below an extremely simplified
discussion of self-loading of structures. Many people find this topic
difficult because in order to get any useful results you need to know the
structure size and construction and the material strengths and sizes. All
these values effect the relationships so no \'base case\' exists.

The diagrams below use arbitrary size units and structure units. The
relation of size to structure is abstract and represent no real world case.
They are presented simply to demonstrate principle, not application.

Structure at the point of application of the main thrust supports its own
weight (mass * thrust) _and_ the weight of all structure \'beyond\' it. Thus
the most massive structure is found at the point of application of the main
thrust.

If you wish to scale up a design, the new section should be added at and
sized for the point of application of the main thrust. For example, in the
design of buildings, additional floors are added at the base and sized to
support all the existing floors.

Of course, contra-gravity and inertial compensation render all of this
irrelevant. They apparently cancel accelerating forces, so structures can
be built to any size without concern for self-loading. This in turn
suggests that thruster plates act upon space outside the ship, which brings
up a whole other group of considerations which i might address in a future
post.

A spaceship intended to land on planets which has decks oriented parallel
to its main thrust axis must be designed to receive main thrust on two
distinct axis 90 degrees from each other: the ship\'s drive in space and
gravity on planet. This is certainly doable and needn\'t even require large
amounts of additional structure in particularly clever designs where
structural requirements are allowed to dictate form.

A spaceship intended to land on planets which has decks oriented
perpendicular to its main thrust axis must allow for points of application
for the landing gear (if it lands on ground, not water). This restricts it
more towards the 56 structure layout in the parallel diagrams than the 32
structure layout.

Spaceships which land on planets have more stringent structural
requirements than those which never leave microgravity. Therefore, a
distinct separation of function is likely.

Sorry, but movies are *not* a good source for technical details. That\'s
the *last* thing on the mind of the producer and director. They want
"looks neat" even if it\'s phsyically impossible.

Sorry, but if you are using *movies* as your standard, you prefer

  Quite true, and this is already reflected in CT: High Guard, as a custom
200-ton Trader hull can vary in price by as much as MCr 14 before architects
fees and truly dubious design practices - which tend to favour non-streamlined
hulls to begin with.

  What owner wouldn\'t want the same cargo haulage ability (if not quite
the same performance profile) with a financing schedule based on a savings
of around MCr 10?

  Here\'s a question - apparently hunter-gatherer humans divided food-
gathering responsibilities along the lines of "males go hunt, females
gather nuts, berries, and cook". We can assume that the Ancients (esp.
given the Droynes own funky gender divisions) didn\'t give much of a damn
beyond mere functionality as to which humans did what.

  So, who among the Vilani did the Ancients mostly instruct in the
arts of food-preparation?

WOW! Did I inspire this. I\'ve got to do this more often then. To answer
your questions, and add some comments:

        No. No. Uncertain at this time but expecting grandfather status
in due time.

        The onset of this, as you know, was the comment that I read as
allowing TAS to classify any world as Red Zone even if it was at the
whim of the Imperium or some other Megacorporation who -probably- would
have -paid- for the -service-. I disagreed and still do that this would
be allowed under TAS except as further defined by Eris. Eris, of course,
responded to my comments and as it turned out, we were pretty much in
agreement when all was said and done. I did read and discard your
previous like comment. I find it hard to really believe that you were
truly -stunned- by the words, however, as I think your adventure story
has much merit, may I ask for the privilage of using your copyright
adventure IMTW. I know some players who would fill the bill of Sammy and
who already have the ego to go along with it.

[snipped a great adventure idea, but saved for the Library, thanks.]

All the best,

Actually, the way copyright works most places, you are violating as
soon as you distribute the material to *anyone*. But on the other hand,
you can get a lot done without violating the author\'s copyright, at
least in this case.

One thing that might be interesting would be to contact the folks
involved in the various "designed & shared" world projects of the last
30 years. If we could get permission to use the worlds (fairly likely
in most cases) we\'d be able to publish some world supplements with
incredible amounts of detail. Not just physical detail, but cultural
and ecological as well.

Then we have prominent fictional planets:

Trenco (E.E. Smith\'s "Lensman" series)
	Nasty weather, a sensor op\'s nightmare, nasty animals/planets,
	and a great "drug drug" (thionite).

Nifleheim (H.Beam Piper\'s "Uller Uprising")
	Fluorine atmosphere
	
Uller (H.Beam Piper\'s "Uller Uprising")
	Nasty seasons (90 degree axial tilt!) silicon and silicone
	based life. Interesting natives.

??? (H.Beam Piper\'s "Four Day Planet")
	Planet has a 365 earth day year. Said year is *four* local
	days. Has interesting animals, including an interesting export
	("tallow-wax")

??? (Piper & Kurland, I forget the title)
	Two earthlike planets, orbiting around a common center.
	Interesting native races. And an "arms race".

Mesklin (Hal Clement, "Mission of Gravity")
	*very* large non-gas giant. With an *extreme* rotation rate.
	Local "day" is 17.8 *minutes* (planet is *seriously* oblate).
	Equatorial gravity is 3 g, polar gravity is 800+. Atmosphere is
	hydrogen & methane. I forget whether the oceans are methane or
	ammonia.  Natives are interesting.

Dhawrn (Hal Clement, "Star Light")
	Large planet, surface gravity 40(?) g, lots of ammonia *and*
	water, with temperatures such that most of the possible ammonia
	water combos happen. *Weird* weather and "hydrosphere" effects.
	Being explored by Meslkinites with help from humans.

???? (Hal Clement, "Cycle of Fire")
	Planet orbiting in a double star system. Has *two* native
	races, which take "turns" running the planet when the climate
	is right for them ("hot" season natives take refuge in caves in
	geothermal area, "cold" season natives take refuge in polar ice)

???? (Hal Clement, "Iceworld")
	We don\'t see much of the planet, as the story has a native of
	it visting Earth (the "iceworld" in the title). The planet has
	an atmosphere of *gaseous* sulfur!

There are a couple more planets from Clement\'s stories that I just
can\'t recall enough info about.

"Mars" (Heinlein, "Red Planet", "Stranger in a Strange Land")
	Atmosphere is thin but breathable with personal compressors.
	Icecaps, canals, Martians with "psi" powers.

"Venus" (Heinlein, "Space Cadet")
	Typical hot, swampy Venus from before the probes. Natives are
	amphibious, civilized, more civilized ones have excellent
	mastery of chemistry, but a bit vague on physics.

"Venus" (Heinlein, "Between Planets")
	Another wet, swampy Venus, this one with Dragon-like natives,
	highly skilled in the sciences.

"Venus" (Ray Bradury, various stories)
	Rains *endlessly*. (read the storiesd for some of the effects
	of this, especially *mental* ones!)

"Mercury" (Erik van Lihn, "Battle on Mercury")
	This is the old version of Mercury with one face always towards
	the sun, the other always away from it. Dayside has lakes of
	lead and other metals, colonies are in the "twilight zone". I
	picked the van Lihn story from the many set on such a Mercury
	because he has an interesting native lifeform (based on
	electrical energy). BTW, the colonies use fission reactors
	because fissionables are readily available locally!

Sticking these planets that we *used* to think were in our solar system
into other star systems gives us a chance to recycle some excellent SF
speculation.

Well, strictly speaking, the Imperium isn\'t "legally" obligated to do much
for its citizens, other than prevent their enslavement.  They are legally
obligated by treaty with member worlds.

On this subject, I\'d quote what Edward de Vere, err, I mean, Shakespeare,

In the Real World, a friendly agent runs a line of contacts, usually from
the safety of the embassy under the cover of 3rd assitant economic attache\'.

Sources are handled with a variety of methods.. sex, money, revenge, moral
outrage; all can be used to get someone to betray their secrets.  The
advantage of this is that the actually spy is a citizen of the target
country, the worst the target can do is expel the handler, and another will
slip in within weeks.

You\'ve never read any Discworld books? Boy, you\'re lucky! You\'ve got all

I just got back from Dragoncon today.  Loren Wiseman was there, and said
that one of the things he made sure to do was get good artists.  He said
that Rob Caswell is one of the artists for G:T.  He also said in the panel
on Traveller at SJG, that he felt his biggest contribution to Traveller was
hiring Bill Keith in the early 80\'s.

They were hoping to get G:T in at the con, but the covers weren\'t dry
enough to be bound in time, but they had a copy of the book and Saturday
got some of the covers.  Picture the little black box cover, all grown up.

There is one canon example of this from the Traveller Adventure; Tukera has
had their family estate on Lewis in the Aramis Subsector placed under
Imperial Interdiction, thereby classifying it as a Red Zone.  It seems
that, when Tukera was down on its luck, it sold off a bit of Lewis for
colonization.  When times improved the colonists were asked to leave and
refused.  Now the Megacorp is attempting to "starve" them out by
inderticting all off world trade.  The colony lives on, however.

Of course, the Tukera family has a special exemption to the interdiction
and can come and go as they please.

A Couple of nits.

"Leg Infantry" seems to imply that these soldiers walk to the battlefield.
Have they no vehicles at all?  If they do, they are either mechanized,
airmobile, or lift infantry.  I\'d bet that there haven\'t been any regular
"leg infantry" units in existance since WWII, aside from those in the
Starship Troopers movie (and they should have been "Mobile Infantry" if
they\'d done the armor right).

A "howitzer" is a medium velocity indirect fire projectile weapon.  There
may be some discussion of using the term generically for light artillery,
but I would say that you want to call the meson weapons "meson artillery"
and the lasers "vehicle mounted lasers" or "antivehicle lasers" rather than
"howitzers" or even "artillery".

Artillery acts in a support role for which lasers are not precisely suited.
Lasers can\'t do indirect fire you see.  Meson weapons don\'t technically do
indirect fire either, but their ability to shoot *through* intervening
matter replaces this drawback quite efficiently.

It would make perfect sense for the lasers to be "air defense battery" for
the artillery company, or perhaps the battalion\'s "Tank Destroyer" section
if there really are no other heavy weapons in the unit.

By the way, have recent rules made "meson artillery" than can be called
"light"?  Striker (I) had a meson artillery piece that cost in Mcr and
destroyed everything in a certain area up to 1000km away or so.  hardly
light.  I thought other versions followed that example.

Otherwise, and anyway, a nice piece of work.

Unfortunately, I do not own a copy of the Traveller Adventure, darn it. 

Be that as it may, and in spite of the fact that that is still current
practice in a lot of places on current Terra, IMV it does not make it
right nor should it in game terms.

If in fact that is the practice and the -rule- then what I inferred
about the -value- of the TAS zoning would still stand. It may or may not
be true. Therefore an extremely adventurous individual or group might
take it upon themselves to investigate, just to make sure. If it brings
up 40 gazillion Imperial Battlecruisers then it was nice knowing you. If
it is not then he/she/they may just find something useful and of great
value, like in the adventure above.

I also read your other response to AP and agree, especially your last
line.

1985, by GDW - 49 pages long and quite a good book. And no, it isn\'t the
Traveller Adventure...

Loren got us some photocopies of the rulebook proofs for use at the demos
BITS ran at GenCon UK 98. It looked excellent, and the advertising posters
were very CT ish. We didn\'t see the cover though...

The UPP conversion rules are there, as were rules for converting from
previous editions. I am really looking forward to seeing this. The referee
(Richard Mawhinney) who read the book and converted the generic GURPS stuff
he\'d written in less than a day and a half was very impressed, and said
there were interesting sections on why Traveller had been written the way
it was.

We were quite shocked seeing a well put together, professionally
illustrated Traveller book after seeing the stuff IG put out.... we could
have sold a large number of copies too, if we had them.

"Inversions" is the fifth - albeit disguised - Culture novel. Order wise,
"Excession" follows "Consider Phlebas".

There are a few good sites on Banks - some you can get to off my website
(sorry, feeling too lazy to check the URL).

Note that I don\'t intend this as a replacement or competitor to the

afficianados to find the plans that make the starships real.

I guess by "leg" I imagine a unit with a TO&E that does not have enough of
its own vehicles - be they HMMWVs, 3/4 ton trucks, helicopters,
motorcycles, or school busses - to transport its combat personnel.

The U.S. 10th Mountain Division, while specially trained in operations in
rough terrain and/or in winter conditions where foot is sometimes the only
option, still has transport to get it to the mountains and hence is not
"leg" infantry according to my interpretation.  I wouldn\'t necessarily call
it "mechanized" either though.

I think that the red zoning Lewis may also have something to do with 
their acting as a pirate haven. To quote from the AHL rules booklet: 
"Arriving at Lewis/Aramis in 1090, the Loathsome Reverie was responding 
to an appeal by the Duke of Regina from several shipping lines [but 
perhaps not Tukera, pure coincidence of course] that their trade was 
being raided by pirates under the guise of trade regulation and tariffs. 
Once there, however, the locals proved quite polite and proper, welcoming 
the ship and its crew to their small world and isolated cities."
There ensues a boarding attempt  while the pirates attempt to take out 
the cruiser\'s powerplant.

The above certainly implies a naval interdiction, which Tukera may be 
able to  work their way around using their considerable Imperial 
connections.

25th Infantry Division (Light), Schofield Barracks, HI
7th Infantry Division (Light), Ft. Lewis, WA
10th Infantry Division (Mountain), Ft. Drumm, NY
82nd Airborne Division, Ft. Bragg, NC
2nd Infantry Divison, Republic of Korea

These units represent half of the infantry strength of the United States
Army.  The two light IDs have no rganic armor or artillery, and very few
vehicles of any kind.  The 82nd has artillery, but just decommisioned it\'s
single armor battalion.

Soviet Class III divisions were more tan 75% leg-mobile, some even still
had horse drawn wagons!  Every (smart) army maintains leg forces, simply
because they are light, tend to be well-versed in the infantry arts (not
having to waste all that time working in the motor pool on the %@#!!
tracks), and cheap to equip.

	There are a number of things I would fight for if I had to.  Fighting in
that context implies the possibility of death (to me.)   The number of
things I would fight for knowing in advance I will die is much smaller.  I
think most people if they are honest would be willing to fight & die for
their immediate family.  For me he latter category would include family, a
few very close friends, and my country if I thought the fight was right.

According the Army, a leg division is one that lacks suffcient armored
vehicles for transporting it\'s own strength.  Even the venerable M-113A2
offers a good amount of protection for troops.

Also, a mech division will have a large number of tanks, almost as many as
an armored division.

The bottom line is that leg units are dependant on higher commands for any
in-theater transportation.

This show\'s the limit\'s of family power and the incredible cheapness of
the Tukera line.  No, the Tukera family - despite being among the wealthest
sentinent\'s in history - can\'t simply arrange for the colony to be killed off,
or even hire a mercenary crew to grab everyone and hustle them on transport\'s
for the nearest low-pop world. ["A deal IS a deal!"]  On the other hand, I\'m
sure that the local\'s would leave if Tukera waved a few MCr under noses,
which they refuse to do.  Even a simple guarantee of lifetime employment
at a comfortable yearly rate would be enough to get nearly everyone packing.

The Tukera\'s are willing to write off trillion\'s of credit\'s per year on bad loan\'s,

amazing is the fact that the Imperium is willing to spend at least ten\'s of
MCr every year to succur Tukera\'s wounded pride - I hope the subsector
Duchess extracted some JUICY compensation for this "small favour".

Ever wondered just how much stuff get\'s tossed out of the airlock, usually
just before the system police/naval inspection cutter comes along?
Or the junk naval ship\'s are alway\'s shedding?  Or the heaving, ancient
starship\'s that give up the ghost in the Back of Beyond?

Well, that\'s a lot of stuff! I\'m wondering if there isn\'t a good market for
scavenger\'s in the Traveller universe.  Certainly some kind of living could
be made from the thousand year\'s of junk orbiting Capital/Core/Core, or
any high-pop class A starport for that matter.

(Never mind the interesting machinery hanging around Naval bases...)

I\'ll limit my response to the various branches of humaniti....

IIRC, the Solomani have always been fans of the honkin\' big spinal
mount, which helped during the Interstellar Wars (especially once they
introduced the meson gun).  OTOH, the Vilani were (at the time of the
Interstellar Wars) fond of impressive missile armaments.  (BTW, my own
[Milieu 1100] designs betray my Solomani origins, with impressive spinal
particle accelerator mounts being nearly signature items....)  ;-)

3d Imperium designs are fairly balanced, reflecting their joint
Solomani-Vilani heritage.  Spinal mounts still seem to dominate,
however.

The only Zhodani designs I\'ve seen have been from Milieu 1100, which
cannot be considered as "pure" Zhodani ships, since, like the Vilani
"attack cruiser", Zhodani ships of this era likely display some features
of their foes\' vessels.  It would be interesting to speculate about what
a "pure" Zhodani design would feature....

Not according to Traveller Adventure.  Tukera\'s got a standing offer to buy 
out *ANY* place on Lewis, just about *NAME* your price.  The colonials *ain\'t* 
selling for love nor money.  They consider Lewis their *HOME* and no punk 
aristo is gonna put them off *their* land.

And just killing them off with mercs or whatever is out too.  The Imperium 
takes a dim view on genocide unless *THEY\'RE* doing the killing.

Doesn\'t matter how much you offer, the Lewis colonists ain\'t selling.

support interplanetary travel at TL 8 without fusion rockets, so here\'s the 
challange. There is a mining colony on a Jovian moon which needs a freighter

The specifications:

Distance from main system to gas giant = 600,000,000 km (a lttile less than 
Earth to Jupiter when in conjuction)

Allowable technology = TL 8 with the exception of no fusion rockets (note Low 
berths are TL 9).

Round trip time = 2 years (the ship may be refueled at the mining colony, 
external fuel tanks [armour - 10] may be used, but fresh tanks are not available 
at the colony ie no drop tanks). Fresh fission cores are available at the colony.

Payload = 20 passengers and 20 Td of cargo.

Budget = MCr 3,000 per ship

Attention must be paid to physical and psychological health of passengers and 
crew. (extended periods in zero-g and confinement). The ship is only required 
to travel from orbit to orbit. The ship is required to carry ore on the inward leg 
and supplies on the outward leg (ie cargo bay is always full).

I will be very interested to see what people come up with. I\'ll be seeing what I 
can produce. To achieve the trip time, you need to aim for a final velocity of 
around 15-18km/s. Then when this has been done, we could try and figure out 
what would be so darn valuable that you could afford to pay your workforce to 
do nothing for 2 years :*>

The 10th Mountain Division (Light) (NY and AK) and 25th Infantry Division
(Light) (HI and WA) are both currently in service.  2d ID is more heavily
mechanized now, but still includes light infantry elements due to the
terrain in Korea. (7th ID(L) stood down, Doug - the Manchus at Ft. Lewis
are part of 25th ID(L)).

Argueably, the 82d Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air
Assault) are both "leg infantry" once delivered to the battlefield - I
didn\'t see the beginning of this thread to know whether this is relevant.

And don\'t forget the (2+) USMC divisions, which are still only partially
mechanized (by design).

Out of about 13 division-equivalents in the US forces, at least 6 are
"light", primarily foot-mobile infantry.

The term you\'re looking for (as opposed to "leg") is "motorized".

In this you are incorrect.  10th Mountain Division does not have sufficient
organic capacity to move even one brigade at a time, which hardly qualifies
it as "motorized".  It is "leg" infantry by design:  

There are no vehicles at the company level. Most of the (24 or so?  I don\'t
have the TO&E here) vehicles at the battalion level are specialized, like
the 4 TOW-carriers in the anti-tank platoon. At the division level, there
are two UH-60 companies (enough to lift two companies of infantry, if
they\'re all working) and a motor transport company in the DISCOM (which
primarily moves supplies, not personnel).  The DIVARTY has 5-ton trucks for
towing their howitzers, but again not for moving infantry.

Vehicles to move the 10th Mountain (or the 25th ID(L)) have to come from Corps.

I\'ve just rechecked my figures. I\'m slightly wrong. The final velocity is a fraction

Yep, that\'s it!

BTW, there is at least one other story set in the same sort of setup
(this one by Blish), and I suspect that either it was Campbell handing
out story ideas he\'d like to see developed, or some other sort "hand
several authors the same background and see what happens" scenario.

Well, this seems to require a spin hab for the passengers.  I also suspect some sort
of biopod would be necessary.  This biopod could be detatched at the destination to
help start the colony.  It would then be replaced with ore for the trip back.

Well, for the first year, people can be training for life at their destination.
Likewise, maintaining a biopod requires some work.  People could still
telecommute.

Ignoring gravity and assuming a zero velocity at both ends (this is a big assumption
and probably false), you need about 0.00248 m/s/s acceleration.  At TL 8, there are
three options: Rockets which fling the ship at the gas giant but cannot be refueled
there. Ion drives which slowly accelerate you to the gas giant and can be refueled
there.  Solar sails which VERY slowly get you there with no fuel problems.

A rocket has a nice boost, but it is really short duration and is unlikely to get you
there in a year as most of the time you\'re coasting.  Once you get there, there\'s no
reliable means of refueling.  I suppose they could use hydrogen fuel but I think the
thrust/mass ratio will be a problem.  I\'ll leave this to others to calculate.

Including fuel for the trip and a fission plant to power it, Ion drives cannot produce
the needed acceleration.  The engines and fuel would take up 102% of the ship\'s mass.
If you toy with the end vectors like allowing the ship to low orbit the gas giant at
high speed and give it a booster at each end, a very small payload could be managed.
Also, if the time allotment was increased, it might be possible.

A solar sail can only manage 0.001 m/s/s acceleration in the habital zone.  Much less
as you move out from the sun.  Thus solar sails can\'t manage the trip in the one year
time alotment.

Note that a regenerative bioplex requires about 20 Td per person.  You\'d need this to

For starters, you\'d have to test them in a home facility (like on the moon) for a year
to see if they can take it. If you use a spin hab, you can slowly adjust the rotation
to acclimate the subjects to their new home gravity.

How fast can the ship be travelling at the gas giant end of the trip?

It seems to me that this is a technological impossibility at TL 8.  How many years did
it take for voyager to reach Jupiter?  Close to 2 years and neither Voyager had to
slow down nor make provisions for life support.

The very existence of MegaCorps implies that there is some crossover in
the consumer tastes of different star systems. Also, the idea of having an
interstellar government involves a certain degree of shared culture. I
have always assumed that this applied to entertainment as well. Some
celebrities on Earth make the leap to become international stars, even if
their films might not make it to the foreign markets immediately.
Similarly, some celebrities would make the transition in Traveller to
become interstellar names, even if their holovids take weeks or months to
reach the far away systems.

In the sense of other kinds of celebrity, canon says there are at least
some: the Royalty!

Continuing my investigation...
If your end velocity is about 1.336 km/s this will give you an orbit about 100 km above
Jupiter.  This will kick you around the other side for your return trip in about 46
hours.  Hopefully that\'s enough time to dump your passengers and grab your cargo.  If not,
four days later you\'ve got another window.  I\'m not sure what the magnetic fields or
radiation will do to everyone, but at that distance, collecting ionizates/hydrogen
shouldn\'t be too difficult.

A similar trick can be done Earthside.  Booster rockets can be used to get the ship going
with a nice initial velocity.  These boosters can be recollected and used to catch the
lower mass (no fuel) ship on the return like a catcher\'s mitt.

Converting the moon into a giant mass driver could do a similar  trick.  The magnetic
coils could accelerate the ship to Jupiter while decelerating it on the return.  Of course
you don\'t want to miss...  For that matter, continuous use of the moon could cause it to
destabilize and fall out of orbit.

Is this all basic -canon- or only your view of what is probable?
Although most everyone would welcome a guaranteed lifetime employment
eespecially at a comfortable annual income, I\'m not sure that nearly
everyone would jump to the piper. Now I could allow that those of
Lewis/Aramis might do so   IF   they were all pirates (the buyout would
probably be better than they could hope to attain over their lifetime),
but that is not what AHL indicated as the Commander of Loathesome
Reverie only sought out and destroyed the actual pirate base. It would
seem that the balance of the world\'s population are/were quite content
to stay where they were and could not be bought off at any price.

Yes. And that would be something TNS would report on with fair
regularity IMO, overdue/lost ships with details, reports of
sightings/findings, world chastisement/initiatives to clean up debris in
and around starports causing hazards to the travelling/shipping cliental
. Anyone know of any (new) such items that have not made the news
lately, especially spinward of the Marches a sector or two or three?

	Dulinor the Black, accompanied by his entourage, ascended the stage of the
Yankermon Sportsplex to the cheers of a massed audience of over fifteen
thousand screaming supporters.  Sporting his customary tousled hairstyle, and
clad in his ceremonial toga, Strephon\'s assassin hailed the crowd as strains
of "The Clarion," the Ilelish Federation anthem, thundered throughout the
darkened arena.  As he coolly surveyed the massed thousands below, the would-
be Emperor has but one question to pose to his loyal followers arrayed below:
"YANKERMON, ARE YOU READY TO RAVE?!"
	No, it\'s not a nightmare returned from a dark and discredited era, it\'s
Fija\'s newest pop sensation: Dulinor the Black and the Stormtroopers of
Ilelish.  Known mainly for it\'s frontman, Dulinor the Black (the former Ned
Whiskus, who bears and uncanny resemblance to the former Imperial leader), the
band claims preeminence as the leader of a new Fijan musical movement known as
"Rave."
	Rave, which centers on the unusual, the iconoclastic, and the outrageous,
appears to have taken over Fijan youth culture almost overnight.  "It\'s as if
something was just waiting about in and embryonic stage," declared Dr. D.D.
Demented, a prominent music critic and commentator of the Fijan cultural
scene, "Poof! Just add water, and there it was."
	If the ultimate aim of Rave is to shock, then last night\'s performance
certainly achieved it.  The set, which lasted approximately 90 minutes
alternated between blasts of cacophonic music punctuated by chants from
Dulinor of "Crash Lucan!" and "I did it for the Good of all Humanity!," and an
elaborate tableau acted out by Dulinor and his bandmates.  Giant screens
placed strategically about the auditorium broadcast cleverly edited speeches
by the real Dulinor, which often drowned out the ranting coming from the
stage.  Sound limits sampled from inside the building exceeded safety limits
for human hearing at least twice, prompting Enos Weatherby, leader of the
Parents\' League for Fijan Decency to denounce the event as a, "dastardly sonic
attack on our vulnerable youth!"
	One concert-goer, interviewed after the event, summed up the music in this
way; "It\'s a bit bland, but its got a good beat, and you can dance to it."

I wrote this awhile back:

As far as making alien ships alien in concept, i\'d see there\'s two general
categories of ship design.  These would center on the offensive-defensive
balance rather than new and different technologies and on specialization vs
generalized multi-purpose ships. 
   I\'d see the philosophy of the 3I (due to Vilani influences) to be a 50/50
offensive-defensive oriented balance.  I see the Solomani (and Vargr) to have
offensive capabilities at the cost of defensive, though there\'d be notable
exceptions for the Solomani (dedicated PD craft... ala AEGIS cruisers,etc).
Defensive heavy designs would be amongst the Hivers.

- - The Solomani decidedly offensive oriented. Heavy on firepower, remainder
averaged on armor and screens and light on point defense (though there would
be dedicated ships along the lines of Aegis cruisers, etc).  There would be
many specialized attack and defensive roles as well as some ships with very
short legs (heavily dependant on logistics and auxillaries).

After running some calculations...
If you build a mass driver out of the moon and tunnel straight through (I suppose you could
have a surface mounted driver) you can accelerate at 3 G\'s (30 m/s/s)  for 8 minutes before
leaving the far side of the moon.  I selected 3 G\'s from a human tolerance standpoint.  At TL
8, G tanks are available.  1 G for normal tolerance + 1 G for workstation + 1 G for G tanks =
3 G\'s or about 30 m/s/s. This gives you an initial velocity of 14400 m/s.  Combined with the
slingshot around Jupiter, your effective distance for acceleration calculations is nearly cut
in half.  The resulting minimum acceleration for the ship is then 0.000734447 m/s.  This puts
it well into the ion drive range with the drive section (drive, fuel, reactor) taking up
29.316% of the vehicle mass.

Assuming 20 tons per person for regenerating life support X 20 people (I\'ll subsume the cargo
into the RLS system) = 400 tons.  At 70% of the mass, the ship would be about 570 tons in
mass.  Roughly the same in volume. Thus, we should start with a 600 dT hull or thereabouts.

The launch/retrieval system might be somewhat more expensive :-)

We know the mass of the projectile/ship 600,000 kg
We know the Muzzle velocity: 14400 m/s (note this is technically illegal, at TL 8 max muzzle
velocity is 3000 m/s, but this isn\'t exactly a mass driver)
The required energy is: 0.0000005MV^2 x 4.5 (TL eff.) = 279.936 Mj [this might be off by a
factor of a million due to a typo]
The HPG is therefore: 34.992 kL for 0.34992 Mcr
Assuming one charge per year (launch one year, catch next year, etc.) a fission reactor would
need to be very small, but the minimum size is 10 KL thus 1 Mcr for the launch reactor.  It
could recharge the HPG\'s in half a minute 30 seconds.  We could replace this with a solar cell
if need be.
Tunneling through the moon would cost about 203,906 Mcr (a tad bit expensive and by far the
most expensive bit) producing a 3480 km long tunnel 25 m X 25 m.

Reducing the initial velocity to the legal 3000 m/s increases the drive ratio to about 43%.
Required mass would jump to about 800 tons but the launch tunnel gets reduced to 150 Km X 28 m
X 28 m for 11,025 Mcr.  Muzzle energy is greatly reduced as well.

As far as the ship goes, an 800 ton ship would require 350 kL of ion drive costing 4.55 Mcr.
The reactor would be 10.5 kL for 1.05 Mcr.

If we assume a budget for 10 ships, we\'ve got 30,000 Mcr to invest.  Half of that would get
invested into the launch tube.  leaving 1,500 Mcr for each ship.  With the drive section
costing just over 5 Mcr, that leaves a hefty chunk of change for the BIOPLEX section.

The point is that it is technologically impossible to do it from a standing start, but if you
can get a nice starting vector and maintain it at the far end, it becomes quite possible.
That should give everyone a nice starting point for designs (although I seem to have changed
the nature of the problem)

I\'ve always been told that mechanized infantry meant that they have APCs or
MICVs, whereas motorized infantry have trucks. Here in New Zealand the
infantry is lucky to be motorized on a good day, because even if the trucks
are avialible the ground is often vehicle proof.
This means you get to enjoy carrying 120+ lbs of gear over some of the most
scenic ground in the world, and it\'s not nearly so nice up close in the bush.

From memory of canonical material:

Vargr seem to like "spiky" designs - wings swept to a point,
needle and wedge hulls, and so on.

Aslan tend to use flowing designs, with few if any sharp angles.
Often, their ships look like clusters of bubbles; some humans
with no sense of appreciation of design have called them
"blobby".

K\'kree like large spaces, and tend not to divide where not
absolutely necessary - and even then, divisions are as minimal as
possible (i.e., if possible, they\'ll use a curtain instead of a
wall).  Most K\'kree ships are domes (half-spheres) with large
displacement (I don\'t think they have anything crewed as small as
100 dt).

I see the Solomani as having ships that are multi-role, but like Gary I
think that they\'d have a lot of very specialized defensive and offensive
ships. IMO overall a Solomani task force would be fairly balanced along the
offensive/defensive axis (depending on mission, of course).

I\'d have thought that the Vilani, with their strong specialization by guild
would tend to have quite specialized ships. It seems (to me) that this
would follow "the right man for the job" becomes "the right tool/ship for
the job". I\'m not talking about offensive/defensive specialization here,
but in terms of mission specialization.

Given that the crew won\'t be doing much during the launch you should be
able to run the acceleration rather higher than that. If the acceleration
was 5G the penalty would be (in TNE/FF&S1) a +2 Diff mod, unpleasant but
not intolerable, given that it would only be for 6m 15s. This would give an
initial velocity of 18800 m/s, a 30% increase.

I\'m glad to see somebody else is following this thread.  I did some further
research and found that appropriate seat inclination helped.  A 30 degree
incline added about 2 G\'s of tolerance without affecting visibility.  Inclining
to 80 degrees allowed up to 15 G\'s (that might have been a typo).  Of course
you could shoot the moon and let everyone pass out on the way out.  The crew
doesn\'t have much to do with the launch, they are afterall just a bullet at
that point.  The trick is keeping them awake during the "controlled crash" that
we\'re calling the landing.  Its bad enough that they\'re coming in backwards.

But the real limitation is the TL 15 Mass Driver Muzzle Velocity of 3000 m/s.
We can shorten the tunnel length by accelerating the ship faster, but we can\'t
get a better muzzle velocity.  So, a 10 G (100 m/s/s) mass driver would
accelerate for 30 seconds.  It\'s length would still be 45 km.  The whole thing
would be close to 3 Million displacement tons.

My current idea is floating a launch tube at a stable L point (if there is such
a thing).  What inertia is lost from the launching can be regained slowly as
the launch platform falls back into the L point. Some other advantages are
being able to fling other stuff around, like a weapon (shock and surprise).
But since you\'ve got to protect your ship from Jupiter\'s magnetic field, it
makes sense to use the magnets on this end.

Hiver\'s aren\'t really coward\'s: they are quite satisfied with naval warfare,
for example, and behave with courage in that circumstance.
They just cannot tolerate close-up, short-range fighting.
They could push a button to launch the missiles, but only a very special
(or stark raving mad) Hiver could point a pistol at a fellow HIver and
kill him.

Wow.  These folk are determined!  But why?  I\'m assuming that
there is no religious/political reason why they MUST stay, and
they do know the value of a credit.

Perhaps I should count "deep attachment to a particular chunk
of real estate" as a religious thing.  Moreover, a goodly large
number of war\'s - a solid majority, if I have my history right - is
indeed about real estate.

Understood as a battle for wealth, this is within comprehension:
but that\'s NOT the reason why the Lewis folk choose not to leave,
as they could have as much weath as they wish if they part with
the land.

Someone must introduce them to the Aslan.

Heh.  Pratically everything I say is only "what is probable".
There ain\'t no way I can obtain all the Traveller canon there is,
I don\'t have the real desire to do so, and even if I did, I\'d
fool with it to suit what *I* think is interesting/likely/unusual.

Still, having a canon is useful as it help\'s us communicate

My delta-V was still out. Its been pointed out to me that you\'d need to bump it 
up to around 25km/s to match orbits with Jupiter.

I\'ve assumed that the station at the Jupiter end can supply the neccessary fuel 
(either LHyd or HRF or noble gas) and a new fission core. However I like this 
solution. 46 hours should be enough to dro your load and pick up a new one, I 
don\'t think you could replace the fission core but thats not a huge problem.

I don\'t know if this is possible, but could you set the thing up to just loop 
endlessly in space? Just get it started, load and unload on its single orbit at 
both ends and keep "topping up" the velocity to deal with planetry mechanics 
and gravitational forces.

I\'d hate to see the price tag of that mass driver :*> However one should do for 
the whole solar system.

Well, let me clarify myself a bit... "Leg infrantry" as I used it meant that
the
merc\'s ground forces don\'t have sufficent organic capasity to transport
themselves to the battlefield, nor do they use armoured vehicles
in combat.  The merc ship\'s do have their starships, and ship\'s boat\'s,
to transport their men to and from their initial position - but the ship\'s
boat\'s can\'t transport the entire company at one run, and even Sammy
will put his starship\'s in harm\'s way only when he feel\'s that the odd\'s are
on *his* side.

Oftentimes, the folk\'s who are paying the merc\'s will provide
sufficent vehicles for transportation, usually civilian or cheap
military vehicles.

I agree: laser\'s simply are not indirect weapon\'s, and can\'t truthfully
be called artilelry.  Ortillery, on the other hand....

Yep, the laser\'s do have their uses.  As for vehicle-mounted heavy
weapon\'s...

Well, it depend\'s. My intent was to design a "typical" light company of
mercenaries for the usual jungle/training cadre/garrison
role.  The typical operational area in my mind was sub-saharan Africa,
which is definitely infrantry country.  Also, I want the merc\'s to be on the
cheap side: the fact that they have three jump-capable ship\'s with some
ortillery capasity should compensate for the lack of ground vehicle
transportation, in Sammy\'s mind.

Moreover, I wanted to keep the "tail" of Sammy\'s Army as short as possible:
tail and expensive equipment mean\'s expensive cost\'s, which impact\'s the
bottom line.  Cutting back on the rear echelon element - usually outsourced
to the employer of Sammy\'s Army - also gives the employer more bang for
the buck, and increases the "in-country" feel in a way that I like.

I bet you could come up with a situation where Sammy\'s Army can be made
to suffer for that oversight.  Hey, I did - remember, the ship trap in my
adventure
is designed to kill/cripple the ship\'s.  If successful, it would nail
Sammy\'s
major ortillery site, transportation, and home base all at one blow.
A decent, well-handled group of grav tanks\'s would also ruin Sammy\'s
whole day, but Sammy is smart enough to take on armour only on *his*
term\'s - he\'s arrogant, but definitely not stupid, and when he know\'s he
can\'t win, he\'ll retreat in good order [1].

But most of Sammy\'s opponent\'s aren\'t so wealthy as to afford
high-tech anti-ship weaponry or a company of grav tank\'s - complete
with major logistic tail, costly crew\'s and maintenance.  Coupled with the
fact
that most of Sammy\'s enemies are disadvantaged on wealth,
experience AND technology, and you can see how Sammy has turned
his unit into a daily source of bread and sustenance, enough to afford
three jumpship\'s, employ about 1000 people total, and still turn a regular
profit.

A greater threat is that the employer can cheat the merc\'s with poor
support, and increased dependence on the supply lines/local help.
If worst comes to worse, Sammy\'s Army will have to dig in and
hold position till the ship\'s come in, fighting on empty bellies and,
of far greater importance, a rapidly declining supply of ammo and fuel
which is NOT being replenished.

>By the way, have recent rules made "meson artillery" than can be called
>"light"?

Hasn\'t several folk designed meson "rifles"?  Of course, this depend\'s
on a liberal interpreation of the rules...

>Otherwise, and anyway, a nice piece of work.


I thank you for your kindness.

[1] According to the material I have read, retreating is among the most
difficult thing\'s to do in wartime.  A commander must have excellent
control - and probably above-average troops - to avoid having a planned
retreat turn into a headlong rout.  Among Sammy\'s "signatures" is the
use of retreat\'s to sucker the enemy to over-extending himself, then
*WHAP* his nose in before fading away again.

Second note: the very fact that Sammy can be said to have "signatures"
in his operation\'s show predictability, and is a sign of growing arrogance
that could be into a real liability in the field.  The main reason he has
been able to get away with it so far is that he rarely campagin\'s against
the same enemy twice, is still a quick study in the field, stick\'s to some
simple rules of thumb that has saved his command more than once
(ie "Avoid splitting your command", "Allway\'s keep a reserve", "Keep the
plan simple and flexible", etc.), and has the confidence of good men.

Ick... planetary mechanics... but the Earth and Jupiter are just supposed to sit there :-)
Actually, that may be helpful as you don\'t need to slow down as much at Jupiter.  Although
slingshotting back to Earth at that velocity would put you inside Jupiter. Then again, Jupiter\'s
gravity could help slow you down for the trip back. I guess there\'s a reason why its called
rocket scientist...

I keep running the numbers and I think I might have been off by a factor of 2 someplace (oops)
which cuts usable space way down, but I can\'t seem to find the error.

I\'ve been using a 360 day year for calculations which gives you some nice slop time if you need
a second pass.  Since you come into orbit, cargo won\'t just drop into Jupiter (unless you
miscalculate). The real trick is getting the reception vehicle to match up in time, location and
velocity when the ship arrives.  Any one of those could scrub the run.

I wonder if ships could be left in hot orbits around the Earth or perhaps one of the inner
planets.

Yep, very pricey.  I\'m working on paring it down somewhat.  The best initial velocity we can get
would be 3000 m/s plus Earth\'s vector (~20.1 km/s).  Jupiter\'s orbital velocity is about 13 km/s
and orbiting it at 100 km adds another 1.336 km/s.  Assuming best case scenario (unlikely) the
trip there would take about 13% drive section.  In fact, removing the mass driver and relying
strictly on planetary velocities puts the drive section at just over 14%... Hmm... back to the
books...

I don\'t think this is particularly true. GCNTR should be able to do it -

Many, many years ago, an amphibious military operation was planned against
the Turks in Albania. Don John of Austria, in charge of the operation,
recommmended they take saddles, bridles, tack and cash - they could buy
horses when they got there, and thus save on transporting them.

Similarly, it might be worth Sammy\'s mind to take a number of CG modules
and rely on being able to rig them up to appropriate local transport.

Grav tanks are pretty damn cheap in Traveller, at least at with FFS2 grav
plates.

I can easily imagine a TL7 grav tank, designed something like a helicopter
gunship but using contragrav rather than rotors.

Even if you include the cost of importing spare parts (20% of import cost
as per Striker), it is still a good deal.

Sammy\'s will need expensive electronics to deal with this (eg a Battallion
level Gravitic Sensor to allow proper deployment of the AT detatchment). He
should invest in a EW Company anyway, to allow jamming and spoofing of
enemy commo, and I *really* wouldnt go making war on lo-tech planets
without bringing my own hi-tech field hospital.

I must accept responsibility for The Solution, a 50 km range TL11
Battlefield Meson Gun. I also believe that Meson Guns should have a minimum
length of 100m at TL11, dropping by 20m per TL, which takes battlefield
meson guns up to TL15, where they belong.

	The Jannix are a race of insectoid creatures somewhat similar 
in appearance to the Terran Rhinocerous Beetle.  They average 2.5 
meters in height and 1.5 in width.  They have four major limbs, two 
small connector appendages in the upper third of the body and a pair 
of large cutting horns out the top of the shell.  Normal locomotion 
is accomplished on all fours although they are capable of standing on 
either set of limbs for extended periods.  A dense carapace covers 
the back and sides of the Jannix and the front is also protected, 
although to a lesser degree, by a chitin exoskeleton. The Jannix are 
colored from flat black to dark blue and deep purple, this seems to 
be influenced by the ambient temperature of the environment.

	The smaller connector appendages are usually attached to an 
organic weapon which fires chitin shells filled with acid/bile.  
These shells appear to be the Jannixs waste material and are highly 
toxic to humanoids.  Sometimes the Jannix are seen with other organic 
devices in place of these weapons, including computer interfaces and 
medical/repair devices, but these are very rare and the Jannix seem 
to go to great lengths to protect these.  There have been reports of 
flying Jannix, but it is more likely the creature\'s capability of 
jumping up to 30 meters high and 50 meters forward with the carapace 
spread out.

	The social structure of the Jannix is relatively unknown. 
Whenever they have been encountered in the wilds, there has been a 
vampire ship nearby.  It is believed somehow there exists a working 
relationship between the two.  This could be a dire threat to the 
Regency, but so far there have been no known incursions into our 
space.  The Jannix are unrelenting in the pursuit of their goals, 
whatever they may be.  A live specimen has never been taken for 
study.  Scientific perusal of dead ones has yielded some facts 
however.  Their blood is very acidic, to the point of damaging most 
container vessels.  They are capable of ingesting minerals but prefer 
organic materials.  They have internal organs capable of producing 
chemical physiological enhancers that can give them great strength 
and endurance for a short period.  They also have the ability to 
reproduce items of technology, converting the items inside the body 
and then expelling them.  This appears to be limited to small and 
uncomplex items, less than .2 cubic meters in volume and 5 kg in 
weight.  It is not understood how their other equipment such as ships 
or vehicles are manufactured as they have no fine manipulative 
ability.

	Some of the technology recovered from them indicates an 
advance level, perhaps as high as 17 in some instances.  Zhodani 
scientists believe that they must work with or have subjugated 
another race capable of these tasks.  The Zhodani have encountered 
the Jannix on a number of occasions, leading them to much greater 
knowledge of these creatures.  This is also where we get the term 
Jannix Cooperative.  However, with our no contact policy in efect, it 
is difficult to make any other assumptions or conclusions at this 
time.

Why? You are starting from Earth (or equivalent) which gives you a 29
km/sec orbital velocity (orbiting the Sun, not the planet). And you\'ll
have to *get rid of* some of that velocity, as Jupiter is orbiting
*slower*. 

Orbital mechanics is rather different than everyday experience.

It occurs to me that those "signatures" could be a bit of clever
disinformation by Sammy. For one thing, the one involving retreats
would make *real* retreats much safer by making the enemy follow slowly
and cautiously. 

And I can see someone setting up some "signature" moves such that when
someone tries to take advantage of them, he can do something else and
hand them their head as it were.

Want to bet? At the halfway point, they are *more* than 300,000,000 km
from both the planet they left and from the station they are going to. 

Light travels approximately 300,000 km/sec. That means that the timelag
in communications is more than 2000 seconds. That\'s over half an hour. 

That makes anything except email kinda pointless. You certainly can\'t
carry on a conversation, much less do anything "interactive". 

For that matter, after only a few days the timelag will be over 30
seconds, which pretty much kills interactivity.

Actually, no they didn\'t.  They were heading towards a showdown with the
K\'Kree, when they demonstrated conclusively to the K\'Kree that they did
not want to mess with the Hivers. A frontier world of the K\'Kree was,
uhh,  manipulated by the Hivers. The K\'Kree on that world had been
induced to eat meat as a normal part of their diet. The K\'Kree took one
look at what had been done to them, decided the Hivers could live after
all, nuked the manipulated world to glowing glass, and went elsewhere. 

Wondering, always wondering, if that was _all_ that the Hivers did....

The Hivers are, IMHO, THE scariest bunch in Known Space, period.

AHAH!  I\'ve found where the problem is.  If we use planetary motion to help us along
then the conjunction is a bad point to start from.

For starters lets draw the system.  We\'ve got the sun in the middle from which we can
draw some acceleration.  Then we\'ve got the earth\'s orbit.  Then out 5 times the
distance we\'ve got Jupiter\'s orbit.

Now we draw our path to make best use of the sun\'s gravity and the motion of Jupiter
and  Earth.  The simplest drawing would be a circle that is tangential to the top of
Earth\'s orbit and the bottom of Jupiter\'s.  This could also be an ellipse with the sun
at one focus and a spot between Earth\'s and Jupiter\'s orbit as the other focus.  I
suspect this would be where you point the ship to get the appropriate flight path.
Note that in both cases you conserve your orbital velocity to match the destination on
the far side of the sun.  If the circle was set up in the conjunction, the ship\'s
velocity would be countered by the planet\'s velocity.

Now you could produce a nautiloid shape where you spiral in to Earth\'s orbit, but that
would require a spirograph to draw (which I don\'t have).

Anyway, if we assume a circular orbit (which I\'m pretty sure it won\'t be) then the
total trip distance would be pi*D where D would be about 6 AU. Roughly 10 AU to
Jupiter and 10 AU back.  Initial orbital velocity would be about 106,000 km/hr (the
Earth\'s velocity), final velocity would be 7,487 km/hr (Jupiter\'s velocity).  Using
those numbers, it would take a drive capable of a continuous .0043 m/s/s acceleration.
Which would be an ion drive 175% the size of the ship...

However, accepting a 3 year turn around yields a 64% drive fraction and a 4 year turn
around yields 31% using ion drives.

This has gotten me to thinking, and an advance apology if this has been

Up til recently, I used Canvas 3.5; now I use Canvas 5 for the most part,
with some work done in Illustrator or Freehand; most of what I make deck
plans for is not Traveller, however, but my Star Trek game, or any of a
number of home-brews that I have/will be running.

I much prefer draw programs for this kind of work; paint is easier to
convert to a JPEG or GIF, but it\'s not as accurate or useful while working
with the deck plans themselves (and, of course, it\'s more of a pain to
move bits and pieces around... )

I kinda like the Tick idea, though...

The Hiver AM, IIRC the Imperial Encyclopedia, Aliens of the Rim: Hivers and
Ithklur.  The Ithklur tell a different tale.  They were (and remain in the
1200s) the major members of the Federation ground forces.  The Hivers
supposedly bugged out and the Ithklur vowed to fight on to the end.  The
fighting on certain worlds got really bitter.  The K\'kree were similar to a
herd beast the Ithklur were fond of eating so they began to eat them, taking
their weapons and equipment to continue the fight.  The K\'kree on the world
went to "get them back" and began eating Ithklur.  The Ithklur say the Hivers
were actually getting ready to surrender but then they saw this and similar
events and bluffed the K\'kree, who fell for it.  Other manipulations were
intimated including solitary recreation (abhorrent to the K\'kree).  There were
a few of the worlds... they remain interdicted by the K\'kree to the Collapse.

> The Hivers are, IMHO, THE scariest bunch in Known Space, period. 

Yup.  I like them alot.  Very "alien" and unusual.  Hiver Tech Rep\'s can be
very fun to ref, messing with players heads, especially.

The ones in the upper left corner, from left to right:

Aslan, K\'kree, Vargr (I think - partially obscured by bartender) and Vargr.
The picture on the bottom is an Aslan with Dewclaw extended
facing what looks like an overgrown tick or mite.

Alien Module 7 Hivers  pg 17

"Selecting several worlds within Kilong sector deep in the K\'kree\'s Two
Thousand Worlds, major secret expeditions were dispatched to work a
variety of manipulations on the native K\'kree populations.  Over a
period of years (-2018 to -2013), the expeditions were successful in
changing altering K\'kree culture from its consistant and static mold,
introducing such aberrations as meat sauces for foods and acceptance of
isolation as a recreation."
...
"The K\'kree were extremely disturbed by the Hiver tampering with their
culture. The four K\'kree worlds which had been tampered with were
sterilized immediately; they remain interdicted worlds even today."

from this I would expect that it was an Italian food chain and not
MacDonalds

	I personally prefer more CAD-oriented drawing packages (I currently

(This being manipulating K\'kree on an invaded world into using meat sauces
with their meals.)

This is mentioned in the original Hiver alien module, and amplified (as
well as given a possibly different spin) in the TNE Hivers & Ithklur book.

In the original, it is a given fact that a Hiver manipulated the K\'kree,
and teh war ended, but no details are given.

H&I tells the story in more detail, with a different spin, without
changing any of the "facts" presented in the original module. In the
revised history, the K\'kree responded to Ithklur eating K\'kree corpses
(fresh meat) by eating Ithklur corpses. [1] A Hiver diplomat reported this
fact to the K\'kree, incidentally claiming that it was a consequence of its
manipulation. The K\'kree, and the other Hivers, believed it: the war was
over and the Hiver was granted the Manipulator title.

(Marc has noted that there is nothing to stop a Hiver recording many
possible outcomes of an action, then pointing to the one that turns out to
be true and claiming a successful manipulation. H&I presents Hivers as a
society of social scientists, each one trying to perform experiments on
the others, and therefore you can never trust that a Hiver is ever telling
you the truth. Whetehr you agree with this or not is a matter for your
Traveller universe. Personally, I like it because Hivers become a _lot_
more interesting to play.)


[1]There as a near-flame-war about this on the TML last year, mainly a
disagreement about whether a herbivore would eat meat under any
circumstances.  A quick bit of research will demonstrate that not only do
herbivores kill quite easily (when in stressful situations and unable to
flee), but they will also eat meat under the same circumstances. (When I
was a kid, one of my gerbils ate half the other when its food dispenser
jammed and I didn\'t notice, because there was still food in the bin. A
hard way to learn a lesson, but one I remember vividly even now.) In a
real drag-em out fight, with plenty of stress and the necessity of staying
under cover (because of artillery), it is quite possible that K\'kree
soldiers would \'break down\' and eat Ithklur corpses.

It\'s a Star Wars knockoff of the Fox television series "Cops." For
those people who are lucky enough to live in areas not subject to
American network television, "Cops" is one of those real-life
"documentaries" where a film crew rides around with police officers
shooting miles of video. Then the producers pick the "cool" scenes

These guys did a professional-quality job of making this video--you\'d

didn\'t know ...

It\'s with a hard "G", as in "Great".

It originated back in (roughly) the early to mid-
1980\'s, when RPG\'s were starting to diversify
and seemingly every game company was coming out
with it\'s own system, many of them half-assed.
 At the time, SJG\'s base was its boardgames like 
Car Wars and Ogre. Since Car Wars had a lot of 
roleplaying elements to it, lots of fans were 
asking when SJG would put out its own RPG.
SJ wanted to do an all-genres _good_ game,
so that project was put on a back burner until
they could devote the resources to develop it.

Somewhere in this time frame, SJ explained this
in an editorial in Autoduel Quarterly (the 
"JTAS" for Car Wars) and mentioned eventually
putting out their Great Unnamed RolePlaying System
(it\'s working title). Later mentions in AQ
acronymized this to GURPS.

By the time SJG took it off the back-burner 
several years later, "GURPS" had developed
its own name recognition -- if they called
they game something like "EverythingQuest",
game buyers whould say "what? What\'s that?";
if they called it GURPS, the people most 
interested in buying it would recognize it
as "Steve Jackson\'s RPG".

So they kept the acronym and came up with
new words to fit it.

Since the G originally stood for "Great", 
it\'s pronounced hard.

And if that\'s not good enough, let\'s just add
that Steve Jackson has always used a hard G
when I\'ve seen him at Cons.

_BUT_, it ***finally*** puts the Aslan dewclaw in it\'s
proper configuration, with the hinge at the tip of the
thumb (producing a useful weapon with some reach), 
instead of that bizzare thing in DGP\'s artwork, with
the hinge at the base (which produces what could at

Anybody know a good *freeware* CAD or drawing program for Linux?  And no,
*DON\'T* suggest GIMP.  I can\'t get it to work with my system due to memory
constraints.

From seeing \'Cops\' once or twice (hey, I was waiting for The X-Files, ok??), it\'s come to my attention that a white male *cannot* be arrested on a felony warrant here in the U.S. *UNLESS* he takes his shirt off first.

Wish I\'d known that way back when; I coulda beat the charges due to an improper warrant...  <grin>

Okay, I think that (since I got the Delta-V equation right) it would be fairly safe 
to say that without fusion rockets at TL you can\'t have widepread exploitation of 
the outer planets. So here\'s a revised spec. The ship should be capable of 
supporting a full colony on Mars (this is its prime role), so it requires a 1 year 
round trip to Mars and other inner planets (if this is not possible it could go up 
to a maximum of 2 years); with the secondary function of doing a classic 
Hohmann transfer trip to a scientific base on Jupiter (and those scientists have 
to be really dedicated).

Actually, it\'s the ellipse, tangent to both orbits, with the sun at one
focus. That gives you the classic Hohmann transfer orbit.

You\'ve still made a mistake. You forgot to allow for the fact that the
Sun will do a lot of the slowing down (on the way up) and speeding up
(on the way back).  Merely "climbing" from Earth orbit to Jupiter orbit
will subtract a lot of velocity from the ship.

Actually, if you use a proper Hohmann orbit, you get a 2.7 year trip
one way, with a .6 year layover while you wait for the planets to line
up properly for a return trip. And you only make a short burn at Earth
and a short burn at Jupiter.

But from his mane, he\'s a Trader, and probably a little more tolerant.  The
rest of the K\'Kree\'s entourage could be just outside, and he\'s a junior
intern sent in to fetch drinks.  Note the Aslan seems to be a bit put out

The Hiver is watching the fight in the back (directly above the K\'Kree\'s
head.)

As someone has probably already mentioned, it was TNE\'s "Aliens of the
Rim,
Vol. 1". 

What happened, according to the Hivers, was that after the K\'kree
pounded
on the Hivers for six years, the K\'kree slowed to regroup and upgrade
their 
forces.

This gave the Hivers time to change the culture on a few selected worlds
in the Kilong sector of the Two Thousand Worlds. Within 5 years (-2018
to -2013), these worlds were using meat sauces for food and accepted
isolation as a recreation, both of which are anathema to normal K\'kree
society.

The Hivers got the K\'kree to the negotation table by hinting they would
surrender then surprised the delegation by demonstrating their changes
and showing plans for doing the same to the entire Two Thousand Worlds
unless the K\'kree left all occupied worlds and backed off.

Can you say "immediate armistice"? Sure. I knew you could.

Walter was correct in a sense. The worlds were indeed sterilized though
there are no details as to how this was accomplished. The worlds were
also interdicted and remained so up to the Rebellion and the advent of
Virus.

That\'s right, folks. Interdicted in -2213 and still going. That\'s about
equal to becoming interdicted around the beginning of the Egyption
civilization and continuing through today. Talk about paranoid.

Now I said "according to the Hivers" above for a reason. One of the
Hiver client races, the Ithklur, has a different version.

According to *these* guys, on at least 4 K\'kree worlds, substantial
Ithklur ground forces were left behind when the Hiver navy bugged
out. True to form, the Ithklur, like any other elite fighting
force left to die by "those in charge", chose to fight until they
were killed or starved to death. Fortunately, they found each world
had _plenty_ of food...in the form of the K\'kree. It just so
happened the K\'kree were somewhat similar to a meat animal 
domesticated by the Ithklur. All the Ithklur had to do then was use
the weapons and ammo that came with dinner and continue having fun.

To call the resulting combat and atrocities by both sides "vicious"
is like calling the Pacific Ocean "moist". The K\'kree eventually
responded with "ceremonial consumption of the Ithklur dead", as
GDW put it, in vengeance for the Ithklur dining practices.

Now the Hiver in charge of relieving the cutoff forces happened
upon the above situation and, being an enterprising lad, er,
sophont, drafted some "creative" documentation claiming the whole
thing was a deliberate Hiver manipulation. He/she/it then crashed
the *real* Hiver surrender negotiations barely in time to pull one
of the biggest bluffs in galactic history. Afterwards, the Hiver
was heralded as one of the greatest of all Manipulators.

The Ithklur call him something else.

One last thing. GDW wrote the following as closure and it shows
the Ithklur attitude best of all. I quote:

"Significantly, the Ithklur military anthem dates from this
period. Although its official name is \'With Certainty of
Victory,\' its actual colloquial meaning is:  \'Hamburger for
Lunch Tomorrow, You Betcha.\'"

Ya gotta love the Ithklur....

The full show is 70+ MB.  Its broken into 5 pieces.  The last is half

I\'ve heard rumors that you can find it in someplaces on video tape,

Yep, that\'s a bloody good idea.  Saves on space that would have been used
for vehicle transport, and in return gives an extra dimension of movement,
speed, and much greater general flexibility.  AND it\'s unexpected by foes
who
haven\'t done their homework: "Hah, he\'s didn\'t bring any grav vehicles: so

That\'s the problem in trying to write adventure\'s that can be used in any
Traveller ruleset: the inconsistencies start to build up, and become more
significant to the adventure.  Thruster plates vs HEPlaR, ancient jump
torpedoes and the lastest Fusion Plus, it just get\'s hard lining up all the
bottles in a row.  Still, there is enough similarity in the Imperial etho\'s
that
you can still tell if a particular adventure is "Traveller" or not - at
least as
long as the Third Imperium lives....

So, I see a *lone* K\'kree parked next to *two* carnivores

I\'ve never heard of that until today.  What\'s a Hohmann transfer orbit?

Not so much a mistake as a false assumption.  I was assuming that the sun
was contributing the turning vector of the path.  From an absolute point of
view, the Earth would be running counter to Jupiter.  I think that the
gravitational effects of the sun would be offset by the increased orbital
speed.  That just leaves matching orbital speeds and covering the flight
path.  But I\'m no rocket scientist and that could be a flawed assumption.

Well, if you can burn continuously, you can use a modified Hohmann orbit...
I think.

I just looked up a Hohmann transfer orbit.  It seems concerned with minimum
energy requirements.  But we can use more energy intensive orbits.  I think
this would just make the orbit more eccentric.  But if you get too
eccentric, you turn your orbit into a parabola... i.e. you just shot
yourself out of the system... OOPS!

However, at best the distance would be a straight line between Earth and
Jupiter about 6AU as opposed to 10 AU.  Even at that distance, my ion
drives are too big for a one year trip.

Could I propose a trip to Mars.  Layover there until proper alignment and
then continue to Jupiter.  If the one year limit is a human factor (who
wants to be stuck on-ship for a year) then dumping the passengers on Mars
for a while can alleviate things.  But I don\'t know that the trip from Mars
to Jupiter will be any faster.  May even be a longer trip.

I\'m wondering what kind of culture any survivors of the sterilisation would

Okay, so you need a certain (rotational) velocity to achieve

or is this a point at which the gravitional attraction beytween two bodies

escape velocity .
How are these calculated for different world and atmoshpere types.  (The
atmosphere stops below low earth orbit  right?)

Which of the formulae listed is correct for calculting trhe velocity change
needed to reach a certain orbit?

Do they assume the rotational velocity of the planet in question as a
staring point?

You do need to beat local gravity to get off the ground, how is this
factored in?

I cannt figure how the units come out in the equation foe DV they need to

ISP is given in imperial units while elsewhere metric units are used, but
it doesn\'t matter does it because the ration of masses is the same.

I assume your just trolling now.  The R in New York is not silent,
and in Boston, the R is dropped only in certain local dialects, as
in "Pak the ca in havad yad."  But they say Red Sox just fine.

 I have used Superpaint (Mac), MacDraft, and most recently ClarisWorks 5. The
features I\'ve found most useful/important are: control over line centering,
good gridsnap controls and easy changes of line width, color and texture. The
ability to make the document larger than a single page helps too, but hasn\'t
been a problem since very early...

I) Since culture is so important in resolving planetary development meta
tasks, why is there no \'culture change\' meta-task?

J)Should the task DMs from unilateral meta-tasks be available for planetary
development. i.e. can I opt to to make a successfull formidable roll with
thr relevant skill to get a +2 drm?

You could give away all your resources in a grand socio-politico 
martyr kind of gesture, I\'m sure that would bring it up a notch or 
two.  Course, you\'d be broke.....but the campaign would have a very

sorry it is the stripped down student NT4 version, very slow to work

The Jannix Cooperative occupies an area of space on the trailing edge of
Zhodani territory.  These two races have fought a number of small
skirmishes, which is where most of this data comes from.  The Jannix were
first encountered in the year 1106 when a Zhodani scout cruiser, the
Zephone, was found dead in orbit around the moon of the planer Destrier in
the Qwan subsector.  After being boarded, it was found the crew had been
slaughtered to a man by an as yet unidentified group of insectoid
creatures.  Four dead specimens were found on board the Zephone.  After
careful study (the results of which are published elsewhere), it was
determined that a new threat had presented itself to the Zhodani people.  A
modest fleet was dispatched to the subsector and ordered to track these
creatures\' movements or where they had come from.

Fleet 27 arrived at Destrier early in 1107 and spent several months
searching with no results other than discovering two traders that had been
reported missing in Qwan months ago.  They both showed signs of damage by
alien weapons and in one case a small piece of hull was found from an
unknown ship amid the wreckage of a trader.  This hull metal was tested and
found to be above bonded superdense technology.

On the way back to Sector HQ for refit, Fleet 27 was attacked at a gas
giant refueling station.  The ambush had obviously been set for a while as
the enemy ships came out of the asteroid ring where they had lain dormant
undetected by the stations automated sensors.  The fight was brief as
superior weapons and faster ships overwhelmed Fleet 27.  They did manage to
destroy a 5000 ton destroyer class ship and cripple three 800 ton hulls,
one of which headed into the gas giant while the other two smashed into the
refueling station.  Two Zhodani escorts were able to jump away, but the
other 6 ships were lost with all hands.  After examining the battle report,
the Zhodani sent a large attack armada into the system to resolve the
situation once and for all.  Upon exiting jump, they found the entire base
ravaged to bare rock and very little debris to indicate anything had ever
been there.  They headed trailward intending to track the aliens down. 
After several jumps with no further evidence encountered, they came to a
system unexplored for 16 years.  They discovered a base in orbit around the
4th planet with several ships close by.  Proceeding on attack vector, the
Zhodani engaged and managed to defeat the base and ships with heavy
casualties to themselves.  A horrific fight ensued after the Zhodani
admiral ordered his marines to take the planetary base located close to a
mountain range.  The marines fought hand to pincher in close quarter\'s
combat with the insectoids as most of the base turned out to be
underground.  Over 1500 troops died in the action, but they took the
facility.  Several aliens were captured alive only due to incapacitating
wounds, in all other cases the aliens fought to the death.  Among those
captured was one different from the rest, this one was capable of psionic
activity.  The best Psions the Zhodani had were employed to wrench
information from the creature\'s mind.

The Psions found out much about the Jannix, as the creatures called
themselves, before it succumbed to the telepathic onslaught.  The Jannix
had originally come from a system some 30 parsecs further trailing, a total
of 5 subsectors away from the Zhodani border.  This base the Zhodani found
had been established as a frontier colony/raiding post.  Almost the entire
strength of the Jannix in the area had been destroyed in the two actions to
date.  The Psions learned of at least two other colonies to spinward.  The
Jannix cooperate with another race known only as the Builders.  This race
did not accompany the Jannix on their forward deployments.  It was learned
there are three classes of Jannix, Warriors, Technicians and Leaders. They
all have differing abilities, but all are extremely deadly creatures (see
technical notes).  The Builders outfit the Jannix with all their equipment
but the inherent bioweapons.  The Builders technology level appears to be
17 with some minor discrepancies.  The Jannix themselves are TL 4, but they
are capable of using most technological devices, just not building them. 
This is probably due to their lack of fine manual dexterity.  The Jannix
also appear to subjugate other races (less intelligent) to do most manual
labor tasks.  Many Gordas (a race of semi intelligent herbivore primates)
were found at the Jannix base, although these were killed in the fighting. 
The Zhodani became rapidly convinced they had to make preemptive strikes on
these other bases, as the Jannix/Builders alliance was far too dangerous to
remain unchecked.  The main problem the Zhodani had in coming to grips with
the Jannix was the technology gap.  The Jannix ships required no jump fuel,
apparently using psi-drive technology, so could leave anytime.  Also the
ships had a significant advantage in electronic countermeasure ability. 
However, the Zhodani\'s quantitative edge along with their much larger ships
were able to eradicate the Jannix\'s other two bases and many starships. 
The Zhodani also reported at least three ships they caught on the ground
but were unable to do anything about as they were protected by some sort of
force field impervious to weapon fire.  These locations are not known to
any but the Zhodani military.

For the next four decades the Zhodani had no further problems or encounters
with Jannix until the evacuation to the new Regency began.  The evacuation
pulled the Zhodani protected border in by many parsecs.  As of the current
date (1202), there have been a few scattered reports of Jannix encounters
in that area.  The Zhodani, affected as they are by Vampire problems, have
been unable to do much about these new incursions.  The most distressing
news is that the Jannix appear to be working with Vampire ships in some
instances.  To this date, no specimens of the Builder race have been
encountered although there have been reports of new mechanized fighting
machines acting with or around Jannix/Vampire activity.  These machines
generally have a humanoid form and a Vampire attitude.  It is believed that
this threat left unchecked could rival that of the virus release.  The
Zhodani offer large grants for information leading to destruction or
capture of Jannix/Builder technology, any information regarding whereabouts
or scientific data is also rewarded.

The Jannix are known to prefer underground installations and cooler
temperatures, their exoskeleton changes color from black to blues the
warmer it gets, although it appears to have no effect on their activities. 
They have been known to survive in vacuum for short periods of time.  This
is due to a lack of respiration, their bodily functions are almost all
organic chemicals, they do not require air to "breath" although they do
require oxygen for some functions.  The Jannix are the most deadly
intelligent race known at this time from a purely physical standpoint.

They seem to have no concept of surrender or truce and show no desire to
communicate with other species with the exception of their subjugate races.
 The leader types are capable of psionic communication and other psionic
abilities.  Their overall racial strategy has eluded Zhodani scientists, as
there is no evidence of a cohesive attempt to gain large chunks of
territory.  The Jannix raid into systems at random but make no effort to
retain what they take.  It is believed they are searching for something of
use to them or the Builders.  There has been evidence of burrowing/mining
at the few sites on planets where Jannix have been encountered, but this is
believed to be for breeding chambers.  There have also been stockpiles of
several naturally occurring minerals and organic compounds found at these
sites.  None of which are particularly valuable in a monetary or military
sense.  It is believed that these are the substances the Jannix need for
breeding or other bodily functions.

The Jannix life cycle has been documented to some degree.  It is know that
they are asexual and produce egg sacs, which are stored in vats of
chemical, most of which are naturally occurring substances.  The gestation
period is unknown as all eggs that were captured failed to mature.  There
was one encounter that included an immature form of Jannix, which was much
weaker than an adult but was still capable of combat.  It is believed the
Jannix mature very quickly and most of their skills are telepathic implants
rather than learned individual experience.  It is assumed that the class of
a given Jannix is determined by a combination of its egg development and
it\'s telepathic implants.  It is unknown whether a leaders psionic ability
is inherited or random chance.  The oldest Jannix body recovered was 8
standard years old.  The Jannix are capable of "growing" a part of their
body from the two manipulator arms.  The typical parts, which are all
organic based; are their weapons, tools, and computer interface devices. 
There have been reports of other strange things, but it is very rare and
probably misinterpreted.

The Jannix have several classes of starships.  There have been encounters
with 400, 800, 1200 and 5000 ton vessels.  They are known to use at least
two small craft, a 50 and a 100-ton, both of these are believed to be jump
capable as well.  An APC type vehicle and an AFV tank have been seen, but
both of these were land vehicles.  This is one apparent discrepancy to the
Builder technology level, contra-grav has not been seen in use on anything
smaller than 50 tons.  Another is that small arms and support weapons are
all organic based.  Starships are the only ones that have "normal"
weaponry.  They also seem to have a limited self-repair capability as well
as AI or self-aware computers.  Captured equipment has defied most attempts
to use or interface with it.  The only successes have been by the strongest
telepaths.

meters in height and 1.5 in width.  They have four major limbs, two 
small connector appendages in the upper third of the body and a pair 
of large cutting horns out the top of the shell.  Normal locomotion 
is accomplished on all fours although they are capable of standing on 
either set of limbs for extended periods.  A dense carapace covers 
the back and sides of the Jannix and the front is also protected, 
although to a lesser degree, by a chitin exoskeleton. The Jannix are 
colored from flat black to dark blue and deep purple, this seems to 
be influenced by the ambient temperature of the environment.

	The smaller connector appendages are usually attached to an 
organic weapon which fires chitin shells filled with acid/bile.  
These shells appear to be the Jannixs waste material and are highly 
toxic to humanoids.  Sometimes the Jannix are seen with other organic 
devices in place of these weapons, including computer interfaces and 
medical/repair devices, but these are very rare and the Jannix seem 
to go to great lengths to protect these.  There have been reports of 
flying Jannix, but it is more likely the creature\'s capability of 
jumping up to 30 meters high and 50 meters forward with the carapace 
spread out.

	The social structure of the Jannix is relatively unknown. 
Whenever they have been encountered in the wilds, there has been a 
vampire ship nearby.  It is believed somehow there exists a working 
relationship between the two.  This could be a dire threat to the 
Regency, but so far there have been no known incursions into our 
space.  The Jannix are unrelenting in the pursuit of their goals, 
whatever they may be.  A live specimen has never been taken for 
study.  Scientific perusal of dead ones has yielded some facts 
however.  Their blood is very acidic, to the point of damaging most 
container vessels.  They are capable of ingesting minerals but prefer 
organic materials.  They have internal organs capable of producing 
chemical physiological enhancers that can give them great strength 
and endurance for a short period.  They also have the ability to 
reproduce items of technology, converting the items inside the body 
and then expelling them.  This appears to be limited to small and 
uncomplex items, less than .2 cubic meters in volume and 5 kg in 
weight.  It is not understood how their other equipment such as ships 
or vehicles are manufactured as they have no fine manipulative 
ability.

	Some of the technology recovered from them indicates an 
advance level, perhaps as high as 17 in some instances.  Zhodani 
scientists believe that they must work with or have subjugated 
another race capable of these tasks.  The Zhodani have encountered 
the Jannix on a number of occasions, leading them to much greater 
knowledge of these creatures.  This is also where we get the term 
Jannix Cooperative.  However, with our no contact policy in effect, it 
is difficult to make any other assumptions or conclusions at this 
time.

Other Assets: Willpower-6, Driving-14
Soldiers have the ability to increase their Str and Con stats by 5 for 10
combat turns twice a day.  This boost comes from chemicals produced in an
internal organ.  They go dormant for 2 combat turns when it wears off
unless the second boost is used.  Soldiers may leap up to 30 meters high
and 50 meters forward instead of their normal move using their carapace
wings to assist once every 10 combat turns.  This requires and Average
Agility task.  Soldiers carry a Jannix Rifle at all times.  They are also
capable of emitting a tear gas/ smoke cloud with a 10 meter radius once a
day.

After the sterilization probably used, there might be some interesting fungi
down there, but that\'s about it. While fungi can develop in some interesting
culture, culturally, they still pretty much stink.

It\'s still interdicted because the K\'Kree don\'t do _anything_ in half measure.
Those worlds will _never_ be opened up again.

No, canines are actually omnivores -- if you plan
the diet right, you actually can have a healthy
vegetarian dog (and just take a good look at the
ingredients in dog food).

But, naturally, meat\'s preferred.

Even as a typical anti-New Era guy, I feel that Liar\'s & Lizard\'s were
among the best works put out by GDW.  Many didn\'t like the current
references, but nevermind, the Ithklur were still fun, and the HIver\'s
nicely

I wonder, how can you get the Ithklur to the Marches....?

numbers being unreadable on large ships.
* Changed Internal Cargo Bays and Cargo Grapples to allow for cargo
densities greater/less than 1. This can be used to simulate special cargo
haulers (such as ore haulers, where their cargo is denser than normal).
* Fixed the Excel weapon save macros from the Excel97 version.
* Removed the Lightweight Save macros and Weapon save macros from the
Excel95 version. This appears to cause a problem in Excel 95 that prevents
the TLSet macro from working. This appears to fix it.
* Added crewstations for small craft.

    'body' => 'I was looking through JTAS #22 a couple nights ago, re-read the article
"Port to Jump-Point by ...hmmm, initials L.G., author\'s name escapes
me at the moment. Drat. Leroy Guateman, IIRC was his name.

Anyway, part of the article dealt with the idea of Star System Jump
Point Cascades. For those who haven\'t read it, the idea is as follows:

A massive body, in the stellar mass range, disrupts jumpspace for
approximately 1000AU in all directions. Smaller masses within that 
1000AU range disrupt jumpspace to a lesser extent. This "Jump Vortex"
forms difficult terrain for a ship exiting jumpspace, limiting it\'s 
available exit points.

In an environment far from these Jump Vortices, such as deep interstellar
space, there is no disruption of jumpspace beyond that caused by the
100 diameter limit. Your jump drives act on the mass of your ship,
sending it anywhere within reach, precipitating out into realspace when
you intersect the 100 diameter limit of your target - or right at your target,
if you are aiming at empty space.

Within the Jump Vortex of a star system, things get much more complex.
The disruptions of jumpspace limit your choices based on how powerful
your jump drives are, and based on the star system\'s Jump Point Cascade.

In the cascade, the most massive body in the system (the sun) is
the Jump-1 point. The next most massive is the Jump-2 point (probably
the gas giant), right on down to the smallest mass (Jump-several-1000).

A Jump-1 ship (like our popular Free Trader) will exit jumpspace at the
system\'s Jump-1 point. A Far Trader\'s Jump-2 drive would be powerful
enough to allow a choice between Jump-1 and Jump-2 points, and
so on - even if the Far Trader was arriving from a Jump-1 transit, it
could still take advantage of it\'s better jump drives.

Similarly, the quality of jump drives affects how in-system (jump-0)
jumps are made. For each parsec capability in your drives, you can
change one jump point. For example, a Free Trader at a system\'s
gas giant (the Jump-2 point) could do a jump-0 and go to the
100-d limit of the system primary (the Jump-1 point) or make it to
the smaller gas giant (the Jump-3 point).

Note that a jump point can be occluded by the 100d limit of a bigger
jump point. A gas giant within it\'s star\'s 100d limit might still be
the Jump-2 point of the system, but an attempt to exit jumpspace
at the gas giant\'s 100d limit would drop you out at the star\'s 100d
limit instead.

The above is a distillation of the article "From Port to Jump Point" 
from JTAS #22, copyright Far Future Enterprises, and is included 
to facilitate discussion with those who started Traveller after the 
Good \'Ol Days.

Now, for some ideas about the article above:

What effects would the above rules on jumpspace have on a campaign?
Ships can still leave when they hit 100d from the main world, but
they\'ll usually arrive much farther from it. And if the ship automatically
precipitates out of jumpspace on the side of 100d limit towards her
origin, she might come out on the wrong side of the system primary
from her destination.

Suddenly the rest of the star system becomes inhabited by ships,
instead of just the 100d sphere around the main world. Fast traders
may become even faster, as they use their better jump drives to come
out right next to the gas giant for refueling instead of a day or so away.
Incoming ships can be scattered for light-hours across a busy solar
system, depending on their system of origin and the quality of their
jump drives.

System Defense Boat duties just got harder. Ethically Challenged,
Well Armed Ship Masters may have their lives get easier.

I think I like it, and am surprised at myself that I didn\'t really see the
ramifications of L.G.\'s article before.

Has anyone tried Jump Point Cascades in their Traveller universes?

Make all introductions of higher technology in the form of toys. The
younger generation will accept it quickly, and their appetite for it will
be whetted. In a generation you\'ll have research scientists and high-tech
consumers.

The current year for the campaign is 997 CE (current era).


Political Geography -

The Confederated Systems of Argent (CSA) is located near the Rimward
end of a ribbon of stars (The Quental Main) that extends several
hundred light years core and spinward.  Outside the Main the stars
are very scattered in this sector.

 =============================================                  

The CSA is bordered on it\'s spinward side by the Zeristu Empire.
The Zeristu Empire\'s size is not completely known, but appears to be
about the same size and strength as the CSA.  The CSA and Zeristu
came into contact, and conflict, a little over 60 years ago, and
have fought 2 wars and several skirmishes over the years.  Today
there is an uneasy peace between these two, largest, states, but CSA
citizens are still restricted to visiting only the border areas of
the Zeristu Empire.

Coreward from the CSA there is a region of explored systems along
the Quental Main.  This area includes a few multi-system states, but
most inhabited systems are unaffiliated with any other.  The CSA and
Zeristu have been slowly moving coreward through this area for the
last 40 years.

Beyond the explored region is the main body of the Quental Main.
Little is known of this area or the areas beyond.  Explorers,
merchants, and adventurers who venture into the "great beyond"
return some reliable data, but with even more tales.


Cultural Geography - 

There are a wide variety of Humanoid races and species occupying the
known areas of the Quental Sector.  The main Human races in the
sector are Solomani and Vilani, but each have several distinct
sub-races.  Smaller numbers of Sylean, Zhodani and Geonee are
scattered through out the sector.  Northwest of the CSA
(core-spinward), are a number of worlds occupied mainly by Vargr,
and information from explorers place a number of Aslan dominated
worlds beyond known space to core-trailing.

Within the CSA humans, of all races, form 90% of the population,
Vargr at 8% make up most of the rest.  Small groups of various other
species make up the remaining 2%.  Although we have no direct
evidence, it appears the Zeristu Empire has approximately the same
proportions.

Ancient History - 

You\'ve all heard the stories as children..."Once upon a time, there
was a Empire of all Humaniti called the Imperium that ruled most of
the galaxy from it\'s capitol, a planet called Core.  Then a terrible
civil war ripped the mighty Imperium apart.  The races of man warred
with each other, each claiming their right to rule all of space.
Their great fleets sweep across the heavens destroying everything in
their paths.  Weapons beyond our comprehension were invented,
weapons capable of exploding the very stars in the skies.  The
wizards of the warring navies brought their machines to life, and
even after the wizards were long dead their machines fought on.
Eventually, the universe itself shuddered and died, and after the
darkness we were reborn."  Although, these are stories there *is*
more than a smidgen of truth to them.

About 5,000 years ago there was a interstellar war in this area.  It
has come to be called the "Great War."  Very few records from before
this war exist, but from what little archaeologists and historians
have put together there was an Imperium and a civil war.  Current
thought is that this Imperium probably covered most of this sector,
but a single government spanning the galaxy is unbelievable.  From
the name given to the Imperium\'s capitol, we conclude that the
Imperium\'s center was located coreward of us, perhaps somewhere in
the unexplored part of the Quental Main.

A continuing mystery is what happened at the end of the Great War.
The few intact and deciphered records from this period indicate the
war was winding down with much of their civilization still intact,
when a gap in the records appears.  The gap in information is called
the Darkness and from the myths and legends is "when the universe
died."  During this mysterious Darkness, almost all the remaining
Imperial civilization was destroyed, leaving scattered ruins, dead
systems, and no record of what happened.  Several hundred years
later the survivors had rebuilt and relearned enough to begin
keeping records again.  The early records seldom looked back beyond
the last generation, and except for stories like the one above have
little to say about the Great Darkness.


Recent History -

King Sui Wu undertook the final unification of Argent in -14 BC, and
was proclaimed Planetary Protector in the year 0.  The Wu dynasty\'s
promotion of peaceful development and trade created a strong and
wealthy merchant class that eventually became the driving force
leading Argent back into space.

Argent achieved interstellar flight just less than 300 years ago,
the first planet in the local cluster to do so.  Until recently
travel was limited to slower than light "sleeper ships."  These
early explorers and settlers discovered recovering civilizations and
ancient ruins all across the subsector.

The development of jump technology in 903 allowed Argent to complete
the exploration of this subsector, and found the Confederated
Systems of Argent.  The CSA\'s main purpose has always been to
promote and protect trade among the member states, and in this role
did not historically maintain a large military force.  Contact with
the Zeristu changed this.

The Zeristu are an aggressive and militaristic culture.  They have
repeatedly attacked the CSA states and our allies during the last 60
years.  We have developed a strong Army and Navy to oppose them, and
during the recent war, 993-996, stopped their expansion with the
defense of Kasaan, Cathay and Vito.  The limit of the Zeristu\'s
trailing borders has been stopped at the Harkin-Wozo-Bern line, and
negotiations continue in attempts to liberate allied systems that
have fallen to the Zeristu.


The Worlds of the CSA -

Government -

The CSA\'s member worlds maintain their independence, and are
different in many ways.  As a unified group, they give their support
to the governing bodies of the CSA:  the Confederation Senate, the
Ministries, and the Protector.

The Senate meets continuously at Maston, Argent, and acts as the
legislative body for the CSA.  It\'s powers are limited to
interstellar affairs, trade policies, and funding and support for
defense forces.  Each member world sends 3 Senators to serve in the
Confederation Senate.

The Ministries of the Protector administer the laws and regulations
passed by the Senate.  The Chief Secretaries for each Ministry are
nominated by the Protector and confirmed by the Senate.

The Protector is the Chief Executive Officer and ceremonial leader
of the CSA.  The Senate elects the Protector for life from
candidates nominated by each member system.  Traditionally, the
monarch of Argent is elected as Protector.  Protector Codelia Wu,
Queen of Argent is the current Confederation Protector, ascending to
the chair in 988.

Argent (A7668C5-A) -  Star: Nota Ter (G2V)

Argent is the 4th planet of the Nota Ter system.  It is a temperate
planet with large oceans.  The main population centers are on
Hollis, a group of 3 large islands in the southern temperate zone,
and Jasta, a continent sweeping around Hollis from the southeast
crossing the equator and spreading out into the northern temperate
zone.  The Hollis area recovered from the Great Darkness more
rapidly than the Jasta area and has historically been the leader in
all areas of Argent life.

The major city and capital Argent is Maston.  Maston is located on
the inner sea separating Hollis from Jasta.  It is built on the 6
hills overlooking the large protected harbor that has made it the
center of trade on Argent.

Large sections of Jasta is still undeveloped wilderness with most
development concentrated along the eastern seacoasts of the inner
sea.

Life on Argent is still fairly rural.  Most people live in small
towns and villages scattered thoughout the islands and on Jasta\'s
seacoast and temperate plains.  Culturally, most Argentians are
conservative in thought, dress, and action.  They are also
industrious, inventive, and avid explorers.

The two other inhabited planets of this system are Hothouse,
F482264-8 (Nota Ter-3), and IceBox, F553364-8 (Nota Ter-4).  These
are little more than outposts.  A small population occupies an
asteroid belt in orbit 6.

Gorath (C569743-9) - Star: Gorath (G2II & M4VI, close orbital binary)

Gorath is the 3rd planet of the Gorath system.  The population is
widely scattered on hundreds of small and medium sized islands.
Before explorers from Argent arrived in 811 Gorath had no cities and
was mired at TL4.  The Argent merchants set up shop on an unoccupied
island, which they called Port.  Today Port is the capital of
Gorath, and is the only real city on the planet.

The people of Gorath are typically more "laid back" than those of
Argent.  They are given to colorful dress, elaborate and loud
entertainment, and more liberal social practices.  Goranthans have a
reputation as fierce warriors and excellent engineers, somewhat
surprising given the rest of their culture\'s reputation.

Bonzi (B88467?-8) Star: Erlish (K1V)

Bonzi is the second planet in the Erlish system.  It is a large cool
world with no oceans, although there are several very salty seas and
a number of large lakes.
Bonzi has a number of independent states that have joined together
into a trading confederation to represent their interests in the
CSA.  The independent states on Bonzi have fought several small wars
since contact with Argent, but regardless of their conflicts on the
ground maintain a unified front in contact with the CSA.

Bonzi has several ancient Imperium sites that archeologists are
investigating.  From what little that has been found, it appears
that Bonzi was once a leading system in this area.

Culturally Bonzi is very diverse with each of the several nation
states having its own unique culture.  Bonzanies make up a
disproportionally large part of the CSA\'s enlisted army and navy,
often joking that they just joined to avoid all the fighting at
home.

Bolongi, the capital of the state Inido, is an important center of
culture in the CSA.  The University of Bolongi\'s Department of
Archeology is reknown through out the subsector and it\'s
entertainers are considered some of the best in Argent subsector.

Shaw (A767887-A) Star: Asa (F8V)

Shaw is the 6th planet of the Asa system, and was the first system
visited by Argent explorers.  The explorers found a virtually empty
world.  The few Shaw natives were clustered in three river valleys
stuck at TL2.  Settlers from Argent mixed with the natives, quickly
eliminating them as a seperate people.  Today most Shawers claim
kinship with the original natives..whether true or not.

Shaw is temperate, with large oceans and a single large continent
mostly in the nothern temperate zone.  It\'s population lives mainly
in the valleys of the three main rivers draining this continent.
There are several cities along the rivers that service the
surrounding farms, ranches and mines.

Shawers are considered the most outgoing and social of the CSA
members.  It is often remarked that their government, a faceless
civil service, is so gray they have to make up for it in their
personal lives.

I sent out a background post for my AKUS MOBY game and a subsector
map it uses a few minutes ago.  This is a synopsis of the first part
of the campaign, where most of the characters meet.  Unless, I\'m
told to stop, I\'ll post more over the next few days.

NOTE:  I\'m writing these posts from the perspective of an NPC in the
Akus Moby PBEM named Coryden Heyst.  Cory began as a PC, but when
the player dropped out, I kept Cory around to serve as a way for the
GM to talk to the characters...and because I *liked* Cory.  I
promise to keep these posts short because I know many people don\'t
have an interest in seeing other peoples games.

AKUS MOBY: We Meet on Argent

The letter from the lawyer, Sung, asking to meet with me was a
surprise, but I had nothing better to do after being beached by the
Confederation Navy, so I accepted.  There were at least a dozen men
and women in Sung\'s office when I arrived.  It was clear that none
of us knew each other, nor why we were here, and I think we were all
greatly surprised when we discovered we were the heirs of Akus Moby.

It seems Moby was the great, to the fourth, grandfather of all of us
who, due to the vagaries of relativistic travel, had only recently
died.  During his youth he had fathered a daughter, and then taken a
hundred plus year journey to Shaw on a near-c ship.  He arrived on
Shaw about seventy years ago to find that the jump drive had been
rediscovered during his long journey.  Of course by this time the
girl he had fathered had grown old and had children of her own.
Moby had no desire to insinuate himself into the lives of strangers,
even if they were his kin, so he went off to explore and have
adventures.  Fifty years ago he hired Sung\'s firm to find his
relatives.

Well, to make a long story short, the lawyers could trace us all to
his daughter.  It was a great surprise to discover we were a room
full of cousins who knew nothing of each other.  Moby had been
tracking our families, though not interfering, and although we had
never met him he had picked us to be his heirs.

In his video he proposed to leave us his possessions, including his
ship, the Mae Lee. The proviso was that before we received a clear
title to her we would have to serve as her crew for the next seven
years.  We would have to work, as he had done the last 70 years, as
explorers and merchants on the Quental Main.  It also appeared that
most of his possessions were located in the Mark System, four jumps
from Argent, where we currently were.

Alternatively, we heirs could accept a small cash inheritance.  Most
took the cash, six of us took the ship.

After the less adventurous had left, I looked around and I saw that
I *did* recognized the short fellow in the corner.  He had been in
the Navy News just after the recent war with the Zeristu Empire.
Hoenja was his name, Kelly Hoenja I learned later, and the trial of
this Engineering NCO for mutiny and cowardness under fire had
captured a great deal of attention inside the navy.  I had known the
Captain on his ship while at the Academy (a Royal dunce...and I do
mean *royal* and I do mean dunce) and, frankly, wasn\'t that
surprised when Hoenja was found not guilty of those charges, but
convicted of insubordination and given a dishonorable discharge.
Convicting an NCO for the stupidity of some noble commander is an
old game, not a nice one, but court politics must be observed.  Yes,
I could see where Hoenja would want to leave the confines of the
Confederation for the unknown worlds on the Main.  I also imagine
Kelly has a grudge against the Confederation Navy and his former
commander in particular.  That\'s one reason I\'ve downplayed my
former profession.

There was one woman among us, Dr. Mira Hasta-Rur, a former Scout and
medical doctor.  Dr. Hasta-Rur is a small and fragile looking woman
with red hair and an almost elven look to her.  Frankly, I was
surprised that she stayed, but since have seen how adventurous and
*tough* she really is, and I must say her medical skill came in
handy just recently. 

Across the table from Dr. Mira was another former Scout, Ricardo
O\'Brien.  O\'Brien is much the stereotypical image of a Scout, rough,
tough, hard and ready for anything.  He isn\'t a large man, but his
attitude makes him seem bigger than he is.  Ricardo has shown good
Engineering skills and good survival reactions on our journey so
far.

Next to O\'Brien was Sir Jason Deveraux, an actor...well that\'s what
he said he was.  Personally, I pegged the tall, handsome man as a
con-man and a cad when first I met him.  I will admit, however, that
I have never proven a thing against him, and I may have misjudged
Sir Jason.  He *may* be an honorable man...but I still have my
doubts.

In contrast to the suave Sir Jason was the archaeologist, Arvitis
Steves.  Steves looks and acts the part of the absent minded
professor.  Steves, a giant of a man, seems to be interested only in
antiquities, artifacts and finding same.  I suspect he came along
just for the ride out to the unexplored worlds of the Main so he can
look for lost treasures.  Well, to be fair, Arvitis is a regular
whiz with sensors, a skill I\'m sure he developed doing field work.
There *is* one anomaly about Steves that concerns me, I\'ve seen the
gun case that he carries with him.  I *know* what sort of rifle goes
in a case like that, a very specialized rifle, not the sort of
weapon I would associate with an absent minded archaeologist.

Lastly, there was Martan Vishinik.  Martan\'s family ran a small
trading company before the war, but after the death of his parents
and his time in the Navy Martan returned to a failing business.
Although Martan hasn\'t said, I suspect it was his family\'s refusal
to knuckle under to the Spacer\'s Guild that ruined them.  In any
case, I think Martan was more than willing to sell out and start
fresh on the frontier.  I also get the impression that he wants to
prove himself.  Martan has become our leader, for now at least.

Traveling with us is the lawyer Audry Sung who will see to it that
we receive our inheritance when we reach Mark, and her fiance Jon
Midren.  If I have suspicions about Sir Jason, I have proof about
Jon Midren...a rotten piece of fruit if ever there was one.  Midren
is a noted duelist, suspected blackmailer and has the reputation of
a gigolo.  It seems Ms Sung, an otherwise sensible woman, is showing
a streak of naivete in regards Midren.  She seems to be truly
smitten with this cad and insists on his traveling with us.  I
foresee nothing but trouble from him for us all.

In order to reach Mark we will have to travel first to Gorath, then
Beck and finally Kurzu.  Our trip from Argent to Gorath and then on
to Beck will be on the liner Beamon\'s Rift.  Beamon\'s Rift is more
of a cruise ship than I would have liked, but as Ms Sung is paying
our way we are at her disposal.

Next...Exploring on Gorath...

The illo of the Imperial Marines is one of mine. Sorry if I tend to pick
"plausible" over "cool" - most of the time. I just couldn\'t make myself
believe that anyone would try to fight in a helmet that reduces your visual
field to a tiny slit. Would you give your soldiers tunnel vision... and
then put plasma guns into their hands??

I prefer to believe that Miller\'s Imperium has more sense than Lucas\'s Empire :)

Well, let me try to put this in a human perspective:

The Alien Freaks(tm) SOMEHOW, in a mere five years, managed to convince the 
people on these worlds to kill and eat their own children, after having sex
with them.

How?  We don\'t know, and we don\'t WANT to.  So we bombed the worlds down
to glass and now we make sure no one EVER goes there again.  Because if 
someone did, \'it\' might get loose...

(How\'s that?)

Besides, as someone noted, the K\'Kree never do things by halves.  There are
NO meat-eating sophonts within the Two Thousand; they\'ve all been converted
or exterminated.  It\'s a simple matter to apply this to meat-eating K\'Kree
as well.

After due "second thought", I basically agree with your decision.
I could rationalize that the "eyeslit" of the Imperial TL-14 helmet was
actually a sensor, projecting visual/infrared/etc. images to a screen
within the helmet - but that is contradicted by MegaTrav canon,
which indeed show\'s the view as a narrow slit.  Also, this "internal screen"
would actually *increase* the soldier\'s vulnerability to EMP pulses,
glitches, power outages, etc: he would be blind if the screen goes down.

Moreover, the MegaTrav helmet is not seen in Classic material, exist\'s
in the TNE (in the TL-15 Battlesuit illustration\'s) and doesn\'t exist
in T4.  Therefore, in good times there is no slit, in bad times there is
one.
Ergo, the absence of the slit in GURPS:Traveller is a Good Thing.

Finally, your helmet\'s do have an elegance and style that *is* pleasing
to the eye: the fact that they are functional is a bonus the Imperial
Marines
are sure to appreciate.   If you ever need a favour, they\'d be glad to help
you out in return - Lorean has their number.

"Where\'s the Vilani?"?  Well, why do you think that American soldiers
refer to both the WWII-era M1 helmet ("steel pot") and the current
Kevlar helmet ("K-pot") as "pots"?  _Definite_ Vilani influence....

(Alternately, this is an example of genetic-cultural convergence between
two otherwise different societies....)  ;-)

Well, I guess it\'s time for me to give a plug here for mine, although it\'s only
just started:

    http://pixie.simplenet.com/gaming/Traveller.htm

The closest I get to fancy graphics is colour-coded tables, so it\'ll load pretty
quickly even at 28.8... :-)  so if you don\'t like the fonts or something, it\'s your
defaults not mine. ;-) :-)

By far the largest section byte-wise is the log of the last MT campaign I ran,
which since it lasted more or less two years, is a lot.  There\'s some MT ship
designs I cranked out of my own C program (predates fancy GUI\'s, so I wrote my own
using vt100 cursor codes, haven\'t even tried compiling it recently).  There\'s an
unpolished version of my rules for a vector-based space combat system (which worked
*very* well), and if I recall I might even have the MT stats I used for Kafer
weapons...  Yeah, and there\'s an ever-increasing amount of very detailed system
data (as in DGP\'s WBH, but modified a little to provide more accurate average
temperatures in multi-star systems, and making a serious attempt to make livable
mainworlds really livable while staying within WBH formulae) -- although of course
at most the system UWP is canon, not the system contents.

But it\'s all set in the 1100\'s (the last campaign ran 1117-1119) and there hasn\'t
even been a Fifth Frontier War, let alone an assasination, so it might not be
useful to you.

I\'m about set to start a follow-on campaign sometime in the next few months.  As
yet I\'m not sure which ruleset to use (or which combination of rulesets, I like
aspects of MT and T4) so I can\'t really call it a completely MT site.

Anyone is quite welcome to link to me, as long as you\'re aware it\'s a work in
progress and subject to change.

 While this will probably start something regrettable, I can\'t resist pointing
out that the new iMac comes with ClarisWorks 5 (soon to be renamed
AppleWorks 5 due to Claris being resorbed by Apple...). Watching Photoshop 5
(NOT included) open in 6 seconds is kinda cool, too...

How are the new iMacs, anyways?  I haven\'t had the chance to check them out

                another mishap, and the ship drops out 
                of Jump space partway to its destination,
                with a +3 DM to the Jump exit roll.

Destroyed:
Deformed Jump   The Jump field does not enclose the entire
                Field ship. the ship suffers a +6 DM to the Jump
                exit roll.

                To detect a deformed Jump field and abort Jump
                Formidable, Engineering, Navigation, Edu, (fateful)
                Sum Engineers & Navigators DMs as one DM
                and roll once during Jump initiation

                All Mishap damage rolls are applied directly to the Hull.
                
                If Mishap result is superficial, then only
                minor items, such as antennae & aerials
                are outside the field - most Sensors will be
                destroyed by such a mishap.
                A Minor or Major mishap results in an
                uninhabited portion of the hull, such as a
                turret, cargo hold or fuel tankage being
                lost.
                A Destroyed result splits the entire ship
                in two, with explosive decompression
                results for the crew.

Unless stated all damage is multiplied by 5% and applied directly to the J-Drive.
E.g. (1) a Major mishap occurs on a ship whose J-Drive is 15/30. 
3D= 12 = 60% damage to J-Drive. 60% x 45 = 27. New drive status is 0/28 -
inoperable, and needs SERIOUS repairs ASAP.
E.g. (2) a Superficial mishap occurs on a ship whose J-Drive is 3/6. 
1D= 2 = 10% damage to J-Drive. 10% x 9 = 0.9. New drive status is 2/6 - operable,
and needs minor repairs at some point.

It\'s it\'s the cheapest (in terms of delta-V requirements) means of
transferring between two orbits. Named after the guy who worked it out.

There *is* a cheaper way *if* one orbit is more than 15 times bigger
than the other, but it takes *lots* of time.

Actually, if you are accelerating continously, you *aren\'t* "orbiting"
strictly speaking, and your course doesn\'t much resemble typical orbits.

Huh? Jupiter is about 5.2 AU out from the Sun. The Earth is one AU out.
At closest approach, the distance is *4.2* AU, at maximum seperation
it\'s 6.2. 

And if you are talking round trip, remember that you only have to carry
fuel for *one* way, it\'s assumed you can refuel at the station. (If you
can\'t then the situation *is* too expensive).

Orbital velocity and escape velocity depend *only* on the mass of the
planet asnd how far you are from the center of the planet.

Escape velocity and orbital velocities are "final" velocities. That is,
if you are moving at escape velocity, and are pointed in a direction
that doesn\'t intersect the planet\'s surface, you\'ll eventually reach
infinity. Likewise, if you have orbital velocity in a direction
"parallel" to the planet\'s surface, you\'ll be in a circular orbit.
This is all ignoring air resistance.

I don\'t know what the formulas you are looking at look like. But here
are the formulas from part 4 of the sci.space FAQ:

    NUMBERS

	7726 m/s	 (8000)  -- Earth orbital velocity at 300 km altitude
	3075 m/s	 (3000)  -- Earth orbital velocity at 35786 km (geosync)
	6371 km		 (6400)  -- Mean radius of Earth
	6378 km		 (6400)  -- Equatorial radius of Earth
	1738 km		 (1700)  -- Mean radius of Moon
	5.974e24 kg	 (6e24)  -- Mass of Earth
	7.348e22 kg	 (7e22)  -- Mass of Moon

	4.903e12 m^3/s^2 (5e12)  -- Gravitational constant times mass of Moon
	1.327e20 m^3/s^2 (13e19) -- Gravitational constant times mass of Sun
	384401 km	 ( 4e5)  -- Mean Earth-Moon distance
	1.496e11 m	 (15e10) -- Mean Earth-Sun distance (Astronomical Unit)

    EQUATIONS

	Where d is distance, v is velocity, a is acceleration, t is time.
	Additional more specialized equations are available from:

	    ftp://ftp.cs.unc.edu/pub/users/leech/FAQ/MoreEquations.gz

	For constant acceleration
	    d = d0 + vt + .5at^2
	    v = v0 + at
	  v^2 = 2ad

	Acceleration on a cylinder (space colony, etc.) of radius r and
	    rotation period t:

	    a = 4 pi**2 r / t^2

	For circular Keplerian orbits where:
	    Vc	 = velocity of a circular orbit
	    Vesc = escape velocity
	    M	 = Total mass of orbiting and orbited bodies
	    G	 = Gravitational constant (defined below)
	    u	 = G * M (can be measured much more accurately than G or M)
	    K	 = -G * M / 2 / a
	    r	 = radius of orbit (measured from center of mass of system)
	    V	 = orbital velocity
	    P	 = orbital period
	    a	 = semimajor axis of orbit

	    Vc	 = sqrt(M * G / r)
	    Vesc = sqrt(2 * M * G / r) = sqrt(2) * Vc
	    V^2  = u/a
	    P	 = 2 pi/(Sqrt(u/a^3))
	    K	 = 1/2 V**2 - G * M / r (conservation of energy)

	    The period of an eccentric orbit is the same as the period
	       of a circular orbit with the same semi-major axis.

	Change in velocity required for a plane change of angle phi in a
	circular orbit:

	    delta V = 2 sqrt(GM/r) sin (phi/2)

	Energy to put mass m into a circular orbit (ignores rotational
	velocity, which reduces the energy a bit).

	    GMm (1/Re - 1/2Rcirc)
	    Re = radius of the earth
	    Rcirc = radius of the circular orbit.

	Classical rocket equation, where
	    dv	= change in velocity
	    Isp = specific impulse of engine
	    Ve	= exhaust velocity
	    x	= reaction mass
	    m1	= rocket mass excluding reaction mass
	    g	= 9.8 m / s^2

	    Ve	= Isp * g
	    dv	= Ve * log((m1 + x) / m1)
		= Ve * log((final mass) / (initial mass))

(note that "g" in the above is a conversion factor, *not* the gravity
of whatever planet you happen to be on.)

	Relativistic rocket equation (constant acceleration)

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(a*t/c)
	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(a*t/c) - 1)
	    v = c * tanh(a*t/c)

	Relativistic rocket with exhaust velocity Ve and mass ratio MR:

	    at/c = Ve/c * ln(MR), or

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(Ve/c * ln(MR))
	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(Ve/C * ln(MR)) - 1)
	    v = c * tanh(Ve/C * ln(MR))

	Converting from parallax to distance:

	    d (in parsecs) = 1 / p (in arc seconds)
	    d (in astronomical units) = 206265 / p

	Miscellaneous
	    f=ma    -- Force is mass times acceleration
	    w=fd    -- Work (energy) is force times distance

	Atmospheric density varies as exp(-mgz/kT) where z is altitude, m is
	molecular weight in kg of air, g is local acceleration of gravity, T
	is temperature, k is Bolztmann\'s constant. On Earth up to 100 km,

	    d = d0*exp(-z*1.42e-4)

	where d is density, d0 is density at 0km, is approximately true, so

	    d@12km (40000 ft) = d0*.18
	    d@9 km (30000 ft) = d0*.27
	    d@6 km (20000 ft) = d0*.43

Differences? There\'s a button bar, the graphics side is improved, there\'s

like it a lot more... It came out almost 12 months ago - the upgrade cost
about 50 GBP. It has since been renamed AppleWorks 5 (since Claris

new version of the Apple Internet Connection kit) is called ClarisWorks
Office. Well worth the upgrade from 3, a little less so  from 4, but the
equation editor was something that I wanted...

Now for something totally different...

It\'s been since the mid-70\'s since I had a college math course and the old

Almost as simple as CT - pick a standardized hull, pick a bunch of
standardized modules, and voila!

>  How dependent is it on G:Vehicles and G:Robot\'s
>(If you want drones, or robot crew, etc)?

David Pulver, author of Vehicles and Robots, also wrote the starship
construction rules for GT.  The GT rules are fully compatible with both of
those supplements, but don\'t contain all the details needed for robots,
drones, ground vehicles, etc. - just starships.  The smallest hull size
given is 10 dtons.  

The modules (which are an abstraction to speed design, not literal modular
components) were designed using straight Vehicles rules, and there are
guidelines for creating your own, compatible modules for anything that was
left out.

>  Is everything needed for basic

Yes - the design system for GT is fully self-sufficient.  The playtest
draft even included stealth, EMM, bay weapons, and one each PB and meson
spinal guns - though this may have changed by the final printed version,
due to space constraints or editorial decision.

GT ships are primarily merchants, with just a nod to military ships.  The
plan is to produce a Military/Mercenary supplement for GT, which will do
more justice to naval ship design.

I always figured that the slit was a sensor apature, and that there was a

(4/3)*(pi)*(cube of the radius)

pi = 3.14 (rounding off -- a calculator would have a more
    precise value, which might make a difference with
    what you consider acceptable error for large spheres)
cube of the radius = r*r*r

I\'ve been working for Famile Spofulam for too long - I saw this number, and
started idly thinking about how many cubic meters of thruster plates it
would take to move the moon somewhere else.

OK. If 1 MT of TNT is 4.2e15 J, then it\'s 4.2e9 MJ.

One ton of TNT is thus 4,200 megajoules.

One kilo of TNT is thus 4.2 megajoules.

Hmmmm, why do I suddenly think that FS\' existing suite of weaponary is
inadequate ...

Second, to make it Traveller related. I\'ve been playing with a number of
deck plans in the spirit of the parallel vs. perpendicular arguement. I\'ve
come to the conclusion that parallel is really more efficient, as far as
waste space, for small craft. Every streamlined design I\'ve sketched seems
to involve large cargo elevators or more massive handleing equipment for
perpendicular than would be needed on a parallel design.

So one answer I think might work is multiple propusion. The design I\'m
working with now is a slab, like the original Far Trader. However the design
incorperated CG for in atmosphere flight, where the ship operated like an
airplane, with decks parallel to thrust. Once out of atmosphere thruster
plates, located on the "belly" of the ship take over, providing
perpendicular thrust.

THis seems to owrk since the ship has good streamlinging and areodynamics in
atmosphere but requires 1 gee less compensators while in extra-atmospheric
flight. It also helps explain (to my feeble mind, at least) why a ship would
want both CG and thrusters.

When the plans are finished I\'ll post a note to the list and forward them to
anyone interested. As always, comments are welcome/expected.

That\'s funny, I\'ve always thought the \'old\' Imperial Battle Dress/Combat Armor
helmets with the little slit for vision made a lot of sense. Think about it for
a while: A TL 15 combat helmet is filled with electronics, including a very
sofisticated heads-up display. IMTU Battle Dress helmets have 360 degree
vision, with the area outside the normal field of vision compacted into narrow
bands at the end of the wearers field of vision. Thus, the wearer will be able
to spot movement behind him/her. The heads-up display also work with light
intensifiers and infrared and what-have-you.

If we accept the postulate that transparent materials are weaker than opaque
materials (they generally are IMTU), then it makes sense only to have a little
slit in the helmet for backup purposes (when all the fancy sensors fail), as
this would give increased protection to the face.

Just a thought...

No, I was refering to Earth on one side of the sun and Jupiter on the other.
Therefore, you add the distances not subtract.  But then you\'d be flying straight
through the sun... It was a benchmark on distance not an actual flight path.

The flight path I\'m picturing now has Jupiter and Earth at right angles.  Using a
highly eccentric ellipse, Sun is in the center, Earth and Jupiter are
tangential.  Earth is also tangential on the far side of the orbit about 1/2
year.  I have NO idea how to apply thrust to maintain that path.

Well, my calculations have been towards figuring out the drive proportion,
including half the trip\'s fuel and the reactor needed to power the engine.

My response?

The M-17A1 Protective mask and MOPP-4 chemical warfare gear.  Try firing a
M-16A1 wearing heavy charcol-impregnanted clothes, thick rubber gloves, and
a heavy mask that doesn\'t allow you to wear your glasses.

The Spinward Marches Campaign: Adventures in a War-Ravaged Sector (GDW,
1985), is a 49-page adventure/campaign sourcebook for the Fifth Frontier
War era.

The first few pages is a sketch outline for a campaign set in the immediate
aftermath of the 5FW.  Not all that much to brag about, but it\'s usable.

The second section is a history of the 5FW.  Very well done, and a gold
mine for Classic Era Referees.  Has a timeline, maps of the various fleet
positions, and rough bios of the major players.  A nice touch is start and
end positions for each of the previous wars, showing the ebb and flow of
Imperial/Zhodani fortunes.

The best part, IMHO, is the detailed subsector by subsector look at the
Spinward Marches.  This is the best resource short of the excellent Regency
Sourcebook for the SM.

A Marches wide transport company, an Imperial Battle-Rider squadron, and
the 4518th Lift Infantry complete the book, along with the Supplement 4
character tables.

A lot of this material is reprinted from other sources, but it\'s nice to
have it all in one place.

>b.  In TNE, before GDW went belly-up, was any canon reference made to what

Penn & Teller.

Actually, the idea wasthat it was a Vampire Empire of some sort.  Nothing
official was ever published on the subject, IIRC.

>c.  Also TNE, who or what was the \'Empress\' that Strephon receives the
>psionic message about at the Depot?

Once again, nothing concrete was ever revealed.

>d.  Again TNE, what is the nature of the phenomenon that is causing chaos
>in Zhodani space, observed by the Imperial passive collection system?

The Empress Wave.  The same effect that causes the vision experienced by
Strephon at Project Longbow seems to have some sort of negative effect on
the fabric of Zhodani society.

(So far I\'ve found lots of references to "fatty" and "greasy", so
obviously gloss paint is appropriate. I also know that agitated rings are
purplish, that there are silver threads linking other rings to the master
ring, and that there\'s one reference to "striped" rings, which I think
means each ring is a different colour, but may also refer to the rings
themselves having stripes. Oh yes, and in _Infinity\'s Shore_ Lark
recognizes the pattern of Asx\'s rings in the new Ewasx stack, so there
must be differences between Jophur.)

This reminds me of a passage in MT, in which Droyne-built jump drives are
described as "the best in known space." Everything else I have on Droyne
suggests that Droyne are not a jump drive building race anymore. 

So, what\'s the story of this comment? Do some Droyne build jump drives for
exclusive Imperial clientele?

I got the impression that the droyne could make "the best in known space",

 As noted, very fast, compact, and very much a Mac. Based on my local store\'s
experiences, the iMac is pretty solidly constructed as well, with only three
real
hardware problems in 110+ sold. The jury is still out on USB, in my opinion,
but looking at least decent so far...
 Personally, I need more out of a computer, but for the "I want to do email,
homework, and the internet" crowd, it\'s perfect.

 ObTrav: Will there be anything like a "desktop" computer at the higher tech
levels, or would the computerized house/pet/wristwatch/pencil be more
prevalent?

Those are outdated (the M-17 masks and the M16A1) even in the Marines.  The
new masks have external screw-on filters, etc and are much better.  I can\'t
remember hte designation.  I know what you mean though.  Even those make it
impossible to do anything but "fake the funk" much less get a decent stock
weld and sight alignment.

Looking at how simple an eyeball display (FFS- TL11) is, I don\'t see why it
should be so complicated to have that slit be a backup to an electronic
helmet.  As far as EMP and bliding and such, filters and automatic cut-offs
couldn\'t be too complicated (especially by TL14), either.  Any troops
important enough to rate Combat Armor or Battle Dress (as opposed to a Combat
Environment Suit) would rate the expense, certainly.

Lastly, tunnel vision wouldn\'t necessarily hurt the aiming of a plasma/fusion
weapon.  The loss of peripheral vision could hurt in tactical movement, but
anything generating an EMP too make a simple visual device inoperable
(assuming it\'s not fibre-optically "immune") can mostly likely more directly
affect the said troops. : )

	A Virus Empire is definitely the consensus viewpoint, and Dave 
Nilsen has said things on the tne-rces list that suggest this is what he 
had in mind.

	Doug Berry said that it was the Empress Wave (EW).  It actually 
can\'t be.  If you look at the geography of Known Space and remember that 
the EW travels at light speed then Zho and Vargr space would have been 
disrupted by the EW long before the Collapse.
	In the Refs section of the RSB, it says that it is not known 
whether the disruption of Zho society is caused by the EW or whether the 
Zhos have been "infected" by something from their core expeditions.  
Given that I\'ve just shown that it can\'t be the EW in isolation, it must 
be the infection.  The EW could easily be an enabling device for the 
"infection" but the EW is not itself the cause of the Zho unrest.

Arg!  Thank you Rob for finding this *feature* for me.  

I\'ll be teaching basic spreadsheet use to my Computer Concepts
classes in about 6 weeks and I haven\'t had a chance to play with
Excel 97 yet.  Now, I\'ll know, at least, that I have to revise some
macros I have in sample sheets so that they will work on the student
machines.  BTW, our textbooks are still for Excel 95, so I suspect
macros will be the least of my worries.  I *do* hate Microsoft.

>This meant that what I\'d just spent an hour teaching the kids was useless,

Don\'t you hate that.  I tell, students that "no matter specifics
about an application they learn, it\'ll be changed by the time the
next version comes out, so concentrate on the concepts and treat all
new versions as brand new programs."  I can\'t say I *like* that, but
that seems to be the way things are going.

Gawd, this has to be the worst way of doing it I can think of.
I do most of my development artwork and graphics this way on my
Sparc, though, adding tgif and xbm to the equation.  Just downloaded
gimp to see if it\'s any use.

I really wish there were a good professional merged draw/paint prog
available for Solaris systems (and Linux for the rest of the world ...

SuzD has this mental vision of a freetrader captain looking 
shocked, "What do you mean I have to uninstall the new 
sensor software because it is incompatible with my comm 
software. After what I paid for it?!?!!! Why can\'t they make this 
stuff backwards compatible? I don\'t care if it is impractical... 
No, I don\'t want to purchase the upgrade to my comm 
software. My comm software suits my needs just fine... What 
do you mean that everyone is migrating to a new protocol?"

By which time the captain is putting holes in the nearest wall 
with his head...

Gee, this sounds all too familiar...

Slowly, very slowly...with cross empire time measured in months to years, and
definitely years for things to permeate the entire Imperium, there can be
nothing like the insane pace of software development that exists today. At
that rate Microsoft/Sylea will have written Windows 5698 by the time Dos 3.2
has reached the Spinward marches. That way lies utter chaos.

Software engineering will be much more real engineering than the art it is
today, with proven modules you essentially \'bolt\' together to make programs.
Programming with these modules will be more akin to designing machine parts
and mechanisms using CAD software than programming as we know it today.

This does mean there would be a lot of variation in design, but I also suspect
that by then, there will be a lot more de-facto standardization, from custom
as much as anything else.

Data will carry it\'s description with it, and the programming necessary to
utilize it. A spectrographic dataset will be collected with spectrometric
analysis algorithms embedded; textual data will carry with it the abiltity to
change fonts, display illustrations, etc within the data.

While this may seem wasteful of memory, it also reduces the OS to a framework
to hold program modules that are loaded and processed with the data. So long
as the modules are bug free within that dataset, that\'s all that they\'ll ever
operate on, much like protected memory, only more so, since the OS has no core
services except module swapping.

This implies a sort of Stationery kind of metaphor instead of a program as a
Tool that creates or operates on separate bits of data.

From a commercial standpoint, it would also make more business sense...you
don\'t buy a program, you buy a chip/disc/download that has, say, 150 \'sheets\'
of Photoshop, or 200 \'pages\' of Excel. There are already suggestions in place
to rent software by the hour rather than owning it, in some of the network
computer scenarios floating about. To give someone a copy of yoour work
requires using another page from your stationery pad, or of of theirs.

You could, I suppose, at some more cost (or none, depending on the licensing
agreement), make a Excel sheet into a pad...Andy could sell or give (if he was
very generous) away pads of FFS sheets. These would contain a subset of the
full Excel code that does only what Andy\'s programmed into it. This differs
from the current spreadsheet in that you wouldn\'t need to own a pad of Excel
to use it.

It could be set up so that you could erase sheets as many times as you wanted;
so long as you didn\'t want a permanent copy of it, you could get one sheet of
Akin\'s FFS2 and make as many ships as you wanted out of it.

Read-only copies...\'printouts\' of sheets could be possible as well... these
would encapsulate only enough of the program to display the data in the format
that the creator specified, separate fom the creator sheet. This might be a
toggle in the sheet itself..to \'write protect\' it. Once you finalize the
\'printout\' of the sheet you can\'t erase it and redo it. On the other
hand...then the sheet is legally yours and can be duplicated as many times as
you want. I\'ll bet Kinko\'s will do it pretty cheap...

The same thing, but on a different level, could be done with software creation
pads, aka compilers, only their \'write protected\' output are new pads instead
of sheets.

A pad could be a combination of all of the above...I could buy a 150 sheet pad
of Photoshop, but the filters I devise using the filter creation part of the
Photoshop pad could become their own sub-pad, with limited or limitless sheets
depending on the license I\'ve purchased or the agreement that comes with the program.

In fact, I may be able to freely distribute them, as I can the filters
constructed using Photoshops \'filter factory\', or Excel macros. Note...these
filter pad sheets don\'t exist on their own, they\'re combined with data in a
regular Photoshop sheet to produce an effect, and thereafter are only
\'absorbed\' into the sheet, or destroyed if I undo the effect.

Yes, this is essentially the logical culmination of object-oriented
programming and concepts like OpenDoc...Nicolas Wirth was talking about these
ideas decades ago, but it does make a far more stable computing environment.

Note, this is for consumer level computing, oriented toward content creation.
The computers running starships may be something else entirely, after all,
it\'d _really_ suck to run out of gunnery sheets in the middle of a battle ;-)

	Depends on what you mean by incompatible. You will NOT be able to
get the same ship out of both systems. However, you can rate ships
built with FF&S2 using TNE rules, as long as you remember that the
armor ratings changed ...

I\'ve only just roughed out the shape for a 100 ton scout. I\'m going to
use a roughly conical hull (the point gets rounded off a lot). not
counting things like landing gear, it\'ll be 20 meters in diameter and
13 meters tall (actually it\'ll be several meters shorter due to the
rounding of the nose). So I figure that there are three decks.

The lowest deck has the engineering spaces in the center, and the
highest deck is the control room. Cargo, such as it is will go into the
lowest deck, and quarters should go on the middle deck. I can\'t be more
definite until I get the volume requirements for various things.

Grab the $100 PII 266 Celeron and overclock that baby on an ATX
motherboard. I recommend Abit.  The effective operating speed for

Now you know why TL changes are so infrequent. And in any case, I
rather expect that within a few TLs programs will be assembled the way
circuitry is, out of standard *known* reliable building blocks.

There are uses for larger displays. And keyboards do have inherent
advantages over handwriting recognition. 

So I expect that your personal computer may be worn on your body
somewhere. Partly for protection. You may have "glasses" with virtual
display capability built into them, and you may have a watch as a
simple i/o device (a few buttons, maybe a microphone, a simple display,
and an IR link). For more complex i/o, you\'d have an object about the
size of a PDA that can display larger amounts of data and recognize
drawings, shorthand, and handwritting. It\'ll likely have a scanner
built into one end so you can run it over a page, or drawings on a cave
wall.

And a "workstation" would be a keyboard, larger display, better camera,
and hardcopy output device that link via IR or cable to your personal
computer. It\'d also be the link to the data network. 

You\'d also be able to link to and control wall sized displays. 

Your personal system would carry your private *data* and maybe some
custom applications. Things like word processing, spread sheets, etc,
would be loaded and run from the network, with *tiny* usage charges. 
You could also add modules containing even "standard" applications if
you expect to spend a lot of time away from the network.

I suspect that most applications will *have* to have moved to the
equivalent of "ROM cartridges" long before even M:0, simply because of
all the hassles with viruses and the like.

GURPS uses Imperial (i.e., "American") units.  As of the playtest draft,
that was the standard for GT as well - damn it.  I\'ve never understood
SJGames fascination with an outmoded standard; it\'s one of the few things I
really don\'t like about GURPS.

YUCK!!!!!! Well in my book that is a big strike agin it. Somehow trying to figure

I can\'t get GIMP to work for me.  Course, I\'m using an antique that\'s been 
pushed to the max -- a 486slc2-66 with a mere 16 megs of RAM.  It\'s an old 
Evergreen motherboard, surplus when I got it 4 years ago.

*THAT* worked.

Now I know why the precompiled version didn\'t work for me -- incompatible libc.  RedHat went to glibc with 5.0 & I\'m still using 4.1 with some 4.2 additions.

This is only partly true.  we will eat anything *that hits the floor* on
the off chance that it *might* be food.  If it isn\'t, we can always
throw it back up later.

	How bout specialized life support equipment for Vargr craft that

Ford, NASA bring artificial intelligence to cars and trucks

Ford Motor Company News Release

DEARBORN, Mich. - Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and NASA\'s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory are bringing artificial intelligence to trucks
and cars. 

A new neural network computer chip that mimics the human mind
promises to reduce vehicle emissions and improve fuel economy by
monitoring fuel combustion. The neural network chip, designed by
computer scientists at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and
licensed by Ford Motor Company, has the potential to augment
current vehicle on-board diagnostic systems. The chip may diagnose
and control emissions behavior on a continuous basis. JPL and Ford
scientists contend that the chip represents the most significant
change in the way computing is done on vehicles since computers
were introduced into automobiles in the mid-1970\'s. "

Heh. Imagine if the AI improves over TLs to control more functions.

ObTrav:  While using a rented grav vehicle (or using their own)  on a 
hi-tech world which requires linking to a traffic control net, our
intrepid heros decide to swoop down on a rival megacorp\'s building
to break in and retrieve the info they\'ve been paid to get.
Unfortunately, the vehicle responds to the controls by saying,
"I\'m sorry, Dave, I\'m afraid I can\'t do that."

Hmmm...has anybody thought of what other applications "smart"
processors would logically be used for and actually used them in 
a campaign? If so, how did they work out during play?

	I don\'t think this is an accurate characterization of what Dave
said.  The Regency and the RC were not going to be "wrecked" by any 
means.  The EW was going to make psionics a more prominent part of the 
environment, which might cause some changes but there was by no means a 
plan to destroy the Regency.  The RC was also not going to be destroyed, 
though we can see from the "future retrospectives" in the TNE mainbook 
that the Star Vikings weren\'t going to be around in a few decades, having 
served their purpose.  As for the "psionic knights" this was just short 
hand for the descedents of the Regency psions and Zho nobles.  If you 
look at the description of them in the RSB they both have strong moral 
codes and an even stronger sense of obligation to society.  The "knight" 
description was just an off-hand comment intended to quickly convey this 
general idea.

I once played with a concept where every software based item was available in
proprietary types A B (and sometimes C). Not only did thee players have the
choice of buying A or B (or were saddled with it based on a die roll for items
they already had). We also had a list of which version the Scouts, Marines,
Navy, and Army used.

It added lots of complexity but not a lot of fun.

Whew!  For a second there I thought Rob was stepping down.

Let\'s take this opportunity to praise Rob for his behind-the-scenes work
keeping the Traveller mailing list up and relatively free of non-traveller
spam (I think its outside his mandate to keep the list free of Traveller
spam)!

Thanks Rob!

Several actually.

I\'ll send a copy of mine to Dusty under seperate cover.  I\'ll let others
reply with theirs as they wish.

A bunch of these were collected on the HIWG-CD, by the way.

Mine is Excel 5.0 compatible.  Other requests welcome.

I saw nothing indicating the "wreckage" of the Regency and RC.  Indeed there\'s
a "flowering" of psionics of some kind (and a resultant change of culture),
but we were told about a "future project" that would be about a time when the
effects of the Wave were finally going away (and sophonts were still wondering

It wasn\'t on topic.  In fact, Dave said he could not properly go through teh
details since he was hoping on finding a way to "do it right" and get

date yet?"

"They told us that it will be shipping 29 Sep."

(\'They\' was missing a bit of context, because I didn\'t know it at

"Which means you should be seeing it the first or second week in
Oct."

"Well, since the 29th is Friday, ..."

(It\'s not - it\'s Tuesday.  But it didn\'t connect at the time)

"As long as they don\'t trash you like they did on the IG prods."

"Not likely - we get it directly from SJG."

(The context has been filled in!)

"Cool.  I\'ll be looking for it."

So there you have it - the unofficial official word is that GURPS
Traveller will be in your FLGS as soon after 29 Sep as you
usually see GURPS products after their ship date.

I suspect it uses American units, _not_ Imperial. The Imperial gallon, for
example, is larger than the American gallon. [1] So even if I were to dig
out my old pre-metric material, I\'d _still_ have to convert.  Fornicate.
Here we have a game, set years in the future, spanning the stars, and it\'s
written in the parochial units of a single country on Earth.

Think I may wait until Marc lines up another publisher. Can you imagine
the fun doing FFS and converting units all the time? 


[1] Historical aside: when the revolution came, the colonial merchants
started using the wine gallon for everything, disguising a change in price
(the gallon got smaller, the price stayed the same).

Insulating a _radiator_ is fairly pointless -- radiators don\'t do anything
except dump heat, so the net effect would be to just make the radiator less
effective, which isn\'t particularly useful.  However, simply insulating the
engine and detaching the radiators will cause the radiators not to dump heat,
which will have the net effect of causing the power plant to heat up until
either (a) it leaks enough heat through insulation to dump its heat output
anyway (this will probably have the side effect of cooking the crew), or (b) it
overheats (and, most likely, shuts down).

Assuming your goal is reducing your thermal signature, the only way to do this
over long periods of time is to reduce your heat production (by making your
power plant more efficient, or by reducing your power consumption).  For short
periods of time you can eliminate heat by dumping it into some form of chemical
heat sink, but at the power output of Traveller fusion reactors (and the
timeframe of Traveller space combat) this isn\'t really practical.

Shrug.  Presumably if you use G:Traveller you\'ll use G:Vehicles instead of
FF&S, and seeing as it uses american units there\'s no conversion issue.

For conversion, just use the simple conversion scheme:
1 yard = 1 meter
2 lb = 1 kilogram
1 ton = 1 metric ton

This is usually close enough for gaming purposes ;).

I like it and its certainly welcome.  But I\'m not sure I follow your meaning
of
"Native."  From the skill list and the description you give (quoted here:
"Many worlds are not up-to-date with the Imperial technology, and many
remain at a very low technological level. The inhabitants of these worlds are
a rough bunch.  Routine tasks: Hunting, fighting, surviving in the wilderness,
fail to understand technological items."), it sounds like you mean
hunter-gatherer types.

If that is what you mean, I would take out Broker, Medical, and maybe
Melee Combat (since that is fighting with rules), and add some of the
Charisma skills.

But when you get to the Medieval period, society gets much more complex
and divided, so a whole host of skills become available, and the idea of
careers starts with everything from Priests to Paupers.

Hmm.  I\'m getting an idea here.
Reworking the careers for TL 1 - 4.

Merchants, Mercenaries,
Nobles, Knaves
Sailors, Soldiers, Serfs, Scholars,
Priests, Paupers, Pirates
Bards, Rogues

Personally, I\'m all *for* tech being a \'speedbump\' PCs have to run over to get 
where they\'re going.  It allows them high tech, but lets the ref limit what 
they can do with it.  At the minimum, it can slow \'em down enough for the ref 
to figure out the next move to pull off on them.

IMTG right now, I\'m hearing a LOT of bitching that there\'s no state of the art 
military grade equipment availiable to the party.  IMNSFBHO, it keeps the 
party from pulling a \'glass beads or bullets\' scenario in their dealings with 
the locals.  <grin>

No, actually, I\'ve got a pesky scout ship with a watchdog program electrifying the
hull and pointing it\'s laser at me. It\'s in a pressurized bay with (theoretically)
nobody on board (the pilot was killed earlier).  I\'d like to salvage it so blowing
it up isn\'t too productive.

So again, I ask, what would happen if your radiators stopped working? How long
would it take? Would the computer "normally" power down the system or just let the
whole thing blow?  If it did blow what would be the effects (in a pressurized bay)?

My prelimanary work seems to indecate that Perp decks are better suite to
LARGE ships (as was discussed in this thread earlier). On a 2-400 sdt
freighter to keep it anythisng other than a flat box (not very stream lined
if flown as a true perp decked ship) then there must be several decks or one
large TALL cargo bay. Either way it seems very awkward to load without major
in-ship handling equipment.

As I meMike Peters
Letterworks@CITNET.com
"Help Wanted: Telepath, You know where to apply!"  unknown, bumper
sticker.ntioned on the Deckplan list.. one answer is a ship designed to
travel with decks parallel in atmosphere and perp in space (a design I\'m
working on, basically using contra-grav for in atmos flight, with thruster
plates on the belly, has the advantage of more speed in space with less
compensators... a marginal savings in space/mass at best). Another Idea
occured that I\'m kicking around. If the ship was designed to land in water,
with the cargo doors high on the hull and the cargo lowered into it (much
like surface ships do today) it could work, as long as the cargo master
packed the hold in an "unloading order", doesn\'t say much for handling fees
though, since the hold would have to be re-packed at every stop.

Of course all of this is refering to containerized cargo. Loose cargo MIGHT
be easier to shift around but I doubt it. Large warehouse style floor spaces
seem to be the real answer or, as I usually design, multiple long bays
approx one or two container lengths (4 , 1.5 m, squares deep) deep along the
ship\'s sides. This allows access to the to the containers by vehicles or
cranes at the ports without much inship movement.

Be interested in seeing other peoples answers to these problems, however,
there is probably something I\'m not seeing.

Orbit to surface vehicle : mission profile is to land unpowered and then
return to orbit.
This vehicle lacks the delta-V (3078m/s) to reach escape velocity from a
body much larger than Luna.

ii. Fission power.
The FF&S rules are broken regarding fuel consumption. Increased energy
density is an
acceptable compromise re tech level improvement.
I have selected the value of 270kg uranium per MWe per year after
referring to a textbook of nuclear engineering. [With breeder reactors
and tightly closed fuel cycles, the amount required to refuel drops to
about 3kg / MWe / yr ; U-Pu recycling (using \'spent\' fuel) halves the
new uranium requirement].
It assumes an installation with conventional heat exchangers eg. steam
or gas or molten sodium driven. Efficiency of these heat exchangers is
rated at about 90% (!).
Therefore, there is a multiplier for thermionic (direct electric power
generation) reactors, as they\'re aren\'t as efficient.

Tech Level          Thermionic Efficiency      Fuel Consumption X
6                         10%                                9
7                         20%                                4.5
8                         40%                                2.25
9                         60%                                1.5
10                       90%                                1
(thermionic fusion plants are introduced at TL 10)

Fuel : elemental uranium has a density of 20 t/m3, but tends to expand
in the reactor.
I prefer to use salts IMTU (carbide or nitride) as this problem is
avoided.
Mass is increased by 1.05 (UC) or 1.12 (UN2) ; volume is 10t/m3

Not impossible. I wasn\'t overly impressed by everything from Hard Times

Howling Wilderness, and didn\'t want to waste it. So I might have been
predisposed to assume that the EQ would have brought the same kind of
disruption to the ex-imperium that it did to the Zhos.

Suppose a world in TL 6-8 wishes to build PDM for its pown protection.
What warheads can it use.  Suposing that only nuclear weapons are

suggest some sort of MIV warhead designed to bracket the offending

each boosted into an appropriate pattern coupled to a ground based or

Pretty close, actually.
.38 ammo = 9 X 29mm, 300J (factory load) : ca. 17g per round.
Barrel = rifled : 5, 10 or 15cm (2/4/6 inches) - 100/200/300g
Receiver = double action revolver-4
Receiver length = 0.55 X sqrt (300) = 9.5cm, mass 0.375kg (light).
Pistol grip 0.2kg (!)
Overall length : pretty close, if you include grip length in receiver
length.
Overall weight : pretty close - if you ignore the grip mass. Dead on if
you divide grip mass by 3 (I\'m comparing with S&W Model 60 - 2" barrel).

FF&S (2) falls down with box magazines.
The example pistol (supposed to be modelled on the .45 ACP) is just
under a foot long, about three inches longer than the real thing -
harder to conceal!.

Actions :-
- - divide pistol grip masses by 3.
- - maximum receiver length is quadruple cartridge length for all weapons.
No increase in length for box (or other) magazines.
- - minimum receiver length is based on the FF&S formula using the
following fudge factors:-

receiver length = tech mod X sqrt(kinetic energy)
TL       mod
4-5       0.45
6-7       0.40
8-9       0.35
10+      0.30

These little fixes seem to cover most of the weapon types seen in a
\'Guns and Ammo\' annual, say.

FF&S needs fixing : but there\'s a number of things in Traveller that
need buffing up. It\'s still the best science fiction RPG around, though.

I mean any tribal culture, up to and including the barbarian types on a
medieval world. Broker is used for bartering, Melee combat is described as
armed melee using other weapons than blades (ie clubs, axes etc). Medical
is included to represent herbal cures and such.

Yes, that should also be done. The \'Native\' career was created for a
character one of my players created just yesterday.

I will be looking at these types of careers as well as creating a few more
modern careers that I feel are missing, like Miner.

Do I break any laws if I place careers from the rulebook on the web? If I
make changes to them and place them there?

Firstly, commiserations.
Analysis time :-

Traveller power plants are about 1.5% efficient (fusion) as written.
This means that 66.67 X the power output is being bled out through the
radiators, assuming perfect radiator efficiency. Actually, most of it
leaves via designated radiator area, the rest (10%) through the rest of
the hull.
For a type S scout :- roughly 28m3 plant from TL 9-12, which is 56MW.
Heat loss = 3733 MW (!) - nearly 12MW per square metre of surface area,
assuming typical wedge configuration.

Stephan-Boltzmann equation :
radiation intensity = emissivity X sigma X (temperature)^4
watts per m2 varies with fourth power of absolute temperature (Kelvin)
sigma = 5.67 X 10^(-8) W/m^2/K^4
emissivity = 0 to 1 (perfect black body radiator) : varies with object.
Let\'s try 0.5

Heat loss, W/m2           surface temperature (Kelvin)
6 million                       3814 - 3541 Celsius. Very few things are
solid at this temp.
3 million                       3207 - 2934. Ditto
1.5 million                    2697 - 2424. Steel is molten.
Etc.

The bay\'s structure had better be over-engineered (increased pressure
from the rapidly heated air within). An explosion would be disastrous.
Your suit\'s cooling systems have to be up to scratch too - the area is
hotter than a steelworks and a lot less friendly.
Ultimately the waste heat would melt the hull of the ship and the walls
of the bay.
The superheated air would cause most familiar objects to burst into
flame.
Long before that, though the immediate vicinity would not be readily
habitable.

If the (Virus-ridden) ship has intact sensors and isn\'t suicidal, it
will eventually shut down.
The ultimate limit is the hull\'s melting point....
Ordinarily, the ship\'s computer would be \'watching\' the temperature,
etc. really closely.

This is a little extreme, I must admit.
The ship is on its landing legs with only enough power plant ticking
over to run the electric field, the laser, computer, and sensors, I
would suspect.
You would have a long time to wait blocking the radiators.
Guesstimate the likely heat emitted with the data above.

My plan :-
Blind it, pull its teeth, and ground the hull to the body of the
surrounding ship.
Hope your suit\'s insulated....

The Iron Duke Class were one of the earilest examples of
the classic Terran Ship of the Line (the first to be 
fitted with thrust plates) and even though it was a 
rapidly outclassed in terms of both size and power, the 
class exhibited most of the common features of the type; 
the large (41,000 Mj in this case) spinal particle 
accelerator, wedge hull form, extreme automation
to reduce the crew requirements, extensive backup 
electronics and a heavy point defence laser battery. The 
Iron Dukes were designed shortly before the start of the 
2nd Interstellar War and formed the backbone of the 
Terran fleet during the 2nd War and early 3rd War. In 
total 185 examples of the class were built, and though 
the class suffered heavily with the wholesale scrappings
that followed the 3rd War, some examples survived in 
auxilary roles for many years. The longest serving was 
the Hiei which survived as a guardship at Hades until 
2402 AD.

The most famous example of the class was the Agamemnon 
on which the mysterious Lord Nelson incident occured. 
The Agamemnon was a reserve squadron flagship during the 
critical Battle of Junction in 2152 AD. During the battle
the Vilani broke through the Terran line and attacked 
the reserve; and the Agamemnon was struck by a spread of 
Vilani missiles which damaged the ship\'s control systems 
and killed or injured most of the bridge crew. At this 
point the "ghost" of Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson (1758 
AD - 1805 AD) "appeared" on the ship\'s bridge. He 
exhorted the crew to attack the Vilani centre. Against
all naval doctrine of the time, the senior surviving 
officer (Leftenant Pi Yu) choose to follow this course 
of action. The result was that against all expectations 
the reserve smashed the Vilani breakthrough and turned 
the tide of the battle in the Terrans favour.

The incident has thus far defied explaination. The 
ship\'s internal bridge sensors were offline due to 
battle damage at the time, so no accurate independent 
record exists, but the incident was confirmed after the 
battle by the Agamemnon\'s surviving bridge crew (some 17 
individuals). It is known that immediately prior to the 
incident the ship\'s jump grid had accidentally 
discharged due to the damage sustained. The most 
commonly accepted explaination is a mass hystereical 
delusion brought on by combat stress and the jump grid 
discharge; however the incident still remains a 
tantalising mystery and is the subject of much popular 
debate.

The Agamemnon herself suffered severe damage during the 
battle, and though she was repaired, she was never again 
employed in frontline serivce. She served as a convoy 
escort until the end of the 3rd War and was then assigned
as a colonial guardship at Midway until 2172 AD when she 
was designated as an escort for the long range 
colonisation program. The Agamemnon left for the rim in 
2177 AD and her ultimate fate is unknown.

I was wondering about breeder reactors too.  Another case of real world tech
outdoing Traveller tech.  I saw a show where they actually solved all the
problems but funding was cancelled anyway.  Meltdowns were averted by
allowing the material to expand.  They used various salts to reconstitute
the nuclear waste.  What little waste was left was used medically as
isotopes.

Can you point me in the direction of some information on this?  It sounds
neat, and the whole fusion powered steam turbine generator seems laughable
at high tech levels.

Life support... Are these T4 specs?  I feel so out of the loop.  How much
does 60 Person-years of food weigh?  I was going for completely recycling
the habitat so that it could be left at Jupiter as a colony base thing.

Heh... when you concider the size of the habitat ring, this cargo hold is a

Note that a ship produces this much heat regardless of whether the radiators are blocked
or not.  The radiators just gives the heat a more direct way out into the bay (or
space).  Since the bay is cabable of sustaining the ship as it is indefinitely, the bay
is therefore able to deal with that much heat be it from the radiators or the whole
hull.  Gumming up the radiators will force the heat to travel through the ship
(engineering) before reaching the bay.

Like I said, the heat is going to reach the air in any case.  Since the bay hasn\'t blown
up yet, we can assume it can take it.  Maybe not a ship melting through the deck, but
pressure increased heated air won\'t be the problem.

At what point would the generator blow?  Once it stops producing power (because its blown
into tiny scraps) the reactor would lose containment and if I\'m to believe the scuttlebut
on the list, a fusion reaction can\'t be maintained without pressure.  Probably resulting
in a relatively minor explosion as the reactor fuel combines with the air onboard.
Methinks it would be best to depressurize the bay before pulling this stunt or the liquid
hydrogen in the tanks could touch off.

Well, I suppose we could continue on our cruise.  I had intended to return to this base
after the next stop...  That should give the ship some time to die.

What would be reasonable points to shut down?  Inhospitable temperatures for humans?
Inhospitable temperatures for computers?  Physical breakdown of power plant?

I figured it would take a while.  I intended to throw a grounding strap across the hull
to force it to produce more power.  Maybe I can sell the power to the locals...

Actually, that was the first plan.  I was thinking about constructing a sort of Farraday
shell and attaching it to the hull away from the laser.  In theory (could be completely
mistaken) the electricity would flow on the outside of the shell leaving the interior
relatively safe to cut into with torches.  Plus the electrical field would shield the
workers from the sensors.  Kinda like a leach with its numbing saliva.  The radiator deal
is more like an infection.

That\'s not the problem I have with the picture. My problem is that most
K\'Kree gets seriously annoyed when breathing the same air as meateaters.
This includes omnivores who have eaten meat within the last week. So for
a K\'Kree to calmly enjoy a few brewskies while seated in the same room as
a bunch of meat-eaters, you need a seriously atypical K\'Kree.

Of course, there\'s nothing to say you can\'t have a seriously atypical
K\'Kree. As long as he keeps away from all normal K\'Kree, that is...

(Or perhaps it is the carnivores in the picture that are seriously atypical.
Perhaps every patron in the bar is a vegetarian).

Broker is as applicable to trading chickens for grain as it is for trading
starship parts for credits. It\'s just the art of getting a good deal.

Melee Combat is the skill of fighting with spears, clubs, and other
non-sword weapons. Certainly available at TL 0 and 1. There is nothing in
the description about \'fighting with rules\'. What kind of rules were you
considering?

I can\'t imagine why you would recomend removing the Charisma skills.
People at TL 0 and 1 have to deal with each other just as any other
society. Actually there aren\'t any Charisma skills (in the T4 sense) on
the list anyway.

Could you elaborate on why you made these comments? I\'m interested in your
take on this.

I\'m more afraid of this:

There is nothing in the G:T TNS that says there is not a Project Longbow,
as a matter of fact the thing is Pre-1116.  If so, does that mean that
Strephon has made contact with the "Empress"?

If so, then we shall meet the Wave in 100 yrs or so.  And we KNOW what
happens to the Zhodani!
In the G:T timline there may still be an Imperium by 1205.  Imagine what
could happen in the Marches by that time.  Will we take over some Zho
space?  Will they invade the Marches? (CRAZY Zho psion commandoes?)  Will
there be a very nasty 6th FW?  Who knows...

Be afraid...

Be VERY afraid...

Well, there is trading and then there is brokering.
T4 Broker: "The know-how to find lower prices when purchasing goods,
then quickly locate buyers for the items at higher prices . . ."

T4 Trader: "The ability to identify the best cargos to carry from one world to
another . . . it improves one\'s ability to estimate the resale value of items in
the
trade and commerce rules . . ."

If you\'ve got to choose one of these somewhat overlapping skills, I would
choose Trader, but even then I\'d probably allow it only as a default skill.
Ideally, I would add a skill "Barter."  But in the interest of keeping the
skill list manageable, I would use Trader as a substitute for Barter.
Besides, IMO, Broker presupposes existing markets and probably
multiple markets and vendors.

Regardless, Spacejens has said that he is using Broker to reflect
bartering, which makes perfect sense with that explanation.

Whoops.  I was looking at the T4.1 (T5) beta materials (which I like much
better than T4).  In those, Melee is hand-to-hand with rules, essentially.
Boxing, wrestling, and martial arts are given as examples (though I
assume the only the "sport" martial arts like Judo, Karate, and
Tae-Kwon-Do are being referred.to as opposed to the non-sporting forms).
I think that might be a loophole in the T4.1 stuff, i.e., no provision for non-
blade or gun weapon combat.  I\'ll have to check again.

That was my point.  I recommended _adding_ more of them.
And I\'d probably throw in Intimidation as well.

I hope that was satisfactory.

What\'s wrong with "Brawling" skill for normal hand-to-hand, with combat
capable styles being reflected as higher levels of brawling and
non-combat styles (sport, demonstration, excercise, etc.) being
represented by "special" skills? Special, like Art skills, Hobby skills,
things like that that usually have little effect on the game but add color.

"Melee" I\'ve always associated with armed combat (knights with pointy
things and such) - probably due to my early exposure to TSR\'s stuff.
Defining Melee skill in T5 as formal unarmed combat techniques
seems confusing to someone like me, when I list Melee skills in my
brain I think Sword, Spear, Club instead of Karate, Jujitsu, Akido.

Well, assuming that the watchdog program at least resembles having brains, it
will run the reactor only at sufficient power to account for its required
energy output (which is virtually nil if you aren\'t actually annoying it).  As
such, it can probably retain its current configuration virtually indefinately. 
However, blowing the radiators off has a reasonable chance to cause the power
plant to shut down (it will probably cause a coolant leak, which will trigger a
shutdown unless the system is designed to ignore heat problems, in which case
it will eventually destroy the power plant).

The effects of the power plant overheating in the bay are relatively minor
compared to the effects of the ship deciding to pop off a few shots with a
starship-grade laser.

> Stutterwarp

I would gently point out that in my non-canon Traveller Universe:

1) the Solomani, Kafers and others all invented Stutterwarp 4000 years ago,
2) Stutterwarp (IMTU) has a performance of "jump-1" per month
2a) jump-1 need not be the samee as a parsec IYTU
3) Stutterwarp is great for ore carriers and the like as there is no
   jump fuel to take up space and SW is similar cost to Jump Drives
4) IMTU stutterwarp is one of two "frac c" drives for moving between planets

In your traveller Universe, you appear to have decided that SW has a 
performance advantage over Jump drive.  Is the advantage strategic (faster 
travel between systems), tactical (faster speed ship combat), both or 
something else.  The "best" way forward is always going to be matter of 
opinion, because who knows how the RC, bad guy PE etc will respond.  

1) Why not run a PE campaign in parallel to get a better picture of the 
forces involved in the conflict let players of the various factions decide 
what to do?

2) Keep a lid on it and buy up all the Tantalum mines you can find.  Then 
sell the idea to the Regency.

3) Build a series of SW scout ships that can see squadrons of bad guys jump 
out, calculate where they are going, run ahead of them and broadcast a 
warning to the RC or other defenders.  After a few of these, people will sit 
up and take notice of your superior tech and will be desparate to get hold of 
it.  They may use money or force.  As long as your scouts stay close enough 
to the FTL limit they will never be caught.

4) use 2 and 3.  With the bad guys suffering because of your (relatively 
cheap) scouts giving a huge intelligent edge to the RC they should suffer 
while you negotiate for tantalum mines, salvage rights on damaged bad guy 
ships and so on.

5) Threaten to give the secret of the tech to the opponent of anyone who 
attacks your bases (best combines with 3).

The other trick - if you know where your enemy is - is to use only the
radiators on the far side of your hull, so the waste heat goes away from 
them. In most combat situations Traveller ships are implicitly doing
this; more advanced levels of masking do it more effectively (dumping the
heat into narrower cones, etc.)

If the ship has masking it has a lot of redundant radiator capability
(especially on the ground, where it can cool itself through air convection.)
You\'d need some serious insulator, too - radiators run at up to 2000 K 
depending on the ship design. As you cover more radiators the ship would
have to reduce power output until it shut down. A sensible ship would do this
automatically; a poorly-designed ship would heat up until circuits 
started failing, including the computer; referees discretion whether the
computer running things like the power plant magnetic confinement would fail,
or the superconducting magnets for said confinement, resulting in a loss
of power plant plasma confinement.

In a "realistic" world, this just shuts down the power plant (possibly 
melting the inside walls a little); in a more cinematic world it might
blow the hwole plant.

the efficiency just means only 1.5% of the hydrogen is properly burned 
(possibly because only the natural deuterium burns, or because its 
inefficient to recycle the hydrogen in partially-burned fuel because it 
contains too much tritium, or because it gets vented to space after running

The radiator sizes in FFS2 assume soemthing closer to 90% efficiency 
(mildly unrealistic, admittedly) for TL12 reactors, which then run their
radiators at 1000 - 2000 K. This makes large ships at least vaguely
plausible - if we use Robert\'s numbers, which have a normal scout
radiating 4000 MW, big ships are impossible.

The biggest inaccuracies in FFS1\'s small arms sequences are to do with the
receivers. Firstly they get too heavy with high power rounds, especially
for bolt actions, and secondly the minimum length rule (15cm longer than
the cartrige for box mags, etc) is clearly just not realistic (again most
obvious with bolt actions). A more minor issue is that while receiver
weight drops relatively slow by TL (which is reflected in the rules) length
should drop much faster, and in actual fact has more to do with the
designer\'s fancy than any particular Tl limitations. Many SMGs have
receiver that are only about twice as long as the ammo because most of the
mechanism is alongside the barrel e.g. the Beretta M12.

THere\'s really not much that a TL6-7 world can do, unfortunately, 
except against an ambushed opponent or one in the atmosphere or (at best)
low orbit. A TL-6 or 7 system will end up with only enough delta-V to t
go perhaps 9 km/s - four hours to travel on BL hex. In the same time even
a Fat Trader can travel fourty hexes from a standing start - fairly easy to
get out of the way. (Practically, since any imagineable warhead would only
have a few km of kill radius, is can just sidestep a little; you\'d need
millions of warheads to blanket a whole hex.) Such missiles are also sitting
ducks for lasers - even the most primitive laser should be able to kill them
as fast as it can fire (twenty per hour for a cheap civilian model,
hundreds or thousands per hour for a military one.) 

This is one of those things that (if you can) it\'s always better to buy even
a handful of imported systems rather than rely on indigenous technology.

If you don\'t have access to imported systems, or det-laser warheads of 
ones own, the only real option is ambush - hide weapons in apparently
civilian satellites, carry out massive attacks on people in very low
orbits, etc. Or wait until they enter the atmosphere.

Nothing wrong with it at all. I think it was merely a minor oversight.

I never really liked having one skill (Melee) to encompass every handheld
weapon beyond sword and the knife.  But neither do I want Glaive,
Flail, Mace, etc. In keeping with the broad nature of Sword, Knife, and
Throwing, how about adding just
Spear (for pointy sticks, polearms, haulberk, etc.), and
Club (for things you swing like axes, hammers, flails, chair legs, etc.).

These would be relative uncommon in high TL societies, but would give
a nice additional depth to more primitive cultures.

Or, just use MT\'s Blade Combat cascade with (axe, cudgel, foil,
large blade, polearm, small blade).  [I just got MT so I\'m not sure
how much I like it compared to other iterations yet].

	They also provide better protection ... 

	For example, composite laminate has a toughness/mass ratio (FF&S1,
because that\'s what\'s handy) of 0.75, and a toughness/price ratio of
750.  Compare that to Superdense, which has a mass ratio of 0.93 (you
get 24% more protection per unit mass) and a price ratio of 1000 (you
get 33% more protection per unit cost).

	For something where you\'re mass limited, the *same* amount of mass
buys you more protection. If you\'re price limited, the *same* money
buys you more protection. Even volumewise, you get more protection...

	The real question is, why would you use composite laminate?  Unless
that\'s all you have available at your TL ...

A launch tube enables you to launch small craft quickly (one craft every
three minutes, as opposed to one craft every thirty minutes for each
launch port).  You give up volume, and get to keep hull area, for
similar launch rates (it would take ten launch ports, each with a
certain surface area, to equal one launch tube, with the same area as
two launch ports).  See FF&S v2, page 14, for further details.

Because other materials provide more efficient armor protection.  For
instance, let\'s compare composite laminate (probably similar to Chobham
or similar armors found on such tanks as Challenger and the M1 Abrams)
with Superdense (the most common starship hull material, IMTU).  Assume
the minimum Armor rating (Ar) required for a spacecraft, Ar 20 (FF&S,
pg. 64), on a 100 Td sphere hull.

MATERIAL    TOUGHNESS  DENSITY	THICK/Ar 20  VOLUME/Ar 20  MASS/Ar 20
Laminate    08.57      08	2.33 cm	     32.62 m^3	   260.96 tons	
Superdense  20.0       15	1.00 cm	     14.00 m^3	   210.00 tons

As the ratio of toughness to density increases, the advantage increases
as well.

The best place to use low-density materials is on planet-bound vehicles,
where there is no minimum Armor rating, just a minimum material
thickness of .25 cm.

Doing fairly well. I\'ve got a 386dx-?? acting as a more or less
dedicated server (with a about a gig worth of drives attached), a
386sx-33 acting as a mostly dedicated communications server (it does
the uucp and fidonet connections), and the 386sx-40 has the good video
card and the sound card. And they all have cheap ethernet cards.

So rather than multi-task one computer, I use multiple, networked
computers. :-)

Alas, a foot is ~3.1 decimeters.  A decimeter is a bit under 4 inches.
Doesn\'t work well. 

I\'ve found that 10ft = 1 meter is *more* than close enough for most
purposes. (10 ft = 120 in = 304.8 cm = 3.048 m,  3.048/3 = 1.016, so
it\'s 1.6% too big)

Reminds me of the "discussion" about the hovertanks in Hammer\'s
Slammers in a another newsgroup. So idiot thought that it\'d only take a
*little* extra power to make the tanks fly (wrong, ground effect takes
a *lot* less power than it would take to "hover" due to pure thrust).
And to help with the power problem, he proposed using *titanium*
instead of iridium for the tank hulls. 

I had to explain that it\'d only take *one* powergun hit to ignite such
a hull. And that once ignited, it\'d take an act of god to extinguish
the fire. Folks here in Oregon got a good taste of that a few days ago
when a metal fab outfit caught fire. They had to let the titanium stock
burn out.

Titanium is a *wonderful* metal. As long as you don\'t let it ignite.
After that, forget it. It will burn in pure nitrogen. Once burning,
it\'ll extract the oxygen from *concrete* to keep burning!

Hmmm, maybe there\'s a Trav scenario in this. Some merc group buys some
cheap APCs and then discovers that they are cheap because someone had
the bright idea of using *titanium* for armor. Sheer suicide in a
combat environment that has plasma/fusion guns, high energy lasers, and
the occasional PAW.

They might actually not figure it out until one gets hit in combat and
proceeds to turn into the world\'s biggest "magnesium" flare!

Check out the planetr destroyers in "Dark Star" (the book or the
movie). AI\'s with a built-in suicide drive. It\'s their goal to die
gloriously by exploding. And the folks on the ship have to try talking
one *out* of detonating when it\'s accidentally activated in the missile

Well, you can neutralize the laser by applying "paint" to the exit
optics. If the computer can tell that they\'ve gotten coated with
something, it can\'t fire the laser. If it can\'t tell, the beam will
cause ther coating to vaporize explosively, mangling the optics rather
nicely. It\'s a good good for a paintball gun. :-)

And as far as electrifying the hull goes, big deal. Your suit is
insulated. The ship *can\'t* zap you unless you are contacting *both* it
*and* something that isn\'t charged. Also, the ship can\'t place all that
high a charge on it\'s hull, because there\'s no "ground" available.

Frankly, the radiator performance is *already* going to be seriously
degraded because they\'ll be heating the *air* in the bay. This carries
away heat faster, but only until all the air in the bay reaches the
temp of the radiators. Also, the radiators are designed to radiate heat
to empty space (effective temp 3k). In that bay, the walls are likely
at something approaching room temp (300k). That, too will massively
degrade the performance of the radiators. 

Hit them with a coat of something that\'s reflective at the right
wavelengths *and* that won\'t decompose at the red heat the radiators
operate at, and they are pretty well screwed. 

I can\'t see a ship\'s computer being programmed to allow it to do
something that will damage the ship severely. So without a manual
override, I\'d say the ship *has* to shut down. And frankly, if the bay
can handle the air temp reaching hundreds of degrees, you may not
*need* to do anything else to make the ship shut down its systems.

ps. You will note from the above that ships that dock *internally*
can\'t use their power plants except at *very* minimal power. And ships
landed on a planet\'s surface are going to create a *lot* of hot air if
they run their power plants at any sort of power level.

This is one of the reasons that once landed or docked, you switch to an
*external* power feed, and only keep an auxilary generator powerful
enough to "bootstrap" the main system going (and you only do that if
you are paranoid).

In space the blast effects from nukes are virtually non-existent. 

You see, almost all the energy (99%? more?) in a nuke comes out in the
form of soft X-rays. In an atmosphere, these get absorbed within a few
meters by the *air*. Said air gets superheated and creates both the
"thermal flash" and the blast wave.

In space, you just get these *incredible* blasts of X-rays. If the
blast is close enough, enough may be absorbed by the hull to cause
portions to melt or even vaporize. And any that pentrate the hull are a
major radiation hazard.

Matter of fact, the lethal radius for a multimegaton weapon in space is
*hundreds* of thousands of KM for *unshielded* personnel. 

But ships tend to be well shielded.

What you are more likely to do is rig the warheads to convert as much
of the blast energy as possible into something that moves "shrapnel".

There\'s a design for this from rec.arts.sf.science a few years back.
Essentially, you cover the bomb with a layer of styrofoam. This is both
an excellent absorber of X-rays, but also vaporizes nicely. You then
place a layer of "BBs" over this. The designer figured you\'d be able to
boost the BBs to several percent of c!

It\'s also possible, by clever design to get the X-rays (and thus the
BBs) to be emitted all in more or less the same direction. This gives
you a "nuclear shotgun" and is even better.

Get a warhead like that to go off near a ship, and it\'s going to hurt.
The problem is getting it close enough without it being destroyed first.

They might work as mines. I\'d envision a small (less than a cubic
meter) well stealthed device in the kiloton range firing off a bunch of
near c BBs when triggered.

That\'s kind of the setup I\'m thinking of doing; a bunch of semidecked Pent 
boxxes networked together, with this old 486slc2-66 playing firewall.  Looks 
like me & the roomie are both gonna need workstations here, and his will 
pretty much have to be a Win95 boxx due to some of the \'ware he\'ll need to 
run.  <shrug>

They also have more toughness per cm of thickness, and toughness is what

10ft = 1 meter is *not* 1.6% too big, it is about three times as big, or
200% bigger than it should be. I do not understand why you divide by three
in your calculation.

3ft is about 0.9 meters, which is a quite good approximation. When
roleplaying (only occassion where I encounter Imperial measurements) I use
1ft = 0.3 meters, which is very close to the real value.

Let\'s face it, some of us gringos have a *helluva* time with metric.

Fortunately, I\'m not one of them.  <grin>

Fair enough.
I just think that we could probably get better performance out of the
reactor.
(If manipulating gravity is easy, then this shouldn\'t be too difficult!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
:-)
Contemporary fission plants (viz. TL 6-7 designs!) run at about 30%
fission to electricity efficiency (25 to 33%), and proposed breeder designs
eg. molten salt and gas cooled fast breeders could get above 45%. (48-50%
appears to be the upper limit).

<P>Fuse the deuterium (\'natural\' v. manufactured matters little on the
atomic scale in hot, dense plasma), skim off the tritium (potentially very
energy-intensive - it is better to fuse it, as D-T fusion yields more energy
- - 17.6MeV or 0.38% mass conversion vs. D-D\'s average 3.6MeV or 0.1%).
Spitting it out the back of the ship is just wasteful, MHD turbine
or no. It\'s probably not too
stealthy either, with all that hot, charged stuff flying about (implications
for starship combat?). However, it\'s a good way of removing \'waste\' heat.

<P>Another implication for accumulating tritium - proliferation of fusion
weapon ready material.
Tritium is too precious to waste, and potentially too deadly to have
on the open market. (sociopaths in their basements building laser-triggered
suitcase fusion bombs....)
It\'s a better thing if the stuff is \'burned\'. Optionally, it may enable
frequent inspection of fusion piles by oversight authorities - ??not compatible
with \'Yanks in Space\'??
<BLOCKQUOTE TYPE=CITE>
<PRE>The radiator sizes in FFS2 assume soemthing closer to 90% efficiency&nbsp;
(mildly unrealistic, admittedly) for TL12 reactors, which then run their
radiators at 1000 - 2000 K. This makes large ships at least vaguely
plausible - if we use Robert\'s numbers, which have a normal scout
radiating 4000 MW, big ships are impossible.</PRE>

&nbsp;
I agree wholeheartedly with the paragraph above.

<P>Big ships definitely exist in Traveller, so can we fix things without
too many handwaves?
Fusion plants may run like fission ones, where fuel economy is very
dependent on how tight you make your fuel cycles.

<P>I\'m sorry if I\'m sounding like some sort of evangelist, but I\'m extrapolating
current environmental concern trends into my Traveller universe.
Fusion will have to be very, very clean to be accepted by the Greenies
of the far future...

You see, almost all the energy (99%? more?) in a nuke comes out in the
form of soft X-rays. In an atmosphere, these get absorbed within a few
meters by the *air*. Said air gets superheated and creates both the
"thermal flash" and the blast wave.

I thought a properly constructed nuke in space could give you a

Umm, 9 km/s is about 30 Mm/h (a BL hex an hour, about half a G-turn).
A fat trader could manage three hexes at most in that time.  As a PDM,
you could use it to mine the area near a planet after an enemy is seen
emerging at the jump limit.  Are det-lasers or other reasonable anti-
starship missile warheads available at tech-7?

	And the easiest way for either party to use either system is to use the
system and not try to make a comparison between them. IMHO the biggest
mistake we can made here is to try to equate the two systems instead of
flat out learning/adopting one or the other as the standard. I too was
lucky in that I found metric to be a better unit to work with some time
before it was introduced into our country.

1) Simply use FF&S2 data in the TNE format...
2) Convert (or try to convert) the FF&S2 data to FF&S1, and then use the TNE
format...

The first choice has the strength of being moderately simple. However, it
does meant that ships designed with my sheet will be grossly incompatable
with TNE designed ships. This may or may not be a problem - if you simply
want to use your new FF&S2 designs in BL or BR, this may be the way to go.

The second choice is much more complicated, and thus will take me longer. In
addition, I\'m not even sure that it can be done, I\'ll have to talk to Guy,
Dave, and Bruce about it. If it can be done, it would have the benefit of
making your ships a bit more compatable with TNE designed ships (although I
sincerely doubt we can make them 100% compatable).

I would value everyone\'s opinion on these ideas...particularly those of you
who have been pestering, um, ah, politely requesting this feature :) (please
note the smiley)

A third posibility, of course, is to have a brand spanking new FF&S1
spreadsheet. I would take the existing sheet and alter it to be TNE
compatable, thus creating a new sheet. If there is a huge outcry for this, I
will consider it...but it would be the most time consuming choice of them
all, I think.

Thanks...

FYI: Also on the agenda due to requests are mixed TL weaponry.

I don\'t have a timetable for release yet...school, work, and family dictate
that I cannot spend 100% of my time on this :)

Actually, I learned metric from playing Traveller as a kid. And how to
count in hexadecimal too (the whole concept of non-base-ten number systems
really). Sure came in handy later in certain classes. While everyone else
was trying to figure out the basics of the units, I could just get on with
the work.  :)

design, large windows and ramp between the two levels - very different
from the more businesslike bridge decided on for the movie.

Is it my imagination, or was this art piece used as inspiration for the
bridge design and illustration for the _Donosev_ class Survey Cruiser

identical, and the seat designs seem the same as well.

Haven\'t seen this Alien art book in years, so can\'t check the artists -

the rest threw me.  In most Traveller that I have played (Original, Mega,
and TNE) they never mention Stutterwarp at all.  The only Traveller product
that does mention Stutterwarp is 2300, not really a part of the Traveller
universe that contains the other three.  As far as I know Stutterwarp was
never explained in any form that could have been used for Original
Traveller, or Mega-Traveller.
     The use of Stutterwarp as defined in FFS provides a significant
advance in both starship movement and tactical combat.  Our current ability
to crate Stutterwarp is very limited, in that we can not get it above
Efficiency 3.  Also in calculating Efficiency part of the equation is TL
+4, but we only get the benefit of 4 no TL adder.
     Our problem stems from the fact that we have only one small production
facility, only 18 Billion Credits of production capacity per month, and
there fore can only create a small number of ships at a time.  To
complicate matter further, it take a large amount of money to create a
starship even if the only things you\'re paying for are the labor and
materials.  So to make money we need to use a good portion of that
production facility to create ships for sale.  Also ships do not come off
the production line like candy bars, it takes us 1 month per MCr 100 of the
ships sale price to complete it.
     Now our opponents are the Regency, which has huge fleets, never mind
the full construction facilities of a Pre-colapse imperial sector, 3 to be
exact, and the Capellan Confederation which owns a subsector and another
half of one as well as all the production facilities that survived in that
region of space (four or five that we know of).  If we hadn\'t invested so
much time and effort setting up our production facility on this planet we
would more than likely leave.  If we did leave this would be the second
planet we\'ve had to evacuate.  The first was were we awakened to find the
system under the control of a Virus (Mother type who controlled several
ships and the scout base, as well as a pre-Virul AI gone nuts on the
planet) and had to leave to save our vessel.
     The Capellan Confederation had at one time captured our scientist and
forced him to work for them.  We rescued the man, but were unable to
destroy the prototype he was forced to build for them.  This means in the
very near future the very militaristic and land hungry Pocket Empire will
have in it\'s power ships able to destroy the Regency, regardless of the
home fleets.  On top of that the Regency passed some legislation to allow
them to extend the boarders so we are now inside the Regency proper.
There\'s more but I am tired of typing.  Leave it to say we are very much in
the pickle jar.

Actually, you do get an effect which resembles a shockwave -- the blast of
X-rays is not only extremely powerful, it is also extremely short in duration. 
The result is to _suddenly_ heat up the outer layer of any object exposed to
the blast, which will result in sudden thermal expansion, which then results in
a shockwave initiating at the surface of the solid and transmitting itself
through the surface.  This can reasonably cause damage to the frame of a
vehicle, or even cause it to shatter.

I learned the basics of it in school back in the 60\'s, when everybody thought the US was gonna go metric.  It got reinforced in my time in the Army.

I remember "The Snowbird Conspiricy" which dealt with a 300t scout ship,
but that is about it.

lars,

The hardback price is US$29.95, and projected availability is early in

In the US Army?  Since 1777.  You can\'t be too blind, but with my
uncorrected 20/60 vision I qualified as a sniper.  I went through several
pairs of issue "birth control" glasses (thick black plastic frames, plastic
lenses) while keeping a good pair of glasses for off-duty.

I was under the impression from reading "Survival Margin" that the Virus
project was a wartime inovation.  Dulinor\'s people had never heard of the
research station involved, nor did it show on any of the pre-War lists.

Maybe.  Hum, in US$ that would be about $300, I think.

Here are some things I\'d look at...

...the speed of the 486, you won\'t be happy with less than 100mhz and
133mhz would be better for development. I\'m guessing that the system you
are looking at is 66mhz, though, and this will be slow...but usable if
you don\'t overtax it.

...the size/quality of the monitor, 14" makes for a small screen when
using a GUI and a dot pitch greater than .28 will make for fuzzier
images than you\'d like. 
 
...the size of the hard drive, there is *never* enough room on one, but
if you intend to run Win9x then you should have at least a gig. 

To be honest, Rob, I don\'t know if you could get a satisfactory system
for 200 Canadian.

> 3) How much extra will a nice development environment run me?  Ideally >I\'d like Visual Pascal, except I don\'t think anyone makes it :-(

Delphi by Inprise (they use to be Borland) is what you\'re looking for.
It\'s Turbo Pascal 8 (Object Pascal) with a Visual RAD environment. If
you know pascal you\'ll like Delphi. Here are the system requirements for
Delphi 4:  Intel 486DX/66 MHz or higher, Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows
NT 4.0 (Service Pack 3), Memory 16Mb of RAM (32Mb or higher
recommended),60Mb hard disk space (compact install),CD-ROM drive,VGA or
higher resolution monitor,Mouse or other pointing device.

Of course, if you can find it Delphi 3 (or even 2) would be more than
enough to do what you want, cheaper and with smaller system
requirements.

You could also do your development in Java and get cross platform
compatability...<g>...something a non-Win9x person like me would like.

Marc, I don\'t know if you\'re reading this, but are you doing
anything to encourage the publication of Traveller-related
magazines by independant publishers? Is there anything we can
do as a group to encourage them?

Is there nobody knocking on your door wanting to put out a
fanzine, or is there some hang-up with licensing that\'s screwing
everything up?

Inquiring minds want to know...

I\'ll bet that the efforts that once went into Traveller-only fanzines
are now going into the great bunch of Traveller-oriented web
pages we\'ve got now. Total up the graphics, deckplans,
fleets, fiction, library entries and such that are on web pages now...
imagine how many fanzine issues they would fill if they were
published in that format. Now add in Andy\'s (and other\'s) spreadsheets,
sector generators like you and others have provided, reusable
clip art, etc. etc. etc....

It may be that the Traveller fanzine has seen it\'s day, to be replaced
by the Traveller web. Data presented as a growing body of data, all parts
(or most parts) continually and universally available, instead of
presented in monthly packages of limited-run editions.

I\'ve seen the whole range of quality on Traveller web pages.
Good ideas with poor presentation, poor ideas with good clip art,
some pages that are top quality from start to finish and make you
think you\'ve wandered into TAS\'s own library system. I think a good
look at the runs of most of the paper fanzines will find a similar range
in quality...more weighted towards the better end, though, what with
an editor\'s eye looking over it before press time.

The Sable Rose Affair, was published in an WD no 17.  However, I 
think it may have been reprinted in one of the best of White Dwarf
scenarios. 

It is in The Best of White Dwarf Scenarios page 34 to 38

20 years ago!??!! Bloody hell have I been at this thing that long? I think I
bought CT in the summer holidays of \'79. I do remember the scenario well. The
team was lead by Duncan Takei with Fordson Cole as 2IC. It was the first Trav
adventure I read. It was also back when WD was a good RPG mag.

For those interested, Andy Slack has a great web site with a lot of his old
WD articles and some good 2300 stuff.

The SDG-313F series transponders became mandatory equipment on all spacecraft
operating in Imperial boundaries in 1088.  The Discovery of Cymbeline\'s chips
in 1067.  The SDG-313F completed final testing in 1086.  They were breeding
new strains of chips the whole time, till they found with the qualities they
wanted (reliable mutation, infallibility, etc).  The Chief of Combined
Imperial Intelligence from 1097 to 1108 had ordered research to begin on
researching ways to use the chips to disable enemy ships, instead of needing
to destroy them.  It\'s the TL16-17 programs at Research Station Omicron in
1128 that complete the work on Virus (essentially just restoring sentience to
the chips in every little black box).  

So yeah, the research for Virus, per se didn\'t begin until the the late 1110s
(and begin in earnest under Lucan\'s Black War), but there would have been
numerous "transponder" research stations where the work could be expanded on.
The order to produce the means on further chip research sigence hould still
have been issued (though maybe by 1120, a new Chief of Combined Intelligence
could well countermand or divert funding to other areas.

	Yeap, definitely quite a few (on the CD there is a much more complete list,
somewhere I think. Or running around in my other email). A couple of \'zines
are also on the CD.

> Are any of these still in publication?

	Yes. Signal GK I believe still is, BITs has a newsletter and AAB is still
going as the longest running fanzine. There\'s also Meshan Saga available
electronically. And I presume Dark Star is still going whenever the author
finds the time. I think Starburst is still going, and maybe Roger Myhre\'s
fanzine (and maybe not).

>If not, what the heck\'s going on?

	I\'d say a couple of things. HIWG stopped advertising for members a few years
ago, at least in part because of the changes from MT to TNE and than to T4,
being an organization consisting of volunteers (members had real lives that do
interfere, interests change, different rules systems didn\'t help, etc...), it
probably lacked the energy to regroup itself, whenever things would get
settled and HIWG might start ramping up, a new game would come out.
	The reason I mentioned HIWG (its membership) is that is provided a lot of the
fanzines that used to be out there.
	After that there was the advent of the Delphi, GEnie and the Internet and now
the web. Traveller discussions and development probably reached there heyday
on GEnie and on the early TML\'s. Right now I\'d actually say email in some
respects interferes with development, some of this can be seen in the
development of all the different mailing lists.
	The web also replaces the work done that used to be devoted to fanzines (as
somebody already mentioned), everytime I take a look through the webring this
can be seen from my viewpoint. And as much as I love at least 99% of the
websites out there, I think websites actually detract to some extent from work
on Traveller material. It is also a very chaotic environment, that is getting
more so (this can be seen by all the new rings coming out).
	All of these topics have been discussed by HIWG members. For that matter we
are now somewhat involved in a similar discussion to see what we can do to
improve the situation and better support Traveller.
	Also, websites don\'t have lasting effect that fanzines have (they can come
and go overnight and the work is lost as people lose interest, or lose
access). Which brings up the fact that there has been some initial discussions
about putting websites on the CD (I\'d be interested in more feedback on that
too).

	Yes there are. Harold Hale and John Muncy have been negotiating with Marc on
doing a magazine, unluckily talks have stalled yet again. I\'ll leave it up to
Marc to say why.
	I\'ve already had some discussion with Marc stating that I think a Traveller
magazine (paper or CD) out there in some form is highly important.
	Andy Lilly would also like the same.

> Is there anything we can do as a group to encourage them?

	I shouldn\'t say this probably, but email Marc, tell him you\'d like to see a
magazine.

> or is there some hang-up with licensing that\'s screwing everything up?

	Yes.


> Inquiring minds want to know...

	Well, the above should point out some of the problems. Now if anybody has any
definite answers I\'d really like to hear them. I have some I\'ve put on the
HIWG list, but I\'d like to hear more from others. This letter from Jim has
just made me do so sooner rather than later.

Well there are TWO missing tables from JTAS 22, Table 1 was printed in JTAS
23, read the article it discusses TWO tables, the MISSING one has all of
the good info in it like the penetration ratings and AM warheads.

But thank you for your help.

	The launch tube doesn\'t carry vehicles, it launches them. You\'re

	If this is the SSDS rolled into the abomination known as Starships,
the material factors are all already rolled into the calculations
once you pick a specific TL column to use.

	Right off the top of my head, I think the only gross difference in
the *ratings* is the armor factor--take the FF&S2 armor factor, and
multiply by 10.5/15 to get BL/BR armor factor. Most of the rest of
the differences are "invisible" (i.e. internal structure volumes are
different, power plant efficiencies, etc.).  Oh, and T4 didn\'t use
penetration.

	You\'d also have to figure a way to re-rate sensors from the
sensitivity rating to the BL/BR short range.

  What about it? IIRC, it\'s an INI-sponsored strike on a the backers
of some pirates operating from a stellar tech world, with the worlds\'
governments implicit consent. The rationale for a covert op was to
prevent an incident that would reduce Imperial popularity on that
world.

  Don\'t we wish. It\'s the other way - around $135 US. Luckily, the Imperial

x	Brawling (Fighting)	Dex, Str
	Brawling is an unstructured hand-to-hand fighting skill. It is learned by
experience (rather than taught). The individual is familiar with the processes
of conflict resolution through violence. He has an understanding his personal
abilities and limitations when interacting violently with others.
	Personal Combat. Brawling is used in the Personal Combat process. The Task
Comment will say Opposed (N) indicating how many characters may participate (N
equals the numbers of characters). The lowest result is successful, provided
that result is a success result; all other participants fail (regardless of
the quality of their results). If no one is successful, repeat the task.

	To win a brawl.
	(Str + Brawling) > Difficult (2.5D)
	Opposed (4). Resolves the brawl in one task. 
	All losers receive 2D damage. The winner is unscathed.

	A more extended resolution of a brawl determines the loser of a specific
round. The highest result (provided that result is unsuccessful) is the loser,
receives 3D in damage, and is eliminated from the brawl. If no one is
unsuccessful, repeat the task.

	To fight one round of a brawl.
	(Str + Brawling) > Difficult (2.5D)
	Opposed (4). Resolves one round of the brawl in one task.
 
	A brawl may have any reasonable of participants, generally 2 to 6.
		Substituting Melee. Melee may be substituted for Brawling in a Brawl (two or
more people and unstructured) at one level lower Melee-4 becomes Melee-3.
	Brawling is one of three members of the Fighting skill cascade (the others
are Melee and Environmental Combat). Brawling encompasses unarmed,
unstructured hand-to-hand combat. In contrast, Melee is structured hand-to-
hand combat (boxing, wrestling, martial arts). Environmental Combat involves
fighting in High G or Zero-G, or special situations (such as underwater).
	Brawling is a default skill.

x	Environment Combat (Fighting)	Dex, Int
	The individual is trained or experienced in personal combat under unusual
environmental circumstances.
		Personal Combat. Environmental Combat is used as a modifier in the personal
combat process.
	Environmental Combat is one of three members of the Fighting skill cascade
(the others are Brawling and Melee). Environmental Combat involves fighting in
High G or Zero-G, or special situations (such as underwater). In contrast,
Melee is structured hand-to-hand combat (boxing, wrestling, martial arts).
Brawling encompasses unarmed, unstructured hand-to-hand combat.
	Environmental Combat is a default skill.

x	Fighting Cascade
	The Fighting skill cascade indicates a general familiarity with personal
combat using the hands or makeshift weapons such as clubs. Within the skill
cascade, the individual is skilled in a specific type of fighting (Brawling,
Melee, or Environmental Combat) and has a somewhat lower skill in the other
areas.
	Brawling encompasses unarmed, unstructured hand-to-hand combat. Melee is
structured hand-to-hand combat (boxing, wrestling, martial arts).
Environmental Combat involves fighting in High G or Zero-G, or special
situations (such as underwater).
		Opponent Evaluation. One aspect of a skill is the ability to evaluate a
situation and its participants and their relative ability or skill level.

	To visually evaluate skill level of a potential fighter.
	(Int + Fighting) > Difficult (2.5D)
	Result is subjects Fighting skill level(s) (+D-D)

	The result of a snap evaluation (without seeing the subject in action) is the
real skill level +/- 5 (that is, the true skill level +D - D).

	To evaluate skill level of a fighting participant.
	(Int + Fighting) > Difficult (2.5D)
	Result is subjects Fighting skill level(s) (+D-S)+ (-D+S) 	S= evaluators
Fighting skill level.

	For example, Emarq Chredian (who has Brawling-4) is watching a man in a fight
but does not know the man has Brawling-6. After success in the evaluation
task, Emarq rolls 1D (=4) -4 =0 and 1D (=5) +4= +1. Emarq evaluates the man as
Brawling-7.
	Note that this process has the greatest chance of producing an accurate
reading (17%) and is the equivalent of D-D. Evaluations of less than zero are
zero.
	The game master is responsible for determining the results of evaluations in
order to conceal the true results from the players.

x	Melee (Fighting)	Str, End
	Melee is a structured hand-to-hand fighting skill. It is learned through
instruction (rather than initially by experience). The individual is familiar
with the processes of conflict resolution through violence. He has an
understanding his personal abilities and limitations when interacting
violently with others.
	Personal Combat. Melee is used in the Personal Combat process. The Task
Comment will say Opposed (N) indicating how many characters may participate (N
equals the numbers of characters). The lowest result is successful, provided
that result is a success result; all other participants fail (regardless of
the quality of their results). If no one is successful, repeat the task.

	To win a boxing match.
	(Str + Melee) > Difficult (2.5D)
	Opposed (2). Resolves the match in one task. 
	The loser receives 2D damage. The winner is unscathed.

	A more extended resolution of a melee determines the loser of a specific
round. The highest result (provided that result is unsuccessful) is the loser,
receives 3D in damage, and is eliminated from the brawl. If no one is
unsuccessful, repeat the task.

	To fight one round of a wrestling match.
	(Str + Melee) > Difficult (2.5D)
	Opposed (2). Resolves one round of the match in one task.
 
	A melee generally has two participants and is structured. Typical Melees are
a boxing match, a wrestling match, or a judo match.
	Substituting Brawling. Brawling may be substituted for Melee in a Melee type
match (two people and structured) at one level lower. Brawling-1 becomes
Brawling-0 (which actually is of no practical value, in as much as everyone
has Brawling as a default skill).
	Melee is one of three members of the Fighting skill cascade (the others are

something he noticed in the Player Manual. Basically, we\'ve been playing
the whole AT concept incorrectly. I interpreted the rules incorrectly
when I read them, and nobody\'s ever checked up on me.

I suggest that everyone read the Character Improvement rules again,
especially the first two pages.

In a nutshell, here is what we\'ve been doing wrongly:

- - you can\'t get an AT in a skill unless you already have at least a
level zero in that skill and you _successfully_ use that skill
- - you can decide, at ANY time during the game, that you\'d like to learn
a skill. You simply declare that you\'re attempting to gain the skill,
and attempt the observation task. Success means you get a level of zero
in that skill, good for one use of the skill, and means you\'re eligible
for at AT in that skill
- - the observation task requires that you watch someone else use the
skill and, if possible, try it out yourself. Simply reading manuals is
NOT sufficient.
- - there is a maximum of two ATs per year PER SKILL
- - it is not necessary to declare ATs at the beginning of the session,
except for those ATs relating to personal characteristics (Strength,
Dexterity, etc)
- - the exact AT (if any) that is handed out at the end of the session by
me will be determined by the skill each character used that played the

  If you accept the existence of the project to adapt the Cymbeline
chips for use in Imperial transponders, then that facility must have
been somewhere and likely been very secret indeed. The later weapons
research could have taken place at that same location.

  Of course, it would seem strange if such a "doomsday" system were to
be developed with Strephons knowledge, as its\' very mode of operating
might easily cripple the Imperium for decades or longer.

  FWIW, I\'m not thrilled about the "tamper-proof" transponders, and
am very interested in seeing whether/how GURPS: Trav treats it. OTOH,
I can only conclude that some very secure (i.e., as much as practical
given the 3I\'s tech and resources) transponder ship ID system would
in fact be in use for security and control purposes.

In one of the Megatraveller Journals (number 4 I believe) They told usd

the non-psis would develop some psi powers.

The book (Starships) says that one ship can fit into each hangar. This
means that hangars do not have a drawback... and that launch tubes are
useless (if I understand correctly). Or am I wrong?

But the volume of the armor does not change if you change armor material,
which means that superdense results in slower (heavier) ships than
composite laminate...

I have a house rule coming up, so that is probably not a problem
anymore...

Based strictly on the information in the T4 and Starships books, I can
see why you came to that conclusion.  That is because:

1.  The SSDS in Starships assumes that each hangar space includes a
launch port.

2.  There is no discussion in either book about launch rates for each
facility.

In FF&S v2, one can build hangars with fewer lauunch ports than their
capacity would indicate.  Similarly, FF&S v2 discusses launch rates from
different facilities (pg. 14).

Bottom line:  for SSDS ships, you may as well not add launch tubes.  You
can also do without launch tubes in FF&S ships that only carry a few
utility craft.  Ships that carry a large number of small craft (i.e.,
carriers) should use launch tubes.

The volume of the armor _does_ change, it\'s just that the Volume Factor
columns assume that you are using the armor material associated with a
given TL.  (You\'ll notice that the TL columns for Volume Factors
correspond to the TLs for Material Type.)  Your reading of the rules
implies that TL 12 Composite Laminate ("CompLam") needs less than half
the volume for the same armor value as TL 8 CompLam.  Actually, there is
no "TL 12 CompLam", as the standard material at TL 12 is superdense.

If you wish to use obsolete armor types with SSDS, you should use the
Volume Factor associated with the TL of the armor in question. 
(Presumably, the base hull can use the Volume Factor associated with the
base hull TL, if you assume that this includes global improvements in
miniaturizaton of internal components.)

1 foot = .3 meters is *exactly* the same as 10 feet = 3 meters, which
was what I intended to type.

I assume that you meant *6* feet. :-)

And 2m = 6 feet is off by 9%. 3m = 10 feet is only off by 1.6%.

BTW, IIRC the "nautical mile" is now defined in *metric*! 

For those who don\'t know such things, the nautical mile is supposed to
be roughly equal to one minute of arc on the Earth\'s surface. That\'s
about 6076 feet or 1851 meters. This is useful for navigational
purposes. 

Even more trivia. If you try that on Mars, you get roughly one km!

So I can see the Third Imperium having a "mile" as a unit that\'s tied to
planetary size! :-)

*If* the surface it strikes absorbs X-rays well, you\'ll get
vaporization and other energy transfer. The problem is that due to the
inverse square law, the nuke has to be at almost point-blank range
(less than a kilometer away) or the energy flux (joules per sq. meter)
is too low.

One of those slimy critters crawling in the garden, you know, snails

Seriously, a slug is the mass that accelerates at one foot per second
per second when one pound of force is applied to it. 

The "other" unit is the poundal. Which is the force required to
accelerate a pound *mass* by one ft/sec^2.

(and I wouldn\'t be a bit surprised if I have the above backwards).

Pennywise, pound-foolish. They really ought to break down and issue
"sports glasses" to troops. You know, the ones with the flexible frames
that kind of "wrap around" your head. The big advantages are that
first, they don\'t get in the way. Second, since they too use a strap,
they can\'t fall off. Third, they actually correct your *peripheral*
vision. And fourth, they keep crud out of your eyes, because they seal
to your face a bit like safety goggles. 

Sure, they cost more. But they are less likely to get broken or lost,
and you can always gig the soldier if they *do* get broken or lost and
he can\'t adequately justify the loss. Plus, as noted above, they make
him more effective.

I wonder what the Imperial equivalent situation is? Not correcting the
vision of soldiers with sub-standard vision?

Nope. Canadian dollars are worh *less* than US.

I\'d have to say that glasses as glasses would be rare in high tech 
society.  I\'m not sure they would even exist any more, except for 
special circumstances.  With the current tech we have, some eye problems 
can be corrected with laser surgery.  I think that would continue, 
ultimately to having eye-ball replacement (cyborg or not).

At TL 12-15, I would think that most vision impairment can be corrected, 
even blindness at the upper levels.  Glasses may be temporary 
corrections (injury, healing time, whatever), or may be enhancements: 
HUD for pers \'puter, IR, magnification, whatever....

And the women Marines called the Buddy Holly glasses "RPGs":  Rape 
Prevention Glasses.  Pissed me off that when they finally came back in 
style in the 80s that the US military finally got around to the brown 
horn-rimmed glasses that had been so in in the 70s...

It\'s a slimy critter about six inches long, coloured black or bright

Not exactly (see below), it is however expressed in metric now because it has 
become the standard system for navigation. IIRC the US is now the only nation 
which doesn\'t use the SI system.

Theres\'s no "roughly" about it. 1nm _is_ 1 arc minute of latitude (measured at 
latitude 0 IIRC).

I think that given the overall size of the Imperium, its SI units would be based 
upon some physical constant independent of any world (such as the ring/ray 
coordinate system). Maybe a fixed division of the circumferance of the galaxy? 
or the distance from Sylea to the galatic core?

    'body' => 'Let me do a worked example based solely on the rules as presented in
MegaTraveller (p 68-74).

Say we have Billy with a UWP of AAA----, hits 4/7, Brawling-2, (fist pen:1,
block:1, dam:1) who is wearing nothing (AC1).
Say we have Betty, with a UWP of 777----, hits 3/5, a Dagger-2 (pen:2,
block:1, dam:2), who is wearing a Flak Jacket (AC3).

Billy swipes at Betty. He needs to make a Routine roll (7+) to determine if
he gets a chance to attack. This is modified by his Dex (+2) and her Dex
(-1). So he will get the chance 15 times in 36.
To actually hit, he needs to make a simple roll (3+) modified by his weapon
skill (+2), Str (+2), and her block (-1). As his penetration (1) is less
than her armor (3) he only does 10% of normal damage (.1). But if he rolls
well, he does double damage for every 2^n he rolls above. So the twelve
damages he can do are:
 2 + 3 -> 5 (auto miss)
 3 + 3 -> 6  x2 damage -> .2 -> 1 (min)
 4 + 3 -> 7  x4 damage -> .4 -> 2 (min)
 5 + 3 -> 8  x4 damage -> .4 -> 2 (min)
 6 + 3 -> 9  x4 damage -> .4 -> 2 (min)
 7 + 3 -> 10 x4 damage -> .4 -> 2 (min)
 8 + 3 -> 11 x8 damage -> .8 -> 4 (min)
 9 + 3 -> 12 x8 damage -> .8 -> 4 (min)
10 + 3 -> 13 x8 damage -> .8 -> 4 (min)
11 + 3 -> 14 x8 damage -> .8 -> 4 (min)
12 + 3 -> 15 x8 damage -> .8 -> 4 (min)
So if he rolls a 4 or better he will do at least 2, knocking off most of
Betty\'s 3 hits. If he rolls a 8 or better he will do 4, knocking Betty out.

Betty swipes at Billy. she needs to make a Routine roll (7+) to determine
if he gets a chance to attack. This is modified by her Dex (+1) and his Dex
(-2). So she will get the chance 10 times in 36.
To actually hit, she needs to make a simple roll (3+) modified by her
weapon skill (+2), Str (+1), and his block (-1). As her penetration (2) is
more than twice his armor (0) she does full damage (2). And if she rolls
well, she does double damage for every 2^n he rolls above. So the twelve
damages she can do are:
 2 + 2 -> 4 (auto miss)
 3 + 2 -> 5  x2 damage -> 4
 4 + 2 -> 6  x4 damage -> 8
 5 + 2 -> 7  x4 damage -> 8
 6 + 2 -> 8  x4 damage -> 8
 7 + 2 -> 9  x4 damage -> 8
 8 + 2 -> 10 x8 damage -> 16
 9 + 2 -> 11 x8 damage -> 16
10 + 2 -> 12 x8 damage -> 16
11 + 2 -> 13 x8 damage -> 16
12 + 2 -> 14 x8 damage -> 16
So if she rolls a 3 she will do 4, rendering Billy unconscious (3 hits). If
she rolls anything higher she will do at least 8, outright killing him (3
hits to unconscious, 5 more to death).

Two questions:
1) Is all the above correct according to the rules as presented? Am I
missing something. I didn\'t think that exceptional damage applied to
hand-to-hand but I can\'t find somewhere that says it.

2) What modifications to the system have people used, specifically for hand
to hand?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Due to stellar motion, the distance from Sylea to the galactic core
changes daily by kilometers...unless "galactic core" is a fuzzy area,
in which case you\'ve got a fuzzy baseline to calculate your SI units
from. The Diameter of the galaxy is a similarly fuzzy figure, as the
galaxy doesn\'t end on a dividing line - it peters out over hundreds of
parsecs.

You need a much smaller baseline if you\'re going to generate
small SI units (Meter, Liter, Gram range equivalents) from it.
It should also be something that can be generated anywhere,
allowing people all across the Imperium to fine-tune their measuring
units when extremely high precision is needed (scientific purposes,
for example).

The current example of tieing the lenght of a meter to a certain
wavelength of light comes to mind - I\'m certain the Imperium could
come up with other easily-repeatable natural phenomena to base
volume, temperature, pressure and mass units on.

The 3i will probably base these units on whatever the Syleans were
using, or perhaps the Terrans of the 2i. It\'s also possible that, in
keeping with the 3i\'s styling as an empire of space, the Emperor
would define an Imperial system of measures based on physical
properties of things used in space travel. A wavelength of a particularly
efficient laser beam. A quantity of Iridium, or Lanthanum. The amount
of energy it takes to move a 100tn ship into Jump-1 space. 

One thing about an Imperial system of measurements - it\'s a great
political and propaganda tool. Just like an Imperial calendar - the
Imperium can demand that you use Imperial ways to measure
things, every time you measure something with an Imperial meter
you symbolically acknowledge the Imperium\'s supremacy. If your
calendar, your breakfast cereal, the speed of your communter train,
the size of your lunchtime soda pop are all measured by Imperial units,
it becomes more and more normal for you to think of the Imperium\'s
dominance as almost a physical constant - you may think of changing
your planet\'s government, but you\'d never think of trying to make the
Imperium go away.

Yeesh and you\'re one of the AUTHORS of FFS2. A slug is the little bit of metal
moving at you at high speed, silly. Either that or it\'s the slimy thing you

Notes: The "Europa Clipper" frieghters were designed by the European Space
Agency in 2020 to make the run between Earth orbit and the ESA scientific base 
studying life in Europa\'s ocean. By contrast to their American ion-drive
counterparts, they could make the trip in only 9 months. A typical mission
profile consisted of leaving Earth orbit (3.7 km/s delta-V), accelerating
to cruise speed (14 km/s delta-V, plus Earth\'s orbital velocity for an
initial cruise velocity of 44 km/s), coasting to Jupiter while being decelerated
by solar gravity (arrival velocity at Jupiter 22 km/s), followed by a close
jupiter pass with a brutal ~20-25 km/s aerobraking, a close Ganymede or
Callisto pass (~2-3 km/s), leaving the ship in an elliptical Europa transfer
orbit with 3 km/s of fuel for the final rendezvous. The return launch window
opens ~1 month after arrival at Europa and follows a similar pattern with
a slightly-less-brutal Earth aerobraking. The streamlined hull is braced to
survive 2G decelleration in this process, and the crew and passengers are
confined to the radiation shelter near the bridge during the passage through
Jupiter\'s radiation environment. Clipper crews referred to the dangerous
Jupiter pass as "Rounding Cape Horn" (the Earth pass was "Rounding Cape
Hope"); the clipper "Star of England" was lost in 2029 on its third such
pass, and two crew members on the "Star of France" recieved lethal radiation
doses in 2033 when they were required to leave the shelter to repair the
main drive. These risks were considered acceptable, as living specimens from
Europa\'s ocean could generally only be preserved for ~8-10 months on
shipboard conditions; during the fifteen year period that the Clippers operated
before the development of fusion drives, they returned over four hundred living
Europan organisms to Earth. 

Designer\'s Notes: The delta-V calculations were approximate - I don\'t have
enough time to lay out the whole Jupiter arrival scenario in detail - but there\'s
a margin in the ship\'s delta-V and aerobraking sufficient that I\'m reasonably
sure it will work. I felt that I had to invent a sufficient reason for going
to all this effort to support a Europa base - hence the assumption of life
under Europa\'s ice and the need to rapidly return living specimens for study
faster than the ion-drive ships can generally manage. (The bulk of the 
outgoing cargo to support a base should still go by ion drive, of course.) 
Aside from being efficient, the aerobraking adds a nice dramatic touch to
any operations with this ship.

The old glasses were worse than useless.. imagine having your glasses

I never got the newer style, but if I were still in I\'d probably invest in
a set of perscription goggles to wear at all times in the field.

Not to start a new Flame War or anything...

I just want to point out (and forgive me if someone already has said this
long before), that transponders aren\'t a necessity of spaceflight. As far
as I know, there aren\'t any spacecraft with transponders in them on our
planet, and if you want to go to the commercial aircraft model, yes there
are transponders, but they are far from tamper-proof. You don\'t see 747s
and space shuttles suffering for this \'vulnerability\'.

If you want to go to the seagoing vessel model (which I have come to think
is the best model for Traveller ships - IMTU) then you don\'t see ANY
transponders at all, or even much effort at tracking the vessels in their
movements (other than individual nations protecting their coastlines).
Sure it is possible to steal a ship, refit it, remove ID numbers, and use
or sell it in another part of the world with forged documentation, BUT
such an enterprise would take a LARGE amount of money, planning,
knowledge, and expertise to pull off.

Sure, a tamper proof transponder would prevent that, but does it happen
often enough for it to be worth the effort to have tamper-proof
transponders?

I can see local systems requiring transponders from regular local traffic
above a certain size, or on ships that are registered there as the \'home
port\' (especially subsidized merchants). If you visit several systems
regularly, maybe they have agreed on a standard, or maybe you have several
different transponders -- like having multiple licence plates on trucks
that move regularly between different states in the US. You can turn them
on and off at will, and each system will have their own manufacturers.

IMTU, transponders are a convenience for traffic control, and nothing
more.  I just don\'t see the critical need for Imperium-wide standard
transponders on every vessel - at least not enough to justify the expense
and difficulty in such an endeavor. Most ships will not visit more than a
handful of systems anyway, much less move to a completely different area
of the imperium.

Certainly IMTU, Imperial military ships will have standard transponders,
because it is part of their design, as will scouts, but not EVERY
starship. It just isn\'t worth it (IMHO).

Not necessarily. I could have surgery to correct my vision at current tech
levels, but I have not. Primarily because it costs money and I can\'t
afford it. I don\'t see eye surgery ever getting to the point where it is
truly "cheap", and as long as glasses are available, it will be considered
\'elective surgery\'.

Granted, some worlds will offer universal health care, and people will get
the surgery. Others will not, and some people will wear glasses.

There\'s a clear picture of a character wearing glasses in the T4 rulebook.

AHA!!!! I SEE NOW!!!!

Now I understand... thank you... I used the volume factors based on
techlevel only, and then selected hull material after that... in that
case, I do not really have to select a hull material, do I? Unless I wish
to minimize armor cost...

We have a couple of examples of Zhodani forces worrying about 
diplomatic niceties, even in the course of conflict. Being nice enough
to deliver a formal declaration of war, refraining from indiscriminate use
of psi-powers or force against an Imperial  archeological expedition
during the 5thFW (a JTAS scenario).

Since the Zho were probably fighting all the Marches wars as part of
a grand strategy of isolation and containment of the Imperium, it
makes sense for the Zho to play by rules of war intended to keep the
Impies from getting too pissed off.

btw - I can\'t find my copy of Aslan - what pre and post 5th FW relations
existed between the Hierate and the Consulate? I can\'t even recall the
Aslani stance on psionics.

Quick question... what\'s an NTR?
And was that fuel included in the ship mass? 7700 vs. ~9000 tons.
If so you\'ve got a much more complicated acceleration/deceleration formula
since 80% of your mass gets used up.

Also, how long do you accelerate before coasting?

On a different note, but still relating to the problem.  I was thinking along the lines
of this:
Break the problem down into two vectors.  You need to decelerate from 20 km/s to 14 km/s
in orbital velocity.  You also need to cover a radial distance equal to about 4.2 AU.
Your high orbital velocity from Earth will help accelerate you to Jupiter.  By
definition that orbital acceleration equals solar gravity at Earth\'s orbit.  Beyond
Earth\'s orbit, that orbital acceleration is greater than solar gravity thus helping you
to Jupiter.  Thus you want to keep this orbital velocity as long as you can because its
helping.  Working backwards, you can figure out where you need to start breaking for
Jupiter orbit.  Figure out how long it takes to decelerate from 20 km/s to 14 km/s at
whatever acceleration your ship is capable of.  Then take into account rotational
inertia and gravity to figure out what radial distance you need to break.  Then you
apply that same acceleration + rotational inertia + Gravity to figure out your rollover
point.  This makes a one way trip with two course changes.  Accelerate to maximum radial
velocity.  Rollover to decelerate to zero radial velocity.  Turn 90 degrees to
decelerate to proper orbital speed.

For the return trip, high orbital speed hinders you, so you accelerate to orbital speed
at the end and let gravity pull you in.  The return trip may involve a close pass by the
sun.

I haven\'t run these numbers yet but it feels right to me.

Just an FYI, a Bolo design for MT was included in the "lost" vehicle

Continental Defense Unit TL15

     The  CDU mounts two starship class fusion gun turrets in addition  to
a 
large  array  of smaller weapons primarily intended for defense.   With its 
thick armor and good active defense, the CDU is proof against almost
anything 
short  of  a starship meson gun battery.  Very few have ever actually been 
built, due to the difficulty of transport, and public mistrust of an
unmanned 
device so potentially destructive.

Heck, you can *buy* it for under $20US. Just saw multiple copies of

Marc,

The above definition is a concern of mine because, AFAIK, combat in
in zero-g requires different reflexes and movements than a high-g
environment. In my mind, a character performing a forward roll in 0g
will keep on rotating if he doesn\'t straighten out or interact with
another object. Performing a forward roll in, say, a 2.5g-3g environment
could result in strained muscles for someone who is non-athletic. As
another example, say a PC tries to snatch something off a surface below
him and misjudges the distance, smacking his hand on the surface. In a
0g environment, he\'ll go bouncing up, I believe, with a bruised hand.
In a high-g environment, wouldn\'t there be an increased chance of 
breaking something?

I\'ve always made Env. Combat a cascade requiring a specialization in
either Hi-G, 0G, or Underwater. Just a thought.

Or, as a possible alternate standard, using a standard frequency\'s
wavelength as the base unit.  (ISTR that there are current units of
measurement that do so....)

If one chooses the frequency wisely, one can get a useful unit of
measure (say, about 1 meter in length, which, IIRC, was the approximate
wavelength of early radars).

Sorry, I should have been more precise.  Do you have the URL from which
you downloaded the spreadsheet?  If so, can you post it (the URL, not

Wouldn\'t Underwater and 0G be very similar?  I realize they are not
identical, but since NASA puts the astronauts underwater to simulate
micro-G, IMO, they are close enough for government work.

Your points are well taken  MT has ZeroG and HiG.
However, the skill is only available in T4.1 to the agent, merchant,
army, navy, marine, and rogue careers.  Careers in which it is
somewhat likely to encounter, and train for, both environments.
I can\'t think of a situation in which a character would train in one
and not the other (unless he was stuck in one envirnoment
indefinitely).

I think your solution of a cascade skill is good.
But I think a broad Environmental Combat is fine as well. And in
the interest of keeping the skill list down, I would keep it as is.

Good, a model to work from. According to the tech notes, Marks XX, XXIII and
XXiX were all dual Hellbore main guns. Most secondaries were Laser, breech
loading morters and vertical launch missiles.

Yeah, a bolo is very good amusement.

Nuclear Thermal Rocket - a rocket that uses a fission pile to heat reaction

similar. Lousy thrust-to-weight, high fuel efficiency.

Quite true. The delta-v= Ve*ln(MF) formula which appears in the FFS2 errata
(in a slightly disguised form) takes this effect into account - it\'s 
essentially the result of doing the integral as the ships mass change.
Andrews\' spreadsheet incorporates this formula. 

The ship accelerates at about 1.8 km/s/hour, so the initial earth-escape
burn is about ten hours, and the final decelerration to match with Europa
is about an hour. (If the acceleration were any lower one would no longer
be in the "impulsive regime" and you\'d have to worry about more complex
calculations of escape velocity.) 

>Working backwards, you can figure out where you need to start breaking
>Jupiter orbit.
The ship actually uses almost no fuel to match velocity with Jupiter;
that all comes from aerobraking (a painful experience for the crew, I 
might note...) At the end of the aerobraking it\'s in an ellipitcal Jupiter
orbit that grazes Europa\'s circular orbit - the remaining fuel is use dto
match velocity with Europa.

	*Huh?*  Trust me, for the same armor VALUE, the volume does indeed
change if you change the armor material. If it doesn\'t, you\'re doing
something wrong. Trust me, I created the tables for SSDS. I also
wrote the text that wound up getting printed, actually. IG was
supposed to take my text as rough notes and clean them up, but that\'s
another story.

	Look at any of the hull tables. I\'ll use Needle configuration, on
p78. Under the column heading Volume Factor you\'ll notice four
subcolumns for different TLs. Those TLs correspond to different
materials. Notice the factors get smaller and smaller as the TLs go
up. Higher TL materials require less volume for the same armor
protection. Therefore superdense results in FASTER (lighter) ships
than composite laminate. If you get ANY other results, I can try to
explain the design sequence better.

>I have a house rule coming up, so that is probably not a problem
>anymore...

	No house rule should be needed; the rules as written handle it
already. However, like I mentioned earlier, my text was never
supposed to be published, it was only supposed to serve as a guide
for the IG person writing it. So it may not be the clearest thing in
the world, for which I most profoundly apologize. *I* knew what I was
talking about because I was familiar with FF&S1. I wouldn\'t be
surprised if some of my notes saying "<Ed: you need to discuss
such-and-so here. It\'s on pX of FF&S>" were still in there when they
printed it.

   Err ... I guess I AM wrong, then. I thought slug was defined in

	Exactly! We were trying to make it as simple as possible, by rolling
all the volume factors together. When you pick TL, you *have* chosen
a material. If you want to choose a different material, you have to
actually pick the corresponding TL.

Speaking of Excimer eye surgery:

Anyone read John Krakaur\'s _Into Thin Air_, about the nine climbers
who died on Everest in spring of \'96?

Krakaur mentions a climber who was blinded at the most dangerous
part of the high altitude ascent. The climber had undergone laser
surgery for myopia - and the weakened lenses failed under the
cold, thin-air conditions. He made it back, and his eyes eventually
got better. Lucky him - Everest kills a certain percentage of people
who venture above 20,000 feet, it had been several years since
anyone died, the statistics caught up all at once.

ObTrav: Travellers are exposed to all sorts of atmospheres, from thin
to dense to all kinds of taints. This could be a bad surprise to pull
on someone who got his nearsightedness fixed on a TL8 world just
before travelling to another planet.

Quite simple: he\'s one of those dangerously insane K\'kree you\'ve all heard

I had no real choice here: American GURPS uses Imperial units (lbs, feet,

That sounds like the Daedalus Thermonuclear Pulse Drive which I thought was TL

  The canonical 3I (and essentially all RW historical examples) has a
distinct interest in "security (and control?)" of certain assets. A
transponder-based traffic regime functions for the state in a similar
way that the pilots vacc suit works for her/him/it - it\'s a safety
device, hopefully unnecessary but very nice to have anyway.

  One difficulty with rough analogies of Traveller transportation
technologies is that starships aren\'t like trains/trucks/boats/e-mail,
etc. - what they are is FTL spacecraft of a very similar nature to the
warships of the age.

  If airliners (or tramp steamers) were occasionally used to level cities
in our world then one can assume that security measures would be upgraded
(e.g., the White House & US embassies over the last ~20 years, Mathias 
Rust, etc.,...). IIRC, El Al supposedly had quite extensive (and probably
very expensive, too) ECM/EW on its\' airliners.

  I see the issue as whether a state can or will adopt a transponder ship
ID system for security and control purposes; it seems fairly easy to do
and maintain (within the limitations of FTL message speed) given any sort
of desire to optimize security (including external) concerns.

  Apparently such a situation would have very good historical precedents
(although the 20th century is a _bad_ background from which to come for
this purpose). I was skimming the taxation related sections of a recent
book on the century of French warfare ending in 1715 (Harris?) and it
went into great detail on the extraordinary levies (cash or in kind)
imposed on both friendly* or enemy territories during wartime.

 *after a year of this they pretty much all classed as "hostile", though.

  This is pretty much expected, but what is a bit novel to those raised
on total war philosophies was the practice of extorting moneys from 
vulnerable enemy territory in exchange for not raiding them, and then
further treating this as a valid contractual relationship for the authorities
of both sides, including the post-war payment of any balances outstanding
at the cessation of hostilities.

  If one assumes (not unreasonably) that this behaviour was due in large
part to the parties unwillingness to force the devastation of some of their
own most productive (and revenue providing) population concentrations, then
this model could logically be extended to the Marches of the Frontier Wars:
the limited war aims of the major powers involved requires that certainly
no major planet(and possibly none?) suffer significant collateral damage
to civilians from the use of proscripted weapons (CBN, frac-C rocks?) or
the indiscriminate/excessive use of allowed weapons (carpet-bombing with
"allowed" tac-nukes or using meson guns to pave the planet)*.

  Presumably these interstellar rules (not to be confused with the so-
called Imperial Rules of War) also dictate that the neutralization of 
the regular military defenses requires a surrender to be made; this 
would somewhat explain the spinal PA rule.

	Would you happen to remember *which* type of surgery he had? I\'d
believe that of Laser Radial Keratotomy--the radial incisions can,
IIRC, be up to 80% of the thickness of the cornea. PRK and LASIK are
much more benign ...

	Nope. Daedalus Thermonuclear Pulse Drive is just that--Pulse. Small
pellets of dueterium (usually) are ejected behind the ship, and
zapped with a bunch of lasers or electron beams, causing a miniature
fusion explosion.

	NTR is completely unrelated--a fission reactor provides heat; the
working fluid flows over the reactor bed, is vaporized, and then
released through an otherwise normal rocket nozzle to generate
thrust. The main difference between a chemical rocket and an NTR is
how the working fluid is heated--the chemical rocket does it through
a combustion reaction between fuel and oxidizer, the NTR uses the
fission pile to heat the propellant.

	At one time there was a research program to build an NTR-propelled
cruise missile (Project Pluto, IIRC).

These are based upon a number of sources, but primarily the \'Nuclear
Weapons Frequently Asked Questions\' by Carey Sublette available at
(http://www.fas.org/nuke/hew) or as a 700k zip document.  I am not a
physicist, (I am a philospher with an an interest in hard science who did a
year of engineering many moons ago - so I probably have a lot of this ass
about):

In an atmostsphere about 35-45% of the energy of the explosion is produced
as Thermal radiation, 60-50% as blast, and 5% as radiation.

In space 95% and maybe more is expended as soft x rays, and the remainder
are approximately 1% neutron radiation and 4% Gamma radiation.  This energy
is released in about 100 nanoseconds. One kt  has an energy of 4.19x10^12
joules or 10^12 calories.  The radiation decreases according to the inverse
square law in space, and is not hindered there by atmoshere.

Suppose a 1MT device explosed 5km from a spacecrft.  The area of a sphere
at that distance is 4pi.r^2 which is 
3.14x10^8m^2  The energy expands in a sphere I think, and the energy of a
1Mt bomb is 1000x4.19x10^12 joules = 4.19x10^15 joules  The amount of
energy per square meter is thus 4.19x10^15/3.14x10^8 = 1.33x10^7j/m^2.
Only 5% is gamma rays or neutrons so this reduces the penetrating radiation
to 6.67x10^5 j/m^2.  Now I have to pluck some figures from the air.
Suppose a man is 1m^2  If he is considered in a vaccum he absorbs (suppose)
all of that 6.67x10^5 j. Since one rad is .01J/Kg, and we take a typical
man to weigh 75 Kg, he absorbs 889145.62 rads.  Rems equal the product of
rads and the RBE (radiation biological effect) which in the case of gamma
rays is \'1\' and for neutons is  between \'1\' and \'20\' ( \'1\' for immediate
effect, 4-6 for delayed catarct function, 10 for cancer effect, and 20 for
lukemia effect) We will use a value of 1.  Our victim has thus suffered
889145.62 REMs.  400-600 rems will kill you in 2-12 weeks, 600-1000 in 1 to
4 weeks, above 1000 death in hours and so on some may last up to several
days, above 5000 rems  will result in a coma within seconds to minutes. 
Our chap is obviouslt toast.  These figures are 50 time higher for a 50 MT
weapon, and at 50 km for a !Mt weapon they are 100 times less, for a 1MT
weapon at 500km they are 10 000 times less.  This approcimates to :

Range(km)   yield(Mt)   rems             rems including long term effects
of neutrons(RBE =20)
5              1         889145.62              4267899
5              50        44457281               2.13394x10^8
50             1         8891.4562              42678.99
50             50        444572.81              2.13394x10^6

500            50        4445.7281              21339.4

Okay, all this shows is that , considering only the gamma and neutron
radiation , an exposed man is toast, since the soft x rays would increas
these values by two orders of magnitude, he would be much sicker!
 Now suppose our chap is in a vac suit with an AV of 1 (FF&S1)  He is safe
from all that nasty soft x-ray stuff, but how well is he shielded from the
serious penertrating radiation?  It needs about 8.4-11 cm of steel or 28-41
cm of concrete to reduce the radiation to a tenth of what it was.  And here
again I must speculate wildly... The primary issue for radiation
penetration is the density of the material being passed through (not
hardness), with two caveats: some very dense materials are particulalry
sucespitble to radiation, they can infact icrease the yield, depleted
uranium for example; some materials attract neutrons and are use in
cladding (Boronic plastic), and control rods, Cadmium, Boron, Carbon(?).
If our suit is made of BSD, it is 1/28 of a cm thick and a density of twice
that of steel (15:8) It would reduce radiation by gamma and neutron
radiation by 1/28x2/10 or sod all.  The same goes for starship hulls.  a
ship rated to 2Gs has a minimum armour value of 20.  Many ships have an AV
of 28.  Such a vessel has an equivalent thickness in steel of 28/28x2/10 =
.2, so would not reduce the effects of radiation significntly.  For
radiation protection an enormously heavy shell is required, and or the use
of (presumably) very expensive Boronic plastics.  All these greatly add to
the cost of a starship.
It is true the serious ships with armour in the hundreds or higher will
suffer because they can expect (AV 560) 560/28x2/10 a 10,000 fold reduction
in effects.

Other considerations:
I have no idea (go materials engineers!) what the effects of the absorbtion
of the total energy across the spectrum might be on the material of the
Hull.  If ships have a black globe up the effects could be interesting
(work/time = power).  Ships with sophisticated emm suits may absorb a lot
more radiation than they would like.  The effects on sensors I have no idea.
Finally this ignores the difficulty of getting the warhead in the required
spot.  I hope to have a \'workble\' set of rules for use with BL soon, but I
have not yet finished the details.  I will post these for your comment next.

I would appreciate any input.

cheers,
	Colin

First you need to determine if either have Tactics skill (pg 66).  Then
you neeed to determine if the party acting first has surprise.

"Difficult, Leader, Recon (confrontation) (task difficulty may vary w/
terrain type)"

  The party with the largest Tactical pool (the most levels of Tactical
skill) will have the initative.

[The Players Manual does not mention this but IIRC somewhere it says
that if the Tactical Pools are the same size (IE both sides have Tactics
0 in theis brawl) that Dex may be the next determining factor, so your
notion that Billy (Dex A) is acting before Betty (Dex 7) may be correct.

The party with the initative gets to go first.  However MegaTraveller
combat uses the _interupt_ (pg 67).  Using an interrupt you can take
your action in the middle of the other players turn.

"To interrupt another units turn: Routine, Movement Speed (safe).
Referee; If this task is successful, it becomes the interrupting unit\'s
turn.  The interrupted unit\'s turn is considered spent for the combat
round.  A failed interrupt roll dosen\'t count as a spent turn.  Ignore
mishaps."

[Note that Movement Speed is not defined here. Does it means their
_current_ Movement Speed or their racial Maximum Movement Speed?  I have
always interpreted it as meaning their racial Maximum Speed.]

So if both Billy and Betty are human [Speed 2] Betty will be able to
interrupt Betty on a roll of 5+ [30 out 0f 36 or 83.33% of the time]. 
If shew successfully interrupts she gets to take her action and he has
lost his action.  If she fails her interrupt she still gets to go after
him & cannot suffer a mishap.

LESSON - _Always_ let the other party go first and then interrupt them. 
If you go first they will interrupt you (probably sucessfully) and you
will loose your action.  If you let them go first you will be able to
interrupt them (probably sucessfully) and they will then loose their
action.  You can _not_ suffer any mishaps or loose your action by trying
and failing to interrupt.

If either Betty or Billy are Vargr [Racial Speed 4] they will be able to
interrupt on a 3+ [35 out of 36 or 97.22% of the time.]

This Interrupt rule as it stands is possibily a bit broken.  I would
suggest making Interrupting Difficult, making the task no longer safe,
letting the interrupted party take their action after the interrupt, or
some combination of these. 

[Combat example snipped]

> hits). If she rolls anything higher she will do at least 8, outright 
> killing him (3 hits to unconscious, 5 more to death).

Not necessarily - see pg 75 Assessing Dammage.  After Combat you roll
1d6 for each dammage point done and assign these points (randomly) to
Strength, Dexterity, and Endurance. [If a stat has been reduced to zero
by previous wounds it cannot take further dammage so dammage should be
randomly assigned to the other (nonzero) charecteristics. However in MT,
unlike in T4, dammage points do not roll over onto other stats so if a
die of dammage takes a stat to say negative 3 those 3 points of dammage
are effectively not suffered as the stat can not be reduced below 0.] If
the wound was caused by Psionic Assault the dammage is assigned to INT,
EDU, and SOC.

"If the charecter was not dead, do not allow all three charecteristics
to go to zero.  If the charecter was not unconscious do not allow any
charecteristic to go to zero."  But the rules do not say that if the
number of dice would have killed an unimportant NPC with the same life
force that the PC has to die.

So if Betty does 8 points of dammage to Billy with her dagger but each
die rolled comes up low Billy may walk away with only flesh wounds.  For
example I once had a PC (Sir Sigrid Ottawa UPP 89B----) live through a 16
dice of dammage attack (quadruple dammage from a shotgun pellet blast)
because when those 16 dice were rolled for dammage they rolled low and
only did 27 points of dammage reducing her UPP to 030----.  This
qualified as serious wounds but with the aid of some fast drug &
regeneration therapy (the DM said that 16 dice of dammage from a shotgun
at close range, mostly to Endurance meant that she did not have a heart
left & they had to grow her a new one) she was totally healed in 2 days
(60 days subjective to her).

> Two questions:

You were missing the Interrupt, which is the key element of MT combat,
but your depiction of the combat itself seems to be correct to me.
  
> I didn\'t think that exceptional damage applied to

The rules state {MT Players pg 71] that if the task roll (including
DM\'s) exceedes the roll needed for success.  It does not say except in
hand to hand combat, therefore QED it means _all_ combat, including HTH.

You could be right. Then again, even by *my* definition, a slug is
related to the pound by gravitational accel. After all, one pound
*force* is one pound *mass* times 32.16 ft/s^2. :-)

You misunderstood my idea. I was proposing that for surface
navigational purposes a "nautical mile" equal to 1 arc minute on the
planetary equator might be used.

The circumference of the galaxy is not measurable, because, unlike a
planet, it doesn\'t have a fixed edge. The edge of the galaxy is like
the edge of the atmosphere. They both just fade out gradually. 

Likewise, determining *where* the center of the galaxy is is next to
impossible, to say nothing of measuring distances from it. 

It\'ll be even *harder* if the astronomers are right and we\'ve got a
giant black hole in the galactic core.

I\'m lucky. While my vision is really bad, the problem is mostly
astigmatism. Which means that while I\'d have to climb up the poles to

Not really. Underwater teaches you about the "no weight" bit fairly
well. What it *can\'t* teach you is the "no resistance" part.

Try to turn a screw and you turn in the opposite direction. Ok, that
sort of works in the underwater simulator. Now bump something with your
arm and it (or you) going drifting off *and keep going*. That *doesn\'t*
happen in the simulator.

No. The "pulse" drives use fusion of small pellets (or big bombs, in
the Orion) to provide a series of pushes. We can\'t build the little
ones, and aren\'t allowed to build the big ones. 

The NTR uses the LH2 as coolant in a reactor running *very* hot. So hot
that the exiting LH2 is hotter than the exhaust from the Space Shuttle
main engines. And, being all hydrogen, rather than water vapor, you get
better performance from the same mass of fuel. The higher temp gives
even more.

We built several test NTR systems in the mid 60s, but none ever flew.
The last version tested was essentially the same as what would have
flown, except for the layout. 

This sort of thing is also called NERVA, from that old program.

Better yet, they released a *special* edition of "On Basilisk Station"
that is priced at only $1.99! (Of course they did this the month
*after* I bought my copy).

Also, please don\'t say much about "Echoes of Honor" some of us can only

Six inches? You must live where they send the rejects from Oregon. I\'ve
*seen* 8+ inch banana slugs and heard reliable reports of 12 inchers.

Questions :-
1. Over tech levels 6 to 8, can we even see an incoming spacecraft if
we\'re not looking at
the exact patch of sky it jumps into (from a planetary surface, given
that there\'s an every growing list of near-Earth objects, for example) ?

2. In a more space travel oriented culture of TL 7+, nuclear thermal and
ion propulsion may even things up somewhat. Neighbouring bodies to the
mainworld probably have bases on them, and there may be space colonies
at the Lagrange points.
Could this favourably influence (to an appreciable degree) the
detection/destruction chances, given the large size of sensors < TL 10?

3. Detonation laser missiles are apparently available at TL 8. What
constitutes \'short range\' ?
(not obvious from the very broken FF&S 2 - it isn\'t 16-45m, surely!)

4. Does anyone have thoughts about Orion drives i.e. how to model them

Power Plants in Traveller
From a dugout canoe to an interstellar dreadnought, vehicles need energy
to move. Equipment needs energy to operate, be it a flint axe or
disintegrator wand.
In general terms :-

heat source -> piston or other lever system -> mechanical energy
                  -> heat exchanger -> turbine -> electrical energy

There are some notable exceptions :-
Photoelectric and thermoelectric systems convert electromagnetism
directly to electricity.
Fuel cells and batteries convert the heat energy of chemical reactions
directly to electricity.

We will concentrate on nuclear heat sources in this discussion.

Fission
The splitting of heavy atomic nuclei releases an enormous amount of
energy.
1.23 grams of uranium 235 releases one megawatt-day of energy (8.64 X
10^10 joules).
This is equivalent to 2880 kg of coal or 2000 kg of crude oil.

Radioactivity is described at tech level 4.

By tech level 5, the energy content of the nucleus is evident to
physicists.
Fission bombs are possible by the end of this period.

Tech Level 6 is defined in one aspect by the ability to build fission
reactors. Most of the
possible variations in plant design are described in this period.
Light water and heavy water (D2O) cooled reactors are widely used.
Liquid metal (sodium cooled) breeder reactors are constructed. These
enable the production of radionuclides that can be used again as fuel.

Tech Level 7 sees the advent of high-temperature gas cooled (CO2 or
helium) reactors.
Solid core nuclear thermal rockets become practicable (eg. ROVER /
NERVA).
Thermionic power linkages are used experimentally (eg. Topaz).

At Tech Level 8, molten salt (fuel, fertile material and coolant are
mixed into a homogeneous fluid), gas cooled and light water breeders (at
prior tech levels it was thought you needed at least heavy water to
enable breeding) are developed.
Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbines offer an alternative turbine paradigm
for space power generation, as it provides a more efficient way of using
a nuclear rocket\'s reactor.

Growing concern about the long-term fuel availability and environmental
consequences of fission power leads to the development of subcritical
reactors by Tech Level 9.
Fuel such as thorium, which cannot normally go critical, is bombarded by
a proton beam and \'kick-started\'. When the proton beam is off, chain
reactions cannot continue.
Gaseous core nuclear rockets (the so-called nuclear lightbulb) become
feasible at this tech level. However, core leakage restricts their use
to space.
Improved superconductor technology increases the efficiency of
thermoelectric linkages.

Basal fuel consumption :- 200kg elemental metal per MW-year
(based on 3% w/w uranium 235 : other isotopes)
For simplicity, metallic fissile material has a density of 20kg / L.
The disadvantage with metals is thermal expansion. Salts can be used :-
eg. uranium carbide (UC) - multiply mass by 1.05
     uranium nitride (UN2) - multiply mass by 1.12
     uranium oxide  (UO2) - multiply mass by 1.13
     uranium tetrafluoride (UF4) - multiply mass by 1.3
All have a density of 10kg /L.
Other fissile elements have atomic masses of 200 or better, so the above
values are a reasonable approximation.

Direct Electric Power Generation
The fuel consumption value given above supposes a traditional heat
exchanger loop and turbine arrangement, which are almost 90% efficient
by TL 8.
Thermoelectricity\'s main advantage is that there are no moving parts.
However, it is considerably less efficient, at least at lower tech
levels.

a. Thermionics
A thermionic diode consists of a circuit in which the cathode and anode
are enclosed in a gas filled container. Photons from the fission
reactions strike the cathode and generate electricity via the
photoelectric effect.
Alkali metal vapour is the gas in the diode. Caesium appears to be one
of the better materials. It has a boiling point of 690 degrees Celsius.
Efficiency is increased with increased temperature. At 1800 degrees
Celsius, the power output is 10 watts per square cm of cathode. This
represents an overall efficiency of 20%.

b. Thermoelectricity
A potential difference can be generated at the junction of two
dissimilar metals with a change in temperature. This is the Seebeck
effect.
Example materials include lead, germanium, bismuth, tellurium and
manganese.
The maximum efficiency obtainable is 18%, with superconducting
junctions.

Almost any substance could be used. Alkali metals like sodium, potassium
and lithium have desirable heat transfer characteristics. Hydrogen and
water are other candidates.

Fusion (and see postings on Joe Heck\'s site by Duncan Law-Green and
Benjamin Lane)
Nuclear fusion is literally the stuff of stars. The energy obtainable is
comparable to fission, in that almost one-fifth of one percent of the
reacting matter is converted directly to energy. Light atoms are very
plentiful, and the waste products are potentially less hazardous.

Uncontrolled fusion reactions are possible by Tech Level 6, using
fission bombs as a trigger.

Experimentation with magnetic field and laser-inertial confinement
finally yields workable reactors by Tech Level 9, based on tokamaks and
spheromaks.
Conventional heat exchangers are used initially (gas, water, liquid
metal), MHD turbines later in the period in space-based applications.

Energy is produced by the following reactions :-
a. Deuterium-deuterium (hydrogen-2) (D-D) chain
D + D -> helium-3 + n(eutron) + 3.2MeV : mass-to energy = 0.9 X 10e(-3)
D + D -> T + p(roton) + 4MeV                : m to e = 1.1 X 10e(-3)
Both reactions are equally likely, so overall energy produced is 3.6MeV
or 0.1% mass conversion.
b. Deuterium-tritium (hydrogen-3) (D-T) chain
D + T -> helium-4 + n + 17.6MeV : m to e = 3.8 X 10e(-3)
c. Helium-3
helium-3 + D -> helium-4 + p + 18.3MeV : m to e = 3.8 X 10e(-3)

Laser confinement fusion is used in Daedalus drives, fusion rockets and
weapons.

TL 10 : Thermionic power conversion, improved plant efficiency with
gravitic technology.
The latter also permits other reactor shapes than sphere or torus.
HePlaR drive requires controlled venting of reactor fuel to seed it with
deuterium and tritium and thereby permit fusion.

TL 12 : breakthroughs in gravitics and control of nuclear forces enables
proton-proton
fusion, and the use of \'plain\' LH2 :-
p + p -> D + positron + energy
D + p -> helium-3 + energy
2 helium-3 -> beryllium-6* -> helium-4 + 2p

Fuel for TL 9 to 11 plants is deuterium (LD2 has a density of 0.14
kg/L).
Fuel for TL 12+ plants is hydrogen (LH2 has a density of 0.07 kg/L).
Fuel rate is modified by the choice of power linkage ; options as above.

TL 9 plants cost 1 MCr / m3 ; above TL 9, cost is 0.5 MCr / m3.

Antimatter
Ordinary matter is made up of negatively charged electrons orbitting
nuclei made up of positively charged protons and neutrons, which have no
charge.
The existence of \'mirror-image\' particles was postulated as early as
Tech Level 4, and confirmed by Tech Level 5.
Interaction of antimatter with matter results in annihilation : the
conversion of mass to energy, as per the Einstein equation :-

energy (joules) = mass (kg) X (speed of light)^2

Recall that 1.23g of uranium 235 fissions to yield 8.64 X 10^10 joules
(1 MW-day).
1.23g completely converted to energy yields :-

energy = (1.23 X 10^(-3)) X (3 X 10^8)^2
           = 1.107 X 10^14 joules, or 3.5 MW-years

The technology to create significant amounts of antimatter doesn\'t exist
until Tech Level 10.

TL 8 : antiproton confinement systems demonstrated.
TL 10 : increased particle accelerator efficiency enables the production
of antimatter (antihydrogen - milligrams per year), which is stored in
magnetic \'bottles\'.
Applications include imaging, radiotherapy, and rocket propulsion.
TL 17 : first antimatter power pods are developed.

Acute brain syndrome leads to unconsciousness within about ten minutes

Death occurs within the next hour or two - the blood vessels of the

Now, can we come up with the required accuracy from TL 6-8?

	Would you happen to remember *which* type of surgery he had? I\'d
believe that of Laser Radial Keratotomy--the radial incisions can,
IIRC, be up to 80% of the thickness of the cornea. PRK and LASIK are
much more benign ...

Normall, this is true. IIRC, a unit engaged in hand-to-hand combat may not

IIRC, the El Al security personnel on board carry .22 Berettas, and are
trained to get within a meter or so of the target before firing the entire
magazine into the them.  The deatails are a bit hazy, it was from an
article I read in the early eighties when we were having so much trouble
with hijacking.

Does the Imperium have a similar counterpart to the Sky Marshals or other
airline security force?  It would make sense, IMO, to have such a service
if only due to the sheer numbers of sophonts travelling the spaceways.

You\'re right but as Leonard said, the similarities stop where
resistance from the water begins and, IMO, this can be a critical
difference in combat. I run MT with modifications to the skills
list and allow background skills and no skill limitations ala T4.
PCs, IMTU, tend to have access to more skills, including 
Mountaineering, as described in "The Mountain Environment", and
Swimming and Diving from "The Underwater Environment". Both
supplements are by GameLords (aka Keith brothers) and provide
some very nice detail. Pity they\'re out of print.

I can see Navy personnel having more exposure to 0G environments
over HiG ones while Marines and Army (especially Army) exposure
being the reverse. However, this is a matter of personal taste.

Whenever I generate a PC under MT, I definitely try to get both 
skills!

Good point but, as I said, it\'s merely a matter of personal taste.
My MT skills modifications were limited to adding ones from TNE 
and T4 which promoted ease of play (ex. Perception) or helped make
a character unique (ex. Fencing and its equivalent for weaponless
combat, Unarmed Combat).

Nope. Underwater you have the friction of the water, which significantly
affects how you move. (At least, it significantly affected me every time I

But it *doesn\'t* happen often enough for the companies/governments to
start mandating that all ships use unforgable/untamperable transponder
units. My statement wasn\'t to imply that ship hijacking NEVER happens
IMTU, just that it is rare enough that the expense of Imperium-wide
transponders isn\'t worth it.

Also, like I said, I think that local systems WOULD use transponders, but
for traffic control, not anti-theft. And since most ships IMTU never visit
more than a handful of worlds (Ships have payments to keep up, and
exploring is a risky, unprofitable business most of the time), the local
alliances of private and government interests can agree on standards if
necessary.

IMTU,

Ben

This still means that interrupts have excessive power, in that it takes a
very easy roll to prevent an enemy\'s task from being completed.  I imagine
some future combats where each side, waiting for the other to make its move
so they can interrupt, stand frozen, looking into each other\'s eyes, very
dramatic, but not terribly useful.

Interrupts cannot be performed by suprised parties.

Interrupts may only be performed once per side.

Ok so the side with initiative can always (if someone has an action left)
interrupt the interrupter...but that won\'t "bring back" the action of the
originally interrupted person, right?

Example : Joe and Jane have initiative over Fred and Frieda.  Joe is trying
to put the candlestick back into the wall sconce, which would close the
secret passage, sealing off the bad guys.  Fred, seeing this, interrupts
Joe\'s action (assuming success) and tries to shoot him - Joe takes cover,
his action ruined.  Jane (Joe\'s friend) interrupts Fred\'s fire task with
one of her own.  Freida (Fred\'s Friend) can\'t interrupt (since her side
used its one interrupt this round), but she can shoot at people, but her
damage (to Jane) will occur after her fire task is complete (since Jane\'s
side has initiative).

So the enemy interrupt sucessfully stops the action, but the task they
interrupted with is then, itself interrupted; should this "reset" the
originally interrupted task (putting the candleshtick back) or is the
originally interrupted task gone forever?  I think the latter.  and can one
interrupt the act of interrupting itself?  That would translate into Jane
providing \'cover fire\' to prevent Fred from firing in the first place and
seems ok to me maybe.

Let\'s get this stuff settled people, I have a game to run!

IMTU: In My Traveller Universe.  Common way of saying that the following is
how a situation is handled in a personal game.

GDW: Game Designers\' Workshop.  Original publishers of Traveller.  Now out
of business.

CT: Classic Traveller.  The game from 1977-87, the era of the original game.

LBB: Little Black Books. Alternate to CT, or a direct reference to one of
the original three rule books.

HG: High Guard.  Book 5 of CT, had the first set of expanded ship design
rules.

MT: MegaTraveller.  The first major rules re-write.  Released in 1987,
lasted until 1993 (?).  Also known as MegaErrata.

DGP: Digest Group Productions.  Secondary publisher of MT materials,
produced some of the best materials for Traveller, including:
	WBH: World Builders Handbook
	SOM: Starship Operator\'s Manual

TNE: The New Era.  Shorthand for Traveller:The New Era.  The second major
revision of the rules.

BL/BR: Brilliant Lances/Battle Rider.  Two space combat games.

RC: Reformation Coalition.  The first major setting for TNE, a small
grouping of stars recovering from the Imperiums destruction.

T4:  Marc Miller\'s Traveller.  Third major rules rewrite.

IG: Imperium games.  Late, unlamented publisher of T4

M0: Milieu:0.  Primary setting for T4.  Set at the dawn of the Third
Imperium (year 0)

FFS2:  Fire, Fusion & Steel, version 2.  The standard for building current
Traveller starships.

QSDS: Quick Ship Design System.  Desigm system for starships.  Meant to be
a "quick and dirty" design sequence.  Found in the T4 rulebook, and on the
web.

SSDS: Standard Ship Design System.  QSDS\' big brother.  Based on FFS2, uses
modular designs for easier results than the math-intensive FFS2.

5FW: The Fifth Frontier War.  War between the Imperium and the Zhodani,
1107-1110.

    I\'ll venture that the Imperium will correct the vision of recruits who
need it when possible.
Today\'s tech allows some nearsightedness to be corrected surgically in few
hours with a recovery time of 23-48 hours.

...and even that\'s a little bit of a fuzzy statement, since all
of our non-SI units are now actually defined in terms of SI units
or fractions or multiples thereof - the "inch", for example, is
defined as being exactly 2.54 centimeters.

Dicey, at best, because the fundamental distances are (a) so vast
in comparison with the fundamental units, and (b) not likely to
be determinable exactly because of it.

IIRC, the meter and the second are currently defined in terms of
the number of wavelengths of the light emitted by an electron in
a particular transition in a particular type of atom, and the
amount of time that it takes light to travel a particular
distance.  The actual numbers in question are a little awkward,
to make them "come out right" in terms of what we had been using
(otherwise, picking "better"numbers, we would have ended up with
a shorter meter and a longer second), but they\'re still defined
in terms of reproducible measurements independent of a particular
location or frame of reference.

I actually think that there would be _two_ sets of Standard
Imperial (SI) units, one set each very close to the Vilani and
Solomani standards, but using the "rational" numbers that give
results closest to the "traditional" values - for example, the
Solomani-correspondent "Meter" would be defined as exactly
10,000,000 wavelengths of the transition photon, instead of
9,853,456.36 (or whatever it actually is, you get the idea), and
the "Second" would be the time it takes light to travel (in
vacuo) exactly 300,000,000 Meters, instead of 299,975,326.92 (or
whatever etc. etc.).

(Yes, I know, the Warrant speaks of using the Sylean Federation
Standard Measures - but maybe the Sylean Federation already did
this?)

IMTU the interrupt does not eliminate the interupted task, it increases
the difficulty of the interupted task, if the interrupt task AND the
interrupting task are successful (the interrupt roll and the shot roll).
meaning your bullet hits and messes up the aim of the interrupted
character.  I have also used +1 difficutly if interrupted and +2
difficulty if interrupted and hit.

just some thoughts to consider

OUCH! Hope your players can afford good lawyers! Because IMTU that
megacorp you just sold the technology to is gonna sell it to the Regency
Govt in a heartbeat and keep _all_ the money.

I hope, for their sakes, your players insisted that this was a
technology _licensing_ deal with stringent terms on subsidiary licensing
deals, not an outright sale of the technology...

I was under the impression from reading "Survival Margin" that the Virus
project was a wartime inovation.  Dulinor\'s people had never heard of the
research station involved, nor did it show on any of the pre-War lists.

I just found in Challenge 69 the details to this - Dulinor himself was
informed about a super-weapon of Lucan and attacted the research-station.
virus was therefore activated by accident. Dulinor payed with his life a
little later when his flagship crashed dirtside somewhere.

This is a nice background to why the end of the Rebellion was called the
"Black War" period, since there WAS carpet bombing, extensive Meson fire on
planetary surfaces, deliberate destruction of civilian life-support equipment,
and so on.  "Scorched Earth" campaigns are not a pleasant activity to pick up
pieces from (especially since the idea is that the pieces left over are very
small and few).

There\'s a word for selling the same thing twice:  fraud. 
Megacorporations tend to take vigorous action against those who defraud
them.  If you are fortunate, these actions are taken through the legal
system.  If you are less fortunate, then, for your safety, you may wish
to consider using a portion of your proceeds to hire some protective
personnel.  About two or three regiments would be a good start
(depending on the size of the megacorp, and the degree to which you
annoyed the management thereof).

Bruce Johnson pointed out some of the pitfalls to your plan.  I would
recommend a licensing agreement, stipulating that:

1.  The licensee may not sub-license the technology to any other party;

2.  The licensor retains the right to develop, make, and sell goods and
services based on the technology;

3.  The licensor must be paid a royalty on any technology derived by the
licensee from the originally licensed technology;

4.  The licensor may not enter into a licensing agreement for the
specified technology with any other private entity, for the length of
the license;

5.  Upon expiration of the licensing agreement, the original licensee
retains the right to renew the license by matching any other bid;

6.  Nothing in the licensing agreement precludes the licensor from
entering into a licensing agreement for the specified technology with
any interstellar governmental entity.

I imagine that the lawyers on this mailing list might be able to refine
these points, but you get the idea.

	Too bad you\'re not in the US, or you could point out to the Board
that its infinite wisdom overlooked a lawsuit for failure to make

	Probably not laser, then. Laser RK is almost non-existent now that
PRK and LASIK are so widely available. My surgeon told me I could go
scuba diving a month after the surgery (he didn\'t want the water in

	Correction: SSDS and QSDS were both based on FF&S *1*, which was
supposed to remain (virtually) unchanged. After later books ignored
that, we (the authors of FF&S2) were given latitude to deviate as
well.

The length of a meter has actually been changed... scientists were unable
to calculate the speed of light with more than 9 correct digits, so they
re-defined the speed of light to *exactly* 299792458 meters per second,
meaning that a meter is the distance light travels in 1/299792458 seconds.
A second in turn is defined based on some oscillation nucleus...

Just thought you\'d want to know...

Sometimes I wonder why they didn\'t redefine it as being 300000000
meters, but that would have made all their precious research trying to
determine the speed of light useless ;-)

Not quite.

IMO there are essentially four defining features to Traveller combat.

1) very long sensor ranges. 

2) laser output is limited to (TL*50) MJ. 

3) externally imposed limits on the use of nukes. 

4) range on Particle and Meson weapons being essentially a function of
their length.

If you are prepared to spend, say, fifty megacredits, then you can put
sensor range to well outside the maximum range that speed of light lag
imposes on combat. This means that combat happens by consent, or under
unusual circumstances (usually the outnumbered side being caught with empty
tanks).

Any military starships Famile Spofulam has anything to do with have thick
enough armour to shrug off laser fire, or at least cause it to do only
surface damage. Most other design bureaus follow similar rules. Surface
damage is essentially to secondary weapons (turrets), sensors and power
plant radiators, and most military ships have redundancy in these systems.

No nukes limits the effectivness of missiles to BB type weapons, or to
combustion lasers which suffer from the Laser limit above.

Rule 4 is what lets big ships kill large numbers of small ones. Imagine one
large ship with a particle weapon that penetrates the small ships out to 2
light-seconds, facing a number of small ships whose weapons only go to one
light-second. The small ships will have to spend maneuver to close 300
000km, making them more vulnerable to fire. The big ship has the option of
spending all it\'s maneuverability on dodging, or on keeping the range open.

Therefore, although it is cheap to arm ships in Traveller (perhaps MCr 2
plus a dton of space), it is not cheap to build a ship that will be
effective against combat ships.

I\'ve always taken the interrupt to simply go first - being interrupted
doesn\'t cost you the action, it just means that you will go after the
person who interrupted you.

IMTU, you do not even want to think about trying to breach 3I security... 
The 3I uses Psionics at all levels...  Telepaths to scan minds... 
Clairvoyants<sp> to watch doors...  Telekinetics<sp>..to bar doors... 
Teleporters as a ready reaction force...  Awares as shock troops...

High tech is great, but what happens when you do not use high tech, but the
power of the mind?

Zhodani Concialate<sp> scientists announced today that in responce to the
Imperial announcement of their finds, that they we wrong.  The true answer
they said is actually 2.00000000000000000001.

In a simular statement today on Regina in the Spinward Marches, a thin,
well dressed gentleman took over the local IBS station & I quote "Who the
hell cares if 1 + 1 is equal to 1.999999999564 or 2.00000000000000000001,
what does it matter, if when you round it up they both equal 2."  He later
escaped from Imperial Security forces via an unknown route.  Archduke Noris
was quoted as saying, "While I agree with the message, I do not agree with
the means that it was delivered to us.  The gentlemen who took over the
Regina IBS Station will be captured & held over for trial."

Baseball is a must.  As is Soccer.  Cricket for Vilani purebloods.
Gravball (which I imagine is some sort of basketball offshoot)
for the fast moving big-body stuff.

At the professional level, these will need to be played in gravity-controlled
environments to have an even playing field.  Some parallel for American
football and Rugby Union would be nice as well.

I suppose a dangerous sport for Vilani is eating without their shugilii.
And maybe they go in for decade-long games of three-dimensional
Go.

I worked computer support for NYSEG, a utility company in New

companies elsewhere, but I have complete confidence that my
lights will still be on come 01-JAN-00.

You see, they still have all the equipment for manually directing power
supplies. The managers in charge of the plants have been working
since the 1960\'s, even the plants NYSEG sold to other people but
still buy power from. Many of these managers still treat computers
with distrust and disrespect - if year 2000 kills these computers,
these managers will shrug, say "I told you so" and implement
long-emplaced procedures for running the grid with little or no
computer support.

Heck, most of their _linemen_ have been working since the 1960\'s,
at least the line bosses.

You might see some brown-outs and errors, but we\'ll be fine. And their
IT department is on the ball as well, due to the very draconian audit
procedures the New York state government has on them.

ObTrav: Traveller still uses SMG\'s, shotguns and swords. There are
reasons for keeping "obsolete" tech around.

Board of Education, and technically it\'s _their_ computer. 

I\'m a teacher, and "my kids" are my students. Maybe I\'m too possessive,
but I spend more time with some of them than their parents do. I\'m pulling
60-70 hour weeks, and when some smarmy bureaucrat with the IQ of a
lukewarm pile of shit creates meaningless rules and makes meaningless
changes, costing me extra hours of work and frustrating my gentle child
who has maybe two years left to live anyway, well...

Sorry for the outburst. Had to cry on someone\'s shoulder. Heartfelt thanks

In my Lunion Subsector setting, Rollerball is the sport of choice.  Based
on the short story/movie; I\'ve even started sketching out rules.  The two
most powerful leagues are on Lunion and Strouden, and every three years the
Strouden Cup series is held between all-star teams from the worlds of the
subsector.

For some reason, the thought of 0-g sports don\'t really move me that much.
Track and field, gymnastics.. the traditional sports all survive.

Well, FFS2 is just better.  Much more detail, fixed some problems that FFS1
had.  Also, I don\'t play TNE, so converting to that era isn\'t really a
question for me.  

Having said that, I\'d love to have Andy put BL/BR stats into his

I agree, most utilities won\'t have the dire troubles that are being predicted.

Likewise water. Hell, in NYC they have no choice about the water, it\'s coming
down through the aqueduct whether they like it or not! The big bronze valves
haven\'t been closed since they were opened in what, the early teens?

Saw a special about the\'new\' aqueduct being built under the city (it\'s been
being built for something like 25 years...) will actually have valves that can
close. But again, those old ones were designed to close, too...80 or 90 years ago.

Ummm...like ice? ;-p

Due to the travel times in Traveller, I don\'t think pan-Imperium
leagues are really possible, although there might be a way to have
something like an Imperium Cup. Maybe each "important" system has a
league (of whatever sport we\'re dealing with), and it sends it\'s
champion (or an all-star team) to represent the system in the
sub-sector tournament, the winner of which, then moves on to the
sector tournament, and so on up to the Imperium wide round.  

We\'d probably be talking about a once every 8 or 12 years cycle,
giving our stellar athlete a once in a career shot at going for "The
Cup."  The system might send out a team composed of mostly young
players who mature over the years long tournaments until the teams
arriving at the Imperial level are almost all older athletes at (or
past) the peak of their careers.

That strikes me as an accurate portrayal of the initial stages of real combat.
But I\'m not that experienced at it, though.

Also, an interrupt doesn\'t prevent the interrupted party from completing its
move. After the interrupt is over, the interrupted side finishes its turn. The
MT rules don\'t say this; it\'s in one of the errata. So, if I\'m interrupting you,
I have to successfully interrupt you, and whatever I\'m doing has to be
successful, or you\'ll still get to finish.

Not quite. It\'s like this: Joe tries to put the candlestick back. Fred
sucessfully interrupts and tries to shoot him. If Fred misses, or doesn\'t
disable Joe with the shot, Joe DOES put the candlestick back right after Fred
finishes shooting.

Similarly, if Jane successfully interrupts Fred, Jane must disable Fred with her

Now, *this* makes sense to me! 

If the interrupt succeeds the interrupter goes first, but unless
his action causes the interruptee to lose her turn she still gets to
complete it next.

Doesn\'t the Imperial Olympic\'s exist\'s in canon?  How regularily are they
held?

(Of course, the name could be just as accurate as the "World Series":
instead of being Imperium wide, it could only consist\'s of Core system\'s...)

Off topic: could ther be any Six Races - wide association? Some
scientific and/or trade and/or religious association of that size?

("Six Races" = Human, Droyne, Aslan, K\'kree, Hiver, Vargr.  You
could split the "Human" to Solomani, Vilani and Zhodani, but that would
mess everything up...)

Doesn\'t he have to play with his Mormon sacred undergarments on?
He probably gets engaged when hes had, or been caught, having
premarital sex which is a big no-no for the allegedly practicing Mormon.

Actually this posting of mine is in error.  An interrupt does _not_
cause the interrupted party to loose their action, they still get to
take it after the interrupt (If they are still alive...).

The line in the MT PM that says interrupted units loose their action is
a typo which is corrected in the errata (The paper errata which came in
later printings of the boxed set, I do not know where on the web it is
but I know I have seen it somewhere).

Not as far as I know.  What is your source for this?

This might be usefull for Traveller: Kurosawa Movies or Traveller:
Westerns but is fortunately not the case in general.

> Interrupts cannot be performed by suprised parties.

Logically this would be the case however the rules, as written indicate
otherwise.

They say  "The benefits of surprise: A party with surprise may freely
attack until surprise is lost.  The surprised party continues with the
action they were performing before the combat occured and cannot attack
in return.  Members of the attacking party may each make one surprise
attack.  If surprise is not lost, each party may make another surprise
attack (this continues until surprise is lost)." (pg 67 MT PM)

Now the rules say that the surprised party may not attack, they do not
however say that the surprised party may not _interrupt_.  Therefore as
written a surprised party could interrupt they just could not attack if
the interrupt were successful.  Therefore as written you could interrupt
someone who has surprised you and is about to shoot you in the back by
interrupting their action and say diving for cover. This is, shall we
say somewhat questionable on the grounds of realism.

[Unless you choose to interpret the line saying "The surprised party
continues with the action they were performing before the combat
occured" to mean that the surprised party may not do anything else. 
This would seem to be logical but is directly contradicted by the
remainder of the sentance which says " and cannot attack in return." and
does not say may not do _anything_ in return.] 

When discussing interrupts, the rules say (pg 68 MT PM) "Interrupts: A
unit from the opposing side (which has not yet taken a turn) can choose
to interrupt another unit\'s turn."

Notice that the rules _do_not_ say the unit can choose to interrupt
unless they were surprised.  Therefore, as written, surprised units
_can_ perform interrupts.  I do not think that this makes much sense but
this is what the rules, as written, say. [Although it may not be what
they _intended_ to say.]

> Interrupts may only be performed once per side.

Well actually the rules say  "Only one _active_ interrupt may be
performed per side."  Passive interrupts are not clearly defined but
IIRC multiple passive interrupt would be allowed.  For example on the
previous turn 3 player charecters could have their guns pointed down the
hall and they could all say that if any enemies came around the corner
they would interrupt the enemies movement by shooting at them.  This
would be legal, according to my understanding of the rules.

Notwithstanding the difference between active and passive interrupts the
example we were discussing was a one on one brawl  so this was
immaterial.

A Seeker is a modified Type S scout/courier, optimized for asteroid
mining.  T4 doesn\'t have a description (frankly, neither do I), but if
you replace a stateroom or two with additional cargo space, and fit the
optional weapons mount with a laser optimized for cutting asteroids into
manageable chunks, you\'ll have a pretty fair approximation.

Hope this helps....

Cricket has been doing international tours since the 1870s.

The \'classic\' English tour of Australia involved a 2 month-long boat trip,
with perhaps a side trip to South Africa or New Zealand.

I can easily see a sports league that has players on a cycle of play for a
week, do 2 jumps to the next match, play for a week etc.

Whether that is one 5 day game, or 5 individual one day games isnt
important - you still get a quite viable interstellar league.

Assuming jump-5 ships (which isnt unreasonable), a 2 month trip at 3.5
parsecs a week will take you about 30 parsecs.

More interestingly, many of the international tours in the Golden Age
(before the War) were orginised by individual rich patrons, such as the
team Lord Sheffield sent out to Australia in the 1870s.

International cricket tours were also seen as a semi-diplomatic event, a
way of keeping the Empire together (which is part of why the USA, despite
having a better than decent team up until 1920 or so, was frozen out of
international cricket).

Then you have the modern tradition of the club rugby tour - my old club
(Petersham, which is older than not merely the NFL and the NBA, but also
the oldest of the American baseball clubs) sends a team to Britain every 2
years.

Imagine your poor innocent Far Trader getting chartered by a bunch of rugby
players on tour ...

is *not* a uniformed branch of the U.S.Navy, but instead something

crime, the NCIS also does investigation into Procurment Fraud, a major
juristiction rigamore I suspect.  Typical problems involve "kick backs,
product substitution, cost mischarging, environmental crimes, and
defective pricing. "

It also has a counterdrug program.   Basically, just before a carrier group
dock\'s into a port, these agent\'s fan into a city and, with the help of
the local police, round up the drug merchant\'s and keep them in
prison till the carrier group leaves.

Question: should this be part of the MoJ brief, or should this kind
of work be part of the Imperial Navy\'s juristiction?  ( And if IN, uniformed
or non-uniformed?)

Or - as the Imperium is so big, and agent\'s so comparatively few -
should this kind of thing be left to the intitative of the law enforcement
agency at the spot?

And incidentally, who is the Royal Navy counterpart, if any?

That would be one adventure where I would want to play myself.

Why do you think I brought it up?  ;-> Not saying I\'ve got this in

Once the intrepid crew of the \'Mae Lee\' finally get their ship
working they\'ll desperately need to earn some cash and a guaranteed
charter is a good way to do it.  However, the only charter available
is a team of footballers on tour.  The team\'s manager promises a
really big bonus if the crew can keep the team\'s star player and
major head-banger, "Booger" Knurtski, out of trouble for the rest of
the tour.  Booger has other ideas...;->

Unless the contract *specifically* forbids it, I suspect that low
berthing would be _just_ the thing for "Booger" Knurtski.  After all,
lock him in "the icebox", and he emerges upon reaching the destination,
without having suffered from a lack of workouts (Free and Far Traders
being without gym facilities), well rested and ready to crack some
heads....

Just an idea...

The heroes put the troublesome "Booger" on ice, and prepare to wake
him up at journey\'s end. As they\'re warming up the icebox, a whole
bunch of indicators go bright flashing red - it seems ol\' Booger had
a bad reaction to the procedure, it\'s going to take a visit to a very
high-tech hospital to wake Mr. Booger up safely - and that high-tech
hospital is too many parsecs away to reach before the big game.

Now that the players are smacking themselves for trying to smart their
way out of putting up with Booger for a couple weeks, they have to meet
the patron\'s contact on the game planet and try to tell him why his
star player is doing a frozen steak imitation.

"Fred, this is *not* going to work."
"Relax Jonny...just wear Booger\'s helmet and jersey for a few days,
and remember to scratch yourself a lot...hush, here comes the coach!!"

Now, just for fun, have the desperate medic on the pc\'s crew have another
go at waking Booger up...and have her succeed, sort of. A very strong,
very disoriented Booger wanders out of sick bay, maybe even manages
to get as far as the sports arena in his spare jersey...so we can have
two "Boogers" wandering about.     ;)

I\'m not commenting on *any* of this, because I still *might* offer
this contract to the party and see how they handle it.  ;->

101 Religions just arrived, compliments of the USPS and Leisure Games, so
here goes:

101R follows the general format of its predecessor "Little White Books" -
digest-sized, 48 pages, clear plastic covers.  14 general types of
religions (e.g., Dualism, Crisis Monotheism, Animism, etc.) are detailed,
with, oddly enough, 101 specific examples.  Each example includes a
description, some referee notes, and one or two plot hooks.  One religion
type, "Other Beliefs and Cults", consists of a half dozen fringe religions
- - truly weird stuff!  A one-page glossary defines the various technical (?)
terms used throughout...  The  various descriptions are terse - nothing
like the Runequest Cult descriptions, for example.  Consider this to be a
collection of ideas - good ones - and you\'ll be a happy buyer.  I was
particularly taken by the Monastic Order of St. Marc - The Marcers
(pronounced Markers) are dedicated to the preservation of knowledge and
learning... in the vein of St. Leibowitz, but with a decidedly Traveller
slant.  The name rings a bell, somehow...  

I thought it well worth the price - including postage, about $8.50 (4.95
sterling plus postage) - and encourage everybody to buy a copy, thereby
assuring the retirement, in luxury, of Andy Lilly and his BITS cohorts.
It\'s certainly affordable,  and you get a bit for the money...

because of the nature of the sport. Long lead times between games means proper
medical attention can be paid to injured athletes (now there\'s a ship design
idea: Team ship - almost as many sickbay beds as passenger staterooms).

As for larger organizations, travel times do get prohibitive beyond the sector
level, and you are also likely to get regional variations - witness how many
things we call \'football\' even now.

 Being a fan of the Captain Serrano books by Elizabeth Moon, I tend toward
equestrian sports at some level as well.  Golf would also adapt well...

 As for Droyne sports (ugh, an in-pun) I will never forget the super-kinetic,
Artifact-assisted game of Aztech dodgeball (in the Southpark sense) I played
in a convention Traveller game once. Two teams limited to their halves of the
field, surrounded by walls which would bounce the heavy ball with no energy
loss, and an opposing team of specially bred Droyne "Warriors." Wheee!

Wouldn\'t a Modular cutter with a small "home base" module be a perfect
vessel for in-system miners? Just move out to the mineral findings, set up
the base, place a cover over the modular space (in order to use it as
plain cargo space), and start mining.

If you want to move to other systems, you could always rent passage for
you and your ship on a trader of some kind.

Isn\'t there an example of this in some Traveller write-up in the Web
somewhere?  There is a medical facility that blows up, and part of
it is an escape pod.  There\'s a Vargr in a cargo bay with explosive cargo,
a stressed out pilot, everything going to Vland in a Handbasket.
And a couple of paragraphs about a miner on an asteroid watching it.


And, IIRC, there is a similar situation in one of Peter Hamilton\'s books,
but I could be blurring things here.

American football?  Or Soccer?  Rugby players are more of a threat
overall
since they are as physically powerful and destructive as American
footballers,
but they don\'t need the extra-confidence and sense of security that pads

and helmets give.  Need to break through a bulkhead?  Put your
waterknife
away.  Just say "Ruck over!"

WOOHOO!  That ones mine!  I\'m not familiar with the St. Leibowitz books
except by title.  Maybe I\'ll check them out.

For (T4) character generation about these Monks, check out:

http://portcaddo.com/bloo/traveller/monks.htm

(I really need to get on the webring)

The term "Marcers" does double duty by mentioning the Saint they
follow and that they often teach the lowest tech worlds how to
make "marks", i.e, to read and write.  I also call them "Keepers
of Books" as they maintain libraries.  The largest on Ton Vorn.

IMHO, its the most playable of the careers, and particularly the
religious careers, that I\'ve made up.  I\'ve used "philosophy" as
a substitute for "religion" skill.

There\'s an interesting article on weightlessness and the human body in
September\'s Scientific American.  I\'d add "no direction down" to
Leonard\'s list, which messes up the motion sensors in your ears and
screws up your sense of orientation.

Also, I forgot to mention that it takes a lot of work to get the
astronauts in the simulator weighted to "neutral bouyancy". Any
deviation from this and you have a net drift up or down. 

And things like firing weapons, using air, or picking up/dropping items
will change your bouyancy.

Pity you aren\'t in the US. Here the ADA makes that *illegal* if it
interferes with a disabled person running the system.

Kraft *used* to sell a nice trackball that would run ok under MS or
Logitech drivers. It\'d be *especially* good for handicapped kids
because there\'s a button that you push which is wired in parallel to
the left button and *latches* (making dragging much easier). There\'s
also a connection (looks like a modular phone jack) for hooking up a
*foot switch*. 

Alas, it isn\'t made anymore (and the damned *bearings* on mine gave out).

Check out the "Accessability options" in the OS. I know Win 98 has this
somewhere under "Control Panel". They should have some useful options
in there (including using arrow keys as a mouse).

There used to be a Forum on CIS for such things. And I expect that a
web search might turn up some stuff.

Microsoft is *not* (in my experience) terribly helpful. You might try
contacting Logitech. I know that they have a trackball that\'s supposed
to be pretty good, and that Logitech drivers are included in Win98 (and
I\'d assume in NT).

More to the point, he absorbs 8893 joules per kg. That\'s enough energy
to raise the temp of an equal amount of water quite a bit. But I don\'t
have the figures handy to let me calculate exactly how much. But I
suspect that "toast" may be a *literal* descriotion.

Not really. If his suit *stops* the soft X-rays, that means that *all*
the energy of said soft X-rays will be deposited in it. Which means
he\'s a dead duck *long* before he gets a lethal dose of gamma/neutron. 

At least, that\'s what I assume having your suit vaporize explosively
would tend to do.

No, it\'s because if they had, the meter would have had to be shortened
by 692 parts per million. Making a kilometer about 69 cm smaller. And
throwing off land surveys and the like all over the world.

Well, in real life, transponders are *configurable*. The tower or Air
Traffic Control assigns you a transponder ID when you contact them upon
entering their control area. And certain IDs are set aside (777 is for
use by aircraft declaring an emergency). 

Most transponders merely "amplify" the radar return and add the
(settable) ID. I think that they may also send some info about what
kind of plane they are in, but I wouldn\'t swear to it. More advanced
transponders send altitude info (because it\'s much harder to determine
than range). And I think there are plans for ones that include even
more info.

Traveller equivalent:

Basic	Sends ??? digit ID. Last 4 digits are settable by user.
	Preceding digits identify ship "class" or tonnage (very
	roughly). 

Standard
	As Basic, but also returns r,phi & theta (r is distance from
	star, phi is angle from star-planet line, theta is angle from
	local "ecliptic")

Advanced
	As standard, but also includes ship\'s velocity vectors along
	co-ordinate axes (as determined by the Standard packet), and
	possibly ship performance related info.

The leading digits of the ID may be analogous to the "registration
numbers" on aircraft. I\'d reserve 0000 on the settable digits for ships
that have just exited jump, so as to let everybody know they aren\'t
part of the local traffic pattern yet. Once you are assigned an ID by
STC (Space Traffic Control), you use it. And "FFFF" is reserved
reserved for declaring an emergency. 

BTW, when you file your flight plan for departure, you get assigned the
ID to set. And you\'d use it until you jump, unless told to change it.

The ship\'s position info in the standard packet is to help traffic
control locate the ship and determine just *where* it is, as opposed to
merely knowing what *direction* it is in. 

The velocity vectors and performance data (max acell, available
G-hours, hull-type (non-aero, aero, streamlined)) help STC assign a
course and determine which ships are going to have to shift courses if
someone has to (if you have to get one of two ships to change courses,
you have the one with the most delta-V do it, unless it has to be done
*fast*, in which case you may go for the one with the higher accell).

The above is what transponders *need* to do. You can always add extra
stuff.

It is a modified Scout/Courier from Sup. 7 Traders and Gunboats.
Normally 40+ years old when modified therefore has high wear values.

If you don\'t have Sup. 7. then the changes should be 4 sm. staterooms
instead of 4 lg staterooms, reduced fuel capacity (Jump 1,jump drive is
still J-2), the weapon is replaced with a mining laser (short range
laser), the air raft is replaced with a pressurized airraft.

I see the point. I have now changed it to  (6) 25000  (7) 50000

OK... I will design myself a ship to fill this function. I have put an

Thing is, you *can* transport somebody interstellarly by shooting them up with 
fast drug.  It slows down their metabolism 60 to 1 and knocks them out until 
you give them the antidote.  It\'s not a controlled substance, so getting it 
shouldn\'t be a problem...

Ok, its time for a rugby career.  New skills to include:
scrumming, rucking, mauling, drinking, hidden punching, cauliflower ear,
drinking, singing, pouring beer on other people, pouring beer on self,
drinking, insulting referees, . . .

hmm, a lot of this sounds like what happens when I sit down to play traveller.

(I used to play with the rugby team over a couple of cases of beer before
we would hit the bars ;-)

I\'ve been doing some research on Fusion reactions.  There is a clean and very
efficient model that uses 3He + 3He -> H2 + He.  It\'s greater than 70% efficient in
converting to electricity with no radioactive byproducts.  The only problem is the
rarity of 3He.  The Moon has a pretty good supply, but on Earth we get it mostly from
Fission byproducts.  Estimates put the energy value of a tonne of 3He at ~3 Billion
dollars.  Now if we assume that big ball of Hydrogen and Helium we call Jupiter is a
good source of 3He then shipping  20 tonnes back to Earth would be worth 60 Billion
Dollars. If we assume 10 dollars to the credit, the shipment is worth 6000 Mcr (twice
the budget for the ship) which is a pretty good return on your investment.

The only problem is why the ships themselves don\'t use 3He fusion reactors but rather
fission plants?

I have just finished designing a TL 6 solid fuel(!) rocket with a 5 tonne
payload and including mods for atmoshere and final gravity, has well over
escape velocity, (albeit with 5 stages).  I will post the design soon.
(assuming tungsten construction and structure of 15% of the total mass of
the vehicle. It has a passive sensor for final course corrections and a
minimal capacity to change its course.  Cost is about 10 MCr + sensor and
warhead(1Mcr/Mt) cost.)   It is about twice the mass of a Saturn V...  TL 7
and above are much easier (using data from the trav archive)
We can get there.

Can we get close enough?  If yes then, VERY roughly Against a target that
was NOT micro-evading I reckon that you would get close enough to kill it
easily; within about 1D10km, (on a success) If it is micro-evading, in TNE
it would be a difficult to formidable task to get within 1D10 times 100 km,
an outstanding success would get with 1D10km.  Asset would be RCV
operations or the appropriate ship,s weapons cascade.  I am still working
on the deatil.  The missile may explode well before it gets there!
(especially if it were LF, and a mishap while filling...and a small mistake
in the launch trajectory... etc.)  Perhaps using some of the MT rules from
hard times might be appropriate.  

Can we get a big enough payload?
From the nuclear weapons FAQ (cited in the preliminary post):

\'Table 4.5.3-1. Yield-to-Weight Ratios of Current US Weapons
Weapon  YTW Ratio Yield(Kt)/Weight(kg) In Service Date
Mk-53      2.25        9000/4000         1962
W-88       1.5          475/330
W-80       1.31         170/130
B-83       1.10        1200/1090

W-76       0.61         100/165
The much earlier W-47 warhead seems to have achieved ratios of 2.2-2.7 
Kt/kg.\'
No problem with a 9-10 MT yield for this payload. ( and it is only TL 6)

This constitutes only 5% of the total radiation of the bomb (see original
post).  If the remaider is absorbed as well then things will get hot a lot
further out. Note that the pulse is generated supposedly within 100 nano
seconds so this will make the effect worse.  
Two other considerations:
Use of neutron weapons with (perhaps) 5 times the the neutron yield of a
conventional bomb
Consider that neutrons apparently penetrate much further than Gamma rays.

One last thing: since lasers without gravitic focussing are MANY orders of
magnitude more expensive, and a C-paw (all you can get at TL 8) with SR1
(actually 2000km) and BL stats of 1-39, 2-19 etc. cost around 1600 MCr.  
Mind you the reliability of this PDM system will be low, and the contol and
launch facilities will also add to the cost. ( and you would have to dot
several bases around the world because of flight path and size and ...
As a side note I think that payloads of 50+ MT are achievable, but 3 5-10MT
weapons from the same missile will cover space more efficiently.

The CT boxed set "BeltStrike" (GDW\'s canon material for asteroid
mining and "Belter" character generation) shows the Mustering
tables for Belters as follows:

   Cash         Benefits
1   --          Low Passage
2   --          +1 Intelligence
3  1000         Weapon

5  100 000      Travellers\'
6  100 000      Seeker
7  100 000       --

Just thought I\'d submit the above for comparison. The Cash
side reflects the "all or nothing" aspect of most Belters\'
careers.

Both of your points above make sense, _if_ the market for the ore is
in-system.  If, however, the best place for one to sell the fruits of
one\'s labor is in another system, then a jump-capable ship is needed. 
Independent asteroid miners are likely to be uncomfortable letting
somebody else handle the transport (and therefore the sale) of their
ore, so the small-craft-and-free-trader concept would work best for
corporate mining operations.

Besides, having a small craft ties a PC down to one system, unless
he/she/it either has friends with a starship that can move the craft, or
sells the thing and leaves.  Using a Seeker as a mining ship allows the
PC to travel.

What about linking the large strike to Prospecting skill? Making a roll of
7 equal to 50kCr x Prospecting will give good miners a decent strike.

Does anybody else besides me see the problems this is going to produce.  It
looks like GT is going to have two different ship design systems.  The ASDS
(American Ship Design System) based on Imperial units, and the ESDS
(European Ship Design System), only unlike all the previous designe systems
in T4 which were somewhat available to everyone, these will be only
available in their respective areas.

Fantastic!  So I can wait to re-do all my current ships until that\'s out.

I would add a note stating that the ship is most likely a modified ship
of between 20dT and 200dT.  Usually built from a scrapped hull to reduce
costs.

I rather suspect that an accommodation could be worked out for a
differently abled student.  I *know* it would be worked out in the
US, and Canada has the reputation for being more...um...advanced in
these areas than the US.  Surly, if Rob can find a good solution and
present it as assistance to the differently abled he would be able
to get the administration to go along.

When I created the Miner career, I assumed that the miner worked for a
corporation of some kind. Therefore, this all-or-nothing approach does not
apply. If you wanted to use the career for independent miners, you would
have to change the benefit tables to something similiar to the one from
BeltStrike.

I seem to have missed a lot of really good material by beginning to play
Traveller so late... When will the GDW CD-ROM be available?

Steve, that\'s very unfair, and if you don\'t think so then you don\'t
really understand American/Canadian Football...or the mentality of
its players.  

Besides how do you think american children play football when they
aren\'t in some organized league?  I grew up playing tackle football
every afternoon during the fall in neighborhood pick up gammes.  We
always played "shirts vs skins", sans helmet, pads, cup, mouth guard
or shoes...just a pair of shorts and a tshirt (except in really cold
weather when we wore shoes and all wore shirts)...man a hard-soled
shoe to the head *really* does hurt!  ;-> I was too little and slow
to make my High School team, though I tried, and that was the first
time I ever got any equipment.  I remember Terry and I convinced a
big, dumb lineman to put his thigh pads on backwards (the points
were supposed to go on the *outside* of the leg not the inside where
they could be driven up into...ouch) the first day of practice.  The
coach made him drop his pants and change \'em on the field...after he
recovered from the first good hit...made Terry and me run extra
laps after practice, but it was worth it. ;->

However, you\'re right that ruggers have a justifiable reputation as
hard-hitting, hard-drinking, hard-playing wildmen, and that\'s what I
was going for.

Eris,

    ps.  Soccer fans sound good too. I\'ll have to think about it.

Partially true.  There are up to four "modes" on a standard transponder (1,
2, 3/A, 4) plus Mode "C" (the altimeter readout), only two of which are
configurable (Mode 1 and Mode 3/A).  That is, configurable by the crew -
Mode 2 can be set by opening the box and fiddling with the insides; Mode 4
takes classified code gear to change. 

Mode 3/A codes are called "discrete" if they are assigned to your aircraft
specifically.  Standard "non-discrete" codes include:

"7700" - general Mayday, as Mr. Erikson mentioned (this can also be set
automatically by a large switch, without having to search through codes)
 
"7600" - voice communications failure

"7500" - hijacking (this is \'discreet\', if \'non-discrete\')

"1200" - aircraft following visual flight rules

Mode 1 functions like Mode 3/A, but there aren\'t as many codes and its use
is basically obsolete.

Mode 4 is the classified military IFF code, which changes at least every 24
hours.

Mode 2 is usually set to give the aircraft type - and it\'s possible this
*won\'t* be turned off by military aircraft in a combat situation, to cut
down on fratricide.

This, by the way, is part of what went wrong when the USS Vincennes shot
down a civilian airliner leaving Iran.  Even though the Airbus was on a
commercial flightplan in a published corridor, its (theoretically
non-configurable) Mode 2 squawk read "I am a Mig fighter", not "I am a
civilian airliner".

In a world of digital communications, I would imagine even more data might
be standard, hardwired as ROM:  name, registry number,
homeworld-of-registry, tonnage, two-letter type classification.  The idea
would be to include information that doesn\'t change frequently or without
Imperial permission.  You wouldn\'t include the Captain\'s name, current
weapons configuration, or last planetfall, for example.

This depends on some fairly sophisticated astronomical instrumentation -
you have to not only identify the main world, but also accurately predict
its orbital plane from what may be a very short sample.  I don\'t imagine
the average freighter paying for this - rather, she expects the port to
provide it to her (if the tech level permits).  Distance from the planet
(or STC), however, could be obtained from a standardized time-hack in the
query signal.

This might be easier to obtain from range-rate analysis of the query signal
than the astronomical data above.  STC should get some of this from
range-rate and doppler analysis of the response.

Current transponders are 3-bit (octal - hence all the 7\'s); I can see going
to 4-bit (hexadecimal) in the not-to-distant future (65,536 vs. 4,096
separate codes), so I agree with this.  In addition, since "FFFF" is a
standard representation for "-1" in computer-ese, I hereby suggest "4-F" or
"squawking minus-one" as slang for declaring an emergency (or
characterizing a situation as out of control - equivalent to SNAFU or FUBAR).

Distance (from time-lag) plus direction gives location.

Performance data is also the sort of information that typically gets filed
in a flight plan, because it depends on the ship\'s intentions and route fo
flight.

"Surly" is a good way of putting it. We\'re talking the same folks who
can\'t afford new textbooks, yet remodel headquarters to give the director
a private washroom. The same folks who buy and pay yearly licensing for
software they then refuse to install for a year, then call us "negative"
when we point out that trying to teach programming without a compiler is
not in the best interests of the students. The folks who hired a computer
consultant to fix problems, paying them an hourly rate, even when the
problems the consultant was fixing were ones the consultant caused in
their last visit. The folks who...

The word that best describes the situation is, quite frankly, a
clusterfuck. 

<RANT>
The government has changes all the rules, changed the curriculum (without
providing new materials/training), the bureaucrats are fighting to either
keep their jobs or get promoted, and the kids and teachers are caught in
the middle.  The government has spent $1.65 million in ads in the last two
weeks alone claiming they are doing great things for education - more
money than they\'ve spent on informing teachers about the new curriculum
they\'re written (which wasn\'t even run through a spell-check program!).
For a party that spouts a lot about accountability, responsibility, and
less government, they\'ve done a great job in gathering everything into the
control of the provincial ministries, where a nameless bureaucrat gets to
make decisions that affect millions without any chance of public input. 

Quite frankly, I think this is a deliberate assault on public education,
with the aim of making private schools an attractive alternative. (Right
now the public system has an equivalent-better record of student
achievement after leaving school, in spite of not being able to reject
troublemakers.) It\'s coupled with an assault on unions and local
governments, leaving effective power in the hands of unelected party
strategists working hand-in-glove with Bay Street.

Hell, if centralization worked then we\'d all be soviet citizens by now.

  It\'s simpler to fill gunnery slots with ex-Navy men and open up the
standard Travelleresque ships\' locker...

  In all seriousness, any shipping line with a responsible administration 
is going to see a lot of benefits to hiring one or two term ex-gunnery
staff, especially from the IN or sub-sector fleets. They\'re already cleared
security-wise, and they not only have good gunnery skills (w/o the line
having to pay for SOTA training) but a strong basis in shipboard life,
on-board security drills, and discipline.

Yes, but the 20,000 Cr question is, "Which version of Gurps does Canada
get, the one with the Imperial units, or Metric?"

I hope that you get the version with Metric units, because it would be
cheaper than getting it from overseas.  But, Canada is in North America,
hence the "American" tag to the edition of GURPS.

  Direct control is decentralized in the 3I, but the Navy is still the
same institution throughout and established at a moderately absurd
capability. That is, its local presence can be very heavy even if the
control (but not infrastructure base) is local.

  The "security school" handles ships\' _internal_ security - the list

  How many trawlers with deck guns would it take to threaten a modern
missile patrol boat? OC, given the 3I\'s demonstrated naval budget (even
the lower versions) then the IN simply need not take any internal force
seriously wrt fleet actions.

No, not really. GURPS players are free to use metric if they want to. Many do.
The system for designing ships in the GURPS Traveller rules is a quick and
dirty modular one based on GURPS Vehicles. GURPS Vehicles (like all the rest
of the GURPS rules) uses Imperial. People have managed to cope with it so far.
Is there a problem that I\'m not seeing here (and that seems to have escaped
the notice of every Traveller player who runs a campaign using GURPS rules)?

When I said overseas translations use metric, I did not mean to imply that we
have GT translations lined up. We do not as of now have any proposal for a GT
translation. 

I think this is a minor problem that can be solved by any number of commonly
available conversion applications.

Ships of that type are used as well for belt mining. In Supplement 4,

there\'s the purpose-built Vargr Seeker from Alien Module 3 _Vargr_,
a 200-tn unstreamlined ship with a 30tn ship\'s boat.

You find modified type-S Scouts playing the Seeker role for the same
reason you see fleets of 1970\'s Volkswagon Bugs playing taxicab
in Mexico City. Lots of \'em were built, lots of \'em are still around.

Modified type-S Seekers are rebuilds from used scout ships the IISS
has paid off. They are cheaper than new ships, and a lot less reliable.
_Citizens of the Imperium_ quotes the value of a mod-S Seeker at
about 20MCr, about the cost (new) of a Classic Traveller 40tn Pinnace.

No, I have no idea how Vargr afford a custom-built asteroid prospecting
vessel. Just another example of the engimas of alien cultures, I suppose.

The problem with Synchronized Sleeping as an event is not with the
judging, it\'s with the coaching.  Just how do you get several sleepers
to roll over in sequence?  Heck, how do you get a group of people to
fall asleep in synch, without using "performance enhancing" drugs, such
as Seconal?  (Low berths don\'t count; Low Berth Synchronized Sleeping is
no more worthy of the Olympics than Stock Car Racing is.  In both cases,
it\'s the technology that\'s the key, not the individual\'s athletic
prowess.)

The above especially makes sense if the amount of ore isn\'t a big deal.
If the Belter is a prospector, he doesn\'t want to transport enough ore

the chain reaction steel confetti was inspiring. Made me glad the

It\'s a sport, just like yacht racing. It\'s not a sport that highlights
physical prowness like most Olympic sports do, and is far too
noisy and environmentally incorrect for consideration as an Olympic
sport.

I\'m looking forward to adding orbital skydiving to MTU\'s sports list.

The "problem" for me is two fold:

Firstly: its an extra step of work I\'d much rather not have to do. Like you say its 
not difficult too simply convert the figures, but it\'s really annoying to have to do 
so. It will have the effect of making material produced for G:T "uncompatible" 
with other versions.

Secondly: it just doesn\'t "fit" with the background. Somehow the idea of rating 
the Imperium\'s latest dreadnought according to it\'s length in yards feet and 
inches and seeing its weight in tons and pounds just doesn\'t work for me.

Yes it\'s relatively easy to work around, but (juding from the opinions expressed 
here) it is a major factor in a lot of established players minds.

Maybe I am reading it wrong but under the term roll\'s section it seems
to state that there is no roll for commission, although there is for
promotion, yet there is a commissioned rank O1 under table of ranks.
Does Rank o1 follow E1 if a successful promotion roll is made?

I mistyped. There is supposed to be a commission, but no promotion.

Yeh, I have all those listed above. As to the last statement, I say why
not complain, it beats being nice all the time and boy can you make some
people mad. No I don\'t mean that.

On a side note, I have had some verbage with James Lindsay and I just
received some data on the Old Vanguard Reaches and Beyond Sectors ala JR
Keith era. Sure helps to fill in the data shortage and amazing enough,
what I dreamed up seems to fit very well and with only very minor shifts
of territory. I think it\'s going to work out very nicely.

Kerry (my daughter) is now over on the continent and will be back in
England in a couple of weeks. I\'ve had e-mail from Dom, and Andy Lilly
of the UK and have passed on Kerry\'s e-mail address and their addresses
and contact numbers. Hope this works out OK. Andy Lilly wanted to know
if Kerry was going to bring back a bunch of things for a bunch of us to
which I said I didn\'t think so. I don\'t think Kerry has or will have any
room left to carry a bunch of stuff back. If she gets me the 101 series
of books that will be great and I can feed tid-bits to you guys as you
need them. This is all a number of months or a couple of years away
though so don\'t get too excited. B^)

Talk to you soon. I was over last Saturday for a regatta, and will be
over a couple of times this week, but mostly too busy to be able to
visit.

I wouldn\'t hold my breath on the apology from the Army bit....

As long as Andy is taking pizza requests I\'d like a large vegetarian

How about a ship conversion system.  This system would take a MT or TNE
(FFS 1) ship & convert it, as closely as possible to an FFS2 ship.

I quite agree. Coming from England I grew up with having to flit between both
systems so have gotten used to lbs and kg. Pounds, shillings and pence were just
before my time and seem far too weird though :-)

More to the point, you may not *have* a crust that thin without the
sort of "large, late impact" that gave Earth the Moon. In case you
weren\'t aware, the Moon is a a bunch of crustal material from Earth
that got knocked off when something rather large sideswiped early
during the late stages of planetary formation. 

The pieces settled into an orbit and mostly conglomerated into one
body.

Actually, you are likely *not* to have the process occur at all. The
water seeping into crustal faults, especially in subduction zones, both
acts as a lubricant, and enables the rocks to melt at lower
temperatures.

Your weather *can* get more extreme. Then again, you may not have as
much weather, simply because evaporating and condensing water drives so
much of our weather patterns.

1 kilogram-degree for water is 4184 joules, so it will raise his body
temperature by 2.1 degrees, which wouldn\'t be lethal or even incapacitating if
done over a moderate period of time, but would be likely to put him in shock if
done quickly.  It also won\'t be particularly evenly distributed, it will
actually raise the temperature of the part facing the blast by quite a bit more
than that, and might not significantly increase his core body temperature
significantly; as such, the subject might not even go into shock.  This figure
is also high, a man doesn\'t have a cross-section of a square meter.

A suit sufficient to stop the soft X-rays will probably weigh 10+ kilograms,
and have a specific heat of around .2 cal/degree, which means that it will heat
up by about 80C.  Sudden thermal expansion is reasonably likely to breach the
seals on that suit, but it won\'t vaporize, you\'d probably need 20-50 times as
much energy to vaporize the suit.

With apologies, I couldn\'t tell you. All my MT manuals are in Word format, and I
incorporated the errata into them so long ago I can\'t tell you where I got each
rule change from. I _thought_ that this particular rule came from the errata,

The American edition. Not so bad for a fantasy game, when archaic units
actually _add_ to the atmosphere, but...

Loren, How about making the International edition available up here in the

What does the fusion reaction in particular have have to do with
conversion to electricity? That is, IIRC, a separate part of the
reactor. All of the designs so far use neutron absorbing materials to
generate heat, whihc is then used to generate electricity.

Do you have some references to this reaction?

I suspect GURPS Vehicles uses American, not Imperial, but I\'ll concede

Well, first off most Traveller players are probably American, so for them
metric will be the unusual option. (And last time I was in Britain it had
converted less thoroughly than Canada had.)

I don\'t want to have to convert a number every time I play, or go throught
the book pencilling in changes. 

I think part of the problem is that, having got used to metric, having
developed cubic metres of background material in metric, and having 20+
years of metric Traveller experience, I don\'t want to change. 


Mind you, I _have_ figured out _why_ this is happening. Remember the

Alas, Loren has already posted that there are no plans at 
this time for any translations of Gurps Traveller, so there 
is no version with metric.

Loren, correct me if I misread...

If the byproducts are charged particles then you could use magnetic
field techniques to directly draw off electricity. Being non-radioactive
charged particles would really help.

As long as you are limited to neutronic heating you\'re going to get much
lower efficencies.  The fusion pile is just the firebox on a
steam-electric generator. 

If I\'m not mistaken, there is a idea associated with a Dr. Post that
directly draws off electricity from some standard fusion reaction , that
has something to do with magnetic fields or potential changes or
something.  I\'m not where I can check my notes right now, so I can\'t
tell you more, but it sounds good anyway. ;->

Of course, perhaps GT is not metric because it\'s trying to be classic, and
_truly_ classic traveller uses american units (and maps vehicles in 5\' squares
- -- 500 cf is a traveller ton).  This also accounts for world size codes being
in thousands of miles....

Heh - imagine that - an American game featuring American units of
measurement. Is it just me, or might not most Americans find that that
feature just *does* work for them.... If I were playing a game that
originated and continued to be produced in a country that used metric as
its standard of measurement, then I\'d be willing to accept the fact that I,
as an American, would need to make some conversions from metric, and the
reverse is also true.

That\'s interesting, Page 68 of the MT Players Manual states;
"If this task is successful, it becomes the interrupting unit\'s turn.  The
interrupted unit\'s turn is considered spent for the combat round.  A failed
interrupt roll doesn\'t count as a spent turn.  Ignore mishaps."

So not only does an interrupt spoil someone\'s action if successful, if it
fails the person who tried to interrupt can still take some action (and
apparently a completely different action from the attempted interrupting
action).

I searched the MT errata I have dated October 1988 which, aside from
lifting the restriction on interrupting allies and a note about animals,
does not change this rule at all.  Do you have errata later or more
complete than I?  I\'d love to get my hands on it.

If this rule is contradicted, it takes away the power interrupts have to
spoil tasks which I object to.  Even if there is no errata, I will probably
play it the way Erwin describes.

Actually, the idea the Imperium uses kilogram, metric tons, meters,
centimeters, etc. is also a stretch.  (One would expect Vilani
units to be most prevalent).  To me, it a case of roleplaying.
We don\'t really try to speak Galanglic at sessions and we don\'t
really try and use Vilani "cubits" to measure.

Another possibility would be to produce an addendum or appendix that would give the formulas and equipment stats in SI terms (this is less good than my other suggestion IMO).

Speading tends to occur under oceans because spreading zones
are low spots and water tends to collect there, not because you
need water to open up a rift zone.

There is a theory that you need water to keep plates from locking
up (primarily at subduction zones) but I think its just a theory.

You get a somewhat greater temperature variation.

GURPS Traveller mentions that Longbow(*) was shutdown. I don\'t recall what

Here on earth you can find a rift above sea level (somewhere in Erythrea
or Ethiopia I believe), where two plates are drifting away from each
other (the African and tha Asian plates IIRC).

It looks like a kind of lunar landscape with some fumes and, from place
to place, you can see some reddish heated rock (but no lava), nothing
very impressive, compared to an active volcano (even a small one)

Huge dust storms clouding the surface from the sun and lowering ground
temperature
I\'ve always pictured dry worlds to be continually "wiped" by huge dust
storms lasting several days and coming back regularly (at least if they
have an atmosphere thick enough to carry dust or sand - at least thin
atm don\'t you think ?)

I didn\'t have any problem.  The only unit that matters in combat
is the yard and you convert that by saying 1 yd = 1 meter.  Space
combat is always in "hexes".  You don\'t add up encumbrance very
often and just use 2 Lbs = 1 Kg.

 Yes it\'s relatively easy to work around, but (juding from the opinions
expressed 
 here) it is a major factor in a lot of established players minds.

I\'d change it if I could, but it is not a matter I have a lot of influence
over.

I think so.  It is one of the better IG publications.

  Creating Institutes with a UID (universal institute descriptor),
   New Powers (only a few), New Rules (few), World Psioniphobia and

I think the Psionic Institute creation material is most useful for any

must.

They wouldn\'t really work anyway.  The data would be unverfiable
because it is quite possible that the ship (and its transponder)
arrive before any message containing info you could check it
against.

I think that systems like Regina would probably give traffic control
priority to ships with some sort of transponder (which makes it
easy to tack location and velocity).

Well, water ice is one of the few ices on which it is *possible* to
skate. That\'s because water reaches maximum density *before* it
freezes. And expands when it does freeze. That means that the pressure
on the "blades" of the skates, causes the ice under them to *melt*,
thus lubricating things.

But mainly for portability of documents. It would be, most probably, a
beltpack with the main memory storage unit, a CPU and a PAN (Personal
Area Network) interface. The PAN would get rid of all those pesky
cables (it\'s a setup that uses the natural electrical field of the
human body to transmit data). 

>You may have "glasses" with virtual display capability built into

Probably something like a device that projects the image onto your
retina, for operations on text and such. Also, an eyeball-tracking
device could be used to provide a very big field of view, by checking
where are you looking at and scrolling the virtual display. 

>and you may have a watch as a simple i/o device (a few buttons, maybe
> a microphone, a simple display, and an IR link). 

I doubt that. For low TL devices, you\'d probably want to use a
chording keyboard (a device that is held in one hand and allows for
pretty fast typing) and a set of subvocal laryngophones on your neck,
connected to the CPU through the PAN interface. The IR laser link for
longer distance communication than the PDA field allows for
(practically touch-only) would be probably incorporated in either
glasses (look at the receiver), belt pack or both. You could also have
two very small microphones in your ears, using the PAN to communicate
with CPU, that would provide you with sound in addition to vision. 

For a high TL input device, an armband incorporating electrodes would
check the neural activity in hand, and would provide a \'virtual
chording keyboard\', without a keyboard. You wouldn\'t have to budge a
finger, as matter of fact, since the armband would detect the \'will\'
to move the finger a bit before it moves. (electrode setups like that
are being done already, AFAIK, but they\'re a bit unwieldy). 

Using two hands, or, even better, two arms, an a set of macro-commands
attached to specific movements and combinations would allow you to
reach very high typing speeds. 

Also, your belt-pack would probably incorporate a cellular phone with
a built in modem, for electronic mail and news. It doesn\'t have to be
very fast...

With the virtual retina projected display, you don\'t need the PDA
sized display. OTOH, a CCD camera that would recognize drawings,
handwriting, could scan pictures from walls or pages etc. would sure
be nice. ;) 

And a PDA sized display could have a laser- or something else-based
projector that would allow for projecting images on walls or screens,
for presentations and things like that. 

>And a "workstation" would be a keyboard, larger display, better

Workstation would be a holographic display, a very fast link to the
network and a PAN link in your chair. ;)

Well, you don\'t need the holographic display. OTOH, PAN sensors could
be built in in your house\'s floor, chairs and beds. Along with a
projector that would work as an on-ceiling screen. Just lie down on
your bed, power the projector up and voila - Quake XII on a biiig
screen ;>>. 

<snip the rest of the stuff I agree with> 

Oh, and one more thing. PAN link can also easily link your wearable
computer with the processor built in your smart weapon. So, for
example, only people with Team 17 identyfing codes in their PAN field
can fire the Team guns. 

As a matter of fact, PAN field can also link you with your battle
dress. ;>>

It doesn\'t take *that* sophisticated of equipment to determine this
(see below).  And frankly, the ship *has* to have that much equipment
or they can\'t navigate upon jumping into a system that *doesn\'t* have
STC, or when trying to navigate between "lesser" worlds in a system.

In short, the info is supplied by a link to the nav computer. And that
sort of info *is* something that the ship *must* have. 

Consider what happens in case of a radio failure or a misjump. They
*have* to be able to determine the ship\'s position in the system *on
their own*.

But it helps to have crosschecks. Among other things, it lets both the
ship and STC know that *something* is wrong if the location the ship is
giving doesn\'t match where STC thinks it is.

And if they *do* more or less agree, combining the info at least
*halves* the uncertainty in position.

Sure, but in Traveller, incoming traffic doesn\'t *have* a flight plan
on file. The "jump flash" when exiting jump is the first indication
that STC has that a new ship has arrived. And they don\'t know anything
about the ship that their radar/lidar can\'t tell them until the ship
tells them.

The equipment for determining position and vector info isn\'t *that*
advanced.

When you exit jump, you look for the brightest light source in the
vicinity. That should be the local star. :-)

A quick spectral check will tell you if it\'s the right star. And if it
isn\'t, the computer can quickly find what star the spectrum matches.
Stellar spectra can be determined *far* beyond the greatest possible
misjump, so you *will* have the star in the library. 

Determining the direction and distance of the local star is *easy*. A
simple angular diameter measurement will give you range. And direction
is kinda obvious. 

Determining the plane of the ecliptic is a bit harder. You can get a
rough idea simply by checking for doppler shifts at the edge of the
star. The poles have none, the equator has the most. If you are way
above or below the ecliptic, this will be a problem. 

Next, you\'d be scanning for standard nav beacons. If you find such
signals, a couple of them will suffice to locate you in the system
(when used along with the known direction & distance of the star).

And most likely, what you\'d pick up first would be the mainworld comm
traffic. 

Once you\'ve got the beacons/mainworld located, you can easily figure
the vectors by measuring doppler shifts. 

If the system is lowtech, then you\'ll have to waste some time spotting
some planets on your own. At least if it\'s an explored system you\'ll
know where to look for the planets (more or less). 

Though, come to think of it, a few star sights will determine your
orientation to more than enough accuracy. The computer would spit out a
list of what the brightest stars visible from the system you are in
are, and then you just spot them, and that gives you your *galactic*
co-ordinates, which are easily (for a computer) transformed into system
co-ordinates.

All of this is doable with little more than a "small" (less than 50 cm)
telescope, and some radio and radar gear you\'d need anyway. The sensors
attached to the scope are cheap. Ditto for the pointing gear. But
they\'d be *priceless* if you misjump, or if you have to navigate on
your own for some other reason.

Try Norse Stickball. It\'s "sport" invented by folks in the SCA. The
"rules" amount to:

Whoever has the ball tries for a goal. 
Everybody else tries to stop him.
Body parts must be returned to the owner.

Folks have been known to play in full armor. :-)

	But who says it has the be PRESSURE causing the surface to melt, and
hence lubricate things? I recollect Haldeman, in "The Forever War,"
talking about power armor troops learning to walk on a surface of
frozen hydrogen--the minute heat leakage from the soles of their
boots melts and forms a near-frictionless layer. Soldiers who fail to
learn how to "skate" quickly fall. Those who fall on their backs die,
as the high-temp heat exchanger located there flash-vaporizes a
significant chunk of hydrogen with explosive effects ...

	Now THERE\'S a weird, dangerous substance on which to play hockey!

Overall, I share your sentiment, but standard MS drivers run 
my touchpads just fine and quite often other input devices as 
well. Won\'t give you any \'extra\' features the device specific 
driver does, but it will go from point a to point b and click and 
right click, etc. 

Heck, on my Cirque touchpad it even recognizes the upper 
right corner as the right click area. Good thing, too, because 
the Cirque drivers are incompatible with IRQ 12 (or is it 13, 
can\'t remember) and with logitech drivers. Guess what IRQ 
Win95 put my input device on? (and 3 others at work) and 
what driver it \'plug & plays\' my mouse as? Logitech, of course. 
No input device. Sigh. Delete everything and install the 
standard MS driver and it worked. Go figure.

(For my money, don\'t buy the Cirque toucpads. Get one of the 
others, they are cheaper and don\'t seem to have the conflicts.)

I don\'t have my books with me today so I can\'t give a worked example, but
most large blades have a better penetration and damage dice than your
average snub pistol. Also since you are making a Simple roll to hit (3+)
rather than Routine (7+) which most ranged fire works out at it is much,
much easier to roll 4 or 8 higher than needed getting the lovely 4x or 8x
damage.
A bunch of marines boarding with battle axes rather than ACRs might make a
lot more sense. Aside from non-game issues like being easier to wield an
axe in close quarters (I have experience in this) than a rifle (although I
don\'t have experience in this) those axes have amazing penetration and
damage ratings!
Does anyone remember the old signature illustration in White Dwarf? That of
a pale, short humanoid? Continuing the cross between SF and fantasy it was
drawn as an obvious fantasy dwarf but it had a rifle. Instead of a bayonet
it had a slip-on axe blade. I always thought that was cool. (Or is that an

I agree wholeheartedly. There\'s a mass of information about Mertactor.
There\'s propably a lot more buried in the game, but... <sigh>.

Unfortunately the information isn\'t quite compatible with other sources.
And I\'m also a bit dissapointed that the author dicided to use the Ancients
to explain the physical stats (size 2, atmosphere 6). Apparently the whole
planet is an Ancient artifact. IMO the Ancients are getting seriously over-
worked.

Anyway, that got me thinking about similar planets. With the standard
world generation system 1 planet in 12 has a size 2 and of those planets 2
in 36 have standard atmospheres and 1 in 36 has standard, tainted atmosphere.
So 1 planet in 144 is similar. That\'s 2-3 per sector; too many for all of
them to be Ancient artifacts. Mertactor is supposed to have a gravity of 0.82
due to a very high density (3.28 Earth normal). Is a relatively high gravity
the only possible explanation for a standard atmosphere? I seem to remember
that the reason why Earth\'s atmosphere is the way it is is that the moon has
skimmed off a lot of it. Could you have small moonless worlds with fairly
dense atmospheres? How about size 1 worlds? (Size 1 planets with standard
atmospheres are rarer, but there are still about 50 of them in Charted space).

Ah... piracy in lower-tech, backwater systems has always been technically
possible (If there are no system defenses, the pirate can just wait for an
incoming ship and run it down when it arrives with empty tanks). The problem
with lower-tech, backwater systems is that they have fewer and smaller
merchant visits, making it difficult for a pirate to recoup any money
spent on acquiring and maintaining a ship capable of running down and
outfighting a fleeing free trader. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Which keeps pirates rare. Go to rich hunting grounds, have an
encounter with a couple SDB\'s. Go to safe hunting grounds, starve.
The expense of running a starship in Traveller makes being a pirate
even harder to do. A couple of things that help:

A> Used, mutinied, and stolen ships - especially ships that, for
whatever reason, can\'t be sold on the open market. When the expense
of acquiring the ship is greatly reduced or eliminated, the only income
you need is for salaries, repairs, maintenance and life support.

B> Bypassed Mains. There are many mains in Imperial space that
once saw all the traffic. With the introduction of better jump drives,
a lot of traffic started bypassing the more marginal worlds along these
mains - instead of every ship stopping by, at least to fuel up, now only
tramp freighters and local business show up. You have low-traffic
backwaters within a jump of more powerful and richer worlds.
The most famous pirate havens of the 18th century were in waters
patrolled by the British navy, the most powerful navy in the world at the
time. The 3i is practically omnipotent, but cannot know everything or
be everywhere.

C> Some leeway on life support and maintenace rules. I allow people 
IMTU to perform annual maintenance "in the field", at the cost of
more time, more risk and more wear on their starships - things an
honest merchant wouldn\'t want. Some life support costs can be
reduced by stealing lif support materials from ships, bases and
stockpiles. If the conditions on board the pirate ship are rough
enough, stolen supplies may be enough to eliminate the life
support expense all together - but the pirates are living under
conditions only desperate men would endure, and no honest
merchant could get away with.

IMTU, pirates that aren\'t actually pro starmercs are usually
mutineers or escaped criminals with death sentences already
on their heads. They use beat-up ships that are cold and dark
holes to live in, and they usually have the scars and missing bits
one would expect from their dangerous lifestyle and poor access
to quality medical care. Many are from minor human or alien races
that lack opportunities in the Vilani/Solomani dominated 3i, leading
to pirate crews being a mixed and angry lot. 

Why do they put up with it? Different reasons for each pirate. Some
have nowhere else to go. Some would do anything to get into space.
Some just like the looks on people\'s faces when you toss them out
the airlock without a vac suit on...

Vargr Corsairs have the right idea for proper pirating, by the way.
Find an area of many squabbling interstellar states, hire out as
a starmerc until you have the money and resources to hit the local
governments up for protection money. Take ships from people who
won\'t pay up, take ships from people who try to attack those you\'re
getting protection money from. Eventually you\'ll be the law, and the
de-facto government of the space between the worlds in your
territory - then you become the government of the worlds in your
territory. Pirate Captain to Emperor - charisma in spades!!!  <G>

Massive techtonic & volcanic activity would outgass a lot of atmosphere, too,
for a few million years.

Sounds almost like another SCA favorite of mine,
Dragonball!

Its done just like Norse Stickball, but the \'ball\' is actualy a plush
dragon toy.  The body parts are connected through velcro.  the object is
to get the poor defenceless dragon to your goal in one peice, with points

Which brings up some possible elaborations of the Computer skill in Traveller.  With so many worlds, and the significant time lag in the 3I from end-to-end, it is very reasonable to think that there may be different computer OSs, or at least different versions of a main OS that is used Imperium-wide.  It seems more likely to me that there would be different OSs available however.  On this line, perhaps a Computer skill of 1 would include the assumption of familiarity with one computer OS, and that additional levels of skill could be cascaded into additional levels in the OS already known, or additional OSs.
For example, a Computer-1 skill level could represent ordinary user level knowlege, and simple programming (10 print "hi", 20 goto 10).
Computer-2 could represent the "power user" level knowlege, and a bit more programming knowlege ("...so I\'ll just delete the superuser account, and then the system is completely secure!  Now how do I change this setting?  Oops...)
Computer-2 could represent a professional level of knowlege, allowing one to be officially hired to do computer work.  This would include enough knowlege to become professionally certified in a particular OS (not necessarily being certified, just knowing enough to do so with a few days of cramming).

It\'s not an SI unit of volume, but neither is the liter; technically, the
SI derived unit of volume is the cubic meter.  The metric tonne (1000 kg)
isn\'t SI either, but both are units outside the SI that are accepted for
use with SI units.

The liter was originally the volume of a kilogram of "pure water"; this 
is about a cubic decimeter.  The Traveller displacement ton is supposed
to be the volume of a metric ton of liquid hydrogen, at least since late
editions of the Little Black Books (early versions were less than clear
on this).  The displacement ton may not be SI, but it\'s metric-derived
at least.

The liter wasn\'t originally *exactly* a cubic decimeter; it was out by
a couple dozen ppm.  Therefore, it lost out to the cubic meter as the
derived unit of volume, and was redefined to be exactly a cubic decimeter
in the early 60s.  For that reason, liters aren\'t supposed to be used in
high accuracy measurements.  A metric ton of LHyd isn\'t exactly 14 cubic
meters in volume either, for that matter.

Does GURPS Traveller have the displacement ton?  Are the ships suddenly
ten percent smaller since they\'re using US short tons of LHyd instead of
the metric ton?  Is *this* why Dulinor\'s gig blew up?  Inquiring minds
want to know!  :)

  -- Steve Bonneville

PS  One "metric LHyd displacement ton" of 14 cubic meters comes to nearly
    3700 US liquid gallons.  One "US LHyd displacement ton" of 2000 pounds 
    works out to 12.7 cubic meters, or 3355 US liquid gallons.  But then
    again, I suppose that for Traveller we should be using the "Imperial"
    system of measurements.  :)

Venus is a "really low hydrosphere world" - i.e. Hydro 0. The Magellan
radar mapping orbiter discovered that the entire surface of Venus was
formed at roughly the same time, about 500 million years ago. This is
*very* weird. One theory claims that Venus has a thicker crust than the
Earth, so heat gets trapped inside rather than being released through
outgassing and volcanism. The heat builds up and builds up, slowly melting
the crust from below, until the *entire surface of the planet* cracks apart
into a vast sea of magma. (Shades of Star Trek 3!) Then it cools down and
re-solidifies for another half-billion years...

Also, it seems that all the rock on Venus has had all the water content
boiled out, making it ten times as hard as Earth rock. As a result,
mountains can be higher and far more steep-sided than on Earth, where the
softer rock would cause them to slump. So Venus has almost-vertical
multi-kilometer-high cliffs, even though the gravity is similar to Earth\'s.

Mars might also be considered as a model for low-hydrosphere worlds. Most
of the water has seeped into the ground and become permafrost. There are no
signs of continent-building on Mars - instead there are huge shield
volcanoes such as Olympus Mons. But the lack of plate tectonics is probably
a result its small size - it has lost enough heat to become geologically
inactive - rather than its lack of oceans.

Both planets suggest lots of interesting locales for Traveller adventures:
thick-crust worlds undergoing total surface renewal, or non-tectonic worlds
with shield volcanos that reach right out of the atmosphere (hmm, good spot
for a spaceport!)...

Look for a recent book on the solar system, or wander the web for planet
data, and you\'ll find all sorts of weird locales for your scenarios.

Have fun,

Well, it looks like, for game purposes, you might be right.
But realism?  I worry.  I hope Mr. Berry and others working

Hmm, but charging down the halls of a starship into braced, steadied,

mechanics don\'t make axes a wise choice in that situation.  But from
what you say, I worry.

That\'s just the point.  3He fusion doesn\'t produce Neutrons (which are dangerous).  It gathers the electricity directly (or more directly than from heat -> mechanical -> electricity).

GEEZ! No wonder TL-12 PAD sites scared the bejeezus out of RCES troops

things with some deep meson sites and you can turn close orbit into an

The officer safety classes for the police here in Calgary teach that, if you
haven\'t drawn your weapon, and you\'re facing a man with a knife who is within 30
feet of you, you\'re in deep trouble. Your opponent will be able to close and
attack before your gun will clear its holster.

I don\'t recall if the basic MT rules give a penalty for drawing a weapon, but
they certainly don\'t allow for this case. The police officer, wouldn\'t be able
to interrupt the guy with the knife. My players and I discussed this, and
tweaked it so that the police officer is not considered "engaged in HTH combat"
until the knife-wielder actually attacks. That way he _can_ attempt an
interrupt.

*whimper*

What do people think?  Right now, we\'ve brought back Recoil and Signature
for ACQ.  Recoil affects the cost of using a weapon, and signature is sort
of nebulous, but is used to define the difficulty of spotting a concealed
firer.  Add in a completely different way of handling autofire, and we\'re
at the point where we are going to need a new armory to cover all the neat
bits in weaponry.

Do y\'all want some sort of "weapon bulk" stat?

In ACQ, if the SMGs had no chance of penetrating the armor (likely in the
case of battledress), the folks in battledress can ignore the fire and move
into contact and start flailing about with axes.

If there is any danger from the defenders, they attackers have to make a
task to act under the surpressive fire.

Hmmm... A little device that only allows the registered owner to fire the
weapon?  Reading the palm/finger print of the wielder perhaps? (Drawback:
what if the shooter is wearing gloves?)

Onboard ship, I\'d have the weapons smartlinked to the ship\'s computer.  The
computer recognizes crew members authorized weapons and disables weapons in
unauthorized hands.  Anything from freezing the firing mechanism to actual
destruction of important parts.  This wouldn\'t affect purely mechanical
weapons like revolvers, which is probably why so many merchant Captains
carry the things!

These are written from a Milieu:0 perspective.  Adjusting the rules as
written to a more standard anti-psi Imperial campaign would require some work.

I\'d just like to say as a member of a minority that recieves the same sort
of threats and hate that is written into PI, that the end result of that (a
universe where psionics are hunted down and killed), makes ever more wary
of the real-world haters.  Great job all around.

An assumption at best.  The rule of man was so superficial that I
don\'t see trying to impose how the common people measure and
package.

In any case, we are talking about _millenia_ since then, metric
so far is a flash in the pan compared to that.

You can assume that they use metric, but that is hardly the only viable
assumption.  The odds are good that the Imperium uses a system of
measurement that is neither metric or English and it makes sense
to, when you translate dialog to the English language, to translate
the measurements to whatever system ones players are most confortable
with.

I don\'t agree.  Anywhere off the Xboat route, any ship travelling
systematically in one direction will be likely too.  In any case,
if you have _any_ ships that get ahead, that means that a ship
can always claim to be one of those.

Good luck getting an accurate answer.

I believe Mr. Miller has said that he _hopes_ to have T5
published in the fall of 1999.

I hope that there would be an announcement when he does
make an agreement with publisher.

Easiest thing would be to have an electronic action (gauss weapons
come to mind) which is linked to a microchip/scanner in the weapon
grip(s) containing the owner\'s DNA code. An invalid match results
in the weapon simply not working. I\'d assume such a feature to be
available at the lowest TL which allows complete DNA sequence
reading and microchip manufacture.

An example of this kind of effect can be found in the classic scifi
book, "Logan\'s Run". An even nastier version could include a microcharge
in the grip(s) which detonates with the force of a weak grenade if the
weapon continues to be held by unauthorized personnel.

I\'d limit it to customized civilian or covert weapons, though. Full
body armor of the kind worn by most military units (cloth, CE suits,
etc.) tends to get in the way of a decent DNA scan on the hands, paws,
or other holding appendage. Assuming the armor includes some kind of
glove or gauntlet, of course.

  Some sort of user-ID (as well as IFF) would be quite useful in shipboard
quarters, particularly if the ref likes gadgets like remote or response
activated weapons (set weapons\' electronics [radar sight?] to blast away at
first target seen when a door slides aside, etc., or leave a laser weapon
set up to blaze away at anything to cross its\' line of fire).

  If you did use such options then it would make sense that targets from 
the same ships\' troops contingent would require manual operation, and that
only an authorized user (appropriate combat armour suit/squad/detachment)
could set a weapon for non-manual operation.

  Perhaps a finger-print reader on the pistol-grip (or retina scanner on
the integrated electronic sight? - eye control of many shoulderarm or suit
functions is quite practical in a no-hands situation as long as you\'ve got
practice and steady nerves).

A guass rifle could be limited in acceleration enough only to injure a
hijacker sitting in the computer room, so that the rounds do not over
penetrate and damage the computer.  This could be used with the densitometer
sensors of the ship.

You could always get a small passive chip mounted in a glove/hand that gets
interrogated by a sensor in the grip. I believe that a number of TL8 cars use
something similar in their keys as part of the immobiliser system.

Actually S&W is working on this right now, as a way of protecting cops
from being shot with their own guns. A sensor in the grip picks up a
signal from a ring they wear on their gun hand. IIRC it is close to if
not in production.

Of course this makes a really sick truth about being married to your
gun, but...:-0

Given the probable prevalence of \'data rings\' as described im M0, and
the current \'java ring\' technology which is so similar, ther could be a
lot of smart data fed a gun in a Trav world, from \'This person is
authorized to fire this weapon\' to \'This is Joe, on the firing range he
consistently fires high and to the left...compensate!\' to \'This is
Sally. her normal carry and practice weapon is a Gridlore P325a. This
Famille Grungebucker 75 is lighter with higher recoil. She\'ll fire high
and right after the first shot. Compensate her sights!\'

Definitely check out the NASA and Jet Propulsion Lab sites for planetary

I\'ve found an *awesome* "flythrough" video of the surface of Venus using
the Magellan radar map. Absolutely incredible and perfect for video
from surface probes used as part of an adventure. Some freeware players
on the Web even allow you to pause and reverse the video.

Just do a search using the keywords "Venus" and "Magellan". Keep in mind,
though, that these .MOV files are *big* (i.e. anywhere from 2 to 23 meg!)

The point is that they are not standard metric (let along SI
units).  They don\'t really have any advantage over any other
unit of volume (unless you plan on floating your ships in
liquid hydrogen :-).

Vehciles doesn\'t.  Based on playtest draft, GT introduces a unit called
"hull class" which ships can be rated by.  It is 500 cf (which just
"happens" to be about a displacment ton).  This was done to avoid
confusion with a "real ton".

Actually, no. The *winners* were. And they fought hard to win. 

That\'s a *good* example of a *different* culture. We have trouble with
the idea of people *wanting* to be sacrificed.

Actually, in most "belts", you\'d use the jump drive every time you
decide it\'s time to hit one of the *big* bases (either for supplies or
to sell ore). An "in system" jump is a heck of a lot faster than any
other means of crossing multiple AUs.

Consider that *our* asteroid belt has a "circumference" of something
like 30 AU! 

I don\'t think "small craft" have enough life support for the sort of
trip durations you\'re looking at.

But as of DOS 6, DOS no longer supports FCB file access calls. DOS 1

Actually, I\'d expect them to be a lot like the busier US airports. If
you domn\'t have a transponder, you aren\'t *allowed* into the traffic
pattern. It\'s too much of a hassle for ATC to keep track of you.

Likewise, the really small ships, and small craft may not be allowed to
land/dock at the main port. They get to use the secondary port. Sort of
like here in Portland. You fly an airliner (even the little puddle
jumper commuter ones) or a corporate jet, and you get to use Portland
International. If you are flying a private *prop* plane, you get to
land across the river at Pierson Air Park, or out at the Hillsboro
airport (about 10 and 20 miles from PDX, respectively).

Your 100 ton scout may wind up at some minor facility in the boonies,
because you aren\'t important enough for the main port to want you
messing up their nice traffic patterns.

The moon skimming idea was pretty much clobbered a *long* time ago.
Venus just managed to bake all the CO2 out of the crust, while Earth has
*huge* deposits of carbonate rock, and of carbon (coal & oil).

Let our "greenhouse" effect run away, and we might wind up like Venus too.

To have a substantial atmosphere, you need high gravity, *or* you can
just dump enough gases on a planet and they\'ll hang around for a while.

For example, if you gave the moon a breathable atmosphere it\'d take
somewhere between a few centuries and a few millenia for it to get too
thin to breathe.

So a *young* planet, especially one with lots of volcanic activity
might have a moderately dense atmosphere. 

Or you can place it way out in the system. Titan has an atmosphere
about as dense as Earth\'s. But it\'s far enough from the Sun that solar
radiation doesn\'t breakdown a lot of the heavier molecules, and it\'s
cold enough that the lighter ones have trouble escaping.

So you can go with cold, massive, or new.

Yeah. Standard Traveller sensors pick up ships to well outside 100
diameters. They wont neccessarily get a good enough signal for an ID, but
that is what radio message and an investigating launch is for.

Backed up by a couple of Little Bubba long-range thruster-plate powered
kinetic-kill missiles, of course.

Total system cost will be around MCr 100, which means any dirtball can
afford it, if it is prepared to outsource it\'s custom duties business to
Famile Spofulam\'s Finance Division, of course.

Funny you should mention that.... In my work on the Interstellar Wars era I was 
confronted by exactly this problem (ie it make no sense for the 1st Imperium to 
use SI units) and I\'ve started working on a Vilani measurement system (I 
posted some basic work on the Trav-lang list a few months back) and I will be 
developing my Vilani ships and equipment using this system (if there is any 
interest I\'ll post what I\'ve done so far). It might seem like a minor point, but I 
think the extra depth is well worth the effort.

Its not the game system, its the background setting (though I would point out 
that a significant portion of Traveller material comes from places other than the 
US nowadays :*>). I can see why _the 3rd Imperium_ might use SI units, I 
can\'t see why they would use Imperial/American units. To me the dichotomy 
detracts from the overall background of the setting. Its not that I can\'t 
think/visualise in the units, its that they don\'t "fit" with the setting; when I run 
games for Cthuhlu by Gaslight I use Imperial units because they "fit" the 
setting, when I run Traveller games I use SI units because they "fit" the setting.

Realize that in that particular situation, you aren\'t in HTH combat yet.
You charge down the hallway to get into HTH, I can interrupt you

Let\'s say I miss, and you get into HTH combat range (or do some other
tactic that takes advantage of cover and whatnot to get to HTH).
We\'re bumping chests with each other, suddenly a melee weapon
may have an advantage over a rifle.

I would, however, allow people using very short firearms (pistols, some
SMG\'s) to treat those weapons as HTH combat weapons. Anyone
ever hear of Gunkata (sp?)? It\'s a close-combat martial arts style
where, instead of a sword or nunchaku, the weapon is a handgun.
Not a style one uses for sport, of course - I think it comes from the
Hong Kong organized crime scene.

I\'ve also heard of a training program for police officers and security
specialists that teaches you how to use your gun effectively in
bad situations - when you\'ve been knocked down, when someone
is struggling with you, etc. Very different than the training one would
get on a regular pistol range, or even a combat simulator.

OTOH, I would expect that the system used in the 3I is a decimal-based
one, as humaniti is geared toward base-10 number systems.  Using metric,
the decimal-based system used throughout late-20th century Terra
(_including_ the US, or at least the US armed forces), makes more sense,
in game terms, than either inventing a new measurement system, or using
feet, inches, pounds, etc.  While inventing a new system would greatly
enhance the futuristic feel of an SF RPG, it would make things more
difficult for the late-20th century human players to get an intuitive
feel for what the measurements represent.  As for using the American
variant of Imperial measurements, that system negates any sense of
rational measurements that one would expect of a star-spanning culture
such as the 3I.

Yeah, I saw that on CNN tonite.  No specs on the specific impulse or guestimated thrust of that puppy, either.  Anybody know where you can cop specs on it?

According to the site http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds1/

Ion drive   peak      lowest    
   power    2.3kW       500W
   thrust    92mN        20mN
   impuls  3100s       1900s

From the site:

              The ion propulsion system (IPS), provided by NSTAR, uses a
              hollow cathode to produce electrons to collisionally ionize
              xenon. The Xe+ is electrostatically accelerated through a
              potential of up to 1280 V and emitted from the 30-cm thruster
              through a molybdenum grid. A separate electron beam is
              emitted to produce a neutral plasma beam. The power
              processing unit (PPU) of the IPS can accept as much as 2.5 kW,
              corresponding to a peak thruster operating power of 2.3 kW and
              a thrust of 92 mN. Throttling is achieved by balancing thruster
              and Xe feed system parameters at lower power levels, and at the
              lowest thruster power, 500 W, the thrust is 20 mN. The specific
              impulse decreases from 3100 s at high power to 1900 s at the
              minimum throttle level.

  If the original manufacturers\' (or rebuilt) transponder info for starships
built in the late Third Imperium weren\'t available to the appropriate parties
then one can only conclude that the central gov\'t considers the availability
of such a database undesirable.

  Explaining such a situation would be quite interesting.

Actually, the Rule of Man lasted about 400 years more than enough time to 
metricate even the Vilani :*> But they didn\'t have to metricate the entire Ziru 
Sirka just the 17 or so worlds that became the Sylean Federation. Its quite 
possible that the RoM would have sought to have stamped its authority by 
imposing both Anglic, SI units and the Terran calendar; there are countless 
precidents throughout history (and it exactly what the 3I did with the Office of 
Calendar Complience).

This for me is one of the things that sets Traveller apart from many other 
games; just why does a vast cosmopolitan interstellar Empire use the weights, 
measures, calendar of one world (albeit a very important world). In many other 
games if this issue was addressed at all, it would be simply explained away as 
above; but Traveller takes the little bit of extra trouble to present a rational 
explaination as to why these units are still used. For me, its details like this 
that really count.

That of course depends how long the trip is and if the colonists can 
be in cold storage or not.  You can fit 4 people in an emergency low 
berth, 1 in a standard low berth and 2 in a small stateroom.  Is cost 
an issue?

This would give it a density only slightly lower than pure Tungsten or

According to my copy (or the errata sheet that came with it, which dates
from 1990), you can interrupt when you are in melee, but you can only
interrupt your opponent.

Assuming running two people to a small staterrom, the accomidations alone
will be 2 million d-tons.  This doesn\'t include life support, power plants,
gravitics, drives, etc.

A better bet would be the 6-7 million range.

If you put everbody in low berths, it still isn\'t much better, but the ship
could priobably be brought in at around 4 million d-tons.

Exactly my point.  And I\'m not comfortable with American units.  (I went
metric three years before Canada did so officially, because I found the
metric system far more logical. Took some arguing to convince my teachers,
though:-)

Alternatively, we could use, say, Sumerian units. They would give a Vilani
flavour to the game, and I suspect _everyone_ would be equally
uncomfortable. I\'ll volunteer to write Sumerian conversion software...

Just curious because I read your stuff a lot and have not read anything to

It is still possible to care for minorities without belong to any of them.
I myself do, and I am a white male currently studyign at a University. I
can\'t stand racists, as well as anyone else who tries to impose their
\'superior\' world view on anyone else. I am not religious, but my view on
religion is that people can follow any religion (or lack of religion) they
want, as long as they do not harm anyone else, or try to stuff their
beliefs into the head of someone else. Religion (or lack of it) is a
personal choice, and not one someone else should determine for you.

Rant off.

That may be true (it depends a lot on what assumptions you make about traffic
to off-the-X-boat routes), but how many ships travel systematically in one
direction off the X-boat routes? Most Free Traders go where their trade and
freight opportunities take them  --  which is as likely to be back the way
they came (or at least in a triangle/circle) as further on.

Furthermore, while you are travelling at jump-2 away from the X-boat routes,
the X-boats are travelling at jump-4 along them. Which means that pretty soon
you reach systems that have heard of you from the other direction. So when
you claim to be the "Driven Snow", eight weeks out of Regina, System Control
will be able to see that no "Driven Snow" left Regina on the date claimed.

I\'m not sure it holds water, but it is by far the best explanation I\'ve
seen so far. My next pirates will be of this kind.

Number 14.

Sorry... ;-)

The analogy fails because 18th cebtury merchants couldn\'t teleport from
just outside their origin harbor to just outside their destination harbor
and because the relative detection ranges of 18th Century warships and
Traveller warships are very different. I agree that the Imperial Navy
can\'t be everywhere, but they don\'t need to be. The proportion of ships
to places that need to be patrolled is far higher for the Imperial Navy
than it was for the Royal Navy.

Now, that I can relate to. But...

Trouble is, that will cut into the "cruising time" for the pirate.

Trouble with that is that free traders scrabbling for their next bank
payment could IMO be almost as desperate as pirates ("Well, boys, we have
a choice: Either we eat this week or we keep the ship. What\'ll it be?")
If you allow pirates to get away with this, you really ought to allow
PCs to get away with it too.

Watch the first step, it\'s a doozy. Getting enough strength together to

Yes, but can it prove it?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
This is something I think the planetary authorities will have to prove, 
IMO. Here is my reasoning:

A ship comes into port claiming to be _Mae Lee_, a rebuild hull under
new registry from a backwater planet five or six parsecs away.
Starport control has never heard of _Mae Lee_ before, and says
"prove that what you say is true". The captain asks, "How?"

Do the port authorities impound the ship until this irregularity can
be straightened out? If _Mae Lee_\'s port of origin is off the X-Boat
routes, a message there and back could take two to three months.
If _Mae Lee_ is working off a ship payment, we\'re talking hundreds
of thousands of credits she needs to make every month. Even when
she\'s sitting in an impound orbit.

Do the port officials get a remission put on the payments?

"To: Sky Marshal, Poppel System: regarding your request that we
let the captain of _Mae Lee_ miss a few payments. You must be
kidding. Sincerely, VP Amicoau, Rou San Finance Inc."

Do the port officials make the payments themselves? This irregularity
investigation just cost several hundred thousand credits or more.
Unless the port officials get to seize the ship if the papers are wrong,
I don\'t see this happening - if they do, I could see some system
governments willing to gamble, depending on how many irregularities
turned out to be innocent and how many got them a ship.

Since a stolen ship will usually go to the rightful owner, I don\'t see
the government getting to seize and keep/sell the ship. An otherwise
legitimate ship using a faked transponder - is that a serious enough
offense, in and of itself, for the ship to be seized?

If the captain of _Mae Lee_ is stuck with the payments on his ship
while his ship is in impound, chances are he\'s going to lose her.
If your planet\'s government gets a reputation for red tape that costs
people their starships, they will stop coming - especially if your planet
is just another nothing-special world that usually only sees independent
traders. 

If you\'re on a low-traffic trace, it\'s quite possible that all the other free
trader captains on that trace will know what you did to _Mae Lee_.
They\'re an independent-minded lot, certainly, but that doesn\'t mean
they won\'t decide your world deserves to lose all off-planet trade for
a year or so. This happens to a planet once, it may never (unless
crimes by false-registered ships becomes a problem) give anyone
trouble about their transponders again.

Big companies should never see this problem. Their ships are almost
always along or near the major communication routes, and they
probably have an agent on each world they visit with enough pull
to smooth over any such irregularities.

People who are playing tricks with transponders should, of course,
stay away from major communication routes.

I let PC\'s get away with both this and field maintenance. They pay a
price for it, though - no carrying of paying passengers when using
minimal (abysmal) life support, not to mention having to put up with
a ship that smells like six people and a tree rat. <g> Not to mention
that if they get boarded by a customs patrol, they\'ll get lots of extra
looks and suspicion because, quite simply, it will look like a pirate
ship. Ever see a PC Traveller group that was comfortable with more
attention from the authorities?  

As for field maintenance, they\'ll almost certainly fail any safety inspection
(which could happen at any class A or B starport, and will happen
if they go in for legitimate annual maintenance). This will impound their
ship until it is repaired up to spec - taking more time and money, by
quite a bit, than they saved by doing it themselves.

Not to mention the occaisional GM-imposed equipment failures caused
by not following the guidelines in the Owner\'s manual...<g>

If you are linked to your armor, the DNA/signature system is not a

chip built into all Squad Support Weapons.

Could also have an override device which allows certain armorers, NCOs

Mass: about 500kg (0.5tonnes)
Thrust: about 50mN on the average, with a range between 100 to 20 mN

I hope I got my summs right!  Here it goes...

50mN = 0.00005 Thrust tons (kN)
0.00005Tth/0.5tonnes = 0.0001 G

Hmmm, one ten-thousandth of a G,  pretty slow in my book.  But then again,
the advantage is that it can sustain that acceleration constantly for a
longer duration than that of a rocket.

So, anyone want to figure out some new FF&S rules so we can slap these
babies on our TL-8 Freighters?

I\'ll start the ball rolling with these facts:
it produces 92mN using 2.3kw of power and 20mN using 0.5kw of power
this factors to 40mN per kw.

It also uses 110kg of liquid gasses for reaction mass. 28kg of hydrazine
and 82kg of xenon.  Duration and fuel consumption are not mentioned.

There does not seem to be any data on what the engine alone masses or
volumes as, but I\'ll keep looking!

This maximum distance is completely separate from how quickly you traverse the 7.7 light years (which is what your numbers were referring to).
Therefore, I think a stutterwarp would be an interesting variation in a Traveller universe for tramp type ships to wander around on the Mains, but would not be especially useful in going across the rifts (where Jump 6 is just barely enough in some places).

Depends on your requirements.  Steerage passage (per World Tamer\'s Handbook) is
2 people per ton of cargo space, and this is by far the cheapest way to
transport a huge number of people.  However, that density is probably subject
to riot conditions, and virtually guaranteed if the trip takes more than one
jump.

Heh.  No, U238 is incapable of going critical.  However, I suspect that
unrefined uranium contains enough U235 that a planet-sized mass would be
supercritical.

Well, this is an assumption.  I can easily see the Vilani having
a non-decimal system.

Also, one can take the approach that the Imperium is using some
decimal and system and when you translate it for game play
(like you translate from from Galanglic to English) you choose
a decimal system, but one might also decide to translate to the
system of measurement that most are familiar with.

Which I have no arguement with.  It shouldn\'t be much trouble
to keep using them.  I used metric in my GURPS Traveller universe
and found the issue surrounding do so to be minor as make the amount
to do about it being expressed here suprising.

This is much like if the US suddenly ruled the entire world.  Would
everyone switch from metric to English units?  I doubt it.

Even if so, you then have the Long night and standards will drift
with each region developing it\'s own version of the standard, reverting
to an old standard, or adopting new ones.

I don\'t find it impossible that the Imperium uses metric.  I do think
it is _far_ from certain.

Well, almost every ship that been purchased is going to moving
to where it will be used, probably trading along the say.  Remember,
it only takes a few ships for this to be common enough for it to
be a possible explination.

It also raises the issue of how controlling a society we see the
Imperium.  We are talking about more required identification than
the US uses today, in a society with fast communciation.  However,
it is still true that records aren\'t always timely (I couldn\'t call
some friends last week because directory assistance didn\'t have
their number weeks after the phone had been activated).  In the
Imperium, with limited communications, the task of moving transponder
codes, and all the other data of a similar nature that one would then
assume the keep, to every system in a timely manner is daunting.
That is why all these transponders strike me as similar to the
claimed "America in space" sydrome (except here it is modern western
society in space).  We take fast communication for granted and
don\'t realize what a different world it would be otherwise.

So you claim to be more recently out.

     As you will note the ship is very much built oversized.  This allowed
for the 26,000-tons of cargo, more than enough to contain structures and
machinery for the new colony.  The jump drive is over sized as well to
allow colonies to be build a significant distance away.  The ship also has
the facilities to build most anything the colony need in the way of small
equipment, as well as the laboratory space to deal with any problems your
world may throw at the new colonists.  A 925,000-ton hull is the smallest I
was able to get 250,000 low berth pods into, and that required removing all
the cargo and most of the other add-ons I\'ve included here.  Enjoy.

I\'m bisexual.  *Everybody* thinks we\'re perverted.

The effect is similar, since both psionics and people of non-standard
orientation are invisible.  Our status isn\'t evident unless we tell you
about it, or try to excercise our rights.  I\'ve had to sit through some of
the most rabid anti-gay rhetoric in silence, because speaking up would have
lead to violence.  Psionic people would face a similar situation.

For a comparison of the styles, and a look at how deeply this hatred runs,

Instead of the ship that was listed, take a look at David Drake\'s novel,
_Red_Liners_.  They colony ship they used was basicly a one-way disposable
structure that was intended to be the initial housing for the colony when
it arrived at its destination.  They carried cargo as well, but they were
built for one trip, or in the case of the Traveller Universe, several
jumps, and then landing on the destination world.

In this case, I would see the craft being in the 10Mt. range with the crew
actually being part of the colonization group.  This would allow upkeep on
the ship and offer a skilled pool of labor from the outset.

Another possibility is that of something similar to the SDB/Jump Shuttle
arrangement ot Battle Tender/Battle Rider setup where the actual payload
for the colony is nothing more than an in-system craft and the J-Drives are
based on a reusable tender.  Extrapolating this a bit farther, you could
then have the tender make round trips to several colonies carrying
supplies, additional colonists, news, and acting as a neutral party to
resolve disputes.  This could in the long term actually make such a craft
profitable.  After all, when the 3I retires those Battle Tenders they have
to go somewhere, right?

Just a few random ideas, YMMV.

Later!

Ion engines are already listed in the TNE FFS.  You can get about 0.0025 m/s/s
acceleration out of them assuming you have no payload, i.e. just an engine and
power plant. (plus a year\'s fuel).

<SNIP of discussion of payments while in impundment>

I would say that when the local official becomes suspicious he sends a 
report to the subsector administration and/or Regina explaining the 
situation. He would also send the hull number, ID-number of crew, photos 
etc.. He would not impund them but would of course try to detain them by 
checking the ship for faulty papers, neglected maintanance (your not 
leaving my yard with a containment bottle that looks like that mister!) 
and likewise. If the ship turns up clean then his work is for nothing 
but if it isn\'t then the hunt begins (*) with X-boat J-4 couriers (spies 
and pirates get chased by J-6 and the IN) bringing the warrant to all 
starports and navies in the Imperium making it hard for the ship to 
operate. 

(*) That little detail would best be solved by the 400-year Viliani old 
detective agency "The Jinkerton Detectives" (PC:s of course).<g>

Hmmm -- what if the PC:s end up (unknowingly) chasing Zodhani spies 
fleeing the Imperium. worth thinking about...

>People who are playing tricks with transponders should, of course, 
>stay away from major communication routes.

Or be put out of business pretty fast (assuming that playing with 
transpoders is a somewhat serious crime or that the "business" is).

This metod has the advantage of beeing cheap, easy, pretty efficient 
(none gets away in the long run), doesn\'t hinder trade and (important 
for roleplaying) isn\'t impossible to fool (for awhile) if you run fast 
enough.

The stage is set for a multisector car-chase...

<<snips description of 1,000,000 Td ship that relies on 250,000
emergency low berths to move the requisite number of colonists>>

A couple of problems here.  First, you _seriously_ underestimated the
number of medical personnel one would need to revive that many low
passengers.  At one medic/doctor per 20 low passengers (FF&S v2, pg.
77), you need 50,000 medical personnel to tend to reviving the low
passengers, with 1 sickbay/2 medical crew.  Since each sickbay requires
8 Td (FF&S v2 Table 8), your sickbay space alone takes 200,000 Td (not
to mention the accomodations for 50,000 medical personnel).

Further, as FF&S v2 states on page 78:

	The emergency low berth sacrifices careful preparation for quick
hibernation.  Capable of holding four normal humans, it can drop its
occupants into hibernation in less than sixty seconds, fully clothed and
without any preparation.  The down side is that the revival process is
extremely tricky and requires careful monitoring by skilled personnel. 
They are only used in life-or-death situations, when a ship is rendered
otherwise uninhabitable.

Given the above, you would likely need even more medics and sickbays,
but we\'ll be generous and assume that you cna get by with the standard
number.

I can see a totalitarian dictatorship using emergency low berths as
colonist transports, only because it would take armed force to get
people to ship that way.

If you need a minimum sized ship, you\'re better off assuming that the
unwashed masses hot-cot in bunks or staterooms (three shifts).  It\'s
nearly as space effective (especially if given meager rations), and,
though deeply unpleasant, _much_ safer for the passengers.  It also
requires far fewer medical personnel (and thus far fewer sickbays).

Can you say "steerage"?  I thought you could.

If I were building a single ship for 1,000,000 colonists, I\'d spring for
double- occupancy small staterooms, and go with a ship of somewhere
around 1,500,000-2,000,000 Td.  (I\'ll have to work one out.)  Frankly,
though, given jump drive technology and durable ships, I\'d build several
smaller colony ships, and shuttle colonists over a period of months to
the new world.  That gives you even better space utilization (as each
bunk or stateroom can be used more than once), better crew utilization
(one medic can serve for several flights, each time supporting 120 awake
middle/steerage passengers), and gives you a more economically useful
fleet of ships at the end of the exercise.  Also, the first wave of
colonists can be set to work building infrastructure, both for
themselves and for succeeding waves.

Have you seen the Fleets book yet (new design system, loads of ships and
the B5 sourced vector movement rules).

We playtested a Traveller Full Thrust conversion at Gen Con UK. It worked
quite well - a AHL cruiser with 4 PF Sloans against 3 Zho 15kT Battle
Riders and 6 destroyers (equal to the Midu A...... class). The outcome was
interesting....

CJ Cherryh\'s "Heavy Time" has some interesting thoughts on Asteroid mining....

     The figure I put forth are those from FF&S and have no limitation as
listed.  In the section on drives it even lists the need to discharge as an
optional rule to slow your PC\'s down.  There is no rule in that supplement
(i.e. for TNE) that lists a maximum number of parsecs you may travel before
discharging.  In point of fact our GM ruled that our R&D department had not
yet been able to get the thing to work past  3 parsecs (His way of limiting
our movements) and in the equation for efficiency the TL is removed
increasing the amount of power we have to supply by a very large percent
(200% or better, another way to slow us down.).  Still Stutterwarp would be
much more effective even with the limitations you mentioned from 2300.  The
efficiency is the number of parsecs per day, if yours is 2 then every 64
hour you can travel 2 parsecs, take a look at you nearest main and see how
fast your ship could travel from one end to the other.  Add a Jump 3 drive
(I know it reduces the amount of cargo) and now your ship can move between
mains.  There are no rules regarding the number of drive types you can
include in your ship other than those of space and money.
