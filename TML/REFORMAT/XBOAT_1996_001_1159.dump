    'body' => 'I\'ve seen the "legality of armor" debate waged on many lists for many games
in genre, and tried to manage the issue myself in several campaigns. From
what I\'ve seen, the best approach is to look at the background of whatever
world - whether a universe or a single planet or city - and work from
there.

As for high Law worlds, it seems to me that the authorities are concerned
with being able to enforce the laws, and would likely have regulations if
not rules against people walking about in defensive gear that the
authorities cannot overcome. Police forces armed with simple gauss pistols
would not want to let someone roam their precinct in Combat Armor or
Battledress - but then, it\'s also unlikely that any actions by any part in
that precinct will require such.

I use this line of reasoning against players who try to argue "it\'s only
defense - it doesn\'t hurt anyone". The Law needs to be able to take you
down, and they don\'t want to have to call out the National Guard or a SWAT
team to do it.

Of course, on such worlds there will likely be other methods of penalizing
impregnable characters. One would be strict regulation of their vessel -
impounding it if needed. They may also have mechanical or electronic
devices, or even software (Virus!) that allows them to render your armor
useless (espedcially Battledress). On a smaller level, extremely high Law
level planets may require the implanting of tracers, chemical modifiers, or
other means of quelling an individual. If you act bad, they don\'t shoot
you, they just activate the Prozac-sac implanted in you by the Port
Authority :)

Of course, in the case of guerilla operations, anything goes, but in that
case, I would fall back on the words of Jason Carter, an excellent player
and GM from my days in Tacoma: What\'s good for the PCs is good for the NPCs
:)

I like the idea of having them all together in one place, but there\'s one
problem.  I didn\'t appreciate it until they came out with TNE miniatures,
but _Traveller_ starships are, on the whole, the *dullest* things in known

>I\'m wondering if anyone else noticed this problem...

  The problem he refers to is that, as presented in the old Alien Module,
Zhodani society becomes top-heavy very quickly.  The underlying
reason for this is that there is "no way down".  No provisions are given
for a decrease in social standing, leading to a society that is
overwhelmingly made up of nobles in just a dozen generations.
  When I brought this up with Loren Wiseman three years ago (on GEnie), he
reminded me of one large factor: the roll to determine PSI is an artifact of
_Player Character_ generation.  The whole population does not just roll 2d6
for Psionic Talent.  Only a small percentage is psionic at all.  This slows
the social climber problem in Zhodani society quite a bit, even if you
assume that the Zhodani have a higher percentage of psionic latents than
Imperial Humaniti tends to (an arguable assumption).  This doesn\'t _solve_
the problem, however.

 For my purposes, I decided that Intendants and Nobles may only pass their
titles on to _one_ child.  The rest fall to the next rung down.  Thus most
of a Noble\'s kids are Intendants, and most of an Intendant\'s kids are Proles.
This is just the beginning, since every child is tested for psionic potential,
and may well rise on their own talents.
 As an additional wrinkle, only the two lowest ranks of nobility are passed
along at all!  These correspond to Social Standing rolls of 11 and 12.
These presumably are local and/or planetary levels.  You cannot be born to
serve in the Consulate High Council!
 The first change explains, for instance, how it is possible to be born
an Intendant (with an initial SOC roll of 10). The second change is
reflected in the social structure of the Zhodani already: You must be
elected to serve at any level above the city/community level, and that
election is (usually) held by your peers at each level. Truly high office
is _always_ based on individual effort and talent.

 So what do the two levels of hereditary nobility mean?  I could accept
that the upper level is awarded to a family for high service by an
ancestor.  Families with ancestors who served on the High Council would
tend to be at this level, as would the descendants of great heroes. It
could also serve as another rung on the inheritance ladder, producing the
following:

 SOC 12 - one child is SOC 12, the rest are SOC 11
 SOC 11 - one child is SOC 11, the rest are SOC 10 (Intendants)
 SOC 10 - one child is an Intendant, the rest are Proles
 SOC 9 or less - all children are Proles.

 On the upward side, as described in the Alien Module, we get:

 All children are tested for psionic potential
 Prole children who test at PSI 9+ are made Intendants.
 Intendants can become nobles (SOC 11) via the Psionic Games or as a reward
   for service.
 Nobles are fully participating members of the Consulate government, and
   may advance through the various levels of Council by the votes of their
   peers.

 And my own addition:

 Nobles who give exemplary service to the Consulate have their hereditary
   rank raised to SOC 12.

 Hope this helps,

So far we have: 

1) tranq rounds for snub pistols and gauss weapons
2) gas rounds for snub pistols and shotguns 
3) Neural weapons at TL 16
4) Tasers written up in Challenge # 40

This seems rather scanty compared to the vast legions of deadly hardware
which abounds in the Imperium.  Has anyone else added to this?  I would
think that there would be a significant number of options, especially in
the TL 12-15 range. 

I\'m not sure of stats for these, but one which come to mind are:

1) Sonic stunners, TL 12?
2) Electro-lasers (ie wireless, dart-less tasers), TL 13?
3) Tangle grenades/shotgun shells (quick hardening glob which entangles a 
   single target), TL 10?
4) Lower the tech level of neural weapons to TL 15 (they are (generally)
   non-lethal, and much less deadly than even a gauss pistol).

The sonic stunners may be a bit outside the Imperium paradigm, but the
electro-lasers and tangle grenades sound like they should work. 

Comments?  Other ideas?

	Perhaps that shows the wargame roots of Traveller as well as any 
other aspect of the system.  
	In all the systems I\'ve GM\'d, only very rarely have nonlethal 
weapons been a popular item.  The needle guns with tranquilizer needles 
were popular in one game, I recall (Shadowrun?).  In Star Frontiers, the 
stun gun was popular.  In Champions, the superheros rarely used lethal 
methos (in fact, most characters didn\'t even HAVE lethal powers).  But I 
don\'t recall any other games in which the characters chose nonlethal 
methods when others were available.
	So much for my theories of why things are the way they are in 
Traveller. 
	As far as adding more non-lethal weapons, why not?  Would it 
affect game balance?  It would depend on what sort of defenses were 
available, and how easily obtainable the items were.  If there aren\'t 
many defenses to them, then they should be as difficult to obtain as 
PGMP-15\'s.  But if we assume the normal defenses available to adventurers 
will be as effective with non-lethal weaponry, then perhaps they could be 
commonly available items.  After all, in 20th century America it isn\'t 
difficult to get stun guns, mace, pepper spray, etc.
	It wouldn\'t be a bad thing to add them to the new Traveller...but 
I don\'t know whether many characters would use these items if available.

I think the CT double adventure Divine Intervention has sonic stunners
as PC special equipment.  I\'m suprised these didn\'t make it into MT,
as almost every other piece of postulated equipment has.

Weapons of Non-Leathal Intent (WNLI) are the big topic of discussion in several 
UN subcommittees right now.  The US DOD, Russia and the British MOD have done a 
lot of interesting research into it, and come up with some very Buck-Rodgers 
ideas, including Focussed-Concussion Explosives, Tasers, incapacitiating riot 
control gasses, stcky foam, dowel guns and sonic projectors.  However, each one 
of these weapons has been a miserable failure from a purely economic view; the 
cost of the weapons and manpower to incapacitiate one person with WNLI is at 
least ten times greater than with standard weapons.  In addition, each of the 
methods come up with thus far have very limited applications; they can either 
be easily blocked/avoided, or easily defended against.  The WNLI that are more 
effective at avoiding these defenses tend to be much more drastic and more 
potentially leathal.

I would suspect that Traveller has less WNLI due to the wargame background, but 
also because a WNLI that effects a human would effect aliens very differently; 
aliens might be unaffected by a concussion wave, or might die when exposed to a 
gas that incapacitates humans.  It would seem very unlikely that there would be 
one thing  (beyond plain old kinetic energy) that would effect all races 
equally, from either a WNLI or Leathal Weapon viewpoint.

Some interesting things to look for:
1)  Sonics.  There seems to be a lot of potential here.  Police and Military 
have had major success with a very simple Sonic WNLI, the Flash-Bang Concussion 
grenade.  There are some new experimental flash-bang rifle rounds soon to be 
produced, and the actual grenade continues to be improved (but remains quite 
dangerous to bystanders).  In the future, you might see major improvements in 
some of the experiemental crowd-control sound projectors used in China and 
Russia; imagine a hand-held weapon that immediately stuns an opponent, or fills 
the opponent with dread and terror.  In Traveller, I have always included 
sonics as part of the anti-hijacking routines on a ship.  The PA system can 
project sound waves to stun or calm others, and the floors can be set to v
ibrate harmonically with similar effects.
2) Light.  The Flash-Bang Grenades work as much from the shock of the bright 
flare as from the sound.  Scientists have found several different effects that 
strobing light has on human brains, and human reactions to bright light can be 
manipulated to a stun or similar incapacitiation effect.  Tom Clancy used a 
really spiffy sort of light projector in his last book as a WNLI weapon weilded 
by some CIA agents in Japan.

Weapons;

Nonleathal Arms Co. Gooey Gun+
This classic crowd control and perp apprehension tool fires a capsule full of 
polymer strands coated with a tacky, sticky adhesive which expand as the 
travel to the target - up to 30 meters away!  Be sure to order the "Goo Melt-
away"  aerosol or you won\'t be able to reclaim your catch for hours!

Gooey Gun	Min Range; 5m	Max. Range 30m	Short Range 5m	
	Covers 5 sq. m area (about 1 person)
Weapon is single shot, air pressure propelled, 90cm long, wt. 1.5Kg, Cr. 1600
Capsule is 40mm dia. X 110mm long, Box of 10 rounds 		Cr. 400
Goo Melt-away, aerosol melts goo instantly, 1 can=10 rnds	Cr. 100

Note; the gooey gun is available in an automatic vehicle mounted version for 
riot control.  Ask a representative for further details.
                     
[Stats not worked out, simply an automatic drum fed version of the above, 
complete with air-compressor.]

Electric Stunner+
Renders a suspect unconscious or disoriented for a brief period at close 
range.  Also leaves your perp with a nasty headache.  This version of stunner 
uses an electric charge - not sonics - to do the job.  This renders normal 
stunner countermeasures useless.

Non-lethal Hand Grenades
The only solution for riot control, personal protection from gang violence, 
or protecting your personal property.  All grenades are guaranteed to operate 
as specified and inspected by our quality control specialists.  They have the 
following common characteristics;
Wt. 0.5Kg	size; 30cm l. by 10 cm dia	Color coded.	Adjustable 
Timer (1 to 60 sec.)
Sold and priced in boxes of 12 only.  Usual persistence is about 2 minutes.

"Smoke and Light Show": makes a big bang, a blinding flash, and generates 
copious smoke to cover a 5m diameter circle.  Color coded white.	
						Cr. 240 / box

Smoke Only:  as above but leave out the bang and flash.  Colored Gray	
						Cr.200 / box

Concussion: momentarily stuns anyone in a medium sized (12 sq. meters) 
enclosed space who is not properly prepared (Please follow instructions 
carefully).  Colored blue	
						Cr. 480 / box
                                                
[proper preparation is to open your mouth and cover your ears; work on
a sudden overpressure principal]

Tear Gas   fills an area [circle] up to 5 m in diameter with an acrid vapor 
which causes burning eyes and severe disorientation to the unprotected. 
Colored yellow				
						Cr. 480 / box

Knockout Gas ; inhalant will render most people unconscious within 4 m of the 
source.  We recommend double coverage for certain results.  Releases a heavy 
duty inhalant sedative which will render the perp(s) unconscious for about 20 
minutes.		
	   					Cr. 620 / box

Knockout Gas ; transdermal effects as per the inhalant version, but nothing 
short of an environment suit will prevent the effects.	
						Cr. 1250 / box

Restraint Equipment

Constriction Bands:  Will respond only to grip of the person they are keyed 
to (or an emergency release device, provided).  Forget about thin wristed or 
double jointed perps, these conform to the suspects entire hands from the 
wrist up.				
						Cr. 500 / pair

Shock Collars:  An unremoveable collar paired with a special remote control 
which administers a shock whenever the bearer presses a button.  The shock is 
of an intensity sufficient to distract the perp from thinking of escape or 
disobedience without the possibility of serious injury.  Available in special 
sizes for Vargr and Aslan perps.	
		 			Cr. 1000 / collar
					Cr. 500 / contrlr

Gravitic Perp Transfer Case:  Having problems moving Perps around?  This 
coffin-shaped chamber will restrain a perp perfectly and its anti-grav units 
precisely counteract gravity to make transport by hand easily accomplished.  
external controls allow the administration of sedatives or other drugs 
without opening the case.  Liquid internal cushioning can compensate for up 
to 4 gravities of acceleration without injury.  Internal life support and 
waste elimination will last up to 8 hours.  The laminate composite shell 
is [mostly] impervious to small arms fire, and certainly up to whatever the 
guy inside can do.	
					Cr. 24,000

	I\'ve heard reports about the poor effectiveness of WNLI as well 
(particularly the sticky foam).

	This is an interesting possibility.  I would think that, in the 
future, they could do quite a bit with this.  Perhaps someone can come up 
with some specific weapons based on sonic technology, including specific 
game effects.

	It\'s interesting that both of these (light and sound) have a 
long, long history of usage in combat/dangerous situations.  The 
high-tech sticky foams and such are failures, while the most promising 
things spring from much older technology (although their current 
implementation may be through very high technology).

	Thank you for the great post!

How\'s\'about saying that the children of "honourary" nobles (ie those with no PSI
but born to psionics) are not automatically noble unless actively psionic? With
the social stigma of being a "handicapped" noble, it\'s probably less likely for
a PSI-less noble to attract a partner and have children.

Branching from this, as the Zho have been selecting for PSI for thousands of
years, does anyone apply house rules as to increased chance for psi abilities?

I seem to recall that somewhere it says that psionic potential is not at all

If you can get a hold of them, there were a number of alien modules
published for "Classic Traveller", one for each alien.  In no particular
order, these were:  Zhodani, Solomani, Aslan, Vargr, K\'Kree, Droyne, Hivers,
and Darrians.  Another rare but valuable resource is back issues of the
Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society.  The Contact!  section had valuable
information on alien races, often including character generation

Only two alien modules were ever published specifically for MegaTraveller:
Vilani & Vargr and Solomani & Aslan.  All of these are out of print, so
they\'re hard to get and are often expensive when you can.  The Referee\'s
Companion also included longer essays on Zhodani, Droyne, Vargr, and Aslan,
but no rules other than word generation.  Also, the Imperial Encyclopedia
(in the boxed set) includes articles on various alien races.  This isn\'t
much to go on, but it\'s a start.

Supposedly, an alien sourcebook will be a high priority for the latest
version of Traveller, coming out this August.  Until then, here are some
quick and dirty rules for generating Vargr and Aslan.  These are the major
aliens closest to humaniti and also the most likely to be found in the Imperium.

Vargr--Are weaker than humans and not as tough (-1 on strength and
endurance), but also more lithe and dextrous (+1 dexterity).  They may
enlist in any service, but suffer a -2 penalty to enlist in the Merchants.
In combat, Vargr may use their hands(normal), teeth(normal), or claws (-2).
Brawling skill for Vargr is called Infighting, and allows them to use all
their natural weapons.

Aslan--Are less dextrous than humans (-1 on dexterity), but bigger, tougher,
and stronger (+1 to strength and endurance).  Aslan may enlist in any
service. However, Aslan males receive a DM of -4 for enlistment and
re-enlistment in the Merchants and Scouts.  Both males and females receive
DMs of +1 for enlistment, promotion, and re-enlistment in the marines and in
the army.  In close combat, Aslan generally use their natural weapon--the
dewclaw.  Any receipt of Brawling or Blade Combat automatically becomes
Dewclaw (except for Aslan in the Marines who learn how to use the cutlass as
a matter of tradition).  Teh dewclaw should be treated as a dagger in combat.

NOTE:  These are only the basics, based on the original Contact! Articles
re-published in Best of JTAS 2.  There are other rules which really should
be included (e.g. Vargr charisma, Aslan skill restrictions by sex), but I\'m
way too tired now.

4.  I seem to recall that the *timing* of the flash and bang is important,

     certain about, but if true it has implications for use against Traveller

Could anyone post the stats on these stunners?  I\'d be most interested in 
seeing them.  

I still vividly remember my first expsoure to Traveller combat, we were
trying to foil a terrorist plot.  My character shot an escaping terrorist,
(I was attempting to capture the terrorist).  One shot from a pistol
(Striker rules) and that was it, one dead terrorist :(

	From page 8 of the Divine Intervention text:

Stun Carbine:  An experimental weapon that fires a beam of ultrasonic 
vibrations.  When tis bean hits a human, it inflicts 1D-1 points of 
damage and may cause unconciousness.  The victim mus throw below his 
current endurance score on 3 dice to avoid being stunned.  If he fails, 
the number of points by wich he mised the throw times ten is the number 
of minutes he will be stunned. (Subsequent stuns are not cumulative.)
	[same stats as Laser Cabine - 50 shots, power pack rechargeable; 
same range modifiers as a standard carbine, but max. range is 50 meters.  
Will not function in a vacuum.  Targets wearing Vacc Suits, combat armor, 
or Battle Dress areimmune to the weapon\'s effects.  All other armor has 
no effect.]
	Length: 700 mm.  Weight: 3500 grams.  Weight of power pack: 3000 
grams. Base price: Cr3000 (if available).  Extra power packs: Cr1000.

Yes, I do. Or rather, I have a house rule about _decreased_ chance for psi
abilities. I\'ve introduced a throw for psionic potential. That\'s something a
character must have in order to even get a psi strength roll. People with 
potential can have an actual psi rating of 0; but people without potential 
_definitely_ has a rating of 0. The chances of having psi potential are:

Player Characters: Automatic.
NPCs: Roll 2D; if you roll 4- the character has psionic potential.
Modifications:
Home culture has persecuted psionics for millenia: -2
Home culture has persecuted psionics for centuries: -1 (The Imperium)
Home culture has encouraged psionics for centuries: +1
Home culture has encouraged psionics for millenia: +2  (The Zhodani)
One parent has psi potential: +4
Both parents have psi potential: +8  

Note that the psionic strength of the parents in no way affects the roll
for psionic strength.

Note: I\'m pretty sure that a rigorous statistical analysis of these
      figures will demonstrate inconsistencies; please don\'t tell me
      about them.

There was an article in White Dwarf, many years ago (below #50, I think) with
some stun weapons; tasers, LPL (low power lasers), a concussion rifle and a
nifty widget called an Anagun which fires needles - including special drilly
needles for penetrating battle dress. We build them into security robots
(biffos) nowadays.

I would think that sound and light would be quite effective still on their

It would be good is you could calibrate it, but as for Aliens, they\'d still
have get specimens to figure out what the calibrations needed to be.

I like this.  The fact that basically *everyone* has psionic strength is
kind of annoying, especially when you consider the low roll needed to get
some abilities (5+ for telepathy).  

I also agree with not having psionics be a hereditary abilitiy, although I
think an extra column is needed for the DMs.  I think that Zhodani should be
able to forgoe the psionic potential and roll normally for psionic strength.
This is just due to the fact that they encourage and have practiced psionics
for so long.

The answer to those questions were given in MTJ#4:

" What are the tech levels of the Major Races? - J.M.
  Strictly speaking, there is no one tech level for each major race, =
just as there is no one tech level for the Shattered Imperium. Each =
major world per system has its own tech level. But the maximum tech =
level you find for worlds in the Imperium is TL15/16, with the emphasis =
on tech 15, although the tech 16 worlds are getting ever more frequent.
  As for the Solomani, tech level 14/15 is the maximum, with tech 15 =
worlds few and far between.
  The Zhodani are also a maximum tech level of 14/15, but tech 15 worlds =
are more common than in Solomani space.
  The Hiver maximum tech level is 15/16 with the tech level 16 worlds =
appearing more frequently all the time. The Hivers are well on their way =
to becoming the technological leaders of charted space.
  The Aslan are a solid maximum of tech 14, with an occasional tech =
level 15 world thrown in here and there.
  The K\'kree are the most conservative technologically, with a macimum =
of tech level 13, although a few tech level 14 worlds show up on rare =
occasions.
  It\'s anybody\'s guess what the tech level maximum of the Vargr as a =
race is. Since they can\'t even build things of consistent tech level in =
a single device, and they borrow (steal?) more technology than they =
invent, it makes it very difficult to judge. But a maximum of tech level =
13 is not uncommon in the Vargr extents. - Joe D. Fugate Sr."

1) SHouldn\'t it be 4+, not 4- ???
2) Zhodani Proles should take a negative, as they are not selected for psi
potential, as those with Psi of note are rmoved from the pool... I\'d
reccomend a dm-2 for proles, a dm+0 for intendants, and a DM+3 for nobles.

3) I\'d make even PC\'s roll (my current group has nought but psionic
persons... quite a danger).

4) Also, I\'d set it to a n 11+ roll (or maybe a 7+) to correspond to the
MT/T4 task systems difficulties, and if diff was a 7+, use +2/+4 for
one/both parents having had TRAINING prior to your birth, as they could
encourage and nurture certain small traits once they detected them... but
that\'s a personal thing.

SF tradition is part of it, but there\'s a practical justification -- when 
your society is spread out over long distances, time-wise, local 
governments have to have a lot of autonomy.  A feudal system, where the 
local rulers can act as they see fit on most issues, is likely to be one 
of the more effective ways to govern, when orders from the capital take 
months, or years, to arrive.  Democracies require good internal 
communications.

	Because they call it Space Opera..that\'s why.  The reason you see it 
so much in SF is that it\'s an easy cop-out way of having a 
pre-concieved governmental structure that all readers have some idea 
of it\'s structure...this is the same &@#%@$ reason Trav has 
cutlasses...sigh.

	The Rule of Man was called the Ramshackle Empire for good reason 
 Its government derived from the Solomani military takeover of 
Vilani government.  It was a sort of  autocratic sort of feudal sort of 
bureaucracy that, mainly, left things to local administrators to keep 
things running.  Therefore, I suspect the gamut ran from sheer 
anarchy to utter autocracy, and everything in between, depending on 
the resourcefulness and/or ambition of the local commander. 

	This, among other things, was what led to the Long Night; this lack 
of centralized authority, or more precisely, lack of centralized 
SOURCE of authority.  No government with communication lag times 
restricted by Jump 2 travel times can operate with any sort of 
centralized authority...the officials on scene have to pretty much 
run everything themselves. What makes the difference between this 
turning into a lot of independent states and a single empire is 
everyone\'s belief in the Emperor\'s clothes, and the strength and 
loyalty of his navy.

John (and anyone else who is interested), your best bet is you local library.  
Janes Defense Weekly has had several good articles in the past two years.  I\'ve 
gotten most of my limited knowledge from a Newsgroup on GEnie, but that 
newsgroup (like far too much of GEnie) has been basically dead for the past 6

that there are probably not much in the way of books yet, but there may be a

However, from the various ship designs and such which have been published,
I think TL 15 equipment and ships are rather common.  I\'ve always assumed
that it is possible to buy small, easily shipped TL 15 tech at almost any
Class A starport in the Imperium.  Of course, if the Starport is on a TL 9
planet, located in someplace isolated like Reaver\'s Deep, then I would
expect the equipment to be priced as much as 100-150% higher than normal. 

It does seem that the Imperial Navy and Scout service almost 
exclusively use High Stellar ships and equipment.

The *average* TL in the Imperium is around C or D (12-13), but the nominal
maximum is F (15).  Worlds of nonhuman races also vary, but I believe the
highest TL for the Aslan is D(13).  For the K\'Kree and Zhodani, I believe
it\'s E(14), and Hivers have achieved TL G (16) in many fields, especially
computers and robotics.

At the risk of being an utter geek, here\'s Marc Miller\'s justification for
blade weapons from _Best of JTAS_ I:

"For completenesss, Traveller is forced to include a wide variety of weapons
such as swords, knives, spears, and other "prinitive" weapons.  Dealing with
primitive cultures, players could find themselves involved in a fight with a
group armed with such weapons, and the rules must cover the use of edged
weapons, spears, and such.

"Another major consideration is law level.  American technology produced
nukes, artillery, napalm, machineguns, and dozens of other lethal devices,
but the law level makes moost of these unavailable and places obstacles in
the way of the purchase of the rest.  Anyone, however, gcan get a knife or a
tire chain or a louisville slugger.  A significant number of killings every
year are accomplished with weapons that a caveman would have no trouble with.

"As far as the military goes, tradition and esprit de corops can be used to
justify the inclusion of some blade training.  Perhaps arbitrarily, marines
in Traveller receive training in the cutlass as a service skill; it\'s
justified as a morale building effort, like bayonet training in the US Army
(I received bayonet training, hell, I _gave_ bayonet training, and th army
hasn\'t uised bayonets in any real action since 1918).  Officers in armies
all over the world were taught fencing long after it ceased to have any
military significance.  Over and above all this, some training is still
given in the use of the knife because it is one of the more efficient ways
to kill silently, always of use to commandos and the like.

"Finally, both players and referees sohould keep in mind that old fashioned
weapons are not really designed with the idea that characters will depend on
them for their lives.  Guns, even without skill, are more efficient in most
situations and can be used to great effect.  Blade skill is a background
skill, and should be put to good use only where it is needed."

Thanks. My reason for introducing this was that I found it difficult to
accept that it had been possible to whip up antipathy against a psionic
minority when there was no psionic minority. I mean, if more than half
the population is able to get some sort of useful psi ability, where\'s
the minority?

Psionic potential is a hereditary characteristic. With +8 for both parents
having psi potential, an individual in an ordinary (neither pro- nor anti-
psionic) will automatically have potential himself. 


William F. Hostman:
> 1) SHouldn\'t it be 4+, not 4- ???

No, you roll 2D if you roll a 2, 3 or 4, you have psi potential. If your
culture has favoured psi for millenia you have potential on 6- and so
forth.

Yes, very true. I hadn\'t considered that, not having had to use this roll
for any Zhodani in my campaign.

It\'s your PCs. If you don\'t want them to have psi powers, who\'s to say you
nay?

Well, I don\'t feel it necessary to fit everything into one mold. The
Traveller task rules are a great idea, but the implementation leaves much
to be desired.I think the graduation is much too big. Jumps of 4 with 2 D6
are far too much. I\'ve experimented both with using 3 dice and jumps of 2,
neither of which were quite ideal, but both of which worked better than
the official rules (Nowadays I mostly use my own rule system and just use 
the Traveller background).

Yes, but what about at the subsector or planetery level.  Surely the
communications is good enough there to provide for democratic rule.

  I just acquired a copy of the May 1996 Computer Shopper (Metro NY
  Edition) and saw an article in the Tech Section about holographic
  data storage (Title: Light Waves Ahead; p562).

  The article says that Stanford University\'s Center for Nonlinear
  Optical Materials has "a 100 percent working holographic storage
  prototype."  The article then claims that the technology is
  viable enough to be on the market within five years.

  In June 1994, when the first tests of the technology were run,
  the Stanford system successfully encoded, stored, and retrieved a
  JPEG image of the Mona Lisa (originally stored on a conventional
  hard disk), and passed the tests with flying colors.  It is
  claimed that technological improvements have been made, and that
  this year, an MPEG sequence successfully passed the tests.

  The 2cm x 2cm x 1cm holocrystal is made out of Lithium Niobate,
  and the read-write mechanism is based on a blue-green Argon
  laser.  Work is in progress to try to achieve a system which will
  operate using a common red semiconductor laser - much cheaper and
  more available.

  The article then goes into the technical details of how the
  system works - a fascinating read, but too long and complex to
  summarize here - go get a copy of Computer Shopper and read it
  yourself.  Near the end, the claim is made that a consumer
  product (remember, we\'re talking less than five years) will
  exhibit a transfer rate of 1Gbps - yes, that\'s one gigabit per
  second - not too shabby!

  FWIW, the Megatraveller Referee\'s Companion puts holocrystal
  storage at TL13.

A Note on Magazines:  While additional issues of many listed magazines 
(i.e., Travellers\' Digest, JTAS (as Challenge), etc.) were produced, 
they are not included here because those issues contained material related
to games other than Classic Traveller, even though they did contain some 
material usable in the Classic Traveller system.  This is also the reason 
certain issues of Space Gamer, Dragon Magazine, and others are not listed.

Feudal systems collapse when they try to administer an economy that is even a 
little more advanced than subsistence agriculture, because the middle class 
gains wealth and power from middle class activities, while property owners 
(aristocracy) become relatively less wealthy and influential. In order to keep 
their lifestyle and power, the aristocracy have to borrow, marry, or steal 
middle class cash. Eventually the middle class (or military) get sick of upper 
class parasites and demand \'democratic\' rule - that is, democracy so long as the
unwashed masses stay under control. 

Modern industrial democracy predates modern instantaneous communications. In an 
advanced republican system (the USA, for example) there is no NEED for lower 
levels of government to continually suck up to the federal government - that has
only started happening since the 1930s increase in federal power. The USA 
functioned quite well (indeed, some would say even better) when it took a few 
days or weeks for directions from Washington to arrive at the local/State 
government level. Washington didn\'t bother sending out instructions unless it 
was important, which was the way the state governors liked it. 

The only place in the modern world where feudalism has survived beyond a 
subsistence economy is in the Middle East, where the aristocracy managed to get 
their hands on the sole source of wealth - oil. When that oil runs out (or 
competing energy sources make oil worthless), the aristocracy are in the same 
leaky boat. 

Modern republican democracies have proven the most stable means of governing 
modern industrial economies. If the Third Imperium is really a feudal system 
ruling an advanced technological society, there must be a better reason for it 
than \'efficiency of government\'. I guess I\'m looking for a conspiracy theory

I always had a vague idea that marines were trained in blades as ideal
weapons for close-in shipboard combat which (unlike most projectile, laser,
etc. weapons) would not unduly damage any of the ship\'s fragile components.
Certainly if my players start firing large guns on board a ship, they soon
find that some of the systems aren\'t working as well as before, if at all,
due to the large number of bullets which have cut through walls and damaged
wiring, pipes, etc.

Plus, I would consider the term "cutlass" not to be the long curved sword of
Errol Flynn sea-faring films, but a vague historical reflection of the
blade\'s history; the actual weapon used by the marines would be more like an
over-sized commando dagger, honed for cutting or stabbing through vacc\'
suits, etc.

for harder stuff, with moderate stuff having the biggest gains, until a
certain point is hit, where the returns drop off.

[rant mode on]
My problem with the MT Task system is the LOW value of attributes in
relation to skill [5:1] and the relatively narrow non-crit-___  margin
[+2<->(-2)]; I would much prefer CS being 3 over and CF being 3 under, with
attributes being used at att/4 [4:1].

This also seems to be the critical break-point for attribute levels for
certain titles, like surgeon. (Many careers use it also, both basic and
advanced).


TNE, however, uses a 1:1 skill level/attribute level, and a given level of
skill or attribute is a simple (+20/+10/+5/+2.5/+1.25) at the five levels
of difficulty, and allows a character who meets the minimums of 1 level of
skill + 3 levels of attribute to have a 5% chance of success at the
Impossible task, something which only an expert (level 4+ minimum, with a
15 in the relavant attribute for a base +3 from attribute; total +7) could
do at all, and a maximum chance at it of 1/12 (less than 9%) assuming
hiting the DM limit of +8. Assuming Specialist Level 8, and a 10 in the
controlling attribute, that\'s a 4- on a d20, or 10%. FOr an Att14, skill 10
(the common max skill level allowed by all TNE GM\'s I\'ve talked TNE with in
alaska), that goes to a 6-, or 30% on an IMPOSSIBLE task; which the
coversions assure me will either be skill 5 -7 equivalent, and +3 (for a
15, because TNE atts are 1 point lower) from attribute, hitting the +8 DM
Limit, and maxing out at 8.something%!

Keep that in mind when trying to come up with a "universal descriptor
system"; after all, TNE uses the same difficulties (with one name change),
and most of the published tasks (except for combat tasks) had unchanged
difficulty levels in the conversion.

No, they haven\'t been disproven, which is different.  The so called
"Communist" governments functioned for decades, and until they fell,
there was no "proof" that they didn\'t work.  When they did collapse,
the apparent corruption and disregard for the people in the system was
as much to blame as the (mis)appropriated tennants.  Before all you
right wingers flame me, I\'d agree that Marx was wrong on many counts,
for example I believe he predicted that the more liberal governments
of western Europe would fall to people\'s revolutions before the more
oppresive ones in eastern Europe.  I\'m just pointing out that there is
no evidence that Modern republican (I live in a non-republican Kingdom
BTW) [capitalist] democracies are the most stable forms of government.
Most nations in history have been governed in other ways.  I believe
that the two oldest democratic republics (France & USA?) have only
been around for 250 years or so (I may well be wrong there, history
not being my strong point).

Sorry to rant so, but when the eastern European governments fell, I
had to listen to my country\'s idiot Prime Minister claim the "death of
socialism" and the "triumph of capitalism" on the eve of a series of
crises which could easily have lead to WW III (and still could)!

Well, yes, but what about Isaac Asimov and Poul Anderson, to name but
two.

A monarchical empire is only one of the possible forms of large scale
interstellar government postulated in Traveller.  The Zhodani have the
democratic consuls, the Solomani have the representation of
nation-states, the First Imperium was run by coalitions of powerful
oligarchs, the Second Imperium by essentially a military junta.  The
Third Imperium claims its form of government is superior, and colours
history to suggest a) its predecessors were more like it than they
truely were and b) their Human competitors are either less successful
(the Solomani) or use distasteful methods (the Zhodani).  Of course,
successful alternate alien forms of government don\'t count, because
they are aliens!

Another reason for a feudal system is that it allows local nobles to
be at odds, adding a political dimension to the adventure background.
This differs from democratically elected politicians in that the
nobility all have a right to rule under law, and if they have
different and conflicting ways to go about it, they just have to cope.
This still happens in democracies, I know, but it is more acute in the
Imperial form of government.  

Feudal systems *have* collapsed in the past in the face of change -
who is to say that democratic systems will survive change of a similar
magnitude?  Before you start extolling the virtues of Republican
Government, look around at the many different examples.  Isn\'t Italy a
republic?  Social concerns are as important as political mechanisms.
If part of Bosnia secedes from Yugoslavia, the result is Civil War; if
part of Minnesota secedes from the USA, the result is legal
proceedings and police actions.

Enough, back to work

	Oh?  It\'s not in the Zhodani - in fact psis in the Zho appear
completely at random and this is part of the background.  As far as I

reduce your +8 if both parents have psi potential to something much

\'Special\' tech:
	In my Traveller universe, certain areas of the Imperium have
\'special\' technologies.  It makes travelling across the galaxy much
more interesting, even though the divisions of technology might seem
completely artificial at first - and in fact they are.  There\'s no
real reason why one world couldn\'t manufacture the same tech as
another planet, provided they install the correct manufacturing
equipment.  THe reasons why those technologies are localized is
because of protectionism, Imperial patent laws and planetary
specializations.  The Imperium might encourage some worlds to keep
their technologies to themselves so that trade benefits.   if
everybody could manufacture anything, then there would be no trade.
So that\'s why some worlds specialize in their production, etc. 
Anyways, my question is, do you use the same idea in your universe?
And what technolgies are so special?  Here is an incomplete list that
I use:
The Darrians:  Star-trigger, advanced gravitics and stealth-jump
drives (drives without the brilliant flare), failproof systems.
Antares: Transparent metals; various metals varying in transparence
to many kinds of light frequency.   The Antares scout ship with fully
transparent underside is a very recent commercial hit.
Ziru Sirkaa: Automated jump drones (torpedoes, courriers, etc)  Their
network does not extend outside of the Ziru Sirkaa.
Solomani: Sandblaster HePLaR drives;  maneuver drives that use
high-power lasers to pulverize sand for propulsion.  The drives have
an alternative setting to use external air in any athmosphere.  
Zhodani: various psi devices.
Droyne:  Well, they could probably build anything, if you could
convince them to. :)
The Ancients; Dehydrated Water, of course.
etc.

	Any suggestions? :)

Absolutely, at least of the federal, or representative types.  (This will 
obviously depend on tech level to some extent; a planetary 
direct-participation democracy might be feasible with a small enough 
population or high enough tech.)  Remember, though, that Traveller does 
provide for the possibility of democratic rule at the planetary level.  
It doesn\'t, however, take into account the possibility that a huge, 
high-tech planet full of people who live under a democracy might demand 
representative government on a wider scale.  Seems like a pretty normal 
course of action to me, but then I wasn\'t raised as an Imperial citizen...
and I guess that\'s what the Imperial Navy\'s for.

A point to remember.  :)  Consider the situation back in the 1850s when 
California was a US state on the west coast -- before the Pony Express,
when Missouri was on the western frontier.  Ships had to round South America
to get there from the US east coast, overland travel being slow, difficult, 
and hazardous....

In Traveller, it\'s due to cultural reasons.  The aristocratic influences are
all Vilani in origin, filtered through the Terran reforms of the Rule of Man
period.  Basically, the all the Rule of Man did was take over the tottering
Ziru Sirka and try to shore up the Vilani caste-system and bureaucracy.  The
Vilani were around when the Imperium was founded -- the Terrans weren\'t. 

What we know of the Third Imperium seems to indicate that the Imperial form
of government is a cross between the old Vilani castes and a strengthened
version of the UN (the Terran Confederation).  Cast the Moot as the General
Assembly, the Emperor as a cross between the Secretary-General and Security
Council, with his Office of the Emperor as the Secretariat....

Of course, this is an extreme oversimplification.  The Imperium has a
military, the ministries, and a somewhat different mission.  But despite
Imperial propaganda, a democracy can work.  It\'s enlightening to note that
the other two human empires, the Solomani Confederation and Zhodani Consulate
manage to operate governments that can make the claim to be democratic.  
The Zhodani have a limited electorate.  The Solomani appear to go through
the motions of being democratic, even if one thinks that their elections
are rigged or one-sided.  So it seems possible that an interstellar 
democracy of all the people could work in Traveller.

I always looked at Traveller as more of a pseudo-feudalistic society.
Similar to pre-instant communication US in that the local areas (sytstems &
planets) are administered democratically (or however the UWP says) while the
overall wide government structure was a feudalistic republic.  The Moot had
to confirm the Emperor (similar to the Electorial College voting for
President).  The interstellar government takes care of the overall
government functions.  In the US these functions were state vs state
disputes, postal system, issues regarding relations with other nations, and
border defense.  In the Imperium these functions would be world vs world (or
system vs system) disputes, xboat system, relations with the Solomani,
Hiver, Zhodani, etc., and border defense.

I know the analogy isn\'t perfect, but it is close.  I believe one of the
only reasons the Imperium is considered a Feudalistic society rather than a
Republic is because the emphasis is on the local representative of the
interstellar government (the local nobility) rather than the interstellar
representative of the local government (the nobility of the Moot).

Of course, this is part of my interpretation of the Traveller nobility (an
issue which has received some coverage here).  I always thought that there
were two main types of nobles.

The first was the Noble appointed(?) to the Moot.  This was a local person
of prominent standing.  Depending on the government structure of this
individuals homeworld (sector, subsector, whatever) this person was
appointed or elected to this position.  This person\'s responsibility in the
Moot was to be the voice of the system (sector, subsector, whatever) in
advising the Emperor on policy and the vote of conformation of that system
(sector, subsector, whatever) when a new emperor was confirmed.

The other type of Noble was appointed by the Emperor.  This person was the
Emperor\'s liaison at the planerary (sector, subsector, whaterver) level.  Of
course the Emperor didn\'t appoint every single one of these individuals, but
only some of them.  The Emperor would typically appoint Archdukes (Domains)
and important Senior Dukes (Sectors) and occasionally Lesser Dukes
(Subsectors) and rarely anyone else.  The lower Nobles (Counts, Barons,
etc.) were appointed by the Archdukes, Senior Dukes, and occasionally Lesser
Dukes.  These nobles answered to the Emperor and did his bidding at the
local level.

Food for thought.

  Damn right! You can look at it two ways: Either the normal
projectiles are of higher penetration than the walls and would,
thus, endanger the integrity of your vessel by firing them, or
they are of lower penetration than the walls and would, thus
endanger the integrity of your troops by ricocheting about the
place.
  Either way guns and space ships do not mix. (Any Military
Submarine types have any comments about weapons policy on
underwater vessels?) Swords are your only man.

  Primarily space troops will have these as secondary weapons
for on-ship fighting. Primarily surface troops which occasionally
get called into space fix bayonets or equivalent (one race
uses axe-heads on the barrels of their weapons).
  In my campaign your have your normal blade weapons. There are
exceptional quality weapons which may have a slightly higher
penetration. Beyond that you have enhanced blades, vibro-swords,
high-tech (mono-molecular?) edges, etc, etc. These do twice the
listed penetration and damage of normal weapons. Beyond that again
you have "ancient" artifacts resembling hand-held weapons made
of glowing plasma (light-sabres, etc) that do three times the
listed penetration and damage.
  When you get to the high levels you have to watch where you
swing the things. They can still cut through computer consoles
and so forth.

  Swords should certainly be a part of dress uniforms in the
Star Navies. Often they are made of exotic substances, eg.
Crystaliron or Ironwood. Some of my players bought one of these
heirloom type swords and finds it generally impressive.
  Another PC picked up a very odd sword. It was actually a
genetically created mineral based quasi-life form. It had
dim thermal awareness and could "smell" living blood. It could
not move on its own but while being swung it could shift liquid
around in internal channels to direct and guide the blade
more accurately towards whatever it smelled. After suitable
penetration puts it in contact with its source it adsorbs
the blood through its hard outer shell creating a small amount
of suction that sometimes makes it hard to dislodge from a
body. When it has "fed" sufficiently its internal channels
fill up making it more sluggish and unwieldy.
  It has also been known to moan on occasion.

You are focusing in fuedalism as an economic system.  It is, in fact,
true that Traveller technically isn\'t a feudal system (it\'s a heriditary
oligarchy).  Semantics aside, such a form of goverment is what has
been historically applied to empires with the kind of communications
lags that the Imperium suffers.

The key here is that you don\'t need _instantaneous_ communications, but
you do need timely comunications.  There are no democracies where
the round tip communications time from the center to the edge is
on the order of two years.

Actualy, if you want to be accurate, feudalism hasn\'t survived beyond
a subsitence economy.  Monarchies and heriditary oligarchies have.

I\'ve always explained the coexistence of Liberal forms of government at the
local level and feudalism at the interstellar by imagining the Imperium as
a customs union with a navy. The Imperium has no direct jurisdiction over
most planets; it merely provides a set of rules for trade, defense against
outside threats, and a common currency. In exchange, it imposes relatively
light taxes on interstellar trade and other transactions contracted under
Imperial commercial law. The Imperial government, while it certainly
presents itself as a unitary government, is not recognizable as a state by
our 20th century standards. It simply does not impose enough burdens on
individual planets to induce them to push for greater autonomy; they
already have all the autonomy they want.

[   Damn right! You can look at it two ways: Either the normal
[ projectiles are of higher penetration than the walls and would,
[ thus, endanger the integrity of your vessel by firing them, or
[ they are of lower penetration than the walls and would, thus
[ endanger the integrity of your troops by ricocheting about the
[ place.
[   Either way guns and space ships do not mix. (Any Military
[ Submarine types have any comments about weapons policy on
[ underwater vessels?) Swords are your only man.

The US Marines maintain security on board its submarines (and all other
US warships, for that matter) using automatic shotguns which are called,
in the jargon, "CAW\'s" (Combat Assault Weapons.) When a security breach
alarm is sounded, all personel (except for the security guards of
course) onboard the ship must hit the deck, security squads of marines
patrolling the ship then immediately gun down anyone they see standing.
This means that the perp will either be dead from standing up, or easily
caught while crawling on the deck.

Of course, the crew lying on the floor get sprayed with buckshot
recoiling from the bulkheads, but the buckshot used in the CAW\'s loses
kinetic energy fairly rapidly, giving it a very short range, (not a
problem on a ship) and  insuring that the ricochet projectiles are not
deadly. (But keep your eyes shut!) The buckshot does not penetrate the
the bulkheads; it merely loses its kinetic energy during the recoil
to deformation, heat, and noise.

I\'m not a military submarine type, by the way; what I\'m telling
you is hearsay.

IMHO, swords will remain important for ritual use, and for combat
on high law-level worlds, but not for miliary action.

The Japanese in WWII used their swords to execute prisoners and maintain
discipline. I always assumed that Imperial Marines used their swords for
the same purpose.

Characters are basically not really convertable, but a rough approximation
is 2 TNE levels equals 1 MT level; the task systems give WILDLY different
chances, but the published tasks (except combat) remain the same.

On the combat side, MT is simpler, and far more deadly. TNE PC\'s can
generally take 2-5 times the damage of an npc, and are not laid up for more
than two weeks if they live (barring infection).

Ship Design (from FF&S) is much like MT; many of the tables crossed over
directly. FF&S mas more goodies. I\'m working on converting them. Will post
a list of what changes, and what works OK as is later.

Advancement & Experience: Mt is slow, steady, and has an upper limit; TNE
is rapid, potent, and has no upper limit. (A 20 year navy man started a
campaign with 41 TNE levels, 2 character years later [4 months of good hard
play, 3-5xp per week of play] same character had 101 levels). Attributes
have no improvement rules in TNE other than in CG, but can be figured; MT
has improvement rules for everything EXCEPT morale.

Summary: MT is Hard SciFi with a few problems...
         TNE is PURE SpaceOpera, which just happens to have Good Tech Stuff.

Hope this helps ( and isn\'t too anti-TNE Biased)

the 9 signify the average of all planets?  Also, what are the TLs of

Originally, the absolute max TL of the Imperium was stated as 15. Very
few worlds are at this dizzy height, and most tend to be in the 8-12
band. There were some published lists of stats over the whole Imperium
from DGP which gave averages but I can\'t remember where to look for
them. However, as time went on, designers and writers couldn\'t resist
the temptation to play with better tech, and so we now have a
scattering of TL 16 worlds and one at 17 (sorta).
Pre-Rebellion/collapse of course. 

The Aslan, Zhodani, Vargr and K\'kree had a maximum of 14; again this
has crept up to 15 over time. The Hivers reached 15 with a 16 for
computers and mathematics. The Droyne could only make 12. The Solomani
(as part of the Imperium) have access to 15, with (debatably) 16 in

The holocrystal device Jeff mentions strikes me as being the size I
imagined Imperial holocrystals as.  I don\'t know what the storage of the
Stanford crystal is, ut the TL 13 version would have to have sufficient
storage capacity to hold at least an hour of color real-time holographic
video (since they\'re used in holorecorders as well as computers).  I
have no idea what the scale-up factor from video to holo would be, but
since a 1 MB MPEG file runs for about 15 seconds with barely acceptable
video quality, you could be talking about many, many GB!  You also need
to get the read/write apparatus into a package which would fit in a
curent laptop computer (both in volume and power consumption) at the
worst.

Since psi potential (as opposed to psi strength) is a characteristic I
introduced in _my_ campaign with a _house_ rule, I should think I would
be able to define it any way I damn well please. As for the randomness,
I kept that; a character has to have psi potential in order to have any
psi strength, but the psi _strength_ is not linked to the parents\' psi
strength in any way.

The difference is that in my campaign you don\'t have 70% or more of the
population potentially able to develop some useful level of psi ability, 
but only 2% or so.

Well, now we are entering the domain of house rules, but I\'ll tell you =
how _I_ do it. The same problem has always annoyed me too, because, =
according to _my_definition, the mainworld of the system is the world =
with the highest population digit. As far as I can tell, that\'s where =
I\'m deviating from canon, because originally, I think the mainworld was =
just meant to the most \'important\' world of the system. Granted, it =
could make for some necessarily creative explanations, why this pop 1 =
planet is the mainworld compared to this pop 8 planet in the same =
system. What I don\'t like about this is that UWPs become very =
misleading. Say the player characters wishes to find a deserted system =
to hide something in. They look at the UWPs, decide on a world with pop =
0 and make the jump. Upon arrival, they find several heavily populated =
worlds with lots of in-system traffic! I don\'t like that, so what do I =
do?

It\'s actually very simple: I\'ve made the (arbitrary) rule that the =
population digit for secondary worlds is determined normally, with the =
exception that there is a ceiling of the mainworld\'s population digit =
minus two. Thus, a system with a mainworld pop digit of 5 will only have =
secondary worlds with pop digits of 3 and less. A mainworld with a pop =
digit of 2 or less will be the only inhabited world in the system. It\'s =
crude, but it works for me.

Cutlass training had been discontinued when I joined the Royal Navy in the 
late 1970\'s, although my Father can remember it in the 1950\'s when he 
joined.

However, I was taught that the last boarding action in which cutlasses were 
used took place during WWII when the Royal Navy put a party armed only with 
cutlasses on to a German ship to overwhelm the garrison and free the 
prisoners being held on the ship. The action was completely successful - the 
garrison (including machine gun points) was overwhelmed silently and the 
prisoners were freed before the Germans were aware that anything was wrong.

[Typical RN - if something can be done with out of date equipment, they\'ll 
do it!  :-) ].

Would you (or any other Brits or military types) happen to know if the

There are two potential solutions to this:

1) CT gives some basic prices of food, lodging, etc.  I quote the following
for "fair use" only, and besides, it\'s only about 10% of the book\'s text, so
it should be cool anyway:
        "*Basic Cuisine on a Daily Basis:*  Food is available in a variety
of forms and qualitites.  Prices indicated are per person.
        Restaurant meals of ordinary quality cost  CR 10 per day.
Excellent quality meals range in price form CR 20 to CR 50 per person.
Travellers\' Aid Society facilies provide excellent quality meals to members
and guests for CR 20.
        Food purchased from vendors for preparation at home costs about CR 5
per day, and weighs about 1 kg.
        Preserved foods for rations on expeditions may be canned or packaged
(CR 20 per day, weighs .5 kg) or dehydrated (CR 25 per day, weighs .2 kg,
dependent on locally supplied water).
        "*Subsistence on a Long Term Basis:*  In situations where time
passes quickly, personal survival or subsistence costs can be assumed to be
the values given below:
        Starvation Level--bare minimum of food, CR 60 per month.  Dismal
lodging, CR 60 per month.
        Subsistence Level--reasonable food, CR 120 per month.  Acceptable
lodging, CR 180 per month.
        Ordinary Level--good food, CR 200 per month.  Good lodging, CR 200
per month.
        High Living--Excellent food CR 600 per month.  Excellent
accomodations, CR 300 per month."
                                           Book 3, _Worlds and Adventures_, p.15

2)In MegaTraveller, cr250x[Social Standing] is the amount of money that a
characters should be spending on themselves for food, lodging, and other
incidentals.  Assuming that at Soc 2, an individual is just scraping by,
this can be over-simplified to cr250 a month for food and cr250 a month for
lodging, so the very worst food and lodging you can find will run you about
cr10 per day.  Prices at other Social Standing equivelants is left as an
exercise for the reader :) (NOTE:  At higher levels, MegaTraveller becomes a
lot more expensive than CT, but then you can also assume that part of the
costs are new dresses, manicures, weekends in the country, etc.)

 No, it didn\'t.  But I\'ve had some discussions with some people who
 are somewhat better informed, both in terms of the experiment and
 the theoretical physics behind it, and the low end that I\'ve
 heard suggested is that it will come to market in gigabyte
 quantities.  But that will be kind of like the original 160K IBM
 floppies - or maybe the Apple 143K jobs.  They expect it to
 increase really fast.

Off course you still have the problem with ricochetting bullets, but =
sometimes you may even want that - imagine firing burst fire at the wall =
behind an enemy under cover. If he\'s down a corridor or something (a =
rather reasonable situation in shipboard combat) you can do this =

And if you don\'t want ricochets, you can just fire lasers or other =
energy weapons - they don\'t ricochet.

Off course you still run the risk of damaging valuable equipment =

Well, I\'m certainly not going to tell them they can\'t! There\'s a Ghurka
engineering squadron based a couple of miles away, and they may all be little
guys (probably about 5\'6" average) but they look tough as hell when you pass
them in town (and smart with it, blazers and smart pants as a rule). As for the
Khukri being ugly, it\'s probably a matter of perspective. It\'s still part of
their official equipment and if they\'ve got them they\'ll use them (I believe
they used them in the Falklands).

    'body' => 'Okay folks. It\'s dumb-question time. Not meaning to pick nits,
but I\'ve recently stumbled across a few oddities regarding some
of the traveller sectors, and maybe somebody out there in netland
can be of assistance.

#1: Is it the Massilia Sector or the Massila Sector? DGP seems
to spell it one way, GDW another. Since DGP seems to have done
most of the work in describing the sector (trav digest 11), I\'m
inclined to go with them, but then again, the GDW-spelling is
probably more official, right?

#2: Allegiance Codes:
    Ma = Maggie\'s Imperium?
    Cv = ???  (appears in Lishun Sector data)
    V1 = Vargr?  (what flavor?)   (lishun)
    V8 = Vargr?  (what flavor?)   (lishun)
    Vv = Vargr?  (what flavor?)   (lishun)
    Vx = Vargr?  (what flavor?)   (lishun)
    V7 = Vargr?  (what flavor?)   (vland)
    Vn = Vargr?  (what flavor?)   (vland)

#3: Base Codes:
    Hinterworlds:  F, J, M   (what do these mean?)
    hint: hinterworlds were covered in challenge #39.
    am i just overlooking something fairly obvious?

#4: This one\'s actually sort of funny. In the Old Expanses,
    there\'s a subsector called the "21 worlds" (covered in
    issue 12 of the trav digest). Sure enough, there are
    21 star systems there (they don\'t give any stats other
    than locations). In the updated DGP data which is online
    at Sunbane (i.e. Nova), however, only 20 of these worlds
    are shown. Please tell me that Lucan didn\'t go blow one
    of them up, or something. That would be just perfect.
    "I wonder what they\'d do if there were only 20 worlds?
    Admiral, set course for the 21 worlds subsector" :-)

#5: One last one. Who exactly came up with the sector data,
    or was the chore spread around a bunch of different folks?
    I see in some of the trav digests that James Holden,
    Nancy Parker, Robert Parker, Philip Athans, Mike Mikesh,
    David Ridell, Mike Jackson, Clay Bush, John Meyers,
    Aleatha Parker, Dale Kemper, John Theisen, J. Andrew Keith,
    and (pant... pant...) a veritable swarm of multitudes were
    credited for several library data articles covering the
    various sectors, and some of these articles have maps
    while others go so far as to give UWP data for each and
    every world. Did these people actually create this data, or
    was it simply handed to them by somebody else for them to
    expound upon?

far too much of the overblown space operas of the 30s and 40s.  There are 
other, more interesting (to me) answers.  Snub pistols were mentioned as 
being designed for this purpose.  Their recoil is low and the 
penetration for all shell types except HEAP is 1.  They basically can\'t 
accidentally harm anything in the ship.  In addition, sonic stunners (if 
used), gas rounds, and for the very high tech, neural weapons all all 
good choices for non-military shipboard combat.  

For military battles things become a bit different:

Laser pistols (TL: 9) and Gauss pistols both only have penetrations of 4. 
This is enough to penetrate all standard vacc suits, but if every major
piece of equipment on a military starship had armor of at least 8 they
would be useful weapons.  However, if the military is fighting other
military it is likely that everyone is wearing at least Combat Armor TL-12
(armor value 10).  No hand weapons except Axes and Harlberds (not very
convenient to wield in a starship corridor) can do anything against this
type of armor.  In addition, most slug throwers and lasers have trouble
handling this type of armor. 

The weapons that can penetrate such armor and do significant damage are 
also a danger to the starship.  The problem is much worse when dealing 
with TL 14 armor (AV: 18).  To achieve a high penetration shot on that 
kind of armor you risk using a weapon that can shoot through the hull, 
and destroying the ship they are trying to capture.

I\'m not sure of how to get around this problem, other than to say that
mostly military forces just blow up starships at a distance rather than 
attempting to board.

Well Sorry to inform you but marines do not provide security on US
submarines. Aircraft carriers and large surface combatant ships are the only
one that have Marine units on board. On other US ships the sailors provide
the security for the ship typically the personnel are drawn from the weapons
handling/firing divisions on board the ship. Also as to gunning down anyone
who does not get prone!, get a better source of info please!!! The only
instance of gunning down might occur if the person encroached the zone of
the "Ready Aircraft". The discharge of weapon onboard a US Naval ship is a
very serious matter. If you do it you had better have perfect reason for
same. Contrary to what you might have heard the persons issued weapons have
guidelines in which they can use "Deadly Force", and they also have to have
good judgement. I personally have had the chance to discharge my weapon into
two officers that broke the rules but did not, I have no regrets either, the
officers made a simple mistake. The shipboard security personnel are not
grid locked into rules/orders unlike what you might have heard.

Well on the ships that I was stationed on the issued weapons were colt .45,
Ithaca pump riot twelve gauges, and M-14\'s. As to firing in the corridors
well there is a lot a electrical wiring routed thru the walls that protrude
out into the corridor.

  Last time the Carrier JFK was in Boston, Ed Barach & I spent hours in the
hot sun waiting to get on board.  It was worth it.
  One of the displays was the weapons used by the Shipboard Security Marines.
M-16 w/ M-203
M-92 9mm pistol,
M-60 GMP
12 gauge pump shotgun.

  When asked about the shotgun, the Marine on duty spoke of it fondly. :-)
They loaded Double-0 buckshot.  A couple of shots would fill a shipboard
corridor with a dozen .30 caliber rounds bouncing off the metal floor,
ceiling, and walls.
  Good shipboard weapon.  Fills the corridor, doesn\'t penetrate, good 
stopping power.
  Jump forward a millennium or so...The ship is a starship, the boarders
are wearing combat armor at least as tough as the ship\'s bulkheads.  Any
weapon that can breech the armor, can damage the ship.
  Have the shot gun fire \'tanglers\', perhaps even designed to gum up the
target\'s comm gear and sensors.  Then advance with that Space Ax!

 :)

The Gurkhas are still issued Kukris as part of their official equipment, 
although I\'m not aware of the last time they were used in battle. The 
Gurkhas were scheduled to go into the line in the battles around Stanley, 
but the Argies surrendered before the Gurkhas could be used. They did, 
however, apparently fight a number of minor skirmishes when they were 
clearing Lafonia (the big uninhabited bit on the bottom of East Falkland), 
although they record that the Argies surrendered before the Gurhkas got in 
close (no surprise - I would too!).

The Gurkhas have a rule (possibly a superstition, although I don\'t know that 
for sure) that a Kukri must draw blood every time it is drawn. For this 
reason, Gurhkas cut their own thumbs every time they draw their Kukri.

Finally, yes the Gurkhas are reputed to eat prisoners. After 2 Para took 
Goose Green, Brigade moved the Gurkhas up to Goose Green to guard the Argie 
prisoners there while 2 Para moved forward for the final assault. When the 
Paras handed over to the Gurkhas, they told them to smile at any POW who 
gave them any trouble (they had told the Argies that if a Gurkha smiles at 
you, he\'s planning to eat you!). I have seen a Gurkha\'s smile - and it\'s one 
of the most blood-curdling things I have ever seen.

Apologies if anyone\'s offended by this conversation going off at a tangent.

  Guns, guns, and more guns? Yawn.

  Wrong comment. I fight with a halberd in the SCA (Medieval Re-creation).
I\'m willing to bet that the armour I wear is, if anything, more bulky
than a vacc-suit or combat armour and that the bridge battles that I\'ve
fought in are a good approximation to ship corridors.
  While touring Cahir castle it struck me that my weapon of _choice_ for
defending some of the narrow corridors would be a halberd. You don\'t need
much lateral room to use a halberd effectively. Most motions are either
stabbing or chopping. You stand more sideways than straight-on. You
can fight two abreast in all but the most narrow corridors.
  A three rank deep formation would be ideal. However two ranks is
probably the most likely. (You need pole arms longer than 2 meters
for three ranks which would present other problems on ships.) The
first rank is primarily defensive to stab and deflect those coming
in. If you are defending or static they can kneel for extra stability.
The second rank then fights over the first rank. Mainly smashing/cutting
strokes from above or using all those wonderful prongy bits to catch
opponents off balance so your front rank can get an opening and stab
and undefended vitals.

  I\'ve only fought with an Axe a few times. Can say much specifically
there. However I can see weapon and shield tactics being useful. Say
your enemy doesn\'t care about their ship and does want to use bullets,
tanglers or shotguns. March a phalanx of axe and sheld marines over the
deck and up the corridor. Think of a shield as supplemental armour
right where you need it. Worked for the Greeks and Romans :-).

>No hand weapons except can do anything against this type of armor.
  See my previous post about my high-tech variants with better
penetration. Even if you don\'t accept vibro-swords, mono-molecular
bayonets, or chain-bardiches, look at a different approach.
  The main "problem" with high-penetration projectiles is that
if you miss they might blow a hole in something you would rather
they didn\'t. Look at how they slaughter cattle, though. They have
a small hand-held "gun" with a very short barrell. You press it
against the cow\'s head and it activates.
  Take this design and put your high-penetration bullets in it.
Mount it on the end of a stick (or whatever). You basically have
a spear/thrusting sword with a powerful kick. Since it only activates
when in direct contact you don\'t have as many strays.
  [Now, of course, part of the reason these bullets have high-penetration
is because they accelerate down a long barrell. For this design
you might have to put the chamber in the "hilt" and use the
shaft for the barrell.]
  Imagine this sort of like fencing with rifles :-). Touche!

>I\'m not sure of how to get around this problem, other than to say that

  That would be a cop-out. Get over your "problem" of swords
in space and tally-ho!

That depends upon how you look at it. Yes, GDW were the actual owners of =

Personally, I go for Massilia myself for another reason. Massilia is the =

   The ax would be your best bet.  The classic E.E. "Doc" Smith Space Ax.
Made out of very dense, high tech material, with a cutting edge and a
piercing spike.  It\'s a weapon requiring skill to weild effectively against
armored foes.  An armored knight feared a skilled foe with a poinard more
than a peasent with a bill hook.  
   An idea I had was for a retractable \'ice pick\' of crystaliron or SD 
material built into the forearm of Battle Dress.  Like the poinard of old,
it would be used against the weak points of armor.  Such as the joints or
faceplace.

   Depends on what you want.  If you want the ship, you minimize
the damage.  If you want the cargo, you just try not to blow up the ship
or at least the cargo bay.

   This is a safer tactic.  You only board if you want to capture the
ship, or something/someone on it.  A Princess involved in the Rebel
underground for example.  :-)

Tergen Orbital On-Line

The Tergen sector information service has gone on-line,
with a modest offering of data available concerning
this remote and often-overlooked sector.

Features include likely animal enounter tables for
the sector (seems to be off-line at this time), 
personality types occurring in Tergen, and general 
data sheets for 10 subsectors.  According to our
contacts, the other 6 subsectors are too perilous
to have been mapped thus far.

A highlight of the service is the on-line ship design
system from the Engra Shipyards, a glimmer of 
(relatively) high technology and research in an 
otherwise unimpressive sector.  However, it too
still seems to have some wrinkles to iron out.

At this point the heart of the issue has become one of taste.  I prefer 
(somewhat) realistic SF, such as Babylon 5 to Star Wars style space 
opera.  The games I run reflect this.  

Ship\'s troops using hi-tech swords make sense for a space opera campaign, 
snub pistols and stunners make sense for more realistic SF.

1st of all don\'t assume everyone will be in Combat Armor.  Standard Crew
will likely be in the least encumbering Vacc Suit they can wear.  They still
have to run the ship while the battle rages around them.  For a standard
VAcc Suit, a Rapier or other Thrusting weapon will suit very well to punch a
relatively small hole and distract the opponent long enough to at least
patch the tear.  A Cutlass or other slashing weapon would rip a big one and
probably be a combat kill.

2ndly the Military may very well use cutlass against non-military enemies
like Pirates etc.  These are unlikely to use anything other than a Vacc Suit
anyway.

Lastly the last point made about blowing up ships is perhaps the best.  Why
Board anyway?  Unless there is a reason just blow \'em up real good.  If you
have to board, its not likely a capital ship anyway, and the scale will be
smaller.

Lastly the Imperium is sort of a kindler gentler time in which honor does
mean something.  Troops adhere to rules of war, and try to limit collateral
damage.  Once again cutlasses might prove useful to sort of force the enemy
to use the same.

 Which is more official for the capital of the People\'s Republic of

 That\'s about how I view this kind of difference - both "Massilia"
 and "Massila" are reasonable "Galanglicizations" of the Vilani
 name for the sector, "Masilaa".

Hey, this gives me an idea!  It\'s not unlikely that all other part of
Humaniti evolved the Homo Sapiens Sapiensis-style cranium of today,
but what about (the mostly ignored major race) the Darrians?  They
have a wider pelvis than Solomani & al, and the book claims that 
cildbirth problems are rare with the Darrian.  

        I\'ve ALWAYS hated the "Elves-in-space" look of the Daryen,
but
what if they kept the prognathous cranium?  The lower, longer
braincase?
It wouldn\'t mean their intelligence is any different than the other
races, but the rest of Humaniti might look upon them with some
contempt,
calling them "low-brow".

        Of course the rest of the body would have evolved from a
powerful
barrel-type body to a slight, spy one... With a very distinct head.
:)

Besides, there\'s so little documentation on the Darrians and so few
pictures... I don\'t think many people would mind a new \'twist\' to the
Darrians. :) 

P-L, sitting down to watch a new holovid comedy called "Quest for
Fire", 
featuring 3 Daryens on a quest to find the secrets of the star
trigger. :)

A very good point.  You\'d think that with the potential capabilities of TLs
10-15,
more lethal weaponry would have been developed, especially for use on high
tech, high pop "civilized" planets (especially Vilani-background worlds, where 
they really do care for the group/crowd/masses).

> The sonic stunners may be a bit outside the Imperium paradigm

Yes, but a sonic cone projecting at high volume, low hertz (pitch) can have
two effects:

o   One level (I think 12 hertz) causes an uncontrolled fear response.  This
is a bit iffy,
    as you may induce a fight (berserker) response rather than flight or
surrender.  But 
    most (human) folks just break down, cower and shake.  Most Vargr (and
K.kree, on 
    a different setting) try to sprint away.
 
o   A lower level (I think 8 hertz) causes a human\'s sphincters to open (kind 
    of demoralizing, especially in armor).

You would, of course, need various settings for various races.

(I\'d give affected PCs and NPCs an initiative roll against it, with minuses for 
holding (rigid, vibrating) solid objects and wearing rigid armor

Another option is various goo-guns and goo-bombs - these basically project a 
super-glue foam that immobilizes a perpetrator.  Goo-guns are short ranged, 
but goo-bombs can be shot using standard-sized grenade launchers...  These 
(which are being worked on now, actually) can be easily available by TL10, and 
get better (stronger) as TL rises...

Certainly it would be very easy to add a new bullet type to FF&S: rubber
bullets 
with say two steps worse penetration, but full knock-down effects for each
hit.  
These can generally be designed as low-power ammunition.

Joe Walsh comments:
>	Perhaps that shows the wargame roots of Traveller as well as any 
>other aspect of the system.  

No, it more shows the roots of Traveller in the mid-70s, where there was very 
little in the way of non-lethal weapons available beyond tear-gas.  Mace and 
pepper-sprays were just coming into existence. No one had heard of rubber
bullets.  And it was (probably) assumed that PCs would have little interest in 
these items.

"The FCI Consumer Guide". Lots of stuff from TL 0 to TL 7. Lots of prices
for clothing of various types. There were several different brand names for
each item and they had different AF (availability factor) and RF
(reliability factor).
Don\'t buy unless you as a GM are afraid of setting prices. Pick up the
2300AD Equipment guide instead; you\'ll get illustrations and some TL 8+
stuff.

There are no docs bundled with them, so I was wondering if anybody

In my completely unbiased opinion, Hard Times is absolutely the best
supplement ever put out by GDW and required reading for any Traveller player :)

Seriously, it\'s a supplement that sets up rules and scenarios dealing with
the years immediately following The Rebellion (1125-1130).  Nobody ever won
The Rebellion; all the factions remained, but by 1125, the widespread
destruction brought about by the war weakened all the factions to the point
that none could engage in any serious offensive against the others.  The
leaders withdrew to their greatly reduced "Safe" territories, leaving the
worlds between to fend for themselves in a sort of "no-man\'s land".  Hard
Times gives rules for implementing these changes on the worlds that were
left behind, and what sort of adventures characters can get involved in there.  

I like hard Times (in case you hadn\'t noticed) for a number of reasons.
With the advent of MegaTraveller, the Imperium had become both too big and
too small for my liking.  It was too big in that the Rebellion was such a
huge conflict that individual adventurers couldn\'t do much about it; it was
too small in that it seemed that virtually every sector of the Imperium had
been described in some detail, so there were no surprises for adventurers.
With the advent of Hard Times, there was no telling how badly worlds had
been damaged by the fighting until you got there.  A planet might have been
reduced from TL12 to TL6, so loading up on laser rifles would be out of the
question.  It might not even be easy to land; the former Class A starport
could be a huge crater!  Also, the scale of problems were reduced to
something that could be managed by a party of adventurers--evacuating
refugees, driving off pirates, or even simple salvage operations.

 Which is more official for the capital of the People\'s Republic of
 China - "Peking" or "Beijing"?

 That\'s about how I view this kind of difference - both "Massilia"
 and "Massila" are reasonable "Galanglicizations" of the Vilani

point: differing atmospheric densities.  Depending on what world you were 
on and what the weather conditions were, the stunner would have to be 
calibrated differently.  This would be quite a complex thing, though not 
outside the capabilities of a small computer and air-pressure sampling 
device.  You would also have to calibrate the stunner based on race (and 
perhaps the size of the opponent?).  A sonic stunner would not work in 
vacuum or trace atmospheres, and would probably have difficulty in very 
thin ones.  Depending on the exact nature of exotic atmospheres, there might 
be problems here as well.  Also, rain and snow might have adverse 
effects.  When in water or dense atmospheres, the stunner might have 
better range, though it would have to be properly adjusted.

This sort of calibration problem is common with other non-lethal weapons
as well.  Tranq rounds, for instance, have to be adjusted to body 
size of opponent as well as species.  This is why lethal weapons are favored 
by police forces: they are a known quantity.  Even a 300 pound guy on PCP 
will be "stopped" by a bullet (though he may not feel it), but he could 
very well laugh off a tranq round designed to safely sedate a 120 pound 
person.

Yes, this is intentional. The previous few issues of the TNS had
carried warnings of a virulent computer virus which was causing
widespread disruption throughout the Imperium. This virus was rumoured
to be some sort of Final Weapon unleashed by Dulinor or Lucan in an
effort to gain the upper hand. The TNS mentioned the possibility that

thanked me for doing the survey, and to you I say "you\'re welcome and 
thanks".  Now here are the results (drum roll please): 

There were 63 total votes.  According to Rob Miracle, there are over 500 
individual addresses which subscribe to the list, so we may not have 
quorum, but here\'s the breakdown of the votes:

Option	 Votes	Percentage
1	 5	(08.0%)				
2	 6	(09.5%)			
3	 3	(04.8%)
4	 2	(03.2%)
5	23	(36.5%)
6	 2	(03.2%)
7	15	(23.8%)
8	 7	(11.1%)

In the likely event that you didn\'t memorize what the options were, 
here\'s a recap:

1. Leave Traveller and Xboat alone, create new mailing list for New
Traveller.

2. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Xboat.

3. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Traveller.

4. Leave lists as are, and discuss New Traveller on either/both.

5. Create single list for all game versions.

6. Create several lists divided by topic, such as technology, history,
rules, etc.

7. Create new list for TNE, discuss New Traveller on Traveller, and leave
Xboat for CT/MT.

8. Other (please specify).

Option 5 was the clear winner, though 7 may be a closer second than it 
seems, since option 1 was very similar (only the names of the lists are 
changed) and individuals voting for one often indicated in comments that the 
other was also a preference.

Most of the option 8 voters were calling for a "wait and see when NT 
comes out" approach, though there were one or two calls for instituting a 
news group instead.

For those of you who sent in votes in an improper format, rest assured 
that I did go through your messages and included your indicated 
preferences in the survey.

I have not had time to do any stats on the numbers above to see what the 
confidence limits are or anything like that, but I may do so within the 
next week or so.


NOW FOR THE EDITORIAL PORTION OF OUR PROGRAM:

There seems to be a split between two major groups here, which I will 
call the Fractionalists and the Unionists (Fracs and Unis for short).  
The Fracs seem to think that it is a logical progression to go from 2 
lists for two game versions to 3 lists for three game versions.  The 
problem of cross posting does not concern them as much as it does the 
Unis.  The Unis want everyone to be one happy family and get everything 
back together again.  The Unis hate redundant postings.

Personally, I put myself in the Frac camp, and prefer option 7 or option 1
(three lists for CT/MT, TNE, and NT, respectively).  My main reasons for
this are as follows: 

1. One big list (i.e., option 5 or the Unis position) would lead to
confusion in new players, who would be confronted with a list where 50-75% of
the material would not be about the version of the game they just bought. 
They would have to figure out the whole history the Traveller game
versions and then sift through to find the NT material they were
interested in. 

2. One big list would result in very large digests which would contain a
great deal of information irrelavant to anyone\'s particular favorite game
version.  For instance, I do not want to have to sift through a bunch of
FF&S designs to get to the CT/MT/NT stuff that interests me, and I\'m sure
there are others who just the opposite.  Also, individuals paying for
storage would have to pay extra for information they don\'t want. 


Having said that, I could live with the Unionist option if some rules 
were instituted along the following lines:

1. All messages would be clearly labelled as to which game versions they 
applied to.  A prefix system might be one way to do it:  CT/MT, TNE, NT, or 
ALL would go before the message title.

2. All messages would have to have a title.  No more "Re: Traveller 
Digest 666" or similar vague subject lines.

3. Quoting previous messages would be limited.  No more pasting in 5 
generations of replies on a particular topic.

4. Any message which was over a particular length would be labelled as 
LONG in the title.

5. Flame wars would be quickly extinguished or moved to personal email 
addresses.

If we are going to have one list only for all Traveller versions, then I 
would suggest that the TML FAQ have an article (similar to one posted 
recently) explaining the history of the game.  Another idea would be a 
list of often used acronyms (e.g., TML and FAQ :-), so that newbies would 
not feel lost.

Well, that\'s all the ramble I got in me.  
Comments? Criticisms? Ranting Flames?

	For the record, I\'m a \'Frac\'.  The above would be fine by me as 
well, though.  Yet I wonder just how such things will be enforced.  If a 
person repeatedly, say, posts with the subject: line being "Re: Digest 
XXX," yet their posts are good, are they going to be kicked off?
	It just doesn\'t seem to be a very viable option to me.

I\'m new to the Traveller Digest as well as to the Xboat Digest so I am not
familiar with any previous treads that may have been exhausted. I have a
question regarding what may be one such "expired" subject:

Who sets up and runs a starport? From what I can learn from the various
sourcebooks available to me, starports are considered to be local affairs.
A planetary government or a company (or a combination of the two) are
responsible for the construction and maintenance of a starport. But how
does this mesh with TL. I mean, you can get a, say, A starport on a TL-7
world. How can that world conduct overhauls on TL-15 craft (or construct
starships for that matter)? Do they rely on imported parts, materials, and
machinery? If so, what if the nearest world with TL 15 were located far
(15+ parsecs) away? Wouldn\'t that affect prices?

I hope somebody can help me out.

Projecting a cone of =8910 Hz sound reguires the gun to have a cone or other
sound director on the same scale as the wavelength of the sound. 10 Hz

In fact starports are NOT local affairs. They are even more than 
airports today, considered to be territory not belonging to the 
planet (country), but to the Imperium. The town which lies next to 
the port however is planetary territory. So the weapons restrictions 
of the planet do not apply to the starport (though it may have it\'s 
own, and once on the starport, the local police can\'t directly get to 
you (although you might be extradited).

This is how i always understood the status of starports! Correct me

The one thing I *wouldn\'t* like to see is TNE messages.  I\'ll admit up 
front to a strong personal bias against TNE (for a variety of reasons), 
but I really feel that TNE material is likely to have less 
cross-relevance than material for any of the other variants.  Not only is 
there a different game system, the basis of the technology has changed, 
and there is a very different feel.

If people want to play TNE, that\'s their business, and I hope that they 
aren\'t left unsupported the way I was, because that sucked.  But:

I have no interest in TNE, and no desire to see anything about it.  I\'d 
have to say that I would not be a member of any mailing list that included 
TNE stuff, and I doubt I am alone.

I see these discussions as a way to bring greater depth to the game.  
That is, it brings an aspect of the game (guns) from the mythical level 
to the realistic level.  Instead of cardboard guns, I can now have more 
realistic guns.

When I was doing the research for the RPG I wrote seven years ago (which 
was never published - I\'ll write a post about that sometime), I ended up 
delving into a lot of weaponry and armor research.  None of the 
literature I perused on this subject was specificially for RPG\'s, yet 
reading them improved my understanding of combat paraphanalia.  This, in 
turn, improved the role-playing experience for me and my players.

I vote for continued non-flame discussions of weaponry.

Both of these are relatively the same so, I comment on both.

This is good.  I especially like the organization right now.  FOr instance,
I don\'t subscribe to TML because I don\'t play new era.  However, I think
that the TML should become the NT list, and that TNE should get a new one.
I only say this because the "Traveller" Mailing List should be about the
latest version.

>2. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Xboat.

This depends on how alike NT will be with CT\\MT.  If the rules are extremely
similiar, it could work.  Then again, the rules might be too different.
Another problem would be that background discussions about CT\\MT may confuse
players of the (supposedly) timeless NT.

>3. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Traveller.

Same as two, it depends on how alike the systems are.  If the system is
identical to TNE then it shouldn\'t be a problem.  (See comment about number 2)

>4. Leave lists as are, and discuss New Traveller on either/both.

This I don\'t like.  Only becuase the rules for NT may be distinctly
different from one of the systems.  This would make a lot of annoyance for
players of one of the system who would have to sift through mail that they
definitely don\'t want.

>5. Create single list for all game versions.

No, the differences in both games systems and background\\story are too much.
People ont he list would again have to sort through a ton of mail, or have
extremely long digests to read.

>6. Create several lists divided by topic, such as technology, history,
>rules, etc.

The only thing I don\'t like is that some areas may only be popular to some
people, and would therefore not have too many messages going back and forth,
making it more like a private e-mail discussion than a mailing list.  Also,
I personally find it better to get discussion about ALL aspects of CT\\MT
becuase usually something about almost each post interests me.

Lastly, I read int he original results post that some people suggested a
newsgroup.  Although it may sound good, I think a (for example)
rec.games.rpg.traveller would have the same problems as option 5 with lots
of topics being discussed that some people don\'t care about.  FOr me, I can
only read newsgroups on line, so it\'d be a waste of my precious hours
online.  Then again, you could create seperate newsgroups (eg.
rec.games.rpg.traveller.mt, etc.) for each game system.  However, I
personally prefer mailing lists to newsgroups due to the fact that I can
read mail off line.

	According to Marc Miller and Ken Whitman, NT will be 80% classic 
traveller, 20% new material.  Thus, the CT Book 2 ship combat rules will 
be there, as will the Book 5 rules.  But both will be "expanded in light 
of 20 years of role-playing experience."  
	I have no idea what the expansions will be.
	But I have been repeatedly assured that NT will be compatible 
with all the prior CT material (adventures, supplements, etc.).  In fact, 
it will be so compatible, there are deals in the works to get the classic 
third-party material (such as Paranoia Press and FASA stuff) released on 
CD-ROM so that folks can use that material with NT.
	Hope this answers some of your concerns.

    'body' => 'Hi There,

Like Henric Ahlrot (Starport Confusion), I\'m new to the Digest too so I
also hope I\'m not going over old ground.  Henric\'s problem seems linked
to the whole question of radically different Tech Levels located close
together and in commercial/political/military contact within a thousand-year
(or more) old civilisation.  This state of affairs doesn\'t seem very plausible,
but figuring out why it might have arisen is part of the fun of
being a Traveller GM!

With regards to the Starport question, G.M.s might rule that the starport of
a low tech (or low population)  system is maintained by a large central
Authority for strategic or economic reasons without regard to the wishes (or
knowledge) of the local inhabitants.  The starport might then be located in
orbit around the major gas giant of the system (for easy access to fuel) for
in the asteroid belt(for easily exploitable raw materials).  The tech Level
of the starport could then be assigned to be high (strategically vital),
average or low
(for obsolete backwaters and piratical merchant interests) depending on
the permissable max T.L of the campaign. 

On the same theme, I would rule that starships (or anything else) cannot be
repaired or built on a world without the required tech level.  It would be
difficult to get your 1996 Lap-top (T.L.8) fixed in 1911 (T.L.4)or even in
1975 (T.L.7).  Interestingly this might work in reverse, too.  It might be
quite difficult to find someone with the skills to repair an 1885 steam
locomotive nowadays.  However, the extensive technical databases and
flexible nanotech manufacturing of high-tech societies might get round this
problem.

Henric\'s question about prices also raises an interesting question about
interstellar economics.  I am not an economist (as will soon be apparent!)
but here are some thoughts.  For space-faring cultures even the rarest raw
materials are abundant (in asteroids etc) so the prices must be very low.
Similarly, advanced automated production processes must make the prices of
finished goods 
cheap too.  What then is the Interstellar economy based upon?  High Tech
manufactured goods is one possibility, but what do the low tech economies
have to exchange for them if their usual bargaining chip (minerals etc) is
also monopolised by the high tech cultures?  Food is another possibility since 
the number of worlds able to mass produce food must be relatively low, but
making synthetic food probably isn\'t beyond high-tech capabilities either.
I have a feeling that the Imperial Government (or whatever) would have a
very centralised command-type economy, as the Roman Empire did in some phases.  
Licences to exploit certain (or all) raw materials would be granted
according to quotas in order to maintain their relative value, leading to
illicit production and smuggling.  I\'d be very keen to hear other ideas on
this subject.

[snip]

Interstellar trade is a diffucult subject in Traveller.  This is because the 
ship designs available and (presumably) most popular among the planets of the 
Imperium (and beyond) do not seem to be able to support any significant 
interstellar trade at all!

Alright, as is my custom, when I see a traveller inconsistency I ignore it 
and treat things as I think thye *should* be.  Hence I feel there are many 
vessels of much larger tonnage (a design of which was posted to one of the 
mailing lists recently) i.e. in the 10,000 to 1 million ton range roaming 
about, unseen by the published documents.  They are moving the stuff of 
interstellar trade about.

What are they moving?

Unlike the previous poster, I do not think that mineral wealth will be found 
in any asteroid belt one happens to encounter.  There are going to be 
resources in any large economy which are rare and can be traded for finished 
goods or other resources in other places.  

Go back to the Merchant Book (book 7? - the purple one I think).  They have 
many ideas which get the theories flowing; Novelties are big among them, as 
are recorded items - music, movies, etc.  

Part of this implies to me that there is greater trade among world of close 
tech level than among planets with disparate tech levels.  Why would a TL7 
planet want holographic recordings after all?  (maybe they\'ll broadcast \'em 
in 2d over the television?).  

It is also plausible that lower tech worlds have resources (Lanthanum 
deposits? large laser-quality diamond deposits? Wood?) which would lead the 
higher tech worlds to intentionally manufacture something marketable at a 
lower tech level, but pretty much unsalable at their own.

Whatever happens, I think we will always see natural resources as refined as 
possible on site due to the high cost of shipping offworld.  Why would anyone 
send wheat offworld when the equipment to seperate the chaff and make flour 
(or whatever...) can be brought in on the same ship?

Food

I think we should never to see a planet (with a pop greater than about 4) 
which relies on interstellar sources to supply its population with food.  It 
would be ridiculous to inhabit a planet without self sufficiency in this 
basic area.  Can anyone else think of a good reason for this happening?

It would take immense amounts of dedicated tonnage, at enormous cost, to 
support any significant number of people.  Likewise with water. Any planet 
whith high technology would find a way to support itself, if possible.  In 
Glisten (asteroid belt mainworld, pop of 9) I have postulated (yes, contrary 
to, or rather without knowledge of the JTAS article on the same world) that 
they have (at TL14) set up a recycling ecosystem which only requires sunlight 
and an influx of water and minerals to maintain.  This means large vats of 
plankton and other hydroponics.  They get the influx of water and minerals by 
mining asteroids and moons (some of which are icy bodies) in the system.

Enough.  Does anyone have a seriously complete program for determining 
randomly what trade goods are available on a particular planet and how much?  
I have never been satisfied with the systems I have seen so far.

I hope we don\'t get into a flamewar about this.  I have no objection to
discussion about weaponry on the list - after all it plays a large part in
many Traveller campaigns.  However, as with many threads, I think
we ought to keep an eye on the relevance of what we post to
Traveller.  There comes a point when some threads have moved
away from their origins considerably, and, while interesting, do not
have that much to do with Traveller.  In cases like that, maybe the
particpants should think about moving the discussion to e-mail.

An analogy would be a discussion which starts off discussing grav
vehicles in Traveller, then moves to discussing lower tech transport,
which moves on to discussing 20th century Terran transport which
then moves on to comparing the Ferrari with the Lamborghini.
Fascinating for all the fans, not so much so for everyone else.

I am aware that there is probably a cultural split between posters in
the US and posters in Europe.  Quite simply, the number of people
interested in guns as a hobby or interest is far less in Europe than
it is in the States, for a whole variety of reasons, not least of which
are the differences in availability and legality.  As a result, discussions
which centre too much on Real World gun discussions, as opposed
to Traveller gun discussions, tend not to be so interesting to some
members of the list from outside the US.  An analogy would be
some list members from Europe discussing governmental
structures in Traveller, using the European Union as examples of
governmental structures, and then ending up talking about what
is essentially European politics rather than Traveller.

I\'m not trying to start a flame war, and I do not wish to offend anybody\'s
views on issues relating to guns.  I\'ve tried to keep my personal
views on the subject out of this deliberately so as not to perpetuate
the argument I am concerned this could slide into.  I just wanted to
offer a small plea for consideration amongst all sides of the views of
the others.

My, that all sounded awfully serious.  Anyone got any views on
a less contentious subject such as hurling rocks at planets,
feudal technocracy or the scientific plausibility of the Virus?   ;-)

I know I\'m on the wrong list to be complaining about this, but this strikes
me as the epitome of conceit.  As I was led to beleive, the mailing lists
were designed to support Traveller with GM\'s ideas on adventures, ships, and
other things.  While I can appreciate the fact that Virus and the TNE rules
offended some CT/MT players and the creation of X-Boat was warranted, I am
very offended by the implication that because I prefer TNE I am incapeable
of coming up with any new ideas that might be useful to others.  I\'m
terribly sorry that I didn\'t have the opportunity to purchase CT, and I
regret that, unlike other folks on these lists, I haven\'t had umpteen
million years of role-playing experience, but them\'s the facts.  My lack of
years in role-playing doesn\'t mean I have a lack of creativity.

I have a feeling that the general consensus is that when the new Traveller
comes out, many people will be using the new rules.  I for one (though an
avid TNE fan) can\'t wait for the return of thruster plates.  I also plan to
convert my TNE stuff to the new Traveller format soonest, and I anxiously
await the publication of Mileau 1200: The Reformation Coalition.  

As far as you not reading anything TNE, you might try subscribing to the
traveller mailing list(the list for TNE) for a week or two.  You might be
surprised at how many messages from TNE supporters you receive and find
useful.  There are a number of cross posted articles.  I also think that you
might find yourself in the minority as far as people who don\'t want to read
anything about TNE and "would not be a member of any mailing list that
included TNE stuff."  The number of people who subscribe to both lists is
amazingly high; it makes me wonder why we have two lists in the first place.
I know realize why we have two lists, though.  The folks who are in charge
are much nicer than I am and chose to support the few people like you who
couldn\'t accept the fact that something good might come from TNE.  In my
opinion, the fault is with your own creativity and not with TNE.

My humble apologies to the sane sentient people on this list, but I was
tired of reading TNE bashing on TML when a TNE person simply uses the TNE
list to voice his dislike of something CT or MT.

	Abundant only in the sense that there would be more available 
than there is on a single world.  But pricing is determined by (among 
other things) the supply /in relation to/ the demand.  The Traveller 
universe has a lot of raw materials available, but they also have a 
demand to match it.  Lots more people, businesses, and governments means 
lots more demand.
	So, it does not necessarily follow that because the supply of a 
given thing is great it will be cheap.  If the demand is great as well, 
the price will follow.

I find it absolutely amazing that people are griping about "gun posts" on a 
list devoted to a game written by a WARGAME DESIGNER, published by a WARGAME 
COMPANY and whose rules are at least 66% concerned with WEAPONS and COMBAT.  If 
you are personally offended by firearms, that\'s your business, but given the 
number of different people making posts about firearms, its obvious that most 
people on this list have some level of interest in the subject.

Ordinarily, I would not be some forceful, but I recently got a couple of flames 
sent to my work E-Mail for having the outrageous nerve to post about Weapons of 
Non-Leathal Intent on X-Boat.  Unfortunately, I deleted the messages out of 
annoyance before I came up with a reasonable response, but I consider those 
sorts of things (and the complaints on XBOAT and TML) to be silly at best.

  By an odd coincidence, I was reading World Builders Handbook last 
night, and there is a rule in there for miniumum tech levels of 
starports, something like an A starport has minimum TL 10 within the 
starport bound for repairs and such, and so on for lesser tech levels for 
lower rated ports.  Of course, if the system as a whole has a higher 
rating the starport will be at that tech level.

  World Builders also cointains a variety of suggestions for interpreting 
system USPs - email me if you want more details.

   Compatible is relative.  It could be something that *mechanically* isn\'t
compatible with anything released previously, but story-wise fits with
the previously published material.  TNE was compatible with all the
classic Traveller adventures, so long as you were willing to ignore story
development after 1116 and changed a few references here or there.

   The truth is that no one at Imperium Games had anything to do with the
development of TNE (probably a qualification for employment), nor is it
likely that they have even opened a TNE manual, let alone played the
game.

   They are either outsiders (people brought in by Marc Miller to be part of
the team) or people who have worked on classic Traveller or
MegaTraveller in the past.  The basis of their work therefore will be their
experiences with classic Traveller and MegaTraveller, and things they
have worked on since.  Our input does seem somewhat important to
them, as Marc Miller has asked in the past for us to send in e-mail voicing
our opinions on what the next generation of Traveller should be.

   Knowing that, I would look for something that has the feel of the
originial rules set c. 1986 (just before the release of MT), and is
mechanically similar, but with lots of add-ons, corrections and deletions.
High-Guard style ship design, but not High Guard ships.  MegaTraveller
style vehicle design, but not MegaTraveller vehicles.  It is possible you
will see design sequences similar to those in FF&S later on, but not those
same exact ones, and they will most likely be much simpler.

   Frankly, it is not in the best interest of Imperium Games to make a game
that is too similar to the original, as what incentive would people such
as myself (who owns Books 0 - 8, plus supplements, etc.) have for
buying it?  

   However it comes out, I would expect it to be a high quality project with
excellent production values.  Worth taking a look at, even if you  (Tom)
plan on continuing to use TNE and campaign in the New Era setting for
now.

Regards,

Harold

	The scenario you portray could very well be true.  However, in 
reading the Marc Miller interview from AOL, and from two phone 
conversations I have had with Ken Whitman of Imperium Games, it does not 
appear to be so.  But, I may have misunderstood what I was told.

	Remember that Marc Miller is the one who is in control of this 
project, not those at Imperium Games.  He gives final approval for 
everything.  He sets the direction (as he called it, the "vision 
thing").  It is certainly true that the people at Imperium Games come up 
with ideas for the game, but it is also true that those ideas don\'t get 
into the game without Marc Miller\'s approval.
	So even if those folks are completely unfamiliar with CT (which 
the new version is supposed to be based upon), Marc Miller is definitely 
not unfamiliar with it.

	This is purely my opinion here, not based in any facts at all, 
but it seems to me that they wouldn\'t scrap the ships we\'re all familiar 
with.  They may not all be there, and there will probably be some new 
ones, but the most popular ships will, I think, still be there.  (I\'m 
talking about ships from CT, not necessarily vehicles from MT.)

	I seriously doubt that they are counting on people like us, who 
have CT material up the wazoo, for a majority of their profits from NT 
rules.  I think (hope!) they want to sell to a much larger audience.
	And, even if we do have all the CT material ever published, we 
are certainly potential customers for new material such as Milieu 0, any 
new Adventures to be published, JTAS, etc.

I\'ve seen a couple explanations of this, one of which was:

The Vilani named the sector first; Massilia is a Terran near-cognate,
and was adopted.  The Vilani still call it by their name.

However, the Vilani name was not Massila (which I\'d wager is a 
misspelling).  I have the listing at home, so I\'ll try to remember to look
it up...

Hi all. Well, I\'m finally done revamping my sector viewer,
formerly known as galactic.zip. The new version is called
gal20.zip and is currently available from the programs section of
my homepage at http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv/

This is a pretty hefty upgrade, so I\'ll go through a brief list
of attributes & requirements:

   *  Allows you to randomly generate sectors via both the
      traditional method and a variant method which has its roots
      in a Traveller Mailing List discussion dating back to 1993
      (included with the online help). You can also display the
      maps, of course, and it translates into English the UWP
      code of whatever world your "cursor" is on so you don\'t
      have to sit there with the book open.

   *  Keeps campaign notes in text files which can be accessed
      directly from the subsector map. The maps all mesh
      seemlessly, and access to your campaign notes is a single
      keystroke away. You can even organize your notes under a
      system of menus if you want to keep them organized.

   *  Thirteen of the Classic Traveller sectors are included
      along with a variant universe sector which I\'ve just
      started to create (the Classic sectors came from the
      Sunbane ftp archive). All the sectors come complete with
      jump routes, incidentally, and several world write-ups by
      Rob Dean are also included with the Spinward Marches
      sector.

   *  Lots of online help. You don\'t even have to know much about
      Traveller in order to use this program. Basically, it was
      designed both for long-time players as well as for people
      who are curious about the game and are thinking of "getting
      into it."

   *  Built for DOS but, of course, also runs under Windows. You
      must have at least VGA graphics capability and over two
      megs of free diskspace.

   WARNING:   You must use "-d" option when unzipping:

      >>>>>>>>    pkunzip -d gal20.zip    <<<<<<<<

   Available Now:  http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv/
   (go to the programs section and look around)

Let me know if you have any trouble getting the program. I\'ll
arrange for alternate distribution methods in the next day or
two. If your access is limited to email, let me know, and I\'ll
try to arrange to postal you a disk (you will owe me a world
description or two though :-)

Somewhere around here...

I can\'t find it right now, but a few years back I created an Excel 4.0
workbook that detailed planets using WBH rules.  I also added a sheet that
printed out \'trade tables\' for every planet. (Rather like the old Book 2
trade, but with more generic items from more catagories.)

I\'m trying to find it now.  Remind me in a week if I haven\'t posted anything.
 You might also be able to find it on GEnie, where I uploaded it five years
ago.

Hmm, while I belong to both lists *and* have all three versions of Traveller, I
must say that I disagree with you and agree with Joseph. I do *not* want to see
TNE specific stuff on xboat. I suspect that that\'s what he\'s objecting to. And,
unfortunately, that means - no TNE Ship designs, as they are completely
incompatible with CT and MTrav; no Adventures in the RefCoal or Democratic
Domain of Deneb, as they exist in a future that many (if not most) people on
this list reject. What does that leave? A lot! Anything of a non-specific
nature - stuff that is likely to apply to any and all versions of the game
would be quite welcome. If it is too TNE specific, however, I really don\'t care
to know about it *on this list*.

And good luck to you, but don\'t hold your breath, as (as I\'m sure you noticed),
Imperium Games has indicated (unless they\'ve changed their minds on AOL?) that
the RefCol Milieu book is going to be a *considerable* way down the track. So,
unless Trav4 is a rip-roaring success, it may well never see the light of day!
And, of course, if Trav4 *is* a rip-roaring success, they may well never do it
because they will presume they will be able to make more money doing Milieu 0.

Sorry, but most of the stuff on the TNE list is a waste of bandwidth for a
CTrav or MTrav referee. All those ship stats, all those RefCol World Histories,
and stuff like that, are garbage as far as I am concerned ... some of the other
stuff is OK, but since Thruster Plates rule in my idea of Trav, and there never
was a Virus, then the rest is pointless (though, at least in the case of the
Planetary Histories, it seems well enough done; I presume the ships are as
well).

How many people subscribe to xboat as opposed to traveller? *Are* the
Ctrav/MTrav people in a minority? As to why we have the two lists, I thought it
was obvious ... many people thing that HePlar is revisionist and that Virus is
incredible (in the sense of unbelievable) stupidity!

I\'ve recently had the opportunity to peruse a very early first draft of the

superb job that takes Trav4 equipment (and tech) into the realms of Science
Fictional futures that have been undreamed of in all previous editions.

This is advanced technology that is *really* advanced ... a great deal of
thought has been put into integrating it all and extrapolating current trends
rather than simply taking outmoded tech and calling it "futuristic" as has been
the tendency in the past.

Anyhow, I think that everyone on these lists will like it when they see it. And

I didn\'t bash TNE.  I am quite capable of bashing TNE, should I choose 
to, but I didn\'t.  All I did was say "I am not interested in reading

preference.

It is almost certain that there would be something on a TNE list I would 
find interesting.  It is possible that there would even be something on a 
TNE list that I could use in my campaign.  As I do not run TNE, and I do 
not use Virus, I would wind up having to sift through a lot of stuff that 
wasn\'t relevant to me to find the useful things.  I have to do enough of 
that on the Net as it is.  I do much less of it on this list, because the 
subject matter of this list is relevant to my game.

The poster who responded to me was extremely insulting, and I am tempted 
to reply in kind -- but I don\'t think this list is an appropriate place 
for format flamewars, and I\'m not going to rise to the "challenge."  The 
existence of this much defensiveness on the subject (all I did was say 
"I\'m not interested in TNE," and I got flamed) should serve as a warning 
about the possible consequences of combining the lists.

This subject has been touched on the TML I think and as far as I can see
the problems are several and the benefits are few. One has to throw out a
lot of historical canon as distances between empires, neighbouring
relations et c will change drastically. It is also somewhat impractical to
use without a computer, 2300AD manages this by having a fairly small map
but the huge Imperium is another matter. TNE could certainly use 3D maps as
so much is unexplored/forgotten terrain and in a TNE setting I\'d say the
added realism would make up the extra work. Also year zero T4 could use 3D
maps as the empire had just begun at that time but MM will probably not do
away with the 2D map.
Another place where 3D would IMHO give more rewards is in space combat. My
group had a 3D spacecombat system for a while in the 80s but we felt the
extra work didn\'t pay off (we didn\'t and don\'t use computers during play,
only for designwork, database and chargen).

I have been working on 3 d star renderings for a while now.  Given a fairly
small volume of space its not hard to convey the 3D information through
visual clues.  Developing the Traveler universe has some other problems,
that are going to kill canon and/or reality one way or another.  You either
ditch the distance relationships, or accept a drasticly higher number of
systems -- most of which will probably be uninhabited, buit they will be on
the map.  And trying to reconcile the known locations of stars (currently
only decently known to about 20-25 parsecs, but soon the be completely
revolutionized by the Hipparcos mission) with where you want to place
generated systems further out so that you don\'t end up with an extra star in
the big dipper gets to be a real hair-puller.

I agree with this one.  If you are up to the math and don\'t worry too much
about gravity, this can be done by hand -- but its gets to be a drag.  I am
working on what I hope ill be a decent multi-player computer game, but for
copyright reasons I am working it back up from the raw physics.

FYI, according to the Osprey book on the Gurkhas, the kukri has shrunk

There is a group playing traveller in a 3d universe that has made their
maps available; afaik, it doesn\'t use the imperium...

Traveller\'s mapping is 2D, always has been, and, while it is a fudge, it
makes it playable.

Take a look at Phil McGreggor\'s Space Opera for the problems of 3D mapping;
while the sector books were well done, visualizing borders is well nigh on
impossible! (No offense, Phil).

2300 managed, as well; however, having a 2.1 parsec limit on deep-space
travel keeps down the number of routes, and most of the available routes
were presented on the corners of the big map included in the boxed set. (I
only ever found 1 in 3 years of GMing 2300.)

Doing so for traveller would also require utilizing one of several
solutions, which were ranted down a while back:

        1)      keep the existing maps as a central plane, and add worlds
                above and below it.
        2)      Keep the existing map as a planar reference, and move existing
                worlds up &/or down within their hex
        3)      use really nasty maths to keep the relative routes the same
                distance, and trash the existing maps.
        4)      Make entirely new maps and ignore that which came before;
                put key worlds the right travel time away, and completely
                redo the rest
#1 Adds worlds... way too many of them.
#2 changes the extant routes because the distances can change WILDLY.
#3 Throws out the extant material, and is next to impossible, as somewhere,
someone is gonna gripe cause their faovorite spot is either too close or
too far from some other spot. It would also make the imperium look much
less imposing.
#4 just keeps the basic feel, but is easily enough done by using someone
else\'s maps, and assigning Traveller UPP\'s to all the worlds.

 It\'s a matter of relativity.  When you have 11,000 worlds to draw
 on, you probably have as much diamond as you could possibly want -
 but that doesn\'t change the fact that diamond is a lot less likely
 to be found than nickel-iron.  So, it\'s comparatively rare.

 Also, the rarity of a substance/product will depend in part on the
 demand for it, and the ease and cost of getting it from the
 production point to the consumption point.  Nuteman dragon meat
 may be available for pence per tonne on Nutema, and everyone can
 eat as much dragon steak as they want - but how much is it going
 to cost to transport a tonne of it to Terra, even in a secure,
 unified Imperium?  That\'s going to drive the price up, and make it
 comparatively unavailable on Terra.  Also, available ship tonnage
 for dragon meat may only be able to transport a fraction of what
 is demanded.  That makes dragon meat rare on any world that can\'t
 get the quantities that the market demands.

 Not necessarily.  What\'s the cost of maintaining and replacing the
 machinery that implements the automated production processes?
 What\'s the cost of transport off-planet?  What sort of taxes are
 collected upon export?  Are all of the raw materials needed
 provided locally?  If not, how much does it cost to bring them in?

 Note that the transport capacity and demand issues apply here,
 too.  It\'s quite likely that high TL stuff is in heavy demand on
 lower-tech worlds - possibly beyond the available transport
 capacity.  Also, distance from source is going to be a factor in
 the price on the destination...

 What is the international economy based on?  High tech nations can
 produce high-tech manufactured good, and usually have techniques
 that will allow the raw materials to be produced cheaper than the
 low tech nations can do it.

 Except that wages in low-tech nations are lower, allowing these
 nations to extract raw materials at more competitive prices.  And
 "social capitalism" or "capitalistic socialism" is a good system
 for these nations - foreign investment is welcomed, but either
 repatriation of profits is limited, or the state or a local
 company must own a significant (possibly 51%) share of the
 operation, or both.  There are ways, artificial to be sure, of
 making low-tech competitive, or at least necessary, to/with
 high-tech.

 Why else would countries like the United States have their panties
 in a twist about jobs being exported offshore, to places like
 Central America and the Far East?

 Well, those ships are the ones that player-characters will be most
 likely to encounter.  How many people on Earth today are familiar
 with supertankers to the same extent as they are with the much
 smaller cruise ships?  Or the still smaller personal vessels

 Many?  Not necessarily.  But they exist, and they suffice for the

 Probably.  Also, it\'s reasonable to assume that they\'ll also be

 Yes, it was Book 7, and it was purple.  Title, "Merchant Prince"

 That\'s one possibility.  Another possibility is that trade is
 really localized to clusters of worlds, quite likely with overlap
 between clusters, but not a lot of direct trade between central
 worlds in different (even adjacent) clusters.  So, there might be
 trade between the Jewell cluster and the Regina cluster, but
 direct trade between Jewell and Regina will be low, and between
 either of those and Glisten or Mora will be vanishingly small.

 Only if it can be done _and_ transported at a lower cost than it

 Not on a permanent basis.  But temporarily, during a planetary
 disaster, isn\'t unreasonable (the local flu bug has mutated, and
 the entire hydroponic crop of blackroot potatoes was killed.  We
 need to import enough plants and enough potatoes to tide us
 through the crisis, while we find a cure for the blackroot

 Water, especially, since its volume can\'t be reduced at any

 the gas giants for hydrogen and oxygen, and make the stuff
 yourself.

You might want to get your hands on the Alien modules that were released,
they are: 

Vilani and Vargr: The coreward races
Zhodani and Droyne: The psionic races
Hiver and K\'Kree: The exotic races
Solomani and Aslan: the rimward races
Humans and Nonhumans: the minor races

I only have the fourht (S&A), but I must say that it\'s an incredible book.
The shear amount of work is enormous!  

Also, you might want to consider picking up 101 Vehicles, which is a good
book is your character spend time on planets.  Lastly, the Starship
Operator\'s Manual is pretty good.  I don\'t own it, but I was flipping
through and thought it was pretty cool.

Well, I won\'t take *all* the credit (or blame) ... actually, Ed Simbalist did
the co-ordination and put together the stuff that I and Mark Ratner did along
with his stuff. I know that I didn\'t do the 3D mapping system ... but whether
Mark or Ed did, I\'m not sure (I *think* it was Ed). In any case, I always had
the impression that the assumption behind it was that borders in any real sense
were nonexistent in space ... all you have to defend is the point targets
(Planetary systems). Though I will agree that I never liked it much either -
and I tend to prefer a flat-space system ... and if I ever get my own SF RPG up
and running fully (it\'s in an advanced state of semi-completion), then it will
have some form of 2D flat space mapping ... it does as it stands, but I\'m not
100% satisfied with it.

        XBOAT is for discussion of CT/MT topics and TNE has no place being

        TRAVELLER is for discussion of the current version of Traveller

Referee\'s Companion:
        The Large Scale Combat Rules are wonderful, but not so involved as
most mini\'s systems. The Research rules are nice, and it\'s got the
in-system travel and transfer times. The racial capsules are not bad, but
not enough for PC\'s. Collection of forms in the back.

World Builder\'s Handbook (or Grand Census and grand survey):
        The world Detailing system is indispensable when you need a
kickstart for the imagination. I just wish someone would make it available
on the MAC!

*Also nice to have, but not in the Required pool:

Starship Operator\'s Manual
        A detailed guide to life aboard a small tramp freighter, and
expanded task and procedure charts for ship operations. I wish there were a
volume 2.

1001 Vehicles
        Includes enough vehicles for most games.

I did something on these lines for known space/2300AD some time ago.
Back in the mists of time ( late 1970s ) a guy from the British
Interplanetary Society published the BASIC code for an APPLE II for a
program called STARGATE, which would take a star list and display
either:

a) A "night sky" view from around any on the database
b) A 2D map centered on any star with any chosen third axis shrunk to
zero
c) A "psuedo 3D" tank view, with the chosen star at the centre of a
cube, and the other stars correctly in perspective around it.

All of these could be zoomed, rotated etc

In the early 80s I re-wrote the program for the BBC Micro in BASIC,
and in the late 80s I re-wrote it again for the Atari in C/GEM. I put
it into the public domain and it got pretty good reviews. I added a
few extra features ( like the ability to plot routes and have the
program "animate" the journey), but the core of the program is those
original trigonometry alogorithms.

If anybody wants the source or Atari executable then please e-mail me.
I do have it in the back of my mind to update it, probably into Visual
Basic, and if there\'s a lot of interest it may move up a few places on
the wish list.

I must admit I have toyed with how to take the 2D traveller data and
show it as 3D, and I do think that maybe T5 (!?) will have to bite the
bullet and move away from the 2D maps!

Finally, some time ago I picked up the folowing URL for a program
which sounded very simlar to STARGATE but I\'ve never found time to
check it out. URL is ftp://ftp.maths.tcd.ie/pub/jaymin/cherryh.  The
files needed are chv-data.zip, chview.doc and chview.exe. You may want
to check it out.

  I\'ve run a 3D traveller campaign for years. No problem.
If you keep it fairly small scale you can do it with
printouts. If you want to go to any scale you *can\'t*
do it without computer support. Even then it is workable
enough.
  More recently, though, I\'ve begun running a Bughunters
campaign. [For those of you who missed this, this was the
Aliens-like rules for TSR\'s Amazing Engine system.] This
is set in near-earth 3D space.
  They include a fairly colourful map and an appendix of
data on 3D space in the back. It is an absolute bitch to
try to do anything with this. Sure, the DM can work a few
specific things out in advance but any decent player
would balk at all the computation involved. (Eg. just
how far _is_ Delta Pavonis from Ross 154?)
  Fortunately I have been working on 3D Star Viewing
software for a unrelated project. It has this useful
feature where you can define one (or more) "civilisations"
and give them an expansion rate. It will then work out
what stars they colonise and add this to the data.
Using this on a database of about 9000 stars within 250LY
I\'ve marked the stars explored or colonised or with stations
as well as the major jump-routes.
  Think of it like "Campaign Cartographer" for Space.
  Now the players can view their universe, call up data
and plot routes for themselves. As a DM I can work out
appropriate relations and campaign background.
  [I would note, I have actually produced a 2D abstract
map of colonised space "For Earth Senators" that I use
for abstract planning :-). Similar to the one in the
actual Aliens Role Playing Game.]
  The beta version of this software is on ftp.maths.tcd.ie
in the pub/jaymin/chview directory. It will be released
in a week or two formally.

There are ads for Mac software at the back of WBH from DGP but I\'m not
shure if it ever passed vaporware status. I have made a utility that
expands a standard UPP/UWP string to an entire starsystem with moons,
gasgiants et c. It doesn\'t follow WBH rules to the letter but it should be
usable and it\'s free.
I\'ll post where/when it will be available.

Digest 611)

I\'m a bit puzzled about the status of low tech (<= TL5) planets in the
Imperium. I want to keep this type of world in my game, but find them a bit
difficult to explain.  Low tech worlds have little or no political or
economic clout, and no military influence at all.  Historically, high tech
nations have colonised and exploited low tech ones, so why has\'nt this
happened in the Imperium?  The IISS protects the most vulnerable ones by
banning contact, but how do the rest cope with their powerful neighbours? On
the same theme, why do these worlds exist at all.  Does anyone have any
interesting models for low tech worlds, other than the "Lost Colony" model
which is getting a bit dog-eared nowadays.

About face! Does anyone have any tips on role playing life on one of the
ultra high tech worlds, those above, say, TL13?  What would these societies
be like?  I ask because I\'m trying to avoid presenting these worlds as being
just like 1996 except with more gizmos.  Victorian sci-fi writers predicted
space travel, submarines, robots and so on, but did\'nt predict computers,
global communications or the electric toothbrush.  I know their aim was to
satirise their present, but they rarely examined the impact of technology on
society.  How can GMs avoid doing the same thing?

Actually, there\'s a rather LONG list of minor human races. I compiled
them as part of a collection of race descriptions I put together.  There are
a few minor human races (some rather wide-spread) that fit this bill:

o   the Cafadi (corridor sector)
o   the Geonee (spread all over Massilia sector)
o   the Feskals of Florian (Trojan reaches, though they don\'t travel much)
o   the Suerrat (Ilelish; these were the people Dulinor ruled)

And there are stranger still human races, but those have been geneered...

>They have a wider pelvis than Solomani & al,
Not "et al"; wider than the Solomani & the Vilani, perhaps, but there\'s a lot
of morphology involved in humaniti.

Of course, they probably do that for most of the groups listed above. But only 
when they find them away from home.  :-)

I don\'t know where you get the idea that the Daryens are not well-documented
They were covered in CT (they had their own Aliens module & articles in JTAS), 
MT and are described in TNE\'s Regency Sourcebook, complete with a physical
description.

Actually, only 2 of these ever came out.  Solomani & Aslan (Rats & 
Cats), and Vilani & Vargr (Bogs & Dogs).  DGP cancelled the rest of 
the series, when they realized that GDW was pulling the plug on 
MegaTraveller in favor of T:TNE (Traveller: The Nilsen Ego).

They are however excellent works, with tons of backgrounds, sector 
data for a couple of sectors, vehicle designs, robots, and great 
background stuff.  I also heartily echo the person who recommended 
World Builder\'s Handbook.  A great reference.  Lots of cool ideas.

This varies widely.  A starport can be owned by a local planetary government;
a local balkan government; a private corporation; an imperial organization 
space navy, scout service, imperial colonial government.

>But how does this mesh with TL. I mean, you can get a, say, A starport on

In this case, the technology to operate and maintain the Starport obviously 
comes from off planet.  A TL7 world can only maintain a TL7 starport - and 
at TL7 (pre-stellar), there are no starports.

>How can that world conduct overhauls on TL-15 craft (or construct

It doesn\'t.

>Do they rely on imported parts, materials, and machinery? 
yes

>If so, what if the nearest world with TL 15 were located far
>(15+ parsecs) away? Wouldn\'t that affect prices?
The location fo the nearest TL15 world has a large effect on the price of
TL15 products.  Each product has to be hauled (for 15KCr per ton) from
the TL7 world.

There are added rules that discuss the price and availability of high tech items
on lower tech worlds.  I tend to add a factor for distance as well, since
shipping
people and items is so expensive.

In such a set up, in my campaign, the TL7 world would at best be able to send
a message on the next available starship to ask for assistance.  Be prepared
for a long wait until someone at a TL15 world responds.  And be prepared to pay 
a lot for that service...

Now someone from a closer world may get wind of your problems and show up
and offer to swap out you TL15 bad parts for some TL12 parts they have for less
cost (and some degradation in performance or size or power requirements) and get
you going before any TL 15 folks are liekly to appear.  It\'s up to you...

Do not mistake ownership with the rules that govern the operation of.
Henric\'s question was who builds.  In Traveller, most of a planet\'s main 
public use starports have extra territoriality, subject to imperial law...
but the
imperium does not build or maintain the starports.  If so, all starports would
have the same TL.  They do not; the have a TL usually based on the local TL
because that\'s who builds and maintains it.

In my campaign, this may well vary by planet.  Check local law before 
committing crimes on planet :-)

Unfortunately, only 1 and 4 in this list were ever published (although
if someone can tell me I\'m wrong, I\'d be extremely pleased!) which is
a pity because they are truely stonking pieces of work.  Perhaps T4
will revive them.  I\'d also advocate 101 vehicles and 101 robots (the
latter is technically CT rules - but compatible with MT).  These two
are even more useful if you are willing to ignore the descriptive
paragraphs which indicate that the item of equipment is (say) Solomani
when you are adventuring in (say) the Spinward Marches.

My take on 3D space:

I\'ve played with this, and it is very easy to do, I think. I\'ve never
actually got around to creating a campaign using it though.  Assuming
that you want something inkeeping with the published 2D
representations, I use the Preserve Maximum Linear Distance (PMLD)
assumption.  If you look at an (8x10) standard 2D subsector, then to
PMLD within the subsector (12.8 parsecs) then the nearest you can get
is a cube with 7 parsec sides.  This means the largest distance you
can travel in a straight line and stay in the same subsector is about
the same.  Sectors are then cubes with four subsectors on a side
(inkeeping with PMLD), and Domains are cubes with two sectors on a
side.  If you take "standard" density as 40 worlds per subsector
(ie. 50% of 8x10 2D subsectors) then in 3D standard density is a 12%
chance of there being a world in a given cubic parsec.  The choice of
sector size means that a "standard" sector has 2560 worlds (cf 640 in
2D).  However, because I\'ve used PMLD, the size of a sector (in terms
of travel times, etc.) is the same for the 3D case as it was in the 2D
case.  Most of the discrepancies between 2D and 3D background occur on
the large scale - if you convert the Imperium to this system, I think
it comes out as containing 400,000 worlds - again they are all within
the same commo lag as in the 2D case.

I\'ve even come up with a mapping grid - 2 x 4 boxes, 7 parsecs on a
side, with the eighth box containing the map legend.  It works quite
well, although I suspect commo routes need to have some ingenious
method of representation, and are probably difficult to determine (a
lot of worlds can be within 4 parsecs.)  I think tables of "worlds at
2 parsecs" etc. will probably be useful, or some sort of overlay
template which allows you to see which worlds on the map are at 1, 2,
3, etc. parsecs.  You also have to decide things like: Is a distance
of 1.4 parsecs jump-1 or jump-2?  The second choice makes jump-1
starships far more restricted, and probably reduces the number and
length of mains dramatically.

I have wondered if 3D maps would work if they were
presented in bite-sizes.  

For instance, the 2D subsector has what?  about
80 hexen on it?  So, say it has about 40 stars
on it.

An 16x16x16 light-year cube would have about...
hmmm... 

	16/3 ~ 5 hexen per side?

 5x5x5 hexen ~ 125 cubic hexen, or

              ~ 64 stars in it?

Now, to build a cube subsector, form an octet of
these cubes.  Sure, it\'s nonstandard, but hey, 
we\'re way off canon by now anyway.  And what
is Traveller canon but a Montana speed limit?

I guess crossing a cube border might involve
some calculation, but the smaller-size octets
make local manouvres easy and visualizable.  
Also, I put the scale in light-years to make 
up for the cube size decrease, for a finer 
granularity.

It looks alright, and it \'feels\' more technical,
whereas the Imperial subsectors almost feel
terretorial or politic.

down for a couple of hours and move the subscriber database, converting it
to a majordomo format.  The aliases will be adjusted so that mail to:
traveller@mpgn.com and xboat@mpgn.com will go to the majordomo version.  At
that point we will be up on majordomo.  We will restart listproc, and let
the partial digest expire and be sent out.  So you may get two partial
digests tomorrow or Thursday.

Posting messages will not change.  You will continue to post to
traveller@mpgn.com and xboat@mpgn.com.  What will change is administrative
options.  If you are digest and want to go to instant, you send a subscribe
message to traveller-request@mpgn.com, and send a unsubscribe request to
traveller-digest-request@mpgn.com.

Digests will have a slightly different format, and will have a different
file name in the archive . . . Which brings up the archive:  Since
ftp.mpgn.com is a couple of weeks from being here, we will go ahead and
archive the messages.  You  can do a majordomo get to retrive them.  When
ftp.mpgn.com arrives, we will load the digests to that machine and away we go.

With any luck, this should be fairly seemless to you and things should run a
bit smoother.

	Hi all.  Following the results of the survey on the future of
TML/XTML, several people have called for the unification of all lists into
one.  This was the option that clearly won in the survey (somewhat to my
disappointment, but hey that\'s the democratic process...) and people seem
to want to get this going now. When I started the survey, my idea was that
this was simply an opinion poll.  I was not thinking that the results
would be implemented right away.  I would like to wait for NT to come out,
and run another poll at that time to confirm opinions.  Following this, we
could change/combine the lists. I\'m pretty sure Rob Miracle is not going 
to change anything before then in any case.
	While I\'m on the topic, I would like to re-iterate my strong 
support for some system of rules to be implemented if we have one big 
list.  I\'m not expecting Rob Miracle to censor the list or anything.  The 
rules would be informally enforced.  Whenever anyone signed up to the 
list, they\'d get a note outlining the "netiquette" of the TML/XTML.  
Offenders would simply recieve notes from list members reminding them of 
the guidelines (I would do it, and others who get peaved by this sort of 
thing would probably do so as well.).  Repeat offenders might be dealt 
with more harshly, especially if they engaged in frequent flamewars.  
Here again is the list of rules I would recommend.  Anyone want to add 
to/subtract from/modify this?

Ciao for now,

PS. I think newbies to the list should recieve the URL for the mailing
list FAQ if they don\'t already, and also a URL for some sort of "History
of Traveller Game Versions" (I know there\'s at least one out there, 
though I can\'t remember where).

Historically the high tech nations pulled away from colonization when 
they discovered that the return wasn\'t enough to justify the cost.  Maybe 
these low tech worlds can be sources of cheap labor, except no one but 
the wealthiest could afford the products they produce (although a black 
market would surely exist).

I can think of a few reasons why low tech worlds may persist:  (1) a lack
of resources to build the required infrastructure, and hence a lack of
interest from outside parties; (2) a rigid government that stifles
advancement in the interests of controlling the population (and
maintaining its traditional source of income); (3) some other social
institution that forbids or anathemizes the use of non-traditional
technologies. There could be many other reasons.

WBH gives worlds a "novelty" TL based on the highest TL of their 
neighbors.  This represents the tech that\'s available to those who can 
afford the price.  Even if the low tech world has a few people 
knowledgeable enough to reproduce such novelties, the world would lack 
the ability to construct the facilities capable of mass-producing them 
(without outside help) and possibly also the transportation 
infrastructure to distribute them.  I think using an analogy of the 
relations betwen industrialized countries and "third world" countries 
might give at least a starting point.

To the best of my knowledge, only \'Vilani and Vargr\' and \'Solomani and Aslan\'
were ever released. For the K\'kree, Zhodani and Droyne you\'ll have to go back to
the CT alien modules (the Darrians also appeared and the overlap of content on
the Vargr, Solomani and Aslan races between the CT and MT Alien books isn\'t
complete, so you might want those as well if you ever see them). The Hivers have
both the CT Alien module and their TNE appearance in Aliens of the Rim (which
subverts some of the CT assumptions).

While we\'re talking about aliens, anyone have any idea whether T4 will have any
significant alien presence? The Vilani are the only major race close to Sylea,
so we may see more development of the non-Solomani humans instead.

Actually, the "Elves in Space" from my campaign were the "Illyeshka" which
were human-ish only they *averaged* 7ft tall.  A very xenophobic race, those
of them who had any contact with humans were considered odd by their race\'s
standards.

The small amount of contact that existed was in a gem trade and a medicinal
herb trade.  Typically the only things they were interested in from humanity
was vegetarian foodstuffs and wine. 


I used to love taking fantasy races and re-working them for Traveller, let a
party encounter some them and see how long before they realized "..hey! That
was an Ogre!"

Le 7 mai 1996 Mitch Schwartz as dit:
[lots of stuff contradicting my idea deleted]

Well to quote someone else; "This is my house rule and I can do what
I damn well please with it!". :)

I wasn\'t aware of the Geonee\'s and Suerrat\'s prognatism, because I\'ve
never paid any attention to them.  So I suppose my idea isn\'t very
original :).

As far as the Daryen look being documented, well I\'m sorry there
aren\'t really that many references to the true Daryen look.  I own
the Darriens alien module (in fact I only miss K\'Kree, Hivers &
minor races - oh, and someone just stole my Zhodani!), and they make
no references to the cranial features of the Darrian.  They only tell
of skin, eye and hair tones.  And some of the sources are
contradictory - someone pointed out (I think it was on the TML, a
long time ago :) that some pictures of the Darrians show them without
the pointy ears.   (Although that can be explained by the fact that
other parts of humaniti live in Darrian space).

Anyway, my point is that the look of the Daryen should be a little
more original - I thought I had a good idea, but I guess it\'s been
done. :|  I\'ll keep using it till I find something better then. :)

PS:  I recently made a table to generate the hair/eye/skin tone of
ANY member of humaniti for random encounters, based loosely on
somebody else\'s previous work. :)  I\'ll post it if anyone wants it -
it works fine for correct hair color, etc, but I\'ve never seen a
Zhodani with knee-lenght hair. :)

Just some ideas:

   Maybe some of these low tech worlds could be inhabited by
   voluntary low tech societies who are rebelling against 
   or simply dismissing technological advances, something like the Amish
   or the "free love" communes of the 1960s.  Often these types
   of communities are, in general, low tech but need some contact with
   the outside world (i.e. have some need of star ports).

Actually, since price of shipping is the same per jump (regardless
of how long the jump is), the cost to ship over a distance depends
on how you ship it.  Ironically, if you ship it on a fast jump 6
ship it is cheaper than if you ship it on a slower jump 1 ship.

     Someone forwarded your mailing to the HIWG mailing list to the general
\'old Traveller\' mailing list (xboat@mpgn.com).  Since you solicit feedback,
I\'m pleased to be able to write to you.

     If you don\'t mind, I\'d like to enthuse for a paragraph or two.  I have
been a fan of Traveller since the day after the first boxed set arrived in
my local hobby shop in 1977, although the last Traveller product that I bought
was Survival Margin.  (Not your fault, after your time and all that!)  I still
keep a copy of Starter Traveller (the most compact form of the rules) tucked
into my briefcase, just in case I feel like fiddling with it a bit.  My
collection of Traveller materials includes everything issued by GDW and DGP
for CT and MT, plus assorted things from other people (with Gamelords books
being my favorite third party material.)  I\'m very pleased to see that the
rights are reverting to you, and I hope that you will be able to get something
back into publication in short order.

     I would like to offer you my services as well.  I am a freelance proof-
reader as my second profession, and I am very familiar with the existing
Traveller corpus.  I would be happy to proof for your venture, and can hope
to spot mechanical errors in the process.  (A typical rulebook might take
two weeks, allowing for checking of the rules.)  For this project, you can
have my services at a very nominal fee, rather than the $0.85/page I get for
reading bodice-rippers...

    Now on to my reactions to your posted ideas:

Yes.  I really think that the DGP task system was one of the best innovations
added to the basic CT rules, and I\'d be content if it was carried over intact
into the new game.  I would also _strongly_ (!!!) urge that you give due
consideration to the maintenance of continuity with existing campaigns by
carrying forward the basics of character generation.  I consider one of the
strengths of D&D to be the fact that everything from original D&D forward has
compatible character descriptions.  (Theirs tend to become more elaborate,
but Traveller has done that too.)  In other words--I think that changing to
a totally different rules system was a rotten idea, because it voided my
fifteen years of accumulated work.  (So I\'ve been planning on carrying on
with the old rules when I next start up.)

I think that an SF game needs a design system, and I spent a lot of time with
the MegaTraveller system, which I rather disliked.  (Still, I have an archive
of over 300 designs, all of which were posted to the Traveller mailing list,
and a number of which made it into published Traveller materials via Charles
Gannon.)  A usable system, to my mind, is one which does not require a
computer!  I\'m less worried about whether various real world items can be
recreated exactly, and even less worried about the fringes of the system
where it starts to break down.  It would be nice, though, if both of the
latter points were addressed in some sort of designer\'s notes, so that
everyone would realize from the outset that there are holes, and to have an
idea of where they are.  I don\'t think that higher detail helps--just inspires
more questions.  No one ever had a problems with Book 2 starship design, as
far as I could tell...

??? What is this?  Something other that the mailing lists?

If you could put out an archive disk of everything done to date, I\'d probably
buy a CD drive to use it.  Hypertext linkages among the material would be
fantastic.  I\'d love to be able to hand the players a "library data" disk
and let them sift for the clues...

Maybe.

Another maybe--I wrote a program to do trade with book 2 rules once, and
I guess I\'d use something to generate animal encounters tables and planetary
data, but I\'d rather not need a spreadsheet to design a vehicle.

Unless they were really good, I\'d sonner read Piper, Anderson, Doc Smith and
the other inspirations for the game.

Probably I\'d buy.  Not anything for the Virus era though.

Well, if it\'s to be an SF game, get the robots and the aliens out early, and
my personal opinion is that you can\'t have too much background data.

I can\'t do calculus with a calculator. But I CAN do calculus with a
stick and some dirt. In fact, I HAVE done calculus with a stick and dirt
(well, sand actually).

I don\'t think it\'s bollux to say that Tech-Level is not the same thing
as Knowledge-Level. In fact, it may be more closely related to something
that could be called "Industry-Level". Knowlege level varies from
individual to individual. But Tech-Level, as I understand it, describes
a culture\'s capabilities, not an individual\'s knowledge.

To put things crassly, TL says what a character is allowed to buy, at
the manufacturer\'s retail price, when he\'s on a particular world. (Maybe
it should be called "Shopping-Level" :) ) Obviously TL is nothing more
than a broad generalization; the referee has to decide all the
particulars, as always. So what else is new?

I guess the interesting issue is why you can\'t buy anything anywhere in
the Imperium. There could be dozens of reasons for any given shopping
restrictions (ie, TL) for classes of merchandise on a given world.
Reasons could be economic, industrial, political, military, educational,
astrographical, sociological, theological, or even sometimes (as the TL
tables themselves might suggest) historical.  I guess this particular
will have to be left to the referee as well.

Just for the record, the only innovations I\'ve liked since the demise of
"Classic" Traveller have been:
     1) MT personal combat--it finally made sense to be afraid if somebody
pointed a body pistol at you.  Far from perfect, but IMHO an improvement over
"Classic"
     2) Task system in general
     3) more detailled ship/vehicle design
     4) Hard Times--with MT, the TRAVELLER universe had begun to feel more
settled and certain.  What\'s the use of the scout service and ships\' sensors
when you can just pick up an atlas of the Imperium.  Hard Times made things
uncertain again, which was good.

5.  Wherever Traveller ends up, I think it will survive.  IMHO, it is
the only really good SF based gaming system around...

6.  Whoever picks up Traveller will be in a position to do
something I\'d really like to see..a divorce between the Traveller
game *system* and the Traveller game *history*.  Yes, yes I
know..so don\'t start flaming me!  <g> I realize that the detailed
history is what sets Traveller apart from everything else, so I\'m
not suggesting that we dump it.  Just that we sanction and
develop more than one!

What I\'d like to see is a general game system (that\'s what the
TNE rules were going to be, I think), and several Official
Histories.  Three that I can think of right now:  a. the Virus
collapsed history; b. the Rebellion induced Hard Times history; c.
the Classic Imperium where the Rebellion failed and no Virus was
ever released.  Maybe there could be other Histories that are
officially sanctioned and supported as well, but that are still
based on the Same System Of Rules.

Well that\'s my two cents anyway.

Eris Reddoch
----
I generally agree with Eris, except I\'d prefer some kind of threfold
division:  (1) TRAVELLER rules, (2) TRAVELLER setting, (3) TRAVELER history.
I liked the MT rules, but I liked the CT setting because it\'s so broad and
vague.  At the very beginning, there was a feeling that you could make it
almost any science-fiction setting you wanted.  As the years went on, and
library data piled up, the universe became much more certain and settled.  By
the time MT came out for example, you KNEW you wouldn\'t find Hivers running
around the Spinward Marches.  I felt I couldn\'t build my own planets or
subsectors, because I\'d be violating canon (even when I didn\'t have the
"canon" data).  Hard Times was a signifcant improvement because all of a
sudden, the universe was uncertain again and you could genuinely surprise
your players.

I accept most of what you have to say and agree with much of it.
However, I never said anything about equity or social justice. History has
shown that  the speed of development is often inversely related to equity of
distribution. In fact "Forced Saving" of one kind or another has been very
common in the development histories of many countries on Earth whether it is
imposed by an authoritarian regime or by the natural process of unregulated
free-market capitalism. History has shown that the speed of capital
accumulation and distribution equity are inversely related.

 Few people in developed countries really *understand* what

Mass starvation was a regular occurance in the history of the Soviet Union
and its cause was not just "extraordinary cold winters". Forced Saving - the
confiscation of food product to feed the workers in factories in towns and
cities in order to maintain production of manufactured goods - was the cause
of much starvation in rural areas. At the height of its development drive
the Soviet Union achieved (using comparable growth and development measures)
in 10 years what it had taken 60 years to achieve in the United States.
I don\'t believe in this kind of system but it makes my point that forced
sacrifice and saving are implicit in rapid development.

Having said all that, I accept that in many situations accumulated capital
would be channelled offworld and coreward as in the "enclave" type system
that some developing countries on Earth experienced. The more I think about
it, you are right in thinking that this sort of arrangement would be
widespread especially under the Imperium.

H&I wan neither more comprehensive nor better laid out than the Hiver Alien
Module from NE. It was, for the most part, merely a word for word copy with
snide remarks thrown in. what little was actually reworked (excluding
system mechanics stuff, including CGen) was LESS detailed, and less well
worded, IMNSHO. I wound up using my old CT module more than H&I.

As to someone else\'s comment about NE CGen vs CT/MT CGen:

I want to see the old system for 4 reasons:

1: It provides more detail about the character\'s hiostory (under Adv Gen),
something my players have always wanted/needed/used.

2: It is inherently faster than TNE, as there are fewer player decisions.

3: It produces more realistic, albeit more a problem with players,
characters; I have had TNE Characters doing in excess of 15d6 damage with a
non-critical punch.

4: It is easier for new players to assimilate. Many of my experienced
(decade or more) gamers had difficulty understanding, using, and working
with TNE. Nobody I know has had anywhere near the difficulties with CT/MT
in either basic or advanced generation.

5: I dislike TNE except for the streamlined task system. FF&S.

The Ithklur were mentioned in a passing (what, about a paragraph or so
of text) in the original Alien Module.  It did an excellent job of
relating everything from Hiver anatomy to history to thier current
position in TNE.  The character generation stuff fit in perfectly with
the stuff from the rulebook.

My guess is that the reason you despise it so is simply because of
it\'s nature as being a New Era product.  No, I take that back, I will
admit that many people may not have found any humor in the jokes that
were presented in the book.  But that still does not make it a poor
reference material.

: As to someone else\'s comment about NE CGen vs CT/MT CGen:
:
: I want to see the old system for 4 reasons:
:
: 1: It provides more detail about the character\'s hiostory (under Adv Gen),
: something my players have always wanted/needed/used.

Only for Army, Navy, Scout, and Merchant characters.  I find that
every character I\'ve ever created with the advanced system had similar
backgrounds.  I would rather just make it up myself.  Hmm, he\'s got
Zero-G skill as a merchant.  How about if he learned it while serving
on a TL 9 free trader?  You know stuff like that.  I find that
player\'s create an infinitely more interesting history than such
heavy-handed rules can.

Plus, in the old system, a character couldn\'t change careers.  That
never turned out to be too much of a problem with the basic character
generation, but it got to be impossible with the advanced character
generation.

: 2: It is inherently faster than TNE, as there are fewer player decisions.

As a roleplayer, I should probably be offended by the last remark.
Not for the time, but for that player crack.  Players like generating
quick characters, but they also like to have control over their
destinies.  As an aside, I created a character using the MT and TNE
rules.  A three term character who spent two terms as a scout and one
term as a merchant.  MT basic and TNE took about the same amount of
time (for MT I created both a three term scout and a two term/one term
scout/merchant).  This came out to about 12 minutes.  Not the quickest
character generation compared to some systems, but not the half-hour
most games expect you to put into creating a character.

: 3: It produces more realistic, albeit more a problem with players,
: characters; I have had TNE Characters doing in excess of 15d6 damage with a

Uhm, I think those are the combat rules that you have a real problem
with.  The way derived values like HTH damage and the like are handled
aren\'t really caused by the character creation rules so much as they\'re
affected by the combat rules.

The problem I see here is that you\'re saying it\'s hard for all the
old-time player who don\'t want to adapt to something new?  Or is it
something else?  I was the first to blast (and blast hard) at the
changes that were made between MT and TNE.  I though "house system,
bah!"  But I actually gave it a chance.  I found lots of things that I
liked.  Granted, I also found lots of things that I didn\'t like.

: 5: I dislike TNE except for the streamlined task system. FF&S.

Wil, I think what you really mean to say is that you dislike the TNE
storyline.  I will agree with you that FFS is a fantastic product!
And I will give kudos to the task system even though I liked MT\'s very
much.

        download the software to get started playing right away.  

        MPG-Net Showcase consists of the Win95 System Access Software (SAS)
        and Win95 frontends of our games.  The frontends are free to download
        from the web site.  All you need to play is machine capable of running
        Win95 (486/33 8mb RAM) and access to the Internet via Winsock.  A
        Pentium with 16 mb of RAM is suggested.

        The games that are currently on line include:
     
              * The Kingdom of Drakkar -- Fantasy Role Playing, quests, etc.
              * Empire Builder -- Based on the Mayfair Game, you and upto five
                others try to build a nation spanning rail-road system.
              * Minion Hunter -- Based on the GDW board game, which is based
                on Dark Conspiracy, you and upto five others work together to
                fend of the Dark Minions and their quest to take over the world.
              * Operation: Market-Garden -- Based on the GDW board game, you 
                command troops on either the Axis or Allied sides as you try
                your hand at the largest Airborne operation of WWII.
              * Imperium -- Based on the GDW board game, which is based on
                Traveller, you go head to head against another to control 
                space near Terra/Sol.

        So check out the web page, read about the games, and give MPG-Net 
        Showcase a spin!!!  You get five free hours to try it out.  After
        that, the rate is $2.00 US an hour to play. 

Wew, that was painless.  Any way, for you Imperium fans, we do have Imperium
on line.  Also, I will probably be starting up a Classic Traveller Online
game in 
the next few weeks.  I hope to use the web to distribute maps, text, and other
information, and MPG-Net Showcase\'s conference rooms to conduct the sessions.

Again sorry for the blatent commericalisam, but they are nice enough to give us
this list!!!

I did a 5x5x5 grid subsector map at one point.
That is, in my final analysis, the wrong size.
The primary "wrongness" is that you can jump past
the next subsector over in any direction with a
J-6 starship; that mandates 6x6x6 subsector maps.
I strongly suggest no larger; 6x6x6 with about 1/2"
hexes is as large as you can put on a 8.5x11 sheet
of paper without much in the way of other info.

Btw, the mapping convention I use within these
subsectors is a set of xy planes, and the hex numbering
is zxy.  Seems easiest to translate ("level-column-row").

I will make my prototype maps available if people want.

The next step up, sectors, domains etc., those are
interesting questions.  That depends on how masochistic
you are... I assumed that sectors were 2x2x2 subsectors
(8), because 3x3x3 is 27 and they\'re *big* subsectors,
216 hexes instead of 80.  2x2x2 keeps things more manageable
for smaller descriptions.  At existing "densities" per hex,
you\'d end up with 300-600 worlds per "sector" at 2x2x2;
3x3x3 would be 1000-2000.  Much less manageable.

Finally, as a note of caution, I do not suggest anyone
trying to retrofit 3D to the existing Traveller universe.
Works nice in a home-cooked campaign, but the Imperial
background translates very poorly.

	Which, of course, shouldn\'t be the case.  Considering that the 
average jump-6 capable ship is far more costly than the average jump-1 
capable ship, the shipper should be charging more based on his costs of 
doing business.  Besides, s/he could obviously get more for the service, 
since jump-6 is 6 times as fast as jump-1 (assuming you are shipping 
something 6 parsecs away).

Well, I have, actually ... through ex-students I keep in contact with and with
the younger members (90%) of the games club I am president of. And they have no
belief in the above statement, either. But, more on this below.

Yes, I may well be falling into that trap. But I probably didn\'t express the
"theory" in question very well, either ... the idea is that the kids I teach
now will be *forced* to change their jobs several times because the jobs that
they have will be rendered obsolete. This is, to me, dubious.

Let me give several examples -

1) When I started teaching 20 years ago, we were still using Gestetner (Roneo to
you NorAm types?) ink duplicators and Fordigraph spirit stencil duplicators, no
computers at all, videos (if available) on 1/2" reel-to-reel tapes, and the
like. Now? Well, computers are more common, videos are VHS types, and
Photocopiers have *completely* replaced all the previous duplicators. But, as
for the actual *job*, apart from the usual fad changes in regulatory
requirements (which, take it from me, are mostly given lip service while we get
on with what actually *works*) and administrivia, it\'s virtually identical (no,
I\'ll go further, it\'s *completely* identical). I see no developments that are
in line now or in the near future that will change the core job that I do.

And I\'d go as far as to say (as I did recently) that teaching will be pretty
much the same in the world of the Imperium, too. Lots of extra you-beaut *aids*
to make you more effective, but the core job will probably be the same.

2) One of my ex-students went into Nursing and she\'s doing quite well - and
intends to be a Nurse for the rest of her working life. Her mother\'s a nurse as
well and, though she made the point that she\'s had to adapt to many changes in
the thirty years she\'s been doing the job, she\'s still doing the same basic job
she did 30 years ago. Sure, the tech has changed, and made the job easier, but
the basic job is the same ... and she developed the skills to use all that new

I use the Preserve Maximum Linear Distance (PMLD)
assumption.  If you look at an (8x10) standard 2D subsector, then to
PMLD within the subsector (12.8 parsecs) then the nearest you can get
is a cube with 7 parsec sides.
 ----

I have a 3D hex based system. Odd numbers of hexes are bad for mapping 
because you need more than one type of map to represent them.

 ----
  Sectors are then cubes with four subsectors on a side
(inkeeping with PMLD), and Domains are cubes with two sectors on a
side.  If you take "standard" density as 40 worlds per subsector
(ie. 50% of 8x10 2D subsectors) then in 3D standard density is a 12%
chance of there being a world in a given cubic parsec.
 ----

Your sector is 4 times bigger and your domain is 2 times bigger.
I use a 6 parsec a side subsector.
Also I use an 8% (1 in 12; 11+ on 2d6) chance of a system.
A Sector is 3 subsectors a side, a Domain 2 sectors a side like yours.
It looks a bit sparse (18 systems in a subsector) but the number of 
subsectors in a sector and sectors in a domain quickly bring it up to the 
numbers we\'ve come to expect.

 ----
I\'ve even come up with a mapping grid - 2 x 4 boxes, 7 parsecs on a
side, with the eighth box containing the map legend.
 ----

I have a system that allows 3 layers to be represented on one 2D page.

It works by assuming that each hex has the vertex of 3 hexes above and below 
it over the centre of the hex.
Hexes are adjacent to 6 other hexes in the same plane, 3 above and 3 below.

The "above" information is printed at every second vertex of a hex and the 
"below" information on every alternate one.

This system is unfortunately NOT symetrical. There are two ways it can work.
Just like proteins etc... ;)

I have the convention that "above" is to the right and "below" is to the 
left.
ie. (A = above B= below C= centre)

     C
   \\   /
 C  A-B  C
   /   \\
 --B  C  A--
   \\   /
 C  A-B  C
   /   \\
     C

Is a distance of 1.4 parsecs jump-1 or jump-2?
 ----

Not a problem if you use my system. ;)

The existence of low-tech worlds within the Imperium is not necessarily
paradoxical - look at the spread of technology here on Terra.  I find it
important not to go down the line of saying that a world is TL5, therefore
everything on it is also TL5.  I\'m sure that the wealthy and the privileged
on lower tech planets will import higher tech items.  Off-world industrial
concerns or governments may well become involved in building
projects above the local TL.  Look at the involvement of the Soviet
Union in the building of the Aswan Dam.  These arrangements also
set up plenty of opportunities for adventure: political intrigues, bribery,
sabotage etc etc..  I regard TL as being an expression of the average
production capacity of a world.  Technology does not always even
out.  I am writing this on a sophisticated personal computer, and you
will be reading it via an enormous computer network.  A few thousand
miles away people are starving and have no access to clean water.

Many of the \'poorest\' (=lower tech) peripheral societies on earth are not
colonial properties of  the core states (at least, not physically...). It is
often not in the interest of a more technologically advanced state or
world to physically take over and administer a less advanced one. It
is far more profitable to maintain the technological differentiation, which
generally enables the more advanced state to import raw materials
and labour (or export dangerous/dirty production and waste) from the
less advanced state cheaply, and export sophisticated finished
technological products which are more expensive.

Historically, higher tech nations have, as you write, exploited those less
advanced than themselves, but they do not need to physically invade,
subjugate and garrison a planet to do it.  I find it quite convincing that
lower tech planets exist within the Imperium, and I am sure that most
higher tech planets would be pleased to keep them that way.

Besides, it allows players who harbour secret AD&D urges to whip out
their swords and fight the evil minions of King Zog and his army ;-)

projects above the local TL.  Look at the involvement of the Soviet
Union in the building of the Aswan Dam.  These arrangements also
set up plenty of opportunities for adventure: political intrigues, bribery,
sabotage etc etc..  I regard TL as being an expression of the average
production capacity of a world.  Technology does not always even
out.  I am writing this on a sophisticated personal computer, and you
will be reading it via an enormous computer network.  A few thousand
miles away people are starving and have no access to clean water.

Many of the \'poorest\' (=lower tech) peripheral societies on earth are not
colonial properties of  the core states (at least, not physically...). It is
often not in the interest of a more technologically advanced state or
world to physically take over and administer a less advanced one. It
is far more profitable to maintain the technological differentiation, which
generally enables the more advanced state to import raw materials
and labour (or export dangerous/dirty production and waste) from the
less advanced state cheaply, and export sophisticated finished
technological products which are more expensive.

Historically, higher tech nations have, as you write, exploited those less
advanced than themselves, but they do not need to physically invade,
subjugate and garrison a planet to do it.  I find it quite convincing that
lower tech planets exist within the Imperium, and I am sure that most
higher tech planets would be pleased to keep them that way.

Besides, it allows players who harbour secret AD&D urges to whip out
their swords and fight the evil minions of King Zog and his army ;-)

There seems to be little impulse in the Imperium to direct or promote the
"development" of planets either technologicly or politicly.  That means that
having, through some circumstance or other arrived at a low technology, a
world is going to stay there unless it has something to offer the
interstellar community to encourage development (either because planetary
authorities want it or because  suits the corporations)

Look at the amazon basin.  Individuals have been leaving the Indian cultures
and returning to them since European colonization began, but the only reason
that the area is being dragged into the twentieth century is that the
dominant culture in the area wants the resources.  Otherwise, they would
have been left in the stone age.

Even if free traders visit a tech 4 world occasionally and trade machine gun
ammunition for dragon steaks, this is probably not going to make a change in
they way most people think, and so in the way they live, or the core technology.

About a year and a half ago Glenn Coffin quoted something out of Starship
Operator\'s manual about jumpspace. Unfortunately, I do not have that book 
nor can I find it so I would like to ask if anyone could look up some more
information in the book. 

1. What happens if the jump drive turns off in jump space? Will the strange
physics rip the ship apart instantly or will the crew have time to do
anything about it? 

2. If a ship manages to make the right rolls and engage the drive from on
planet, how much of the surrounding area will be drawn into jump space with 
the ship?

Hi,

I\'ve written a Traveller alien word generator for Windows 3.1 and above. It can
create Vilani, Aslan, Vargr, Droyne, and Zhodani words and save them to a file.
I\'m looking for a good place to upload this for Traveller players. I\'m fairly
novice at using the web and internet, so any help would be appreciated. Is there
anything special I need to know about uploading? Thanks in advance for any help.

 Joe, this seems pretty usable and well-thought out, at least at
 first glance.  You\'ve omitted something, though:

 Skill degradation.  Unless a person is one of those rare
 individuals with a near-eiditic memory, skills that aren\'t used
 will degrade.

 I\'d consider something like this (off the top of my head; probably
 needs tweaking):

 [NOTE: I\'m assuming the existence of a task system not dissimilar
 to the MT task system - translate as needed]

 If a skill isn\'t used at all within 180 game days, the character
 has effectively lost one level of that skill (never dropping below
 0).  However, if the skill is used as you describe above for an
 adventure upgrade within a year (of the beginning of the 180-day
 period), the "increase" back to the "original" skill level is done
 with an "easy" roll, _plus_ the increase _above_ the original
 skill level can be taken, but at one difficulty level higher than
 normal.  If the skill isn\'t used at all within a year, it is
 "permanently" lost, and can only be increased back to "normal"
 using your procedure unmodified.

Sure. The reason is that the *product* is still the same. The same goes
for the Nurse example, the plumber and the carpenter. As well as
doctors and lawyers. The "product" isn\'t going to change substantail,
nor are the "raw materials. The tools are improving. So are the
techniques (though *very* slowly in some fields).

Actually, scribes still exist. They just do *custom* work now. An
interesting example is a monastery in New Mexico of an order that was
long reknowned for the talents of its scribes. They now have people
designing web pages, and doing hand illuminated art to be scanned in as
part of them!

The jump drive doesn\'t turn off prematurely, as the hull grid is =

Making the jump to jump space includes creating a jump field bubble =
around the ship. That bubble normally extends approximately 1 meter from =
the ship, so I guess that a meter of the surrounding area will be drawn =
with the ship (not into jump space, but transported with the ship to =
it\'s new location).

What was the international law of salvage in the 18th Century?  That\'s where
your answer lies, I think.  Normally, a ship with nothing living on it
belonged to whoever found it (this was one reason for having a ship\'s dog,
or so my father says).  I don\'t know if this applied to a ship belonging to
the sovereign.

As a practical matter, because the ship is three hundred years old, the
Imperial Navy may no longer want it.  They (specifically Naval Intelligence
and the office of naval history) will probably want to debrief the ship --
backup the log, physically inspect the ship, inter and record any bodies
properly, etc. -- but they\'re not putting it back into service.   So perhaps
the opportunity to debrief will be sufficient consideration for the Navy to
let the players keep the ship.  After all, without the players, the Navy
would never have learned of the ship.  

Information is, in my view, the most important thing aboard that ship --
both formally recorded information like the log, and facts that can be
deduced from inspection and analysis.

>And what equipment would be aboard?

Gosh, what an opportunity for the referee to go totally nuts!  Now the
difference in equipment between Imperial 800 and 1100 is not nearly so great
as between 2000 A.D. and 1700 A.D., but still I think that I would use that
as a guide.  "Hey, check this out -- a _keyboard_ at the helm station,"
e.g., and plenty of "what did they use _this_ tool for?"  Surely there will
be some 300-year old viruses in the air ducts to give the PCs nasty colds or
worse.  There will be some odd, non-compatible equipment, like an 8.8 mm
pistol, or holocrystals that are the wrong size for readers.

Not exactly.  Each system has an independent mass and volume, the volume
having to be accomidated within the hull volume (more or less).  The
traveller "displacement tonnage" is the volume in m^3/14.  Traveller tonnage
is a measure of volume, not mass.

Although "tons" were used to evaluate the capacity of a standard hull to
contain components in the 1st edition black books, no means were provided to
translate from that measure to any other standard unit.  The first time I
saw 1 ton = 14 m^3 was in an ealy book of deck plans (traders and gunboats,
perhaps) where some standard has to be found for establishing volume, and so
the volume of one metric ton of hydrogen fuel was taken as a standard.  I am
not sure when actual mass was added to ship design (as opposed to other
systems covered in striker 1).  Was it part of Megatraveller, or did it come
in with FF&S?

Well, water is 1 tonnes per m^3.

Mass and volume are tracked seperately.

Why not? Take a 4,000 tonne destroyer and accelerate it at one G, and you
will be consuming about 200MW (if my calculations are not completely off)

remember that a starships weapons are also powered by the reactor.  If you
took the energy produced by, say, the main power plant on the Iowa, and
added the power produced by the powder charge when each gun fires, and the
power produced by the engine on each tomahawk, and -- you get the idea.

The the Iowa is operating at ranges measure in hundres of km, not tens of
thousands.

A ticondaroga\'s main engines (displacement 9,600 tons -- that\'s mass, not
volume) generates 80,000 shaft horsepower.  Now 80,000 hp is about 60MW
(although the definition of "shaft hp" might make the conversion a bit
different). The Kennedy class CV (82,000 tons displacement) generates
280,000 hp  - 208MW.

Remember, that\'s mot all electricity -- most of that power is produced and
used mechanically -- but its still power.

The Watt is a unit of power.  Use 1000 Watts for an hour, and you have
consumed one kiolwatt-hour of energy.  

Electricly, one watt = 1 volt * 1 amp.

According to Starship Oporators Manual (IIRC), the Jump Drive requires a
trickle charge during operation.  Cancel this charge and the Jump Bubble
integrity would fail and the ship would emerge from Jumpspace.  Where and
when, I don\'t know, but it can\'t be along the route and less than one week,
because this would mean a highly skilled Astrogator could perform minijumps
(ie from GG to MW) in less than a week.

Nothing, so long as the hull grid remains intact.

About 1 meter from the hull, maybe 2-3m, but not more. Enough to make a

Above assumes the Hull grid jump drives postulated in SSOMv1, not the Field

	Subject: Starship construction under different gaming systems....

Steven:
	[deletions...]     
     Also, another question related to CT/MT power plants...why do these 
     craft require so many MW of power???  IM not an educated 
     physicist-type as you can tell, but I know that approx. 515MW is equal 
     to about .1% of USA\'s annual power needs.  Some large MT warships use 

Me: (nitpicking ;) The megawatt (MW) is a unit of energy per unit time; it
is 1 million Joules per second. Power (in technical jargon) means energy
over time. So technically, one cannot talk of an annual POWER need; you
can only talk of an annual ENERGY need. This is the same thing as a
power need. (No "annual!")

Steven:
     to about .1% of USA\'s annual power needs.  Some large MT warships use 
     540 billion watts and some smaller 400 ton craft use almost 1 billion 
     watts!!!!  In 2300AD, some of the larger ships require 150 to 300 MW.  
     Realistically, does all this make sense??  I can understand that a 
     jump drive would require sufficient energy, but the other ship systems 
     shouldn\'t require more than 50 MW on even the largest 
     starships....help!!  How many MW of energy does an wet-navy aircraft 
     carrier, nuclear sub, or cruiser produce currently???
     
Me: (trying to be helpful this time 8^) Traveller starships, which
weigh thousands of tons and accellerate at tens of meters per
second-squared, use up tremendous amounts of power, much more than a wet
navy aircraft carrier which will rarely go faster than about 50 knots.

I\'m not a rocket scientist, but I do recall my freshman physics pretty
well, so I\'ll try to calculate the Power output of the engine of a
vessel massing 100 tons (M = 100,000 kg) and accellerating at 1 gee (a =
10 m/s^2). If I get it wrong, maybe one of our rocket scientists can
correct me! 8^) (Are you still out there, Steve Higginbotham or George
William Herbert?)

My calculation for the power plant output (in watts) is
relativisitically:

P = sqrt(F^2 * c^2 + R^2 * c^4)  -  R * c^2

where P is the power in watts; F = M*a = (100,000 kg)*(10m/s^2) is the
force of the starship\'s drive, in our case, one million Newtons (10^6
N); and c is the speed of light, c = 3 * 10^8 m/s. R is the rate of mass
ejected out of the ship\'s rocket, in kilograms per second.

If we use some sort of "field" drive, that is, if we use massless
particles for the rocket ejectiles, R equals zero and our formula
becomes:

P = F * c

So our 100 ton ship\'s power plant is rated at (10^6 N)*(3*10^8 m/s) =
3 * 10^14 W = 3*10^8 MW. That\'s 30 million megawatts!

If we use a more normal non-relativistic rocket with real mass shooting
out the back of it, we can simplify the equation to:

P = F^2 / (2 * R)

Here, the power you need depends on how much mass you shoot out the
back. If you use 100 kg/second, the power you need is 5 gigawatts.
That\'s five billion watts to us Americans, 5000 million to everyone
else.

If you use a thousand kilograms per second instead of a hundred, you
cut your power requirement by ten to 500 MW. Note, however, that
our one-hundred-thousand kilogram ship is unlikely to kick out
mass at one thousand kilograms per second for too very long!

Note also that this is for a perfect, 100% efficient rocket motor.  An
inefficient motor would need more power. So it seems to me that the
power plant outputs in Travller are unphysically low.

Steven:
     And also, over what time period does the reactor output this energy??? 
      Is this a per/kw hour type figure??  How many volts in 1 MW???
     
Me: This is related to the nit I picked in the first paragraph (which is
why I picked it! 8^) A megawatt, like a kilowatt (or even a lowly watt)
is a unit of energy over time. So our five hundred megawatt reactor
produces 500 million joules per second. A kilowatt-hour is equal to
(1000 Watts)*(3600 seconds) = 3.6 million joules. So our 500 MW is about
140 kilowatt-hours PER SECOND.

There are a million WATTS in 1 MW. The VOLT is not a measure of power.
So I guess the nearest possible answer to your question "How many volts
in 1 MW???" is: 120 in North America, 240 in Europe! 8^)

Just kidding! I\'m glad you asked; it\'s good to see that I\'m not the only
guy who wonders about this stuff!

Please E-mail me directly to get a copy of my derivation of the
above formulas.

     It is felt by this author that the basic character of the

So, the following system is set out for your perusal.  This is
intended to be used to create both NPCs and PCs, in conjunction
with GDW\'s Traveller rules system.

Choosing Associates

     In the Far Future, mining is done by three different groups:
Companies (which includes governments), Informal Groups, and
Individuals.  The amount of risk entailed varies inversely with
the number of people who are engaged in the task.  Woe betide the
poor person who decides to strike it out on his own.  However,
individual profits for any given strike also vary inversely with
the number of people involved, and thus directly with the amount
of risk (as with any investment).
     A beginning character may enlist in any of the different
types of organizations.  The required enlistment roll for
Company or Group prospecting represents the chance that the
character is accepted.  The enlistment roll for individuals is to
determine whether a patron is acquired.  A patron is necessary
for one-person expeditions in order to cover initial expenses.
The patron then gets a share of any profits.


Initial Activities

     Initial activities include the following:
     Characteristics:  Roll 2D for each of the six
characteristics and record the rolls on a sheet of paper.
     Age:  The character begins at age 18.


                       Beginning the Career

Enlistment:  Characters begin their career by jointing the Belter
organization of their choice.  They may either join a mining
corporation, a small group of individuals, or they may opt to go
it alone.  In each of these instances, the base enlistment roll is
different, but the die modifiers are the same.  These numbers are
given in the tables section of this article.
     Prospecting corporations are owned by their shareholders, the
government, or a combination of both.  On the other hand, informal
groups are a small to moderate sized group of individuals who have
joined together and pooled their resources in order to gain a

1) Lower the cost of fusion reactors with increasing TL:

TL 9: normal price (200,000 Cr/Kl)

TL 11:  50,000 Cr/Kl

TL 12-13: 30,000 Cr/Kl
 
TL 14-16: 20,000 Cr/Kl

Computers are amazingly overpriced: Try

Price modifiers:

TL 5 x 1000

TL 6-7 x 100

TL 8 x 10

TL 9 x 5

TL 10 x 2

5         100,000 Cr

6         120,000 Cr
 etc...

Finally, lower the cost of the Low Power Hi-Grav plates  		

TL 10: 25,000 Cr

TL 12: 15,000 Cr

TL 13: 10,000 Cr


I\'ve played around with these and they produce much more reasonable 
results than the existing system.

I also reduce the volume and mass of all computers:

TL 9 x 0.5

TL 10 x 0.2

TL 11 x 0.05

TL 12 x 0.02

TL 13 + x 0.01

It was pointed out recently on this mailing list that there were some 
very important details left out of the previously-released Pirates 
class.  What follows is the corrected version.  
I\'m sorry about letting that slip through.
(And I\'d still like constructive criticism of this system.  If you use it 
and find that something doesn\'t work as well as it should, figure 
out a way to make it work and send me your solution.  Or, if you

telling me what you have found wrong with it.)
=========
                         Pirates of Space

     In Traveller, Pirates play a big part in everyday space life.
The Imperium and the other governments are always on the lookout
for this, the scourge of space.  The pirates are
outlaws who have taken to attacking and plundering honest ships,
most especially traders.  As trade is the lifeblood of all
governments throughout space, pirates tend to be the most hated of
all criminals.
     It is rare, however, that a pirate will attack government-
owned ships.  Nor will they routinely attack ships bearing the
insignia of one of the Mega Corporations.  Both of these
activities are much too risky for the average pirate.
     Pirates generally focus the thrust of their activities on
free traders and small merchant companies.  These ships yield the
best profit to risk ratio.
     This article deals with creating a character who is a member
of this "underground" organization.  It presents a step-by-step
process of fleshing out a complete Pirate character in the
tradition of Mercenary, High Guard and Scouts (q.v.).


                    Character Creation Process

     First, create the basic Traveller character by throwing 2D
for each of the six characteristics (Strength, Dexterity,
Endurance, Intelligence, Education and Social Standing), noting
the scores on a sheet of paper.
     The second step is to make the enlistment throw.  A throw of
7+ is required, with a +1 DM for a Social Standing score of 7- and
a +2 DM for Endurance 9+.
     Next, determine the type of organization the character is
joining.  Roll 2D6: two through five results in a Solitary Ship
Group, meaning that it is a relatively small organization, with
only one ship, probably hovering near one major world in a system;
six through nine results in the character being part of a small
group of ships, probably preying only on those who venture into
its\' two-or three-parsec territory; ten through twelve results in
being accepted into an Organized Crime ring, which may be as big
as a subsector, a sector, or even larger.  Whichever organization
is determined is used for the entire career.
     Fourth, determine where the character is stationed.  A roll
(1D) of one through five results in the character being on a ship
for the term.  A roll of six means the character has been caught,
and will spend the term in Prison, thereafter being mustered out
of the Pirates.  Stationing is only rolled at the beginning of
each term.
     During each year of the term, rolls will be made on the
appropriate assignment determination table.  Once the assignment

The ship will be brought up before a court who will determine its status
(salvage or rescue) based on the circumstances. Basically it was salvage
if there were no _crewmember_ (or other representative of the owner) aboard,
otherwise it was rescue. The difference lay in how big a percentage of the
value of ship and cargo the salvagers/rescuers were awarded. I don\'t know
the specifics, but with salvage the owner might easily be forced to sell
the ship to cover the award.

the Navy would never have learned of the ship.  

Organizations don\'t work that way. If anyone can establish title to the
ship they\'ll pay what the law requires of them and not a credit more.
The best the PCs can expect above that is some goodwill.

Actually, I like the RICE paper ideas, and hope that Jeff will

Actually, WTH is (or rather was) a GDW product for TNE.  It was at 
least partially based on DGP\'s World Builder\'s Handbook which was 
designed for MT.

My vote would also be for this solution. Like Joe Walsh I also subscribed
to the TNE list in digest format, unlike him I cancelled my subscription
to it...

Just a couple of thoughts I would like to pass around.  You know, things I
thought you should know kinda stuff.

First, we will probably be moving the mailing list from our offices in New
York to our offices in Key West.  This could happen as early as today.  For
you, it should be pretty transparent.  We are going to switch to majordomo
as part of the change.  We will probably alias listproc to go to the right
place for subscribe/signoff commands.  Certain commands such as SET MAIL ACK
and stuff
wont work.  You will still use traveller@mpgn.com and xboat@mpgn.com to
communicate with the list.

Because of this, and the fact that we are busy with all these equipment
moves, I have not processed any address changes or other administrative
requests in several days.  I will probably clean these up during the
transition between servers.

With regards to what to do with the lists.  Alot of what to do with the list
depends on what actually comes out of the new Traveller system and the
reason for Xboat in the first place.

Regardless, "Traveller" will be to discuss the game in all forms, and will
naturally discuss the current shipping products.  Call it evolution, or what
ever.  Thats the purpose of the list, and that is not going to change.

Xboat was created for the refugees from Classic Traveller that felt that the
current Traveller was not for them.  If the new Traveller brings the Classic
Traveller\'s back into the mainstream, then Xboat\'s mission is less
important.  Probably though, the TNE exiles will need a home.  Xboat\'s
charter could be changed, but I would be inclined to leave Xboat alone, and

It was made by FASA back in 1982 and plays somewhat like GWs BloodBowl.  The
miniatures provided with the game were only 15mm so the game isn\'t nearly as
nice to look at compared to BloodBowl (but it didn\'t cost as much either).

Game play alternates between (human) players, beginning with the (G-Ball) player
in possession of the ball.  Each G-Ball player is assigned a postion (forwards,
halfbacks, fullbacks, and a goalie) and has a number of action points (similar
to SnapShot).  Actions include movement, reorientation, passing, shooting,
checking, striking, etc.  Scoring and blocking depend quite abit on the armour
worn by each player (according to his position).  Players can be disorientated,
stunned, or incapacitated by sucessful strikes or if hit by the ball (either by
accident or on purpose), although illegal actions may result in penalties
(entering and exiting the "field" just like Eric Lindros).  Rules for rebounding
shots are included, as well as automated rules for an equally automated (ie:
robotic) referee.

Its just lying around my basement but if you want it, give me an offer....

    'body' => 'According to the canon, the Vilani are humans transplanted to Vland by the
Ancients. I was recently giving some thought to the implications of this
assertion.

I assume that the ancestral Vilani were modern humans, Homo Sapiens. I,ve
forgotten when Homo sapiens first evolved but the figure 50,000 years ago
springs to mind so this is the earliest date for the transplantation.

Here are the issues that the transplantation raises:

        1.  What effect would the transplantation have on the subsequent
            development of the Vilani?  For example, do they have any ancient
            tradition that states that Vland is not really their home?  Do they
            have any religious tradition that refers to the Ancients?

        2.  How did the Vilani react upon encountering the Terrans and
            presumably getting incontravertable evidence that Vland wasn\'t their
            original home?

        3.  In my campaigns I rule that alien plants and animals (if these
terms             can properly apply to alien life) are inedible to humans.
If this
            rule applies in general then the Ancients must have also
transplanted a large subset of the terran biota to Vland in order to
recreate the complex interactions of the terrestrial ecology.  This
            does not imply carrying actual biological samples: at TL20 I\'m sure
            the Ancients could simply carry an electronic record of plant and
            animal DNA to their project site at Vland and regenerate examples
            at will.  Global terraforming is listed at TL16 in TNE: kids\' stuff
            for the Ancients.

        4.  By TL4, Vilani biologists would be getting confused about how life
            developed.  Without a fossil record they might conclude that species
            do not develop with time.  By TL6 the problem would be compounded by
            the discovery that some species are genetically related: how can
this be if they do not share a common ancestor?

        5.  By TL10 the discovery of other (minor) humans races would cause
            even more confusion.

Obviously, the same questions apply to Zhodane and the Vargr homeworld.  

I know its not a vital roleplaying issue, but its fun to think about! Does
anyone else have any thoughts on the subject?

  The first two questions are very closely related here. A number of
well argued subjects are listed in the FAQ at
http://www.spirit.com.au/~jamesd/tml-faq.html. You could also add to this
collection any TNE/MT/CT/NT is better than TNE/MT/CT/NT sort of statement.

  The latest with NT (or T4) is that it is still scheduled for release at
Gencon (August), or at least as far as I have heard.

  Hope that helps.

Current sea-law also states that a major component of salvage/rescue is
the assistance rendered.   If you (in the distressed vessel) throw the
assisting vessel a line, that\'s rescue.   If you accept a line thrown
aboard from the assisting vessel, that\'s salvage, and the stakes change.

Hi folks

I\'m writing a scenario (that I expect will turn into a
campaign) set on the world of Arden in the
Spinward Marches.

I would like to try and keep this material within the
existing canon as far as possible.  I have consulted
all the sources that I have at my disposal (Spinward
Marches, Library data, Regency Sourcebook)
that at least cover the area.  I was wondering if any
of you knew of any information relating specifically
to Arden that exists outside of these?  I\'m referring
to anything from scenarios to snippets of information
about names of cities etc. (pref. 1110 or earlier)

If you know of anything I\'d be grateful if you could
e-mail me with the name of the publication so I can
try and track it down (or if it\'s only a little bit of info,
perhaps you could just let me know what it is...)
Thanks a lot.

By the way, in all the discussion about new lists and
names for the new incarnation of Traveller, and in the
light of the ongoing CT/TNE schism,  I\'m surprised
that nobody\'s mentioned:

Traveller 4: The Empire Strikes Back ....
;-)

Cheers

Iain

The following is very paraphrased and occasionally quoted from DGP\'s 
Vilani & Vargr, about the only big source of info on the Vilani.

The early civilization of the Vilani was not only shaped by, but 
defined by the transplant to Vland.  

"While our homeworld of Vland was quite hospitable, we were not from 
this world, making it difficult to digest and metabolize Vland\'s 
proteins, sugars, and amino acids."

The early Vilani culture was shaped by the Ancients who taught the 
Shiguli how to process food for consumption by humans.  

"The Shiguli ultimately developed hundreds of "mystical" food conversion 
techniques, and became looked upon more as a shaman than as a cook." 
 
The Shiguli, along with the inevitable aristocrat, would make a 
pretty good ruling class.

Early Vilani culture, and in particular their less than trusting 
views of technological advances for its own sake were also shaped by 
the Ancients.

"Several of our legends tell of explorers finding great living 
stone-metal gods with enormous magical powers."

The gods were large war machines that were leftovers of the Final 
War.  They pretty much kept the Vilani humans hiding in the hills 
until they wore down.  Indeed, early civilization revolved around the 
discovery of these machines.    

I\'d bet they had a big effect.  Certainly they had a lot of effects 
on them culturally.

Remember there was a large span of time between these two events.  
The Terrans stumbled across the Vilani Empire in -2422 I.E.  The 
SolomanI Hypothesis (which theorized Terra/Sol, as the origin world 
of all humans) did not occur until 114 I.E.  Probably didn\'t have 
quite the effect it would have had if the 2 events were concurrent, 
especially since both branches were being effectively ruled by the 
Syleans at the time.  Later, when the Solomani became more militant, 
I\'m sure it played a big part.

If you\'re to believe "canon", the Ancients just taught them how to 
adapt the native life...  See the Shiguli comments above.

It\'d be a good adventure idea just to see how it would play out.  I 
agree here.

I agree.  The best part of Traveller is the fact that it has such a 
wonderfully fleshed out background.  Makes it possible to ponder such 
ideas.

Try Second Games Galore on 01234-823873. He doesn\'t have a copy in stock at 
the moment (I went through his stock pretty thoroughly on Sunday), but he 
has a fairly good turnover, so I\'m sure one is bound to turn up.

The other thing he does is he runs a club (Gamer\'s Discount Club), where you 
get 10% off his prices, you get first dibs on stock that comes in (most of 
the rare stuff doesn\'t even make it on to the mailing list!), and he has a 
gamesearch facility, where you tell him what your looking for, he puts the 
word around and if he finds it, he offers it to you first. The subscription 
is something like 15 pounds a year.

Good luck with your search.

Hm. I keep hearing murmurings about there being giant dead robot warmachines
littered over the surface of vland. Presumably they have some sort
of tradition built around this...

The "incontrovertable" evidence was not even presented as a hypotheses until
the Third Imperium I believe... the Haut-Devroe Hypothesis I think it\'s called.
Since the Vilani had discovered human races before, there was no reason to think
(from their point of view) that Terrans were any different.

Again, I think that basically, most life on Vland _is inedible_ to the Vilani.
They must go through an elaborate purification process to make the food edible.
This "food producer" caste rose to hold great power in Vilani society.
(There\'s a Vilani term for them... Shughsisi ?? I have no idea)

The Vilani took little interest in such matters, focusing on commerce and empire-building.
Basic science took very little of their collective interest.

Zhdant (Zhodane ?) is a much "milder" case - it seems much more like a world
where humans might have evolved. Also, a lot of Zhdant is, again, Ancient ruins,
which sort of muddles questions that involve pre-history.

THere isn\'t much written about the Vargr homeworld Lair, except that it holds
little if any space in the hearts of Vargr as being special.

Basically, almost everyone simply ignores these problems! To us Terrans, it seems
like a big deal, but things like paleontology are actually a worthwhile pursuit
here on Earth - imagine the first Vilani paleontologist. _Frustrating_! Besides,
if you think Terran scientists are unappreciated, Vilani culture apparently values
them even lower...

(How do I know this? I\'m not sure... Gotta start keeping my Trav books here at work...)

 I fully intend to continue the concept, though almost certainly
 under a different, milieu-appropriate name.  I will emphasize,
 though, that I am _not_ the only one allowed to write these
 things; in fact, I encourage others to follow the format and write
 their own - Traveller in any incarnation is nobody\'s private
 stomping ground; we can all share in all of what\'s there, and we
 can all add to it.

 What we write today can be tomorrow\'s Traveller Library Data
 Network On-line.  Isn\'t a shared universe a nifty concept?

Continuing with Joe\'s "first time I laid eyes on it" thread:

Pretty boring for us:  we stated playing Starfleet Wars at school at 
lunch.  Then a friend of mine brought in Traveller and we started 
playing that.  Yes we were young and foolish (one of my favorite things
to do was to go to planets which had just achieved nuclear power and
blast them from orbit.  Doning Vacc Suits I would decend to the planet\'s 
now radioactive surface and relieve it of its precious metals........
ah young, foolish, and not knowing any better.)  From this humble beginning
we proceded to get more into the spirit of Traveller--to the point where
we looked with distain upon my friend\'s little sister\'s adventure (she so
wanted to play) which consisted of wave after wave of nasties until
finally all the PC were dead and which point she said "I won".

In the end however we finally worked out how role playing was supposed
to work and despite our shakey start I have been enjoying Traveller 
ever since.  Its been only one of two games I\'ve ever played seriously.
(I was glad to see in Joe\'s post that I and my high school friend were
not the only people who enjoyed TSR\'s GAMMA WORLD.)

So that\'s it....pretty dull....We have had our moments though.  Chad,
if your out there, I will never forget, "Your ship shudders and goes
off coarse......but you don\'t notice it."........

	I have tried to find a complete list of Traveller items by GDW on 
the \'net, but have been unsuccessful.  So, I made an attempt on my own.  
I do not yet own all the items listed, nor do I own all editions of each 
item (ie, High Guard had two editions).  So, this list is incomplete.
	If there already is such a list in existence, please point me to it.
	If not, please help me by telling me of items that are not listed

Thanks,

Heck yes! <g>  

It would be hard to do it on a mailing list though. <g>

I\'m particularly interested in how ya\'ll are going to handle system
and planetary generation in T4. H ave ya\'ll picked up on the
abbreviations NT and T4? <g>

What you should do is set up an interview on the Internet Relay Chat
(IRC).  It\'s easy to do and doesn\'t cost anything.  All you have to do
is set up an IRC client on your system, announce a time and channel
name on the list, and show up!  In fact, I\'m sure some of our number
could help ya\'ll do it if needed.

While we\'re on the subject of acronyms and abbreviations (I
enjoyed the challenge when first on x-boat of working out
what they meant from context etc.), can anyone clear up the
names of the MT Alien books?

It took me a while to figure out that \'Rats and Cats\' was the
Solomani and Aslan book but light finally dawned and I was
most amused (at my own blindness mostly!).  Cats is obvious
and I *assume* that Rats is because the Solomani are such
a nasty lot!  (If there\'s another derivation, I\'d love to
hear it.)

However, I have now seen both \'Bogs and Dogs\' and \'Cogs and
Dogs\' for the Vilani/Vargr book.  Is one a mistake or are
both \'in use\'?  Dogs again is obvious but I\'d be interested
to know why bogs or cogs (though I have sneaking suspicions!)

Definately worth including them in the FAQ.

Stuart,

	Hmmm.  As I recall, that adventure was included from the very 
first edition of my list.  Oh, well.  Here\'s the list as it exists, for 
those of you still working from old copies . . . (it\'s now alphabetical 
by publisher):

A Note on Magazines:  While additional issues of many listed magazines 
(i.e., Travellers\' Digest, JTAS (as Challenge), etc.) were produced, 
they are not included here because those issues contained material related
to games other than Classic Traveller, even though they did contain some 
material usable in the Classic Traveller system.  This is also the reason 
certain issues of Space Gamer, Dragon Magazine, and others are not listed.

While we\'re on the subject of acronyms and abbreviations (I
enjoyed the challenge when first on x-boat of working out
what they meant from context etc.), can anyone clear up the
names of the MT Alien books?

It took me a while to figure out that \'Rats and Cats\' was the
Solomani and Aslan book but light finally dawned and I was
most amused (at my own blindness mostly!).  Cats is obvious
and I *assume* that Rats is because the Solomani are such
a nasty lot!  (If there\'s another derivation, I\'d love to
hear it.)

However, I have now seen both \'Bogs and Dogs\' and \'Cogs and
Dogs\' for the Vilani/Vargr book.  Is one a mistake or are
both \'in use\'?  Dogs again is obvious but I\'d be interested
to know why bogs or cogs (though I have sneaking suspicions!)

Definately worth including them in the FAQ.

          [snip]
          
          By the way, in all the discussion about new lists and names for 
          the new incarnation of Traveller, and in the light of the ongoing 
          CT/TNE schism,  I\'m surprised that nobody\'s mentioned:
          
          Traveller 4: The Empire Strikes Back .... ;-)

     Now that we all know about the new Traveller (Traveller \'96, haha), 
     how do you all think FF&S will hold up in this new system??  Will FF&S 
     be incompatible or need some tweaking??  I have so far found FF&S a 
     good resource when creating other Sci-Fi genres and am curious as to 
     what you all might think of this book.

I checked out the web page.  It looks like there\'ll be a lot of interesting
information there when it gets put up :)

Definitely, and there\'s a few ways you could do it.

Let us mail in questions to ask and then post the complete interview here.

Hook up an IRC Client to your web page

Use a private channel on an IRC network like DALNet or Undernet, etc.

I\'d love to see this happen.

I\'ve been wondering about some of the Base Codes for the Dark Nebula =
sector in \'Solomani & Aslan\'.

The T, R and U codes are easy, as they are Aslan bases. The book says so =
on page 88. But what about the codes F, J and M? I can\'t find anything =
about them in that book.

I suppose them to be "combined naval base and \'scout\' station" (F), =
"naval base" (J) and "\'scout\' station" (M), but I\'d like to be sure. One =
strange thing is that they occur both on the Solomani worlds and the =
non-aligned ones.

Any ideas anyone?

I apologize for inundating the list yesterday with one post -
I\'ve often joked with a friend that I could be a whole
high-volume (both ways!) mailing list on my own but I assure
you that that wasn\'t deliberate!

I shall ignore any messages to the effect that *this* post
hasn\'t been delivered and only try again when it doesn\'t turn
up in a digest in a day or two!

While I\'m here though:  :-)

A little while back I asked about \'Memory Alpha\' and got no
repsonse at all, I may have got the publisher wrong and am
still not certain if it is GDW or Group One.

Can anyone tell me *anything* about \'Memory Alpha\'??  (Even
to say it never existed or that they have a copy?)

I can top that.  I bought up all the rest of the hardcovers (all 4,986 
copies) at $35 each.  But, since I\'m a kind and generous person, I\'ll be 
making them available for only $75 each.  Order yours today. :P

Just kidding, of course (as if I have $174,510 just laying around :-).  I 
/did/ buy two copies, though.  One to keep and one to use.  Heck, $35 for a 
hardbound copy, signed by Marc Miller, sounds good to me. :)

TO KEN:  An interview with MM or any of the rest of the IG staff would be
great!  I don\'t care if it\'s an email interview or IRC (I see advantages
to both).  I read the transcript of the the interview done on AOL and
found it a bit choatic before they went into Protocol mode, so I think a
"we all mail in questions and get responses the next day" email setup
would be fine.

Are you sure you\'re not thinking of "metamorphosis Alpha"? That was a game

Well for my two penneth worth I\'d hope the combat system went back to 
Snapshot/Striker, you could pick those rules and run them almost 
without reading them, that was their beauty, they were relatively 
simplistic, FF & S just didn\'t do it for me, sorry. I would hope that 
this has been realised and retro-grouches like myself will prevail.

We tend to treat it as Military Equipment (restricted at Lawlevel 3, I think).

Frankly, this is what you\'ll end up with anyway.  Neither the populations 
of Xboat or TNE will be able to stop themselves from speculating, 
which they will do in a vaccuum.

I vote for option 5 (one list), but I could not bear the resulting canon/
mechanics fights for the "one true way".  And certainly, at this point,

The Ancients wiped each other out 300,000 years ago.  Therefore the Vilani
were taken from Earth over 300,000 years ago.  See also Vilani & Vargr at 2
("Most archaeologists believe that our ancestors on Vland [were] human stock
from the planet Terra, brought to Vland by the Ancients some 300,000 years

Assuming (without looking at my MTJ4) that the mass is in tons and the
displacement in cubic meters, I\'d guess that 201 is a typo for "20".  I
would figure that a med bay would be somewhat less dense than water, by the
time you leave space to move around....

Hi All.
Unlike other principled people on this list, I have no problem wearing 
shirts that advertise things (I\'m wearing a Molson Export shirt as I 
write this :-).  I would _definately_ buy and wear a Traveller T-shirt so 
long as the design was reasonably cool.  Both the designs suggested so far 
sound good to me.  I like tube-o\'-ships concept, too.

Well, Marc himself has already responded, albeit briefly.  I own a copy 
of Memory Alpha, from back when it was offered free for a SASE from GDW.
Unfortunately, it\'s in transit with many of my other files from Virginia
to Texas.  Ask me again in a few weeks.  :-)

It was a mystery adventure involving memory alteration: it began when a
group of characters accepted a job and payment, with the proviso that,
afterwards, their memories of the job would be erased.  It then jumped
forward (as did the characters\' memories, of course) to the post-job
pay-off, and then chronicled their efforts to find the clues they\'d
left themselves about what the job _really_ entailed.

I shan\'t post spoilers, lest anyone want to play the adventure through.

about Galactic 2.0 (ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/doc/games/roleplay/
programs/mapping/gal20.zip), I\'m thinking about doing a slight upgrade.
The main purpose of this will be to increase the number of world-
descriptions included with the program, though I\'ll probably take
the opportunity to work a bit on the program as well. A few of you
have already given me permission to include your world write-ups:

     Michael Bailey    Emerald, Jewell, Pequan, Ruby
     Doug Berry        Capon
     Lewis Roberts     Gerome, Lewis
     Jeff Zeitlin      Glisten, Nutema

   (If anybody knows the current addresses of Alvin Plummer
   or Christopher Griffen, please drop me note)

I figure that many of you silent-types out there must have
written-up other worlds within the Spinward Marches and other
sectors. If so, please send me what you\'ve done, assuming you\'d
like to see your work included with the next upgrade.

For those of you who are interested in working on a variant
Traveller-setting, I\'ve been putting together a history to go
with the "Variant 1" galaxy that was included with Galactic 2.0.
Email me if you\'re interested. At this point, I\'m basically
looking for comments as well as world descriptions.

Also, for those of you who are interested in getting involved
with a group of people who are hashing-out a non-Traveller SF-RPG
setting situated only a few decades into the future where Earth
has been contacted by members of an alien civilization (and things
didn\'t quite go as planned for either side), let me know. We\'ve
been toying with this for around a year now, and there\'s still a
long way to go. Nonetheless, I can send you the game\'s tentative
premise if you\'re interested in checking it out and perhap
offering comments (or even contributing to the project once we get
better organized).

If I remember correctly, Memory Alpha was a module for Gary Gygax\'s Cyborg 
Commando game (but I can\'t remember who the publisher was). I did see a copy 
of Cyborg Commando once at my games club, when I still lived in Glasgow, and 
I don\'t remember being very impressed at all.

If you\'re still desperate to own a copy, you could try Second Games Galore 
on 01234 823873 (from outside the UK the number is: +44 1234 823873), but I 
don\'t recall seeing Cyborg Commando in his stock last time I looked.

I think the CT double adventure Divine Intervention has sonic stunners
as PC special equipment.  I\'m suprised these didn\'t make it into MT,
as almost every other piece of postulated equipment has.

Subject: Weapons of Non-Leathal Intent
Message-ID: <9604191641.AA01778@khan.avalon.COM>



Weapons of Non-Leathal Intent (WNLI) are the big topic of discussion in several 
UN subcommittees right now.  The US DOD, Russia and the British MOD have done a 
lot of interesting research into it, and come up with some very Buck-Rodgers 
ideas, including Focussed-Concussion Explosives, Tasers, incapacitiating riot 
control gasses, stcky foam, dowel guns and sonic projectors.  However, each one 
of these weapons has been a miserable failure from a purely economic view; the 
cost of the weapons and manpower to incapacitiate one person with WNLI is at 
least ten times greater than with standard weapons.  In addition, each of the 
methods come up with thus far have very limited applications; they can either 
be easily blocked/avoided, or easily defended against.  The WNLI that are more 
effective at avoiding these defenses tend to be much more drastic and more 
potentially leathal.

I would suspect that Traveller has less WNLI due to the wargame background, but 
also because a WNLI that effects a human would effect aliens very differently; 
aliens might be unaffected by a concussion wave, or might die when exposed to a 
gas that incapacitates humans.  It would seem very unlikely that there would be 
one thing  (beyond plain old kinetic energy) that would effect all races 
equally, from either a WNLI or Leathal Weapon viewpoint.

Some interesting things to look for:
1)  Sonics.  There seems to be a lot of potential here.  Police and Military 
have had major success with a very simple Sonic WNLI, the Flash-Bang Concussion 
grenade.  There are some new experimental flash-bang rifle rounds soon to be 
produced, and the actual grenade continues to be improved (but remains quite 
dangerous to bystanders).  In the future, you might see major improvements in 
some of the experiemental crowd-control sound projectors used in China and 
Russia; imagine a hand-held weapon that immediately stuns an opponent, or fills 
the opponent with dread and terror.  In Traveller, I have always included

Memory Alpha was a Traveller adventure (tournament scenario).

There may have been a Cyborg Commando adventure with the same name, and there
was the TSR Metamorphosis Alpha game.

 Subject: Looking for World Descriptions
 
  Hi all. Since some of you folks have sent me such great feedback about
Galactic 2.0
(ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/doc/games/roleplay/programs/mapping/gal20.zip), I\'m
thinking about doing a slight upgrade.  The main purpose of this will be to
increase the number of world-descriptions included with the program, though
I\'ll probably take the opportunity to work a bit on the program as well. A
few of you have already given me permission to include your world write-ups:
>>
=====================================================
I don\'t have world descriptions for you... but I do have some comments.....

I\'ve written some traveller related programs too.... and your program is the
most stright foreward, useful, and flexible program I\'ve run into.... all the
more amazing since it\'s written in the easiest language ever designed!  I
hope you don\'t mind, but I\'m looking into some new wrinkles that you might
like and I\'ll send you the source code when it\'s finished ( I refuse to
distribute it since it\'s "your baby" ).  I just wanted to let you know that
your work is appreciated ... especially since your program is written in such
a way that it almost screams for input from anyone that see it... THAT\'S the
very thing that\'ll keep Traveller going and growing... people like sewing the
seeds that\'ll keep all of us thinking....  

Thanks!!

	Right.  And it was reprinted in the magazine, "The Imperial News

I\'m posting my question directly to you..and a copy to the list.

There are "GEAR-HEADS" who are very concerned about equipment, ships,
and weapons, and then there are "SYSTEM-BUILDERS" like me.

So, tell us about Star System Generation, both basic and extended.
Will there be any changes in the algorithms used to develop and
describe stars and planets, if so what are they, will the RULES book
contain detail up to WORLD BUILDERS level (if not which book will),
and will you release software (or contract it out) to help develop
complete systems?

Some further comments:

1. The UWP is a good shorthand method of describing a planet,
   but *not* a system.  Consider expanding, or supplementing, it
   to contain data on the entire system.
   
2. I know you don\'t have the rights to 2300AD, but there were
   some ideas in there that are an advance on classic Trav when
   it comes to describing planets, ex. inner/outer planet types,
   core type, density, more extensive descriptions of
   atmospheres, etc.  You probably can\'t *use* that material, but
   you could draw on it.
    
3. T4, and Milieu 0 in particular, is going to depend on GM\'s
   doing *lots* of system generation..if I understand your plans
   correctly..so *please* put a lot of effort into this area
   right up front.

The problem is that jump 1 trade is presented as the least profitable
leavings left after the big shiping companies have gobbled up the
more profitable trade.  The reality is that using a jump-6 ship
increases your costs and decreases your revenue and is the least
profitable trade.  If a big corp is going to monopolize anything,
it\'s going to be jump 1.

I don\'t have a cite handy, but a few comments on flash-bangs (which are 
indeed widely used in counterterrorist warfare at TL8):

1.  They *do* work, and work well.
2.  They can set fires (though this effect, if considered undesirable, could
     be eliminated at higher tech levels).
3.  Their effectiveness is apparently based on a *combination* of the light
     and sound effects; either one alone is not anywhere near as effective.
4.  I seem to recall that the *timing* of the flash and bang is important,
     and calibrated to the human nervous system.  This is the part I\'m least
     certain about, but if true it has implications for use against Traveller
     aliens.

   That would be mine.  I still have the responses (around 90 of them)
sitting on my desk, waiting to be recounted and turned into data.  The
final results should be ready before June 6th.

   Preliminary findings:

   The split between CT/MT and TNE players was about 60-40 in favor
of TNE.  Many of you have modified (to varying degrees) the rules set,
regardless of what basis you use for game mechanics.

   The most popular setting by far is the Spinward Marches, with the
Solomani Rim finishing a distant second.  So many people use the
Spinward Marches (CTers, MTers, TNEers) I\'m surprised that GDW even
considered releasing the Reformation Coalition material first when they
developed TNE.  Without question (IMHO) TNE was not an attempt to
``appease current players`` as at least one person has suggested, but it
was an attempt to bring in new players to the game (an attempt  that
was not as successful as perhaps it should have been).

   The most surprising result was the answer to the question regarding
whether or not people were considering the purchase of the new
Traveller.  My theory going into this exercise is that there would be a
small group of people who had been around Traveller for a while, who
were still die hard fans of the game, but had had enough, and while
they still planned on playing some version of it, it would be T4.  If that
group does exist, they didn\'t respond to my survey.  The overwhelming
majority of you plan on buying at least some of the new IG\'s Traveller
products, and many of you plan on buying all of them sight unseen.
While there was a significant percentage of you that still want to see
more before you will consider a purchase, *no one* ruled it completely
out.

   As for the date the respondents said they started playing Traveller,
most of you said that you started playing in the early 80s (for some
reason the year 1982 was very popular--what was released that year
Traveller-wise?).  Significant was the drop off of new players after
1985-86.  Apparently MegaTraveller brought very few new players into
the game.  It appears that were more people that took up Traveller during
the TNE era than the MT era, but the number were not particularly large.

   Prelimary conclusion: MegaTraveller did more to kill GDW, than TNE
(though I\'m sure at least one of you will say that while MT put the
company on life support, TNE pulled the plug); and Traveller fans are
probably the most loyal in the gaming industry--or perhaps the most
stubborn. <g>

Dave Nilsen said that he came to the conclusion that GDW was screwed when they 
issued the Regency sourcebook, for which everyone had been clamoring, but the 
distributors didn\'t pick it up in any significant quantities.  [My guess is 
the distributors had all their ready cash sunk into CCGs.]  After the TSR 
debacle, GDW just didn\'t have the reserves to continue.

I can\'t comment about other people, but TNE was what got me interested in 
Traveller.  I found both CT and MT uninspiring (although I liked 2300 a lot). 
Then, towards the end of MT, I began finding things I liked (the Rebellion 
Sourcebook, Starship Operators Manual, Survival Margin, the reissue of 
Imperium).  The more I read about TNE, the more excited I became.  [Incidently 
I claim to be the first person in the world to buy a copy of TNE -- I handed 
the money to Dave Nilsen while standing in the GDW warehouse the morning it 
shipped.  The distributors didn\'t have it yet.] After buying TNE, I began 
going back and purchasing all the CT and MT stuff, and now I have about 80% of 
the MT stuff and 70% of the CT stuff, including all of the boardgames.

For the record, though, I\'m not much of an RPG player (although I\'m certainly 
a buyer).  I\'m an SF and history buff, so RPGs often make good reading for me.  
Most of my gaming is historical and SF boardgaming, although I also play SF 
and naval miniatures.  My three favorite games of all time are probably Space 
Hulk, Triplanetary, and Imperium -- the last two being "proto-Traveller" games 
put out by GDW.

Not real surprising.  CT\'s system as it exists is dated.  MT had 
promise, and the errata makes it my favorite of the 3 systems, but 
without the errata it was a mess.  TNE being the newest and (I hate 
to say it) complete system (outside of its total lack of vehicle/ship 
design rules (yes I know, you can fall asleep trying to design them 
with FF&S) makes this not too surprising.  It sounds like NT will be 
closer to MT in design...

I\'d say that GDW\'s heavy emphasis on the RC as opposed to the Regency 
was probably what pulled the plug, in light of your findings.  Not 
coincidental that Spinward Marches was GDW\'s/DGP\'s most heavily 
developed area...  

Sounds like other GM\'s used the "official" universe as much as I 
did...

Quite the contrary.  All you need to do is read this list, and 
realize that TNE was in no way an attempt to "appease current 
players".  If it was, it was probably the poorest marketing decision 
since the New Coke...  It succeeded in pissing off a large majority 
of current players...

I think it was an attempt to attract new players...  I would say it 
had some success in doing so, but probably alienated more players 
than it attracted (otherwise GDW might still be a going concern...)

I guess I don\'t find this all that surprising.  After all the two 
lists (TML & XBoat) are by definition hard core players/fans of the 
game, otherwise they wouldn\'t be on the mailing lists.  I suspect 
that most of the CT/MT/TNE players will probably at least want to 
look at the new rules...  I would suspect that many people who played 
CT or MT  may have bought the MT/TNE rules, decided they didn\'t like the 
setting, didn\'t buy any more of the books for that setting, and went 
back to their old game.

I would suspect that initial reaction to T4 will be rather receptive 
by the readers...  Whether however, they buy further books will 
depend on what kind of a job IG has done in defining the setting, and 
writing/proofreading the books...

I already placed an order for 2 of the hardcovers...  I figured for 
the extra $5 for hardcover, I\'d be a fool not to...  There are others 
on this list as well.

Actually I have a different point of view on this.  I think GDW was a 
Dr. assisted suicide...they pulled their own plug.

If you look at the credits for MT, the whole system was basically 
written by DGP.  GDW went 2 years without publishing anything for the 
game themselves (other than Challenge) between 1988 (Rebellion 
Sourcebook), and 1990 (Fighting Ships of the Shattered 
Imperium).  Meanwhile, DGP wrote Starship Operators Manual, 
World Builders Handbook, Vilani & Vargr.  

When you look at what happened in those 2 years, its obvious why 
GDW is dead.  The two products that put GDW on the map were 
Traveller and the Europa series wargames.  

During this period they sold off the Europa series, and they stopped 
their support for Traveller.  How well would Coca Cola do if they suddenly 
stopped producing Coca Cola Classic and Diet Coke?  Instead they produced 
crap like Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.
  
GDW did figure out the error of their ways, but too little too late.  
They wrote Hard Times, and released some support material for it, and 
then TNE.  TNE was IMO a last ditch effort to save GDW.  If they\'d 
picked a different setting, it might have worked.  But they alienated 
a chunk of what customer base they had with the Virus idea, and then 
alienated more by ignoring the Regency (which is according to survey, 
the games favorite) for 2 years, while they wrote what amounted to 
Twilight 2K campaigns with spaceships for the Reformation Coalition.  
This alienated a lot of people who really are more interested in the 
first contact/mercantile aspects of Traveller than in playing 
Traveller Yahtzee with miniatures (Lots of combat die rolls with 
miniatures thrown in for graphics).  

(Personal opinion, Dave Nilsen\'s writing style, which sacrificed 
information in favor of puns, cliches, and very bad humor rubbed a 
lot of people the wrong way.  If Marc Miller is smart, he won\'t let 
Nilsen within a 1000 yards of his game if he wants it to succeed.  At 
least as a writer...) 

> probably the most loyal in the gaming industry--or perhaps the most
> stubborn. <g>

Judging by the vitality of the list for which no new material has 
been released for almost a year, I would take this a given.

I resemble this remark... :-)

>    More later.

I look forward to your results and analysis, Harold... :-)

Interesting...  Is it just me, or does it seem like the CCG\'s are 
about to collapse of their own weight?  I suspect that they are 
already dying...

What exactly was the TSR debacle?  I assume it had something to do 
with Gygax and Dangerous Journeys, but I never really heard the 
details.  I was out of the hobby about that time.

        Remember that about a month ago I asked if anyone had done a
 program to simulate alien speech for the Amiga?  Well in the
following
 hours I DID write such a program and uploaded it promptly to MPGN,
 but it looks like they were too busy to process the uploads until
last
 week.  Anyways, here\'s a few lines from the READ.ME file:

AlienSpeak V1.0: 
on ftp.mpgn.com, Gaming/Traveller/Programs/Amiga, file aliensp.lzx

*Requires AmigaOS 2.04.  It might work on 1.3 without the special
voices.

*What does it do?  Two things:
        1) It translates words & sentences from any Traveller
language
 into the closest appriopriate phonemes available in the
speak-device.
        2) It says those words, using the speak-device to talk in the
 closest approximation of \'alien\' voices I could tune.
 
Things to note:
1) If you put in misspelled words or words that don\'t belong to the 
language, the program will show you where the error is.  It will
still
speak the sentence, but will skip that syllable.

Comments are welcome.

        Note that I have archived it using LZX.
        
        Also, I have noticed that my previous piece of software,
 TravMapper, has been removed from the ftp site.  As version 1.27
 has been ready for about a year, I will probably upload it there.
 It features must faster screen-refresh, planet filters, and a 
 fairly complete ARexx port with scripts for Trade and UWP 
 displays, and other uses possible.

I don\'t know all of the details, but from what I heard, T$R basically sued GDW 
because they really hate Gary Gygax.  They used some sort of \'we invented 
fantasy roleplaying\' sort of garbage as an excuse, but GDW just didn\'t have 
the financial resources to deal with it, so they settled.  It cost them a 
relatively large amount of money, but I don\'t know how much.

Just another reason to hate T$R (like I needed another one).

	In /favor/ of TNE?  Hmmm.  Of course, that just means that there 
are more TNE players /on these lists/, not necessarily more TNE players 
in the general population.

	That sounds likely to me, as well.  But, I think the new 
Traveller will be what MT and TNE SHOULD have been.  The trick in the 
upgrading thing is retaining your current customer base while gaining new 
customers.  Witness Windows \'95, which is less stable and more bloated 
than it could have been if the Windows 3.x compatability had been left 
out.  Microsoft realizes that they would have lost a lot of customers 
(ie, they would have stayed with Windows 3.x, or moved to another 
platform) had they forced a shift to a noncompatable Windows environment.
	From all I have heard from Ken at IG, T4 will be fully backwards 
compatable with CT.  You can take your CT character and, without making 
any changes at all, run him under T4 rules.  You can grab any CT 
adventure, and run it under T4 rules as well.  The T4 rules are different 
in places, it is true, but the compatability issue seems to have been 
resolved well.

	According to my "Big CT Products List," not much was released in 
1982.  1983-84 were the best years for Traveller products.  Lots of 
re-releases (Mayday, Snapshot, etc.) and new products (Starter Traveller, 
Beltstrike, etc.).
	On the other hand, lots of great stuff came out for Traveller in 
1981, which may in fact be the reason behind the 1982 start-date being so 
popular.  For instance, Paranoia Press had lots of good products, the 
Deluxe Traveller set came out, and Judges\' Guild came out with a lot of 
Traveller material.

> 1985-86.  Apparently MegaTraveller brought very few new players into

	I remember how it was at the game shop I used to frequent in 
California (Games Unlimited, in the Willows shopping center, for those 
familiar with the SF bay area).  During the CT era, Traveller products 
were carried in the back corner, right next to the high-traffic AD&D and 
miniatures sections.  They had the Traveller wire rack with the 
digest-sized books, and several shelves of larger Traveller material.  
	When the MT era began, the Traveller stuff was moved to the 
bottom shelf in the middle of the store.  Then, when the game didn\'t do 
very well, it was moved to the BACK of that bottom shelf, making it 
impossible to see unless on got down on his hands and knees.  
	While this definitely didn\'t help sales in that particular shop, 
it also is an indication of how the gaming community in the area received 
the new system.  The owner isn\'t stupid - if it was a good seller, he 
would have kept it in a prominent location.  Heck, if products would have 
come out for it on any kind of regular basis, it probably would have had 
better positioning.  But since from 88-90 it virtually appeared to be an 
abandoned system, it got relegated to the back, bottom shelves.

	Sounds reasonable to me, as I indicated above.  While MT 
maintained better CT compatability than did TNE, the result clearly shows 
that this was yet another upgrade that was handled poorly.  Lack of 
product, tons of errors in the manuals, and other mistakes undoubtedly 
killed MT, and Traveller with it.

	Again, I look forward to it.

I\'d have to disagree here.  I have a friend who owns a small gaming store,
and CCGs are still his hotest item.  Granted, he only stocks Magic, Star
Wars, Star Trek, Werewolf and a few others, but still, sales are supposedly
hotter than ever for MTG (ARGH!  I hate it!).

However, I personally *really* enjoy a CCG just released by Chaosium, called
"Mythos" based on Call of Cthulthu (sorry about the spelling).

What I think would be cool is a Traveller based CCG.  Anyone from Imperium
want to answer this question, is there a Traveller CCG on the drawing board.
If so, I\'d give a few suggestions:

1)  Make it character orientated.  Have the player play one character who is
*really* in the game (unlike MTG\'s \'abstract\' wizard who isn\'t a real card
or anything but just takes damage, and more like Chaosium\'s Mythos
investigator).

2)  Don\'t make killing the other players the object of the game, have some
scenarios\\adventurer\\quests to complete in whicha player must go to certain
places, get objects etc. to complete them

3)  Have a set of defined SOLO-RULES in the rulebook.  Some of us (myself
included) enjoy playing alone or can\'t get anyone else to shell out the cash
to buy any cards.

Well, that\'s just my two cents worth,

I\'ve got a question, what\'s the Third Imperium\'s TL?  IN the Referee\'s

planets, such as Capital and Terra have TLs of 15.  Does the 9 signify the

I would think that sound and light would be quite effective still on their
own, as they both can cause extreme pain in large quantities (eg. looking at
the sun too long, extremely loud noises cause pain, etc.)

It would be good is you could calibrate it, but as for Aliens, they\'d still
have get specimens to figure out what the calibrations needed to be.

I think I misstated things here.  What I really should have said is 
that the CCG market seems to be saturated...

I have a feeling that a Traveller CCG would merely get lost in the 
shuffle...

I wouldn\'t mind one though.

You got it...

For the heck of it looking at the 2D Traveller spacemap

Directions are as follows.

North=Coreward (towards the Galactic Core
South=Rimward 
East=Trailing
West=Spinward

The Spinward Marches are at the spinward extremity of the Imperium.  
They and the remainder of the Domain of Deneb, are connected to the 
Imperium only by a tenuous link of worlds in the Corridor Sector (2 
sectors to Trailing from Spinward Marches.

In MegaTraveller, the Corridor Sector is overrun by the Vargr, and 
the link was cut...

North (or Coreward) depending on what version you are playing, is the Galactic 
core.

According to CT/MT/TNE the Zhodani made several expeditions towards 
the Galactic core, guided by an Ancients artifact.  What they found 
there is some sort of alien race or creatures which apparently have a 
powerful impact on Psionic practicioners, like the Zhodani...

West (or Spinward) is pretty much uncharted and unknown, once you get 
about a sector beyond the Zhodani Consulate.

Actually I have a different point of view on this.  I think GDW was a 
Dr. assisted suicide...they pulled their own plug.

<deleted>
written by DGP.  GDW went 2 years without publishing anything for the 
game themselves (other than Challenge) between 1988 (Rebellion 
Sourcebook), and 1990 (Fighting Ships of the Shattered 
Imperium). 

When you look at what happened in those 2 years, its obvious why 
GDW is dead.  The two products that put GDW on the map were 
Traveller and the Europa series wargames.  

During this period they sold off the Europa series, and they stopped 
their support for Traveller. Instead they did crap like Cadillacs &
Dinosaurs.
  
GDW did figure out the error of their ways, but too little too late.  
They wrote Hard Times, and released some support material for it, and 
then TNE. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let\'s not forget when GDW apparently fell under the evil influence of
E. Gary Gygax. How in the world they ever thought they\'d get away with
DD/DV w/o major litigation is completely beyond my reasoning, esp. con-
sidering TSR\'s previous track record. It sorta\' reminds me of when the
old USFL decided to switch from a spring to a fall schedule. They knew
that they didn\'t have a chance going up against the NFL but figured
they\'d make more money from an anti-trust lawsuit than by continuing
to operate. What really happened is, of course, history. Needless to
say the USFL got neither money nor kept their league operating.

(Personal opinion, Dave Nilsen\'s writing style, which sacrificed

Nilsen within a 1000 yards of his game if he wants it to succeed.  At 
least as a writer...)

Here\'s my question for Marc Miller.  It\'s kind of a two parter.

Recognizing that Traveller is first and foremost a pencil, paper and 
dice game, it perhaps more than most other RPG\'s makes heavy demands on 
referees of a bookkeeping nature.  Is there any plan afoot, for 
either Imperium Games or a third party licensee to make software 
supporting the game, such as a ship/vehicle building system, world 
generation in the vein of World Builders Handbook, cargo system 
or anything else?  Will IG be defining standard data formats for others 
to use in designing such software?

Microsoft, and others don\'t like T4 because it reminds them of Revenue
Canada :-) (plus it\'s sort of innaccurate).  So, here are some
possibilities.  

MMT:  Mark Miller\'s TRAVELLER.  This is what Imperium Games seems to be 
calling the new version, so maybe this would work.  Or does this seem too 
much like MegaMegaTraveller :-) ?

IGT:  Imperium Games TRAVELLER.  It won\'t be confused with any of the 
present acronyms and hopefully it can also stand for "Incredibly Great 
Traveller" :-).

FFT:  Far Future TRAVELLER.  Possibility of being confused with FF&S?  
(Yes, you\'d have to be a dunderhead, but never underestimate the power of 
human stupidity).

	Despite my flippant tone, I really would like people to consider 
these. I think it would be nice to agree on what to call this phoenix.

Oh, in that case I agree wholeheartedly.  There are way too many CCGs on the
market.  Basically everything that has ever been done (eg. Wing Commander,
Highlander) gets a card game.  It\'s sickening.

You\'re probably right it\'d get lost in the shuffle, but not to Traveller
Ffans like ourselvers.  I\'ve found that CCGs based on a RPG (eg. Mythos, On
the Edge) are targetted mostly on the people who already play the RPG.

First of all I\'d like to encourage Harold Hale to get that data ready. 
I\'m dying to see it, and I\'m sure Ken and the IG staff wouldn\'t mind 
getting a copy.

- ----
  The most surprising result was the answer to the question regarding
whether or not people were considering the purchase of the new
Traveller.  My theory going into this exercise is that there would be a
small group of people who had been around Traveller for a while, who
were still die hard fans of the game, but had had enough, and while
they still planned on playing some version of it, it would be T4.  If that
group does exist, they didn\'t respond to my survey.  The overwhelming
majority of you plan on buying at least some of the new IG\'s Traveller
products, and many of you plan on buying all of them sight unseen.
While there was a significant percentage of you that still want to see
more before you will consider a purchase, *no one* ruled it completely
out.
- ----

	I don\'t see why this result is surprising at all.  So far, almost
everyone I\'ve talked to or emailed with has reacted positively to the
things they\'ve heard about NT/T4.  I personally know at least 5 people who
refused to buy TNE but plan to come back for NT/T4.  Phil MacGregor even
saw a draft of the equipment section and seems to have given it his
hard-gained approval (Not a flame Phil, but you do seem to have, shall we
say, a knack for incicive critique? :-). 
	Everything I\'ve seen indicates that IG is a company that will 
love Traveller as much as its fans (unlike GDW, who seemed reluctant 
about the whole thing).  And I am absolutely impressed by the team 
they\'ve assembled and most (though not all, of course) of the ideas they 
have put forth.  I would say this is a common opinion among the Traveller 
devotees I know.
	I would say that I\'ve only seen a minority of TNE blowhards 
(diehards! I meant diehards! :-) who absolutely refuse to go back to the 
so-called "70\'s era rules" (whatever that means).  And even long-time 
TNE\'ers are considering the NT/T4 project. 

Okay, I time to don the asbestos underwear...

	When Marc Miller wrote to me recently to thank me for supporting 
Traveller by purchasing two copies of the hardback version, in his 
message he said, "Thank you for your support of T4."  So, if MM is 
calling it "T4," I\'d say that\'s the official acronym.

Yup...anyday now, I expect to see Twister, the CCG, or Mission: 
Impossible: the CCG... :-)

I live in constant fear of Steel Magnolias: The CCG, however... ;-)

Very, very true...Hell, I don\'t even like CCG\'s and I\'d probably buy one...

BTW, isn\'t it great to be able to discuss and look forward to where 
the game is going again?  Six months ago, about all anybody was 
talking about was the death rattle of GDW on TML, and how much they 
hated TNE on XTML...

Marc, First, thanks for bringing Traveller back.  It is the best role-playing
game I have experienced.  Secondly, thanks for taking time to answer these questions.  

Question:  Some of the players that play in our group are really attached to the
Classic Traveller method of handling Computers.  We had several adventures around trying to get jump tapes, and usually both them from the shareware tape
vendor "Jermain Domain" who sold stuff written by his brother "Public". (I suppose you had to be there).  But later Traveller products got away from the
day-to-day software handling of CT.  Others wish that the computers in Traveller were more like those in Star Trek, all powerful complete control of the vessel things.  Mega-Traveller was more Starwars\'ish where the computer didn\'t have a
real role, just there, and modified a few rolls.

Comments have been made that the equipment is going to have a big face lift, to make it more sci-fi for the 90s.  So, my question, how would you describe the 
role of computers in the new "Traveller"?

Thanks
Rob

I genuinely wonder how many people actually use FF&S.  Not own it, 
but actively use it.  I don\'t mind bookkeeping, but I took 1 look at FF&S, 
and thought, "Gee, with my spare time, it\'d take me about 2 weeks to generate 
a ship..."  Not to mention having to design turrets and ammunition for the thing...  

Sorry, but IMNSHO, science fiction is high adventure, contacts with 
aliens, alien artifacts, starship battles...alien worlds and 
cultures, not a geeky discussion over HEPlaR vs. Thrusters, neither of which 
exist, and most likely won\'t exist in our lifetimes...

True, somebody could design stuff with an FF&S Lite, but then you 
might as well go ahead and use a different, less comprehensive design 
system...

Accordingly, I think it\'d be worthwhile to take a poll  (OH, GOD, NOT 
ANOTHER ONE...)  :-)

The What Design System Are You Using Poll:
1. Are you currently playing Traveller using Traveller: The New Era 
rules, regardless of setting?

2.  Do you own a copy of FF&S (Fire, Fusion & Steel)?

3. Have you ever used FF&S to design a starship, weapon, vehicle or 
other items?

4. Have you ever used the posted FF&S Lite rules to design items?

5.  Do you own the Megatraveller Rules?

6. Have you ever designed a starship, vehicle, or small craft with 
the MegaTraveller rules?

7. Do you own a version of the Classic Traveller rules (Traveller 
Book, Little black books, Deluxe Traveller, Starter Traveller)?

8.  Do you have Book 5, High Guard?

9.  Do you have Striker?

10.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 2, Starships?

11.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 5, High Guard?

12. Have you ever designed vehicles or other items using Striker?

13. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your 
preference for designing starships: (Book 2, Starships, Book 5, High 
Guard, MegaTraveller, FF&S)

14. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your 
preference for designing vehicles (Striker, MegaTraveller, FF&S)

People must be using it otherwise they wouldn\'t be complaining about
it.  I found it no more cumbersome than any other design system once I
got the hang of it (and yes, all design systems take some getting used
to).

I\'d say the same thing, but then why do people complain so much about
how accurate is the system generation rules?  Why do the combat rules
work the way they do?  What about character generation?  The fact of
the matter is that rules make a game and the people playing that game
make it an adventure.  It\'s all the same argument, people just tend to
not care about something unless it\'s what they\'re interested in.

: system...

FF&S Lite is an idea to make FF&S feel more like the old design
sequences.

I think that FF&S is greatly stigmatized because instead of being in
the form of basic and then advanced, it was just advanced.  My best
friend said it looked like an old calculas textbook to him (but then
again, he used WBH to create a planet of Flea and Mary Lou Retton
clones--he likes to make planets and systems, and I like to make
gadgets and ships).

Then again, for MT, to be able to create anything that I could with
FF&S, I had to own the Referee\'s Manual, COACC, Hard Times, and a buch
of issues of Challenge which had low-tech design systems in them.  And
BTRC\'s 3G^3 for weapon design.  I think I preferred the convenience of
having them all in one place with FF&S.  Ask William Hostman about the
package I sent him.

Why should I have to create?  Why shouldn\'t I?  I like to be able to
create items that are consistent to game universe.  With no guidelines
this can\'t really happen.  After all, my def of TL15 and yours could
be radically different.

As an aside, I remember back in 1988 people bitching and moaning that
MT\'s design system clobbered their HG designs.  No longer could you
have a 6G, J4, outta this world agility ship in under 50 tons.  Man,
there were a lot of unhappy people out there.  And many of them got
used to MT and then became unhappy when there was yet another design
system to get used to.

One last rant.  I don\'t see why people argue over the differences in
technology.  Let\'s look at some of the changes over the years.  100
ton limit for starships, HEPlaR vs Thrusters, jump fuel usage.  In CT,
I don\'t ever remember seeing a 100 ton limit, as far as I know, it was
added in MT.  All of the sudden it\'s an issue to CanonMongers?  Why,
because it doesn\'t fit in with TypoTraveller or because it\'s part of
TNE.  What will we do if T4 has no 100 ton limit.  HEPlaR!  What a
great subject.  I once asked someone why they don\'t just use Thrusters
instead.  There are even design rules for them in FF&S.  I mean we all
know that HEPlaR was just a tool to make space combat more exciting.
And it\'s not like every player follows the rules religiously and
doesn\'t change anything to their liking.  His response basically was
that if he use Thrusters, he wouldn\'t have anything to bitch about
with TNE.  And fuel use.  We do all know that you use all your jump
fuel whether you jump the full capacity of your drive or partial
capacity.  However no one seemed to mind this CHANGE IN CANON.  That\'s
probably due to the fact that many people did away with this
restriction under CT and MT.

Take it easy, and remember I\'m not really defending TNE per se, but
rather pointing out how people always look for something to complain
about.

SF tradition is part of it, but there\'s a practical justification -- when 
your society is spread out over long distances, time-wise, local 
governments have to have a lot of autonomy.  A feudal system, where the 
local rulers can act as they see fit on most issues, is likely to be one 
of the more effective ways to govern, when orders from the capital take 
months, or years, to arrive.  Democracies require good internal 
communications.

	Because they call it Space Opera..that\'s why.  The reason you see it 
so much in SF is that it\'s an easy cop-out way of having a 
pre-concieved governmental structure that all readers have some idea 
of it\'s structure...this is the same &@#%@$ reason Trav has 
cutlasses...sigh.

	The Rule of Man was called the Ramshackle Empire for good reason 
 Its government derived from the Solomani military takeover of 
Vilani government.  It was a sort of  autocratic sort of feudal sort of 
bureaucracy that, mainly, left things to local administrators to keep 
things running.  Therefore, I suspect the gamut ran from sheer 
anarchy to utter autocracy, and everything in between, depending on 
the resourcefulness and/or ambition of the local commander. 

	This, among other things, was what led to the Long Night; this lack 
of centralized authority, or more precisely, lack of centralized 
SOURCE of authority.  No government with communication lag times 
restricted by Jump 2 travel times can operate with any sort of 
centralized authority...the officials on scene have to pretty much 
run everything themselves. What makes the difference between this 
turning into a lot of independent states and a single empire is

   When you consider that many of the TNEers have had to purchase
three rules sets in 10-12 years, and soon face the prospect of
purchasing a forth, customer loyalty was,  I believed,  a real question. 
That question has been resoundingly answered.

   <gasp!>  Now I\'m not so sure I want to buy it.  <G>  Well now *I* want
to see the equipment section if for no other reason but to see what
``Phil Approved`` means.

   It is very similar to the pool they had back in pre-1987 era.  Hopefully
the product will be a good too.

   It means that they consider TNE to be an improvement over the two
previous generations of the rules, so why regress?  I\'m not convinced
that the new Traveller will be a regrind of the old rules, with underskilled
characters (pre-Merc, pre-HG, pre-Scouts, etc. that is) a total lack of
meaningful design sequences, and the old ``base of 8 or greater`` to
resolve things.  I don\'t think that\'s anything people want--RPGs have
progressed way beyond that point.

>And even long-time  TNE\'ers are considering the NT/T4 project. 

   To have invested in TNE, you either had to be new to Traveller (with
no preconceived notions of orthodoxy), or incredibly loyal to GDW.
TNE was nothing more or less than an attempt to do exactly what
Imperium Games is setting out to do right now--revive something that has
proven to be one of the best and most popular sci-fi games of all time,
and attempt to recapture some of the flavor of the original game at the
same time.  Having had the benefit of talking with Frank Chadwick and
Dave Nilsen, I can tell you that was what they were trying to do.  You
can debate how successful they were at it, but that was their intention.

Harold

Yes, definitely!  I only bought Traveller two months ago, and I found this
list about the same time.  All I saw was people flaming each other and
complaining about GDW\'s death, so I was kind of angry that I
d even purchased it, seeing that their would obivously be no support
material.  Now, however, it\'s great that we can look forward to a whole host
of new items.

First, let me say a few words before my question.  Thank you for this chance
at having an interview with the creator of the game, and gettign feedback
from the fans in general (via the Xboat and TML).  I must sya that it\'s a
lot more than some companies (who will remain nameless) have done.

Secondly, excellent Web Page!  I check back regularly, and I love the
addition of pictures (from the general art to the "roster").  

Okay, here\'s my questions.

In MegaTraveller, the design system for ship\'s takes me a while, because I
don\'t know that much about it.  I found that, looking through the Referee\'s
Manual and Imperial Encyclopedia didn\'t really help explain some facets of
the ship (like the thruster plates, and different G-force speeds).  I was
wondering two things, will T4 have a BASIC and ADVANCED ship generation so
you can choose how detailed the ship will be?  Also, will T4 explain the
different facets of the ship\'s system with more depth than before?

after about a 10 year hiatus.  I\'ve been receiving xboat-digest for about
a month now and must say it is one of the most interesting list-servs I\'ve
ever subscribed to.

Ok, here\'s my question:
While reading Library Data A-M on the train this morning I came across
something related to a May 11th post that sparked some confusion on
my part.

On May 11th someone wrote:

In Library Data (A-M) pg.6 it states:
"A jump drive is both fast and simple.  With one, it is possible
to move from here to there (where both  places are at least one
hundred planetary diameters out from any large masses) in a period
of about a week."

I was wondering if SSOMv1 allows some special rules for making
jumps closer than 100 PDs from a large mass (planet)?  Further
more, I could not find any reference to SSOMv1 in the Traveller
Big List.  Could anyone provide more info about SSOMv1?

Thanks much.  I\'m sorry if these are stupid questions but I\'m just
trying to get my bearings again.

Oh, and an ironic FYI:

Secondly, about the Traveller CCG, I think it would be a neat twist
(and give the game a chance at product demarkation from the rest :) 
if it could be played by mail or something like that.  Or at least
if it could be played in conjuction with other Traveller products
(i.e. use of Traveller miniatures improves the performances (A la 
Warhammer where you have \'characters\') or you can use \'character\'
cards to perform certain actions during the RPG.  As a help to
role-play or whatever (See \'Castle Falkenstein\' :).

Finally, I wonder if anybody else has done something like this
with their technology?  I expect the new equipment book to have
something
like this, but of course I haven\'t seen it.  This is a partial list
of what I\'ve come up with:  (sorry, LaTeX again :)

\\section{Jane\'s guide to Traveller Equipment}
\\subsection{An explanation of Data Links}
Data Links represents the way different pieces of machinery and
humans
communicate together.  There are several different standards, but
any device using a known standard can share the data on that channel
with any other device with that standard.  Prefixes represents
non-imperial uses (Z for Zhodani, etc), and suffixes represent limits
and variations to the standards.

Here is a list of the known standards and their uses:
\\begin{itemize}
\\item {\\em TAC} Carries tactical data; ennemy number, type and
        position, current device status, current tactic pursued.
\\item {\\em FLICK} Means device can be activated using Zhodani
\'flicking\'
        skill.
\\item {\\em LIFE} Means transmission of lifesign data.
\\item {\\em NAS} is transmission of neural activity data.
\\item {\\em VISU} is visual data.
\\item {\\em AUD} is audio data.
\\item {\\em OLF} is olfactory data.
\\item {\\em VEH} is vehicle location and status.
\\item {\\em I-} stands for imperial standard.  It is there by default
        on Imperial devices.
\\item {\\em Z-} Means a Zhodani variation on the standard.
\\item {\\em -SLO} Means that data trickles at a slow rate, typically
10
        rounds instead of one.
\\item {\\em -S} Means the channel is in send mode only and cannot
receive
        data.
\\item {\\em -R} Means the channel is in receive mode only and cannot
        send data.

Note: When designing equipment, all communication gear has the basic
standards for that equipment (ex: NAS sensors get the NAS-SLO-R mode,
vehicle computers get the VEH-SLO-SR mode).  If a computer is used,
a 2 modifications can use made on a comm channel for each level of
Communication-1 programmed in the computer.  (ex: the above computer 
can be upgraded to ZI-VEH-SR).  It costs 5% of the total device cost
to improve non-computerized comm devices.

Just my 2 credit\'s worth - and who knows what that\'s worth since the
Imperium has failed! :)

Starship Operators Manual v.1 is a MegaTraveller book that was put 
out by Digest Group Publications (DGP).  It\'s kind of a Star Trek 
Technical Manual for Traveller, built around the generic 200 ton free 
trader.  Out of print for a long time, but very worthwhile if you can 
get a copy.  It was not on the big list because the big list 
that Joe and others posted was solely devoted to Classic Traveller.

As for what it says about jumping within 100 diameters it increases 
the difficulty of the task roll. 

By comparison:
Outside of 100 diameters:  
Routine, Engineering, Edu, 2 min.
Routine is a basic 7+ roll to succeed, modified by Engineering and 
Edu.  Assuming a competent engineer, with a good education, this is 
almost automatic in MT. An Engineer-3 with an 8 education succeeds on 
3+. A 96% chance of success.

Inside of 100 diameters:
Difficult, Engineering, Edu, 2 min.
Basic roll is 11+ 
The same engineer listed above, would succeed on a 7+.  About 
a 58% chance of success. 

According to MT, Inside of 10 diameters, the situation gets even 
riskier:
Formidable, Engineering, Edu
Basic roll is 15+
The same engineer listed above, would succeed on an 11+ 
or about an 8% chance of success.

Failure could result in a misjump, or in extreme cases, destruction 
of the ship.

Regarding your comments about CCG\'s.  I\'m not a big fan of them 
either.  However, they are bigger than RPG\'s right now.  If a T4 CCG 
winds up drawing a few more people into wanting to RPG our favorite 
system, and can do so while maintaining the flavor of the overall 
Traveller game...I think it would be worth it.

And that is about the only good thing I\'ve ever said about CCG\'s...

Ah, another person who reads Traveller in public.  I keep waiting for the 
police to notice my dirty little habit of reading little black books in 
mixed company, but so far nothing untoward has happened. :P

	"The Big List of Classic Traveller Products" only lists items 
from the pre-MegaTraveller era, whereas SSOMv1 is a MegaTraveller item.  
Isn\'t there a different list containing MT items provided on one of the 
Traveller web sites?

	Heck, I\'ve been playing Traveller since \'83, and I\'m STILL

Has anybody heard from DGP lately?  I got a couple of posts a few
months back, but nothing since.  I\'d love a chance to get my hands on
a couple of their books that I can\'t find in the used book stores,
SSOM and WBH, in particular.

Roger was talking about reviving some of the DGP books..or putting
them on CD-ROM if he could get permission.  

How about it Rog?  Anything happening?

Here\'s a thought for IG!  I was never bothered about reading the
little black books in public, but the covers of MT & TNE...<g>

I\'d prefer the small form books.  I\'d perfer simple black covers. I
also know that IG\'s not going to give me either preference. The books
will be A4 format and the covers will be..uhmm, let\'s say, colorful.

	Nothing like wearing a three-piece suit while reading something 
that looks very much like a comic book/graphic novel. :)

	Colorful covers are better for merchandizing, I\'m sure, but I 
prefer the little black books as well.  Oh, well.  At least Traveller is 
back, and (hopefully) better than ever. :)

Okay, first of all, this isn\'t my question for the MM interview. I just
wondered if the artwork featured on the Web Page is in the core books for
T4.  Also, I wanted to ask the members of this mailing list what their
preferred name for T4 would be.  It looks like (from the new graphics on IG

excellent choice.  However, I wondered what others thought.

Oh well, indeed! 

If the books are going to be full sized a good idea would be to have
them hole-punched.  That way they could be kept in binders:  

1. protects the books from normal wear and tear

2. errata could be added on loose leaf sheets

3. game/campaign notes could go right into the notebooks.

4. and it\'d be a good way to disguise them in public <g>

Hey, I\'ll bet the Hardbacks will have a colorful dust
jacket, but the hardback itself will likely be fairly plain..hum,
another good reason to get one (or two) of them. <g>

>At least Traveller is  back, and (hopefully) better than ever. :)

I\'ve always maintained that Traveller is more a game spirit than a set
of rules.  The biggest objection I had to TNE was its spirit..it
*felt* more like TW2K than Traveller.  Marc was the man behind the
spirit of the original game, I\'m looking for him to bring the *feel*
back.  

I\'ll change the rules and background around to fit whatever campaign I
run anyway. <g>

Thanks. My reason for introducing this was that I found it difficult to
accept that it had been possible to whip up antipathy against a psionic
minority when there was no psionic minority. I mean, if more than half
the population is able to get some sort of useful psi ability, where\'s
the minority?

Psionic potential is a hereditary characteristic. With +8 for both parents
having psi potential, an individual in an ordinary (neither pro- nor anti-
psionic) will automatically have potential himself. 


William F. Hostman:
> 1) SHouldn\'t it be 4+, not 4- ???

No, you roll 2D if you roll a 2, 3 or 4, you have psi potential. If your
culture has favoured psi for millenia you have potential on 6- and so
forth.

Yes, very true. I hadn\'t considered that, not having had to use this roll
for any Zhodani in my campaign.

It\'s your PCs. If you don\'t want them to have psi powers, who\'s to say you
nay?

I *think* they\'re going to call T4, TRAVELLER.  Maybe officially Marc
Miller\'s TRAVELLER.

I don\'t really care what it\'s name turns out to be, *I* am going to
abbreviate it T4!  Both Ken Whitman and Marc Miller used the T4
abbreviation in posts to the list..shouldn\'t that make it canon?  <g>

Standard abbreviations:  CT, MT, TNE, and T4.  That\'s the ticket!

I\'ve been playing since 1978 or 1979, and have a nearly-complete collection
of GDW and DGP Classic and MegaTraveller products.  I have been working
recently on compiling all of the published information on the Spinward
Marches (up to about Third Imperium Year 1120) into one database, so that,
for example, when my players return to the Efate system, they always find
the planets Enur, Jor, Efate, Solon, Stur, Llun, and Yor Shar.
 
Will the new Traveller product line include computer databases (capable of
being updated) of, at least, this sort of basic astrographic information to
improve campaign consistency?  If not, why not?

Thank you for your kind attention, and good luck.

Lots of products are bigger than RPGs, for porn video for instance but that
doesn\'t make me think that Marc and his cronies should produce t4 porn
flicks.

If IG thinks that producing CCGs is their strength then they should produce

	I\'d prefer if it were simply known as "Traveller," but "Mark

That\'s a good point.  When I think of Traveller, I do think of the feel 
of the game more than anything else.  It has a feel that is different 
from all the old sci-fi books I read, and it is certainly different from 
Star Trek.  But, that\'s MY Traveller, which leads into...

I change rules, too, as those who have seen my "house rules" know. 

And I thought I changed the setting quite a bit as well, until I read 
more of the official material on the Imperium.  We started out with 
nothing more than was in the Deluxe Traveller (Starter Edition), and 
Supplement 3: The Spinward Marches.  My Imperium was a federalist-type 
regime.  They governed happenings that occurred outside of the domain of 
local governments, for the most part.  You didn\'t walk into a starport 
and see clusters of Imperial troops patrolling.  You couldn\'t turn to the 
Imperium to help you overthrow your "oppressive" world-government.  

Mostly, the Megacorps were the ones who were active on multiple worlds 
(ie, one megacorp might be persuaded to finance a revolution, if it had 
some economic interest to do so).  

Pretty original ideas, I thought.

Turns out, of course, that the Imperium IS mostly a trade organization.  
Sure, they go to war with the Heirate, the Solomani, and the Zhodani, but 
they aren\'t even as visible as the least opressive Earth government for 
most citizens.  

So, while I did have a slightly different vision of the Imperium, it 
wasn\'t as far off as I had thought.  

Has anyone made major changes to the Traveller universe?  Have you 
scrapped it entirely and played using your own universe?

Er...I think we\'re in agreement here...overall.  But I have heard 
people who first got lured into the hobby by CCG\'s move on RPG\'s.  If 
a "Good" CCG (whatever that is...), might draw a little bit of young 
blood into the hobby, and in particular into our favorite game, 
this is a good thing...  

Your sarcastic comments remind me of a time about 15-20 years ago 
(Yes, I am showing my age here).  I began as a straight wargamer, and 
remember the sarcastic comments that wargamers had about RPG\'s...  
There were people actively predicting and hoping for the demise of 
D&D, Tunnels and Trolls, Traveller, and the other popular RPG\'s at 
the time.  They viewed the RPG\'s in much the same snide sort of way 
that you regard.  I distinctly remember wargamers belittling Traveller 
when I was in a game store buying the latest supplement release to the 
little black books, back in 1980-1981, and I sure as hell am not going to 
be as closed minded about CCG\'s as they were to me.  Well guess what, 
those 30 somethings are now in their 50\'s, mostly out of the hobby, and 
the hobby has now fallen into our hands as the new generation of 30 
somethings.  CCG\'s are the domain of the teen and early 20 somethings, 
and we\'re the ones belittling them.  

Sorry guys, but if you want RPG\'s to survive as a genre, ragging on 
CCG\'s is not the way to go about it.  Those people playing CCG\'s 
are the folks who will be (or may already be) playing RPG\'s.  If they 
don\'t start playing RPG\'s, the hobby as we know it will die.  RPG 
players as a whole are already graying.  All but 1 of the people who 
played in my campaigns 15 years ago probably haven\'t cracked open 
a book in 10 years.  The rest are married...hell, one of them is DEAD.  
I was probably fortunate to have married somebody who shares almost 
as much of a passion for the hobby as I do, or I would have probably 
been forced out of it a long time ago.

Don\'t get me wrong.  I\'ve never played a CCG,  and it\'d take me a lot 
of convincing to do otherwise, BUT they are here, and they are NOT 
going to go away.  Yes, the CCG craze will die down, and a lot of the 
MTG wannabes will curl up, die and go away, but CCG\'s will never be 
completely gone.  Go into your average game store now.  CCG\'s 
dominate a lot of aisle space, and generate a lot of sales.  Quite a 
few game companies would be gone now if it hadn\'t been for the CCG\'s. 
 GDW was hurt by them because GDW didn\'t see the potential in them.  

I fondly hope to see a T4 card game, IF (and only if) it is well done 
and consistent with the Traveller universe.  Then when I see a guy 
fondling a deck of Traveller cards in a local game store next time, I\'ll see if the 
guy wants to join in a live campaign.  The group I referee now, are 
converted D&D players.  None of them had ever played Traveller before 
they met me, now they don\'t play anything else.  So now I can convert 
MTG players.  

The biggest weakness of the card games is that the game is as big as the deck.  
In an RPG, the only limits are that of the imagination of the referee, and to a 
lesser extent the players.  Let the card game wet their appetite, 
like an egg roll before the entree.  Then get them in a campaign, and 
see how things are really done.  :-)

	Agreed.  But, will it?  I have heard stories of it having 
happened to some people already, but never anything in large numbers.  
Sort of like the wargamers to RPGs migration that happened lo those many 
years ago.  More below . . .

Look at where wargames are now.  They\'re still around, but they\'re a tiny 
niche market.  Will this be the fate of RPG\'s in 20 years?  Will the CCG 
players "backwards migrate" only in small numbers, leaving the bulk of 
gamers in the CCG arena (at least, until /another/ 20 years go by, and 
they\'re standing around the game store scoffing at the then-latest craze)?
What do you think?

I think it won\'t happen that way.  Generally, wargames are difficult to 
learn, time-consuming, and of very specific interest (ie, people that 
like to wargame have an interest in tactics, large-scale combat, etc.).  
RPGs grew out of wargames.  RPGs were somewhat complex (again, 
generally), but open to a lot of interests.  Whether you like combat, 
romance, mysteries, or any situation at all, it could be done in RPGs.  
This broad base of interests brought in a lot more players than had 
wargames.  Some wargamers liked the idea of RPGs (and so migrated to 
them), while many others did not.

Now we have CCGs, which are again interesting to a fairly broad range of 
people.  The major thing they have going for them, though, is simplicity.  
Just about anyone can understand how to play.  That is, the barriers to 
entry are low, wheras RPGs typically require a larger investment of time, 
and have a steeper learning curve.  In short, the CCG\'s are at least as 
different from RPGs as wargames and RPGs are.

The things RPGs have going for them, which wargames did not, are:

1)  Notariety.  Just about everyone has heard of Dungeons and Dragons.  
TSR, love \'em or hate \'em, brings out products targeted to new RPGers, 
and they have the trademark ("D&D") recognition to pull it off.  I saw a 
beginers D&D product at the games store a while back that offered 
simplified rules and a clear upgrade path to AD&D.  There\'s also the old 
Dungeon game, and variants thereof, to get new gamers started on the road 
to full-blown role-playing.

2)  Depth.  You just can\'t get the depth of play you get with an RPG in a 
CCG, a wargame, a dice game (ie, "Dragon Dice) or any of the other RPG 
spin-offs.  

So, while the wargame vs. RPG battle resulted in RPGs 
emerging as dominant, this time around RPGs will remain strong.  As in 
the battle with wargames, RPGs offer something much greater than the 
competition does.  I think RPGs will emerge the winner once again.

	I agree that ragging on CCGs isn\'t the way to ensure the survival 
of RPGs.  But I would restate your second sentence as, "Those people 
playing CCG\'s MAY BE the folks who will be playing RPG\'s."  I really 
don\'t think there is a significant natural crossover between the two game 
types.  CCGs have almost nothing in common with RPGs.  One is a card 
game, one is a storymaking game.  Nonetheless, I would like to see those 
of us in the RPG community reach out to the CCGers, and help them to 
cross over.  As you point out, the RPG community is "greying."  It would 
be nice to have thousands of new role-players.  Especially Traveller 
role-players.

	I would also like to see a T4 card game if it is done right.  In 
addition to the consistency issue you point out, I would like for there 
to be a clear path for players to follow in upgrading to the real thing.  
I have no idea, off the top of my head, of how this would be done.  But 
it is important to make sure the card players are not kept as a separate 
audience, but rather eventually folded into the role-playing population.  
In order for this to happen, the card players have to see a clear and 
strong connection between their card game and the RPG.  Something more 
than a name and a setting.  The card game has to retain the full flavor 
of the Traveller game.  Again, I don\'t now how (or if) this can be done, 
but if it is possible, and if it is implemented, I would welcome a 
Traveller CCG.

I ran my Traveller Universe in the Andromeda Galaxy. The basic history of
it was that the Solomani discovered some kind of capability to travel the
space between galaxies (the tech was irrelevant as I will explain below). 

The capability to travel between galaxies disappeared and the Solomani were
trapped in the galaxies they colonized. The Solomani brought their superiority
theories with them and started to enslave the "aliens" they found there. This 
went on until they lost a war against some "aliens" . At the present time
the Solomani Civilization in Andromeda consists of several clusters of worlds
separated by alien powers and worlds that decided to secede from the Solomani
Federation and trade with aliens.

Hi there

>Modern republican democracies have proven the most stable means of
>governing modern industrial economies.

No, they haven\'t been disproven, which is different.  The so called
"Communist" governments functioned for decades, and until they fell,
there was no "proof" that they didn\'t work.  When they did collapse,
the apparent corruption and disregard for the people in the system was
as much to blame as the (mis)appropriated tennants.  Before all you
right wingers flame me, I\'d agree that Marx was wrong on many counts,
for example I believe he predicted that the more liberal governments
of western Europe would fall to people\'s revolutions before the more
oppresive ones in eastern Europe.  I\'m just pointing out that there is
no evidence that Modern republican (I live in a non-republican Kingdom
BTW) [capitalist] democracies are the most stable forms of government.
Most nations in history have been governed in other ways.  I believe
that the two oldest democratic republics (France & USA?) have only
been around for 250 years or so (I may well be wrong there, history
not being my strong point).

Sorry to rant so, but when the eastern European governments fell, I
had to listen to my country\'s idiot Prime Minister claim the "death of
socialism" and the "triumph of capitalism" on the eve of a series of
crises which could easily have lead to WW III (and still could)!

Well, yes, but what about Isaac Asimov and Poul Anderson, to name but
two.

A monarchical empire is only one of the possible forms of large scale
interstellar government postulated in Traveller.  The Zhodani have the
democratic consuls, the Solomani have the representation of
nation-states, the First Imperium was run by coalitions of powerful
oligarchs, the Second Imperium by essentially a military junta.  The
Third Imperium claims its form of government is superior, and colours
history to suggest a) its predecessors were more like it than they
truely were and b) their Human competitors are either less successful
(the Solomani) or use distasteful methods (the Zhodani).  Of course,
successful alternate alien forms of government don\'t count, because
they are aliens!

Another reason for a feudal system is that it allows local nobles to

>Has anyone made major changes to the Traveller universe?  Have you 
>scrapped it entirely and played using your own universe?

The last few campaigns I\'ve run, and this covers several years, have
been set during *a* long night.  I refuse to call it *the* long night,
because the future in my games is mutable.

Two of them were in what I guess would be called pocket empires: The
New Terran Empire (NTE) and the Confederation of Acton Systems (CSA). 
The feel is very Classic Traveller, but the scope is smaller.  The
"Nation" the PC\'s belong to, in both cases, is less than a subsector. 
Both are bordered by neighbors ranging from hostile to cautiously
indifferent, and large un-explored areas.

There is true exploration, because the characters (and the players)
have no idea what they will find in systems outside their small home
area.  Their neighbors are known more in story than reality, and
travelling is a constant learning experience. The CSA adventures have
been more mercantile in nature, and the NTE more military oriented.

I\'m going to use the CSA background for a PBEM on the Fido
SF&ANIME_RPG starting this summer.  I\'ll use rules-hidden CT to start
and try to slide into T4 when it comes out.

The other setting I\'ve used recently, I guess ran the first episodes
in \'89, was completely different.  I wanted to put the PC\'s in a
variety of different environments, and to keep them off-balance.

It started with the PC\'s on a hospital ship as patients being carried
in statis.  The PC\'s know *none* of this:  the ship is damaged,
mis-jumps, the crew aboard dies, and the AI travels at sub-light to
the nearest system that its records show has a Navy base.  Now after
several thousands of years the AI awakens the least injured of the
patients, It has been unable to raise anybody at the base on radio, it
needs human assistance to land, and besides it only has another few
weeks of power.

The PC\'s wake, totally disoriented with disjointed memories. They
aren\'t too badly hurt, but they do have injuries that somebody has to
deal with.  They are naked and very confused on an almost dead ship,
with an AI that is already very flakey (no, not Virus this idea
pre-dates Virus), and they\'ve got to figure out what\'s going on.  How
did they get here?  What happened to the ship?  The crew?  The base? 
Where are they..the ship says one thing, but the star charts say
another?  There\'s also a time constraint..waking them up has drained
the ship\'s power, and the other 47 injured patients will die in a
matter of days unless something is done!

I\'ve never been able to play this whole scenario through.  The group I
ran it with spent several sessions on the Hospital ship, and a couple
more exploring the system looking for the Navy base the AI assured
them was there...then the group broke up, and we didn\'t get to do any
more.

I guess my scenarios are generally fairly Traveller-isk.  But my
technology has always been different.  <g> I\'ve never been able to use
*any* official design system..I have to roll my own.

For in system travel I never used thruster plates, or HEPLaR, I use a
drive system based around a screw turning in "hyper-space." It can
accelerate a ship to 10 to 20 million kph almost instantly, with
continued power needed to maintain speed. 

Jumps are handled differently.  A ship can only jump while several AU
away from a star, and only leave jump space very close to a star (or
other massive body). No jumping to empty space, no in system jumps. 
The amount of time in jump space isn\'t fixed, but is *never* less than
4 or 5 days, even for a Jump1, and time in Jump changes based on Tech
level of the equipment.

Engineering, Astrogation, and Piloting skills allow you to *attempt*
jumps greater than the equipment rates.  This means a Jump2 ship with
a *cracker-jack* crew can succeed at Jump3 most of the time and
occasionally at Jump4, but failure is punished severely.  <g> The
quality of sensors and their use (Astrogation), the condition and
tuning of the jump field coils (Engineering), and the skill of the
pilot keeping the ship in the "jump window" until you "go bingo" all
affect how a ship performs.

Computers are *very* low-powered (like CT), with a rational
explanation for their for their large size and slow speed. Conta-grav
technology absolutely wreaks microelectronic devices. Everything

Well actually, if things go the way they did with RPG\'s we will see 
the end of the craze period, and many of these people will talk 5 years 
from now about how they used to play Magic: The Gathering, kind of 
like people who I talk to now speak about how they used to play 
D&D... :-)

I agree.  But 1 thing about CCG\'s.  They have dragged a lot of new 
people into the local shops in my area.  None of whom were interested 
in playing Advanced Squad Leader, and none of whom had a whole lot of 
idea what an RPG is or if they did, have misconceptions.  Some of 
these people might be interested in RPG\'s.  I think that the CCG\'s at 
their best, are probably at least as close to RPG\'s as they were to 
wargames.

I just think that the core age of the RPG player is graying a little 
bit, and a little more open attitude (kind of like a venus fly trap) 
about CCG\'s might draw a few players.

I guess what I was trying to say is that a significant number of 
future RPG\'ers could find their way into the hobby initially through 
CCG\'s.  When I bought my original Traveller books, I had no idea what 
it was.  I thought it was some sort of personal combat rules, with a 
spacey background thrown in.  The cover looked interesting, the 
description of the game on the back looked interesting, so I bought 
it.

Good point...

There are several members on Marc Miller\'s staff, including Marc himself 
that have experience designing both CCG\'s and RPG\'s.  If its going to work, 
they\'ll figure it out.  But I\'d have a hard time figuring it out to.

It seems that in the original publication of 2300 and in the early Challenge

were the dominant powers on (and off) Earth, with America being a second 
rate power with just a few offworld potentials.

Is this what was intended?

The second edition (2300AD) and later publications and magazine articles
seemed to focus more on American ascendency, with America poised to take
over the reins over power from France. 

Why the shift? Was it purely for marketting, pandering to American
consumers?

For instance, the way that the NetRunner CCG can be used as part of the

few other CCGs are selling quite well.

That said, the vast majority of CCGs are not.  And many game stores (as 
well as an increasing number of distributors) won\'t even give them a chance.
Stores and distributors, while making money hand-over-fist on Magic, often 
lost big when they tried to pick up every CCG on the market.  As the 
bubble starts to burst, I think we\'ll see some stores go down -- and 
there are disturbing rumors about some distributors as well.  (An unusual 
number of them aren\'t paying their bills on time.  By a lot.)  As a 
result, people have become a lot more conservative about getting involved 
with new CCGs.  They\'re a risk.

Would T:tCCG make it on to the shelves?  Perhaps.  It\'s a name well-known 
to people in the field -- but, alas, generally associated of late with 
slow sales of TNE material.  It\'s hard to say, but I really don\'t think 
the market is there.

I\'m also a long-time gamer (started wargaming 20 years ago or so).  One 
strange thing about Magic is that, unlike D&D, it may not spawn a whole 
new hobby.  After buying the D&D books, you could still *afford* 
Traveller, C&S, Runequest, and the rest.  If you\'re seriously involved in 
Magic, it\'s difficult to support other CCG habits properly...

What did the players do in this setting?  Did they travel between planets 
much, or was it mostly concentrated on a single world or in a single 
solar system?  In other words, what was the flavor of you campaign?

And, perhaps more importatly, did the Traveller system help you in 
running this campaign, or did you end up changing a lot of rules?

The Traveller system originally claimed to be for use in any sci-fi 
setting, but of course they only developed one: the Imperium.  I don\'t 
regret any of my Traveller campaigns, but sometimes I wanted to run at 
least a few sessions in a setting like Piers Anthony\'s "Cluster" series.  
But, the players enjoyed the Imperium setting enough that they never 
wanted to experiment with another.

Except for the TNE hiatus, Traveller has always been Marc Miller\'s; when 
I first laid eyes on a copy, back in 1978, his name was right there on the 
title page.  A name for a version should make a useful distinction, and 
this one doesn\'t.  (The phrase "Marc Miller\'s Traveller" *does* make a 
useful distinction between TNE and everything else, arguably.)

Note that I\'m not arguing against saying "Marc Miller\'s Traveller" on the

billing as authors of novels do.  (Plus, IG may get the marketing benefit 
of the distinction in the last sentence above.)  I\'m just saying that 
"MMT" is a silly way for us to distinguish between versions on line.

This is very similar to the premise behind the "Exordium" series of books by 
Sherwood Smith and Dave Trowbridge.  A number of people escaped from an AI 
rebellion/war through some sort of wormhole to a distant part of the galaxy 
(or maybe a different galaxy, I\'m not sure the books specified), where they 
set up a very Imperium-like government.  This is a _great_ series of books 
which would make a wonderful RPG setting -- I hope Steve Jackson decides to do 
it for GURPS at the very least.

The series consists of (so far) The Phoenix in Flight, Ruler of Naught, A 
Prison Unsought, and The Rifter\'s Covenant.

The Albedo RPG uses jumps like this -- its salient features are:
** the ship has to push off a gravity well to get any significant range;
** if you try to jump in system, it will "push you halfway to the next star";
** you can jump from empty space, but the jumps are very short;
** gravity wells also pop you out of jumpspace at your destination, so aim
   carefully;
** the length of jumps is limited because ships can only remain in jumpspace
   for a few seconds, because once the ship becomes stabilized in jumpspace
   anything with an atomic number higher than carbon has a tendency to
   spontaneously fission;
** if you jump too close to a gravity well, you have a tendecy to "leave
   particles behind", resulting in anything from detectable subatomic erosion
   through the complete destruction of the ship.

Very cool system, first published in _Vortex_, later added to either Albedo 2e 
or the Albedo Ship Construction Manual.

Reminds me of a story I read where the limiting factor was that you couldn\'t 
shed any excess heat during FTL travel.  This worked out well for the 
protagonists, who were pure humans in a culture increasing dominated by 
cyborgs.

This is the type of campaign my fiancee would love.  We\'ve tried the 
Imperium a few times, but the setting seems rather bland to her.  She is 
interested mostly in doing world exploration with little combat.

Sounds like /I/ would like adventures in the CSA. :)  I\'ve never been 
able to find a group to run a mercantile campaign in. 

Your setting seems very well developed.  Did you develop most of it prior 
to the first adventure, or did you make it up as you went along (ie, 
between sessions or (my favorite) during the sessions)?

Do you have them frequently replacing tubes, or has the problem of tube

Huh?  The NTE couldn\'t get a working weapon within a million miles of the 
PC\'s ship is what you meant, right?  Or did I not understand the whole 
technology/artifical gravity interaction?

True.  My best friend and I tried several wargames and got rapidly bored 
with the required attention to minutia.  Then we bought some 
computer-based wargames by SSI and Microprose (back in the good ol\' 8-bit 
computer days, BTW) and fell in love with them.  Decision in the Desert 
by Microprose is still on of my favorite computer games.  Since I didn\'t 
have to do all those calculations and rules-references myself, I could 
just enjoy the strategy aspect of the game.  I wish the great GDW games 
had come out on computer.  Maybe Marc Miller will someday translate 
his own wargames for us. :)

Maybe someday RPG\'s will be best played on computers.  Nah. :)

And 10 years after /that/, those same people will be desparately buying 
up M:TG cards at prices quadruple those of today in order to "recapture" 
the feeling they had "back then." :)

This is a good point, and I hadn\'t thought about it much.  For some 
reason, I keep associating CCGs with comic book stores and more 
generalized games stores (ie, the ones that sell Parker Brothers games, 
puzzles, etc. and have a small selection of RPGs sort of thrown in).  
You\'re right, considering that CCGs are sold in the same places that RPGs 
are, there is the potential for crossover.

And you\'ve regretted it ever since, right? :P  Seriously, it\'s 
interesting how we get into these things on rather haphazard basis, yet 
they affect our lives so greatly.  No warning.  You just happen to pick 
up a game because it looks interesting (even though you have the wrong 
idea about it), and then it starts taking over your life.  
Hey, that sounds like a good sci-fi scenario! :)

Oh!  I didn\'t know that.  Well, then I\'ll have high hopes for whatever 
CCG (if any) comes out of the IG workshop.

Just two:

1) It could be simply attributed to anti-CCG prejudice on my part, but I 
rather dislike the idea of using cards in an RPG.

2) On the other hand, this is the first clear upgrade path I\'ve heard of, 
so if no other emerges it may indeed be the way to go.  I guess what I am 
saying is that there may be no way to both keep the two systems apart AND 
provide a clear upgrade path.

Good point!

This is a scary time for several industries, all of which are tied 
together.  Marvel pulled out of the normal distribution network and 
created its own, which made things harder on the comic shop owners.  
Generally, the comics industry is now doing worse and worse for a variety 
of reasons (best discussed elsewhere, I know).  Comics shops generally 
also carry CCGs and RPGs.  Since many shops went out onto a limb buying 
CCGs just before the market started to decline, this put another strain 
on those shops, as you said.  All of this affects the distribution of 
RPGs in comic shops (which, of course, are far more numerous than RPG 
stores, although they carry a smaller selection of RPGs).  This, in 
turn, can cause (has caused?) a downturn in the RPG industry.

Again, good point.  It might get onto the shelves, but it would almost 
certanly be buried by the huge M:TG marketing machine.

That\'s true.  In the early RPG days, most of the people I knew - even the 
ones who were D&D die-hards - owned a few other games.  If this isn\'t 
happening in the CCG world, it could certainly make the whole thing turn 
out to be a fad.  Or, something like the Rubik\'s Cube - sure, there are 
still such puzzles sold (mostly permutations of the original cube), but 
it\'s not a craze of any sort as it was in the early years.

Food for thought.  Thanks for posting it.

I suppose the safest course would be to do as has been said before, and 
find a way to welcome CCGers to the RPG world - without releasing a 
Traveller CCG.  Get them hooked on a better drug, in other words. ;)

I don\'t know that I would call America a second-rate power in 2300AD. True,
the US wasn\'t as pre-eminent as it is today (or the past 50 or so years),
but in the multipolar world of 2300AD it was certainly in the top 5. The
three arms of space explored by humanity were the Chinese, American, and
French.

France\'s arms of space, which the Germans had followed, was the most
plentiful resource-wise. The trouble the French had was those pesk Kafer
appearing at the end of the line. For some reason GDW put a Texan colony
there too, which made no since to me except as "flavor".

China had a fairly dead area of space. As I recall, their trouble mostly
was pilots. They also had the worlds of the oldest alien civilization (the
Eber, I believe). Never got into the Chinese arm too much.

The American problem is that they had a dead *end* in space. Using the FTL
technology in the game, the American arm couldn\'t push any further.

France\'s ascendancy stems from the fact that 2300 was in the same
chronology as Twlight:2000. France stayed out of the war, secured the Rhine
as a natural border, and was not quite as bad off as the rest of the
once-civilized world.

I\'d say part of it was due to maret pandering, but there were canonical
reasons as well. By the 24th century America was finally recovering the
power and prestige it once had. The French were slacking off a bit after
about a hundred years of primacy, and during the Kafer war Britain and
American were both helping to bail out the French.

This goes back to my point about the CCG market being saturated a few 
days ago.  MTG will almost certainly survive...most of the 
others...well probably not in the long run.

Actually IG is going to have an uphill battle just getting them to 
stock Traveller books and supplements.  Hate to say it, but since 
MegaTraveller (can you say Megaton bomb), a couple of the local shops 
are reluctant to stock too much of anything with the Traveller name.  
Ken, Marc & company are going to have to do a lot to break down 
resistance at the distributor and local level to have much success.  

I think a lot of the anti-Traveller hostility was probably more aimed 
at GDW, but it will still be an uphill battle.  If we want this thing 
to have a serious chance, we will have to make our feelings known at 
the local level.

1. What the heck is the Wounds column for?  The description of 
   the table (page 30) talks about the Wound Modifier column,
   which is basically the effect of size on the weapon\'s damage.
   So, if I have a 1600 kg creature that has claws as a weapon,
   the hits it inflicts will be 2 + 2D.  So why is there a
   Wounds column?

2. Combatants generally have two "damage" values which are derived
   from their life force.  The first is the number of hits to
   unconsciousness and the second is the number of hits to death
   once the combatant is unconscious.

   In the Animal Weight Effects table, there is a Hits column which,
   according to the description on page 30, "indicates the number of
   hits an animal can take".  Fine.  It then goes on to say

	When an animal has received wounds equaling (sic) or 
	exceeding the first number, the animal is unconscious.  When
	it has received wounds equaling (sic) or exceeding the
	second number, it is dead.

   What second number?  Is this the purpose of the Wounds column?
   If so, that column is incorrectly named.

Your advice is appreciated.

There were several types of games. First of all, there was usually a task
on planet to complete followed by a few planetary jumps. 

There was one game which was primarily a mercenary game. While the Solomani
were putting all of their forces towards fighting the war with the aliens, 
the Solomani and megacorps needed more troops to put down rebellions and
protect their interests. This game took place during the war. 

The postwar games became more interesting for a few reasons: 
	1. The solomani never saw the enemy. The enemy just stopped attacking
	after awhile and placed ships in orbit of planets they wanted, 
	water worlds. So there were some games when players tried to rescue
	persons/resources from water worlds without being noticed. Some 
	players tried to develop some form of methods for getting past alien
	ships. Some were successful. 

	2. Many planets/megacorps stopped supporting the Human Superiority 
	theory and broke away from the Federation. There was a merchant 
	campaign based on trading between the newly independent worlds. One 
	long running plot in this game was when the players got involved in 
	an attempt to set up a trading post deep in the frontier. 

	3. Another campaign that I ran in this scenario when I could not 
	think of something else was to find the "Andromeda" the oldest and
	last remaining Galaxy Jumper which was rumoured to be seen in orbit 
	of "X". 

As for your second question, the rules. 

Classic Traveller was useful for doing this for several reasons. First of
all, it provided a norm for players to go by. This was the rules by which 
the Solomani did things etc. This allowed me to create a truly alien effect
when they ran into things like Energy Transport and disintegrators. 

I thought the Trade Rules however were rather dry in that the boiled it 
all down to rolls instead of role play. 

Megatraveller made my job alot harder because it seemed harder to extract
Imperium out of the rules.

True.  I\'m glad they are going back to a separation between the rules and 
the setting.  I think the ultimate Traveller rules presentation was the 
Traveller Book.  If IG comes out with something like that (minus the info 
on the Imperium, preferably), it will be a winner.  I think clearly 
distinguishing between the rules and the setting is something that has 
been lost in RPGs of late.  Every RPG I look at has a single book with 
the setting intermingled with the rules, so that the GM is almost forced 
to use the official setting.  I\'d like to see a move away from that.

	As a long time lurker on both lists who has enjoyed many flavors
of Traveller over the years, I would like to put my ten cents into this.
I have run several successful campaigns in a variety of settings, some
"canonical" (how I am growing to loathe that term), some based on works of
fiction or movies, and some of my own creation.
	I have always stuck to the core combat and skill rules of CT, with
some custom enhancements over the years.  I stress roleplaying and a rich
background over detailed combat and fleet operations (though those have
occurred aplenty too at times).  What I find interesting in designing an
alternate campaign setting is how the choice of technology implementations
and the rules thereof (jump drives and their restrictions, communication
means, etc)effects the history and culture of a campaign.
	Traveller is an excellent game, and the Imperium future-history is
a well documented and richly detailed campaign setting.  With some
variation on the technologies though alternate settings can easily be
given a very unique flavor.  Take the example given before where jumps
*always* take a variable amount of time.  If I read that right, the
implications for large scale fleet actions are dramatic.  It would be much
harder, if not impossible, to sychronize large scale surprise attacks.
With a window of days in which all the ships in a given fleet would arrive
in a target system, it gives the defenders a great advantage in repelling
the first waves of an attack.
	Alternate means of FTL communication in non Imperium settings can
be interesting as well.  For example, in a culture where psionics flourish
perhaps a means of interstellar telepathy could enable people to send
messages faster than jumps could travel.  This would in turn create the
potential for a powerful social class of psions, with variable
implications based on other campaign factors.  Another example of psion
dependance could be ala Herbert\'s _Dune_, where psionic navigators are
required in order for jumps to operate.
	The point is , Traveller is at its heart such a playable, simple
gaming system that with some forethought and a little imagination, a huge
variety of alternate settings can be created should one so choose.
	That being said, give me a suped up Type S scout, a small pension,
and a laser rifle anyday, exploring the frontiers of "canonical" Imperial
space ;-)  I\'ve had alot of fun with some alternate universe settings, but
the best has always been the original for me.

Miller.  In addition to sending it to Ken for the interview, I\'m sending 
it to the xboat list to get reaction from my fellow Travellers:

Will T4 include provisions for solitaire play, as did CT?  Not only 
tables and charts, but an explicit statement (as was included in all the 
CT versions) that Traveller is suitable for solo play - and the necessary 
game-mechanics follow-through on that.


I was just sitting at my RPG table, rolling up characters, and realized 
how much I use Traveller on a solitaire basis.  I essentially do all the 
things the Traveller Book suggests a referee do: create characters, 
generate worlds, make starships and small craft, engage in trade, engage 
in personal combat, engage in starship combat, etc.  I also detail 
cultures and worlds using DGP\'s "Grand Census" and "Grand Survey."  

I\'d really like to see T4 continue this ability for solitaire play.  
Sure, you can do combat and character generation in /any/ RPG system.  
But the variety of things Traveller provides systems for allows for a 
much broader solo experience.  And, it\'s very satisfying, IMO.  Nothing 
like having a group of players, but it certainly is wortwhile when that 
is not possible.

Does anyone else enjoy the solo aspects of Traveller?

Did you do all these with a single group, or did each group of players 
stick to a single setting throughout your relationship with them?

	Yes!  Thinking it through, in other words.  You don\'t just put a 
gadget in there because it is neat (or leave something out for a 
similarly silly reason).  You explain why it is there,and you think about 
the effect it will have on the society and the course of history.  
Excellent!

	Exactly.  I hope IG continues this simplicity and playability.  
While CT grew from three little black books to a multitude of products by 
many authors and companies, the core rules always retained the original 
simiplicity.  Even The Traveller Book, the most complete set of CT rules, 
really contains little more than the three black books and some 
supplementary notes on how to play the game (including some adventures 
and detail on the Imperium setting).  The core rules were simple and 
short.  That is the way an RPG should be.  Simplicity at the core, with 
expanding complexity as the GM and players demand it.  That pleases 
everyone, and makes for a rich gaming experience.

Sounds good, but I\'d prefer a subsidized trader and good friends at my 
side, plying the space lanes in search of the big score. :)

1) The CCG market is *flooded* with games.  Try convincing a distributor
or retailer to sink money into *yet another* "new CCG" that will sit on
his shelves taking up valuable space and not turning around as fast as
MTG.  If you can\'t get your product to the distributors and retailers,
you\'re out of business.  

2) Illuminati (by Steve Jackson Games) is a classic game of conspiracy
(just as Traveller is a classic RPG of science fiction).  Yet, Illuminati:
New World Order (INWO), their CCG version of Illuminati, isn\'t moving
worth beans, from what I can see.  (Don\'t get me wrong; I love INWO.  It\'s
a damn fine CCG.)  Every time I check my mail, I get another catalog for a
store that sells singles on the CCG after-market, and they\'re selling INWO
at a discount!  Just because Traveller is a good RPG doesn\'t mean that a
Traveller CCG will sell.  

3) I doubt IG has the financial strength, at this time, to adequately
support T4 (the RPG) with regular supplements *and* do a Trav:CCG.  Maybe
in a couple of years, once they get off the ground and running, but not
now.  In that case, I, as a long-time fan of the Traveller line, would
rather see a strong support of T4, and *maybe* a Trav:CCG in a few years.

No, I did not replace it with a system. I simply figured out what was
needed on different worlds and roleplayed the trading. As a DM one of the 
fun things is playing different personalities and having the players do 
it to. 

I used some of the trade rules to determine availability of goods and 
so forth, but the players had to roleplay rather than just roll against
broker skills.

Unfortunately Challenge went the way of GDW with issue 77 being its last

I\'ve always explained the coexistence of Liberal forms of government at the
local level and feudalism at the interstellar by imagining the Imperium as
a customs union with a navy. The Imperium has no direct jurisdiction over
most planets; it merely provides a set of rules for trade, defense against
outside threats, and a common currency. In exchange, it imposes relatively

As I mentioned before, I never got the chance to run much of a trading 
game, as my players were interested in other things.  But, I did much the 
same thing as you whenever the players puchased equipment.  

For instance, Stacy\'s Outfitters was a favorite store in one campaign.  
She could get lots of things that weren\'t commonly available, but never 
on special order.  She just had what she had when you went in, and you 
never knew in advance that that might be, aside from the general 
selection that was always there.  

And, Stacy would dicker over the price of special items, while holding 
sales on some of the normal stock.  Depending on whether she knew the 
players needed something badly (and her mood!), the players might get a 
good deal, or they might walk out with a new item...but not the shirt on 
their backs. :)

Eventually, Stacy grew to such importance that she became the focus of an 
adventure, wherein suddenly her store was gone, and in its place was 
"Nunzio\'s Pawn Shop."  The players took it upon themselves to find out 
what happened to her, and to help her regain her business.  It was a lot 
of fun for me, too. :)

I never liked the idea of players grabbing the rule book and picking the 
equipment they purchase, using list prices.  Doing it the real way was 
much more fun.

Man!  You two just gave me such a rush. <g>  

How about a compromise?  A bunch of layed off ex-somebodies in an old

That sounds like the same method I use.  Making up a lot of detail in 
advance never appealed to me nor to my players.  Yet, a total lack of 
preparation doesn\'t work very well either. :)  Usually, I\'d do what you 
outline above, then between sessions I would make some notes as to what 
new things are going to happen, what things will build on past 
occurances, etc. - but nothing too detailed.  Just something like "NPC 
Jim is still mad at Scardin, and has decided to do something to get back 
at him."

Maps of cities, starports, and buildings were almost all done on-the-fly, 
while the larger maps (nations and worlds) were done before-hand.

Heh.  A friend of mine played in a campaign wherein the PC\'s wanted a 
ship really bad, but didn\'t have the cash.  The ref designed a ship 
using what amounted to a lawmower motor (with pull-string and all) that 
was very prone to breakdowns.  He enjoyed that campaign a lot.  I 
remember him telling me about a ship coming after them, and his character 
is desparately pulling on the starter cord, trying to get the damned 
thing to turn over. :)  Anachronistic, sure, but fun nonetheless.

Comic relief is important when dealing with the heavy subjects.  From 
complete light-hearted scenarios such as you outline above, to little 
strokes of humor in otherwise serious situations (such as one powerful 
and ruthless enemy the players had, whose name was "Richard Hedd, but 
don\'t call him Dick." :P

Has anyone else had successful comic Traveller scenarios?  Want to tell 
us about them?

	Okay, usually I would be the last person to defend CCGs, but I
wonder if it would not be a good way to bring in some money which would
support the RPG side of things?  That\'s the way I see it:  a sideline to
make some money to support the important stuff :-).  Others have expressed
fears that the CCG would lose money, but I have to wonder how much it
costs to develop a CCG.  Aren\'t they cheap enough to produce that even
modest sales bring returns?  I thought that was the reason for the CCG
craze in the first place: low overhead.  Of course, I\'m speaking from a
position of zero experience here, so feel free to correct me.  It\'s just
that I can\'t see them taking that much time in terms of rules design,
playtesting and so on (though the artwork might take a while). 

What do y\'all think?

Try GURPS :) Or, if that\'s not your speed, the Hero System is pretty good too.

Some of each.  I have been playing Traveller since 78, and over the last
18 years have played with several groups and individuals.  I actually have
one campaign that is essentially 17 years old, a "canonical" one.

I have seen the end result of campaigns that lack such forethought.  The
implications of historical events and core technologies are what decide
the flavor of a given universe.

Here is a brief example of an alternate campaign setting that proved to be
popular:

Jump technology consisted of linear FTL travel, not a "jump" per se.  The
technology was gained from the 1947 crash of a UFO in Roswell, New Mexico
(I know I know, and just think, I came up with this *years* before
conspiracy theorism became popular!).  My campaign started in the year
2090, and humanity was (semi) unitied and had colonized about two dozen
nearby worlds.  They are at war with the aliens, who had wanted to
colonize earth but didn\'t act fast enough, undestimating our ability to
duplicate their technology.  The aliens (known as \'Bug Eyes\' colloquially)
were not prepared for war, having never had to fight another species of
even close to their technology.

Ships in transit at FTL speeds can be detected via standard sensors.
Typical speeds are from .5 to 1.5 light years per day.  Most ships in this
campaign are small (under 2000 ton), at least the terrans.  The aliens had
much better power sources so could field larger ships (aka "motherships").
Speeds fall into "bands" in .5 ly/day increments, so courses can be
matched at FTL speeds.

FTL Communication was fixed at 1.5 ly/day unless a message was taken in
the fastest of ships (2.5 ly/day).

Maneuver drives were thruster plate type drives.

Terrans did not initially have full anti gravity, but it was fully
developed early in the campaign by ambitious PC\'s.

Typical weapons for the terrans were particle beams and lasers, for the
aliens neutral particle beams and phased energy beams (yes, phasers, ok, I
was 16 when  I did this).  Missiles were used only by terrans and were
thermonuclear in nature.  Fighters used mass drivers, with the larger ones
sporting lasers.

Anyways, this campaign went on over about 100 years of campaign time, with
three sets of characters (same players).  It culminated with the discovery
of force field technology, the technology for which was stolen by the PC\'s
and helped tip the balance and force a truce.  It had a unique flavor, not
quite Traveller but still with that same hard edge that I have come to
like from "canonical" traveller.  Communication and travel were just
different enough to give the universe a whole different dynamic.

Thanks,

Actually, I play Hero System (the only other RPG I play anymore).  But I 
prefer Traveller, and hope they do what I suggested. :)

Wow.  That 17-year-old campaign, if it is with the same group of players 
it started with, must be some sort of record!

Man, that sounds like quite an epic campaign.  I love hearing about the 
creative ideas people come up with.  

I never had a single campaign nearly as long as that.  The longest 
campaign in terms of hours played must have been somewhere around 200 
hours (done over a two-week period in the summer after 9th grade, playing 
every day for most of the day).  Traveller campaigns done in weekly 
sessions lasted for a few months, for the most part.

Only one original player due to geographic changes.  My brother has some
ten year old+ characters still in that campaign.

It definitly had an epic flavor, the terrans were basically fighting to
survive, to avoid extinction.  I like hearing about other\'s ideas too, and
it is better once in awhile than constant bickering over what is canon or
not 8->

Maybe, but probably somene will use this form of storage for "multimedia

Has anyone ever consireded the prices of everyday wares in Traveller? I 
have MT and TN, and they both list very accurately the cost of a lid of a 
bullet clip, but nowhere is any reference to normal food, clothes etc. 
This amazes me, because almost every fantasy game I have played lists 
these things ... perhaps they have food automats at every corner in 
Traveller..

Well, I shall be the first to admit that the MT animal encounter tables =
are a little unpenetrable. With a little work and the help from some TD =
Q&As I have managed to make the tables make sense to me, though.

The hits column is how many hits the animal can take before it goes =
unconciuos. The wounds column is how many _additional_ hits it can take =
before it dies. The wound modifier column is a modifier for how much =
_damage_ the animal gives. Remember that base damage is determined in =
the Animal Weaponry table (Table 8).

Subject: One more alternate setting...

How\'s this for a campaign setting:
(tongue in cheek mode entered)

Seven people take a yacht (Type Y) on what is ostensibly a 3 hour tour of
the system.  Well, the ion storms started getting rough, the tiny ship was
tossed.  Heck, if not for the courage of its fearless crew it\'d probably
have been lost.

Anyways, the yacht crashes on a remote planet in the system, and the PC\'s
have to survive with whatever they can get their hands on.  The planets
one saving grace is these strange, round, wooklike fruits that can be made
into paddles, electrical generators, just about anything, by the
Scientist.

The other PC\'s would include a merchant captain, his first mate, and
entertainment star, a Noble and his wife, and a downhome girl from the
homeworld.  They would have to fight to survive while awaiting rescue.

I won\'t vouch for this 100%, as I haven\'t actually seen the article, but a
friend of mine who has a *very* large collection of Traveller stuff swears that
he saw (*somewhere*) a comment to the effect that it came from the Julian
Protectorate (the large state off to the northeast of all those maps of the
Imperium). Until Marc answers, perhaps that will do?

It is one half of Double Adventure 1.  It was the first Traveller mini-adventure.  Originaly published in Journal of the Travellers Aid Society (JTAS #1 -- I think), it is the story of a group of adventurers discovering a very alien ship that had been popping up in places and disappering.  However
it appears that no one is aboard.

It is a classic....

>Has anyone else had successful comic Traveller scenarios?  Want to
>tell us about them?

Well, this wasn\'t anything so complete as a scenario, but a few weeks
back when I was feeling uninspired as to what to hit the PCs with at
the next port of call, I decided to play out their interaction with
their passengers to a greater extent than I would usually.  The
passengers were a Marine Captain, a Computer Consultant, and a
travelling Crenduthaar (the big, ugly race from one of the MT
Digests).  The Marine Captain was a successful free-lance mercenary
and security consultant, and she found the Crendu fascinating, while
Mr Computer Specialist was rather tedious, and prone to getting drunk.
Also, he found the Crendu (who called himself Indiana) terrifying.  Oh
yes, also onboard were some Anolas (ship\'s pets) and a Vargr
crewmember (the Crendu have a pathalogical hate of Vargr).  While
nothing very specific happened, I played Indiana loud and funny
(modelled on the guy in the office next to mine, as it happens), and
generally had fun confusing the crew, soaking the steward in drinks,
driving the Vargr into a foaming fit, and demonstrating some of the
Anola\'s powers.  The result was a few hours role playing with very
little preparation from me, and lots of fun on all sides.

We had a game once where one of the players rolled until he got a character
whos UPP was: 23248C (or something similar).  He had gone through Navy Medical and ended up an admrial doctor/surgon type.  His last name was "Toehead"  The player took him through like 8 terms until the stats were that low.  Needless to say, he played the bumbling oaf type (similar to General Half-track from Beetle Bailey).  His quest in life was to seek out "Live Terran Crustations"  (Maine Lobsters).   It offered us quite a bit of comic relief at times.

We had another campaign with a Sgt. Gordon Chumway (of ALF fame).  During his Army career, he had spent quite a bit of time in the Army Hosptial and detested white walls.  Many credits were spent on spray paint, and legal fees.

  world out there, and I went exploring.  I found these neat things
  called "bookstores" and "malls", as well as stopping in at the
  Compleat Strategist on 33d St. in NYC.

  Compleat Strategist _wants_ to carry T4.  They want promo
  material as soon as possible. (Hey, Ken!  Is IG listening?)  They
  _like_ Traveller, even though they give CyberPunk 2020 and GURPS
  and AD&D _each_ about three times the shelf space that Traveller
  has ever had. But then, with GDW not supporting the system,
  they\'d\'ve had to order a 20-year supply of each item to have
  enough stock to match any of the above.  There\'s good and bad to
  it...

  However:  Several comic shops in the malls, and most of the
  bookstores, had at least one shelf for RPG stuff, and most had
  more.  So did the toy stores.  But, y\'know, the only game I saw
  on those shelves was AD&D.  Maybe part of Traveller\'s problem has
  been _exposure_?  Or, more accurately, the lack thereof?

  Maybe IG should try to put Traveller right next to AD&D in Barnes
  and Noble.  Or in Squiggy\'s Cards and Comix.

  Maybe buying a "spot" during Star Trek/ST:TNG/ST:DS9/ST:V and/or
  during Babylon 5 or during SeaQuest:DSV (if it\'s still on) or
  during Sliders (ditto) or... would be a good idea as well.  Maybe
  space in Asimov\'s would also be a good idea.

  Heck, there are companies that think of these things for money,
  and they probably do a better job than I would.  But there
  shouldn\'t be any question of what I\'m trying to get at.  And
  now\'s the time to start - certainly not _after_ the release, and
  not only in the few days before the release.  There are a lot of
  gamers, and a lot of potential gamers out there - and most of
  them would say "Huh?" if you said "Traveller".  Don\'t you think
  that needs to be changed?

1.	IN DEFENCE OF THAT NILSEN GUY

Stu said that Dave Nilsen\'s writing style "sacrificed info in favour of ...
very
bad humour".

I don\'t disagree that some of his humour was poor ("Starship", "San Claus",
et
al). However, I believe that he totally sacrificed information. Look at the
Darrian alien module - huge tracts of open whitespace, plenty of room for 
(at
least) pictures, or (at most) more info!! Crumbs, DM, they could at least
have
given us a few pics of flame sculptures or Darrian floating cities or a
world
map - we don\'t even have that!

In contrast, look at all the info packed into Survival Margin and the
Regency
Sourcebook. The latter, in particular, is one of the most scholarly works
produced by the Workshop. Even though I\'m not playing in the RC, it contains
data that i will be using in my 1101-1120 campaign, simply because it gives
me adventure ideas and because it brings so much information together into
one place.

Also, if Dave really is the one person who knows the most about
inconsistencies
within CT/MT, then he really should be consulted about re-released
*backgrounds*.

2.	TRAVELLER CCG

I wouldn\'t mind seeing a CCG that can be used to resolve space combat, if
you
wanted it resolved quickly without going to Mayday or Brilliant Lances.

3.	T4

>From Ken:
>I feel that T4 should be the internet abbreveation. However this is not
>cannon, only my sugestion.
 ^^^^^^
Oh, Ken, If only you knew what battles have been fought over that little
word!
[BTW, I repeat that this is the best reason to get Dave Nilsen on the team,
if he really knows about all the inconsistencies within "canon"].

And if you think there are none, let me remind you of:
   a. jump torps
   b. Annic Nova
   c. Black globes used to power jump drives (from HG)
   d. How The Solomani Won The War
et al...

4.	2300

In reply to the US "arm" being a dead-end, a number of _Challenge_ articles
opened the arm up using brown dwarfs and stutterwarp tugs.

5.	HOUSEKEEPING

Just a plea from someone who only has a 1200-baud modem (currently):
For those of you who insist on quoting other people\'s entire paragraphs, and
then adding only one or two sentences (or even only one or two WORDS, good
grief!) - PLEASE DON\'T! Those of us (the majority) who follow the threads
through KNOW what they are about. Only quote the relevant bit - the sentence
,
one or two sentences, whatever - cut any irrelevant stuff in-between.
It\'s easier to read, not to mention easier on the bandwidth (and I believe
that
some on this list have to pay for EVERY byte they download!!)

6.	COMPILED MARCHES DATA

Glenn M. Goffin) said:
>I have been working recently on compiling all of the published information
on
>the Spinward Marches (up to about Third Imperium Year 1120) into one
database..

Wow, a BIG project. I recognise the Efate planet names from _The Zhodani
Conspiracy_ - now that\'s scholarship to trawl through the computer games as
well!

BTW, the Regency Sourcebook is actually a good reference source for any era,
as
it contains the cross-reference listings for all the old data it draws upon.
For
example, I don\'t have JTAS 1-7 (only the "Best of.."), but the data for
Victoria
(Lanth/Spinward Marches 1817) is included in the Sourcebook. The reference
says
it came from JTAS 2, currently out of print.

Can you post the references you have so far to me? (I\'d ask for the data,
too,
but that would breach copyright ;-). Have you suggested to Marc that you
could
help them to compile a full on-line reference for the Marches?

Subject: Shipboard combat
Message-ID: <01BB344B.F79D66E0@Mark.dk-online.dk>

All this talk about shipboard combat has made me think of something. =
When I first started playing Traveller/MegaTraveller, I read in the =
rules that some high penetration weapons were rarely used inside =
spaceships, as the risk of penetrating the hull was too high. Well, you =
all know that.

But take a look at the MegaTraveller rules: The Players\' Manual (p. 93) =
states a Starship Interior Bulkhead as having an armor value of 40, and =
a Starship Exterior Hull an armor value of 60! Clearly, no personal =
weapon listed in the Weapons section can penetrate that - not even the =
FGMPs, Grenade Launchers or Recoilless Rifles.

Off course you still have the problem with ricochetting bullets, but =
sometimes you may even want that - imagine firing burst fire at the wall =
behind an enemy under cover. If he\'s down a corridor or something (a =
rather reasonable situation in shipboard combat) you can do this =
relatively safely and he just might get hit by the ricochet.

And if you don\'t want ricochets, you can just fire lasers or other =
energy weapons - they don\'t ricochet.

Off course you still run the risk of damaging valuable equipment =
including power plant, bridge, jump drive and so on. But that\'s an other =
story.

Well, I\'m certainly not going to tell them they can\'t! There\'s a Ghurka
engineering squadron based a couple of miles away, and they may all be little
guys (probably about 5\'6" average) but they look tough as hell when you pass
them in town (and smart with it, blazers and smart pants as a rule). As for the
Khukri being ugly, it\'s probably a matter of perspective. It\'s still part of
their official equipment and if they\'ve got them they\'ll use them (I believe
they used them in the Falklands).

Only 1 problem...  Other than a few snippets written by Norris, 
Strephon, et al, 99% of the rest of the material was recycled TNS 
entries from Challenge.  A brief introduction to the New Era timeline 
(even more brief than the 1 in the TNE rulebook), and a character 
conversion system from CT/MT to TNE system that really doesn\'t work 
too well.  I doubt that more than 30% of the material in SM was new, 
and of the 30% that was new, most of it was useless.  I felt that 
Survival Margin was nothing more than the world\'s longest 
advertisement for an RPG system...

Again, a lot of it was rehashes of material.  However, I will grant 
you that RSB packed in a lot of information.  In fact if anything, 
too much into too thin a volume...  Considering the font size, this 
book should have been twice its actual size at a minimum.  For us 
30+ folks, who are close to needing glasses, the thing is virtually 
unreadable...  But, Nilsen did a reasonably good job with RSB...when 
he laid off the sophomoric humor...

I have no problem with him being "consulted."  Just as long as he 
doesn\'t write the damn things.

I just have to reply to Jerry Alexandratos, and this isn\'t a flame,
and I agree completely with his comments amounting to "if you don\'t
like it, change it", but you have to get your facts right!

>In CT, I don\'t ever remember seeing a 100 ton limit, as far as I know,
>it was added in MT.

Well, I couldn\'t give you a page number, but it was in the rules, it
was in the supplements (Traders & Gunboats, or Library Data N-Z, to
name but two), and I think it affected standard ship designs, such as
the xboat, and the Scout/Courier (the deckplans for both of which are
no where near displacement 100) which would have been more feasible if
they were smaller.

>And fuel use.  We do all know that you use all your jump fuel whether
>you jump the full capacity of your drive or partial capacity.

I\'m not at all clear that there was any such rule in CT, or in MT for
that matter; I have a feeling that FF&S was the first place to mention
fuel use as a function of jump range, etc.  Of course, this is me
being hazy on my facts now!

Just to reiterate, I support the gist of Jerry\'s post, I\'m just
pedantic.  I\'m probably a terminal anti-Canonmonger (see
http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~spe/Rules/ or
http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~spe/Plans/Plans.html for proof!)

Wizards of the Coast have been producing Magic for two or three years now. 
Loathe it or Hate it, it is the most widely sold CCG out. This didn\'t stop 
them cutting all their RPG lines (including Everway, which had only been 
published a month or so) in December of last year.

However you view their business decision though, a potential T4 CCG 
(Traveller: The Gathering? :-) ) would not only be competing with MTG, but 
with approximately 180 further card games - many of which are barely 
playable (and only a few are playable without a large cash outlay).

For this reason, no matter how good or playable a T4 CCG was, I cannot see 
how it would help the production or survivability of Traveller.

I don\'t know how much it costs to develop a CCG, but I do know that WoTC had 
to loan or gift a large amount of cash to Steve Jackson Games to get Mythos 
out (of course, Mythos is playable!).

>  I thought that was the reason for the CCG craze in the first place: low 
overhead.

According to Richard Garfield in a recent interview with Arcane magazine in 
the UK (the infamous "...Wizards don\'t want to kill roleplaying.." interview 
 - which was published the same week that WoTC dropped their RPG lines), he 
designed Magic because he was a big fan of collectible cards (which are 
apparently big business in the US) and he had thousands of cards which did 
nothing but look nice. He claims to have been pleasantly surprised by the 
surge of interest in MTG.

Everybody else got on the bandwagon because it appeared from WoTC\'s success 
to be a licence to print cash.

I can think of half a dozen CCG\'s where playtesting appears to have been 
left to the buyer to do! The sad thing is that there are some very good card 
games on the market, but they are swamped by the majority which should never 
have been printed. Next time you go in to your games store, see how long it 
takes you to spot a decent, playable CCG on the display.

My main problem with CCG\'s has always been the amount of money you have to 
spend to get a playable deck. If I wanted to buy a game which was unplayable 
until I had bought an unspecified number of supplements (or boosters in this 
case), I would have bought TORG.

To IG: If you make a T4 CCG, for God\'s sake make sure that it is:

     a) playable
     b) playable straight from the box

that gave me an idea on how a CCG *could* fit into Traveller nicely.

Have the CCG be aimed at planetary/interstellar politics. Including
Clausewitz\'s "diplomacy by other means" (ie war).

It\'d give a nice, semi-abstract way of playing out political
interactions, and thus giving refs a way to take a bunch of generated
worlds and turn them into a bunch of territories, complete with a
"history" of deals, wars, etc.

Heck, handled right it might even work the way some gaming groups used
to do things. They\'d use some "grand strategic" type rules to generate
the conflicts and find out *where* the battles were going to be. Then
they\'d use tactical level rules to fight out the battles. 

As I\'ve noted before, I\'m in favor of having the rules set up such that
you can handle things at any desired level of complexity and get
"equivalent" results. 

So if a CCG would work for the highest level, what the heck.

	I don\'t know about stores in Montreal, but I can garantee you
that as long as it makes the grade, T4 will be supported here in
Sherbrooke. :) 

	Just come to the Griffon Feerique, 88 or 97 King West (not
sure of the address exactly, but it\'s right downtown, almost on the
corner of King and Wellington).  One of the owners is a Traveller fan
<grin> and although there isn\'t a whole lot of stock in-store there,
there will probably be at least 1 copy of the book on sale at all
times. :)  Some of the other stuff is cheaper than in some Montreal
stores too.  

	Sorry for the crass commercialism guys, but I want to help T4
succeed! :)  Also it would help if Imperial Games sent us free
posters for the store. <grin> :)

based on Glisten.

At the Glisten Ballet (1107-103)

The lights dim and brighten in the foyer to signal that the beginning of the 
performance is imminent.  I put my drink down and begin working my way in 
with the rest of the crowd into the performance arena.  My seat is at 78 
South, 159 East, a bit far south, but well placed in longitude.  As I walk 
into the arena I gasp (as do many others) in spite of having been here 
several times.  

The long sloping inner surface is carpeted with people finding there seats, I 
look straight up (to me) and see the tops of heads of other patrons.  As they 
begin to sit, all facing the center of the sphere, I gaze around at the gold 
leaf cherubim and angels in the architecture.  No expense was spared to make 
us feel as though we were stepping into a more conventional theatre, the 
faces, lighting, only that disconcerting \'ceiling that isn\'t\' to betray the 
illusion, and the steadily rising surface in every direction.  To my left as 
I sit I can see a crystalline chandelier rising from the floor, identical to 
the one opposite, which looks more \'normal\' to me, except for the figures 
walking about its base.

Music from the orchestra changes from the ordered chaos of tuning and warming 
up sounds to the single note by first violin and all others following suit.  
the conductor is applauded as he enters - I can see him clearly, across the 
inside surface, raising his baton.  There\'s not an obstructed seat in the 
house, and there are so many more of them in the same space that a 
conventional theatre would take up.  Its so much nicer actually being able to 
*see* the orchestra.

I look up into the sphere, I could almost see down the throat of the east 
wing were I only further North.  After the long swelling note of the 
overture, a ballerina emerges from the wisps of curtain.  Her bright body 
suit shows the muscular curves of her body.

Drifting outward at a gentle speed she begins her dance.  Pirouetting slowly 
in three dimensions like some feathery terrestrial seed pod, she turns in a 
precise geometric pattern and makes what took years of practice and 
tremendous athletic fitness look easy.  At the other end of the arena her 
hand reaches out for a pivot pole in a seemingly random part of her body\'s 
movement.  She orbits the pole twice before releasing - vectored back the way 
she came at the same pedestrian pace. 

Her partner appears as the music changes, floating out somewhat faster.  They 
meet near the center of the spherical empty space and their hands meet.  Only 
a slight tremble where they hold each other betrays the force involved as 
they rotate around a center of mass between them.  In their rotation he 
passes the energy of his greater velocity to his partner.  They rotate 
once...twice...three times and release at just the right moment, their 
momentum having carried them across the center of the arena, their 
expressions of adoration and sweet movements tell us they are young lovers.  
The heroine flys off in what seems to me to be \'up\'  from their entry 
vectors, landing by collapsing her legs on a transparent platform.  The hero, 
having passed all his energy to her, is motionless in the center.  He gets 
tremendous applause; this precise balance of energy is perhaps the most 
difficult manuver possible.

A third character enters the stage to swelling angry music.  His speed is 
greater still and he and our protagonist do imaginary, abstract battle in the 
center of the arena.  They fly at each other with long, wicked looking 
spears.  After a couple of violent passes the enemy grabs the spear of our 
hero below the spearhead, flinging him forward, directly towards my seat.  
The protagonist hooks his spear on another pivot pole and reverses direction, 
while his enemy lands on another of the few transparent platforms placed 
around the perimeter.  I shake my head at the skill required to aim so 
carefully from 10 meters away, while spinning.

The abstract drama plays itself out.  The crowd applauds, and in the end the 
hero and heroine exit together.  The villan vanquished.

Behind the scenes;

The dancers are very specialized in zero-g-manuvering.  They are not 
particularly talented at zero-g-combat, but then again they can probably hold 
their own pretty well (especially hand-to-hand).  Also, to be a dancer of 
this sort requires great strength, dexterity, and endurance (at least a 10 in 
each, offhand), just as more conventional ballet and other dancers/figure 
skaters/acrobats do.  The arena I chose to use is a sphere about 30 meters 
across.  Careful and expensive gravitic controls allow the gravity to be 
normal (1g) around the perimeter of the spherical chamber and out to just 2.5 
meters from the sphere\'s surface while absent in the center.  This postulates 
a degree of control over gravitics that may make some referees wince (it made 
me wince), but there you have it.  Around the perimeter of the sphere in 
conventional locations (i.e. in the same place in every arena) are four 
transparent round platforms for \'landings\' and \'launchings\', and twelve or 
more \'pivot poles\' which are identical to the type of pole used for the high 
bar or uneven bars in gymnastics (they flex just a bit so they can be used to 
build momentum).

The platforms are at the \'top\' and \'bottom\' and on the \'right\' and \'left\' of 
the sphere.  At the third dimension, \'front\' and \'back\', are the \'wings\' or 
entrances to the stage.  These are kept at zero G along their length 
(conventionally called their \'throat\').  at the bottom of the each wing 
(furthest from the center of the sphere, that is) is a launching platform 
with handholds so that a dancer can place themselves carefully and launch 
into the arena.  The very exit of the wing is often shrouded by wispy 
curtains which are blown outward by mild airflow.

Pivot poles are placed on either side of each platform and at the end of each 
wing.  On occasion, a single long pole is mounted straight through the center 
of the sphere in one dimension.

Dancers conventionally wear tights and simple accessories or props.  Long 
wispy scarves are currently popular, and knife throwing/catching has been 
employed.  Stage sets are almost never employed, although lighting and laser 
or holographic special effects are occasionally used.  More "modern" 
unconventional dances have employed micro thrust systems (mounted on wrist 
and ankle) which allow dancers to change their vector in midflight.  It will 
be interesting to see what new forms these accessories inspire, but the field 
is very traditional and such unconventional techniques are finding it hard to 
break in.

I see the dancing itself as a cross between figure skating (lots of 
cantilevered spins with a partner) acrobatics (tumbling and use of poles and 
bars) and ballet (strong, graceful, precise movements and strict 
conventions).  Usually there is some sort of abstract story line.  Costumes 
are minimalist and abstract.  The focus is on the movements of the 
performers, anything else is just an accessory.

A mishap by a dancer would send them spinning out of control in a nearly 
random direction, out of the zero-g-field and into the seats (rehearsals 
usually have a net rigged to protect the dancers from injury).  Another 
possibility is being thrown by your partner in just the wrong way, twisting 
your back.  Historically, many injuries among dancers have occurred, ending 
careers and lives.

Remember that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  
There are many possible actions; friction with the bars or a platform or 
other dancers, grasping and rotation with another dancer, throwing things, 
catching things, collisions, all of which would tend to alter a dancer\'s 
vector or velocity or both.  The hardest thing to judge is changes by the 
dancer alone.  Can a talented dancer manipulate their center of mass around 
enough to change their vector?  No, but they can do an awful lot up to that 
point.  Just keep in mind that once a mass has a given velocity that both 
must be conserved until acted on by an outside force.

In the adventure I am currently running, a major ballet company was 
infiltrated by an assassin.  This person threw a dagger during the 
performance as part of the plot of the dance.  A carefully calculated 
\'mistake\' sent the knife flying past the other dancer and into the stands in 
order to murder one of the non-player characters.  Because a PC had taken the 
place of the intended victim the knife missed the PC\'s heart by about an inch 
(the PC was much shorter than the intended victim).

Hope this was useful.

Yeah, but the original alien modules were weak when compared to the
ones that were done by DGP as well.  I found them to be sparse in all
respects.  Compare the two Aslan or Vargr modules.

Yes, it was recycled TNS material, but it was there.  For the first
time, they compiled all the necessary information and made it
available.  Before you\'d have to start fishing for back issues, and
that would definitely get expensive.

A lot of rehashed material, a lot of new material as well.  You can\'t
forego presenting previously published information.  The problem is
that many new players don\'t have access to the old stuff.  Hell, I\'ve
been playing Traveller for 9 years now (so yes, I am a youngin) and I
still don\'t own a copy of Secrets of the Ancients or many of the
Double Adventures.  Maybe the Star Wars RGP was on to something when
it decided to also republish out-of-print material updated for their
2ed.

But you know what, RSB is hands down one of the best supplements ever
made.  It contains it all.  If anything that was in it was left out,
we would have been disappointed or felt cheated.  As far as the page
count goes, do you really think Nilsen had anything to do with that,
or do you think that it may have been his boss who was trying to keep
his company from going under?

Let him write.  I don\'t think the problem is when he write, I think
it\'s when one person has to write practically everything.  I think the
diversified approach is the best (so it\'s a good thing to see IG going
that way).  Hell, I figure that Nilsen probably would be the person to
do their New Era mileau when it comes out (oops, am I sounding too
positive there?).

You\'re absolutely right.  I\'m pretty sure that it\'s also presented in

Actually, I think you\'re on to something here.  DGP & IG would do 
well to republish or update a lot of the old stuff eventually, if not 
on paper, perhaps CD-Rom...

No.  I think that RSB was an attempt to fit a watermelon into a 
banana peel.  Clearly, the teeny weeny font size was an effort to 
cram a lot of material onto as few a number of pages as possible.  
Not really anyone\'s fault, other than GDW being in a crunch 
financially...

OK, I concede, RSB did give a good amount of info for the buck...

You might be on to something here.  Most of the earlier works were a 
collaborative effort.  Let\'s face it, TNE was pretty much Nilsen\'s 
baby.  I still think that too much of Dave, and too little of the 
game showed in some of the writing though.

Traveller

That isn\'t what they CALL it: they call it Traveller; anything else is too
cumbersome. I call it Traveller or occasionally New Traveller (when I want to
differentiate it). When we need to distinguish between the editions, I think
most everyone has been on track already:

CT: Classic Traveller
MT: MegaTraveller
TNE: New Era
T4: New Traveller

We already know what is meant by the abbreviations and they say what they
mean.

Now don\'t get me wrong, MMT has a nice ring to it to my ear, but I think T4
is more appropriate.

IMHO This was one of the best parts of that adventure.  The ship was so old 
or from so far away that there was no way to figure out just who built it or 
where it came from.

It\'s a bit like Stonehenge, or Easter Island (only high tech).  A mystery to 
be pondered, not solved.

This is the way I like published adventures to be.  I don\'t want an 
absolute paucity of information, but if I\'m given a lot of possibilities 
to pursue with my players, it makes it more fun for my whole group.  I 
don\'t like the scripted style that many published adventure scenarios 
take, wherein the GM is given a linear or near-linear path to lead his 
players down.  Allowing the referee and the players to determine together 
who is was that owned the Annic Nova actually ended up providing 
additional adventuring material for future sessions!

Does anyone else prefer published adventures that are filled with 
"hooks?" (That is, containing lots of alternate paths to pursue, with enough 
background detail given that the referee can allow his players to follow 
whatever path they choose.)

Given my players, that\'s the only way I can play adventures. My players
seem to find their own hooks whether I\'m ready or not.

TOY stores had RPGs?  Wow, I\'ve never seen that.  THe only places around me
that carry RPGs are ONE gaming store, and a comic stores carrys AD&D, and
ONE book store carrys about three AD&D products.

That would be difficult.  I mean, does anyone know a gamer out there who ahs
never tried his\\her hand at AD&D?  I don\'t.  It was the first game I played,
and, even though I don\'t play it as much now, it is still kind of enjoyable.
It allows me to look back on what I used to play.

This would probably depend on Traveller\'s sales, if I\'m correct.  I know
spots on any Star Trek series cost a helluva lot, and most small (no offense
IG!) can\'t afford them.

However, space in Asimov\'s probably doesn\'t cost half as much, and there\'s
probably a lot of players, and potential players who read it.  Also, they\'d
probably think that if a game can be in Asimov\'s, then it must be quite good.

Definitely, it\'d be great if when I asked for Traveller in my local game
store they didn\'t say "Trav-a-what?" and then say "Check the back corner..."

I\'m just starting up a MegaTraveller campaign with a few friends, we\'re
playing in the Shattered Imperium, Spinward Marches around 1119.  I\'ve got a
problem though.  The first player, through luck of the dice managed to roll
up, a Grand Admiral.  Although I tried to persuade him throughout his
character generation he was determined to get the best character he could.
The second one isn\'t that bad, he is a 35 year-old scout.  However, my
problem, is how to get them introduced to the universe.  How should I
explain all the different factions of the Rebellion?  Aliens?  The different
Human races?  And everything else that makes Traveller great.  I have
thought of just letting them loose on the Imperial Encylopedia, but that
would probably spoil the fun.

Any suggestions?

Yup! I had the K\'kree, unknowingly controlled by a disguised bonkers Ancient
psionic warbot and equipped with TL18 stuff, invade the whole damn place and
capture Strephon. Guess who had to sneak into captured territory disguised as
Sworn, and spring the Emperor, and scout for the first strike back from deneb
through Corridor, and are now trying to stop the rot at its\' root - Kirur? Yeah,
you guessed it, the lucky PCs.

It\'s the end of the campaign, which has been active in various forms for 12
years - certainly the primary character has- , so I feel able to make it almost
ludicrously high-powered. I\'ve made it clear I may rewind history afterwards and
return to a more conventional timeline. Hey, we\'re enjoying ourselves!

After this I plan to move forwards c.100 years and pick up Ace\'s descendants (ie
fresh player characters).

BTW, does anyone have a writeup for the K\'kree world? There wasn\'t anything in
Alien Module 2.

[BTW: I just plunked down my 35Cr for the new Traveller Hard Bound.  Kinda
feels good.... :-) (and the Mrs. didn\'t even complain)]

I remember the first time I went through Annic Nova.  It was so alien.  We all
know the Vargr, and Zhodani, but here was this complete unknown.  It was spooky
in a way.  I think thats why I like that adventure.  I am always expecting 
some acid dripping alien to step around a corner and ruin my vacc-suit.

The other adventure that I really liked, though I never got to play it was
Leviathan.  There was some mystic to that large trader travelling though
the wilds in the Spinward Fringe.  It was cool to go to worlds that had not
been spyed on, I mean surveyed by the IISS.  You didn\'t know what or who was
there.

Yea, Toys \'r\' Us has typically carried AD&D for several years, though that has waned of late.  Our Walden\'s has a good selection of AD&D and some other odd stuff.  One of the Managers is a gamer, so they get stuff that he is currently into but can\'t go much past the corporate line of carrying AD&D stuff.

I think thats what IG wants us to do.  When we visit a store, try to talk to the Buyer and let them know there will be new products for this way cool RPG called
"Marc Miller\'s Traveller" comming out soon.

TV spots may be a bit much right now, even TSR doesn\'t advertise AD&D on a 
national broadcast media that I am aware of.  However, one place to think about
advertising would be (drum roll please) The Sci-Fi Channel.  Actually, if IG could arrange it as feature article on some of the "news" oriented programs like Sci-Fi Buzz or FTL Newsfeed.  Also, IG should look at some of the Sci-Fi web sites like "Sci-Fi Weekly".  If they do articles, then that can go a long
way to market the game for free.

That has been my experience, too.  Fortunately, I\'ve never had sheep-like 
players willing to follow the obvious path. :)  They keep me on my toes . 
. . 

The way the CT Adventures were written (those by GDW, FASA, and 
Gamelords, at least) gave the referee plenty of background information, 
which helps a lot.  I wonder whether the new Traveller game\'s published 
adventures will follow the old formula?

how to easily update it where you think it needs it, please feel free to
email me. I may not take every suggestion, but I will consider all
suggestions.

Also, what I would like is your fabulous design and research abilities. I\'d
like a set of statistics, a 100 to 250 word description of the ship, the
name of the first known example of the ship, and the USPs of the following
ships:

Escape Pod
Express Boat

Slow Boat
Pinnace
Slow Pinnace
Modular Cutter
Shuttle
Scout

Free Trader
Subsidized Merchant
Subsidized Liner

Laboratory Ship
Safari Ship
Close Escort
Gig
System Defense Boat
Corsair
Military Destroyer
Light Fighter
Medium Fighter
Heavy Fighter
Missile Fighter
Military Carrier

Please use as much of what\'s already out there in your designs. I will
credit you in the work as the "Chief Naval Architect" in the book. Please
email me if you\'re interested, and what ship(s) you\'re interested in doing.
Remember that we\'re doing this in the Year 0 of the Imperium (or within 20
years). If I like your design, I will use it. If you have access to a
program that will produce Illustrator style .eps files, and you want to do
deck layouts, we\'d love to see those, too.

Let me see what you can do!

Many of my old issues of Analog magazine have ads from GDW for Traveller.
I suspect their rates (and Asimov\'s) would be quite reasonable, and might
even bring new players into the hobby (much as CT did originally!). 

The Sci-Fi channel is a great idea: surely there are enough Traveller fans
with ray-tracing software to make some cool animations for a short ad....

My problem is that swords in space are just *too* silly.  I\'m reminded 
far too much of the overblown space operas of the 30s and 40s.  There are 
other, more interesting (to me) answers.  Snub pistols were mentioned as 
being designed for this purpose.  Their recoil is low and the 
penetration for all shell types except HEAP is 1.  They basically can\'t 
accidentally harm anything in the ship.  In addition, sonic stunners (if 
used), gas rounds, and for the very high tech, neural weapons all all 
good choices for non-military shipboard combat.  

For military battles things become a bit different:

Laser pistols (TL: 9) and Gauss pistols both only have penetrations of 4. 
This is enough to penetrate all standard vacc suits, but if every major
piece of equipment on a military starship had armor of at least 8 they
would be useful weapons.  However, if the military is fighting other
military it is likely that everyone is wearing at least Combat Armor TL-12
(armor value 10).  No hand weapons except Axes and Harlberds (not very
convenient to wield in a starship corridor) can do anything against this
type of armor.  In addition, most slug throwers and lasers have trouble
handling this type of armor. 

The weapons that can penetrate such armor and do significant damage are 
also a danger to the starship.  The problem is much worse when dealing 
with TL 14 armor (AV: 18).  To achieve a high penetration shot on that 
kind of armor you risk using a weapon that can shoot through the hull, 
and destroying the ship they are trying to capture.

I\'m not sure of how to get around this problem, other than to say that
mostly military forces just blow up starships at a distance rather than 
attempting to board.

Well Sorry to inform you but marines do not provide security on US

I was about to leap to the defence of the Darrian alien

too.  Then I actually looked at them.

Below are the number of column inches of blank space for five
of the modules (and please don\'t quibble over the odd inch -
I didn\'t do this to any particular degree of accuracy - I do

Which I must admit suprised me.  I don\'t know if the other
alien modules would show similar results (i.e. somewhere in
the 20s) but it would appear that you were getting nearly 5
blank pages in the last Alien Module.

I appreciate that this may bear no correlation to the quality
of the content but it does suggest that ideas/time/money or
something was getting a bit short.

My impression from your post is that we can use either classic or High Guard

I would take it as a personal mission if I could get permission to do

For a few grand a week, you could also get some tremoundous coverage in

    'body' => 'Mr. Perrin:

I have been a fan of Traveller since my sophomore year in high school
(79-80).  I have a copy of *every* Traveller product published by GDW,
with the exception of the very earliest issues of JTAS.  

I *never* liked the construction rules in CT Book2; I always used Book5
(HG) for starship construction (until Brilliant Lances & FFS came along,
that is, whereupon I dropped Book5 like a hot potato).  

Some of my complaints about Book2 (and Book5, to a lesser extent, where
applicable) are as follows: 

	1) The capacity of computers compared to the requirements of
programs is ridiculously inadequate for a industrial technological society
that is *several* *thousand* years old.  (I am a computer professional who
has studied the trends of increasing capacity vs. increasing needs, with
avid interest, for many years.) 

	2) The vector-based movement system of Book2 was too
space-consuming at the scale used (one inch representing one thousand
miles).  In Book5, however, the resolution of combat/movement was *completely*
intangible (which is intolerable to an anal-retentive detail-freak like me
:-).  

	3) The design systems made *no* allowance for sensor and/or commo 
systems (range; detection/counter-detection; detail of resolution; etc.).  

	4) Book2 produced starship design that were space-inefficient when 
compared to Book5 (*my* Bk5 X-Boats had J5 *and* M1; under FFS, they had
J4, M1, *and* 1,000 flight computers [simulating the mythical "extensive
arrays of databanks" always mentioned but never seen]).  
	(BTW: Can you *really* envision the Vilani using an as inefficient
a means of designing merchant ships as this? :-) 

In short, now that I\'ve been spoiled with FFS, anything less is
insufficient.  I would suggest that you design a modular system in the
same *style* as Book2, but build the various modules/components using your
/ IG\'s version of FFS.  (Then you can "publish" your version of FFS on your
web page for the gearheads amongst us who want it.)  

You and Marc and Ken have said that you\'re revising the CT rules "in light
of 20+ years of experience."  As *several* members of this list (i.e.,
"potential customers") have stated, once you have a light-detail framework
in place, it will be difficult to design a more detailed framework *that*
*fits*; if you *start* with a more-detailed framework (even if you never
publish it), you can "dumb-down" the level of detail very easily.  

OTOH, you asked us to tell you if we saw any "glaring holes."  Your chart
of "Size (in displacement tons) of Computers by Tech Level" forgot that
*spaceships* (not starships) can be built at TL-7, 8, and 9.  You need
entries for these TL\'s on your chart.  

I\'d be interested in hearing your refutation/rebuttal.  Thank you.

is made that more customers will be lost than gained by keeping things 
simple.  At first, I kept quiet about this, but now I think it\'s time to 
say something on behalf of those who don\'t require extreme complexity.

As noted earlier, Traveller (esp. CT) has always been a moduler system.  
If you didn\'t like Book 2\'s way of doing things, you could always pick up 
High Guard.  Similarly, you could choose from the basic ship combat 
model, Mayday, Azhanti High Lightning, and/or Snapshot.  Mix and match, 
use whatever appeals to you.

I want to reiterate my support of this approach.  I want Traveller to 
succeed, and I feel strongly that offering a less-complex approach as the 
standard system will bring more players than it will drive away.  If this 
is followed up with a more complex (yet optional) system, the totality of 
the audience will receive something they like.  This approach should 
alienate no one, whereas offering a complex version first then a simpler 
version as a supplement could very well lose customers.  

The moduler system, with simple core rules and complex supplemental 
rules, is the way to go.  This is what IG and MM have said they would do, 
and I sincerely hope they do not allow the advocates of complexity above 
all else sway them.

I totally agree with you; however, it might be a good idea to do a complete
rewrite of the original, "simpler" rules. It was very hard to visualize. My
group eventually turned to other rules (we wound up using Task Force
Games\' *Starfire* rules for ship-to-ship combat). It\'s much easier to deal
with ship-to-ship combat using a mapsheet and counters than it is any
other way. And the Starfire rules can be REALLY simple: the current
version has a four (4!) page "starter" set of rules, with a 96 page book of
"advanced" rules, that take into account everything from fighters to
mines. I\'d love IG to design something like that.

I agree with you, but I\'d like to see a counter-based system in its place.

Analog has a higher circulation, the rates are the same, and it draws more of
a \'hard-science\' readership.  But I like the idea, assuming that the ad

I wouldn\'t object to a counter- or miniatures-based system.  I think it 
is a good way to play anything but the most basic (ie, one-on-one) 
battle.  I\'d buy such a system.

But, again, I think that is something that would best be handled outside 
of the basic game (ie, in a "Snapshot" or "Mayday" type supplement) if 
it involves, as you say, a "complete rewrite" of the original rules.  
Also, I can remember being daunted by counters when I was a fledgling 
gamer.  They made it seem much more complex than it was.  "I\'ve gotta 
remember what all these counters are, and what their individual abilities 
are??  Aaiigghh!" :)  But, maybe I\'m the only one that thinks that way.

I support IG\'s stated goal of a basic system that is not complex, but 
which is supplemented by increasingly complex material in the form of 
additional books.  We old-timer Traveller players can use our current 
complex systems as add-ons until IG produces the T4 equivalent.  In the 
mean-time, the simplicity (dare I say...elegance?) of the core rules will 
(hopefully) bring in new gamers by the droves. :)

FASA published a supplement for CT which had prices for a wide variety of 
common items. I can\'t recall the name of it at the moment.

I\'d love to help out with ship design. I\'ve already got

I\'m partial to the Scout, Lab Ship, or one of the large, 
High Guard-rule ships, but I\'ll take any. 
 
Also, let me suggest another one that I had in mind 
for a campaign focus -- an old Sylean Federation 
Battle Rider Tender, converted for use by the Scout 
service for long-range exploring and diplomacy. 
Instead of an Enterprise-style exploration ship, 
it acts as a mothership for a variety of smaller 
vessels. 
 
 
In any event, two things Designers need to know: 
 
1) Tech level: what\'s the maximum, and how common is that 
maximum (i.e., if max TL is 11, would a typical scout 
ship be at TL-11, or would a more common example be TL-10)? 
 
2) In a few cases that you listed, a suggested tonnage 
would be helpful.

I guess I fall somewhere in the middle on this one.  

I don\'t want to go back to something as simple as Book 2.  As soon 
as I bought Book 5 High Guard, I basically all but forgot about the 
book 2 design rules (and that was 15 years ago).  I thought the 
results were too abstract, and I liked the combat system less than 
the designs.
I really didn\'t find High Guard to be all that cumbersome a design process.  
They were still relatively easy to design, and the combat system was much 
improved, although it is now dated.  I would suggest that a High Guard system 
(revamped) should be a bare minimum for simplistic design rules.

I don\'t like FF&S.  I thought the organization of the book made it 
difficult to read, and I really didn\'t see the point in devoting a 
lot of space to "alternate" technologies that weren\'t ever going to 
be supported by any other book in the system.  I guess the 
overwhelming complexity cut into my limited time too much to think 
about using it.

I liked MT, at least after taking advantage of the errata.  It was 
complex enough to really make ship design interesting, yet it still 
takes me just a little while to design a vehicle or ship.  I thought 
the complexity was just about my speed.  Frankly, If the new design 
rules don\'t grab me, I\'ll probably continue to use MT rules.

I would make the following suggestions at a minimum for whatever 
design rules are used, and whatever form Starships take.

1.  Proofread.  Both FF&S and MT suffered grievously (especially MT) 
from very poorly edited design rules.  I would rather see well 
written and edited design rules that I\'m not real crazy about than 
have to white out several pages and insert new tables...

2.  Design lots of ships.  Some of us who run campaigns are pressed for time.  
Although I enjoy designing ships, there are lots of times where it just isn\'t 
possible.  It\'d be nice to have a couple hundred ship designs to pick 
and choose from to incorporate games.  

3.  It sounds like you actually figured this one out, but don\'t make 
a system as complex as FF&S as your ONLY design system.  While I see 
no problem with designing an FF&S style supplement for the gearheads, 
I sure wouldn\'t want to be FORCED to design a ship with one.

I\'ve subscribed to Analog for close to 30 years now.  You\'re right
about it being a harder science than IA.  I think T4 would be a very

Great! a Grand Admiral and a Scout (both of whom know nothing about the rich
history of the Imperium) and are just starting out. Maybe they have amnesia?
Or just stepped out of cold sleep after 900 years? Or aren\'t Imperials at
all: they are from some dinky empire far far away. Seems to me you have great
potential for adventure here.

Merely telling my local game store about the game will cause him to
carry it. My group is kind of responsible for his success in non-D&D
gaming. I would place ads in Game Supporting (read RPG) magazines.
There\'s a bunch of them, pick the format that appeals to you. Believe
it or not you probably have the same tastes as potential T4 players.

Like many others, I think TV ad prices are probably excessive (the Sci-Fi 
channel possibly excepted). Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact, again, 
would seem the best-targeted fiction magazine for Traveller\'s potential 
audience.  The usual raft of gaming-mag ads (Dragon, Pyramid, maybe some 
of the smaller fry like Shadis and d8) are an obvious route.

Don\'t underestimate the value of a good poster.  I know my local game 
dealer (Nan\'s Games & Comics Too, here in Houston) always likes good-
looking game posters to hang up in the window.  (Keeps the interior
wholly artifically lighted, to avoid scaring much of the clientele....
:-)  They stay there for months, providing valuable advertising.
The sort of art IG is already featuring on the Web page might be quite
successful, combined with some good ad copy in an exciting typeface.

TSR has huge budgets and production values, but they seem quite 
successful with multi-page pull-out centerfold ads in gaming magazines 
(viz. their recent AD&D history trivia quiz or whatever it is).  I
don\'t know how monetarily prohibitive such a "souvenir piece" might
be -- say, a four-page insert on "high-tech" glossy paper, with the
front page taken by poster-style art, the second by the story of the
Traveller universe (Ziru Sirkaa to Long Night), the third by the call
of the resurgent Sylean Federation for new explorers and merchants 
(perhaps penned by noted industrialist Cleon Zhunastu himself?), and
the back page by the story of the game system itself (when DID Traveller 
start?  Can you pull a 1976 vs. 1996 schtick?), its own parallel 
resurgence, and the list of upcoming support and supplements (including, 
of course, a plug for the ever-growing Web page to show you\'re high-
tech in actuality as well as in fiction).

If IG made available a well-written, nicely-laid-out game ad/prospectus 
on the Web page in, say, Adobe Acrobat format, intended for distribution
to game retailers, I\'d happily download it, run down to Kinko\'s, print one 
out on their spiffy machines, and hand-carry it to my retailer.  I already
provide him with the occasional Internet tidbit, and I think he\'d get a 
charge out of such a distribution method.  You might be able to cover 
several major cities without paying postage.  :-)

You are essentially correct. I am looking at including a sensor set of

A brief update on the Traveller Sale & Auction I\'m running...

For the first two weeks of this run, I\'m taking bids. If you bid for an item
and nobody else bids on that item, then it will be a straight sale to you at
the end of the two weeks.

If there are multiple bids on an item, then we will go into auction mode for
the next two weeks.

If there is anything unsold after these first four weeks, then I\'ll probably
have a "fire sale" with gut-wrenching low prices. Gut-wrenching, that is, for
you--if you want something real bad, but think I\'m asking too much, your gut
will be wrenching while you wait four weeks (snicker).

I\'m not trying to make a profit here--merely trying to sell off duplicates
and get them into the hands of folks who can use them.

I currently have a number of individual bids on items, plus a block bid of
$300 cash or $400 in trade for the whole thing.

I received one piece of mail that (I hope jokingly) called me a racist for
disallowing non-US/Canadian customers from participating. Obviously this
person does not know me personally, as they would find that I am one of the
more mild and inoffensive persons around. So, as I said, I hope this was a
joke. Certainly, though, the accusation make my blood boil.

The reason for the exclusion on non-US/Canadian customes is simple: Several
years ago I sold off a number of items from my collection (mostly duplicates)
as I pared back. The ratio of money recieved to pain received was not good. I
had problems with shipping stuff overseas. I had problems with foreign
exchange rates. I had problems with people sending me checks with foreign
funds. I had problems with customs. I had problems with the Post Office (and
with foreign post offices). I had irate letters from people who could not
understand why their first class/airmail letter reached me faster than the
package I sent them--when they had paid for "ground" postage. Do you know
what "ground" postage to Europe gets you? A berth on the bananna boat, and
that ain\'t a fast way of travelling.

So excuse me if I exclude non-US/Canadian customers. I\'m trying to get this
stuff out with a minimum of hassle. I\'m not trying to hassle or exclude
folks--just trying to help you out and spread the wealth of information that
is currently locked in my basement.

Okay, time for the arts student to speak up (life\'s like a box of
chocolates...:-)!  I don\'t know where the rest of you get the time to spend
4 hours designing a starship for an RPG, but I have a life to worry about. 
FF&S is completely impractical for me and (I suspect) the vast majority of
the population out there.  I really like the HG design system, I can get
a ship up and running in 15 minutes.  That leaves me 3.75 hours to
actually RPG (or maybe like, y\'know, work or socialize or something!). If 
I need a ship in the middle of a session, I can send the players on a 
munchie run and by the time they get back, it\'s ready.

Sorry, this is sounding a little beligerent.  Too much caffeine I guess.  
But my point is that for me personally a return to HG is wonderful.  I 
could stand a _little_ more detail, but nothing like FF&S.  Detail (IMHO) is
pointless for role-playing purposes.  If what you get off on is designing
stuff, then do that, but I don\'t think it is integral to most people\'s 
concepts of roleplaying.  Certainly not the hordes of gamers who buy (and 
actually play!) such games as GURPS and the Storyteller series.

Having said that, I could live with an FF&S light product, but I think 
I\'m talking "fat-free" where others are thinking "calorie reduced".

    'body' => 'Okay, while we\'re taking a new look (or an old look made new, or whatever)
at Traveller starship construction, I\'ll draw some fire by talking about
the perennial problem of crew sizes.  Some heretical changes in Traveller
"canon" are going to come out of this, but I think the discussion might
prove interesting.

I\'d like to advocate the larger model of crew sizes used by TNE rather 
than the smaller model pursued first by CT and then by MT, but perhaps
with a stronger variation as tech level increases.  I\'ll support my 
position with some math below: for now let me address the role-playing
possibilities.

David Nilsen (whom I do _not_ regard as Truth Incarnate, but who strikes 
me as a smart, thoughtful fellow with some good ideas) defended the
larger crew sizes at one or another Origins talk by describing the
potential for NPC\'s (whether as social acquaintances, redshirts for
the bloody-minded beasties, etc.), technical difficulties to be solved 
by skill rolls and exciting role-play when the vessel\'s crew size
drops significantly (due to, say, starship combat, which also paid more
attention (laudably) to the individual in TNE), and a sense of greater
"realism".  One of the things that always disappointed me about TNE/FF&S
was the assumption that crew sizes had always been thus, even in the 
pre-Virus, heavily-computerized Third Imperium.  I wanted to hear about
cargo bays aboard relic starships partly transformed into extra state-
rooms to allow the RC\'s (or Free Traders\') TL12 human-controlled systems
to handle starships designed for the TL15 Imperials.  But somehow that
bit of chrome didn\'t make it in, except in a few GDW-beta discussions
on the topic.

More widely-varying crew sizes would also exacerbate TL differences
during interstellar wars, which would help explain Vargr futility in
attacking all but weakly-defended systems during the Frontier Wars,
the rapid Terran victory in the original Interstellar Wars after
leap-frogging the Vilani, and so on.

I\'ll take a fairly hard-line approach below, and my assumptions are of 
course open to argument.  For the sake of simplicity, I\'m going to assume
fairly steady rates of variation in the "assist" provided to crew by command-
and-control systems.  Linear rather than geometric progressions would change
the results a lot.

Now for some math:  I\'m using the "All Hands: Magazine of the U.S. Navy"
"Owner\'s and Operator\'s Manual" from January 1996.  A Los Angeles class
attack submarine (probably our closest analogy to a Traveller starship),
has a displacement (submerged) of 6,927 tons and a crew complement of
145 (p. 39).  Now, those are tons of water.  I figure an English ton is
around 908kg (though I\'m figuring this in spare time at work and might be 
off a smidgen here or there: I\'m sure someone will correct me if I\'m wrong!
:-).  So a displacement ton is around .9 m^3 (1 m^3 of water weiging 
1000kg).  So a displacement ton is around .9/14 or .0643 Traveller
tons (14 m^3 of LHyd weighing 1000kg).  And the Los Angeles submarine is
thus about 6,927 x 0.0643 = 445 tons, which seems about right.  (It\'s
a system defense boat!)

Now, with 145 crew for 445 tons, that\'s about 0.326 crew per ton.  CT\'s 
TL12 400-ton SDB, from CT Supplement 7 "Traders and Gunboats", has a crew 
of 10.  That\'s 0.025 per ton.  So the TL12 SDB requires 7.7% as much crew 
as the TL7 sub, on a ton-for-ton basis.  That\'s like achieving a 30% 
reduction in crew size at each tech level (12-7 = 5, (.077)^.2 = .60),
which I find only barely on the verge of believable.  At that rate, a
TL15 SDB would require only 1.7% as much crew as the sub (.60^8 = 0.05),
or about 0.006 crew per ton (that\'s two people for the entire SDB).

MT kept the crew size for the SDB about the same, at 12 (p. 85 Imperial
Encyclopedia, though I don\'t have the errata handy with me, alas).  TNE
yanked the crew requirement for the SDB to 24 (p. 373 main rule book),
which, at a ratio of 0.06 (18% the sub), gives a decline rate of about 
29%.  Hmmm.

Let\'s assume that a true "singleship" (e.g. an IISS Scout/Courier, which 
we\'re told can be run by one person in a pinch (which would be 0.1 persons
per ton)) only becomes possible at TL15.  This yields a decline rate of
24%, which somehow I feel happier about.  The SDB, at TL12, would thus
have a crew size (roughly) of [(.86)^5]*.326*400 = 61.

Now hold on there with the tar and feathers!  I don\'t have any problem 
with that crew size for a vessel that\'s got to be able to maintain itself 
while hiding out in gas giants while armed with heavy ordnance (nuclear
missiles, sensitive lasers, or what-have-you).  And that\'s still less 
than a third of what a modern nuclear submarine has to work with, under
much less challenging conditions.  The higher crew size, in fact,
INCREASES my sense of wonder rather than lessening it, thinking about
all those guys scrambling around the ship while prowling on patrol.

A non-military vessel like, say, the standard far trader (200 tons), 
might be able to get away with, say, a third of the ratio of a military
ship (fewer complex and highly-ruggedized systems, no necessity for 
redundancy in case of casualties, etc.).  So our Empress Marava, at 
TL12, might need only [(.86)^5]*.109*200 = 10 crew.  And by TL 15, in 
the height of the Third Imperium, far traders would be down to 
[(.86^8)]*.109*200 = 6 or 7 crew, around the size of the stereotypical
gaming group.

Traveller\'s huge capital starships would now become truly impressive war 
machines on the _human_ scale as well as the purely physical one.  We\'d
have a good explanation for the failure of many TL9 or TL10 cultures,
during the Long Night, say, to form self-sufficient interstellar trading
communities (a crew of (.86^3)*.109*200 = 14 on a far trader crimps
the economics a bit more, except, perhaps, to visionaries like Cleon
Zhunastu, who see what wider trade and technical dissemination will do
for his people).

Comments?  Suggestions?  I think I\'ve managed to keep things _reasonably_
close to the CT scale, except for military vessels (which I always found
too small) and low-tech ships (which adds to the allure of "trading up"
to higher-tech equipment).  Heck, I might throw these into a home-grown
campaign even if IG doesn\'t in the formal rules-set.  And I don\'t even
belong to GDW-beta... maybe I should join all the other heretics over
there....  :-)

Both would probably motivate me.  Getting TV ads during popular SF shows, or
on the SF Channel (which I can\'t get :(  would be good, as would print ads
in popular SF magazines.  However, just make sure the ads are well done, and
show what the game will be like.

I like this idea.  It sounds pretty good.  I know that with my local gaming
store, they\'ll pretty much order in ANYTHING.  However, the trick is in
getting them to stock the item regularly.  If you made up something like an
information sheet that we could download and take in that\'d be good.  Only
problem is that colour graphics would be lost on me as my printer only does B&W.

If Imperial Games feels they need two systems (one in the main rules, one

simple system and the MT rules as the complex one. 

I also like the way the MT rules are the same for vehicles, small craft,
and starships, and recommend that this unity be kept.

  US Subs are actually not as automated as they could be. The newest
Swedish sub (Gotland, around 1500 tons submerged) has a wartime crew of 
around 17. For example there is only one man at the helm, not four+one
officer to oversee them.

A bit of background...

The other night, on X-boat, tc@library.solent.ac.uk asked if anyone 
was going to publish the rumored \'unfinished DGP Aliens Modules.  
That tickled my memory; back when GDW was going down and no one here 
knew what was going on, I\'d thought that Rger Sanger had mentioned 
something about the rights to DGP stuff.  I wrote him, and he\'s given 
me permission to quote his reply:

- ---- Forwarded Message Follows ---- 
Dear Bruce,
 
Thankyou for your interest in DGP\'s operations. DGP is working
diligently on its very own game system. We\'re working on a set of
core rules, and 3 distinct campaign settings. We have no idea
when these will be ready for publication.
 
We are also looking forward to rereleasing DGP\'s Traveller
archives in various forms, and we are interested in publishing
new works for the Traveller game system. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN
NEGOTIATIONS WITH IMPERIUM GAMES & MARC MILLER. We\'re in
agreement on the general terms of the licensing contract, but
these things take time, and there are still details to be worked
out. Just as soon as the contract is signed, we will get back to
work on Traveller. We won\'t even wait for the ink to dry!
 
And yes, there are unfinished Traveller projects in DGP\'s
archives in various stages of completion.
 
I hope I\'ve answered your questions satisfactorily.
 
Sincereley,

>So what would make YOU more aware of Traveller and make you want to

In here you\'re preaching to the choir!  I think we\'re all motivated to
seek out a copy of T4 and look it over.  <g> The general gaming public
is much less aware of Traveller.

Two quick stories:

    The other day I was in one of local game/comic stores that carries
a good selection of used games (looking for a copy of World Builders
Handbook which they didn\'t have ;<), and struck up a short
conversation with a teen.

He said, "Do you play?"

"Yes, mainly Traveller.", I replied waving at the display of
CT/MT/TNE/TW2K/2300 books.

"Traveller?  Is that like Magic?"

"No, it\'s role playing, science fiction.  A new version is coming out
in August."

"Oh.", he looks blank for a second, "It\'s like DnD, huh?"

IG has it\'s work cut out!  This kid was an avid card gamer, in a game
store, standing in front of a shelf with >50 CT/MT/TNE titles, and
didn\'t have the slightest idea what Traveller was.

  The next day I dropped in at a card shop to pick up a birthday card. 
This shop is where I bought MT when it came out, 2300, 1889, TW2K,
TNE, and where I always bought JTAS and Challenge Mag. After picking
out the card, I browsed through their game section, and found a few
lonely MT, 2300, TW2K and TNE suppliments scattered among the
Gurps/AD&D/WW stuff.  One of the shopkeepers came back, saw what I was
looking at and told me...

"Oh, that\'s dead.  The company went out of business."

"GDW? Yes, I know."

"All that stuff is 50% off we\'re closing it out."

"Did you know a new version of Traveller is coming out in August?", I
ask.

"No...I thought they were out of business?"

"Oh, it\'s a new company, Imperium Games.  They\'re going back to the
feel of the first version.  The buzz is that this new one is going to
be really good."

"I\'ll have to ask our distributer about it.", she says but she doesn\'t
sound enthusastic.
  
Now, here\'s a shop that\'s stocked everything Traveller since the CT
days, and they don\'t know anything about it today other than..."it\'s
dead, and the company is out of business."
  
Is this depressing?

Shouldn\'t be!  Look on it as an opportunity.  Traveller is going to
have to be marketed to the public, many distributers and most shops as
if it were a brand *new* game.  IG is going to have to ignite a fire. 
They need to be contacting distributers
bombarding them with marketing materials and samples NOW!  They must
get marketing materials into the hands of shop owners NOW! They\'ve got
to raise the gaming public\'s awareness of Traveller.
  
>One thought I had was a specific piece each of you should
>download and print out to take to YOUR game store to twist his arm

Couldn\'t hurt!

There are 2 or 3 stores in my town that will probably carry T4, if
they can get it from a distributer, if folks ask for it, and if
there\'s some kind of buzz generated around it\'s release. 


BTW, in the past I\'ve talked with the owners of 2 of the stores and
both of them have bad things to say about trying to move MT. They were
leary about stocking TNE stuff, but they continued to stock TW2K books
all along.  I had to special order most of what I got from them after
TNE came out.

Steve\'s Expanded USP
XX-000000AB0-000000C-00000-0

1.  Sensors (and Detection Rules)
I have always used two additional values in the UPP to describe the Active and 
Passive Sensors on the ship (noted by A and B in the sample USP above).  The 
Passive Sensors were available in a number of different sizes/powers, 
restricted by the size of the ship and its tech level (as well as the bank 
account of the ship builder).  The Active Sensors were also available in a 
number of different sizes/powers, restricted by the ship\'s Computer and Tech 
Level.  Different sensor packages had different ranges, and in some cases had 
better performance in special circumstances (detecting things in an atmosphere, 
or high-radiation area etc).  The passive sensors were all basically the same, 
differentiated mainly by detection range.

But of course Sensors are of little use without sensor rules.  I used straight 
High-Guard combat for squadron actions, but for ship-to-ship battles or similar 
small engagements I would use a combination of Mayday movement rules and High 
Guard combat.  In Full-Scale High Guard combat the sensors were fairly 
lobotomized.  Sensors would allow the squadron commander to get initiative, and 
could be used as jammers against the other side\'s sensors.  Their main High 
Guard effect was sensors acted as Fire Directors for missiles.  The sensor 
would allow only a certain number of missiles to be controlled per turn.  In 
the "tactical" combat sensors would work to detect the target and to lock on, 
as well as to detect incoming missiles and other surprises (very similar to the 
2300AD sensor rules, though less complex).

Price drops 10% per TL above minimum.  Volume is constant.


2.  More Missile Information (Different Types?)
In the text of the ship description, I would include how many salvoes of 
missiles the ship carried.  Salvoes could be made up of any of several types of 
missile:  Contact, Proximity, Antiradiation, Nuclear Contact, Nuclear 
Proximity.  Contact missiles depended on pure explosive power to damage the 
target.  Proximity missiles would either explode when near a ship or lie in 
wait for a passing ship before exploding; filling space with lots of metal 
particles to damage the passing ship (due to relative velocities and other fun 
physis effects).  Antiradiation missiles were Contact missiles designed to home 
in on radiation or sensor signatures (no controller required!).  Nuclear 
Contact missiles were like normal contact missiles, but far more devastating.  
Nuclear Proximity Missiles acted like the normal Proximity Missile, but instead 
of fast-moving fragments they depended on EMP to damage their enemies.  Except 
for AntiRadiation Missiles, all missiles would require sensor assistance for 
control guidance to target.

3.  Point Defense Weapons
Like Sensors, I altered the USP to support Point Defense batteries.  These 
batteries were low-powerd lasers that lacked the range to acck other starships, 
but could be used to attack incoming missiles or fighters.  The advantage to 
these weapons was that the batteries fired twice in defense: once during the 
normal defensive fire portion of combat, and once as a "second chance" when a 
successful hit was scored by a missile.  The PD Lasers could also fire on 
nearby fighters at the end of movement.  And best of all for the bloodthirsty, 
the PD lasers made excellent antipersonnel weapons while the ship was in port.  
These lasers had the same characteristics as the standard lasers.

4.  Computers
I added volume differentiation by tech level to computers (Yes, you can have a 
TL6 Model 9 computer, but its Megahuge).  I assumed that the Computer included 
other controls and communications gear, so I was not overly bothered by some of 
the volume restrictions, but I did feel that volume could be sacrificed to get 
desired computer technology earlier.  One thing I did do was largely do away 
with Computer Programs.  They really did not seem to add much to the game.  
However, I see no reason why software cannot be left in the game for those 
people who like that sort of thing.

In General
I am very hopeful that at some point in the future an effort is made to provide 
FF&S-like design rules for the various starship and vehicle subsystems, which 
produce results consistent with your "Base-Level" starship rules.  I thought 
High Guard design was an order of magnitude better than Book 2 Design, and I 
thought that FF&S/Brilliant Lances was an order of magnitude better than High 
Guard.  I really liked the details given by FF&S, but I do appreciate the 
ease-of-use from High Guard.  Being greedya nd self-centered, I want the best 
of both worlds.  So hop to it!  I\'m part of the Instant Gratification 
Generation, after all, and I want to be gratified instantly.

Sreiously, though, I do wish you the best of luck Don & Co..  As you\'ve no 
doubt noticed, there are lots of opinions around here, and they only rarely 
agree with what you want to do at any given time.  Basically, I\'ll prbably do 
something similar to what I noted above whether its in T4 or not.  That\'s not 
going to stop me from buying T4, or using a lot of other T4 rules.  I was happy 
enough with the TNE rules, but I\'m fairly flexible.

I would favor: XX-0000000-000000-ABC for the simple reason that the
other stuff all stays in the same order as always.  Other than that,
pretty cool.  I\'d rather see the sensor/jammer factor just be scaled
straight to detection range (at "effective range," maybe (base
difficulty).  Add some DMs based on TL, config of target, etc. to get to
the special features of a specific system (eg: Scout sensors get a
beneficial DM for scanning planet surfaces from orbit (or something)).

Computer DMs would also apply, and you\'d need a certain computaional
ability (ie: factor) to generate fire control solutions at certain
ranges (ie:sensor factor).

Are these maximum possible range of lock-on?  If so, would you just
double (or some such) for gross bogey detection, etc.?

Explosive damage would almost always be small compared to the KE of the
missile (assuming multi-g ships and missiles).

I assume that this is "C" above.  I used "C" as Jamming, BTW.

I like this in some ways, but dislike it in others.  Lasers have always
been PD weapons.  It makes sense given the "only one type of weapon in
the USP" nature of the USP, I guess.  I\'d give them a DM on the damage
tables to reflect their lower strength, however----they have the same
stats because they fire lower powered pulses at higher ROFs.

I hate to be depressing here, but this reminds me a lot of conversation I
had with avid role players during the collapse of the boardgames market.
There are still a few boardgames companies out there, selling mostly to the
grognards (and a lot of transfer over into the computer games market) but
they have to fight hard -- on the other hand the market is probably pretty
stable these days.

So what\'s the average age in the roleplaying groups you know? -- bet its
higher than it used to be.

Now, I think that boardgamers did not work to extend their (our?)
demographic the way they should have.  A lot of us did not take the interest
in younger gamers that they should have.  And a lot of companies (SPI for
instance) tended to produce games for a more and more experienced and
dedicated gamers -- and painted themselves into a niche market.

I think the return to Traveller Mark 1 is a good idea.  The level of
complexity is perfectly good for NEW gamers -- the sort of gamers WE were
back in 1977.  What we should be doing is actively recruiting younger gamers
into the hobby, before we all go the way of the corner-clippers.

I know the complete MT errata is published somewhere on the net. Could
someone tell me where and how to get a copy.  How about FF&S errata,
is that available too?

Les!  Great post!

This makes a lot of sense.  A lot of folks have been saying that the CT 
rules were OK for 1977, but what is needed for today\'s gamers is 
something more advanced - like FF&S/FF&S Light.  But the scenario you 
paint, based on the true story of the wargames market, has the ring of 
truth.  To expand the market, we need games that are easy to learn, yet 
interesting to play - as interesting as Classic Traveller has always been.

A couple of weeks ago, I noted in a post that TSR has always made 
efforts to appeal to two markets: the new gamers, and the dedicated 
gamers.  They have appealed to both of these markets since the inception 
of AD&D.  Throughout AD&D\'s history they have had products like Dungeon! 
and D&D (and now some sort of "AD&D Light" system), which offer new 
gamers a clear way to enter the complex world of AD&D (and despite the 
lack of complexity in each individual system (comat, magic, etc.), the game 
overall IS complex, if only for the fact that there are dozens of books 
- - even entire full-length books dedicated to single subjects) without a 
massive investment of money and time just to decide whether the game is 
something they will enjoy.

TSR\'s method has its merits, but I think the classic Traveller way of 
doing things (the core rules are easy to learn yet effective and 
complete, while replacement systems are sold separately for those who are 
interested) is more appropriate for a game lacking name recognition in 
the general population (I don\'t know how many times I\'ve said 
"role-playing games" and gotten a blank stare, only to get recognition 
when I say, "you know...like Dungeons and Dragons").  The average 
prospective gamer isn\'t going to want to put the effort into learning a 
"light" version of Traveller in hopes of getting some supposed benefit 
later when the "real" core rules are purchased.  With AD&D, they may do 
so, because they have some idea what AD&D is.  But Traveller just does 
not have that type of pull on non-role-players (nor many role-players, I 
would bet). 

If IG offers them a collection of rules that are straight-forward, easy 
to learn, and complete (and makes it clear that all official products may 
be played using nothing more than those rules) they may make that initial 
purchase.  Then, if they want to replace this system or that by buying 
an additional book, they can do so by their own choice /without learning 
any complex systems beyond those they wish to learn/.  Unlike with AD&D, 
it won\'t be an all-or-nothing proposition.  The basic rules will be the 
common denominator, while the complex rules will be the exception for 
those who enjoy additional realism and detail.

I honestly believe the CT system, with minor modifications, is the best 
system to use as the core rules.  I hope IG still agrees with me.

Hello,

I recently bought a copy of challenge #70, the GDW 20th Aniverisary issue.
When I turned to the Traveller News Service, all I found was a bunch of
scrambled junk.  What is this?  Does anyone else have this in their copies
or what?

     That depends.  I\'ve been playing Traveller since 1980, and in that
time, I\'ve never done any role-playing.  I\'m playing a *game*, not a
*role*.  Frankly, the fun for me was the "far future engineering."  The
characters were like chess pieces.  The nice thing was that Traveller
could accomodate both viewpoints.

     Why can\'t we have both?  Simple basic rules, and insanely complex
add-ons?

My solution was to let robots replace crewmembers, but to give them (robots)
absolutely no initiative when routine operations were departed from.  In game
terms, ships with robots had their initiative severely crippled in combat,
and had negative modifiers for all emergency tasks.

This seemed to work satisfactorily.  A merchant on a safe, fixed route could
save money by using robots.  One in the Marches, with the possibility of
Vargr corsairs, or a tramp trader refueling at gas giants, would be better
off with expensive but flexible sapients.

I used the same general rule for robotic weapons.  Very good at "shoot
anything that comes over the hill", not so good at "stop the assault while
minimizing civilian casualties".

    'body' => 'One point I haven\'t heard mentioned -- but I feel is a critical one -- is 
that, in order to succeed on the wider RPG market, Traveller *cannot* 
have a primarily military emphasis.  GDW came out of the wargaming end of 
things, and as version after version came out, Traveller got more and 
more military.  In fact, the Shattered Imperium seemed (at least to me) 
to be an excuse for more and more military campaigning, while making some 
other kinds of civilian adventuring a hell of a lot more difficult.

As a military RPG, T4 will fail.  It will die.  It has no chance.

I recognize that what I\'m saying may be anathema to a number of you.  You 
like designing combat ships, maybe you like playing Striker, whatever.  
Understand, though, that you are a rapidly-shrinking minority of the RPG 
community.  You, like me, probably started with wargames.  If so, you 
come to the RPG field with a very different cultural background than 
almost anyone born after 1975.  Wargaming, paper wargaming, is now a 
fringe market.  (I consult to a game store here in one of the best gaming 
markets in the country.  I know the numbers.)  Games like MT, TNE, and 
T:2000 failed in large part because there is no real market for 
military-based RPGs (with the possible exception of powered-armor-and-
big-guns Anime-type stuff).  And the market is getting *even smaller*.

If T4 is to survive, it *must* *not* be focused on military gaming.  If 
it looks like a military game, new RPGers will not buy it.  It needs to 
have civilian careers, ideas for exploration, for "culture-shock" gaming, 
for merchanting -- and those need to be right up front, even if that 
means shunting some of the military stuff to the background.  The plan to 
do different backgrounds works well with this.

I\'m not saying that the military gaming aspect should be eliminated -- 
just that concentrating on military gaming will chase away potential 
players, while exciting only those who already love Traveller.  Imperium 
Games should avoid falling back into GDW\'s focus on warfare, if it 
doesn\'t want to fall like GDW did.  If T4 is to succeed, it must attract 
the non-military, role-playing-intensive, segment of the RPG market.  
That\'s the segment that is growing, while the old wargamers get older and 
older, have kids, and drift out of the hobby.  (And the new wargamers 
never leave their computer screens.)

That is the virus of Traveller The New Era asserting itself and taking over
the News Services.  Communications started breaking up in Challenge 69 and
resulted in what you see in Challenge 70.  By Challenge 71 communication is
just beginning to come back to normal at the end of the News Service article.
 If you pick up a copy of Survival Margin: Gateway to the New Era, it shows
this pretty good with reprints of  the Traveller News Service from 1116 to
1130 along with personal communications from the Emperor and other reprints
from Challenge.  In Challenge 72 the Traveller News Service is replaced with
the CINetwork Coalition Information Network and the year has jumped to 1201. 

 Welcome the the New Era :).

    'body' => 'I was just thinking of how my group played Traveller for the first few 
years.  We didn\'t design ships at all.  We just used stock ships from the 
Deluxe Traveller (Starter Edition) rules book.  Once I purchased 
supplement 7: Traders and Gunboats, we used those designs.  Although we 
had High Guard, we only used it for character generation.  I owned 
Supplement 9, too, but it just sat on the shelf.

None of us liked the starship combat rules.  They seemed way too 
complex.  We were there to role-play, not fight a wargame.  We wanted 
something quick, easy, and fun.  So, I made some modifications.

Out went the software rules.  I crossed all defensive weapons off the 
lists.  I got rid of all offensive weapons other than beam lasers.  You 
could put from one to three beam lasers on a turret.  Fire that turret, 
and the only DM\'s were plus gunner skill and minus the opponant\'s pilot 
skill.  No ranges, no maneuvering tactics.

When rolling for hit location, a DM of +1 was allowed if two beam lasers 
were on the turret that scored the hit.  If it had three beam lasers, the 
DM was +2.  The player had the option of taking the whole DM, part of it, 
or none at all.  There were no DM\'s to the critical hit chart.

Then I made up rules for specific ship repair costs (hull breach costs, 
for example).  

That was all there was to it.  

And we had a ball.  We actually began looking forward to space combat.  
I designed some adventures around it.  Heck, we even ran some space 
combats outside of the adventure context, just because it was fun!

A few years later, having had all these good experiences with space 
combat, we took another look at the basic rules.  We instituted those for 
a while, then jumped right into High Guard.  It was great, and we loved 
the added depth of play.  We even designed a few starships using the HG 
rules.  Finally, we had learned the value of complexity.

Maybe this will prove useful to IG in determining the direction to take 
Traveller (ie, whether to use their stated goal of a return to CT, or to 
go with something more complex for the basic rules).  Maybe it will also 
remind us all of the way we were way back when. :)  It takes time for new 
gamers to work up to complex systems.  I would like them to have that 
opportunity.

I\'m not advocating using my extremely simple system.  That would be a 
sure way to drive a lot of potential customers and new gamers away! :)  
But a system such as is given in Book 2 would be good. It is simple 
enough that a person new to gaming can modify it into something s/he 
likes better.  And later, when they decide they want something with a 
bit more to it, that system will be there.  Finally, they will be able 
to upgrade to the most complex system, be it HG or FF&S based.

I like the idea of offering a detailed version of /every/ Traveller 
system, including ship design.  And for me personally, if T4 has a system 
I don\'t like it is no problem.  I\'ll either design my own or use a CT 
system instead.  Either way, I don\'t lose.  

I just don\'t want to see potential customers turned away because they are 
daunted by an overly complex core rules system.  Most people aren\'t going 
to be as passionate about Traveller as we all are.  To them, it is just 
a game - a diversion - not something to spend a lot of time on.

Anyway, enough blathering.  

Thanks for reading,

I gotta agree.  Universal profiles aren\'t bad for 6 string 
characteristics, and the UWP\'s, but the nearly 30 digit strings used 
in High Guard are tedious to work with...the learning curve is steep.

lot of suggestions have been put forth, but it sounds like most people 
have many contacts in many game stores in their area.  My situation is a 
bit different.  I\'ve only lived here for a few years, so I don\'t have the 
advantage I would if I were still in northern CA, where I grew up.

In addition, where I live (northeastern Illinois), there aren\'t a whole 
lot of RPG stores (Games+ is the only one I know of in Lake County).  
There\'s Gamers\' Paradise, but they seem to be concentrating on videogames, 
puzzles, board games, and other non-RPG stuff.  Plus, their RPG section 
leaves much to be desired.  Take out the AD&D stuff and the Games 
Workshop stuff, and you don\'t have much left.  This is even more true of 
the area comic book shops.  They carry AD&D and a few White Wolf 
products, and that\'s about it.  

Given that, how in the heck is Traveller going to gain a wide audience 
around here?  I can\'t go to these stores and tell them all that I want 
them to carry T4 because I\'ll buy it from them - I\'m not going to lie to 
get them to carry the game.  I can go there and talk to them about this 
great new/old game that is coming out, but from the existing product 
selection, I have doubts that would be effective.

I am sure that Games+ will carry it (they carry everything - even a 
surprising amount of out-of-print stuff).  Gamers\' Paradise is a chain, 
so I don\'t think working on them would do much good.  I think the best 
chance lies with the independently owned comic book shops.  Perhaps I 
should just go in and talk to the owner, eh?  I don\'t know these people, 
though.  Are they going to listen to me?

Is anyone else in a situation similar to mine?  What are your plans?  Any 
recommendations?

Thanks,

I\'m in the same boat as you are. I live in South Jersey, and there are only
a couple of comic book stores, and they only carry AD&D stuff. I suppose
I could find someplace in Philadelphia to buy games, but it\'s been easier
for me to just order stuff from Wargames West, who carries everything. I
wouldn\'t know the first thing to tell one of these small store-owners. I
don\'t even have a group to play with anymore (when I graduated from
college in 1993, everybody split up), so, yes, I\'ll buy the new game, but
until I find another group to referee, I\'m not going to be much of a support
person for it.

These small guys can only afford to stock what will sell. The question we
have to deal with is, will the new Traveller sell? Thats up to the marketing
people, I think. We all got into Traveller when we were kids and had time
to spend coming up with these grandiose campaigns. Now we\'re grown
and have families and the time just isn\'t there. Can Traveller be marketed
successfully to today\'s RPG\'ers? I believe so, because AD&D started
with our generation, and still is successful today. The decision is more in
the hands of IG than it is in ours. 

Am I right or am I completely off my rocker? :)

 Which is more official for the capital of the People\'s Republic of
 China - "Peking" or "Beijing"?

 That\'s about how I view this kind of difference - both "Massilia"
 and "Massila" are reasonable "Galanglicizations" of the Vilani
 name for the sector, "Masilaa".

Just as an aside; I friend of mine who is a native of Hong Kong (yes, he
*is* desperately trying to find a way to become a permanent resident of
the USA) when asked the Peking/Beijing question replied that one was Man-
darin (Beijing) & the other Cantonese (Peking). Something similar could
easily be at work here. GDW-ese vs DGP-ese perhaps? ;*)

Hi All.  The discussion on sonic stunners has been missing a fundamental 
point: differing atmospheric densities.  Depending on what world you were 
on and what the weather conditions were, the stunner would have to be 
calibrated differently.  This would be quite a complex thing, though not 
outside the capabilities of a small computer and air-pressure sampling 
device.  You would also have to calibrate the stunner based on race (and 
perhaps the size of the opponent?).  A sonic stunner would not work in 
vacuum or trace atmospheres, and would probably have difficulty in very 
thin ones.  Depending on the exact nature of exotic atmospheres, there might 
be problems here as well.  Also, rain and snow might have adverse 
effects.  When in water or dense atmospheres, the stunner might have 
better range, though it would have to be properly adjusted.

This sort of calibration problem is common with other non-lethal weapons
as well.  Tranq rounds, for instance, have to be adjusted to body 
size of opponent as well as species.  This is why lethal weapons are favored

    'body' => 'I\'ve been waiting for somebody to present an actual suggestion for an
improved ship design process.  Nobody has, so I will.  I\'m really
going to hang myself out here, so be kind. <g>

I\'m not a "gearhead", especially, when it comes to ship design.
Actually, my area of interest is star systems and I\'d rather be
working on that, but this has so captured my attention that I\'m going
to get squat done until I get this out of the way.

I don\'t present this process as *the* way to go.  All I want to do is
stimulate some thought about the process.  Something detailed enough
to please the FF&S people, but easy enough for the rest of us.

What I\'m proposing is to create ships from standard parts that can be
picked from tables and plugged together.   This doesn\'t differ much
from the FF&S lite concept, but I think my pieces  are less finely
grained.  I\'m also coming at this from a CT/HG/MT direction rather
than FF&S.

                        Simple Ship Design

1.  Set Ship\'s main function:  Scout, Merchant, Combat, etc.

2.  Decide base tech level

3.  Choose standard hull size (increments of 100 Tons).

4.  Pick Bridge Package from Bridge Table.
       (Each Bridge Package includes basic controls, equipment &
        workspace for basic Command and Control functions:  Comm,
        Sensors, Computer, Security, Maneuver, Jump, &
        Astrogation.)

5.  Optional Bridge additions:
    a.  Communications
    b.  Sensors
    c.  Computer
    d.  Security
    e.  Screens
    f.  Aux controls

6.  Pick Engineering Package from Engineering Table    
       (Each Engineering Package includes basic controls &
        workspace for power generation, maneuver drive, jump
        drive, & a basic repair shop.)

7.  Optional Engineering additions:
    a.  Machine Shop
    b.  Electronic Shop
    c.  Weapons Shop
    d.  Gravtics Shop
  
8.  Jump Drive
    a.  Pick Jump Drive for the J factor desired and for the hull
        size from the Jump Drive Table.
    b.  Volume of fuel needed for 1 jump = (Vol of Jump Drive) * 5       


9.  Maneuver Drive
    a.  Pick Maneuver Drive for the G factor desired and for the
        hull size from the Maneuver Drive Table.    
    
10. Install Weapons Systems from Weapon Tables.
        (I\'m not going to detail this here. Surfice it to say
         we\'re talking about standard plug in weapons like in the
         example.)
        
        
11. Install Defensive Systems from Tables
        (Same as with Weapons.  The tables would have plug in
         systems.)


12. Pick number of standard Accommodations from Accom Table.
    a.  Low Berths
    b.  Bunks
    c.  Small Staterooms
    d.  Large Staterooms
    e.  Commons Areas

13. Gravity Control
    a.  GVOL = Sum of volumes under gravity control
    b.  Look up Grav Ctrl factors P and C from Gravtic Table
    c.  Calculate Power required = GVOL*P
    d.  Calculate Cost = GVOL*C

14. Life Support
    a.  LVOL = Sum of volumes under gravity control
    b.  Look up Life Support factors P and C from LF Table
    c.  Calculate Life Support power required = LVOL*P
    d.  Calculate Life Support cost = LVOL*C
        
15. Power System
    a.  PwrReq = (Sum of power required)*1.5 for safety
    b.  Add enough standard Generators to exceed PwrReq, look on
        Power Systems Table
    c.  This is PwrAvail

16. Fuel for Maneuver Drive, Weapons and Ship Systems
    a.  How many weeks of fuel?
    b.  (fuel/hr from Power Systems Table)*PwrAvail*Weeks*168
    
17. Determine current volume

18. Misc
    a.  Increased Compartmentalization: +1% current volume
    b.  Streamlining for atmospheric flight: +1% current volume
    c.  Bracing for landing on planets: +1% current volume

19. Cargo Space
    a.  Total current volume
    b.  Cargo = ((Hull Size)*14) - current volume
        (This is the cubic meters of cargo space to figure the
         tons divide this number by 14.)

20. Fill out a Standard Ship Form.


And here\'s an example I built with the process...

Folks, I haven\'t got all these tables completed.  That\'s something for
Don to do..or maybe for us to do here. <g> 

Right now the tables consist, in most cases, of 1 entry..the 1 entry I
used to produce my example..and that entry is more a skeleton than a
complete body. Here\'s an example...

        The Bridge Package Table 

        Volume    Pwr Req   Crew   Cost
       in cub M    in MW    Req   in Mcr
Pack1    168        8.0      2     18.0

[probably should use tons instead of cubic meters??]


Pack1 consists of (at the tech level you\'ve chosen):

  Standard Comm package:    System Radio
                            Laser Tightbeam
                            
  Standard Sensor pack:     Passive EMS Interstellar
                            Active EMS Far Orbit              

  Computer:     1/bis
                4 bridge consoles
  
  Standard Life Support Control
  
  Standard Security Control
  
  Standard Gravtics Control    
  
  Flight Control (for Maneuver and Jump)
      Pilot Station
  
      Co-Pilot Station
  
  Astrogation Table
- ----  

Does this give you an idea of what I mean by a Package?  

The Jump Drives would be discrete units designed to boost a given
volume into jump space.

Maneuver Drives would also be a discrete unit based on standard
volume.

Power Generators (Fusion Plants really) would be standard sized units
that produce a standard power out and use a standard amount of
fuel/hr.  I based mine on a standard 6 (2x2x1.5) cubic meter size
using cold fusion to generate 4MW, admittedly this didn\'t come from
any canonical source.

The details could be designed down to as fine a point as you want. 
The data could be presented on a level not much more detailed than CT. 
It could also be *very* detailed.

Ok, does this make sense to anybody?  Is this too complicated? To
simple?  Should I just go back to my star systems and forget this?

Whoa!  I *really* don\'t think that\'s likely to happen.  <g> I sort of
depend on the UPs presenting stuff in a standard order.

I understand how you feel.  I have the same problem..don\'t we all?  So
get inventive!

What I try to do, when I can, is to transfer UP\'s onto forms I\'ve made
up.  UP stuff goes in vertically with a short discription to the left,
and more detail to the right.  That way I don\'t have to remember/look
up what each number means, and I have a record I can store and where I
can make changes.  Here are a couple of examples of what I mean.

I think I\'m part of the vast majority.  Fifteen to twenty years ago, when I
was in college and especially between college and grad school, I did spend
hours and hours polishing and tweaking HG and Striker designs, but not any
more (kind of like my friends who had old sports cars:  "If I can just find
an original rear-view mirror and rebuild the photonic transducer, it\'ll be
almost cherry").  

On the other hand, I don\'t object to time-consuming detail, if someone
else\'s time is consumed.  So I\'ll buy ship and vehicle designs and deck
plans by the score and have them available to use "off the shelf".

Yes, I know my example was based on something I happened to have at
hand. A better idea...

Of course.  <g> The Johnson/Lewis 2T-4MW is but one model that would
be available on a table.  I\'m with you on larger size models, but not
too many, or you lose the economy of
*manufacturing* scale!  One or two at the 4 to 8 level, the 30 to 40
level and the 100 to 200 level, maybe.  Power Plant designs can be
created and published like anything else.

Now the but...

1.  My ship is being built on Kittle Prime by Drise and Son,
Shipbuilders.  I want to built inexpensively, so they are using as
many "off the shelf" parts as possible.  They happen to have 40, 4MW
generators in stock left over from some system boat work they were
doing for the local navy and so...<g>

2.  Seriously, I visualize Traveller ships to be a good bit like steam
ships early this century.  All large steam ships had multiple
boilers..why?  So one could be taken down for service or repair and
still have 3/4, 1/2 power.  Warships, especially, would want
redundancy.

>plant, and have a little excess capacity, or I can install a 75MW, a

I\'d try to get ship designers to avoid that if possible.  I think 3 to
6 "boilers" of the same model would be better:  easier to repair;
interchangeable parts; less training/maintenance overhead for the
engineer.

You\'ve added a *lot* since I dropped by last week!  <g> I dled all
your pages tonight..this morning so I can study them off line.  

Two things to think about...

First, I think some of your systems might be too finely grained. Group
*everything* needed for a 3 or 4 standard bridges together and make
that a plug in.  Let folks customize by adding on enhanced
controls/computers/sensors as a more advanced process. It looks like
you\'re doing that for weapon systems already.

Second, we always pick the hull size & configuration first..what if we
didn\'t?  What if we did it backwards:  

1. picked out all the systems that go into the ship

2. put in a plant to power them

3. put in a maneuver drive 

4. put in tanks for the fuel

6. put in a jump drive and fuel for it

5. put in a minimum cargo area

6. added it all up and picked the next biggest hull

Would that be easier for everybody than having to keep fiddling trying
to fit everything in a 800ton hull?

I can\'t do anymore tonight!

Yes!  This is what I advocated in my previous post.  Provide basic 
components in a few charts, with notes that they are of such-and-such 
configuration, and this will solve the compatability issue.  Sure, 
provide all the statistics but don\'t require the user to make design 
decisions on each statistic.  For example:

Standard Hulls Table

Tons	Main	Drives	Max. Accel.	Configuration	MCr	Time
100	85	15	2G		Needle		2	9
100	75	25	4G		Wedge		3	9
200	185	15	1G		Sphere		8	11
200	175	25	2G		Cylinder	9	11
...etc...

Include some basic configurations.  Additional ones could be included in 
a supplement, in JTAS, or whatever.  This sort of table would provide all 
the information required to reconstruct the exact same thing under the 
full system, with the same result in time, cost, etc.  Obviously, I 
didn\'t include everything (ie, armor) in the above table, but it could be 
done (I just took the table in Book 2, and modified it based on what is 
required for a full-up system, and also what sort of drive compartment 
size is required to fit a standard drive that would allow the given-sized 
hull to achieve the acceleration given as the maximum).  A gearhead could 
do a much better job of constructing such a table, I know.  This is just 
a quick-n-dirty example for illustration.

Pardon my ignorance, but what is a "storytelling-style combat resolution 
system?"  Any resemblence to the Book 2 system?

Yes, it would!  Good idea.

Sounds good, so long as one of the above is something like Book 2...

    'topic' => 'My NSHO :)',
    'body' => 'Ok, once in a while I feel like commenting on everybody else\'s ideas.
:) Don\'t we all? :)

	1) I agree that the Military side of Traveller MUST be
downplayed.  CT was very good at being a \'generic hard s-f\' game
system, and it was hailed as such.  It\'s time to go back to that.  
Maybe it has to do with the RPG population becoming more mature and
realizing that guns can kill people, and htat\'s not so funny?
Anyways, I could never interest the players in a purely
combat-orientated adventure, unless the characters were really
interesting (Say, something like \'The Eagle has Landed\' or really
quirky people).

	2) Don\'t get rid of UWP, but don\'t force us to use them all
the time either!  UPPs are really useful for computer stuff, but
there\'s no way a player who\'s only there for a couple of hours of fun
is going to bother learning what the 30 digits of a ship design
means... All they care about is \'Are we going to die?\'?  :)
So I hope that only the stuff that really can\'t go in another format
goes into the UP\'s... 

	3)  Ship design.  Well, in my opinion it should be MODERATELY
complex.  Why?  Because for one thing, only the referee OR a player
truly interested will bother with it.  If it\'s too simple, they\'ll be
dissapointed.  If it\'s too complex, they\'re going to drop parts of it
anyway.  
	What SHOULD be included in the base rules is a s system for
quickly rolling up a ship when the ref is in a bind.  Say your
players go off you map and you roll a random ship encounter for a
type you don\'t have plans for.  You\'re not going to design it on the
spot.  What you need are tables to generate what the PLAYER\'S
perception of the ships will be.  That will be data coming out of
sensor scans or things that the players can see with their own eyes.

So basically what you do is have a 3 column table:
Dice roll  Ship Type	Hull Volume
2	   Shuttle	50
3	   Scout	100
...
7	   Cruiser	400
...
12	   Fleet Cargo	200000
So the ref can either roll up a size randomly or if he already has an
idea of the type of ship, he can go up to the line for a \'reasonable\'
size for that ship.  Make the same tables for the other systems.

Now obviously these numbers will be only approximations - but that\'s
my point.  There is NO way a character will know precisely to the
last decimal the actual hull size of any ship, unless they\'re naval
architect.  Go to the Entreprise Aircraft Carrier and tell me what
you think the hull size is - nobody will come up with the same
numbers.
So the referee can fudge things this way.  And if he actually ever
NEEDS the correct numbers, he can design the ship later.

This is, in any case, something that I would use.  (Of course the
final tables would be more complex than that - 1000 kL hulls won\'t
use 2 MW power plants :).

4) Getting Traveller Support;  I have yet to reply to Mr Collin\'s
letters about how to get the stores to support T4, but I do have a
few ideas.  For instance, tell the owners WHO is working on the new
rules.  Most RPG store owners have some knowledge of the \'stars\' of
rpgs, like Elmore and such.  Print out the \'crew roster\' of IG found
on their web site and hand it out to the store owner.  Bring some
samples of the art/writings/games.  You should be able to get THEM to
be excited about the product. :)

Of course, even Leonardo Da Vinci must have made some turkeys in his
own time... :)  But you can sell anything as long as it has at least
one saving grace, like good art or a good system or whatever. :)

Sorry for rambling on like this. :)  

These are just my opinions, and they do not reflect those of my
employer, unless you\'re hiring. :)

Yes, it was all presented in separate books....which weren\'t available 
right away.  It took years for all that history to accumulate in many 
different books.

The original set, as it says on the back of the box it comes in, was 
designed to allow one to recreate the universe of "any of the many 
science-fiction novels available, with the action following the story 
line, or diverging when something interesting happens."  It was only 
later that the Imperium background was made available to players.

Seeing as how TV ads aren\'t likely to be seen over here (unless you 
put them on, say, MTV Europe ;-) those don\'t come noticeably high on 
my list.
Overall, I guess print ads (with nice art, but then, you\'ve 
got both Foss and Elmore, so that should be easy ;-) are most likely 
to catch my attention. But I seldom buy without having seen a product 
reviewed in a reputable mag. The word of a mag like, say, Pyramid 
means a lot to where I spend my gaming Kronor...
A nicely formated press-release/ad (maybe as a postscript file) is 
certainly something I\'d bring to the local shop. I think he\'d respond 
better to a direct mail from ImperialGames, but he listens to his 
customers. (Maybe you should take a leaf from SJG and put a form up 
on the web where you can get adresses to retail stores? After all, 
even if you manage the distribution, individual stores still need to 
find out you exist.)
Color ads in the classier computer gaming mags (CGW, Strategy+) would 
probably also be worthwile as many strategy gamers come from an 
rpg/boardgame background. You might even get one of them to give you 
at least a capsule review. Strategy+ has done that before on 
non-computer related stuff they liked.
Could even be worthwhile to put clickable ads on places like Games 
Domain. Perhaps.

My only comment on this is that I - and my players, back when we last 
ran Traveller  - *like* the possibility of a completely pc-crewed 
ship. No npc, no robots, no \'extra characters\', nothing. This, of 
course, is strictly from a playability perspective...

I\'m also inordinately fond of \'single-ship\' scouts. I just like the 
concept. Guess I\'m weird. ;-)

There should be some way to make ships require less crew by \'throwing 
money at the problem\'. (And vice versa for that matter...) If it\'s

Well, I have CT in three different formats, Small Book, 8x10 format books, and the Hardbound.  I use the hardbound almost exclusivlly.  It has some additional art work not found in the little books, and has a couple of adventure seeds in the back, in part half of the Double adventure Shadows/Annic Nova (it has Shadows).  It also has an NPC that was published in JTAS as an adventure seed.

I would get it for the art, and for the durability.  Use the small books for the players, and you use the hard back when you ref.

    'body' => 'No matter what the final design system is, we will need some way to
represent the results in a compact format, such as High Guard\'s Universal
Ship Profile (USP).  However, limitations of the USP format were one of
the things driving the (IMHO) rather artificial limitations on ship
weaponry (you couldn\'t have bay or turret particle accellerators if you
had a spinal installation, because there was only one position for
particle accellerators).

SO, I propose breaking out the offensive weapons into separate groups for
spinal (two digits), bay (four types), and turret (four types).  Theese
new groups would replace the existing five-place offensive weapon group
in the USP.  The defensive weapons don\'t need breaking out like this,
because they can only be installed in one type of mount (sandcasters only
come in turret installations, repulsors are so large they must be mounted
in bays; and all the rest are internal).  In the examples below, I\'ve also
added the sensor/EW group that was proposed recently.


Old USP Examples:

BC-9514 Kinunir  BC-A2447G2-000510-50202-0  MCr1336.63  1250 Tons
batteries bearing                  2 2 2
        batteries                  2 2 2

BB-7241 Tigress  BB-V5368J4-F97909-967T9-W  MCr362721  500 kTons
batteries bearing            5   B 5R51Y
        batteries            A   N AXA1Z


NEW USP Examples:

BC-9514 Kinunir  BC-A2447G2-000510-00-0000-5022-0-7741  MCr1336.63  1250 Tons
batteries bearing                          2 22
        batteries                          2 22

BB-7241 Tigress  BB-V5368J4-F97909-0T-0009-9670-W-7741  Mcr362721  500 kTons
batteries bearing            5   B  1    Y 5R5
        batteries            A   N  1    Z AXA


Here\'s the complete breakdown of the new USP format:
XX-@@@@  Example  XX-1234567-89ABCD-EF-GHIJ-KLMN-O-PQRS  MCr$$$$$$  ### Tons

Ship Identification:
XX = Ship Type code
@@@@ = Ship Number
Example = Ship Name

General Information:
1 = Tonnage code
2 = Comfiguration code
3 = Jump Number
4 = Maneuver G\'s
5 = Power Plant rating (is this still needed?)
6 = Computer Code (or computer DM, perhaps?)
7 = Crew code

Defense:
8 = Hull Armor factor
9 = Sandcaster Turret factor
A = Meson Screen factor
B = Nuclear Damper factor
C = Force Field (black globe) factor
D = Repulsor Bay factor

Spinal Weapons:
E = Spinal Particle Accellerator factor
F = Spinal Meson Gun factor

Bay Weapons:
G = Energy Weapon Bay (plasma and fusion gun, if still used) factor
H = Particle Accelerator Bay factor
I = Meson Gun Bay factor
J = Missile Bay factor

Turret Weapons:
K = Laser Turret Battery factor
L = Energy Weapon Turret Battery factor
M = Particle Accelerator Barbette factor
N = Missile Turret Battery factor

Fighters:
O = Number of fighter squadrons

Electronic Warfare:
P = Active Sensor factor
Q = Passive Sensor factor
R = Active Jammer (ECM) factor
S = Stealth and EMM factor

Additional Information:
$$$$$$ = Cost in MegaCredits (to six significant figures)
### = Exact tonnage, in displacement tons.


Despite the complexity of decoding the USP (I drew up special ship control
sheets that helped immensely in my own games), I think it\'s important to
have a compact format for representing everything important about a ship.
The longer descriptions, particularly those used in MegaTraveller, always
seemed cumbersome when attempting to compare ship designs.

I heartily second this!  In the MT days I greatly preferred the Digest
Group supplements to the GDW ones.  Traveller\'s Digest published many non-
military adventures, and Digest Group published supplements like Rats &
Cats while GDW was busy publishing Fighting Ships of the Shattered
Imperium and COACC. 

I am excited about the Year 0 era.  I dearly hope that the focus will be
on exploration and recontact and trade, rather than conquest.

Your design sequence isnt half bad.  FF&S could be useful.  It comes down to this:

   Don\'t make me have to use a calculator.  

If I can\'t to the math quickly in my head, it isn\'t useful.  A prime example is 
Cargo is listed in tons, but you have to convert it to cubic meters to see if it 
will fit in your cargo bay.  Before: 150 Ton cargo hold = 150 tons cargo.  Its 
easy.  Now I have to take 150 Tons multiply it by some constant that isn\'t in my
head (takes time to look up) and then I have to compare at this point two 
numbers with some fractional value to another.  This complexity for reality sake
was a mistake.  It took away from playability.

Try to avoid fractions and numbers that are difficult to work with.  Instead
of a jump drive taking 19.8 "tons" of space, and costing 27.3 Mcr (numbers made up a random), have it use 20 tons of space and cost 27 Mcr.  Heck of a lot easier to deal with.

That\'s why I hate FF&S (other than you can\'t follow from one step to another easily).  Give me tables with whole numbers and don\'t make me do anything more complex that Multiply.  I am not adversed to math.  But when I am refing, I don\'t want to deal with math.

    'body' => 'Greetings All;

It seems that I have been swayed by the myriad of discussions here on the
Traveller and the XBoat mailing lists. I\'m willing to give FF&S Light a
try. Dave Golden (goldendj@mail.usa.net) has volunteered to coordinate the
design of this system. Please email comments and suggestions to him.

FF&S (and Light) will need a method of creating a USP however. The basic
combat system will still be High Guard-like. The changes will probably
include two more range bands (a la Battle Rider - short, medium, long,
extreme). In fact, Battle Rider could be used as a semi-basis for this
method. See what you come up with. Also, the design of starships using FF&S
Light should take from 15 minutes to 30 minutes to complete. No more.

I\'ve given Dave until Friday to come up with a working model of the FF&S
Light system, including the USP generation sub-system. If I accept the
system, then this is what will happen:

        The Main Book will contain some stock ship designs, their USP\'s,
        and the Modified High Guard combat system.

        The Starships book will contain more stock ship designs, their deck
        plans, their USP\'s, the FF&S Light building system, and some other
        stuff.

        Later, we\'ll publish FF&S (updated) again under a new name.

This would mean that FF&S is the system for developing starships. You can
still use it. FF&S Light will be used by new players, and those not
interested in the level of detail from FF&S. Tech levels for jump drives,
et al, are as per FF&S. Ignore what I said earlier.

BTW, fusion is a little strange around year 0. The fusion from FF&S is what
we call "Fusion Plus". Before year 0, no one had Fusion Plus, only fusion.
What this means for ships over 100 tons is - nothing. However, the power
plant necessary for a 100 ton ship is as small as it could get.
Effectively, there were no starships of less than 100 tons. Then came the
Empire, and they invented Fusion Plus. Now they can build a 10 ton fighter,
a 50 ton modular cutter, a ship\'s boat, etc. Other people can only build
100 ton shuttles or the like. Now you can see why so many people wanted to
join the Empire back in Milieu 0.

For those of you who expressed an interest in designing ships for me,
please hold off until Friday to see what the design system will look like.
You could, however, use FF&S to design the ships, if you like. I\'m looking
for TL11 ships for Civilian service and TL12 ships for government/military
service. I\'d prefer to have deck plans in some .eps style format, if
possible. Use 2 meters per square, if you will. The plans must fit on an 8"
by 10" page (or, for large ships, two pages.)

Thank you for your support and encouragement. Let\'s get to work!

Just a quick question:  Which should we use for maneuver drives,
thruster plates or HEPLaR drives?

Hi Tom: 

Part of the beauty of the Classic Traveller books was that the Imperium was
not integrated into the rules. This means that I did not have to spend alot
of time taking it out of the rules. 

Personally I created my own universe rather than use the Imperium.

You build ships on the fly during a game to work encounters, etc?  I
always tried to have either premade ships handy (sup.7, sup.9) or I kept
a notebook of my own designs.  If I needed something I wasn\'t prepared
for, I made it up, then designed it later if the players would ever see
it again (the USP wasn\'t something I\'d give players during an encounter
unless it was a common ship in thier database----and they got close
enough to get accurate sensor data on that level of detail).  Someone
mentioned a gross encounter table... that works fine.  Who needs
detailed data for a one time encounter with a cruiser?  

Player> What do our sensors say about the ship hailing us?

Me> They are broadcasting Imperial Navy Ship ID.  They are a 50,000ton
cruiser.

Me> Hahahaha.  No.  Their launches could wreak your ship.  Standard
proceedure would be to answer the hail.

HG doesn\'t do more than multiply as an operation, and has little algerba
(EPs and agility spring to mind).

I think that the system for people who want to generate ships with no
math is simple, and is already in place----use premade ships!

For basic play, MT and FFS were too complicated.  HG was just about
right.  Again, there are a ton of premade ships, and if you\'re
interested in mAking ships I would rather see a system at least
complicated enough that I couldn\'t memorize the whole set of rules
including tables :-)

        That\'s not my understanding from Don. While the mechanics are going
to be the same, I don\'t think there\'s any intention of "altering" FF&S in
that drastic a manner. In fact, FF&S should be left virtually unchanged.

        Certainly. We want to keep the detailed FF&S units in FF&S, but we
need a way to convert an FF&S laser\'s "Rng: Pen-Dmg" to some kind of
single-digit combat factor.

        Some things definitely need tweaking, such as crew. I\'m inclined to
use the FF&S crews as "low-automation" and come up with a simple multiplier
for automation effects. But at the same time, we need to do this fast, and
with as little change to FF&S as possible.

        High Guard uses to-hit, to-penetrate, and then damage rolls (had to

        Rule of thumb, or perhaps just "Imperial Ministry of Commerce and

still going to be limited by surface area as per FF&S.

        My understanding is we\'re sticking very closely to FF&S. I
specifically asked about having multiple drive tables, but didn\'t think to
clarify whether the "standard" would remain HEPlaR or revert to thruster
plates. I\'ll ask about that.

        The one subject where FF&S is open for changes! By now you\'ve read
Don\'s message about the nature of fusion plants at TL11 ... too big for
ships much smaller than 100tons. We\'ve got to come up with some rationale,
handwaving or not, for this, so we don\'t get stuck with an arbitrary "before
TL12 thou shalt not have fusion in small craft." Anybody got any ideas about
a physics breakthrough in fusion technology that won\'t necessarily increase
the power density, but will allow smaller minimum sizes?

        FF&S Light will consist _mostly_ of tables of "standard _____s." And
since most ships will probably have an odd power requirement, chances are
good there will be multiple pplants: say you need 87MW: put in three 25MW
plants and a 15MW plant...

        Good idea ... I\'ll see if I can tweak the hull tables some more. I\'m
still not at all happy with them.

        I\'m leaning toward recommending that FF&S crew levels be taken as a
"low-automation" level, due to Virus. Pre-Collapse crews will be smaller.
Maybe just a simple fraction of the "book" levels, by TL perhaps. Suggestions?

        Well, even a custom designed system will probably be designed around
mostly standard-type parts. But if you just define repair costs as a
fraction of the original cost, then the higher original cost will drive
higher repair costs without a separate rule.

        Custom designs are coming <G>. In fact, they\'re still here.

    'body' => 'Everybody\'s seen Don Perrin\'s message by now, saying that my big mouth got
me into the hot water. I\'ve got until Friday to come up with a basic working
model of "Fire, Fusion & Steel Light." I need some serious help to do this.
During my talks with Don Perrin this morning, here\'s the guidance I got:

	1) "Fire, Fusion & Steel" (FF&S) _will be_ the detailed spacecraft design
supplement for MMT, with little change. He doesn\'t want a wholesale rewrite.
Only if something is seriously broken will it be tweaked. However! If it
does get fixed, it needs those fixes identified NOW so they are incorporated
into the "Light" version. IG will eventually reissue FF&S, and any updates
will be made available on the Net for those who already have it.

	2) Combat will be "High Guard-style," using single-digit ratings for
systems in a Universal Ship Profile, and separate to-hit/to-penetrate tables
instead of tasks. So we need to come up with a way of converting detailed
statistics into single-digit type ratings. But we\'re not rewriting FF&S to
look like HG. My understanding is that the combat rules will *not* be
straight out of "Book 5, 2nd Edition" as far as actual values, etc., just
that the mechanics themselves will be very similar. As an intermediate step,
the abstracted combat values in "Brilliant Lances" may be a good start for
generating USPs.

	4) The USP really shouldn\'t grow much bigger -- Don thinks it\'s probably
too long already. He\'s talking about coming up with some way to roll ALL the
offensive and defensive systems into a single factor each, i.e. Attack 7,
Defend 5. Just for the basic rules, folks, calm down. Something like
"Brilliant Lances" (and probably "Brilliant Lances") is also being planned,
and they\'ll use mechanics much like the existing ones, in all their glorious
detail. But a quick firefight in the middle of a roleplaying session
shouldn\'t break the momentum.

	5) Fusion power plants are one thing that needs fixing in FF&S. One of the
"hooks" in the Milieu 0 setting is the idea of "Fusion Plus." Ok, it\'s not a
very catchy phrase, but here\'s the basic idea. The commonly available fusion
plants are big. You really can\'t build them small enough for a fighter, for
example. The Imperium, with a common TL of 11 but a military TL of 12 has
had a technology breakthrough which allows them to build much smaller plants
that can fit into fighters (or other small craft). The new plants don\'t
produce more power per unit mass; you can just build them smaller. One of
the reasons many "pocket empires" are willing to join the Imperium is this
technology. 
	So we need to tweak the fusion plant rules enough that it\'s not practical
to put them into ships much smaller than 100tons prior to TL12. I repeat,
they\'re not necessarily more efficient, they can just be made smaller after
TL12. I _seriously_ need some inputs on this one, folks.

	6) The variety in armor materials, maneuver drives, etc. will be kept.
However, the basic design rules need to be structured to make design as much
as possible a "Pick a system, deduct its volume from the running total, add
its price, mass and power requirements to the total, and press on."

	7) "Basic Working Model" means all tables basically complete. Prose to make
it look good can be added later, as long as the system is testable now.

	8) If possible, don\'t pester Don about spacecraft design, he\'s probably
busy with the combat rules. I get all the hate mail now.

	9) I\'ll follow discussions on all three lists (Beta, Traveller and XBoat)
as soon as I get resubscribed to the XBoat. If you sent a message on XBoat
before receiving this, I didn\'t get it. I\'ll probably get three or four
copies of every message as people echo them to all the lists, but it\'s
easier and quicker than asking everybody to join just one of the lists for
the discussion. I need everybody\'s ideas.

	10) I\'ll keep copies of work-in-progress on my Web site at 

		http://www.usa.net/~goldendj/Traveller/Admiralty/FFSLight/FFSLight.html

	What\'s there right now isn\'t yet the latest version, as I\'m in the middle
of changes, but I\'ll get it up soon.


SUMMARY: We\'re _not_ designing a new system, nor doing wholesale surgery on
FF&S. We\'re taking the existing rules and coming up with a simplified system
for quick & dirty designs. And we\'re doing it fast, so there\'s not much time
to squabble. My basic plan of attack is to convert all the FF&S rules to a
set of tables from which you can pick items. But I need input from
everybody, especially those who\'re most interested in a basic system.

        That\'s the goal: create "HG-style" USPs, not a High Guard version of
FF&S. The design system will remain FF&S -- all Light is is a set of
pregenerated FF&S systems.

        Small ships ... I was only planning on going up to about 5,000Td.
Most customers for bigger ships are going to be governments or megacorps
with detailed specs and more money. Plus, most shipyards aren\'t going to
have "standard" equipment big enough for the rare big ship.

        Well, Don seemed very firm about not changing FF&S. He did agree
that we can tweak it somewhat if absolutely needed, but no major revisions.

Possibly.  But consider how repairs work.  (Details thanks to an aviation
tech I know.)

Airplane lands with problems: that radar isn\'t working properly.

Tech pulls the three modules most likely to be broken and tests system.  If
it doesn\'t work, she repeats it with the next three modules.  Eventually it
works.

All pulled modules are sent back to the factory for reconditioning.  (Even
the ones that were ok go back - less chance of a human error, and they may
have been damaged by being pulled.)

The tech doesn\'t attempt to repair the broken module.  Too much time,
requires equipment sho doesn\'t have, parts she doesn\'t have, and probably
requires knowledge she doesn\'t have.  besides, it would void the warranty.


This is what I see starport repairs as like.  Thus, opening up the standard
module to repair/tweak it is a possibility, but the players will have to do
it themselves, or hunt for a good (and expensive) technician.


If you want more justification, keep in mind that the actual construction of
each standard module is protected by patents (and possibly black epoxy and
anti-tampering devices, depending on how paranoid the manufacturer is :-) ). 
An LSP avionics package meets the same specs as a General Products one, but
its interior circuitry will be different.  (Rather like chips nowadays: same
specs, different masks.)

Before we go off and cause problems for Imperial Games in our haste to
shoehorn FF&S into something that might use I make the following points.

1. Where does Greg Porter\'s equipment guide(which is to include personal
weapons) figure into this? From messages that he has posted, the tech will
have a "Mr Fusion" type power for personal equipment and weapons. Any of you
that have used his "Guns, Guns, Guns" and "More Guns" know that weapons
designed with G^3 are 180 degrees out of phase with FF&S. If we do not get
some input from Greg we may have a Starship design and personal
weapons/equipment that are not seamless in their design and effects. Ie
starships using FF&S for starship weapons/equipment and personal
equipment(Read vehicles)/weapons using what Greg Porters equipment guide

Check.

About the only thing I can think of in regard to FF&S fixes that are
critical at this stage of the game are:
1) The "laser limit" rule, which I feel should be added.
2) A decision needs to be made with respect to the maneuver technology
   used.  HEPlaR (and it\'s fuel usage) will require the current J-Drive
   fuel consumption.  A return to thruster plates should probably be 
   accompanied by a return to larger quantities of jump fuel.  This
   is a philosophical decision, and may need to be made by Marc.
3) Alternative (smaller) crew rules for civilian ships.

OK, this is something we can work with.  Basically, then, the single-digit
"factor" needs to combine chance to-hit, chance to penetrate, and damage
done.  I\'d suggest a system based on the expected value [*] of the damage
against a standardized target - perhaps something that delivers an expected
value of 1 major hit (nominal damage value of 40) should be USP 1.

The system can then scale exponentially (much like the original High Guard
system - a single laser was USP 1, but battery of 30 was USP 8).  As a
starting point, here\'s a suggestion:

USP = 1 + 2.1 * ln(Nweap * Deach / 40)
	where ln is the natural logarithm,
	      Nweap is the number of weapons in the battery,
	  and Deach is the damage value per weapon.
Increase the USP factor by one for batteries which have a Master Fire
Director dedicated to them.  Multipurpose MFDs can be  subsumed into the
computer/electronics USP.

For FF&S Lite users, a table could be provided listing USP factor and the
number of weapons required for a battery of the given factor (much like
High Guard, again).

[*] Note: this is a prob/stat term which means the number of the hits times
    the probability that they will occur.  For example, a system which does
    4 "hits" damage, but has a 50% "to-hit" roll and a 50% "penetrate" roll
    against our standardized target has an expected value of 1.

Well, you all know my feelings on that subject.

This might be a little _over_ simple, IMHO.  Perhaps a better idea might be
to make the USP an optional thing (much like it was in Classic Traveller;
USPs only came along with High Guard).  In the basic game, if you include
only lasers, missiles, and sandcaster turrets (again, much like Classic
Traveller) things become much simpler.  The USP can be presented along with
either the boardgame system or the detailed design system (or both).

Well, we\'ve already got a mechanic for this in FF&S, it just seems to me
that the values need changing slightly.  The (current) FF&S power plant
table looks like this.  I\'ve added a second column; this replaces the old
minimum volume and is the only change we need to make (the last column,
labelled "Std" is the same volume, expressed in displacement tons).

				Smallest Plant (in m3)
	TL Plant	MW/m3	FF&S		T4	(Std)
	 6 Fission	0.30	 30		  30	 2.1
	 7 Fission	0.60	 20		  20	 1.4
	 8 Fission	1.0	 10		  10	 0.7
	 9 Fusion	2.0	100		1000	71.4
	10 Fusion	2.0	 50		 500	35.7
	11 Fusion	2.0	 20		 100	 7.1
	12 Fusion	2.0	 10		  20	 1.4
	13 Fusion	3.0	  1		  10	 0.7
	14 Fusion	3.0	  0.25		   1
	15 Fusion	6.0	  0.1		   0.1
	16 Fusion	7.0	  0.075		   0.05

With the above table, you can see how fusion plants progress from large
installations (at TL-9, they would be ground based, or installed into
starships of several hundred displacement tons or more).  The TL-10 plant
isn\'t very useful for small ships, either (though you could try building a
75-ton craft around it), while at TL-11 things are looking marginally useful
for small craft above about 30 tons.

As I understand the Milleu 0, the Imperium will be at TL-11 to -12, while
most of it\'s competition will be at TL-9 or TL-10.  This is a significant
advantage for the Imperium, and also shows a distinct development curve
for power plants, as the gravitic and damper technology is mastered from
TL-11 through TL-13.

How\'s that for a starting point?

Sounds good ... though I think the system you\'ve got posted on your Web site
has a way to go before it is really this simple.

I know what you mean.  At the design\'s highest level I\'d like to just
plug parts together period. Virtually no math.

I know what you mean.  Maybe we should round everything off to the
NEXT highest ton for the simple system.  That would mean wasted space
in a ship design (as if *that* doesn\'t happen <g>), but it could be
explained as the misc overhead of fitting the pieces together.  At
higher design levels you could *optimize* designs and remove wasted
space.  It\'s a time/money/space tradeoff.

My vision of the simple system is more simple than David\'s FF&S Lite.
I\'d present complete systems to just plug together.  

I see 4 levels of complexity

Level 1:   Completely pre-generated Ships

Level 2:  Pre-generated systems you just plug together.

Start with a worksheet with eight short sections.

1.  Pick a hull from a list of the size, armor and config you want. 
The hull comes complete with integral grav control, and all the
piping, wiring, etc needed for everything else.  This also gives you
the available volume..no math required.

2.  Plug in the Jump drive and Jump Fuel volume from a list and
subtract vol from vol still available.  At worst you\'d have to
multiply the fuel needed for one jump by some small number.

3.  Plug in the Maneuver drive from a list and subtract vol from vol
still available.

4.  Pick a Bridge Package from a table and subtract it\'s vol from the
vol available.  The Packages would be very high level including
sensors, electronics, control, communications, security, computer, and
flight controls.

5.  Pick 0 to n weapon systems from tables and subtract from available
volume.

6.  Add accomidations from a table:  so many low berths, small cabins,
large cabins, commons etc. and subtract from vol.

7.  Pick an Engineering Package from a table and plug it in.

8.  Plug in a Power Package exceeding the total of power required by
the other 7 subsystems.

Level 3:  Pre-generated subsystems that you plug together to make
complete systems, ie. create a hull, create a custom Bridge from lists
of pre-gened sensors, computers, commo gear etc.  (This is FF&S Lite I
think.)

Level 4:  Create the subsystem parts themselves, ie. design a custom
sensor system from the physics.  (This is FF&S!)

If I were IG, <g> I\'d put Level 1 and 2 in the basic rules. I\'d
include Level 3 with lots of ships, and ship systems in _Starships_,
and put Level 4 in an updated FF&S...which I\'d rename something like
TRAVELLER TECHNICAL DESIGN MANUAL.

Space.  You can print a 40+ character UPx on a single line of a
magazine or manual.  I\'m sure that\'s why they are so insistant on
continuing with the UPx\'s.  

Don\'t get me wrong, though, I\'d *like* to have the info in a form more
useful than the UPx format.  Can you come up with one?

Just a few comments:

1)  I think (hope) FF&S Light will be like your system, making it three 
levels.  David?

2)  Yes, IG, /please/ include a very basic, very high level design system 
in the basic rules (if FF&S Light fits that bill, include it; if not, use 
a system such as Eris just outlined).  

3)  Also, please DO rename Fire, Fusion, and Steel to something a little 
less....pop cultureish.  Technical Design Manual would be fine.  Starship 
Engineer\'s Handbook would work, too.  Something like that.

Quite contrary, my dear watson!
In fact starports are NOT local affairs. They are even more than 
airports today, considered to be territory not belonging to the 
planet (country), but to the Imperium. The town which lies next to 
the port however is planetary territory. So the weapons restrictions 
of the planet do not apply to the starport (though it may have it\'s 
own, and once on the starport, the local police can\'t directly get to 
you (although you might be extradited).

This is how i always understood the status of starports! Correct me 
if i\'m wrong!

The one thing I *wouldn\'t* like to see is TNE messages.  I\'ll admit up 
front to a strong personal bias against TNE (for a variety of reasons), 
but I really feel that TNE material is likely to have less 
cross-relevance than material for any of the other variants.  Not only is 
there a different game system, the basis of the technology has changed, 
and there is a very different feel.

If people want to play TNE, that\'s their business, and I hope that they 
aren\'t left unsupported the way I was, because that sucked.  But:

I have no interest in TNE, and no desire to see anything about it.  I\'d 
have to say that I would not be a member of any mailing list that included 
TNE stuff, and I doubt I am alone.

My point being is why should Greg fix something that he did not have any

Actually, the problem comes during play not from designing ships on the
fly, but: 

  REF> Ok, the pirate corsair just took out your Jump Drives, you limp
       back to the space port.

  Player> How much is this going to cost me?

  REF(CT book2)> [flips to the chart] Hmm, J-2, thats 20Mcr to replace.
  REF(CT book5)> [flips to the chart] Hmm, thats 4.0 * 3% of 200.  Give 
                 me a sec...  [plays with a calulator for 10 seconds] Thats
                 24Mcr.
  REF(TNE)>      [flips to the chart, doesnt find one], Ummm, I dunno.
  REF(FF&S)>     [flips to the chart, gets tied up reading text] Oh here it
                 is.  Your J-2 drive uses 3% of your 200 T ship  But I have
                 to get tons in to Cubic Meters first.  Lets see thats 2800 m3
                 so 2800 * 0.03 Cubic Meters (goes to the calculator).  Ok we
                 need 84 m3 of drive space * 0.3 MCr, well that 25.2 MCR.
  REF(MT)>       [Flips to the chart] Hmm, J2, 200T, thats 6 jump units
                 at 3Mcr each. 18Mcr.

[Real times for me to actually resolve this problem]
CT Book 2:   10 seconds (ok so I used the Traveller Book, not CT book 2)
CT Book 5:   30 seconds
MT:          20 seconds
TNE:         N/A
TNE/FF&S:    3 minutes (looking like a fool to the players)

So hopefully this is will show you my complaint with FF&S.  Which at least
FF&S has 1Ton = 14 Cubic Meters, where MT had 1 Ton = 13.5 Kiloliters.

CT Book 2 was easy to ref and do on the fly ship changes, but thats not
all of it.  I build ships away from the game, but when it takes a long time
to build a ship as it does with FF&S.  Even HG takes a fair amount of time.
MT and CT systems allowed ships to be created quickly, so I can spend the
few hours a week I have to prepare my sessions on things like NPC\'s and
"Dungeon Dressing" so to speak.  I could care less how may cubic meters
of space the computer takes up, but rather let the players know that it
has a voice interface and 3D holo-projection video display.

FF&S Light may have some potential.  Hopefully Don will consider the 
"Gaming" aspect of ship creation.  Its easy to get lost in the system
and work on getting ships designed in a cohesive fashion, but if the out
come doesn\'t make the core game, the role playing game, any better, then
it doesn\'t benifit the gamer.

I don\'t know what you mean by compact.  Yes it shouldn\'t take the
whole page to give a ships stats, but they don\'t need to be
forced into a 1/2 line of text either.  Taking a few extra
lines to present them in a readable format (that doesn\'t require
refering to some table, possbily in another book, and counting
character positions) is not going to hard to do.

Even for shorted universal profiles (like for charactes) I don\'t
see any reason for gobbly-gook.  Shorters ones are easier to
read, but the alternative of a more readable format is also easier.

If Imperial games wants to give a universal profile at the top
for diehards, I have no reason to object, but I recomments that
they don\'t rely on universal profiles to present info.

I see your point, but I usually had the full notes on player ships handy
for such stuff.  If I didn\'t, I\'d take the time needed----it takes my car
mechanic all day to cost out something----or at least 3minutes for a real
guess (then I get the real phone call later and feint:-).

Even before T4 we were working on FFS Light for just that reason.

Suplement 9 is readable----1 8.5x5.5inch page per ship with picture, so 2
ships per blackbook page.  That\'s 4 per page in the new format (they say
8.5x11).  Maybe they could squeeze in 5.  USPs seem to average about
9-10 per page in blackbooks, so that\'d be 18-20 in the new format (even
with 4 trailing spots for sensor stuff).

The Starship book and the Small Craft book will have expanded info as
well as deck plans from what Don said.  Keeping USPs just makes the
option of packing in less developed designs into a smaller space
easier.  Or if they gave a page per JTAS to a new ship, would you rather
see expanded technical info, or historical notes about the names,
battles, mysteries of the new class?  I\'d rather get a USP and a ton of
non-technical info, myself.

No!  Thank you for listening and at least giving us a chance to help.  I
think that we are all agreed in that we want T4 to succeed.  I for one am
excited that you guys are listening to us.

I not only never liked \'em, I never used \'em :-)  I always thought of
them as blowtorches.

According to Dave Golden, T4 will have thrusterplates, but we are
working on drop-in reaction drives as well.  Even if T-plates are gonna
be the canon for the Imperium, having a couple other types will add
flavor.  We\'ll have to provide the info, and see what Don does with it.

        Would you use Discharge Energy, or try to do it using the actual
penetration/damage values? That gives us a direct tie between the armor and
the weapon ratings. However we scale the weapons, we have to make sure they
still get through the same armor. Maybe some kind of logarithmic scale:

        Pen/Armor       USP
           0-1           0
           2-4           1
           5-12          2
           13-33         3
           34-90         4
           90-244        5
           245-665       6
              etc.

        Obviously I\'m using natural logs here, but this is just an example.
How does BR scale BL weapons & armor? I need to dig up the rules and check.

        I believe Don wants to add some sensor info to the USP, which is why
he\'s reluctant to go even further than that -- he thinks it\'s already
bloated. I wanted to break out a variable number of digits for each weapon
type, since HG assumed all lasers were identical and that\'s not true. You
also can\'t have particle bays if you\'ve got a particle spinal, for example.
I saw it something like this

        xxxxxxx-842-xxxxxxxx
                26A

meaning 2 weapons (say, lasers) of factor 8, 6 more lasers of factor 4, and
10 of factor 2.

        Sounds reasonable. Now we just need to figure out the specific
factors. I\'ll give a swing at it tomorrow. The basic idea is that a
"reasonable" small craft reactor is too big for the small craft.

        As I recall, MMT will have the combat rules and some predesigned

Finally, FF&S 2 will follow.

        Don was pretty clear about not wanting to change FF&S -- I had to
convince him that a few tweaks would be worth the effort. Do we really want
to try to swing something this major while trying to get the whole thing
done by Friday?

        I think our best bet is to concentrate on first getting FF&S Light
rules written to convince him it\'s workable, and when we turn them in try to
convince him we need to go back and fix FF&S. At that point, since most of
the work on USP conversion and etc. will have been done, updates to FF&S
shouldn\'t be too difficult to flow into FF&S Light -- just a matter of
changing tables.

        We really need to knock the rules out quick.

        Already being addressed, although specifics are still in flux (i.e.
formless). Basically, I\'d like to assume that the FF&S crew rules are for
post-Virus paranoid minimally-automated ships. The basic crew factor for
each system will be its straight FF&S crew requirement, and then we\'ll
multiply by a fraction (dependent on TL?) to come up with crews for more
automated systems

        Hmm ... sounds like a start. I was thinking of using the same
scaling for weapons and armor factors ... after the conversion a weapon
should still be as effective against the same converted armor.

Explanation of columns:
USP = USP hull size factor (as per High Guard).
Config = (new) USP configuration factor.  No relation to any prior config USP.
MaxG = The maximum maneuver G\'s the hull is rated for
Armor = (new) USP hull armor factor, based on new FF&S USP calculation.
StdTons = The familiar Standard Displacement Tons of the hull.
Volume = Remaining (usable) volume inside the hull.
Power = Power in MW required to run this hull (mainly for Grav/G-Comp system).
Cost = Cost of hull (and associated equipment) in MCr.
Surface = Usable surface area on the hull in m2.

All of the hulls were built with (I hope) standard FF&S rules.  Included
in every hull is also Basic and Extended life support, one airlock per
100 displacement tons (up to a maximum of ten), one large cargo hatch per
200 displacement tons (up to a maximum of four), and a few small cargo
hatches.  The hulls also have artificial gravity and g-compensation
installed, and are built at TL-10.  Note that (as long as TL-10 materials
are used), the capacity of the G-compensation system increases with TL, but
the hull statistics remain otherwise the same.

Oh ... a word of explanation is in order about the hull configuration
USP codes.  They\'re basically the same configurations that are possible
with FF&S, except that I gave them each a USP code letter.  The codes
are arranged as follows (with no attempt at being compatible with any
other edition of Traveller and it\'s USP configuration codes).

USP	Form
0	Open Frame
1	Needle
2	Needle Streamlined
3	Needle Airframe
4	Wedge
5	Wedge Streamlined
6	Wedge Airframe
7	Cylinder
8	Cylinder Streamlined
9	Cylinder Airframe
A	Box
B	Box Streamlined
C	Sphere
D	Sphere Streamlined
E	Disk
F	Disk Streamlined
G	Disk Airframe
H	Close Structure
J	Slab
K	Slab Streamlined
L	Slab Airframe

That\'s enough for tonight; I\'ve got to go to work tomorrow, and it\'s late.
Hopefully soon, I\'ll be able to do some more systems.

        Convinced me. From here on out, I\'ll try to address FF&S Light
questions & comments straight to the GDW-Beta list, although for the next
day or so, as stuff trickles in, I\'ll make sure I reply to the source list
as well. That way, people who don\'t care won\'t be bombarded with all this
stuff, and those who do won\'t have to look at it three times ...

I know that a lot of die hards have gotten emotionally attached
to the method but I it\'s a barrier to new players.  If you are
interested in selling it to more than just players who have used
the game so long that they have memorized all the profiles formats
and can read them off without even counting columns, then I
suggest Imperial Games drop them.  For anyone who hasn\'t invested
a lot of time in learning and using Traveller, they are a bad
idea.

A ships stats could easily be presented in a short paragraph while
greatly increasing readability.  Other info would
be even shorter.  If you look at the space devoted to present
stats, it is never very much (descriptions take up most of the
space in any game).  Unless you have spent years using them,
universal profiles are very diffucult to use.

There is a reason nobody else has ever adopted this approach.  It
makes things a lot harder to read and results in limited savings
in space.

>Don\'t get me wrong, though, I\'d *like* to have the info in a form more
>useful than the UPx format.  Can you come up with one?

The a scores of games out there that present similar info and
don\'t have to use such tatics.  One simple change is to put
short abbreviations in front of numbers to indicate what
they are (heck you could even leave groups of numbers that
represent the same thing as a "bunch").

They work well for people that have trained themselves to use
them quickly.  But most gamers don\'t want to have to invest that
kind of time just to use one game.  If you want to appeal to
more than hard core Traveller players, I would recommend against
them.  (You could stick them at the top, in addition to other info,
but don\'t make the primary way of presenting info.)

With consistent formating and a set of well defined abbreviations the
same info could be presented in just a few more lines.  We aren\'t talking
about loosing a "ton" on non-technical info.  The savings in space
just aren\'t _that_ dramatic.

I guess, in the end, Imperial Games is going to have to decide if they
want give things in a way that is a bit better for long time players
while risking turning off new players who might be interested in the
game.

Note: even if you don\'t use thruster plates doesn\'t mean you have
to have reaction drives.  There is no reason a reactionless thruster
couldn\'t push in one direction and happen to throw exhast out, as
a by product, in the same direction it\'s thrusting in.

Yeah, but I don\'t use reaction drives OR thruster plates! :->

Non-Imperium cultures may well be using reaction drives.

I just about had a cow when I found out that the TNE rules didn\'t have
*any* ship build/repair rules.

>REF(FF&S)
>[flips to the chart, gets tied up reading text] Oh here it is.
Your J-2 drive uses 3% of your 200 T ship But I have to get tons in to
Cubic Meters first.  Lets see thats 2800 m3 so 2800 * 0.03 Cubic
Meters (goes to the calculator).  Ok we need 84 m3 of drive space *
0.3 MCr, well that 25.2 MCR.

Sad, but true!

>REF(MT)
>[Flips to the chart] Hmm, J2, 200T, thats 6 jump units at 3Mcr
>each.  18Mcr. 

..but is that the right answer. With MT I was never sure.

Tell you how I handle that, how I handled it from CT on up in fact.  I
mentioned earlier that I transfer data from UP\'s to my own forms.  On
my form the price of the Jump Drive would be sitting right there on
the form!  And right next to it is the MW\'s (or Power Points or
whatever) it puts out.  And next to that is a entry for it\'s current
condition.

"How much is this gonna cost me?"

I look at my form..."About 20MC, if the yard has one of the right size
on hand.  You might want to have Jill (the Engineer) check it out and
see if it\'s either repairable or at least
salvageable." 

Time?  3 seconds and *no* effect on game flow.

A ship\'s USP has always been raw data to me..not all that useful until
I expand it and put it into a better format.  I don\'t propose ditching
the USP, they\'re nice and compact, but I don\'t suggest anybody use
them raw...cook \'em first.  <G>

>So hopefully this is will show you my complaint with FF&S.  Which at
>least FF&S has 1Ton = 14 Cubic Meters, where MT had 1 Ton = 13.5
>Kiloliters.

I use 14 for rough approximations, but 13.5 is really closer to
correct.  One ton is 2 squares.  Each square is 1.5x1.5x3..and for we
parochial Americans that\'s 5feetx5feetx10feet per square. It was
always neat, clean and easy..that\'s one reason I like Traveller the
scale was right.

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!

Don announced in a recent message that deck plans will be based on 2m
squares.  That\'s actually a pretty big change from the past.

Nobody has complained, but I\'m going to HATE Don changing from a 1.5m
square to 2m.  Two meters might be a terrible scale to convert to
tons.  Let\'s think about it!

The best way probably will be 1 square = 1 ton.  Do it like this: each
square is 2m x 2m x 3.5m = 14, and 14 is the TNE (and FF&S) ton. 
Oooh!  Maybe it\'ll work....it means no easy 1/2 ton spaces on the deck
plans though. ;-<

The only problems with the change will rationalizing 3.5m head spaces
(I guess we could go with 2.5m ceilings and a 1 meter crawl space
above that for piping, wiring, grav plates, etc.), and converting all
the old designs that had 1.5m squares to the new scale.

Therefore, design decisions must be made to get in new people (as well as

Second, Traveller has the opportunity to establish itself as the third leg of

properly, we can bring Traveller into a much wider arena and that thought has
a very high priority.

Third, production values must be top-notch. No 300 DPI outputs, no cheap art,
no poor layouts, no typos.

We want to start from that foundation and build the best sf game system ever.

This sounds OK, but I am wondering if this meas that T4 is abandoning
Thruster plates and using those annoying HEPLaR drive.  I sincerely hope
this is not so.  HEPLaR was one of the major things (after the Virus and
the mechanics) which made me truly dislike TNE.  Traveller just doesn\'t
feel like Traveller w/o Thruster plates.

I suggest the following things: 

1. Put alot of emphasis on roleplaying and campaign management rather than 
far future engineering. 

2. Include more information on construction of one\'s own universe rather
than forcing players to use the Imperium. 

3. In the world generation system, include some ways to determine whether
or not sentient life exists, and allow in the rules a tech level high
enuf for jump drives without necessitating the influence of the Imperium or
some other outside government. 

4. The old trade system required more dice rolling than roll playing, please
update this with role playing involved.

I think that Traveller over the net is as viable as any game.
I have been with a few upstart play by mails that ran for a couple
of weeks and then died off.  The Play By Mail is a bit difficult
as interaction is limited.  Using IRC or some other forum is more
likely to work.  At MPG-Net, we have had two ongoing AD&D games that
take place in our chat rooms.  Its $2 an hour to play that way.  IRC
is too unstable to be reliable.  I am working on an online Traveller
campaign.  As soon as I get some clearance on some usage things, I 
plan to post it and open it up for play.

I use the web for distributing maps, library data, and such, and use
MPG-Nets online facilities to actually play.  I will announce that here
when I am ready.

How about this for a suggestion.

How about a blank form that would allow you to plug the string of 
numbers into it.  say down a left hand column...
Then you could use the rest of that row to explain what the 
particular digit meant.

I can\'t find the original post on this one, so I\'ll respond here.

This would be a bad idea as a sole option.  Let\'s face it, all things 
being equal, a little 200 ton tramp freighter (Free Trader), should 
probably be close to a 1 man ship by TL 15...

I actually liked the MT model the best.  You can automate as much or 
little of the crew functions as possible.  Essentially, except at the 
lowest tech levels, you can use the computer to do a lot of work that 
crew members would ordinarily do, but at a cost.  Or if you want to 
hold down the construction cost, put in less automation, and hire 
more crewmembers.  Let\'s face it.  Office and factory automation is 
already removing/has already removed the need for a lot of jobs that 
used to be done by people, and this is at TL8.

Hell, by TL15, ships of several hundred tons could conceivably be 1 man 
vehicles.   Of course, heaven help the 1 man if they don\'t know how to 
maintain the drives, guns, screens, computer, etc...which is the real 
reason for the need for additional crew members...

Now _this_ is the way to make a basic design system out of a complicated
one!  I did exactly this with the MT craft design rules for my players: 
pre-designed packages of components so you could just pick options off a
menu to build a ship.  It worked great for civilian and OK for
para-military ships.

I appreciate they can be hard to read - I still struggle with

lot of information concisely.

I\'m not suggesting that they should always be used alone,
although when you have a sector\'s planet\'s stats to print out

I have to confess to one of my first fascinations with
Traveller being the way you could summarize a world in just 8

I would like to know if Don Perrin and Greg Porter have discussed issues
concerning the use of FF&S Lite in the design of starships for MMT. If Greg
does not know what Don is planning and vice versa, then we will have a two
different systems one for starships and another for vehicles/personal
weapons. What that will mean to the referee and players is this:

Player: I firing my Gavit Fairfax 50, on full burn at the hatch to breech
the lock.

Referee: Hmm taking the "fifties" DV converting to Dam/pen, throwing salt
over left shoulder, running the Pentium 166 to factor in variables, looking
up four different tables in two different books and seven pages, takes four
asprin, swallows with a pint of bitter, finally decides on flipping a coin,
"heads it breeches, tails the gun blows up".

I for one WILL not buy a game system that one has to go thru anything like
the above. I have not seen any input from Greg Porter concerning starship
design using FF&S Lite. Despite what some people think the starship and
vehicle/personal weapons systems have to in sync. I also do not believe in
"Let Greg Fix that issue/problem that FF&S has" attitude in order to get
FF&S lite into the Don\'s deadline. 

I want a QUALITY product if it is late so be it. If it is going to a half
baked, mu-quark nightmare, fix it later product, I will not be a buyer.

IMHO FF&S and FF&S Lite have too many issues/problems that HAVE to
addressed/deal with before either can be considered into the MMT/T4 design
sequence. I do not believe that the issues/problems can be adequately
resolved before the Don deadline. People have stated that the crew size has
been resolved, but no one has posted it to the list lately for the rest of
the list(s). The starship design system and the vehicles/personal weapons
design system HAVE to be as seamless as possible.

Does anyone have Greg Porter\'s email address, and would you post it. I will
ensure that the last week\'s messages concerning FF&S lite starship design
will get to him.

I don\'t know if that\'s true, but I heartily agree with the sentiment.
The "advanced" military character generation schemes of CT were one
of its greatest flaws (e.g., almost every convention game I\'d ever
seen involved a military mission--when I ran a non-military one at a
convention, a dozen new players decided to switch to Traveller).

Unfortunately, there are a number of competing interests in even the
existing Traveller players:

A. "generic" SF gaming
B. having a background with a great deal of history
C. prepackaged adventures/hooks/etc.
D. designing stuff (ships/planets/weapons/etc.) in detail
E. designing stuff quickly
F. detailed lists of equipment/ships/planets to choose from
G. solo gaming activities--see (D) & (E)
H. role-playing
I. roll-playing (i.e., wargaming)

(A), (H), and to some extent (I) need to be addressed by a core set
of minimalist rules including a simple task system. (B), (C), and (F)
realistically require some level of compatibility with CT and a very
careful look at any required changes in canon. (D) must be addressed
very early to guarantee compatilibity with (B), (E) and (F). If you
have (E) in the core rules, (D) probably needs to be available (and
tested out) first. Preferably, everything possible in (F) should be
designed with (D) as well.

What I\'m getting to is this:

o It is important that the design rules be made available as soon as
  possible and tested out. It sounds like the folks at IG already
  know this and are deciding on FF&S (hopefully under a better name).
  I\'ve never seen FF&S so can\'t comment on it, but you\'d better
  avoid the typos/flaws of MT or it\'s dead to begin with. Hopefully
  (E) doesn\'t need to be sacrificed either.

o You need to understand what is canon and what is diametrically
  opposed to it. Canon really only matters on a campaign scale. It
  doesn\'t really matter whether SOM says something works a certain
  way if that upsets the balance of the universe.

o Backward compatibility is a must, although equally important is
  knowing where not to be compatible (e.g., should a converted CT
  marine completely outclass a CT scientist or barbarian?). Some
  knowledge of how to convert old designs (e.g., assume scientists
  or Book 2 ships have certain other skills/equipment) is likely
  sufficient.

Regarding canon: Both HEPlaR and thruster plates are non-canonical
in my book, since both give players (and anyone who can get hold of
even a small spaceship) access to planet-killers. What needs to be
prevented is the amount of ENERGY available/needed in the ships\'
propulsion systems. Serious acceleration should only be possible
when some sort of device is present that limits your total kinetic
energy. Fusion "torch-ships" should be "welcomed" by SDBs at a
healthy distance from the main planet (they\'re easy to detect, and
modern "zeta-field" ships run circles around them anyway :-).

Regarding backward compatibility: One of the strengths of CT was
the grand scale of things. Tons of plot hooks (e.g., 76 Patrons)
and historical happenings could be developed without interfering
with each other. A referee could fully develop a half dozen worlds
in a subsector without worrying about the universe being pulled
out from under it. This feel was difficult to maintain in MT, and
I presume lost almost completely in TNE.

Regarding packaging: "Just say no" to flashy colorful covers. At
least put the art on a removable cover for the hard-bound book.
Of course, you can\'t beat those little black books :-).

I didn\'t mean to address so much at once, but while I\'m at it,
I might as well discuss gaining new players. One way to do this
is to package the core traveller rules (probably without (E)) as
a supplement that could be added as a few pages to the back of
science fiction books. Add another page for the main characters\'
UPPs and one for campaign notes and you\'re set! If you can\'t get
the "T4 Core" into a particular author\'s books, consider getting
into equipment and world guides (you know, the books that only
true SF fanatics/completists buy)--these would include both the
core rules and some design rules (likely not FF&S) provided for
"demonstrative" value as well as playability.

design rules (and hopefully forestall any more emails arguing me into a 
position I have already taken! :), I want to say once again that I fully 
support the vision that David Golden has articulated.

I think his idea of a high-level design system based on the low-level 
FF&S system is a good one, given that the high-level system will be 
comprised mostly of menu-like tables from which the user can pick and 
choose options and put them together without much beyond some addition, 
subtraction, and a bit of multiplication.  I think the completeness of 
this system will be welcomed by new players (which was my primary concern 
in the determination of which system to use).  

BTW, I believe the whole confusion over where I stand is my own fault.  
In the last public exchange I had with David, I allowed my thought 
processes to show through.  That is, the first few quote/reply sections in 
the message were dissenting, while the end of the message had quote/reply 
sections that were in agreement.  I was trying to show /why/ I had 
changed my mind, since I had initially been opposed to the FF&S Light 
system.  I didn\'t want to look like I was just jumping on the bandwagon, 
because that was not the case.  At any rate, I am very sorry for the 
confusion, and I hope this message clears it up.  I want to get beyond 
the argument and into the development stage! :-)

This is an exciting time to be a Traveller enthusiast, and I\'m glad to be 
among so many people who not only share my interest, but who have a lot 
of knowledge and ideas that are being put to use so we can all have the 
best Traveller yet.

While I don\'t have any answers yet from the powers that be, I

   b) Open the FTP archive for fan generated items.

So here is the juice on them:

    MPG-Net, on behalf of Tantalus Inc.  has created three new mailing 
lists for fans to discuss Dark Conspiracy, Twilight 2000, and 2300AD.  
The lists are:

    2300ad@mpgn.com / 2300ad-digest@mpgn.com
    twilight2000@mpgn.com / twilight2000-digest@mpgn.com
    darkconspiracy@mpgn.com / darkconspiracy-digest@mpgn.com

To subscribe to one of these lists, send mail to:

    majordomo@mpgn.com

and in the body say:

   subscribe listname email address

example:

   subscribe twilight2000-digest bubba@bubba.org


Regarding uploads:

   Tantalus Inc. doesn\'t mind any fan created materials for Dark Conspiracy, 
Twilight 2000, or 2300AD. You may do so as long as it meets the following
critera:

1. It has to contain a disclaimer.  See ftp://ftp.mpgn.com/DISCLAIMER.TANTALUS
   For text documents, the disclaimer needs to appear at the top of the 
   document.  For programs, it needs to appear on any title/splash screen or
   About box.

2. Tantalus Inc. would like you to upload it to ftp.mpgn.com in the /incoming 
   directory. Then send mail to ftp-maint@mpgn.com that you have uploaded it 
   and its for one of the systems listed here (which this isn\'t bad advice for 
   any upload) and upload a .submission file.  A template for the .submission file 
   can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.mpgn.com/incoming/template.sub.  After its 
   reviewed to make sure its cool (i.e. you haven\'t scanned in the books, its not 
   offensive etc.), MPG-Net will put it out for public access.

3. If you have a web page for your product, or gaming, or other appropriate
   content, please include a link to our site http://www.mpgn.com.

The disclaimer reads:

I am thinking about a classic setting in an unpublished corner of the

so it won\'t be much of a problem in that respect.

     Um, "blowtorches?"  I don\'t understand--thruster plates are a
reactionless drive.  They don\'t throw anything out the back--no exhaust,
no mess, no noise, no bother.  That\'s why I like them so much (once
they\'ve been suitably tweaked).

     Why "blowtorches?"

Because I treated CT drives as reaction drives, as I said, I never used

        Sorry to disappoint you, but ... FF&S (suitably renamed) is going to
be the detailed design sequence for MMT, and I\'ve been told to avoid making
changes as I create FF&S Light. Thruster plates *will* continue to be
available as "alternate" technology. Reaction drives such as HEPlaR are the
primary focus, though.

        I queried Don about this, because I agree ... my second-most
favorite thing about TNE (after FF&S) was the fact that the _entire_ range
of weapons, from handguns to battleship spinal mounts, use the same basic
system. Don agrees, and he says the coordination will happen. Worst comes to
worst, the predesigned weapons in FF&S Light can be redesigned in less than
a day, and replaced BEFORE it gets printed.

        Sorry, I thought I\'d explained my thinking. The "Crew Factor" listed
in my tables is the FF&S crew the system needs. FF&S, being written for TNE
with Virus, assumes automation is very low and unintelligent. A simple
fractional multiplier would then be used to reduce that crew factor down for
more automated ships. This tweak doesn\'t invalidate FF&S, it just expands on it.

        2) The GDW-Beta list is archived realtime to the WWW at
           http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/gdw-beta/

That\'s what I already do.  I made up a form for Worlds, a form for
characters, and a form for ships with the description of the UP down
the left a blank for the number and the rest of the line for more info
and descriptive comments.  Below the official UP lines I add my own,
and use the rest to the page for other data. Everytime something
changes I have to change the forms..they\'re out of date at the moment,
and have some stuff that isn\'t standard Traveller.  

Would you like me to post samples here?

Me!  I haven\'t GMed or been a player in a face-to-face game in almost
2 years.  <sigh> Anybody around Pensacola FL want to get a game going?
I\'d *love* to play some live!  

>Also, has anyone given serious thought to whether any parts of
Traveller can be played out over the \'Net?

I have!  And I have!  <g> I ran a Traveller (non-Imperium) game on
VNET for about a year.  The players gave me TNE stats and skills (I
modified them somewhat), and we exchanged moves.  I did all the
rolling and I didn\'t use Traveller specific terms in my messages, like
UWP\'s or USP\'s, because most of them didn\'t have any Traveller
materials.  To the players the game rules were pretty much invisible,
but the feel was classic CT!

I\'m gonna do another one on Fido (SF&ANIME_RPG) starting this summer. 
I need to finish several projects before I have time to start, but
late June, early July looks like a launch date.

If and when my email game DART (Star Trek universe/TNE mechanics)
winds down, I\'ll start a T4 game.  Heck, after T4 comes out I might
put DART on hiatus and run a pure Traveller anyway! <G>

It certainly is!

There are several problems:

1.  Mail-lag times.  You might send in a post to the GM and get
nothing back for a week or two.  Players have to be really patient for
it to work.  I currently GM or play in 8 games via email or echomail,
so it can be done.  

I encourage open posting in the games I GM..everybody gets everybody
elses messages (although really secret stuff stays private), and chats
with each other.  The PC\'s can\'t *act* on anything their character
wouldn\'t actually know, but they can read most of what\'s going on.  So
even when they don\'t get a move for a week..or two..they still can
stay involved while waiting.

2.  Lost mail/bad connections.  We all know it happens, so we have to
be ready and willing to repost and forward for other players.

3.  Distributing maps, pictures..anything graphical.

4.  People losing access.  Boards go down.  People move,
graduate, change jobs.

But it *can* be done and it\'s as much fun as live gameing..in a
different way.  I don\'t think either way replaces the other.

>Using IRC or some other forum is more likely to work.  

Yes, IRC does work and gives more of a *live* feel.  I\'ve played that
way a couple of times.  Personally, I don\'t like it as well as
email..or live.

>I use the web for distributing maps, library data, and such, and use

That\'s something I want to do for my email games eventually.  I also
send mime or uuencoded stuff with maps and graphics.  I even went out
and bought a scanner *primarily* for my email stuff. <g>

        Actually, I was planning on neither ... what I\'m thinking of as
automation isn\'t mechanical stuff that fixes things, etc. It\'s software that
enhances the ability of the user, and hence doesn\'t really add space.

Example: Now, instead of having a guy sitting in front of a radar screen, a
guy sitting in front of an infrared scanner, a third guy monitoring the
optical telescope -- you pipe a processed, enhanced and interpreted image
combining all three to one guy (sensor fusion).

Or, instead of having a dozen people monitoring dumb readouts in engineering
to baby the power plant, you\'ve got one guy with his feet up on the
terminal, watching the computer watch the system

Why am I thinking along these lines? It\'s much simpler and quicker to
implement than coming up with new rules for controls, etc, and it extends
FF&S without changing any of the existing FF&S rules. In the same manner you
can say Einsteinian physics didn\'t change Newtonian -- it merely addressed
an area not covered by Newtonian.

Not that I\'m opposed to new rules -- we\'re in a time crunch here. If
somebody can pull up the HAIS rules (I\'ve lost them), and integrate them
into the existing FF&S rules, I\'ll slap them in and go to bat for them. But
they\'ve got to be something we can pull back out, just like we can take the
crew multipliers back out, if we have to.


<BRAINFLASH>
        Duh... if I\'m talking about multiplying the crew numbers as an
"extension" to the rules, we can also multiply the basic control system
numbers by a factor ... say, for example, at TL12, each 10% increase in size
in the basic control system gives you a 5% reduction in crew requirements.

        Anybody wanna take this & run with it?

You really think so?  Hmmm.  I saw the flaw being that there weren\'t more

done so as well - plus advanced systems for other Citizens character 
types, a scientist, and a lot of other things.  

I\'m hoping this will be corrected in T4, since they plan on having 10 
basic character types.  Keep the military stuff, but make that only 30% 
or so of the character types available.

Wow.  Good summary!  I love the diversity of activities associated with 
Traveller, and I hope this is continued in the new system.

Thankfully, the word is that all of these things will be done.  Marc has 
said the production values will be very high, David Golden has said FF\'S 
will be renamed, and FF&S Light is taking shape live, on a web-site!  
Whoo-hoo! :)

I can\'t comment on TNE, but in my conversations with Ken Whitman, I was 
told that each referee will be designing his own worlds outside of a 
small, core area of "known space."  You\'ll know where the worlds are, but 
you won\'t know what they\'re like.  It will be up to you to determine what 
each world is like (and, undoubtedly, various published Adventures will 
offer predesigned worlds if the referee doesn\'t want to design his/her 
own).

     Um, okay...  Why?  I mean, thruster plates are massively superior
to any type of reaction drive.  Why use them at all?

     Reaction-based drives are so...low-tech declasse\'.  Not to mention

As for redesign try this
Lasers
(delivered energy in joules X .735/Beam Diameter in mm)^.5=A Guns Guns Guns
Damage Value

2.5(sqrt(DE(1/r^2)\\) to arrive at FF&S Damage value.

I for one would not care to convert one design to another even with
extensive spreadsheet experience much less in less than a day.

Give your system a benchmark then
a 100 ton needle/AF with 2 jump and 2G manueover and a crew of one!!

I for am worried about having two entirely different systems, you might give

Penetration scale:
Dagger - 1
Light/medium pistol, sword, bow - 2 (current 9mm pistol)
heavy pistol, heavy melee weapon, crossbow  - 3 (current .44)
Carbine (generic bullpup) or seriously heavy pistol - 4 (M-16)
ACR - 5 to 6
Light crew served - 7 to 8 (a current 20mm is 8 or 9, while a .50cal is 6-7)
RPG-7 - 20
A heavy AT missile like a Hellfire would be in the 38-40 range on this scale.

There is more than a differance in scale it the method of approaching the
weapons design.

Hmm let test this out with a example

The Starship "Go For it" has landed at the starport "Ty Me Down". After
having a dispute with planetary authorities the ship attempts to lift off
without permission.

The locals bring out the "Dorkbruiser" Superheavy Assault Tank mounting a
555 Mw Gatling Partical Beam weapon. The "Dorkbruiser" is armored with 100mm
of Hemostatic Crystallized Feldercarb. The Bruiser has Mu-Quark Nightmare
Integrated Sensor Fire Control System with optional beer cooler.

Meanwhile the "Go For It" unlimbers it\'s 300 Mj Laser Barbette with a it\'s
own MFD and beam pointer!!! The ship has a Armor Value of 100 in Superdense
Armor.

Gee now the Bruiser\'s weapon has pen/damage of 45/67 versus 1cm of
Feldercarb armor, the 300 Mj Laser Barbette has pen of...

Well you could see a worst case situation.

explanation of what the digit stood for at the end of each line.  There were

I don\'t know if my description is clear enough, but providing a similar

I\'ve said so far doesn\'t make sense, I can try to scan my card in and 
post it on an ftp site somewhere -- but I did it in fine-point mechanical

the same type size and spacing, having a key like that can make life easier.

Just a thought.

Um, because I thought reactionless drives were silly (in a nutshell) :-)

Actually, CT drives *were* fusion rockets.  1st edition HG had rules for
using drive exhaust as a fusion gun, didn\'t it?  That\'s what we did,
actually.  Like Niven stuff.

I thought that trying to make sense of the canon starports with blast
berms around the landing pads, and explanations for why *all* ships have
clear exhaust chambers at the rear made no sense (I thought of it as a
*shudder* MT invention :-)

You experience is far from typical.  Most people can\'t memorize what
each of 30 some odd digits means in 20 min without even trying.  I
glad it works so well for you, but the fact is that their use
is going to be a barrier to new players.

How says the most technologically superior drive is the best?  Would

Tom, Stu\'s response misrepresents history, or at least doesn\'t provide much
information. Game Designers\' Workshop first released Traveller in 1977.  It
was supported by a quarterly magazine called the Journal of the Traveller\'s
Aid Society ("JTAS"). That was later supplanted by Challenge.  JTAS and
Challenge contained many articles setting out the future history of the
Traveller Universe.  

GDW (and licensees, notably Digest Group Publications) also produced many
supplements and adventures that incorporated and explicated the future
history.  Some important works to note are Library Data (2 volumes), the
Imperial Encyclopedia, the GDW alien modules (Aslan, Vargr, Kkree, Zhodani,
Droyne, Solomani), the DGP alien modules (Vilani & Vargr; Solomani & Aslan).  

Aficionados refer to the body of GDW-produced and -approved work as the
"canon".  Learn the canon.  Study the canon.

        Unfortunately, there\'s not much that I can do about it. All I\'m
going to do is plug the standard FF&S weapons into the tables, and assume
that if they\'ve changed somebody at Imperium Games has the new stats. If
nobody does, then obviously they can\'t have been changed.

        Funny thing ... that was exactly the goal I had in mind! I just

Traveller fusion plants seem to use some sort of magnetic confinement
(as opposed to inertial confinement). And as researchers have learned
the hard way, there are *definite* scaling problems with the magnetic
fields. For a given type of magnetic field setup there is actually a
minimum size at which you can make a reactor work! If you try building
one smaller than that, you get losses of plasma that prevent operation,
long before you get to the fusion temperature and pressure ranges. 

So you add subsidiary magnetic fields, to help "stabilize" the plasma.
But the new configuration has its own scaling problems. 

So all that is really needed is for the Vilani to have made a
breakthrough in finding a new field configuration that has acceptable
leakage rates and acceptable stability at less than 100 ton sizes.

For what it is worth, reseaerchers did some calcs *years* back on the
minimum size required for a workable "magnetic mirror" (ie long
cylindrical magnetic field, like you\'d get from a *huge* solenoid type
coil) and simple torus (field bent into a "donut" shape). As I recall a
magnetic mirror reactor would work just fine if you were willing to
make it 10 *miles* long. And a toroidal reactor would work fine at 8
miles in diameter. (If we wanted to get *really* "gearhead" we could
allow for scaling bonuses at such sizes :-)

Another possibility is muon-catalyzed fusion. If you inject megative
muons (mu mesons) into the plasma, they replace electrons, and allow
the protons to get *much* closer. This gives you fusion at *much* lower
temps and pressure. The problem is generating the muons. By any chance
woul TL-12 be the level at which the meson gun first shows up? If so,
that would tie in nicely. The same breaktrough that allows the meson
gun would also allow the smaller reactors. Even if meson guns show up
at TL-11, it\'d still work, you just say that it took another TL worth
of developement to make it suitable for use in a reactor instead of a
weapon.

Either of the above (revolutionary new field config, or muon catalyzed
fusion) should do as "fusion plus".

You could look at it either way, of course. Book 2 and Supplement 4(?)
characters were fine for roleplaying, but greatly outclassed by Book
4-7 characters. It\'s somewhat frustrating when a Book 4 character has
more brains than the Scientist, more brawn than the Barbarian, more
bargaining skills than the (non-advanced) Merchant, etc.

If you wanted characters with "advanced" skills, your best bet was to
let the Referee design all of the characters from scratch so they were
balanced (based on player input).

   On my list of FF&S fixes would be the following:

1) A method for calculating ship crews based on better automation
(more computer control, use of robots).

2) Fixing the formula for calculating the weight of mass drivers
projectiles, which causes mass drivers guns to consume far too much
energy.

3) Not in FF&S, but a robot design sequence that yields lighter robots,
particularly at high tech levels.

4) An established upper limit for laser power based on TL.

5) Improved leg transmissions at higher tech levels for robots, walker
vehicles, etc. (I\'ve been working on this myself).

   Other items, like a water craft design sequence are probably not in the
cards.  Any thoughts?

Harold

All that I was really trying to say, is that he wouldn\'t find it in 
the 3 books.

Actually, you misrepresent things slightly here.  GDW licensed & 
approved quite a bit of stuff that is not regarded as "canon" by this 
group as well...or did you forget about Judges Guild and Paranoia 
Press?

Also, quite a bit of GDW\'s "canon" contradicts itself.  Badly, in some 
instances.  HEPlaR (TNE) vs. Thruster Plates (CT & MT).  DGP\'s 
Sparklers/Baddies From The Core (MT)  vs. TNE\'s Empress Wave.  Two 
completely different sets of Ships of the Imperium (CT v. MT).  The 
press releases from JTAS re. the 5th Frontier War contradict the flow 
of the campaign to some extent as shown in Spinward Marches Campaign.  

I guess what I\'m trying to say is that you\'ll have to pick and choose 
a little bit from the mounds of published material...if you read 
something you don\'t like throw it out, because GDW has in newer books 
more than once...

As far as sources for the "canon", Glenn\'s answer is correct.

Old JTAS\'s & Challenge (which succeeded JTAS)
Imperial Encyclopedia (MT)
Library Data (CT)
CT Alien Modules 8 in all (1 for each major race + Darrians)
DGP Alien Modules
Various Adventures & Games written over the years (Fifth Frontier 
War, Imperium, Invasion Earth, all of the DGP & GDW published 
adventures)

A couple of others he didn\'t mention:
Travellers Digest/MegaTraveller Journal by DGP (a good magazine at 
the time when GDW cut back coverage of the game from a quarterly 
totally devoted to CT to a bimonthly with a couple of articles in it.

Rebellion Sourcebook
Hard Times

All of this stuff is long out of print of course.  Expect collectors 
prices if you try to pick them up.  I hope someday for the newer 
people on the list that some of this stuff is released in some form 
for newer players to enjoy.  Frankly, much of the old CT stuff was 
fun precisely because the "canon" wasn\'t so well developed.

Yes, indeed.  I suppose the summary would be that, if there will be an 
advanced character generation process such as that used in Books 4-7, 
then it should be used for all character types.  And, as I mentioned 
before, I\'d sure like to see a predominance of non-military characters 
(ie, 7 out of 10 should be non-military in nature).  
And, of course, as you said, each character type should have advantages 
in its own area of experties (ie, Merchants, on average, come out with 
better trading skills than any other character type, etc.)

I wonder what IG has planned . . .

I agree with this comment.  The advanced character generation was *so* 
advantageous that no player would willingly forego it -- we need advanced 
systems for *all* character careers, or none.  I prefer "all."

tied the virus into the rules, making official background part of the rule

published background was often a source of imformation for me I always
wanted to develop my own backgrounds and settings.  

The second reason (IMHO) that both MegaTraveller and TNE failed is due to
the massive number of typos in the rule books.  SIX PAGES of error

Good luck to MMT!  My order for a signed copy has already been placed!

like they are not totally set on this yet.  If everyone who feels as I do
emails Don Perrin (dperrin@mag7.com) (who is writing Starships) or other
folks at IG we may convince them to use thruster plates instead. 

Why keep thruster plates?

1) Using a reaction drive means ships need to refuel a whole lot more
often, so possibilities for in-system exploration are much more limited.

2) There is much more book-keeping for players and GMs to keep track of.  
With T-plates you only need to worry about refueling for jumps, this is 
much less of a pain.

3) The idea of having contra-grav w/o reactionless drives just strikes me
as silly.  If you want a Hard SF game drop *both* contra-grav *and*
T-plates. If you want soft SF, don\'t mix-n-match. 

4) Loosing thruster platers and gravitic maneuver drives also means that
air-rafts now seem remarkably silly.  Air rafts and grav bikes now must
have ducted fans or jets on them.  Air-rafts built for vacuum worlds need
rockets!  If some nifty, high-tech solution to propelling small vehicles
could be found about half my problem would be solved, the idea of needing
to stick a ducted fan or a jet on a TL 15 air-raft seems both silly and
inelegant. 

5) How about if Thruster plates were a TL 12 invention?  Yet another
reason the Imperium is so popular.  HEPLaR would exist out on the fringes
while the core areas would be using T-plates.  I quite like this idea. 

Act now and we may save them.

I usually hate "bravo" or "me too" posts, but that one phrase, \'be the
canon\', says it all.  Hell, I started playing Traveller before there *was*
any of this \'canon\' crap.

A good referee IS the canon, the only canon needed.

 I think that the decision to reduce crew size should be just that, a
design decision. A post somewhere discussed the differences between an
LA-class attack sub and a Swedish sub. Other design differences aside,
one of the design factors that US warships deal with is damage control
and fire fighting. You may only need one guy to man the helm, but you
sure would like to have the other three around to put out a fire. 

My group plays realistics rules given post combat recoeveries. If they
do not have the damage control teams to fix things, they suffer.

I would apply any modifiers to size (volume) of controls versus the
crew they replace as a conscious design decision.

As I said earlier, I consider both Thruster Plates and HEPlaR to be
non-canonical, since both put powerful weapons in the hands of too
many people. The solution is simple: specify that tremendous amounts
of energy are not required in order to reach the speeds that are
commonly attained by Trav ships. HEPlaR ships could still exist, but
newer ships would run rings around them. I can come up with a simple
technological contrivance that makes this possible (it could affect
other aspects of maneuvering if you wish). I\'m sure you can too
(but be careful to balance the laws of conservation of energy and
momentum even when relativistic effects are considered).

I consider this necessary for consistency in the primary Traveller
campaign universe. The issue of whether or not reaction mass is
needed never bothered me, though--have it either way. The lower
energy requirements will mean that maneuver fuel would more likely
last for months than hours, though (especially at higher TLs).
(Actually, I kind of like the idea of using reaction mass--it is
more fitting with ship drawings. The purpose of the rocket exhaust
would be to "get the reaction mass out of the zeta field" or some
such contrivance, not to funnel tremendous amounts of energy.)

Do you see why a contrivance like this is necessary?

HEPlaR: everyone has a giant fusion gun

Thruster Plates: everyone has a relativistic planet killer

"zeta field": makes either of the above work, but implies that you
              will have lots of maneuver fuel (at least at high TLs)

opens up a hole into jump space and the thrust is output there?  The 
reaction mass travels at some huge velocity in jump space and thus very 
little of it is needed to get huge amounts of thrust.  Some 
version/part of the reaction mass comes back as energy (some of it 
being short wavelength light or something that breaks down into SWL, to 
give that beautiful blue glow).  Works for me, though it of course 
violates lots of laws :-).

Another possibility would be to have m-drives be "warp drives".  They
expand the space behind the ship while contracting it in front of the
ship, and the ship "surfs" the wave of expanding space.  There is a more
official name for this type of drive, but I can\'t remember it.  I do
remember that it has been mentioned as one of the few ideas for FTL 
travel that sorta fits with modern physics.  However, there\'s no reason 
(I think) that this sort of idea couldn\'t be used for slower than light.  
You can just put some sort of arbitrary limit on it (this is 
pseudo-science after all) and say that it can provide no more than 6g 
acceleration, but that it does so with high efficiency.  Since the ship 
is not actually accelerated through space, there is no violation of laws 
of conservation.

    'body' => 'Hi David.  I admire your dedication to this project.  Keep it up!  I 
would like to make a few (hopefully helpful) suggestions:

	The first is a reminder to keep things simple.  I like what your
doing so far, but you should be wary of the temptation to complicate
things.  Remember that something you design always seems really simple to
you, but may not be to others.  Some possibilities you might want to
consider (not being an FFS aficionado, I\'m not sure if these are feasible,
but here goes...): 

SIMPLIFYING SUGGESTIONS

1) Regarding the problem of hull armor and bracing for thrust.  Could you 
not simply declare a certain minimum armor value for a certain thrust 
value?  Or are bracing and armor seperate?

2) Why can\'t jump fuel just be 10% of the ship\'s volume per parsec?

3) When assigning crew, why not include their quarters with the 
components as you buy them?  For instance, if you just installed 200 tons 
of drives, why not have a "mini step" afterwards in which you put in 
staterooms for the 2 engineers that will be required (or 1 room if ship 
is military).


FUSION PLUS SUGGESTION

	I\'m no phsicist, but aren\'t there a number of different fusion
reaction types (e.g. deuterium-deuterium, dueterium-tritium), and don\'t
these have different efficiencies?  Perhaps the d-d reaction is too
inefficient and plants below a certain size don\'t provide appreciable
amounts of energy.  But when one masters d-t reactions, one can get good
energy out of even a small plant.  The above is sort of sketchy, but maybe
someone with more a physics background can fill it in. 


MANEUVER DRIVE LIMITS

	On your web page you expressed a problem with the 6 g limit,
saying that it seems quite arbitrary.  Also, people have frequently
complained about the huge upper limit of velocity for ships with thruster
plates.  I have a suggestion that might solve both problems.  I was
thinking that t-plates might be thought of as slower-than-light "warp
drives" (there\'s a more official name, but I can\'t think of it right now). 
These drives expand space behind a ship and contract it in front, allowing
the ship to "surf" the wave of expanding space behind it. 

	This drive concept has been put forth in various fairly reputable
places as one of the few ideas for FTL travel that doesn\'t violate modern
physics (more or less), but I don\'t see why it could not be used as the
basis of a maneuver drive.  One simply has to put arbitrary limits on it. 
Normally, I don\'t like arbitrary limits, but since this is
quasi-scientific anyway, it should be a little easier to take.  The
handwaving explanation could be something like "the fabric of space/time
will not tolerate expansion /contraction rates above a certain limit, and
thus 6 g is all the thrust one can get out of such a drive".  This also
allows one to put an uppper limit on the speed of the ship with "the
expansion/contraction limits also place a maximum of .1 C on the speed of
a ship using such a drive"  or something like that. 

Hope this helps,
Charles.

Being a newbie to Traveller (I believe the only newbie on the list?) I can
sya that I got a lot of the Traveller stuff at non-collector\'s prices.

I got the MT Boxed Set, the Aslan & Solomani, 101 Vehicles (Also could have
gotten Starship Operator\'s Manual but didn\'t have the cash) and the ORIGINAL
CT boxed set (those little black books) for a measly price.  I\'m also gonn a
be shortly buying the Traveller book, also for a nice, discounted price :)

Yes, there are several of us who agree with your assessment.  We also 
like the idea of having the number of non-military advanced generation 
character types far outweight the number of military ones.  Another point 
that has been brought up is that each character generated under a 
specific generation system should be, on average, better than any other 
character type /in his specialty/.  That is, Merchant characters should 
be best at trade, for example.  Under the CT system, a character 
generated under the basic rules for Marchants could easily end up with 
less trade-related skills than a character generated under the advanced 
military character rules.

Which, of course, is just a long way of saying, "I agree." :)

Hopefully, these changes will be implemented in T4, since it is going to 
have 10 character types (if I am no mis-remembering).

and benefits. Constructive criticism is sincerely invited.

THE TRAVELLER UNIVERSE
Traveller is a comprehensive science-fiction future with its origins in the
distant past. Fundamental to the Traveller concept are answers to myriad
questions about life, society, civilization in the universe. Yet everything
is part of a cohesive structure that gradually unveils itself to the
participants and to observers (whether they be readers, viewers, or players).
Traveller describes a vast future universe in which mankind has already
reached the stars and conquered thousands of worlds, but still faces the
never-ending struggle to conquer more worlds and wrest more secrets from the
universe.

FOUNDED ON BOTH HARD AND SOFT SCIENCE
Traveller is founded on the sciences: technological science and social
science. Each adds realism to the systems universe while enhancing its
adventure potential.

TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCE PROVIDES A FOUNDATION
The technological basis for Traveller provides a common ground from which all
extrapolations and story ideas can spring.
		The Jump Drive. The secret of interstellar travel is the jump drive. While
in normal space, travel is limited to the speed of light (and it takes years
to go from one star to another), jump drive leaps around space: a jump covers
one parsec (3.26 light years; the average distance between stars) in about a
week. Improved ships can reach speeds of more than 1,000 times the speed of
light.
		Communication Limited To The Speed Of Transportation. But the universe is
so vast that even the mega-speeds of jump drive cant work miracles. No one
has yet (or ever) invented a hyper communicator that will send messages
faster than light -speed. Communication is limited to the speed of
transportation; a message to the edge of the empire needs to be carried
there. For an empire 300 parsecs to the border that message takes more than a
year to deliver, even under the best of circumstances. News of war, conflict,
invasion, disaster, or even peace takes just as long to get back to the
center of government.
		Gravity Manipulation. The advance of technology has resulted in practical
methods of gravity manipulation. Gravity manipulation expresses itself in
three ways: as artificial gravity, as inertial dampers, and as thrusters.
Artificial gravity is built into the deck plates of starships, rendering a
natural environment most like that of a planet surface. Inertial dampers
eliminate the extremes of inertia which can pull and push people and
equipment as it maneuvers. Although such dampers are imperfect, they do allow
a normal environment on starships as they maneuver, and they allow extreme
physical maneuvers on small craft as they perform high-G maneuvers.
 Thrusters are the final aspect of gravity manipulation: they move vehicles
forward without the necessity of reaction mass (as required for rockets).
Thrusters work like rockets, but without the requirements for large amounts
of rocket fuel.
		Fusion Power. Cheap fusion power means that the inhabitants of this
universe are not tied to gas stations or complex fuel systems. Hydrogen taken
from water, ice, even the methane of gas giants like Jupiter is all that is
required to produce abundant electricity. Once a culture rises to the minimum
required tech level, its cities depend on electricity produced by efficient,
pollution free fusion power. Starships draw their fuel from the worlds they

SOCIAL SCIENCE ADDS CHARACTER AND FLAVOR
The social sciences add a characteristic flavor to this universe by
emphasizing the effects of the social sciences on societies in the universe.
Psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, and economics all impact the
activities of the people and the stories of this universe.
		A Cosmopolitan Universe. Traveller is a diverse, heterogeneous universe
composed of many different factions, concepts, races, communities, and
individuals. People (and the term is used to refer to "beings") come in many
different forms, all of whom constantly interact as a matter of course.
Naturally, there is conflict, antagonism, friction, and strife between
various groups, but the universe itself allows any with talent to rise to the
top.
		A Human Dominated Universe. Through a combination of fortuitous accident
and strong-willed effort, humanity has reached a position of dominance in the
universe. Three distinct groups of humans (the Vilani, the Solomani, and the
Zhodani) have each created empires that span thousands of stars and trillions
of citizens. In addition, more than a hundred additional human societies
scattered among the stars; each is, in its own way, a commentary on the
strengths and the particular weaknesses of the human condition.
		Duty, Honor, and Loyalty. Naturally (see: Communication Limited To The
Speed Of Transportation), interstellar society values people (human or not)
on whom it can depend: those who are loyal and who faithfully do their duty
are the ones to whom society awards responsibility. A natural nobility arises
of those leaders of society who faithfully and with innovation follow the
orders of their superiors. At the same time, superiors have learned to
express their orders in the most general of terms: to give greater freedom of
action.
		There Is No "Prime Directive." Interstellar governments have never felt it
their duty to impede development, especially economic development. As a
result, no government has ever promulgated the "Prime Directive (that
undeveloped cultures and societies be allowed to develop without interference
until they can enter the community of interstellar civilizations). Instead,
economic forces have driven the development of those worlds rich in natural
or exploitable resources, and have retarded the development of worlds without
resources.
		Everything Is Driven By Economics. Regardless of the pronouncements of
political, moral, or cultural leaders, action in this universe takes place
because it will produce some economic advantage. Economic advantage generally
means rewards in a monetary sense, but it can also mean rewards in political
or social power. But at the foundation of all action is economics.
		Wheels Within Wheels. The quest for meaning is always fruitful in the
Traveller universe. Events, ideas, concepts, and beliefs are shaped by
environments, but they are also shaped by the thinkers themselves. And as
those thinkers (be they readers, players, or viewers) learn and mature, they
begin to have new insights into their beliefs. For example, the uninformed
consider the Zhodani (an human race with some ability in psionics) an evil
empire intent on destroying the Imperium. Only with time is it possible to
see these Zhodani as humans with families, goals and desires just like other
humans. And only with time is it possible to see that some Zhodani are evil.
In the Traveller system, Wheels within Wheels constantly shows new ideas and
new facets of old ideas to the participants.

ADVENTURE!
Above all, this universe is filled with adventure. Individuals can own
starships and travel on their own to distant worlds. Individuals can
undertake literally world-shattering missions whose results depend on their
personal courage and resources. Individuals are the key to discovery,
progress, and the turning points in history.
The Traveller system addresses adventure through three specific areas:
Casual Players. Any role-player can play Traveller. The concepts are
intuitive: combat, travel, tasks. Individuals can role-play diverse
characters or they can play themselves.
Detailed Role-Players. Traveller provides dedicated gamers the opportunity to
role-play complex characters with strong motivations and intricate
backgrounds. The Traveller system can be as casual or as rich as the
participants want it to be.
Systems Engineers. The Traveller system provides referees and game masters
the materials with which to explore the Traveller universe in detail.
Starship design systems, world generation systems, vehicle description
systems, trade and commerce systems, animal generation and encounter systems.
Each is produced with two specific goals in mind: as a prod to the
imagination, and to allow game masters opportunities to create custom
equipment or information.

HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE
The universe are we know it was irrevocably influenced by a meek pastoral
intelligent race (the Droyne) which evolved some 200 parsecs from Earth some
300,000 years ago. The activities of these people continues to be felt
throughout time and space.
Grandfather (300,000 BC). One of the Droyne was born a mutation incredibly
intelligent and incredibly talented. In his first few years, he realized the
full import of his talents and used them to conquer his world and his people
(not that either really resisted). This super-genius Droyne (called
Grandfather by modern anthropologists) then turned his attention to space,
invented space ships and then starships with jump drive. He and his people
ventured out into the universe. He raised a family of super-genius children
(nearly as smart as he) and they scattered to settle hundreds of worlds, each
engaged in some sort of scientific research. Grandfather invented immortality
(for himself only it seems; he shared a lesser form of it with his children).
He invented energy sources, world shattering weapons, mind-boggling
transportation systems, and pocket universes. Much of what he invented is
still unattainable to modern man.
At some point, he and his children had a disagreement which escalated into
galaxy wide war. That war completely destroyed the Ancients and their
thousands of cities on hundreds of worlds. The modern universe can see the
fossil remnants of this war on worlds which still bear the scars of
super-high-tech war, and in Ancient sites: the ruins of those war-spoiled
cities.
But there is another, less obvious, reminder of the Ancients. At some time in
their travels, the Ancients visited Earth and carried away several thousand
near-intelligent cavemen. Grandfathers children must have found them useful
in some way because they took them to hundreds of worlds. At the end of the
Ancient War, the Ancients were dead, but humanity lived on. Each of those
planets became a new world which humans conquered and created a unique yet
human culture.
The Vilani Era (4700 BC to 2300 AD). The first of these many human races to
reach the stars was the Vilani. About 5,000 BC, they began to create a
star-spanning empire through their monopoly on the jump drive. Only they had
the secret of faster than light travel, and they used it to monopolize trade
and dominate both human and non-human cultures for dozens of light years
around. Eventually, the Ziru Sirkaa (as the Vilani Empire was called) became
a rigid, brittle culture dedicated to maintaining the status quo. Laws,
politics, social pressure all emphasized conformity and resistance to change.
Innovation and technological change were prohibited. Their four thousand year
empire was drawing to an end.
The Terran Confederation (2100 to 2300 AD). In about 2100, Earth invented the
jump drive and reached the stars, only to find them already taken.
Fortunately for tiny Earth, the Vilani Empire ignored the Terran upstarts
long enough for them to gain a foothold among the stars. Over the course of
200 years, the Vilani and the Terrans fought a dozen interstellar wars, each
one seemingly inconclusive, but edging the Vilani Empire closer to collapse.
In 2299, the Vilani were defeated so soundly that they surrendered.
The Rule of Man (2300 to 2750 AD). Terra, with perhaps a hundred worlds in
its confederation, now faced the immense task of ruling, as a conquered
territory, the now collapsed Ziru Sirka, with 40,000 worlds. Terra created
the Rule of Man: the Second Imperium, to govern these conquered worlds, often
assigning mere lieutenants as governors of worlds, and naval captains to rule
subsectors of 30-40 worlds. It was a losing battle. Nothing, not
technological innovation, not social change, not new blood, not threat of
outside invasion, was sufficient to raise the former Vilani worlds from their
cultural lethargy. Slowly, over the course of 400 years, the worlds of the
Rule of man drifted into a dark age.
The Long Night (2750 AD to 4550 AD). When interstellar trade shut down, the
Rule of Man ceased as an interstellar government. Each world found itself on
its own, living or dying on its own resources. Outpost worlds dependent on
food or supplies shipped in from agricultural worlds simply died. Scattered
starship trade kept other worlds alive, but after a few centuries, even the
starships stopped running. Each world found itself along in a sea of space,
completely dependent on its own resources. This Long Night lasted for more
than 1700 years.
The Third Imperium (4521 to 5637 AD). One world tenuously held on to its
technology, its resources, and its knowledge, remaining a beacon of hope in
the Long Night. Ultimately, it began its own reconquest of the worlds of the
former empire under the Starburst Banner of the Third Imperium. From a base
of a dozen worlds, the Third Imperium began a systematic effort to recontact
the 40,000 worlds of the old Ziru Sirka and bring them under one rule. Some
accepted immediately; others resisted, but none could resist the combined
military might and economic incentives that the Imperium could offer. Over
the next 500 years, the empire reached out to absorb tens of thousands of
worlds.
The Aslan Border Wars (3400 to 4900 AD). The conflict of the Aslan against
the Imperium along their common border.
The Vargr Campaigns (4700 to 4900 AD). The conflict of the Vargr against the
Aslan along their common border.
The Barracks Emperors (5100 to 5140 AD). The defining power struggle of the
military hierarchy and the ruling noble families of the Imperium as competing
factions fight to be the ones that rule the interstellar empire.
The Solomani Expansion (5121 AD to 6500 AD). The struggle of the Solomani
worlds (both within and outside the Imperium) as they endeavor to establish a
community of worlds.
The Rebellion (5367 AD). The Imperium, now more than a thousand years old, is
split asunder as competing factions fight to create the next Emperor, or to
chart their own path outside the established Imperium.

THERES MORE!
There is so much more to the Traveller universe that can only be touched on
here: The Zhodani expeditions to the core of the galaxy. The Psionic
Suppressions. The Julian War. The Ilelish Revolt. The First Survey. The
Solomani Rim Wars. The Hiver Interventions. The Virus Era. The Regency. The
Far Far Future. The Expeditions to the Rim. The Heat Death of the Universe.
Each of these milieux (or eras) is another opportunity to provide
participants with adventure and insight into the human condition as they
explore the comprehensive science-fiction universe that is Traveller.

Again, we need to remember that Thurster plates aren\'t the only
reactionless drive.  I personally don\'t like thruster plates but
have no objection to reactionless drives in general.

Actually, not.  The lack of thruster plates gives and elegant solution
to the question of how Air Rafts exist but can be used for interplanetary
travel.  Antigravity works by pushing against a body.  As you get into
space there are not always sufficiently close bodies in a desired
direction.  That is why they are so poor for space ships.  I give
Air Rafts penalties to piloting rolls as they get further away from
a plant.

Actually, as you\'ve probably noticed, there\'s been a thread running 
on it.  In the past, I\'ve had a tendency to tweak non Advanced 
characters running in the same game as advanced...  I think that a 
good improvement for T4 would be to go ahead and do advanced 
character generation options for "ALL" character classes.

You did bother to read TNE didn\'t you?  Sure Virus was a major factor in the
rule book but any stup\' with two cents worth of imagination is more than
capable of creating his own corner of the universe, thats that all that
sector generating stuff was for in the middle, remember that?  And if you
wanted to you were more than welcome to alter the settings as you saw fit.
The reason so much space was devoted to the Virus theme was there were a
fair number of us out there who actually gave a damn about what happened in
the rebellion.  I\'m fairly sure most people would have been fairly pissed
had they received a book of nothing but rules that contained the following
disclaimer at the back.

"By the way you\'ll notice that this book tells you nothing about the end
results of the Rebellion.  Why?  Now don\'t get pissy on us but we\'ve learned
a thing or two from FASA and we\'ve decided to publish fifteen more source
books about the rebellion, gouging the money from your pockets and still
never reveal what happened.  See you in two weeks when the next book comes
out sucker."

By including a section on virus and the new era in the rule book it allowed
those of us who gave a damn to find out what happened to the universe.  By
publishing stuff on virus it gave us insight into the mind of the creature
that finished off what a string of wannabe emperors were incapable of.
Virus was an integral part of the Traveller universe in 1201 and if you
didn\'t like it a little elbow grease and some dice allowed you to create a
universe of your own.

Ok I\'ll give you the typo\'s part.  GDW was terrible at catching it\'s own
mistakes.  However unlike most compainies they cared enough about their
public to publish errata as opposed to just leaving it in there and waiting
for a second and third printing.  Considering the volume of material
produced.  TNE weighs in at a hefty 300+ pages of some fairly wieghty
technical gear.  Plus much of the errata created for TNE was a direct result
of people nit picking the design sequences in FF&S.  Its not like we didn\'t
make our own erratta there.

        I\'m not sure how *reducing* the amount of energy to reach a certain
speed takes the kinetic energy weapon away ... if you cut the energy to
reach speed A from Energy to 0.25Energy, that just means that if I still
spend Energy I now get up to 2*A! So the ship becomes an even *more*
powerful weapon.

        Originally (in FF&S), because the new maneuver drives required much
more fuel, so the jump drive fuel was scaled way down. Since thruster plates
are back, the jump fuel probably will go back up.

        I still think even basic designers will want some flexibility in
deciding how the accommodations should be arranged -- who gets single
stateroom, who gets double. Plus, the crew listed in the tables is the
*base* non-automated crew. Depending on TL the crew requirements go way
down, and it\'s easiest if you collect them all and do it all at once.

        Thanks for the inputs!

strong roleplaying to strong military campaigning, but I think perhaps the
split should be more like 60/40 rather than 70/30 (civilian-military).

Traveller characters are not meant ot represent a cross section of
Imperial society.  They are the bold, the adventuresome, the cream of the

Scouts in there) than to civilan professions.

Just my 2 cents.

I was wondering if you noticed this.  Weren\'t the Vargr coreward of the Imperium, and the Aslan 
rimward-spinward?  I was just wondering.  You certainly have the right as the creator to change it.

According to "logic," both FTL travel _and_ FTL communications should be
impossible.  Marc is limiting suspension-of-disbelief problems by only
invoking one -- aside from the fact that communication limited to speed
of travel causes fascinating social ramifications and provides a good
justification for the classic-space-opera Empire motif.

As to why Traveller doesn\'t use "warp drive"?  Aside from the technical
quibbles of then having to explain edge effects at the bubble boundary,
dealing with the difficulties of FTL combat using c-speed sensor info
(or having to invoke yet _another_ bugaboo to allow FTL detection!), well...

It\'s because Traveller isn\'t Star Trek, but a different and completely 
separate universe with its own set of assumptions.  Go play Prime Directive
if that\'s what you want.

(Reminds me of the guy who wrote JMS to complain that the back-of-hand links
on Babylon-5 were ridiculous, given that everyone _knew_ we were moving
towards breast-mounted (ST:TNG-style) communicators instead....)

That would be the Alcubierre (sp?) drive.  There\'s a web page somewhere with 
some more details (I may even have it on my hotlist).  But it requires some
fairly grotesque space-warping capabilities that would probably also allow
dandy weapons: I\'d rather leave it to Grandfather and his ilk than the common

I agree in principle here.  Given anit- (or contra-) grav, some kind of
reactionless thruster seems inevitable from a game-logical standpoint. 
Arguing physics of reactionless drives is pointless given J-drive exists.
>From a play PoV, 1 and 2, above, are the biggest reasons for T-plates.  

Since I don\'t own FF&S, I\'m not intimately familiar with the operating
principle of HEPLaR.  It sounds like it\'s just a complicated
fusion-powered ramjet which uses the helium waste from the reactor for
reaction mass in space and plasma-heated air in atmosphere.  Why on
Sylea can\'t fusion rockets (which admittedly would make good plasma guns
at short range, see HG v1) have auxiliary intakes for use in atmosphere
to dilute the exhaust temperature and velocity?  A hybrid system like
this would have the advantages of Fusion Rockets in space and HEPLaR in
atmosphere.  The fuel consumption of fusion rockets is low enough to be
able to carry weeks of fuel.

I agree with you for the most part.  Ex-military, merchie, and scouts 
are going to be predominant.

However, there are a few civilian occupations which would be just as 
likely to adventure, and should therefore be candidates for advanced 
treatment.  

The new Researcher that Marc Miller has alluded to strikes me as a 
natural for this type of treatment.

Scientist (lots of these types are going to Travel for conventions, 
research, etc).
Diplomat 
Pirate 
Belter
Let\'s face it Pirates and Belters are going to travel at least as 
much as ex-military types.  In fact, probably more than veterans of 
the army, in many cases.

1 more thought.
Just because a particular career type isn\'t likely to be a Traveller, 
doesn\'t mean that they aren\'t going to develop just as many skills 
over the course of a lifetime as a Merchant Captain.  It just means 
that they will be different types of skills (and perhaps less useful 
to the game).  Advanced character generation should be offered as 
an option for all character types, if for no other reason than to 
really flesh out a critical NPC or Patron.

either might consider the Quantum Zero-Point Drive, which is (I think)
described in "The Songs of Distant Earth" (Arthur Clarke).

SOME PHYSICS...

The vacuum isn\'t empty - it contains both electromagnetic and gravitational
fields.  According to the quantum electrodynamics it isn\'t possible to get
rid of an electromagnetic field completely.  The argument is as follows: if
the electromagnetic energy density at a position X is zero, then the field
strength there is known exactly - its zero.  However, according to the
Principle of Uncertainty it isn\'t meaningful to talk about a field having an
exact value, zero or otherwise, and therefore even in the absence of any
source for the electromagnetic field, the field exists: it arises
spontaneously in accordance with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

This means the vacuum is seething with energy.  Unfortunately, we can\'t get
at it.  The quanta of energy that spontaneously arise (zero-point energy)
can only exist for a short period of time without violating the same
Uncertainty Principle, typically 10E-24 seconds.

SOME SCI-FI...

However, imagine we COULD get at this energy.  We would then have a
limitless supply of power without needing any fuel at all.  I suppose this
energy could be used for propulsion or high tech power sources...


Off the top of my head I can\'t think of any pseudo-scientific explanation
for how this zero-point energy might be converted into thrust other than by
heating some reaction mass, but I thought I\'d throw it into the
HEPlaR/Plates discussion because it does provide a (loose) scientific basis
for a high-tech drive and it seems to me that GM\'s dislike HEPlaR because
its too grubby and low-tech and dislike thrusters because they\'re silly (tin
hat on! :-)).

I haven\'t done anything with this idea: it just occured to me as I was
reading this morning\'s digest.  Perhaps someone would like to take it and
run with it...

Not to take away the fun of the Starship Design Debate, but anybody had any
wishes of what the first adventures to be published will be like?

Personally, I\'d like to see a few "mysteries of the deep" adventures like
Twilight\'s Peak and Secre of the Ancients (Classic Traveller). Not
necessarily involving the Ancients, but sector-spanning adventures that take
you to several locales, while searching for clues to a greater mystery (since
we are coming out of the Long Night, maybe locating old technology, mapping
old colonies/bases, etc. could be the "push" here). Plenty of room for lots
of red herrings here!

Love them red herrings!

Another adventure I\'d like to see would be of a more limited scope. A
commercial-oriented adventure, where Traders are involved in setting up a
merchant company. This adventure would be (I think) suited for solitaire as
well as group play. Give lots of details on finance, stock markets and the
like--how the arrival of a rival ahead of you ruins the worth of your cargo.
It\'s a bare bones idea right now, but there might be something here (or I\'ve
been working in the finance industry--yech--too long!).

Finally, I\'d like to see Trillion Credit Squadron. Well, since it\'s an
earlier time, maybe we can call it Billion Credit Squadron. TCS accomplished
a lot of stuff that Battle Rider and others did--but with a lot less chrome.
I still have fond memories of designing ships with HG, outfitting a fleet,
and battling it out by plotting on graph paper with pencils and **big**
erasers! The campaign outlined in TCS would work, with some alterations. Just
have the lost colony get moved closer to where the Imperium is emerging from
the Long Night, change some tech levels, and there you go!

This is all that needs to be said.  Actually, I thought they did a 
better job of it with TNE than MT.  MT was a total disaster.  The 1st 
edition as it was printed, should have never even been submitted to 
the publisher, let alone be printed and released.  They wised up on 
that with TNE, which at least didn\'t have gaping holes in character 
generation and craft design a la MT.

I think that TNE did weigh down the book a bit with their publishing

clutter things, making it a bit harder to read, and undoubtedly 
accounting for at least part of those pages.  Overall, it was well 
written.  I just didn\'t like GDW\'s house rules system all that much...

I gotta agree.  I think FTL communications would probably create a 
much more homogenous culture.  The fact that a charismatic 
dictatorship can be a bare parsec away from a thriving democracy is 1 
of the hooks that captured me.

I wouldn\'t want it to be Star Trek.  If you really think about the 
series, culture within the Federation itself isn\'t really all that 
interesting.  Think about how few Star Trek episodes actually focus 
on events within the Federation...  Most of the stuff is definitely 
frontier.

Nice compromise.  I think that the TL12 minimum gives the early

The point is that there are alot of science fiction choices about how 
a civilization can exist across interstellar space. 

Why have the choices been made for Traveller such that the Traveller empire
is analogous to one of the pre 18th century empires, rather than a far
future one ?

That is precisely the problem with the previously "official" version
of thruster plates--they gave you free kinetic energy. "Realistic"
reaction drives don\'t solve the problem, since you still have ships
travelling at very high speeds and now every ship has a very powerful
fusion gun in back.

The problem is that you want ships to be capable of high acceleration
and speeds. This is the only way to make maneuver drives a feasible
alternative for in-system travel, among other things.

The solution is to state that these very fast-moving ships really
don\'t have the tremendous amounts of kinetic energy that they should
have. Suppose a maneuver drive also included a field generator that
affected the "apparent mass" of the ship. With the generator on, you
can accelerate quickly and to very high speeds. Turn the generator
off, and the ship drops down to a much lower speed (thrusters only?).

I realize there are some issues to be resolved if you want a more
thorough explanation, but they are not insurmountable. The biggest
issue probably is how the theory of relativity plays in. Possible
answers:
 o it doesn\'t (it\'s a "magic" type of field anyway)--the effects of
   relativity are as if the field were off
 o this results in extra energy being expended/lost (a cost to run
   the M-drive, especially at high speeds/accelerations)
 o this limits your maximum attainable speed (say, to below 0.1c)
   and puts stress on the ship/drives

Because that is not the way the Traveller universe works. With jumps
taking a week at a time and no faster method of communication, the
universe is more diverse and generally a more exciting place to be.
You could invent such things, but they would change the nature of the
campaign.

Yes, and given that there is *no* FTL travel in real life (yet?), a choice
had to be made.

Ever hear the phrase "history repeats itself"?  Who is any of us to say
how a "far future" setting *should* be.  The design choices made in
Traveller leave open many many adventure options.  Slow communication
speeds means that characters who are (falsely I am sure!) accused of some
crime can keep one step ahead of the law.  Slow travel times makes
outthinkng your opponent all the more important in large naval campaigs.

Like I said, a choice had to be made, and the choices that went into
Traveller have alot to do with the amazing diversity of game play that can
be had from it.

The text summarises some well known facts and it sounds good.

>TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCE PROVIDES A FOUNDATION

We also see the reappearance of reactionless maneuver drives, fine. Will
Gravitiy manipulation also be used to build something like force screens?
The other missing answer is on the role of computer technology. What is its
technological and sociological importance? Will computers stay as slow, big,
monolithic calculation engines of the seventies or will they reappear as
more up to date multi-purpose tools? What\'s about robots or AIs?

>SOCIAL SCIENCE ADDS CHARACTER AND FLAVOR

The position of robots in society has also important effects on sociology. I
hope the beginning Imperium is more pro-robot (as for example the society
shown by the star wars movies where (the non-intelligent) robots where just
another tool very common for all people and in contrast to the post-virus
TNE society that feared everything more complicated than a pocket watch). On
the cosmopolitan universe: My view of the Imperium was always tolerance,
tolerance up to indifference about all kind of governments. Keep it so! But
don\'t see capitalism as the only working form of society. They Imperium
might follow this ideology (because it works so well :-) but there should
always be exceptions.

>ADVENTURE!
>[...] combat, travel, tasks. 

I strongly hope, Traveller isn\'t a combat centric game. IMHO MT and TNE lost
much because their orientation toward military missions. Something like

...travel, exploration, combat, negoation and all kinds of task.

as adventure concept I would like much better!

>HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE

>[...] Ziru Sirka, with 40,000 worlds.

Huh, the number I remebered (and was used in TNE) was about 11.000 worlds.
Has the empire grown or do they now count different? TNE shown sligthly
different dates (4518 instead of 4521 for example) but that seems
unimportant. Interestingly, this text didn\'t mention the virus, perhaps... :-)

>THERE\'S MORE!

I like this summary of Traveller, mainly because I always liked the overall
setting and had most problems only with rules and given technology (mainly
the design systems) and the main emphasis of (MT and) TNE to military
adventures (starting with rules like TNE that ease combat up to the whole
concept of the RC which was \'if another world is too weak to protect their
wealth one could go and take it)\'.

One point, that came to my mind is the world design. Will it be the same
system as used since the beginning (for the snake of backward
compartibility) or something better. Rolling up some worlds is fun (and more
than inventing vehicles IMHO) but the current system gives some very strange
results because population is independ of all other values. It\'s also
strange that each system always has exactly one mainworld.

So thrustes don\'t change the momentum of the ship.  When you turn off
the drive, you stop moving?

I\'m sad to see the Virus still included (yuck) but given that that era
will only be one of many I can live with it.  More info on the Zhodani
Core Expiditions and similar exotic times sounds great.  "The Heat Death
of the Universe."??? Well, that\'s certainly not my first choice for a RPG

My main point is that a solution is needed for consistency in the
universe, a place in which many people have starships but planets
are not regularly being destroyed, orbiting space stations are
common, etc.

However, the concept I had in mind was more along the lines of this:

The "zeta field" (or whatever) allows you to achieve higher speeds by
changing your "apparent mass". A maneuver drive also has thrusters,
which would change your momentum (and kinetic energy) whether or not
the field is active. However, your "speed" would be higher if the
field is on. Fusion rockets could still exist, but would be at quite
a disadvantage and likely considered a threat to shipping lanes,
planets, etc. Note that the "zeta field" does not need be compatible
with fusion rockets, so you don\'t automatically get a supership by
strapping one onto an old fusion "torch-ship".

This explanation should be good enough for most people, I think.
There are certainly some issues with relativity (which also affects
"apparent mass") as well as whether (and how) to preserve momentum,
kinetic energy, or both when you turn the field on/off, but these
are not insurmountable problems.

you missed my point.  I said the reason CT was such a big hit (in it\'s time)
was because there was a clear line between the rules and the background.
Even the Traveller Book (IMHO the best release of the rules to date)
background matterial was only listed in the back, as an exmple.  If you
cared about the rebellion and the virus than fine, you buy another source
book detailing that.  And as for \'gouging money from your pockets\'  I\'ve got
news for you.  The purpose of a game company is to make money!  (Surprise!)
Not to inform you about some fantasy background.  I am only saying that
including this background in with the rule book is the reason the company
was unable to profit from the game.

My case in point!  And as for a hefty 300+ pages of technical gear, just how
many pictures of tanks do we realy need!

There were errors in TNE that were also in MT, even after the errata sheets
were released!  GDW thought they could make more money by selling pictures
of weapons than by putting out a meaningful, playible game system.

Those would be fun.  There\'s a _lot_ of adventure possible in (re)contacting old
colonies: I\'ve just been reading Stableford\'s *Daedalus* series (*The Florians*,
*Critical Threshold*, *Wildeblood\'s Empire*, *The City of the Sun*, *Balance
of Power* and, soon, *The Paradox of the Sets*) and all (so far) would make
excellent Traveller adventures of exploration, diplomacy, and discovery.

Or you could, for example, discover a set of old worked-out mines, dating from
after the Ziru Sirkaa.  Well, those resources aren\'t available _here_, then,
but they must have been taken elsewhere.  Who dug the mines?  Where did they
go?  Are they still technological and spacefaring, or have they fallen back
to barbarism?

Are there still Vilani holdouts with ancient legends about the arrogant invaders
from beyond the stars (Solomani from the Rule of Man)?  Would they welcome fresh
contact?

We never hear about whether the Sylean Federation just happened to be the only
other viable interstellar government expanding at the same time... could there
have been another state in conflict with them, now ousted out of the history
books after their eventual utter destruction?

Way back when Marc Miller was soliciting ideas for the new Traveller product
line, I mentioned that a series of Adventure books, on different themes for
adventures/campaigns (how-to, new rules and gear, plot hooks and a few actual
adventures) might be good for bringing in new players and expanding the horizons
of older ones.  I think I included Exploration Adventures (scouts and recontact),
Military Adventures (characters as still-active-duty), Commercial Adventures
(what you\'ve described above), perhaps others.  I\'ll have to dig out my notes....

As for the future of the published universe... is the vague "Survey" map for
Milieu 0 (in which information becomes sketchier further and further from Sylea)
going to remain the basis for the whole historical line?  Or are we going to
find more areas detailed as new Milieus arrive -- Reavers\' Deep for the Aslan
Border Wars, the Spinward Marches (obviously) for the Frontier Wars, Solomani
Rim for the Interstellar Wars, Vland for the Ziru Sirkaa, Ilelish for the
Suerrat Revolt, Antares for the Julian War, etc. etc. etc.?  If so, I fear
we\'ll encounter D&D-like trouble wherein individual referees feel cramped
when new products detail their already-developed campaign settings.

  Archives.

  However, I need the jargon to compile, and not just the stuff
  that I make up out of my own head, or that my former gaming group
  used when we played.  I need yours, too.  And yes, that includes
  you all the way in the back waving your hand at me.  Oh, you want
  to know what I mean by jargon?

  That\'s easy.  It\'s the "slang" that\'s not part of standard
  Galanglic as it appears in your particular incarnation of
  Traveller\'s reality (IOTR), and that your players\' characters are
  likely to encounter in the course of adventures.  Shipboard
  slang, ground slang, military slang, all of that is good and
  useful.

  Examples?  Sure - just a few off the top of my head:  In my IOTR,
  a good ship\'s cook is called a "gil", a "gilly", or occasionally
  a "shu-li", all deriving from the old Vilani "shugili", the guy
  who knew the techniques for making edible the inedible plant life
  on Vland.  A "cork" is a nuclear damper, when used to disrupt or
  terminate the output of a power plant that relies on nuclear
  reactions for power production (fission or fusion, hot or cold),
  and using "cork" as a verb is what a "cork" used as a noun does.
  The guy in your crew who always seems to have a knack for
  managing protocol is a "newt", because before it became
  politically correct to call \'em "Bwabs" or "Bwaps", that\'s what
  members of that race were called - and everyone knows that they
  handled protocol like nobody\'s business.  Stuff like that.

  What I\'d like for each entry is the word itself, the part of
  speech, the definition, and the origin, if known.  Set it up like
  it might be in a dictionary.  Don\'t worry about the same word
  having multiple, even contradictory, definitions, or two
  different words having the same definition - after all, "fat
  chance" and "slim chance" mean the same thing, don\'t they?

  Example:

  gil (n) [from Old Vilani "shugili", a food preparer/witch
  doctor/shaman]  (1) A cook, usually one who can create high
  quality meals out of poorer-quality materials

  If you don\'t want to waste space piecemeal here, post to me at
  jeff.zeitlin@execnet.com.  I\'ll whip it all into shape, and put
  it up in the RICE Archives, and post it here all together.

I sincerely hope that they detail very little, as I have fleshed out quite
a bit and even changed some of the maps.  Of course, it doesn\'t really
matter what they publish in the end, I\'ll end up using what I am my
players like and shelving the rest.  Much of what it sounds like MMT is
going to be like is already in my house rules, so it should be pretty
smooth.

then that is not really a problem.  However, much of the knowledge I have is
very specialized, and in most games rolled up into 1-3 skills, Computer, or
Computer Operations, Computer Programming, and Computer Build/Repair.

Now in a basic system, I could generate a basic character with a Computer 6
that would kick butt.  he could hack, repair, write, program, etc.  In an
advanced system, this same character might have 2-3 times as many skills.
Most of them would be, however, duplicates of the basic Computer Skill.  So
now I purchase a Programming Languages skill (to let me know if I can
decipher the code written by another programmer in a Language I don\'t know),
A Computer Operations skill (to simulate using software written by others),
a Computer Ettiqutte skill, a Networkig skill, a Communications skill, etc
ad nauseum.

In military terms the same things apply.  If I create a Merc charcater, just
how useful is his Heavy Weapons 4 skill when he is tailing someone?  Every
skill in traveller could be subskilled out to a great degree.  I mean think
of what you could use Streetwise for.  

I would love to see advanced char gen for other occupations.  I once
generated a rather detailed Fighter Pilot generation system for CT/MT.  It
was very Book 5 like with special assignments, etc.  It was chock full of
useful skills (for a fighter pilot) Heavy Figter Pilot, Medium Fighter
Pilot, Small Fighter Pilot, Fighter Tactics, Squadron Communiations,
Carousing, etc.  It was also quite leathal as I remember.  Survival rolls
were often above 7.  I test generated about 50 characters both enlisted and
officer and generated about 12 new types of fighters and fighter weapons. (A
ECM fighter for jamming, a Torpedo bomber complete with 5 ton missle,
atmospheric fighters, etc.)  It added a lot to our play, even though almost
every character generated with it didn\'t get a chance to fly a fighter in a
space battle.  

Were these characters BETTER then the others.  No, they were more detailed
about one aspect of their natures, but they were weak in other areas.  The
Fighter pilot just wasn\'t very good at finding cargo, or making deals with
Vargr, etc.  The saem could be said for Scientists, is it better to have
Science 5 , or Aquatic Biology 2, Volcanic Geology 1, etc.

it does have some chance of success.

I think Traveller is the best choice because it has always been for Traveller
regardless of era or rules set.  CT and MT posts have always been welcome. 
The only rule was no TNE on Xboat.  I was waiting to see what the game was
going to look like before I tried to urge a direction (which I didn\'t want to
do).  Thanks for taking the time to keep us informed!!!

Agent...whoo hoo!  One of my favorite alternative character types (as 
evidenced by my home-grown advanced generation system for them :).  

The skills list looks excellent.  I just have one suggestion:  I found it 
convenient to create a new skill called Concealment for the Agent 
character, so that they could hide items about their body with some 
skill.  Sure, it\'s better to role-play that out, but such can be said of 
many (if not all) skills on the list.

Thank you for posting this information!

Whew!  What a document.  Add a bit at the bottom describing products to 
be produced, and you\'d have yourself a heck of a whiz-bang marketing 
tool, methinks.  Something along the lines of the old "Understanding 
Traveller" pamphlet, with this as its foundation.  Splash sheets and 
posters will get attention - a document like this will /keep it/.

I assume you aren\'t asking for proofreading (ie, for typographical 
errors, etc.)  Rather, I assume you have posted this draft version for 
our benefit and for comment on the subtance, not form.  Given that, I 
have nothing but praise for the work.

Once again, thank you for sharing with us!

        Given that Warp Drive, Jump Drive and FTL communications are all
technical balderdash anyway, no, there\'s no _technical_ reason possible.
However, there is a very logical reason: that\'s the way the game is written.

        As in any form of SF (game or book), you make certain assumptions or
decisions up front, as a basis for an internally self-consistent universe.
Why doesn\'t Babylon 5 use Warp Drives? Same reason. Why did Larry Niven and
Jerry Pournelle use Alderson tramlines in "Mote in God\'s Eye?" Same reason.

        Don\'t like it? Change it in your game.

You\'re right.  As in any scholarly study of a body of work, critical
thinking and cross-analysis are crucially important to understanding.

I would say primary sources, or recognized sources, or at least very good
places to begin learning.

Yes, these are all important sources, too.  I\'m glad you pointed them out.

Some 15 years ago, I developed advanced character generation for police,
lawyers, artists, and academics.  The only thing I remember about them were
that if your academic character were ever promoted to the administration, he
or she lost one level of instruction skill per year as an administrator.

I\'m with both of you.  All career paths presented should have advanced
character generation.  

The original Book 1/Book 4 basic character generation was kept simple to
allow new players (which was everyone in 1977) to jump in and play.  I
remember rolling up lots of characters at first, because it was so different
than, e.g., D&D (before the "A"), and felt so much more thorough.  Having
lived to the age at which many characters muster out, I see that I and
everyone I know have many more skills in real life than we would have had we
been on the basic character generation track in our lives.

You like what you like, but I like the year-by-year progression, and I use
it as the framework around which the character\'s biography is built.  When I
generate a character, I first go through the advanced character generation
process.  At the end, I know the character\'s age, so I can put him into
historical context.  Then I work forward.

    'body' => 'Hello all,

I finished tabulating the results of the design poll.  Rather than clog 
the mailing list with a million lines of statistical analysis, I would prefer 
to send the information to you individually.  E-Mail me if you want the 
full blown report.  Here are a few general conclusions, to whet your 
appetite (or make you feel grateful I didn\'t post it to the list, depending 
on your point of view).

There were 62 total responses.  The most popular design system 
for starships was FF&S, although it was preferred overall by only 35% 
of total users.  Of those users familiar with the CT & MT systems as 
well as FF&S, that percentage rose to 52%, still only a slim majority 
of total players.  MT was a distant second with about 25%, with High 
Guard at about 20%.  Virtually nobody wants something as simplistic 
as book 2.

Of those players who were not familiar with all 4 systems, the 
majority owned MT & CT, but never bought FF&S.   GDW had a good idea 
in FF&S though, as several players who do not use the TNE background 
still use FF&S as a design system (and presumably TNE rules for 
vehicular/ship  combat.  

Vehicles: 
There was nothing approaching  a consensus on what system was preferred 
for craft design.  Several people who liked FF&S as a ship design 
system expressed a dislike for FF&S as a vehicle design system, and 
many of those expressed a preference for MT.

The breakdown between MT, Striker, & FF&S was as follows:

FF&S: approx. 30%
MT: approx 25%
Striker approx 20%
N/A approx 25%

There was no significant difference in percentage for those who were 
familiar with all 3 systems.  Ironically enough, about 1/4 of the people 
who responded to the poll said that they\'d never used any of the three 
systems to design a vehicle of any type.  Clearly, a Sears catalog of vehicle 
types would satisfy a lot of these people.  An FF&S lite may not be as 
necessary for vehicles as ships.

General Conclusions:
Just about everybody wanted some complexity to ship design.  Book 2 
was familiar to all but 7 of the 62 respondents, and yet only 3 of 
them expressed any desire to still use the system.  FF&S was a 
favorite of the more complex 3 (MT, HG & FF&S), but not by much 
of a margin.  When compared by those who\'d owned all 4 systems, 
FF&S was a majority favorite, but not overwhelmingly so.  A 2 tiered 
approach such as that espoused by Don & Dave would appear to be 
the way to go.  Clearly, there is a market for something as complex as 
FF&S, but it is equally clear that GDW made a mistake when they did 
not release a less complex ship/vehicle design system for those unwilling 
to tackle FF&S.

As far as vehicle design, results are less clear.  FF&S is still a 
favorite, but frankly, there were a number of advocates for MT & 
Striker as well.  FF&S would probably be the way to go, but it may 
need to be tweaked, refined or overhauled to satisfy a number of the 
complaints I heard about it.

My unsolicited and perhaps unneeded advice to IG:

Use a 2 tiered approach for ship design &.  There are a number of 
"gearheads" who love the detail and complexity of FF&S, but there is 
a nearly equal number who still want a certain level of detail, 
without getting into overwhelming complexity.  A Medium Complexity/High 
Complexity step is probably the way to go.

Finally, whatever system winds up going into the ship design rules, 
it is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL, that these rules be carefully proofread 
and laid out in a logical fashion.  Judging by the responses given to 
the unworkable parts of MT & FF&S, as they were prior to the errata 
fixes, this really hurt GDW.  The number of comments like:  "I tried 
to design a ship using XXX 1st edition, got halfway through and gave 
up, because the rules were poorly written..." comments that I got 
were unbelievable.  It is my opinion that the poorly edited ship 
design and combat rules killed MT they consumed most of the errata 
(other than the Merchant Advanced Character Gen system)..., and they 
turned a few people off from FF&S as well.  In GDW\'s defense, they 
did do a good job of making these 2 systems workable with the error 
corrections, but they lost a lot of people by not releasing a 
finished product to begin with.

Believe it or not, that is a synopsis of the conclusions and data in 
the report.  For the full report, e-mail me at the address below.

I\'d appreciate it if you continued to post to xboat. I don\'t subscribe to
Traveller (and don\'t want to because my mailbox is full enough with just
the xboat list!), but I for one would still like to stay updated.

Thanks!

I hope there are plans at some point in the future to create other 
character classes as a supplement, in JTAS, or something...  I kind 
of miss the Pirate & Belter classes.  I suppose Scholar could replace 
Scientist (another of my faves).

>

I like the inclusion of more scientific disciplines.

> Archery*
> Armorer

Not sure I like giving characters the ability to build their own 
armor...sounds like a heap o\' trouble to me.  I\'ve run many an 
adventure where Merc type characters have been looking for a source 
to buy battle dress.  Now all they need to do is find the materials...

> Fast Talk*

What the heck is Fast Talk?  Is this the ability to be an auctioneer. 
 Or the ability to talk somebody into (or out of) something they 
really wouldn\'t do under most circumstances?

> First Aid* (very high levels become EMT)

Overall, I gotta agree with other peoples assessment on this 1.  I don\'t see a 
need for this, when most of the skills are duplicated by Medic-1 & 2. 

I suppose you could give this instead of Medic for military careers.  
A lot of folks would be taught First Aid in the army, not as many 
would actually go through Medical school.

> Performance (Art)
> Performance (Dance)
> Performance (Drama)
> Performance (Music)
> Performance (Writing)

Obvious choices for the Performer character.  I think the Performer 
type is tough to justify as a basic character class though.  I can\'t 
see too many people in Traveller playing this as a PC.  Hard to get 
excited about having rolled up a character with Performance (Dance)-4 
skill, when your neighbor is a Battle Dress-3, or Broker-2.  Would be a 
good type for a \'Citizens\' supplement though, and I can see some great 
ideas for NPC\'s & patrons.

Great idea in a pre-Psionic Suppressions Imperium

I like the inclusion of a larger number of Default skills.

Very nice ideas, Marc.  Thanks for posting them.

Doesn\'t people from university go for adventure? What\'s about Scientists,
Engineers or Doctors? Or should Scholar be a collective category for them?
But why didn\'t you then also summarize Army, Navy and Marine to (for
example) Soldier?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I think the idea here is that military types are more likely to 
adventure, so they can be differentiated more.  Also, in terms of 
designing character generation systems, it\'s easier to group scholarly 
disciplines than military ones (in my experience, which is fairly extensive).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Consolidated Skill List (* indicates Default Skills [see below])

To justify my following critics I\'d like to say that if I\'ve made no
comment, I agree with that skill. The game should have about 50-60 skills,
but not more. Perhaps you should drop one or two skills to lower the number.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

To me, the number of skill is unimportant.  There can be hundreds for all 
I care.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Archery*

The use of archaic missle or throwing weapons a default skill? I don\'t think
so.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I agree with this comment.  Someone who\'s never been trained to use a bow 
should definately get the -5 DM for unskilled use when using one (or 
whatever MMT\'s replacement will be for this).  This is also true of 
several other skills listed as "default".  I would suggest looking this 
over again.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Armorer

Building armor on your own? I would drop this skill in favor of some more
important skil.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This is an extremely important skill for primitive types, so I would not 
drop it.  However, I would subsume it into craftsman (see below).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Craftsman

What does a craftsman craft? A baker? a bricklayer? A goldsmith? I would
drop it.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I would not drop it, but make it a cascade skill with specializations 
allowed.  This again is important for primitives (usually NPCs, but they 
gotta have skills too).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Environment Combat*

I\'d count special training to the corresponding weapon skill and drop this.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I think this should be a cascade skill too.  Including such things as ZG 
and Hi-G combat.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Equestrian*

Does this skill also include normal riding (for me, it\'s a somewhat unusual
term I had to look up)? Why not call it simple Riding?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Because "Riding" is not the correct term.  Anyone can ride on something 
being controlled by another.  Equestrian is the skill of controlling a horse.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Fencing

A special skill? Why not included in Blade weapon?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I think you may be confused here (or I may be also :-), but I think this 
is referring to the skill of putting stolen goods out on the blackmarket 
(also called fencing).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Forward Observer

I never understand what\'s the roleplaying use of that skill. As a general
rule, I would try to distinguish between occupation (or role) skills and
activity skills (more general). To be a forward observer is an occupation
(IMHO) but to be that, you have to be trained in communication, stealth and
to keep cool.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

FO is the skill of calling in artillery fire or orbital artillery fire. 
You seem to think it is the skill of "scouting" or something, which has
been covered in CT/MT as Recon.  If you\'ve ever watched a movie about Viet
Nam, they\'re always calling in strikes from aircraft and artillery.  That
is what FO is for.  I agree with someone else\'s comment that this would be
a TL 5-9 skill, after which it would become rare (though it\'s always nice
to be able to go manual when your fancy electronic FO computer breaks
down). 


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Gunnery
>Heavy Weapons*
What\'s the difference between these two skills? Isn\'t a cannon a heavy 
weapon?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Gunnery is for space combat, and refers to use of turreted lasers and 
plasma weapons.  Heavy Weapons are things like squad support weapons 
(MG\'s, LAW rockets, etc.), and are generally portable or semi-portable.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Jack of All Trades

I would drop this skill because experience with old Traveller has show that
this \'Mac Guyver\'-like skill causes lot\'s of problems because it\'s too
advantagerous.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I love this skill!  Please don\'t drop it, but _do_ clearly delineate how 
it is to be used.  I\'ve always made it that a character with JOT can 
"expand" his skills into related areas.  e.g., you have mechanics-3 and 
jot-1, you can handle electronics-0.  If you have jot-2, I\'ll let you get 
away with engineering-0 and computers-0.  And so on.  In Shadowrun, they 
have a "skill web" and I\'ve always meant to make one for Trav.  It would 
formalize the system I outlined above.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Melee (Armed)*

That\'s the difference to blade weapon? (What I\'d like to say: think about
building more general skills where blade weapons are a special case)
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I agree with this.  Isn\'t this brawling and/or blade?  Perhaps blade 
should be dropped and Melee be the replacement, including clubs and 
hammers and such things which are not "blades".


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Performance (Art)
>Performance (Dance)
>Performance (Drama)
>Performance (Music)
>Performance (Writing)

Nice, but very unimportant for roleplaying in the Traveller millieu, IMHO.
Drop.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Sorry, Stefan, but I completely disagree with you here.  They may not 
have been important in your games, but I\'ve had to invent them myself for 
my campaigns.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Philosophy*

Again. That\'s roleplaying but no player can stat \'my character has just
created a new meanful philosophic statement because I rolled successfully
against philosophy. GM, think about something like "I know that I know
nothing"\'
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This is simply meant to imply that the character has knowledge about 
philosophy and can write and comprehend papers on the topic.  Try reading 
a high-level philosophy paper (or even a mid-level one) and tell me then 
that this isn\'t a skill.  You could just as easily say that any academic 
discipline should not be given a skill (e.g. history, political science, 
etc.).  All of these are areas of knowledge, and make useful skills.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Psionicology (an academic endeavor)

Oh, that\'s a real improvement. Good.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Yup, I like this too.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Research*

Can you research something independ from a scientific discipline? As far as
I know, no German university teach general research but you only learn
researching together with all other knowledge of the specific discipline.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

You can research something independent of a discipline.  Many Canadian 
univesities have degrees in "Information Sciences" that relate directly 
to this skill.  It is the ability to search and organize information 
meaningfully.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Surface Vehicle*

Including boats that swim on the water\'s surface? :-) (What\'s about Ground
vehicle?)
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This should definately be a cascade skill.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Btw, will the basic rules book also cover alien races? Does they have
special skills which have to be considered?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I don\'t think it should cover alien races.  I would like to see (as much
as possible) the rules be relatively free from the background so that
people can use it for non-Imperium non-Standard sorts of campaigns. 
Alien skills will presumably be covered in Alien Archives.

But thats not the purpose of the list.  If we are going to cross post everything, then there should only be one list.  There is a large amount of mail right now, and you have to read the messages 2 or 3 times.  

Secondly, TNE discussions have dropped to a minimal level, with most all discussion being T4 related on Traveller.  So let the Traveller list be what its for, discussing the current version of Traveller, which in this case is T4.

If you are on Xboat, not on Traveller, simply mail a message to:

    traveller-request@mpgn.com   (or traveller-digest-request@mpgn.com)

and in the body say:

     subscribe traveller your@email  (or subscribe traveller-digest your@email)

If everyone on Xboat that is interested in T4 joins traveller, then Xboat will
be for CT/MT only discussions.  I will even create a TNE list if needed. 

I would like to see no more T4 cross posts, and urge the Xboat people to join Traveller.

way of generating "primitive" NPCs and such.  I\'ve heard there will be a

fill that role?

NEW Consolidated Skill List

D indicates default skill, all characters have this at level-0 at the 
GM\'s option ("primitive" characters will not have some of these, but will 
have others that moderns won\'t have).

G indicates grouped skill, from which one "specialty" must be chosen, 
with all other members of the skill group being level-nil (level-0 at 
GM\'s option).

C indicates cascade skill, from which one "specialty" must be chosen, with 
all other members of skill group being at 1/2 level (level-0 if specialty 
is at level-1).


Administration	D
Aircraft 	G	(Copter, Prop, Jet, Lighter-Than-Air)
Archeology (one of many "Majors" for the Scholar character type).
Archery		not default.
	Armorer has been removed and placed with craftman.
Astrogration
Athletics	C	(Choose running, swimming, climbing, or a sport)
Battle Dress
Biology
Blade Weapons	DC	(Choose short blade, long blade, short club, long club)
Brawling 	D
Bribery		not default, you should get a negative DM if untrained.
Broker		not default, you should get a negative DM if untrained.
Camouflage	D
Carousing	D
Chemistry
Commo		D
Computer	D
Craftsman  	G	(Choose from Armorer, Woodworker, Leatherworker, etc.)
Demolitions
Diplomacy	D
Disguise	D
Electronics
Engineering
Enviro Combat	C	(Choose from Lo-g or Hi-g).
Equestrian	not default.  
[perhaps this should simply be placed under vehicle as one of the options.]

Fast Talk	D
Fencing		
[I\'m assuming this refers to the underworld skill, and not blade combat]

Field Artillery
First Aid	D? (very high levels become EMT)
Forensics
Forgery		not default.
Forward Obs.
Gambling
GEOLOGY has been added, and there should be a note that players/GMs may 
make up new majors

Grav Craft	D
Gravitics
Gun Combat	C (pistol D, rifle D, SMG not D, MG not D, etc.)
Gunnery		C (lasers, missiles, etc.)
Heavy Weapons	not default.
History
Instruction	D
Interrogation	D
Intimidation	D
Intrusion	D
Investigation	D
Jack-o-T	
Language 	G (choose from any number of lingos).
Law
Leadership	D?
Linguistics
Mechanics
Medical
	Melee has been removed and is assumed to be under brawling or blade.
Navigation	not default.
Perception	D
Performance	G (choose from painting, music, art, writing, etc.)
Philosophy	not default. pop-philosophy is default.
Physics
Pilot
Psionicology		cool!
Psychology	not default. pop-psychology is default.
Recon		D
Research	D
Robotics
Sensors
Ships Boat
Stealth		D
Steward
Streetwise	not default.
Surface Vehicle	C (choose from, car, motorcylce, AFV, etc.)
Survey
Survival	D
Tactics		C (choose from Land Combat, Space Combat, etc.)
Throwing	D
Trader		D
Vacc Suit	D
Watercraft	D 

Default Skills:  Characters can always try something requiring any skill, 
except where otherwise noted in special cases.  When trying a skill which 
is not default, they get a severe negative DM (or something similar).

   Maybe not a default skill, but many people may have an Archery-0, not

    This should not be a default skill.  Two years of ROTC in college and

    Not sure this should be defaulted either.  Do it poorly, and you stand out

Not a default, except on Low tech worlds.

>First Aid	D? (very high levels become EMT)
Unsure about the Default level or not.  Most people know how to put a bandaid
on and clean simple wounds.  Does this warrent a Medic-0 or First Aid-0.  If this is not combined with Medic, then Medic-1 has to equal First Aid-4 or 
something like that.  A doctor is trained at those things at a higher level
than EMTs.  They should be combined because its a logical progression.
     Medic-0  First Aid
     Medic-1  EMT/Nurse
     Medic-2  Paramedic/Registered Nurse
     Medic-3  Doctor
     Medic-4  Specialist etc.

If you are defaulting things like investigation, interrogation, and such,
this one fits those kinds of skills.  Default it.

>Pilot
I wonder if we really need this.  Most of space travel is either
ships boat (in system), or astrogation (jump).  Pilot seems to have
less and less importance.  You have vehicle-ground, vehicle-sea, vehicle-air,
vehicle-grav, why not vehicle-space.  The only reason to keep it with Astrogation around is for compatiblity.

Not sure about this one being default.

Having just gotten a boat, You need training and practice.  Not everyone is going to know how to operate a boat, where most adults know how to operate a car.  Probably should not default this, unless Hydro>=9.

	I would like to second (third?) the vote for a Belter class.  It
can be part of merchant or something, but I would definately like to see
it included.  This would require some sort of prospecting skill (though I
guess this is just a combo of geology and sensor skills).  I was never so 
hot on the Hunter class.  
	I was also thinking that "Agent" might be expanded into something 
broader like "Security Forces", and include police, spies, private eyes, 
etc.  

Survey skill:  what is this skill for?  I\'m not saying it should be 
dumped, I just want a description of what it\'s good for.

Recon:  same as above.

Liaison skill:  someone said this had something to do with orbital 
artillery.  I\'m pretty certain this was an error. It\'s more of a 
"Diplomacy" skill.

Equestrian:  In retrospect, I think this should be renamed.  It does 
imply horses only (what about Ton-Tons and Tarsus Nobbles?).  Riding is 
not a great substitute, but it would do.  I was thinking that maybe 
"Ground Vehicle" or "Surface Vehicle" could include "riding animal" as an 
option.

	As a more general comment, I like the way MT handled skills.  I 
like the idea of groups of skills, and categories like "Inate" which 
contained streetwise, leader, etc. that you could choose from.  This 
helped in directing character generation.

There seems to be some misconception abouut Armorer. He doesn\'t make armor;
he is a small arms (maybe large arms) repair and maintenance person. The
craftsman down the street here fixes many different things (appliances, etc)
but I would probably not take him my SiG P-228 if its smokestacking (jargon

Atlas was one of the rarer modules. It never had UWPs, although there was
some effort to produce those Sector UWP lists. I expect they are the ones
posted on the GEnie Traveller area.

There was never any formal plan to publish that list as a Module.

This listing is from the proposed Imperium Games publication schedule:

"FIRST SURVEY
This vital companion to Milieu 0 is an atlas of the 50 or so sectors that
were the Vilani Empire and its surrounding territories. The star systems of
the Sylean Federation are well defined. Farther and farther out, systems are
less well-defined. Each adventuring group determines its own survey results
for each system they visit. Lester Smith."

The concept is that this module will show the location of the star systems on
sector maps, but NOT the world data (or even the starport information). If it
has a gas giant, that would be there, as would some clue as to water/fuel
availability.

For limited regions (The Sylean Federation; The Neighborhood Of Vland, Terra)
the module would provide current information. Additional data would refer to
what was in the data banks: data now maybe 1200 to 1700 years old.

Fixing or making custom mods to Battle Dress is included in the BattleDress skill I think.  Today, most every infantryman can take apart his M16 and put it back together again, making repairs and minor upkeep.  Its not un-realistic to expect the Imperial Marines to not do the same training.  Can they fix chunks that are blown away?  Doubtful, but they probably could repair straps and stuff that keeps it put together.

Good point I rarely use the virus in my campaigns. The only place it

Im (still) in the midst of preparing for a new Traveller campaign (Im
leaning towards the Classic setting, but might hold off until the first T4
items come out to see if well switch there). Ive been going through things
that look odd since the original incarnation of Traveller to todays
technology. Of course, one of the biggest glaring differences are in the way
Traveller portrayed computers vs. what we have today (and this difference
is, as we all know, one of the longest sources of debate starting from the
Origins seminars I attended way back when to todays discussions on how T4
will look!).

Ive thought of a few things to present to my players and would like to run
them past you and your collective wisdom.

Reason One for difference: Traveller was written in the mid-1970s. We
werent wired then they way we are now and nobody really thought wed advance
as quickly. So it has a sort of clunky anachronistic charm. I feel
uncomfortable changing the rules because its like picking at a loose thread
on your suit: You might end up unraveling the whole thing.

Reason Two for difference: Most of the ships in the Traveller universe are
built for rough travel. Its a jungle out there: Unfriendly powers, pirates,
troublesome natives. You never know when youre going to run into a storm
while re-fueling around a gas giant, or a bubble in hyperspace. The computers
are built military style--ultra-rough and tough to take a lot of punishment.

Reason Three for difference: Many years ago, humaniti had much better
computers. Heck, they even developed computers that would think for
themselves and had psionic powers! Then some of these telepathic AIs tried
to take things over. That was the start of the Psionic Suppressions--and of
course, as you know, things didnt end there. Thats way today (the Classic
era) we have psionic powers suppressed and computers are clunky--nobody
really trusts either and they only build computers advanced enough to do the
job and no better.

Waiting your counter-battery bursts...

Actually, thinking about it in retrospect, I\'ve done a 180 on my 
opinion on this.  Especially after reading opinions by others.  Just 
like every 20th century soldier is taught how to strip, clean, oil, 
and service his weapon, a 57th century soldier is going to be 
expected to, and need to know how to patch, service, and repair his 
body armor, which would be as integral a part of his equipment as 
the M-16 is to a US soldier today.  Low levels of this skill could be 
for routine maintenance, medium levels could be for repair, high levels for 
actually being able to build the stuff from scratch.  I guess what 
I\'m saying is that I\'d like to see the description for this skill 
before I\'d comment further.  Another way to limit this might be to 
limit the ability to get this skill to the places it would really be 
most necessary: Army & Marines.

I guess I find people complaining about seperating the rules from the 
background kind of amusing.  I run CT with MT rules, and have been 
for years.  I just ignore the sidebars from the rules, and I don\'t 
hand the Imperial Encyclopedia (which is mostly CT stuff anyways) to 
the players...

Yes, there are lots of references to Virus in the TNE rules, but 
there is no rule in the game that says I can\'t play the game with a 
different setting, and if there was, I certainly could ignore it.  On 
the other hand, I don\'t like the TNE rules, so...

But that\'s a story for another time.

Gads--what sugary memories that subject brings back!

Anyway: How do you all handle the passage of time in your campaigns? We have
the standard Imperial Year, Day, Hour, Minute, Second, etc. I presume that
most ships, especially Imperial Military ships follow Imperial time. But what
about smaller ships? Independent ships?

And--does anybody ever use odd days in their campaign. You land on the
planet--the day is 12 standard hours long--or 48?

I\'ve recently come across a few pieces of SF that had interesting treatments
of this idea.

The first is CJ Cherryh\'s "Downbelow Station". Orbiting Pell, a planet around
Tau Ceti, Downbelow Station has taken on Pell\'s day, which is longer (by
nearly twice, if my memory is correct) than that of Earth. To compensate, the
station (and the ground contingent) operate on the "Main Day" and "Alter Day"
schedule--the two together make up one Pell Day.

The second is David Weber\'s "Honor Harrington" series. I\'m slogging through
the first of the series "On Basilisk Station". One thing that was amusing was
the first chapter, where galactic directions are given as North, South, East
and West. Apparently this universe is as flat as the Traveller Universe
(insert big grin and wink here). The "pocket empire" where the action takes
place has a number of differing days and years for each planet in the system.
As a result, computers have a time calculator built in and the author
mentions on more than one occasion the differences between the times of each
planet. For example, one planet has a fairly normal day of hours (60 minutes
each), plus one additional shorter hour to compensate for the
difference--this additional hour being called a "comp".

Kim Stanley Robinson and Philip K. Dick use a similar approach for Mars. P.K.
Dick coined the term "The Martian Time Slip" for the difference between a
Terran day and a Martian day. Robinson follows up on this and has the clocks
of his Martian colony flash "24:00" until the end of the time slip. I recall
that in "The Rolling Stones", Robert A. Heinlein had one of the twin
characters (Castor and Pollux, of course!) leave his watch on Terran time,
the other twin had changed the setting of his watch to match the new day.

Any thoughts?

Only 1 thing about it.  Although it doesn\'t bother me a bit, there 
are a few people of deeper faith who might find bringing 
Religious/Theologian matters into a role-playing game a little 
offensive.  In my games, alien philosophies and religions are at 
times part of the backdrop.  Others may not be quite so open-minded 
on the subject of religion though.

You\'d need to subscribe to GEnie.  The sector data has been reposted

Daniel,

I got to thinking about your reply and I realized that I responded 
a little harshly.  What can I say, I\'m part Irish & Scottish, and 
we\'re not exactly noted for controlling our temper...  :-)

I tried as much as I could to keep my personal opinions out of the 
survey.  I guess I got so angry at you because you made it sound as 
if I had some sort of personal agenda here.  If I did, my personal 
agenda didn\'t work.

Anybody whose read my opinions for very long on this list, 
will realize that they are quite a bit different from what the survey 
bore out.  I don\'t like FF&S.  I don\'t want to spend that long 
designing a ship.  I\'d much rather take that kind of time to detail a 
few critical NPC\'s, a few worlds, or write a few more adventure 
hooks.  My time is too precious to take the time to design a ship 
with FF&S.  I like MT, and may still use it if I don\'t like the less 
complex system that is being worked on as we speak.  It still gives 
me a reasonably detailed ship, and doesn\'t take long to do on a 
spreadsheet.

On the other hand, there are a lot of "gearheads" (I hate that term 
now just about as much as the word  "canon" on this list) who want 
that level of detail, and frankly, some of them present quite 
convincing arguments on why a FF&S style product is necessary.  I 
don\'t agree with them, but they are obviously passionate in what they 
feel, just as you are in your defense of Book 2.  They were also out 
there in much larger numbers than people who leapt to the defense of 
Book 2.

When 58 out of 62 people responding to a survey tell me they\'ve seen 
Book 2, and only 3 of those people say they still want to use it, I 
think my statement that "virtually no one wants to return to a Book 
2 system" is not jumping to conclusions without the data to back it 
up.  I recall Rob Miracle saying that there are about 500 people on 
the 2 lists about a month ago (maybe Rob can update this number).  If 
this is the case 62 is about 12-13% of that number.  That is a far 
larger sampling than most polls taken in other arenas.  Heck, 
presidential victories are usually called on less than 13% of the 
returns.  

No it is not scientific, and yes you can dispute the findings if you 
wish, but everyone on this list had a chance to make their feelings heard.  
If they choose not to do so, then as in any other democratic process, 
silence is assumed to be consent...  Obviously the majority didn\'t want 
to take the time to respond to a poll.  Maybe they don\'t care what the 
next system looks like.  Maybe they\'re shy or afraid of being flamed 
(although they had my e-mail address to mail it privately to me if they 
wished).  Maybe they didn\'t read either of the messages about it I posted.  
Or maybe they came to the same conclusions by themselves that the poll did.  
All I can do is report the results and draw conclusions based on the 
data I have.

I\'m sorry that the results didn\'t come out the way you hoped, but 
hey, they didn\'t come out the way I would have liked either...

Some might, but some aren\'t. I make no bones about being a Christian, but
there *is* a Christian role-playing game out there (DragonRaid--take a look
at http://associate.com/innovative/dragonraid/index.html or
http://www.alaska.net/~cass/draid/draid.html). You can even download
the rules from an ftp site. My point is that I am of a deeper faith, and so
are those who play DragonRaid, and I personally think that a Role-Playing
game is a great medium for exercising one\'s faith, practicing apologetics,
etc. I\'ve actually thought about doing a Traveller campaign in which the
characters are travelling evangelists!

In other words, I definitely see the relevance of this skill :)

Absolutely.  It\'s not refered to as the POST VIRUS era for nothing.  Virus
is rare in TNE having largely killed itself off in the initial generations.
The only difference between a vampire ship and a pirate ship is that the
vampire may or may not have an actuall crew and is probably in a worse state
of repair.

I think your suggestion is getting away from the main idea of what skills
realy are.  Religion/Theology is a set of beliefs not a skill.  For example
you don\'t list your religion on your resume.  That would be like having a
skill called Republican/Democrate to indicate your political views.

I do agree with you that such beliefs do offer the potential for some ideas
during a game. But a religious scholar would have skills in Admin, Language,
Computer and possible Streetwise and Bribery.  And such skills would make
the charator more attractive to a player.

So what?  You could use the rules from D+D in the Classic Imperium.  The
problem with TNE was that the rule book presented the virus as part of the
basic rules!  Sure you could remove it, but why tangle background with rules
when there is no need to?  Especially when doing so shrinks the market for
your game.

I think the exposion of skills in Traveller is causing a loss of comman
sense.  \'Fencing\' skill is a great example.  If you have property to sell
you find a buyer.  Why do you need a special skill just because the property
has been pinched??  I suppose you could claim the skill allows the seller a
chance to know the buyer is realy working for the police, but simply being
an alert player would work as well and lead the player to beleive that his
presense during the game matters!  Otherwise every action the players make
is now dictated by a simple role of the dice.  No need for the players to
put any thought into their action just role a few dice and see if you succeed.

Another example is Gunsmith.  (Yes I do know that being a gunsmith requires
special training) But mechanical skill already covers this.  And with so
many types of \'guns\' in Traveller you now have to break it down into \'Rifle
GunSmith\', \'Body Pistol GunSmith\', \'Laser Carbine GunSmith\', \'Gauss Rifle

In GT there were only six basic stats.  Each was important in it\'s own
right.  In the same way a small subset of skills makes each skill important
and meaningful.

: I think your suggestion is getting away from the main idea of what skills
: realy are.  Religion/Theology is a set of beliefs not a skill.  For example
: you don\'t list your religion on your resume.  That would be like having a
: skill called Republican/Democrate to indicate your political views.

You\'re looking at this as an issue of religious affiliation and not
religious education.  What of the pastor or theologan who went to
school to learn this stuff for years?

I think the best thing to do is create a Scholar skill where you take
it and declare what you\'re a Scholar in.  This will allow anything
from comic books to religion to works of art.  The effects for each
are the same, the more knowledge you have in a subject, the better you
can dig for details or relate the topic to someone else.  

This also allows some customization based on campaign and character. 
Instead of having an exhaustive list of skills, you can just have stuff
like Scholar, Scientist, etc, where the rules work the same.  Provide
some examples for the players and GM\'s and things get really easy.

I don\'t know. There are certain skills associated with religions (languages
to be learned, philosophy--just take a look at the huge subject of
apologetics!). Maybe it could be a cascaded portion of Scholar?

Also probably true!

I can buy the first half, but I\'m not so sure about the second.

That was the start of the Psionic Suppressions--and of course, as you
know, things didnt end there.

Ok, I see where you\'re going..so now days we don\'t allow
computers to become powerful enough to challenge bio-superiority.
 
How about I give you a technical reason that keeps the big, clunky,
power hungry computers?

Reason Four:  Gravtics!  The development of gravity control technology
had a very un-welcome side-effect, it played regular *hell* with
microelectronics.  In the presence of a working anti-grav device
anything more delicate than a vacuum tube burns right out.  In fact, I
work it such that a landing anti-grav ship can take out half the
planet\'s electronics...if it\'s all chip and transistor based.

- ----
Imperial Encyclopedia:

Some cultures never discovered gravity control and persisted with
electronics development.  This led to them inventing things that would
make our electronic devices look like bundles of sticks. OTOH, without
the advances coming from gravtics research, these misguided societies
are invariably limited to their own worlds, and begin to stagnate and
slide into overpopulation, wars, and eventually world wide
catastrophes!  [Imperial propaganda.  <g>]

Our scouts have come across several of these worlds.  In many cases,
we find destroyed societies with the populance reduced to barbarism.  

Occasionally, we find them in time to help them reverse their
technological direction and travel down the correct path of
development.  Until these worlds can retool their technologies they
are declared as travel restricted zones.

Most worlds discovered and began developing technologies based on
gravtics.  The ability to control gravity is one of the foundations of
our technology.  It has made our star spanning culture possible. 
Loosing some miniaturization in electronics is a small price to pay.
- ----

This gives us big, clunky, power hungry computers (and other
electronics), but as a trade off we get gravity control, T-Plates,
Jump Drives and Fusion in a can!

Knowledge is one thing but access to the necessary tools and equipment is
another.  For example, I know the basic theories behind casting a cast-iron
engine block... now all I need is the smelting plant, a forge, and a mold of the

If such a skill allows maintenance of such equipment, it would be extremely
*specialized* knowledge.  Repair of high tech equipment is no longer "repair"
but "Re & Re" or simply "replacement" of damaged components (Ford just came out
with a non-servicable transmission).  Even today, companies don\'t spend a lot of
time repairing items such as PCs; they replace entire components instead.  Under
battlefield conditions, you have to decide how many seperate components make up
a single suit of Battle Dress and if all of these components are kept in stock
at the local depot at all times.

Personally, I\'ve always considered repair-type skills to be entirely different
than building- & design-type skills.  IMHO, one requires a natural-born
mechanical aptitude while the other requires an education in engineering,
architecture, etc.

More specific maintenance skills should be specialist-oriented;

I would agree with you about R&R practices. However, there is this
logistical train associated with R&R maintenance practices. In the
darkness of space, no one can hear your triplicate requisition for the
widget that makes the thingie go. I feel that as society moves away
from its logistic support, like space, the skills to repair will
increase in scope and complexity. That\'s why in colonial societies, the
artisans and craftsmen are the ones who build the society. This is
based on their ability to fabricate and repair stuff from over there.

Personal military goods are a prime example of this. In WWII, the
ability of American GI\'s to tinker with other nation\'s weapons and
equipment and make them go was noted often by historians (reference
check any one?). This is in the absence of the logistic train that
supports the other product.

IMO, a variety of skills is necessary, if the guidance is there for
acquiring them.

13% of the returns in a presidentail race still amounts to several hundred

You\'re right.  It isn\'t.  And I think it would be a mistake for IG to gamble
future sales of the system on the view point of 62 internet users who
responded to a survey.

Majority?  You mean the majority of internet users, not the majority of
Traveller players.  An silence can not be assumed to be consent, it could
mean that only 62 people noticed the survey.  I often skim through parts of
the list that don\'t interest me.

Sorry Stu, but the results you have do not allow you to draw any conclusion
other than \'58 out 62 internet users who like Traveller and respond to
surveys like complexity\'  IG would be making a big mistake gambling future
sales of their system on your conclusion (unless they only wanted to sell it
to internet users who like Traveller and respond to surverys).

The point I\'m trying to make about the survey is that the results althought
interesting are rather meaningless.  All they show is that a small subset of
internet users who subscribe to this list and respond to surveys like
complexity.

What\'s wrong with just using the Education stat?  

Ok, what about looking at it the same way as history.  Historians spend
years in study, yet unless you define a history skill for each and every
subset of history you would be better off just using the players Education
Stat.  Save skills for situations that clearly fall outside of the bounds of
the basic stats.  Example, don\'t add a juggling skill, simply use the
players Dex if needed.  (Yes, not every PC can juggle.  But that would be
apparent based on the PCs background)

I don\'t think that analogy is quite right; listing yourself as
Republican/Democrat is more like listing your skills as Christian/Muslim,
not "Religion Theology". You can get an undergraduate degree in theology,
which in my mind makes it a skill similar to history. It can cover a broad
range of faiths or perhaps one faith in particular, and the character\'s
skill need not have anything to do with his or her faith - it\'s conceivable
to have an atheist sociologist with Religion-3, trying to put into
psychohistorical perspective the causes and influences of religion, for
example.

I like the "scholar" idea someone else posted. With a few examples, it
could cover all such skills that, while admittedly worthy and worthwhile to
have in a campaign, are similar enough of little-used enough that the space
saved by putting them under one umbrella would be better used for other
things - like a paragraph on rock-throwing :)

I don\'t think so.  Understanding Aslan beleifs in central to understanding
why the Aslan are the way they are.  Perhaps the skill should be called
"Ritual" in an attempt to get away from the whole religious part but it is a
relatively important thing.  Assuming you want to get into that whole can of
worms in the first place.  A knowledge of Ritual, specific to culture, could
potentially stop you from putting your proverbial foot in it when you
encounter the local leader.  The last thing you want to do is offend a man
who\'s already on the edge when he\'s got nuclear weapons.

My problem was that I wanted to use the character generation system from TNE

planning on introducing Virus earlier than depicted in the game (ie: the players
were unaware of what was to come).  The TNE rulebook was laid out so poorly that
my players easily stumbled into the Virus information between the Character
Generation and Skills sections.  Thankfully, they only gave it a brief glimpse
(they though it dealt with some sort of biological virus and didn\'t see the real
Virus coming  8-)

Personally, I like the old boxed RPG concept, with separate books for players
and referees.  That way, information stays where it belongs.

I agree.  However, I also believe that a plateau will be reached when humanity
can no longer learn enough to repair high tech equipment _without_ specific high
tech repair tools & equipment (eg: silicon chip design, for example).  I see
this type of stuff in the automotive trade all the time.  Believe me, no
mechanic I know of could repair any of the sensors or actuators on some of
today\'s cars, not to mention a burned out ECM (ie: computer). They\'re too
miniturized, for one thing.  When things are designed to be resiliant, they are
often equally difficult to repair ("replacement" is usually pretty easy,
though).  As things become more and more sophisticated, I would imagine that the
components would become equally integrated until one epoxy-sealed black box did
everything.  There will always be widgets and thingies, however  8-)

I have seen a hard drive that belonged to a customer a few years ago.  It seems
that he had a hard disk failure and was so mad that he fired off three rounds
from his .357 Magnum into his hard drive.  Now this would be a good example of
battle damage and NO amount of tinkering and fiddling would bring that drive

As technology advances, however, a single skill point in "Electronics" becomes

broken down into a number of cascade skills to allow for better roleplaying as

comments, suggestions, information, corrections, additions and deletions.
I have tried to address several concerns brought up on the list regarding
various skills, and have tried to run the middle road between those who
want detailed skills and those who want broad skills.  I leaned a little
towards detail for military skills to satisfy all the merc types out
there, and I think the technical skills are a little on the detailed side
as well. Let me know what you think. 

NOTE ON SKILLS BY TECH LEVEL

I think skills should be understood to be mediated by the character\'s 
native TL.  Someone from a TL-5 world might have mechanic skill, but he 
won\'t be able to repair starship turrets (At least not  easily.  I\'d say 
give a -DM equal to the TL difference).


SKILL CATEGORIES

Skills below are placed in categories mainly for ease of organization.  
These categories could also be used in chargen, just like in 2300AD 
(e.g., you get x number of skills from Underworld Skills).

Skills come in several types:

(D) Default: represents a skill that everyone has at level-0.
	(DL): only individuals at low (3-) tech levels get this as default.
	(DM): only individuals at medium TL (4-8) get this as default.
	(DH): only individuals at high TL (9+) get this as default.
[I considered having Dn+, where n would be a specific tech level, but I 
think this is simpler and does the job just as well. Comments?]

(C) Cascade: represents a group of related skills.  Pick one of them and 
all others are at 1/2 level.

(G) Group:  represents a group of related skills.  Pick one of them but 
get level-nil in all others (or level-0 at GM\'s discretion).

***ACADEMIC SKILLS***********************

Research (D)

Instruction

skills.  It represents knowledge about belief systems, holy writings,

Designer (G)
	-Spacecraft	:

Jack-of-all-Trades [I picture this as a skill which enables your other 
skills to wander into neighboring disciplines.]

Language (C)
	-Choose a particular language 

[Note:  I think language skills should be given as part of the 
character\'s "background package" or some step which is not part of career 
resolution. This resolves the problem of "wasting" skills on gaining 
languages.  Having grown up in Quebec, I\'m bilingual, but not because of 
any "training"]

Orienteering [refers to navigating on planet surfaces]

Perception (D) [I don\'t like the idea of a seperate Observation skill.  
The argument was good, and I too am a good observer but bad perceiver, 
but I feel this dilutes things a bit too much]

Recon (D) [maybe we should call this skill scouting or something like that?]

Survey [could someone please explain to me what this skill is?]

Survival [Not default, lots of people have died cuz they didn\'t know not 
to drink salt water.]

True.  Guess I didn\'t really think about this...  I can definitely 
see where that would be a problem.

I can\'t argue with you here a bit.  Since the days of CT, and the old 
"For Referees Only" on the Adventures, GDW didn\'t really make much of 
an effort to keep information of any kind secret from players.

If stuff is "For Referees Only", it shouldn\'t be in the same book at 
all.  It should be in a seperate book.

If this happened c 300,000BC then the "near-intelligent cavemen" cannot have
been Homo sapiens, but some earlier human type. The small gene-pool of
abducted "cavemen" have therefore undergone 300,000 years of divergent
evolution from the base population on Terra.  The Terran population evolved
into Homo Sapiens, but the transported populations would not have done so -
they would have evolved into other geni(?) of Homo or into entirely new
species: some of these transported populations may never have evolved full
intelligence.  This means that neither the Vilani or the Zhodani can
possibly be Homo Sapiens and must belong to some other human genus.

I don\'t know if this is the intended consequence of the Ancient Abduction,
but its a fascinating idea!

skills define a character\'s origin, or does the character define what and 
why the skills are? In other words, does a character become `religious\' 
or knowledgeable about religion (a) because she has that skill or (b) 
because that is a background which explains (some of) the skills that 
character has?

Taking me as an example, under model (a) I would have a UPP something like

664BC8 Scientist, in 2nd term, age 24 Cr few
Religion-2 Chemistry-2 Physics-1 Computing-1 Instruction-1 Jack-o-T-1

Under model (b) I would be more like

664BC8 Scientist, in 2nd term, age 24 Cr few
Chemistry-2 Physics-1 Computing-1 Instruction-1 Liason-1 Psychology-1 JoT-1

with the Liason skill representing learning to get along with people in a 
practical sense and the Psychology being something in which I\'m interested,
partly in the context of understanding people\'s spirituality.

The point I\'m trying to make is that skills in Traveller represent 
specific things that a character can do well, and which are likely to be 
used quite often. We could get silly with the skills above, and start 
including ones like Guitar-1 and Technical Writing-2, but these skills 
are simply not necessary; if it becomes particularly important that a 
character\'s guitar playing be impressive, then the ref can assign a level 
of skill based on how much time the character practices, and roll a task 
based on skill and Dex (say). Technical writing is a function of 
education and technical competence (appropriate science skill).

Going back to religion, therefore, I would separate this out into 
`generally applicable skills\' (social and academic, mainly) and `things 
in which the character takes a particular interest\' (which I would 
moderate via rolls on Edu, Int and maybe Soc, or -- mostly -- via role 
playing). The former should be part of the main skill set; the latter are 
characterisations and part of the role-playing proper.

Mind you, having said all that, you do need to have a reasonable number 
of `basic\' skills. I wouldn\'t go back to the CT `scientists have computer 
skill and maybe electronics\' approach...

For me, DL, DM and DH seem to be sufficient.

>***MILITARY SKILLS*************************
>
>Archery (C)	[I do not think this should be a default skill]

I agress with you, no default, even for low TLs.
I would change this to (G) and drop Atlatl.

>["Armorer" has been placed as a cascade of craftsman, below]

I would include the ability to fix devices into the corresponding useage
skills (mainly Fire Combat and Battledress), as Derek sugested earlier in
this list.

>Blade (C)
>	-Short Blade (D): knives, daggers, blades...
>	-Long Blade (D) : swords, cutlass, broadsword...  
>	-2 Hand Blade (D): bastard sword, 2 handed sword...

I would drop D for Long and 2H blades.

>Cudgel (C)
>	-Short Club (D)	: billy club, bo stick, bottle...
>	-Long Club (D)	: baseball bat, treebranch...
>	-Staff (D)	: staff, pole, broomhandle...
"2 Hand Club" to be uniform?

>Environment Combat (C)

I would abstract this to "trained to fight in unusual environments" and drop
all cascades.

>Field Artillery 
>Gunnery

Are here great differences? Oh, some people would say, of course I suppose.

>Hammer/Axe/Mace (C) [Can anyone think up a better term for this?]

I wouldn\'t divide melee weapons so far. Perhaps impaling and slashing
weapons are enough. For a fantasy game, a broader diversification might be
useful, but I think just to provide some primitive barbarian skills, this is
enough.

>Heavy Weapons (C)
>[I would also include laser-based variants at TL 9+, and plasma/fusion 
>variants at TL 12+]

Will they really work so differnt that different (sub)skills are needed?
Isn\'t it all about targetting and pulling the trigger? :-)

>Melee Weapon (G) (see individual skills for cascade options)

I feel that a third level isn\'t a good idea. I would go with only this melee
skill and drop the cascades of these subskills.

>Ranged Weapon (G) (see individual skills for cascade options)

Same goes here.

>Slug Weapon (C)  [Each includes tranq, googun, and tangler equivalents.]

I don\'t think, that pistols and rifles should be D. Perhaps it\'s that way in
the U.S. but in most parts of the world weapons aren\'t freely available and
most people will have no training in these skills.

>Unarmed Combat (D)  
>[I don\'t like the idea of distinguishing Brawling and Martial Arts.  Yes 
>they are different, but they aim to achieve the same goal and have the 
>same results. I would lump both into this skill.]

I agree.

>***ACADEMIC SKILLS***********************

>Instruction  

Is this skill useful I a lot of roleplaying situations? It\'s also difficult
to learn Calligraphy and it\'s no skill in Traveller (yet) 

Science = natural science and Scolar = liberal arts? These are the
(translated) terms I would categorize the skills under.

>	-Theology 
>[This does not represent one\'s faith, which is outside the realm of 
>skills.  It represents knowledge about belief systems, holy writings, 
>etc. from various cultures]

That\'s the right definition, IMHO.

>***CRIMINAL/POLICE SKILLS******************

>Blackmarketeer 

I would drop this skill, because most social skills should be left to
roleplaying and selling "hot" goods isn\'t that different to selling or
buying any goods.

>Break and Enter [Replaces "Intrusion" which is not overly clear and 
>sounds sort of immoral :-) ]

I would prefer one-world skill names.

>Disguise [not default, in my opinion]

I\'d agree

>Forensics

I also could be a subskill of medicine, IMHO.

>Forgery [Definately not default, IMO]

Yes.

>Gambling (D)
>
>Interrogation (D)

To get information from a suspect or witness isn\'t that simple, I think. No
default.

>Intimidation (D)

I would drop this.

>(Investigation has been removed.  In my opinion it is a combination of 
>Forensics, Interrogation, Perception, and Streetwise.)

Then, it\'s a good canditat to include this skill and drop all other (just
kidding :-) Perhaps, I would drop Forensics and replace Interrogation with
(the more general) Investigation.

>***TECHNICAL SKILLS*********************
>
>Animal Rider (C)  [note, this is here because technically, it\'s a vehicle]

I would simply call this "Riding" and drop the cascade for simpicity.

>Animal Care (C)  [includes training, maintaining, packing, and husbandry]
>	-Choose specific animal.

Again for the same reason, drop C.

>Aircraft (G)

>[Can anyone think of others?  Are the last two too specific? I was 

Yes.

>(Astrogation has been replaced by Navigation and Astrography).

What\'s the need of Astrography besides Astrogation?

>Computer (C)
>	-Programming	
>	-Repair		
>	-Hacking
>	-Applications (DH)

Computer usage (Applications) should be open for everyone. No skill needed.
I would put Hacking and Programming together (even it Hacking is only a form
of creative application use but I need some more knowledge) and to repair
computers, I would suggest the Electronics skill. ("How many computer
scientists do you need to change a defect light blub? Zero. It\'s a hardware
problem.")

>Designer (G)
>	-Spacecraft	:
>	-Architectural	:
>	-Vehicular	:
>[Can anyone think of others?  This is supposed to be "engineering" in the 
>20th century sense, but is called "design" to distinguish it.]

I would drop this skill. 

>Engineer  [This refers to running and repairing starships as opposed to 
>designing them.]

>Farming

Isn\'t this a craft? (At least with my understanding of craft)

>Gravitics

Isn\'t this a science?

>Navigation [Refers to spacecraft in jump space. Pilot covers navigation 
>in real space. Orienteering covers navigation on planet surfaces.]

If that\'s no more, I would stay with Astrogation.

>Pilot [Refers to spacecraft (of any size) maneuvering/navigating in real 
>space. Ship\'s boat is eliminated and/or covered by Grav Craft]

Piloting a space craft is either done with some programming or the same as
flying with a grav vehicle, IHMO. Sophisticated controls will reduce the
needed instruments to a minimum. So I would introduce something like general
Spacecraft Operation add Spacecraft as subskill to the general driving skill.

>Prospecting [Or is this just a combination of Sensor Ops and Geology?]

No, I don\'t think so. I would see this as own skill, perhaps named Mining?

> Space (G)
>	-Pilot
>	-Navigation
>	-Engineer
>	-Gunnery
>	-Vacc
>[Am I missing any here?]

All skill are already listed anywhere. Why a special Space-Group?

>***PROFESSIONAL SKILLS********************

>Diplomacy (D)

I would drop D.

>Medicine (DM) (DH) [I like the idea of Med-1 being 1st Aid up to Med-4 
>being surgeon].

>Politics

What\'s that? Oratory? Diplomacy? Unscrupulousness? 

>Steward (D) [where does this go? Professional Skills? Other Skills?]

I would say professional.

>Innate (G)
>	-Carousing
>	-Leadership

Where the difference between innated streetwise and normal streetwise for

Good point.

>Perception (D) [I don\'t like the idea of a seperate Observation skill.  
>The argument was good, and I too am a good observer but bad perceiver,

Keep it simple.

>Recon (D) [maybe we should call this skill scouting or something like that?]

Yes, please.

>Survey [could someone please explain to me what this skill is?]

As far as I believe, a systematic scouting and cartographing of unknow
regions, or more general, the collection all all data worth knowing.

Still a large set of skills, but it looks good. I still prefer a more
uniform set of combat skills as follows:

Melee (Unarmed)
        Covering brawling and at higher levels artial arts.
        Also covering combat with iron-fists or similar weapons.

Melee (Blade weapons)
        Covering attacking, parrying and (at higher levels) fencing with
        pointed weapons.

Melee (Clubs)
        Covering attacking, parrying with hacking or slashing weapons
        where you have to wing your weapon instead of stabbing.

Melee (Polearms)
        Covering combat with long, mostly two handed weapons.

Missile combat (Throwing weapons)
        Covering targetting with throwing knifes, spears or axes.
        Also covers sling weapons.

Missile combat (Bow)
        Use of historic (curved) or modern (composite) bows.

Missile combat (Crossbow)
        Use of all kind of crossbows.

Gun combat (Early firearms)
        Covers use and maintenance of simple black powder weapons.
        Also covers the basic knowledge about these kind of weapons.

Gun combat (Modern firearms)
        Covers use and maintenance of modern slug weapons
        Also covers the basic knowledge about these kind of weapons.
        Gaus weapons are included here.

Gun combat (Energy weapons)
        Covers use and maintenance of lasers and plasma rifles.
        Also covers the basic knowledge about these kind of weapons.

Gun combat (Heavy weapons)
        Covers all kinds of rocket throwers, anti-tank weapons or
        heavy machine guns.

You might actually want to specialize this (Imperial, Subsector, 
Planetary), or (Trade, Criminal, ...).  Of course, I\'m a law student, so 
when I look at it I see it as a big, diverse, field.


>Medicine (DM) (DH) [I like the idea of Med-1 being 1st Aid up to Med-4
>being surgeon].

I have issues with it.  There are a lot of paths to explore in medicine 
besides surgery.  I have a feeling that the "Med-4 = surgeon" thing is a 
consequence of the emphasis on military things.  There should be people 
with Med-6 who are experts in, say, communicable diseases (this is 
especially relevant when you\'re exploring new planets!).  Most real-world 
physicians do not perform surgery, and have only been exposed to it 
during clinical rotations.

****
XENOQUALIFIERS

Certain skills are going to exist in different versions where different 
races (and sometimes cultures) are concerned.  Both of the skills above 
are good examples.  An Imperial Naval physician with Med-5 who has to 
treat a Vargr will (unless she\'s served with a Vargr unit) not be 
operating anywhere near level 5, and if she has to treat a K\'Kree may be 
no better than someone who has taken a first aid course.  Similarly, a 
lawyer from Vland called in to argue a case on, say, Lair would be 
shocked at what constitutes appropriate courtroom conduct and would 
almost certainly hose his client badly.

Other obvious skills include (off the top of my head) Streetwise, 
Bribery, Liaison, Leadership, *possibly* Broker and Trader (though the 
trade community might be cosmopolitan enough that it wouldn\'t matter), 
Interview, Interrogation.  There are probably others.

I can think of three ways to handle this:

1.  Ignore the differences (I think this is foolish, and tends to make the
    aliens more like "humans in funny suits")

2.  Allow characters who spend time around a different culture or race,
    using their skill, to receive a "xenoqualifier" attached to it, thus
    letting them use the skill effectively in that context

3.  Allow characters to purchase the xenoqualified versions of a skill
    separately from the Imperium versions

I use a combination of (2) and (3) in my own campaign.  I use 2, for 
example, with Medical skill, making -- perhaps wrongly -- the assumption 
that some of the skills learned in human medicine carry over.  I use 3 
with "interaction" skills like Streetwise, where the behavior patterns 
are so culture-dependent that you really need a new skill.

This has come up in my game because the PCs misjumped way deep into Vargr 
space, and have been learning the ropes.

Actually it was originally beleived that the Genus Homo Sapiens was only in
the order of 20-50,000 years old based on fossil evidence obtained from a
number of sites in west africa.  This was held to be absolutely true for
nearly thirty years.  However, over the least decade a number of sites have
begun turning up, particularly in the southern african fossil beds that
would seem to push the origin of Homo Sapiens back to the 150-200,000 year
time frame.  What this means is that Homo Sapiens exited contemperainous
with several other genus for thousands of years.

In theory the Ancients would have had at least three different Homo speicies
to work with.

(oops!)

Howdy!  This is just a bit of an overview of my views on the skills 
thing.  I just got done waxing philisophical (or not) on T4 and some 
basic ideas I have in a mailing re: FFS Lite, so I\'ll keep this a bit 
shorter.  I\'m not going to comment on every skill (which doesn\'t mean I 
like or dislike any given one), but make a few more general comments.

IMHO, in keeping with the idea of a *BASIC* T4 that can be sold to a new 
(and non-gearhead) audience, we don\'t need to get overly complicated in 
defining all the skills. Maybe a supplemental publication on skills?

As a for instance, let\'s look at medical.  For many of us, the following 
worked well enough: 
   Med-0 = mother kisses knee and puts on bandaid and knows not to put 
            tournequet (sp?) around neck,
   Med-1 = standard 1st aid such as taught in the military,
   Med-2 = EMT/field medic,
   Med-3 = (basic) doctor.
For others, splitting into specialties at Med-3 (or 4) and taking 
partial skills in other areas seems good.  e.g.: My combat doctor 
character (Admin-1, Medic-6, GC(Pistol)-5, ..., not necessarily a 
pacifist ;) ) specialized in Trauma(effective level 6), has a related
ability of 5 in (Macro-)Surgery, and maybe a 4 in other specialties.

Computer has also been commented on.  Face it, your average non-chiphead 
(not in this mailing list; maybe an MD who cares a lot about the 
preceeding) doesn\'t know and couldn\'t care less about the differences 
between hardware and software, much less AI, operations, programming, 
etc.  While most of us know that there are a lot of (critical) 
difference, they won\'t reduce playability if the group involved don\'t 
care about them.  ( ref: \'OK, the spaceport supervisor\'s left his office 
to check out your little diversion.  Yes, his terminal\'s powered up.\'  
player: \'I\'ve got comp-4, and I\'m looking for the last month\'s cargo 
manifests.  (out of character) I don\'t know if it\'s AI, operations, or 
programming! I\'m a psychologist, for Pete\'s sake!!)
 

This wasn\'t well developed, but shows what I mean.  Most players have 
areas of greater or lesser interest, and this will be reflected in which 
skills they wish to expand.  Maybe a rule that any skill at a given 
level (4?) or higher must be specialized.  After all, my BS in Nuc Eng 
was very general, covering Health Physics, Fission power, fusion theory,
requlatory concerns, waste management, radiochemestry, and a number of 
lesser topics.  My MS work, on the other hand, is concentrating on 
radwaste remediation, and specifically groundwater transport of 
nuclides.  However, I\'ve gained a lot of experience in researching 
and (with time and a successful research task?) could expand my 
knowledge in other areas to meet or exceed that in my area of 
specialization.

I think it is definitely necessary to have a limited number of canon 
skills, particularly for the first release.  After all, you could have 
200+ skills, and each of us would still find something we\'d like to add. 
Limit the basic (official) amount, and allow refs to add via house 
rules.  It may, however, be a good idea to require new skills to have a 
canon skill to which they are identified for transplant to other games. 
(I know this isn\'t always practical, but wouldn\'t it be nice?)

Default skills: how about a default number (6? 10?) of default \'slots\' 
which a player could select skills for?  Those skills not available for 
default (battledress!, etc.) would be identified.  Others would be 
limited by background (vacc suit-0 not likely for a ground hog, unless a 
SCUBA diver).  Most players would not have bow skill, but I\'ve messed  
around with them enough to have a bow-0, without living on a TL 5- 
planet.  This would allow a lot of background development without a lot 
of time, effort, or effect on game balance. 

Comments on a few skills:

Armorer:  One who works in an armory?  IMHO, both (small) weapons and 
armor.  Low levels imply can maintain effectively, ensure continue to 
work, fit to individuals.  Higher levels allow repair, possibly with 
mech/electronics/computer/etc. skills as required/beneficial. Also maybe 
customize to an individual to improve effectiveness (after SORAG) or 
reduce encumbrance.  Only at very high levels, with additional skills, 
TL/item-specific training, and proper tools/materials/workshop would 
creation be possible.  Of course, may allow use of non-standard 
materials to simulate (limited) armor capability.  Higher levels may  
require cascading to weapons(slug/laser/energy) and armor(cloth/hard 
(ceramic, metal, etc.)/power). 

Fencing:  If swordplay, this might be a high level speciallization under 
blade combat.  If dealing with grey goods, maybe streetwise?

Regarding some of the particular skills people are asking for, it seems 
possible to have a supplement which spells out some additional skills.  
Alternativley, combinations of skills which give the desired effect.  
(e.g. GC(Cbt Rfl)-3 + Vacc-2 + Elect-3 + Mech-2 = Armorer-2) Once again, 
you\'ll never make everyone happy.  I, for instance, find a single skill 
for Engineering to be ludicrous!  But it needn\'t affect playability.  A 
few score skills which are fairly abstract seems a good idea for the 
basic version of T4. 

That\'s all for now - for what it\'s worth! ;)

of recognition, and all the help he can get.  If you haven\'t seen it, 
check it out at:

http://www.usa.net/~goldendj/Traveller/Admiralty/FFSLight/FFSLight.html
I\'d like to get some feed back on a thought I\'ve got on this.  I know
that this audience may be heavy with those who like the full-blown FFS,
but picture yourself or your players in the position of having to whip
up a quick ship in 20 minutes or so.

My ship design experience has been with HG.  As such, I\'m used to most
components (drives, armor, etc.) being proportionately based on ship\'s
displacement.  I pick a tonnage, pick what drives and armor I want, 
pick weapons/defenses, calculate how much powerplant I need, add misc.,
staterooms, bridge, etc., and I\'m pretty much done.  This allows a lot
of flexability in a fairly short time.

I\'m not familiar with FFS, but from looking at the tables on Dave\'s 
page, it looks like most of the calculations are made the same way.  
The point is, I don\'t see a few simple multiplications as being terribly
restrictive.  There are so many ships already out there that anyone who
wants to design one should be willing to go to at least that much 
trouble.  Maybe we could add a catalog of off the shelf components like
CT2, but I hope we don\'t need that!

As far as I can see, it seems like where things might need to be simpler
is where there are a near infinite variety of available options, such as
in weapons design.  Create a few standard varieties based on experience
and make them the options.  And allow those who like greater detail to 
really optimize them with the full FFS.

I guess I\'d rather just a simple list of straightforward calculations,
even if they involve 3 or 4 multiplications at a time, than having to
wade through a ton of tables which limit me to \'standard\' hull sizes.

Comments, anyone?  Don\'t worry, I\'ve got my asbestos underwear on, over
my lead jockey shorts.  Flame away!

I got no problem with a cool looking cover, and even a teaser of the 
adventure on the back cover.  Kind of like the poster art for a 
movie...  

I do got a problem when the background material stuff is on the same 
page as character generation stuff...like it was with MT & TNE...

Good news is that with the Mililieu system that IG is proposing, the 
basic rules are going to be just that (basic rules).  The background 
material for the particular era will be in a seperate supplement.  
This should eliminate that problem.

     That depends.  I\'ve been playing Traveller since 1980, and in that
time, I\'ve never done any role-playing.  I\'m playing a *game*, not a
*role*.  Frankly, the fun for me was the "far future engineering."  The
characters were like chess pieces.  The nice thing was that Traveller
could accomodate both viewpoints.

I really don\'t think that Trav. was developed with this type of customer
in mind. I believe that a large majority bought the game to role-play.

     Why can\'t we have both?  Simple basic rules, and insanely complex
add-ons?

If IG has unlimited resources we could. However, they don\'t & for now

Actually, ironically enough, it ruins it for the player involved more 
than the GM.  

I don\'t even think that most people would try to do this intentionally.  
But lets face it, if you\'re flipping the pages of Traveller: The New Era, 
you\'re going to run into sidebars.  In fact, if for some reason you 
flipped through to the wrong set of pages, you\'d run into the pages 
detailing the campaign background.  This could be done quite 
accidentally.  At least if the stuff is in a seperate book, you have 
to get the proper book, and start leafing through.  Prevents it from 
happening accidentally.  And if you label it "For Referees Only", or 
some such, it even tells the player to beware.

I\'ve never run across a cheater in an RPG.  There isn\'t much point 
to it.  If I did, it would be the last time they ever gamed with me as 
a Referee, or as a fellow player.

But yes, it would hurt the player more than the referee.

Tough call.  I enjoyed the game, and frankly played it just a few 
months ago.

It does tend to look the same after repetitive play.  There are a few 
things that are kind of fun.  Playing out the invasion of the planet 
is fun.  It gives you a nice full color map in the standard traveller 
format of Earth, which can be useful for other adventures there.  I 
guess it depends on how much you\'re going to get out of it.  If I had 
to make the call at the price you\'re paying, I wouldn\'t know which 
way to go.  Then again, you probably won\'t get too much of a shot at 
it again...

Actually, its more of an operational level ground attack game, with 
the naval combat being limited to Solomani system defense forces 
(SDB\'s and the like), against an Imperial invasion fleet.

Hope this helps...

Really, you just don\'t want them to do 1 at the expense of the 1 you 
want.

I understand your point of view, but it would be a mistake to spurn 
the gearheads just as much as it would those of us who look at the 
Starship the same way we would the family station wagon, for gaming 
purposes (something that gets you there).

Actually, most of what is out there right now would seem to dispute 
this.

Religion isn\'t a skill, but Theology is a knowledge.

I had a player back in the late 70\'s that wanted to play a Navy
Chaplin in a game.  We cribbed up a character sheet for him with
anthropology, sociology, phycology, philosophy, and recruiting
included.  I gave him a Theology skill too, but I don\'t recall exactly
what it was for...oh yeah, it was to identify,
understand, evaluate religious ritual in alien cultures.  Maybe I
should have called it Xenotheology.  <g>

Actually, "Theology" is a skill.  Knowing the precepts, dogmas, and so forth
of a religion is an area of knowledge.  The (sad) fact that most church-goers
know little about these aspects of their religion doesn\'t invalidate it as a
useful skill.

(Parenthetical note: I\'m not trying to stir up an argument about a possibly
touchy subject.  Direct flames to me personally, not the list.  For the
record, I\'m an Anglican, warden of my church, and on the boundary between
inclusivism and pluralism.)

For many campaigns I could see this as a useless skill, because religions
don\'t really enter into the game.  But the same could be said for sociology -
many campaigns don\'t really have different cultures.  However, religion _can_
be important in daily life, and understanding how religions work would be an
important skill for a first-contact team to have.  

I would put Theology/Philosophy in the Social Science skill cluster.

I agree here.  Theology is a field of study as serious in its own way 
as biology, chemistry, sociology, etc...  Very definitely a skill as 
the game defines skills.  It will remain a field of study in some form, 
for as long as there are cultures of intelligent beings.

The truely difficult part is one of treating religious beleifs with respect
(which I imagine you do) -- especially the ones which are not your own!  I
generally include in my own campaigns the assumption that most major human
religions will continue well into the future, but that they are not high on
the list of the priorities of most adventurers.  I have had players wish to
specify reigion as part of their character -- in those cases I simply insist
that they include the practice in their roleplaying as well.

Best added as a GM\'s option, though.  It\'s way too easy to turn religious
NPC\'s in to jokes.  Many published adventures seemed to be of the "wackey
sect of the day" sort, and I found them a bit annoying.  Roleplaying a
missionary, with the right GM, could be very interesting, though.

In the campaigns where I\'ve used them, players who don\'t show respect 
for local religious customs, where such religious customs are 
prevalent in a community (religious dictatorships for example), are just 
asking for (and usually getting into) trouble.

: I think the question of religion skill raises an important point: do

: with the Liason skill representing learning to get along with people in a

: partly in the context of understanding people\'s spirituality.

But the problem here is that it doesn\'t take into account Religious
studies.  You\'ve gone from being a religious academic in the first
example to a ship\'s counselor in the second.  A skill like "Religion"
or even "Scholar (Religion)" should cover more than just confession.
What about the 158 yr old Vilani archeologist who\'s been searching for
the Holy Tea Set?  Surely he would have a Religion-3 which doesn\'t
necessarily reflect that he\'s a priest, but rather that\'s he\'s
educated in this particular field (history, legends, lore, etc...).
It\'s no different than "History" except that it has a much more
limited scope--but it\'s still an integral skill to the character (even
if it isn\'t in terms of game mechanics).

I just received the latest (July 1996) issue of Popular Science magazine.
It has an article on the new technologies the US is using in Bosnia. 
Except for anti-gravity and lasers, the devices described in this article
are significantly more advanced than most of the devices described in CT
and than many described in MT or TNE. 

I am worried, though hopeful, that T4 will finally result in a SF game

Vernor Vinge means about the approaching singularity. 

In any event, the article is worth reading as a description of what folks

 My gut inclination is to complicate this a little bit:  If the
 _concept_ being addressed exists at the lower TL, your rule (DM
 -TLDiff) applies; if it doesn\'t, the task becomes impossible (not
 Impossible the success level, impossible as in "you can\'t do it.")

 Example:  Gasoline-fueled internal-combustion become available in
 the form of the Model-T at TL(4? 5?).  They are still common
 technology (in the form of the Porsche 911) at TL8.  Henry Ford I,
 who could repair one of his own machines, would be able to at
 least understand in principle what\'s going on in that Porsche, but
 couldn\'t repair it as well as he could one of his own.

 Leonardo daVinci, genius as he was, had no conception of the IC
 engine.  You could explain it to him (in Italian, with lots of
 circumlocutions for missing vocabulary), and he might very well
 understand it, but without learning the technology, he\'d not have
 a prayer of being able to do anything with it, in spite of being
 a good mechanic by the standards of his time.

 Unless you\'re going to allow default modification based on other
 than TL (and I think you should), drop the distinction, and don\'t
 provide default skills that are TL-specific.  If you do go with
 other-factor defaults, it\'s better to just list the minimum
 criteria that must be met for it to be a default skill:

 Swimming (D Hyd=9+)

 Any character that lives on a world that\'s more than 85% water
 covered will know how to swim.

 Watercraft, motorized (D Hyd=9+, TL6+)

 Anyone that lives on a world that\'s more than 85% water covered,
 and which has a tech level sufficient for mass-produced motor
 boats will know how to operate a motorboat.

 Watercraft, human powered (D Hyd=9+)

 Any character that lives on a world that\'s more than 85% water
 covered will know how to build rafts, and probably rowboats or
 canoes as well.

 Vacc Suit (D Atm=3-, TL=8+)

 Anyone that lives on a world with a normally-unbreathably-thin
 atmosphere, with a technology high enough to build space suits,
 will know how to wear one, and conduct routine activities in it.

 My gut feeling is that with proper grouping of skill groups, it
 would be more appropriate to say level-1 if the primary is at
 level-3 or better, level-0 otherwise.



 ::>***MILITARY SKILLS*************************

 ::>Archery (C) [I do not think this should be a default skill]
 ::> -Bow
 ::> -Crossbow
 ::> -Sling
 ::> -Atlatl

 I have no idea of what an atlatl is, but Crossbow is probably more
 akin to your Ranged Weapon than to the others listed here.  And
 bow (as in conventional, not cross) is far different from sling.
 Toss this group, or convert it to Archaic Weapons (Group,
 level-nil) and add cudgel/mace/axe/hammer, blade, and polearm.  If
 you go with the latter, copy Crossbow into the Ranged Weapon
 group.

 ::>Blade (C)
 ::> -Short Blade (D): knives, daggers, blades...
 ::> -Long Blade (D) : swords, cutlass, broadsword...
 ::> -2 Hand Blade (D): bastard sword, 2 handed sword...

 Keep this as a cascade, but make it a choice off the Archaic
 Weapons group.  Bastard Sword should be in both Long and 2-Hand.

 ::>Cudgel (C)
 ::> -Short Club (D) : billy club, bo stick, bottle...
 ::> -Long Club (D) : baseball bat, treebranch...
 ::> -Staff (D) : staff, pole, broomhandle...

 I\'d make Hammer/Mace part of this cluster, possibly as additional
 weapons in Long.  I\'m not sure where to put Axe.

 Definitely etc.  Including Urban.

 Yes, and no.  I\'ve heard it asserted that Brawling-equivalent
 skills are for beating the stuffing out of the opponent, relying
 on overpowering force.  Martial arts are for using the opponent\'s
 skill against him.

 The eight-year-old isn\'t going to have a prayer against the
 professional boxer in straight brawling-equivalent, but if the 8yo
 can get the leverage (not impossible), he _can_ discourage the
 boxer.  Separate \'em out, but use selection of a specific
 martial-arts style strictly as a "color" item.

 Brawling-equivalent is a STR/END skill.  Martial Arts is a DEX
 skill.

 The current English term in vogue is "Planetary Science".
 Planetology would also be acceptable, being an equivalent
 construction entirely from Greek roots (planetes, wanderer +

 Persuasion.  Covers it, plus "legitimate" discourse as well.

 Default only if it includes _playing_, but not _organizing/operating_.
 If it refers to running illicit games, not default.

 No, keep Intrusion and Pickpocket.  See above.

 On that basis, BlackMarket could be covered by Trader/Broker and

 From knowing several people who fly (as pilots), I\'d be inclined
 to advise you to substitute "Fixed-Wing Single-Engine" and
 "Fixed-Wing Multiple-Engine" for "Prop" and "Jet".  Especially
 since at the high-end Cessna/Piper, you\'re getting a lot of
 overlap in both technique and performance with low-end Lear.

 ::>Communications (DM) (DH)

 Is this "using a telephone/walkie-talkie" or "using a ham radio
 setup"?  If the latter, not a default.  It\'s also possible that
 we\'re talking "communication" as a set of techniques for effective
 delivery of information, regardless of method, in which case it
 becomes a "science" or a "scholar", and not a default.

 ::>Computer (C)
 ::> -Programming
 ::> -Repair
 ::> -Hacking
 ::> -Applications (DH)

 If by "hacking" you mean breaking into computers, no.  That\'s
 called "cracking" or "being a vandal".  Unless you\'re being
 paid to do it to test the computer security of the company that\'s
 paying you, in which case it\'s "tiger teaming", a specific
 activity that true hackers can engage in with no loss of face.
 Any other legitimate meaning of "hacking" in connection with
 computers is strictly covered by programming - and even crackers
 have to have some knowledge of programming.  For that task, go
 with Programming skill, DM+Intrusion skill or some fraction
 thereof.

 I harp on the distinction between "hacking" and "cracking"
 because (a) many "hackers" (my sense) get offended when you lump
 "crackers" in with us, and (b) there\'s a non-trivial amount of
 overlap between the hacker (both senses) community and the RPG
 community.  Crackers frequently call themselves "hackers" to try
 to share in the true glory of the name, which some of them might
 even understand; all they succeed in doing is contaminating the
 name in the eyes of the public.

 Computer.  While a computer designer must be able to program, not
 every programmer can design a computer - not even a virtual
 machine.  Allow Computer Design skill for tasks that require
 programming skill, but not \\vice-versa\\.

 No, keep separate.  Sensor Ops may not tell you everything you
 need to know.  You may also need tools and techniques not
 available to the planetographer.  This would be a skill that a
 "Belter" has - and "Belter" is an occupation, not a skill.

 ::>***MERCANTILE SKILLS************************
 ::>[I\'d like formal definitions of the skills below, I\'m not sure what they

 ::>Administration

 Probably should be a "Professional" skill; it\'s needed even in
 non-mercantile contexts.  I read it as being the ability to manage
 an organization and the information needed to make that
 organization function effectively.

 ::>Bargain

 The ability to manipulate the perceived value of one side of an
 exchange relative to the other, through non-coercive techniques.
 Could legitimately be a specific application of "Persuasion".

 ::>Broker

 The ability to act for another in trade.  Includes knowing what a
 fair price is, and being willing to buy and sell using your own
 funds at that fair price to close a transaction.  (i.e., if the
 fair price for the load of foodstuffs you brought in is 6000
 Cr/Tonne, but nobody is offering more than 5300, the broker should
 be able to buy from you at 5700, and hold on to it until the local
 price rises enough for him to sell at a profit.  Similarly, that
 same broker will stock up on merchandise when the price is low,
 and sell to you below the prevailing price, but still at a profit,
 if the prevailing price is unacceptably high.  In this way, he
 influences the market (smoothing out the long-term graph) in
 proportion to his holdings and capital.)

 ::>Steward (D) [where does this go? Professional Skills? Other Skills?]

 I see this as a "Professional" skill - it is the skills necessary
 for personal service (in the sense of servants in a filthy-rich
 person\'s mansion - butler, maid, bath girl/boy, hair stylist,
 manicurist, social calendar arranger, and so on).  It also
 encompasses certain aspects of Customer Service (i.e., handling
 multiple people, arranging personal services, dealing with
 complaints, etc.)

 ::>Trader

 Knowledge of what goods are generally available or generally in
 demand in which locations, and what quality of brokerage service
 is available.

 There\'s been some discussion of this.  Languages learned as you
 did should _not_ count against skills, but any learned after
 starting career resolution _should_ count against skills.  I also
 lean toward classification of language groups, with (say)
 Spanish-3 giving Portuguese-2 and Italian-0.5 and such.

 ::>Perception (D) [I don\'t like the idea of a seperate Observation skill.
 ::>The argument was good, and I too am a good observer but bad perceiver,

 No, I buy the argument.  Perception is _not_ observation, and if
 you ever study police work from the inside, you\'ll see just how
 different they are.

 No, Reconnaissance is perfectly OK.

In my opinion this is an honest mistake that CT\'s designers made. By
far the worst offense was in computers but that was understandable
because in 1983 a cheap and powerful computer was a Digital PDP-11 and
the model of computing was time-sharing one powerful CPU. CT assumed a
linear evolution of computers along this model e.g. a more powerful
single CPU system, CT didn\'t anticipate the paradigm shift to a cheap
processor on every desk and communications in between model that we
have today. In 1977 the PC was little more than a toy with no
applications to take it from hobbiest circles that it occupied so who
could have guessed that in 1983 IBM would take the hobbiest toy and
turn it into a business toy sparking the entire microprocessor
industry. 

I do hope that the starships of T4 take advantage of cheap local
microprocessor controlled technology and networks much as cars and
racing sailboats do today. But I cannot blame them for not seeing this 
technology in 1977.

I\'m not sure whether I have or not but I think that my players
knew that part of my job as GM was to keep the players motivated
towards finding "the prize." If it seemed like they weren\'t
getting anywhere for a long time they understood that they would
eventually get a helpful hint from the ref along the way. I
started my favorite Traveller campaign in 1983 with the
"Twilight\'s Peak" adventure. At this time they were able to cheat
just by walking six blocks to hobby store and flipping through the
adventure themselves. This is going to be the problem with any
canned adventure or "for Referee\'s only" text.

In fact I\'m fairly certain that if a player got out of hand 
enough to cheat I know that some of my players would have found a 
way to "fix the problem" themselves (probably by killing the 
character in question). This was a much bigger threat than I 
could ever bring to bear.

Just a thought, but why would there be ANY data in the databanks.  
You\'d think just about all data except the fact that there is a star 
in such and such an area would be lost after 1700 years.  I doubt 
that Sylea & surrounds would have data of any kind other than 
positions, and class of stars for worlds in for example the Vland sector.  
I\'ve always viewed the rise of Sylea as kind of an intergalactic 
Renaissance coming out of the Dark Ages.  If this is a valid model 
(maybe it\'s not), then its doubtful Sylea is going to know much of 
anything about a lot of worlds...even obsolete information, and the 
pocket empires on the fringes are going to know even less.

Thoughts?

True.  Players in RPG\'s tend to have a rather direct way of dealing

Sounds interesting, I may have to pick up that copy at my local library.  I
just love Popular Science, it always seems a good place to look for game
ideas I find :)

This is the problem with all sci-fi games\\tv shows.  Look at Star Trek.  The
original series Star Trek communicators that were supposed to be the best
the 23rd century had to offer are now large compared to the portable phones
of today (they now have ones you can actually wear!).  

Computers, however, I find by far the hardest thing to keep up to date with.
When Traveller was released, computers low-power, and not much good at doing
anything.  However, nowadays, computers advance at an extraodinary pace (The
486DX4\\66 I bought 18 months ago is now completely out of date, as is a
double-speed CD-ROM), and it is hard for science ficition to keep up.  I
mean, within a few years, human civilization has jumped a tech level on the
electronics side of things definietely.  

Actually, that gives me an idea.  Here, are using CT tech levels, my opinion
of our current levels.

Personal Weaponry: 7
Armour: 8
Heavy: 6-7
Computers:  (not sure on this one)
Communications: 6 (though I think 7 or 8 would be Internet)
Water Transport: 7
Land Transport:  7
Air Transport:  7
Space Transport:  7
Energy:  6 (capability for 7, but it\'s not widely used)

Avergae Technological Level for Earth:  7

Any comments on this?

This seems to be a logical model, a Renaissance, with a culture rising
from it that is remarkably similar to 18th century Terra.

Sure!  :)  I consider the Traveller tech levels to be a set of numerical 
representations of levels at which various technologies are achieved /on 
average/.  I ignore the earth-year equivalents given in the last column 
on the chart, and just consider the various tech levels to be 
independent of eachothr.  That is, Earth happens to have advanced in 
computer technology faster than the "average" world which has achieved 
tech level 8.  

Each culture is going to have its own mix of technologies, depending on 
where their emphasis lies.  The United States has had, for a number of 
decades, an emphasis on military technology, for instance.  A less 
warlike culture might be at tech level 8 for medical technology 
purposes, for instance, while remaining at tech level 5 in military 
weapons.  

Sure, the CT tech level chart needs some minor fixes, but it\'s not as bad 
as it might, at first, appear.

With consistent formating and a set of well defined abbreviations the
same info could be presented in just a few more lines.  We aren\'t talking
about loosing a "ton" on non-technical info.  The savings in space
just aren\'t _that_ dramatic.

I guess, in the end, Imperial Games is going to have to decide if they
want give things in a way that is a bit better for long time players
while risking turning off new players who might be interested in the
game.

With respect, no. What I\'m saying is that theological literacy and
`religious knowledge\' are a function of education and (maybe)
intelligence. The applicable, transferable skills gained from the practice
of religion are something else -- Fast Talk, Persuasion, Admin,
Streetwise, Psychology, even Science (in a technocratic religion) or
Forgery/Bribery (in a mercantile one, like that of Nedra in the Belgariad).
Rob Prior\'s complaint that people don\'t really take the 
intellectual side of things seriously -- or can\'t -- is something I would 
translate into game terms as: many people who profess a faith are in fact 
`only\' part of a culture. If the game is going to have Religion skill, you 
ought to have Vilani skill, 46 different Vargr skills... not entirely a 
facetious idea, incidentally.

Now, while I\'m sure I\'d rate at least Religion-1 (Christian), that is a
function of being relatively intelligent and over-educated; my ability to
debate things religious is a function of scientific training, background
knowledge etc.. In other words, religion is part of my educational
development and inseperable from it. This is why I\'d make PCs committed to
a religion make the occasional roll vs. Education, rather than inventing
another skill, or I\'d just invent the occasional task. (Maybe there should
be some suggestions about `rolls for casual knowledge\' e.g. they are
usually Difficult, Edu -- or Routine, Edu, Computer with the aid of a
suitable database -- and 1 difficulty lower if the character is
particularly knowledgeable, e.g. an ex-Navy officer on naval history.)

To go back to our Traveller example, if I were really well-informed about 
Christianity (debatable) then I wouldn\'t rate History or Sociology skill 
- -- it\'d be historical or sociological (or theological) `facts\' I knew.
If I were a trained theologian (I\'m not), I would probably have History or 
Sociology skill, because those would be *transferable* skills, methods of 
working and understanding concepts that can be used in other fields, 
wherever they were gained.

I don\'t see why it shouldn\'t *be* History, a/a. The area of knowledge is 
religion, but the set of skills applied to that area are History and 
Sociology (say). Religion here is not a skill but a subject of skill.

I think that that is the point.  Your archiologist\'s skill is nothing BUT
history.  Not being motivated by faith, service, or any need to  support the
"Sect of the Tea Set", he is just an historian.  The Religion skill, IMHO,
should apply to those skills not otherwise covered by other skills required
to actualy BE a priest.  An expert in helenistic religions might be
History-4.  A priest of Athena would be Religion (Helenistic) -4 .  I would
use it more (in an adventure context) as a more limitted form of Leadership
or Persuasion.

I totally agree with you. Isn\'t IG, however, going to package MMT as a
single book, either hardcover or softcover? I\'d much prefer a boxed set,
with a "players" manual, that would cover character generation,
resolution of personal combat, etc., and a "referee\'s" manual that would
cover the rest, including at least one chapter with background info on the
Traveller universe for newcomers. I believe this is the way the original
Traveller:2300 was packaged, and (IMHO) was the only good thing about
that game :-)

I think it\'s up to you to come up with your own character\'s history, and
either case could apply. The character could have a religion skill because
he or she is highly interested in the topic or is a religious person, or he or
she could have the skill because the character\'s parents forced the
character to go to a religious school for the first 18 years of the
character\'s life.

In either case, the religion skill would be warranted, and could be of use
in several situations (like being on a world with a Theocratic government,
perhaps).

*Definitely* agree, as that\'s how the FAA and the International
equivalent do it too. Multi-engine is a *much* different skill than
single engine, but Jet/prop isn\'t near as much difference.

One thing though. "Test Pilot" ought to be in there somewhere. It\'s a
lot different than ordinary piloting.

And Aeroponics. There really is such a thing, and it\'s much better
suited to zero-g than hydroponics. Better suited for shipboard too, due
to the reduced mass.

I agree with Marc Miller\'s decision to *seperate* "first Aid" (up thru
EMT) and Medicine. I\'ve had fairly extensive first aid training, and I
know some folks with EMT, Nursing and medical training. Medical and
"first aid" *do* belong seperate. The skills are *not* the same. In
fact, many doctors who aren\'t trained in emergency medicine aren\'t any
better than First Aid 1! Likewise, an EMT\'s training is very
specialized. 

I *would* say that Medical skill can be *used* as First Aid 1. And
*maybe* First Aid can be used as Medical 1. And Medical skill should
include "Nursing" (start with it in fact)

As for First Aid being a default, remember, this is for *characters*.
They *should* get a "no penalty" (but no bonus either) to try to do
first aid.

He\'d not understand the electrical system. But given that compressed
air (from bellows) was used to operate some types of "toys" for nobles,
and that gunpowder was in use, he\'d be able to figure out a lot more
than you might think. The carbeurator works on principles he\'d known.
Ditto for the valves, crankshafts etc. 

So as long as the ignition and timing were ok, he could figure out
anything else. :-)

Space suits can be built with WWI (or possibly even Civil War)
technology. Other than that, I agree.

An atlatl (aka woomera aka throwing stick) is a long stick with a
"hook" sticking out near the end. The "hook" fits into a notch on the
end of a spear. 

 /==================>    <-spear
/======================  <-atlatl

You grasp the end that\'s near the spear head and use it to throw the
spear. What it does is effectibely make your arm longer, thus *greatly*
increasing the lever arm. This makes the spear go faster and hit harder.
It makes a *big* difference and was invented independently at least 3
times.

Personally, I\'d go with a "thrown missile" skill that broke down into
chunks like this:

rock/grenade/etc
spear
  Atlatl
bow/crossbow
sling
  staff sling (a staff with a sling on the end)
special (boomerang, shuriken, knives, etc)

BTW slings and staff slings were used until fairly late in the middle
ages and *revived* for a while around WWI for throwing grenades
farther. The rifle grenade and RPG ended this. But it\'s still something
"hi tech" a character could do with a "lo tech" skill!

Crossbows don\'t out range bows. They are just easier to use.

hammer/mace do *not* work like cudgels, or staffs, due to the weight
being concentrated at the end. And it makes a difference wether it\'s a
one hand (short) weapon, a two hand (longer) or a pole arm (yes, they
mace pole arm maces!)

Axes probably go in a similar progression from one-hand thru poleaxe.
BTW, someone who can use an axe can use a mace at about the same skill
level. But going the other way doesn\'t work as well (it matters more
which way the axehead is oriented).

But for simplicity you could probably combine the axe/mace/hammer
sequences. 

(In case you hadn\'t guessed I\'m in the SCA :-)

"Library Science" is what you get if you have a high Research skill. :-)

Trust me, after five years of studying in university and a BA to back me up
there\'s a lot more to archaeology than history and religion.  Remember, 99%
of humanities development occured before the advent of writing or religion.
This puts it into the relm of behavioural science, interpolation and just
plain guess work.  There\'s more to being an archaeologist than picking up a
book and saying, I\'m an archaeologist.  Did you know one of the courses I
took included how to hot wire a car?  True story, you\'re in the middle of no
where and some goober loses the key\'s what are you going to do?  Don\'t buy a
car with a locking stearing wheel that\'s for sure.

Archaeologists are the cowboy\'s of science.

Okay, I think I see the difference.  I\'m using Religion to talk about
theological studies, while you\'re talking about using Religion as
practicing and participating in a religion.  That\'s my mistake,
as has been pointed out "Theology" would probably have been a better
term to use.

It could be History, but then again, it could also be Theology.  It
should apply to more than just History, but it would be more limited
in scope.  It could be like Xenobiology.  While you could break that
down to Biology, Liason (bedside manner), First Aid, etc...,
Xenobiology infers other nuances.  Theology could be viewed in much
the same manner.

	If you don\'t have a religion skill, what are you going to tell all
those people who are taking Religious Studies and Theology courses?  That
what they\'re learning is really just general knowledge (based on INT/EDU),
or that they should be in the History or Sociology departments?  Theology,
like many other skills in Traveller, is an area of knowledge.  One\'s faith
does not necessarily come into it.  One does not really gain any skills
from being a member of a certain faith (at least no more than one gets
from being part of a certain culture, and we can\'t have a skill for each
one of those).  But one does gain special and extensive knowledge from
studying Theology, which is an area of research much like sociology,
history and anthropology, but which has its own domain. 

	A preist might have skills like Orate, Liaison and so on, but
these are not "Theology".  Theology is an area of study with its own
particular emphasis.  It is not history, nor anthroplogy, but a field on
its own.  One can debate the "usefulness" of this skill, but one can do so
with many others.  I think Theology definately has a place in Traveller.

        Absolutely.  The Sylean\'s knowledge of former Imperial Space, and
that\'s a lot of space, would be limited to what was known at the height of
the Second Imperium/Rule of Man, some Fifteen Centuries before hand.  Now
assuming that their original data bases have remained intact for 1500 years,
a fact which in the first place may well be something of a streatch there\'s
a awful lot that can happen in 1500 years, not to mention language drift,
culture change and warfare, lets face it the Vargr and Aslan weren\'t just
sitting around at this time looking across the borders thinking "Oh those
poor humans.  Let\'s give them a bit of a breather for now and turn our
attentions elsewhere."  Pardon me but if I was a Vargr captian or an Aslan
Iheati I think the first thing in my mind would be, "Power Vacuum and well
developed worlds ripe for the taking.  Yee Haww!  Saddle up the ponies tex
we\'re gonna have us a good time tonight."

        Returning to the areas that were Imperial at that time would be a
lot like returning to the Wilds in TNE.  No one knows just what the hell is
out there but expect wierdness and lots of it.  The only advantage the
Sylean\'s have over the RC is they didn\'t have their tecnoligical base
stripped completely away and they don\'t have to worry about Vampire Fleets.
Of course they do have to worry about canibalisic natives, pirates,
marauders, evil dictators, and some kind of odd wobbly thing that\'s made the
entire spinward marches disappear.

        Imagine the knowledge that\'s been lost.  Look at how much the
Greeks, Roman\'s and Egyptians knew three thousand years ago and compare it
to how much we didn\'t know one thousand years ago.  We lost a lot of
information in a very short time, and generally speaking we were just to
damn close minded for 500 years to even imaging that their might have been
other possiblities.  Of course when the church told you, you were going to
hell if you though up something new it kind of put the kibosh on any great
thinking.  "Go to hell -- remain ignorant -- go to hell . . . I think I\'ll
remain ignorant."

        Though few people are going to admit it T4 is just TNE set in an era
where the collapse hasn\'t been as all encompassing and total.  I think I
might like this after all.  "High didalee dee a pirates life for me."  My
question is how will tasks be resolved?

At least the background info for each mililieu is seperate from the

As someone who probably qualifies as a long time player, I think
the problem with TNE was the dumb background (this was it for
me) or people just prefering the old rules.  You can always
just stick a profile at the end of the planet/character/etc.

    'body' => '	Hi all.  Sorry if this topic bores some of you, but it fascinates 
me.  I think it is very important for an RPG to have a proper skills 
list.  For those of you who are less interested, I\'ve tried to minimize 
the length of this message.  I\'d consider moving this to the GDW-Beta 
list, except that I think it would get lost in the FF&S flood.  For those 
of you who are interested and wish to give me a point-by-point or 
otherwise lengthy reply, please respond to me directly so others don\'t 
have to pore through the long messages.  If you made a suggestion before 
and isn\'t implemented here, it doesn\'t necessarily mean I disagree with 
you, it may mean I simply forgot, so suggest it again if you think it\'s 
important.

	Below is "Mark III" of my skill list.  Again revised based on 
comments by various people.  Main points include:

o	The social sciences have been included in the form of Economics 
	and Political Science skills.
o	Geology is still included, but is now called Planetology to make 
	it more "universal".
o	Theology is still included as an area of study.  I consider this 
	to be nothing more controversial than the inclusion of sociology or 
	anthropology, and (IMO) it is not replaceable by any other social
	science as it is a discipline all its own.
o	The "Scholar" vs. "Science" distinction has been eliminated.  Not 
	sure how it would be implemented in the game anyway...
o	Weapon skills have been re-organized in line with several comments.

o	Default skills have been eliminated for the time being.  I now 
realize that default skills are a product of one\'s profession, culture 
and homeworld characteristics.  Instead of trying to take all this into 
account in a skills table, I feel default skills should be part of 
"background packages" or lists of automatic skills given based on career 
choice (e.g., Army characters get Rifle-0, Navy get Vacc-0).  I\'ve heard 
that such background packages will be part of MMT, and automatic skill 
have always been part of it, so I think this would be a better way to 
handle things.

o	Cascade skills have been revised.  I have not cascaded all the 
skills that I feel should be subdivided.  This is for two reasons: 1) It 
makes for too many skills, 2) It makes skills less likely to be useful.  
For instance, a character is not likely to be able to use his "Farming" 
skill often in adventuring.  This becomes even more unlikely if one 
subdivides it (even though there are good arguments for doing so in terms 
of realism).


SKILLS BY TECH LEVEL:  I think skills should be understood to be mediated 
by the character\'s native TL.  Someone from a TL-5 world might have 
mechanic skill, but he won\'t be able to repair starship turrets (At least 
not  easily.  I\'d say give a -DM equal to the TL difference).  
Differences in tech level which are too great should preclude any attempt 
at using the skill, at the GM\'s discretion.

SKILLS BY CULTURE/SPECIES:  Skills should also be mediated by the culture 
in which they are learned.  Someone learning medicine in the Sylean 
Federation will not likely be able to use their skills as effectively on 
other species.  Negative DMs would be given for alien surroundings (the 
more alien, the worse the DM).


SKILL GROUPINGS:  Skills are again divided into categories simply for 
organization.  The following sub-groupings are also used:
	(C) Cascade: represents a package of specializations in a 
particular field.  Pick one of them and all others are at 1/2 level.
	(G) Group:  represents a group of related skills.  Pick one of 
them but get level-nil in all others (or level-0 at GM\'s discretion). 
Sometimes, the group will contain cascade skills.
	(RPG) Roleplay it Gomer!:  This notation is a reminder that this 
skill should not replace roleplaying, but add to or enhance it.  Of 
course, this sort of applies to all of them :-).


***WEAPON SKILLS*************************

Archaic Ranged Weapons (G)
	Bow
	Crossbow
	Sling
	Spear Thrower [was Atlatl]

	Notes:
	[IMO Research more-or-less covers Library Science.  Everyone 
who\'s in a field feels that the field should be further subdivided.  I 
has psych as two skill because of this.  It is now just one.]
	[In an interstellar community, Biology is indistinguishable from 
Xenobiology, IMHO.  Just as we study biology over the entire world (and 
not just our own city/country), far future biologists would study biology 
in other ecospheres.  For some lo-tech NPC\'s this skill would be mediated 
by TL and culture, as noted in the intro above.]
	[Astronomy is the science of stellar processes and physics.  
Astrography is like geography, but applies to interstellar nations and 
cultures.]

sure this is not simply a consequence of how we train people on earth?  
For instance, no one learns to fly a copter on earth without learning to 
fly a plane first, but that doesn\'t mean it couldn\'t happen elsewhere. 
Just wondering...]

I have not included Skill Clusters such as those used in MT (e.g., the 
Space Cluster has Pilot, Nav, Engineer, Gunner, etc.).  I felt these were 
sort of redundant for the purposes of a skill list, though I would like 
to see them in CharGen for MMT.

That\'s it.  Once again, apologies to the uninterested.  As always, I 
welcome all inputs.

Happy Travelling,

Religious Scholar


Re-enlistment:  If the character has Admin skill they may use it as a
positive DM when attempting
to re-enlist.  A roll of 2 always means force retirement.  There is no
mandatory re-enlistment on a
roll of 12.

Skill eligibility:  During the first term of service the character is
eligible for two skills.  Each term
after that they are eligible for only one skill.  The character is also
eligible for one skill with each
distinction earned.

* Language Skill:  While not official canon it has been used in some of the
Alien modules.  The  *
religious Scholar would no doubt learn to read some long dead language to
help further their

Distinctions:  A character is eligible for only one distinction per term of
service.

Automatic skills:   Upon enlistment Language - 1.  Upon receiving first
distinction Admin - 1.

Mustering Out:  One benefit roll is allowed per term of service.  characters
who have received one
distinction are allowed one additional roll.  Characters who have received
two distinctions are
allowed two additional rolls.  Characters who have received three or more
distinctions are
allowed three additional rolls.  A maximum of three rolls are allowed on the
cash benefits table; all
additional rolls must be taken on the material benefits table.  Characters
who have served five or
more terms may add 1 to their rolls on the cash benefits table.  Characters
who have received two

****************************

Religious Scholar Example:

**Hodgie, having finished school, decides that studying the long dead
Thistian religion would be
a grand way to spend his life.  Taking stock of himself [ player rolls 7, C,
7, 3, A, 9 ] he finds his
UPS is 7C73A9.  Not to bad.  He visits his home planets university and
attempts to gain
admission to the school of theology.  [ Player rolls a 6 (dm +2 for Educ +8)
giving an 8 ]  Hodgie
manages to pass the schools entrance exam.

**First Term:  His first term of service is rather uneventful.  [ For
survival player rolls a 9 (dm + 2
for Social Standing 8+) giving an 11]  But Hodgie has not yet distinguished
himself in his
published findings.  [ For distinction player rolls a 4 ]  The good news is
that Hodgie is able to
continue his studies for another year.  [ For re-enlistment player rolls a 7
].  Hodgie is eligible for
two skills this term plus automatically receives one level of Language
skill.  [ The GM tells the
player that the Language-1 skill is in Lagian, the Thistians long dead
language]  Working as a
scholar provides few physical challenges so to keep fit Hodgie takes up
martial arts as a hobby.  
[ Player rolls a 5 on skill table 2 \'Brawling\' (The GM takes note of this
and later creates an NPC
for Hodgies marital arts instructor!) ]  

Hodgies work also requires long sessions on the computer analyzing cryptic
ancient writings.  
[ Player rolls a 1 on table 3 \'Computer\' (GM takes note of this and later
details where these
ancient writings came from and how the university got a hold of them!) ]

** Second Term:  During his second four years of study, while in the field
looking for more of
those ancient writings, Hodgie has a very close call.  [ For survival player
rolls a 3 (dm +2 for
Social Standing 8+) giving a 5 (GM takes note of this and determines which
planet Hodgie was
on! ) ] 

Obviously the close call was worth it because Hodgie earned the distinction
of his peers!  
[ For distinction player rolls a 10 (dm +1 for one previous term) giving an
11 (GM takes note of
this and later determines that Hodgie uncovered the fabled long lost Spear
of the first Thistain
Saint!) ].     

Hodgie is eligible for two skills this term plus receives an automatic skill
level in Admin.  

His discovery of the long lost Thistian Spear has attracted the attention of
a powerful Noble, who
sponsors Hodgie for an increase in Social Standing.  [ Player rolls a 6 on
table 4 \'+1 Social
Standing\'  (GM selects or creates the Noble and develops suitable
background.  Hodgie now has
at lest one powerful friend!) ]

Now that Hodgie has been with the school of theology for several years he
has been asked to take
on a student and teach her the ropes.  [ Player rolls a 2 on table 4
\'Instruction\'  (GM creates an
NPC student for Hodgie and save her for later use!) ]  

Also because of his distinction Hodgie now finds it easier to get grant
money for further studies,
but learning to deal with the applications is a pain!  [ Automatic skill
level in \'Admin\' (GM creates
several companies and governments willing to fund studies into the Thistian
religion!) ]

With everything looking up for Hodgie bad news is hard to take!  [ For
re-enlistment player rolls a
2 \'Forced retirement!\' (GM takes note of this and secretly determines that a
mysterious rival had
gotten Hodgie kicked out by blackmailing the head of the theology school! ) ]

**Mustering out:  Hodgie is eligible for 3 mustering out benefits.  [
Players makes all three on the
Material Benefits table.  The three rolls are 4, 5 and 5 \'Mid passage\' and
\'Weapon\' twice.  Player
selects a revolver and then takes a skill in revolver ]

**Recap:  Hodgie is now 26 years old.  His UPS is 7C73AA and he  has the
following skills:  
Language - 1 (In Lagian), Instruction - 1, Admin -1, Brawling -1, Computer
- -1 and Revolver -1.
His only possessions are a revolver and a middle passage.  He spent eight
years studying the
ancient Thistain religion and recently made an import discovery in his
field.  For which he was
rewarded with social advancement.

He has three NPC contacts, his martial arts instructor, a powerful noble and
his former student. 
But he also has a rival who is black mailing the head of his former theology
school.  

Also, Hodgie knows of several companies that might be willing to provide
private funding for
more research, if he can make his case to them.

The problem with using negative DMs comes when the character starts 
improving the skill in a different cultural environment.  This is why I 
use the "Xenoqualifiers" system I posted a while back.  Imperial and 
Aslan Streetwise, for example, are two different skills.

This is interesting.  Rather than creating a new skill, Theology, or 
somesuch, you have broken it down into the sub-skills involved in the 
pursuit of a career in theology.  Things like languages, computer use, 
admin, instruction, and survial are certainly useful to the theologian.  

Hmmm.  This means that the knowledge of theology is implied rather than 
explicit as far as skills are concerned.  I\'m trying to think of where 
this would be a disadvantage...hmm....okay, let\'s say Hodgie, in the 
course of his adventuring career, meets up with a group of people who 
have been without outside contact for so long that they actually practice 
the supposedly dead religion he has been studying.  However, through the 
years the religion has evolved a bit, so isn\'t exactly like the religion 
he knows.  Perhaps the ref would want the player to make a task roll to 
determine whether he recognizes the religion as the one he has been 
studying, modified by centuries of use.  This would require a skill level 
to be used as a DM. Hmmm.

Dunno, doesn\'t sound like a really good example to me.  Perhaps someone 
else can come up with a more compelling reason to make theology an 
explicit skill.  But, until then, your method seems workable to me.

[Character generation tables snipped]

> Religious Scholar Example:

This is a really good example.  I never worried about NPCs that might 
logically come out of the character generation process until I started 
playing the Hero system, with its emphasis on dependant NPCs, Hunteds, 
etc.  After that, it just made sense to include them in Traveller as 
well. I\'m glad I\'m not the only one!

BTW, this would be a great addition to the Merchant Captain Alexander 
Jamison character creation example (or whatever is included in T4): 
noting where a referee might, if s/he chooses, logically infer NPCs that 
should be generated based on the events in the character generation 
process.  I think it would give beginning referees a great opportunity to 
help players create more life-like characters, and imbue the 
campaign-universe with more realism as well.  When the campaign starts, 
the characters would not just be experienced - they would have at least a 
minor group of friends, enemies, and contacts.  A frame of reference in 
the social order, if you will.

> IMO details and background are what make for an interesting charator, not
> pages of little used (or understood) skills!  

I agree.  While a humongous list of skills makes for a more realistic 
system, there is a point at which additional skills confer little or no 
benefit to the majority of players.  The little black books had too few 
skills, certainly.  But CT as a whole had just about the right amount of 
skills.  

I added a few in my campaigns, but I think that is something each referee 
should be prepared to do as needed.  I see little benefit in IG providing 
referees with an exhaustive skill list, since that means many of those 
skills will never be used by most referees.

Each basic character type should have skills avaiable to him or her which 
provide the /majority/ of skills a character in that profession would 
logically have.  Yes, I believe it is unnecessary to provide for every 
skill every character type could ever possibly use.  There are so very 
many fields of study open to a Scholar character that deliniating them 
all would be preposterous - the list would probably be equal in number to 
all other skills in the system.  And, again, most of those skills would 
go unused in most campaigns.

I remember when AD&D started using the Proficiency and Specialization 
systems.  It added a lot of detail to the game, but it was (IMO) at the 
expense of playability.  In AD&D\'s case, that was just one more step down 
the road of complexity - and it was already well down that road.  I\'d 
really rather not see Traveller follow suit.

The CT system, at the time of the introduction of The Traveller Book, had 
the best approach as far as complexity is concerned.  The Book had 
everything needed in order to play the game - and all systems were quick 
and simple - very playable, and realistic enough.  If a group wanted to 
introduce more complexity and realism into the game, they could buy Books 
4-8, the Supplements, and/or various other expansion modules by GDW and 
the licensees.  

Complexity was completely optional, and the Traveller Book was a 
self-contained role-playing game (that is, there were no systems missing, 
although each system favored playability over realism).  Perfect.

The list of skills that Marc Miller recently posted appeared, to me, to 
provide plenty of skills for the basic book.  As necessary, when 
supplementary material comes out that requires new skills (ie, if a 
Citizens of the Imperium II or whatever comes out), it would make sense 
to expand the skill list.  Beyond that, I see little use for an attempt 
to make the skill system perfectly complete.

Comments welcome!

Assuming arguendo that the Dark Ages to Renaissance model is valid, then
Sylea would have all sorts of information -- true, false, wildly

I think that the explanation is in Adventure 1, The Kinunir.  The Shionthy
system has a lot of "contra-terrene" matter, which I think is anti-matter.
So it\'s very dangerous for ships.  Why it should be crime to put yourself in
danger, I don\'t know.  I\'ve always believed that the contra-terrene asteroid
belt was once a planet, destroyed by weapons beyond our ken during the Final
War, and the goverment doesn\'t want anyone examining the site without its

Thanks Derek, for correcting the first posting.  As an archaeological
graduate, and in terms of Traveller, I\'d have to argue that one of the
Imperium\'s primary archaeological fields would be "Ancients Studies", and
of course for that you\'d have no written history to go on.  I\'d suggest
that advanced "non-destructive site recording" and "artifact
interpretation" would be at the top of the 56th Century\'s archaeological
skills.  Certainly for my own degree, only a third or so was spent on
history (mainly Roman), the rest of the course was primarily concerned with
the techniques and development of archaeological excavation and the
preservation and social interpretation of finds.  Never hot wired any cars
though...    ...is it the same as doing it to an air-raft?

With Jump drive, it it only takes setting up observatories in a couple
of adjacent hexes to get accurate stellar positions out to *thousands*
of hexes. And it only takes a bit more work to get stellar type. 

A few years of observation of stars that are determined to be close
enough to worry about can determine things like presences of gas
giants, and even mainworlds. But the absolute *best* that you\'d be able
to do is determine mass, size, rough atmospheric composition (ie you
can\'t detect taints and could be off by one "density" category), and
very rough hydro (say +/- 30%)

I\'m working on a write-up of this sort of thing that may wind up in the
rule book.

Maybe you can send me a copy of the book? :-)

Anyway, here\'s what I came up with:

                           Navigation

Interplanetary navigation uses principles that date back to the 20th
century (Old Terran). Much like the Global Positioning System (GPS) of
that era, most systems in the Imperium have a number of satellites
scattered widely around the system. Each satellite broadcasts a data
stream consisting of its ID, its position relative to the mainworld,
and a precise atomic clock time.

Onboard a ship, a special receiver unit takes the data from 3 or more
such signals and integrates it to determine the ship\'s position to an
initial accuracy of 100 km or less. by using more signals and 10
minutes or so of listening to them, a ship can get a position to
accuracies of 1 km or better.

A portion of the data from the satellites is encrypted. Ships equipped
with the proper decryption circuit can get the 1 km accuracy
immediately. Such gear is reserved for the Imperial military and it is
a criminal offense to posses it without authorization.

In time of war the entire signal is encrypted, thus forcing non-
miltary users to go back to the methods used in undeveloped systems.
These amount to using the ship\'s radar and/or telescope to locate the
planets and determine the ship\'s position from these sightings with the
aid of an ephemeris for the system. This can take 30 minutes or longer
to get a fix that\'s only good to about 1 light second, unless they are
within a few light seconds of a planet.

This gives the Imperial military a distinct advantage when they jump
from or to a system equipped with SPS (System Positioning System)
satellites.


                         Imperial Survey

The Imperial Survey was established to help map both the existing
territory of the Imperium and the surrounding areas that had been lost
during the long night.

The mapping project started by establishing a pair of observatories in
the outskirts of a pair of systems one parsec apart. The line between
them became the baseline for the Imperial maps. (My maps are in
storage, so I can\'t check this, but it\'d be nice if one could be
"Capital" and another the system immediately "above" or "below" it, if
such exist).

The observatories each had large telescopes used for sky mapping.  They
also had a LARGE laser aimed in the direction of the other observatory.
The lasers were modulated with a signal similar to that used by the SPS
satellites.

Once the laser beam reached the other observatory (3.26 years after it
started), comparing the time information with the clocks at the
observatory gave the distance between them to an accuracy measured in
fractions of a millimeter. For additional accuracy, the time info was
echoed back to the originator over a second channel in the laser link.

Thus, after three and a quarter years, the length of the baseline was
known with incredible accuracy. And after signal info had made a round
trip (7.52 years total), the distance and relative movements of the two
observaties was known exactly.

With this info, the sky survey photos from the two observatories could
be compared for positional differences in the stars (parallax). The
parallax, plus the length of the baseline allowed precise location of
stars even *thousands* of parsecs away. Only stars oscured by dust
clouds and nebula will be hidden.

With positions known, other telescopes studied the nearer stars in the
uknown territory. With careful observations, it is possible to detect
gas giants, and even normal planets or asteroid belts. Even more info
is possible with careful study.

The initial parallax survey determined only position and stellar type
(O,A,B,F,G,K,M, etc). The follow-on surveys of stars can determine
*class* (ie the difference between a G0 and a G9 star) quickly.
Determining presence of gas giants takes a year or so.  Presence of
smaller bodies can take several years, and detecting atmosphere and
hydro (to the limited extent possible by astronomical observation)
takes even longer (a decade?).

This meant that it was determined that the best course would be to have
to survey determine positions, and presences of gas giants *only*, and
send ships to determine the rest. Thus was born the Imperial
Interstellar Scout Service.


                 Interstellar Navigational Grid

As a secondary goal, the Scout Service established a "survey grid" of
beacons that would allow generating even *longer* baselines for
observations, though at lesser accuracy. It also had an unintended
secondary effect of allowing misjumped ships to easily determine where
they were even if there are no nearby stars.

The "grid" consists of extremely powerful transmitters, distributed
throughout a sector. On average, there will be one for every two
sub-sectors. These transmitters send out an ID and a time signal. As
with SPS systems, and the Imperial Baseline, signal comparisons give
distance.

It wasn\'t until a liner misjumped and landed in "empty space" a parsec
from the nearest star, that the other use for these beacons was
invented. The ship had fuel enough for another jump, thanks to being
lucky enough to find a small comet-like body within manuever drive
range. But they didn\'t know *where* to jump, and while they were using
the ships telescope to attempt to match stars to their charts, they
weren\'t certain that they\'d be able to pinpoint their locate before
they ran out of food. (The telescopes on ships are *not* intended for
that sort of work!)

One of the junior communications officers had run out several
kilometers of wire from engineering spares to make an antenna. He was
hoping to be able to pick up an identifiable signal to help with
narrowing down the ships position. A navigotor wandered by as he tuned
past one of the beacons and recognized the signal for what it was.
Within hours they\'d reprogrammed an SPS module to handle the grid
beacon signals. And a week later they popped out of jump near a
starport.

The news of this "miraculous" escape spread quickly, and gear for
determining the ships location in interstellar space by using grid
beacons is now standard emergency gear.

I\'m in agreement here.  Note that I said Sylea and others should know 
stellar positions and stellar classes.  This stuff could be 
discovered by use of astronomy.  Don\'t ask me about the nuts and 
bolts, I\'m a social scientist at heart.

I don\'t know if you\'d know this stuff for systems that were too far 
away though.  It wasn\'t until very recently that somebody found 
planets circling Alpha Centauri, which is practically a next door 
neighbor in stellar terms.  Whether Sylea would know this information 
for the Solomani Rim is doubtful, other than Stellar position, and 
maybe class.  Maybe you can prove me wrong though...

        Sorry to disappoint you, but ... FF&S (suitably renamed) is going to
be the detailed design sequence for MMT, and I\'ve been told to avoid making
changes as I create FF&S Light. Thruster plates *will* continue to be

primary focus, though.

This is truly depressing news. We might as well just call it TNEv2 instead
of T4. Hopefully MM or some other higher up will recognize this as the 1st
step toward recreating the debacle the GDW produced & put a stop to it.
Hopefully.

I hope so.  The whole question of skill level is a really extreame
abstraction forced on the game because it is, well, a game -- not a model of
the real world.  The whole idea of a "History" skill covering even what an
"Historian" knows about history is pretty lame.

One aspect of rules creep that seems to occur is increasing skills
specialization.  Any GM who has more than a superficial knowledge of a field
realizes the lack of precision and tries to correct it.  For example,
professionally I am probably a computer-4.  I do windows clients and
database tuning.  Know a few other bits and pieces about this and that.  In
the office we also have some folks who are computer-4 but their
specialization is GIS systems.  What can we discuss?  The weather.  If I
tried to do their work, I would be about a computer-0.

Creep seems to happen most often in military skills probably because (1) a
lot of gamers are military buffs, or have picked up a fair amount of
military knowledge from gaming and (2) things which can leave my character
dead are VERY interesting.

The result? It seems resonable to have a skill cascade Foward
Observer(Ortillery) but only one History skill as if a professor of
Victorian Social Anthropology could make a meaning statement of New Kingdom
Physical Culture.

What soultion would I propose?  Drag it back -- simplify.  Assume NPC
specialists are specialists (a few side skills for depth, but the lad with
the radio and the laser designator is the FO and that\'s it).  Let players be
generalists.  I would sooner have a player with skill Grunt-5 who can be a
one man army then to have to deal with all gory details (yes, you have
Combat Rifle-17, but that\'s a smoothbore, it doesn\'t count?)

Lets face it.  Studying the ancients in Trav would be like studying the Romans or 
Mayans or Egypians in our century.  It\'s the big stuff that everyone wants to get 
involved in.  However, there\'s a certian dark side to this work.  Because of the 
importance of Ancients sites, at TL21+ there\'s a lot of really important gear lying 
around on these sites, you\'d end up with a political officer and a troop of 
soliders every time you tried to dig up something.  Kinda like working in Mexico or 
Peru.  THe sites would all be mapped insitu with out having to disturb anything, 
just imaging what ground penetrating sensors are like then, wow!  Unfortunately 
in order to recover and study the artifacts you\'d still need to get on your hands 
and knees and dig the place up.  Or in the case of some work I\'ve seen out here 
wait for the D9 to tear the place appart and pick up what\'s left.  Youch that\'s a 
nasty way to work.

Working in europe I wouldn\'t imagine there\'s much call for hot wiring.  You\'re 
never extremely far away from something or some one.  Here in Canada when someone 
loses the keys and the nearest town is 150 miles away someone had better be a 
professional break in artist.  I wonder if air rafts are easy to hot wire...  and I 
wonder if they\'re still using 10cm mason pointing trowels in T4.  We got pretty 
good at throwing those things after two months in the field.

I\'d imagine a trendy department in every University would be something
like a Department of Physics and Antiquities.

Their main specialty would be the analysis of artifacts and their
surroundings, giving clues to where the leading-edge physics of the day
should be heading.  Of course, potential technological spin-offs (not
least in terms of military hardware) would lead to very acceptable
levels of corporate and government funding with the concommittant
decrease in interest in the "purity" of the field ;-)

Academic politics amongst the archaeologist/physicists could get
nasty...

You experience is far from typical.  Most people can\'t memorize what
each of 30 some odd digits means in 20 min without even trying.  I
glad it works so well for you, but the fact is that their use
is going to be a barrier to new players.

Wow, some people just won\'t give up!  What\'s the problem.  There is
now a quick and easy system a al Books 2 and 5 as well as the possible
inclusion of a revised version of FF&S.  In theory everyone should be
happy.

However, that isn\'t the case here.  Is your hate of TNE so great that
you won\'t allow any of it to influence T4?  And how can you even
compare IG to GDW.  If IG did like GDW and not listen to our input,
then we\'d be looking at HG 2.  As it stands, lots of things have been
reverse engineered, mechanics to match the story line, and ease of use
has been incorporated.  You can now create ships as quickly as Books 2
and 5 (and yes, this will be the initial stuff), and eventually all of
us gearheads will be able to get off by designing every nook and
cranny down to the damn glove compartment.

I\'m sorry if I don\'t see a problem other than your attitude.

These things would have to be extremely powerful (to the point of requiring
small stars for power sources), and it would take decades before the "grid"
was useful, due to the delay in propagating the signal accross 30 light
years of space.

This all seems rather wasteful, when there\'s already a grid in place that\'s
usable by anyone, anywhere [*].  All a civilization needs to do is some survey
and calibration work.  There are quite a number of pulsars in the galaxy;
they produce a distinctive radio signal that slowly changes over time,
making it a natural "clock".  The pulsars are powerful enough that their
signals can be detected all over the galaxy.

Using the very-long-baseline observatories mentioned earlier, the exact
locations of the most useful pulsars can be determined.  Benchmarking
surveys both within and outside of Imperial territory can sample the
pulsar\'s signal, so that it\'s "clock" is known with a high degree of
accuracy.

Finally, with all of the information published, any ship, literally anywhere
in the galaxy, that has a set of IISS pulsar charts can determine where it
is in deep space (even in previously-uncharted deep space) with a good
degree of accuracy.  Well, that and a working radio communicator.

It\'s also and adventure hook: PCs in a scoutship could be charged with
performing a benchmarking survey: literally all they have to do is to travel
ten parsecs in a given direction, stopping for a while at each location
along the way to record singnals from the various pulsars.  And return.

The only thing that makes this challenging is that it\'s into relatively
unknown, unexplored territory.  The benchmarking has to be performed before
the survey work starts, so all they\'ve got to work with is a map showing
star locations and the presence or absence of gas giants.


[*] Anyone that writes an adventure crediting (or blaming) Grandfather for
creating pulsars as a private navigational aid had better write a _good_
one!

Absolutely and they do get pretty nasty now just between differing archaeologist 
in the same field.  Richard Leaky and Don Johanson didn\'t speak to each other for 
years because of an intense personal rivalry.

The thing that bothers me is with the plethora of Ancients sites and the vast 
amount of material evidence at these sites that no one has put two and two 
together and figured out the whole Droyne thing.  I mean hell we can find one 
and a half million year old foot prints in east africa and determine that people 
walked them pretty much how they walk now and their feet were essentially the same 
but no one has ever notice the similarities between Droyne architecture and 
functional items and those utilized but the ancients.  Hell even a single chair 
will tell you a lot about the people who create the site.

Derek Stanley

I never had a problem beleiving than no one knew who the Ancients were until I 
read "Secret of the Ancients."  Then a little buzzer went off in my head and said 
pardon me, the Ancients are still alive, living among us an no one has noticed any 
material connection?  So much for the super science of the future.

>and homeworld characteristics.  

There has been some suggestions to include automatic 
default skills based on a charators home planet.  
I know such rules were included in MT and 
Traveller the Next Error but...

My problem with automatic default skills is 
that they are based on the idea that all 
home planets are generic.  

Let me use the following three planets 
from my own campaign to illustrate my opinion.

Example 1.	Vernoa	C550763-5	De, Po

[This idea was shamelessly stolen from Space 1889!]

Several thousand years ago an advanced human 
society built a series of canals on Vernoa.  
The purpose of the canals was to provide 
abundant water to the dessert from melting 
polar ice.  The descendants of those ancient 
humans now live exclusively on the canals.  
Sailing skill is automatic as sail boats 
are the primary means of transportation.  
Also most children learn to swim before 
they learn to walk.

Example 2.	Kamdell	D77A8DB-6	Wa

The government of Kamdell is a very strict 
religious dictatorship based on the worship 
of a vicious marine carnivore.  Any one 
entering the ocean, for any reason, is guilty 
of trasspassing against the gods.  Penalty 
for trasspassing is death.  As a result no 
one goes for a swim here (or more importantly
no one learns to swim here).

Example 3.	Tagus	C9CA553-9	Fl, Ni, Wa

The atmosphere of Tagus is highly insidious 
and will defeat any personal protective measure 
within 6 hours.  The fluid covering the planets 
surface is most defiantly not H2O.  Care to take 
a dip here?  Obviously few if any new borns to 
Tagus will automatically learn to swim.

at TL11 ... preTL-11 ships still use HEPlaR or Fusion.

I\'ll admit it Dave.  I loved TNE.  I hated getting into starship combat because that 
pretty much wasted an afternoon.  But I loved the system, the rules were good, 
providing you didn\'t get hit with a propelled grenade then things got messy, combat 
was easy, the equipment was supurb etc, etc, etc.  I\'ll buy the new system and if I 
think I can apply any of the stuff to my campaign I will.  But I intend to continue 
battling the virus and re-opening the frontiers of civilization.

Inspite of everyone\'s bitching about FF&S I liked it too, it needed to be better layed 
out, but it was essentially an excelent system.  Once you\'d designed something once it 
became really easy after that.  The problem I found was everyone looked at the first 
page, got intimidated and said, I don\'t have time for this.  This was from the same 
people who would happly spent two hours detailing a system out to the last moon of the 
last ice ball.  I can whip together a rifle in under twenty minutes, I can put 
together a starship in under three hours, and I can design a grav tank down to the 
fusion cannon in less than two hours.  Everybody whines about the system but how many 
of them really sat down and tried it as opposed to looking at the tables and getting 
flustered.  There\'s an art to designing equipment, it\'s not just a bunch of numbers on 
a page.  It\'s a living breathing organizm.

"You run into an Imperial Grav Tank."

"What\'s it look like?"

"It\'s square with a turret on top."

"Sounds ugly.  You got a picture?"

"No."

"Can you sketch me a picture."

"No, I just cranked it out ten minutes ago."

There\'s more to designing equipment than just crunching the numbers.  Like I said it\'s 
art and don\'t let anybody else convince you other wise.  A gearhead can crank the 
numbers through, an artist knows what it looks like and makes the pictures and plans 
while doing the work so everyone else knows what it looks like.

The skill numbers should not define the character. His role playing
should define the character. Subtle guidance from the GM will ensure
this. (Some times not so subtle :)

My players, and I when playing, have defined the context that the
skills were acquired in. I have a Barbarian TNE character that has
enforced an Intelligence check on himself every time he is faced with
technology. No prodding from me (the GM). This Barbarian has acquired a
Small Arms skill from another player character who was a Special Forces
Instructor. However, that does not mean that any weapon he picks up, he
knows how to operate. He enforces the unfamiliarity because, he doesn\'t
have the Tech-Level background to figure out that it is the same as the
one the Instructor showed him. In fact, whenever there are new weapons
to be used, the Instructor now takes the time to show him how to use
the weapon. 

IMO the characters *must* use the skills in context to define their
persona. GM\'s *must* enforce that context! The skills issue is moot.
Too many skills only slows down the CharGen process, and that can be
remedied, since the GM should be taking interest in the PC\'s
development anyway. (To gain contextual information!)

 Derek, I\'m slow today.  It took me a while to get your point.  

BUT:

I think the qualifying question for a skill is what tasks would you roll
against it?  You might have learned to hot-wire in Archeology 501, but you
would still not go looking for an archeology prof if you loose your keys.
It just means you picked up streetwise-0 in that term.

The person I was arguing against was trying to claim, as far as I could
tell, that there was no difference between the skill his "staw" archeologist
knew and what a person with a "Theology" skill would know.  I don\'t buy that.

I do but the claim that a scholar should have some non-scholarly skills.  He
rolls his ability to date a site by pottery fragments against Archeology.
To get down into the excavation without spreaining his ankle is still an
agility throw, and surviving the pub crawl the nearby town is still a
Courousing roll.  He might have developed all his abilities while training
and woring as an archiologist -- but they ae seperate skills.

In this case I as GM would determain the roll needed to recognize the
religion.  I would make the roll for the player in secret using the 
number of terms the charator spent studying the religion as a positive DM.  
(In hodgies case the DM would be +2)  The same method can be applied 
to historians or scientists and avoids the need for seprate History skills 
or cultural skills.

>BTW, this would be a great addition to the Merchant Captain Alexander 
>Jamison character creation example (or whatever is included in T4): 

Actually, I based it on the Jamison example from book 1 :-).

As a finial point, I dislike the use of pre printed charator sheets that
list every single skill.  When the charators in my game have at most half 
a dozon skills almost all the page is wasted.  And the sheet doesn\'t reflect 
the fact that I as GM may create and include new skills.

I\'ve always been able to tell the good players from the bad players by looking
at the number of pages it takes to discribe their charators.

The only problem is that any religious scholar should have History skill
too. My problem with CT was that it had just about the right number of
*military* skills.  You can\'t play a decent scientist or scholar in that
system (I\'ve tried, having never had any interest in playing a military
character).  T4 doesn\'t need many more skills and IMHO *shouldn\'t* have
many more skills than CT, but it needs a greater diversity of skills. The
MT skill list was a little long, but had just the right amount of
diversity.

Absolutely, Wow I use that word a lot.  There\'s far more you learn in school than 
just what you\'re studying.  Anyone who just took, [insert appropriate disipline 
here] at university would be a pretty boring fellow.  I know when I was at 
university I took all kinds of courses, some of which were completely unrelated to 
what I was majoring in, why?  You\'d go crazy if all you did all day was look at pot 
sherds.  
	
Anything you do you\'re learning other things while doing so.  I studies archaeology 
while I was in university, what do I do now?  I\'m an on strike environmental 
tester.  Is that what I do, no, I just do that because it\'s steady money, I\'m 
really a writer, a script writer actually I\'m studying to become an assistant 
director and a cameraman.  So there\'s far more going on than would be covered in a 
single career term during character generation or in a single secondary activity 
pick.  Do any of these things relate to skills.  Probably, Writing, Leadership and 
Photography.

I guess perhaps I\'m trying to justify a skill in a disipline that I feel very 
strongly about, perhaps I\'m getting way off track here.  The point being there\'s 
more to archaeology than history and there\'s far more to history than just the 
written word.  We here in North America should be far more aware of that than any 
other culture on the face of the planet.  Where I sit now, the Left Coast, 
Vancouver to be precise, history only began 150 years ago, recorded history.  
Before that there are no written records, just the archaeology.  The first thing I 
did when I visited England was to hit the nearest church graveyard.  First 
tombstone I saw was placed there 300 years before Canada even existed on a map.  
You have no idea as to how young that makes us out here on the west coast.  The 
Oldest standing structure out here is a trade shop at Fort Langley, just slightly 
better than 130 years old.

And surviving a propper archaeological pub craw is probably more of a test of 
endurance than carousing.  You\'ve never been to a party till you\'ve been at an 
archaeological mixer.  Man those things are wild.  It took us half a bottle of sake 
to determine that 9 seconds on high was the perfect temperature for a shot glass in 
a microwave and boiler makers I\'m never seen so many boiler makers at a single 
outting.  I\'m getting misty just thinking about it.  On of the guys I worked with 
was working in Alberta, in the space of a single field season he was chased by 
bison on an ATV, and man can those suckers move, fled from a train tunnel to avoid 
being crushed and a couple of other thing\'s I\'d care not to speak of.

Remember if you take archaeology as a skill on a back woods planet never ever walk 
up to someones door with a clip board, it\'s a good way to get shot.

Hooray for Leonard finally mentioning library science!

I totally agree!  Perhaps I should finally own up, in public,
to having tried my own hand at bits of rules.

Now I appreciate that no one is particularly going to want to
adventure as a librarian character in the 57th century
(although I\'ve quite enjoyed it!) so I won\'t bore you with
the usual char gen.

However, what about the scheme I\'ve been trying to work out
for a ULP.  (Yes another one, sorry if you\'re not fond of
them!)

A universal library profile.

It seems to me that the one thing that was somewhat
overlooked in Traveller (should I grovel to Marc seperately?)
was a consideration of exactly what format all the wonderful
\'library data\' that existed might come in.

The ULP (in five or six digits) enables referees to see what
is available (and how, and to whom, etc. etc.) for any world
visited whether hi-tech, lo-tech or anything in between.

I don\'t know if this of interest to x-boat readers but I\'m
about to be thrown out of the building so I must go now.
(There, that should whet any apetites going!)

Jerry, 

Well put, if somewhat blunt.  

I say this as somebody who has never designed a ship with FF&S, and 
has never played TNE (although I have the books for the system, and 
HAVE read them).  The facts are that a lot of people liked FF&S, and 
IMO it was probably the best thing that GDW designed out of the TNE 
stuff.  In my opinion, that\'s a bit like saying it\'s the best 
ballerina in Galveston, TX, but FF&S was a good idea.  I think that a 
tweaked FF&S under a different name in a year or two would be a fine 
addition to my collection.  There is a simpler design system, and we 
can thank IG in general and Don Perrin in particular for seeking 
input.  A simple system and a complex system should please everybody. 
 
It\'s time for the CT folks to face facts.  this is not 1977.  Most of 
the people on this list are veterans of 10-20 years of RPG 
experience.  My first RPG was Tunnels & Trolls.  A crude design, 
terrible mechanics, and no product support.  Would I play it again, 
now?  Not in a million years.  Would I use book 2 to fight starship 
combat or design starships?  Heck, I\'m not even sure I\'d want to use 
Book 5 again...  Again, not in a million years.  A large number of 
gamers feel the same way.  For you to bash FF&S just because you 
don\'t like it, is no better than what GDW did by assuming that 
everybody wanted to use a system as complex as FF&S.

The good news for the CT folks, is there\'s no Virus in the first 
mililieu, your campaigns will be writing the "canon", instead of 
being strangled by it.  The system is going to bear a closer 
resemblance to CT/MT than TNE, and IG is looking for ideas and 
input.  The strength of the game has always been the background first, 
and the rules second (or third), anyways.

> MegaTraveller Referee\'s Gaming Kit (DGP)

Basically a good referee\'s screen, with a short folio adventure and

If its the price I saw listed on SOK a while ago, its worth it if you 
use MT.

Not a clue on this one

I believe this was a book full of subsector maps

Planetary maps, if I\'m not mistaken..

General note on all the Judge\'s Guild stuff.  IMHO, it was poorly

and wound up buying all of them.  The other stuff never interested me 
enough to get it.  I have none of the above products, but probably 
saw all of them over the years.

Late in the MT era.  Set in Hard Times.  

***SPOILER MATERIAL ahead***

Basically a trek by an Azhanti High Lightning cruiser across the 
Imperium, trying to contact various factions in the Rebellion to seek 
Alliance, with lots of adventures in between.

Probably worth buying, if you have Hard Times.  If not, you might 
want to find a copy of Hard Times first.

A followup to the Hard Times Sourcebook for MT.  Merc adventures in

Not familiar with this 1.

A sector on the Trailing edge of the Imperium.  If I\'m not mistaken,

The ostensible reason for the IN placing an interdiction on Shionthy
was that the concentration of contra-terrene matter was a significant
hazard to space travel. A single fleck of antimatter could severely damage a
ship, and probably the crew as well due to the radiation produced in
the annihilation. Adventure 1: The Kinunir gives some rules for
encountering antimatter, so I think that this could be taken as
official canon.

Of course, since the Shionthy belt is presumed to have been caused by
a Ancient planet-buster weapon, the Imperial Navy have probably
interdicted the system so that they can sift the area for scraps of
Ancient technology without treasure hunters making off with valuable
(and possibly powerful) items.

If I remember rightly, the Travellers Digest published an adventure
(part of the grand tour) which took place on an interdicted Ancient
site in the Marches, but I can\'t remember which system it was on
(Pixie springs to mind, though).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thanks for the support Dan. You\'ve already said most of what I would
have so I\'ll just add some comments.

Darkstar; you guys have been pissin\' & moanin\' & cryin\' & whinin\' ever
since T4 has been announced because you weren\'t getting what you wanted.
I find it interesting that you now take offence whenever someone else
complains. You already got what you wanted with TNE & we all know what
a big success that was. Face it, you are out of touch with what the
general public desires & your extreme attachment to FF&S just proves
the point. T4 may well be able to survive this grafting on of elements
of the failed TNE system but I suspect that your demands have only just 
begun.

I repeat, the more T4 adopts from & therefore comes to resemble TNE the
more people will identify it with TNE. And that\'ll be a big negative,
for sure.

eee-Nuff. Take it to alt.flame if you need to continue insulting each other.

    -- the Admin


Now, a rational non-flaming, non-TNE, non-CT bashing reply to the ships argment:

It appears that some form of FF&S will be used to create the design system
for T4.  The design system does not look like it will be FF&S, just derived
from FF&S.

Basically both sides win here.  The Gear Heads get to go nuts and build
simple easy to use tables that will be for the non-Gear Heads.  They are
correcting some mistakes in FF&S when they build the tables (for instance
you should be able to drive a 200T Far Trader with a crew of 2).  They get
to argue the variations in laser intensities to their hearts content, we
hopefully will get a chart of  Laser X does nD6 damange (or whatever is
appropriate).

I have been kinda listing in on the GDW-beta list where the gear heads roam
and injecting my "Demands" from time to time.  So far, I am pleased with
what I have seen, though I have not looked at the weapons and combat stuff
yet.  But hopefully, they learned, and their hull/drive/power plants seem
somewhat reasonable.

Let people put in glove boxes if they want, but the basic system doesn\'t
need it, and frankly we just need a bunch of pre-designs to work with and a
combat system that is simple and works.

There are two "Quick and Easy Systems", actually.  One, The Quick Ship
Design System (QSD System) is on the same complexity level as Book 2, and
was done by me.  You literally select from tables and add up columns - the
intent was that you could reasonably design a ship with nothing more than
the rulebook and a pencil and paper (there\'s only two places where you have
to divide, and only six multiplications in the whole sequence, so the
calculator is optional).  It\'s truly "plug-and-chug".

The result is (within a fairly limited scope: 100 to 5000 ton ships, and a
reasonable but small set of hull, weapon and sensor options) a ship rated
for the MMT starship combat system, that is also a valid FF&S design.

I\'ll see if I can get permission to make the design system available on the
\'net somewhere.  I believe the QSD System will be included in the basic MMT
rulebooks, so that you\'ll be able to design and customize ships immediately.

The second system is FF&S "Lite", being put together by David Golden.  He\'s
got the current mock-up on his web site.  FF&S "Lite" is a bit more complex;
you\'ll need a calculator work out your design.  On the other hand, it\'s a
LOT more flexable, is still much easier than FF&S, and also produces MMT
statistics and valid FF&S designs.  FF&S "Lite" will probably be included
with the starship book product.

Since both systems are based on FF&S, you can mix and match steps: if you
don\'t like any of the QSD System\'s available hulls, you can generate a hull
with FF&S Lite, and then fill it with QSD System components and have a valid
design.  You can use FF&S to design a new weapons system, and then "package"
it up for use with QSD System or FF&S Lite.

I think we\'ve really got the best of both (all three?) worlds with MMT.

Unless of course, he had no background in physics, and therefore had

Sorry, but I like a canonical explanation of some sort as to how the 
stuff works.  Not that most of my players are going to ask, but if 
they do, I\'m going to be able to give them a semi-rational, 
consistent explanation on how something works.

They aren\'t.  IG IS listening to folks.  They\'ve changed things quite 
a few times, and taken a lot of suggestions.  Actually, from what 
I\'ve seen, the only thing out of TNE that is going to be used is 
FF&S.  IMNSHO, FF&S was the best thing to come out of TNE, even 
if I do disagree with it, and find it too complex.

Er, not too many.  And the unusable ship design system you refer to 
(FF&S) is NOT going to be in the basic rules.

Just because you or I don\'t want something, doesn\'t mean there aren\'t 
a lot of people who do.  Open your mind...  You are being at least as 
bad as some of the pro FF&S people...  Game design has progressed 
since 1977...  I doubt seriously that very many people at all want to 
go back to the rules of the little black books...

I figure that the reason is that the Imperial Navy is trying to find a
way to *mine* the anti-matter and use it as a power source. They don\'t
want anybody else getting hold of any.

For a good description of the sort of problems involved, read "Seetee

Remember, a lot of the recent discoveries are due to observations from
the Hubble Space Telescope. As telescopes go, it\'s no more than a large
*amateur* instrument. A professional size telescope on the moon or in
the outer reaches of the solar system would pick this sort of thing up
easily.

I posted what I sent in. Note that I took a reasonable (if somewhat
pessimistic) view. Once you have the positions, you can start
determining more about the nearer stars. But its almost as fast (if not
faster) to send a ship to check things out. And the ship can determine
things that the telescope can\'t.

A sector map and world details that GDW has since declared to be

I\'ve encountered them in "The Fountains of Paradise" and "Red Mars" and like
the idea, but I have\'nt been able to convince myself that such a thing would
work
(not that that should be a problem in an SF game!)

Think about it: a large mass (an asteroid, say) is placed in
planeto-stationary orbit and a cable is lowered to the planetary equator and
anchored.  elevator cars are then run up and down the cable.  Seems simple.

However, at no point along its length is the cable (which has mass, probably
a lot of mass) in orbit.  For example, a section of cable 200km above the
earth\'s surface travels "around" the planet in 24h and is thus moving at a
very much lower velocity than a satellite orbiting at the same altitude.
The cable is therefore not "weightless", and exerts a downwards force on the
orbiting anchor.

Is it not then the case that no matter how massive the anchor the cable
would eventually drag it down to the planetary surface, with catastrophic
consequences?

Hope someone can help

The cable\'s _radial_ velocity is the same as that of the satellite - it
completes 2*pi radians in 24 hours. It\'s just the same as the rotation of the
planet - a point on the surface of the planet and a point somewhere inside
the planet are moving at different speeds, but their angular velocity is
the same,
otherwise the planet would break up.

>Is it not then the case that no matter how massive the anchor the cable

I think that the most likely candidate for drag is going to be the effect
of the planet\'s atmosphere on the cable, but I don\'t have any figures for
that, I\'m afraid.

Well, most of the discussion on it has been taking place on the
traveller and gdw-beta mailing lists.  There\'s a draft in place and
everything.  I\'ll have to dig up the URLs and give them to you later.

: The best part about the book 2 design system was that it

I think this is more a function of the fact that the original 3 books
didn\'t present the Imperium as THE game universe.  But hey, things
change and we realize that the importance of Traveller is the story
behind it.  So you don\'t like the way MDrives work.  Change it.  I
keep seeing lots of divergent campaigns where people change the
history of something or other because it works better with their
view of the Imperium and yet can\'t bring themselves to create a
different explanation for the way drives work.  What doesn\'t make
sense here?  I swear sometimes I feel like people purposefully don\'t
bend the way tech works just so they can have a point of contention
with me.  8)

Uhm, where did I say I loved TNE?  Or is the assumption that since I
liked FF&S suppossed to mean that I liked the entire game.  Man, I
could have sworn that I heard myself complain about the storyline.  I
seem to recall stating on this list many times about what I found
wrong with TNE.  But then again, I had to swallow hard and admit that
there were things about it that I DID like.

Do you believe that they shot themselves in the foot because the
created TNE or because they didn\'t listen to their customer input?
How many of us were clamoring for a campaign background other than the
RC?  How many of us desired sourcebooks that dealt with other
timelines (classic, rebellion, hard times, etc...)?  The complaints
that mostly hit the list (about 80%) were not about mechanics, but
rather about the story and that Virus crap (to quote someone else).

It\'s good to see that IG didn\'t listen to any of this and they\'re
picking up right where GDW left off!

Starships supplement.

You don\'t need them in your designs.  I however see otherwise.  Why do
you think that IG is starting with the basic system and then building
upon it?  That way you get the simple stuff with the rules and then
you can fork out the extra cash for a more detailed system if you\'re
interested.  I still don\'t see what the problem with this is.  It
worked for Starship and then High Guard.

: >I\'m sorry if I don\'t see a problem other than your attitude.

: Sounds like someone else has the attitude problem.

Oh pardon me if I get a tad offended by people who assume that if IG
isn\'t reprinting the stuff from 20 years ago then the product will be
crap.  Also, I find it hard to swallow that by making changes that
their customers are asking for the IG is turning into another GDW.

    'body' => 'Well, it appears that we have several different styles of Traveller 
players, and that they overlap to some degree.  There are people who like 
complex, moderate, and simple systems for ship design.  These three 
groups also exist for skill systems.  This is probably also true of every 
other system in Traveller.  

An interesting thing is that the people who enjoy complex ship design 
(for instance) are not necessarily the same people who enjoy complex 
skill systems (again, for instance).  

Me?  I\'m one of the folks who likes to keep things simple, but I also 
appreciate the need of others for complexity.  It\'s great that Mr. 
Wildstar\'s system may be (will be?) included in the basic book.  If that 
is true, then I will be very, very happy.  (No offense meant to Mr. 
Golden - I like his system, too, but I love the idea of having all three 
systems (including the renamed FF&S) available.)  If things turn out the 
way they are looking to in terms of ship design, I\'ll probably use QSDS 
most of the time, FF&S Light once in a while (for important ship 
designs), and FF&S only once in a great while.

So, having lots of different ship design sytems is good.  But is this 
also true of skill systems?  I mean, heck, if it were possible, wouldn\'t 
that satisfy everyone?  

I\'m thinking it can\'t be done smoothly, however.  Not without drastically 
changing the Traveller skills system.  Let\'s say the basic system has 
only top-level skills with a few cascades.  Medic-0 is first aid, etc.  
The complex system would either have tons of cascades (Medical is divided 
into First Aid, Nurse, etc.) or simply have tons of skills (Medic is one 
skill, First Aid is another).  Unlike with going from QSDS to FF&S or 
FF&S Light to FF&S, taking a character from one of these systems to the 
other would involve some translations.  

Examples:

Basic to Cascade:  My (Basic) Medic-1 would have to make a choice as to 
which cascade skill (or skills) she would want to have.  Instead of 
being mediocre at all medical skills, she would be mediocre at one 
cascade and very poor (skill level 0) at all others.  She looses ability 
in the translation.

Basic to Lots O\' Skills:  My (again, Basic) Medic-1 would go from being 
able to perform emergency medical assistance to being less able to do so 
(if I have this system figured right).  The First Aid or EMT skilled 
people would be more proficient than she at this sort of action.  (And if 
this is not the case,then why have separate skills at all?  If one is a 
subset of the other, then keep them as one skill.)

As I (and others) have said before, my preference is that there be a good 
list of basic skills (something very like the complete skill list from 
CT, including all the Books and Supplements).  If more skills are needed 
in a particular campaign, the referee can add them.  


While there may be broad support for having a lot more skills, each 
individual extra skill is only going to be useful to a very limited 
number of referees and players.  Please, keep the basic skills system simple.

The 2300AD game system recognized two "Beanstalks" in the human sphere.  One
on the earth and one at Beta Canum Venaticorum (sp?).  The whole thing was
the asteroid was like a ball on the end of a string because of the speed it
was orbiting the planet and its mass, greater than that of the stalk itself,
it wanted to pull away from the planet.  In the "Invasion" module in order
to deny the Kafer\'s  access to the beanstalk the lower attachments were
blown before the planet fell and the beanstalk just drifted off into space.
Musta been a hell of a sight from the planets surface.

Good answer, and it shows you\'re a flexible and creative referee.  I\'m a 
big believer in there not being a rule for everything, so this solution 
looks excellent to me.

I take it TNE had such a character sheet?  (I\'ve never seen a Traveller 
character sheet with all skills listed on it.)  Or has this been proposed 
for MMT?

From: That Computer Guy <darkstar@chopin.udel.edu>

: Thanks for the support Dan. You\'ve already said most of what I would
: have so I\'ll just add some comments.
: 
: Darkstar; you guys have been pissin\' & moanin\' & cryin\' & whinin\' ever
: since T4 has been announced because you weren\'t getting what you wanted.
: I find it interesting that you now take offence whenever someone else
: complains. You already got what you wanted with TNE & we all know what
: a big success that was. Face it, you are out of touch with what the
: general public desires & your extreme attachment to FF&S just proves
: the point. T4 may well be able to survive this grafting on of elements
: of the failed TNE system but I suspect that your demands have only just 
: begun.

Phil, first and foremost, I\'ve always taken offense when you complain.
Second, you mistake our previous round as out-and-out support for TNE.
I did say that there were a lot of things that I liked about TNE.  I
also recall saying that there were plenty more that I didn\'t like
about TNE.  I also recall that I didn\'t even begin to play a TNE
campaign until The Regency Sourcebook came out.  So please don\'t say I
got what I wanted out of TNE until you see how much of it I actually
used.  After that we\'ll talk about disappointment.

My point back then was that some people liked the RC and Virus setting
and that there should be no reason why they shouldn\'t continue the
setting in one of their Milieu sourcebooks.  You disagreed and
basically said what amounted to "they just shouldn\'t be playing
Traveller if that\'s the setting they want to use."

Where were you all last week?  Work on an easy design system was all
over the gdw-beta list.  It was announced many times and stuff
cross-posted to both the traveller list and this list.  If you wanted
to make sure it was done right, why didn\'t you give your Cr.02 on the
issue?  Speaking of which, have you even seen this system yet?  I
didn\'t think so.

: I repeat, the more T4 adopts from & therefore comes to resemble TNE the
: more people will identify it with TNE. And that\'ll be a big negative,
: for sure.

It\'s amazing how lots of people wanted to go back to CT and MT for
lots of things except for this.  Originally IG was going to go with a
more HG system then what they have now.  Amazingly once they saw more
people complain then not they gave it some thought and a chance to see
if it could work.  "FF&S?  Only if you can make it as quick and simple
as Books 2 and 5".  Take a look at the stuff before you start to blast
it.  That\'s all I\'m asking.

I agree with you that Traveller needs more non-military characters than 
the basic CT system had.  This means it needs more skills to support 
those characters.  But which skills?  

For instance, I don\'t remember the character list Marc posted having a 
Religious Scholar.  It had a Scholar, but it wasn\'t specialized.  But, 
hey, you\'ve gotta have /some/ skills for specialization, right?  Right.

But, again, which ones?  If we choose to include every single discipline, 
we\'re going to have a humongous list of skills (many of which won\'t be 
used in most campaigns).  Does it make more sense to make some broad 
choices that are not too specific (ie, top-level skills rather than 
breaking them down into their component skills - Computer Science, 
rather than Database Systems, Management Information Systems, and 
Programming - let alone a further breakdown (for instance of Programming 
into each computer langauge, or of any computer skill into 
platform-specific skills)), or to allow for the widely applicable, 
low-level skills such as languages, computer use, etc.?

With only a very few additions, the complete CT list of skills can serve 
to allow for any area of study, as Daniel\'s Theology example shows.  This 
method appears to be the best way to go.

No TNE used blank spaces after the attribues.  I don\'t know where this
character sheet came from.

  If memory serves, this was about T-Plates vs. reaction drives.  I\'ve been
trying to follow that thread in the 100 or so a day messages on the beta list.
My understanding is that:
a) By the Word of Marc Miller, T-Plates are cannon.
b) There will be reaction drives as well
c) T-Plates show up at either TL 11 or 12.  I forget which
d) The T4 reaction drives will not be the fuel hogs they were in TNE
e) T4 J-Drives will use CT/MT fuel formulas, not the TNE ones required by d).

   If you haven\'t been following the gdw-beta mailing list, I\'m not suprised.
Trust me, you wouldn\'t have wanted the xboat list flooded with that volume
of messages.

   Simplicity was one the features, as well as the major weakness of book 2.

   TNE had it\'s major flaws (like Virus & only reaction drives).  It did have
some strong points though.  The character creation system was much stronger
than CT.  The task resolution system didn\'t drive GM\'s to pack asprin like
the MT system.

    Actually, GDW lost toes over the T$R lawsuit.  The typo ridden MT
didn\'t help either.

   Then what is the arguing about?  You got what you wanted.  Book 2 & 5
type design rules included in the main book.  The rules even include 
reactionless drives!

  Because there are enough gearheads out there to make it worthwhile
to IG ($ wise) to do so.  There is also all the designs that will pop
up on the net for non-gear heads to print out and use with minimum 
hassle.

   There was a poll taken, and the results showed that most folks who
used all three design systems perfered FF&S.  It also showed that there
was a need for a \'Q&D\', plug & play design system (like Book 2).
  That is what IG is putting out.  The Plug & Play rules in the main
book, and detailed, gearhead rules in a seperate book.  Don\'t buy the
gearhead book if that level of detail offends you.

  If T4 is just a reissue of CT, why bother?  It has been 20 years, and
the RPG industry has learned some lessons (like it doesn\'t pay to argue
with T$R lawyers :-<).  There are some good features from TNE & MT that
IG should look to including in T4, as well as things that should be left
by the wayside.

        That\'s why you extend a counterweight *outward* from the central
mass. That part is easy to fix ... but what do you do when some terrorist
blows the downhaul loose? Or some drunk in his suborbital skimmer nails it?
The kinetic energy in that cable when it hits will make the end of the world
look like a day at the beach ...

Jeez, you must have been sleeping under a rock.  I read somewhere in 
a mainstream publication (might have even been a local fishwrap), 
that some Astronomer in the US had discovered what looked like a 
planet circling 1 of the stars of Alpha Centauri...

I couldn\'t tell you exactly when it was, sometime last year.

Sorry, I can\'t remember more, I wish I could.

I would say, given they have gravitics (which will allow gravity
fields to do with uncharge matters what magnetic fields does
with charged matter) they already have the means.  I think
the consequences of this one weren\'t that well thought through.

It couldn\'t have been liked by that many people, otherwise it would still be
around!

Besides, I don\'t even know what HEPlaR is?  I thought that Thruster Plates
were part of background not rules.

Yes, I\'ve seen the \'simplified\' star ship design on Daves web pages.  Yuck!!!
Page after page of mind numbing charts.  Again, why is level of detail so
important?  
If the only reason you play the game is to spend hours detailing meaningless
pages
of \'funny\' numbers than go ahead.  But don\'t try to pass this off as the next 
best thing to sliced bread.  It\'s still a complex, overly detailed, impossible 
to use system.

If you mean that they spend time detailing every single asteroid in a system
then I
would agree.  However, if you mean they spend time detailing the NPCs in the
system,
the details of the planets government, the culture and language of the
planets then
I would disaggree with you.  IMO the point to playing Traveller is dealing with
new situations and solving problems and puzzles caused by situations, not
trying to
squeeze another .000047 MegaWatts out of your latest Battleship design.  (But
I\'ll admit this is a judgment call on my part.)

Again, the absence of any explaination of the formate of Library
data was one of the strengths of Traveller.  The rules (IMO) 
should NOT tell us exactly how things work.  That\'s up to the
GM to design.  \'Official\' background can give one or more ideas
of how such systems work, but look what happened to the rules 
governing computers in Traveller.  What was thought possible 
in the late 70\'s turned out to be way off!

        For the same reason that a lot of things popular in 1977 aren\'t
popular in 1996: this isn\'t 1977, it\'s 1996. People have changed, our world
has changed, our expectations have changed.

This is a particular point of interest to me.  I\'ve run games that had
religion
involved in them and the interplay of different religious structures make
both
an interesting back-drop and a centerpoint for adventures.
Given the universe of Traveller as it is, it lends itself to the spread of 
missionaries throughout the Imperium and the surrounding space.
In my games, the missionaries are recognized as being individuals of
peaceful intent and are therefore never messed with (even the pirates
don\'t bother them since it\'d REALLY get the locals up in arms!).

Considering how many different faiths earth has, just consider the
differents religions the crop up in a universe like exists in Traveller....

Actually, thought has occured.  Since the Droyne are really the Ancients and
the Droyne have no known homeworlds just something I can\'t spell off the top
of my head that means "lost home" has anyone considered or read that
Shionthy might actually be the remains of the Droyne/Ancients homeworld.

You seem to feel that the Imperium IS Traveller.  I\'ve always thought
that Traveller is a framework of rules on how to run a good Sci-Fi
game.  The official background is just that background.  

The rules should not attempt to explain technology, only present the
framework of how the technology is applied.  That way the GM is free
to create their own reasons without having to change major sections
of the base rule set.

If you say "If you don\'t like thruster plates, don\'t use them!", fine.
But if the rule set for space combat and ship design imply that MDrives
are thruster plates than I would have to change major parts of the rules.

>Oh pardon me if I get a tad offended by people who assume that if IG
>isn\'t reprinting the stuff from 20 years ago then the product will be
>crap.  Also, I find it hard to swallow that by making changes that

I\'m not saying that they need to reprint old material, but I am
suggesting that they print new material in the same way they did
20 years ago.  Specifically:

        Clearly separate the basic framework of rules from background.

and

        Keep the rules as simple as possible.

Somehow the Imperium seems to have became the only viable background.
No commercial products that I know of delt with alternate settings.
This I feel was one reason why Traveller fizzled.  Remember, TSR 
published several campaign settings for D&D.  

New players may have gotten the idea that Traveller was about 
Stephon, Zhodani and Aslans (or more recently Virus).  
And if they didn\'t like those things they wouldn\'t like Traveller.

I think you may have mistaken this for the other myraid of planets
discovered recently.  I make a habit out of cutting EVERY article to do with
science & space out of the Toronto Star (a big newspaper) and there hasn\'t
been anything to do with planets around Alpha or Proxima Centauri.  However,
recently, (actually a couple of times last year) scientists using the Hubble
telescope have discovered planets circling other stars.  In fact, just
yesterday a Jupiter sized planets in a similar orbit to Jupiter was
discovered circling a star only 8 light years from Earth.  There\'s evidence
that a smaller, Earth sized planet may orbit closer to that star as well,
prompting the newspaper article to suggest the possiblity of
extra-terrestrial life, guess we\'ll have to wait and see.

Yeah, he played this retired Navy Chaplin for several game sessions. 
We were running a Far Trader in the Spinward Marches, and all the
players were ex-Navy.  This guy was the medic on the ship.."Being both
doctor and priest, I really *can* space my mistakes."  <g> I remember
this crew having to deal with a Theocracy on some world, and getting
involved in some sort of religious dispute between factions on
another.

Never ran any real missionaries, though that could be
interesting.  I did have an NPC gun runner pretending to be a
missionary in one game.

Can\'t say the same here.  Pirates don\'t give *anyone* quarter, and
most locals don\'t want some strange outsider harranging them about
religion..they\'ve got plenty of locals anxious to do that themselves.

over TNE & market it as T4.

I was hoping that IG would have learned from GDW\'s mistakes
but that doesn\'t seem to be the case.

I have no interest in investing my time or money in supporting
TNEv2 so I\'ll be cancelling my advance orders for T4 products.

I\'ll also be cancelling my subscription to this list since MM
was the last hope for restoring Traveller & that hope has now
disappeared.

I had hoped that I could spread the word around here that T4
would bring back the magic that once was Traveller but now I\'ll
have to say, "It\'s just a repackaged TNE".

I shouldn\'t have used the term "drag" - I meant it in the loose rather than
technical sense.  The cable isn\'t being pulled through the planet\'s
atmosphere, although I imagine that strong winds near the ground and
high-altitude jetstreams might have an effect on the structure.  Instead of
"drag" I should have said "pull": the weight of the cable is pulling the
asteroid down because although the asteroid is in free-fall, the cable is
not.  The cable is not in orbit (free-fall) precisely because it is moving
with the same angular velocity as the planetary surface.

??????! This sounds wrong to me.  The anchor mass does want to pull away
from the planet: it wants to travel in a straight line at a constant
velocity, but it can\'t because the planetary mass keeps on exerting a
gravitational pull on it.  This is pretty much the definition of "orbit" and
explains why the Moon doesn\'t need a long string attached to it to stop it
drifting away from the Earth.  Similarly, the cable anchor would stay in
orbit whether the cable was attached or not (unless it is the case that the
weight of the cable would eventually pull the anchor out of orbit...)

In "Red Mars" the martian seperatists blow the cable at the anchor end to
stop Terran mercenaries assaulting the surface (Its a while since I read it
so I might be misremebering here).  

I\'m not sure about the idea of a counterweight: I don\'t think it would work
either (I\'m so down on everything today :-)).  A counterweight mass higher
up than the primary anchor would have a different orbital velocity.
Remember that the only reason the elevator works (if it does...) is because
its orbital velocity is such that it has the same period as the planetary
surface below, and this can only be achieved at one orbital radius.  The
counterweight would have to be both higher up than the anchor and moving at
the same velocity as the anchor and this just isn\'t possible.

In Scotland we have a third verdict in court: "Not Proven".  This is how I
feel about Space Elevators.  I really would welcome any more comments on
this subject.  If you don\'t think its appropriate for the list, mail me direct.

: You seem to feel that the Imperium IS Traveller.  I\'ve always thought
: that Traveller is a framework of rules on how to run a good Sci-Fi
: game.  The official background is just that background.  
: 
: The rules should not attempt to explain technology, only present the

Would you say the same about the Star Wars RPG?  What about
Battlelords of the 23rd Century?  The problem with role-playing games
is that there needs to be a place for them to play in.  What you just
described is GURPS Space.

If all Traveller is suppossed to be is a set of mechanics, then why
are we even bothering including a background?  Why should Virus or The
Rebellion even be an issue?  If you don\'t like technology tied to
rules, then why is jump space the default FTL?

But the Imperium does end up being the background for the ruleset for
the game we call Traveller.  And yes, jump works the way it does,
Strephon lives, and Virus make my toaster feel queasy.

If you want to use the rules but not the setting, then do so.  The
game should be tailored to suit your needs.  You don\'t like an
explanation change it or don\'t reference it.  Try to pick up any RPG
(other than a generic one) and see if the setting can be completely
distinguished from the rules.

As for TSR and their many campaign worlds.  Greyhawk was their
official and only campaign world until 1986 when it (along with Gary
Gygax) was dropped.  At that point they created the Forgotten Realms.
It wasn\'t until the 2nd edition, and actually in the last four years
that they\'ve started this propagation of campaign worlds.

That\'s funny considering that you haven\'t even seen the product yet.
Man prejudice abounds.  I\'d say wait until it hits the shelves at your

Actually, I\'d say GDW\'s problems with T$R, and MegaTraveller\'s poor

Not impossible to use, at least not for a lot of people.  Probably 
easy if laid out on a spreadsheet, which is the best way to use any 
of the ship design systems (Except for Book 2, which my 3 year old 
could probably design a ship with).

To some people.  Ideally it is what the players want out of it.  If 
they want excruciating detail, then the system should let you.  If you want 
something less detailed, dump what you don\'t want.  It\'s easier to 
delete a rule you don\'t want to use than it is to add 1 you need.

> Have you seen this simple system?  It\'s as simple as a 1040 tax form!

Actually, I filled out a 1040 tax form in about 40 minutes this year. 
It took me about 40 minutes to design a ship with MT the last time I 
did it.  I would suspect that Dave\'s FF&S lite will also take me 
about 40 minutes.  You\'re right, it is as simple as a 1040 tax 
form...

Actually, if you want the naked truth, its because THERE WAS NOTHING 
ELSE OUT THERE!

The RPG systems on the market in 1977 were D&D, Tunnels & Trolls, and 
a few other Fantasy RPG\'s.  It was the first SF RPG, and therefore 
was successful, almost by default.  It was an elegant system for the 
time, but lets face it, a lot of CT looks like a greybeard at this 
point in terms of rule system.  This is the reason for a task system, better, more 
comprehensive ship and craft design.  Look at the number of early 
Traveller licensees who now make products that compete within the same niche:  
Games Workshop (Adventure 4: Leviathan), FASA (Sky Raiders, and a ton of 
other stuff), DGP (Soon to come out with AI, they basically designed 
MegaTraveller).  

Hell, I bought my second set of Little Black Books at Waldenbooks for 
heavens sake.  Those days are gone.  They will NEVER be back.  The 
market has matured, there are other SF RPG\'s out there, and in the case 
of the SF market, games with very recognizable licensing (Star Wars, 
Star Trek), are directly competing.    Plus, the RPG market has shrunk 
compared to those days.  I live across the way from a guy who bought 
the CT boxed set, and never used them.  At that time, people bought 
RPG\'s they never used, kind of like people buy CCG\'s today.  
GDW, TSR and others got rich then in a way that the companies 
around now would have a hard time doing.  A lot of people got into 
RPG\'s for a couple years in the late 70\'s and early 80\'s, and then got out.  
Then about 83-85, a lot of the early companies fell like leaves from the 
trees in autumn, as a lot of players moved on.  Frankly, I was that way 
for a while.  I didn\'t get back into it until about 1990 after having not 
played a game since 1984.

If you think that just reissuing the little black books in a single 
bound volume is going to allow IG to take shelf space away from West 
End Games (Star Wars), & FASA (Starfleet Battles), you are deluding 
yourself.  Very few people would give a system that relied solely on something 
as crude as Book 2, Starships for ship design a 2nd glance today, not 
even me.

On the other hand, you did confirm my basic premise, we have only

The way a beanstalk ostensably works is to make the cable long enough that
the asteroid is travelling at a greater than orbital velocity, and thus
pulls the cable tight by centrifugal force.  

Yeah, there are all sorts of engineering problems -- I find the idea a bit
farfetched myself, but that is how it is supposed to work.

If you take a line with a mass at each end, reeled in intially so that
the masses are next to each other and so in the same orbit, and then
you reel the line out so that one mass heads planetwards and the other
spacewards, the result is something which orbits at the rate of the
centre of the line.  This is difficult to do, as the Space Shuttle
tether experiments show.  A beanstalk would be the extreme case; much
smaller lines entirely in space could conceivably be used to generate
power, sling loads into deep space, or decellerate incoming
spaceships.  To make the beanstalk (a la Red Mars), you put a
planetoid in geostationary orbit above where you want the thing to
come down, and then reel a line out in both directions.  The lines act
as counterweights.  However, if you make the spaceward line denser, or
thicker, or whatever, it doesn\'t need to go as far out as the
planetward one needs to go down.

BTW in Red Mars, the beanstalk was broken at the geostationary
planetoid: It then fell in a spectacular fashion, wrapping itself
twice around the planet, and causing a lot of damage (a great passage
in the book).  The planetoid whizzed off to Jupiter, or something like
that.  If you broke a beanstalk at the base, the whole things would
whizz out into space, although there would probably be a hell of a
sonic boom as the tail end was pulled through the atmosphere.
Tactically, I suspect the Red Mars rebels would have done a better job
if they had wiped out the anchor on the planet, so that there wouldn\'t
have been the massive collateral damage, but it wouldn\'t have been
such a vivid read!

There is a Traveller adventure called Tower Trouble in an old White
Dwarf, which details what is essentially a "great train robbery in the
sky", and is set on a beanstalk rising from Ecuador on Terra.  I think
the main reason beanstalks aren\'t prevelant in Traveller is that grav
travel is so much easier and safer; an elevator only makes sense when
the competition are using rockets.  I think the Terra Tower in the WD
adventure suggested that it was built before gravitics came of age on
Terra (about 2020 AD?), although that would make it 3000 years old!

How do you figure?  The only place they\'ve really won major 
concessions at all is that FF&S was saved.  The skill list & basic 
character classes are very CTish.  The storyline is CTish, and MM is 
even setting up several mililieu\'s to give players a choice of where 
they want to game...

Nonsense.  This game is probably going to resemble a slimmed down, 
better proofed and edited (we hope) MT or CT than TNE.

On the contrary.  IG has solicited opinions not once, but several 
times.  And last I knew, IG hadn\'t done anything to give T$R grounds 
to sue them.  :-)

That\'s too bad.  I\'m sorry to see this, I think you\'ll be missing out

Talk about burning your boats.  Too bad.  When you weren\'t ranting 
at people who disagreed with you, you did have some valuable insights.

Then you would be misinforming people.  All just because you\'re not 
open-minded enough to coexist with people who happen to like the 
level of detail provided in FF&S, even when the game is offering 2 
different alternative design systems of lesser complexity, all 3 of 
which will be a lot more compatible with each other than Book 2 & 
Book 5 were. 

Frankly, from what I\'m seeing and hearing I can\'t wait for my

According to Alien Module 6 - Droyne, Imperial scholars do believe that 
the Ancient homeworld is somewhere in or around the Spinward Marches.  
They base this fact on the the observation that the occurence of Ancient 
sites decreases as you move away from the Marches.  It is also the 
popular hypothesis that the Ancient homeworld was destroyed during the 
Final War.

This is not correct.  Apperantly Yaskodray (Grandfather), after 
eliminating all of his children and grand children who opposed him, 
pinched off a pocket universe and moved the Ancient homeworld into it.  He 
would emerge from his pocket universe periodically, to help the Droyne 
when they were in trouble.  The most recent apperance was when he 
introduced the coyns (sp?) to the Droyne on several worlds in several 
different system.

Thats a little better.  I though I would have heard about something as big

You missed a *vital* detail. As you lower the cable towards the ground,
you *also* let the "anchor mass" move farther out. The anchor mass,
being *farther* out exerts an *upward* force on the cable. This keeps
the "center of mass" at the geosynch point, and also keeps the cable
under tension.

Most of us have absolutely no idea whats going though MM\'s head right now.
All of this babbling on the echo here is about what we the people think is
good.  Marc could turn around tomorrow and tell us that because none of what
we\'ve said is Scottish it\'s all CRAAAAAAAAPP!!

And what was so wrong with TNE.  So far I\'ve heard little complaints with
the basic rules, character generation etc.  Everyone is whining about the
inclusion of Virus and the Destruction of the 3rd Imperium.  Personally I
think the inclusion of these things answered questions with no easy
solution.  And you can\'t blame GDW for that, read the Rebellion source book
by Marc Miller, the writting\'s on the wall then.  The Rebellion had turned
into a blood bath with no easy solutions it was evident that unless
something radical occured, something like, dare I say it, VIRUS, the war
would just drag on for centuries and the end result would be the same.  The
complete and total desruction of humanities interstellar acheivements.

T4 will not be a repackage of TNE.  Neither will it be a repackage of CT.
No one is going to be 100% happy with what occures but none of the rest of
us are willing to give up on shaping its future just yet.

No ... the asteroid isn\'t in orbit, either. 
Hang on a second, and I think I can explain it to you.

Let\'s start to build a Clarke Tower: we\'ll park a space station (or an
asteroid would work, I suppose) in geostationary orbit over the equator
somewhere, OK? 

Clearly, if the station is of any size, it\'s center of mass
is what\'s in geostationary orbit, right?  The uppermost and lowermost
extremities are not actually in orbit, you see, because they are moving with
the same speed as the station\'s center of mass.  They are, however, firmly
attached to the station, and so don\'t go flying off into space, or falling
to the ground.  If you stand at the top of the station, and let a pebble go,
it would enter a different orbit than the station was in.

Now we\'ll start building the actual tower from the station to the ground.
As we start to build, the mass of the tower on the bottom of the station
will tend to move the station\'s center of gravity down.  So, to counteract
this, we\'ll add mass to the top of the station, so that the center of mass
of the whole structure stays the same.

We keep building the tower down towards the ground, and keep adding to the
counterweight on the top of the station, until the tip of the tower reaches
the ground.

It\'s worthwhile to note that this whole thing _is_ in geostationary orbit
(even though the bottom part of the tower, on the ground, isn\'t in orbit by
itself; neither is the topmost part of the counterweight).

Once we\'ve got a firm attachment to the ground, we\'ll probably add a little
extra mass to the counterweight on top of the station.  This is so we can
increase the mass at the tip of the station (ie: the on the ground, coming
up the tower) without pulling the center of gravity of the station too low.
This will also put tension on the entire tower structure.


Arthur C. Clarke (the "inventor" of the geostationary communications
satellite) has explained the concept pretty well, and the only impediment to
actually building such a structure is the strength of the materials
required.  Structurally, Clarke Tower hangs down it\'s entire length from
orbit.  The tensile stress on the tower near the "top" (station) end is
enormous - to the point where there are no engineering materials that
you can build the tower out of (various laboratory materials indicate that
we may be able, at some point in the future, to build such a tower).

One fiction book that describes the construction of a "Clarke Tower" is
Clarke\'s _The Fountains of Paradise_; and it covers the engineering pretty
well.  He may have written non-fiction articles about it as well; I don\'t
have a bibliography handy.

The anchor mass portion is not, repeat not, in orbit, any more than the
tower portion is in orbit.

No.  The entire structure, taken as a whole, is in orbit.  Remove or
separate any portion of the structure, and the remaining portions are NOT
in orbit, and will do various strange things.

> The counterweight would have to be both higher up than the anchor and
> moving at the same velocity as the anchor and this just isn\'t possible.

Yes!  It _is_ possible, as long as the counterweight is attached to the
"anchor end" of the cable.  In order to "keep up" with the anchor end of the
cable, the counterweight has to be moving at the same angular velocity.

Since it\'s higher up than the anchor, that means it\'s moving at a higher
tangential velocity.  It\'s _also_ moving at a higher tangential velocity
than an object in orbit at the same altitude [*].  This means that it
"pulls" on the anchor (if the anchor were removed, the counterweight would
go flying up to a higher orbit).  As it is, the counterweight "pulls" on the
anchor - counteracting the downward pull exerted by the cable portion.

[*] The fundamental paradox of orbital mechanics: to slow down, increase
your velocity.  To speed up, reduce your velocity.  This is because
increasing your orbital (tangential) velocity raises the altitude of your
orbit, thereby increasing the length of an orbit (more than compensating for
the increased speed), and therefore _decreases_ your angular velocity.

provide a happy middle ground between those who want seperate skills for
".38 pistol, snub nose, TL8" as opposed to ".38 pistol, not snub, TL8" and
those who just want one skill called "Fighting".  

The idea is similar to Shadowrun (no! no! keep reading!  It\'s not that
bad!) where they have a fairly small list of basic skills and then allow
you to pick a specialization if you wish.  You can stay a generalist and
get level-2 skill in all firearms, or you can specialize so that you get
level-3 in pistol but level-1 in all other weapons.  

Basically, if you get skill of a particular level, you can stay a 
generalist and get that level of expertise in all aspects of the field, 
or you can specialize, getting (level * 1.5) in your specialty and (level 
*.5) in all other areas.  Specific values are open to modification, of 
course, but I\'d like to know what people think of the idea in general.

This does not make skills more complex in any way.  All one does is give a
skill description and list a bunch of suggestions for specialties at the
end of it. The GM decides when a specialty applies to any given
situation.  For instance, Medical (to bring up a hot topic), might look
like this: 

Medical:  This skill deals will all aspects of caring for the sick and 
injured, including emergency medical treatment (blah, blah, blah)...
	Specialties:  First Aid, Surgery, Ophthalmology, etc...

When playing, the GM would determine if say Dr. Bob, Medical-4 
(podiatry), could use his skill at its specialty level (6) or would have 
to use it at his non-specialty level (2).

Example:

GM:  "Well, Toby has fallen down the well and broken his ankle.  What do 
you do?"

Dr. Bob: "Toby!  I\'m coming to get you!  Hang on!"

GM:  "Okay, you lower yourself down the well.  What now?"

Dr. Bob: "I fix his ankle!  I roll a 10, +6 for my skill, and get a 16!"

GM: "Sorry, this is First Aid, you only get +2."

Dr. Bob: "But it\'s his foot!"

GM: "Well...okay...I\'ll allow it."

(Of course, another GM doesn\'t have to be so lenient... :-)

I like this point \'Traveller needs more non-military characters\'.
However, adding more skills for the sake of \'adding more skills\'
may not be the way to go.  The current CT skill list provides
plenty of skills for strictly civilian occupations.
Still, certain technical areas could be added.  
How about \'Photography\'.

I can\'t remember if it was Alpha Centari, but several gas giant sized
planets have been found in orbit around other stars.  The real interesting
fact about these new planets is that are orbiting closer to their star
than our own systems gas giants.  Will this data efect the rules 
for star system generation?  Book 6 states that gas giants should
first be placed in outer orbits before being placed in inner orbits.
However, our own system seems to be the exception rather than the rule.

Not really.  There was Space Opera which came out probably before Traveller,
but if not, shortly there after.  It didn\'t last long.  It was very
cumbersome, the printing quality was poor (used small fonts, poorly laid
out, etc.).  Yes some people loved Space Opera.  Most picked it up, looked
at the complexity and layed it right back down.  They stepped over, saw how
clean Traveller was, the rules were simple, and it was a game that can be
played.  TSR also had Gamma World, which while it had it\'s following it did
not spring to the for front of the Sci-Fi gamer like Traveller did.

I think the problem with CT had to do with the expansion from the basic
game.  GDW produced a bunch of supplements which kept cash flow going, but
its like a computer program that is modified and modified, after a point,
its out of control, large and clunky.  If I want to go a friends house to
play Traveller I have to pack about 50 pounds of books.  The Hardback
Traveller Book was great because it condensed a bunch of the little books
into a nice portable, usable media + they added art work.

Mega Traveller would have been great had the typos not been there and if the
system had done a bit better job of taking all the CT books and condensing
them into several books i.e. collect all the skills together, make sure
thinks like the Book 2/High Guard inconsistancies are cleared up.

The artwork for MT was fantastic, the layout and printing was clear and
readable.  It is probably my favorite set of Traveller reference books to
work with until you get to almost every page has written notes transcribed
from the Errata.

TNE would have been successful had GDW printed it nicely and not altered the
basic flow of the game.  AD&D is still the same basic game as it was in
1977.  The expansions and inconsistices are cleaned up with each printing,
and lessons learned over the years go to make the game better.  There is no
doubt that the Players Handbook and Dungeon Masters Guide today are far
superior to the books produced in the late \'70s.  Yet the rules have only
been changed slightly, and then only to correct problems.

What sells a role playing game today?  

  a) Playable rules.
  b) Incredible Cover Art
  c) Incredible interior art
  d) Sharp printing (interior color helps).
  e) Everything you need to get started available Day 1.
     (not necessarily in the same book).

Vampire is not a complex game.  The game is not over run with rules.  More
time is given to telling the story than determining the diameter, spacing,
and depth of the bite wounds in millimeters.  No one cares that if a bite
from behind at 45 degrees yields a faster blood flow than a frontal bite at
87 degrees.

Take that specificly to Traveller:

I would rather have:

TL 12 Mk. 1 Laser        10d6 Damage
TL 12 Mk. 2 Laser        20d6 Damage
TL 13 Mk. 1 Laser        15d6 Damage etc.

than:

TL 12 150 MW Laser       10d6 Damage
TL 12 200 MW Laser       etc ...

The Laser wattage has no real game effects.  Why do you think Star Trek has
Type 1 and type 2 phasers [Rob visually holds up two different Phasers
showing that they look different]?  Because its something the masses relate to.

Keep it Simple.  Keep it playable.  Don\'t make things complex just because.

They did that with the Traveller Book and it was very popular.  But today
that wont cut it.  There has to be Art and a lot of it and there has to be a
heck of a story to pull you in.  (Oh, Star Wars is a simple game too.  No
need to be a nuclear engineer there....)  Its got to be clean and sharp.

As far as vehicles and starships go, how many games currently on the market
even let your build them?  I don\'t think Vampire lets you construct cars.
AD&D does not provide rules for building ships.  The Star Trek RPG didn\'t
include ship building, they had you buy pre-designed ships.  

Sounds like I am going back to support TNE which did not include design
sequences.  TNE did not have enough ship types, nor did it have deck plans,
nor did it provide tables for fixing shot-up components.  Also there were
way too many abbreviations that you had to did through text to find out what
it ment.  However, T4 Starships if done right will bring the coolness of the
day I first picked up Supplement 7 - Traders and Gun Boats, which is still
the coolest and most used Supplement that Marc put out.

I want a ship design facility, and the multi-level tier system looks fine so
far.  Only about 1/3 of the books sold will be sold to people who will care
to build ships (mostly refs and gear heads), but the other 2/3\'s would love
to have some solid designs and ready to go.  Ships are kind of like
Travellers "Monsters".  You have to have a monster manual with pictures and
descriptions available to oohhh and ahhh your players.  AD&D players dont
care how many vertibre are in the neck of a naga and Traveller players
certanly don\'t care how many cup holders are on board their starship.  "How
fast does it go?  How hard does it shoot?  Can I sneek around with it and
avoid those Imperial nastys?"

Enough ranting and raving...

Yes. In the CT Adventure "Secret of the Anchients", it is revealed to

currently is in a pocket universe whose entry points are in the same

If you set it up that way then yes, you\'re heading for trouble. But
at the same time you send a cable down the well you move the rock up above it\'s

the cable is in orbit, but the rock is above

entire system is orbiting about it\'s centre of mass, and there is no force up or

gravity between the two endpoints, which is why it can\'t be done with current
materials.

Gamma World really doesn\'t count.  It was basically a amateurish, 
post-apocalyptic Earth setting.  As was typical of early TSR stuff, 
editing and layout were poor as well.  

I\'d forgotten about Space Opera, but if I\'m not mistaken, it came out 
after Traveller.  Someone could probably correct me on this...

Maybe I should amend the statement to say it was the first popular SF 
game.

Poor proofing on MT killed it (Especially since the two places where 
the most errors cropped up were Ship/Craft Design & Combat rules, and 
Character Generation).  I agree with you, with the errata, I liked it 
as a rules set.

I grant you that, but its a lot easier to make a fantasy RPG, and 
make it stick than SF, unless you\'re throwing out hard SF, and then 
you might as well be doing fantasy.

Yeah, but the great thing about Traveller is that it lets you design 
your own world, and ships.  Even with TNE, when the background 
was so enmeshed with the rules that it was frustrating, you could still 
chuck the preexisting background, and design your own.  How fun 
would Star Trek be without the Federation mililieu.  As for Vampire, 
I have a feeling it has already peaked.

I agree.  A clean, elegant design system, and a lot of preexisting 
ship types, with nice deck plans.  My Supplement 7 is falling 
apart...but I still use it.

But

In the Niven stories the hulls were sold by the Puppet Masters.
There was a limited number of hulls types to choose from.  I always

My hope is that you are wrong.  So I have not yet cancelled my
pre-order.  But I am going to withhold any more dollars to IG 
until I see what they are releasing.  

Last night I read some ancient magazine reviews of early CT 
products.  White Dwarf gave 10 out of 10 ratings to Adventure 3,
Double Adventure 2 and others.  What type of ratings did Next Error
receive?  I don\'t know, I never found any.  Sort of tells you 
something doesn\'t it.

Another idea sort of based on space elevators is a spinning pole.  
The poles middle (and most of its mass) is out of the planets atmosphere.
As it spins one end of it will come close to the ground.
By using any type of flight technology (including lighter 
than air) cargo and passengers could be transfered to the 
the end of the pole and pulled into space.
An equal amount of weight must be placed on the other
end of the pole for transfer to the planet and extra
thrust must be applied from time to time.

Why do you think GURPS Space is currently more populare than Traveller?
The StarWars RPG is entirely background based.  I\'ve never touched
Battlelords of 23rd Century so I can\'t compare it.

>If all Traveller is suppossed to be is a set of mechanics, then why

My point exactly!  Why bother including such things in the rule set!
I\'m not objecting to GDW or IG releasing suppliments or adventures
using Virus as background but I do object to them including Virus
as part of the rules!

I could take the rule books for StarWars RPG and tear out the background.
But why should I bother when there are better rule systems out there that
don\'t restrict my campaign ideas or force me to shift through several pages.

>Rebellion even be an issue?  If you don\'t like technology tied to

Jump space was never part of the rules.  Only the observible effects
of the jump drive were part of the rules.

Hopefully you woun\'t mind to much if I keep trying to convince
reader of this list that Traveller was once popular because the
rules didn\'t presuppose explanations and background.

When an explanation I don\'t like is centeral to a set of rules then
it becames very diffucult to remove it.  Again, my point is if the 
background is mixed in with the rules and a new GM doesn\'t like the
background they are not going to like the game.

Traveller was once generic.  Traveller was also once very popular.

There was a Star Trek role playing game called Federation.  Another Sci-Fi

that they claimed "Was the playable one".  Traveller was the first 
Sci-Fi game to attract a large market share.

Ah, but social and political reasons might be used to include them!
In my own campaign the world of Weldon has a beanstalk to showcase
their technology.  Using the stalk is a symbol of ones social standing.

Not me.  I\'ve never used the 3rd Imperium so I could care less about it.
What I\'m complaining about is the complete and total blending of 
the 3rd Imperium background with the rules for the game.

What does this have to do with a consistant, well defines, usable set
of rules?  Virus is a plot device nothing more.  Again, the Imperium
is NOT Traveller.  Even the MegaTraveller rule books claim that 
the game is called Traveller and the background of the rebellion
is MegaTraveller.

The problem we all have here is no one really knows what\'s going on with the
new rules.  It\'s all bean counting and skill arguing.  If we had an idea as
to the basic mechanics of the system worked we\'d probably all feel better,
or horrified depending upon your point of view.  I\'m not going to pass
judgement on the system though untill I actually see the beast.

I guess I"m kind of blind to the old appeal of Traveller, not having used
the old rules in many a year and having watched the GDW house system evolve
over ten years I\'m extremely comfortable with the system.  I appologize to
anyone I have offended with my over zelous defence of the TNE system.  Nuff
Said...

Actually this is not true there were rules for starship construction in

I don\'t see how Virus was enmeshed in the rules.  Sure the Virus was
mentioned in background refrence materials but whether the virus was there
or not made no difference on the task determination etc.  It was all just
background for you to use or ignore at your own discression.

Actually I got involved in a campaingn called Rom\'s in Space where we all
played Romulans.  What fun.  Calling in photon torpedo\'s for ground support.
But I digress.  I guess that would simply be a continuation of the
Federation Milieu.

I think what Stu was trying to say (we had a short discusion about this a week
or so ago) was that the Virus information was placed right in between the
Character Generation section and the Skills section, allowing any player to
stumble across it while flipping from section to section.  For those referee\'s

Sup 7: Traders and Gunboats gave deckplans and USP info for ships such as

possibly one or two more.  My players still ask me if I ever found it but I\'m

I ran a game where the PC\'s were pirates.  (That\'s why I designed the 
advanced charcter generation system for pirates - the players wanted to 
play pirates, and didn\'t like the basic character generation.)  It was a 
one-scenario game, however, so didn\'t last more than a few sessions.  
This was on of the few times we got into boarding and whatnot (most of my 
campaigns were light on space travel).  

BTW, when the new Traveller comes out, I\'ll be updating my Pirates, 
Spies, and Belter character generation systems to comply with the new 
rules and take advantage of the new skills and such.  Expect that in 
August or September . . .

Charles,

It sounds like a good idea...IF what you\'re talking about won\'t mean a 
lot of new skills.  That is, if we can have a top-level skill of 
"Researcher" then a cascade of all the different areas of research, I\'m 
all for it.  But if what you\'re proposing includes the idea of having 
top-level skills like "Theology," "Computer Science," etc. with cascades 
under /then/, it would still require a massive skill list, which I oppose.

I think this could be done in the former way, so it sounds like a really 
good idea.  True, it is a departure from the way Traveller does things, 
but . . . .

\'course, since T4 is very close to going to the printer, this whole 
discussion is probably moot. :P

Lest the lists become bogged down in the pessimism recently expressed 
herein, I\'d like to let everyone know that I am very, very optimistic 
that T4 will turn out to be the system almost everyone here can agree on 
using.  There will be a few CT, MT, and T:NE hold-outs, undoubtedly.  
But I think T4 will unify the disparate factions of Traveller players, and 
allow us to work together to create better gaming experiences, to the 
greatest extent since CT.  

If T4 had abandoned FF&S entirely, a large group of players (the 
gearheads) would have been left out.  Thankfully, Mr. Golden and IG, 
along with Derek Wildstar, came up with a series of solutions that will 
satisfy all of our tastes...while allowing us to exchange designs, no 
matter which of the three ship design systems we use.  

Including FF&S in three forms was /not/ a negative thing.  It was an 
overwhelming plus for /us/.  It was an inclusive move by IG, and they 
will reap the economic rewards thereof, while we all reap the rewards of 
having a larger pool of talent (that\'s all of us!) using the same 
system, rather than three or four different, incompatible systems.

This, of course, works hand-in-hand with the multitude of Milieux that IG 
will be supporting.  No matter which of the official Traveller universes 
you like, there will be one for you...plus other, new ones! 

T4 is going to be a great product.  We\'ll each do some tweaking in our 
own campaigns, but when has that not been the case for ANY RPG?!? :)

This was a huge problem.  I think they should have had a section near the
back for all that kind of stuff.  As opposed to sticking it right after
character generation.

Deckplans oooooooooo.  I\'ve looked through all the recently created stuff on
all the web sites.  Both TNE and MT and rarely, hell it\'s the exception
rather than the rule do people bother to include deckplans.  I personally
love deckplans, it\'s something concrete something I can hold in my hand and
say THIS is my ship.  With out a deckplan it\'s just a bunch of numbers on a
page.

Did a boarding action in a game I was playing, it got so harry one of the
PC\'s accidentally grenaded a guy in a closet.  Actually we think it was a
kid.  Ten sessions later I accidentally killed him.  Long story.  Ain\'t

I thought that the most likely candidate for Droyne homeworld was
Andory/Five Sisters.

That raises another question:  I\'ve seen the two worlds spelled differently

Yes, let\'s have replicants going berzerk and killing people!  Whooee! :P

Seriously, I think the cyberpunk sub-genre is pretty well covered by 
other games (TM).  Until MT, Traveller wasn\'t a "dark future" game.  With 
the breakup of the Imperium, and the Virus era, not to mention the "Heat 
Death of the Universe" milieux already planned, I don\'t think it\'s 
necessary to add yet another dark future scenario...

Just my opinion, of course. 

- -Joe

BTW, lest anyone misunderstand, Blade Runner is my favorite movie of all 
time, and I\'d love to see a RPG based on it.  I just think Traveller 
isn\'t the game for it.

Yeah, that would probably work just fine.  Quite a few folks
(scientist/engineer types) have looked at the concept in the past and
it\'s well grounded <pun intended>.  The problem is the cable has to be
made of unobtainum!  <g> The tensile strength of diamond fiber would
do it, but it\'ll be a while before we have that much diamond fiber
cable.  A beanstalk on the moon would be doable with current
technology..maybe Mars too, not *sure* about that.

>In Scotland we have a third verdict in court: "Not Proven".  This is
>how I feel about Space Elevators. 

Sure, *nothing* is really proven until somebody does it. <g>

Here are some more ideas I\'ve run across over the last 25 years..all
very possible, all very unlikely to ever be built. The people
describing them were engineering types, and the science behind them
seemed sound.  If nothing else they\'re ideas we can incorporate into
games to give them some flavor. [Source Analog magazine]

1.  Space Fountain - Your elevator cable is composed of a framework of
semi-circular magnets (think mass driver).  Fire iron slugs up the
driver and back down to the ground.  The slugs provide support for the
framework.  Once you start, keep adding sections to the framework
driving the slugs higher and higher until you have reached a hundred
miles or so.  Attach a car to the framework and ride it to orbital
altitude. Supposedly, if this thing collapsed it would fall straight
down and not spread out.  Supposedly it would work.  (I\'ve got doubts
about this one, but I seem to recall Dr Robert Forward writing about
it.  <G>)

2.  Space Loop - Link lightweight magnetic strips into a loop a couple
of hundred miles long.  Put several strong magnetic drivers along the
strip and start accelerating the links.  As the links accelerate along
the ground centriphical force causes the top half of the loop to
elevate.  At some speed the top of the loop is above the atmosphere. 
Link in slightly more massive links as the whole thing is spinning for
increased support.  Now construct a *lightweight* framework around the
loop, and you can send a tram around to the top and back down on the
framework. You could also drop an elevator cable down from the top. 
Believe it or not, the science behind this one looks solid.  Dangerous
as ##$@!  Probably expensive as that too..but most likely doable. The
suggestion was to do this at sea down along the equator for safety
sake.  This macro-lariat idea came from some folks down at Texas A&M.

3.  The Walking Stick (Or as I call it "The Hook") - Don\'t build a
beanstalk down to the surface, instead put a relatively small station
in low earth orbit.  Extend a cable from the station from either side
and rotate the station against the direction of orbit.  The cable will
approach the ground such that the relative velocity between the cable
and the surface is only a few hundred (or few thousand) miles an hour. 
Now a sub-orbital spaceplane flys up and matches speed with the cable
(remember the cable is overtaking the earth\'s rotation), and links a
cargo pod onto the cable.  The pod rides the cable up into space as
the station pulls in both cables.  The station loses momentum, giving
it to the pod, so the station has to boost now and then to stay in
orbit, but it\'s cheaper to boost *from* orbit than to boost all the
way too orbit.  This idea is a small part of the tests the Shuttle\'s
been doing with that long cable they\'ve been extending out the bay. 
The other part of the idea is to generate electricity from that cable
extending through the earth\'s magnetic field...the station steals
momentum from the earth using the earth\'s momentum to help it maintain
orbit.  The cable doesn\'t have to actually enter the atmosphere, or be
all that long.  This one could really work, and wouldn\'t cost an arm
and leg to test out.

4.  The Space Ring - Now this one is *far* out!  Build a linked ring
around the earth in orbit.  Suborbital spaceplane flys up achieving
the altitude but not orbital speed.  Figuratively *lands* on the
ring..actually links on and uses the ring\'s momentum to pull up to
orbital velocity.  The ring maintains it\'s orbit stealing from the
earth\'s momentum.  The fly in the ointment is getting the ring in
place in the first place, and it has to be a complete ring for
structural stability.

I honestly *love* ideas like this! <g>

One was far sure and another *might* be, the report I saw wasn\'t
clear.  This really surprised me too.  What\'s a gas giant doing that
close?  Shouldn\'t the solar heat and wind driven off all that hydrogen
from the inner system?  One of the giants should be in the star\'s
lifezone too!

I doubt it.  IG has been *dead* silent on system generation, and
that\'s *my* real interest..not gloveboxes in Scout ships.  <g> The
system gen rules haven\'t changed much (any?) since book 6. My
expectation is they\'ll stay the same in T4.

>However, our own system seems to be the exception rather than

Too soon to say.  Some of the earlier planet sightings had giants way
out like ours are.  I\'m guessing we\'re closer to the rule than the
exception.  As the accretion disk condenses the majority of the
lighter gases are driven out of the inner system leaving smallish
metal heavy planets close in and larger hydrogen heavy planets further
out.  The break between inner and outer system seems to be where water
freezes out.

That\'s not true.  

"Early in his life, Grandfather selected a star system as a base for his
activities, and this system became the core of his pocket universe.  Of the
several planets within the system, the main one is physically nearly
identical to the Droyne homeworld and has been seeded with animals and
plants from the homeworld as well."  Secret of the Ancients, at 32. If it\'s
"nearly identical" to the homeworld, it isn\'t the homeworld.

Thus the location of the homeworld remains a mystery (for further referee
development).

There are TONS of game son the market right now.  All have rules most are
different.  Almost every one of these games also has a game background
that the game is designed for.  Without the background the game doesn\'t
always work right.  Even the supposedly Generic GURPS Space heavily relies
on the background of the Space Universe.  Sure you can modify it, but the
best selling GURPS modules, and one of the reasons of its success is the
creation of Worldbooks based on popular Sci-Fi.  Sure the rules allow for
almost anything, but GURPS sells tons of Worldbooks for a reason.

Traveller is inextricably intertwined with the Imperium.  Does this mean
that you have to set your games there?  No!  However, I have never thought
that any incarnation of Traveller was the best RPG on the market from a
rule standpoint (maybe TNE was OK, but it too had problems).  However,
what has kept me interested in Traveller is the fact that the 11,000
worlds of the Imperium even existed.  Someone mentioned Battlelords of the
23rd Century.  It is a good game.  The rules are OK, but what makes if fun
to play if the background.  Can I design one better?  If I could I would
have my own game on the market.  If you want to design your own...more
power to you.  But if you want T4 to succeed, and I am not sure that
everyone on the list feels that way at this point, then background is the
key.  Vampire, Werewolf, Mage, and Changeling are poor games in my opinion
from a rules standpoint, but from a background standpoint they are
probably the best on the market hands down (GURPS even copied them). 
Shadowrun is the same, fair rules, but incredible background.

Personally I am hopeful that T4 will be a success.  I harbor no love for
TNE over any other Traveller rule system, and IMHO no setting compares to
the Rebellion for intrigue and adventure, but I am willing to give M0 a
try at least for a bit.  I have been vary happy that IG has listened to us
on the list, and realized that TNE had DEFINITE improvements over all
prior incarnations of Traveller.  In the immortal words of Rodney King
"Can\'t we all just get along?" B-)

Waiting for T4 with baited breath so I can try and prove that Fighters are
the key to any Space Navy...

Maybe the fact that there was a section on Virus in the main 
rulebook???  pp. 74-79 if you\'re looking.

It gave deck plans for about a dozen or so standard Traveller ship 
types (Scout, Lab Ship, Far Trader, XBoat, etc), along with High 
Guard stats, and new encounter tables.  It was probably the single 
largest collection of deck plans released for the game.

Worth it if you can scrounge a copy for the deckplans alone.

Sorry, but it *is* in orbit, because its *center of mass* is moving at
the correct orbital velocity.

Again, no. The anchor mass, if cut loose would go into a *different*
orbit, because, being *higher* than the center of mass, but moving at
the same angular velocity, it is moving *too fast* to be in a stable
orbit BY ITSELF. As part of the *system* (cable, station, more cable,
anchor mass) it will be stable.

It\'s perfectly possible. If you have a satellite in orbit, and extend a
pair of cables with weights on the end, one towards earth, the other
*away* from earth, your orbital period does not change, because your
center of mass is in the same location. But the fact that the weights
at the ends of the cables would be orbiting at different speeds if they
weren\'t attached to the cables means that they experience an apparent
"pull" away from the center (the satellite). This is the force that
causes tides!

And while we don\'t have materials strong enough for beanstalks (that
cable is under a *lot* of tension), we have *already* experimented with
tethers in space. Many satellites use them to keep pointed at the
ground. And the Shuttle did an experiment recently that was going fine
until the cable snapped.

Well, if T4 survives long enough to make it an issue, I\'m going to try
adding some alternate technologies, and even approaching a couple of
authors I see at local cons about letting their "background" get used.
(F.M. Busby has a couple of good settings: the Rissa Kerguelen
universe, and the more recent series with the Traction Drive, and the
Habegger Gates)

And I knew *no one* who used the campaign background. We rolled our own.

I just basicly group things that "work similar" together. Then the
rules mavens can decide if they want to stick my grouping into
"overgroupings". 

And no matter *what* we do, they\'ll get it wrong. I still remember
DMing D&D in the "old" days. We finally had to drag out some tourney
weapons and stick some of the players in a ten-foot wide archway
between the living room and dining room and say "ok, this is 10 feet
wide. *Show* me how you are going to get five guys with swords to fight
there...." :-)

Not quite. The hull impacted a *lot* of antimatter atoms. Finally
enough atoms had annihilated that the hull fell apart.

Uh Oh, you are enmeshing the scenario with the rules. I am not saying

This was just an example of new components. 

I would also like to see rules for things above tech level 15 such

I\'m just getting back into Traveller, after several years of not playing at all
(e.g., I totally missed TNE, and all that went on with it). What exactly

Hehe!  Yeah, boarding actions are NOT like your typical dungeon crawl. 
;)  My players found that out, too.  They got out their mapping tools, 
ready to approach it as a D&D-ish thing (remember, this was our first and 
only boarding action).  Surprised the heck out of them when the 
"monsters" (occupants) didn\'t wait patiently in their rooms for the 
players to dash in and kill them. :)  

Sounds like your boarding action was a sneak maneuver.  My players 
weren\'t so lucky.  The party to be boarded knew what was going on (they\'d 
been holed prior to the boarding), and took appropriate action.  It was 
more of a mass battle in the corridors than anything else...

An old story.  It all started when Gary Gygax, designer of AD&D, 
either left T$R, or got fired by them, or whatever it was.  Anyways, 
GDW, looking to get into the Fantasy RPG market, hired him.  Gygax 
wound up designing Dangerous Journeys for them, which was not all 
that successful for GDW.  To make matters worse, T$R claimed that 
Gygax had been working on and designing DJ when Gygax was still 
working for them.  GDW contended that he did not.  TSR wound up suing 
GDW for a pretty large sum of damages, and won.  It put GDW in a 
fiscal crunch from which they never really recovered.  Ironic, 
because Dangerous Journeys itself was not a successful product for 
them, or so I\'ve heard.

So if we\'re getting a modular ship design system for T4, how about a set of
modular deckplans to go with it? Or at the very least a supplement full of
the deckplans for the new \'standars\' designs?

I suppose it would be too much to hope that someone out there has produced a
deckplan-building tool, have they?

I don\'t understand. I haven\'t signed off on a Repackaged TNE. In fact, I am a
champion of simpler is better, playable is better. I do know that we all
benefit from having consistency in game systems so that the simpler does lead
to logically to the more complex. And I am not one to throw FF&S out just
because it is TNE.

So stick with us at least until you see the product in August. Then, if you
don\'t like it, flame us (and me) all you want.

If Agents is like Spies, that one won\'t be updated. :-)  (Which will give

Ah..nothing like having a new RPG to tweak and add to...I can\'t wait!

You\'re right, I was confused.  I didn\'t read what you wrote correctly, 
and came to the (wrong) conclusion that you wanted a CyperPunk milieu.  
My mistake.

Yeah, this would be good to have in the basic rules.  It would give 
referees a standard set of technology that could be used in settings 
beyond the Imperial maxiumum tech level.  Then again, maybe this stuff 
will be included in a future milieux that deals with something past the 
Virus era - maybe the Heat Death of the Universe milieu will have such 
technology.

I\'m sure that MM could answer this 1 better, but I believe from 
reading the text of the AOL conferences that he owns the rights to 
Imperium.  The credits say that it was Marc\'s design, so he should 
own the rights.

Marc, 

I remember reading on 1 of the webpages (something reposted from AOL, 
I believe) that IG had intentions of designing a Strategic Level Wargame for 
use with the Traveller system to fight Imperium style battles.

Are there any specific plans to rerelease Imperium, or any of the old 
Traveller related wargame titles (Invasion: Earth & Fifth Frontier 
War) or would this wargame that will be designed basically have scenarios 
to replace it..

If memory serves, the rules for prosthetics given in Digest (I think
- - certainly it had a pale cover with a Vargr on it) were quite sufficient
for cyborgs. Certainlt sufficient for me to play one, and to introduce
another into my own campaign later on.

The production of a FRP called Dangerous Journies.  Developed by the
Anti-Christ of role playing Gary Gygax.  Apparently he originally wanted to
call it Dangerious Dimensions (D&D).  Didn\'t just sue them, sued their pants
off as well as their skivies and anything else they were wearing or might
wear tommorow.

Actually they were waiting for us too.  We were in light battle dress and
they weren\'t.  Our job was to secure engineering.  You\'ve never seen so many
HE grenades used in a small environment, man was that nasty.  They\'d set up
a HMG just inside the airlock and were dug in around the bridge and
engineering.  Eventually we took the ship though, not without major
casulties, no fatalities on our side, they weren\'t so lucky.

I hand construct them.  I\'ve got a number of pregenerated components. ie.
doors beds, iris valves etc.  The problem come in working out a scale so
it\'ll all fit on one page.  It would be nice but beleive it or not Windows
Paintbrush works just fine for building deckplans.

Yeah, I\'ve found most of these the last couple of years since I was 
on the web. But I\'ve had supplement 7 for about 12-13 years now.  
I have high hopes that T4\'s Starships will publish deckplans, along 
with all those nifty ship designs...

It definitely gives the players a little more to envision, and makes 
the ships seem more real.  Props are always good...

My roomies used to go thru *several* xeroxed copies of the deckplan of
their ships in a gaming session. Either because they were fighting on
board, or they were trying to figure out where the battle damage was,
and how to work around it. 

You haven\'t heard real anguish until you\'ve watched a player realize
that the last hit they took wiped out his cabin, including the
battledress he\'d had so much trouble obtaining. Worst part was that the
last hit was his fault, everybody else had wanted to cut their losses
and run... :-)

Trouble is, the very positions of the stars are different! We know
*that* much from the Atlas of the Imperium, and a few other supplements
that had star maps that more or less covered that area.

I happen to *know* Keith Lofstrom, the guy who came up with this one.
He isn\'t at Texas A&M, though for all I know, he may had worked with
folks there.

The "loop" consists of a bunch of iron plates. No connection between
them. Something like this:
    +--+
    |  |
<-- |  |
    |  |
    +--+
You run them thru an evacuated tube on the ground, sort of like a mass
driver. At each end, you have *big* magnets that bend the stream
through an angle. Two sets at each end. So after going through both,
the stream is headed back to the other end, Sort of like this:

                        ->
      ----
    /                                                  \\
    ----
                        <-
It\'s around a hundred klicks between  the ends as I recall.
The reaction forces from bending the stream around require the *lower*
of each pair to be well anchored to bedrock. The upper pair "float"
supported be the thrust involved in bending the stream. They are
anchored to (kevlar?) cables to help even out any variations in thrust.

You start adding plates to the stream and extending the angled sections
of the tubing. This slowly raises the upper part of the loop. Once you
get high enough, you can can quit extending the tubing, as the air
pressure is as low as it is inside.

To use the loop, you magnetically "grapple" to the stream. As you grab
harder, it slows down and you speed up. Note that the upper section of
the loop is the slowest and it is still somewhat above orbital
velocity.  

Anyway, you just let the "drag" from the stream of plates against your
magnetic field drag you on up, and on the upper section, either boost
you to orbital velocity, or brake you. 

The worst thing that can happen is failure of one of the 4 "corner"
magnets. If it\'s the "up" magnet on the ground, you just let the steram
of plates fly through a gap in the magnet and break through a
replaceable pressure seal. They wind up in the ocean. You generate a
*lot* of steam, and rusty ocean water. :-) And you are out the energy
you invested in speeding up the plates, and the cost of the plates. The
energy is the most expensive part. The upper stations will have
parachutes. So re-erecting is an annoyance.

If the "down" ground station fails, due to the angle, you can still
dump into the ocean, but you want deeper water there.

If the ascending station on the upper portion fails, you lose a bunch
of plates, as they\'ll be above escape velocity. If the descending
station fails, you\'ll have a shitload of plates in orbit, and a fair
chance of recovering them. 

The loop concept would be well suited to atmosphere 0,1 and 2 worlds.
Beanstalks are suited to smaller worlds, regardless of atmosphere.
Tether systems (skyhooks) are workable on just about anything, but how
workable depends on details of the planetary system. Space fountains
are best for low g worlds, I\'d think. Low atmosphere would help.

Actually, as I recall from a discussion elsewhere on the net, theplanet
may *mass* as much as (or more than) Jupiter, but there\'s no evidence
that it\'s a gas giant! One of the others seems to have *some* possible
spectral data, but mostly these are detected by gravity effects alone.
So all we know is the orbit size and the mass.

Picture a "rocky" type planet with the mass of jupiter and the orbit of
Mercury or Venus! Yow!

I\'d actually hope that we can get a re-write on them. Something similar
to the three stage ship design rules. Something quick and simple for
the novice GM, something more detailed for when you need more, and
something as detailed as the scouts book (or PBH) for folks like me.
:-)

But the trick would be to make them *compatible*. The rules in the
first three books, and in the scouts book did *not* work especially
well together.

Also, as has been noted, there are some major hole in the "simple"
method unless you either assume that there are a *lot* more alien races
(to explain the low tech levels and high populations on worlds that are
"uninhabitable" by humans), or do a *lot* of handwaving. Especially if
you take stellar type into account.

Without backgound a game is just a set of rules.  But I don\'t aggree when 
you tell me that unless I use official background my game isn\'t working right.

This wasn\'t always the case.  It\'s been true ONLY from MegaTraveller on.

So you won\'t be interested in Traveller if the Darrains destroyed another
star system and left the Imperium with only 10,999 worlds?

The fun (IMO) is not designing rules, rather it\'s designing background.
And yes I do think I can do better!

Why do you have to wait for T4?  It\'s your campaign.  If you

Another use for space tethers in around planets with magnetic fields.
A long tether can be used to generate power.  Imagine a large space

1)  There is no place on the USD chart to enter data on the Avionics (in 
my case, TL 11 Military) or communications (again, in my case, Improved 
TL-11).  Is this to be provided in the paragraph description, then?  Or 
did I miss something?

2)  The tables in the QSDS system should follow a standard format.  
Rather than having the Crew column in one place in one table and in 
another in a different table, put each column heading in the same place 
on each table.  if a column heading isn\'t needed for a given table, 
obviously just put the next one to the left that is needed in its place 
and adjust the others accordingly.  I found it bothersome to have to keep 
hunting for where the volume, price, crew, etc. were located on each table.

Other than those two quibbles, it is an excellent system!  Thanks, Guy!

The following skill list is a modified version of the one the Mark Miller 
posted to the TML a while ago.  His list had 81 skills.  This one has a few 
more (total of 96 skills).  I\'ve tried to keep things basic, in light of 
several requests to KISS, but wish to say that I personally feel that 
keeping the number of skills down is unimportant.  It does not complicate 
things to have lots of skills.  One simply rolls against "Pistol, Slug" 
instead of "Firearms".  I don\'t see how this makes things any more 
complicated for players or GMs.


SPECIALIZATION 
For those of you who prefer a more detailed skill system, I suggest an
optional "specialization" rule, whereby one can pick a more specific area
within a discipline and recieve 1.5 * skill level (round down) in it while
recieving only .5 * skill level (round up) in every other aspect of that
skill.  Some GMs may wish to make this rule mandatory for some or all
skills.  At the same time, some GMs may wish to make specialization
unavailable for some or all skills. 

Note that the "specialization rule" also helps to resolve several 
controversies that have flared up on the list.  First Aid can now be a 
specialization of Medical, Theology a specialization of Philosophy, and 
so on.

Another advantage of the specialization rule is that it allows seamless 
creation of new skills by simply making them specializations under 
existing skills.  There will be no need to re-invent a bunch of tables 
every time you want to add new skills to the character generation system.

Okay, enough with the blather, here\'s the skill list.  As always, I would 
like to get as much feedback as I can.  Let me know what y\'all think!

(Also, let me know if this two-column format comes out readable).

SKILL LIST:

** Indicates a "new" skill that was not on MM\'s posted list.

# Indicates a skill which has been modified from MM\'s posted list.  i.e., 
the skill\'s name/scope has been changed, or it is now  part of a group of 
skills which represent what was a single skill on MM\' list.


***WEAPON SKILLS (17)*************************

Archaic Ranged Weapons #	Artillery
Automatic Weapons #			
Blade, Short #			Blade, Long #
Club, Heavy #			Club, Light #
Energy Weapons **		Firearms #
Flail **
Gunnery				Heavy Weapons
Laser Weapons **		Sonic Weapons **
Neural Weapons **		Throw
Unarmed Combat#			Polearm #

Notes:
	- Weapon skills should be understood to include high-tech 
variants (vibroblades, monofilament flails, stun sticks, gauss guns, etc.).
	- Gun combat and Blade combat have been reorganized to eliminate 
the need for cascades.  In terms of character generation, there will be 
need for Skill Clusters like in MegaTraveller.
	- Fencing is a specialization of "Blade, Long".
	- Archery has been replaced with the broader "Archaic Ranged 
Weapons" so that it can cover slings and such as well.
	- Armorer is a specialization under Craftsman (or Repair?).
	- Brawling and various martial arts are specializations under 
Unarmed Combat.
	- Several weapon skills which were not included on MM\'s list have 
been added for completeness (lasers, energy weapons, neural weapons).


***MILITARY SKILLS (7)*************************

Battledress			Demolitions
Hostile Enviro. Combat#		Forward Observer
Leadership			Recruiting ** 
Tactics

	-Environment combat is now "Hostile Environment Combat", which is 
clearer and has a cool acronym (HEC).
	-Recruiting has been added.  
	-Combat engineer is a specialty under Design.
	-Camouflage is a specialty under stealth.


***ACADEMIC SKILLS (16)***********************

Archeology			Astronomy#
Biology 				
Chemistry			Economics **
History				Instruction
Linguistics			Philosophy
Physics				Planetology **
Political Science **		Psioncology
Psychology			Research
Sophontology #			


Notes:
	- Several new fields have been added, especially in the area of 
the social sciences.
	- Botany and Zoology are specialties under biology.
	- Planetolgy = "Geology", Sophontology = "Anthropology".
	- Theology is a specialization under philosophy.
	- Astrogation or Astrography can be spec\'s under Astronomy.


***CRIMINAL/POLICE SKILLS (10)******************

Bribery				Disguise				
Forensics			Forgery				
Gambling			Interrogation			
Intrusion			Investigation		
Stealth				Streetwise

Notes:
	-Fast Talk and Intimidation are specializations of Persuasion.
	-Pickpocket is a spec of Intrusion.


***TECHNICAL SKILLS (20)*********************

Aircraft			Communications
Computer			Craftsman
Designer ** 			Engineer
Farming **			Grav Craft 	
Ground Craft #			Hover Craft #
Navigation 			Robotic Ops. #
Photography **			Pilot 
Prospecting **			Repair #
Riding #			Sensor Ops.
Vacc Suit			Water Craft

Notes:
	- Vehicle skills have been re-organized somewhat.
	- Equestrian has been replaced by the more general "Riding".
	- Electronics, Mechanics, Gravitics and Robotics (in terms of
repair/maintenance) are specializations under Repair (or Designer if one
wants to create complex new items).  Designer is an engineer (in the 20th
century sense).
	- Ship\'s Boat is a specialization under Pilot.


***PROFESSIONAL SKILLS (15)********************

Acting#				Art#
Administration			Animal Care **
Bargain **			Broker
Dance #
Diplomacy 			Law
Medicine			Music #
Politics **			Steward
Trader				Writing #

Notes:
	-Performance has been replaced by separate skills (acting, art, 
dance, music, writing).
	-First Aid is a specialization under Medicine.
	-Animal care includes such things as training, husbandry, 
herding, etc.

***OTHER SKILLS (10)**************************

Athletics			Carousing
Jack-of-all-Trades		Survival
Language (pick one)		Observation **
Orienteering **			Persuasion **
Reconnaissance			Survey 		

Notes:
	-Each Language is a seperate skill (English, French).  
Specializations would be for specific dialects (Quebec French, Parisien 
French) or specific uses (reading, writing, speaking).
	-Orienteering covers navigation on world surfaces, while 
Navigation covers jump space and pilot cover real space.


Okay, that it from me.  Again, any and all (non-flame) feedback is 
appreciated.

Happy Travelling,
Charles.

I\'m glad to hear you say that.  I must admit, as a simpler is better sort of
person (despite my notoriety for my MT design collection), the sudden influx 
of FF&S messages in my mailbox last week was a little worrisome.  Already
owning everything from DGP and GDW for CT and MT, I\'m still a little reluctant
to commit to buying the hardback T4 sight-unseen, but I\'m keeping an open 
mind.....

:with the same angular velocity as the planetary surface.

   Methinks you misunderstand the concept of Beanstalks.

   Now, I hope you understand the basics of orbital mechanics, but just in
   case here\'s arefresher.

   Objects stay in orbit by going just fast enough (but no faster) to be
   continually racing against gravity. Gravity pulls on the object, and
   the object travels *just* far enough that the amount that it falls
   matches the curvature of the planet. Orbital mechanics is influenced
   by a number of factors; gravity, the size/density of the planet being
   orbited, and the amount of drag encountered (primarily a concern at
   lower altitudes, say less than 150km) Gravity varies (using the inverse
   square law) depending on the distance from the planetary surface. This
   means that objects closer to the planet have to orbit faster.
   Clear so far?

   Knowing this much, a couple of things become obvious:

   1) Objects in orbit can match the rotational period of the planet in
      *only* one orbital band. (In Earth orbit, this is approximately
      20-25k miles)

   2) Objects matching the rotational period of the planet, but *closer*
      will fall from orbit. Objects matching the rotational period of the
      planet, but *farther* will leave orbit and fly away.

   Now picture this:

   A space station is put into orbit where it can match the rotational
   period of the planet. This space station has two reels of _very_ strong
   cable inside. Two BIG counterweights are attached to these LARGE reels of
   cable. Start reeling these cables, one leads DOWN to the planets surface,
   the other leads OUTWARDS into interplanetary space.

   Two things begin happening almost immediately:

   1) The LOWER counterweight is going _slower_ than it needs to be to
      stay in orbit, it will tug downwards on the space station. The
      farther down it goes, the harder it pulls.

   2) The HIGHER counterweight is going _faster_ than it\'s needs to be to
      stay in orbit, it will tug upwards into space. The farther out it
      goes, the harder it pulls.

   Keep going until you reach the surface.

   The biggest problem we face to construct a Beanstalk is NOT the orbital
   mechanics, but the sheer strength of the materials needed to withstand
   the stresses of such a construct. The two cables will have to be about
   50K miles total, and will not only have to carry the load it\'s lifting
   to orbit, but it will have to be strong enough to support itself, and
   that\'s no mean feat!

   You will also notice that *any* kind of failure in the structure is
   disastrous. The parts of the structure leading down to the surface are
   travelling *less* than orbital velocity. If a terrorist group planted a
   bomb on an elevator, and blew it up halfway up the stalk, the lower half
   of the cable would drop and hit like a bomb. Worse, it would be long
   enough to wrap itself around the Earth hitting a VERY large area and
   virtually certain to blast a large chunk of the ocean into the atmosphere
   causing some serious and longlasting problems with the ecosphere. (eg,
   nuclear winter or greenhouse effect - take your pick)

Classic Traveller was not intertwined with the Imperium.

Ah but the problem with the game system embedded with the rules is that
you have to do alot of work to extract it. 


Traveller has more structure and more defined things than GURPS does. Its
alot easier to design a game in Traveller since certain technology 
decisions have already been made by the game. I think that the Imperium
background is interesting, but I don\'t want it shoved down my throat so 
I can play a game.

Not a wise idea. The energy you get that way is subtracted from your
orbital velocity! On the other hand, if you have an independent power
source, you can use properly configured tethers to (slowly) boost your
velocity.

I can see it now:

IRS NPC:  Mr. Starkiller, we need to talk about your allowances for 
ships expenses.  For example, this set of receipts here... it looks like 
you\'ve been funneling money from the employee\'s pensions to the 
Ship\'s shadow fund for years...and all these deductions for ship\'s 
maintenance...I was not aware that a ship needed maintenance 6 times

If there were so many HE grenades used in the ship corridors, how was

Remember in Milieu 0 this end of the galaxy is just coming out of a
*long* dark age.  There are going to be lots and lots of planets at
TL7-10..right?  There are going to be planets that have NOT developed
gravtic technology, but have spread out across their system.  In fact,
there\'s nothing I know that links J-Drive tech to gravtics, so there
could be pocket empires out there with no gravtics.

So, on worlds like those beanstalks or space loops might make a *lot*
of sense..right?  

Even after the new Imperium drops by with gravtics, the good old stalk
will still be there and still be used.

Not to mention how useful deckplans are when you have shipboard
combat.  To me a ship design without a deckplan isn\'t finished yet!

Of course, a main world without the rest of the system laid out isn\'t
finished yet either. <g>

Regarding the problem of the "planet killing launch", I have an
idea.  Marc Miller has stated (in his "Foundations of Traveller" post)
that Thruster plates are gravitically based and that they work by pushing
off worlds and suns.  Could we not therefore say that the effectiveness of
T-plates drops with distance from these bodies?  This would put some sort 
of limiting factor on speeds, would it not?  For instance, you could not 
"accelerate in from pluto" because you would lose thrust as you moved 
away from the planet.  You\'d drift until you came across another body to 
push against.  

This might also solve the problem of conservation of energy.  Simply say 
that by some mumbo-jumbo the the ship robs momentum from the world it is 
pushing against.

I haven\'t thought through the specifics of this, so feel free to bash away.  
I\'m sure this has been brought up before, but I don\'t remember the 
conclusions reached.

Yeah, but you gotta admit that Gygax & GDW did give TSR some 
ammunition...

In a way, yes.  But, heck, was Gygax supposed to never write another FRPG 
again?  Never write an RPG of any type again?  

Let\'s assume Gygax left TSR, THEN decided to come up with a new FRPG 
because he felt that not being saddled with the traditions of D&D, and 
having quite a bit more experience at writing RPG\'s than he had when he 
originally started, would allow him to make a really great product.  He 
contacts GDW, and they agree to publish it, since he is a "name" and they 
like the idea of filling out their line with a FRPG.  

If something like that was the case, what should they have done in order 
to avoid giving TSR ammunition?  Should Gygax be barred from making 
FRPG\'s?  If so, TSR should have paid him to agree to that (it\'s been done 
- - Nolan Bushnell, the man who founded Atari, signed a five-year non-competition 
agreement with Warner Communications when they forced him out).  

Unless TSR had evidence that Gygax had worked on the game while he was in 
their employ - using TSR\'s facilities, equipment, supplies, and/or time - 
then they had no basis for their claim.

This is all speculation, of course.  It\'d be great to know what really 
happened.

Actually, in a lot of businesses, this is pretty much SOP.  In my 
last job, my boss, (basically, a middle manager), was forced to sign 
a non-compete clause.  I would imagine that Gygax, as a top level employee, 
probably did get to sign a non-compete, but I don\'t know for sure...

Of course, non-compete clauses are not always enforcable either, 
courts have nullified them under some circumstances.  I don\'t know 
the specifics of the case, but I\'m sure TSR\'s contention was either: 
A) He was working on it while he was at TSR (in which case it could 
be intellectual property of TSR); or B) It borrowed or infringed on 
TSR\'s previously held copyrights.  I would suspect that TSR contended 
a little of both.

True...

I agree.  It\'d be good to hear the tale from GDW\'s side.  I\'m not 
really all that interested in TSR\'s story, as I consider them to be 
the 500 lb. gorilla in the RPG market...  I\'m sure that they just 
crushed GDW\'s hopes with money.

...which is rather bizarre, as the likelihood of ANY FRPG, including one 
by Gygax, eclipsing the D&D franchise is next to nil.  If you mentioned 
the name of any RPG to the average person on the street, you\'d get no 
recognition of the brand name - unless you say, "D&D" or "Dungeons and 
Dragons."  TSR has played that franchise well, considering the whole 
role-playing industry caters to a fringe group.

Anybody else remember the old Dungeons and Dragons ads that would 
air at Christmas time many years ago?  

Remember JC Penney selling TSR products, including D&D and Dungeon?  They 
also sold some Grenadier models.  This was back in 82-83.  

Man, if IG  and FFE could get the Traveller name out there like Marc has 
been talking about, there\'s no limit to the sales potential.  Which 
brings up a point I worry about: popularity generally means the product 
has been homoginized beyond the point where I can continue to enjoy it.  
Will the traditional Traveller be something the masses want, once they 
are made aware of it via TV, movies, and books?  Or will it be necessary 
to dilute the product in order to gain that mass audience?

No, actually, it\'s more like Gygax ALONE gave TSR the ammo.  GDW didn\'t 
know that Gygax had worked on the game while he was still at TSR.

The way I understand it, TSR had proof that Gygax had come up with the 
concept of DJ while he was still at TSR.  From what I understand, that 
was the basis for their suit against GDW and Gygax.

Since I intended one of the 400-ton hulls for this purpose, I\'m glad you
were able to make it work out well.  :-)

A couple of comments about your design:

> Tons:  400		Volume: 358.5		Cost: 180.32 (135.2)
                                ^^^^^
Confusing terminology time: In the QSD System, I consistently used
Displacement Tons as my unit of volume.  I hate converting from cubic meters
(or "kiloliters" for those of you brought up on MT) to displacement tons and
back again.  For the QSD System, the larger units made more sense, so I used
them exclusively.  UNfortunately, the USD is supposed to give the ship\'s
volume in _both_ systems.  "Tons" in the USD refers to volume in displacement
tons (just like in the QSD System), but "Volume" in the USD refers to volume
in cubic meters (an alien concept to the QSD system).

SO, for QSD System users, the USD Volume is USD Tons times fourteen.
In your case, this is 5600.

> 00 Fire Control Rating		03 G Rating / Heplar
  ^^
I can tell that one of the captain\'s first targets will be to score a set of
military-specification laser batteries.  The master fire directors included
with those will increase the ship\'s fire-control rating, giving it a +3 to
hit, and enabling the ship to engage 3 targets at once (both of which are
important to a pirate).

Power plant rating is 2 times MW divided by displacement; rounded to the
nearest whole number.  In the case of your corsair, this works out to 3.

Yes.

Neither one makes a difference in the combat of the ship, so neither one
appears in the USD display.  The avionics type can be inferred from the
Control section of the USD: "fib" indicates military avionics, and the TL 
should be the TL of the ship.  If the avionics differ for some reason
from the normal assumption (and the corsair\'s don\'t), then it should be
noted in the description.

The communications don\'t appear in the USD at all; you should note them in
the description somewhere.

> 2)  The tables in the QSDS system should follow a standard format.  

You\'re right, they should.  I didn\'t even _think_ of this \'till someone
noticed it.  For what it\'s worth, they\'re in whatever order they came out
of my spreadsheet in (which usually indicates the order that the columns
appeared in FF&S).

I doubt that there\'s anything I can do about the copy that was typeset this
week (except hope that this change occurred to Don as well as you), but I\'ll
update the copies I maintain ASAP.  That way it can be corrected on the Web
site, and maybe for the second printing of MMT.

Ah, nice! :)

Thank goodness! I\'d meant to request comments in my post, but I left that

have no experience with FF&S, I figured there\'d have to be some errors!

Ahhhh....now I get it. :)

I realize it\'s too late for the version to appear in MMT, but \'twould 
have been nice to have a column giving that value (yeah, it\'s a simple 
calculation, which is even explained in the QSDS text, but still....).

Sounds reasonable.  Again, being unfamiliar with FF&S, and having limited 
descriptions in QSDS (no quibble there - that sort of detail should be in 
the combat section, which I didn\'t download) I didn\'t have much guidance 
on what sort of weapon system to put in.  So I just stuck to what the 
Supplement 4 description gave in Book 2 terms.  I\'d definitely add the 
military-specificaton laser batteries if I were designing the Corsair again.

Yup.  As I said in my email to you, I read that sentence in QSDS several 
times after I got the fractional answer, and always came up reading it as 
/divide by 2/.  Sheesh!  :)

Cool.  I\'ll download it again then.  Now that you\'ve corrected my errors 
and given me some more insight, I can more confidently do some more ship 
designs!

Yes, please, that would be great.  If you could add the military-type 
batteries that\'d be excellent as well.

That was rather naive of Mr. Gygax, then.  I work at a holding company\'s 
corporate offices - where absolutely no products are designed or created, 
only accounting and financial functions are performed - yet even I had to 
sign an agreement stating that using company time, facilities, equipment, 
etc. for personal or personal business uses could, at the company\'s 
option, result in: termination, company acquisition of any economic 
benefit derived from such activity, company acquisition of any products, 
services, or entities derived from such activity, etc. etc.  

It\'s sad that GDW had to suffer for EGG\'s mistake.

	The Corsair, and armed raiding ship, is mostly used by Pirate 
characters.  Notable features on the corsair are large cargo doors and 
variable identification features.  The large clamshell doors can open to 
reveal the entire cargo bay.  The ship has several centrally controlled 
identification features which can be used to disguise the ship: radio 
emissions alter frequency and content, and the ship\'s transponders can be 
altered to identify the vessel as having any of a variety of missions and 
identities.
	The Corsair is not normally available on the open market, as the 
ship is a non-commercial type.

Yup.  Once in a while I\'ll bring in some Traveller books and work on 
my campaign on my lunch hour.  People will take a look at the books 
and wonder what it is.  I\'ll explain it\'s an SF RPG.  They\'ll give me 
a confused look.  Then I compare it to D&D, and a look of recognition 
will cross their face...gotta give TSR its due...they do have brand 
recognition...

Yup.  Still have 1 of the old boxed sets rotting in a closet

Weeeellll, let\'s not get too enthusiastic.  The golden age of RPG\'s, 
when even Aunt Betsy was buying D&D books, is about 10-12 years 
behind us.  Probably the best shot to get it in front of a larger audience 
would be novels and computer games...both of which reach into a little 
less of a fringe market, anyways...

Unless I miss my guess, Traveller: The Motion Picture is not coming 
to a theater near you...at least not in the near future anyways...

This I didn\'t know, although I wondered.  It would make sense that if 
GDW had known, they would have stayed about a million miles away from 
Gygax...

===================
Issues:
1.  The Avionics and Communications thing mentioned earlier.
2.  The inconsistent ordering of columns in the tables.
3.  The Crew issue.  Using the "standard" QSDS caclulcations, I had a crew 
of 12 before I began rounding down and assigning two jobs to other people. 
(5 Engineers, 2 Maneuver, 2 Electronics, 1 Medic, 1 Steward, 2 Command).  
The guidelines for combining crew positions and reducing crew size for 
smaller vessels is too sketchy.
4.  Miscellaneous Equipment.  The Shops and Labs section needs more info: 
are Engineering Shops, Vehicle Shops and Sickbays mandatory when you have 
enough engineers, small craft or medics?  How does the mass/volume of small 
craft effect a ship when in External grapples?  Does this add to the volume 
of the ship when calculating Jump and Maneuver Drive volume?
5.  The Universal Ship Description.  This needs to be clarified.  It could 
use an example.
The Controls section probably is where the Avionics/Commo info would be, but 
that is unclear.
6.  The Jump-2 drive in the Far Trader only added 200,000 Cr to the cost and 
no extra crew.  This seemed a bit odd to me (though not all that bad).

Overall, it took me about 45 minutes to do a design on pen and paper.  I 
then spent about 15 minutes creating a simple spreadsheet, and now it takes 
about 10 minutes per ship.  I have about 5 other designs, which I\'ll post 
this evening or tomorrow.

Well, actually a lot of people _do_ buy GURPS for the rules (you may
not be aware, but a lot of people, possibly the majority, of GURPS
players use worlds not in any supplment).  However with that
disclaimer I agree with you.  There are a lot of rules out there
and without a radically different approach, Traveller isn\'t
going to win a lot of people just to use it\'s rules.

Games like Hero and GURPS are in a different situation since they
offer rules that can be used for more than just one genre.  For
Traveller to compete on this basis they would have to racially
change the scope of the rules.

Actually, this explanation doesn\'t work.  Any time you got more than
a few light minutes away from a planet your delay would start causing
problems.  Also, in many situation you are  going to have to try using
nearby stars which will not only have delays of years before it
takes effect, but would be impossible because you wouldn\'t be able
to collumate a beam of gravitons sufficiently.

You might as well just do what was done in Classic Traveller.  Ships
have "manuever drives" which are reactionless, and leave it at that.
That\'s what I do with my Traveller (though I never liked thruster
plates, they reduce what could be an interesting situation with
side effects and unexpected uses to a cold sterile, "the ship moves").

Yaay!  Can\'t wait to see the corrected versions.  I was just looking at 
Supplement 7, trying to decide whether to do a Far Trader next or not.  
Now I can go on to something else . . . (though, methinks there is going 
to be a flurry of QSDS ship designs, so I\'d better do it sooner than 
later...grin).

Agreed.  Must be a standard thing under FF&S, though, since QSDS is a 
derivative work.  But, the huge jump in the number of crew members 
bothered me, too.  That means either more NPC\'s, or more player 
characters.  Neither sounds like a good idea to me.

Depends on what you mean.

I have a set of standard items created in SuperPaint.  When I\'m detailing a
room, I just copy-&-paste them in.

Admitedly they look a bit low-tech, because I started doing this in colour
for Space 1889, and haven\'t put a lot of time into conversion.

Now, if a kind artistic soul was to email me some 300 dpi PICT (or GIF or
TIFF) top-view images of beds, fresher cubicles, control consoles... I could
quickly convert all my deckplans to gloriously coloured masterpieces :-)

Seriously, though, I\'d be willing to do a lot of the drawing is someone could
create nice fittings.  My current standard is 2 yards/metres to the inch with
no squares draw on the plan.  Instead, I place a small red cross (0.25 in) at
the centre of the square.  This is less obtrusive, and also means that narrow
corridors don\'t look strange.

I think Matt has some of my 1889 deck plans at the heliograph site.  Check
them out for an idea of what I\'m talking about.

I\'m terribly sorry to have to re-re-post this.  I created a ship design 
spreadsheet, and found that when I made the change to military lasers I 
had not performed the calculations correctly.  So, the cargo and cost 
values have changed.  Again, I\'m very sorry for posting this three times.

(My excuse: I\'m on the last couple of days of my Honeymoon; designing 
ships and doing calculations probably isn\'t a very good idea, considering 
the ... er...distractions I\'m facing. :)

Here is the corrected QSDS Corsair.  I added the standard military laser 
batteries, but this bumped the cost up quite a bit, of course.  I also 
added a short description, mostly cribbed from Supplement 4.  (Although I 
did change the mention of retractable fins, modules that "appear and 
disappear," etc. as I wasn\'t sure how well that would mesh with a 
detailed design system like FF&S.) 

Under "Cost" I have given the full price, with the discounted price (for 
using off-the-shelf components) in perenthesis.

identification features which can be used to disguise the ship: radio 
emissions alter frequency and content, and the ship\'s transponders can be 
altered to identify the vessel as having any of a variety of missions and 
identities.
	The Corsair is not normally available on the open market, as the 
ship is a non-commercial type.  
	The crew, as with any craft, may be smaller in actual use.  The 
Captain may choose to have some individuals performing more than one 
function.  For instance, the Command positions may be filled by a senior 
Engineer, a senior Electronics specialist, with the Captain also being 
the Pilot or Astrogator.  The actual number of Engineers and Electronics 
specialists (including those also filling a Command position) may not be 
decreased without increasing the likelihood of equipment failure.

It gets worse...my bride is an RPG and videogame nut, so there has been 
more time spend on these things by both of us during our honeymoon than 
would probably be considered healthy by any rational person.  Than God I 
didn\'t marry anyone rational. :-)

    'body' => 'Hi,

Since Carole, my new wife, is busy with the new videogame I bought her as 
a bridal present, I decided to try my hand at another ship design before 
getting back to more important matters [G].  I tried to be very careful, 
and I double-checked my work, so I hope this one won\'t require re-posting.

First, I\'ll give the stats on the ship, then a ship description, and 
finally a little discussion of the QSDS system and some other design notes.

Crew Detail (Minimum) : Engineering-2, Electronics-1, Gunner-2,
			Pilot/Astrogator/Commander-1, Medic-1, Steward-1

(Note: The Medic and Steward may be foregone if no passengers are carried.)

==========================

The Secure Trader is designed for use in transporting goods and 
individuals to and from hostile areas, as well as transporting goods and 
individuals that have a high probability of attracting hostile 
attention.  Since a much higher price can be commanded for such 
transportation, this Trader is capable of making a profit for its owner 
in spite of the higher price in comparison with the more commonly used 
Far Trader.

The main causes of the high price of this ship are the weaponry and the 
hull, both of which exceed the standards for trading vessels.  However, 
they also allow the Secure Trader to survive in situations that would 
destroy the standard Far Trader.

While the small staterooms have been designed with the crew\'s use in mind 
(excepting the Captain), Travellers experienced with this sort of ship 
have found it sometimes necessary to have the crew double-up in large 
staterooms because a passenger\'s social sensibilities require that his or 
her retenue use smaller accomodations than are used by his- or herself.  
With eight large staterooms and nine small staterooms available, it is 
possible to come up with many variants of crew and passenger arrangements 
able to please even the most discriminating passenger.  In addition, if 
no high passengers are available at a given port, the Captain can always 
sell middle passage and allow the crew to use the high passage staterooms 
(doubling up or not, as the situation warrants).

Not every Traveller will desire a Secure Trader, but for those who have a 
true sense of adventure, it can bring rewards rarely seen by the timid 
captains of standard trading vessels.

============================
Design Notes:

This is the type of ship my former players (back in CA) would have loved 
to use.  I figure there must be others out there who would like such a 
ship, so I designed it.  Hopefully, you\'ll find it useful.

QSDS Notes:

I found a couple of typos in the QSDS.  The Standard Military Laser 
Batteries chart has a colum for Price, which should be labeld Cost to 
keep it the same as the other charts.  The same goes for the Standard 
Civilian Laser Batteris chart.  
The Standard Sensor Systems chart has a typo under the Improved TL 12 
sensor system\'s USD.  The other entries in the column go Ax Px Jx, but 
this entry is ordered Ax Jx Px.  Given the values involved, I assumed the 
J and P had been transposed, but the values had not.  But, I really can\'t 
be sure.


Anyway, I hope a use for my design is found.  If someone comes up with an 
improvement, please let me know.

        I\'d say the vast majority of are GURPS users are not using any of
the published backgrounds.  The historical and licenced ones are of limited
interest (except the White Wolf conversions), and the two original ones
haven\'t done well.
        Of course Traveller did start as a generic SF game...just try
finding any mention of the Imperium in the original set.  It would actually
handle C. J. Cherryh\'s universe quite well.  (Considering her first book
came out around the same time as Traveller, I sometimes wonder....)
        Anyway, even though the rules have stood the test of time better
than anything else of comparable age, for me the setting is the main
attraction.  Epic scope, all sorts of adventures, interesting alien
races....  The Library Data is such a good way of presenting information I\'m
surprised I haven\'t seen anyone copy it.

        By the way, I\'m new here, what precisely is QSDS?

James,

QSDS is the Quick Ship Design System, which was created by Guy Garnett 
(AKA Wildstar@qrc.com) in response to a ...er...mild disagreement that 
occurred recently between those who want a system like Fire Fusion & 
Steel (very very detailed) for designing ships, those who want something 
like High Guard (somewhat detailed), and those who want something like 
Book 2 (very simple) to be used with T4/MMT.  It turns out that Imperium 
Games will re-release FF&S, better edited and with a new name, for T4 
at some point, but will be including something called FF&S Light 
(designed by David J. Golden) in their Starships supplement (this is the 
high-guard type system, fully compatible with FF&S), and Quick Ship 
Design System (the Book 2 style system) will be in the basic rules book for 
Marc Miller\'s Traveller.  

This way, thanks to David Golden and Guy Garnett\'s game design abilities 
and dedication to the game, as well as IG\'s open policy for customer 
suggestions, everyone should have a system that is right for them...and 
all systems are compatible with eachother.

QSDS is available online at http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/  (there\'s more 
to the direct URL, but that will get you to Guy\'s home page, and you can 
get to QSDS from there).  FF&S Light is on David Golden\'s web page, but I 
don\'t recall the link right now. :(

Also I\'d like to see some new ideas on disguise for this sort of ship; eg in
my ship, I have installed thrusters with extensive battery banks so it can
operate with its fusion plant shut down, the asteroid is nickel-iron with 
carbonaceous coating to absorb light, and the thruster radiator fins are 
recessed into a crater at the back of the asteroid so its EM signature is 
reduced. Other features (EM arrays, weapon bays, airlocks, fighter/small craft 
launch tubes, the spinal mount) are also recessed into craters in the surface 
for camouflage.

Any ideas/ship designs rattling around out there?

Gee, that\'s gonna cause a revolution in math! The biggest number I can

the number of "curves" that can be drawn in a plane ("curves" because

If you want a "less pleasant" game, I just came up with a scary
thought. 

Near as I can tell without being cleared for such high security
material, it should be possible to cross Traveller with Paranoia! Heck,
you could just call it a *weird* strain of "the Virus". 

Now *that* would a strange game!

That is absolutely true. If you use the term, "Role-Playing Game," people
have no idea what you\'re talking about. If you say, "You know, like
Dungeons & Dragons," immediately the realization of what you\'re talking
about crosses their face, and they wonder why you, as a grown man (in
my case), are playing games meant for pimply-faced adolescents. The
general public doesn\'t realize that this is the hobby of many people, and
that a whole industry supports it.

Yup. I got my first (and my last :) copy of Dungeons and Dragons from
Jamesway (a now-bankrupt department store, like Kmart) when I was a
kid.

I don\'t think so. I was always a fan of Star Trek, even before the movies.
Now that it has exploded in popularity, I\'m extremely happy, because that
means that Paramount feels it is worth it to pump more money into the
project. So when I once had only 76 original-series episodes to watch,
now I\'ve got the original series, 7 movies, and three TV series to watch,
and another movie is coming out in November. I\'ve got a copy of the Star
Trek RPG (original version--which I believe also came out of the JC Penny
catalog in about \'82), and I get the Star Trek Communicator magazine.
That\'s enough for me, but there\'s a ton more Star Trek stuff out there I
could get involved in (I\'ve never been to a convention) if I felt it was
worth the time. Because of its popularity, I can now immerse myself in
Star Trek. And it hasn\'t been diluted one bit. There\'s still the same
techno-speak there always was. If anything, it\'s been expanded.

Wouldn\'t you enjoy it if the same thing happened to Traveller? If
somebody didn\'t know what a RPG was, and you said to them, "You
know, like Traveller." Or to have Traveller novels, TV series, movies, etc. I
think that would be fantastic! And the point is, it can happen. If Paramount
could do it with Star Trek, which is sort of pseudo-military based, don\'t
you think it could be done with Traveller, which can focus more on the
non-military-type adventures? I think it can, and I think it will.

This is great stuff for conspiracy theorists:

What if (tongue placed firmly in cheek) TSR and Gygax plotted the demise
of GDW all along? Gygax would get fired, but would leave "evidence"
either in his user directory on the network, or in a file cabinet
somewhere, that he had worked on the FRPG while at TSR. Maybe just a
preliminary outline would do it. GDW jumps at the chance to have Gygax
design a game for them. The network administrator "finds" the outline in
Gygax\'s user directory when he deletes his account at TSR, and the rest
is history.  :-)

How could the computer be in charge if it does not have FTL travel. All
you need is one or two rebel X-Boat pilots to screw up the transmissions
between the computers.

There\'s nothing better then having players involved in a boarding action who
say.  Okay we\'ll call up the standard deckplans.  Fine.  They run aboard and
the deckplan is diffenent because the owner has modified it heavilly over
the last twenty years.  The looks on their faces a priceless when they find

Right.  Imagine me as I appear during my lunchbreaks sometimes - 
a grown man, wearing a three-piece suit, reading Traveller books.  To 
the average person, a "serious businessperson" such as myself should 
never be engaged in such "childish, frivolous" pursuits as role-playing 
games.  Little do they know that more thought goes into the average 
Traveller campaign than most "serious businesspeople" spend on their 
personal lives as a whole. ;)   

The detail work involved in doing any of the major functions of a 
Traveller referee (world/star system bulding, ship design, etc.) would 
surprise most people.  Our little secret is that it is such enjoyable 
work! :)

It was evil, and that\'s probably the best word to describe it.  EVIL.  But
we were doing good, the priate was attacking a merchant, and well they won\'t
be offering evidence at any trial that\'s for sure.  I\'d do it again in an

Actually that wasn\'t a problem.  They\'d set the powerplant on overdrive and
blew the ship up.  After we got the hell out of there of course.  In
Engineering we never used anything bigger than an SMG and we did remarkably
little damage, we didnt\'t miss a shot that time.  However, the powerplant
was to far gone by the time we got there.

I can gloss through the system but if there isn\'t a main world map I\'m

I\'ve allways assumed that the tech level of a world rated the worlds
ability to manufacture.  Airless worlds with tech level of 3 had to

No, no, no.  Gygax wasn\'t behind the bushes on the grassy knoll...he was

Actually I always thought that the idea of a genetic engineering computer
gone mad creating all kinds of horrific lifeforms and releasing them into a
controlled environment, then trapping the characters in that place would be
pretty scarry.  Kind of TNE meets alien meets predator meets the terminator
meets dark conspiracy meets call of chuthulu.  Brrrrrrr.....

Trouble is, the very positions of the stars are different! We know *that* much
from the Atlas of the Imperium, and a few other supplements that had star maps
that more or less covered that area. <<

While the opportunity for a comment like that was wide open, I thought
we could avoid the whole mess through proper application of taste and
pun filtering.

if you want to take over/control/economically benefit from a battle, the
cheap, kill \'em all attitude is a failure. You\'ll spend more re-building,
re-propagandizing survivors and your own people than the cost of a landing
and precision bombing, even tho the latter has a higher initial cost.

If you want to simply eliminate the opposition, DK\'s and nukes are the way
to go. But you still must convince at least those doing the attack that it
is the right thing to do, and then survive the inevitable political
backlash when word leaks out. (And, yes, no matter how black the op, word

IMHO:

Drop troops are for securing an LZ for less mobile troops, despite R
Heinlein\'s Mobile Infantry. Traveller Drop troops are not RH\'s MI, despite
the obvious insiration therefrom. MI were in existance to fight the bugs.
Traveller has few bugs (Noted ones include the Chamax), but lotsa DT\'s.
DT\'s are a cross between paratroopers, spetznaz, and Ogre/GEV (by SJG)
infantry: light, fast, practically invulnerable to non-power-armored trops,
and victims of tanks in direct fights. they are as mobile as infantry, with
the ability to survive hostile environments, but a tank can kill them with
frightening efficiency (See MT, striker or striker II). they hit dirt
between 5 and 15 minutes from orbit drop, and saturate a small area, and
hold until reinforced by landing ships, some 10 to 30 minutes later. then
they reinforce the tanks. They often are grav-capable, so they can keep up
with  non-grav tanks well enough, and a combined landing force of DT\'s and
grav tanks is quite potent, as well as capable of a wide range of action.

their expense makes them the beach head takers, and the other (army) troops
follow them in.

First and foremost a marine, first and foremost a DROPTROOP!

Good for you!  I may be a heretic, but IMNSHO, every GM decides in
what *universe* his/her game takes place.  The GM can choose to accept
or reject *anything*..even what some people call canon. Maybe
*especially* what some people call canon!  <g>

I can gloss the system too, but I *hate* doing it.  In fact, heritic
that I am, I don\'t really like the idea of "the main world."  <g> In
many systems there are several settlements scattered across several
worlds.  The players might have business at any of them.  

I set up lots systems where the "Port of Entry" is a good starport on
a small airless rock with only a few hundred people employed
there...often a moon or an asteriod.  Cargos and passengers incoming
or outgoing to other systems funnel through there.  

Sometimes they aren\'t even allowed to take their ships to other
locations in the system..for various reasons.  Maybe the local
government wants to control imports/exports (tarrifs, religious
reasons, etc).  Other times it\'s said to be a "safety" measure, for
whatever reason.  Often the real reason is to force ships to buy fuel
at the offical gaspumps. <G>

The main population centers are elsewhere in the system.  So are some
of the adventures.  <g>

I *do* agree with you about maps.  I really like maps too! ;)

No, the original poster is right.  When you move a conductor through
a magnetic field you generate electricity, but you have to apply
a force to more it (which here will show up as drag on the vehicle).

If only there was a computer program that would do this and not create ten
thousand pages of tables.  Something that details a system like we would
detail a system.

This is a cool idea.  Like Gateway Station.  I never though of it for Trav
though.  If you look at a Starwars Module "Platts guide to Starports" there
are some very cool ideas and sketches in there.

I hate buying fuel from the locals.  I\'ll go out of my way to get it free.
I\'ve got a system where it\'s illegal to use active sensors on the main
planet.  Why?  The locals are hiding something?  The Ancients have set up a
taco stand?  Who knows but when you give players these kinds of regulations
they go nuts.  Well I know, but that\'s none of their buisness.

Maps are the best thing a GM has for story telling, prop wise that is.

Brad, the reason I brought this up was I am under the impression that you

        I generally gloss the system, but that\'s because I like the more far
ranging campaign, where the characters are likely cover a great deal of
distance.  Just how many systems do you have the energy to flesh out?
        Now I freely admit I will detail any system where I think the
characters will spend much time...and I do feel guilty about glossed
systems, but I get impatient.

        Makes sense...I like this....

        I love maps.  Anyone have world maps they\'re willing (and able) to
share on the net?

There is one other alternative, albeit above TL17; grandfather has
constructed gates that allow instant travel to a pocket dimension, where
you drive a day or so to another gate out, and have wound up between 2 and
8 parsecs distant.

these gates appear in secret of the anchients, IIRC. I KNOW they appear in
a CT numbered GDW produced adventure.

Mission:
The Ajax Frigate is designed to "show the flag" and discourage piracy.  As a 
representative of Imperial might, it can patrol systems where sending a cruiser 
would be uneconomical and/or over-kill.  However, it should be more than capable
of seeing off a corsair or two with its particle accelerator and missile 
barbettes, whilst defending with sandcasters & laser turrets.  It is not 
designed to fight larger craft, so no meson screen is fitted.

Possible. Though as I\'ve pointed out, moving by "pushing against
planets" has some rather surprising *inherent* limits. Like the energy
requirements going up as your speed relative to what you are pushing
against increases.

No no no! A British Billion is 10^12, not 10^9, a million millions rather
than a thousand millions. Similarly a British Trillion is a billion billions
(10^24) rather than a million millions (10^12).

Oh, I have campaigns where the characters cover a great deal of distance =

Sure. I have 57 world descriptions including maps here at home. =
Unfortunately for the international gamers, the descriptions are in =
danish. The detailed stats and maps should be readable for everyone, =

The documents are in wp51 format, the maps are mostly in wpg format, =

I have a crudely drawn blank world template using Windows Paint...  
I\'d be willing to send it to you (or anybody else who\'s interested) 
or post it someplace if someone wants.  I asked several months ago if 
anybody had a template and nobody responded, so I created 1 myself.

Well, after glancing at 600 or so pages of digests, I see my (mostly)
throwaway line about notes for a Midnight at the Well of Souls generated some
interest.

Some background is in order, then...

Set the wayback machine for 1977. Star Wars is out. Traveller is out. Some
early Jack Chalker--Jungle of Stars, Midnight, Web of the Chozen is out. Fred
Kiesche, Ron Fischer and a few others are at Rutgers University. The pot is
stirred.

In those early days, there wasn\'t much structure to the Traveller universe. I
remember my roommate Ron going to Origins and bringing back exciting news
about Traveller (AHL! Fifth Frontier Wars!). But we mostly ran our own stuff,
based on a weird mixture of Larry Niven, Jack Chalker and others.

One adventure we ran was--well, we never really had a name, but called it
(jokingly) "The Web of the Bloodretch". It was a weird mixture of Jack
Chalker\'s Web of the Chozen and Midnight at the Well of Souls, with character
transformations into an alien spieces, a wrecked alien culture, and a quest
to transform the characters back into humans. It was fun, but it was bad.

Fast forward a little. Add in Steve Davidson, somebody who actually knows
Jack Chalker. We\'re all talking about doing something, publishing
something...so of course we think of doing a RPG based on Midnight.

The race is on. We call GDW. We do a conference call with Loren Wiseman and
Marc Miller. We get tentative permission to use Traveller (sans Imperium
background) for Midnight the RPG. We contact Eleanor Wood Agency about Jack
Chalker. We start negotiations.

Enter Tim A. Green of TAG Industries, mostly known (at that point) for sewing
bags to hold dice.

TAG Industries and Davidson/Kiesche start a bidding war for the rights to
Midnight. TAG is backed by Tim\'s father, who has (we hear) $$$. We only have
$, generated by our salaries and savings. $$$ beats out $, so we lose out.
The project collapses on our end.

I toss my notes in a fit of anger.

About a year later, TAG comes out with Midnight. Plans are announced--Basic
RPG, lots of modules, a board game based on the Wars of the Well World
(sequels numbers 2, 3, 4), miniatures, etc.

The game bombs. The game does not sell. The game bites big time. TAG vanishes
from the map.

Who knows what would have happened if we had the rights and were able to slap
"Based on the Traveller system" on the front?

Web of the Bloodretch still exists in a few pages of notes, somewhere. As
with my first "dungeon" for Empire of the Petal Throne, it\'s rather sketchy
and pretty awful. But you can\'t toss some things...

I have Glimmerdrift & Ley as well.  I\'ve used them several times for 
campaigns in the past.  I was never sure why GDW declared them 
heretical, er, non "canon"  I also had Maranantha-Alkahest & Gateway. 
The nice thing about them was that they all linked together when at the time 
the only other published sectors out there were Spinward Marches 
(which GDW beat like a dead horse in the CT era), and Solomani Rim 
(which during the pre-Rebellion era was frankly a pretty boring place 
to adventure for the most part).  Having 4 cohesive sectors, most of 
which the Imperium had little or no control of, gave plenty of 
opportunities for far-flung campaigns...

Frankly, Atlas of the Imperium wasn\'t all that great, and conflicted 
with other sources, including GDW\'s in some instances...

What the heck, its not like anybody designed some to replace them.  
You\'d STILL have to design 1 of your own if you decided to run your 
campaign there.  So why not use them if you got them.

represents a solution to a problem or goal.  In the case of the stardrive

I think it\'d be a really cool campaign to have the characters encounter an
alien race who uses warp technology. It\'d be really interesting if the
players had to flee a space combat situation: their ship would disappear
into jump space, and the aliens would be like, "Hey, man, what
happened?"

Not necessarily dumb.  You could seriously mess with the consistency 
of your particular universe by allowing different forms of FTL 
travel...

The Imperium background would markedly different with say, widespread 
stargate technology.

I\'m goning to be taking over the TNE section of Dave Golden\'s page.  If
you\'d like I\'ll talk it over with him and perhaps we could post them there.
What do you think?

Yup, adventure 12, Secret of the Ancients.  The game refers to them 
as portals...

I\'ve been working on one in Corel Draw.  I\'m not terribly good with the
system yet, I\'ll be taking a course soon.  I\'ll let you know when it\'s done.

Has anyone seen the "Terralogicus World Simulator"  I\'ve heard about it and
I was wondering if it\'s any good.  It creates world maps.

The free trader as designed cannot pay for itself.  The higher cost along
with the crew requirements (which push up the cost of the life support) make
it impossible to survive without a subsidy or speculative trading.  This
also assumes full passanger and cargo loads per trip and no downtime.  The
bank would never make this mortgage.

Also note the Book 2 Free Trader had 10 state rooms, which ment 8 high
passages available instead of only 6 passages in the 10 state rooms of the
QSDS design which unbalances it even more.

I can appreciate the want for designs to be consistant from the beginers
sequences to the advanced sequences, but they also have to be compatiable
with the basic game.

Actually thats FF&S that says that not TNE.  And in a round about way it
makes sence.  There should only be one method of travelling between the
stars, only one way of breaking the laws of physics.  Granted it would be
cool to watch the aliens faces when that happened.

You know you make these things make out of stone with odd ancients writing

If you can read PDF files, I have a couple of them - one for design and one 
for "display" if you will. You can get them at:

http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/archive/pdf/blank_planetary_map.pdf
http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/archive/pdf/planet_map_design.pdf

I also have a grid of hex paper:

made them all myself, originally with Adobe Illustrator.

I suppose next you\'ll be telling me that the amount of energy gained
will not be enough to maintain orbit AND power the station?  
(Darn those pesky laws of thermodymanics!!)

Well, at lest it could be used as a backup power system for a space station.

these numbers will change, so I will repost the final corrections after his 
QSDS rewrite comes out.  

As Rob Miracle has noted, the economics are somewhat out of kilter here, but I 
am not as concerned about this as Rob is, since it seems to me that we could 
solve this by increasing the standard prices for tickets and hauled cargo.  And 
the Free Trader carries only 6 High Passengers after all, according to The 
Traveller Book (p64).  I don\'t have access just now to the old 3-book set to 
see if that was a change, or what.

I am still VERY concerned with the crew figures (which contributes to the 
economics problems).  In vessels with large power plants, the Engineering Crew 
becomes huge.  Look at the Mercenary Cruiser, for example.  If there is going 
to be a crew adjustment, I would start with this area.  I still think a 
TL-based or computer-based crew modifier could be added onto the existing QSDS 
rules without disrupting the work Guy has already done.

Another area of confusion: staterooms.  The QSDS rules imply that the 
staterooms can hold maximum 1 person.   Is double-occupancy no longer allowed?  
Is it allowed only for Large staterooms?  Some clarification would be in order.

trader couldn\'t pay for itself.  He\'s right, but more of an
indication that the economics rules are broken than anything else.

	The \'Crewmember as employee\' paradigm that\'s used probably wouldn\'t 
apply to a small trader like that.  A major transport corp could well 
afford the Far Trader, because they\'ll get an even steeper discount 
on the ships due to volume purchase.  A Ford escort is cheap, but 
it\'s even cheaper when you buy five or six thousand of them, like a 
big rental company.

	A better economic model of an independent trader is exactly how
most Trav PC\'s with their own ships operate, as a partnership, with
shares in the profits as the only salary...banks make loans,
relatively large ones, on this basis all the time. Yes they\'re risky, 
and that\'s why they charge the interest they do.  Also skip tracing 
in the imperium must be a lucrative business (And sometimes the 
borrower gets caught...our dear guv\'nor was indicted on 23 counts of 
fraud, etc last week over a failed real estate venture.)

	"The life of a repo man is always interesting!"

	Also, the only income figures you used are from a universe where the 
ships get by with half the crews...if expenses go up, the rate for a 
high or middle passage is certainly going to be higher.  
Remember...if the crew needed for your little tramp Far Trader has 
doubles, so has the crew requirement for that luxurious 5000 ton QE2 
of the SpaceLanes.  That means you\'re applying the wrong income to 
the equation.  The same goes for cargo rates as well.

	This simply points out that there has to be a little inflation in 
the Traveller universe to account for the union rules for ship\'s 
engineers ;-)

Hmmm.  Depends on what the price of tickets and cargo is, doesn\'t it?  
I\'d guess that the cost of shipment will be higher at these lower tech 
levels.  As efficiencies improve (at higher tech levels), the prices will 
drop.  At least, that\'s my guess as to how this will all work.

The problem here is TL.  Book2 doesn\'t ever state TL.  We might assume
that it\'s TL11 due to the jump2 drive, but nothing else in the design
matches HG, so why should the TL?

In Traders and Gunboats the Far Trader is listed at TL10, but it has J2.
Book2 is broken (I say this because I\'m sure more ships were designed
with HG than B2, so HG wins :-).

I would also add that the technology that makes a sub-TL12 ship no
longer exists since MM decided on the Fusion+ hook.  I\'d be interested
to see if a HG design at TL12+ matches with a QSDS design.

As someone else noted, the economics have always been broken.  Muir did
some interesting number-crunching on this (since it\'s right up his alley
).

Terralogicus is actually pretty good, but it\'s tied pretty closely to
Astrologicus..or at least it seems that way to me. Astrologicus is
also pretty good, but the systems it creates aren\'t very
Travelleristic.

If you want to introduce alternate FTL tech you can, but Jump is the
\'canon\' approach.  

I\'ve used stutterwarp, hyperdrive, and ST-like warp drive in the past,
but I\'ve always limited FTL to just one way per game.  I could see
independent development of 2 or 3 methods, but I don\'t know if that
situation would continue long.  Wouldn\'t the best way soon become the
way everyone used?

The lack of FTL communications is also an important factor in
Traveller fictons. I *like* keeping communications down to the speed
of the ships.  I did run one game where there were FTL commo and
sensors, but limited their use by giving them a very short range and
high energy requirements.  They ended up being used in-system only.

Specifically, what do you want?  

I haven\'t been satisfied with any of the several programs I\'ve tried. 
Astrologicus is very good..for $50 it should be <g>..but it doesn\'t
really produce Traveller like systems.

I\'ve been working on a system generator for myself, off and on, for
about a year now.  The algorithms don\'t *exactly* match Traveller
standards, but they give equivilent results for the stars.  The
planets...I\'ve been having trouble with.  <G>

The prototype seems to be able to generate reasonable physical data
for the inner planets of GV type stars now, and I know how I\'m going
to extend it to other V class stars.  Now I\'ve got to work on the
outer system planets, asteriod belts, and *then* deal with the
cultural/social/ parts of each planet, and get everything into UWP
format.  Still a long way to go!

Here are 3 samples of what I\'m generating so far:

(Right now you specify the star class/type and distance in AU. These
are for planets at 1 AU orbiting a G2V star.)

AU:    1.00
Size: 17003   Size/Earth: 1.328
Dens: 5.443   Den/Earth:  0.990
Grav:  1.31
AirP:  1.37  Dense Atmosphere
Temp:   77c (Range:  52 to 102) Boiling, uninhabitable!

AU:    1.00
Size:  9196   Size/Earth: 0.718
Dens: 5.795   Den/Earth:  1.054
Grav:  0.76
AirP:  0.77  Standard Atmosphere
Temp:  -28c (Range: -53 to  -3) Ice locked planet

AU:    1.00
Size:  9631   Size/Earth: 0.752
Dens: 7.238   Den/Earth:  1.316
Grav:  0.99
AirP:  0.83  Standard Atmosphere
Temp:  2c (Range:  -23 to 27) Cool, Habitable from equator thru 
temperate zone

This is all I\'m generating for the planets right now, but I\'ve got a
start.  <g>

What kind of details do folks what?

Ah come on! <g> 

It really depends on the sort of game you want to run.  I prefer to
break as few phyical laws as possible while keeping the game fun. 
However, I reserve the right to decide just how many laws "as few as
possible" happens to be! <g>

IAC, under current theories we\'re breaking *lots* of laws with just
standard Traveller tech..<g>..and everybody knows it!  So, if a GM
wants to break a couple more and include a second FTL that\'s their
business..right?

Yep, all you\'ve said is right.  Notice that TNE goes on to talk about
Imperium tech as an example, though?  In the offical Imperium there is
only jump drive, but, of course, you don\'t have to play in the
official Imperium. <g>

Not really, limiting yeah, but not necessarily dumb.  Most people\'s
experience indicates that having more than one FTL turns out to be
more trouble than it\'s worth....generally.  Then again, don\'t let that
stop you!  Try it, maybe you can teach all us old dogs some new
tricks. <g>

I read this design as having 1 battery of 3-2-0-0 lasers.
2 more batteries of 3-2-0-0 lasers.
3 batteries of missile barbettes.
4 more batteries of missile barbettes.

As I remember, the first 2 digits before the battery are the *number* of
such batteries, not the number *of* the battery.  Is this wrong?

As for armor, I thought hulls were rated to gs*10?  That means for 4 gs
the hull has a base AV of 40 (BL) converted to BR it\'s 2, converted to
USD it\'s 20.  If the hull is rated to 6 gs, then the AV should be 20 as
well.  If the hull is stressed to 4 gs, then the structure is 14, if
it\'s to 6gs then it\'s 16.

I haven\'t looked at the others in detail (I was copying this one to test
fight it :-)

It details 7 starports.  From Kuat (home of KDY the company that builds 
Star Destroyers) to Port Haven (A smugglers Paradise).  It\'s actually 
pretty fun and there are some really good ideas in the book.

In TNE this is not much of a problem, most locals are incapable of 
stopping a determined starship.  In CT this could pose a real problem.

No kidding.  The sensor thing has them tearing their hair out.  
PLAYER:  What\'s going to happen to us if we turn the sensors on.  
GM:  You don\'t know, no one\'s ever done it before.
PLAYER:  So it\'s a tech 2 planet right.
GM:  That\'s what the UPP says.
PLAYER:  What\'s that supposed to mean?
GM:  Nothing.  That\'s just the listed UPP.

It burns their butts and generally speaking it motivates them into 
developing their own adventures.

I\'ve heard that it uses a system very similar to the GURP\'s system for 
planetary and system generation.  Friend of mine loaned me a demo of 
Terralogicus.  Don\'t like the maps too blocky, idea is good just doesnt\' 
go far enough.

This is true, unfortunately lets face it the average stutterwarp ship 
could run rings about a HEPLAR ship, not to sure about grav plates but 
introducing something like this totally changes the face of space.  You 
can do it just be very careful about the type of travel you wish to 
offer.

This is perfect in its level of detail.  Unfortunately most of these 
things will not allow you to input a UPP code and a star type and produce 
something that seems to make sence.

Also this kind of data us usually produced for every lump of rock in the 
system, so when you\'ve got five gas giants each with ten moons, well you 
can see what I\'m talking about.  A bajillion (very large number my 5 
year old cousin invented) pages of junk and only one useful page.  If the 
computer came up with lines like

1.  Searing rock, 5000km
2.  Wild Greenhouse effect, 8000km
3.  Size:  9631   Size/Earth: 0.75
    Dens: 7.238   Den/Earth:  1.316
    Grav:  0.99
    AirP:  0.83  Standard Atmosphere
    Temp:  2c (Range:  -23 to 27) Cool, Habitable from equator thru
    temperate zone
4.  Cool Rock: thin atmosphere, 6000km, 2 tiny moons: rocks
5.  Asteroids
6.  Gas Giant 85,000km, 15 moons, two rings.
etc.

Pehaps thats something like that it should read, for an entire system 
that is.  The planet generator should be able to reconsile the UPP.  ie 
if the upp comes up with a size of 1 and a vacuum atmosphere, perhaps the 
main world should actually be a moon of a gas giant and none of the other 
 planets are inhabitable.  This however requires judgement, something 
computers are not terribly good at.  It would be nice to see such a 
program though.  Just remembered the TPP code too, it would have to 
reconsile the number of gas giants and the number of asteroid belts and 
the planets population.  Wow that\'s a lot of stuff.

Right!  The GM has to live with the consequences of her
decisions.  <g> 

If you put stutterwarp in a game as one technology and have other
ships maneuvering with reaction drives then you\'ve got a potential
problem in game balance.  But there are things you can do...

Maybe stutterwarp can\'t get above 3xftp (400 days to travel 1 parsec),
so it\'s not as efficient or economical as regular jump drives, but
it\'s hell on wheels in-system.  Would Stutter be used as the FTL drive
on most ships?  Not if they could get jump, but it would be a good
backup and maybe an excellent Mdrive.

As far as in-system travel is concerned...well, stutterwarp isn\'t
normally FTL in-system and could have several potential problems of
their own:  1. doesn\'t work near a strong grav well, so you can\'t
land/launch with one; 2. doesn\'t give you *real* velocity, so just
*how* is a stutter going to match orbital velocities once it gets to a
planet (???), if it stutters up to the planet and turns off the drive
the ship\'s actual momentum probably won\'t match the planet\'s; 3.
standard stutters can maneuver like a banshee, but you don\'t have to
play them that way, there are very legitimate ways to limit their
ability to instantly start/stop and change direction.

BTW, I was thinking about (2) yesterday.  Stutter a ship in front of a
planet travelling in orbit at 30kps and turn off the drive. What\'s the
ship\'s momentum in its current frame of reference? Could be
anything..depends on what it was when it turned the stutter
on...right?  So, let\'s say for this example that when it entered the
system it had 0 momentum with regard to the star. Now you have a 30kps
KE bomb sitting in front of the planet!

So much for stutterwarps (or any reactionless drive) eliminating the
planet killer.  If there is a way to put a ship/object in the path of
a planet then the planet can provide all the KE you need for a big
bang.  Well, I guess you could get around even this, but it *is* an
added complication.

Yeah, at this point I\'m generating the data to go *into* a UPP.
Eventually, I\'d want to be able to take a UPP and expand it.

That\'s the kind of thing I\'m shooting for eventually.  

>From what I\'ve read about Milieu 0, we are going to know where stars
are (and I assume their type), but nothing much about the planets in
the systems.  Therefore, I\'m concentrating on generating planets,
moons, and such.

What I\'m going for is a program that, given a star (ie K2V) and
orbital distance, will produce a report on a single planet.  That
report could be a one liner or one with lots of detail..let the user
see both and pick which one they want.  Then print,or append to a
file.  If I do it right, you\'ll end up with as much or as little
detail as you want...well, up to the amount I\'ll have built into the
system.  <g>

You\'ve got that right!  <g> 

However, we have a computer networking with your PC that is (we

Yeah, I know, but I\'ll keep puttering along.  If I get something that
I think is marginally useful, I\'ll let everybody know.

So it doesn\'t have FTL travel (yet!). Once it gets jump drive, it\'ll
have to build a ship big enough to hold a copy of "the computer" and a
fair sized populace.

Consider a normal generator, with a coil of wire moving thru a magnetic
field (from a permanent magnet). The strength of the magnet doesn\'t
drop. The speed of the coil will drop though. Which is why it takes an
effort to turn the crank on a handcranked generator.

I am concerned for one very major reason:  We don\'t have any insite into the
game itself, except that it is to be CT updated for the 90\'s.  Trade has
been the same in every release of the game, save speculative trading.  The
core costs for fuel, passage and such have remained unchanged, and we can\'t
assume that Marc has changed the core game to fit ship building.

This goes beyond economics.  If the weapons are not compatible with the
combat system (which has in someways been addressed) then it won\'t work.  It
seems as if we have been creating a ship design system in the dark with
regards to the basic rules and we expect the rules to conform to our design
system.  Well, reality here, the design system has to fit the rules.

Crew figures are very high.  They are supposedly that way because of lack of
automation etc.  But if you look at every Sci-Fi anything, ships have
considerably smaller crews than is presented by FF&S (L/QSDS).  Even in Star
Trek, they were working on automation that would let a crew of two run a
400,000T ship.  The real world models that were discussed in baseing the
crew configurations on was based on military vessels.  Commerical Air liners
are crewed by very small crews.  But we arn\'t talking today we are talking
the future.

Look at "Foundation".  Look at any "invaders from Mars" type movies, even ET
only had a few crew members and most of them were probably
passangers/scientists.  Engineers just plain are not needed on non-military
vessels.  All other vessels, visit a starport every week.  If things need
fixed or maintained it is done then.  I think that one engineer per 500T of
hull would be much more realistic.  Under 500T, engineering duties are
handled by the  flight deck crew, ah la Hans and Chewy.  500T to 999T You
need an engineer etc.
Now for military vessels, the FF&S based crews are not bad.  They go on long
manuvers and may not see a port every week.  SDB\'s can be hiding in gas
giants for a long time and would need more on-board personel to deal with
problems, where as Oberline\'s is going to maximize space for passangers and
cargo, and have their facilities do maintenence while the vessel is in port.

There is a real inconsistancy here between the vessels in cost.  The Free
Trader is much more expensive while the Sub Merchant is much less.  And the
sub. merchant is supposed to be "subsidized" because its soooo expensive.
No none would need to subsidize the merchant because it will pay for itself,
but would need the subsidy on the free trader.

How did the sub. liner workout to be 1/4th the cost?  Most are within about
20Mcr (of course that is a 40% +/- swing on some ships)?

We\'ve seen the basic starship combat system, and the design systems
will work with the combat system; I\'m not as concerned about this (although
I would have liked to have more time for playtesting).

This has to do with the change in the basis for the design system.  In
Classic Traveller, the "big ticket" items were the drives.  In FF&S, the
most expensive components on the ship are the sensors and avionics.  These
tend to stay the same for all of the commercial starships (at TL-12 it costs
about MCr 16 for these items).  This makes the cost of a "minimum" starship
relatively high.

The cost of the hull and drives are (together) about half the total
cost of the ship; therefore larger ships are cheaper (per ton) than small
ones.  That\'s why the cost of the free trader has gone up, but the
subsidized merchant has gone down.

From: That Computer Guy <darkstar@chopin.udel.edu>

: A few ideas that popped into my head...
: 
: IMPERIAL INTERSTELLAR SCOUT SERVICE:
: 
: A triangle, point up.  from the two bottom corners of the triangel, arching
: up to about 1/4 the height, is a view of a blue-green planet (picture the
: view from the space shuttle).  Near the top, about the 2/3rds height line,
: is a sunbirst in red.  The rest of the field is black, with white/silver
: stars added.  The whole thing is surronded by a red border

But doesn\'t the IISS have it\'s own symbol already?  It should be that
little six-legged Sylean creature running in front of the Sunburst.
Now, if I remember correctly, the IISS grew out of the SISS (Sylean
ISS).  My guess would be that maybe the SISS symbol could involve the
herbivore across the starfield idea that you gave.  Then when it
became the IISS, they could put the herbivore on top of the Sunburst
(a tribute to their beginning as SISS and incorporate their new
identity). 

Also, didn\'t Cleon I come up with the idea of the Sunburst, or was it
one of his decendents?  Another thing to keep in mind.  If we plan on
not invalidating too many prior Traveller writings, then we should
keep in mind that the Sunburst\'s ONLY color was red.  This did
change around 400 (I think) when an Empress declared that the Sunburst
would have no official color from then on (this was due to the fact that
some IR seeing species couldn\'t even see the Sunburst).

Just stiring things up.  8)

recently there has been a lot of talk on xboat about FTL drives.  I was
wondering if someone could take the time to expain what a stutterwarp

thats where stutterwarp came from), but it sounds interesting.

Also, an adventure of which the focus was gaining a new technology to travel

And, I don\'t see why necessarily just because jump drive is say the best FTL

boats on Earth now.  People still use rowboats, yet they\'re less efficient
than motorboats.  But the trick is they cost less, and are easier to maintain.

Lastly, I was wondering what exactly this \'stutterwarp\' I\'ve heard mentioned is?

Correct...

Wrong...

I quote from the Imperial Encyclopedia, MegaTraveller: Listing under 
Imperial Sunburst.

"The symbol of the Third Imperium established by Cleon (the first 
emperor) when the empire was proclaimed.  Images show him standing 
before the original banner with a GOLDEN YELLOW sunburst against a 
BLACK background, representing Capital\'s type G star against dark 
space."

The emphasis on color names in the above is mine.

The original sunburst was yellow with a black backdrop.  Later, when the 
Eliyoh were admitted to the Imperium, they were unable to distinguish 
between yellow & black (their visual range was mainly centered in the 
infrared).  Therefore, Porfiria declared the symbol to have no official colors.

Again to quote from the Encyclopedia,
"The original banner in the Imperial throne room is still black with 
a yellow sunburst.  The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service uses a 
red sunburst; the Imperial Navy, yellow, the Imperial Army black; the 
Imperial Marines, maroon."

Red is not, and never has been the only color of the Imperial 
Sunburst.  If any 1 color can lay that claim, it is yellow.

The stutterwarp used a macro scale of the electron tunneling effect.  The
whole thing was some fellow, Dean, discovered that given the correct
circumstances electrons could disappear from one point and reappear
instantaniously several cm away.

Utilizing this knowledge the stutterwarp "tunnels" the ship it is  contained
in several hundred meters ahead by cycling the drive thousands of times a
second, getting the revs up, the ship could be made to travel at multiple
velocities of C when in deep space.  Stutterwarp is also limited by gravity
wells so the further a ship gets into a gravity well the less efficinetly
the drive works untill it completely konks out at 0.1 G.  After that you
need conventional thrusters.

What this means is that the ship has no actual forward momentum so
technically it\'s not breaking and laws of Einstineian physics.  Because it
lacks forward momentum it can turn on a dime and accellerate and decellerate
far faster than a regular starship which has to counteract all that momentum.

Because the ship is moving faster than C the first thing your sensors would
show is as it went past you.  Remember it\'s leaping in front of it\'s old
sensor image.  What this means is if two stutterwarp ships passed each other
in deep space a person staring out the window of one ship would see the
other ship suddenly materialize directly in front of their window then
receed off in both directions.  One as the ship actually leaves and the
other as the ships approaching images arrive to be seen.  Looking out the
back of a stutterwarp ship that turned off it\'s drive would produce and
equally interesting effect as all the images behind you caught up in reverse
order, so you\'d see the ship receed off into the distance as the images
caught up to you.  Pretty cool eh?

I hope this gives you a better handle on stutterwarp drives.  I could quote
it all from FF&S if you\'d like.  It\'s a little more concise and gearheaded
in there.

Actually, I wasn\'t so worried about what you said.  It\'s just that 
everybody was proposing all these early Imperial symbol designs with 
tons of red in them, and I knew there was something wrong, but I 
couldn\'t place what it was.

If we\'re going by previous canon (unless Marc wishes to invalidate 
it), the featured color for most early Imperial symbology should 
include lots of yellow...

This needs to be very carefully done. If a new drive technology comes 
along which is (a) cheaper and (b) better -- more efficient, whatever 
- -- than the current drive, there are going to be *major* economic 
effects. That means economic dislocation, civil war, strife and many 
other things which are going to reduce the quality of life for 
players.

The whole question rests on economics. If your new FTL technology 
isn\'t better (cheaper to run/but or faster or whatever) nobody\'s 
going to use it. Look at how Wankel rotary engines failed to take off 
(it\'s arguable that these in fact were superior to standard internal 
combustion engines, but from what I can recall they suffered serious 
reliability problems). If it is better, everyone is going to use it 
and after a while the old technology falls out of use.

Rowboats vs motorboats is a better analogy to intra-system travel. 
Think of it as HEPlaR vs. thruster plates :-) Better FTL drives will 
give you a situation more like sailing ships and steam ships. Don\'t

I read this design as having 1 battery of 3-2-0-0 lasers.
2 more batteries of 3-2-0-0 lasers.
3 batteries of missile barbettes.
4 more batteries of missile barbettes.

I was under the impression that the ## before the battery identified the 
battery, not the quantity of the batteries.  Guy, can you clarify?

That\'s the number of batteries

It sounds like what you meant was:

 2 Military Laser 3-2-0-0
 1 Missile Barbette 10 (10)

Note that missile batteries need two numbers: the number of missiles that
can be fired (the ready store, usually), and the number that can be
controlled in-flight at once (that\'s the number of MFDs times the control
rating per MFD).

System (QSDS) is available.  This is version 1.1 and if I\'ve tracked the
updates correctly it should be identical to the one that will be printed
in the new Traveller basic rule book.  You can get QSDS from by web site:

	http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/qsds/

I\'ve got Microsoft Word 6 and plain ASCII versions available (the ASCII
version is also viewable by most web browsers).

For those of you who have already designed ships using QSDS, there are a
number of changes from earlier versions, and you\'ll need to re-calculate
your designs.  The changes primarily affect crew size (which should now
be back down to Classic Traveller levels), and minor typo fixes.

Also with respect to crew size, I\'d like to draw everyone\'s attention
to the paragraph on "Small Ships and Combined Jobs".  In addition to
combining fractional crew requirements (into, for example, a
engineer/sensor/communicator crewperson), there are special exceptions for
small ships.

In particular all ships 100 tons and smaller can be operated in routine
circumstances by 1 crewmember (no matter what the crew calculation says),
and all shps 200 tons and smaller may be operated in routine circumstances
by 2 crewmembers (again, no matter what the crew calculation says).

Also, don\'t forget that when all is done with QSDS, you can take a 25%
discount (multiply the final price by 0.75) because of the standardized
construction.  This should help the economic aspects of small trade
starships considerably (a MCr 36 QSDS ship actually costs MCr 27).

Finally, I note that there\'s been some discussion on what the two "Maneuver"
crew are for.  I\'m sorry it wasn\'t explained well, but here\'s the deal: you
need one, a Pilot, if there\'s a maneuver drive installed.  You need another,
the Navigator, if there\'s a jump drive installed.  Thus, a ship with both a
maneuver drive and a jump drive needs a Pilot and a Navigator (Astrogator).

I\'ll be happy to answer other questions about ship design; and I\'m putting
together a Frequently Asked Questions list that I\'ll also put up on by Web
site at some point.

I\'ve got one of those d20 style world maps created for the Mac (using a CAD
package).  I can generate pict, gif, jpeg, ... from this without too many
problems.  If anybody is interested I can upload it.

I\'ve also got a full world map up on the web (as part of my little adventure).
 The adventure is located at http://spider.jcu.edu.au/trav/twilight.html

Right at the bottom of this is the world map (as a gif) and this is a link to
the postscript version (for downloading).  The direct URLs for these two are
http://spider.jcu.edu.au/trav/world.gif &
http://spider.jcu.edu.au/trav/world.ps

The various file sizes are (rougly):
	adventure	60k
	gif		16k
	postscript	300k

The postscript version takes ages to print on our laser printer, this isn\'t
because it is a bitmap image, it is simply rather complex.

Enjoy....

I agree with you on this...generally, but not completely.  I can
envision situations where there could be a couple of FTL methods
available, even with the difference as great as "sailing ship vs steam
ship."  Why, for example, are there still jump1 ships when technology
makes jump2,3,4 drives available?  Over time more and more ships will
move to the newer, better technology, but *how much* time will it
take?

On the sail vs steam analogy, the first steam ships were built in the
early 1800\'s and sailing ships competed successfully with them for
nearly 100 years.  In some niches sailing ships still compete with
engine powered ships successfully.

Another possiblity, would be a culture alien to the PC\'s might use
different techs for various things, including FTL.  Maybe eventually
the new culture would adapt to the mainstream (or the mainstream would
adapt to the alien culture\'s technology), but it wouldn\'t happen
overnight.  

Shoot!  If you had a really superior technology would you give it away
to everybody else?  How much would you *charge* somebody for it? 
Would you try to prevent the other folks from developing it for
themselves?  They\'d get it...eventually.

I doubt the early 3rd Imperium is giving Thruster\'s or MrFusion to
anybody!  I rather suspect they would go to extremes to prevent those
technologies from leaking to competing powers...

we\'ll be able to finally compete with those Imperium pretender scum.",

...and now you know why the Terran\'s cleaned the 1st Imperium\'s clock!
<g>

Terrans had meson guns, the Vilani didn\'t.  The Terrans had jump2, the
Vilani didn\'t.  It\'s blitzkrieg time again, faster moving and longer
range against slower and shorter. 

Terran fleet concentrates more quickly than the Vilani can and takes
key planet.  (Maybe by threating it with a *big* rock <g>, but let\'s
say pounding the planet with long range meson guns.) Then the Terrans
quickly install DMSs and move out.  Vilani send in a fleet to recover
the planet, and get chopped to peices by the DMSs while the Terran
fleets are elsewhere taking still other key Vilani planets.

The Vilani can win a pitched space battle (which the Terrans won\'t
fight) through simple numbers, but they can\'t get lost planets back. 
And with it costing fleet after fleet in
impossible attempts to recover planets the Vilani soon don\'t even have
the numbers to win pitched battles.  Now their loses escalate!

Terrans can concentrate and scatter their forces more quickly. They
can bloody a Vilani fleet at range and jump.  They have secure bases
for resupply, while the Vilani\'s bases are only secure if a massive
fleet is sitting there..eventually not even then.

Of course, that\'s not *all* of it, but I rather suspect this is a
bigger part of what happened than spreading diseases or cloning
soldiers.  <g>

Huh?  Where did that come from?  I\'ve never seen the name Dean
associated with the stutterwarp, I quote...

"However scaling up the Jerome effect (Dr. Emile Francois Jerome,
2021-2103) from moving a single hydrogen molecule to moving a large
fabricated spacecraft was a long, complex, and extremely expensive
proposition.", *Traveller:2300*, p14.

I\'ve been toying with the idea of cutting down on the jump rate and/or
maximum length of the stutter\'s jump to make it a
sub-light only drive.  

The Dean Drive is something else entirely.  From memory, it was
supposed to work by converting angular momentum directly to linear
momentum.  The prototype built in the 50\'s(??) supposedly moved across
the floor, but Dean wouldn\'t let anyone examine the machinery (not
even the patent office <g>), so we don\'t know *how* it moved across
the floor.  Probably wasn\'t a real hoax, just a stubborn amateur who
got it wrong.  <g>

Here is the Corsair, designed under QSDS 1.1.

Under "Cost" I have given the full price, with the discounted price (for 
using off-the-shelf components) in perenthesis.

Crew Detail: 1 Engineer, 2 Electronics, Pilot, Astrogator, 3 Gunners,
	     1 Command, 1 Ship\'s Troop.

	The Corsair, an armed raiding ship, is mostly used by pirates.  
Notable features of the corsair are large cargo doors and variable 
identification features.  The large clamshell doors can open to 
reveal the entire cargo bay.  The ship has several centrally controlled 
identification features which can be used to disguise the ship: radio 
emissions alter frequency and content, and the ship\'s transponders can be 
altered to identify the vessel as having any of a variety of missions and 
identities.
	Based on a 400-ton, wedge-shaped, unstreamlined hull, the ship has 10 
Large Staterooms for use as crew quarters, while the 20 low berths are 
available for emergency use, or to hold captives.  The Avionics 
installed are to military specifications, while the communications gear 
is Improved TL-11.  Nine workstations have been provided, but there is no 
central bridge.
	 The Corsair is not normally available on the open market, as the ship 
is a non-commercial type.

Crew Detail (Minimum) : Engineer/Electronics, Pilot/Astrogator.

(Note: The Medic/Steward may be foregone if no passengers are carried.  
The Gunners are optional if the weapons will not be used.)

The Far Trader is based on a 200-ton, box, streamlined hull and has a 10 
ton/hr fuel purification plant.  A variant without the fuel purification 
plant is available with greater cargo capacity (60.8) for a slightly 
lesser price (MCr 63.39 after the standard discount).  In either format, the 
Far Trader contains standard civilian TL-11 avionics and improved TL-11 
communications systems.  There are 8 Large Staterooms available, one of 
which is typically used by the senior individual.  The rest of the crew 
makes use of the four bunks available.

requirements of the original designs, but in general I have tried to limit 
things to the original designs.  Due to power plant tech level requirements, 
all ships are TL12 designs.

OK - Here are the unarmed civilian ships.  I will be posting the Patrol 
Cruiser, Mercenary Cruiser, Lab Ship, Yacht and Safari Ship as soon as I get 
them retyped in (another hour).
