for me.

        Second, another comment: I was inspired by Thomas Biskup\'s post a
digest or two back about a quick-getaway vehicle for nobles to use when
leaving planet one step ahead of a mob of revolting peasants.  I thought...
"wow; there\'d be a small niche market for that".  Then I thought... "and
tack some weapons and armour on it and put some cargo capacity in, and
there\'d be a *monster* niche market for it!".  So, exams being over, I
whipped up something up.  It\'ll be interesting to compare it to what Thomas
comes up with...



        Third, a press release from Famille Spofulam Yards\' corporate counse=
l:

"Sylea, Day 30 Year 00

        It is with deep regret that we read of the recent highly-publicised
comments by Rozeikollis Aagaporniz, head of Ling Standard Shipbuilders,
over the release of our new Moonshine-class Rapid Insertion/Extraction
Starship.  To wit, Mr. Aagaporniz said in an interview in the Sylean
Shipping News, a respected and widely circulated trade publication:

       "Clearly, the Moonshine\'s true target market is drug runners, gun

        runners,smugglers of every stripe, and criminal scum in general!
        Who does Spofulam think they\'re fooling when they say that they\'re
        aiming that ship at a tiny market of sleazy nobles of the worst
        stripe who want to get off-planet one step ahead of a well-deserved
        lynch mob?"

        We here at Spofulam deeply resent this slanderous attempt at
defamation by a competitor clearly motivated by professional jealousy and a
desire to compete unfairly.  We have therefore launched a suit wherein we
will be requesting unspecified but considerable punitive damages, a gag
order and full public apology.  Furthermore, we have notified the Sylean
Constabulary, who are now investigating Mr. Aagaporniz with a view to
filing charges of l=E8se-nobilit=E9.

        For the record, FSY would never sell a Moonshine-class vessel to
anyone whose reputation was not above question.  As a shipbuilder whose aim
is to produce high-performance, high-quality vessels for a most demanding
and discriminating clientele, as opposed to a mass-market builder like Ling
Standard, our track record should make that obvious."

"For when you have to get in or out *really* quickly": The newly-released
=46SY Mooshine-class Rapid Insertion/Extraction Starship is designed for
customers who need a craft capable of the quickest and stealthiest possible
arrivals and departures.  Customers who have pre-ordered Moonshines include
several prominent nobles from worlds sadly troubled by political
instability, and the Imperial [classified] [classified] [classified] and
[classified] [classified].

        Built around a 200Td Airframe Needle superdense hull, the Moonshine
sports a top-of-the-line military electronics package with jamming
capabilities, and a complete Electro-Magnetic Masking package.  It is also
heavily armoured, and carries a Famille Spofulam Defense Systems Mk-XIII
sancaster and a 95 Mj FSDS laser in small turrets.  It carries a Zhunastu
(long live the Emperor!) Fusion Systems 750Mw power plant.  It\'s jump drive
has a two-parsec range.

        However, it is in its maneuver drives that the Moonshine stands
out: it sports both a 6G thruster plate drive *and* a 3G auxiliary HEPlaR
drive (with 2 hours of nominal fuel capacity which may be extended from
siphoning from the power plant\'s excess capacity), which when running
together can accelerate the Moonshine at a truly spectacular 9Gs, exceeding
even the *public* acceleration capability of Imperial Light Fighters.
Nothing can get you from a planetary surface to jump point faster than a
Moonshine!

        To enable the crew and passengers to withstand these truly extreme
accelerations, the most advanced inertial compensators available have been
installed, and are supplemented by Famille Spofulam Subsystems G-tanks;
thus, even at full thrust, the crew will only feel a subjective 4 Gs.  Some
sacrifices have to be made for mission capability.  Accomodations include 6
small staterooms, 6 bunks, and a 55 cubic meter lounge/dining area.  Cargo
capacity is 45 tons.

        While the Moonshine class RI/ESS is not going to be the most
commonly encountered vessel on the space lanes, we here at FSY feel proud
of the impact that it will make in its market, and would like to reiterate
that while the Moonshine\'s special capabilities might lend themselves to
wrongdoing, we are committed to ensuring that Monnshine-class vessels will
be sold to only the most aboveboard of customers.

"Sylea, Day 15 Year 00:

        We here at Famille Spofulam Armaments are pleased to introduce our
KMA-1 Autoshotgun.  Affectionately nicknamed the Meatgrinder by our design
bureau, the KMA-1 is a simple, short-range, brutally efficient weapon
designed for anti-piracy defensive use by starship crews, or riot control
by police forces.

        Measuring a short 89 cm overall with the telescoping,
shock-absorbing stock extended and a compact 70 cm with it folded, the
KMA-1 boasts a cyclic rate of 300  Imperial Standard 18mm ETC shotgun
shells per minute, fed from a 22 cm-diameter drum with a 26-round capacity.
It may also be fired in semi-automatic mode.  Its fully loaded weight is
9.25 kilograms.  The forestock may be supplemented by a removable side or
bottom-mounted "broomstick" foregrip, to help manage the considerable
recoil.

        With its 32-cm barrel (a longer-barreled variant is in the final
stages of testing), the KMA-1 is clearly not effective at long ranges; its
optimal range is 15 m; beyond that, the relatively low muzzle energies and
rapid spread of shot due to its short barrel decrease its effectiveness.
However, given its vocation, this will not often be a consideration.

        Manufacturer\'s suggested retail price is 1650 Cr.  Spare drums are
150 Cr."

    'body' => '        Various people have objected to some of my ideas on starship
construction on various grounds. I don\'t have CT or TCS, so I must
apologize for any incorrect conclusions about their contents.
        Likewise, I don\'t have any large military ship designs except MT
Fighting Ships. What other sources are there? (TNE Battle Rider, for one,
maybe?)
        I will admit at once to a bias in favor of game history as written,
but that has nothing to do with my views on military economics.
The conclusions of Hans et al. on whether the Vargr could have successfully
invaded Corridor or the Aslan the Domain of Deneb, or any particular world
within them could easily be correct. I like their attempt to consider what
is militarily and economically plausible within Traveller. and as Hand
says, any changes in starship economics would indeed affect both sides.
        Apparently TCS gives a figure for ship construction capacity in
Tons per population. While this is a useful first approximation, it is only
that, and apparently at least some of Traveller\'s designers recognized it.
There are several benefits to measuring the shipbuilding capacity of a
world in MCr per thousand people (or whatever) instead of Tons per thousand
people. 
        First, the varying effects of government, budget, population size,
tech level, etc, some of which TCS apparently uses, can still be accounted
for. 
        Second, a natural consequence is that large, heavily armed,
armored, and powered ships are fewer in number (because they are more
expensive) than figures based solely or even chiefly on tonnage would
indicate. That agrees with my "arm waving" based on intuition and analogy
with the pre-stellar Terran military, and it\'s my chief difference with
Hans and company. I hope I\'m not alone in feeling the way I do about it.
        Third, it allows actual ship prices to be used in estimating a
world\'s naval capacity. It matters not whether those prices are derived
from CT, MT, TNE, or T4; from published sources or private design, or
whether the ships are Imperial, Vargr, or United Federation of Planets :-).
There is no need to assume an average cost.
        Fourth, measuring shipbuilding capacity in MCr per capita fits
better with such things as naval budgeting and economic models for those
who would like their SF economies to be as well thought out as their
starship designs. 
        Fifth, it\'s no harder to figure capacity in MCr than it is to
figure it in Tons.

This clearly relates to the M:0 Scout having not a bridge, but rather a
cockpit.  Or perhaps it\'s an M:1200 inclusion...starship crews were forced
to jettison their Virus-infested alarm clocks, and...well, you get the
picture.

Now, off to design the CV Foghorn Leghorn.

I got those figures from a quick browse through _Supplement 9, Fighting Ships_.
They are propably not optimized. My own fleets were built at TL 12 and are
buried somewhere at home in any case. So I fell back on the official 
Traveller background material.

- -5 F? that\'s moderate temperature round here... try -20 F (Yes, 20 below)
BEFORE wind chill.

OB Traveller: just some references based upon personal experience on how to
judge relative temps (Sorry bout the F references, that\'s the only scale
I\'m not metric-comfortable in (yes, pun intended)).
+35 F	Snow will "stick" -- stays visible on ground
+32 F	water will freeze
+15 F	Snow starts to Crunch when you walk on it
+ 0 F	Snow starts to squeak when walked upon
- -10 F	Facial hair collects frost after short duration (15 minutes+)
	exposed Skin feels "tight"
- -20 F   facial hair collects icicles after duration (30 minutes+)
	Seldom need to worry about frost on vehicle windows at this temp or
	lower
- -30 F	Snow ceases to squeak, goes back to crunching; still air stings
nose and
	eyes almost instantly
- -40 F	problems with eyes freezing open or shut (I\'ve had it happen at -35F)

The "501 Scale", or "how long until testicles go numb in briefs and bluejeans"
paraphrased from an old "tourist brochure" from Fairbanks Alaska.  Adjusted
to personal experience. Assumes my End=6, as does subjects.
32 F	2+ hours if active
15 F	1 Hour if active, 20 minutes if not
0	30 minutes if active, 15 if not
- -5	20 minutes if active, 12 if not
- -10	10 minutes.
- -15	about 5 minutes
- -20	about a minute
0 F	about 45 minute

One other cruel thought/reminder to gm\'s: the biggest health risk from
"extreme" cold (-10 C or colder, according to EMT training in Alaska) is
DEHYDRATION!!!

It means that you lose moisture with every blink, breath, and word...

and your spectacles catch enough to get hard to see through at those temps,
too!

When I asked Dave Nilsen about it six months or so ago, IIRC he said that he 
thought he remembered that the author was suffering from writer\'s block and 
the publisher wasn\'t sure they were interested anyway.  I called the publisher 
and asked them about, and they said they hadn\'t decided.  I VERY politely 
asked them to print it.

One of these days I will give them another call....

This is probably _more_ expensive, for two reasons:

First, paper heavy enough to withstand a three ring binder is _more_ expensive 
than the lighter paper used in a book.  [Alternatively you can reinforce the 
pages around the holes, but that costs money, too.];

Second, now you are talking about two different print runs on different types 
of paper, etc., which requires planning resources (finding prices, the right 
processes, etc.).

When I asked somebody in the gaming industry about it, they said that the 
three-ring punched isn\'t any cheaper, even without the cost of the binder.

I sorta like the binder idea, but not because it is cheaper.

So, basically, a world can commit 250 to 750 credits per head, per year

The number of fleets is specified in a couple of resource which I do 
have, and I believe that the # of regular and reserve fleets is 
accurate.  However, I\'m not so sure about the number of ships stated.  Of 
course, this number isn\'t at all informative if you don\'t know what types 
they are.  How many are actually line combatants, as opposed to support 
ships, for instance?

But that doesn\'t bug me as much as the budget figure named.  Unless the 
citizens of the Imperium, as a majority, live in more opulent splendor 
than I\'d ever imagined, I don\'t see where they can afford such incredible 
taxes.

Consider the average Cr30,000 per year earning Imperial citizen.  
Admittedly, I\'m pulling that figure straight from my keister (only one or 
two crewmembers on the ship the players run in my current campaign make 
anything near this figure, and they work on the bridge).  If we make some 
scientific wild-ass guesses about how much taxes he/she/it pays (based on 
what\'s \'average\' for a late twentieth-century Earthling in an 
industrialized nation), we figure Uncle Cleon gets around Cr5000 to 
Cr7500 a year.  Now, we can only guess as to which percentage of this 
goes to the planetary military.  In the Yoo Ess, the military gets less 
than 10 percent of total outlays, so applying such a figure to the above 
gets us Cr500 to Cr750 paid to Uncle Cleon\'s military each year.  Now, 
despite what the Department of the Navy might want to tell you, the Navy 
isn\'t the entire military, and doesn\'t get the entire defense budget, but 
the figures cited above (way, way above) are perilously near the 
S.W.A.G.ged figures I just came up with.

So, I guess a planet can throw that much at their navy if they don\'t need 
ground forces, close-orbit defense forces or surface naval forces.

Perhaps if I owned a copy of TCS, I might find arguments based on its 
contents more compelling.

Bravo!

Thad has some very good points here.  There are many factors that
effect the size of a military.  I would like to also add a worlds
dependence upon trade.  Just look at the British Empire of a few 
centuries ago.

The text under "Select Defensive Weapons" mentions repulsors/tractors.
However, no information on these devices is provided.  (This *does*
give us a chance to bring back _High Guard_ style repulsor bays, if
we want, or to stick with FF&S and not have them.)

Black Globes are also mentioned; I don\'t recall if it equates them 
with the other standard term, "force fields".  However, I didn\'t see
any text explaining how to determine their protective value, or about
capacitor design.  This is probably a carry-over from the similarly
very poor section in FF&S.

There seems to be a problem with battery USD calculation.  Example is
the tech-12 laser.  QSDS uses a package of an MFD and several three 
ton "light laser turrets".  For an overpowered one battery turret, 
USD is 2-0-0-0; ten are 7-5-3-2.  SSDS gets 2-0-0-0 converting the
same turret, with the +1 for overpowering.  But SSDS says "once the 
weapon is converted to USD rules, multiply by number of weapons in 
the battery"; ten then are 20-0-0-0.  I think "once" in the above
sentence should read "before"; then ten are 7-5-3-2.  This is a
major bug.

This is, of course, one of the classic High Guard design arguments (and one of the
major factors in favour of battleriders.) If you go too far with meson-gun-only
ships, particularly if you underarmour your ships, you do make yourself 
vulnerable to having your meson guns scrubbed off by missile-armed 
destroyers, of course.

It\'s no longer true in FFS, and hence not in T4 - FFS allows multiple parallel
spinal mounts, and the new scaling laws for armour allow big ships to carry a 
*lot* more armour than small ships, and under some circumstances allow big
ships to carry PA guns big enough to cripple cruisers, and PA guns have *much*
longer effective range than meson guns (though these advantages do go away
at higher TLs.)

I would say that Open Frame is supposed to be the same as the old 
dispersed structure, or any structure in which large amounts of the volume
of a ship-enclosing rectangular prism is empty (if that makes sense). FOr
example, in TNE the classic ring-shaped lab ship was rated as open structure.

I think Striker details the use of nuclear dampers for cleaning up radiation.  (I really 
do need a second set of books for the office, so I can cite chapter and verse.)  As I 
recall, you need two radiation dampers at lower tech levels (like 12-14), which direct 
polarized damping rays at the irradiated location.  The damping rays neutralize the 
radiation, making it safe in a short time.  At TL15, you only need one damper.  I don\'t 
know the physics involved, but I\'m sure that the many physicists on the list can help 
you there.

>What would treatment of radiation poisoning would the imperium use? 

In one of the Travellers\' Digests or Megatraveller Digests is an article on treatment of 
radiation poisoning.  It seems to me that the treatment involved using a virus that 
neutralized the radiation and reversed radiation damage, but I don\'t recall exactly.

That is TL7-8?  They don\'t apply.

I think you\'ve hit an important nerve here:  What science-fiction paradigm is going to 
sell best to the RPG crowd?  IG seems to be pursuing a hedging strategy on this point, 
but that may ultimately not be the best way to go.  Maybe IG should accept that it 
will either lose the customers who want the total hard science approach of TNE/Twilight: 
2000/2300 AD, or those who want more space opera and human conflict (as opposed to 
conflict of sophonts against the elements).  If it doesn\'t, it could lose all of them by 
not providing enough real science to the former, and too much burdensome technical 
detail to the latter.  I don\'t have an answer.  Personally, I like the flexibility of 
being able to determine how things "really" work if needed, but not having to if it\'s 
not important to the story.  I thought MT had the balance about right for my purposes.

>contemplating their realistic social effects.

This is really the realm of science fiction authors, which includes Marc Miller, GDW, 
IG, and -- us, the referees.  The telephone radically altered society.  So did the 
automobile.  Each had multiple levels of effects:  users\' lives were changed by access 
to mobility and communication, but the economic structure of society was changed as well

        <blush> :).  Thanks.  I don\'t what the next ship I\'ll do will be
(probably when I get another idea for a flaky niche-market ship), but for
those who are interested I do have deckplans for the Moufette-Rapide (and
Ross Coburn is currently Photoshopping up a Gif of it).  I also have
partially completed deckplans for the Caligula, but it is *damn big*; I put
everything on one deck and it\'d take a lot of pages taped together if
someone printed it out...

        I\'m going to throw together some plans for the Moonshine next.  If
anyone is interested, I can send them off when done.

This is not true.  Usually, the title must be earned, but I ready

But the nobility *is* the Imperium. I\'d think the rules covering this

I think that\'s a common problem with email - people tend to be a lot more... 
passionate...online. When they disagree, they say so. If they met you face- 
to-face, they\'d probably stay quiet.

I don\'t think it *is* negative. Most of the criticism is constructive (and, 
IMHO, mostly justified) - Foss is a great artist, but we\'d  prefer pictures 
that looked more like Traveller; we like having deckplans for every ship, but 
they\'re badly drawn; try harder to meet the stated publication dates; improve 
the proof-reading. These are the main criticisms, and they don\'t seem 
unreasonable to me. If we don\'t tell IG when they make a mistake, how are they 
going to know?

The whole point is we *do* care! Very much, in some cases. Do you honestly 
think we\'d spend all this time, effort and money if we didn\'t?

Depends. AISI, there are two ways to do this: you can have everything in a 
single book (or two), expanding the careers and giving a couple of pages of 
background to each, (a bit like Supp4), or you can devote an entire book to 
each career, including lots of info (more like Book4-7). The second would be 
best, but it involves much more work.

rules (page 115) since I wanted to get some idea of how fast this little
ship really would be.  The section on interstellar travel mentions that
the transit time for a ship with 1G acceleration from a size 8 world to
100 diameters is about 5 hours.  This value obviously was not calculated
with the travel formulae on that page (size 8 world: 12800km, jump

Acceleration is wrong - you\'ve just used the g rating. 1g =~ 10m/s^2, so

T = 2 * sqrt(1,280,000,000/[8*10]) = 8000s = 2h13m20s

Read "Cardinal of the Kremlin," by Tom Clancy.  Spooky, spooky, interrogation
scene.  For those of you who haven\'t read it, it involves a combination of
drugs and sensory depravation until the interrogated party begins to, ahem,
come unhinged.  By the time the interrogated party is removed from the tank,
they\'ll tell you anything, and are probably fairly ready for "reprogramming"
to boot.  On a not-so-tech note, what about psionics.  Two Psionic Institutes
(copyright A. Friend c. 1955 :-)) still have charters in 1100, and may
provide "services" to the Imperium, when needed.

Very common throughout musical literature for melodies to be borrowed from
older works.  Holst\'s music is both memorable (just ask John Williams, who
"borrows" freely from the Planets throughout the Star Wars score) and
singable.  A good choice, overall. (Unfortunately, I am remembering "Jupiter"
a tad unclearly, and I no longer possess a copy of "The Planets" to which I
can refer.  Oh well, that\'s never stopped me in the past).

So far, so good.  Each cadence (wan, on, far, star) has a good vowel sound on
which to sustain.  You should try to avoid ending lines on hard consonants,
or, even worse, schwa sounds.  A pox upon all lyricists who do not sing.

Minor troubles here.  Horn, Vland/hand require very flat vowel sounds, which
are generally OK, though not preferred.  The \'shun of civilization uses the
abominable schwa, and places an unstressed syllable on the cadence.  A couple
of minor changes make it more singable.  You might try this instead,

Fro-om Windhorn on to Delphi,
To Terra and to Vland,
We will carry hope through the Night,
To every far off land.

This ends on more open vowel sounds, and is somewhat more singable.  I like
the reference to the Long Night, myself.  It also does away with unto
(another of those friggin\' schwas) but maintains the feel of your lyrics.

Race and face are fine; mother and other are unaccented syllables on cadences
and end on schwas again, and we all know how Timmy feels about them.  However
the lyrical motive is stirring, and rather effectively constructed.  Since
they are on weak cadences, and aren\'t high notes, which I believe is the
case, they can probably be left alone.  

Actually, not a bad first attempt.  There are many famous (i.e., dead)
"great" composers whose sense of prosody (the art and craft of marrying
lyrics to music) isn\'t as strong. (See "banner" in The Star-Spangled Banner,
where the second highest, and most heavily accented note of the song, is on a
goddamned schwa!)  BTW, there isn\'t a book written on this subject of which I
know, and these comments are purely my opinion, degrees and experience
notwithstanding.  Besides, nobody listens to the singers opinions, anyway.

Hope this helps.  I offer my input purely as a sounding board (hideous pun
intended).  You may use, or ignore, it as you see fit.

The first batch of the updated 3G^3 went out to distrtibutors on Friday,
so it should be in some stores around the end of the week. Printer delays
(argh) kept it from being out sooner. I think it looks good, hope you do
as well. It includes full updated information to create weapons for (tm
or(r) as appropriate): TimeLords, CORPS, GURPS, Hero System,
MasterBook/Torg, Cyberpunk 2020, Feng Shui/Nexus, Heavy Gear, Traveller
4th edition, Traveller:New Era and Battlelords of the 23rd Century. On a
related note, the limited hardcover print run was a few days behind the
softcover on the binding schedule. We\'ll do everything possible to get the
goodies in your hands by the 24th, and they should be shipping later this
week. Get one for yourself. Get one for your friends. Hell, get some for
about a hundred complete strangers...;) 

Thanks for your patience,

That would be "deprivation."  Sensory "depravation" is something that I don\'t

Oh great... it\'s nice to have a medium over which we can communicate our
thoughts.  If the game is horribly bad, don\'t mention it or lie about it.
This reminds me of the way public relations for IG in this past year (we
shipped the hardcovers... yes, this time we shipped them... honestly,
*now* they were shipped).

I\'m sorry to disappoint you but if someone demands a lot of money for a
game I\'d like to have, I pay the money and I don\'t like the product I\'ll
voice my opinion so that *everyone* can hear it.  I really feel obliged to
warn newcomers if there are lousy products out there.  Maybe this will
make the people in charge think twice before releasing such a lousy 
product.  Simply keeping silence over problems doesn\'t help anyone (except
those who earn bucks on this) and I don\'t think, that would be the correct
way to handle it.

If you can\'t stand criticism (and yes, it can become somewhat unfriendly
at times... that\'s sad but we all are just humans with our little
mistakes).  Personally I always try to remain polite (honestly :-) but at
times I get really angry about some things and then my natural sarcasm can
become somewhat... obvious... :-}  Afterwards I always feel sorry for that
BTW.

Still I believe that -- as long as we don\'t start insulting each other --
anyone should be able to voice his or her opinion.

The Niven\'s First Law system defense boat mounts a 50 ton missile
bay and a pair of heavy laser turrets.  The fusion rocket can also
be used as a very short range weapon to make those Imperial fighters
think twice about a strafing run.  I have used the thrust divided
by 100, converted by the USP table to give its damage.  In combat
it would be used with a fire control rating of zero.

An extremely high degree of automation minimizes the crew required.
There is a single engineer, three electronics technicians,
five gunners, a pilot and a commander.  Five staterooms are shared
by all but the commander who has one to herself.  Eleven G-tanks
are also available for high acceleration maneuvers.

The SDB will lurk for months at a time in gas giants, asteroid
belts, or at the bottom of oceans.  Its 75 Mw fusion plant supplies
power for life support, passive sensors and a 2-g contragrav drive.
This is used for stationkeeping or boyancy compensation.  In the
event of drive failiure underwater the SDB\'s natural boyancy will
take it back to the surface for rescue -- it only weighs 4500 tons!

When the SDB is ready to strike it powers up its fusion rocket.
This provides 18000 tons thrust and 360 Mw for the ship\'s systems.
Active sensors, screens and lasers all require this power in order
to be used.  The rocket gives 4-g acceleration, or 6-g if the
contragrav drive is enabled as well.  Endurance at top
acceleration is only 15.5 hours, requiring the drive to be shut
off in the middle of most interplanetary transfers.  It is tuned
to run on unrefined fuel, and no purification plant is provided.

History:
MacBaen was born on Aurora in 1144, to a working class parents who worked
in one of the new automated factories.  After going to college, he joined 
a law firm and was on the fast track towards a full partnership.  After a 
few years of working in the office, he realized that something was missing;
his life had become dull and lacked passion.  MacBaen decided to enter politics 
to solve the problems that he saw around him.  His first campaign, was for
mayor of Briston, the largest city on Aurora.  He lost, and lost badly,
barely getting 10% of the vote.  He thought about quiting, but realized
that even though he lost, the campaign had  been the most fun he ever had. 
    In 1176 He ran for a seat in the World Assembly, this time he fared much
better, and won a close race over the incumbant. He helped start the funding
for the Auroran space program.  He has always had a passion for space, and
has often said he wishes he was a bit younger, and he could be one of those
rocket jocks.  Most Aurorans were fascinated by the space program and
they fell in love with this young brash senator.  
	In 1194 Hivers contacted Aurora. MacBaen resigned his post to act as
an ambassador. He took a six month cruise with the Hivers, helping them 
deal with the humans they encountered on Zloff, Hite and Fija.  He was
instrumental in helping craft the Dawn League Accords, which were the
documents which created the Dawn League.  After that he returned to 
the newly named Aurora, to help his people deal with their new neighbors.
He helped organize support for the Twelve, and was disappointed that
Aurora was unable to launch a ship of its own.  After the Twelve were
declared lost, he was heartbroken, he thought that the League was 
about to collapse. Others didn\'t give up hope and were able to push
the League into a new shape, the Reformation Coalition.  
	While MacBaen didn\'t have a hand in creating the RC, he realized that
it could succedd where the League had failed.  He ran for the single seat
that Aurora would have in the new Assembly of Worlds, and won easily.
He is a firm member of the Federalist bloc, like most Aurorans he believes
in personal freedoms, and that democracy is the most noble form of 
government.  He also realizes that only through compromise can a group of
worlds as diverse as the Coalition, hope to survive.  He often gathers
together moderates in both blocs to move legislation ahead.  He was a key
mover behind the recent compromise on the Ship Bill.
	He has also suffered a private tragedy. His son was a newly commisioned
Lieutenant on the Ashtabula.  He is deeply worried over its fate, and fears
the worst. If he hears any clues to its fate, he will move heaven and earth
to get his son back.  His son is the only relative he cares about. Both of
his parents died several years ago, and he has never married. His son was
born from one of the numerous affairs he has had throughout the years. 
Auroran citizens don\'t really care about his personal life, as long as
he does a good job as their represenative.  The Auroran press respects
the right to privacy of individuals, and doesn\'t intrude if at all possible.
	To help rebuild the civilization he has gathered together several
Auroran investors and they aquired a ship that was found by a group of 
Lancers working for the Auroran Navy. The Argo was floating 
around a gas giant in the Arvid system. It appeared perfectly intact and 
there was no clue to the fate of its former crew.  MacBaen has gathered 
together a crew, from all over the RC. The ship will perform missions in 
the Wilds and also private missions for MacBaen.  
	His hobby is rock climbing, and he often goes into the wilderness to
relax.  He used to do this by himself, but now that he is a member of the
Assembly, he is forced to take along an assistant.  He is also getting on
in age, and his staff is worried he might hurt himself.  He always access
to holophones, and his computers are tied into the global wireless network.

That adventure also contains an appendix with encounter tables and High

the most comprehensive treatment I know of of Zhodani military might,
which isn\'t saying much.

It just hit me - do we know what the status of Psionics is in M0? This is 
well before the Psionics suppressions, and before any real conflict with 
the Zhodani.

So what is the opinion of the new 3rd Imperium on Psionics? If it is 
positive, how does one prevent the game from revolving around psionics, as 
I\'m sure everyone and their dog would be running towards the nearest 
Psionics Institute.

I\'m always interested in stuff like that.  It\'s great for campaign

Extremely true. The most fun I have ever had as a referee was to simply
layout a set of conditions and let the players make the problem worse by
their own misinterpretations.

I believe it\'s been stated several times, both in background material and
the rules themselves that interstellar psionics is impossible.

"Sylean Shipping News, Day 237 Year 2:

        Today, FSY released its Cresecent-class customs vessel.
Essentially a Moonshine-class RI/ESS modified for smuggler interception
duty, the Crescent carries a 1251 Mj Particle Accellerator gun in a spinal
mount and a military-grade 251 Mj heavy laser, plus accomodations for a
squad of boarding troops.  However, this increased offensive punch was
reached at the cost of reducing its jump capability to 1 parsec, and
minimizing its cargo space to almost nil.  As one industry observer who
insisted on remaining anonymous stated "Those boneheads at Spofulam didn\'t
leave enough in space for basic supplies!  On long patrols they\'re going to
have to eat their way into the cabins!".  Crew accomodations are indeed
reported to be spartan.

        Other, more cynical commentators noted that Spofulam essentially
created a market for the Crescent with their Moonshine-class sales policy,
described as "...selling the damn things to anyone with a title and a
suitcase full of credits and sometimes they don\'t insist on the title".
Indeed, resale numbers for the Moonshine class are unusual; FSY refused to
comment on the rumour that Baron Erghaan of Mu has bought and resold no
less than 15 Moonshines in the past year, stating only that "...freedom of
trade and property rights are one of the cornerstones of the Imperium and
=46amille Spofulam Yards respects both to the utmost, not to mention our
clients\' confidentiality and privacy".  They did, however, most
emphatically deny that the Imperial Investigations Bureau has recently
subpeonaed all their client files..."


Some notes: The Crescent carries an increased crew; 1 captain, an extra
gunner for the NPAW, an extra engineer, and a 12-person boarding party.
The captain has a large stateroom; flight deck and senior crew sleep in
small staterooms, and everyone else bunks it.  There\'s a small crew
lounge/dining area.  I might do deckplans at some point...

Optic bafflers

Would offer stealth capability vs. passive sensors only, plus degrade
the performance of lasers in the same way as sandcasters.
Presuppose some kind of magic field that would stop or seriously degrade
any and all laser fire, irregardless of frequency, tuning, or any of
that other arcane BS. Assume that the effect works both ways. What
effect would that have on your sensors? your missile guidance systems?
things like that? Would it make you invisible (a la the Romulan=20
Cloaking Device)?


Induced remote fission gun

A super-high-tech nightmare weapon (perfect for alien invaders &
dangerous relics! A great gift for Dad!). Basically a big weapon that
produces a nuclear mushroom cloud at the target, rather than merely
spitting superheated hydrogen molecules at it from a distance. (Would
not
go through solid matter like a meson gun, though... at least, I don\'t=20
think....) Would it grab a bit of the target & create a critical
mass out of it, or teleport a dinky amount of fissionable material to
the target and squeeze it there?


Tachyon gun

Another supratech gizmo. Hits the target virtually as soon as it goes
off; therefore -- if coupled with a tachyon sensor array -- highly
accurate. Pull the trigger and watch it blow up in real time. Fun for=20
the whole family. Big bonuses to hit. Acts like a meson gun, since
tachyons
(presumably) show no more respect for space than they do for time.
Perhaps depending on how you tune or equip it, a T-band emitter/receiver
can be commlink, sensor array (sampling the target before it fires), and
weapon all in one.=20

In a campaign with tachyon technology, the equipment you need to
fine-tune an emitter and turn it into a doomsday weapon would be verrrry
closely monitored, rather like fissionable materials today. Steal it!=20
Recover it! Fight over the componenents for it! Adventure
fodder galore!


Cruise missiles

A long-time pet project of mine. Not big conventional missiles, but
actual pilotless kamikaze planes with really big warheads, like a
high-tech spacegoing version of the Tomahawk. Not very fast for a
missile (has to putt along at a maximum of 6G like everybody else), and
can be engaged and shot down at any range like any other craft =96 not
just point-blank =96 but conversely, it could also dodge fire & take
damage & still function like an ordinary craft. And -- most heinous! --
if it misses once, it\'ll keep coming back and trying to hit you again=20
until it runs out of gas or you shoot it down.

And you can launch it from really mindboggling distances, too =96 from
unmodified launch bays! no upgrade costs!  -- then leave the
neighborhood
long before they arrive at the target (first there was "shoot-n\'-scoot";
now there\'s "launch-n\'-leave"). You could also seed them in an enemy
system, perhaps in conjunction with robotic sensor buoys, and use them
as space mines.

Once the rules for vehicles & robotics come out, the design ought to be
fairly straightforward; what I need are rules for use. How do I
determine the damage such a weapon will do? Seeing that it\'s designed
for a one-way trip, it ought to have no trouble expending the full force
of its exposive power on the target, but it\'s going slower than an
ordinary missile might=85 And how do I determine the chances to hit, once
the thing closes with its target? Do I factor in the relative thrust in
G\'s of the target vs. the missile, or just go by pilot skill? (If we
find that out, we can also set ground rules for all kamikaze pilots
everywhere =96 including the desperate PC who locks his ship on a
collision course with the alien dreadnaught and ejects just in time=85)


Sonar munitions

Here\'s the question I\'ve been grappling with: What do you do if you\'re
an average- to low-stellar civilization, your densitometer technology
(how far underground can those things see, anyway? Anybody know?) still
sucks or is nonexistant, and you want to invade a world equipped with a
subterranean meson cannon? Answer: you drop a bunch of armor-piercing
bombs all over the place -- each equipped not with an explosive warhead,
but a sonar emitter/receiver -- triangulate his position in three
dimensions, and blow him to smithereens with another meson gun or an
NPAW big enough to carve through the planetary crust.

(It\'s how they find Egyptian tombs and dinosaur bones; it ought to work=20
equally well in a higher-tech milieu for subterranean meson guns,=20
secret underground headquarters, and the like.)

The main problem would be getting the sensors to survive the impact
(perhaps by means of a very small inertial damper), not penetration. As
we saw during Desert Storm, a 2000-lb. bomb dropped from 10,000 feet can
go two hundred feet underground through pavement, rock, sand, and
reinforced concrete. Something bigger and heavier, composed of
super-science-fictiony megatough materials and falling out of the goddam
atmosphere at several miles a second should have no trouble making it a
mile or two underground. (You\'d need at least two in the general
vicinity of the target for it to work, though. I\'m not Mr. Science, but
even I can figure that one out).=20

I figured I\'d just pull the stats and effective ranges for sonar sensors
out of FF&S=85 but as fate would have it, this is probably one of the ver=
y
few speculative or actual technologies not covered in that mind-bending
Bible of arcane game design. So come on, all you tech-heads! I\'m at a
total loss on this one -- I need your help!=20

Things like mass, volume, etc. can be extrapolated, borrowed, or just
plain stolen from something roughly comparable, like radar =96 but how fa=
r
does sound travel underground? How powerful a set of sensors could you
pack into a disposable munition of several tons? How would a beast like
this function in game terms? How would it work, broadly speaking, at=20
different tech levels and in surroundings of different composition=20
(solid rock versus methane ice or something weird like that)? Would=20
there be an appreciable difference (i.e. one that would radically=20
affect game play)? Inquiring minds want to know!

    'body' => 'Calculating the actual dimensions of a starship is a simple matter of using
the formulae for calculating the volume of a solid of the ship\'s size. 
Once you know the dimensions of your ship, you can figure out how much
"comfortable" interior space you have to work with and go from there.

I\'ll assume a ship size of 100dTons, 1400 cubic meters.  The basic unit in
all these calculations is the cubic meter.  Each deck square will be
assumed to be 1x1x3.5 meters, unless otherwise noted.

1.  Spherical Hulls:  V = 4/3 * pi * r^3.  We already know the volume of
the ship; the radius is equal to half its length.  Thus, since a 100-ton
ship has a 14 meter diameter, if we assume 1x1x3.5m deckplans, we can
squeeze 4 decks of varying size into a ship of this shape.  Shorter decks
(1x1x2m,or somesuch) will produce more decks.

2.  Box Hulls:  V = L * W * H.  The lengths given on the Box Hulls table
are not based on a cubic structure.  Divide the total volume by the length,
then decide how many decks you want and how tall each deck is.  A 100 ton
ship is 17.5 meters long.  1400/17.5 = 80.  Assuming this is the "long"
dimension, We will try to fit three decks into the plans (10.5m).  17.5m x
10.5m x 7.62m =1400kl.  You can ignore the lengths on the hull table and
create a cubic structure by simply taking the cube root of the volume.

3.  Cylinders:  V = B * L.  B = pi * r^2.  A 100 ton ship is 28 meters
long, giving a base area of 50m^2, and a diameter (width) of 7.9788 (round
to 8) meters.  Figure about 2 decks, 3 if you use smaller plans.

4.  Wedge Hulls:  A wedge is basically a pyramid, but it can also be
thought of as a cone.  
	Pyramid:  V = 1/3 * B * h.  B = L * W.
	Cone:  V = 1/3 * pi * r^2 * h.
	Since the "classic" scout/courier fits the "pyramid" scheme, we\'ll use it
as our example.  According to SSDS, the scout has a length of 35 meters,
giving it a base area of 40 square meters.  Make it 10.5 meters tall (3
decks) and divide the base into two triangles of equal area.  
	The area of a triangle is A=1/2Bh.  The base of each triangle is 10.5m, so
the length of each triangle is 3.8 meters.  Thus, the base of the ship is
10.5 meters tall and 7.6 meters wide!  Obviously, we need to change our
plans, unless we want a ship with long, narrow decks.  Make it two decks
tall at the base (7 meters).  This gives our ship dimensions of 35 meters
long, 7 meters tall and 11.43 meters wide, a little more reasonable.  And
since the ship narrows toward the front, we may have to limit the deckplans
in the fore to make everything fit.  But at least it\'s workable.

5.  Needle Hulls:  A needle can be thought of as either a really long
cylinder, pyramid or cone.  The formulae for these are already given above.

6.  Domes and Discs:  A disc is just a squat cylinder, where the hull
length is equal to the diameter of the craft.  A dome is half a sphere (or
oblate sphere).  The formula for figuring the volume of an oblate sphere is
V=4/3*pi*a^2b, where a and b are the semimajor and semiminor axes of the
spheroid, respectively (the semimajor axis is 1/2 the long dimension, in
this case the length of the hull, and the semiminor axis is 1/2 the short
dimension).  For domes, calculate the dimensions of a volume equal to twice
that of your ship, with the semimajor axis being equal to half its length. 
Then halve the result.  Discs can be calculated in much the same way, if
you want a rounded disc (just don\'t double the volume before calculating).

7.  Open Frames:  These ships look like the Nostromo from Aliens or the
Bulk Cruisers from Star Wars.  Building them is pretty simple:  Just build
your components, add some walls, strap on fuel tanks and put armor over the
important points.  You should end up with an odd looking craft that matches
your original volume specs almost perfectly.

8.  Close Structures:  I /think/ this is similar to the "Dispersed
Structure" of High Guard, a layout similar to the "Enterprise" on Star
Trek.  For these, just decide how you want your ship to look, then put the
components where they will fit.  These types won\'t have the "random" sort
of look that Open Frames have, so they should be somewhat orderly and
logical.

Hope this helps.  I apologize for the change in tone throughout the
message; I started this in the morning and didn\'t finish it until
midafternoon, so my train of thought was interrupted.

    'body' => 'The Central Supply Catalog and Aliens Archive showed
up at The Compleat Strategist today.

I\'m still reading, but I\'ll give a quick view of
Aliens:

Twelve minor races detailed. These include the four
from the main rulebook (the Asym, Denaar, Graytch,
Hresh, and Bye-ren), seven additional new minor
races (The Controlled, Hanna Saka, Nunclees, 
the Providers, Tekundu [human minor], and Trakii),
and our old friends, the Newts!

Each race has a section on its origins, physiology,
homeworld, psychology, history, society, character
generation, other game rules, starships and travel, 
quick role-playing tips, and two "casual encounters",
one Imperial, the other native or extra-Imperial.

Cover art is by Foss, and while nice, isn\'t really
related to anything inside. In the text section for
each race there is an illustration of it\'s skeleton, 
but the fully-fleshed illustrations are in a four-page
color section by Ashe Marler and Ray Van Tilburg.

There\'s also six pages of B/W art, the "Wildstorm
Art Gallery". This is a mixed bag, since while some
drawings show some of the aliens at different angles
(aiding us in getting a sense of what they look like), 
some of the "concept" sketches were obvious early stabs
at getting the "look" or proportions and, while possibly
interesting, don\'t really belong here and the space 
should have gone to additional poses of the finished aliens.
(Hell, the "Newt concept" is just a human with a tail!)

Don\'t panic at that last sentence, though, the Bwaps
retain their classic form, with only small adjustments
(for the better, IMHO. Here the Bwaps look "kinda
like newts" rather than EXACTLY like upright 
terrestrial newts).

Two bits of bad news: they say the Newts are from
Old Expanses when from context they mean Empty Quarter;
and "the Controlled\'s" history seems a bit fuzzy as
to which time period the author is in (it would make more
sense if the the viewpoint were in the 1100\'s rather than
year 0), and some of the encounters for some other races
also have this problem (Dingir? in M0?).
Also some minor typos that should have been cleaned up,
but not many.

The good news is: the whole point of the module.
TWELVE GOOD, "CONTACT"-STYLE, _TRAVELLER_-STYLE
ALIENS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your milage will vary as to just how "good" or
useful they are to you, but this beats Santa-cap-
wearing-Monty-Python-quoting Ithklur ...to a pulp!

"All the Myriad Ways" was about the effect of parallel-universe travel on
society.  "All the Bridges Rusting" was about the effect of matter
transport on society, a theme continued in numerous other Niven stories. 
I highly recommend both of these stories, but particularly "All the Myriad
Ways" -- best kicker ending of any Niven story, and he\'s good at them.

Only "temporary" storage tanks will do that. Because if the outside is
much colder than ambient, that means you are losing "cold" (actually
gaining heat) through the insulation. And you want that to be
minimized! 

You will see some fog and frost around refueling hoses, and around tank
vents.

The value of A is not in gees. It\'s in meters per second per second. 1
g is 9.8 m/s^2. 8 g is 78.4 m/s^2.

So at 8 g it takes 2 and a quarter hours to get to the 100 diameter limit.
And you\'ll be moving at 634 km/sec when you reach it!

That formula applies to *anything* moving at a constant acceleration.
It\'s real physics.

Not really. This is how things work in the real world. You often find
that you *can\'t* cram all those nifty goodies into the size package you
want.

    'body' => 'Starports and why Planetary TLs are meaningless

Some of you will remember my comments to the effect that, with interstellar
cargo transport costing a mere 1000 Cr per ton, there is absolutely *no*
relevance in what a planetary TL *supposedly* is - they simply import (as
do LDCs on Terra today). The *only* relevance may be cost (increased - not
hugely over the going rate on the planet of production, but significantly
more in terms of the *local* per capita income in all likelihood), the
difficulty of maintenance (all spares have to be imported - and local techs
may not really understand what to do beyond replace whole subsystems ...
hmm, sounds like *here and now* techs, eh?!).

Anyway, whether you agreed with me then or not (and no one, IMNSHO, gave
any really good reason for not doing so), then perhaps you need to consider
this - which may be considered the final nail in the coffin, so to speak,
of any oppostion -

All Starships need "Routine Maintenance" once per year, right? Two weeks at
any A or B class Starport, correct? The key word here is *any* A or B Class
Starport - *not* "any A or B Class Starport of an equal or higher TL", but
*any* such Starport.

Note that, as the rules stand (TL Table on pg. 134) it is possible to score
a Type A Starport on a minimum TL7 world and a Type B on a minimum of TL5 -
though obviously in those cases *all* the tech must be imported!

However, consider a TL9 world - just barely starfaring - with a Type A
Starport. What happens when your TL12 Sylean Federation Scoutship wants an
overhaul there (or your TL15 Third Imperium Scoutship, for that matter). Is
there any delay? Is there any increased cost associated? *NO* to both!!!

Obviously such Starports import all their technology *and* the costs must
be negligibly more than if it were produced locally - after all, we are
told (pg. 7) that "everything is driven by economics" - otherwise costs
would be greater!

So, this means that any world with a A or B Starport (at the *very* least -
I would argue that any world with an A, B, C, or even (barely) a D class
would qualify) has easy access to the maximum available TL of the Milieu in
question!

Sure, we all know that its really because Marc wanted something simple. But
it\'s there, and its a glaring hole in the rules - as are the costs of
interstellar cargo transport, anyway.

Like I said, this makes my thesis 100% sure, there is *no* reason why local
TL means anything more than what they could (theoretically) produce if they
*had* to - it has nothing to do with what they *actually* have available!

In a nutshell:  When the cutter contacts the jump field, it\'s time to 
roll up new characters.

Nobody\'s actually seen jumpspace and lived to tell the tale, really.  
What a person sees during a journey through j-space is the protective 
\'bubble\' formed around the starship to protect it from the strange 
physics on the other side.  Essentially, a jump drive pinches off a tiny 
pocket universe around the ship and flings it through j-space on a 
trajectory that\'ll result in the ship emerging in normal space parsecs 
away from where it entered.  My source for information on jump space is 
DGP\'s "Starship Operator\'s Manual."

To answer your other question:  Looking at the bubble is like looking at 
a grey, pulsing nothing.  You\'ll probably suffer hypnagogic 
hallucinations if you stare at it too long, kind of like staring at a TV 
tuned to a dead channel after you\'ve been awake for 48 hours.

Nope. We\'re going to do everything. The first 136 book set of CORE
supplements will cover everything in Traveller down to the specifications of
the screws used in the Kinunir class ships (as well as taking up 7 feet of
shelf space). That\'s for 1997. In 1998 we intend to have raised enough cash
to run for President. In 1999 we shall establish the first moon base and
start testing our prototype jump drives. Around November 15th year 2000 we
expect to make contact with the Vilani exploration vessels at Proxima.

At CORE we like to set ourselves challenging but achievable goals.

Sorry, my Hiver friend just reminded me - by 2010 we intend to be the
dominant race in this arm of the galaxy.

	When you have charecters make Survival skill Rolls for cold 
temperature survival remember that the true test of survival is knowing 
what to wear in the first place.  An average test of Survival & INT 
might be required (in T4 terms) to wear the right clothing to begin 
with.  If this fails you can require tests of the lowest of Perception, 
Medical, or Survival to notice that there is a problem before they 
freeze to death.... This may seem cruel but is actually pretty realistic 
- - lots of people who should know better are found dead from exposure 
later.  As an added option for referees who want to torture  (er I mean 
challenge :) ) the players you can rule that fashion requires certain 
garments (especially for nobles) and that these garments are_not_suited 
to the weather.  I am reminded of the true story of a high school girl 
in Fairbanks AK who wore plastic mesh jam shoes to school when it was - 
46 F (-43 C) and lost 2 toes to frostbite while waiting 10 minutes for 
the school bus...

	Remember that the ability of cold to harm the individual is 
based on the conduction of heat away from the body.  As the atmosphere 
gets thinner it cannot suck as much heat out of you & you will not 
suffer as much, conversely a thicker atmosphere will suck heat out of 
you faster.  Not being a meteorologist/doctor/chemist I will not presume 
to guess say how great an influence this will be.  As a very rough fix 
we could assume that perceived temperature will vary with the cube root 
of atmospheric pressure.
	Thus if the actual temperature is -50 C (70 degrees below a 
human optimum of 20 C) and the atmospheric pressure was 0.5 atmosphere 
(thin) it might be perceived as being -36 C ( 70* cube root of 0.5 
(aproximately 0.79))= 55.6  (20-55.6) = -36.  The same fix can be used 
for wind chill calculations.
	Does anyone with real world data care to comment on this.  
Remember that human beings are warm blooded so we can not just use 
phyics formulas for heat conduction, etc.  Alternatively we can just 
make it up as seems appropriate.

Obviously we won\'t see it over here for a short while, but having proof-read
the Aliens book a month or more back, I think I can honestly say that it was
quite good. It\'s difficult to know if it has changed since I saw it, or what
they\'ll do for pictures, etc. but it Tim Brown has managed to generate some
interesting aliens.

As for CSC, I would like to think that Greg Porter has a sufficient
reputation that he wouldn\'t contribute a dud book - certainly the small
excerpts I\'ve seen of this looked very promising.

So, don\'t write off T4 just because of the first two books (which, let\'s
face it, were rushed out - yes, starships was very late, but it still
appears to have been a rush job).

Aliens and CSC seem to have a good basis, that is their text is good and
there\'s plenty of it. So hopefully there\'s not much anyone can do to screw
them up!

Oh, and if we\'re lucky, The Long Way Home from CORE will be published by
Imperium Games in the near future so those of you who don\'t want to pay the
extortionate airmail costs will be able to get hold of it soon!

	In Sriker (Book 2 pg 38) the per capita GNP figures of worlds at 
various Tech Levels & Trade charecteristics are given (see below)

	Tech	Base 		To find per capita GNP multiply the     
 	 5	2,000		base GNP at that tech level by any 
	 6	4,000		modifiers.
	 7	6,000
	 8	8,000		Modifiers
	 9     10,000		Rich			x1.6
	10     12,000		Industrial		x1.4
        11     14,000		Agricultural		x1.2
        12     16,000		Poor			x0.8
	13     18,000		Non-Agricultural	x0.8
	14     20,000		Non-Industrial		x0.8
	15     22,000


  If we make some scientific wild-ass guesses about how much taxes 
he/she/it pays (based on what\'s \'average\' for a late twentieth-century 
Earthling in an industrialized nation), we figure Uncle Cleon gets 
around Cr5000 to Cr7500 a year.  Now, we can only guess as to which 
percentage of this goes to the planetary military.  In the Yoo Ess, the 
military gets less than 10 percent of total outlays, so applying such a 
figure to the above gets us Cr500 to Cr750 paid to Uncle Cleon\'s 
military each year.  Now, despite what the Department of the Navy might 
want to tell you, the Navy isn\'t the entire military, and doesn\'t get 
the entire defense budget, but the figures cited above (way, way above) 
are perilously near the S.W.A.G.ged figures I just came up with.

	Striker says
	
	Military Spending: The average expenditure of a nation or world 
is 3% of its GNP; this may range between 1% and 15%.  The total must be 
divided between the army & the navy (and COACC and wet navy). The 
portion allocated to the army averages 40% on most worlds (leaving 60% 
or less for the navy) but army allocations average only 6% on vacuum 
worlds.  On Imperial worlds, roughly 30% of the total military budget 
goes to the Imperium for maintenance of the Imperial military.

	With this date we can calculate how much money the average 
Imperial citizen can contribute as follows.

	Base GNP 12,000 	(TL 12 = Average Stellar)
		  x1.00		(no Trade Class modifiers)
		  x0.03		(3% of GNP military spending)
	          x0.70		(30% of military spending goes		
  				 to the Imperium)
	12,000 x 1.0 x 0.03 x 0.70 = Cr 252

	Of this CR 252 40% goes to the army & an unspecified percentage 
to COACC & wet navy.  Even if we assume army includes these branches 
this leaves only 60% left.

	CR 252 x0.60 = CR 151 per capita per anum local naval spending

	We can calculate the average payment to the Imperial military 
per capita as follows (same assumtions as before).

	Cr12,000 x 1.0 x 0.03 x 0.30 = CR 108

	We do not know how much of Imperial military spending goes to 
the Navy, the Marines, the Army & the Scouts.  I have always assumed 
that the Navy gets most of it but this still means that the average 
Imperial citizen contributes a little less than CR 100 per capita to the 
Imperial Navy.
		
	These formulas may also provide a clue as to why the Vargr were 
able to overrun the Corridor sector in the Rebellion.  If we assume that 
the average Vargr planet spends 15% of its GNP (not 3%) on military 
spending then they will be fielding a force 5 times as large.  This will 
 help them a lot.  When you consider that the Vargr are not giving 30% 
of this figure to the Imperium the advantage in planetary forces goes up 
to 7.1 to 1.  Further Vargr forces will tend to be designed with a MUCH 
higher percentage of Jump capable forces than Imperial forces because a 
successsful raid will_get_you_Charisma !!  Therefore Vargr planets will 
have more to throw at the Imperium.

	No the Babylon Project RPG will ship as a book only.  It is 
supposed to be $21.95 US for 190+ pages w/ lots of art.  If you want to 
buy 3 sided dice I reccommend you buy them now !  When B5 comes out (Jan

the dice.  I work for a game store & a games distributor & ordering 
games is what I do for a living.  Game stores have_not_been told that 
the Babylon Project RPG will need 3 sided dice & I predict a vast 
shortage of them.

	Insert shameless plug here.  I work for Boscos Games in 
Anchorage, Ak (907) 274-4112 & we have 3 sided dice in stock right now 
for $0.40 each for opaque numbered 16mm dice in assorted colors (black, 
red, blue, green, etc)  We would love to mail order them to you but the 
postage will probably be more than the dice cost so I suggest you look 
locally first.	Please do not complain that I am useing this list for 
commercial purposes I have not said anything for the last week or so & I

    'body' => 'As a festive "cheer-you-up" after all that \'Starship\' bashing (still not
seen it yet, so can\'t comment), I thought you\'d like some really good news.

Little Black Book supplements are back!  And back with avengeance.  (Only
they\'re not \'black\' any more, they\'re quite natty colour things that are
representative of what is fast becoming the BITS style: slightly
mechanistic but colourful and evocative [1]).

Yes, BITS has published \'101 Cargos\' and \'101 Plots\' and I thought you\'d
like to know about them.  (Having just received my copies in the post a few
days back).  Both books are very much in the style of the old GDW
supplements both in physical size and concept.

I\'ll concentrate on \'101 Cargos\' here and do plots later if that\'s alright
with everyone.

\'101 Cargos\' is by Jo and Lesley Grant, 36 pages long and divided into five
sections and an introduction.

The first section is 6 pages of new rules on generating "instant adventure
links".  I must say that I thought this chapter had escaped from the
\'Plots\' book until I studied it more closely and realised that the links
were all cargo related.  The tables provide easy ways of working out who\'s
doing what to whom - or rather who\'s doing what to who\'s cargo (and why).
The layout is clear, the system appears to work well (though I\'ve not
destructively tested it yet) and the results should provide harried refs
with many instant hooks for adventures.

The second section is another six pages, this time a scheme for designating
Standard Shipping Codes (SCC) for cargos.  This alphanumeric string details
*container* requirements, *cargo* requirements and any additional hazards.
It\'s not difficult to work out and will add flavour to all those previously
non-descript boxes PCs spend a lot of time acquiring/shipping/selling.
Certainly by the time I\'d read through some of the hazard identifiers I
would take *much* more care over just exactly what was in the container!
Scary.

The next section contains the 101 cargos divided into natural resources,
processed resources, manufactured goods and information.  Aiming to be as
generic as possible across any edition of Traveller, you\'re only given a
title and lot size (e.g. Rare Plants (living), Minor Lot\' followed by a
paragraph describing the cargo.  The description is orientated towards
role-playing rather than technical descriptions which makes the contents of
this book that much more usable in a Traveller game in my opinion.  If I
had any complaint it is that no SCCs are provided for any of these cargos -
even as an example.  Having developed a very usable system, it would have
been nice to see it used.

The fourth section is a two page glossary.  Not quite long enough to be
described as \'Library Data\' these entries simply provide brief notes on
some of the "entities, institutions and lifeforms" mentioned in the
preceeding section.  These are easily generic enough to be adapted to any
particular campaign and add just enough detail to make the cargos seem
useful, relevant and interesting.

The fifth section contains 5 pages of tables for generating cargos randomly
based on the trade classification of worlds.  Again these are easy to use,
well thought out, and well designed.  My only criticism of them would be
that they don\'t bear much relationship to the possibilities given in the
main Traveller rules.  This would appear to make them \'alternative\' rather
than complementary to the main book.  Of course, this may not be a bad
thing.

In summary, this is a definite must for referees; certainly if their PCs
ever have anything to do with trade.  The caveat to that is that players
might well want to steer clear of the book.  If they don\'t want their sense
of wonder/surprise to be spoiled by knowing about the cargos they might
encounter in advance, don\'t let them near this.  Nowhere does the book
state it is for referee\'s eyes only, but certainly the middle section of
cargo descriptions contains information players shouldn\'t know in advance.

An admirable addition for Traveller referees from any era, full of nice
touches, occasional humor and lots of bright ideas.

The generic remarks in the previous \'review\' apply for this volume too.
I\'d only add the following: While both the \'101\' books were produced as
\'quickies\', you certainly couldn\'t tell that from the quality of the books.
They might not have a large graphic content but if that\'s the price to pay
for the otherwise excellent production values, it\'s fine with me.  Besides
these are \'only\' supplements!  The book is again by Jo and Lesley Grant
(they must have been busy!) but this time is 40 pages long.

\'101 Plots\' is a book no referee should be without.  The implied warning
there is that players might want to steer clear of it for obvious reasons.
It doesn\'t say it\'s for referees only (like some of the early GDW books
did) but PCs could well spoil things for themselves reading this.  On the
other hand, if they just want to be inspired by the sheer inventiveness to
be found in this volume perhaps it should be up to the referees to change
things round - I\'m sure they will anyway!

As has been mentioned on TML the book claims to actually have 134 plots, in
fact I can reveal that there\'s 135.  (Yes I am a sad person.  Perhaps
there\'s somekind of Jump Space distortion going on here).  However many
there are, what you get ranges from Patron encounters just like GDWs \'76
Patrons\' supplement, to personals which are briefer more for fun.  Let\'s
have a quick look at them:

32 Patron encounters - the usual format of a briefing paragraph followed by
(up to) six outcomes.
15 Introductions - basically 2 or three paragraphs providing a way of
getting PCs to *meet* people.
24 Job Advertisements - the actual text of the advert followed by
descriptive paragraphs relating to the work.
17 Red Herrings - patterned on the Job Ads but the work involved is not so
worth-while!
20 Information Notices - similar to the job ads but leading to info that
may (or may not) be of use to characters.
12 Personals - from the obscure and cryptic to the Valentine \'sickies\' -
fun and just *might* lead to something!
15 gimmicks - 2 to 3 paragraph descriptions of imaginative oddities.

There\'s also a brief glossary with very short entries briefly describing
various things mentioned in the book and there\'s even a page for notes to
keep track of where you\'ve used what plot.

Without quoting any of the items to you (and thereby spoiling the fun),
it\'s hard to say much more.  Each of the items is titled which gives you a
quick and informative reminder of which one\'s which (an index might have
been useful but would have been quite a lot of work to very helpful) and
the entries are imaginative, geared towards role playing and occasionally
down right fun.  I can\'t recommend the usefulness of this book enough as it
provides more than a few \'ideas\' of just the sort that are hardest to come
by when writer\'s block has set in and the well of imagination has run
(however temporarily) dry.

Have fun, enjoy these books, and above all don\'t fear that Marc Miller\'s
Traveller won\'t survive.  If BITS has anything to do with it based on their
first three publications, you don\'t have to worry yet.

No. The major races will be (or are certainly intended to be) detailed one
at a time as they are (re)discovered over the Milieux. That was my
understanding from discussions with Imperium Games.

<grin> But that\'s where I got heretical... I hate battle riders. They\'re
such a pain to deal with, what with having to build tenders and all. I\'m
arguing just for small battleships, instead of the 200-500 Kton monsters in
"Fighting Ships". If you under-armor your line of battle, then you deserve
whatever bad stuff happens to you, as far as I\'m concerned. 

Also, when you\'re building a new squadron, that tender takes up a lot of
valuable yard space that could be better used for building *real*
combatants. In a situation like the one we were talking about before,
jump-capable vessels make a lot more sense and are a much more efficient use
of your shipyard space.

My problem with the "missile-scrubber DD" idea was that it\'s not sustainable
in the long run. While you\'re scrubbing away at the meson-gun battleship,
he\'s turning some of your DDs into space dust. He can go back to base and
repair that damage a lot quicker than you can build more DDs, not to mention
*cheaper*. I always hated the fact that High Guard never had any rules for
running out of missiles, too... got very annoying after a while.

<sigh> I really do wish I\'d picked up a copy of FF&S while it was available,
but I didn\'t. Sounds like some *major* changes were made to the space combat
system... do they still do internal damage the same way?

<grin> Perhaps some of the European members of the list would care to
express the joy they would feel at having to pay only 17-25% of their income
in taxes....

Seriously, though, I think a higher  tax percentage would be reasonable,
plus that number also would include the taxes paid by corporations, plus
other various and sundry taxes/fees/levies. Remember that the "per head"
number is just an approximation, and isn\'t a quote from Uncle Cleon\'s
Department of Revenue. Also, if the military budget goes up percentagewise,
they\'ve got more money to play with. A more optimistic version of the SWAG
numbers above might be done with a 30%tax rate, an assumption that
individual income taxes are only 2/3 of the government income, and that the
military gets 15% of the budget. That would give 2025 Cr per head,
significantly higher than the numbers listed in TCS.

The short story "All the Myriad Ways" is about parallel universes, but 
there is also a Niven anthology with the same title.  Besides containing
that short story, it also contains two essays, based, I think, on 
lectures or discussions given at SF conventions -- "Theory and Practice 
of Teleportation" and "Theory and Practice of Time Travel."  Both are 
very entertaining reading.

My all-time favorite would have to be the original Supplement 9, "Fighting
Ships", although some of the designs could stand some improvement. The only
way you\'re probably going to get hold of a copy is take it from the
bullet-riddled corpse of one of the grognards around here, though...  :)

Wellllllllll.... I have a problem with this, actually. To me, the idea of
measuring shipbuilding capacity in terms of cost seems highly suspect.
High-cost ships/systems/whatever won\'t necessarily take longer to
build/install than their cheaper counterparts. Especially when you\'re
considering new construction, tonnage seems to me a much more accurate
(although, I will concede, imperfect) guide to time required.

<grin> You\'re not, actually... TCS also gives rules for maintaining fleets,
and these requirements *are* based on cost. The *only* place tonnage comes
into it is in allocating yard space for construction, and time to completion
for a particular vessel. *Everything* else is based on the size of your
naval budget... initial construction, maintenance costs, you name it.
However... the assumptions from TCS give a naval budget generally sufficient
to, in times of serious emergency, (and presuming you\'re not already
maintaining a huge fleet), fill your shipyards with new construction.

<grin> Well, Hans\' "average cost" numbers were extremely rough, meant to
allow some "back-of-an-envelope" calculations about shipbuilding capacity.
My High Guard ship designs are in storage, but the MT military craft I have
available seem to support his range of 0.75-1.0 MCr per ton, *very* roughly.
However, as I said above, TCS *does* give evaluations in financial terms.

Hmmm.... well, in that you\'re talking about using a budget, I can agree with
that. However, I have a problem with a yard being able to build a
significantly higher amount of tonnage in a period of time just because they
aren\'t spending as much money on a ship.

>        Fifth, it\'s no harder to figure capacity in MCr than it is to

But, is it any more meaningful? For example, TL 15 laser turrets come in two
versions -- one with grav focusing, and one without. Yet the non-focused
ones use less power (10.69 MW versus 4.90 MW, for heavy lasers), mass less
(144 tons versus 76.89 tons, again for heavy lasers), *and* have less
hardware (no grav focus), but they cost more (2.2 MCr versus 3.00MCr)! Why
should they take longer to install, as they would by your reasoning? (Why do
they cost more? I dunno...)

I just don\'t think basing construction time on cost alone is a very good
idea. It seems much more reasonable to me to base it on displacement
tonnage, and use that as a guideline for what a shipyard can handle at one
time. One also has to remember that, even if the yard can *build* it, if the
Navy can\'t *pay* for it, it doesn\'t get made, unless the referee allows
deficit financing <g>.

I have another request for you good folks.

I want to set up a contact list on my Web page for current (read T4)
company\'s and products.  The idea I have is to list the company name with
the address and phone number and email address and contact (basically all
the ordering information) and then under that info include a list of the
products maybe a synopsis and a price.  Consider it free advertising.

I know where to get the IG information.

I know that Andy Lily has the CORE info and I am getting that from him.

Phil McGregor I think has a Trav Product.  Phil, eMail me what you have and
I will include it.

Someone does a Traveller Magazine (? Traveller Chronicle ?).  Let me know if
you want to be included in the list.

If anyone else currently has a license with IG/FFE, and you have new
Traveller products available, let me know and I will include you too.

When I get the thing done, I will let everyone know and pass out the URL.

Thanks again.

My Take; 

Strike a balance between number of careers and detail.  I\'d love to see
both, of course, but even my traveller budget is limited.

In addition to the "normal" attributes of new careers (skill tables,
promotion etc. tables) I\'d like to see the following;

If a naval or merchant character, what ship did they serve in (name and
class/size) and at what level/position.  This should determine skills or
skills should determine position in some way.  Examples;

John Fredricks enlists as a Navy Ensign (he did NROTC first), Serves
aboard the "Raclaw" a Gazelle Class Close Escort, as Chief Gunner,
patrolling the Lanth Subsectro (location decided by GM, but activity by
table).

Now, since we know he served as Chief Gunner, he must have gone to Gunnery
training class ; Turret Wpns 1 (at least) is mandatory.  Other skills are
those applicable to 1). a small vessel, and 2) Patrol Duty.  this leaves
things pretty wide open, but excludes things like Spinal Weapons, Prop
Aircraft, or Heavy Weapons (bad thing to practice on a ship), and should
make Computer, Vacc Suit, Pistol, Carousing (i.e. on leave at vars ports),
or Electronics, as well as additional turret weapons, more likely since
these are the skill most likely to be encountered.  Also, if a language or
a skill like Liason is selected or rolled it should be proper to the
context and position of the character; "Captain Bordo appoints you as
Aslan Liason and you start to pick up a little of their language."

Second Example;

George Ferrata is a Scientist in his fourth term.  This term (or year) he
takes a grant to do research on a close-solar physics research station as
the interim director (or just director if its 4 years).  He will
definitely get an Admin skill level, and a High-Energy Physics skill level
(or Astrophysics).  His other likely skills are Leadership, Computer, Vacc
suit, Persuasion, Sensors, and electronics.  All consistent withhis
position and activity.  Since he is in a very responsible position and is
quite busy, non-specialized skills like carousing or gun combat (which
would be a side activity to his occupation) are less likely in this
position.  If he were assistant director instead, or still at the (ground
based) University, he might have more time for this.  

A secondary activity could be performed by a character depending on the
assignment.  this could be practicing a martial art (unarmed melee or
armed melee), volunteering for a non-profit organization (liason,
admin/legal, persuasion) or generally getting into trouble (carousing,
forgery, streetwise).  An enlisted army soldier or a graduate student 
might be able to have 2 secondary activities, while the above named
Research Center Director might have none, and an "unemployed" person (or a
Noble?) would have nothing but secondaries.    

What this seems to be turning into is making every year/term like the
"special Assignments" in the CT book 5-7 (?) methods.  It makes the
generation more like a story than a raw accumulation of skills and
ranks.

When we did character generation this campaign I did this \'on the fly\' and
although it worked out ok, I had wished there was a list in front of me of
various activity categories and rank/command equivalents.

You did ask for suggestions, didn\'t you?

    'body' => 'Hi - here\'s another question on Jump Drive from a newbie to this 
list:
Back in \'95 I was running a brief TNE campaign in which the PCs were 
crew on a Broadsword-class mercenary cruiser, capable of Jump 3. In 
an encounter with a bunch of Vampire ships, the Broadsword\'s Jump 
drive was damaged, leaving it capable of only Jump1, with the nearest 
system 2 parsecs away. 
Now, the players reckoned that as the ship had plenty of fuel, it 
could still make 2 Jump1 jumps and reach another star. I ruled against this 
on the basis that if the ship jumped into interstellar space they 
wouldn\'t be able to plot its coordinates accurately enough for its 
next jump to take it anywhere near the right planet - they\'d probably 
arrive outside the orbit of that system\'s outermost planets and face a long, 
long trip. Ergo they had to land the ship and repair the J-drive, 
allowing me to run an adventure I had planned. 
Was I right? If jumps to and from interstellar space are possible, 
what\'s to stop any Jump1 ship doing this? Even if it couldn\'t carry 
enough fuel, presumably it could use an interstellar depot, and these 
would be standard between inhabited systems (though  in TNE they\'d be 
mostly stripped bare).
Any advice most appreciated.
As an aside, I waited many years before finally buying Traveller - in 
retrospect it was unfortunate that the edition I got was TNE. I quite 
like the rules system, except for the vehicle & starship combat 
rules, which I still don\'t properly comprehend - I used some"High Guard" 
variant  damage rules from an old White Dwarf article, where damage 
was  in tonnes, which I liked. Are the T4 starship combat rules any 
simpler? If so, I may give it a try.

	Nope, the players are right...this is the commonest reason to put
oversize fuel capacity in low jump number ships.

	Now we get to the heart of the matter, and one that\'s been done to
stomped flat death over and over again...over there...next to that other
two dimensional 0.1C rock that looks vaguely like a horse ;-)

	There is nothing to stop this, once you get past the little black
book concept of jump tapes. Once computers are powerful enough to
calculate jump coordinates on their own, you can pretty much jump anywhere
you want.  As I said, that is the biggest reason to sacrifice cargo space
for fuel capacity.

	Economically, however, fuel depots in deep space are really,
really expensive, and are likely used only by people for whom cost is no
matter, like the military or intelligence services (leading to my favorite
quote from Independence Day 4, when Judd Hirsch says to someone "How\'d
they pay for this???!!! You don\'t REALLY think anyone ever spent $300 on a
HAMMER, do you?")

There\'s a Really Simple Ship Combat System out there; I remember it being
announced, and I have my nice all formatted copy at home, where I can\'t
see it to tell you who did it, other than I know Joe Walsh was involved
with it.

I see it as *any* type of cone, whether the base is circular (as Edward
suggests) or rectangular (Dane\'s "pointy wedge")

Note that the original design (Traders & Gunboats) had notes to the effect
that the design was laid out specifically to prevent the enlisted
personnel from being able to mutiny and hijack the ship.  To keep to this
traditional layout, I think you should bunk all Officers on the upper deck
and all enlisted on the lower deck.

Also, I seem to remember that the  Captain (a Lt. Cmdr?) doubled as the
pilot (or navigator, I suppose), which is consistent with the fact that
there are only two seats on the bridge. 

Nice design though.  Definitely combines the \'normal\' armament of lasers
with the unexpected punch of the Particle Accellerator.  I think I\'ll try
to design a barbette mounter PA turret tonight though, just to try to get
it a bit closer to the original (although a Spinal Mount is probably
closer to the *spirit* of the original).

P.S. No, Douglas, You cannot have a spinal mount on the CE!

Yes, but all of that money does NOT go 100% to new ship construction. 
Remember the other arms of military service get their fair share.

Not to mention I would bet that only a small percentage of military 
spending goes towards construction of new ships. Most would go towards 
maintenance of existing ships, and personnell costs.

decided to do a little research for Traveller. Since I work for a mining 
company, I got to wondering about how you\'d mine Lanthanum...

	So here is more info than you ever wanted to know about where lanthanum 
appears in the universe.

	The only mineral I cound find containing lanthanum (there are probably 
others, but very, very rare) is Monazite. Chemical formula is (Ce, La, Nd, 
Th)PO(4). Its a rare earth phosphate.

	Monazite appears in stubby to tabular prismatic crystal, and is yellow to 
brownish-red in colour. However, it is usually disemminated  in microscopic 
granules.

	It is a common accessory mineral in granites, syenites and gneisses. It is 
also somewhat resistant to weathering, so it can be concentrated in fluvial 
or marine placers (monazitic sands).



	WEll, I hope someone can use this info. If your players ever wind up 
visiting a lanthanum mine, or go looking for lanthanum, now you know what 
they might look like.

Thanks - I guess I was misled by the old "Imperium" boardgame, which 
I bought many years back. where 22nd century Terra faces off against 
the Vilani First Imperium with Jump2 drive ships only. In it, any travel 
between worlds further than 2 parsecs apart must be done at sublight 
speed, taking several years!

I feared as much, but it had been bugging me for the past two years!

Hmm - I\'m not sure why this should be so, since presumably they wouldn\'t need
that much maintenance or crew, just frequent resupply.  The prevalence of 
Jump1 ships in TNE would also seem to make depots between the main worlds 
of pocket empires a good commercial idea, particularly those that 
could only build Jump1 drives.

NOPE. AFAIK, a wedge is an irregular cylinder. A triangle in profle, a
rectangle for top and bottom views. Like a door stop. Or a cheeze wedge.

formula for area would be: V = 1/2 * B * h

Where the base is the area of the "rear", h is the length of the ship.

Check out Fusion, Fire & Steel page 42: Psionic Transfer Drives. Max range
in parsecs is square root of Psi strength plus Teleportation skill level +
1d10. Psion in question must have the Teleport skill and Clairvoyance skill.

It is one of the alternate drive technologies that TNE introduced. I do not
recall any CT usage of teleportation based drives.

Now come the questions...

	This seems good only for planetary deposits of lanthanum, since
IIRC all of the above are metamorphic rocks, implying tectonic processes,
no? Also, fluvial anything isn\'t going to happen without water, right?

	 OTOH since I live in a valley whose floor is composed of just
such kind of rock...maybe I should start looking ;-)

	Now for the fun part...what would this look like in an asteroid
deposit? Unfortunately, my \'knowledge\' of where asteroids come from is
still in the old Willy Ley era of a shattered Planet X...anyone have a
source for a bit more up-to-date theory on the formation of asteroids?

anyone out there is interested in SF novels in the New Era setting,

draft is still in publishing limbo somewhere.  Emery tells me that 
interested parties might inquire of Cory Solomon at Imperium Games (the
California branch) about it.

The story is set on an aging cluster of O\'Neil pods.  Here is the blurb 
that was going to go on the back:

- ----

  Hunted hackers fight to keep an alien world from exploding...

  One minute Sam and Hannah are engineers on a Coalition spaceship, the next
  they\'re plunged into a creaking, crumbling station in the Wilds, filled
  with rabid wolf-folk and xenophobic colonists.

  Lost, abandoned, they explore dark reaches of fragmenting technology while
  battling rogue robots and killer viruses.  Soon they discover they\'re on a
  relic of the Collapse, a pod-world turned inside out, spinning through
  space -- in danger of spinning apart.

  Earthquakes worsen, fires rage, radiation and ozone leak as battle erupts
  between Coalition Marines and locals, and three warring populations hunt
  them like rats.

  Plying antique weapons, hacking forgotten software, cobbling cutting-edge
  technology, racing from asteroids to eerie dead worlds, Sam and Hannah
  fight to stay alive and stabilize the station.

  They\'ve got mere hours to prevent the construct from flying to pieces.  And
  to do it, they must trust the  deadliest killer in the known galaxy --
  Virus.

Clayton Emery has written several fantasy novels in game settings, 
including the "Whispering Woods" trilogy for the "Magic: The Gathering"
series, as well as several historical mystery stories featuring Robin Hood
as a detective.  I\'ve written a couple of RPG books -- "Mythic Egypt" 
and "Time Riders," for Iron Crown.

If you take an annual naval ship and maintenance budget and expand it over 40
years, using a maintenance cost of 10% of the price of the ships, you end up
with a fleet that costs about 990% of the annual budget.  This leaves you with
maintenance costs of 99% and new ship purchases of 1%.  This may not be far
from the norm.  This would also support your thought of new ship construction
being only a small percentage of the total ship budget.

The maintenance cost of 10% I saw floating around the digest somewhere, but I
can\'t recall where.

Aliens Archive, and T4 itself), let\'s take a look at how they\'ve done so  
far:


Marc Miller\'s Traveller
=======================
Editing:  Poor.  A few dozen errata items, many typographical and 
grammatical errors.
Rules:  Solid.  Get rid of the editing errors, and it\'ll be near-perfect.
Overall Score:  85%


Starships
=========
Editing:  Poor.  A few errata items, a few typographical errors, and a 
very poor use of language.
Ships:  Very poor.  Extremely short ship descriptions.  Useless deckplans.
Rules:  Excellent.  A few minor typographical errors, but near-perfect.
Overall Score: 50%


Central Supply Catalog
======================
Editing: Excellent.
Item Descriptions:  Excellent.  Very useful.  Retains the Traveller feel.
Rules:  Excellent.  Well-thought-out, and very useful.  Greg Porter has 
done for vehicles what SSDS did for starships.
Miscellaneous:  Add a couple dozen weapons, and it would be perfect.
Overall Score: 95%


Aliens Archive
==============
Editing:  Excellent.
Alien Descriptions:  Excellent.  Enough detail without being burdensome.
Rules:  Very good.  Again, enough to provide a solid platform for play.
Miscellaneous:  The font size and the inclusion of the "concept" 
sketches shows that Tim Brown
had to work to make this into a 96-page supplement.  It would have been 
nice if, instead, Timhad included 3 or 4 more aliens, or a bit more 
detail on each alien. 
Overall Score: 95%


Marc Miller\'s Traveller Overall Score (all four books):  81.25%


What\'s next??
=============

JTAS #25 will be back from the printer next week.  With the holidays and 
all, expect it in stores in early January.  Subscribers can expect it 
around the same time, I think.

Milieu 0: The Third Imperium and First Survey will be released together 
(as Aliens and CSC were).  Expect to see them in stores around January 
23.  If you ordered them direct, expect them within a week of that, I 
believe.

Further into the future, we can expect Emperor\'s Arsenal (sometime in 
February, most likely), and JTAS #26 (late February, early March).  

Even further into the future (and here we get into products that are 
still in the early stages of design - not much written, just some 
concepts and such tossed around) we can expect Pocket Empires and a few 
other projects to round out the first half of the year.

I often portray Imperial cultural revulsion to psionics as sexual, like revulsion to 
various sexual acts -- the person feels both fear and fascination.  I think that the 
only way to make the psionics suppressions so effective was to make such a link -- 
i.e., that it\'s inexpressibly dirty to have your mind read, or to read another\'s 
(telepathy is the most common and most important psionic ability, so the one that got 
most of the focus during the suppressions).

Some backlash, especially among expatriate Imperials in and beyond the Spinward Marches, 
occurs and takes a similarly sexual form.  For example, Zhodani lovers and spouses are 
much prized (at least aloud) for their abilities to (1) know everything you want and (2) 
be able to touch you in ways you thought impossible (by telekinesis).  On the other 
hand, with clairvoyance and teleportation, they can easily cheat on you and still know 
when you\'re on the way home and get there before you.

Geez.  This new custom of laying people off just before Christmas really 
stinks.  

My sympathy goes out to the TSR employees who were recently laid off.  I 
know very well that being suddenly without a steady stream of income is 
devastating.

Well, yes and no. No-one as ever stated this sort of thing out loud and
there has always been the assumption (in all the published Traveller
materials that I have read/seen) that local TL = maximum TL of whatever is
available. In any case, what I am saying is that the actual difference in
cost will be minimal in actual terms ... your TL15 computer costing (say)
1000 Cr on the world of proiduction might cost 1100 Cr on a TL5 world two
or three jumps away (the real killer will be in the parts and servicing).
However, the *locals* will not be earning the same average income of a TL15
world resident ... say, for example, the equivalent of 20-30k Cr pa ... but
will be earning a lesser *actual* amount, say 2-3k Cr pa. So the TL15
computer will be 10 times more expensive for them than it is for the TL15
resident.

Actually, this is sort of extreme as an example, but gets the point across.
What does it mean? It means that the local TL5 government and the wealthy
(and perhaps upper middle class) and probably major industries use TL15
components at key points. It means that *travellers* can buy what they need
at minimal markups. Perhaps there won\'t be the *range* of choice they\'re
used to - so there\'ll only be a General Products TL15 Computer rather than
fifteen assorted (identical for game purposes) brands - but the cost will
be *minimally* more.

Think the difference between somewhere like, say, Nigeria (or
Guinea-Bissau) in Africa and the US. The stuff is still available and
pretty widely. Local incomes are what restricts its actual ownership by the
bulk of the local populace.

1. What is Traveller?

   Traveller is a Science Fiction role-playing game now published by
   Imperium Games. Three previous editions were originally published by
   Game Designer\'s Workshop (GDW). These were the Classic Traveller,
   Mega-Traveller and Traveller-The New Era. For a description of the
   differences between these three earlier editions see the review.
   
   More information about Imperium Games is available from the Imperium
   Games FAQ and also from Imperium Games\' Web Site.

     _________________________________________________________________
   
2. All About The Traveller Mailing Lists (Updated)

   The Traveller Mailing List (TML) is open to discussions on all aspects
   of Traveller. It exists as a means for the Traveller Player/GM to
   exchange ideas and discuss the various aspects of the Traveller
   System, and its universe. This includes discussions on Marc Miller\'s
   Traveller, Traveller: The New Era, Mega Traveller and Classic
   Traveller. This also includes the background.
   
   The old XBoat mailing list has now been closed. Discussions on Classic
   Traveller and Mega-Traveller can be made on the TML.
   
  2.1. How Do I Subscribe? (Updated)
  
   To subscribe to the TML, send a mail message to
   majordomo@lists.MPGN.COM and in the body, place the following line if
   you wish to receive each message separately (real time mode):

   subscribe traveller

   Or, if you wish to receive a couple of messages each day with all of
   the day\'s messages in them (digest mode), use the following line:

   subscribe traveller-digest

  2.2. How Do I Unsubscribe? (Updated)

   To leave the TML, send a message to majordomo@lists.MPGN.COM and in
   the body put the lines:

   unsubscribe traveller
   unsubscribe traveller-digest

   This will ensure that you are no longer subscribed to either real time
   or digest mode.
   
  2.3. How Do I use the List Processor? (Updated)
  
   The list processor is the program that manages the lists. Its address
   is majordomo@lists.mpgn.com.
   
   The digests generated by the lists are archived on ftp.MPGN.COM in the
   Gaming/Traveller/MailingListArchive/Traveller/ and
   Gaming/Traveller/MailingListArchive/Xboat/ directories which are
   available either by anonymous ftp, or using the list processor. To get
   a copy of an old TML digest, send a message to
   majordomo@lists.mpgn.com with the following in the body:

  get traveller digestname     e.g. get traveller v1996.n001

   For an old XTML digest, the body should contain:

  get xboat digestname         e.g. get xboat v1996.n001

   Please note that if you are subscribed to the traveller-digest, or
   xboat-digest lists, then you will need to those names instead of the

3. What are the etiquette rules for the lists? (Updated)

   Here are a few guidelines for posting your thoughts to the TML. Please
   note that they are only guidelines. They are intended to make
   everybody\'s life easier by keeping the noise level down and keeping
   the content high.
     * All messages should have a meaningful title. Please don\'t use "Re:
       Traveller-digest V1996 #2" or anything similar.
     * Any message which is over about 150 lines should be labelled as
       LONG in the title. This gives a warning to those running terminal
       sessions over slow links.
     * If you have a very long message that is not relevant to everybody,
       please consider making it available on an FTP or WWW site instead.
       Then announce it\'s existance on the list. A good example of
       material suitable for this is program listings and scripts.
     * Flame wars should be quickly extinguished or moved to personal
       email addresses.
     * When quoting, please follow these guidelines:
          + Please quote the minimum amount possible to show what you are
            responding to. Remember everybody has already read the
            original message, they just need to remember it! :-)
          + Please don\'t paste in 5 generations of replies on a
            particular topic, or an entire 150 line message. Excerpts
            work best.
          + Don\'t quote signatures.
          + Don\'t quote a message just to say "me too"
          + Remember that copyright applies on the net too. Get
            permission before extensively quoting a published work.
     * Signatures should be limited to around 4 lines please.
     * MIME types such as BASE64 aren\'t handled too well in digest
       format, so please avoid using them.

 I haven\'t seen the T&G plans - but:  Drawings should have as
 much detail as can be reasonably managed.  Locate and orient
 fixtures clearly, indicate sliding door panels, manual hatches,
 and iris valves clearly and distinctly, in all orientations.
 Ideally, load-bearing (or perhaps "stress-bearing") walls/
 members should be visually distinct on the plans; this will
 facilitate a reader "gutting" the ship and doing his own
 deckplan (for a custom job).

T::>5) Descriptions of each number room


T::>I could do 1 or 2 m squares, but 1.5 is the closest thing to standard

 0.5 would actually be best, given previous discussion.  A
 reasonable way of handling this might be for the 1.0 or 1.5 m
 lines to be at "standard" darkness (say about 40% grey), while
 the 0.5 m lines are lighter (say about 15-25% grey) - the
 latter should be visible but not obtrusive, so that they can be
 ignored if desired.  This IMO would be a reasonable compromise
 for all users.

I already feared so :-)  Maybe I should have taken more time to read
through everything in FF&S when I got it.  Sadly I started with the weapon
design rules and they really put me off (weapons always seemed to be a
little underpowered in TNE IMHO).  Oh well :-)

I knew that it was done by volunteers (and I applaud them for doing it...
I remember how much time such things cost from when I helped to proofread
the german version of the GURPS rules).

Given that you had but a week the results are excellent.  Now I wonder why
they gave you but one week (Starships was late several months... what
*did* Don Perrin [and the others involved] do with Starships during all
that time).

For but one week of work (in your spare time) the results really *are*
excellent.  I just wish that IG somehoe would manage to coordinate their
schedule a little better (and thus would be able to give more time to the
obviously very capable people on GDW-Beta to do even better and more
complete work).

I don\'t know why but I find SSDS to be somewhat more usable than FF&S.
Maybe because the required rules are not spread out through a huge book,
maybe even because of the tables (although I still want to have formulae),
I don\'t know.  I\'ll think about this a little more.

I probably missed it or forgot about it (since I did not want to start
playing before I have more background information the rules are currently
just lying around unused and my mind is busy with my diploma thesis ;-).

Thanks again for your extensive comments.  This was very enlightening.

        ROTFL!  Wierd coincidence: I\'ve just been trying to work up a grav
bike capable of something more than just a measly 3G acceleration...  The
vehicle design rules are not as easy to use as the SSDS.  However, I have
high hopes...

Being the GM with the gleam, and having already reviewed the document in

   You\'ve neglected the portal to the pocket universe where the driver
would store his annual cargo.  Then again, it\'s possible that it is
carried in a bag, in which case it would not be included in the basic
design.

   Also, the propulsion system doesn\'t seem quite right.  Given that the
vehicle is meant to travel to dozens of houses per second, I would think
that it would employ some sort of near C drive, allowing the occupant to
cover much more ground than would otherwise be possible in normal
time/space.

   BTW, the nose of the lead beast of burden does indeed constitute a
sensor, and imparts an all-weather capability to the vehicle.

   Good luck with the design.

Harold

Well I would be interested in how people do combats both starship and
individual.  It seems to me one of the goals a gamesmaster would have
is to keep it moving without looking like he/she is leading to a pre-
determined solution.  

And a general question about Traveller is the roleplaying aspects of the
game.  I have been running Champions for 14 years or so, and have grown
tired of it, so I\'m going back to Traveller.  A primary benefit of Champions
is that you can use the city you live in as a back drop and it\'s hard to
find a more detailed play aid then that!  In fantasy rpgs you can work
on developing a village or a city and the surrounding terrain.  But in
Traveller you have to define whole worlds!  How can you do that without
having them look like cardboard cut outs?  It seems to me that it would
take an awful lot of work to do it properly.  I had hoped some of the
new T4 offerings would provide that kind of detail but I think now that
will not happen.  They seem to interested in the nuts and bolts of the 
future they are defining to stop and define some of the color.  

But I digress, thanks for your help.  If I cannot get IRC working with
the new provider I will drop you a line.  Sorry this is so late in
coming back, but life\'s been busy lately. :)

design system.  Quite simply, the system is a real beast to use the first
time around; consistent use of the same units would be the way to go, IMHO.
Also, the layout in the .pdf file is appallingly hard to work with;
properly lined up columns would have been nice...  However, it\'s a beta,
so...

        Another point is that costs should vary with Tech level; I noticed
this when putting the radar in; 80,000 1978 US dollars for a radar witha
30Km range might be an acceptable price if you\'re the Pentagon, but as in a
previous job incarnation I personally sold several different recreational
marine radar units with roughly comparable ranges for 1,500 to 2,000 1991
Canadian dollars.  I therefore revised the price accordingly on the radar
unit.  As well, there are no tables for sensor weight or other data; just
price and range...

        The inspiration was the grav cycle design included in the beta
.pdf.  I looked at that thing and thought to myself: "Hm... accelerates at
a measly 3Gs, and can\'t go supersonic because it\'s only got a front
fairing?  Bah!".  I figure these things would go a long way towards raising
the average IQ among the youth of Sylea...

Dimensions: 2.& small change m long, a bit less than that high, and a bit
over 1 m wide.  If & when I do a drawing of this, I\'ll update.  I visualize
it as looking something like one of those funky Japanese sport bikes but  a
little bigger, with more volume aft and with a glass bubble canopy
streamlined aft from where the fairing ends that fully encloses the rider,
to let it operate at high altitudes and at trans-sonic speeds.

Acceleration (one rider) 20 G\'s.

Top Speed (using megawatts/mass in tons*3000; VDS is unclear as to whether
this is applicable to grav vehicles): 1392.91 km/h.


        The reason I put the siren in is because loud pipes save lives;
pedestrian fatalities are greatly reduced if they can hear things coming.
So, I figured a simple air-powered siren like the things they mounted on
Stukas in WWII would do the job nicely and sound really cool, too.  The
radar is for collision-avoidance purposes; I figure it\'d start sounding an
alarm if a collision was imminent.  The long-range comm is a must.

        I also figure that a G-suit with some sort of harness arrangement
with attachments at chest, waist, knees, and wrists would be required to
keep the rider on the bike.




"News item, Sylea, Day 340 Year 1:

        The Sylean Consumer Product Safety Council (SCPSC) and Mothers
Against Grav Cycle Carnage (MAGCC) today released a joint denunciation of
Famille Spofulam Gravitic Transports for releasing their latest sport Grav
cycle, the Ludaccel-20.  Stated MAGCC President Emthiilda Netsooj, "The
Ludaccel is a lethal menace to the public!  How many more of our children
will die before the government acts and bans  all grav vehicles capable of
more than 0.5 G\'s?"  The SCPSC press release noted that the grav craft in
question was capable of possibly fatal accelerations of up to 20 G\'s and
that the acceleration safety governor was implemented in software, not
hardware, thereby tempting performance hungry owners to illegally modify
the craft to reach dangerous performance levels.  With regard to its top
speed, the press release notes that "any vehicle with supersonic capability
and non-hardware governing devices poses a grave property damage risk from
sonic booms, especially when operating in urban areas".

        When contacted for comment, FSGT spokesperson Festphal Indifar
stated that the decision to implement the safety governor in software was
made with weight reduction in mind; "The Ludaccel is, after all, built for
speed!".  Noting the Ludaccel\'s high price tag (34,625 credits), she
stated: "Most if not all of the purchasers of the Ludaccel will be wealthy
citizens and nobles racing them on the amateur circuit or on their own
estates".  She requested that FSGT\'s contributions to several grav cycle
public safety awareness campaigns be noted, and added "While we have the
greatest sympathy for Mrs. Netsooj\'s tragic bereavement, we feel that grav
cycles don\'t kill people, people kill people.  Clearly, education, not
regulation, is the key."

TNE under the heading "Trade and commerce" discusses this very issue.
It gives a table which is used for both currency exchange and for computing
the price of imports.

Your TL-15 computer at Cr 1000, on a world with class A port costs
Cr 2500  on a TL-5 world with a class C port. As an imported good, it would
be available, but quite expensive.

An income of 20 kCr on the first world would have the buying power of 50
kCr on the second: an equivalent income on in real terms on the second
world would be 8 kCr.

So: the computer which would be  5% of the annual income of someone living
on the first world, would cost some 30% of the annual income at someone at
a similar economic level on the second, or 6 times more expensive.

Warships are expensive precisely because they require armor, weaponry, fire
control, beefy maneuver and jump drives and power plants, which are less or
not necessary in other craft.
Construction of starships (or anything else) cannot proceed faster than the
pace of the slowest subsystem, and there are *hundreds* of potentially
limiting factors. The tonnage of your shipyard is not necessarily even the
most important.  Suppose you can only get so many cubic meters per week of
hull material or lanthanum for the jump drive, or the superconductor plant
can only fully supply one of your subcontracters at a time, or all the
cargo shuttles are busy today...Somebody has to build that @#$&*% laser
turret, and if perchance they can\'t deliver it on schedule, either your
ship just got cheaper or it held up a berth in your shipyard for x hours.
Same with every other component.
The bigger and more expensive your ship is, the more likely it is that some
costly special equipment you *must* have could be in short supply at the
exact moment *you* need it.
Economically, there is a tradeoff.
On one hand, your more expensive ship of the same tonnage could take longer
to build. The greater burdens of warships on the same industrial base other
ships use, gives slower supply rates and more delays (Ideally foreseen and
included in scheduling).
OTOH, you can spend money (one way or another) to get people and their
resources to leave whatever else they might be doing to get all the
specialized military subsystems in the same time that a less demanding
civilian or auxiliary ship would take.
Most often, you will compromise so that a warship will take only *somewhat*
longer and use *somewhat* more resources than any other kind.
The same factors work in reverse for cheaper ships.
All these factors thus make MCr a better measure than tonnage alone for
ship construction rates and shipbuilding capacity.

  Well, not FF&S, but I have done a small Java applet to do Hull

building using QSDS. Both of these are pretty much compatible with FF&S.

Gneiss is a metamorphic rock.  Gneiss is a high-grade metamorphic rock,
consisting of bands of quartz and feldspar and thus of the same stuff you\'d
see in igneous rocks like granite. But granite and syenite are both igneous
rocks, just like monzonite. They form in plutonic bodies, which is to say,
they develop out of magma chambers. I guess you could still consider these
"planetary" deposits, but you wouldn\'t need anything more than a rock with
no atmosphere to produce it. As long as some molten activity brought up and
concentrated the minerals near the surface so you could more easily get to
them. You\'re right on the weathering and eroding into sands, you\'d obviously
need the benefits of air and water for that. :) 

>Now for the fun part...what would this look like in an asteroid

Good question. If it was from material left over from the solar system\'s
formation, I don\'t think there would be any significant deposits of this
stuff. It would be scattered when the solar system was formed and asteroids
forming from that detritus would primarily be iron-nickel, I\'d think. No
tectonic processes, no igneous or metamorphic rocks. If they were planetary
remains, sure there could be asteroids rich in the minerals and rock types
in question. You\'d just have to make that "strike" and uncover them.

     Have A Stealth Christmas
     
     \'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the skys, Air 
     defenses were up, with electronic eyes.
     Combat pilots were nestled in ready-room beds, As enemy silhouettes 
     danced in their heads.
     
     Every jet on the apron, each SAM in its tube, Was triply-redundant 
     linked to the Blue Cube, And ElInt and AWACS gave coverage so dense
     That nothing that flew could slip through our defense.
     
     When out of the klaxon arose such a clatter
     I dashed to the screen to see what was the matter; I dialed up the 
     gain and then quick as a flash Fine-adjusted the filters to damp out 
     the hash.
     
     And there found the source of the warning we\'d heeded: An incoming 
     blip, by eight escorts preceded.
     "Alert status red!" went the word down the wire,
     As we gave every system the codes that meant "FIRE"!
     
     On Aegis!  Up Patriot, Phalanx and Hawk!
     And scramble our fighters -- let\'s send the whole flock! Launch decoys 
     and missiles!  Use chaff by the yard!
     Get the kitchen sink up!  Call the National Guard!
     
     They turned toward the target, moved toward it, converged. Till the 
     tracks on the radar all finally merged,
     And the sky was lit up with a demonic light,
     As the foe met his fate in the high arctic night.
     
     So we sent out some recon to look for debris,
     Yet all that they found, both on land and on sea,
     Were some toys, a red hat, a charred left leather boot, Broken 
     sleighbells, white hair, and a deer\'s parachute.
     
     Now it isn\'t quite Christmas, with Saint Nick shot down. There are 
     unhappy kids in each village and town.
     For the Spirit of Christmas can\'t hope to evade All the web of 
     defenses we\'ve carefully made.
     
     Just look how the gadgets we use to protect us In other ways alter, 
     transform, and affect us.
     They keep us from things that make life more worth living, Like love 
     for each other, and thoughts of just giving.
     
     But a crash program\'s on:  Working hard, night and day, All the elves 
     are constructing a radar-proof sleigh.
     So let\'s wait for next Christmas, in cheer and in health, For the 
     future has hope:  Santa\'s coming by stealth!

If so, there\'s a contradiction out there.  I seem to remember a discussion
of a freak "interstellar teleportation" power somewhere.  Does anyone else
recall it?  I think it allowed you to teleport a parsec.

    'body' => 'Well, Starships has arrived.

I\'ve read it (didn\'t take long) and I thought I\'d follow the trend and post my
reactions. I will pass over the fact that only one of the two copies I ordered
arrived, because my order was pre-California and the shambles of such orders is
already well documented. I will also not dwell on my feelings for the T4 ship
design and combat system, which I feel is too basic (a de-bugged MT system is my
taste), because that\'s a System Wars sort of thing and subjective; it\'s a matter
of preference.

No, the thing that really disappointed me were the deck plans. They were bound
to be the central feature of the book, and as a confirmed deckplan junkie I was
hoping for something rather nice. Sadly, I was disappointed.

The plans are bald, plain blocks of empty white space, seperated with door
symbols. In some cases, only a cross-section is provided. No furniture, control
systems, and few couches are marked. In many cases, there are significant
amounts of space enclosed by walls and hatches which are unlabelled; there are
no clues to what they should be.

The scout/courier, for instance, has no staterooms, sensor bay or fire control
areas marked at all; there is an empty room at the front marked "cockpit" and a
larger one aft of that without any markings at all. Aft of that is a ludicrous
arrangement of a big rectangular cargo bay placed smack in the middle of a
larger rectangular space, wasting most of the latter in long twin corridors
going around this spurious cargo area. If the "cargo hold" (why? in a S/C?) had
beein at one corner of this area, there would have been room for at least 2
staterooms. The drives appear to take up about half the live zone - OK, maybe
simpler tech = larger clockwork. There are no external hatches marked at all
(shit! we\'re trapped, cap\'n! We cannae get oot o\' the ship!), nor weapon
fittings. There are no freshers (no freshers! Shades of the Type R - the ship
without a bog!) There is no grid shown.

For the purposes of roleplaying it\'s completely useless. I can just see a player
saying "I\'m in my cabin, where is it?" or "We board and charge down the
corridor. Where do we find ourselves?" I\'d have to make it up which makes the
plans completely and utterly pointless. That\'s what they\'re supposed to be
_for_!

The plans in this book show every sign of having been thrown together in five
minutes on a Friday after the pub, without any playtesting. The "back to Classic
Traveller" approach has gone too far here, I\'m afraid. Some of the very early
deck plans were this basic; but in the years since, so much more has been done.
I\'ve been CADding up deck plans for five years with more detail than this. There
are web sites linked to IG\'s which offer beautiful plans which quite literally
brought tears to my eyes - Doradis Cluster I think it\'s called, with lovely 3d
effects on the plans. Digest Group\'s stuff in the Alien Modules and Starship
Operator\'s Guide were splendid. Compared to that, this doesn\'t begin to stand
up.

I was under the impression that detailed ship combat would be herein. Was I
wrong? Whatever, here it ain\'t. Again, no System Wars approach, but even a
reprint of the Quick system developed on the TML would have been nice.

I hate to say all this, because I was very hopeful for the new Traveller. I
pre-ordered everything, didn\'t I? And I didn\'t set out to have a slagging
session. But this product reminds me most of all of the deadful Fighting Ships
of the Shattered Imperium. Slapped together stats and pictures, with no soul.
These ships don\'t live! Contrast them, you who remember, with "IISS Ship Files";
each ship detailed in loving care, or "Traders and Gunboats", a true classic.

The bright spot for me is the art. A passel of colour Foss plates - beautiful. I
can see them gracing my monitor as Windows Wallpaper already! If I\'d been told I
was buying a Foss Portfolio I would have thought it value for money.

Come on IG. You can do better than this. I know that. I look forward to the
Equipment Manual. Don\'t let me down.

The base GNP for TL 12 worlds is 16,000, not 12,000. Also, you forget that 
high-population worlds are of a higher average TL than medium and low-
population worlds. And high-population worlds supply 99% of the Imperial
revenue. Secondly, almost half of all high-population worlds are industrial.
Thus the average Imperial citizen spends closer to 20,000*1,2*0.03*0.7 =
Cr504. _Very_ close to the TCS figure.

The world of Mikesh (Corridor 0206) for example, has a GNP of Cr28,000 per
capita, which would make its planetary navy worth 211,680 billon credits
even if you give the army 40% (note, btw. that according to _Striker_ 
planetary defenses are jointly funded by the army and navy). 

Btw. can anyone tell me what kind of planetary army you can get for a yearly
budget of 14,112 billion credits?

I have some doubts about that. I don\'t think a nation can be on maximum war
footing for decades without ruining its economy. England almost ruined itself
during WW2. So did the Soviet Union in the Cold War. The question is whether
the 15% is the maximum sustainable over a short term or the maximum sustainable
over the long term. I don\'t know enough about Real Life economics to say.
However, I don\'t mind assuming that the Vargr use more than the Imperial
planets on their navy.

>When you consider that the Vargr are not giving 30% of this figure to the

Ah, but the moment the Corridor planets wave goodbye to the Corridor fleets,
they also cease to have to pay to maintain them. This releases a lot of 
money which can be used on new construction or, even better, reactivating
mothballed ships.

The problem is that the Vargr are not a monolitic union of dedicated
conquerors. The people who build and maintain the national fleets and
the corsairs are two different groups. Supreme Packleader Barrkh of the
Union of 60 billion Vargr does _not_ want to send off his fleet to conquer 
Mikesh. He wants to keep it at home to defend his planets against corsairs 
from further coreward. His problem is that some of his subordinates sometimes 
gets the urge to go AWOL and do a little free-lance plundering (You know, on 
the principle that non-jump capable ships cannot desert, I\'d could make a
good case for Vargr governments building _more_ such and _less_ jump-
capable ships). So his fleet admirals are surely chosen from his most trusted 
followers. As we go down the line of command his officers gets farther and
farther away from his personal charisma, so I can see individual ships,
perhaps even squadrons, deserting him (Well, I suppose even a whole fleet
once in a while. But surely not _all_ his fleets at the same time). Once 
they\'ve deserted, they\'d better not go home to him again. Fortunately the 
Vargr are so disunited (frankly, its a question whether any Vargr can ever 
be in the postion of leading 60 billion fellow Vargr) that they can go 
somewhere else and pay for their next maintenance if they\'ve scored big or 
put take over, if they are strong enough, or hire out if they are down on 
their luck.

The article about Vargr corsairs in JTAS #21 makes it clear that Vargr
corsair bands tend to fragment long before they become a threat to even
high-medium worlds, much less high-population worlds. And the high-
population worlds are the ones that matter.

Hmmm.  The S&H should only be if you ordered individual issues, from what 
I can tell from their web site\'s order form.  The JTAS subscription is 
*\'d, which indicates that the item doesn\'t require a shipping charge.  
The individual issues do not appear to be *\'d, so they probably do 
require a shipping charge.

Hopefully IG can shed some light on this.

Especially since we were PROMISED updates every two weeks.  Well, it\'s been
19 days now!  And don\'t tell me they don\'t have anything to update.  ONe
month ago, I recieved a reply from IG saying they would put my site on their

Since the crew saw the enemy destroyed, they failed to fire the tachyon gun. The paradox 
caused a backlash in reality (which really hates a smart ass)
Their ship is a casuality by causality.

        That :) should be a :(.  I\'m majorly bummed out over Sagan dying.
Despite his silly little tiff with Apple a while back, I have an enormous
amount of respect for his writing abilities and his work in popularizing
astronomy and the scientific viewpoint.  I greatly enjoyed everything of
his that I\'ve ever read, and am saddened by his passing.

The best sources for current theories and information on asteroids are the
books Asteroids and Asteroids II editted by Tom Gehrels, et al and
published by the University of Arizona Press. I think the first one is out
of print, but the second one contains the most up to date information. The
books are collections of papers presented at conferences. (There is also a
more recent book in the series from a conference on the hazards to the
Earth from comets and asteroids if anyone is still interested in dropping
rocks!) My copies are at the office, I can send more detailled information
to anyone interested.

The most accepted theory currently is that the asteroids formed as multiple
small planetoids that were large enough to have some internal thermal
processing. Collisions have broken most of the planetoids into smaller
pieces (our present asteroids), but the larger asteroids like Ceres and
Pallas may be the last of the original planetoids.

    'body' => '        While I haven\'t got the CSC yet and so cannot comment on the final
version, something that had occurred to me was that perhaps the VDS ought
to take account of quality and design differences at different tech levels,
and reflect this in its pricing.  Obviously, a Honda Accord and a Yugo are
both TL-7 or so vehicles... however, one outperforms the other, and a
Porsche will blow the doors off both of them but costs far more.

        How about allowing an increase of up to 15% in either mass, output,
or volume in any system at any tech level, at the cost of increasing the
price at a gradually increasing rate; say 1% more expensive for a 1%
improvement, 2% for 2%, 5% for 3%, 9% for 4%, 14% for 5%, 20% for 6%, 27%
for 7%, 35% for 8%, 44% for 9%, 54% for 10%, 65% for 11%, 77% for 12%, 90%
for 13%, 104% for 14%, and 119% for 15%.  Thus, a power plant that had 15%
more output would cost (base price +119%) more than the base model, and one
that had 15% less mass, 15% more output, and 15% less volume would cost
(base price +357%) of the base model for that TL.  Repeat this increase in
price on chassis and propulsion, and you\'d get a significant increase in
performance at a massive increase in price...

        Going the other way, for the Yugo end of the scale, you could cut
price by, say 0.5% for every 1% degradation in performance; thus, for a
power plant that was 15% bulkier, 15% more massive, and had 15% less output
than the base model, the cost would drop by 22.5%...  Repeat this for
chassis and propulsion, and you\'d get a vehicle 67.5% less expensive than
the base model. Let\'s assign the following values using the S.W.A.G
Method*:


Vehicle: Volume:   Mass:     Output:   Accel.:  Top speed:   Cost:

Honda    100%      2.50 T    0.50 Mw   0.44 G   600 m/turn   20 Kcr

Yugo     115%      3.62 T    0.43 Mw   0.34 G   356 m/turn   6.5 Kcr

Porsche  90%       2.12 T    0.65 Mw   0.55 G   920 m/turn   234 Kcr


        First, the prices seem to be about right, and if my guesses as to
mass and output had been less off the top of my head I suspect that
performance would have been more in line with reality too.

        Second, the  beta system is gravely, gravely, and annoyingly broken
in that it does not take aerodynamics into account; there\'s no way that a
stock Honda Accord can do 360 km/h in an atmosphere (without JATO units,
that is :>), and a Yugo certainly won\'t do 213 km/h without being dropped
from a great height.  Anybody have numbers for how air resistance affects
speed, and how the system could be fixed to deal with it?

        Comments?

Dear Joe,

We are in the process of updating the website and starting a program to 
ensure that in 1997 the page will be continuosly updated and managed on 
a daily basis.  Please let the fans know that we have great plans and 
that the page will be under construction for the rest of December, and 
that there will be a lot of good changes in the beginning of the year.  

Could you also please let the fans know that the office will be closed 
until the 31st.  So, if they send E-mails please ask them not to get 
disappointed when we don\'t answer immediately.  We will answer these upon 
our return. The same goes for phone calls.  I encourage them to leave

None of the complaints about this supplement I have seen have mentioned 
its main problem.  The ships are_unnamed_!  It is true that the designs 
& art are nor that good but the primary way most players will interact 
with large Naval ships is to stay out of their way, obey their orders, 
or Jump out before they are destroyed.  Which scenario sound better to 
you?   "A 10,000 ton cruiser orders you to stand to & prepare to be 
boarded."  OR "The Lukasan LC-1052, a 10,000 ton Sarmonocci Class light 
cruiser orders you to stand by & prepare to be boarded."

as well as complete stats on crew & important passengers

The Trail of the Sky Raiders adventure -
 deck plans (no stats) for a five thousand year old, 500 ton, non jump 
capable, about TL 9, raiding ship of a minor human race.

Fate of the Sky Raiders -
This adventure takes place on a 5,00 year old giant sub light generation 
ship about 10km x 8km x 7.5 km (about 50 billion displacement tons) 
includes parial maps of this ship.
 
It also contains deck plans (no stats) on Jump capable scout ships in 
its docking bay.

High passage magazine Issue #1 -

The Solar Flare- Has a map (no stats) & an adventure set on board the  
abandoned merchant ship.

Star Dart Fighter-
Diagram & High Guard stats for the fighter, a TL 14 fighter formerly 
(starting in 992) used on Azhanti High Lightning class cruisers (before 
the RF-128 Ramparts used now) still used in training squads & on 
backwater worlds, includes 45 variants (without seperate stats).

Tral Wolf class Intelligence Cruisers -
Deck Plans, Book 2 stats, complete listing of all ships in the class & 
their current status.  This 800 ton TL 15, Armor 9, Jump 3 ship fills a 
very usefull role in a campaign.  These ships are run by the Ministry of 
Justice Special Branch.

High Passage #2 - I dont have it

High Passage #3 -

Star Class Armored Merchant -
Deck Plans, High Guard stats, & more for a 300 ton TL 15 Jump 3 armed & 
armored merchant ship.  This is a very nice & well designed ship.

Manta Class Escort Fighter - 
Drawing & information on a TL 15 10 ton light fighter.

High Passage #4 - A_very_good issue for starship designs.

Type SA Interdiction satellite -
This contains maps & High Guard stats for the interdiction satellites 
used to try & keep people (ie players) of of interdicted worlds.  This 
is an unmaned robotic 200 ton TL 15 automated warning satellite.  It has 
a model 7 computer & 2 triple turrets armed w/ nuclear missiles...They 
are_not_kidding when they say they want you to go away.

cruiser with a factor N meson gun spinal mount.  Intended for use on 
independent missions on the frontier or as the flagship for small 
squadrons, it can usually outrun anything it cannot outfight.  This is a 
very nice ship & if used properly can stop the players 
from_always_encountering Azhanti High Lighting Class Cruisers.

High Passage #5 - a very good issue -

Fortune Class Merchant -
Deck plans & High Guard stats for a 600 ton, TL 12, Jump 3 ship designed

were provided in issue #4)

14 System Defense Boats - as above

	This article does not cover the Deck plans Fasa did for 2 basic 
reasons, I do not have most of them & it should be obvios that they 
provide Deck Plans & stats (often High Guard) for the ships.

	I do not have any extra copies of any of these items, I do not 
know where to get them nor do I have any intention of posting the 
complete information for any of these ships for reasons of bandwidth, 
copyright reasons, & my time.  Instead this article is intended to let 
you know what FASA did so you can decide if you want to get them for 
yourself.  As the whim strikes me & I feel like typing I may provide 
similar information for ships from other licensees.

Subject: RE: JTAS cost

Joe,

Unfortunately, this is a problem we inherited from the previous 
management.  They neglected to mark on the website that there would be a 
shipping and handling charge of $1.95/issue for JTAS subscriptions or 
single issues.  I do realize that it is our fault for not informing 
everyone of the shipping charges sooner, and I apologize for that.  We 
are hoping that the fans will stand with us on this as we cannot afford to 
ship these issues without passing that cost on to our customers.

Unfortunately, there is a very small profit margin on the magazine until 
an advertising base is established.  At this point, the advertising base 
is virtually nonexistant, since it is a new magazine that caters to a 
niche market.  However, I nonetheless approved publishing the first 
issue this month, at a substantial loss, because I didn\'t want to 
disappoint the fans.  A letter will be included with that issue 
informing everyone of the shipping charges that have been added.  Please 
relay my remorse over this situation.  I wish it had been otherwise, but 
we have attempted to deal with this as best we could under the circumstances.

On a related note, all of the books are now being shipped via USPS Priority 
Mail, and they are being packaged in bubble envelopes.  I apologize for 
the shipping methods and packaging used for previous shipments.  We want 
every customer to have the best possible experience when making 
purchases of our products, and we\'re continuing to work toward 
improvements in all aspects of our business.

By the way, all of these issues will be addressed on the website after 
it\'s updated.

by Imperium Games (the other being Aliens Archive).  CSC was designed and 
written by Greg Porter (of "Guns, Guns, Guns" and "Macho Women with Guns" 
fame).

When this supplement is first opened, the reader is greeted with the 
now-familiar Imperium Games title page, with several highlights of the 
work given, along with page number of where to find the relevant 
portions.  The next page has the standard IG credits page (including a 
well-deserved mention to the folks from GDW-Beta who helped with the 
design and playtest of the Vehicle Design rules), and biographical 
information about the author.  Following that is a spartan but effective 
Table of Contents.  Page four is a mood-setting introduction to the 
work.  So far, standard stuff for IG\'s supplements.

What isn\'t standard - not even for role-playing supplements from _any_ 
company - is what follows those opening pages.  Greg has done a wonderful 
job.  He has included all the useful equipment you would expect, and all 
of it is well-designed and the entries are complete.  "But wait, there\'s 
more!" as they say in the TV commercials. :)

Greg has included a lot of extras in this book.  And the extras make all 
the difference.  Things like rules for survival in extreme conditions 
(cold weather, hot weather, exotic atmospheres, vacuum), useful 
rules-of-thumb (such as for the game effects of tool use at various tech 
levels), additions to T4\'s systems (vehicle combat, trade & commerce, 
using locks), a method for designing non-self-aware robots with the 
included Vehicle Design Rules, as well as how to use those same  Vehicle 
Design Rules to design armor!

There are also extras among the variety of equipment he chose.  The 
"Amaze the Natives" kit is great!  There are neat, new technologies like 
Plascrete and the Flashtray.  And he uses humor - sparingly - to good 
effect, as in the entry for "Sleeping Bag."  

This is an excellent, excellent volume.  The only quibble I have is that 
the editing was, while not at the level of T4 itself, less than perfect.  
IG is still in need of higher-quality editing.

Overall, I give this book a 92% (revised down from my initial score of 
95%, due to spotting additional, minor editing errors).  I highly 
recommend it - it will become one of the most-used volumes in your T4 
collection.

I can\'t wait for Emperor\'s Arsenal (which will also be by Greg Porter)!

    Personally I\'d like to see some more support material for the GM in terms
of worlds and the like.  I\'ve been playing Traveller since the original three
little black books came out and Book 4 Mercenary was a wild eyed new product.
So I\'ve got DGP World Builders Handbook and all the other stuff for a GM
designing a world or Star System.  But T4 is intended for a new audience, and
that new audience doesn\'t have access to any of that.  They need it and the
GM\'s need it now.  An example from the T4 world gen portion, look at the Tech
Level table description.  Arguably one of the most important points of
Traveller.  All that it gives you is some vague century and decade equivalent
to Terran History and no other explainations but that. :(
    If T4 is for a new generation of Players, and it truely is, then IG needs
to start supporting that new generations of GMs as well. ;)

Mmmmm.... yes to the weaponry, of course, but a hull of a given size only
needs a jump drive of a fixed size, regardless of the intended use of the
ship. A lot of the other components you mention here are also strictly
size-related, although military vessels will typically have more
capabilities than other vessels.

Um, I have to disagree with you on this point. Yes, it\'s true that thre will
be bottlenecks in production. Yes, there are some things that *have* to be
completed before other things can be built... for example, you can\'t install
grav plates in the floors until there are floors present, after all.
Still... there are a lot of components that *aren\'t* related. Why should the
maneuver drive be a factor in installing the laser turrets? The ship won\'t
be *complete* until all subsystems are done, true... but work can be routed
around shortages, usually. That\'s a job for the yard managers.

This is where *planning* on the part of the yard management would come into
play. When they take the order for ship construction, they\'ll have a
flowchart showing what tasks need to be done, and in what order, and which
ones will affect others. If there\'s a holdup on one area, then you divert
effort into another area. Instead of running connections to that laser
turret, the electronics section works on the sensor runs or wires control
panels for a few days, until the turret *does* come in. They won\'t just drop
their tools and drink coffee until it gets there.

Um... how does this follow? I\'d grant it, if it said "the more special
equipment you need", rather than "bigger and more expensive". Cost alone
doesn\'t reflect that.

In my opinion, you\'re overestimating the strain that ship construction would
put on the industrial output of the world. That industrial output is where
the construction numbers come from, anyway. The system you\'re describing for
speeding up the construction times is the one detailed in TCS, where every
10% extra you spend on construction gets an extra 10% work done for that
week. The TCS rules also allow for speeded-up consruction by doubling the
yard space allocated to a particular vessel (+40%), with a bonus for
familiarity of the design, too.

I\'ve said before, though, and I\'ll say again... there ought to be *some*
sort of break for ships more simply designed. TCS didn\'t cover it, because
it was a military-oriented supplement, but in my game, I\'d be willing to
give a "civilian ship" an extra 40% bonus on construction time, as a
top-of-the-head number. The only flaw there is that it would fiddle with the
total cost, and I\'d want to avoid that.

<grin> Quite true... but remember, the Navy *is* the principal service.
Also, that TCS number just gives the budget... annual maintenance of 10%
listed cost has to come out of that. You\'re not going to be able to spend it
all on new construction unless you\'ve just lost your entire fleet... perhaps
to an idiot Emperor who snarfs it up for duty somewhere else. As someone
else pointed out, in a sustained situation, only a very small percentage of
the budget goes toward new construction.

I don\'t know about syenites, but both granites and gneisses are
*igneous* rocks. But the grains of monazite will be pretty scattered.
That\'s why the sources are deposits where weathering has concentrated
the grains.

Check my posts a few months back for ideas on how asteroids form and
what sort of compositions they have.

The short answer is that you won\'t find such deposits on asteroids. The
long answer is that since mining asteroids is going to amount to
passing the whole thing thru a smelter, it not that much extra effort
to seperate out the "trace" amounts of things. After all, if you are
processing cubic kilometers of "rock" or "nickel-iron", a one part per
*billion* impurity is going to amount to a cubic meter of material
(going by volume). Going by mass it\'s even more favorable. A km^3 of
"rock" masses about 2-4 billion tonnes. For nickel iron it\'s closer to
8 billion tonnes.

Now consider that things like lanthanum are more likely to be parts per
*million* or higher, and you begin to see why it\'s worth the trouble.

A semi-local company (Teledyne Wah Chang) produces various rare earth
and exotic metals. They have some rather *large* waste ponds where the
"leftovers" from processing are allowed to settle out. 

This led to a real mess about 10 years back. Due to the presence of
things like Th (thorium) and the like in the waste, the waste is
somewhat more radioactive than normal rock. This makes sense, as if you
take out all the common, and generally *non*-radioactive components of
a material, what\'s left will be "enriched" in the radioactive ones.

Anyway, the waste (basicly sand with a weird elemental makeup) is
*just* radioactive enough to count as low level waste *if* you try to
apply the standards for nuclear waste to waste from ordinary industry.

Some groups didn\'t like the company because it makes things like
compnents used in nuclear reactors (and weapons). So they got a law
passed forcing the company to move the waste by making them, and them
only, subject to the tighter rules used in the nuclear industry....
<sigh>

Anyway, a lanthanum *mine* won\'t look like much other than a deredging
operation or a sand and gravel pit. The place where they ship the sand
to be processed will be more interesting.

"probably shipped free by Imperial ships" ... er, you *do* have T4? The
rulebook where it states quite plainly and specifically that "Everything is
Driven by Economics" (pg. 7). I would have thought that that makes it quite
plain that is, to put it bluntly, "no such thing as a free lunch" ... nope,
no "Imperial ships" ship one damn ounce of cargo for free. Certainly not on
the scale that we are talking about! Sorry, you have no argument on *this*
basis ... perhaps on others (but you have to come up with them).

And, consider this, the A/B Starport not only has to have the spares, it
has to have the diagnostic equipment and, unless the future is quite
different from the present, the replaced electronics modules (and even the
mechanical ones) will be refurbished ... just like the "new" gearbox you
get in your car when the old one "dies" ... its rarely "new", its rebuilt
with the few actual dud parts replaced. Even military aircraft avionic
modules are replaced on the spot, but then *repaired* for reissue later.
Since *everything is driven by economics* this *will* be done in Traveller,
and it will be cheapest to do it on the spot!

Why? Why not ship to some central depot? Well, think about it. You have all
that high tech equipment sitting there and (undoubtedly) not being used
100% of the time, and, just as importantly, you have all that high-tech
trained personnel sitting there who have to be paid regardless. So, to
minimise waste (economics drives everything, remember), you have them
repairing modules in their otherwise wasted "downtime".

And all those staff don\'t want to live at the local TL, so you have a built
in market for high tech goods - and its easiest to ship them in something
approaching bulk (to make a buck - remember, *everything* is driven by
economics) and make "volume" sales to the natives. Also, the starport will
have all these high tech services that it will be able to provide to the
locals for a good price - after all, for example, they *have* to have a
sophisticated computer network to run the Port, so why not defray operating
costs by time-sharing the computer capacity with the locals. This means
that there is a market for imported high-tech standalone computers etc.

Ditto power, you have these Fusion/Fusion Plus generators which probably
don\'t operate at full load anywhere near all the time, so you sell power to
the locals at prices that undercut their fossil fuel plants (or even make
it unattractive to build such plants if they have not yet developed them)
... and this means that you want them to have goodies that use that power.
So you sell them those as well. In fact, I would guess that a installing a
larger than needed Fusion plant would be a nice little revenue earner
through selling the power to the low-tech (relatively) locals. And that\'s
without even considering environmental factors

Sorry. Your argument won\'t stand. Doesn\'t even come close.

Are you sure about this?  When I subscribed to JTAS I specifically asked
for this since I didn\'t want to pay additional shipping charges to Germany
and they told me, that shipping *was* included in the subscription price.
Now I know that almost everything they said at that time was rubbish, but
I hope that *this* is a misunderstanding.

This sounds wonderful.  Finally someone from IG is remembering that we new

Don\'t take this personally, but your ratings seem to be too high in
general (at least the ratings for the rulebook and Starships in one of
your previous postings were not very real).

Ok, (remembering Ken Whitman :-), I\'ll stay as calm and friendly as
possible.  They not only neglected to mention this on the website but they
also neglected to mention this when I *specifically* asked them before
subscribing (sadly I really don\'t remember the name of the IG employee...
since I emailed them from my AOL account I wonder if there is any way to
get access to old email... does AOL backup them somewhere?).  They
*explicitly* told me that *no* additional charges where involved
(otherwise I wouldn\'t hav subscribed since now about as costly as directly
buying it over here in Germany >:-( ).

I really wish that Courtney would talk to the IG crew about this and maybe
he could slap them a little bit :-(  Now that I just have calmed down

I guess I\'ll cancel my JTAS subscription.  Enough\'s enough.

I only feel sorry for Courtney who now probably will have to suffer from
some more unfriendly comments from angry customers.

With all due respect, I think they need the campaign background for 
M0 first.  OTOH, I do agree that a world detailing book akin to WBH, 
WTH, or Grand Survey/Grand Census would be a good thing.  Believe it 
or not though, I GM\'d for 10+ years without any of the above though, 
so it is quite possible to detail worlds without them.

It\'s a 96-page supplement.  Take out 3 pages for advertisements though.

According to an email I received last night from Courtney, IG is 
currently in discussion with CORE to produce adventures which IG would 
then publish.  That is, CORE would take on the same function as AP&D, 
except it would be with regard to adventures rather than rulebooks.

"The Long Way Home" is included in these discussions, as well as future 
adventure products, of course.

Let\'s hope the talks go well. :)

Definitely! That\'d make what appear, from all accounts to be excellent
supplements on the part of CORE more easily available to us in North America.

Joe, does this mean though, that AP&D will NOT be producing adventures?  Or,
that their main function will be rulebooks?

This book is total garbage.  96 pages, and not a single color plate!  
It\'s almost completely text!  Like I have time to read!  I didn\'t get 
into role-playing to spend my day reading like some misanthropic geek.  
Every book should be patterned after the first half of _Starships_: lots 
of pictures, little text.

Although Mr. Porter pompously calls the last part of the book the 
"Vehicle Design System," the system presented is incapable of designing 
starships!  Hello?!?  Starships are vehicles, too!!  I think Greg 
Porter had better take a remedial English class.

For that matter, what about the title to the book?  "Central Supply 
Catalog."  Central to what?  The items detailed have almost no usefulness 
for my campaign (which I have cleverly centered on my novel-in-progress, 
"Smurfs in Space" - available at fine booksellers real soon now!).  The 
supplies listed are very poorly chosen.  How many times are you going to 
need a vac suit in space, anyway? Everyone knows space is filled with 
ether, which is just as breathable as oxygen!  Yet Mr. Porter spends two 
pages on vac suits of various designs.  And as for being a catalog - 
where are the models?  Every catalog I receive in the mail has really 
foxy models wearing the various pieces of clothing.  Mr. Porter could 
take some lessons from the _Victoria\'s Secret_ people!

Needless to say, I\'m extremely disappointed with this volume.  I wouldn\'t 
recommend it to my worst enemy.  Two thumbs down.

I have no idea.  I imagine that sort of thing will be worked out among 
the various parties involved.

Joe,

I ordered a single issue of JTAS, I paid at that time the S&H for the
hardcover and JTAS. I paid by check, and I will not pay anymore for shipping
or handling. If they made of mistake, then they pay for it, not me. If my
not paying or THEIR mistake causes IG or JTAS to go under, so be it!!! Being
a fan does not meant chump or sucker. Please if you would forward me
Courtney\'s email and/or phone number and I will enlighten her as to the
disposition of my order for JTAS, I will also inform her of the US Postal
regulation regarding mail order, yes I ordered and paid vis US Mail,
regarding FRAUD.

Thank you for atleast keeping us informed Joe.

Sam,

The telephone and email address information is on IG\'s web site, at the 
bottom of the main page.  But, anyway, email is at sweetpea10@msn.com and 
their phone number is 1-310-275-9934.

However, note what was said in the previous email: they\'re out of the 
office until January 2, so take that into account when attempting to 
communicate with them.

Sam,

On re-reading your note, I don\'t see the reason for your being upset.  
You paid by check - how are they going to charge you more?  Do they have 
your credit card number?  And you say you have already paid for shipping 
of the JTAS issue.  I just don\'t see what the issue is with your 
particular order.   I must be missing something, though.

Since the folks at IG are unavailable for comment until the 2nd, I\'m 
trying to figure out what the latest announcement means.

From looking at IG\'s web site, it looks like they are indicating there 
would be a shipping charge on orders for individual issues - can anyone 
who ordered a single issue and paid by check, cash, or money order confirm 
that they were charged for shipping on that issue?  If so, how much were 
you charged?

IG\'s web site does clearly indicate, on the other hand, that those who 
ordered a subscription will not be charged for shipping.  At this point, 
that is the scenario Courtney\'s message seems to be talking about; it 
doesn\'t seem to be a change in policy on orders for individual issues.

that the Vilani lost the Interstellar Wars to the Terrans because the
Terrans outproduced them ... which I\'m not (you\'ll all heave a sigh of
relief) going to rehash. But it just occurred to me that there is a more
fundamental (possible) reason for their loss - one which doesn\'t need the
so-called "explanation" of the Plague of Duskir (which most everyone agrees
happened *after* the Vilani collapse anyway).

What is it? Well, it\'s simple, its based on the assumption that the Third
Imperium is really an almost pure Vilani construct in a social sense (and
this seems to be undoubtedly the case) and that this indicates that the
conquering Terrans of the Interstellar wars were actually absorbed and
neutralised by their attempts to dominate and control the remnants of the
Grand Empire of the Stars (in other words, the Vilani did a China vs. the
Mongols sort of act). It\'s further based on the assumption that Marc
Miller\'s statement that *Economics drives Everything* in the T4 rulebook
is, quite literally, true, and was always true of the Vilani Empire.

Unh? You\'re no doubt "saying"! Well, consider this, it is my suggestion
that the Vilani Empire was always run as a business enterprise - which
makes sense given its organisation under the various Megacorps - and that
this had a direct effect on the way they expanded and, more importantly,
the way they fought their wars and organised all branches of their
military.

My suggestion is that the Vilani Military was run as a commercial operation
and that the wars that they fought were run according to strict economic
principles ... profit was the bottom line. Just think, for example, how
this would affect their ship design philosophy for warships!

The Terrans, on the other hand, coming from a more voracious (and only in a
sense) militaristic culture saw the Interstellar Wars *not* as an economic
conflict (though they recognised that it was that as well) primarily, but
as a war of survival! The Terrans therefore were building ship types,
undertaking military operations and utilising tactics that the mercantile
oriented Vilani military and government leaders could not make any sense
of. Thus, the Vilani were always (or for a long time) on the "back foot",
so to speak. This is, of course, supported by the classic pre-Traveller
boardgame from GDW, "Imperium", where the Vilani Governor has to appeal to
the emperor for extra finances and support for his "border action" against
those pesky terrans!

By the time the Vilani gained a real inkling of what on "earth" was
*actually* happening, they were (given the glacial slowness with which they
were able to undertake fundamental change in any aspect of their society)
unable to do anything effective about it in time (the size of their empire
and the consultative processes needed to "prove" the case to their ruling
class would have eaten up much of what time they had anyway!).

So, ultimately, the Vilani lost because they completely misunderstood what
the war was about *for the Terrans*.

While this idea hadn\'t actually hit me when I wrote it, you\'ll note that
the way that the Dark Star #1 article on "Vilani Noble Ranks" and the DS#2
article on "Vilani Military Ranks" actually supports this ... quite
unintentionally, of course :-}

Any comments?

      As far as I know the $11.20 cost was for a year\'s sub. From what I
understand Leroy Guatney recieved a statement with that chaarge on it, when
he asked Marc who to contact, I believe Marc told him Courtney (or whomever),
that person stated that since IG doesn\'t have a 100,000 subscibers they\'d
have to charge extra for S&H.
      If you want I can forward you the original letter (as can any other

      I can\'t say I\'m happy about this myself between being charge
essentially 8 months before I even get the first issue, and than on top of
that being charged secretly another $11.20 because they decided they fudged
up. Obviously someone didn\'t have any idea of what they were doing, and we\'re
having to pay for it (and obviously someone still doesn\'t know what they

I noticed a charge appear on my debit card (from my checking account) and
checked with my bank to find out what was going on. They said it was Imperium
Games for $11.70, and was transacted on Dec. 12th. Marc kindly gave me a
 contact at IG and she told me that it was the billing of the shipping
charges for my JTAS subscription

She went on to explain that the JTAS is not a mainstream magazine with
100,000 subs so they couldn\'t afford to pay the shipping/handling charges out
of the sub price. I told her I would pass along the info to a mailing list I
was on
and she thanked me for that.

It strikes me as a little strange that IG would do business this way,
especially now that they have my debit card number. But, having thought about
it, I guess I have little choice in the matter, since I want a subscription
for at least the first issues. Oh well.

The good news is that JTAS will be out the first week of January.

Thanks for the info (including the letter from the HIWG list). 

I hope that, after all this, JTAS #25 exceeds our expectations.

The way the game designers are doing it, the aliens will be detailed in the 
milieux in which they take on importance.  Vargr will probably be in M0, 
Aslan in 200 (Aslan Border Wars), etc.  Similarly, equipment will be 
given for each milieu as they are produced.

I\'ve always been under the impression that the T4 rulebook would be

I think that\'s because this the TL limitation of M0.

A very interesting thesis, this "different sort of war" theory. But
undoubtably right. Thanks for the insights!

I question your use of the word "absorbed" when refering to Terrans,
tho; I think it\'s too strong. I think that the Terrans (a tiny minority
of all humans) had a huge influence on the ideas, fashions, and
language of the governed majority. While the Mongols:Chinese analogy
has a lot of applicability here, I would also consider the even more
applicable Normans:Saxons model, and, even better, the Spanish:Aztecs
analogy.

Just a humble assertion submitted for your consideration.

"...burning bright, in the forest of the night." - Of course, I always
mentally finish it with "I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish
tonight." <g>

About _The Stars, My Destination_, I\'ve never seen it in short story
form...as was mentioned in an earlier post, but only as a short novel. 
Thinking back, I can see where it could have been a short story that was
expanded though.

Ok, I\'ll buy that.  It fits with how I see the Vilani running their empire. 
OTOH, what the Vilani see as "economic principles" aren\'t likely to be
"western free-market economic principles."  To a Vilani, it\'s more
important to do things the *right* way than to do things a better way.
Profit is the result of following the rules, not breaking them.  I see them
very class (even caste) oriented, very traditional, very slow to accept
*any* change.  They are like a deep still lake.

The Terrans were innovative, aggressive, change-oriented.  They were like a
sharp sword slicing through the still water of the Vilani.

The Terrans sliced and flailed and thrashed at the water rolling and
stirring it up, but had no lasting effect.  Eventually the Terrans wore
themselves out and...

...the Vilani eventually won the war!  Now, didn\'t they *really* win?  

Ok, it took over 2000 years, but in the end it\'s still the Vilani who
dominate the 3rd Imperium, isn\'t it?  It\'s the Vilani\'s Imperium that
eventually invade and occupies Earth, isn\'t it?  <g>

The way I see it, the Vilani had never run into a group like the Terrans
before.  They had always been the ones with the newest technology, the most
powerful navy, the strongest economy, and the will to dominate.  They
didn\'t understand them, and they couldn\'t beat them in a stand up war, but
they could absorb them...and they did.

The Terrans made a splash in the pond, so to speak, and succeeded in
collapsing the 10,000 world 2nd Imperium into a splintered mess.  They
didn\'t succeed in maintaining their control.  The Long Night was when the
Vilani absorbed the Terrans, spreading them out so much as to effectively
neutralize them.  The Vilani nobility and merchant class (caste) slowly and
patiently rebuilt their power until they were able to resurrect *their*
Imperium.

My opinion?  Well, maybe. It would be a good story wouldn\'t it? <g>

I don\'t think it was a Vilani plan.  I just think this is the way their
culture works:  methodical, traditional, smothering.

"If you can\'t say something nice, don\'t say anything.", is a good policy
generally, but this is too much!

I paid $30, by check, for a one year subscription to JTAS.  That was
supposed to be 8 issues, $3.75/issue.  I made that purchase in good faith,
and IG cashed my check.  Now they want an additional $11.20?

I\'ve got a serious problem with this!

Following their logic, what\'s to stop them from deciding that T4 and
Starships were underpriced by...oh say $10...and billing us for it? The
fact we\'d never pay, you think? 

Isn\'t that exactly what they are doing here...raising the price of a
product *after* accepting payment?

So, what now?  Do they send me JTAS AND a bill?  Do they hold my copy of
JTAS 25 and *just* send the bill?  Do they try to pro-rate my account
sending me, let\'s say, 5 issues rather than the 8 I purchased?  Do they
just keep my $30 and not send me anything?

What about all the people that paid by credit card?  Will you find an
additional, and unauthorized, charge on your December card statement for
$11.20?

Folks, this is *bad* business!

I wasn\'t privy to the discussion but JTAS #5 has an article on "Special
Psionic Powers" which includes a power called *Jaunting*. It\'s described
as "The ability to teleport interstellar distances under limited
conditions." Although it has some built-in limitations, given the ease
with which the Zhodani Aliens supplement allowed characters with 
a Psi of 10+, this is one ability I steered far away from due to the
unbalancing effects it would have on any campaign.

Probably because:

1) They\'ve already been done in previous editions,
while minor races have suffered from neglect;

2) They\'ll have more room for the majors in later
Aliens books that will focus mainly on one or two;

3) No major races are near Sylea, so they\'re
not as important in a Year 0 campaign as the
minor races of the Imperial core.

Sound about right?

True. But the very fact that the bottlenecks exist at all (even if planned
for in advance) will have an overall effect of limiting the manpower you
can effectively use in the shipyard, and stretching the construction time.

On the contrary. Subcontracting permits you to effectively employ more
workers who are already organized to do the work you want done, thus
shortening the construction time from what it would be if you had to build
the laser in place.

Components are expensive principally because a lot of men, materials, and
capital have to go into finding or making them. Yes, it\'s a crude measure,
but is an average price per ton for starships is arguably worse.

<grin> And basing construction rates (not necessarily times) on cost moves
you in the right direction and roughly the right amount. "What\'s required"
is extra industrial capacity, which is roughly measured by the cost of the
ship.

Thicker armor on the same size ship requires more material. A jump-3 takes
more drive machinery and costs more than jump-1 for the same size ship.
(Otherwise, why  doesn\'t everyone use jump-3?). Same with the maneuver
drive. All the extra power eaters in a military vessel require a bigger
power plant than a cargo ship the same size needs.

Alright, the more heavy or special equipment you need, the more likely it
is that it, or something needed to provide it, will be in short supply.
<grin>. I\'d say most of the "extras" you trade merchant cargo or passenger
space for are either heavy or special.

Gee.. *something* about TCS actually makes economic sense! <grin>. I 
could just replace your doubled tons of yard space with MCr and get a 50%
reduction in the time to build a ship. I don\'t fiddle with ship costs
either: but construction times are quite flexible. 
If there is indeed little difference in cost per ton between civilian and
military ships, then there is not that much difference in the systems. If
there is, then basing construction rates on tonnage alone is ludicrous.
By analogy and as an extreme example, assuming that a diesel engine and a
boxcar are similar size (tonnage): should you be able to build them at
anywhere near similar rates? I don\'t think so. What about tanker trucks vs
battle tanks? I\'d say that, other things being equal, the trucks get built
faster even if they are bigger. The same economics apply to starships.

If MT\'s military reasoning is flawed, then should TCS\'s economics be
sacrosant? I don\'t see why.

I decided that I wanted to read "The Demolished Man". And was *very*
unhappy to discover that it is not in stock at any of the bookstores I
checked. I haven\'t had a chance to see if it\'s still in print, but
given that I\'ve seen ads for a (too expensive) "special edition" of
both it and "The Stars My Destination", I rather suspect that it *is*
out of print, at least as a normal paperback. <sigh>

Actually, having spent a year in the bush in Nigeria (possibly one of the
most Travelleresque years of my life - it was so *alien*), I would tend to
disagree.  \'Stuff\' wasn\'t available nor widely.  Unless of course you went
to a *major* town/city, say Lagos.  Even in Jos (the nearest town to me -
40 miles away, 6 of them by dirt track, fording rivers etc.), \'Stuff\' was
hard to get hold of.

However, I quite agree that it is the local income that then restricts what
can be owned.  For example, I clearly remember (it was a birthday treat!)
buying a pack of 10 processed cheese slices (foul but after bread and gubsa
anything would have done!), for the local equivalent of ten pounds (and
this was 15 years back), that would be what, nearly $20?  IIRC I could only
buy it in the one shop "Onigbinde\'s" in Jos (not that small a \'town\' with a
population of 140,000) that stocked it.  (And had the \'fridge with
emergency backup generator to make keeping it a possibility.)

I can just imagine Traveller tracking down the one shop in the \'backwoods\'
starport that might sell what they want, only to find that a substitute
(that isn\'t really what they want) is not available because local power\'s
gone out and the item (food or whatever) has spoiled.

As I\'ve entirely forgotten now what point it was I responding to, I\'ll shut
up and say \'Merry Christmas\'

          You\'re absolutely right.  It does indeed say that.  I just checked to
          make sure you weren\'t \'hyping\' the quote or anything.

          But I can\'t help wonder if you aren\'t taking it a *bit* too literally.
            In a kind of \'rivet counting\' sense.

          It would be equally easy to write about the UK, the US and Australia
          (no doubt) that *Everything is driven by economics*.  You\'d be
          absolutely right.

          And yet, and yet not *everything* is driven by economics.  While it
          makes good soundbite material and is true in limited sense, it is
          still true that there
          a heck of a lot of stuff that isn\'t driven by economics (even the
          \'broad\' definition of economics given in the Traveller rule book.
          There are still such
          things as love, peace and pursuit of happiness in the Traveller
          universe as I\'d like to think they\'re still kick around here.

          While this does not address your real argument about prices and so on,
           which I don\'t really have the expertise to discuss with you (I bow to
           your
          much deeper/longer thought on the subject!), I do think the rule book
          was being slightly hyper in its quote and MWM wouldn\'t really want to
          exclude the possibility of the occasional \'free lunch\' *somewhere* in
          a large universe.

start with "The Long Way Home" from BITS/CORE and continue with other

Not necessarily. After all, a great deal of that will be taken up, as you

Yup, spendng more money on it *does* get it out of the yards faster... but
more efficient scheduling will also get it out the door faster, too, as will
simply assigning more workers.

My comment above about "fiddling with the cost" was meant to reflect on the
fact that, if you get 1.8 weeks worth of  work done in each week, while only
*paying* for 1.0 weeks worth, you\'re getting a big price break... your total
price paid drops to around 56% of list cost for the ship. *That* big a break
would bother me, as a referee.

I\'ll admit that you have a point, to an extent. The TCS rules are designed
with military craft in mind, not civilian. I agree that civilian craft
shouldn\'t take as long, but then you get into a whole spectrum of
problems... does my J3, 3G armed yacht bristling with lasers count as a
military vessel, or as a civilian one? Still, though, I don\'t see any way to
make the numbers work out for a cost-based system without some sort of
ruling about "number of applicable workers". I could live with it, I guess,
if that were done... but nothing has been mentioned that seems in any way
*objective*. Tonnage, at least, is easy to figure, and universally consistent.

I disagree. It just means you have to *plan* your construction, instead of
ordering a part to be delivered when you are ready to install it. The only
way it will limit you is if you don\'t do your homework in designing your
construction flowchart.

Um, true, but you\'re missing my point here. How do you come up with the
number of workers available, and how will this number be affected by
subcontractors? That "number of workers" is so vague that you\'re essentially
assigning construction rates by referee fiat.

OK, I\'m not totally clear on the differentiation you seem to be making here
between construction rates and times. FWIW, I also don\'t think the numbers
cited previously for cost-based construction (1-2 MCr per hundred workers
per month) are high enough, either.

I\'d like to clarify what I meant when I said "a yard gets familiar with
what\'s required". This means that the initial construction flowchart can be
reviewed afterwards, and optimized based on experience. If installing the
maneuver drive proved troublesome, then it might be made an earlier item, so
that you wouldn\'t have to dodge as many structural members to get it into
place. Also, the yard supervisor can look at the tasks that were completed
ahead of schedule, and allocate his worker-hours as required. This doesn\'t
have anything to do with extra industrial capacity, just more efficient
scheduling, and it also reflects the learning curve of the crews associated
with the project.

Hmmm... Well, Yes. I\'d say that on the whole, that would be a good
explanation from a Terran point of view. The Vilani may or may not
have seen it that way...

The Vilani were, above almost everything else, Empire Builders. You
don\'t build an empire like the _Empire of the Stars_ just to make a few
bucks. Certainly not in the short term. Even in the looong term,
which the Vilani have a better grasp on than the Terrans, it\'s a
questionable decision. In modern terms, imagine if the American
civil war had resulted in the North removing the right of self-government
from the South and imposing Northern laws, etc. Total annexation.
That\'s the First Imperium. It wasn\'t a happy, friendly economic
coalition, like the modern EC. Then again, the EC doesn\'t seem that 
happy.

The Vilani conquered more than the Terrans ever did. They must have had
some idea about how to wage war.

Yes, this does jive with your point and I agree, it does reflect the
Vilani concept of "government as business".

Hm, yes. Which isn\'t to say that the stress of assimilating (sp?) dozens
of new cultures into the Vilani over a thousand years wasn\'t creating
any stresses. I\'d say that I agree with you, but if it hadn\'t been
the Terrans, it would have been someone else. The Vilani had lost the
ability to deal with external threats in a useful manner, as there
wern\'t any left by the time the Terrans rolled around (well, except for
the Terrans).

You\'ve got \'em. The fall of the Vilani, like the fall of the Romans,
is difficult to attribute to any one single factor. barabrians,
lead in the pipes, an overextended empire, corrupt emperors, etc, etc, etc.

Although you\'d have to ask Tim Brown to get an answer, they aren\'t

The intention is to introduce the Major Races as the Imperium comes

My Take; 

Freshers are multifunction devices good for cleaning people, clothes,
dishes, etc. using sonic energy.  

When something or someone is placed into the fresher chamber and the door
is closed, the contents are \'vibrated\' at certain precise frequencies such
that the particles of dirt and dried skin (which makes up most of what we
wash away in the shower) are literally \'shaken loose\' and fall to the
floor (which is gridwork).

So at the end of the day, you take off that day\'s clothes and hang them in
the fresher for a few minutes before folding and putting them away, clean 
(which brings up the lack of storage space/dresser space in most deck
plans).  Additional accessories could probably remove wrinkles, soften the
fabric, and provide a pleasant scent.

The energy level used in sonic cleaning chambers is too low to harm
humans (or fine fabrics), but vargr and aslan can be debilitated by a
normal sonic shower at the wrong setting (the circuitry must be altered to
do this).  Humans can be injured and all races can be killed by a shower
with the power level boosted.

When using a fresher, the user experiences a soft tingling sensation.
Often a rough stone or brush is used to exfoliate the skin and remove
patches of dirt and grime.  This activity can be done clothed, but then
the dirt removed will settle in the clothing.

By the way, nothing, not even sonics, can get tomato sauce stains out of a
silk tie.   

Toilets, I believe, are basically unchanged from airplane chemical
toilets.  Although the chemicals are, undoubtedly, more efficient.  I
take pumping the storage tanks to be part of the biweekly maintanence
activity done at starports. (of course, you could always just dump it in
orbit, or the local state park equivalent.  Might get you in trouble
though).

Note that I am not a sonic engineer and this has a real loose basis in
science. 

Sonic showers are considered not the same as real water showers, and TAS
clubs and starports will often rent shower time to spacers passing
through.  The savings in space and weight of the water on board is usually
considered worth it.

Some luxury liners may have a water shower system on board.  These craft
will generally charge 2-3 times the normal high passage rate.

The text in CSC _seems_ to indicate that starship toilets route the 
wastes to some sort of holding area wherein micro-organisms break down 
the waste.  The discussion of "Glop" seems to further indicate that this 
waste is then fed into a reprocessor, and turned back into food that 
humans can consume.   

At least, that\'s how I read it.

I posted a message a while back in which I gave my figures for the
approximate cost of the Gram Mechanized Infantry battalion, using
prices from MegaTraveller, as portrayed in _Broadsword_.  The price
came out at MCr 530.8 for vehicles, personal armor, and weapons, 
but neglecting consumable supplies.  They\'re a tech-11 lift infantry
batallion, with 311 troops and 94 vehicles of various types.   We\'re
talking about paying for equipment for 26500 battalions of this type  
with this sum; that is equipment for eight million lift infantry and
their two and a half million vehicles.  

MCr 530.8 is a bit less than what you\'d pay for a 600-ton Vigilante
escort with a naval crew of ten.

However, we\'re neglecting infrastructure, expenditure of ammunition,
fuel, and rations, supply units, and the fact that other formations
may be more or less expensive.  However, you also have to keep in 
mind that these military units will be keeping all this equipment
around for a long time.  Back when I came up with these figures, to
keep them in sync with published figures in _Rebellion Sourcebook_,
WTH, and Wildstar\'s _Striker_ estimates, it looked like we needed a
forty year equipment replacement cycle.  (Staggered, of course, so
the average age of army equipment is twenty years, and primary units
get the new hardware, handing their old equipment down to secondary
units, and so on.)

"probably shipped free by Imperial ships" ... er, you *do* have T4? The
rulebook where it states quite plainly and specifically that "Everything is
Driven by Economics" (pg. 7). I would have thought that that makes it quite
plain that is, to put it bluntly, "no such thing as a free lunch" ... nope,
no "Imperial ships" ship one damn ounce of cargo for free. Certainly not on
the scale that we are talking about! Sorry, you have no argument on *this*
basis ... perhaps on others (but you have to come up with them). >>

If the individual worlds have to pay to import the parts, they\'re only going 
to order the stuff they *know* they can use, and they\'re going to want their 
money back. This means passing the cost onto the customers (the traders), who 
will in turn charge *their* customers more. In addition, ships that are 
\'non-standard\' (eg a TL or 2 above/below the norm) will have to have their 
parts ordered specially (or bring them with them), increasing the cost 
further. Merchants are going to be a lot more cautious about where they go - 
they don\'t want to break down somewhere where they can\'t get spares. This is 
all bad for trade, and therefore bad for the Imperium. Government subsidy (in 
the form of free shipping) removes all these problems (and gives worlds an 
added benefit to being in the Imperium).

"probably shipped free by Imperial ships" ... er, you *do* have T4? The
rulebook where it states quite plainly and specifically that "Everything is
Driven by Economics" (pg. 7). I would have thought that that makes it quite
plain that is, to put it bluntly, "no such thing as a free lunch" ... nope,
no "Imperial ships" ship one damn ounce of cargo for free. Certainly not on
the scale that we are talking about! Sorry, you have no argument on *this*
basis ... perhaps on others (but you have to come up with them). >>

If the individual worlds have to pay to import the parts, they\'re only going 
to order the stuff they *know* they can use, and they\'re going to want their 
money back. This means passing the cost onto the customers (the traders), who 
will in turn charge *their* customers more. In addition, ships that are 
\'non-standard\' (eg a TL or 2 above/below the norm) will have to have their 
parts ordered specially (or bring them with them), increasing the cost 
further. Merchants are going to be a lot more cautious about where they go - 
they don\'t want to break down somewhere where they can\'t get spares. This is 
all bad for trade, and therefore bad for the Imperium. Government subsidy (in 
the form of free shipping) removes all these problems (and gives worlds an 
added benefit to being in the Imperium).

Believe in it.  Central Supply Catalog is the best book written yet 
for T4.  In fact, it is probably the best list of equipment produced 
for any version of the game.  It\'d be worthwhile even without the 
vehicle design system.

Huh?  Although he was tactful about it, Joe RIPPED Starships.  
Remember that his review about T4 was posted pretty early on, before 
everybody began spotting all the bugs.  One doesn\'t have to be vehement to 
write a negative review, in fact it lends credibility to be calmer 
about it.

Nope, no majors.  OTOH, the minor races enclosed are great.  Tim did 
a good job with the book.  

Vargr will be enclosed in M0, others in subsequent Milieus, as 
appropriate.

Not to pick on you specifically, Harley, but isn\'t this thread 
getting a little tired?  If not, read on.  :-)

Yup, and there\'s never a dishwasher for those dishes, or do they 
serve everybody on those luxury liners with paper plates?   
and where do you keep a toothbrush, and come to think of it, where\'s 
a broom closet?  Where\'s the oven and the kitchen sink?  I\'ve never, 
ever seen those detailed in a deck plan.  Where\'s the comfy coach in 
the lounge?  Point is at some point you have to have some abstraction 
or you wind up with a very crowded unusable deck plan.

This would strike me as a good possibility, actually.  Hard to 
imagine where you\'d cram a laundry service into a scout/courier.  
OTOH, I would imagine that passenger liners and even free traders who 
cater to high passengers would probably have to offer laundry service 
as one of their amenities.

Nor do I, particularly regarding clothes.

It\'d have to be pretty low tech.  Below TL 4-5.  Especially since 
Washing Machines have been with us throughout the 20th century, in 
some form.

Well, cost, and time.  Let\'s be honest.  No matter how much a low 
tech world is able to import, there\'s going to be gaps.  What exactly 
is a low tech world going to do with high tech gadgetry, anyways?  
Need a real world example?  Take a look at the number of phone lines, 
areas unwired for electrical power, etc in a place like Rwanda.  For 
a world to import a high tech item, there is more to the question of 
it than whether or not the item is available.  Consider all the 
following:

1)  Does the low tech world need the item?  Is it important to the 
infrastructure of the world\'s economy?  (Remember, cost to import 
relatively needless items CAN outstrip the world\'s ability to buy 
them, use the Africa example again, for example)

2)  Can the low tech world\'s infrastructure support the item?  (What 
good would a cellular phone do you in Rwanda?)

Overhaul?  Let\'s consider the 20th century Terran equivalent:  
automobiles.  Yes, the local garage is liable to have the oil, 
grease, filters, plugs, etc on hand to do your overhaul, but what do 
you do if you need to replace the block?  Does Al\'s garage have the 
engine in stock?  Probably not, he\'s going to need to call a wrecking 
yard, or somebody who sells rebuilt engines, or whatever...  Problem 
is that a TL 9 world isn\'t likely to have the widget to fix that TL15 
power plant on your far trader.  Especially since they don\'t repair all 
that many of them.  They\'ll have to send out for it. 

Or maybe they do have it.  At A MUCH HIGHER PRICE to compensate for 
the fact that it might just be imported across a subsector or more, 
and then sit in a warehouse for 2 years.   

Either way, does the fact that they have the widget, mean that the 
starport also carries a ready supply of holovideo recorders, and 
mapboxes, and FGMP-15\'s?  

If so, then your game is not very realistic.

You assume that having the technology to handle something in one 
sector of the economy means that it is distributed equally across the 
technological spectrum, as well as distributed equally between a 
relatively local area, and a much bigger world.  Both very flawed 
assumptions.  

Consider:  Computers got their start in the US/UK military government 
sector, back in the 1940\'s.  For a while, that\'s where they stayed.  
Eventually cost started coming down, and big business started buying 
them.  It took nearly 30 years to put even crude ones in the hands of 
a regular joe though.  Technology is going to flow much the same way 
in the game.  New technology is going to flow into lower tech worlds 
through the starport first, then to local government and the 
military, then to big business, then to small businesses and Joe 
Citizen.  Terran examples reflect perfect communications.  Now add a 
several weeks time lag.

In my game, anything that is made in the Imperium is available, given 
time, money, and legality of import.  Want that nifty hand computer 
that\'s beyond the capability of the TL5 world to repair, sell, or 
service?  Great.  Joe\'s Electro-Rama Appliance City will be happy to 
order it for you.  It\'ll take X number of weeks, and the price will 
reflect the X increase in cost to import.  Don\'t expect Joe\'s 
Appliance City to stock it though, Joe\'d never seen one until you 
showed him a picture in the catalog, and he\'s probably never seen 
anybody actually want one...

No, I think he wanted it this way because it made for a very 
heterogenous world, which maximizes the opportunity for different 
cultures, different economies, and differences in worlds to become 
apparent.  If he\'d wanted it simple, he\'d have assumed interstellar 
communications, and every world carries/produces to a similar level 
of technology, etc.

Me, I\'m not so sure about it.  Certainly not 100%

        One would hope so :).  Seriously, though, I would think that the
thing would have a governor that ramped the thrust up slowly so as not to
go from zero to Mach 1 in 2.3 seconds (or so; haven\'t calculated that yet).
One would mess with this at one\'s peril.  Alternatively, a deadman switch
of sorts to throttle back hard as soon as the rider began to lose
consciousness might be the way to go, or a combination of both...

Hydrogen for fuel - usually carried in massive quanities (tons I believe
is the unit of measurement).

Oxygen for lifesupport - not measured per se, but inferred by the
biochemistry of most of the charactors.

Put \'em together, in appropriate proportions - H2O (water).  Useable for
cooking, cleaning, drinking AND recycling.  BTW, you also get electricity.

And, as the ultimate recycler - the fuel purifiers found on most (not all)
ships.

Just as a side note, referring to the lack of closet space aboard ship, US
Navy ships use what we affectionately refer to as the coffin locker.
Basically, your personal storage space is contained within your rack
(bed), with the mattress sitting on a hinged lid.  Very space effecient,
though kinda hard on the creases.

True.  I was using the Scout/Courier as my baseline for the wedge formulae,
since its configuration has always been described as "Wedge".  Maybe it
should be changed.

This is an errata that could have been dealt with if it had been known that
IG was going to basically sit on Starships for so long. The armor values
derived from the USD table are multipiled by 10 to arrive at the final Armor
Rating. This is a purely game design consideration with no foundation in any
sort of real logic (I have gone and record before and will do so again now
as saying that the basic Ship Combat system in T4 is TERRIBLE.) The value
that comes directly from the table is, by the way, the Battle Rider Armor value.

The official sector data for Core Sector will be in First Survey. There does
exist in various FTP sites the old Core Sector data from DGP; to what degree
this will be altered by First Survey beyond the already-discussed "new" Core
Subsector is anyone\'s guess at this point.
        Sector data for Gushemege is available in the same fashion. It is
interesting to note that the excellent adventure THE LONG WAY HOME (good
choice, sir) makes reference to the "old" Core Sector. This was probably
because things hadn\'t been finalized when they had to go to press.

That\'s the logical way to do it...the way I do it. <GD&R>

Of course, there could be variations, A short duration ship might
"freeze-dry" the "Glop" forgoing the reprocessing, then dispose of the
"Glop" at it\'s next port of call, and buy a new stock of food. A big luxury
liner might semi-process the "Glop" and use it to feed the gardens rather
than the passengers.

I know you think that. <G>

OTOH, I think it would have happened anyway.

I don\'t think the TC could have administered Ziru Sirku any better than the
Admirals did. So, the evenutal collapse would have happened anyway.  The
surprising thing, to me, is that it took 400 years...there had to have been
active Vilani participation to have kept the Rule of Man going that long.

I think the addition of the Terrians had a positive effect on the
situation, long term. I see the civilization coming out of The Long Night
as a blend of Terrian, Vilani and perhaps Sylean (whatever that is)
cultures.  I still think the Vilani dominate, ie. *won*, because they
vastly outnumber the other human races. The 3rd Imperium is much more
outward looking, more accomidating toward change, more flexible than the
Ziru Sirku, and that\'s the Terrian influence.

You\'ve got a fusion power plant on your ship!  You *certainly* should be
able to run waste through some processing to
eliminate/neutralize it.
 
Personally, I have the life-support system use energy and biological agents
to reprocess waste into pure water, clean air, and basic foodstuff.  The
basic foodstuff is a yeasty/algae, bad tasting mess, but a good galley
system (and programs) can process it into many tasty faux-foods.  The
occasional maintenance involves cleaning the vats and piping, doing
maintenance on the equipment, and restocking the *additives* that give the
faux-food their taste.  Additionally, stewards will try to have some *real*
food aboard to mix into the menu, especially for high-passengers.

On my ships, water isn\'t a problem.  I use alternate technology, and water
is the preferred fuel/reaction mass, so there\'s always plenty of water
around.  Mixing a little water, and maybe an emulsifier, with your sonic
blast gives you quick deep cleaning.

BTW, in my games processing fuel means producing purified water.  If you
refuel on a planet you have to remove salts and minerals.  Gas Giant
refueling is difficult because you have to both collect and combine the
hydrogen and oxygen.

That\'s a good point - there would certainly be variation.  I\'d say scouts 
would end up eating more Glop than the typical Navy person, and that the 
crew (and of course passengers) of a Luxury Liner might not even know 
what Glop _is_. :)

BTW, just as a point of clarification, Glop is the term for the food 
product that results from reprocessing wastes and/or processing raw 
materials (vegetation or whatever) gathered on a world surface.  (This is 
from T4 and CSC, both of which talk about Glop under the entry of 
Survival Still, IIRC.)

As I have not posted mush on the TML as of late, I decided to go ahead and 
post my ship designs which are also on my web site, Planet X. 
(http://www.magicnet.net/~opp-mag/)

Well without further ado, here\'s our first design, The SA-0 TL-12 Assault 
Scout.

SA-0 ( Scout Assault, Year 0 Version)TL-12

Hull 100WedgeAF
Crew 4 (Pilot, Nav, Gunner, Engineer)
Passengers:NONE
Cargo:NONE
Controls:Mil Std
Sensors: TL-12 Improved (2A 3P 0J)
8 Size Rating
Jump Drive: Jump-2
M-Drive: 6g(T.Plates)
Weapons:Millitary Twin Laser Battery TL-12 (3-2-0-0)
4 Fire Control Rating
5 Power Plant Rating(260MW Fusion-12)
21.5tons fuel(Scoops, Refinery)
20 Armour 10 Structure

Designed to be a Jump capable "Hit and Fade" Assault Scoutship. The SA-0 
jumps into a system, accelerates at 6g to the target, blasts
the taget with its Twin TL-12 Military Laser Turret, and the accelates back 
to J-point and jumps out of system. Its small size and high
speed make it a difficult target to hit, and is match for even a wing of 3 
fighters. A small fleet of 3 Assault scouts could seriously dammage or even 
disable patrol
cruiser before it had a chance to fire back!
Price: 67.77Mcr

Other designs coming to the TML:
The Merchantman Class Small Trader
The PD-0 Planetary Defence Boat
The CR-0 Wulfen Class Comerce Raider
The "X" Fighter (our pride and joy!)

Also look for Regency Designs converted over to TL-12 M:0 stats, like the 
"Varmint Gun" Small PA gun, after all nothing stops a PA short of a Black 
Globe, and ye know what, BG\'s tain\'t available till TL-15!   Amuse yer 
friends, destroy yer enemies! :)

Here\'s some info on the upcoming Pulp Starships products that will be

Starships are technically generic sci-fi adventures, but as you can tell 
from the descriptions (not to mention the authors), they fit right in with 
the official Traveller background.

The terrific Pulp Dungeons format applied to science fiction! Pulp 
Starships are incredible adventures in deepest space, every one an 
independent space saga, ideal for any science fiction role playing game!

24 pages of Foss\'s color artwork or something). Either they\'re spending way
to much to print the \'zine or paying the authors too much or expecting to
make megabucks on it (figuratively speaking), or there sub base is way low

     "Everything Is Driven By Economics"
     This is true. Too true. However, you only have half the story. 
     
     Economics (at least, *as we currently understand it*), is a pretty complex 
     beastie. The economic forces acting between planets and wildly different 
     technological levels will be even more complex; however, here are some 
     observations based on what we know about late 20th c. Terra. 
     
     Technological superiority does not necessarily mean economic dominance. 
     True, a starport may have access to the most technically efficient power 
     plant on the planet. However, it may still not be the most *economically 
     efficient* way to supply the planet\'s power needs. Comparative advantage 
     has been thrashed out on the TML before, so I won\'t go into it unless 
     people really want me to. 
     
     A few questions - really rhetorical - I supply the answers at the end. 
     
     Q: Why didn\'t the UN mission in Cambodia result in an enormous increase in 
     domestic technology? Why instead did the presence of tens of thousands of 
     UN personnel result in massive inflation, unemployment, shortages, social 
     dislocation, prostitution and crime? 
     
     Q: Why doesn\'t the entire Earth have the same level of technology as the 
     USA and Europe? After all, multinational corporations span the globe, most 
     non-military technology is widely available, and restrictions on 
     international trade tend to focus far more on commodities and manufactured 
     items than the information necessary to produce such items. 
     
     Q: Why doesn\'t the US Embassy in Canberra supply the power needs of eastern 
     Australia by building a nuclear fission reactor? Surely this could be "a 
     nice little revenue earner" for them...
     Admittedly an extreme example, but the US Government has access to the 
     technology, they could make plenty of money from doing it, and the Embassy 
     has extraterritorial status so it would be difficult for the Australian 
     government to stop them short of booting the entire embassy out of the 
     country.
     
     A: (to all the above) - Because "Everything Is Driven By Economics"! 
     
     Parallel questions as follows: 
     
     Q: Is it possible that a high-tech starport could exist on a low-tech 
     planet? 
     A: Yes. Relative incomes between the starport employees and the indigenous 
     population (the Cambodia example) will mean that the high-tech items will 
     remain out of reach of most locals other than an elite; domestic 
     manufacturing will probably be unable to achieve the economies of scale 
     possible on the Imperial industrial *planets*. There will still be 
     substantial leakage of technology across the extrality borders, but 
     domestic manufacturing capability might never spring up, particularly if 
     high tech goods are readily available from interstellar trade. 
     
     It\'s easier, and more economically efficient, for a low-tech planet to 
     trade raw materials and low-tech manufactured items for high-technology 
     items. 
     
     Q: Could a starport sell its excess power into a local electricity grid? 
     A: Of course it *could*. That is, if the local authorities permit them to. 
     Here are some possibilities: 
     . The local government (TL7-8) declares itself opposed to the use of 
     nuclear technologies on environmental grounds. The starport is still 
     permitted to use fusion power within the extrality border, but sale of 
     \'atomic power\' into local markets is not allowed. 
     (a variant) Local plants are OK because they meet stringent environmental 
     regulations. Alternatively, the planet may use cheap solar/wind etc. power 
     generation systems. 
     . Local power technologies are controlled by a cartel of influential 
     interests. They convince the \'government\' that starport fusion power is 
     dangerous. 
     . Local labour unions pressure the government into permitting only 
     domestically produced power, on the grounds that high-tech fusion power 
     will will cost local jobs. 
     . Few nations that would want anything as essential as power generation to 
     be dominated by foreign interests. OR would want power generation to be 
     dominated by a starport generator (a single, large one would be most 
     efficient and therefore most profitable!) 
     
     Installing a larger than needed fusion power plant might indeed be "a nice 
     little revenue earner". However, starports are very expensive, and the 
     agency building the port ( or the starport\'s financiers) might not want to 
     deal with more financial or political problems than absolutely necessary. 
     
     The difference between economic and technical efficiency became quite 
     obvious to me when I visited Russia a few years ago. In St. Petersburg, the 
     entire hot water and heating needs of the city are supplied by a few *hot 
     water plants*; soviet engineers had examined the problem of providing 
     heating and hot water to the city, and came up with a technically efficient 
     solution. The plants are enormous installations that do nothing but boil 
     water and pump it around the city. No need for the inefficient capitalist 
     pigdog imperialist approach of having your own hot water system in each 
     house. 
     
     Nice idea, except for the two weeks we were in the city, we didn\'t have 
     *any* hot water. The plant had been closed down for repairs. All I could 
     think was, thank God it was summer. 
     
     Finally, for those that might say "but electricity isn\'t hot water", I say: 
     true. However, in a world of cheap fusion power plants, don\'t you think 
     that each house might have its own fusion power supply, and electricity 
     grids become a thing of the past? 
     
     "Everything Is Driven By Economics". Too true.

As some of you may have noticed, my Traveller page (home of the IG FAQ!) is
down at the moment (http://www.dragonfire.net/~pm/traveller), as is the
whole Dragonfire system I think (for those with Dragonfire accounts).

Because of this, I have relocated, temporarily, my site to Inforamp.net
(http://www.inforamp.net/~scouse/peter/).  However, due to size\\transfer
limits, it contains only the starships from my old page, and the most up to
date copy of the Imperium Games FAQ.  Both of these will be kept up to date,
and I may or may not add new things that are posted to the TML.

All of the web problems should be fixed sometime early in the new year.  As
soon as they are, I will post a notice to the temp. site and the list.

Also, as side note, to those of you in personal correspondance to me, my
e-mail address has changed from PeterMiller@youngmerlin.com to
PeterMiller@irevolution.com as of December 24th.  I will stil recieve mail
at my old address for a while, but would prefer is the new address was used
starting tomorrow.

     ...although I don\'t agree entirely with your points about economics, I 
     have to say that your opponents are making a fairly poor showing and 
     therefore declare you winner by default. 
     
     From my travels to less civilised parts of the world (ie Russia 1994 
     and Solomon Islands 1995; for tact\'s sake I don\'t mention Melbourne 
     1996), the problem is that \'stuff\' is not readily available at all. 
     
     Merchants tend to buy where they can get goods the cheapest, and sell 
     where they can get the highest selling price. (I say *tend*, they are 
     human after all). The problem is that the market is far from \'free\', 
     even if you only take transaction costs (ie cost of shipping and 
     selling) into account. 
     
     There are a couple of ways of reducing/getting around shipping costs, 
     but the most common one is *scale* - ie ship huge amounts of a 
     commodity so that the per unit shipping cost is low. 
     
     Trouble then arises in a place that is relatively remote, with a weak 
     market. There will almost always be more profitable places to sell, 
     except if your product is surplus or unsaleable. Thus traders will 
     dump container-loads of defective clothing, near-rotten food, faulty 
     electrical goods and the like on the populace of said remote locale. 
     
     The price that the merchant gets for selling is far less than if they 
     managed to sell in developed countries, but still better than paying 
     for waste disposal. 
     
     Thus the phenomenon of seeing crateloads of near-rotten bananas for 
     sale on the streets of Moscow, or the fact that the main grocery store 
     in Honiara (Solomon Islands) only had a dozen or so products on the 
     shelves...but *hundreds* of items! 
     
     Oh, and if you want to give a Solomon Islander a special gift for 
     Christmas, why don\'t you buy them a box of cereal...it\'d cost you 
     about $US25- ! 
     
     FINALLY: 
     
     A phenomenon of the technological society in which we live (TL8 or 
     thereabouts) is that as goods/devices/production processes become more 
     sophisticated, a country becomes *more* dependent on international (in 
     T4 read interstellar) trade. Those starship components might not be 
     repairable on planet, regardless of the skill of your technicians. 
     Those particular components just might be disposable...see how many 
     computer technicians would try to repair a broken CPU, memory chip or 
     hard drive on your busted machine. Hell, they might be *able* to do 
     it, but it probably isn\'t worth their while. 
     
     Why would you spend an hour, at a staff cost of $25-, to repair a $10- 
     component? Why would you spend a week to repair a $500- component? The 
     answer: you wouldn\'t. Not unless there was no way to get a cheap 
     replacement, and your customer was desperate enough to *pay* the 
     extra!

I haven\'t finished reading Aliens yet (and from the holiday activities 
still to come, I doubt I will for another week or so), but here\'s some 
info for those considering purchasing it:

Name:  Aliens Archive
Length: 108 Pages (2 pages of ads, 8 pages of "concept" illos in B&W, 2 
                   pages of color illos)
Author: Timothy Brown
Price: $22.95
Number of Aliens Covered: 12
Alien Names: Asym, Bye-Ren, The Controlled, Denaar, Graytch, Hana Saka,
             Hresh, Newts, Nuclees, Providers, Tekundu, Trakii.
Alien Types: All are minor races.  A variety is covered, from fairly
             human to quite unusual.  Sapient plant-life, reptile,
             communal worm beings, etc.  
Illustrations: Skeletal, Concept, and Final

Each Alien is covered in about 8 pages.  For each alien, the following 
information is given:  Psychology, Homeworld Background, History, 
Society, Character Generation, Other Game Rules (variants necessary for 
the alien species), Travel and Starships, Quick Role-Playing Tips.  Also 
included in each is a couple of Close Encounter-type write-ups, one of a 
native of the species, and one of an Imperial citizen of the species.

The aliens aren\'t tied to specific worlds, so that referee\'s can place 
the homeworld wherever s/he desires.  

The writing is high-quality and intelligent.  I have yet to find any typos.

On the down side, the font used is fairly large; it would have been nice 
if a smaller font size had been used, allowing either more information on 
each alien or more aliens.  However, I have found the variety of aliens 
included to be more than adequate, and the amount of information on each 
alien to be satisfactory.

My overall rating: 95%  (Again, I haven\'t read the entire volume yet.)

Subjective Review:  On a purely technical level, this supplement is 
better than CSC, simply because CSC has some typos and some info (a few 
price/mass figures) was left out of it.  However, CSC will be far more 
useful to me in my particular campaigns.  Your mileage may vary.

: Hey how about this. IG probably made a honest mistake. They cant afford

Now, I can agree with you on this, in the grand scheme, $11.20 isn\'t
that much of a deal to any of us.

However (there\'s always one of these), it\'s the principle of the matter
that is the issue here.  Forget the fact that they aren\'t honoring a
price they posted, forget the fact that they didn\'t tell anyone sooner,
forget the fact that right now many people aren\'t happy with IG because
of previous mistakes.

Let\'s look at the one very important fact at hand--they applied charges
to a person\'s credit card without informing the consumer.  That is quite
simply illegal.  It\'s akin to theft and credit card fraud!!!  Had IG
called and said that they must surcharge or refund, and thus let the
consumer know what is going on, then things would have been okay.  The
fact is they didn\'t.

Likewise, for anyone that ordered with VISA, it is against VISA\'s policy
to charge anyone until the product leaves the door (no, I don\'t think
it\'s the same for MC, I believe that MC has a 1 week charge period).

I\'ll be the first one to defend IG tooth and nail to be allowed to make
Traveller products.  I\'ll even allow them to make mistakes in their
products.  I can\'t in any way justify them breaking all kinds of
consumer protection and credit card fraud laws simply because they are
ignorant of procedures!

As much as I hate to say this, if people are disatisfied with the cost
of JTAS, then thay should call IG, drop their purchase of JTAS, and have
the charges reversed.

Heavier does indeed qualify for longer construction times (given the same

Assigning more workers equates to spending more money on it, that is, if

Did you miss one of my messages to Hans on this subject, a couple of days
ago? Let me answer a couple more of your comments, and I\'ll put all this
into a coherent system.

The various bottlenecks and so forth, of which shipyard capacity is only
one, impose limits on how much and how fast you can build. If, for only one
example, you only have 100 shuttlecraft, it\'s useless to plan a
construction rate based on having 150. The same goes with any other
limiting component or system.

OK, enough arm waving: Let me put this all into a system.

    'body' => 'A few days ago, Hans gave a figure from TCS of 1 ton per thousand
inhabitants per year, I think. I proposed converting that to simply a
figure in MCr, using an average of .5 MCr per ton.
With the figure I gave of shipyard production at 1-2 MCr per 100 shipyard
workers per month, that gives a total of about 4 workers per thousand
population: the higher rate gives about 2.

Actually, I think it works better if you pick the size of the industry as a
percentage of the population, and let your MCr of shipyard capacity go up
with tech level. The various governmental modifiers and other TCS modifers
might apply to this percentage. It would naturally vary somewhat from world
to world, in any case. However, once chosen, it should cost to increase it.

Now, you divide up these MCr according to ship classes (if you\'re figuring
naval budgets, the amount you can devote to new construction goes into one
or more of these classes).
Divide the MCr devoted to a given class by the average ship cost
appropriate to that class, to give you ships per year. 
Divide this by 50 (52 if you insist) to give you average ships per week. 
The reciprocal of this last number is an average construction time in weeks
per ship.

This number assumes that you are building only one ship at a time, which is
absurd for small ships. Multiply this average time by the number of ships
you are building at any given time, to get the construction time for one
ship.

Now, if you increase the MCr devoted to the ship class, without changing
the number of ships at any one time, you are increasing your rate of
production and shortening construction times. 
If you just increase the number of ships at a given time without increasing
the MCr, you are dividing your resources among more ships, so each one
takes longer, but your overall rate of production remains the same. 
If you increase the MCr and thus the rate of ship production, and the
number of ships being built at one time, the construction time remains
about the same.
If you increase the cost of a ship, either by making it bigger or putting
more hardware in it, your ship production rate goes down, and the time it
takes to build it goes up, unless you either either increase the budget for
the class, (increasing production rates) or concentrate your effort (MCr,
workers) by building fewer of them at a time.

This system is perhaps a little more complex than I understand TCS is, but
it is much more powerful, flexible, and IMO realistic.

    'body' => 'It should be painfully obvious from the ongoing argument about GG
refuelling that, except in systems where there is no mainworld, that GG
refuelling will never happen, simply for reasons of security. However,
there is a better reason - and one that has the imprimatur of none other
than Marc Miller himself!

What? you say? *What* is this reason? Well, I know I\'ve been harping on it
somewhat for other threads, but it is still applicable - and *very* much
so! It is, of course, as Marc points out quite specifically in the basic
rules (pg. #7) -- "Everything is driven by economics".

Consider the *economics* of running a commercial starship. As I have shown
in "recent" posts about the economics of running Free, Far and Fat Traders
(you *can\'t* run them at a profit *unless* you speculate in cargoes, more
or less), even running at two jumps per month (on average), profitability
is difficult to ensure.

That\'s assuming, as has always been the case, that the starship picks up a
cargo, maneuvers from a planetfall/port, makes one jump and then maneuvers
to a planetfall and delivers a cargo. The Jump takes about a week,
regardless of distance, while it takes between 6-7 hours (at 1G) and 2-3
hours (at 1G) to maneuver from planetfall to a safe jump distance ... call
it a day each end. Then allow a day at each end for loading/unloding (at
least) - and an average of a day at each end looking for cargoes (Starport
fees traditionally cover a stay of up to six days). So the all up time per
"Jump" (or trip) is around two weeks ... two Jumps per month.

Now, if you want to refuel at a GG you have to add travel time to and/or
from the thing. According to MTrav Referees Companion, typical distance to
a far neighbour world (which I presume is a near GG) is between 1.6 (at 6G)
and 4.0 (at 1G) days ... and if the GG is a "far" GG, this is 2.8 to 6.9
days respectively! Assuming a one way trip at each end, you add between 3.2
and 13.8 days to your turnaround time. (Oh, and even microjumping is
pointless as it takes a week in Jumpspace anyway - and time is, quite
literally, money!)

To a commercial operator this is *disastrous* ... you have cut 20 - 50% off
your profitability through lost time!!! That is, assuming a 3.2 day
addition, you get 4 jumps in the time you would otherwise get 5; assuming a
13.8 day addition, you get one jump in the time you would get 2!!!

And what does fuel cost? 500 Cr per ton refined and 100 Cr per ton
unrefined! So you average 200 ton Free Trader will "save" 10k Cr by
forgoing one Jump in two - at a *cost* of around 125k Cr ... a net *LOSS*
of 115k Cr !!!

Seems to me that in systems where there *are* mainworlds that there will be
*huge* economic incentives for ships to fuel there. Only in systems that
are otherwise uninhabited will there be any point in fuelling at a GG.

Oh, and note that, even if the ship is simply "passing through", the
assumption that Traveller Jump-control is precise enough to come in pretty
close to the target makes coming in close to an inhabited world more
attractive than going to a far GG. Unless you\'re running full, there\'s
always the chance that you might get a hot chance for a pickup cargo - one
that would make no economic sense to pursue if you had to divert from a
GG!!!

Of course, this all assumes that the standard 1000 Cr per ton rate for
cargo applies - but, as I\'ve already pointed out, it almost certainly won\'t
except on high volume routes - still, for the sake of not producing further
off *this* topic arguments, lets assume it is applicable.

Ergo, out of Marc Miller\'s own mouth (so to speak), GG refuelling is almost
never going to happen - and, for the purposes of the SDB argument, *never*
will happen in any system with an inhabited mainworld !!!

I agree with you, but with a little proviso.

If the component is necessary and a replacement is *completely* unavailable
then it isn\'t a $10 component..it\'s value is whatever it takes to repair or
replace it.  If it costs $500 to repair that $10 part, and the alternative
is waiting on the ground 6 weeks for the part to be shipped in, then the
*economic* thing to do is pay the $500 and put the ship back into service
earning money.

Wouldn\'t as much of a ship\'s equipment as possible be designed to be field
repairable?  On ships that will be travelling to places where replacement
parts aren\'t readily available, I\'d want
*everything* really important to be field repairable.

Well, yes and no. The Vilani, as we know from all the canon sources (*all*
the sources that refer even vaguely to the First Imperium) were *the* top
do, technologically speaking *throughout* the period of their "empire
building", as you call it - *until* they came across the Terrans (and even
there they had an *initial* advantage). The Vilani had never come across
(at that stage - except for the Vargr, maybe, who weren\'t competition
because of their own chaotic social structures) anyone like the terrans ...
they had always been able to rely on gunboat diplomacy to overawe the
natives. They had the advantage in tech - and a *huge* one. They never
really had any serious competition and fought "wars" the way they expected
to ... on a commercial basis (the latter is my own suggestion, of course,
but the former is fairly obvious).

Its like comparing the Europeans in their colonial phase vs. the african
and asian peoples they "conquered" - would the armies they organised to
fight these fuzzy-wuzzies, dervishes and "natives" have stood up in combat
against *other* european forces designed to combat equals? The answer is
(and I *can* quote exceptions - but irrelevant ones) a resounding *NO*!
They were (for example) universally short of heavy weapons (in a european
sense) for a start ... they were basically light infantry.

The Terrans were different. They were something that the Vilani had never
come across before - an *equal* opponent (well, maybe they had come across
technologically advanced states before, but it seems as if these states did
not have the advanced Jump drives of the Vilani, as the implication is that
this was always the Vilani advantage).

So they continued to use their "normal" tactics, and their "normal" ship
designs - and got trounced. The response would have been to throw more men
and materiel at the problem, and perhaps even beef up TO&E\'s, but by that
time they had lost their vital edge in tech and the Terrans were able to
equal them there. Worse, the terrans didn\'t seem (one can assume) to fight
by the rules.

For example, I suspect that the Vilani would have been horrified at the
thought of (say) bombing infrastructure indiscriminately (a la WW2) to
knock it out - they would have looked at it from an economic point of view
and preferred to *capture* it, or leave it alone until it *could* be
captured. Then those crazy terrans start trashing the Vilani non-military
infrastructure "behind the lines" ... using the sort of depots in empty
space to "turn" the "front line" as has been suggested much of late. This
would give the Terrans a huge headstart as the Vilani probably didn\'t even
have the equivalent of SAMs or AA guns to defend such sites ... as it never
occured to them to defend them as they had never had to! It would then take
a lot of reapraisal and then tooling up and redeployment before they could
meet the threat.

The Terrans, of course, would never entirely leave their own assets
undefended - but would soon realise that the Vilani wouldn\'t attack them
and would get away with running riot for a *long* time. I suspect that this
sort of thing would be so completely foreign to the sort of hug-a-tree
fuzzy-liberal attitudes the Vilani seem to be credited with (my
interpretation here, of course) that they mught *never* realy come to grips
with why the Terrans were doing these terrible things ... and how they
always found ways to escalate when they finally came to grips with theit
*last* "crazy tactic".

Well, certianly - the Zhos, if they\'d been encountered before the Terrans,
for a start. Or the Aslan (assuming they had somehow invented their own
J-Drive and earlier than historically). Not the Hivers. Perhaps the K\'kree,
too.

Oh, don\'t get me wrong, I am not saying that this was the *only* factor - I
still stand by my comments of some while ago about how it is likely that
the Terrans outproduced the Vilani (again, at least partly because of
differing views of economics) rather like the Allies vs. the Nazis. And the
"liberation" factor - all those "subject peoples" who probably yearned to
get rid of their stifling Vilani overlordship (someone *always* thinks the
overlords are stifling!).

	The reason that this does not seem to make sense is that 
it_does_not make sense.  The routine maintenance can be performed at any 
type A or B starport rule is WRONG & should be changed.  The rule should 
be Routine Maintenance may be performed at any type A or B starport of 
equal or higher tech level.  Yes theoretically starports could be 
importing higher tech parts & training but we have_no_evidence that they 
are.  There is some canonical evidence that suggests that ships do need 
to be maintained at facilities of their own Tech Level or higher, as 
follows.

	In The MegaTraveller Journal Issue #3 (by DGP) in an article on 
Vincennes (A899AA6-G 1122 Deneb) Charles Kalina wrote "Civilian ships 
produced at Vincennes were of the highest performance & reliability, but 
their high-technology actually became a marketing liability.  As 
Vincennes\' designs became more advanced, fewer & fewer starports were 
able to service & maintain these vessels...Currently the only TL-16 
ships in civilian use are either merchants operating soley in the 
Vincennes area, or megacorporations for whom the advantages of TL-16 
construction outweigh the expense of maintaining such vessels."

	If this ruling is made things will not only make more sense but 
we will also have a better (partial) explanation for why all those yards 
of less than maximum available tech level manage to stay in business; 
that is that they sell to customers who do not want to worry about if & 
where they can get their ship maintained.

	Actually for maximum realism (& to make players lives more 
difficult) the rule should probably be: Routine Maintenance may be 
performed at any A or B starport of the ships tech level or the next 
higher tech level only.  I would think that if you went to a TL-15 
shipyard looking for maintenance on your TL-9 starship this would be 
akin to bringing your Model A car (TL 6) into a modern garage (TL 8) for 
repairs & expected them to be able to fix it (& this is only a 2 tech 
level differance, not 6).

	On a further note I would not want to have the routine 
maintenance for_my_ship done at a type B starport.  What if they 
discoved that the Jump Drive was worn & needed replacing, a type B port 
could not make one (by definition) & you would then have to get an 
import at a higher cost & expense, probably prepaid.

	These rules will also help the referee keep control of the 
campaign because if the players must go to a planet with the appropriate 
 tech level for their maintenance the referee can insure that they will 
go their (or risk problems & misjumps, etc).  For example if you have a 
TL 15 ship in the Spinward Marches circa 1105 you will only have about 5 
 planets in the whole sector who can fix it. (Glisten, Rhylanor, Mora,

I really want to start ranting once more but IG needs to do something
about the prices.  $20 for 93 pages is a very, very bad joke.  I really
wanted to buy that book, but at this price... no.  I guess that\'s it.  My
third failed attempt of having a nice Traveller campaign :-(  The sad
thing about the price is, that usually shops over here in Germany multiply
by 2.5 to get the price in German Marks (which -- divided by about 1.5
once more -- is the price in dollars).  Thus I effectively would have to
pay about $33 -- which is a lot too much even for a very well written
supplement.

I really wonder what makes them think that Traveller has even a decent
chance to survive at such high prices.  You get complete roleplaying games
at least twice (if not three times) as large as that price...

My FLGS doesn\'t carry ANY of the Pulp adventure products. :(  So, I ended 
up ordering direct from Destination Games.  They just set up a web-site 
at:

http://www.destination2.com

But the site\'s still under construction.  Not much there other than the 
rules for Chaos Progenitus (a collectible dice game).  Destination Games 
should have the page all fixed up by the time Pulp Starships is out.

Oh, and you can probably tell whether your FLGS will carry Pulp Starships 
by whether they presently carry Pulp Dungeons.

Air resistance is approximately proportional to the velocity or square of
the  velocity. This has the effect of giving objects a constant terminal
velocity. Another S.W.A.G. (involving more assumptions than I have any
right to make) gives a 
terminal velocity = cube root of (vehicle power/a constant).
The constant has to do with the density of the atmosphere, frontal area of
the vehicle, streamlining, among other things.

This is a way to distinguish products by manufacturer/shipyard or by mileau -
MegaCorp A\'s laser turrets are faster to build (and therefore can be used to
crank out that new fleet in record time), but their field maintenance stinks;
whereas MegaCorp B\'s laser turrets are of a higher quality (ie, easier to
repair in the field), but can\'t be rushed as much (eg, only half the bonus for
cutting ship construction time).

That same turret at a higher tech level (or just after 50 years of experience
in building the same type of device) would either be easier to maintain (by
design) or harder to maintain (the disposable integrated components problem).
I\'m of the opinion that the IC problem will just get worse - things will be
designed to be disposable and spare parts will be critical (as they always are
in the military anyway).  The machine tools and sophisticated electronics that
it would take to repair many items just wouldn\'t be available to a trader,
except at Class A starports, or the Corp Repair Depot.  The military would
have their own maintenance departments and perhaps whole ships that jumped
with the fleet to handle this problem (the Fleet Tanker would also be a spare
parts depot; electronics and gravitics repair labs, etc).

Those brave souls in the Far Trader that jump into unknown systems would be
wise to have a significant portion of their cargo tonnage devoted to spares,
and trade would be only for the most valuable of commodities until a regular
trading/shipping service was established to frontier worlds.

(Ieeee! The dreaded maintenance points! Ieeee!)

From: Michael.Barry@FINANCE.ausgovfinance.telememo.au
> A: Of course it *could*. That is, if the local authorities permit them to. 

I agree completely.  Local politics and self-interest would dominate the
situation of a high-tech starport on a lower tech world; unless it was the
military that just plops down a naval base and dictates to the locals what
they can and can\'t do.

Makes sense. The Vilani wouldn\'t consider *not* running it that way. 
(Reminds me of _THX-1138_, where the police chase is stopped because it 
went over-budget).

One problem: if your theory is correct, once the Ziru Sirka reached a 
certain size (and so a long travel time to/from the frontier), the first 
race to seriously fight back would destroy it. I suppose the Terrans 
could have been the first to do so, but it seems unlikely.

Joe Walsh,
    One suggestion for starships, is that they redo it entirely for the next
printing. And that perhaps we should send them an example of what\'s expected?
(I tried posting this before but it didn\'t quite make it). As it seems their
missing the entire point of such a product (IMHO).

enhancements.

: I really wonder what makes them think that Traveller has even a decent
: chance to survive at such high prices.  You get complete roleplaying games
: at least twice (if not three times) as large as that price...
: 
: Thomas "Why? WHY? *WHY?*" Biskup.

The problem is that if you look at the market, their prices aren\'t high
at all for a small gaming company.  Take Dream Pod 9, all of their
products which are the same size as the Traveller products, cost just as
much.  Even the big companies charge similar prices.  WEG now charges
$18 to $20 dollars for 96 page supplements (and I\'m sorry, but a $3
difference isn\'t enough to bitch about).

Now Big Companies can afford *much* larger print runs and thus get a
lower printing cost (and thus having a lower priced product).  Looking
around the shelves, I see that most TSR and WW supplements are still
going for $15 to $18 dollars for 96 page supplements (I wonder if this
lends and credence to comments about both of these companies being in
dire straits).

Now SJG actually puts out a 128 page product for the $18 to $20 dollar
range--I think that they end up being the best deal on the gaming
market.  Unfortunately, they are the exception, not the rule.

Oops, I forgot my mandatory BTRC plug.  8)  The latest edition of 3G^3
hit the shelves.  It clocks in at 128 pages or pure gun-toting fun and
sells for $16.  I do however think that since BTRC is a company of one
they (okay, Greg) have/has a slightly lower overhead than most of the
aforementioned companies.

I\'ll be honest in saying that DP9\'s products are good enough that fans
of the game are fanatical and don\'t mind paying and extra $2 to $4 per
book.  I still believe that IG could stand to look at their entire Heavy
Gear product line and take some pointers.

Sorry folks, but the days of $6 supplements and $15 hardbacks are long
gone in the gaming market--and with the way things are going, don\'t
expect prices to begin lowering.  8(

This could also explain why the Type A Free Trader should be a TL 9
design in M0 and M1100.

Also, since TL 15 starports would know there are lots of TL 9 Free
Traders out there, they\'d want to keep stocked up on enough supplies
to get all that maintenance business. The same could be argued for 
other TLs and other starships.

It is also possible that TL 10+ Type A Starports could produce TL 9 
Free Traders that cost less. Now, there\'s a deal!

Case in point (real world): my office has a computer that is down more than
up. We are NOT allowed to replace it. Thus, I am stuck spending 2-3 hours
per week (costing the gov\'t $12+ per hour) fighting with the machine to
keep it running so that a higher paid employee can do her work on it. In
the long run, it would be cheaper to surplus the machine and replace it
with one that is working.

Budgetary provisions will necessitate many similar "Fix it cause you ain\'t
allowed to repair it" situations... another real world case: the car that
eats lots of maintenance time... but you MUST have to get to work (a common
problem in alaska). You will keep fixing it to minimize down time from
work... so you can\'t save up for that new one, cause it eat\'s that
percentage of your income.

I\'ve created a few forms on my web page that you might be interested in
using in your design process.  I did this partly because I felt I needed
something standardized to help me when I design stuff, and partly so I
could develop a presentation format for the web page for my upcoming PBEM
I\'m planning.

The first is a blank career description form.  It has a similar look to
the design in the T4 rulesbook.  This is the format that I use with the
alternate career description that I have posted on my page.  When a new
career pops up here all I do (after I get the permission of the creator,
of course) is cut and paste the material into the form from the TML post
and voila\', the career is ready for posting.  It prints out on two pages
if printed from a browser, though.  So far, I have the Bureaucrat,
Journalist, Military Intelligence, Pirate, and Secret Agent careers up
already.

The other two forms have to do with QSDS.  The first is a QSDS Worksheet.
 I\'ve (hopefully) set it up in a easy-to-understand step-by-step format. 
The columns set up are: Component, Volume, Power, Cost, Surface Area,
Crew, and a large notes column which has any additional information that
might be required for the particular component.  This is in a tabular
format.  At the bottom is a separate table allowing for calculation of
the required crew needed.

The other form is the QDSD Display Form.  This is the familiar format
we\'ve come to know and love from the QSDS.  There is a main section for
the statistics for the ship.  Below that is a table which allows you to
present the number of members per assignment in the crew.  Finally, the
rest of the page will allow you to add more descriptive notes on the
ship.

I tried to make these forms easy to use.  Any comments are welcome, of
course.

Here are the forms addresses:

stating that just such an area would be set up on IG\'s web site after 
January 1 (i.e., when they return to the office).

In addition, there is always IG\'s email box (sweetpea10@msn.com), which is 
a good interim means of communicating with them.  If we don\'t tell them 
what we want and do not want, then they have no way of knowing. :)  
[Well, that\'s not entirely true - I try to summarize what is said here,

Anyway, have a good Chritmas Day.

 Well, now, that may not be totally inaccurate - but I think
 I\'ll obfuscate the issue a little bit by pointing out that
 McDonald\'s works the same way - they have a System (note cap)
 that specifies The Way Things Are Done (even down to what order
 you flip the hamburgers on the grill!), and deviations from the
 System affect your profit - and the company auditors can
 generally tell where you\'re out of line, and how, just by
 looking at the books!

 McDonald\'s is also resistant to new ideas until the developer
 of the idea shows how it can be incorporated into the System,
 and proves that it\'s sound by taking on the job of operating
 the one McDonald\'s restaurant that\'s _not_ open to the general
 public - the one on the campus of Hamburger U., their primary
 training center.  On top of being incorporated into the System,
 it has to be profitable (i.e., the average store is expected to
 make more money with this on the menu than not).  Sounds to me
 like an interesting combination of Vilani conservatism and
 Terran entrepreneurialism...

T::>I don\'t think it was a Vilani plan.  I just think this is the way their

 That said, I will note that I _do_ like this viewpoint.  If you

 it up on the Freelance Traveller pages.

I don\'t see why size should be a factor in my argument - perhaps I\'m just
dense :-{

Actually, it needn\'t have been the Terrans - anyone with both a will to
fight, the means to do so *and* a different outlook on warfare would have
had the same effect. The Zhos, the Aslan (if they\'d had J-Drives at the
time) the K\'kree etc ... it was just fortuitous that it was the terrans!

Is the Megatraveller Journal, striclty speaking, "canon" ... I certainly
would value Marc Miller\'s constant say-so in every Traveller rulebook since
Ctrav over a one off mention from a source that could well be assumed by
some to be non-canon! Even MTrav rules assumed that maintenance was
possible at any Starport, regardless of local TL!

The problem with the example is that the Starport/Starships in question are
TL16 - that is, above the average imperial level for the Third Imperium of
c. 1100. I was (and I think I did specify - if I didn\'t, I apologise)
talking about the *average* imperial TL. Thus, for Milieu 0 Starports
capable of maintenance can be assumed to be able to maintain ships of TL12
or less.

Your example is not relevant in the light of this. The constant statements
of Traveller rules that A/B Starports can maintain vessels, with *NO* ifs,
ands, or buts is more than enough "canon" ... or are you arguing with Marc
and not me? If you think that Marc has been wrong since CTrav, well, take
it up with *him*!!!

Note that I *did* comment that the *real* reason the rule is as it is is
simply for the sake of simplicity! Makes perfect sense from that point of
view ... unfortunately, it doesn\'t make sense from any pov of what we can
loosely term "internal realism and consistency" *unless* you assume as I
do, and that is that local TLs are meaningless to a greater or lesser

It may well be that this *should* be the rule - but it isn\'t! CTrav, MTrav,
TNE and T4 *all* are in agreement that maintenance can be done at *any* A/B
Starport - and make no mention of TL of local starport compared to TL of
ship. Wishing it were different won\'t change the rock solid facts.

Why would a Type B not be able to make a Jump Drive? Starport type is
independent of TL, pretty much.

Again, yes, it makes perfect sense - except for the teeny little problem
that *all* iterations of Traveller state that maintenance can be done at
*any* A/B Starport, and make no mention of TL. And, again, wishing the
rules weren\'t what they are won\'t change the facts that they *are* what
they are!

Yes, but this would *have* to mean that they are either charging a *hell*
of a lot more than 1000 Cr per ton, or are *certain* of making a profit of
relatively *vast* proportions.

Regardless, the Imperium seems a pretty happy-go-lucky place for traders,
so I can\'t see much need for a *huge* smuggling trade. And, of course, PCs
would not *routinely* engage in smuggling :-)

Why are you surprised?  If someone dares to demand $20 for a tiny "93
useful pages" supplement you really shouldn\'t be surprised.  My personal
guess is that the pricing policy of IG will be their doom if they don\'t
change anything soon.   Gamers no longer spend as much money on products
as they did in former years (look at the financial problems of TSR and
Whitewolf which really do not bode well for the industry in general).  Now
if IG continues to demand such exorbitant prices they are probably dead as
soon as Courtney realizes how much money he\'s going to loose in months to
come.

At least the IG crew really proved, that they have no idea about business
of any kind.

Nonetheless Merry Christmas to you all!

    'body' => 'Some of the comments against my proposition that the presence of an A or B
Starport on a world effectively negates the worlds TL and replaces it with
Average Imperial (TL12 for Milieu 0, for example) set me to thinking -

One line of thought is that the presence of a Starport has no effect on the
locals because they see no reason to be affected by it and/or cannot afford
to purchase the high tech goods it represents.

The arguments adduced to this scenario seem to have missed the point ...
or, more than likely, in my old age i\'m not making myself as clear as I
*should* be.

The minimum TL world on which you will find an A or B Starport is one of
TL5 ... that is, a world with Tech circa 1900-1940 in Terran terms. This
indicates a world with a good industrial base to support a machine based
technology - and, unless some weird (and probably unique) local factor
means otherwise, a good science level as well.

All of the examples against my proposition have been of the third world
African or isolated (relatively speaking) Pacific island variety. These
societies, if cut off from the rest of the world, would be thrown back onto
their underlaying TL ... perhaps TL3-4 in the case of the African examples
(they lack the infrastructure to build themselves better), and probably
only 0-1 in the case of the isolated Pacific islands (they lack indigenous
sources of raw materials vital to a higher tech - such as iron, apart from
scrap imported from elsewhere, which would eventually run out). They are
not, therefore, good examples of what the situation (might) really be like
in our hypothetical situation.

The societies in question are mechanised and industrialies - otherwise they
wouldn\'t qualify as TL5+ (sorry, to qualify at this level you *have* to be
mechanised and industrialised - that\'s what defines the TL in historical
terms). Therefore, they see the value of technical advancements - perhaps
not as well as they might, but that\'s entirely dur to hindsight anyway.
They also see the benefits of taking advantage of the presence of a high
tech facility such as a Starport.

Why is the Starport there? Well, since, as we are told (and, yes, I *know*
i\'m harping on this, but it is *vitally* relevant), economics determines
everything, we can assume that its because there\'s trade *with* the world,
or running *through* the world (as part of an X-boat link - which i\'ve
always assumed means a major trade route is present as well) ... no, it has
little (nothing, I would suggest) to do with military necessity - that\'s
what a *Naval* or *Scout* Base is representing. So, it\'s there for economic
reasons. It\'s got to pay its way - and one way to do this is to provide
services ... damnit, its the *only* way to do it! These services are to the
passing trade - the interstellar cargo and passenger liners that use the
world as a waystation or as an endpoint. If the Starport is an A or B
facility, this means the ability to maintain ships of *any* TL (except, as
the only example against this suggests, if that TL is *above maximum
Imperial*) - and, since this is repeated in *all* iterations of Traveller,
and there has *never* been any caveat about having to be a Starport of a TL
equal to or higher than that of the ship desiring maintenance *and* there
has *never* been any mention about it costing more, then we *must* assume
that this is literally true (unless you want to redesign the game - in
which case, feel free to take it up with Marc if you want it to be more
than unofficial and non-canon).

So. We have this high tech (using T4, say TL12) facility sitting in the
middle of a (say) TL5 world. The locals recognise the value of the tech -
its part of their inherent tech culture itself - and so will attempt to
acquire it. What is stopping them? There are no Imperial Laws against it -
the Imperium is set up to *facilitate* trade, not to restrict it! The cost
of interstellar Transport is no more than 1000 Cr a ton (which we all know
is likely to be a complete crock - but it *is* "canon"). And best of all,
there\'s all these ships passing through there!!!

This *will* mean that there will be a real reason for ships to carry
cargoes to and from the world to *encourage* the use of high tech items by
the locals in return for the raw materials (or services) that makes it
worthwhile putting the starport there in the first place! It *may* mean
that the relatively low local individual salaries (compared to the
costs/salaries of a high tech world) will *limit* the spread of high tech
stuff, but it will be there - and, inevitably, because of the nature of the
society that produces a sustainable TL of 5+, it will spread and spread
rapidly! OK, maybe they won\'t have a 100 brands of TL12 Computers - maybe
they\'ll have only one; maybe they\'ll only have TL11 Computers - but they
*will* have computers, and these *will* replace TL5 mechanical adding
machines! Forex, a TL12 produced pocket calculator, produced down to a
price for the specific trade with a TL5 (or general low tech, but
industrialised) world will be cheaper than said mechanical calculator *and*
be much more functional than a mechanical calculator could ever be.

The upshot is, that within a *very* short period the world in question will
be at what is effectively TL11 or 12, just short of "cutting edge" - buying
the castoffs of the high tech worlds, perhaps, but much better than they
themselves can produce locally!

Then consider the high tech starport facility. Its already there because it
can turn a profit serving the users - why would they reject turning a
*greater* profit serving the locals. Even if it is somewhat limited to the
city where the starport is or close by (though radio commo links and
satellites - and this would behoove the Starport authorities to have their
own commo satellite links there for their own use - mean that distance is
overrated for these purposes), the facility will have a real incentive to
make available certain services that the locals *will* (given the nature of
their machine using, automated, industrialised culture) recognise the value
of - and that means using the clean Fusion power of the Starport rather
than the clunky local coal or fossil fuel burning plants (and the power is
almost certainly cheaper, too - its like Oz buying all those US TV shows
... the US sees Oz as "icing on the cake" and doesn\'t charge anywhere
*near* what they charge the US Networks and local stations, as their profit
has already been guaranteed from their main market - just as the
*Starports* main profit has been guaranteed from its main market, otherwise
the damn thing wouldn\'t be there in the first place!), they see the value
of time-sharing arrangements using the Computing Power available to the
Starport as well, and of using the technical know-how of the Techs employed
there. It also makes some sense for the Starport authority to train local
people as Techs rather than pay a "hardship" allowance for high tech
worlders to come out to the boonies - and most of these locals will retire
locally, and will spread their skills.

Sure, it\'ll be very spotty - you\'ll get contradictions like Wrist-Com
equipped local types riding around in the equivalent of a Model-T Ford ...
and others who use a cheap Yugo-equivalent Grav vehicle for transport, but
read print newspapers and communicate by wired telegraphy. But the point is
that the TL5 rating of the local world will be of academic interest at most
- - certainly the PCs will be able to get almost anything they want of a high
tech nature, especially non-specialised items, and given the caveat of
*slightly* higher prices (no more than10-20% I would expect) *and* lack of
"brand name" choice. But, erm, where do brand names come into equipment
choice in Traveller anyway? Isn\'t all the equipment effectively generic?

Lets take a more realistic Terran example. The US, for example. TL9 at the
very least, probably TL10 in some areas - huge manufacturing and industrial
base at the cutting edge. Highly educated and (averages here) wealthy
population.

Take Oz. Effectively TL9 at the very least, and at least as likely to be
TL10 in some areas (tho different ones) as the US. Small manufacturing and
industrial base - and not at anywhere near the cutting edge in most areas
(and where it is, using mostly imported components from the US or countries
of the same standard). Highly educated and reasonably wealthy populace.

What are the *sustainable* tech levels of each country? Well, its obvious
that the US will have no problem maintaining its TL9/10 level regardless of
anything short of a major nuclear war. Oz? If she was somehow transported
to another (uninhabited) dimension tomorrow? I suspect that the best we
would be able to do would be to maintain a level of around late TL6 to
early to mid TL7. So, how do you classify Oz? As a TL9/10 "planet" or as a
TL6/7 one? Aren\'t the differences irrelevant? *That\'s* what I\'m getting at.

And note that its around a months shipping time for most bulky items
between US and Oz (assuming its sent by ship - Aircraft are the equivalent
of X-boats for ourt purposes). Or the equivalent of two Jumps. Makes you
think, eh?

	Actually you can have an A starport on a TL 5 world & a B 
starport on a TL 3 world if the planet has a type D (Religious 
Dictatorship) government (TL modifier -2) & no positive modifiers due to 
other factors, so the problem is even worse than you state.

	My post quite clearly said & you quoted & I requote "The routine 
maintenance may be performed at any type A or B starport rule is WRONG & 
should be changed.

	Yes, of course anything Marc Miller says is more canonical than 
anything anyone else says, especially if it is the rulebook itself, 
double especially if it is multiple rulebooks, but I disagree with this 
rule because it_does_not_make_sense.  The MegaTraveller Journal example 
did make sense & that is why I quoted it.

	Why is there any difference between importing higher TL starship 
parts that are only available from 1 source in the sector (TL 16 parts 
from Vincennes) & importing TL 15 starship parts that are only available 
from a handful of worlds in some(ie Spinward Marches)sectors. Or 
importing TL 12 parts from Sylea (the only TL 12 Starport A world 
described so far) in Milleau 0.

	Yes I guess I am arguing with Marc Miller & I guess I owe you an 
apology for arguing with you. However you advanced the notion that tech 
levels are meaningless partially based on this rule which I think is 
wrong & this is why I was responding to your argument.  Besides I\'m not 
sure that I dare to argue with Marc Miller - I feel like a devout 
Catholic arguing theology with the Pope : )

	I think this rule is wrong & I think anyone who stops to think 
about it will realize this.  Yes the rulebooks say differently but so 
what.  All the rulebooks have had some errata ( ie errors).  It is not 
at all unreasonable to assume that this is just one of those errors that 
has been with us ever since CT & has not been fixed because no one has 
pointed out why it is wrong, that is part of the reason I\'m discussing 
it now.

	By definition a type B starport cannot build jump capable ships 
but can build non Jump capable ships.  The ONLY difference between a 
Jump capable ship & a non Jump capable ship is the Jump drive (& the 
hull grid) therefore QED Type B starports cannot make Jump Drives.

	Now I realize that most of the time annual maintenance will only 
require routine maintenance of the Jump drive & that a type B starport 
can do this just fine.  What I am saying is that the Jump Drive can wear 
out (In TNE terms aquire a high wear value) before the rest of the ship. 
 Then it will need replacing & since you might not KNOW the drive was 
that bad until they looked inside it during maintenance I would not want 
to schedule the maintenance for_my_ship at a type B starport, just in 
case the problem came up. It could just be that I am sensative to this 
problem because the group I play with tends to be hard on ships or 
perhaps our referee  (Hi Will) tends to designs things so that our Jump 
drives tend to wear out.

Also, unlike previous versions of Traveller, Marines no longer get Gunnery
as one of their skills, thus reducing their usefulness aboard Naval vessels.
(In the "old" days, for example, marines served as gunners aboard naval
vessels).
I have decided to make an \'official\' change in this regard, and am altering
#3 under Service Skills on the Marine character generation charts. This was
originally Gun Combat, and still leaves Marine characters with 2 other Gun
Combat entries on their charts. (Most of the "good skills" seem to occur twice).
        This was put out there for your consideration and use. Enjoy!

Sounds like a good change, Allen (hey, I\'m as much of a grognard as the 
next guy[G]).  But, I\'m curious: do you plan on changing the Navy 
character generation to get rid of the Gunnery skills there, or will both 
have that skill available?

Perhaps put melee combat under Physical, and either Pilot or another 
entry of Technical under Career?  Hmmm.

A good example of these points is from _Hammer\'s Slammers_, where 
the Slammers are unloading on an agri-world and meet up with an ex-
Slammer on crutches who has settled there:

        "Hey, Blacky," he continued with concern, "what\'s wrong with
your legs? We got the best there was."
        "Oh, thery\'re fine," Rob heard the old man reply, "but they need a 
weekly tuning. Out here we don\'t have the computers, you know; so I
get the astrogation boys to sync me up on the ships\' hardware when-
ever one docks in--just waiting for a chance now. But in six months
the servos are far enough out of line that I have to shut off the power
till the next ship arrives. You\'d be surprised how well I get around
on these pegs, though..."

First off, as one gets more aware of the *real* costs of waste
disposal, and recycling gets better, the incentive to fix rather than
throw away goes up. There *is* a cost to the "just throw it out"
culture, and I rather expect that an interstellar society will have
learned this (the hard way if nothing else!).

Second, while it may "cost" $25 of tech time to fix the $10 part,
importing the part may cost more. And even if it *doesn\'t*, you also
have to consider the cost of the downtime of the system (or *ship*!)
that the component is part of. That can run into thousands an hour. 

Also, if the local starport has to import parts, then "recycling"
modules by salvageing the good parts *is* good use of manpower. And
that means that having a tech repairing modules with salvaged parts is
*also* good use of resources. If nothing else, it gives low-level techs
practice on higher tech systems, and keeps them busy during slack times.

So if the parts aren\'t produced locally, but *are* "standardized"
modules, then repair *is* a good idea. After all, the port *will* have
to have the gear to test modules to make sure that they are ok for use,
thus repairing modules by swapping parts *is* doable, even if they
can\'t *make* the parts.

A chip that is "burned out" isn\'t fixable. But a chip that has had a
connection between the actual "chip" and the connectors in the chip
carrier fail *is* repairable. And at a lot lower tech level (and
expense) than making or importing a new one. All you need is a way to
open the carrier non-destructively, a clean room, and the right
"welding" technology to re-attach the wire.

The same goes for things like Hard drives. Some of us "poor folk"
repair obsolete HDs by finding ones with bad media, and using the
circuit board to repair ones with bad boards. There are companies that
do the same thing, because it *is* cheap. They also open drives that
have bad media, salvage any platters that are still ok, and rebuild
drives from the salvaged platters and repaired circuit boards.

This is done right here in the US. I\'m willing to bet that countries
that can\'t make HDs use the board swap trick rather than import new
drives. And ones that have the ability to repair the circuit boards
will do that, as it\'s still cheaper than a new drive. I\'m not too sure
that there are many places that can salvage media but not construct
drives. 

Do note that in Traveller, *any* spaceport will have "clean room"
capability, simply by going into space a ways (to get away from the
crud the ships leave around). Or by playing games with life support
gear. 

Oh yeah, on worlds that still use Vacuum Tube technology, if there\'s
significant traffic thru the port, there *will* be a high port, with a
vacuum tube factory in it. Transporting the parts and workers will be
worth it for the high quality vacuum. If the traffic is lower (thus
requiring "dedicated" shuttle flights to/from the facility) there won\'t
be a factory, but there will be a research facility. After all, it\'s
*much* simpler to work on experimental designs by wearing a suit and
just having the anode, cathode, grid, etc in an evacuated compartment.
Adjustments become simple matters instead of a complex mess.

Oh yeah, I expect that Atm 0 worlds may use vacuum tube technology for
some things simply because it\'s easier to maintain that the more
advanced stuff. At least, easier for *them*.

Better try comparing *ships*. You\'ll find that it\'ll take a *lot* of
tech levels difference before you can\'t get the work done. For example,
you could probably get the Monitor or the Merrimac worked on at any
modern shipyard as long as you had a copy of the plans. They\'d just
*make* the parts. Machining them would be no trouble, not for yards
that can produce/repair things like modern steam turbines. 

You\'d still be able to get wooden-hulled sailing ships fixed too, as
folks still use similar things for pleasure craft. 

So likewise, repairing lower tech level ships is doable. They\'re liable
to wind up *making* parts if they don\'t get many ships of your tech
level, but that *won\'t* be hard. 

Real world example. Since it\'s so hard to get the tubes needed for
restoring some classic radios, and the demand isn\'t high enough to get
manufacturers to start producing them, there are modules you can buy
that plug into the tube socket and work just like one. They use various
*modern* parts to achieve the same effect, and don\'t cost huge amounts
of money. 

That\'s the key here. Where the module isn\'t readily avialable due to
being much lower tech, a higher tech replacement can *easily* be made
at a cost that won\'t be that much out of line. If it later fails while
you are at an lower tech port, big deal. You just replace it with the
"right" part.

Believe me, if there were any significant number of ships of a given
design made, there *will* be replacement parts available. At higher
tech ports they may be small modules inside a much large "case" shaped
to fit the assembly properly. But they\'ll exist. 

Going back to your example of cars, you *can* buy parts for a Model A.
You have a choice of "original" parts (very expensive and hard to
find), "reproduction" parts (ones made in the same manner and to the
same specs), and "replacement" parts.

Original and repro are as alike as can be managed, though collectors
prefer original parts if they can get them. Replacement parts are made
by modern methods, using modern tech, and are likely to look rather
strange bolted onto the old parts. But they work. If you want to get
really silly you can put a solid state ignition system on an old Model
A or Model T. Though that does require adding something equivalent to
the aftermarket "electric starter" kits that were available back then. :-)

Unless you did something stupid, they\'d discover that it needs
replacing of <some major subassembly> "soon". Otherwise your engineer
would have noticed something. And in that case, you try to figure if
you can get it to a Class A port "soon".

One the other hand, with a TL-9 ship, you can get the work done almost
anywhere, but you may get a few strange looks. "You\'re flying a *what*?!"

Very good point. Nobody wants to be vulnerable to a "single point
failure". Though because the *starport* wouldn\'t want that to happen, I
expect that there would be multiple widely seperated power plants,
*and* a power grid tying them together so you can do maintenance on
yours without having to do without.

Regardless of the way most of the locals feel about it, I rather expect
that the "startown" that will grow up just outside the extrality line
*will* use starport generated power.

Which is why *any* "centralized" system *must* have cross connects
*and* surplus capacity. 
    
> Finally, for those that might say "but electricity isn\'t hot water",

I know a lot of folks who\'d *love* to buy one of the radioisotope power
packs that have been built to power some isolated weather and defense
installations. They\'ll power a typical household (and have power left
over!) for about 40 years before the power output drops to 50% of the
original. And they are *zero* maintenance.

But I rather suspect that when some sort of "do-it-yourself" power
becomes common, we\'ll keep the power grid, simply because it lets you
sell excess power, and draw extra power if you need it. And also so
that if your unit breaks down, you aren\'t in the dark. The fancier
meter required isn\'t *that* much more expensive. Of course, part of
this depends on what happens to current laws that *require* power
companies to purchase excess power generated by customers if the
customers want to sell it.

Still, I think that it makes sense for small towns, and neighborhoods
to form a "power co-op" and pool their power. And they can even choose
to tie in to adjacent co-ops to average things out further. You pay
into the co-op if you use more power than you generate. You get paid if
you generate more than you use. Of course, this means that if the co-op
produces a net excess they have to find a market for it. If they can\'t,
there\'s no extra money. Likewise, if they have a net shortfall, they\'ll
need to be able to make it up by buying excess from somewhere.

I don\'t think long distance power distribution grids will be
economical. But local grids will be. And if the local grids  keep
running short *someone* will upgrade their generator, or else one of
the co-ops will pool money to buy an extra one. I suspect that the most
likely scenario will be folks getting a loan from the co-op to pay for
a generator upgrade. They\'ll pay it off in installments, minus any
credits they get for for the excess power.

There\'s no guarantee that this is the way it\'ll happen, but it is
definitely the most *sensible* way to do things. 

Oh yeah, the generators will likely include some sort of batteries for
load leveling and backup. Say a Gigajoule or so. 220 volts times 200
amps = 44 kW. Multiply by 86400 seconds in a day gives 3.8 GW-seconds
or 3.8 Gj. I figure that on average a house uses only 1/4 of the
maximum possible load (probably a *lot* less), so that gives us 1
gigajoule of "backup". And a max output of the generator of 10 kW or
so. The combo would keep the generator running at constant load, while
you draw power from the batteries. 

Excess goes to the co-op. If the generator dies, or you need excess
power for an extended period then you start drawing power from the
co-op to charge the batteries.

Anybody with the design rules want to design such a household power
system and post the results? I expect that the vehicle rules will give
us a ballpark figure, but I also expect it to be very much on the
*high* end, as the household plant can be bigger and heavier as it
isn\'t going to be moving.

What I\'d be interested in is size, cost, and fuel consumption at
various tech levels.

Better recheck the real world. Most of Africa, and a lot of Asia is
*skipping* "phone lines" and going straight to cellular phones with
satellite links between cities. It\'s *cheaper* to build that sort of
infrastructure, than to build the sort we have with hardwired lines all
over the place!

You have to but in cell sites, and link them with trunks or microwave
links. You\'d have to do the same with phone exchanges and "line
concentrators" in a wireline setup. But in a wireline setup, you\'d
*also* have to run wires to every subscriber, and add a lot of power
capability to support the load that their phones put on the network.
The copper *alone* is hideously expensive. To say nothing of the labor
in stringing the lines.

So the biggest cities have both hard-wired phones and cell phones. The
smaller cities are getting *just* cell phones. And the governments are
moving towards adding a satellite phone or a small cell site to every
village. That way they get the communications infrastructure at a
fraction of the cost of doing it the old way. And they can use the same
satellite link to bring in things like educational radio and TV to help
teach the villagers. 

I fully expect similar things to happen in Traveller. Any planet that
has regular contact with spacers will likely buy something like the
Motorola Iridium satellite phone system rather than deploy wire all
over the place. They\'ll reserve hardwired links for things like some
military needs.

"Low tech" planets that have been in contact with high tech planets for
a while are apt to be *very* strange by our standards. Picture the Wild
West with cell phones or satellite phones available. Or picture the
Middle Ages or earlier with commanders of armies (at least) being able
to communicate *real time* with both each other and with their
king/emperor/whatever. 

Remember, something like the Iridium system is dirt cheap at even M0
tech levels (It\'s expected to cost less than $100 million *now*). Cheap
enough that it\'d probably be installed for the convenience of high tech
visitors if the place has a permanent port.  Selling phones and
batteries (or small solar panels) to natives is then a matter of "why
not"? It\'ll bring in some cash, and won\'t hurt the high tech folks.

This can be played to good advantage to surprise players. After
crashing in the wilderness of some planet, they could get found by
nomads and negotiate for transport to the port, only to later find out
that the "chief" of the tribe has a phone and could have called the
port to pick them up. He didn\'t mention it because he saw no reason to.
Or because he figured that if they were *that* ignorant, he\'d just take
the profit and not "confuse" matters with such "irrelevant" details.

Picture the players being properly impressed with how well he can
predict the weather, and then as they are parting at the port asking
him about it, and being told "Oh, I just call up the weather forecast
from the port...." :-)

I\'m on a *very* limited budget. And I don\'t want to get into the usual
SF Boookclub mess where I forget to return a card or return one late
and wind up owing for books I don\'t want. Or is it now possible to just
order books from them without the monthly selections bit?

I think he\'s going with the fact that Class B ports are specifically
described as *not* being able to build jump capable craft, while Class
A ports can.

STARLINERS (Working Title)

CONCEPT

  A 96 page sourcebook detailing passage on commercial starliners. The book
would cover a variety of topics, including booking flights, accomodations,
life aboard a deep space commercial vessel, security, starports, and so on.
It would aso include writeups/backgrounds of several commercial carrier
copanies and commercial starliner ship designs (including deck plans).

  The book could be used in any Era, but would be written to compliment IG\'s
line of books. We could also throw in more detail about the Traveller\'s Aid
Society, including members-only lounges at starports, etc.

  We would like to find an author for the project asap.

want to have a look.

In the first editions of Traveller, using gas giants as fuel was referred
to as "wilderness refueling", so this makes sense.  The situation might be
different somewhere like Regina, where the mainworld is the moon of a gas
giant, but I haven\'t done the math.

Both should.  The Marines only manned *some* of the gunnery decks in the
old days -- most weapons should be manned by naval personnel from the 
Gunnery department.  It seems to me this made sense, especially since the
bay and turret weapons were similar to energy weapons that might be found
on Marine vehicles.  Of course, this could be a change that was instituted
years after the founding of the Imperium.

I bought a copy of _The Demolished Man_ here in Chicago a couple of
days ago for only US$5.00. (Okay, okay, US$5.44 including tax. :-) 
There were at least a dozen more copies on the shelves at the same 
price.

I found it at a terrific SF book store called, of all things, "The 
Stars *Our* Destination".

Their web address is

Their e-mail address is

Might be worth it to you to drop \'em a note.

Since the Navy characters had Gunnery in every other version of Traveller, I
think I\'ll let them continue to have it. Only the larger Naval ships have
Marine Gunners as I understand it, so someone has to be able to fire the
guns on the smaller ships!
        HOWEVER: after looking at the old Traveller Book and the Basic
Character Generation tables in MegaTraveller, I was surprised to find that
Marines didn\'t get Gunnery under those systems either! Marines got Gunnery
skill in Book 4: Mercenary and the Advanced character creation rules in MT.
So the fact that they didn\'t have it in T4 doesn\'t surprise me now, but I
still feel they should have it, so I\'m still making the change.
        See? If you don\'t like something about the game, CHANGE IT! You can
do that; it\'s ok!
        However, I did make a mistake when I said where the change was
taking place. For the sake of clarity, it comes in entry 3 of the CAREER table.

>Perhaps put melee combat under Physical, and either Pilot or another 
>entry of Technical under Career?  Hmmm.

Marines do not have Melee Combat in their CAREER table; they have blade
combat, which represents their cutlass training. I don\'t think they should
have Pilot; that makes them a little TOO much like Naval characters at that
point.

Sorry, I was talking about making those changes to the Naval charts, to 
get rid of the gunnery skill (which, obviously, isn\'t something you want 
to do), not the Marine charts...

Flexibility and reaction times. Local commanders had to keep checking with 
their bosses, which could take months. Given time, the Vilani could have 
adapted to the Terran tactics, but by the time the leaders had got the 
orders to the front, the war was already over.

I may be alone in this, but I really think that defining TLs in historical
terms is a major mistake. I think TLs should be defined in terms of the
items that can be produced. This can obviously be the same way that they
were produced in the one historical sample we have to look at, but this is
not IMO the _only_ way it can be done. As an example, I have a world with
a powerful social abhorrence of mass-production. They don\'t mind high-tech
items, but only as long as they are hand-made. Obviously this cuts down on
the number of computers and grav vehicles they have (And on imports, too).
This is not really an argument against your main point; said world doesn\'t
have a Class A or B starport either.

No, wait a minute here. Even if your thesis is 100% right, we can only
conclude that the maintenance rule is incompatible with the fact that the
background has all these low- to medium-tech worlds with A or B starports.
I don\'t agree with your automatic assumption that changing the background
is preferable to changing the maintenance rule.

OK.

First unproven assumption. You might just as well argue that since they
_don\'t_ have the high tech then they obviously _don\'t_ appreciate the
tech ("What was good enough for my grandpoppa is good enough for be, begad!")

Well, for one thing, their average income is about Cr4000/year (_Striker_ 
says Cr2000, but that wouldn\'t allow them to survive). For another, their 
money is worth only 56% of that when they buy imported stuff. That is really
the main problem. The _average_ citizen can\'t afford it. You\'re quite right
in you claim that the world leaders will be driving grav cars and their
bodyguards packing laser guns, but a TL is indicative of what the average
guy is using.

I know that TCS implies that the capacity of a starport always is 
proportional to the population of the world it is on, but that must be
a simplification for the purposes of running TCS campaigns. It is quite
likely that a class B starport on TL 5 world is very small compared to
the total population of the world.

Yes, it will be there, but it won\'t be there in quantity, because the world
can\'t afford to import it in quantity. If they could afford to import it in
quantity, it would be a TL 12 world!

>- and, inevitably, because of the nature of the society that produces a 
>sustainable TL of 5+, it will spread and spread rapidly! 

It will spread only if the people of the world can afford to buy it. And
since the world is TL 5, obviously they couldn\'t afford it. I don\'t see any
contradictions in that.

Ah, if you can demonstrate that, then I will have to consider revising my
ideas on the subject (Though I may want to try making the computer more
expensive rather than mess up the whole Traveller background). But can you?

And have you considered the possibility that the comparative price of a TL
12 computer and a TL 5 mechanical calculator is germane only if the average 
citizen can afford a mechanical calculator in the first place? Remember that
average food and average lodging alone costs Cr3600 per year.

That\'s not quite true (though almost). _Striker_ impose a blanket doubling
of maintenance costs for all kinds of equipment if it is imported higher-
tech. And TCS impose double time and cost for jump-drive repairs at Class
B starports and forbids repairs of anything of higher than local TL.

No, but the fact that a rule contradicts something in the background
dosen\'t automatically mean that it\'s the background that should be changed.
To the contrary, my opinion is that if at all possible, the rules should
be amended to support the background (Though I have to admit that this is
not, alas, always possible).

It looks like you\'ve lost track of the previous thread. My original point
was that the worlds of Corridor Sector had a big slice of their naval budget
freed in early 1117 when the whole Corridor Fleet went corewards. Suddenly
they are not supporting those ships any more. In effect, they HAVE just lost
their entire fleet (except for the rather sizable fraction of non-jump
capable ships). The estimates I came up with were on what they could build 
with all those suddenly-available resources and how fast they could do it.

BTW. TCS dosen\'t say anything about replacements. I guess that in a standard
TCS campaign the point is moot because ships tend to be shot up rather than
to wear out, but my opinion is that part of the 10% maintenance figure pays
for replacement ships. I\'d say something like 2% per year.

Unless I\'m mistaken, Armor rating for ships created using the SSDS
need to be multiplied by 10 to make them compatable with ships
created with the QSDS.  Basically the paragraph for calculating a
ship\'s USP armor rating should read something like this:

Armor
Convert the armor value chosen using the USP Conversion chart below
and then multiply by 10.

Oxygen is not actually carried in any significant quantity.  The existing
oxygen/nitrogen atmosphese in the ship is \'scrubbed\' of CO2 by the life
support system.  I imagine that a reserve of atmospheric gasses already
mixed (i.e. Nitrogen/oxygen - can\'t breathe pure O2 after all) is also
kept.  Certainly not a big enough reserve to be making H2O out of.

and heat and light, is ther any way to combine Oxygen and Hydrogen to make
water without creating an explosion?  This is a bit of a drawback (though 
not a big one).

Good thought.  The fuel purifier on starships could probably be adapted to
purify the (drinking or other) water supply when not needed to remove
impurities from Hydrogen, or crack water into H2 (H3?).  Problem is you\'d
need a storage tank or be without water for 1-2 days (again, not a big
problem).   

Dovetailing with the parrallel thread on \'Glop\' I still feel that on a
starship which is supposed to travel only 2-4 weeks between stops the
amount of space devoted to life support/waste recycling can be reduced by
storing most of the waste, recycling the water, and pumping out the waste
at the next stopover (at the same time changing/recharging the other LS
equipment; air scrubbers, water filters, etc).  

Turning human waste (of all types) into edible food (and breathable air) 
requires a fairly extensive, volumnous closed ecosystem.  It can be done,
and is not too difficult, but my guess after researching the subject (in
an admittedly shallow way) for a Glisten campaign (asteroid world) is that
about 4 dtons of space is required for each person on board *just for life
support and waste recycling*.  This amount is multiplied by about 1.2 to
allow for visitors and safety margins, as well as to sell some resource to
passing starships (remember that 1000cr per person fee for LS recharges?).

For a ship to have such a support system would also require additional
personnel to tend to the "Gardens". 

Conclusion;  People seem to have their own systems, which are usable,
believable, and fine, but I think that typical starships will find it more
economical space-wise to reuse only water and air, while storing other
wastes, rather than trying to run their own ecosystem within the ship.
Even the Glop from CSC seems to require a \'tank\' of significant size to
reprocess the waste.

Well, it depends, I suppose.  Although Zhodani are honest to a fault within Zhodani 
society, they might not be when living in the Imperium.  ("When in Rome, act as the 
Romans do.")  For example, in wartime, Zhodani forces make use of surprises and ruses 
just as well as anyone else (maybe better, hence the scenario\'s title "Perfidious 
Zhodane" in Azhanti High Lightning), and these surely require dishonesty.  If they can 
lie in war, surely they can lie in love.  

With non-Zhodani psionic significant others, you certainly run the described risk.

Allied prisoners in German POW camps (and by high school chums and I). 

Die Gedanken sind frei
Wer kann sie erraten?
Sie fliegen vorbei
Wie naechtliche Schatten.

I don\'t remember the rest.  (Thoughts are free;/ who can guess them?/ They fly away/ 
light nightly (or night-like) shadows.)  It would be a good song in the Fifth Frontier 
War context, I think, although somewhat more ambiguous.  The Imperial prisoners might 
sing it and mean, you don\'t have the resources to read every single mind at every 
moment.  The Zhodani prisoners might sing it and mean, you deadheads don\'t have a clue 
what we\'re thinking about.

We can usually find a Traveller hook, hence my response to the list, but your local 
educational institutions often have foreign language departments, whose faculty and 
students are often willing to answer simple questions.  The reference sections of many 
libraries contain foreign language dictionaries, too, although without knowing the 
grammar, you might not find them completely helpful.

There are some things that I don\'t want to know.  This makes me think of a scene in 
one of Larry Niven\'s books, probably Ringworld, in which the puppeteers have set up the 
interior of one of their starships for human use.  They\'ve very efficiently put the 
toilet and galley side-by-side, so that no long hoses are needed to connect the waste 
treatment and reclamation unit from the food production unit.  The humans, as I recall, 
are not pleased, but just shrug it off with a comment like, well, that is efficient.

Your universe is a really alien place.  I don\'t think that we\'re going to give 
up washing in water.  It\'s part of the aesthetics that make space travel bearable.  
There\'s also no shortage of water -- starships are, well, flush with water because of 
their fuel requirements.

My comments to the foregoing to the contrary nothwithstanding, if you\'re going to

help get all of the particles to clump together and end up in the same place.  Then you 
can vacuum them out into space.

No, starships have lots of water available from the fuel (liquid hydrogen, which should 
be convertible to water; just add oxygen and do it in a safe place).  The used water is 
then purified and returned to the fuel tanks.

Bear in mind that the "old" days are actually 1100 years in the future.  At that time, 
Marines routinely received gunnery training, just in case they had to help the naval 
gunners.  This custom has its roots in Arbellatra\'s naval reforms following the Civil 
War (which ended about -- what -- 600?  I do need books in the office).

The Navy, as you recall, was the Bad Guy in the Civil War, as various admirals fought 
for the Iridium Throne.  The Marines were mostly just along for the ride (or were so 
perceived), and had no choice but to follow orders from their immediate naval superiors. 

After the war, Arbellatra separated the Marines even farther from the Navy, making them 
more directly responsible to central Imperial authority.  This process was stopped 
before Marines became "political officers" as seen in the Soviet Union, but the Marines 
were something of a check on the Navy.  

Immediately after the Civil War, all naval ships\' guns were placed under the control of 
the "loyal" Marines.  The Marines were ideally suited to the task, being already present 
on ships, heavily armed with anti-personnel weapons and superior armor, and part of a 
different command structure.  Over time, of course, fear of a naval coup diminished, and 
the Navy got control of its guns again.  Marines still went to gunnery school "just in 
case", however.  By the CT era, the "just in case" is "just in case the gunnery crew all 
get killed in action."  

In Year 0, naval control of the guns wasn\'t a concern, so the Marines don\'t get gunnery 
training.

- --Glenn 


I have decided to make an \'official\' change in this regard, and am altering
#3 under Service Skills on the Marine character generation charts. This was
originally Gun Combat, and still leaves Marine characters with 2 other Gun
Combat entries on their charts. (Most of the "good skills" seem to occur twice).
        This was put out there for your consideration and use. Enjoy!

I thought that my players would by now have thrown everything at me, but I\'ve never 
thought about this in nearly 20 years of Travelling.  

Maybe it\'s in the fresher?  Most apartments in Finland (and maybe the rest of Europe; I 
only know about Finnish apartments) have a very small washing machine that fits in the 
bathtub (actually above the bathtub; it has things that rest on the sides of the 
bathtub) ("things" -- now that\'s a good, precise, technical term).  A hose connects the 
faucet to the washing machine, and the machine of course runs on household current.  It 
drains directly into the bathtub.  It washes a small load of laundry -- like one pair of 
pants, a couple of shirts, several sets of socks and underwear.  When not in use, the 
washing machine is usually stored in the same closet as the towels.  

Until we get a solution that I like better, I\'m retrofitting all of my ships with the 
Asuntopesukone (apartmentwashmachine), made by Ling Standard Products (Maytag Division), 
Naasirika, and many other companies.

Actually I would suspect that the Corridor Sector would still be
supporting the fleet even thought it was move out of sector.  IMHO,
the taxes collected to support the fleet would just be sent along
behind it and would not be available for Corridor to build a new
fleet with.

This debate grew out of the "Annual Starship Maintenance thread", if I\'m
not mistaken, so let me tell you how *I* run things in my games.

1.  Starships and their components are field repairable.  Just about
anything that breaks, a competent Engineer can repair, patch, or work
around without a Starport\'s facilities.  Because the Starship\'s components
are *designed* for field repairability, they are larger, heavier, more
rugged, and lower tech than you might expect.  You don\'t pull a bad part
and chunk it, you FIX IT!  (Think about what that means to electronics for
example.  That\'s why the damn computers are so huge.  ;-)

2.  Although a Starport isn\'t required for repairs it makes for easier,
faster, more sure repairs.  They *are* required if you want to do a
complete overhaul of a ship or if YOU DON\'T HAVE A COMPETENT ENGINEER
ABOARD.  They also give you access to replacement components when you can\'t
fix the darn thing anymore...and when you have the credits to pay for them. 
Rare components, and they can be rare due to tech level, non-standard
design, the port\'s level, or the GM\'s decision (my favorite!), cost more.

3.  Starport ratings are a *guide* to what the player can *expect* to find
in that system...they aren\'t sure things.  (Technology and Government
ratings are also guides, don\'t let the players be *too* sure of them.)

What the ratings mean is that the last time the system was surveyed there
was:

    A - A sufficient technological base available so that an
        Engineer (or someone he hires locally) could repair
        anything, including the jump drive, and perform a complete
        ship overhaul, if necessary.  There *probably* is a
        starship-building facility.  There *probably* are components
        to replace those that you have fixed and patched and babied
        for months.  Refined fuel should be available.
         
    B - A sufficient technological base available so that an
        Engineer could repair anything, including *maybe* the jump
        drive, and could hire someone to fix *most* things.  A
        complete ship overhaul will take more time, cost more, and
        demand more direct effort from the Engineer herself.  There
        *probably* is a spaceship-building facility.  There *might*
        be components available to replace those you\'ve been fixing,
        patching, and cursing for months.  Refined fuel is most
        likely available.
        
    C - A sufficient technological base available so that an
        Engineer can repair, or contract for the repair of, major
        structural damage to a ship.  There is probably no
        spaceship-building facility, but *perhaps* there are
        drydocks and a few other repair facilities available.  The
        Engineer can repair most other components, but will receive
        little assistance from the local facilities or technicians.
        It is unlikely that components to replace unrepairable or
        heavily patched parts will be available, so you\'ll just have
        to keep working around the problems as best you can.
        Refined fuel is possible, but unlikely.  Unrefined fuel
        should be available.
        
    D,F,G - A sufficient technological base available so that an
            Engineer can repair minor structural damage to the ship.
            There is no spaceship-building facility, and very few
            (if any) local facilities. No trained personnel will be
            available to assist the Engineer.  Rarely will new
            components be available.  Refined fuel will not be
            available.  Unrefined fuel *probably* will be available.
        
    E,X,H,Y - No technological base is assumed.  The Engineer is
              pretty much on his on.  No new components or fuel can
              be assumed to be available.
        
4.  There are exceptions to *everything*, and nothing is sure. There may be
a Class A port listed, but when the players arrive they find that it isn\'t
available anymore:  destroyed, downgraded, or made off-limits by the local
authorities.  OTOH, that Class C port might have the services of Class B or
A port now.  The GM shouldn\'t change things on every site, but throwing in
an occasional curve is good for the players.

5.  The area surrounding a Starport will have technology approaching the
Starport IF the local authorities allow for technological exchange.  If
they don\'t, and many of the government types won\'t, then don\'t expect
"Startown" to be "just like Sylea."  As you move away from the port area
the indigenous technologies will dominate, however expect the occasional
\'high tech\' item here and there on any world frequented by Starships.

6.  The 1000cr/ton is a guideline, not a law.  Buyers and sellers have the
rule of thumb, that all things considered it should cost about 1000cr/ton
to transport goods from system to system.  The *actual* amount will be
whatever the market (ie GM) will bear.

7.  If fact, *most* things are guidelines, not laws.

Low-tech, you can burn hydrogen like you would natural gas, or

They did the same in Latvia few years ago.  Curiously, the original plan
called for cellular phone service in the countryside and regular
wire-based service in the major urban areas, which were already largely
wired.  They (I think it was Deutsche Telekom, but I\'m not sure) found,
however, that the cost of upgrading the existing wiring in the urban
areas was prohibitively expensive, so they went with cellular there, and
left the old wiring in place.  At the same time, they found that the cost
of upgrading wiring in the rural areas (which had a fair amount of it,
but nothing like Europe or the USA) was cheaper than a new cellular
installation, so they went with wiring there.  Thus the original plan was
completely reversed, to everyone\'s satisfaction.

This isn\'t too far removed from the Russian Far East or some of the newly independent

  I can assure you, as a publisher, that interior color plates would add to

pay for the art itself. It makes sense to have them in a core product that

look pretty, there are cost-to-profit ratios to consider. Personally, I would
rather they spend the money on more supplements with B&W art.

linked/related or not). We would certianly like to publish a lot of
adventures for T4. We enjoy the game, and want to provide a means for more
folks to enjoy it as well.

The players in my game, 4 detatched duty scouts, would probably laugh at the
idea.
Their bi-weekly grunge contests are *legendary* ( in my group anyway !)

They like the TAS (or other establishments) to really earn the cost of board
& lodgings..

Does anybody else have this problem with scouts?
(It is pretty much akin to some of the antics done by members of my old unit
on maneuvers! Is this why the used to call us the Pongos ?)

I like this idea.  It reminds me of a similiar project done by Judges 
Guild for CT.  

If the project was done well and looked good, I\'d buy it.

[cough]  Uh, you did realize that post of mine which you are responding 
to was a joke, right?  The by line was "Lam Poon." :)  I didn\'t expect a 
serious response.

I like it, a lot.  One recommendation though, deckplans, Real Deckplans,
GOOD DECKPLANS.  Also Deckplans for the lounges would be nice.  Also it
would be nice if it were well written.  As for art, all I care about is
simple art that complements the (you guessed it) DECKPLANS.

Seriously I think it would be great, and actually mean what I say in the
previous paragraph.

The one change I\'ve made in the Marine career is that instead of learning to
use a Cutless, all Marines learn BattleDress-1.  I have tried to justify why
a force that fights in powered armor with high-energy plasma weapons would
bother training it\'s recruits swordplay; and I just can\'t.  I asked a former
member of the USMC Silent drill Team if he knew how to use a sword in
combat, and he replied that it was all for show, though some members did
take up saber as a hobby.

As for Marines on Navy ships.. I think that their battlestations would be as
damage control parties and in the missle magazines.  Both are jobs that call
for brute strength under Naval guidance.  A typical damage control team
might be a Navy CPO leading some Marines to do quicky patches on systems so
the ship can continue fighting.  Also, Marines in BattleDress make excellent
SAR workers in areas that have sustained heavy structural damage.

In the magazine, Marine move the missles from their racks to the
elevator/loading queue/arming room.  Once again, experience with augmented
exoskeletons will be a plus.

My fellow gamers,

There comes a time when one must stand up and be counted.  This is one of
those times.  I walked into 5 stores looking for CSC and Aliens today.  Not
only did none of the stores have them, but 2 of them didn\'t know that
Traveller had been re-released by IG.

This is the sad state of affairs that we find ourselves in.  You might ask
why I am concerned about this.  I am concerned because every one of us that
loves the game of Traveller should be concerned.  In a time that the gaming
industry is waivering, and the future of our game is in question; someone
must take steps to ensure our game of Traveller survives.

What can we do you ask?  You are thinking that you are only one gamer or a
small group that meets once a week.  What can you do?  The answer is simple.

A grass root uprising in support of our game.  Marc might own the copywrit,
IG owns the publishing rights; but it is our game...yours and mine.  We play
it.  It is our hobby, we have helped make it into what it is today.

You are thinking what can we do? I\'ll tell you.

Tell people about T4.  Show one new person per week the game.  Go to every
store that should carry the game and ask them for it.  If you are running a
game, invite a new person to it.  If you are not running a game start one.
Why you ask?

Because without new players the future of the game is ....(You thought Virus
was bad.)  You are probably wondering about IG about now.  To tell you the
truth so am I.  They should be leading the way in this fight.  Don\'t be
fooled, there is a war on and our game hangs in the balance.  IG should be
in the lead in this campaign but they are not.  They are AWOL.  So what do
we do?  Do we let them ruin our game by their lack of leadership?  I say
no..NO..NO!

Join the movement to save the game.  Don\'t worry about IG, let Marc fight
the battle with them about why they are not advertising.  Again, I challenge
each one of you (500+) to show the game to one new person each week...invite
a new player to your game...visit your local game store and talk up the game
to the owner.  

It is a dark time, it may be our last chance.  Travellers what will it be?
Do you love the game enough to work to save it?  Only time will tell.

I step down from my soap box.  I break the box into small pieces.  I
shoulder my sign "Traveller is Back" and look behind me to see who is
following....

Not for a few years, IIRC.

Why would you want them this desperately?  I assume you have most 
of the old material?  Why not just convert the stuff?

Who says you can\'t use old background material with new rules?  Or 
vice versa, for that matter.  I for one, am looking forward to seeing 
the development of other spots on the timeline, not just the same old 
game I\'ve known for years.

many naval archatects.
IMHO The designs in "Starships" are significant designs, not exclusive 
designs.  
2/  I recall a 15mm APC, by Martian Metals with optional Wheels,Tracks, or

    'body' => 'Some comments have been made to the effect that Starships would never want
to carry out yearly maintenance at a type B Starport because said Starport
cannot make J-Drives ... and that any *major* problem with said ship\'s
J-drives would immobilise the vessel until a new drive could be brought in
from outside.

A couple of perceptive replies have pointed out the obvious -- any Engineer
worth his salt will have detected the warning signs of such a major problem
well before maintenance was due and would have made arrangements to do
*this* maintenance stop at a Class A Port.

However, the problem set me to thinking.

It brought to mind something I read a while ago about a particular model US
groundcar with EFI and how, unlike *earlier* models (lower tech?) black box
controllers which, when dying, took the whole engine down with them (as I
can attest from personal, and recent, experience!), immobilising the car
until replaced, these new controllers actually had at least one level of
"default" setting that was absolutely rock-bottom simple ... maximised
chances of operating (to 100%, in fact) at the cost of running *very*
"rich" (and guzzling fuel). According to the article, Mechanics often had
real trouble convincing the owners that there was anything wrong -- a
common comment was evidently "Its never run better, but the fuel
consumption has gone up."

So, what\'s the relevance of this? Well, with something as vital as a
J-Drive, surely there would be more than one level of circuitry built in?
Surely there would be redundant levels that would allow full functionality
when the primary levels die? Almost certainly at least one level on
Civilian Starships and more than one on Military vessels.

Beyond these initial levels of redundancy, what is there likely to be?
Well, I would suggest that each level of "failure" beyond the main backups
would simply be set to allow the vessel to do something like what the EFI
blackbox did ... in other words, each level of failure simply drops the
J-Rating of the Drive one level. Since a considerable number of vessels
have a J-Drive greater than J1, this also allows backup. So a J3 vessel
which loses both its main circuitry *and* its secondaries then falls back
to J2 - and if this level fails, it drops back to J1 -- perhaps with the
catch that *fuel* consumption remains *unchanged*. In other words, the
vessel makes a J2 at the fuel cost of a J3!

Since such problems are assumed (so it seems) *never* to happen in
Traveller, there may not be a *huge* need for this sort of suggestion, but
it *does* make some sort of sense, so I\'m offering it for your
consideration.

Aha, I see what you\'re getting at. However, on that basis, the Vilani
Empire would have been too large to manage hundreds, if not thousands, of
years before. I suspect that you haven\'t considered the likelihood that the
command and control was regionalised under the various Megacorps. Like in
"Imperium" - the "Imperial Governor" can appeal to the "emperor" (which
probably just means higher command) for anything in excess of what he has
on hand or can build locally.

And don\'t forget the problem that the leaders *at* the front would have had
convincing the leaders in the *rear* that they needed new tactics - the
time delay there would have been just as significant!

Yeah, I\'m still playing the campaign, although the actual adventures from
TD are far behind. It\'s probably the most satisfying Traveller campaign
I\'ve ever run. It\'s great fun! I grabbed the hooks at the end of the
mini-adventure and made Count Draco Sylas the main enemy, and I\'ve really
been able to make the PCs hate him.

Currently, the campaing centers on the PCs trying to reach Mora, where
they\'ll try to get an audience with Norris, who will be passing by at that
time. Meanwhile, Sylas is doing lots of unpleasant stuff to stop the PCs,
as well as plotting to be the new archduke. Somewhere, the Sword Worlds are
playing the game, too, and there\'s lots of old clues from the time of the
Psionic Suppressions.

Should I get more specific?

I totally disagree with you on this.  If you are not carrying a 100%
breathables reserve, you are begging for trouble!  What\'s the FIRST thing
you do when you enter ship-to-ship combat?  Dump the pressure!  And while
that is scavenged, what about the ship that gets jumped (first you are
aware of the other ship is the decompression alarm!), or a ship that gets
hit by a meteor?  If you are not carrying a breathable reserve, you may
save the ship, but die of asphyxiation.

Vacc suit technology describes the advances in personal air supplies, I
imagine a similar line of advance for ship storage tanks, and air pumps.
I agree that air purifiers and recyclers ARE used, but I strongly feel
that there is a significant reserve kept back for emergencies, and to
replace pressure lost in the normal course of ship\'s operation.

Once we have agreed that this type of reserve exists, it is not too
difficult to imagine the O2 reserve expanded to included reconstitution of
H20.

While I tend to believe that water usage is more limited aboard a ship, I
do not believe it is so limited as to require some of the more extreme
methods of conservation that have been suggested.  As everything that is
consumed, and eventually excreted, aboard the ship is available for
recycling, only losses into space (and the big spaceport-down party when
the ship hits port) need be replaced.

You already get a lot more power from the fusion plant and
there is no real reason to carry all that oxygen around (see above).

Sure, you just burn it (like you burn natural gas in a water heater),
or you use a fuel cell, or you use any number of catalysts.

Now, the players reckoned that as the ship had plenty of

Jump1 ship doing this? Even if it couldn\'t carry   enough 
fuel, presumably it could use an interstellar depot, and 
these   would be standard between inhabited systems (though 
 in TNE they\'d be   mostly stripped bare). <<

First of all, the question "was I right" is answered by the 
simplest answer. "You\'re the ref". If a plot tweak like 
this was required to get your planned adventure to work 
properly then "make it so". Off the top of my head, you 
could have included damage to the navicomputer in with the 
jump drive damage, such that "normally you can but with 
your damage it might not be a good idea..."

In "fact" it is perfectly possible. You don\'t have to be in 
a system to get a fix; it\'s just easier. The navicomputer 
matches the pattern of visible stars against a 3d library 
and assuming you\'re in known space, works out your position 
from that. If you have enough fuel, there\'s nothing to stop 
you jumping again from the middle of nowhere. Of course, if 
something goes wrong, you\'ll be stuck there!

The technique you describe is in fact essential for Rift 
Cruisers, travelling across vast expanses of bugger-all. 

Returning to Starships (cries of "Oh, no!"), I have a 
question. All of them seem to have far too few staterooms. 
The 200-ton traders, in particular, seem to have exactly 
enough SR for the passengers and none for the poor old crew. 

Is there a difference in T4 staterooms? Do the Noble Pax 
double up with Scruffy the Engineer ? Or were the designs 
simply knocked together far too quickly?

By saying that O2 is not carried "in any significant quantity" above I did
not intend to imply that there was not any carried.  It seems likely to me
that a starship can probably replace it\'s atmosphere 4-5 times.

Take a 400 ton ship.  That\'s about 5400 cubic meters.  Let\'s say 20%
devoted to fuel (down to 4320 cu m.) another 40% for machinery, drives,
hull material, etc. ( down to 2160) [I think I\'m being conservative
here]

So we need 2,160 cubic meters of air.  Checking the WWW (don\'t you love
the \'net) I find a single dive tank at TL8 that holds 120 cu f. or
(convert from another web page) 3.399 cubic meters per tank.  Lets double
that once for TL12 and round to about 7 cu. m per tank.  Wow! we need
about 300 dive tanks for just *one* atmospheric replacement!  Each tank
(scribble scribble) is about 0.023 cu m giving a compression ratio
(ratio of space taken up per cu m of air held) of 304; that is, 1 cu m of
tank space holds 304 cu m of replacement atmosphere.  That means
(scribble) we need 7.1 cu m of space for each atmospheric replacement.
This will be spread throughout the ship in nooks and crannies, but still
will take up significant space; 4 replacements is 28.4 cu m or about 2
tons.  

So you want to eat into this to make water?  remember that only 20% of
what is in these tanks is oxygen.  What I cannot find on the web is a
ratio of gaseous oxygen to liquid water made.  I would guess that if you
are right,  we\'d do better to carry LOX and Liquid Nitrogen to make air,
and water as needed.  I have only a partial basis for making assumptions
above, but I feel that the amount of space required to make a significant
amount of water from these materials is extreme; like maybe you could get
a 100:1 ratio (not accounting for the L-hyd) so that you could have 100
tons of water making stuff in 1 ton of space.  I think I\'m off by an order
of magnitude (that is 10:1 ratio) but for the sake of argument lets leave
it at 100:1.

How many gallons a day do you want to use?  There are 12 crew on a 400 ton
Close Escort, each drinks 8 liters of water (some as soup, beer, etc) and
bathes in 30 (including shaving, washing hands, etc), Cooking accounts for
another 2 per person.  These are all assumptions and subject to argument.
Thats 40 liters per day times 12 crew times 28 days duration (MT standard;
I\'d want more in usual designs) is about 13,500 liters of water : That
converts to (I think!) 13.5 cubic meters (1000 liters=1m^3 right?) or one
ton   

Not as much as I thought. But I always thought there was a storage tank on
board with water, not chemicals, and also - a ton is a ton.  If it can be
freed up (partially) then why not do so.  Removing the cleaning
requirement leaves just 3100 liters, or 1/4 ton.  This is a more ignorable
number.

The measures mentioned for conserving water do not seem to me to
be too extreme.  The sonic showers I suggested are simple, effective
substitutes for running water showers which, in fact, can use 20-30
gallons of water at a sitting (or standing) - yes! it can be cleaned and
reused, but there is bound to be some inevitable waste (water left on the
bather\'s body, liberated into the cabin air, etc.) and a reasonable and
water-less (and waste processing free) method is available which conserves
that most precious commodity aboard a starship in the Imperium; space.
Also reprocessing the water is not as trivial as some think (see below)
although the quality needed for washing is not the same as that needed for
drinking.

Greg Porter\'s CSC and T4 aside, I think that the means of
reprocessing all waste in a starship is probably more complicated than
people here think. Our best 20th century technology requires at a minimum  
space and time, and in large quantities of each.  It also requires
bacteria and other microorganisms to break down the solids, and plants and
animals to reprocess those solids into edible materials (ok, plants will
do this alone). I don\'t think Traveller technology (TL 12) is very far
from ours, and even with another 50 years (a guess of what will get us
from TL8-9 to 12) of technological advancement there will still be a need
for lots of space and time to do this job.

***Flame Retardant Section***

I don\'t mean to imply that anyone else\'s way of doing things is wrong or
that they should stop their way and do it my way.  I\'m just trying to get
some help thinking these things through for my own campaign and have found
that everyone else seems to have a different set of assumptions than I do.
I hope to get my arguments filled with holes so I can work towards a
scientifically sound and logical system to use based on near-future tech
developments.

Well, I think I\'ve gone on long enough about this subject.

Actually it is.  The amount of oxygen necessary to repressurize the
ship a few times is a lot less than contained in sufficient water
for drinking, washing, shooting out of squirt guns, etc.  It would,
in fact, be easier to get your emergency oxygen by pulling water
out of the water recycling system.

I don\'t think water usage would be all the limited at all.  If you
have 5-10 gal of water per person and could recycle it in less than
an hour, you could take showers, cook, etc. and have a good reserve
for emergency oxygen.

Well, last word I had, as of October 15th, was that the game now belongs to
CyberLemur Enterprises. I was in game 10; but I haven\'t seen a turn since
October 15th. Eclipse had sold the game earlier to another group, brought it
back, and sold it to CyberLemur. To date, it seems to be following the IG
business model. 

I like the game in general. Ship design is not a real tight match to any
form of traveller (CT, MT, TNE or T4); I.E. everything occupies \'spaces\' as
opposed to displacement tons. UPPs are used to define the planets; most
stars have multiple planet systems; Gas giants are needed to refuel.
Strategic orientation rather than individual ship, somewhat more like the
VGA planets game without the on PC graphics and thinly disguised pop culture
races (Evil Empire, Rebels, Colonials, Fascists, Birdmen, etc). 

Would be nice if they operated on a regular basis.

   Locally, two of the four game stores that used to carry Traveller
products have the T4 sourcebook (similar to J.D.\'s report, one of the
stores hadn\'t gotten the word about Imperium Games).  One of the two
stores that had the T4 sourcebook also had Starships (it\'s possible that
the other had simply sold out its copies), and neither had CSC or
Aliens.

   This sounds like a problem at the distributor level.  Most game
companies have a hate-hate relationship with their distributors.  That\'s
because most distributors routinely screw small to medium-sized game
companies for as much as they can get out them.  Distributors do this
because they know that they can get away with it--IG needs the
distributors (and their ability to get product into gamestores) far
worse than the distributors need IG (to the distributors, Traveller is
just another product line).      

   Dave Nilsen is quoted as saying that he knew the end was near at GDW
when they finished up the Regency Sourcebook and virtually no
distributors would pick it up.

   Even if you think T4 sucks, it is important that some form of
Traveller stay in production.  That\'s because even with Internet
availability, if a game goes out of print, it becomes virtually
impossible to replenish the population of those who play it.  What\'s
left is a slow death--unless somebody else picks up the publication
rights, and with the failure of two major revisions of Traveller within
a year, it is unlikely that anyone with adequate capital will want to
pick it up.

   Quite simply it is a question of demand.  We can create a certain
amount of demand amongst our little on-line band and among our friends,
but ultimately it will only prolong IG\'s suffering unless a significant
number of new players are brought in--players that have never heard of
Traveller before--and are kept around.  That\'s IG\'s department.  Yeah, I
know what IG and others have *said* with regard to recruiting, but
gaming (particularly RPGing) for most of us is time to be spent with
friends.  Few of us have the money/time to routinely go to conventions
or to demo games in stores, and even fewer of us actually have the
ability/desire to referee games.

   Yours are noble sentiments, but the fact is that ultimately it is the
responsibility of Imperium Games to make T4 successful.  It is up to IG
to send people to conventions to sell product and demo the game (or
recruit people for this task).  It\'s up to IG to advertise in industry
trade papers.  It\'s up to IG to advertise in gaming magazines and on the
Internet (and keep their site up to date).  It\'s up to IG to suck up as
required to distributors and larger game store chains.  It is up to IG
to put out a product that will attract potential customers and will keep
current ones.  If they are unwilling or unable to do these things, then
it is up to Marc to decide to pull their license and find somebody else
who can.

   By all means though, rally the troops.  It can\'t hurt.

	We cannot assume that EVERY problem with the Jump Drives would 
be obvious to even a_very_good_Engineer.  Yes most of them probably 
would be but many real world machines will fail unexpectedly even when 
maintained by an expert (& these real world machines do not have to be 
capable of moving hundreds of tons of metal into another universe & 
bringing it back out) .  Sometimes you have to take machines half apart 
to discover that a problem exists.  It could very well be that this is 
part of the reason that routine maintenance takes two weeks, maybe the 
Jump Drive has to taken apart, inspected, cleaned to clean room 
standards, realined to minute tolerances, subjected to sophisticated 
computer diagnostics, etc.  The ships engineer may not have_time_to do 
this, because the ship is typically in Jump 1 week & in port for 1 week. 
 Even the most dedicated ships engineer who is willing to skip her 
liberty cannot do in 1 week, by herself, what it takes a starports yard 
crew 2 weeks (probably operating around the clock) to do.  (The military 
crew of a naval ship probably could though.) 
 
	Moreover it is possible, even probable, that the annual 
maintenance of a ship requires diagnostic tools that are not available 
on the ship.  It could well be the case that Jump drives require 
sophisticated (ie large & expensive) diagnostic tools for their yearly 
maintenance, while you could theoretically put these on the ship it does 
not make economic sense to do so.  Without these tools even the best 
enginner might not be able to_tell_that a problem existed.  Yes you will 
usually know that there is a problem with the Jump drive - but sometimes 
you will_not_know that it has a problem untill the yard crew opens it up 
for maintenance.  This is why I said that I would not schedule the 
annual maintenance for_my_ship at a B port.  I don\'t think it is a big 
deal however, I\'m just being cautious.

	This is a brilliant suggestion ! 
 
	There is some previous cannonical evidence that Jump drives can 
in fact operate in this manner.  In High Guard & MegaTraveller starship 
combat one of the results of interior dammage to the ship is the 
"Jump-n" result where the Jump drives factor is reduced by the indicated 
ammount.  I had always assumed that this ships dammage result was due to 
the fact that the dammaged drive was no longer capable of attaining its 
full Jump potential but was capable of making a shorter (& easier) Jump. 
Phils suggestion explains this result.  Since the sytem is 
_not_performing properly it will not operate at full potential & 
therefore the suggestion that a Jump require as much fuel as the next 
higher Jump number is an elegant & simple way of simulating this.

	Phils suggestion seemed to be refering to decreeased performance 
due to wear & not due to combat dammage but the results could easily be 
the same in reality & assuming they are the same would make things much 
easier without much loss of verisimilitude.

	A Zhodhani significant other might think that there was anything 
wrong with infidelity.  We know that in todays society many people are 
unfaithfull to there mates & many others think about it.  With their 
widespread telepathy the Zhodani would probably have concluded long ago 
that infidelity is "normal" & not abberant behavior.  Therefore they 
would accept it.  It is entirely possible that the Tavrchedl\' would come 
& talk to the spouse of the "cheater" & talk to_them_about their 
unrealistic assumptions about human behavior, not to the "cheater" 
themselves.
	However the Zhodani would probably also have concluded that 
human beings who know about their spouses infidelity will be hurt & 
react negatively.  Therefore the Zhodani spouse might well hide their 
infidelity to spare your fealings.  They might very well use their 
Clairvoyance & Teleportation to be home before you.  But remember you 
should not be angry at them, they are just attending to ther "normal" 
human need for affection YOU are not giving them.   Maybe you need to 
think about_your_unrealistic assumptions of fidelity.

P. S.	The above thoughts are not necessarily intended to promote 
infidelity in the "real world" but rather to suggest what the Zhodani 
viewpoint might be.

One cubic meter of water is 264 gallons. One "displacement ton" of
water is 3566 gallons. 

I rather expect ships to have a *lot* of water. For one thing, it helps
you balance the load in the ship by pumping it between tanks. Tanks for
this can be stuck in all those odd little bits of space that are
useless for anything else. Water is also ideal for shielding against
things like solar flares, a few meters will do just fine for civilian
ships. And you can use it to equalize heat load by pumping between
tanks just under the "skin" of the ship. 

And water makes a good source for both oxygen for breathing, and
hydrogen for fuel. Excess oxygen can be stored in small amounts of
space by using LH2 to freeze it solid. 

In my opinion, it\'s *definitely* worthwhile to have the ship set up to
store water in those odd nooks and crannies, plus have a couple of fair
sized tanks of it. And it\'s also a good idea to be set up to turn water
into LH2 and LOX, as well as the reverse. The conversion gear doesn\'t
take up a lot of space, and it simplifies water purification. You just
make it a point to *always* run water/wastewater thru the purifier and
convert it to hydrogen/oxygen and back to water. This essentially
*eliminates* any contamination problems.

Dive tanks are pressure limited because they tend to get banged into
things.  Stationary tanks can run at higher pressures safely. Larger
"industrial" tanks will hold air at 1000-2000 atmospheres. That means
one cubic meter of tank will hold 1000 cubic meters of air. Liquified
gases make more sense on shipboard as you already need the ability to
handle cryogenic gases for the LH2. You\'ll also likely keep the
nitrogen and oxygen *seperately*, as you\'ll rarely need to add
nitrogen, but frequently need to add oxygen.

The water *can\'t* be "lost". There\'s nowhere for it to go. You are
forgetting that the ship is a *closed system* while underway. What
doesn\'t go down the drain winds up in the air (one way or another. Any
excess water in the air *will* be recovered by the air recirculation
equipment. And that puts it back into the recycling system.

That\'s for reprocessing "solid" waste. Reprocessing *that* will take
space and time (though not as much space as you might think).

But *because* space is at such a premium on shipboard, it makes more
sense to run the sewage and wastewater into something that "roasts"
them to release the water, which is then cracked into hydrogen &
oxygen. The H2 and O2 are recombined into water which is fit for *any*
use. The solids are packed into blocks, and wrapped to be disposed of
or sold (they\'ll have been sterilized in the process of releasing the
water, so they make good fertilizer). 

Air gets recirculated. Excess water *has* to be removed, so that
accounts for the water that evaporates and gets exhaled. Excess CO2 has
to be removed too. There are many possible methods. One of the easier
on shipboard might be by liquifiying the air and distilling off the
C02, O2, and nitrogen. Or you can just filter out the CO2 with things
like LiOH canisters. 

The distillation method is nice because it doesn\'t require extra
consumables, just the ability to liquify gases (which the ship needs
anyway). 

In any case, the main reaction involved in people eating, breathing and
excreting is this:

6 O2 + C6H12O6 -> 6 CO2 + 6 H2O

So if we can crack the CO2 (easily done given the fusion reactor!) you
get back *all* the oxygen, plus we *accumulate* water.

Consider that if we *don\'t* try to recycle, we *still* want to dry the
sewage and other wastes so they\'ll be easier to store. So we need to at
*least* distill the recovered water so as to avoid needing a *seperate*
set of tanks for "dirty" water.

And we *still* have to be able to remove excess water from the air. So
we wind up recycling water whether we intended to or not! All it takes
is a *small* amount of space, and a moderate amount of power. Power we
have. 

So water recycling uses *less* space than not recycling it. Extracting
C02 uses space one way or another, and frankly, which do you think uses
more space: filters that have to be stored and changed. or an
extraction system that just removes the CO2 and either stores it (dry
ice or tanks of liquid CO2), dumps it overboard, or "cracks" it to
carbon powder and O2.

Recycling *food* requires a *big* ship or nanotech. Recycling air and
water merely requires power.

Starships - there are several other problems that I *could* comment on, but
the following really reached out and grabbed me by the throat, so to speak!

Luxury Line (pp. 26-27)

514 High Passage Cabins - 100 of which are stated to be double size = 614
effective HP Cabins, @ 4 tons per cabin and 1 ton dedicated cargo space (it
says this comes as part of the ticket price - check it out!) = 3070 tons.

185 Crew Cabins assuming single occupancy of a Small Stateroom @ 2 tons
each = 370 tons.

699 total crew and passengers, requiring a 5 ton "Rescue Ball" (read the
description on Page #6 - its *required*) for every four = 699/4 = 175
(approx.) = 175 x 5 tons (no allowance for launching mechanisms) = 875 tons

Total so far = 4315 tons

Add 2000 tons for Jump Fuel (J2), 150 tons for the J2 Drive itself; around
90 tons for the M1 Drive, and we get another 2240 tons - and thats ignoring
the Bridge, Sandcasters, Sensors.

Total = 6555 displacement tons ... all in a 500 displacement ton hull!

Obviously the Syleans have discovered the ability to use Pocket Universes a
la Grandfather! Which was TL16+!

I am *not* impressed :-{

And note that the idea of a Luxury class passenger sitting in a notionally
4 (or even 8) displacement ton cabin - is laughable (its 3 x 6 meters, and
that doesn\'t allow for the 1 ton supposedly allocated to general passenger
spaces rather than cabin space - leaving that out, its 3 x 4.5 meters)!

Well, it depends, I suppose.  Although Zhodani are honest to a fault within 
Zhodani society, they might not be when living in the Imperium.  ("When in 
Rome, act as the Romans do.")  For example, in wartime, Zhodani forces make 
use of surprises and ruses just as well as anyone else (maybe better, hence 
the scenario\'s title "Perfidious Zhodane" in Azhanti High Lightning), and 
these surely require dishonesty.  If they can lie in war, surely they can lie 
in love. >>

Ah, but your average Zho civilian has been taught from birth - with 
re-education when necessary - that any form of dishonesty is a serious mental 
disorder. Military decisions aren\'t really the same thing (although spies 
have to be specially trained to lie).

You\'re making a perfectly natural mistake here, but a mistake nonetheless.
Taxes can\'t be sent from one planet to another unless you have lots of
cargo ships to carry valuable stuff between them. Bits in a computer or 
pieces of paper isn\'t wealth unless you can buy something with it. If you
can\'t eat, burn, or fondle it, it isn\'t wealth. When Mikesh "pays" umpteen
million credits to the Imperium it dosen\'t actually send anything more than 
a message saying "We\'ll do umpteen billion credits worth of work for you for
free". Oh, I\'ve no doubt that come 001-1118 Mikesh is going to owe whatever
planet did the annual maintenance on Fleets 30 and 31 a lot of money, but
what good is that going to do that world until the Rebellion is over (with
Lucan the winner, mind you) and they can buy stuff from Mikesh with the 
credit? In the meantime Mikesh has umpteen million credits worth of sceduled 
maintenance that is not going to be needed after all because the ships aren\'t 
there any more. If you think the brevet admiral who has been left in charge 
of Imperial forces in Corridor is going to let that capacity go to waste, 
you\'re sadly mistaken. And even if he is such a chump surely the Mikesh 
government will find good use for the available starship construction 
capacity (Come to think of it, they will HAVE to build more ships unless 
they want a major recession).

Could you please tell me where it says that passengers get 1dton of
cargo space with their passage, so that I may check it out.

The deal with the rescue balls is that they, obviously, aren\'t
included in the design of the Luxury Liner.  It would seem the Don in
keeping with the over all mediocre job (and I\'m being polite) that
was done on Starship wrote the bit on rescue balls but couldn\'t be
bothered to see that ships designed by other people were consistent
with it.

I\'m not sure how you figured out that a 5000dton ship needs 2000dtons
of fuel for Jump 2.  I come up with only 1000dtons.  However, looking
at the stats for the Luxury Liner this is the only fuel on board. 
Kinda makes you wonder how they keep the power on.

As far as the size of luxury accommodations being laughable, I\'d like
to know what is your basis for comparision? The luxury accommodations
for the Graf Zeppelin\'s 20 passengers was about only 16dtons and they
spent as much as four days between landings in this space.

I can\'t make out whether you think that this is the way the TCS rules work
or not. If you do think so, then you\'re mistaken. Familiarity with a ship
type (what you would call better scheduling) will allow you to do 1.4 weeks

you increase the speed by paying 1.2 times the basic cost, you do 1.2 weeks
work in 1 week, but at the cost of 1.2*1.2 times the basic cost per week.

You know, if they really can\'t afford to pay for such a mistake and prefer
angering their customers to swallowing the costs, it\'s absolutely amazing 
that they still (Dec 28th) haven\'t changed the offer on IG\'s web pages. I\'m
looking at it right now, and the subscription is still $30 with an asterisk
marking it as an item that does not require a shipping charge.

You know, under Danish law such an offer is legally binding until changed.
Is that not the case under US law?

And I just can\'t understand how any businessman could make himself believe
that just adding to the charge without consulting the customer would be a
proper thing to do.

problem that will probably be a part of the future - theft of starships for
spare parts!  Or more likely, theft from spare-parts depots (since a complete
ship is so valuable in it\'s own right, why strip it?) and a huge black-market
economy based on hard-to-find spares.

The more commonplace a ship type is, the easier it will be to find spare parts 
for, and conversely, the bigger target it will be for other people looking for 
spare parts (supply and demand)!

I can see it now:

   The crew is in a class B (or less) starport after weeks of travelling, but 
   someone has to guard the ship from scavengers, and someone has to scrounge 
   around the starport for good \'deals\' on spares...

   Or that disgruntled crewmember has walked out with some critical part 
   because she knows she will have no trouble selling it to the locals - 
   perhaps for resale back to this same ship when it\'s loss is discovered!

Seedy starports on planets with low law levels would become notorious for 
these kinds of activities.  I would expect class A starports to have a 
reputation to maintain and have very good security and possibly a registry of 
ship parts (serial numbers on everything, like modern vehicles) and this might 
be a part of keeping their Class A rating.

It\'s my understanding that the main time you have to worry about this is if
you want to charge for the program.  As long as it is released as Freeware,
I don\'t believe there is a problem.  The perfect example is a character
generator.  A lot of people have written them for Traveller, and they are
all Freeware (I think).  If you want to charge for it, then you have to
make an agreement with whoever owns the rights (which is probably a lot
more trouble than it\'s worth).

So are you saying that Mikesh never pays taxes but only agrees to do
work at a later date for the Imperium?  If so who ends up paying the
salaries for the Imperial Navy?  I don\'t know how things work in the
rest of the world, but here in the U.S. taxes are deducted from my
paycheck and electronically transferred to the government. Then
government budgets out these funds and then government employees,
contractors, etc. receive checks.  At no time is it necessary to
transfer valuable stuff, and is actually impractical to do so.  I
don\'t see why this won\'t work on an interstellar basis.

This is exactly what will happen.  The Admiral left in command of
Corridor will not start spending funds that he doesn\'t have.

I think that a either a recession or maybe just an economic downturn
is what will happen (depending on how much of the economy is based on
ship maintenance).  Those workers would become unemployed and would
then need to seek employment elsewhere.  This is how it worked for me
when I went from building missiles to my current job at an investment
bank.  Your suggestion that the government switches ship maintenance
capacity to ship building capacity despite a lack of funds would
cause inflation, which in turn could lead to the recession that you
were trying to avoid in the fist place (I\'m not an expert on
economics, so if someone who is would care to comment it would be
appreciated)

Federal Trade Commission rules require companies that sell merchandise by

Mattel did neither, the FTC ruled.

A court must still approve the agreement before it becomes final.

I would hope that who ever is now handling business management for Imperium

	I\'ve heard rumors that some of these book/music clubs will allow you to
switch your membership from "send selection unless refused" to "don\'t send
selection unless requested." I don\'t know if SFBC does that--check out the
web site and ask them. They respond very quickly, as I found out when I
ordered a book for which I didn\'t have the code.

Charlie, 

The point that is being made is that "questionable"(understatement) business
practices that IG has made in the past, will only drive away the potential
"new" customer, and frustrated "old" traveller customers. So if "we" don\'t
let them catch "Hell" when they screw up, they will not even think of
changing their "Questionable" practices. As to your line about "extra cash"
well send me $50.00, reason being I asked you too, I promise nothing and
will deliver nothing, if you do that will make you a really be sucker.
Standing up for your "Legal" rights is not throwing stones. If a company
depends upon "illegally" obtaining money from customers (Chumps or Suckers)
then no matter that they are the "Only" ones producing traveller, they
deserve to go under.!!!! Would you do business in store that kept your
deliberately change or short changed you after a purchase? I really hope
not. As to IG\'s recently released produces, well they over priced
considerably. The CSC is $24.00 US and has only 98 pages. It does have some
extremely useful stuff inside but it should have been priced at most $12.00
US. If you purchase CSC and Alien Archive at the same time the total will
come to about $50.00 US. Even TSR has boxed sets for less than $50.00 US. I
have looked at both CSC and Alien Archive, I reluctancy bought only CSC. The
reason I did not buy both "PRICE" vs value contained within. I have had long
conversation with the manager of chain of game stores in my area. He does
like IG\'s products for the following reasons

1. Price of the products, more customers than he would care to count has
been put off buying due the price.
2. Initial shipments were under what he ordered, this not due to the
distributors but due to IG methods of production and distribution.
3. Restocks take entirely too much time, his chain received 6 hardbacks
early this fall. Most stores got one hardback, Softbacks were unavailable
thru any distributer. It took two months to get the balance of his initial
order, and another month after that to a partial on his reorder. But most
are still sitting on his shelves due reason 1 above. Total sales of T4
merchandize since sept 7 hardbacks, 2 softbacks, 2 Starships, 2 CSC and
Alien Archives none. This for a chain of multiple stores. 95% of these sales
were to Traveller "Old Guard". 

I will probably wait to buy Alien Archives at the discounted quarterly
"warehouse" sale that is held to get rid of "Shelf Queens". 

As for IG T4 necrosis has set in and not treated will be fatal. IG makes
some the GDW mistakes look like strokes of genius. To Dave, and Loren
formerly of GDW, you have my apology, you really did do a better job on
Traveller.

I agree with this.  Eariler on, I had once said that IG\'s products were not
expensive compared with other products available on the market.  However,
after seeing a 98 page supplement released for $24 US I can\'t believe it
(the only products above this, is the new SWRPG, $44 canadian!!!).  

Here a few examples, from the 1997 TSR product catalogue (as a side-note,
did everyone hear of TSR\'s layoffs of 24 people just before Christmas.
Rumour has it they are in some financial difficulties).  Some of these
products fall near the IG prices, but most don\'t.

"The Sea Devils" -- $20 US (96 pages, bound in poster, full colour)
"College of Wizardry" -- $15.95 US (96 pages, full colour map sheet attached)
"Of Ships and Sea" -- $20 US (128 pages)

And, for some Traveller competition in the SF market, their new Alternity game:

Alternityy Player Handbook -- $30 US (Hardcover, 256 pages, full colour)
    "      Rulemaster Guide -- $25 US (Hardcover, 224 pages, full colour)
Star Drive Alien Compendium -- $20 US (96 pages)

Espcially, look at the two rulebooks!  Both are hardcover, and cheaper than
the softcover version of T4, and are bigger as well!

I think IG has definitely got to do something about it\'s pricing, or they\'ll
soon find themselves relying solely on the sale of T4 to diehard fanatics of
Traveller.  I myself have not purchased Starships, CSC or Alien Archive, and
don\'t plan to at the current prices.  I\'ll probably pick up M0, put it\'d
better be good.

I think that TSR is a very bad example.  They are a *huge* company.
Despite what people around here want to believe, IG is a *small*
company.  If you want to compare prices accurately, you need to compare
them against other *small* companies.  After all IG is definitely not in
the same league as TSR, SJG, or WW.  Better comparisons for them would
be DP9, Deadalus Games, Myrmidon Press.  Even WEG which could be
considered a *midsize* company has prices similar to all of these other
companies.  Look around at all the other companies that have only one or
two product lines.  You\'ll see that if they\'re still producing materials
you\'ll find similar prices for similar sized books.

Repeat after me--"economies of scale do exist."

 Hi SS
  You might be right to get pissed off if IG had cooked up some master
plan to rip folks off for their cash. I don\'t think this is the case
the, first too obvious, second it is more likely to be an honest
mistake. I have been absent from the list for the past few days has IG
posted a official reply to the complaints? If not why don\'t we wait
before we open up with the plasma guns.
 The price question is different and separate. You may not want to pay
the price that is your choice. First answer these questions for me. What
is IG day to day expenses? How much did it cost to start up the company?
What dose it cost them to put out two products  this close together? Do
you know what part of that retail price IG puts in their pockets? After
you answer these questions then we might be able to figure what a fair
price is.
 As a store buyer I can tell you that after some intimal problems I have
had no problem with taking care of my stores needs and I wont have any
T4 queens on the shelf.
 I hope you can find a rpg you like I hope you will not bail on T4 but
at times you got to vote with your feet, see You.

    'body' => 'Hi,

In light of the continuing discussion of the JTAS shipping charge, as well 
as the cost of Traveller products, I\'d like to offer my thoughts on those 
subjects.


JTAS Shipping Charge
====================

As mentioned previously, the folks at IG are out of the office until 
January 2.  AFAIK, they\'ve not seen a single message in reaction to 
their move of charging for shipping.  So, it\'s not a surprise we haven\'t 
seen anything from them about that, including the lack of an update to 
the web page.

What I\'ve done in the interim is send a representative selection 
of TML messages on this subject to Courtney\'s email box.  I\'ve also sent 
him my thoughts on the subject.  And I\'ve briefed Tim Brown about this, and 
he has said he will talk to Courtney about it when he (Courtney) returns 
on the 2nd.

At this point, I believe it was an honest mistake, rather than a 
malicious move to hurt IG\'s customers.  I\'m hoping that, after gaining a 
full understanding of the situation and the legalities involved, Courtney 
will reverse the policy.

But, none of that will happen until Thursday at the earliest.  


Cost of Traveller Products
==========================

My thought on this is that the folks at IG will know if their products are 
overpriced, whether their customers explicitly tell them so or not.  If 
T4 and the supplements are selling well, they\'re not overpriced.  If they 
are not selling well, it should be determined whether price was a factor in 
that lack of performance (along with product quality, distribution, and 
so on).  But, from what I\'ve heard, the products are selling at a good 
clip.  The evidence, therefore, suggests that the prices are not too high.

But then, I believe market forces will severely punish any company 
(outside of monopolies and oligopolies) that goes too far out of line in 
pricing its products - especially if those products are not necessities. ;)

    Has anyone looked at the construction times of the US Navy for submarine

    Though the elements in which they move are vastly dissimilar: a starship
moves through the Vacuum of Space, while a submarine moves through the
increasing pressure of water.  The Requirements of both vessels in terms of
supporting their crews and maintaining themselves as a viable weapons platform
are rather similar enough for the comparison to be worthwhile.  More to the
point let\'s put some RW values onto our speculations. ;)

the pricing question.

I feel that the prices on the original rulebooks for T4 were reasonable,
though I would, of course, have preferred a less-rushed end product.  
Starships was overpriced, though I think this was because IG so totally
missed the mark with the book, rather than because there wasn\'t enough
in the book to justify the cost.  If there had been even a little of
what made SOM so great, I could have overlooked the awful deckplans and
been happy with the book.

I took a look at both CSC and Aliens Archive at my FLGS, and while they
represent a step in the right direction, content-wise, the pricing *IS*
way out-of-line, especially in the case of Aliens, which only makes it
to 96 pages by using an oversized font throughout.

While using TSR or WW as examples isn\'t really fair, it\'s hard to ignore
the fact that the new supplement for Fading Suns is ~120 pages, and
costs $15US.

WEG, while a "mid-size" company, does have to pay a pretty substantial
licensing fee to Lucasfilm for the Star Wars products, and this has
caused the SW line to be a bit overpriced for much of its life.  Even
taking all of that into account, however, most of the current SW
supplements run ~96 pages, and are typically $18US.

Based on the above, and the fact that I am more of a collector than a
player when it comes to Traveller, I passed on both CSC and Aliens - I
simply could not justify spending that much money on either product.  I
could have swallowed $18, maybe $20, but not $22.95 per book.

It seems to me that there are a few things seriously amiss at IG/AP,
primarily in the areas of pricing, editing, and simple good business
practices, and I am honestly having a hard time giving them financial
support until I am reasonably certain that the problems have been
solved.  Heck, I\'d feel a LOT better if the problems were truly
acknowledged by IG.

Unfortunately, each week seems to bring a new problem at IG, with the
JTAS shipping charge fiasco merely the latest in what is becoming a
disturbingly long list of difficulties.   

I hope that IG gets its act together in the very near future, because I
honestly don\'t think that the game can survive for very long when each
product has a major flaw (Rulebook - editing, Starships - content, CSC
and Alien Archive - pricing).

Ergh. My mistake. It\'s been some time since I actively used the TCS
construction rules, and my quick review of them obviously wasn\'t thorough
enough. Hans is right, and I was wrong. On a vaguely related note, Hans, do
you have any comments on the back-and-forth between me and Thad about basing
yard capacity on yard workers as opposed to displacement tonnage?

Well, the "electronic transfer" you speak of isn\'t possible in the Third
Imperium, at least not on an interstellar scale *with the degree of
immediacy we are used to thinking of* (critical emphasis there). It\'s all
bookkeeping, really. At some point, the Mikesh planetary government will
send a data transmission off to the Imperial Treasury (I like to call it the
"Fisc"... sounds neater than "Treasury"), saying, "credit account number
such-and-such with X bajillion credits of tax collections, and we are
debiting our accounts to reflect this payment."  Later, the Imperial Fisc
will issue a message to the Navy Finances division, saying  "credit account
number so-and-so with Y bajillion credits, as your yearly budget allotment,
which is listed in Imperial Budget number Z".

Then come the rampaging Vargr (at least, so the published history says).

The courier from Mikesh won\'t be able to get through to send the message to
the Fisc. The courier from Capital can\'t get through with the yearly budget,
or with the message transferring the money to the Navy. Here\'s where things
get dicey. There are probably some kind of intermediary collection points,
on the sector or subsector level. These fiscal officials can either say,
"Well, we\'ve not gotten any messages from Capital, so we\'ll just let the
money accumulate in these tax collection accounts, and work on sharpening up
our Vargr language skills", or... they can go ahead and allocate funds back
to the Navy.

 Of course, they\'ll keep records, and it\'ll be mentioned as an "emergency
measure"... nobody wants to get executed for peculation if/when contact is
reliably reestablished with Capital, although *some* of the money will
surely stick to the fingers of some officials. Still, the allocations will
be about the same as regular wartime monies will be, since taxes are
(conveniently) all the same rate everywhere, and based strictly on
population... i.e., a citizen of the Spinward Marches doesn\'t have higher
taxes than a citizen in Ilelish, for example. So, 56th Fleet HQ suddenly has
a budget... and no ships to maintain. Nobody\'s there needing repairs.
Nobody\'s drawing salaries (well, obviously there\'s *some* skeleton of the
Fleet left, running bases and such... but not nearly as many as there used
to be). So... the Admiral in charge will start construction programs in a
hellacious hurry, because he *knows* that the Vargr could make a big ol\'
mess of the sector if he doesn\'t have any ships to fight them with. The
reserve Fleets are nice, yes... but he needs a regular Fleet, and he needs
it *bad*.

<chuckle> Avoiding a recession is secondary to "not getting overrun by the
Vargr". Oh, sure, the interruption in trade and communications with the core
regions of the Imperium will cause an economic slump, and there\'s not much
to be done about it except go kick Vargr butts. Still, proper bookkeeping
will ease a lot of the financial worries of the region. If there ever *had*
been a resumption of contact, then things would have been hairy to figure
out, but nobody in charge of an invaded sector is going to let his critical
defense industries go down the tubes just out of a pollyannaish desire to
play by the *previous* rules of the tax game.

Essentially, Hans\' earlier point seems to be that "I\'ll (Mikesh) give you
(the Fisc) X amount of credits, which you\'ll then give back to me in
exchange for performing a particular amount of work". Essentially true, if
overly simplified. As you point out, some of it will go to individuals in
Imperial Service, and other parts of it will disappear in general overhead
costs.

    'body' => 'Something I read the other day got me thinking -- so bear with me for a
moment, even those who would claim its an unusual situation ;-)

Imagine that you have a brand new 1997 model Car (fill in model and make of
choice), just off the showroom floor, in fact - less than 20 ks on the
clock. OK, then imagine that you immediately put it into your garage at
home on returning from the showroom and, without further ado, left it
there. You make no attempts to prepare it for storage - its just sitting
there.

How many months do you think would pass before some vital subsystem would
malfunction if you decided to get into it one day and simply turn the key
in the ignition and drive away? Six months? Twelve months? Two years? Ten
Years? A hundred years?

I think we can safely say that the chances of it being operational without
*much* work after as little as *ten* years would be close to zero; and
after a hundred it would take more work than the machine would be worth,
except as a "vintage" car, to get it running again.

Rubber parts decay, plastics stiffen and crack, fuel evaporates, fabrics
decay or are attacked by insects, metal parts rust.

Even if it was stored, unprepared, in a vacuum, metal parts tend to surface
weld themselves in such conditions over lengthy periods of time, though if
it was a *space* vehicle the overall structure may remain relatively sound.

Try the same thing with, say, a brand new Laptop Computer, top of the line
model. Because it doesn\'t rely as much (in some ways) on moving parts,
perhaps it *might* last a little longer - perhaps not.

What\'s the point? Well, what defines Forerunner Artifacts - *some* of them
(considerable numbers, in fact, *all* Black Globe generators are Forerunner
artifacts, remember!) - still work some hundreds of thousands of years
after being abandoned (for whatever reason). Whether this is *real world*
realistic or not, it is something that evidently *defines* Forerunner tech
(or some of it, at least).

We also know from the Darrian sourcebook that TL16 Starships and related
tech lasts for a 1000 years or more - though this was contradicted in the
Regency Soucebook, something I personally would ignore - but, then, you all
know that I believe that TNE and Virus were a bad joke :-(

Regardless of whether Virus exists or not, the thing defining TL16 tech
seems to be that it, too, is much longer lasting than would normally be
expected.

So this is the question - why?

This is rhetorical, of course! I have a *suggestion* -- one that actually
ties in with the insult to the intelligence that was Virus (though one that
makes what Virus was *vastly* more believable ... the idea of walking
microchips is about as ludicrous and science-fantasy as you can get).

Well, *how* would these items last for so long? The answer seems to be that
they must have some capacity for *self-repair*. In a limited sense they
must be "alive". I would suggest that its the *electronics* alone that are
most likely to be like this - and, while I doubt that they\'d be alive in
the sense that they were in the "Virus" descriptions we have (which seem to
be based on a silly idea by someone who had not a clue about computers and
what they may be like in 3000 years time - OK, I admit it, I *lothed* the
*stupidity* of Virus :-(  -- means that they would have to have some sort
of inbuilt "template" for their circuitry and that this *could* become
corrupted under the wrong conditions ... at least if the "right"
precautions were not taken.

Perhaps it is simply that this was the Imperium, a TL15 culture, making its
first tottering steps towards TL16 ... and eventually to something
approaching the reliability of Forerunner level tech. It certainly puts
"Virus" in a new light - and makes the pathetic anti-computer fears of the
Regency and RefCol just that, pathetic ... superstitious drivel based on a
lack of understanding (and, in the case of the RefCol, perhaps, a lack of a
*desire* to understand) as to where the new tech had gone wrong. But, then,
the Vilani have always had an anti-computer streak that the Terrans don\'t
seem to have had.

Would Darrian computers have been affected by Virus? We don\'t know, as the
Regency and RefCol and their era are years away from ever being broached
again (and it can\'t be *too* far away for me!), and, anyway, since the
Regency effectively cut itself off from the rest of the Imperium to protect
itself from the Virus, thus "protecting" the Darrians from something that
they may never have needed protection against anyway, we\'ll probably never
know.

But would *ancient* level computers have been affected by Virus. According
to the ludicrous way it seems to have been implemented in TNE, *yes*.
According to my suggestion? NO! The Ancient computers would be a *mature*
level of self-repair tech (if they haven\'t gone beyond that, in fact), and
so would probably not even recognise the presence of viral code!

Anyway, its an idea that I thought might be of interest, whether you think
Virus is garbage or not.

Ah I think I see the difference in our discussions.  I\'ll agree that the
T4 line isn\'t worth the price we\'re paying for the books (with the
exception of the CSC).

Unfortunately, value of content is not the creteria for pricing a book.
Factors such as production costs, variable and fixed business costs, and
size of print run determine the cost of a book.

Value of content is however what makes us determine if we want to buy
the book or not.  The book may or may not be worth the price tag--that
however is a purely subjective matter.

Hmmm.  In college, they drilled it into our heads that cost should have 
nothing to do with price.  You charge what you can get.  If you can\'t 
charge enough to cover your costs, then you don\'t produce the product.  
Other than that, cost and price should have no relationship.  There\'s no 
such thing as too much profit. =)

Heck, look at the cost of producing Nike shoes in Korea or wherever 
they\'re producing them now, vs. the price of those shoes.  Really, the 
clothing industry as a whole is a good example of "all the market will 
bear" in action.

5.56x45mm Assault Rifle (M-Z M16A6)

This is an old Solomani rifle dating from 1996 AD, and it is 
basically an upgraded version of the AR-15 rifle. Instead of 
using stock-mounted recoil spring tube and long bolt carrier, 
this weapon has re-designed gas system and shortened bolt 
carrier. This allows the use of a true folding stock instead of 
using semi-retractable stock as in M4 carbine. The receiver is
made of 7075-T6 aircraft alloy.

Weapon Type:		TL-9 light self-loading longarm
Ammunition:		5.56x45mm TL-8 necked
Muzzle Energy:		1600 joules

4.93x33mm Caseless Assault Rifle (H&K G11K5)

Based on the H&K G11K2 assault rifle, this weapon has gyroscopic
recoil compensator instead of free-floating self-compensating action
used in G11-series. (This weapon comes very close to the "Rifle,
Bullpup" described in T4 rulebook. However, the T4 price of "Cr300"
must be typo, because the barrel and receiver alone cost Cr528.)

Weapon Type:		TL-9 light self-loading longarm
Ammunition:		4.93x33mm TL-9 telescoped caseless
Muzzle Energy:		1448 joules

5.56x45mm ETC Assault Rifle (Steyr ETC)

The 5.56x45mm ETC AR is a Solomani weapon based on the ETC
version of 5.56x45mm Nato ammunition and short-stroke gas-piston
receiver. The long muzzle brake doubles as 22mm BTU adapter
(Bullet Trap Universal), can be used to launch any standard BTU
and BTU RAM grenades.
(Design loosely based on the 5.5mm Assault Rifle in RCEG, page 52.)

Weapon Type:		TL-9 light self-loading longarm

7.62mm Advanced Combat rifle (SAKO 762Rk144)

The 7.62mm ACR is a Solomani weapon based on 7.62x39mm ETC 
ammunition and Kalashnicov-style gas-operated receiver. While 
the weapon has quite long barrel and long muzzle brake, the 
bullpup configuration makes the complete rifle still shorter 
than most conventional rifles.
The weapon has ambidextrous controls and reversible ejection 
port. The carrying handle contains build-in optic sight.

I disagree completely.  Sure, IG has had some startup problems, and somebody
was in too much of a hurry to bring out T4 without putting the polish on the
systems and production values.  Yes, we should complain when things are
screwed-up, so that IG is aware of the problem, but I see too many people just
going ballistic over these problems!  Give it a rest!

I think part of the problem is expectations versus reality.  If we were new to
Traveller, the problems would be annoying, but not necessarily fatal (assuming
we would know where to find the errata!)  But as people who have known and
loved Traveller for a long time (17 years in my case), the expectation of a
really great, "kick-butt" version of Traveller got my expectations very high,
and I was disappointed.  But I am willing to give IG a chance, and am looking
forward to them surviving long enough for T4 2nd Edition, with all the errata
corrected and artwork in the correct places (and those dang black borders
gone!)

And remember, all these complaints on the TML (which tend to feed off each
other) have come fast and furious, too fast for IG to formulate a response,
_much_less_ make production changes and ship products that reflect those
changes!

"Can\'t we all just get along?" (tm)

I\'m happy that Traveller is not yet dead, and I want to give my support to IG 
and GoldRush and DGP(?) and whoever else is trying to bring it back as the 
premier science fiction game (and it was once - just look at the 
acknowledgements that SJGames and RTalisorian give in GURPS Space and the 
CyberPunk space supplements to the influence of Traveller and Marc Miller, 
etc).

DGP\'s "World Builders Handbook" (IMHO the epitome of DGP\'s contributions to
Traveller) has a set of Social Outlook tables, including a "Progressiveness"
table (7a, pg 74) ranging from radical to reactionary on one 2d6 axis and
enterprising to stagnant on another 2d6 axis.  I would use those values to
determine how likely a culture was to become dependent on outside advanced
technology.

Advanced Tech Acceptance Tables

Reactionary       +2             +3           +4        +5

The above table gives a DM to the roll made on the following table:

 2    eagerly embraces all aspects, massive imitation and importation
3,4   admires advanced technology, will use as can afford it
5,6   accepts only most useful, large scale tech (power generation)
 7    accepts only minor, non-critical items (trinkets)
8,9   refuses access to tech for locals
10,11 reviles offworld technology (offworlders at risk!)
12    hates technology, starport considered a hostile invasion

It shouldn\'t be too difficult to add modifiers for the local law levels and
government types also.  For example, higher law and gov levels would tend to
add positive DMs to the roll.

Actually, Joe, this is only half way true.  I was a marketing major, 
and after that, held a position as a capital accounts manager for a 
medical sales company.

Price theory is half art and half science.  It depends on what goals, 
if they have any, they are trying to achieve with their products.  
For instance, they may want a high market penetration to get the 
Traveller name out there, sell a lot of books, and secure market 
share.

With the price of their current books, they are definitely not 
following this pricing strategy.  Another strategy is to price your 
product high if it is perceived as a quality product.  Again, IG is 
not doing this either, because it would be hard to position a premium 
product in the RPG market--customers do not perceive one company\'s 
products as a premium product with relation to the others.

What I\'m trying to say is that there are many different approaches to 
pricing, and it depends on how you want to position your product and 
what your marketing goals are.  Although, as you posited, chargeing 
as much as you can get for a product is a viable pricing strategy, it 
is definitely not the only one.  There are many instances where a 
company may charge less than what they could get for a product 
because it fits their marketing goals.  This happens a lot with 
product lines that are meant to be perceived as discount/high volume 
items.  The company may want to go for volume, or they may want to 
establish their trademark in a certain way, or they may want to be 
lower than the competition, or they...

Get the picture?  I remember an extreme case that occurred when I was 
working my way through 
school.  I worked at a jewelry store, and we sold this 14K gold watch 
for $3,500.  A new store opened up down the mall and had the same 
watch for $600!  I was talking to the new store manager, and he told 
me that they had sold about 6 of the watches that year.  I went back 
to my store to look up the store records.  We had only sold one that 
year.  

On the surface, it looks like the new store had the right idea--they 
had sold 6 to our 1.  But, then I looked up our cost on the watch to 
figure profit, and in turn, used that information to figure the 
profit margin for the new store.  

And you know what I found?  The new store would have to sell 14 of 
the $600 watches to 1 of our $3500 watches to make the total dollar 
amount in profit!  We frequently had half price sales, and even if I 
sold the watch for $1750, we still made more than 7 sales at the $600 
figure.

This experience taught me a lot about marketing and price strategy.  
It also helped that I was studying that subject at that time in 
school.  Of course, there are other factors to consider.  There\'s the 
inventory cost of having the item in the case for so long, the 
opportunity cost of not having an item that would move more 
frequently, and so on.

Again, my point is that price strategy is a complicated matter, and 
there are many different reasons a company will price a product a 
certain price.

If I had to guess, I would bet that IG has not put this much thought 
into their pricing.  I actually think that they are using the cost 
plus how-much-do-we-need-to-make-on-each-item method, and they keep 
this in line, as much as they can, with the prices established for 
like products in the market.

I also know in publishing that prices come down the more the 
circulation is because of economies of scale.  Since Traveller is 
new, the prices are somewhat high compared to, say, an established 
product like TSR\'s AD&D.  Maybe we\'ll see those come down if 
Traveller takes off and is the huge success that we all want it to 
be.  Then again, if Traveller is this big of a success, there is a 
chance that prices will not be lowered but establish a new status 
quo.  If that happens, the rest of the industry will raise prices to 
meet what IG is charging.

There are many reasons that IG is charging what it does for the 
products.  Let\'s just hope that the quality of the product makes it 
worth the price.

Hi Kenneth,

Your points are correct, and it just serves to further my point (which I 
suppose I didn\'t state forcefully enough): the belief that pricing must be 
related to cost is erroneous.  As a producer (or retailer, or wholesaler, 
or whatever) you can pursue whatever pricing strategy you wish.  There is 
no law that says each item can only produce X amount of profit.  

And, as I stated in a previous post, the market will let IG know whether 
their pricing strategy (whatever it is) is correct.  Complaining about it 
won\'t do a bit of good.  Their sales figures will give them the answer, 
by and by.

Hmmm...I\'d like to know what game?  AD&D is about $50-$60, WW is about $30
at least, Star Wars is $35, T4 is $30, Paranoia is $25, Call of Cthulthu is
$30.  Except for rulebooks in the 50-100 page realm, I can\'t think of a
$22.95 rulebook nowadays that runs a respective amount of pages (ie. 150-250)

Hi Ernest,

I agree.  IG (under Ken Whitman) made a series of mistakes; IG (under 
Courtney Solomon) has now made a mistake as well.  It happens; no one is 
perfect.  What matters is their response to the situation after the 
mistake is pointed out.

I don\'t think either Ken Whitman or Courtney Solomon set out a business 
plan titled, "How Best to Screw our Customers."  [grin]  They made 
mistakes (mistakes which we, being outside of the process, can easily 
spot and which we think could easily have been avoided - but we don\'t 
know what the circumstances were; we weren\'t there).  They\'ve fixed 
some problems, and they\'re in the process of fixing others.

An example: shipping methods; now they will be using bubble mailers and 
US Priority Mail, rather than plain manilla envelopes and 4th class 
mail.  If that doesn\'t work satisfactorily, they\'ll undoubtedly try 
another method.  

Another example: T4 had a lot of errata, and a tremendous amount of  
grammatical/typographical errors.  But look at CSC and Aliens - what an 
improvement!  Heck, even _Starships_ did better in that department. 

Yet another example: _Starships_ was a poorly crafted product.  IG and AP&D 
are well aware of that now, and they have a better idea of what consumers 
want.  The quote from Courtney is something like, "We will make up for 
_Starships_ with future products."  In other words, they\'re going to work 
hard to avoid making the same mitake twice.

I really don\'t think IG\'s on the ragged road to disaster.  They\'ve had 
problems, and they have dealt with them.  They will undoubtedly continue 
to have problems; the key is in not making the same mistake twice.  As 
long as they continually improve their processes, I\'ll be upbeat about 
Traveller\'s future.

Absolutely.  When I picked up T4 at Gen-Con, I was at the peak of my 
excitement over the product.  But after reading a couple of chapters, I was 
shaking my head.  I told Carole (my wife) that I was very disappointed in 
the editing job they had done.  

But, as time has gone on and sales have been solid, I\'ve had to admit 
that I\'m probably no longer able to relate to the new customers and their 
perception of this product.  It\'s hard to keep in mind how I dealt with 
error-laden products in the past.  The most recent one that I can 
remember was _Shadowrun_.  For one thing, the first edition made the 
character creation option of putting the highest emphasis on wealth a 
way of making a super-character.  Did I throw out the book?  Did I never 
buy another supplement?  Nah.  We just changed the top number of nuyen to 
be 500,000 instead of one million (or whatever; I forget what the figures 
were at this point).  _Shadowrun_ was still a great game at its core.

T4 is a great game, too.  We old timers can easily fix the errors on our 
own.  Newbies won\'t notice some errors, and will fix the others as best 
they can - just like we\'ve all done in the past.

[pause]

During the pause above, I got a phone call from Marc Miller.  He told me 
that he is actively discussing a change in graphics design for T4.  
Specifically, he wants a true graphic design specialist working on the T4 
product line.

So, there ya go - a real-time example of product improvement in the T4 
line! :)

Not even Terran economies worked that way past the 19th century or so.
The Imperium\'s remarkably stable currency was the basis for a large and
complex interplanetary banking system. Most monetary transfers take place,
not in kind nor in coin, but in bookkeeping transactions in the
computerized ledgers of Imperially chartered banks.

Not necessarily. The local branch of the Imperial Bank (whatever its title)
says "Umpteen billion credits have been transferred from the accounts of
Mikesh\'s planetary government to the local account of the Imperial
Treasury."
The Imperial treasurer (whatever his title) then sends a message to the
local branch of the imperal bank which says "Transfer X billion credits
from the imperial treasury account on Mikesh to accounts of these
industries, and deduct Y billion credits from the local imperial account"
(offplanet transfer of funds)
So... Y billion fewer credits are available to the local branch of the
imperial bank to loan, invest, or do whatever.

And why would that <censored> Lucan strip the Corridor of naval fleets but
leave their maintenance budget alone?  No, he\'s going to transfer imperial
credits to where *he* wants the maintenance and shipbuilding done. In fact,
that\'s no doubt a good part of the reason he has such trouble keeping his
imperium together: taxes are NOT being fed back into the planetary
economies, as they were in normal times.

The only way the local brevet admiral has the credits to build new ships
and keep the local economy busy, as well as to fight the Vargr, is to
convince the local nobility, up to the sector duke, to rebel against Lucan
by withholding taxes. How long will these worthies dither before finally

You find some rockball where *everybody* goes to refuel and *nobody* wants

You establish yourselves first at low class spaceports, low population, low

NOTES: Wedge airframe configuration. No small craft carried. The ship has
three labs (usually used
for Biology, Botany and Geology). Normal crew complement includes 1
Engineer, 2 Maneuver, 2 Electronics, 1 Gunner, and 3 Science specialists.
One of the scientists usually doubles as the ship\'s medic. The scientists
each get one small stateroom, and the crew uses the other three, 2 persons
to a stateroom. It takes 2.6 hours to process the ship\'s fuel load. The ship
can scoop 4.3 tons of fuel per hour.

The SEARCHER Class Scout Explorer was an attempt to come up with a
\'replacement\' for the ubiquitous Scout/Courier. It failed. The ship\'s
miniscule cargo capacity, in addition to seriously limiting it\'s exploration
range, made it unviable as a merchant vessel after it\'s useful service life
was over, which meant that mny Detatched Duty scouts did not want it. Thus
the few that were built remained in service or were scrapped. It\'s major use
was for mapping and surveying missions within easy reach of a Scout base. An
interesting feature of it\'s design was the decision to forego 
lasers entirely, depending on a missle turret for offense and a sandcaster
for defense.

dismissed Phil\'s ideas too easily.

One thing no one has mentioned yet is the table in DGP\'s World Builder\'s 
Handbook which gives minimal tech levels for starports.  

Regardless of the mainworld\'s starport, the starport has a minimal tech 
level based on its classification:

Starport type  Minimum TL:

Class A          10
Class B          9
Class C          8
Class D          7

Now, this seems about right for the Year 0 era
It seems a bit low for 1110, and if I were 
doing it, I would would change it to

(John\'s Year 1110 table)

Class A         13
Class B         12
Class C         11
Class D         9


In any case, starports are clearly enclaves of higher technology on 
low-tech worlds.  I\'ve always ruled that Class A and B starports are 
actually Imperial-owned territory, but this is non-canon.

Anyway, I agree with Leonard and others who have suggested a "3rd world" 
model for low-tech planets with good starports.  Obviously, the locals on
a TL 8 world did not build their own Class A starport.  Therefore, this
starport was build by an outside concern (the Imperial government, a
megacorp, the IISS...) for some reason.  This reason could be anything
thing from the fact that the world occupies a strategic military position,
to the presence of valuable resources on the world that some megacorp
wants to the world simply being in a highly desirable location for a
refuel and refitting stop located between two groups of wealthy worlds.  I
would imagine the latter case would be especially common along pathways
through rifts. 

Once the starport has been built, technology will leak out.  No, I don\'t 
believe that the average low-middle class office worker on such a planet 
will have a TL 13 hand computer, but their boss might, and the CEO of 
their company almost certainly will.  On such worlds, individual access to 
technology will depend largely on wealth.  Some essentials like medicine 
and power generation might be widely available if the government exists 
to help the citizens rather than simply to use them, but hi-tech personal 
possessions are only going to belong the the upper middle class on up.

This will make for some fascinating worlds, which have a feel somewhere
between"cyberpunk" and the new game Fading Suns.  While this is certainly
not the mainstream of Traveller, such worlds will provide a fascinating
level of diversity to the Imperium.  Where else can you have worlds with
both TL 7 cars and TL 12 grav vehicles existing side by side, or even TL 5
"model T\'s", horse carts, and grav vehicles all in the same city.  Such
worlds would provide many scenarios for GMs interested in social politics.

Thanks for your insights.  My initial comments were made somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but 
this is, I suppose, a real issue, especially for those playing in the TNE setting where 
many Zhodani refugees have moved into the Spinward Marches (if their games are R-rated, 
PG, anyway).  

Another thing for us to bear in mind is that mores change over time.  Not that long ago 
- -- about 5,000 years, I think -- it was not uncommon for Egyptian siblings to marry.  
Who knows what living arrangements will be found 3,000+ years from now, among a human 
population far exceeding today\'s?

Actually if the Vargr were in position to intercept couriers then was
probably much too late for those funds to then be used for ship
building or possibly even reactivating mothballed ships.  The time
line IIRC is the Corridor fleet departed about 245-1117 and by
001-1118 Corridor was in Chaos.

Your right of course, for some reason I had been thinking that
Corridor may have had the view that the reserve fleets would have
been sufficient to defend against the Vargr (I think Hans may have
suggested it but I\'m not sure).  Had that been the case there would
be no pressing need to quickly rebuild the fleet.

Loren Wiseman\'s article, _Champa Interstellar Starport_, in JTAS #7
describes an "extrality" fence that delineates the boundary of a
starport. Inside the extrality fence Imperial law rules - since
starports are Imperium Bases - and outside the fence local laws
prevail.

The same could easily be said for tech levels.

I\'ve always figured that the TL givin in a world\'s UWP reflects the 
tech level of goods that can be produced locally (exclusive of the 
effects of importing high TL goods).

Depending on local culture, government, and laws (including import
and export restrictions), the amount of high tech imports will
certainly vary and, perhaps, allow production of goods above the
local TL - as long as the imports continue, or until the local TL
improves (regardless of cause or time required for the change).

Will all local TLs climb to match the average Imperium TL in every
case? Probably not. Will some? Will none?

In my campaigns, a world\'s UWP governs what it\'s like outside the
confines of starports, and Imperium laws and maximum TL govern what
it\'s like inside the confines of starports.

As to whether or not the Imperium actually owns a specific starport,
leases it, runs it at the request of a local government, has a local
government run it for them, lets out 10 year contracts to the lowest
bidder to operate and maintain it, or some other variation, I can
only imagine that many possibilities exist pertaining to the details
of starport ownership. Certainly, there are at least as many
possibilities as there are readers of the TML. :-)

For me, starports within the Imperium are Imperium bases (by and
large), Imperium law and maximum TL are applied inside starports,
UWPs are applied outside starports, and all sorts of relationships
can exists between individual worlds and the Imperium that governs
the space between them.

I was trying to make two points.

1) Big companies screw up too, just like little companies.

2) In business, unlike in the game, the rules are the rules; no house
versions allowed. What you don\'t know can hurt you. Again, consider GDW,
Gygax and Dangerous Journeys. The content problems, typos, and editorial
mistakes can be corrected in later editions. Business management mistakes
can be much harder to fix. That is why I hope the Sweet Pea folks are indeed
BUSINESS people. 

Traveller is great, unique game. For it to succeed or fail on it\'s own merit
is one thing, to lose it because someone did not understand the basics of
business management (production scheduling, cost accounting, tax & insurance
rules) would be tragic beyond words.

That is the _effect_. What happens is of course that the Mikesh government 
writes a check to the Imperium for the amount and some time later the local 
starship yard on Mikesh does some work for the Imperium which the Imperium 
pays for by check. The starship yard then pays its employees and 
subcontractors who use it to buy groceries etc. As long as the Imperium 
dosen\'t use any of the credit to buy stuff on Mikesh and ship it somewhere 
else, Mikesh dosen\'t lose any actual wealth.

>If so who ends up paying the salaries for the Imperial Navy?  

That depends on what you mean by salary. If you mean the little rectangular
plastic pieces called Crimp-notes, then the Imperium pays them. If you mean 
the food they actually stuff their faces with, then whatever planet they are 
currently on feeds them. In return the planet gets some little rectangular 
plastic pieces which they collect and turn over to the Imperium the next
time they have to pay taxes.

There comes a time when it becomes necessary to transfer valuable stuff. You
wouldn\'t be alive if you couldn\'t buy food with your salary, for example.
That\'s what I mean by valuables. _Stuff_. Things grown or raised or dug up
out of the earth or manufactured. Money and credit is worthless if you can\'t
use it to buy something useful.

>I don\'t see why this won\'t work on an interstellar basis.  

Chris, I hereby solemly promise you that if you and I ever meet, I\'ll buy 
you a beer. Just remind me of this message and I\'ll buy you one. 

Now, have I just lost the price of a beer and have you just gained one? That 
depends. If I lived just down your street then the answer would be yes. If I
lived in the same city as you the answer would propably be yes. As it is the
answer is no unless you happen to come to Copenhagen some day.

Now I\'ll go one better. I promise that I\'l buy anyone (well, the first 
anyone) who comes to me with a signed note from you a beer.

Now, have I just given you a beer? That still depends. If you happen to know 
someone who is going to Copenhagen and who is willing to believe that I\'ll
keep my word, the answer is propably yes. You can give that person a note
in exchange for a beer and when he gets to Copenhagen I\'ll give him another
one instead.

Only, the beer didn\'t actually travel from Denmark to the US, did it? It was
produced in the US and consumed in the US. Nothing of actual value travelled
anywhere. In order for me to actually give you a beer, we\'d have to get  
some friendly tourist or airline stewardess who happens to be going from
Copenhagen to your city to carry the beer.

If there\'s no cargo transfer between two systems, no actual wealth can be
transferred (Except knowledge, which is a special case).

I\'m not talking about funds. With or without contact with Core, the raw
materials and the factories and the shipyards are all still there. They\'d 
still do the work. The rest is bookkeeping.

>Your suggestion that the government switches ship maintenance capacity to

But the wealth is still there. The mines don\'t stop producing ore just 
because the imperium in\'t there anymore. It really is a question of use it
or lose it. No central government would thank a cut-off governor for 
shutting down ship production.

True.  However, I mess the point you are making.  5-10 gallons of
water per crew position provide plenty of water for personal
use and can easily be convereted to sufficient oxygen to fill
an  interior of a ship.

I guess I dont\' think, given how well powered they are, that
starships are that sensitive to weight distribution.  Also,
they can already pump liquid hydrogen around but even this
seems pretty crude for a starship that has artificial gravity.

I think, if you look at Traveller, they already have shielding
which is superior.  I don\'t know what they use for heat
eualization (in fact my guess would be that, given traveller
materials local heating just isn\'t a problem) but carrying around
a lot of water so you can pump it around for that purpose
seems a lot like having to spin the ships so they get
heated evenly by the sun, it just seems crude for the
TL.

5-10 gals per crew position should be more than sufficient for
crew oxygen and Traveller ships already carry a lot more hydrogen
than you can get from storing water in "nooks and crannies".

A certain amount of water would be useful for multiple uses
(like for emergency oxygen or for person use).  However, past
that, if you want to carry more hydrogen, it makes more
sense to store hydrogen.

Terran economies works just that way today. An electronic money transfer
works only because the reciever trusts the sender to delivers something
useful some day in the future when the reciever tries to use the money
to buy something from the sender.

That is exactly my point. Most monetary transactions are bookkeeping 
transactions. But bookkeeping transactions aren\'t worth anything unless
they translate into actual wealth at some point.

What do you think those credits ARE? Promisory notes. IOUs. They\'re not

I\'m not talking about a budget. I\'m talking about mines producing ore,
factories producing subsystems, and ship construction workers assembling
ships. All the stuff that Lucan CAN\'T move away fom Mikesh.

Yes, and do you know how that works? He sends a fleet to some luckless
planet and demands that they maintain the ships. Once he\'s done that he
gives them a check for umpteen million credits backed by (among other)
the electronically transferred credit from Mikesh. Now, how are they going 
to use that to get anything valuable from Mikesh?

Money is not a magic substance that turns into anything useful at the
wave of a hand. The only way to take anything out of a planetary
economy is to load something valuable onto a cargo ship and jump away.
(Or to build a ship and jump away with it ;-).

OK, so on Day 001-1117 the Mikesh Government sends an electronic message
by courier to Lucan with the local taxes. How does that make them any
poorer and Lucan any richer? The next year Mikesh sends Lucan a note of
defiance instead. How does that make them any richer and Lucan any poorer?

Agreed. According to _Rebellion_ the Corridor fleets are withdrawn in early
1117. This explicitly includes the subsector fleets. What isn\'t clear is 1)
how big a percentage of the local planetary defense forces that are jump-
capable and 2) whether those forces were added to the Corridor fleets when
they withdrew. My own suggested answers for those two questions is "20%" 
and "Yes". Neither has any canonical backing.

Agreed.

And where do you get these units? Each of them is commanded by a captain and
a crew who is in it for the profits. If it\'s an ally, how do you persuade 
him to go first and if it\'s a follower, are you sure you want to cripple
your forces so that another Corsair band can move in and take over once
you\'ve exhausted yourself reducing the defenses?

Oh, I agree that the low-population worlds are wide open. Even the low-medium
worlds are in trouble. Trade might dry up, depending on just how big the
merchant fleet really is (If the merchant fleet is as big as I personally
think it should be there are some really nasty tricks that can be improvised.
however, since I\'ve no canonical backing for my estimates, I won\'t go into
that). But I can\'t wait to hear how you\'re going to go about plundering a 
high-population or even a high-medium population world.

The Vargr would never be in a position to intercept military couriers. Using 
drop tanks a courier can go 12 parsecs between bases. A courier from Mikesh 
(Corridor 0206) could jump to Kaasu (Corridor 1209), a world defended by 6.3 
trillion credits worth of TL 16 system defenses. From there it could jump 
Kukish (Corridor 1606), a world with 5.6 trillion credits worth of TL 15
system defenses. From there it could jump to Plunge (Corridor 2505), a world
with 5.6 trillion credits worth of TL 14 defenses. From there it is only a 
jump to Vland Sector.

Besides, once again, why would any Vargr corsair admiral bother to try?
Where\'s the profit?

Assuming the ships are available (a very reasonable assumption) Mikesh alone
can reactivate 1200 50,000 T cruisers in 10 weeks. (Actually, I don\'t say
that there would be 1200 50,000 T cruisers mothballed at Mikesh. It would
be a much more varied mix and some of them would take longer to reactivate
(a 1,000,000 T ship would take 12 weeks).

I did indeed. So they would\'ve.

Lucan ordered the withdrawal of the entire Corridor fleet, including the
reserve fleets. Possibly (even likely) also the jump-capable parts of
the planetary defense fleets. He may even have had the first batch of
reactivated ships included (depending a bit on the timing). I don\'t deny
that if the commanders in Deneb and Vland don\'t send some ships into 
Corridor to cover for them (much the likeliest turn of events, IMO), the
Vargr would have had a field day in Corridor for some months. My argument
is that they wouldn\'t be strong enough to breach the defenses of the high-
population worlds, and it is precisely the high-population worlds that are
capable of building more ships. Once those worlds have had some time to 
make good the lost ships, the Vargr would be kicked out again.

If you recall, I did a rough estimate of the figures that were suggested
for basing capacity on price and found them to be comparable to the TCS
method, so I don\'t see why you shouldn\'t use either. Obviously the TCS
rule is a simplification, an average. Some worlds would have larger
shipyard capacity than 1 T per 1000 citizens, others would have smaller.
Btw. the TCS rules does take some account of using more workers and more
money to increase production speed.

Were the Vargr quickly "kicked out again?"

Anyway, there are a couple of points you might be missing.  

First, Lucan *probably* didn\'t withdraw *all* his forces.
Certainly, he took the attack fleet with him...and as much of the mobile
reserve as possible, but I would expect he left strong military presence on
major worlds.  Why?  So he could insure that the shipyards kept building
ships, the schools keep churning out crews, and the replacement ships he
needed kept coming toward Core and out of Corridor.  The Officers Lucan
left in Corridor probably were under orders to *ruthlessly* extract as much
as possible and not to worry about what happened to minor systems...hence
the Vargr incursions.  At some point the remaining Officers would have
decided to "take over" where they were, and/or the local governments would
have decided to "take out" the Officers.  Civil unrest (if not war) would
have sweep through the sector.  With the factions not
supporting Imperial claiments exactly, mainly just local systems attempting
to reassert local control.

Second, there was probably a serious psychological backlash from all the
turmoil.  I imagine anti-war and peace movements all over the place.  If
Lucan continued to take wealth (and sons and daughters) *out* of the
systems it would have occured to them that he was bleeding them dry, and
that wouldn\'t go over very well.  In the end, it\'s likely that the major
systems would develop very isolationist tendencies.  The major systems
could defend themselves, sure, they were also self-suffcient, so they would
have hunkered down to ride out the hard times, and let the outside worlds
fend for themselves.

I don\'t play in that particular universe, so my comments are pure
speculation. <g>

I think that the Vargr would do just the opposite.  The Vargr would
need to hit the high population industrialized world as fast and as
hard as they can.  If they don\'t then the Vargr will be allowing
these planets the chance to start building and reactivating ships by
the thousands (the Hi Pop Industrial Production from Hell scenario
that Hans has been championing).  After securing these worlds you can
then go after the rest.

I pretty much agree with you on how Vargr will actually try and gain
control of worlds.

Right.  Closed except when you open the airlock to the starport.  Minor

This is what I was kind of arguing for, but I like (and should have

than keeping it in semi-liquid form.

The rest of your post is excellent and just what I was trying to prompt

Hmm, the expression "shitting bricks" could be given a whole new meaning;

"Where have you been?"

"Our last jump dropped us outside the Oort Cloud of this system.  We\'ve

Over the Edge.

But really, Starships is only 96 pages long. The last 96-page RPG rulebook
I bought was D6 (80 pages, actually) and it was $10! Greg Porter\'s new
Epiphany game is $15. Starships was $23.

Every other page for the first and longest section of Starships might as
well be blank; the ship "plans" -- except for the cross-section plan of
the starliner -- might as well not have been there, and I\'m a *new* player
of Traveller and have never seen any of the "classic" ship floorplans.
Some of the stats given don\'t jibe with the ship design system, which I
could have downloaded as PDF and printed myself.

I am extremely unhappy with my Starships purchase, and have cancelled my
standing order for Traveller products at the local game store. I still may
pick up M0, because beneath it all, there\'s a damn fascinating game
waiting to be played here.

The troubling part is that they didn\'t understand the legalities

The reason people are "going ballistic" is because there\'s a *pattern*
of mistakes here. And rather than admit that they made some *major*
goofs and accept the losses, they are taking measures that are illegal
to avoid the losses.

I understand about making mistakes. I\'v made enough myself. But IG
isn\'t *taking responsibility* for their mistakes. Sure, it may cause
major financial problems to eat the shipping charges. But the *fact* is
that by law they don\'t haver a choice. And all it will take is *one*
complaint and they\'ll be out of business.

Just like Traveller, the business world has rules. But unlike
Traveller, if you break the rules, you are in *real* trouble.

IG has every right to *ask* people if they are willing to pay the
shipping charges that they neglected to list. But if someone says "no"
andasks for the product *as advertised*, then they may have problems.
I\'m not up on that part of the law.

I *do* know that with the way they\'ve charged credit cards, both for
the original books, and now for the shipping charges, they *will* lose
the ability to accept credit cards if someone files an official
complaint and follows up. That *alone* is bad news.

The problem is that Ignorance is *not* an acceptable excuse. Nor does
it speak well for the company.

IG hasn\'t yet learned that they cannot *unilaterally* take actions that
cost other people money. 

They are *required* to not charge credit cards until product ships.
They are *required* to get permission for "overlooked" charges like the
shipping. And if the person doesn\'t agree to the extra charges, they
have to refund the original charges as well. 

They may or may not have to supply things at the advertised price in
spite of their own error. As I understand the rules on such, the
mistake they made isn\'t the kind that they can excuses with an "it
should have been obvious" (example: if a store advertises a $100 item
for $10, they can claim that the error was obvious and not honor the
ad. If they advertise a $25 item for $20, they\'re stuck) But this sort
of thing could require a lawsuit to determine.

The stuff about charging credit cards does *not* require a lawsuit. 

IG may be making honest mistakes. But if you make an honest *fatal*
mistake, you are just as dead as someone who makes a *stupid* fatal
mistake. 

And that\'s the problem. They don\'t seem to realize how *serious* their
mistakes are.

I\'d say that the development of the fusion rocket marks the end of the
tech-8 and beginning of the tech-9 period.  

It is interesting that GSbAG was founded *before* the development of the
jump drive.  This fact and "Sternshiffbau" in GSbAG\'s name implies that 
GSbAG originally meant to build STL starships in the Lunar yards.  This
is no surprise; we know the Terrans were doing this by 2050, at least.

Trillion Credit Squadron says that Longrange was only the most ambitious
of several large Terran STL colonization projects.  I suspect that ships
were also sent to Prometheus (Alpha Centauri) before jump.  If we allow
the Imperium board game to be fact, there\'s not one, but *two* worlds
with breathable atmospheres in the Alpha Centauri system, one around A
and one around B.  They might have been spotted by Terran astronomers,
and a mission sent; this might be what the US was up to when the ESA was
working on Longrange.  A 0.20c ship could get there in 22 years.  An
0.80c ship could get there in five and a half years (and Terra could
know about mission success or failure within ten years of launch).  This
could allow Terra to colonize both and get them to world status by the
First Interstellar War, as portrayed in Imperium.

I\'d also say that the Terrans have contragrav by 2087.  The UNSCA lab in
the Belt that discovered jump drive was working on more efficient drives
to haul ore, and I don\'t think fusion rocket research would lead to that.
Gravitic research might, and the T4 contragrav drives are annoying enough
that this would make a lot of sense.

I played lots of Classic Traveller in the 80\'s, then left gaming for
a while.  I recently decided to reenter, heard about T4, and bought
the rules book, Starships, CSC, and Aliens.  I almost hate saying it,
but there has been very little improvement in 20 years. Beyond the
non-Traveller related color artwork (the artist\'s name escapes me,
but I have a book of his artwork, he has an easily recognized style),
you have the almost comical hump-backed ships and vehicles, the
pitiful starship deckplans (Traders and Gunboats was FAR superior),
the unforgivable missing jump potential table, several missing

I have been fine tuning my rules for calculating starship construction times

Gig                   20           45               5.88

OK, there are the figures.  Lemme clarify a few things first...

The construction time listed includes the entire time from beginning
construction to delivery, but it assumes the vessel has already been designed.

Maximum Workers is the approximate maximum number of workers that can work
on the vessel at one time.

The above times assume a shipyard working 8 hour days and 6 day weeks, that
is working on the vessel 48 hours out of every 168.  It also assumes that
the maximum number of workers allowed are working on the ship that entire
time.  Finally it assumes 52 weeks per year.

OK, now, I\'ll return to lurk mode for a while and watch the responses to see
how believable my system is. :)  Please let me know. :)

  When working on the accommodations for crew and passengers:

  1. Does one use the entire given volumes for the stateroom/

     common areas (Lounges, Promenades, Dining Salons, etc.)?

  2. If the latter, what\'s the canonical source for this, and
     what\'s the ratio (I can\'t find it in either FFS or
     Starships)?

  3. Are corridors included in the "common" allocation, or is
     this a separate allocation (using up some of the 10-20%
     slop volume)?  Does one also include corridors in the
     volume allocation for other kinds of rooms?  Again, what
     ratio?

  4. Does one include the \'fresher in the allocation for the
     stateroom, or is this a separate (0.5td) allocation?

  5. Does anyone have a VISIO 4.0 stencil set for starships?
     The OFFICE stencil is good for _some_ of the stuff, but not
     all of it, and I don\'t have a HOME stencil which might

  6. What is the personal luggage allocation per crew, command,

Simple. Regardless of things like artificial gravity, if you "push" on
the ship somewhere, it will pivot around its "center of gravity (which
is really the "center of mass distribution"). 

This means that thrusters are "paired up" to given equal "moments" on
opposite sides of the CG. If they are translational thrusters (ie
designed to move the ship as a whole in a given direction) if you don\'t
"balance" thrusts about the CG, you will start the ship spinning. 

With rotational thrusters (ones designed to rotate the ship about one
of its axes) if the thrusts aren\'t balanced about the CG you wind up
with rotation that you don\'t want (ie you do a burn to rotate the ship
90 degrees, and then as it swings thru 45 degrees you do a reverse burn
to stop the rotation. If the thrusters aren\'t balanced, instead of
stopping at 90, you\'ll wind up with the ship still rotating).

Also, you put extra stress on the ship\'s structure if the thrusts
aren\'t balanced. And the main drive\'s thrust had *better* be pointed
thru the CG or the ship will spin out of control like a pinwheel!

Sure you can adjust thrusters to some extent. But that extent is
limited. More importantly, you *can\'t* adjust the main drive very much.
*Amount* of thrust, yes, *direction*, no. And it\'s a lot cheaper to
redistribute the mass on the ship than to burn extra fuel in the
thrusters! 

So you need to be able to keep nass distribution of the ship balanced
so that the CG *stays* where it is supposed to be. Most of this is done
by paying attention to the mass of cargo containers and loading them so
they balance. But you\'ll always have some off center mass to compensate
for. Then add in the crew and passengers moving around. 

Balancing loads is one of the things that give ship captains
nightmares. And it won\'t be any different in space. Heck, they\'ll have
to worry about balancing it for optimum thruster performance as *well*
as to keep the main thrust axis thru the CG.

In battle, being able to *quickly* shift *tons* of mass around to keep
the ship balanced in spite of battle damage (like punctured fuel tanks)
could mean the difference between life and death. And since water is
the *densest* common liquid, it\'s the best candidate.

Just remember, it\'s all a matter of moment arms and moments of inertia.
And they have to balance or bad things happen, regardless of tech level.

I don\'t have details handy, but there are systems available *now* that
partially reprocess sewage, and do it in a space small enough to make
them practical inside a *house*. Do an article search on "composting
toilets". 

Some day I\'ll have the time, disk space and access to research a lot of
this stuff.

Anybody who has *ever* had to deal with a "honey tank" will go quite a
bit out of their way to avoid having to deal with it again! And since
heat is essentially "free" onboard ship, why not bake it dry? :-)

You do have some oxygen at one point in the Bethe cycle if I\'m
remembering correctly. But it gets turned back to carbon, if you take
it out, you\'d have to replace it with more carbon *and* hydrogen.

The temps required for fusing heavier elements so up *very* fast. And
the energy output drops pretty fast.

Consider: The basic reaction we are assuming is 4 H(1) -> He(4) + energy.
That liberates something like .1% of the mass as energy. Now if we go
farther and generate oxygen from the helium (by whatever path), the
reaction for *that* is:
	4 He(4) -> O(16) + energy
Compare the mass of 4 helium atoms and one oxygen atom and you\'ll find
that the mass difference is *really* small. And if you want to squeeze
all the energy you possibly can out, you keep fusing things until you
hit iron. Fe(56) is *the* most stable nuclear configuration. You can\'t
get energy out of it by fusion *or* by fission.

Silly idea time. While I seriously doubt that this would produce enough
excess energy to be worth it, a trick that might be possible at high
tech levels is fusing your hydrogen all the way to iron, then using
artificial gravity to form miniature black holes out of the iron. The
black holes give off Hawking radiation, which can be tapped for power,
then you collect the hydrogen that is left and feed that back into the
fusion reactor. In essence, you have a total conversion power plant. :-)

Dive tanks are intended to be safely used by people who aren\'t too
bright. Tanks in a ship, even one expected to go into combat can have a
*much* lower safety factor.

As for shrapnel or beam hits on the tanks, if that happens, the tank
will be venting to *outside*. So you won\'t get double pressure.

However, they may have built a lot more than you might think. Economics
being what they are, if something can be built or "mostly" built by
lower tech, it *will* be. 

For example, concrete goes back to Roman times. So even on a very *low*
tech world, expect to see runaways being done by "native" labor. The
people backing the port will supply the rebar, and engineers to
*assist* the locals. The locals will do the work *and* supply much of
the materials and labor. This is much like the way things get built in
the third world now. They use mass labor instead of power equipment
whenever it is cheaper. And "cheaper" is often a matter of "it costs
the same, but we\'d have to import more bulldozers..."

Similar things will apply to other types of construction. Interesting
real world example (and *not* third world). In Hong Kong they use
*bamboo* for scaffolding around buildings being worked on. And it
actually works better than the steel kind!

So throw things like the local equivalent of "elephants" being used as
tow tractors to haul ships to hangars at your players.

I expect that the Imperium *and* the locals may go in for something
like the "appropriate technolgy" movement. This boils down to "use high
tech where you *need* high tech, use low tech where it does the job ok"

This won\'t affect individual purchases much. But companies and more
intelligent governments will spend money on high tech stuff that is
*useful* rather than high tech just to have high tech. 

Another real world example: Aswan High dam in Egypt was built to show
how modern Egypt was. It has been a net *loss* to the country. It is
silting up rapidly (I think they figure it has less than 10 years
left), and the power it generates is barely enough to power the
factories that produce the fertilizer that they have to use now that
the annual floods don\'t replace the topsoil.

Most third world countries have such "showpieces" that actually do
*nothing* for the country. Only dictatorships are likely to have such
in Traveller, as there will be *far* too much historical evidence
showing how stupid such things are.

Of course the players *could* be hired to carry out some job associated
with such a "useless" project. Which will put them between the
"planetary pride" people and the "bread not guns" people. :-)

It\'s good to know that there are concrete examples of how customer 
feedback on this list improves Traveller products.

I\'m glad Marc realizes the importance of good graphic design, and that 
recent products have fallen short. My optimism has been renewed. Thanks 
for the inside scoop, Joe! :-)

Founders Ship Works announced today the launching of  the first of
many Founder 5000 cargo ships.   These  5000 ton ships are designed
around a sphere haul, with Jump one and 1 g acceleration.  Gathery
Haulmart,  Design Engineer  for the project, said, " The Founder 5000
is designed on one principle and that is to make credits for the user.
 In order to carry out this mission  the objective was cargo space,
because, as any business man knows its how much you get there to sell
that keeps you in the black."  Mr. Haulment went on to say that
because the ship lacks armor and weapons it is best used on normal
shipping lanes. The Founder 5000 is their first interstellar design,
and they plan to launch another 5000 ton in system Lightening ship, to
carry the cargo from the Founder 5000 to its destination.  Founder
claims it will have a 3g acceleration ability using the latest
technology.


Founder Ship Works was officially started on Day One (Holiday) of the
First Year of the Imperium. Founder Ship Works specializes in large
cargo ships for both interstellar and system use.  It was founded by
several Interstellar companies  in order to use the newest technology
that the New Imperium has to offer.  For further information contact

PS
Someone want to know the construction time for submarines
Here are the times for the SeaWolf the US Navy latest Hunter Killer, 
and  for the Ohio Nucler Strategic missile sub

SeaWolf   tons 7,460 surfaced 9,137 dived  Time roughly 6 years
Ohio        tons 16,600             18750                2 years
  It seems tonnage is not the deteriuming factor in construction time 
My personal guess is the technology  and  amount of Internal 
equipment determines construction time.  The SeaWolf has been 
considered the Navy\'s most hi tech new toy and is a hunter so needs a 
lot of specilaized equipment.   The Ohio ia 18 years old its main 
tonnage comes from the 24 trident 1 or 2 which probably count for 
most of the wieght.  Its quicker t obuild since the Tridents are 
built by Lockheed and then added later.

This information comes from Janes Fighting Ships 1996-97

I hope this helps

This, too, caused me much joy.

 Now, if someone would just tell IG that what they\'re doing with people\'s
credit cards and JTAS postage is ILLEGAL, things may start moving in the
right direction again.

Since there obviously has to be a second printing of T4\'s main rulebook, to
correct the many mistakes in it, I\'d suggest getting any designer started
on that immediately. Get it to look halfway decent. STARSHIPS is beyond
help, while Alien Archive and Central Supply seem at least able to stand on
their own (though each use different font sizes (sigh)).

PS. Any other Mac artists out there? I\'m looking for a good layout program
that has easy-to-use grid capabilities.

I would tend to presume multiple shifts. Shutting down and restarting some

only 8 hours of work.

Remember, IG is on vacation (read: unavaiable for comment) until the 
2nd.  Both Marc and Tim have said they will be talking with Courtney as 
soon as they can after his return, to try to straighten that mess out.  
Once Courtney is aware of the nature of the situation, I have a feeling 
the charges will be credited back.  I\'m hoping for good news on this 
front by the end of the week or the beginning of next week; we\'ll see 
what happens.

Wait a minute.  You already have water, hydrogen, and oxygen aboard ship, and plenty of 
power.  Does it really cost anything more to recycle them as we\'ve discussed?  How much 
more fuel will you use running the recycling?  

You will have to pay for the recycling machinery, but that\'s never been listed 
separately in ship design sequences.  (It should be deemed part of the "life support" 
cost item.)

No, the ship owner should be happy to have employees generating wealth for him.

If it turns out to be a necessity, they will.  Query whether passenger liners will incur 
the extra expense (maybe that\'s the cost differential between high and middle passage).

How \'bout that, eh? :)  Now, if only we were in a situation where TML was 
once again producing more positive stuff than bad, we\'d be home free. 
[G]  M0 and First Survey will probably generate some good stuff, but I 
think it\'s too late to do anything about the graphic design of those 
two.  But maybe everything will be fixed soon after...we can hope! :)

One variation that I have been considering, given that the Starport Down is
also Imperial territory, perhaps that chunk of land certain nobles are
granted in association with their titles is the very land on which the
downport is built. Part of the nobles income therefore is derived from the
operations of the port.

Of course, that could also mean that the noble is RESPONSIBLE to the Emperor
for the proper running of the port and conformance with the Imperial
Policies and Procedures on Starport Operation. Consider the Charlton Heston
movie \'The Warlord\'. His character of Sir Chrysagon was assigned a territory
with the proviso that it belonged to him and his heirs as long as the Duke
was satisfied with it\'s management. The land was still belonged to the Duke;
just administered by the Knight. When Chrysagon\'s action endangered the
fief, he lost it to his brother Drago\'s political machinations. Imperial
Nobility may have the same situation to content with.

Whole new set of problems for an ennobled PC to worry about, and not just
wander off with title and cash in hand.

   Actually what they are trying to do is get people to stop using
copyrighted images, filmclips etc. on their personal Web pages. They
were hired by Paramount to do this.  

   Though the Federation in Star Trek is this idealic place where
Liberalism wins the day, the same can\'t be said of Paramount\'s treatment
of sci-fi fans and particularly sci-fi gaming enthusiasts.  They are
quick to call in attorneys, and have pulled the license out from under
FASA to stop them from producing the Star Trek RPG (on the excuse they
violated their license agreement--which they didn\'t), and another
company to stop them from producing a collectable card game based on the
"Next Generation" storyline (with virtually no notice).  Paramount is no
friend of the gaming industry, and if I were looking to do a new scif-fi
game, Paramount is the *last* place I would go for a license.
   
   Remember that the next time you consider going to see Paramount films
in the theatre.

> It should make us appreciate the support and lattitude from FarFuture
> and Imperium Games for free exchange and development with Traveller. 

   For all of their understanding and the latitude they give people with
regard to Web page development and the use of copyrighted material
(which I applauded vigorously), IG in particular has dropped the ball
with regard to negotiating licensing agreements.  I know of two people
who have been quite serious about obtaining a license agreement with IG
only to have negotiations dragged out for several months and then be
terminated by IG with no explanation.  Both individuals have decided to
take their capital and invest it in other RPGs.  

   Sorry if this has turned into yet another IG et. al. bash, but I
think that it\'s yet another indicator of just how seriously the vast
majority of people currently producing Traveller take their job--it is
something they do part time when they aren\'t busy with their primary
projects--which makes Traveller on far too many occasions an
afterthought.  Because of that, we are seeing problems crop up that
range from poor editing to retread, unrelated art to a total lack of
strategic vision on the business side of the house.  My apologies to
people like Tony Lee who is probably busting his ass every day on this
project, but there are quite simply too few of people like him
associated with it.

Harold

Well, your calculation incorrectly assumes the expedition is a constant
20% of c.  Their destination is definitely much closer than 400 light
years away, as it probably would take them a long time to accel and
decel to and from that speed.

Very true...  Any trip that is going to take that long has to have a

going?

TRAVELLER has produced volumes of information on the universe\'s many alien

integrate alien races into their travels and adventures. Timothy Brown.

Great to see someone work out something that seems to be ignored greatly in
SF games. Thanks very much.

However (the big BUT! <g>), I\'m not sure I agree with your final figures.
Not that your math is wrong or anything, but the times seem really long, I
mean, 3 months for a Ship\'s Boat, 4 years for a Patrol Cruiser.  I
understand these take long, but still.  I\'d be interesed in seeing more of
the precise calculations.  Could you give one example, and show each
calculation that gave you the final result.

Thanks,

[Stuff about translational and rotational thruster deleted.]

Obviously, if the ship has a net force not directed through
the center of gravity it is going to start to rotate.  However,
a starship in traveller has thrusters which it can use to
control such rotation (they don\'t need to be separate
for the thrusters that provide thrust, ie your rotational
and translational thrusters).  Pumping water is a very slow
and crude way of mainting a flying object in a level position
(this is why airplanes don\'t do it).

Well no.  Rotation is caused by applying thrust around the center
of gravity.  If you want to rotate them you apply sufficient
thrust for sufficient time to ge the rotation you want.  If you
don\'t want rotation you apply your thrust through the center
of gravity (and if some weight pushes that off you adjust the
thrust).  This is how a helicoptor works and it doesn\'t need
to pump water around (and would find such an approach inadequate
if it tried it).

>Also, you put extra stress on the ship\'s structure if the thrusts
>aren\'t balanced. And the main drive\'s thrust had *better* be pointed

This is why you control it.  If you can\'t control your thrust
you aren\'t going to go where you want, no matter how much water
you pump around.

>Sure you can adjust thrusters to some extent. But that extent is
>limited.  More importantly, you *can\'t* adjust the main drive very much.

Um no.  A Traveller ship can produce enough thrust perpendicular
to the main axis to be able to fly horizonally.

No it isn\'t.  From harrier jump jets to helicopters to tilt
engine aircraft to saturn rockets; none of them try and move
mass rather than redirect thrust.  There are too many factors
involved (from mass changes to wind factors) and it\'s just
too slow.

>So you need to be able to keep nass distribution of the ship balanced
>so that the CG *stays* where it is supposed to be.

A ship with the kind of thrust a Traveller ship (and hence any
ship with VTOL capability) isn\'t going to be as sensitive to
mass balance as you indicate it is.

>Just remember, it\'s all a matter of moment arms and moments of inertia.
>And they have to balance or bad things happen, regardless of tech level.

And all those things need to be controlled on a time scale of
fractions of a second.  That is why the Space shuttle, Harrier
Jump jets, helicoptors, etc. all use thrust control.  Moving
water around just isn\'t fast enough.

Actually, in something as complex as a starship you aren\'t
going to armor each individual component that would cause
troubles if hit.  By the time you do that you could use
the same mass to armor the hull and protect the whole
ship.  You might just compartmentalize the ship and put in
safety systems, but you aren\'t going to armor individual
system.

(if your ship is being cut into by an enemy laser,
shrapnel from air tanks is only one thing on a long
list and you don\'t need to worry about the pressure
because you  are going to be venting your atmosphere
to space.

        (Sorry, jumping off the subject...)

        I thought that contragrav lifters were used only in TNE,
        and T4 uses anti-grav thrusters.

        Contragrav lifter (CG) was TNE device that countered
        external gravitic attraction within affected volume,
        and thus allowed objects to "float" within gravity
        fields. As the required energy depended only on the
        size of this affected volume, any amount of mass within
        this volume would float with the same input energy.
        (It was relatively easy to design perpetual motion
        powerplants with CG lifters.)

        Anti-grav thruster (AG) was MegaTraveller device that
        generated direct thrust using gravitic repulsion. While
        AG thruster worked well within strong gravity fields,
        it was virtually useless in deep space as there was no
        gravity fields to push against.

        So, which system should be used in T4 ?

The main problem is that the first products were extremely weak as far as
their usability for new Traveller players and GMs (like me) is concerned.
I can get around most of the pretty annoying problems in the main rules
(although this means that I have to rewrite more than 50% of the rules)
but the extremely weak follow-up product \'Starships\' was another bad blow.

You must consider that new fans are not as likely to forgive such botches
as are \'oldtimers\'.  When I want to try a new game I\'m willing to buy the
rules and maybe a supplement or two.  If by then I don\'t have enough to
play the game without needing to reinvent the wheel, the game usually will
be rated as \'not worth the trouble\'.  For T4 this currently *is* my
estimation.  I paid $25 for the softcover (actually about $37.50 due to
dollar <-> german marks conversion in rpg shops), I luckily got Starships
for free and right and thse materials are by far not enough if I want
to play in Milieu 0.  Now it seems that they want to pull off another
bloke by charging even more on my JTAS subscription, which I definitely
won\'t allow them to do :-|

All this is causing me some headaches and as much as I hate it I probably
will give up on Traveller (right now I\'m waiting to see the latest two
products; if they are really shining, IG might get another chance from me)

> I\'m happy that Traveller is not yet dead, and I want to give my support to IG

Right now I\'m more enthusiastic about whatever GRG might be doing than
about what IG still might produce.  They have done good stuff in the past
while everything I\'ve seen from IG did not hold up to my standards.

Oh well... a Happy New Year to you all!

Water is *free*. As I\'ve noted many times before, a ship will end a
trip with *more* water than it started with because human (and Vargr,
K\'kree, Hiver, etc) metabolism takes air and food and turns them into
water and CO2.

Heat (even *extreme* heat) is *free* from the fusion reactor. So
distilling water from waste is free. 

Electricity is cheap too. So electrolyzing things is cheap. Though it
may be easier to thermally crack both water and CO2. At temperatures
below p-p fusion temps, *all* molecular bonds break.

Many, many factory (and shipyard) type processes fit that description.
That\'s why 3 shifts is a common setup. That way you only have to shut
down things once a week.

Other processes proceed at their own pace and *can\'t* be stopped in the
middle (some phases of steel making, growing large single crystals for
semiconductor use, etc). For those you go to *four* shifts. And the
resulting schedules get a bit weird. For one thing, you *have* to go to
12 hour days or things get *way* too complicated. The shift schedules
for such will almost always be a two week cycle. But *which* days of
that cycle are work days and which are "off days" varies all over the
place. (I speak from experience!)

I am familiar with common septic systems *and* composting toilets.  what
we are talking about here, however, is a system which has, as input, human
waste, and needs, as output, edible food, with *a minimum of space used
for a minimum amount of time*.  Were talking about keeping the space down
to no more than 6 cubic meters per person (guesstimate) to handle all
their waste disposal needs andprovide them with most if not all of their
food supply.

Because it is arguably easier to put a hose in the honey tank and suck it
out than it is to send someone in to pick up all those bricks and haul
them out.  Like I said, I like your way, but that\'s why.

Oh, and having gotten up to my chin in the (clogged) septic tank at the
Boy Scout summer camp I worked in for a few summers, I know what you mean.
We were always glad to hear the "Caca-sucker" (with a Boston accent that
rhymes) coming down the road (once a week-whether we need it or not).

This is true, many (if not most) shipyards will work at least 1.5 shifts if
not 2 or 3 shifts.  Also, you are correct, there is some equipment that is
easier (read cheaper) to keep some equipment running rather than shut it off
and on.  The yard I worked at had some equipment like that, and most of that
type of equipment has an "idle" setting so that the machine can be kept idle
when not in use rather than being shut off.  We ran 1 regular shift, and a
second shift of painters and equipment maintenance crews only.  In times of
war or for rush jobs, I can immagine that a shipyard would run at least two
shifts if not three. I hope that makes sense.

Now on to Peter\'s comments...

Thank you, I enjoy it, and, since I worked at a shipyard, it is one way that
I can add some of my expertise to the game (I hope).

Well, the calculations are based on price and displacement tonnage.  I agree
that the Patrol Cruiser numbers don\'t sound right, but that is because the
price for the Patrol Cruiser is very high, that part of the formula needs
work.  The Ship\'s Boat (and other >100dt craft) are actually the main part
of my question.  I had to change the formula to get the numbers I did, and I
was really wanting to check the figures for the small craft more than
anything else.

Here are the formulae I used:

Construction:   D>99  use:   Tc = (0.208 * P)/(D^0.5)
                D<100 use:   Tc = (0.052 * P)/(D^0.5) 
                        Where:    Tc = Construction Time in Years
                                   P = Listed Price in MCr
                                   D = Displacement Tons

      Trials:   Jump  use:   Tt = ((P * 10)/D)/12
              Nonjump use:   Tt = ((P * 10)/D)/48
                        Where:    Tt = Trials Time in Years
                                   P = Listed Price in MCr
                                   D = Displacement Tons

      Design:   QSDS  use:   Td = 0.00
                SSDS  use:   Td = 0.02
                All Other:   Td = 0.08
                        Where:    Td = Development Time in Years

Total Time:   T = Td + Tc + Tt

There it is.  I just reviewed how I came to the 0.208 number and realized
that it should have been 0.196 instead and the 0.052 should be 0.049, this
will actually lower the construction times by a small amount.  The other
factor I forgot to include in the previous post that helped in coming to
these numbers was the average pay rate for the shipyard\'s hourly workers.  I
am assuming it to be 13Cr per hour, and unless someone has a cannonical
source for a different number, I will use that.  I also can post the method
that I used in arriving at the factors above if anyone is interested.

Hmm.  Wasn\'t the record for a Liberty Ship in WWII under a week?  I can\'t
recall the exact tonnage, but since it was a freighter I\'d assume its
towards 5000 tons.

Over a week ago, I compared the Terran conquest of the Ziru Sirka to the
Spanish conquest of the Aztecs. Over a week ago, Phil responded:

I\'m not so sure that tech-level made such a huge difference. Sure, the
Spanish had some pretty great armor, but they were outnumbered by
thousands to one; their armor wouldn\'t have amounted to squat if the
Aztec empire wasn\'t "ready" to fall. Their firearms were noisy and
scary, but not much more effective than bows for fighting unarmed men.
In fact, one could argue they were /less/ effective than bows because of
their much lower ROF. If the Aztecs had been less intimidated by
weirdos, these firearms would not have been so important.

At the risk of sounding very politically incorrect, I will agree with
you that one culture conquered (not "destroyed") another because it was
so much better, but I don\'t think it was the technology that made it
better. I think that the Aztecs simply prefered Spanish culture to their
own, in some cases at least. In those cases where the Spanish were
deemed inferior by the Aztecs (cooking, textiles, agriculture), the
Aztec culture has endured to this day. But in the case of politics, I
suspect most Aztecs prefered to be Spanish peasants than Aztec slaves.
In the case of religion, most Aztecs prefered to offer sacrifice than be
offered up as sacrifice. And in the case of language, most Aztecs
prefered the Spanish printing press to their own ideograms. (Those
Aztecs who were illiterate kept their old language to this day.) And of
course, the technology was nice too, but it didn\'t affect most people in
those days.

That may be true of the Aztec nobility, but I suspect the huge army of
Aztec slaves who marched with the Spaniards had some idea of what was
going on.

I suspect the same of the Vilani. Their leaders where clearly clueless
and confused, as you have pointed out. Their lower castes where at best
indifferent as to who ruled over them; that indifference being a trait
bred into them by an overbearing nobility. Those that were not
indifferent were probably chasing their own interests, working for their
relative "freedom" with the Terrans, or collaborating with the corrupt
upper castes against their own neighbors. The Vilani lost, and I think
the loss was a case of one culture conquering another because it was
so much better.

The irony is, after a few centuries, the new culture stops looking so
much better to some people 8^).

And, of course, Cortez, the emperor of Mexico, ultimately submitted to
his own government. Estigaribia, the emperor of Vland, did not.

This is the other end of the Islands Cluster colonization mission; they
end up at New Home, Neubayern, and Amondiage in the Old Islands subsector
of Reft.  They actually take about 2500 years and go almost exactly 500
light years, at a bit higher speed.  The flight is about 50 years shorter
subjectively due to relativistic effects.  They arrive at about the same
time Cleon is preparing to declare the Third Imperium on Sylea.

I have no proof, but I think this was a hedge against human extinction on
the Terrans\' part, in case of some disaster near Terra.  I suspect that
most Terran STL missions went to Alpha Centauri, due to the fact that they
found habitable worlds there immediately.  We know that none reached the
habitable worlds at Tau Ceti or Epsilon Eridani before 2099, or they would
have run into the Vilani in those systems.  The "2000 year" figure is 
directly from TCS; this might be silly rounding, or might be the ESA fibbing
a bit to hide the final destination of the Terran insurance policy, just
in case.

The military ships and lab ship have numbers that are a bit high.  What do
these ships have in common that is causing the increase?

Actually, the Spanish preferred (and used) crossbows in the damp climate of the region
and the Aztecs (properly Mexica) preferred slings to bows. The spanish actually feared the 
aztec slingers

Actually, the slaves were not used for war. Everyone in the military was a conscript who 
was promoted on the basis of prisoners captured. The aztecs had actually captured Cortes 
twice during one battle, but because they tried to drag him to the sacrificial altar, he was 
rescued. It was not til the final battles that the aztecs began to fight war european style (ie to 
the death, no prisoners unless necessary)
The "aztec prisoners" you speak of were more likely citizens of tlaxcalla (sp?) and other 
former vassal cities of the aztecs who had decided to change sides

What is being used for the sector data for Corridor?  I have Travellers\'
Digest 19 which has the sector data from 1119 and the information at the
Joe\'s Missouri Archive
(http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/archive/)seems to be the same. 

Is Trillion Credit Squadron the sole basis for how space fleets are built and
maintained and is this really applicable to specific cases in the Imperium?

Is the Rebellion source book where we are getting all our information about
the Corridor sector during this time or are we also using the TNS information
from Challenge and Survival Margin?

And finally are we going to make the background fit the rules or the rules
fit the background?

Yeah, in most cases the only time you want to take equipment down is to
setup a new job and/or for maintenance.  An assembly line sitting idle
isn\'t making you any money, in fact it\'s costing you money.

Sure, the straight 8 hour, 8 to 5, work day isn\'t all that common anymore.

One Traveller thought I have, is about the workday/workweek.  For a lot of
reasons, I would expect higher tech levels to have shorter workdays/weeks. 
It might be normal to work only a few hours (8, 12, 20) a week some places. 


The way work is organized will vary too.  On some worlds here might be a
lot of "job sharing", or "job teams", or "piece work" type jobs, who knows
what people might come up with.

Assuming no scale advantages OR disadvantages from going to full-up
production (say with, 12 hr/wk down time for maintenance) you could cut
delivery times by about 70%.  I\'m pretty sure that wouldn\'t quite get
*that* much advantage, but it could be close.

If this is the case then:

Ship\'s Boat in about 29 days.  

Patrol Cruiser in about 1 year 3 months.

The first one of a ship class would take considerable more time, I\'d say,
especially for testing and debugging.  The tenth ship of a class might take
a little less time.

BTW, throwing more people or money at a job won\'t always speed up the work,
read the "Mythical Man Month" by Fred Brooks, it\'ll often slow the job
down.  Of course, it\'s a curve, and if you are on the up side then
incrementally adding workers/hours/equipment/etc will boost production, but
if you\'re already at the top of the curve (or heaven forbid on the
downside) then adding resources slow the job down...and waste your
resources.

Same problem here, wouldn\'t unzip after I downloaded it.  Please, let us

The Liberty Ship was 10,000 tons, register, and steamed at 11 knots. There
were 80 shipyards churning them out by the middle of \'42 at the rate of 1
every 6 hours.  I think the record was about 1 week for an individual ship,
start to finish.

Now let\'s talk about tonnage in the real world, and in Traveller.  In
Traveller 1 displacement ton (DT) = 14 cubic meters (stere).  In the real
world (the USA anyway <g>) the volume of a ship is also measured in
tons...but a different KIND of ton.  Internal volume is measured in
register tons; 1 ton, register = 100 cubic feet.

When you do the conversions, 1 Traveller DT = 4.94 register tons..or 1 to 5
for rough work.

A 10,000 ton Liberty ship would be classified in Traveller terms as a
2,000DT ship.

The Missouri, a 40,000 ton WWII Battleship contains the internal volume in
Traveller terms of an 8,000DT ship.

An 80,000 register ton Aircraft carrier is only 16,000DT in
Traveller terms.

A 200DT Free/Far Trader is 1,000 register tons, the size of a small tramp
freighter.

An 800DT Broadsword Mercenary Cruiser would be about 4,000 tons. That\'s the
size of a large destroyer or frigate.

Here\'s an example of a submarine from the 1960\'s:  The Ethan Allen is
6,900rt (1400)DT; it has a length of 410.5ft (125m), a beam of 33ft (10m),
and a complement of 112 men.

I don\'t know if Paul is taking the different scales of measurement between
the ship\'s his yard builds and Traveller or not...but he should.

Eris

ps.  In the US a shipping ton (rail/truck *freight* is measured this way)
is 40 cubic feet.  I don\'t know if it\'s a rounding, but this just slightly
more than 1 stere (cubic meter), and slightly less than 1.5 cubic yard.

Assuming they were accelerating *continuously* at a constant rate, that
gives 1000 years of accel at less than 1/5000th of a g. with an equal
period of decel at the same rate. During which time they will have
moved 100 light years, for a total trip length of 200 light years.

At any *higher* accel, they spend less time (and distance)
accelereating to 20% of c, and more time coasting at 20% of c. Assuming
that they have *infinite* acceleration gives 0 time spent accelerating
& decelerating and 100% coasting. And that gives the 400 light year
figure.

At any *lower* acceleration, they don\'t have enough time to *reach* 20%
of c.

So given the peak velocity of 20% of c, and the trip duration of 2000
years, the trip *must* be between 200 and 400 light years (60 to 125
parsecs). That\'s the way the universe works.

So if the trip length is shorter, then either the trip time or the peak
velocity is incorrect. Another goof for GDW?

Let me know what the actual distance covered was and I\'ll work out the
limits for trip time versus peak speed.

I\'m not at all ready to equate "higher tech level" with "better".  The
Aztecs of the Valley of Mexico had universal education, public health
care, city planning, an efficient civil service, an emerging mercantile
economy, a thriving, innovative artistic community, efficient public works
(including piped-in running water and good sanitation), and a host of
other amenities we associate with modern civilization.  The Spaniards
were, by comparison, near-barbarians who happened to have precocious
skills in certain high-tech areas, like metallurgy and shipbuilding.

The Aztec empire was not "ready" to fall in any realistic sense.  It had
just undergone, by unhappy coincidence, a period of aggressive and highly
successful expansion during the 15th century; these new regions had not
yet been fully integrated into the empire, and resentment among the
conquered peoples was still strong.  Experience with earlier conquests
indicates that, given just a couple of generations, the Huaxtec and
Tlaxcalan regions would have become happy partners in the empire, rather
than being eager to ally themselves with Cortez to gain revenge against
the Aztecs (technically, the Mexica -- "Aztec" covers a much wider group,
most of whom weren\'t involved on either side of the initial Conquest).

The Aztecs were not "intimated by weirdos," at least not to the extent one
finds described in popular literature on the topic.  Rather, they were
used to a different style of warfare, one which emphasized one-on-one
melee combat, and taking of live prisoners -- rather reminiscent of the
heroic combats before the walls of Troy described in the Illiad. Their
repeated attempts to fight the Spaniards on these (rather civilized) terms
predictably led to massacres of the Aztec warriors.  By the time the
Aztecs adapted to the new realities of warfare, it was arguably too late.

It\'s quite true that the Aztecs probably found some aspects of Spanish
culture and technology more attractive than their own versions; they were
an innovative, inquisitive culture, which was in the midst of a cultural
Renaissance when Cortez arrived.  I simply don\'t think a full-scale
conquest and annexation was necessary to bring this about.

The status of Aztec "slaves" is a tricky issue.  While through crime or
gross personal mismanagement one could become a "slave" in the European
sense of the term, most so-called "slaves" were really much closer to what
we would call indentured servants, or serfs, or some combination of the
two -- making the choice between that status (in a culture with good
social welfare programs and a rather humanistic outlook) and Spanish
peasantry (in a culture in which peasants had virtually no rights or
security) rather less clear-cut than you suggest.

> In the case of religion, most Aztecs prefered to offer sacrifice than be
> offered up as sacrifice.

Again, we run into a cultural barrier here.  For the Aztec warrior caste
(and this includes both the Mexica and most of their enemies), sacrifice
was the outcome of being captured live on the battlefield -- *and this was
considered a VERY desirable fate!*  Late in the 15th century, there\'s some
evidence that the Mexica began conducting unprecedented mass sacrifices
for political terror purposes, but in the main, sacrifical victims went
willingly.  This strains credulity for most people -- but remember, our
own European cultural history venerates Christian martyrs, many of whom
were complicit in their own sacrifices.

There\'s strong historical evidence that the Aztec were on their way toward
an alphabetic (or at least syllabic) form of writing by the late 15th
century.  In any case, the Aztec scholars pounced on Latin writing with
wild glee almost immediately following the Conquest; they very clearly
recognized its superior utility.  There are Latin-character documents by
native writers in Nahuatl (the Aztec language) dating from 1528 -- just
seven years after the fall of Tenochtitlan.  Pretty impressive.

One of the big problems facing the Aztecs was that their region of
operations -- central Mexico -- is very iron- and copper-poor.  They
developed rather good gold- and silver-working technology, but never had
the means to develop practical bronze or iron implements.  For hard-edged
cutting tools, they used obsidian, which they worked with exquisite skill.
So, yes, they welcomed advanced technology -- when they had the materials
which underlie it.

The native armies which allied with Cortez were not slaves; they were the
free populations of Huaxtlan, Tlaxcala, and other regions loosely
incorporated into or outside of the Aztec Empire.

Cortez was never "emperor of Mexico;" were he given such a title, it would
have been "Viceroy" (to the King of Spain), but due to his relatively
inept political skills, he got rather seriously bypassed for the job.  In
fact, he managed his affairs so badly that, in the midst of the most
delicate state of negotiations with Motecuhzoma (before fighting broke
out), he had to run back to repel an attack on his base at Veracruz -- *by
the Spanish governor of Cuba*.  Now *that* is what I call office politics!

Hi Jeff
 I am a long time player but by no means an expert. My take is that all
the Travellers have had their strengths and weaknesses, none are perfect
but all will fit x number of players needs. Gamers being gamers tend to
pool around the version they enjoyed most. The TML being the TML, folks
are all too quick to launch the flamers. My Group plays T4 but I like MT
best, but this is a personal choice. My suggestion is try all the
versions and see all the good stuff.

Yes and No.  For the most part NO.  There are probably a couple you\'ll find
interdicted for obvious, and known reasons.  Others, they shouldn\'t know.
For example if I remember correctely there is a mothball fleet somewhere in
the Marches with stuff like an Azhanti High Lightening Cruiser (this is
from the last MegaTraveller supplement, which isn\'t handy so I\'m probably
messing this up big time, but it\'s just an example).  Something like this
would be pretty well known, at the same time it would be interdicted by the
Navy.  After all this system would be a good source of ships/parts.

Basically they would have all this information in the computer.  After all

This could be pretty cool, do it up as a broucher from Oberlides.

Hmmm, this could be something like a route sketched out on a napkin from a

Rough to do up, best left as something to tell the players at random points

Gotta keep those maps up to date.  It sounds pretty ambitious though.  You

Ancient sites!  If I remember correctly there are at least three known
sites, and at least one of these is a tourist site I think.  These would
almost definitly be marked on any detailed starchart.

        By the other way you people have been discussing about reality &

is what i think:
        1) We are playing a Sci-Fi RPG. It means a future (does not matter
if it is Space Opera or Hard fiction) that needs a internal coherence (i do
not know if i wrote the right word). If what happens in your own Traveller
universe is coherent with itself (and whith the rules, cause if you are not
coherent whit the rules you use there is a problem) there is not any problem.
        2) We are playing a Sci-Fi RPG. It means there is Science (maybe it
is not discovered, but it need to be coherent with itself) and Ficcion
(cause of that we can travel aroun the Space, wear internal powered armors,
drive a grav vehicle and so on). The Science and the Ficcion are mixed one
with each other, and the two are mixed with the plot, providing hapyness in
a Coherent world.
        Any coments?

history of the early Imperium. I agree that Cleon was not the nice guy that Imperial 
history painted, and a lot of evil deeds were done by the Imperium, especially in the 
desperate early days of empire. But ...

There is no greater evil than leaving the galaxy in a Long Night of reavers, 
starvation and despair. If ending the Long Night takes playing hardball 
politics on unsuspecting worlds and evils up to and including the nuking of 
defenseless cities, then I believe that men of honour within the Imperium would 
have knowingly done it, and rightly so.

Never the less, there are great adventure possibilities in the reaction to the 
wrongs done in the early days of the Imperium once news of exactly how the 
Imperium goes about expanding leaks out. IMO one of the Imperial successors 
(probably whats-his-name who replaced Cleon II) would have made an equivalent 
of Krushchev\'s Secret Speech, and ended the "ruthless" early phase of Imperial 
expansion, and begun the later policy of non-interference with candidate worlds, 
even if they are messy, balkanized places with no single authority with whom the 
Imperium can deal (personally, I think xenophobic locals are a minimal risk 
to the Pax Imperia ... I mean, how much of a threat to the Imperium is even 
a TL11 planet anyway ? Just declare ir a Red Zone, station enough of a naval 
force in system to keep an eye on them, and blow the hell out of their naval 
yards with a battlewagon or three if they start raiding other worlds).

The Imperium did what it did to guarantee peace between the stars, and to 
end the Reaver states. LSP may not be nice to a poor, vulnerable world, but 
the iron rule a pirate with a hold full of Second Empire nuclear missiles is 
a part of the history of too many worlds.

The bottom line is trade follows peace, and trade makes you happy and rich.

The actual T4 rulebook I\'ll pass on. I have the T4 character design

In short, I want enough detail to pick it up, read it and then

I want the Alien modules reprinted for Milleau 0 - especially the

I want the THUDD competitions printed. You could do a rip and

I want a GURPS Imperium book, not because I love GURPS as a

I want a supplement for us serious economics junkies, something
along the lines of "Commercial Shipping Analysis of the Imperium",
with Imports, Exports and shipping throughput for every world in
the Imperium, and maps of the major trade flows. I want it to
do for trading what World Builders Handbook did for rolling up

As has, I think, been noted on the list, a meson screen is
the major technical advantage a TL12 navy has when fighting
a TL11 navy. In my view, meson screens would be *more*
tightly controlled than meson guns, because the IN can
defend against meson guns.

Apart from that ... nice design work, fellas.

Best Pirate award goes to the Elisabeth class. It\'ll never
make it as a trader (MCr 1111 vs 400t cargo, and no trade
specialists), but that bay laser will let you capture lots 
of smaller ships :) 

Worst Design Decision goes to the designers of the Ming 2000,
who forgot a nuclear damper. Nukes are a TL7 invention, and
one nuke wrecks your whole day.

The Recollet is likely to sell the most in unit volumes - MCr226
for a ship with 100t of cargo, that never the less is capable
of trading a long way past the frontier. The space for eight
trade specialists (four if you carry them in as much comfort as
the better-paid crewmembers get) helps probable profitability
as well.

The 1108 class is the best of the bigger traders - high maneuver,
adequate defenses and 1000t of cargo vs 1100 megacredits cost.
Space for twenty trade specialists is provided as well, ensuring
correct decisions can be made as to what to trade to whom.

But I really cant go past the Cristobal class. A combination of
two jump 2-capable carried craft and twenty trade specialists
decided the issue. Including carried craft, it has 530 tons of
cargo capability, which is acceptable compared to it\'s total
MCr1300 cost. The Amerigo Vespucci class vessels really need to
be armed, however, and fuel bladders for a jump-2 in their cargo
bays could be a good idea (allowing a rapid evacuation of a 
hostile system). Personally, I would also replace the suggested
Santo Domingo with a third Amerigo Vespucci.

The advantage it will have is speed and flexibility. On contacting
a potential market, the mother ship can leave, with one of the sub-
craft remaining in system to keep an eye on things, and provide a
home base for up to 14 trade specialists.

As the shipyard\'s advertising makes clear, the sub-craft can help
cover three times the area that a single craft could. 

If one wants to really optimize cargo capacity, and has contacted
a world with an industrial base, the locals could be contracted to 
build a hull of the same size and shape as an Amerigo Vespucci
class. It doesnt need an engine or life support, and it doesnt 
matter if it built of composite laminates, aluminium or even welded 
steel - just so that it can be grappled to the mother ship with lots 
of interior space for cargo. The Amerigo Vespucci then makes it\'s 
own way home.

A related idea is to carry as cargo a prefabricated base. One of the
Amerigo Vespucci\'s is delegated the task of setting up the base on
some silent world in an abandoned system, thus providing a point at
which cargos can be stockpiled for later shipment back to the
Imperium. A pair of Heavily Armed Cutters could be carried as cargo 
as a self-defense force for the base.

In short, buy the Recollet if you want to be a Merchant Prince, and
buy a Cristobal Colon if you already are.

From way way way back in the wargame Imperium (the game of the
Interstellar Wars up to the Terran invention of the Jump-3 drive),
assaulting a planet from orbit has always been a desperate risk.

There are, however, several things you can do about it.

Firstly, do an adequate amount of softening up of the planet. Take
out those interceptor bases. Suppress those missile and laser
batteries. Accept that those deep meson sites are going to hurt.

Secondly, pull a couple of dummy runs ... force the defense to commit,
and then fry anything that comes out to play. How do they know that
the blips on their radar are 100% dummies or marine-carrying capsules
(I was going to say "manned", but the Imperial Marines are an Equal
Opportunity Employer).

Finally, escort those jump capsules as they come in. Fighters with
sandcasters should help survivability in the hairy last few minutes.
A few Big Craft with nuke dampers will improve the issue (especially
if the locals dont have deep meson sites).

Once the Jump Troops are on the ground, they can improve the effectivness
of orbital bombardment via more accurate targeting of fire (gotta
love those long-range Laser Communicators). This should help get the next
wave of marines onto the planet, and so on until Heavy Marines or
Regular Army can be landed.

    'body' => 'Traveller background seems to imply that the Megacorporations would
dominate long-distance trade, leaving the short-haul stuff for Free
Traders and simplar types.

I think this is not consistent with the rules of Traveller, which in 
fact give a comparitive advantage to Corporate types in short-haul
trade (and thus force free traders onto the long-haul routes).

The key is turnaround time. A corporation has a trade station on the
planet that can purchase and stockpile cargos ahead of time. Once
the corp\'s ship comes in, you can load up and go in a day, leading
to about a total trip time of 9-11 days (1 day to jump point, 6-8
days in jump, 1 day from jump point, 1 day refuelling and shifting 
cargo). Given 350 trading days a year, this gives you about 35
jumps a year (plus the traditional 2 weeks for maintainence).

Free traders need, on average, three days to find a cargo. Therefore,
their total trip time is 12-14 days - about 27 jumps a year. This
means you make a *lot* less profit on short-haul cargo than the
corporate types do.

OTOH imagine a free trader operating along a main on a long-haul
route between two planets 15 parsecs apart. It works on a cycle
of jump point-gas giant/starport-refuel-jump point-jump, at
9-11 days per jump. The "downtime" finding a cargo is still only
three days, except it is over 150 trading days rather than 10.
Thus you are a lot closer to the big boys in terms of efficiency.

Of course, you will need to be able to wear the fact that your
revenue comes in in bi-annaual lumps and you are going to need
a cargo that is profitable to haul that far (probably luxury
goods to or from a sector capital to a hi-pop world, or military
goods from a world of the highest available technology).

Anyway, I think long-haul cargo is a lot more "travellerish" than
doing a glorified postal service between two or three neighbouring
systems.

My name is Jon Fuller.  I\'ve just come back to the TML after a long
hiatus -- looks like everything\'s normal (still arguing over rules,
still coming up with the nifty ideas :).

I just decided to introduce myself, since I doubt anyone hear knows me.
I\'m a graphic designer/illustrator apprentice by trade (some of my work
appears on Goeran\'s pages, I think -- and at
http://pages.prodigy.com/fuller/ (shameless plug, I know)).  (That last
bit was directed at those looking to team with a designer/illustrator in
their THUDDD entries.)

As far as rule sets go, my only experience with MT was thru extensive
playtesting of the computer games (and while the first wasn\'t bad, the
second drove me _absolutely_ bananas).  I bought more TNE supplements
and the included awful artwork than I should have, so out of duty to my
income, I employ it as my main system (my T4.1 book is on order, as well
as FF&SII (yay!--can\'t wait to design something cool!).  

Thus, if I ask any questions at any time in the near future, they\'ll
probably be TNE related.  

Other than that, please drop by my gorgeous web site sometime and leave
a note!

Yeah, the Kaypro rocks.  It weighs enough that you\'re left strongly

suspecting it\'s radiation hardened and battlefield ready after you lug

it between your car and house a few times.  I got mine from a nearby

church that wasn\'t using it anymore, and it came with gobs of manuals,

three different forms of basic, wordstar, as well as the neato old

astrotraders game (in which you take on the role of an interstellar

megacorporation!).  Also has a built in 300 baud modem (I did most of my

early surfing on that baby...).  Nice keyboard, too (and readily
detachable, so you could fend off muggers :)

Um, I thought the driver had a lens to see thru, as well.  Not to
mention various anti-personnel aiming ports (for the coaxials atop the
turret).  You\'d have to make a heck of alot of lucky shots to destroy
the crews only means of directing their vehicle.  Best to use with a
recoilless rifle and take the entire thing apart...

BTW, I just found this *great* passage regarding powered armor (aka
Battle Dress) in one of the old \'Sten\' books by Allan Cole and Chris
Bunch (a good series, if you can find them).

begin quote

"You will _all_ learn about the fighting suit," Lanzotta said. "Chances
are, some of you will even die in one.  And you will discover, as I did,
that the suit will kill you faster than the enemy, more often than not."
"I am particularly fond of this subject," Lanzotta continued. "In fact,
I have made a personal study of the suit.  Because it was in this piece
of equipment that the technicians reached the absolute height of
absurdity."
Sten looked over the suits, and for once, he didn\'t have to fake
interest.  Many of them he recognized from the war feelies.  They were
huge, armored things shaped vaguely like humanoids.  Some had what could
pass for arms, but were track-based.
The first thing he noticed was they all seemed to be graded by size.  At
the beginning of the rack, they were small and flimsy-looking.  From
there they got larger and larger and more complex-appearing, until about
two-thirds of the way down the line.  Then they got smaller again, but
with a more durable look about them.
"The larger the antipersonnel weapon," Lanzotta continued, "the more the
Techs loaded on the armor.  Until, finally, with this suit we could take
anything.  Lasers, nukes, bugs, null bombs, you name it, we were just
about invulnerable."
Sten was starting to get the drift of what was wrong with the suit.
"About fifty years ago, I had the great pleasure of testing this suit in
action.  Myself and about two thousand comrades in arms."
Lanzotta laughed.  And it was instant tension time for the recruits. 
Should they laugh? He obviously though he had made a funny.  But
Carruthers and Halstead were stony-faced.  They didn\'t think it was
funny.  Lanzotta ended their agony by not noticing anything and going
on.
"Our orders were to put down a rebellion on a godforsaken planet called
Moros.  Besides the troops, we were supplied with everything known to
modern military science--including the latest fighting suit."
Sten studied it more closely.  It was the largest, non-tracked piece of
equipment on the rack.  There were tubes and wires, minividscreens, and
knobs and bulges everywhere.
"I love this suit," Lanzotta said.  "It can do anything."
"It\'s AM2-powered and psuedo-muscled.  Anyone inside it would be equal
to thirty beings in strength.  A small company dressed in these could
advance through any kind of fire the enemy threw at them.  It\'s
impervious to almost anything and you can live in it for months without
outside support."
Lanzotta shook his head at the wonder of it all.
"Of course, no one thought to brief the natives on Moros.  They weren\'t
told what brave and fierce warriors we were.  They didn\'t even know the
word technology, so what could they think?"
"We landed and they ran into the jungle.  We advanced under fire--mostly
spears and blowguns--and burned their villages.  They one day they grew
tired of running."
"What they discovered was this: Yes, we were big strong soldiers with
the fire power of a small tank.  But we couldn\'t manuever.  And we were
cut off from our environment.  So they worked out this simple little
trick.
"They dug pits, camoflauged them, and then fled before our advance.  Of
course, many of us fell in.  The pits were lined with nets that tangled
us up."
Lanzotta wasn\'t laughing.
"And while we were struggling out of the nets, they\'d run up to the pit
and stick a big long spear through the suits waste vent.  The spear made
large holes in the trooper inside.
"Naturally, the excrement was carried into the body.  The wound festered
so badly that the medpaks froze up--and many of us rotted to death."

I don\'t know about that. Milieu 200 should include such delights as the

The Secret Techniques of Character Creation

1. Create the character you as a GM want the player to be the night before
the game. Use a system which gives them all the skills you as a GM need to
get through the more contrived parts of the coming adventure!

2. Ask the player what they want to be. Spend ages discussing the pros and
cons of the character they have chosen... slowly steering them towards the
*character you want them to be*.

3. At a convenient point where the player thinks they have decided to be
*the character you want them to be*. Observe the clock and say \'Is that the
time.. We had better begin the game, what? your character .. What luck heres
one I prepared earlier\'

The next 500 pages describe the subtle methods used in phase 2. to sow seeds
of doubt in a players mind, many of these techniques have come from
classified brain washing manuals...<SNIP>

<SATIRE MODE OFF>

Not that us Gamemasters ever do this ;)

You\'re overlooking the fact that a) these things have interesting
features like corridors and rooms inside them.  b) they are composed of
hundreds of thousands, if not millions of square blocks (with a few
cyclopean rocks thrown in for good measure), and c) they were also
originally covered with a lovely layer of limestone.  Try doing _that_
in your backyard.  No, I\'d say that we still don\'t know HOW they were

See above.  The pyramids had rooms, secret passages, corridors and
shafts.  Some of these (we\'re reaching the extent of my knowledge) as I
remember, lined up with the rising of a particular planet or star.  This
takes some pretty advanced geometric development.

Oh, sure we could.  We have lovely gobs of TL8 earth moving technology
and all sorts of ways to get the internal architecture and construction
perfect.  But try to do it on a TL2, TL3 scale, and you begin to think
differently.  I doubt aliens had anything to do with the construction of
these monuments, but to say they were _easy_ is not an accurate
statement.  In their day, they were something awesome.  They still are. 
(Anyone seen the engravings of the hypostyle halls by Napoleon\'s
expeditionary forces?  Absolutely stunning (both the engraving AND the
architecture)).

The Vanished Library, by Luciano Canfora, has a timeline in the front
that lists the fall of Alexandria as 31 B.C.

However, I don\'t think that\'s when the burning occured.  (a side note:
there is evidence that the library building, and its 200 000 scrolls
were not burned.  Instead, _only_ the scrolls were, and the buildings
were spared.  (the scrolls were thrown into the fires at the public
baths to heat the water.  One source in the book is quoted as saying \'it
took six months to burn all [the scrolls]\'.)

Makes you queasy, when you think about it.  All that knowledge, lost. 
Carl Sagan postulates that we lost 1000 years worth of advancement in
that burning. (Cosmos, I believe).

However, there was a rival library to Alexandria at Pergamum.  So,
perhaps all was not lost at Alexandria -- just a heck of a lot.

tactics doesn\'t seem to be a skill available to Navy characters.  In the

seems that it has replaced the old ship tactics skill.  In PE tactics
skill gives a bonus on military tasks, so it does seem to be needed. 
What does the navy do - rely on marine advisors on the bridge to deal
with tactics?

    'body' => 'After seeing the discussion of Lhyd drop tanks in CT, I decided to dig
out and post this little design.  The deck plans should be on my web
page in a few days.  Comments are invited.

I designed this ship for a CT campaign set in the Spinward Marches
~1107.  It uses the then recently developed technology of drop tanks to
give it long legs for high-priority low-volume courier duty.  The
optimal use of this design is based on the CT assumption that jumps can
be made from a deep space hex, an assumption which I am well aware is
not universally accepted, but which I believe is canon(tm).  

The design takes advantage of a quirk of the CT system which, when
drives from both Book 2 and High Guard are used, gives a significant
improvement in how effectively space can be used.  That is, Book 2
maneuver drives are much smaller than in HG, while HG power plants and
J-drives are smaller than Book 2 drives.  HG says Book 2 \'standard\'
drives can be used without specifying whether or not you can mix and
match them.  In My Universe (tm), you can.  Since it only applies to 
smaller ships which can use the \'standard\' drives, it\'s not a major 
thing and helps make up for the 20 ton minimum bridge size on the 
smaller ships.  I also cheated a little bit by creating a Model 4/bis 
computer (allowing J-5) and a low volume fuel purification unit.  

WEASEL Class Covert Fast Courier
100 Ton
Classic Traveller 

This ship is a radical modification of a 100 ton type \'S\' Scout ship. 
It\'s purpose is to carry small packages quickly and securely between
relatively distant star systems with a minimum of attention.  It is able
to bypass normal routes, taking weeks or even months off of normal
message delivery times.  It may be used for one-way messages, taking a
slower round-about return course if the required drop tanks are not
available at the destination, or as a two-way link between stations
supplied with the necessary tanks.  Little is spared by way of cost in
this design.  Indeed, the only reason it is based on the Type \'S\' is the
low profile which this common vessel projects.  The high price
associated with the high tech components makes this a rather uncommon
design.

A standard Type \'S\' scout is obtained and gutted.  The original bridge,
computer, air raft, and instrumentation space are retained.  The
engineering space is the same, although it\'s contents are completely
changed. Most of the remainder of the ship has been redesigned.

The existing drives are replaced with custom jump drive and power plant
(High Guard) and standard maneuver drive B (Book 2).  The jump drive is
outfitted with long storage capacitors which permit use of Lhyd drop
tanks for extended range operations.  A non-standard fuel purification
unit is added (taking up 2 tons previously used for fuel space) to
ensure high quality fuel to charge the special capacitors which are
necessary for use with drop tanks.  The ship is capable of Jump-5 and
4-G acceleration, although there is only sufficient internal fuel
capacity for a Jump-3.  See below for more information.

The hull is substantially reinforced and armored to factor 6 to
withstand the increased acceleration and provide protection for
sensitive cargo (as well as the crew).  This results in a loss of 7 more
tons of the original fuel storage. 

The original bridge and Model 1/bis computer are retained, and a
specially designed Model 4/bis computer is installed in the
instrumentation bay.  The Model 1/bis is typically reprogrammed as a
data bank for information transfer.

Interior accommodations have been significantly reduced.  Directly aft
of the bridge are three small staterooms to port. Each has a normal bed
with storage below.  A dropdown bunk above each bed allows double
occupancy if necessary.  There is a common area to starboard which
includes a compact but well-outfitted galley and entertainment system. 
Despite the small size of the living area, (normally considered adequate
for 1.5 full-size staterooms), there is sufficient life support
installed to support 6 persons if full health and comfort.  It is
expected that the crew will have adequate periods of shore leave between
missions.  It should be noted that a one-way mission could easily result
in weeks in deep space.  A standard low berth is installed and may be
used for prisoner transfer, among other things.  An emergency low berth
is also provided.

The original fuel storage has been reduced to 25.83 tons, of which 5.33
tons are allotted to the power plant. About two-thirds of the original
crew space has been converted to fuel storage and cargo space.  A cargo
door on the underside of the vessel allows access to the cargo hold. 
This space holds a custom-fit collapsible fuel tank with a capacity of
9.5 tons, making a total of 30 tons available for jump.  When collapsed,
it leaves 7 tons of space for cargo.  Access to this space is normally
by the original hatch to the rear, although a concealed panel allows
access from the crew\'s living area. 

The standard 3 ton cargo bay has been divided into a 1-ton secure
compartment with armored bulkheads and door and a 2 ton normal
compartment.  This makes for a maximum of 10 tons of cargo if the
collapsible tank is not used, or 12.5 tons if it is not carried. 

Armament is at the option of the owner.  An empty triple turret with
fire control is provided and 3 EP\'s are available for weapons.  A mix of
beam weapons and sandcasters is commonly used for optimal defense.

DROP TANKS

Two auxiliary jump fuel tanks have been designed for use with the Weasel
class, a 33.3 ton drop tank which can be carried with the ship or
dropped, and a 50 ton booster tank which can be used only once and
cannot be carried into jump.  

The 33.3 ton  drop tank costs 43.3 kCr and increases the total ship\'s
tonnage to 133.3 tons.  The installed drives allow for 3 G maneuver and
J-4 in this configuration.  Note that J-4 requires 20 tons of fuel from
internal storage in addition to the drop tank capacity.  This allows J-4
without use of the collapsible tank.  If the tanks are dropped after
charging the capacitors, a J-5 can be performed using 16.7 tons of fuel
from internal storage.

The 50 ton booster tank costs 60.0 kCr and can be used with or without
the 33.3 ton tank, increasing  the ship\'s total tonnage to 150 or 183.3
tons.  Due to the awkward geometry of these configurations, the ship
cannot exceed 2 G acceleration while carrying the booster tank.  It also
cannot jump while carrying the booster tank.  Upon emptying and
releasing the booster tank, the Weasel can perform a J-4 with the 33.3
ton drop tank (133.3 tons) or a J-5 without (100 tons).

A variety of sequences of jumps can be performed, depending on which
auxiliary tank(s) is(are) used.  The following list gives the possible
jump sequences for various tank combinations.  B = 50 ton booster tank,
D = 33.3 ton drop tank, and C = 9.5 ton collapsible tank.  DROP
indicates the drop tank is discarded, while NODROP indicates it is
retained.  The total distance traveled in parsecs (psc), time in jump
in weeks (wk), jump fuel remaining, and cargo space available are listed
after the jump sequence.  Note that for multi-jump sequences,
conservation of power plant fuel (adequate for 4 weeks normal operation)
may be in order.  Cargo space when not using the collapsible tank
assumes it is carried collapsed.  If not carried, add 2.5 tons.

  *Non-commercial level accommodations.  
  Cargo and fuel assume collapsible tank used. If collapsed, use ()
values.

  Statistics with the booster tank are not listed, as this is a
temporary configuration.  The main parameters with booster tank are J-0,
M-2, Agil=2 with or without drop tank.

NOTES:
XQ (Express Decoy in HG) was the best type designation I could come up
with.  Alternative suggestions welcomed.
  
The listed prices are for built from scratch.  Although built from a
Type S, I assume that no significant savings are realized, mostly due to
the difficulty of retrofitting the hull with armor. The HG (100 ton
wedge) hull price is used.  The standard B2 hull would subtract 12MCr
from the cost.

The weapons mix is selected to optimize defense; this ship is designed
to run, not fight.  Other options are available, however, including up
to three lasers or one energy weapon and a laser, missile rack, or
sandcaster.  The fusion gun/sandcaster option is fairly popular, giving
a good close-in punch against missles or approaching vessels.  Three
EP\'s are available, but this does affect agility.

The crew accommodations reflect my belief (based on experience in the US
Submarine Force) that the standard accommodations in Traveller are
generous, and that personnel can be found to crew a vessel with much
more limited space.  I use full price for three staterooms to reflect
the cost of life support and better quality to make up for loss of
space.

I \'created\' a Model 4 bis computer (as well as a 3 bis) by extrapolating
from the normal models:
  Model  MCr    Tons    Cap   TL  EP  UPP
   1       2      1     2/5    5   0   1

   3      18      3     5/9    9   1   3
  *3 bis  25      3     9/0    A   1   T

  *4 bis  38      4    15/0    B   2   U
   5      45      5    12/25   B   3   5
     etc . . .
  *extrapolated non-standard models

The HG rules state that fuel purification plants can be no smaller than
one-fifth the size, price, and capacity of the listed values.  At TL F,
this would be 3 tons, 200 ton capacity, and 30 kcr. I stretched this a
bit by creating a smaller but less efficient and more expensive model at
2 tons, 100 ton capacity, and 50 kcr.  Every ton counts in this ship.

The armored cargo space is surrounded with hull armor at factor 13. 
This is calculated at 1.16 tons armored to factor 13, which requires
0.16 tons armor and leaves 1 ton for cargo.  An additional 250 kCr is
invested in a security system.

I don\'t remember where I found the rules for collapsible fuel tanks.  I
know I read them somewhere, along with those for temporary \'bladder\'
type tanks.  Probably an old JTAS.  If anyone happens to know, I\'d
appreciate the info.
