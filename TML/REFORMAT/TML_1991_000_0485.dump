A historical note concerning the Ultima bike: only two models were
ever built, one a partially-functional prototype that was used for
trade show displays and the other a fully operational design. Rumors
of a third bike having been made were denied for several years, until
investigative journalists discovered the truth: there were actually
TWO other examples of the line built, and the prototype had originally
been scheduled for eventual complete functionality. The concept had been
to give the corporation a fully functional gravbike precision-flying team
similar to the Imperial Flying Sabres of Capital or the Winged Unicorns
of Regina, but using gravbikes rather than fighters as a novel twist.
The plan had been scrapped when one of the two unaccounted-for bikes
came apart at just over Mach Two in a test flight, and the other bike
was stolen in a Corsair raid on the world where it was stored. The 
whereabouts of this third bike are unknown, and the corporation still
denies its existence.

	Mark Gellis then proceedes to talk about Space Habitats as 
constructable in the near future. Wait a minute. This is Traveller.
If you\'re going to talk reality then the economic argument I initailly
proposed counts double. The good news is that in Traveller my assumptions
were not wholly correct.
	Over the holiday for my own satisfaction I decided to work out just
how much it would cost to build a space habitat (or space station) and thus
prove the cost prohibitive to normal inhabitants.
	I took the largest hull size, assumed TL15 and made it an open frame.
No gravity but I left it with 1% G maneuver drives (attitude thrusters). I
just had accomidation with not industry or storage space. The result was a 
pleasingly expensive 116 billion credits. However it housed 470,000 people
which made the cost per person (2 per stateroom) at just under 250,000Cr.
With a 40 year morgage it ammounts to just over 1000Cr per month. At my
normal exchange rate (10Cr = 1 IRL) that\'s less than my flat costs! Even at
1Cr = $1 it isn\'t *prohibitively* expensive. At the standard traveller rates
of 500Cr per skill level per week it is easily affordable to skill rank
2 (or even 1 if pushing it).
	It is interesting to note that 200,000 of the 250,000 is just for
the stateroom (according to my uncorrected rules). Of course a better model
would include gravity and space for something to employ the people. It
would be interesting to seem a design my someone more interested in the ship
design rules. I am seeing what a TL9 space station (20 Subsidised merchant
berths, 20 far trader/seeker berths, 4 large (1000t) berths, warehousing
for the equivalent cargo, fuel storage for the equivalent, and staterooms
for the equivalent) looks like/costs.

	Reality Check.
	I\'ll quite hapily discuss the imposiblity of Space Habitats in the
*real world* with anyone but over private e-mail. Traveller defines its
own reality which rarely touches on our own.

    'body' => 'Even though the holidays are over, there doesn\'t seem to be  much 
traffic on the list.  I thought I might as well take this  oppor-
tunity  to bring up a few things that have been on my  mind,  and 
see if we can get a little activity going again.

Item  1:  MESON COMMUNICATORS  I have been asked why I never  put 
these things on nay of my starship designs.  Well, there are  two 
reasons.  They serve no purpose, and they\'re expensive.  Serve no 
purpose, you say?  Exactly.  The only advantage of a meson commu-
nicator  versus any of the other tight beam comm systems is  that 
it can transmit through solid objects.  However, assuming that it 
works  more or less like a meson gun, you need to know the  exact 
range before using it.  Thus, unless you can already see and talk 
to the other ship, you can\'t use your meson communicator.  I also 
have a feeling that I wouldn\'t want to be aboard a ship receiving 
a slightly misaligned meson communication--even though the 20  or 
30  megawatts of a communication beam aren\'t anything next  to  a 
spinal  mount\'s  output, I\'d hate to be on the bridge  when  that 
message decays ten feet from the meson receiver.

Item 2: IMPERIAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS  A fair amount of powder has 
been burned in the past few months on the nitty gritty details of 
weapons.   I\'ve  always  worked under the  assumption  that  some 
Imperial  standards organization exists, and that if you carry  a 
standard   weapon,  you  shouldn\'t  have  much  trouble   getting 
bullets/power packs for it.  This is basically the same situation 
that exists for starships, where you can get your drive  repaired 
anywhere.   Even though there may be multiple  standards  (Oh...I 
see  you  have a Procyon.  That\'s an ImpStd-D isn\'t  it?)  it  is 
still easy enough to get parts.  

Item 3: SPACE COMBAT WITH UNDERARMORED VESSELS  My first  sugges-
tion for a quick approximation of what to do with an underarmored 
(less  than 40) space craft would be to apply a +1 to the  damage 
die  roll for each three armor classes under 40.  (Mirror  of  -1 
for each three over 40).

Item  4: GREAT ADVENTURE IDEAS What are some of the  best  adven-
tures  people have run/played in?  For all the years  I\'ve  owned 
this game, I\'ve not played it much, and I wonder what people have 
done that they thought worked well.

Item  5: A MILITARY CAMPAIGN PBEM  Since I never actually  get  a 
chance  to  run  anything, I am considering  the  possibility  of 
running  a military oriented game over the net.  Realistically  I 
couldn\'t  accept more than about five players.  The basic  situa-
tion  would  be this:  A small mercenary unit  with  a  financial 
problem has been approached by the government in exile of a small 
country which was overrun by a larger neighbor.  They would  like 
to liberate their homeland, but have very few resources.  The pay 
would be better than the training duties the company is currently 
surviving on.  Emphasis on military ingenuity/irregular  warfare, 
and  an  exploration  of how grav vehicles  would  really  affect 
combat.  If it works, and I can keep it up, there would be poten-
tial  for expansion or starting a new game on a different  topic.  
Set in the Spinward Marches...

Item 6 REVISIONS OF VEHICLE DESIGNS  I\'ve been sorting the  vehi-
cle designs and correcting typographical erros where I could find 
them.   If anyone is interested, I\'ll be sending them to the  ftp 
site (if it has been repaired.)

Item 7 TDR VEHICLE SYSTEM  Has anyone looked at my draft  vehicle 
system version 1.1?

Respond to any or all.  Let\'s get this list moving again.

     Um, I don\'t think so.  I always thought that the meson communicator
receiver worked more or less on the same principle as the meson screen.
As I understand it, a working meson screen makes an incoming meson
beam decay "early," on contant with the screen.  If this is how the
receiver works, then you don\'t need to know the range.  If you use a
diffuse beam, you don\'t even have to be all that accurate with your aim,
either.  You just have to get a small fraction of the beam to the
receiver so that the early decay of the mesons can be detected (we have
detectors that can handle small numbers of particles *now*--who knows
what a TL15 culture might manage?).  If you use some form of, say,
pulse modulation that is designed to be easily distinguishable from
random noise (assuming that there\'s all that much of a chance of running
into "wild" mesons), then the resultant energy density needed at the
receiver end is safely low.  This is assuming that the receiver is at
the extreme range of the transmitter, which increases the chances of
the beam reaching the end of its lifespan in the same general area.  If
you\'re closer to the transmitter than that, I would think that it would
be perfectly safe, since I can\'t think of any good reason to ever set
the beam duration for anything less than maximum.

A quick qualification.  I do not recall stating that habitats could be
built in the near future, and I suspect it was bad phrasing on my part
that suggested it.  I would not be surprised if we see early permanant
space habitats around 2100 A.D.; I would be surprised to see them before
that.  Space habitats worth living in require certain technologies that
we simply do not have or have not sufficiently developed.  Of these,
I think one of the most important would be self-replicating robots to
handle the enormous labor and manufacturing costs--building something
the size of a Nimitz class carrier in orbit is far beyond what we can
afford to do at this point, whether or not we could solve the many
technological problems.  

On the other hand, I find it hard to imagine a future where mankind
has survived that does not eventually involve a space industrialized
civilization.  It is not that people will emigrate to space in large
quantities, but if only 1% of the population leaves (comparable to
other emigrations in human history), that means you have an initial
population of several million humans (with several billion robots
working for them--self-replicators will breed as often as we want
if we give them sunlight for power and raw materials to process).  
This population will gradually find living in space "normal," and
when their populations pressures start, they will simply build more
habitats.  As I said before, an Earth-like planet might be able to
support 20 billion people, perhaps comfortably if we distributed
resources properly, but the asteroid belt has enough raw materials
to make habitats for half-a-trillion people, even assuming you need
one million tons of raw materials per person to make these habitats
and supply other basic needs (I assume very roomy habitats...after
all, if you\'re going to live in space, don\'t live in a metal shack,
build a small world to order, if you can afford it--advanced
technology will make it economical.  Not during our lifetimes,
but I cannot imagine technology not advancing to the point where
it will be practical and cost-effective.  And it is also true 
that the first space habitats will be primitive and cramped, but
probably no worse than what urban dwellers endure right now--
New York City has a population density of more than 20,000 per
square mile--but as the space-based population grows larger and
richer, their habitats will become more luxurious.)

As I said before, it is not that space habitats are going to be
available very soon, or that everyone is going to suddenly rush
to leave Earth, but some people will--you always get a few with a
frontier mentality--and their children will probably stay in 
space (children do leave small towns for the big cities, but 
most children of colonists do not leave their new native country
for the "old country" of their parents); they will be the population
that eventually expands, growing huge because the natural resources
in space are much greater than those on any planet.  

Assuming we do not destroy ourselves or turn away from space entirely,
I cannot see how this could not happen.  Eventually, the technology
to support people in space will be available; a few will go, either
to get rich, or to get away from a society they dislike, or for some
other reason, and they will get things started.  Sure it sounds
crazy.  It was crazy to leave England in 1620 for America.  It was
really crazy to set out on the Pacific in an open boat, hoping you
would find a new island to live on.  People did it.  (For a good
discussion of these issues, by the way, I strongly recommend a 
collection of articles entitled INTERSTELLAR MIGRATION AND THE
HUMAN EXPERIENCE.)

Enjoy.  And remember, by the time you finish reading this sentence,
it will be the future.

In case you all haven\'t, i suggest everyone going and looking at a copy of
JTAS 23.  Among other articles (it also had John Ford\'s classic "Road Show",
which by itself is worth the trouble finding the magazine...) it has 
Chris Struble\'s \'Space Habitats In Traveller" article.  Excellent work. I can
if need be type it all in (though it would take a while); i\'ll summarize below.

Between TL8 and TL14 many societies build rotating habitats.  At TL15, it also
becomes possible to make Gravitic habitats (where centripetal force is replaced
by massive grav plates for \'gravity\' on the habitat), but this is extremely
expensive and an uncommon solution.  The majority of habitats are rotating
ones, spherical or cylindrical.

	Habitats are built by the million tons of material used (these are not
the flimsy little structures that spacecraft are, by any means 8-).  Costs 
and weights depend on a number of factors (atmosphere, Gs, etc.).  
	One example given is a 7km radius spherical colony built at TL9, which 
is large enough to house 2 million people, or produce food for about 11 million,
with some balance in between likely.  It would cost MCr 120,000 to build; this
works out to only 60,000 Cr/inhabitant.  Spread over only 40 years, this is only
Cr250/month... much less than any well-paying professional will earn.  And it
will last a lot longer than 40 years.  Seen in this light, it\'s obvious that
it\'s well worth it to build larger habitats, even at lower tech levels.  
While the massive capital required to start one requires near-certain government
subsidy, the long term economics are quite favorable.

  Eh, 1.1? I\'ve seen a version 1.0 that was dated 29 Nov 90, but no 1.1.  I used
part of 1.0 for the play during the holidays.
  The "Damagepoints from weight" thing is nice. Heavily armoured SDB\'s will
get far larger capability to absorb damage than flimsy civilian transports.
(I assume that "weight" in the damage point formulas is unloaded weight. It is
 given as clean weight in the COACC part but just "weight" in the vehicle/
 craft/ship part.)
 
  Regarding Agility.. (The entire TML screams and runs for cover, but don\'t 
worry, I\'m not seeking to restart the old "What Is Agility? Where does it live
and what does it charge by the hour?" argument.)
 
  I don\'t really understand how one should compute agility. In the general
section you say "Agility is equal to the acceleration available after all other
systems have been powered." and in the COACC part "Agility formula for aircraft
(and grav vheicles) is forthcoming." 

  The first sentence seems to be like good old Striker, where grav-vehicles
could be powered by a fraction of the effect that was listed and get a fraction
of the listed thrust. In Striker (in the three design examples at least) the
vehicles wouldn\'t have enough powerplant to go at top speed while they were
operating their weapons. Is it this "reduced acceleration while everything is
powered" speed that you mean?

  I also have to put my vote for the fusion rocket. I think that there is
something grand about a large spaceship at 6 gee with a long glowing flame of 
heated (hydrogene? water? ammonia?) trailing after it.
  But it might just be a severe case of space opera that has hit me:)

  Somehow, I usually manage to make intro adventures that are stronger than the
campaigns that follows. This is true for all types of RPG\'s I\'ve been involved
in. It probably has something to do with the time I spend on it. In any 
case, I\'ll only talk about my views on introductiory adventures.
  
  I like adventures to be fairly complex with several bottoms. The ones that
the players have liked the best were those that could accomodate several
different styles of play (Adventures that could be approached and from either a
discovery/exploration, scientific, economic or gung-ho angle and solved from any
angle.)
  Those kinds of adventures are especially successfull as first adventures
when you arn\'t really sure which style of play that that group will take.
(They took the discovery/exploration/gung-ho angle with a minor in economics:)

  Traveller has the famous concepts of the push, the pull, the enigma and the
gimmic (I\'m almost afraid to admit it, but 3 of the reasons in "the push: the 
5 top reasons why everyone in the galaxy hates you" (a cartoon in challenge 
some issues back) fit in on the pc-s in my current campaign, and they don\'t 
cheat at dice:)
  I\'d like to extend those concepts to the pushES, the pullS, the engimaS and
the gimmicS. If you onlt have one push and one pull working during an adventure,
it will tend to follow the path of a charged particle, away from the source of
the push to the location of the pull. Solving enigmas on the way and collecting
the gimmic in the end (usually).
  (Knightfall could be taken as a good example of this kind of "charged particle
campaign", but it has several sequential strong pulls in effect.)

  A better model would in my opinion be to have several pushes and several
pulls in effect from different locations at the same time. Different players
(and different NPC\'s) would interpret the situation in different ways and
support different actions. Suddenly the linear adventure has got several more
dimensions. The course it will take is not longer predictable and, at least
those of this type that I have run, have been more enjoyed, by myself and the
players.
 
  As a summary, the following structure has worked for us:
PC-s get apparently simple assignment from a patron (Always have a reason why
*They* of all people gets the assignment, I thought the "late at night at 
the starport, desperate lawyer looks for anyone with a scoutship" ploy worked).
  After they have started on the assignment (and the patron gone somewhere else
so that they can\'t go back and gripe about it and demand additional information)
{strange things start to happen/strange facts are discovered} that hints that
the whole thing might be more complex than anticipated.
  They discover the first part of the puzzle, which in this case were where to
travel to, but when they there the mystery thickens and several more pushes
(the first was a deadline) and pulls (the first one was a reward) materialize.
  After some stalling in which they pick up pieces of the puzzle they begin to
see a pattern and soon the end is in sight.
  Then another bottom with more pushes and pulls reveals itself and the middle
part of the adventure is resolved in a dramatic climax.
  Then comes the end of the adventure with no great surprises, up till the very
end when there is another, final, dramatic point.

  I\'m not claiming that this is The Formula For Epic Adventures, but it worked
for us.

  Greg Bear: EON

  Especially the scene where the russian marines disembark from their orbital
transfer vehicles and assaults the asteroid. It might be alittle lowtech for
traveller (more like 2300 actually) but certainly possible with the additions 
of the "One small step" articles.

  There is also a lot of ideas for anyone that plans to do anything involving
the Ancients. The Pi-meter actually found it\'s way into my campaign as an
artifact when the pc-s were hunting for the elusive towers of Sharrip.


  Stanislaw Lem (sp?): SOLARIS

  If you look inside the outer shell, there is a hard-sf story inside that
might well take place in the Traveller universe.
  I can imagine the IISS touching down on Solaris to survey it and try to
establish contact. The NAS would go nuts:)

  The stories involving merchants (Van Rijn?) is very travelleresque.

>                Niven and Pournelle: THE MOTE IN GOD\'S EYE

  IMHO, Traveller is very influenced by Niven. The ships in the old boardgame 
"Imperium" about the n Interstellar Wars travel using something that seems like
the Langston drive from Mote and Codominium.
  (They jump along certain lines between stars)

  There is also a article on jumpdrives in an old JTAS (Don\'t remember the 
number, but I think the article was by Marc Miller himself) that states that
ships will exit from jump only at certain locations in a system. Which locations
was determined by the composition of the system. This might also be shades of
the Langston drive.

  Then there is the Langston field...

  The Aslan and Hiver also seems to have been initially inspired by Kzinti and
Puppeteers. Not that they are copies of them, no way, but there is some 
similarities (as well as great differences). If they have gone through the 
same process of change as the official view of the Zhodanis, I imagine that
the similarities might have been greater when they were first introduced.

  (On the other hand, a old Traveller-player here on Chalmers is dead sure that
Zhodani, Aslan and Vargr are thinly disguised versions of Russians, Samurai-
era Japanese and Mexicans as they are viewed in American folklore. Don\'t ask
me, he\'s the resident expert on Japan too, and when he recounted the 
similarities it sounded at least possible)

                               GOTHCON XV 

                   29th of March to 31th of March 1991

			       GOTHENBURG

			         SWEDEN


      Somehow, I got inside the dangerspace the GOTHCON press-gang so now I 
   toil with organizing the official tournaments...

      What is GOTHCON? A Con, of course, more specific the Gothenburg Con, now 
   on it\'s 15th year and world famous in the whole of Sweden (and some parts of
   Norway).

      Why tell this to the TML? Well, one of the official tournaments is a
   TRAVELLER tournament (Not MegaTraveller, since it is is written by two 
   persons who were there during the good old days). From the papers that are
   being sent out now (but somewhat translated:) :

   TRAVELLER

   Organizers: Bo"rjesson & Halle\'n of Bifrost (The Chalmers RPG and Boardgames
						organization.
   Type: RPG for teams ( 5 persons )
   Time: Friday 1500-1945
   Admission charge: 100SEK (about $16, in addition to the charge of the con.)
   Knowledge Required: None
 
   "5000 years into the future, in a world where mankind just is a race out on
   the perimeter, and where the Imperium rule thousands of planets, there is,
   on the outskirts of the Imperium a planet not wholely unlike Earth.
   On it\'s northen hemisphere there is a idyllic valley with about a dozen
   farms.
   One of the farms is redder than the other and has whiter corners. The 
   Xenokatas family live there.
   Little do they know..."


      Apart from TRAVELLER, the organized tournaments include ASL, Britannica,
   Call of Cthulhu, CarWars, Civilization, Diplomacy, Illuminati, Junta, 
   AD&D2ed, AD&D2ed II, Kremlin, Paranoia, MERP, RQIII and WH40K.
      Independent tournaments include Micro, Fire In The East, Corporation Wars,
   Shotgun Mission, Ruinworld, Bloodbowl and a RPGA AD&D2ed tournament.

   
      I will be on the premises viritually around the clock from Friday to
   Saturday, answering questions, giving directions, and using a blowtorch to
   convince organizers of individual torunaments that the adventures should be 
   ready more than 5 minutes before play is about to begin:) (Bo"rjesson and
   Halle\'n have a long history of finishing before the deadline runs out so no
   shadow should fall on them.)

      Swedish cons are somewhat different from the US/UK type. It has been told
   to me that our cons are more similar to small US/UK ones, in that there
   is a small number of participants (around 500 for Gothcon) that play *alot*
   and socialize somewhat less during the con.
      (Don\'t ask me. I\'ve never been to any US/UK con. My knowledge of US/UK 
   cons in general come from pure hearsay and "Bimbos of the Death Sun" :)

      One additional difference from US/UK cons is ofcourse that most people on
   GOTHCON speak Swedish, but most Swedes speak English, especially those who
   are involved in RPG and Boardgaming.

      Anyway, if any TMLers know that you\'ll be in Gothenburg during that time,
   call me. I might even be able to smuggle you in past the ticket booth as
   "Internationally famous TRAVELLER experts from the US" :)

===============================================================================
Well, here it is, at last.  The breakdown of the 53 responses (out of
approximately 260 readers) to the TML Survey.  If the subject line text
sounds sexist, wait until after you\'ve read the results of question
number 5 before you pass judgement.

GENERAL BACKGROUND:
1. Name:

    The following 53 people responded to the TML survey:

    Adrian Hurt             Gary Schreiber          Matthew Harelick
    Andrew M. Salamon       Iain Fogg               Metlay

    Derek MacColl           Mark F. Cook            Wilson Mac Liaw
    Eric Halil              Mark Leymaster          Yngve Larsson
    Eric M. Sergienko       Martin V Howard         

    BTW, the winner for the random drawing was Karl-Koenig Koenigsson.

2. Address:

    We got 21 from the Eastern US, 17 from the Western US (using the
    Mississippi River as an arbitrary dividing line), and 15 from
    outside the US.  Here\'s the breakdown:

    EASTERN UNITED STATES:
    5 - Massachusetts (Asland, Bedford, Boston, Cambridge, Groton)
    4 - Maryland (Beltsville, Chevy Chase, Churchville, Edgewood)
    3 - New Jersey (Fair Haven, Neptune, Newark)
    2 - Pennsylvainia (Philadelphia, Pittsburgh)
    1 each from Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, Ohio,
                Kentucky, and Indiana.

    WESTERN UNITED STATES:
    8 - California (Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, Culver City,
                    Mountain View, Portola Valley, Sunnyvale, Berkeley)
    4 - Oregon (Hillsboro, Portland, Corvallis, Eugene)
    2 - Idaho (both from Boise)
    1 each from Utah, Colorado, and North Dakota.

    INTERNATIONAL:
    4 - Sweden (2 from Linkoping)
    3 - Australia (all from Brisbane)
    3 - England
    2 - Scotland (both from Edinburgh)
    2 - Canada
    1 - Ireland.

3. Phone:

    Two people explicitly indicated that they didn\'t have one, and one
    other person left out the info.  Of the remaining 50 responses, 43
    listed a single number (whether home or work was usually not specified)
    and the remaining 7 listed both work and home numbers.

4. Age:

    I got one ambiguous reply (which I discarded).  Based on the
    remaining 52 values, here\'s the spread:

      Minimum age: 19 years
      Maximum age: 45 years
      Average age: 26.7 years

5. Sex:

    53 responses, all Male.  The "Subject" line says it all.  Either
    we don\'t have many female readers on the TML, or they\'re not
    talking to us.

6. Occupation:

    This wasn\'t much of a surprise either.  Of the 53 responses, 27 were
    from people with computer-related jobs (SW engineer, programmer, etc.),
    5 of whom are Managers.  22 of the responses were from students, 13 of
    whom are in Comp. Sci. or Comp. Eng. fields, 7 in other fields, and 2
    who weren\'t specific enough to be determined.  The remaining 4 responses
    were from people in other professions (Attorney, Chemical Engineer,
    Mechanical Engineer, Data Entry).

7. Employer:

    30 Academic institutions appear as either employers or current residence
    (U. of Queensland appears three times, MIT twice, all others are unique
    entries).  Of the remaining 23 employers, there are only 2 which appear
    multiple times: Hewlett-Packard Co. appears three times, and the United
    States Army appears twice.

8. Marital Status:

    Pretty cut-n-dried: 33 unmarried, 19 married, 1 ambiguous.  (He checked
    both yes AND no; go figure.)

COMPUTER SYSTEMS:

9. How did you find out about the TML?

    It looks like rec.games.frp is the TML\'s biggest source of new readers.
    The breakdown is:
      [ 7] From a friend
      [13] From a list of computer mailing lists
      [28] From an "advertisement" on rec.games.frp
      [ 5] Other: GEnie\'s MegaTraveller BBS
                  Cousin
                  I started it.  [Cute, Jim.  Real cute. :-)]
                  "ad" on GMAST-L (equivalent to r.g.frp)
                  Can\'t remember

10. On what type of computer/system do you access the TML?

    About two-thirds of the respondents are getting the TML via a technical
    workstation running some flavor of UN*X.  For those interested, the
    types of systems that got significant mention are: 12 Sun workstations,
    8 VAXs, 3 HP workstations, 2 Apollo workstations, 3 Macintoshes, 2 Amigas, 
    2 Sequents, 2 Solbournes, and a scattering of IBM PC clones and mainframes,
    along with 4 people who apparently didn\'t know what they were using.  Oddly
    enough, a few of the people who turned in surveys think UN*X itself is
    a type of computer!  That seems only fair, considering the fact that
    several of the TML members aren\'t really in the "computer business".
    After all, ask any non-chemist about the details of a Krebb\'s Cycle
    and watch the blank looks appear.

11. How many hours per month do you spend reading TML?

     5 - less than 2 hours
    13 - 2-4 hours
    17 - 5-8 hours
    12 - 9-16 hours
     3 - 17-24 hours
     3 - Over 24 hours

12. Do you know how to access the TML archives?

    36 - Yes
    17 - No
    NOTE: Many of the "Yes" answers indicated that they knew how but
    lacked the actual capability for anonymous FTP.  The E-mail archive
    server appears to be unreliable enough that most people avoid it.

13. What other other national BBSs/networks do you use?

    Since rec.games.frp is the big recruiter for TML readers, these
    results were to be expected:

    39 - UseNet
    11 - BitNet
     6 - GEnie
     6 - None - I don\'t use any other BBS 
     4 - FidoNet
     3 - CompuServe
     2 - CSnet

     4 - Other: Internet
     2 - Other: FreeNet
     1 - Other: Applelinke
     1 - Other: Local BBS ("The Pyre")

14. How many hours per month do you spend reading other BBSs/networks?
    
    [ 8] less than 2 hours
    [10] 5-8 hours
    [ 8] 9-16 hours
    [10] 17-24 hours
    [17] Over 24 hours

    Given the heavy clumping at the high end, it would appear that the
    average TML reader is (as one survey respondent put it) a serious
    "data junkie".

15. Do you regularly use other computers/systems?

    45 - Yes
     8 - No

16. If \'Yes\' on the previous question, what other types?

    Broad selection of responses here.  The run-away winners in this
    catagory were Apple Macintoshes, IBM PCs (and clones), Sun workstations,
    and DEC VAXs.  Honorable mention should go to the Atari ST, along with
    SGI, NeXT and HP workstations.  After that it was all over the board.
    All other responses were either the only mention for a given system,
    or were too ambiguous to be catagorized.

17. What computer languages do you regularly use?

    C and Pascal were the most frequently named languages, however
    anything that got mentioned more than once is listed below.  Two
    survey respondents indicated that they didn\'t regularly use any
    programming language (not surprising) and, of the other singular
    languages mentioned, one person indicated that he used Snobol,
    which caused me several long minutes of reminiscing.

      41 - C (ANSII Std. and K&R)
      20 - Pascal                
      12 - FORTRAN
      11 - UN*X shell scripts (Bourne, C, and Korne)
       9 - C++
       9 - BASIC (various flavors)
       4 - Lisp (various flavors)
       4 - Assembler (assorted processors)
       3 - Modula
       3 - HyperCard/HyperTalk
       3 - AWK
       2 - Postscript
       2 - Perl

18. How many years of computer/programming experience do you have?

    Not everyone responded with a specific number, but enough did to
    make to following ballpark determination:

      Minimum: < 1 year
      Maximum:  25 years
      Average:   9.5 years (much higher than I expected!)

    One respondent also included this rather wry observation:

        "That is a bad metric, Some may have used BASIC
         for 20 years and that is little or no experence at all."

19. How did you acquire your computer/programming experience?
 
    14 people indicated that their experience was derived solely from
    formal training.  7 indicated that they were entirely self-taught.
    31 indicated that they fell into both catagories.

20. Do you have free access to the TML?

  Out of 53 respondents, only 1 indicated that he did not have free access.

21. If \'Yes\' to question 20, how?

    24 - Via college/university
    22 - Via employer
     6 - Via employer AND college/university (either because of access
                to both, or because the employer IS a college or univiersity.)

22. If \'No\' to question 20, by what pay service do you receive the TML?

    The 1 survey respondent that gets TML via pay service indicated that
    he had a flat-fee-per-year account on a public-access UN*X system.

23. Which of the following computer graphics formats are available to you?

    Here are all the formats that got 10 or more votes each (along with
    the number of votes each got).

    [36] PostScript "image"     [16] EPS
    [34] GIF                    [14] XBM
    [28] MacPaint               [12] PC Paintbrush
    [20] PICT                   [11] raw grayscale
    [18] Sun raster             [11] XWD
    [16] TIFF                   [10] Usenix FaceSaver
    [16] Sun icon               [10] IFF ILBM

    If we start using standard interchange formats for TML, it looks like
    we\'ll be using PostScript "image", GIF, and MacPaint.

24. Of these formats, which do you prefer?

    The votes for those top 3 formats were:

        16 - GIF
        13 - Postscript 
         4 - MacPaint

   so it looks like GIF wins by a nose.  For those of you that can\'t
   use GIF, or just don\'t like it, don\'t worry.  We\'ve got enough
   "guru" horse-power spread over the readership base that we should
   be able to accommodate almost everybody\'s limitations.

ROLE-PLAYING:
25. Besides Traveller, what other RPG\'s do you enjoy?

    Big surprise (for me anyway): AD&D by over 2 to 1!  Here\'s a list of
    all the RPG\'s that got 2 or more votes (and the number of votes they got).

      27 - AD&D                 3 - Star Trek RPG
      15 - GURPS                3 - Albedo
      10 - Twilight:2000        2 - Star Fleet Battles
       9 - Runequest            2 - Stalking the Night Fantastic
       9 - 2300 AD              2 - Space:1889
       8 - The Fantasy trip     2 - Space Opera
       8 - Shadowrun            2 - Ringworld
       8 - Call of Cthulhu      2 - Other Suns
       7 - Top Secret           2 - MechWarrior
       7 - Paranoia             2 - Marvel Super Heroes
       6 - CyberPunk            2 - Gamma World
       6 - Champions            2 - CyberSpace
       4 - Rolemaster           2 - BattleTech
       3 - Stormbringer         2 - Ars Magica
       3 - Star Wars

    Additionally, 4 people indicated that they played nothing other
    than MegaTraveller.  Now that\'s what I call devotion!

    The list of other RPG\'s mentioned is, to say the least, "diverse".
    In alphabetical order, they are: Aftermath, Arduin, Boot Hill,
    Bunnies\'n\'Burrows, Bushido, Car Wars, D&D, Daredevils, DragonQuest,
    En Garde, FTL2448, Fantasy Warhammer, Fringeworthy, Golden Heros,
    HarnMaster, Hero System, James Bond, Jorune, Judge Dredd, Lace and Steel,
    Legionnaire (Renegade Legions), Metamorphosis Alpha, NERO (A Live Medieval
    Fantasy Weekend RolePlaying Group in New England), Pendragon, Powers &
    Perils, SPAM(?), Spacemaster, Star Ace, Star Frontiers, The Arcanum,
    and Tunnels & Trolls/Monsters Monsters.

26. How many of these RPG\'s do you actually own?

    This is a hard question to quantify.  All but two people responding own
    at least one or two of the games they play, and most of the respondents
    own ALL (or almost all) the games they play regularly.

27. How many hours per month do you dedicate to ACTUALLY playing RPGs?

    Pretty straight-line distribution here:
      11 - less than 2 hours
      13 - 5-8 hours
      10 - 9-16 hours
      10 - 17-24 hours
       9 - Over 24 hours

28. What is the average age of your gaming group?

     1 - under 15
     1 - 15-17
     3 - 18-20
    19 - 21-25
    19 - 26-30
     8 - 31-35
     0 - over 35

    This confirms what many of us suspected: TML readership represents
    college-age or above individuals.  What surprised me is the fact that
    player numbers drop off sharply above age 30.  However, since role-
    playing (in almost all forms) first appeared in the early \'70s, when
    the oldest respondents would have been about 15 years old, I guess
    it does sort of make sense.

29. How many hours per month do you spend in other RPG-related activities
    (designing new adventures, painting minatures, etc.)?
    
    [ 9] less than 2 hours
    [ 7] 2-4 hours
    [11] 5-8 hours
    [13] 9-16 hours  
    [ 6] 17-24 hours
    [ 8] Over 24 hours

    Nice shallow bell-curve there.  Good.  That means that only a few
    of you pitiful wretches let this game dominate your lives. :-)

30. How far would you be willing to travel to attend a TML convention?

    [ 2] Wouldn\'t attend a TML convention
    [ 8] less than 50 miles
    [17] less than 100 miles
    [ 8] less than 300 miles
    [ 6] less than 500 miles
    [10] over 500 miles

    Now this is interesting: the two spikes are people who\'d travel
    less than 2 hours to attend, and people who\'d go almost ANYWHERE
    to attend (I, alas, fall into the 2nd group; ready my padded room
    at Bellvue :-)).

SUMMARY:

    Based on this somewhat-less-than-scientific survey, it would appear
    that the average TML reader is an unmarried, male, US citizen in his
    late 20\'s, who is in the computer industry (either as a student or an
    employee).  He\'s been a C programmer for about 10 years (as a result
    of both formal education and self-instruction), uses a UN*X workstation
    as his primary computer, and reads the TML and other BBSs/newsgroups
    about 24 hours per month.  Besides (Mega)Traveller, he enjoys AD&D
    and spends about 12 hours per month role-playing with other people
    (who are slightly younger than him) or in other RPG-related activities.
    All in all, a pretty "vanilla" sort of dude.  Who would have dreamed
    that all these years after the novel was first published, "Walter
    Mitty" would have his very own mail list? :-)

Coming up next: the first annual TML "Livestock & Sexual Preferences" survey!

For "Mexicans", substitute "Indians".  As in "Red Indians", a.k.a. Native
Americans.  The Plains Indians, to be precise - the old Vargr module made
reference to them in the section on how to role-play Vargr.  So if you want
to do space-age westerns, go for the coreward borders.

several years and were first seen in a homebrewed RPG about a colony called
Elizabethia (this RPG was probably the inspiration (almost first playtest) for
Traveller and pioneered much of the rules ).  Frank Chadwick who was GM had
a drawing of an Aslan in a Japanese 1905 era uniform charging with the bayonet.
Since the tech level of the colony where the player characters lived was
just post musket and pike era these guys were pretty scary.  Unfortunately
the game (probably the best I ever played in) devolved into Chaos before we
met the Aslan.

I don\'t know as much about the exact origins of Vargyr, Zhondai, and Hivers as
they were created to flesh out Traveller.

I would be interested.  I like military adventures and usually end up 
running all my games that way.  I don\'t mean to it just happens.  If
you decide to actually follow through with this PLEASE let me know.

Besides there being no one over age 35, there is a low number of respondents
below age 21.  This indicates that to me, that most of the readership comes
from people who a:
    Work for a company on a large world wide network
    Attend a University that is on a large world wide network
    Are experienced enough with the network to find and figure out how to
       use the network and the mailing list.

So the 21-25 gang catches the Juniors, Seniors and Grad Students and some of
the employees.  This implies that the entire survey is skewed to those types
of people.  Of course we all expected that.

Also, the new kids don\'t have the Traveller Opprotunities that we once had.
At least here in Louisville (Yes, I am the one from KY) I can count on 2 hands
to total number of Traveller items for sale in the four stores that have gaming
supplys.  I havn\'t seen a new Challenge since about issue 28 or 29.  They had
one copy of MegaTraveller.  Also, finding Traveller groups is difficult.
Our gaming group only has 1 or 2 who like Traveller besides me.  The rest are
the hard core fantasy types.  Now, when I convince them to do Traveller, I
either ref for one of the other GMs does the Traveller with AD&D rules and AD&D
characters.  We fiddled with GURPS Space and it had some success, but I was
refing it and being a Traveller born space person, I had trouble adapting to
the "Environment"  (Not the rules, but the concepts, different planet
descriptors, different ship descriptors, etc).

Any way, the young players aren\'t being exposed to Traveller and with there not
having been a serious "Space" film out in a while it has hurt the popularity of
Sci-fi for the little ones.  They see Star Trek, but that isn\'t the same.

When Traveller was at its peak here was when Star Wars, Alien, Ice Pirates (so
it wasn\'t serious), and other such movies were coming out right and left.
Maybe if Spelberg and Lucas get together they can create:  MegaTraveller, the
Movie!  (Hmmm, as a side thought, I bet we, the TML could write a nice script)
Then we could have mass marketing, MegaTraveller figures, bubble gum cards,
watches, sleeping bags, etc.   (The problems of having a 4 year old Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle Child)

other day.

We were talking about the campaign and he said (paraphrased) ,"As soon as
I get some more cash, I\'m going to have the ship\'s computer upgraded so
that just one person can operate the whole thing."  This stopped me cold.
This ship currently requires a minimum crew of three: pilot, navigator,
and engineer.  The Ref. rules say that\'s the MINIMUM.  There are no
additional rules for anything like what my player wants to do.  Now,
I can wing it and allow him to do what he wants, but I\'m concerned on
two points.

First, what would be the most logical/least-rule-bending way to do what
he wants?  My initial reaction is have him buy two stationary robots
(one for engineering and one for nav.) and require a live pilot at
all times.  My reasoning is that a \'mere\' computer could never be smart
enough (within MT guidelines) to do the jobs, and it would require at
least some synaptic processing, hence robots.  My robot design skills
are pretty much non-existant, but I guess this is a good excuse to
learn how, huh?

Second, assuming that I do allow him to succeed, what effect will it
have on game balance?  I mean, I assume that GDW/DGP put those crew
minimums in there for a reason.  Will allowing a single person with
Pilot-1 to fly around the Imperium in a 200 ton Free Trader screw
things up?  My initial reaction is "No", but I feel like I\'m over-
looking some points.

  On the other hand, there have been even fewer decent fantasy films and still
(It seem to me at least) the Fantasy side of roleplaying dominate.

  (One positive note when it comes to "renewal and recruiting" is that the
new version of the MegaTraveller1: The Zhodani Conspiracy have got very 
favorable reviews. I was afraid when I first heard about it that it would
actually do Traveller a disfavour, but it seems that I was overly pessimistic.)

  I have heard rumours from listees (I\'m not sure if it was in private email or

MegaTraveller noves. 
  A marketing success like TSR\'s Dragonlance but for MegaT would probably 
revitalize a whole lot, but that is a wild pipe-dream.

  Please, enlighten us. I\'ve got a major interest in FRP trivia and little known
stories. Stories of how the Traveller races was created, the various influences
on them and why they were named as they were are high on my list of "Nice to
know" things.
  (The name "Hivers" are self explanatory. I have read CS Lewis so I know about
Aslan, but Vargr are more obscure. The Swedish word for wolf is viritually
identical:)

  I think he was referring to the "Banana Republic" stereotype with a
revolution once per year, juntas that fragment due to infighting, a charismatic
rebel in every streetcorner and ludicrously overloaded uniforms.
  
  And there *is* a Zhodani tank that the Imperials call the Z-80 :)

  Wasn\'t the Keith(?) brothers involved in creating the Hivers. I think I\'ve

Most things I have seen lets the Pilot double as Navigator.  So that is one
position that can be easily removed.  If you wanted to (its not in the rules)
but you could make each skill operate at a -1 penelty since one person is
trying to do two jobs.  The ship could survive without a pilot more than it can
an engineer.  You have to have some one fix problems when they come up.
Traveller robots simply do not have the reasoning and intuition to figure out
where problems are.  An Engineer with good computing skills and a large
computer could probably handle a 200 ton free trader.  But I would do things
like have the ship constantly attacked by pirates and see just how long he
wants to be crewless.  Get him to carry passengers, they need Steward service.
Hey, let him have his one computer and one crew member, make him carry a real
problem passenger who just happens to make it to the bridge while he is in
engineering and turn the ship into deep space.

>First, what would be the most logical/least-rule-bending way to do what
>he wants?

Remember, the rules are just guidelines.  If you don\'t have a problem with him
doing that then by all means let him.  You can charge him a fortune for some of
the software and robots, and since some of it is \'custom\' there may be "Hidden
Features" that can lead to all sorts of adventures.

>Second, assuming that I do allow him to succeed, what effect will it
>have on game balance?

I don\'t think game balance is at threat.  What is in trouble is the "Party
Cohesion".  When you say "Its my ship, I don\'t need a crew, you are just
passangers so give me 10000cr per jump"  The rest of the party isn\'t going to
tolerate that long and will either take the ship from him forcefully or leave
to find their own way.  If he is your only player then it isn\'t a problem.  The
crew positions are there to give players something to do and give them a sense
of purpose.

Ask yourself how the rest of the party react to not having anything to do
during space flight? and during the week in jump space?

What would I do?

I would force him to have two members of the crew, a Pilot/Nav and an Engineer.
The larger the ship the more crew and thats that is needed.

This is the way I would do it except you don\'t really need two stationary
robots, one stationary robot centrally located (perhaps tied into the main
computer) could run both positions assuming it possesed the correct skills.

It shouldn\'t have any effect on game balance.  Traveller already allows
robots to be used in crew positions.  In my current campaign, the party
has one mech droid which they use as assistant engineer (the ship requires
two engineers and only one person on board has any skill).  In fact this
may be an economical way to operate a ship.  You need to consider the cost
of building and maintaining the robot plus the cost of any modification to
the ship to allow it to run automatically with the cost of hiring a crew
member to do the same job.  An engineer with skill level 1 and BRN of 1
get a salary of 500Cr/month (I think) plus lifesupport of Cr4000/month for
a total of Cr4500/month or Cr54,000 per year.  If the robot cost say
Cr200,000, it would pay for itself in only 4 years or 1/10 the life of the
ship\'s loan!  On the other hand a PC in that position (at least in my 
games) is cheaper because he works for no salary and your going to pay for
his life support anyway!  

I do think that the Imperium would require at least one living being on board
at all times however (ie no completely automated robot ships) because
their artificial intelligence technology is still pretty young and not
to be fully trusted.  Moreover, if *you* wanted, you could impose a -DM to
robots in the minimum crew positions during high stress situations such as
combat on the grounds that they are not truely intelligent and would not be
able to act on a hunch or knowingly exceed reccomended safty limits for the
device (ie engines) in question or such like.

This does bring up a good question that maybe should be addressed namely
"What is the role of Artificial (or better Simulated) Intelligence in
Traveller?"  How does one handle adding synaptic units to the main computers
of a ship?  It should be possible.  The more I think about this the more
questions and situations pop into my mind.  I need to think about this some
more and post a list of thoughts on the topic after I\'ve had some time to
organize them.

Try this on for size.  Put in the new computer (and don\'t forget that you
need three of them to be safe--Dow Rieder was the one who suggested that we
should allow you to have different models of computer on one ship, fighting
as the most proficient, but control as the least proficient) and calculate
the crew values.  I don\'t think the MT rules require you to have a navigator,
do they?  A navigator is part of the Bridge crew, and that appears to have
a minimum of one, because you round up fractions when calculating.  
Engineering also rounds up fractions.  So what I would do is calculate the
required crew retaining fractional values with the new computer.  If the total
of bridge and engineering is less than one, and if the character has pilot,
navigation, and engineering skill, I\'d be inclined to let in run the ship
single-handedly.  What do you mean by "at all times"?  Are you presently
requiring three shifts worth of pilots?  If modern aircraft can fly on auto-
pilot for extended periods of time, I\'d have no problem with allowing a TL9+
starship to operate on autopilot most of the time, with the human there to
override/make suggestions in an emergency.  The controls are all computer
driven anyway.  However, the robot idea isn\'t a bad one even if you allow a
single character to run the ship.  There will (Murphy\'s Law) inevitably be
simultaneous crises in engineering and navigation some day....Robots are 
pretty cheap compared to the computer upgrade.

I can\'t see that it would be a problem.  There will remain disadvantages. 
There is no chance of doing any damage control during a battle, and if you
get tossed in jail on a high-law planet, no crewmembers around to bail you
out..."Bare is brotherless back".

Has this player been watching Star Trek III recently?  Remind him of what
happens if everything is automated, and the computer gets damaged.

Other possibilities:

. The pilot gets in trouble with Imperial authorities for violating safety
regulations (that minimum of 3 crew could be a legal, not physical,
requirement).

. He can\'t get his ship loaded, unloaded, or otherwise handled by starport
personnel.  The Navigators\' and Engineers\' Unions are upset with him for
making their members redundant, and the Starport Workers\' Union is helping
them by boycotting his ship.

On the other hand, there is a precedent for this, and it doesn\'t require
the computer to be upgraded.  It requires the pilot to be upgraded.  One
person can do more than one job, provided that the person is skilled for
all the jobs.  For each additional job, the character\'s effective skill
is reduced by one.  So, if the pilot wants to navigate as well, he needs
Pilot-2 and Navigation-2; if he does both, he does so at Pilot-1 and
Navigation-1.  If he has Pilot-3, Navigation-3, Engineering-3, and the
ability to run quickly from the engine room to the bridge, then he can
fly the ship by himself, with all three skills effectively at level 1.

automating a gunner, or navigator would be more possible, but again, I don\'t

skill level 1 or 0.  They don\'t have the same kind of intuition or aquisition

with me, but that\'s my stance.

I think of the robots in Silent Running.  They were programmed for particular
basic tasks, but they often came up against things that they couldn\'t handle,
and had to be programmed or instructed.

You would have more success using robots to suplement existing personel on a
larger ship, having an engineer and 2 robots instead of 2 engineer.  Say you
have a gunner on a ship with multiple turrets mostly run by \'robots\'; the
gunner could program new tactics into the robots as he comes up with them from
his experience, like what to do when two targets scissor, etc...

There\'s now way in hell, I\'d want to be on a ship run by a pilot 1 and robots.
at the very least, the pilot *has* to have all the skills needed to run the
ship, like Eng, Nav, even if the ship is automated.  What will you do if the
jump drive won\'t work, and the robot can\'t figure it out?  Kick it?  With some
skill, at least you can do *something*!

It might be possible to get along without a Navigator if the pilot has
navigation skill, but it will take him longer to do the work required then it
would for two people, and that might be critical in some situations.

In the campaigns that I run, I usually allow players to automate their
ships using robots if they wish.  I feel that most positions on a ship
can be handled by a high tech robot -- it preserves the "far future"
feel of the game.  However, this doesn\'t mean that this is as good as
having a real live sophont in the position, especially in jobs which
require creative and innovative thought.

For instance, a player may put a pilot bot into their ship.  This would
be good in a nobles unstreamlined staryacht, perhaps, since it never
reenters or fights in combat (hopefully), but could be a disaster if
a dangerous situation arises.  Gunnery robots would be terrific in a
merchant -- why pay for gunners you never use, especially in exposed 
turrets, when you can use their staterooms for paying passengers.   In
an emergency, a robot gunner could hold its own, perhaps.  But on a 
battleship, highly trained gunners would be preferable.

Furthermore, robots are expensive to purchase and maintain.  They can
break down at inopportune moments -- the EMP that knocked out your 
jump drive also can get your engineering robot.  Now how do you fix
everything?  Of course, having one engineer robot and several sophonts
can be handy in a situation where you don\'t want to send something
alive into danger -- corrosive gas or hard radiation, perhaps.  If 
whatever goes in will die, why not send an automaton?  Robots can be
replaced; players hate to roll up new characters.

Medical robots are great -- but like Larry Niven says in his Known
Space books, it\'s almost frightening how many things could go wrong
with a damaged autodoc.  This means that you\'d better make sure you
buy a medical robot from a reputable dealer, and it better be _very_
sturdy!

So go ahead and build some robots!  Just remember, robots have their
limitations, just like living crew, and have some fun.

You have crews because you need a certain amount of labor to run/maintain
things.  Robots can easily manage things at the nominal levels (most new
airliners today--late Tech 7?--can pretty much fly and land themselves; the
human crews, if they wanted, could let the jets fly themselves and stay on
only as an emergency redundant system; as for repairs, a CD rom disc 
probably has enough room for "The 10,001 Things Most Likely to Go Wrong
on Your Spacecraft, and How to Fix Them" files, so your maintenance crews
are probably not a problem, either).  This is the easiest thing to do;
if your player wants a fully automated spacecraft, a robotic brain would
cost five times (and double mass) for what regular controls cost (and
double this cost if you are tearing out existing controls instead of
simply building a new ship--this covers the additional labor costs, etc.)
At least, that is how I have it set up.  Mind you, this does not include
any additional costs for special maintenance facilities that you might
want on an automated ship (or any ship) making very long voyages.

I have a feeling that the reason why the rules are set up include the
following:

     1) People have not thought through the potential for robotics,
        especially for jobs that are mostly tedium, but sometimes require
        real creative problem-solving (ship crews, etc.)

     2) If you can have everything done by robots, it limits what player
        characters can do.  It\'s hard to start off an adventure by shipping
        out on a free trader with a motley crew if the credit-strapped
        captain knows that robots will work harder and longer and complain
        less.  (They will cost more at first, but any good businessman
        with the initial credit for a spacecraft could get the additional
        5% he would need to buy an entire robotic crew, knowing in the 
        long run it would be far more profitable--you don\'t have to pay
        robots once you own them.)  The easy out is to assume that there
        is a limit to how good one can build a portable mechanical brain;
        if there are obvious limits, then robots can only be so smart,
        and certain jobs will always remain the territory of humans.

        (I have a feeling that our real future with robots will end up
        with different classes being built--most robots will be about as
        intelligent as mice, or not even that smart, so they can handle
        jobs that are dangerous or tedious, but will have the basic
        creative problem-solving abilities that will let them deal with
        unusual situations pretty well--an industrial accident that
        doesn\'t kill anyone because all the workers are robots is a
        good thing, but if the robots are too stupid to get out of the
        burning factory, and you lose 500 million credits worth of 
        robots, it is a very bad thing.  Other robots may be true AIs,
        as smart as we are, and they will be given rights, etc.  The
        other option, for a Traveller-like civilization, one that has
        had time to go through the growing pains of robotic influences
        on society, might be to outlaw the creation of robots that can
        totally replace humans, as this is a technology that creates
        some pretty serious strains on society.  By the time of
        Traveller, people would have developed robots that are very
        smart, smarter than people even, if it is possible to do it,
        and we would have learned what having a new race of sophont
        beings does to our society.  We might also end up as a race
        of "gods"--human beings would control enormous armies of
        robots, which can be programmed for loyalty no matter how
        smart they are (and "police" robots can take care of any
        robots with bad programming) who would do all the things
        that people do now.  Or the robots will just kill us off
        as part of the "natural evolution from carbon-water life
        to silicon life.")

     Mark, tell me something.  Just how is it that you accidentally
stumble over the gimmick that I was planning to use in the upcoming
adventure that I\'ll be running?  No, never mind, it\'s not that
important...spooky, though.  ;-)

 >robots (one for engineering and one for nav.) and require a live pilot
 >at all times.

     Good instincts.  Since I was planning to use this little tidbit,
I\'ve done a lot of thinking about the subject.  Actually, I\'m doing it
a little bit different--in my upcoming session, the idea is to have a
ship that requires *no* organo-sentient (I like this word :-) ) crew at
all.  This includes a ship that has no provision for life support (hey,
it\'s a *prototype*, okay? :-) ).  I don\'t have to tell you why various
factions in the traveller universe would find this little gem desirable,
do I?  No, I didn\'t think so.  ;-)

 >My reasoning is that a \'mere\' computer could never be smart enough
 >(within MT guidelines) to do the jobs,

     Define "mere."  I\'m doing it by mixing some technologies--robot
brains and standard computers.  High tech level, of course, but that\'s
a gimmie.  However, the whole point (at least, in my case) is that it\'s
*not* off-the-shelf equipment--experimental, and it doesn\'t work all too
well yet (and will continue so, at least for another tech level).
However, your players and their characters don\'t necessarily know this--
situation fodder.  Heck, there are lots of things in the real world like
this--it works, sort of, but in a not-especially-practical way; look at
OS/2.  ;-)

 >and it would require at least some synaptic processing, hence robots.

     Bingo.  Give the man a cheroot.  The idea I came up with was
installing a computer *much* larger than the ship needs (say, a Model
5 or 6 on a 200 ton Far Trader hull), and adding a snynaptic processing
module to it, thus making it a robot brain, of a sort.  All the control
lines go into it, and, where it needs independent manipulators, small
maintenance drones are linked to it in a master/slave relationship.
This all works fairly well, since we haven\'t wandered too far afield
from the published rules.  What I\'ve just done is make a big starship-
shaped robot.  A little extrapolation is needed, but that\'s all.

     For your purposes, you can go a little simpler--a big computer,
with add-on synaptics and only a rudimentary decision-making
capability (since you expect to have at least one organo-sentient
present at all times).

     Remember one thing about this, though.  Synaptic processors have
to be *taught*.  At the very beginning, your fancy new ship\'s brain
will be little more than a standard computer with a lot of potential.
It will make mistakes if the crew lets it have too much initiative.
It also runs the risk of developing a personality--there\'s a lot of
unused potential there.  I\'m not necessarily saying that it\'ll be
truly sentient, but it may act like it.  As I recall, there\'s a
planetful of sentient robots (the Sabmiqys--Challenge 28, page 31, and
the article is written by Joe Fugate) at TL17.  So our little efforts,
built at more normal (and more available) Imperial tech levels, can
be considered non-sentient, even if they exhibit wilful and irrational
behavior.  :-)  After all, that\'s not necessarily an attribute of
sentience; my car acts that way all the time, and *it\'s* not sentient.
I think.  ;-)

     Yup.  It\'s not that difficult.  About like designing vehicles.

     My considered opinion (considered for several weeks, in fact) is
that it won\'t have much effect on game balance.  Just limit it.  For
instance, if a very oversized computer is needed as the base platform,
this rules out doing this to really large ships, since they need
computers that big just to operate--there won\'t be enough spare
capacity available.  Also, it\'s not a mature technology yet--there\'re
bound to be some teething problems.  Not to mention having to deal
with training the synaptic processor.

     Actually, now that I think about it, there\'s no need to get that
elaborate.  Your PCs can just buy a couple of robots with the
appropriate skills in software.  The robot would count as a crewember,
if not especially skilled or disposed to intiative.  There would still
have to be a human in charge.

     Also, I just thought of something else.  Consider attitudes toward
robots.  Vilani, especially, since they\'re a touch technophobic.  There
has been some anti-robot agitation out Solomani Rim way, too.

 >What do you folks think?

     Should they be allowed to have an (even partially) automated ship?
Sure.  Why not?  Provided, of course, that they\'re prepared to deal
with (and endure) all the possible negative aspects of the situation.
They may decide that it\'s not worth the expense and effort.  Or, it may
save their tails in a tight spot.  "You never can tell."  ;-)

I have a character that through long convoluted devious channels (treachery)
earned herself a custom built starship.  She wanted something good enough
to withstand any normal-ship (escorts and down) attack, and extreme endurance
(she wanted to jump out into deep space and stay there for a while for personal
survival reasons...).  It also had to be single-crew operable...

The solution was a heavily redundant 600 ton \'Special Lab Ship\' [neat cover name
with addl. background that she\'s a scientist helping...].  It had 3 model
6/fib computers (note the intrinsic redundancy in each system...) and ECP
and such...and each of the main computers was paired with a Best-At-TL15
robot brain, with Pilot, Nav, Engineering, etc. out the ears.  My justification
was that the robots were going to be smart enough to handle the piloting tasks,
and each robot had enough talent to handle it all alone...

But this has it\'s problems.  First, if something breaks that the maintenance bot
can\'t replace, you\'ve only got one person to help with it.  If the robots
encounter a totally out-of-ordinary situation, at TL15 they\'re not really
creative enough to solve it well.  Etc.  One of the more lethal near-accidents
(lesson 1- if you run for the hills, stay there...) occured when a biological
agent that ate computer components got loose on another PC ship... had the GM
been particularly evil, and my char. unlucky, she would have been sitting dead
in space with an unmanagable pile of junk.  

Summarizing:
Use Robots tied to computers as replacement for crew.  It makes some sense in
most situations.
Be prepared to have difficulty handling out-of-the-ordinary situations if you 
do.  Robots aren\'t really bright at TL15.

This reminds me of an incident I arranged a long time ago while I was referee.
The PC\'s ship was boarded by some people wearing impressive uniforms, and
carrying impressive ID cards and FGMP\'s.  The leader claimed to be from the
local navy, and was checking their ship over to make sure it complied with
safety regulations.  The boarders then proceeded to do their checks, failing
the ship on a whole lot of counts such as the wrong sort of paint in the
cargo hold, a minor scratch in the paintwork of a fuel line, and the ship\'s
hull being made of the wrong alloy.  (It wasn\'t; at least, the PC\'s didn\'t
know it was, nor did the boarders, and nor did the referee.)  After the
safety inspectors had succeeded in annoying the PC\'s, one of the PC\'s started
to seem to be leading towards threatening remarks, at which point the leading
inspector warned the PC\'s not to try anything, there was a nuon gun on the
planet targetted on this ship.  ("What\'s a nuon gun?"  "Like a meson gun,
but better.")

The leading boarder eventually revealed that there was nothing wrong with
the ship, as far as he knew.  Mind you, he didn\'t know a lot, because the
PC\'s were the victim of a local holovision practical joke show (a bit like
Candid Camera).  The FGMP\'s were models made from kits, with the cameras
fitted inside them.  There was indeed no such thing as a nuon gun.  And by
way of compensation, the PC\'s were given a free lunch by the holonet company.

Actually, it was quite a good lunch.

No, *some* crew must be aboard to take care of emergencies.  I expect traveller
starships will be very similiar.

The other question I\'ve had for a long time is that there seems to be an
assumption in general that on traveller ships that there is always someone on
watch 24 hours a day on the bridge and engineering.  Yet the crew on board is
no where near anything what would be required?

Are 24 hour watches really required?  I\'d have a hard time sleeping, knowing
that their is nobody at the wheel, though.  I figure that at the least,
*someone* of even the most minimal skill has to be on the bridge at all times,
and they summon someone if anything anything bad or unfamiliar happens.  On the
other hand, on scouts, perhaps they simply set all the computer alarms, and
take a snooze, and possibly get a hell of a wake up!

I\'ve only recently begun running parties with robots in the crew; my
first exposure has been very good. The party I\'m running (and about which
you read here occasionally in the fiction pieces drawn from the game) has
one robot at the moment, a medical/steward \'bot with a fair degree of skill.
This frees up having to have a party member be a Medical type, either for
shootemup safety or meeting SPA/ASTC regs for ship crews> And then there
was Hector, but, well, you\'ll find out more about him in upcoming stories.|->

As for utterly automated ships, this gives rise to all sorts of fascinating
scenaria, most of which I think would work better in a game like Space Opera
than in MT, but that\'s a personal bias.....

"Oh! Uh, well, uh, um, I *guess* it\'s for sale, but frankly I don\'t think
you gentlebeings would be very interested in it...."
"Not interested?! The Denoba\'s one of the best rimrunners ever to upship!
Why the hell wouldn\'t we be interested?"
"Er, yes, the Denoba as a CLASS are excellent craft, and that one back there
would fetch a high price, assuming...."
"Assuming WHAT?"
"Assuming that the people who bought it could average more than three hops 
before they got killed."
"HUH?"
"Yeah, see, that\'s the problem. The computer\'s gotten kind of antisocial;
it keeps spacing its crews. We can\'t get to it to disconnect it, either.
You see the problem?"

    'body' => '  I didn\'t read the TML during the last few days, Instead I was at home writing
hard on Rebel Guard and a little on a writeup of some robots that have appeared
in my campaign. Someone mentioned once that robots should be useful so I 
recomputed them for several TL\'s to make it easier for the referee.
  I saw Mark F Cooks letter about automating starships before I left, and I
remember thinking that it would be nice if I could get that robot paper finished
while the topic was hot. "Hot" proved to be an understatement:)

  I agree that I am a member of the pro-robotic faction on the TML, but even I
would tend to think that a ship with only one crewmember and the rest of them
robots are to take chances. Why do scout and belters have so high survival 
numbers? Because they are alone in their ships, thats why. And a big, highly
automated ship with just one crewmember could be compared to a simple scout
ship that one person could handle alone *unless mishaps occured*.

  Then there is the legal aspect. Refusing to assist a ship that screams out
SOS and GK on all channels is quite certainly a high justice crime just below
treason and importing bruisers. Blaming the incident on the robots, "They 
didn\'t wake me, your Honor. The medibot thought that I needed to sleep." isn\'t
going to land anyone anywhere else than on Exile/Usani.

  As additions to a crew, however, they are quite useful, as long as someone has
at least one level of appropriate skill so that the robot can be supervised now
and then.

  Well, here\'s the shipboard duty bots from the file Robots.txt.utx. If you are 
sceptical to robots aboard ships you can always treat the descriptions as pure 
marketing hype for unwary players to get suckered by (except in the MasterMek 
XT-3 case of course:) 

19 Robots for duty aboard ships.

   The following robots have all appeared over the years in my campaign. The 
only robot that has stayed on for more than two years (gametime) is a Naasirka
(more or less)MasterMek XT3 that goes by the name "Marvin" (Don\'t blame me!:).
   All the robots has been upgraded for MegaTraveller by taking volume for 
*all* components into account and recomputing cost and weight for the chassi 
according to the armour multiplier. Appendages were treated as having a volume 
equal to twice their weight that only can be used for devices and not for 
brain, fuel, powerplant or propulsion.
   The speed of robots using legs, whennls or tracks was somewhat tricky to 
compute. If the formula from megatraveller is used, most of them got speeds in 
the range of 500 to 1000kph not counting streamlining. When I looked at the two
robots in \'Vilani & Vargr\', however, I found that the engine output was divided
by around 28 before it was used in the formula, so I did the same.
   I used the standard thrust/speed table for robots using grav locomotion.
   I\'m not sure if robots should be covered by the 20% price reduction for mass
produced vehicles, so I\'ve included both figures. I think that it should 
because it would give players some impetus to buy a standard item instead of 
ordering a custom design job.
   Damagepoints for robots have been computed according to the referees screen 
(vol in liters/15 for inop and /6 for dest.) Damagepoints for powerplant and 
locomotion was computed based on their fraction of the robots weight.
   Vilani manufacured robots, ie Naasirka and Makhidkarun, are easy to get in 
half-custom configurations with regards to the application programs. When 
"Skill-L(S)" is indicated this means that the robot can be delivered with any 
skill or skills that can be fit into the constraints imposed by the robots Int 
and Edu and available storage space. "L" means max sum of extra skillevels and 
"S" means maximum extra storage available.
   All application programs are also available in exterior storage 
(holocrystals usually) for five times the normal cost of a program of that 
level.

LING STANDARD PRODUCTS 200-SERIES MEDIBOTS
   The 200-series medibots from LSP is used by several mercenary organisations 
as well as on a multitude of ships. All models have Medic-4 and Rescue-4. The 
medic skill is usually tuned to \'Imperial Standard Human\' but serves at the 
same level for all the three large brances of Humaniti and at one level lower 
for most minor human races (Darrians, Answerin, Dynchia, and Geonee but not 
Floriani) and for Vargr.
   TL15 models also having Xenomed-4 for one of the following races (buyers 
choise): Aslan, Droyne, Hiver, K\'kree, Ael Yael, Bwaps, Chirpers, Prt\', Vegans 
or Virushi. Data for other minor races might be available locally.
   The 200-series medibots use fuelcells and are thus dependent on exterior 
oxygen. Because of this, they are of similar shape and size to humans, to 
enable them to use vaccsuits and normal medikits if they have to work in 
situations where oxygen isn\'t available. The lower pair of arms fold in along 
the torso to make the robot fit into a normal vaccsuit.
   The C models are fitted with enough synaptic memory units to be able to 
reach education A after some years of operation.

MAKHIDKARUN RP-SERIES ROBOTIC PILOTS
   Makhidkarun RP-series robotic pilots are a good example of how Makhidkarun 
robotics are different from for example the equivalent Naasirka models. It is 
built to handle a specific task and thats what it does. The extra capability 
that is made available because of the relatively high intelligence needed 
(after all, who would want a dumbot to pilot the ships-boat?) is used to 
accomodate two or more seconday skills that the buyer can choose according to 
his own purposes.
   The RP-series are shaped like a rectangular box, fifteen centimeters thick 
times thirty wide times one meter high. They are made to be mounted on the 
back of the pilots chair and hooked up to the ships computer, power and 
sensors (they lack own powerplant and propulsion). On top of the box is a very 
light arm that holds the visual and audio sensor. The robot is not dependent 
on those for normal operation. The arm can be used for lifting and grasping 
but this is limited to very light loads (less than 5kg)
   The following secondary programs are generally available, space and price 
are per level, maximum level of any skill for robots is 4:

Program           Space   Price       Program           Space   Price
Communications      2      400        SensorOps           2      500
FleetTactics        8      800        Ship\'sBoat          2      400
GravVehicle         2      400        ShipTactics         8      800
Language            5      600        Survey              4      600
Navigator           4      500        [Gunnery]           2      400
Prospecting         4      500        [Weapon]*           2      300

   Additional programs can be found in Traveller Book8: Robots. *) Weapon aims 
at a specific weapon skill. It is quite common to let the robot have one level 
of skill in snub pistol or some similar small zero-gee weapon and employ it as 
the last line of defence against boarding and hijackers.

   The main disadvantage with this series of robots is that they are fixed in 
place. Even if they detect some kind of malfunction they can\'t do anything 
about it. Also, if the power disappears because of battle damage or 
malfunction, they are totally disabled.

   There is also a similar line of robots serving as gunners or as small craft 
pilots. They are usually delivered with one form of gunnery as main skill and 
either fleet or ship tactics as secondary. Any extra space or Int+Edu is then 
filled by FAGunnery to enable the batteries to be used for surface bombardment.

MORA MECATRONICS MARKSMAN-SERIES ROBOTIC GUNNERS
   Although designed on Mora, the Mora Mecatronics robots are manufactured and 
sold on many worlds with many techlevels along the Spinward Main. The most 
popular of their robots are the Marksman series gunners. While they are can\'t 
be described as intelligent even by friendly accounts, the are easy to install.
Just show the robot to the gunnery position and it will take over from there. 
They are also much cheaper than many competeting models.
   Normally, the robots will get their instructions directly from the ships 
computer. A program that lets the pilot indicate the target on whatever HUD or 
viewscreen that available on the bridge and pass this on to the robots are 
included in the standard package. The robots are programmed to hook themselves
up to ships power and the main computer databus automatically.
   Mora Mecatronics robots of the local TL are available on world on 3+. DM -1 
per 3 parsecs from Mora. -4 if off the Main.

MASTERMEK SERIES MEKBOT (NAASIRKA UUKUGINE ADGAR-SERIES MEKBOT)
   In the late 1080\'s, Naasirka analysts noticed that their smaller competitor 
Makhidkarun had a big market dominance in the big mekbot niche and the 
administration decided, after long deliberation, that the technology in this 
field was mature enough for Naasirka to step in.
   In 1109 they unveiled the Uukugine Adgar (rough translation "Don\'t worry") 
series robot -- The robot that would take care of all that nasty business that 
takes place in the aft end of the ship and not bother the owner at all until 
it was time to buy spare parts.
   The development had been on shedule all the time, the prototypes had passed 
the trial periods with flying colors and the marketing department were 
predicting a commercial success. Then something happened.
   To get the robot to take proper care of the drives and installations in a 
ship, the Naasirka developers had equipped it with a strong, one could almost 
call it feelings, for properly working drives and equippment. When the robots 
came out in real live they were often put in situations where they got to do 
preventive maintainance and general repair of all of the equippment belonging 
to a ship.
   They had to repair small crafts and vehicles that had minor, and not so 
minor accidents, often involving weapons. They had to push the drives to the 
limit to evade hostile ships in the frontier war. Sometimes they got the same 
crafts and vehicles back again with similar damage after a few days. Sometimes 
they was forced to push the drives too hard and that damaged the drives.
   Some robots that was harassed in this way cracked after a few years. They 
begun to suffer from minor quirks. Some of them begun to neglect their work. 
Some of them became obsessed with total cleanliness in all areas of the ship. 
Some started to refuse to repair things that had been broken. Very few of them,
but one had been enough, used force to show the crew the proper way of 
treating their equippment...
   Very soon, the media caught on "Killer Robots with Lasers!" as the Imperial
Enquierer with its usual sense for the appropriate called it in a headline 
dated 054-1114. Sales deflated overnight. Nobody wanted a monster in their 
engine room.
   Naasirka managed to locate the problem and correct it very fast but the 
market strategy was in shambles. They took their only rout available to them 
which was to rename the series and transfer it to a daugher company. All old 
Uukugine Adgars were exchanged for new, corrected, MasterMeks. The new 
advertising strategy didn\'t call it the solution to all the engineering needs, 
but rather a very handy addition. This strategy worked but all the glitches in 
the robot model was still not ironed out.
   The corrections decreased the rate with which the robots broke and decrease 
the severity if they did, but it didn\'t stop it completely. It was still 
possible for extremely careless operators to make it crack. One big incident 
occured in mid 1116 when an MasterMek hijacked a Al-Morai liner and changed 
it\'s destination from Maitz to Mora. All major media reported on the "Naasirka 
Robotic Hijacker" and the local management for the Domain of Deneb took the 
decition to order the daughter company to discontinue the MasterMek due to the 
bad publicity that landed on Naasirka. All other local officed followed this 
decition.
   When the big Naasirka withdrawal from the territories far from the Ziru 
Sirkaa during late 1118 was finished many daughter companies had simply been 
sold off and the production rights had passed on to the new owners. Some of 
those begun production anew after renaming the robot once again.
   Referee: Whenever a Uukugine Adgar/MasterMek has to repair the same piece 
of equippment twice in a week (twice in a day if it is minor equippment) or an 
order to push the drives over the limit (as per StarshipOpMan) leads to damage 
to the ship. Roll this task:
   To keep the robot sane:
   Routine, RobotOps, Liaison, (fateful)
   Referee: If it is a bloc two model (after the errors was partially 
corrected) make this task Simple. Superficial mishaps are minor quirks. Minor 
mishap: The robot begins to take a view on how the equippment and ships is 
treated. Major mishap: The robot refuses to repair things, refused to perform 
actions that could possible damage the ships or equippment or becomes careless.
Destroyed mishap: The robot becomes violent.

   Marvin is presently at the Major mishap stage. He\'s got a number of quirks: 
he sings old strange songs while he work, he is very vocal and argumentative
during discussions and he has to be coaxed to push the drives hard or sabotage 
enemy ships "Well, if you *don\'t* do this Marvin, [the current enemy] will 
catch us and then you won\'t have any drives to take care of at all!"
   Besides, a borderline robot with a laserwelder in the engineroom can be 
useful when someone tries to board. "What?! Disable *my* drives?! Oh no you 
don\'t! <zap!>" :)

   Some notes about obscure devises:
   The two visual sensors are attached to a cut-down pair of PRIS glasses with 
the gyroscope taken out and the magnifying features replaced by short range 
magnification for working with small components.
   The reason for the extra sensitivity olfactory sensor is simple: Hot plastic
and metal smell and if the robot can detect that it has a great chance of 
locating the errors before they appear fully.
   The densitometer is mounted on one of the medium arms to be outside of the 
range of influence of the gravunits. It is, however, unusable while the ship 
uses gravitation technology of any kind.
   The ZGCombat-1 enable the robot to work in zero gee conditions, using it\'s 
gravunits at half strength.
   The master unit is intended to enable the robot to control up to five , 
MasterMek T robots that are identical, but lacks the brain. Production of the 
T model ceased in early 1114 however, and it has not been restarted anywhere 
as of 1121. The T models costed about 20% of equivalent XT model and they had 
far longer duration.

I feel like I\'m going a bit out on a limb here, but from what I understand,
in a routine situation some modern passenger jets _can_ land by themselves
at a properly equipped airport.  I vaguely recall seeing a show which
mentioned that the Boeing 757 had this capability.  As I recall, most pilots
prefer not to use this function of the airplane, because the idea makes
them feel a bit uneasy.  Of course, if the pilot was incapacitated, this
might be handy...but in a storm, using it would be, well, inadvisable
(and probably illegal).  Please check this out yourselves, since I know
very little about this sort of thing, and could be wrong!

>No, *some* crew must be aboard to take care of emergencies.  I expect traveller
>starships will be very similar.

If I was building a robot-piloted craft, I\'d feel best about one which
was used outside of atmospheres and insystem only, avoiding the two most
hazardous ship operations -- atmospheric transfer and jump initiation.
I\'d feel even better if it didn\'t have much thrust; just in case. Then if
something goes wrong, someone can send a boat out to catch it, especially
if it was aimed at something important -- like Regina High Port.  If it
was carrying something especially important, it would be nice to have a 
sapient pilot and mechanic/engineer on board (and maybe a medic, if it\'s
a long trip and you don\'t trust robot doctors).

On a totally unrelated subject, in a AD&D V2R1 (some reason SVR4 is stuck in my
head) game that I am reffing, I found this on a characters sheet of one of my
players:

Weapons of Proficiancy
[ Long Sword         ]
[ Long Bow           ]
[ FGMP-15            ]
[ Dagger             ]

Seems humerous :-)

So someone else has been reading Adventure 1, Kinunir!

A few comments on TL 15 automated ships.  First, given that TL 8 aircraft have
fairly effective auto-pilots, I\'d expect that a ship\'s auto-pilot of TL 10 or
more could land the ship.  (Come to that, the TL 8 Space Shuttle practically
lands itself.  The pilot is there in case all four computers malfunction.  On
one occasion when the shuttle did land manually, the landing was a bit bumpier
than the previous computer-controlled ones.)  Also, in Ye Olde Book 3, in the
section about equipment, it mentioned that ground cars were computer driven
at TL 10, and in fact in some places driving by humans was illegal.  So at TL
15, I\'d be surprised if a ship couldn\'t take off, fly, and land by itself
without human interference.  Assuming, that is, that nothing unexpected
happened.  Computers can only deal with the expected, i.e. what the programmer
expected.  Human crews would be there in case of the unexpected, and might be
required by law - especially on passenger carrying craft.

There is, of course, one problem with making everything TL 15.  What do you
do for spare parts when (N.B. "when", not "if") something breaks down?  This
is why ships like Type S Scout/Couriers and Type A Free Traders are TL 9 or
TL 10.  There are more TL 10+ planets out there than TL 15+ planets.

the possibility of running ships with reduced crew, even without
the help of robots or oversized computers.  You just increase the

    'body' => 'I realize that we haven\'t touched on this topic for a while, and I
hate to re-open this can of worms, but I just got struck by a thought
that\'s too wierd not to share.

I\'ve been reading the Science&Technology stream on the MegaTraveller
BBS on GEnie.  At one point they started talking about black globes
and a) whether or not they were affected by gravity, b) what happens
when something solid strikes them, and c) how do they affect their
surroundings when they\'re landed on a planet.

The consensus (which includes such prestigious names a Joe Fugate,
James Holden, Ed Edwards, and Mike Mikesh) is:

A)  Black globes cut off gravity.  If you turn one on while in orbit
    around a large body (i.e. planet), you suddenly take off in a straight
    line, tangetial to that body.

B)  Any solid striking a black globe will demonstrate all the properties
    of a perfect inelastic collision, with all the kenetic energy tranferred
    to the globe.  The only thing the occupants of the globe would notice
    is an energy raise in their capacitors.

C)  If a black globe were to be set down on a planets surface, it would
    immediately begin to drain the energy of everything in contact with
    it.  This means the thermal and kenetic energy of the atmosphere and
    ground (or water if you landed at sea) would be intantaneously trans-
    ferred to the globe, causing gases and fluids to freeze.  Of course,
    once a sufficiently thick layer of ice (at absolute zero) forms on the
    surface of the globe, the thermal transfer would slow down, since it\'s
    now taking place through a layer of normal (very cold) matter.

I know, I know, the TML readership pretty much came to the same decisions
separately, I\'m just setting the background for my inspiration, which is
this:

I don\'t think that situation C would ever have time to occur.  If the
globe absorbs ALL collisions and is uneffected by gravity, wouldn\'t an
ENTIRE planet pushing against it cause it\'s capacitors to overload REAL
fast?  This assumes the planet even stays in contact long enough to
transfer that much energy.

Picture this: you have a starship equiped with a black globe, and you
are in a star system where there is a world orbiting at 146.6 km/sec.
at 1 AU.  You calculate a straight-line vector through the system such
that your course will intersect that of the planet a split second before
the planet gets there.  You also plan to be travelling slightly slower
than the planets obital velocity, say 140 km/sec.  If you could somehow
eliminate gravitational effects on your ship during this course, then
when you arrived at the intersection point, the planet would come up
and smack you in the ass at 6.6 km/sec.  Aha!  But you can eliminate
the gravitation effects!  Just come up to the correct velocity on your
course and turn on your black globe generator.  Now you\'re on a straight
line course through the system.

At the appointed time, you intersect the planet\'s orbit just as it
catches up with you.  Your ship (surrounded by the globe) burrows
into the atmosphere and is stuck by the planetary surface at 6.6 km/sec.
However, you are unaffected by the impact as all the kenetic energy
is absorbed by the globe and tranferred to the capacitors.  Your
vector and velocity CANNOT change becauce this requires interaction
with some outside force (ANY outside force) and the black globe prevents
this.  Result: your ship burrows right thru the planet at 6.6 km/sec.,
side-slipping as it goes (you\'re not following the same orbital path
as the planet, remember?).  All the planetary material (crust, mantle,
core, etc.) is pushed aside by the other matter around it, with the
friction, pressure, and compression energies all absorbed by the globe.

Good-bye planet, yes?  Well, maybe if you had capacitors with infinite
storage capability.  But since you don\'t, they probably overload just
a split-second after your globe impacts the planets surface.  Good-bye
capacitors.  Good-bye black globe.  Good-bye starship.  Hello huge,
blast crater.  C\'est la vie.  Heck, maybe it wouldn\'t even need to
make contact with the planet\'s surface.  I suspect that plowing through
200 klicks of atmosphere at 6+ km/sec. would generate several A-bombs
worth of energy.  That would probably do it all by itself.

Hmmmm.  Come to think of it, maybe that\'s what caused the Great Tunguska
Event of 1908 in Siberia. :-)

(Tuglikki 0904), a Vargr researcher activated a black globe and it promptly
expanded to engulf a radius of 50 km from its location within 24 hours. That
was in 973 (Imperial). That black globe engulfed the entire world within a
year and kept growing, although at a slower rate. The black globe has reached
20,000 km in size and continues to grow at a rate of about 20 km per standard
year.  In about 2 trillion years, assuming the globe\'s rate remains constant,
it will have engulfed all of charted space. Recently, however -- for some
unknown reason -- the globe\'s expansion rate has been increasing dramatically.
Many researchers theorize this increased expansion rate means the globe is

      <In actuality, I see the energy sinks of the owning vessel going

      You\'re right.  I just ran through the equations, and what I found
 was that the energy in de-orbiting and that which a J-1 ship could
 absorb was well over 10 million times in difference.
      The scarry thing about this was that the lion\'s share of the
 energy was in the form of potential energy ( E=mgh ).  This means that
 a globed ship had best stay away from a planet.  A slight change in
 depth to a gravity well could spell doom.

This would make black globes next to useless against incoming missiles.
Think of the KE that a missile that has been accelerating for 20 minutes
at 6Gs.  I would assume that 6Gs would have to be a minimum for a missile
and 20 minutes is a combat round!  A standard HE missile has a weight of
0.05 Tonnes which is 50 kgs.  g = 9.8 m/s/s so 6G = 58.8
for a time of 20*60=1200 seconds.

v = v0 + a.t = 0 + 9.8 * 1200 = 70600m/s

            2                                                    11
ke = 0.5 m v  = 0.5 * 50 * 4984360000 = 124609000000 = 1.246 * 10   J

Is that a big number or what!  Splat goes one space ship!

Just think what a small suicide fighter would be capable of (the perfect
place to use a robot pilot ---- while attacking black globe shielded
ships).


Worse, since mass is energy (E=mc^2), wouldn\'t the globe have to absorbe
the energy of a mass placed in contact with it?

I hope I got the above figures correct, I never was much good at physics.
I\'m sure somebody on the list will correct me when I\'m wrong.

Does the theory about gravitons apply in Traveller?  If so, how\'s this for
a perpetual motion machine?

1. Vehicle with black globe sits at a certain height.  Globe is off.  Vehicle
falls.
2. Vehicle switches on its globe.  Vehicle now takes off as described above,
and also absorbs the gravitons.
3. Vehicle shuts off globe, uses some of the energy absorbed to move along
back to its previous position, and beams the rest at the planet.
4. Go to 1.

How far away must it stay from the planet?  The further it gets away,
the more potential energy it gains, as h in the above equation gets
bigger.  Meanwhile, it\'s losing potential energy as it gets closer to
something else, e.g. a star 2 parsecs away.

Now the question comes up about what happens to gravity with black globes
and what are the effects?

I propose that a black globe reduces any factor of "g" (the gravitational
constant) from external bodies, to zero.  This makes any black globe
maintain its proper motion with respect to the universe at large.  Thus this
Vargr black globe would not be staying in Tuglikki 0904 but would be
travelling at some velocity (probably large) depending on the proper motion
of the star system it is in, depending on the proper motion of the galaxy,
and depending on the proper motion of the galactic cluster!

So the question you have to ask yourselves is, "Is it heading my way and
can I sell my property before it gets here or someone else finds out!!!"

And I would have to disagree with the designers on this point.  Potential
energy would have no effect (or at least it would if one assumed my
previous point of reducing external gravitational constants to zero.)
Hence g=0 thus E (potential) = 0.  Now the kinetic energy traveling
through the atmosphere is another matter all together and I am in 
agreement...don\'t travel to a planet\'s surface with your black globe
on!

Bertil,

     I  have been considering your comments on the armoring of grav  vehicles 
since  yesterday, since I wanted to make some sort of coherent  response.   I 
think  one of the drawbacks of electronic communications is that we  tend  to 
type things without really thinking about them.

     The  answer to the armoring question depends very much on what style  of 
fighting  you  would anticipate.  Are grav vehicles going to hug  the  ground 
most  of  the time, or get up and tangle in dogfights  like  current  fighter 
aircraft?   Are they going to have friends on either flank, with an enemy  to 
the front, or is their higher speed and ability to bypass obstacles going  to 
lead to a confused brawl spreading over many square miles (square  kilometers 
for you metric types)?  Are they going to hide in hull down positions  making 
it  reasonable to put extra armor on the turret?  How much threat  of  attack 
from above is there going to be?

     Obviously  all of these things are dynamic--your VRF gauss gun  overhead 
attack craft would probably lead to my designing a series of tanks with armor 
thick  enough to resist penetration from that threat (and maybe a  backup  PD 
laser turret), which would prompt you to field an attack craft with a  bigger 
gun, etc...

     I would expect that grav tanks would mostly hug the ground, reducing the 
number of angles that a threat could come from, and also reducing the need to 
carry  heavy  belly armor.  I expect that "Pop-up" tactics  as  described  in 
various  Traveller  materials would make top deck armor a priority.   I  also 
expect  that the battle would be more of a confused brawl than a nice  linear 
action, making it more reasonable to spread out my armor protection.  Below a 
certain  level, of course, I have no aspect which is protected from an  enemy 
tank  main gun, but also no aspect which is vulnerable to a  lighter  weapon.  
The  best  defense then is to concentrate on targeting and  SHOOT  FIRST.   I 
forget  now where I read an interesting commentary on the design of  the  M-1 
tank,  and how its armor layout no longer matched the non-linear battle  doc-
trine  that the U.S. Army was planning on using, that is, that the number  of 
shots  expected against the frontal armor did not justify carrying  all  that 
weight to protect only one side.

     It would not be unreasonable, though, to implement some sort of  differ-
ential armor scheme on the grounds that you could then make you own  doctrine 
to  match  your weapons systems.  In the absence of that, I think  you  could 
certainly try the 1.5x, .75x rule you suggest, and see how it works out.

     I\'m going to post this and your note to the net for wider discussion.

Many of you mentioned the possibility of overload with a black globe
contacting several solid objects, bumping into large planets, and so
on.  The ancients solved this problem by finding a way to create a
large, nearly infinite "energy sink."  This is mentioned in Adventure
13 from the old Traveller books.  I forgot what the title of the book
was, but I do remember how they made the "sink."  I\'m not giving any
more detail here so I don\'t spoil the adventure for somebody else, but

This debate has actually occured in real life recently, over the problems of
armoured vehicles vulnerability to overhead attack.  The conclusion was that
the next generation of vehicles was going to have a reduction in armour level
of more like 1/2 from side to top, with the side being nearly 2/3 of frontal
armour thickness.  This contrasts with current vehicles where the sides are
less than 1/2 of frontal thickness, and the top only about 1/10 of the frontal.

I would believe that with the transition/simplification from Striker to MT,
they (GDW) assumed that armour becomes nearly uniform (my relative thicknesses
above).  This will make things like overhead attack moot... 8-)

I hate to duck into these techno debates, but I have a few questions and/or
comments about this one involving the force field generator.

Ummm, proper motion relative to what frame of reference?  I vaguely
recall something from freshman physics that there is no universal frame
of reference...proper motion is always relative to _something_, and
I vaguely recall that this something can be picked arbitrarily.  There
shouldn\'t be a universe at large frame of reference then, right?
Maybe I\'m wrong -- one of you physics majors might want to jump in here.

[Right on, in Einsteinian General Relativity, all frames of reference
are valid - there is no "master" frame of reference.  The Universe\'s
rules apparently hold true for all observers, and there is no underlying
"grid" or "mesh" to the Universe that is special or fixed.  All events
in the Universe happen relative to each other.  Nonetheless, there are
several holes in EGR in Traveller.  Perhaps there is a non-relativistic
universal frame of reference available through a small oversight in
Einsteinian theory.  How else can you suspend your disbelief that matter
can travel faster than light? That reactionless thrusters can function?
How many holes and hand-waving you permit in your campaign is a function
of the Player\'s and Ref\'s ability to suspend their disbelief.  -- James]

Another question for physics majors...can the PE problem be gotten rid of
if the potential energy of a system involving a large body and a bg\'ed
ship is set at zero for the ship arbitrarily, and the PE is assigned to
the planet whose gravity the ship is falling into?  Then the ship would
just have to worry about the KE when the planet hit it, right?  (Sort
of thinking about the problem backwards.)  It\'s been a while, so I may
be missing something important here....but if that works, maybe it solves
the problems about approaching planets.

Personally, if I was using a globe, I\'d be worried about KE weapons --
but then, it might be a bad idea to have it on a high rate of flicker
if I thought they knew where I was.  Then again, if it can nail the
capacitors, it can probably get me anyway!

Two points.

First, that assumes that the target ship isn\'t moving.  If the target takes
any evasive action, some of that acceleration is going to be used up following
the target.  Second, if the target is moving towards the missile at the time of
impact, the target\'s velocity gets added to the missile\'s velocity; if the
target is moving away from the missile, the target\'s velocity gets subtracted.

However, these figures will probably do for an order of magnitude analysis.

The MT Referee\'s Manual says that 1 kilolitre of capacitors can absorb 650 MW
of energy.  Which just shows what a heap of junk the MT Referee\'s manual is -
MW is power, not energy.  If 1 kilolitre of capacitors can absorb energy equal
to 650 MW coming in for one full turn, i.e.
        6                 11
650 * 10 * 1200 = 7.8 * 10   J

then that kinetic energy will hardly be noticed.  It all depends on how long
that 1 kilolitre of capacitors can absorb 650 MW.

I would expect that many robots would be operating in a mixed human/robot

think that the amount of clutter in most people\'s offices/hallways/homes
would tend to keep robot speed low regardless of the theoretical maximum.

I know that if I had a wheeled Naasirka Office Mate here and I sent it to
the coffee maker for a cup of coffee it would have to dodge around a lot
of junk in the halls (not to mention the rest of the people).  There 
wouldn\'t be a chance of zipping down there at 100kph.  Similarly, a grav robot
should probably be considered to be using NOE speed for most building interiors
which would limit them to 40kph unless they had avionics.  Even then, I hate
to get bumped by a 100kph robot in the hall.

Anyway, if you sent these robots out on the roads or other trafficways by
themselves, they could then use their speed effectively.  I know using the
P/W calculations on wheeled/tracked/legged robots will tend to make them
fast because they need a lot (comparatively) of power to run peripherals,
but there is really no reason to design an indoor grav robot with more than
a nominal amount of excess thrust (.1G or so?).  So some of this could be
covered in the design section without having to do a separate table for them.

My reply:

This is a little weak in the "explanation" area.  It requires "two transmitted
broadcasts" but of what?  Also, the logic of "shedding neutrons" is faulted
from the standpoint that neutrons is what is _required_ to initiate a fission
reaction.  If the anti-node is strong enough to shed lots of neutrons faster
than it takes the fission reaction to occer, then I say you already have your
disintegrator weapon.

If the nodes were focused on the weapon, then any neutron emitted to try and
generate the fission reaction would more likely be absorbed (creating U-236
with a 2.3E7 year half-life (long)) or bounce off (billiard ball
interaction...or rather ping pong ball/bowling ball interaction).  The
increase in the nuclear force would tend to make fission less likely.  This
may be similar technology to what is used to make bonded-superdense material.

Also, if you had to aim the nodes (as it seems), wouldn\'t it be easier to have
a laser point defense system???

With all my nuclear damper bashing, I suppose I should come up with a
"reasonable" explanation for it...

Once you are on line, you can type the keyword: SCORPIA  and it will take you
to the Games Forum By Scorpia.  At that point, you can select the library files
and Traveller is Group 11 I belive.  Or you can go to the Games menu and look

The answer to that can be as simple as \'we don\'t know yet; Terra @ 1991 is
only TL8 (or is it 7?)\'. It isn\'t necessary to explain every little detail
of how something like this works; if we knew we\'d have invented it here on
this planet...

Yes, but the key words were \'low engery\'. The decrease in nuclear force
means that the neutrons don\'t need alot of energy to escape; presumably
their energy is low enough that they don\'t cause fission reactions.

Who said that the nodes were small? Maybe the \'transmissions\' are at a very
low frequency, and so have a large wavelength? It is quite possible to have
an anti-node kilometers or even hundreds of kilometers across; this makes
them easy to aim.


Sure wish we have nuclear dampers in 2300AD; those detonation lasers sure
are deadly!

In 2300AD he/she would have a high writing and perhaps imaging skill.  In
Traveller, you might have to wing it, but let\'s assume that we are talking
about a character with a high education and intelligence, and that we will
use those to modify any task die rolls.  Clearly, such a character could,
with the proper selection of other skills, be an asset to a group without

    'body' => 'I\'ve got two question which recent events in my MT campaign have prompted
me to solicit answers for.  Here they are.

1.  PGMP/FGMP ammo/powerpack costs.

  The Imperial Encyclopedia (pg. 72) says the PGMP, "consists of a power
  pack carried on the firer\'s back, the weapon itself, a flexible power
  link.  The power pack powers a laser ignition system in the weapon
  itself which heats hydrogen fuel to a plasma state.  The plasma is
  contained in the ignition chamber briefly and is then released through
  a magnetically focused field along the weapons\' barrel.  The high
  initial velocity plasma jet is 2 centimeters in diameter, but it
  begins to dissipate immediately.  EACH POWER PACK HAS SUFFICIENT
  ENERGY TO DISCHARGE 40 PLASMA BOLTS BEFORE RECHARGING IS NECCESSARY.
  Each pull of the trigger discharges one plasma bolt."  [The emphasis
  is mine.]

  In the next paragraph, it goes on to specifically address the PGMP-13
  (which leads one to believe that the earlier discussion was directed
  towards the PGMP-12).  It says, "THE POWER PACK IS A SMALL FUSION
  REACTOR WITH EFFECTIVELY UNLIMITED FUEL FOR COMBAT PURPOSES (BUT IT
  REQUIRES PERIODIC REFUELING AND ROUTINE MAINTENANCE EVERY 24-36 HOURS,
  DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF USE).  [Again, the emphasis is mine.]

  Then, on pg. 75, the following data is given:

        Weapon      TL             Price     Ammo Wt.  Ammo Price
        PGMP-12     12    ...     10,000 Cr.   3.0        2,500 Cr.
        PGMP-13     13    ...     65,000 Cr.   7.0       50,000 Cr.
        PGMP-14     14    ...    100,000 Cr.   1.6      250,000 Cr.
        FGMP-14     14    ...    100,000 Cr.   9.0       65,000 Cr.
        FGMP-15     15    ...    400,000 Cr.   2.0      300,000 Cr.
        FGMP-16     16    ...    500,000 Cr.   1.0      375,000 Cr.

  Well, that\'s it.  I\'m totally confused.  The ammo wt. jumps all over
  the place.  And the price; does it refer to the hydrogen \'pellets\'
  in the gun that actually get zapped by the laser, or does it refer
  to the hydrogen fuel in the power pack?  Based on articles in both
  the TDR Physics SIG and the HIWG (History of the Imperium Working
  Group), the \'hydrogen\' in this case is some combination of deuterium
  and tritium (as opposed to the ol\' vanilla protium which fuels star-
  ship power plants).

  Sooooo, in the words of Ricky Ricardo, "Somebody \'splain dis to me,
  please?"

2.  Fuel duration & multiple jumps by a starship.

  I have a design for a modified Beowulf-class Free Trader that has
  jump-2 and maneuver-2.  It burns up 405 Kl. of fuel per jump and
  has a total fuel capacity of 859 Kl.  It also has a duration of
  30/90 days (whateverthehell that means) according to the design
  rules in the Refs. Manual.  If I understand the rules correctly,
  that means that it can make one jump (jump-1 or jump-2, it doesn\'t
  matter \'cause the both burn 405 kl. of fuel, thanks to those
  mysteriously vanishing \'jump governors\').  On the remaining 454
  Kl. of fuel, the ship can stay powered for 90 days in some sort
  of \'low-power mode (or \'8-hour work days\' as the Refs. Manual calls
  them).  This implies that the ship burns 5.0444 Kl. of fuel per day
  in that mode, right?

  Given those values, one can assume that for 2 weeks in jumpspace a
  ship would need 5.0444 x 14 days = 70.6222 Kl. of fuel, plus 405 x
  2 = 810 Kl. for the 2 jumps.  810 + 70.6222 = 880.622, which is only
  21.6222 Kl. more than my ship holds already.  By installing a small
  (say, 50 Kl.) auxillary tank in the cargo hold, this ship could
  ram-scoop a gas giant, jump-2 parsecs, and still have enough fuel
  to safely make a second emergency jump-2, right?

  I realize this completely ignores the other factors such as in-system
  transit time, etc.  It also doesn\'t address whether or not this low
  power consumption figure assumes the M-drives are going or not.
  However, I don\'t think the rules explicitly forbid this sort of
  action, do they?  All of this hinges on my understanding of the 30/90 
  duration figure, which is zip.  So somebody enlightening me, okay?

One possible interpretation of the 30/90 duration (mine :-)).

  The 90 day duration is max. duration if the M-drives are NEVER run.
  This gives use a life-support (et.al.) fuel usage of 5.0444 Kl./day.
  The 30 duration is max. duration if the M-drives are run CONSTANTLY.
  Since we know life support burns 5.0444 Kl./day, we know that life-
  support burns 151.3333 Kl. of fuel in 30 days.  This means that the
  remainder of the 454 Kl. (which is 302.6667 Kl.) is 30 days of con-
  sumption by the M-drives, which works out to 10.0889 Kl./day.  Now
  that we\'ve got these 2 figures:
        M-drives ---- 10.0889 Kl./day
        life support ----  5.0444 Kl./day
  We can derive per hour consumptions and determine right to the
  credit how much it will cost to refuel at that next starport! :-)

Well, speaking as something of an authority on Journalism in the Shattered
Imperium (:-)), I think it SHOULD be role-played out, at least if the
agency/individual the news article is being filed with is anything other
than the local X-boat office ("Send this to Regina, and make it snappy!")

When I originally created and ran Adrian Bishop (before the TML PBEM was
born), he was the focal character in the group.  My Ref. (Hi, Eric!) didn\'t
seem to have any touble either building potential new-related adventures,
or role-playing Stanley, my tight-fisted managing editor ("Four THOUSAND
credits for a riddled Holo-cam?!?  Why couldn\'t YOU just get shot, instead
of the equipment?")  When Adrian filed a story, it was always one of those
multi-month long expose\'s, usually involving the military, government, or
big business (well, who else is there?).  The pay-offs would range anywhere
from 20,000 to 50,000 Cr., with an additional fee for my "research staff
on retainer" (which referred to the rest of the party; if there\'s one
thing Adrian is good at, it\'s padding an expense account!).

However, if you really don\'t want to role-play the journalists work (which
seems like a terrible loss of adventure potential), then here are the
kinds of skills Adrian has (and which any good MT Journalist character
should have):
  Interview - Need I say more.
  Linguistics - At least one other major language: Vilani, Vargr(Gvegh or
                Aekhu), or Aslan (one of the Spinward dialects) would all
                be good choices if you operated in Corridor, Deneb, or the
                Marches.
  Communications - This skill covers the use of recording devices (Holo-cams,
                voice recorders, editors) and the occasional broadcast unit.
                I include editing because when an independent sells to a
                news service, the buyer usually wants both a finished story
                AND the raw footage.  That way, they can re-do portions they
                don\'t like, but the rest of the work is done for them.  If
                you just walk in with Mega-hours of raw holo-stock, all
                they\'ll offer you is the door.
  Streetwise - You never have too many "in\'s" with the underworld.
  Liaison - Just in case you get the opportunity to interview Archduke Norris.
                (Bare in mind that Liaison functions as Streetwise -1 and
                Admin -1, so a high Liaison skill will cover these other
                two skills just fine.)

As for determining how much a story should be worth, I\'d figure out how
much money you want the character to end up with, and reverse-calculate
the fee (:-)).  Seriously, 15,000 - 20,000 Cr./per month spent on story
is probably not out of line for a top-flight investigative free-lance
journalist.  If he/she is allowed expenses, then reduce the number a bit.
If the story is about a spectacular incident (Refs. option), consider
raising the fee by D6 * 20%.  Here\'s the sort of task roll you might use.

        To sell an article to a periodical or news service:
        Difficult, Interview+Liaison, Int, 20 min (uncertain, safe)
        Referee: On normal failure, the publisher offers only 50%
        of the normal fee.  On an exceptional failure, the article
        is rejected outright.  On exceptional success, the fee is
        5% higher per point in excess of the normal success minimum.

But it\'s soooo much more fun to role-play!  There\'s nothing in this
whole, role-playing world better than running a alcoholic, womanizing,
drug-abusing, chain-smoking reporter hot on the trail of some dirt.
Especially if it\'s guaranteed to ruin somebody else\'s life!

                        "Fletch, I\'d better have something to print
                         by 8 AM tomorrow morning!"
                        "Here Murray, [flips him off] print this."

     Wait a minute...  I don\'t think so.  I always interpreted that to
mean "30 days, or 90 eight-hour shifts, whichever you prefer."  Meaning
that you use up the power plant fuel in 30 days, no more, no less, no
ups, no extras.  After all, the damn\' thing has to run continuously
while the ship\'s in space.  I don\'t see any way around that, unless you
want to breathe stale air while floating in darkness (not *my* idea of
a fun recreational activity).

     I\'ve also never liked the idea that the jump drive burns the same
amount of fuel, no matter what distance.  If you only go half the rated
max distance of your drive, you should only burn half your fuel.  But
that\'s just my prejudice...  ;-)

speedlimit for pedestrian traffic, probably around 10-20kph as an absolute
maximum.

  Maximum *possible* speed indoors would probably be determined with dexterity
in mind for the non-thrust driven robots.

  The big trouble is that even now, I had divided the power output by 28.
Otherwise, even the legged robots would have had speeds reduced only by
streamlining.

  There is two things though, that requires high thrust in grav-robots. The
first is if they are supposed to work on different worlds. I don\'t think that a
robot with 0.1 excess gees at one standard gravity could even lift it\'s own
weight on a UWP size A world. The second is that for some robots (like the XT-3)
a large thrust is needed to enable it to carry heavy parts and machinery.
Actually I feel that the thrust of the XT-3 is inadequate, since the thrust
cannot support as much weight as the robot can possibly lift (about 600kg).

As written the second duration number 30/*90* is functionally meaningless for
starships.  For vehicles it makes sense because most vehicles are not intended 
to be operated for more than 8 hrs a day due to driver fatigue.  So to pull an
example out of the hat, a long distance truck with a duration of 2/6 could be
driven across the U.S. for 6 8 hour shifts before requiring refueling, assuming
that it is sitting in a parking lot, shut off, for the remaining time.  A 
starship can\'t really be parked with the engine turned off very often (except
at a starport, and even then in the Shattered Imperium I\'d have it running 
at low power to allow a warm start if I needed it.)  

A recent issue of Traveller\'s Digest legitimized the concept of running your
starship at fractional power, with a proportional fractional fuel consumption.
If you look at any of my high-energy weapon large starship designs (I don\'t
think the dropship counts), you\'ll find a note about how much power is required
in combat versus how much is required in "running mode".  *I* usually calculate
the running power as full maneuver power plus full life support power.  If you
wanted to run your ship at the absolute minimum power, I\'d call it the amount
needed for full life support power, most of the time...but even that could 
be reduced if you were willing to cut the grav plates (you wouldn\'t need
inertial compensators if you weren\'t accelerating).  Unless you precalculate
these things in the design phase, or maintain your complete design sheets,
figuring these things out on the fly will be annoying.  

Does anyone else have thoughts on how much power you really require in jump
space?  Do you need the inertial compensators?  Any maneuver power??  I would
not think so.

When Mark was running Adrian in my universe,  I had to organize
scenarios with other players in mind, lest they be dominated by Mark\'s

had to be a degree of newsworthiness in them, so that Adrian could feed
the masses (and his pocketbook).

It also helps to have an image of what INN (the Imperium News

agency is.  How I picture it is thousands of independent news tapers
following their journalistic instincts handled by managers with a strong
sense of monetary control and an idea of what would sell.  In addition,
INN provides technical support and distribution.  I picture technical
support being everything from editing services to mercenaries.  INN rates
as just below a megacorp in my campaign.

The task rolls that Mark layed out were pretty accurate on how Adrian
sold his stories (except I was making the rolls).  With role-playing one has
to also include a BS modifier for the player\'s ability to sell the story to his

Adrian, of course, represents the top of the line independent news-taper,

I don\'t recall what the rulebook says about multiple jumps etc and the
govenor problem, but if you notice the fuel required for a jump is
proportional to the numer of jump units required for the drive. (I think
62.5klxnumber of jump units). But examine the following table (from memory):

	Jump #		1  2  3  4  5  6
	100T Jump Units 2  3  4  5  6  7
	
You\'ll note that it doesn\'t take twice as much fuel to go jump 2 as it does
to go jump 1 (unlike the old traveller rules). This is the main reason
why a jump-2 ship can\'t go J-1 and J-1. In my campaign I allow the players
to use their fuel in Jump Fuel Units (JFU). I rate their tanks in JFU, and
then they can subtract the amount they use for a jump [That is J-n requires
n+1 JFU]. Thus your free trader with 810 kl of tanks would have 6 JFU, which
is enough for 2xJ-2 or 3xJ-1. I presume that the designers didn\'t want to
confuse the players with this sort of partial fuel useage.

The 30/90 duration has no deep understanding. The power plant is computed
for the requirements of the ship, and you provide fuel for n days of 
continuous output at 100% power. The 3xn duration assumes that the ship
is not being manned around the clock, but only 8 hours per day.

There are two points to be made here, first the only states that the
power plant can have (at least those mentioned in the rules) is 100%, idle
and off. The presence of the idle state (mentioned with vehicle plants, I 
belive in the skills section) is so that you don\'t have to cold start the
engine every time. However I would think that if the plant can run at idle
(ie. keep the fusion reaction, and magnetic bottle or whatever) it can run
at any intermediate state.

The longer duration assumes 8 hours of 100% output followed by 16 hours of
idle. This would mean no life support, sensors, computer and especially
gravity. However during those 8 hours of activity everyhting is not running
so things can average out. I for one am not satisifed with this type of
explanation however.

This is similar to the way I would implement it. However you are
still assuming that the power plant can be set to variable output. One
way to avoid making this assumption is to install multiple power plants
as long as each is > 14kl (252Mw at tech 15?) there is no degridation
of power output. (This of course flaunts the only one ship system at
a time in operation rule).

Consider the power consuming devices:
	Maneuver (high)
	Agility (very high if present)
	avionics/communications/sensors (low)
	Weapons (very high)
	Screens (very high)
	Gravity/Compensators (high)
	life support (low)
	Computers (low)
	misc (berths, purifier) (low)
If you were to collect the correct things together and assign them their
own power plant then the fuel could last much longer by only using the
appropriate power plants at the correct time.
ie. Electonics, life sppt, misc, and Gravity on one plant, maneuver
on another, and weapons, screens and agility on a third (assuming they
meet the 14kl requirement). Then the fuel could be really conserved
by only running the life sppt et al, somewhat conserved when maneuvering
as well, and with the combat power plant you probably won\'t be concerned
with your fuel consumption. Note that it takes some time to bring a plant
up from idle, and a military ship that is trying to power up while under
attack would be to say the least under a disadvantage.

Consider the following fusion plants at TL 15. one 24kl, two 12kl, 
four 6kl and eight 3kl plants. Each set would draw the same amount of
fuel from the tanks, but consider the power output:
The 24kl  generates 1*24*6*3   = 432Mw
The 2x12kl generate 2*12*6*2   = 288Mw
the 4x6kl  generate 4* 6*6*1.5 = 216Mw
the 8x3kl  generate 8* 3*6*1   = 144Mw

Thus it probably won\'t save fuel substituting the smaller plants for a 
single large one. I don\'t know why the same fuel would generate such a 
conflicting power output, but perhaps the larger plant if run at 50% 
output would require 75% of the fuel or so. Ie the fuel to power output 
would not be linear, which is why they don\'t mention power level settings 
for the plants.

It also describes the new task "Journalism", which is detailed as follows:

"Journalism: This new skill is the ability to make good saleable material,

BTW, the "fame" mentioned here is something that a journalist character
accumulates during the course of character creation (like promotions for
a military character).  A high fame also provides a positive DM on mustering
out benefits.

Given the above "fee formula", I figure Adrian Bishop would rate about a
Journalism-5, even though he didn\'t actually have that specific skill.

True, true.  Just once, I wanted to look straight into my holo-cam, knowing
that all of the Imperium behind the claw was watching, and say, "Good evening.
I\'m Chevy Chase and you\'re not." :-)

Actually, I had as much fun running Adrian in Eric\'s campaign then as I\'m
having now, running him in Richard\'s PBEM game.  He met the rest of his
travelling companions during a little brush war on a mid-TL, semi-developed
backwater world out in the boonies.  He promptly dragged the entire group
to Capital, and then back out into the middle of a belter mining dispute.
He surrounded himself with disreputable merchant traders, amnesiac criminals,
disbarred, drug-abusing doctors, and other indispensable journalistic
sidekicks.  And you know something?  He hasn\'t changed at all.  He\'s still
the same old hyper, moody, chemically-dependent, social-climbing, cowardly,
strutting, muck-racking reporter today, and still likely to dive behind the
nearest crowd of women and children when the small-arms fire starts.  Than
is, as long as they don\'t block his holo-shots of the carnage. :-)

I always wondered about that; in my designs, I often solved the problem by
installing a second (backup) smaller plant, sized for the Life Support + 
Electronics + about Maneuver-1 power.  Thus, higher performance ships didn\'t
eat full fuel...  though this idea doesn\'t scale well to ships smaller than
200 tons.

and Re: Jump Fuel
	There was origionally (long long ago) in the ship operations rules
something that said that the ship used all its jump fuel no matter the range.
At some point, the concept of a Jump Govenor was introduced; something that let
the ship burn only the jump fuel for the actual distance being jumped... neither
of those concepts made it as far as MegaTraveller.  IMHO; there is now a tacit
assumption in the craft rules that a Jump Govenor is installed, and you will
only burn the fuel for the distance you are travelling.  Though it ought to
be brought up with Marc Miller one of these days...

As long as we\'re talking about fractional power output....

Apparently, it is possible to run a power plant at a greatly reduced
level.  In the MT Referee Manual, there is a sidebar somewhere that
mentions a maneouver invented by a Terran admiral involving tuning down
the output of his ship\'s fusion reactor.  Enemy vessels would detect
emissions indicating a smaller, less powerful ship than was actually
present, and close to attack.  The Terran ship would then put the plant
back on full power, and wreak havoc on the unsuspecting and outgunned
enemy.  The great risk of this tactic was that the attempt *quickly*
change the power output of the fusion reactor ran the risk of making
it dummy out and either shut down or remain at the decreased level,
turning the tables on the unfortunate Terrans.  When it worked, it
was a devastating tactic, however.

I think that the roll required was on the order of a hasty warm restart
attempt in terms of the task used.

Howdy,

I just bought a copy of the Flaming Eye Campaign Sourcebook.  I haven\'t had
time to read it in detail yet but it looks pretty good.  There are actually
two compaigns in the Cinematic Nugget format.  The first is called Search and
Rescue.  It deals with the "...extraction of an Imperial intelligence agent
from the restored Vilani empire...".  The second campaign is called Gamgilebo
Incident and is about "...the search for two missing starships and their
crews...".  This book is designed to be used with the Vilani and Vargar
reference book and you must have that book available to use these campaignes
(or so it says).

The book also include the floor plans (but as far as I can tell no write up)
for a Type A2 Far Trader, the Garu Class.  There are a number of World Data
Sheets like those in Knightfall as well.

I was in contact with the Weekend Warrior recently and asked about a copy of
Striker.  I was shocked to discover that the purchase price was $50.  It
is my understanding that some (most?) of Striker\'s systems (or at least the
ideas) went into MegaTraveller, is there really a reason for me to buy a copy
or is everything already in the MegaTraveller products I already own?  This 
goes beyond having a copy just for the sake of having a copy.  I want to 
know if there is enough stuff in Striker that is not in or different from
MT to justify (to my wife) buying something for $50.  Could those of you
with a copy of Striker (or those of you familiar with it) please comment.

I\'m at home on my PC so I don\'t have access to my copies of the recent posts
but I remember reading one in which someone asked about a program to generate
NPC\'s (I think).  I have one that you specifiy the number, race, and service
and it generate NPC\'s and prints them to the screen.  The race and/or the
service can be randomly selected by the program as well.  Now for the 
strings...I am not (yet) a C programmer and this program was written to help
me learn C.  As far as I can tell it works and works correctly but I will
not vouch for the appearence of the code or its style.  I am certain there
are better ways to implement things but as I said it works and I am learning
C so my goals are being met.  The next problem is there are races not in
standard Traveller (my own basically) but these can easily be removed.  The
last problem is not all of the 18(?) possible services are installed.  At the
moment I think it does Army, Navy, Marines, Scouts, Belter, Pirate, Rogue,
and Merchant.  The program was written so that the extra services can be
easily added, I just haven\'t had time lately to work on it.  If depite all
this anyone is interested in obtaining a copy of what I have, I\'d be happy
to send it to you.

Later,
TLH

The TDR lists are still active and running-- we have a new Medical
skill cascade system for people who wonder why veteranarians and
neuropsychopharmacologists both have Medical-3 and nothing else. Work
is proceeding (slowly) on a new Trade system, the combat system is
in revision and alternatives are being presented, we have a trial 
ship-combat system waiting to be playtested, and the new ship design
system will include power plants that make sense, maneuver drives
and antigrav units that make sense (Thruster plates may well take a

Perhaps you physics types can point out the error of my ways?  The thing that\'s
been bugging me concerns the underlined comment above...

I seem to recall hearing (or reading) that General Relativity doesn\'t forbid
matter moving at FTL speeds, it only forbids matter travelling AT the speed of
light, since this would involve infinite mass.  Yes or no?

If true, then there may be the equivalent of a tunnelling diode for velocity (a
tunnelling diode, as I understand it, lets electrons \'tunnel\' through a barrier
essentially they "stop" existing on one side and "start" existing on the other)
This would let your ship "stop" existing at c-x meters/sec and "start" existing
at c+x m/s.  Or is this wrong also?

- - - ----
The following discussion is excerpted from The Physics of Tunnelling Velocities
                                           
by Paul Baughman,  J-O-A-T

   ...

Applying energy to the Zuchai crystal web in the hull produces an oscillating,
structured energy field of the Zotorr type.  This oscillation engages the
Tunnelling Velocity Effect (TVE) which transposes the STL velocity of the
enclosed object (the ship) to the FTL velocity corresponding to one of the
prime energy states.

The Prime Energy States (PES) are superluminal energy states similar to the
electron energy states of classical Quantum Mechanics.  An object in Hyperspace
can only occupy one of these energy states.  If an amount of energy is supplied
to the Zuchai web that does not corespond exactly to one of the PES, then the
next lowest PES is entered and the excess energy is radiated to the
surroundings as gravitons.

Only six Prime Energy States are known to our present technology.  When energy
is applied corresponding to what should be the seventh, only the sixth state is
entered.  The most popular theory advanced to date is that successive energy
states do not follow the same distribution curve for energy level.  That is,
while the first six states follow a linear distribution curve, the next states
may follow a parabolic or other curve.  It must be emphasized that currently
there is no evidence either for or against this theory.  Many researchers have
attempted to find the next PES (popularly known as jump-7), but no matter how
much energy is supplied (and some truly staggering amounts have been tried)
only PES levels one through six have been identified.

As a footnote to this discussion, in 1093 Dr. Hans Zarkov of the University of
Regina, was following a promising line of research when he vanished with his
leased research ship, _Daisy_May_ .  Eyewitness accounts following the
investigation, claimed that Dr. Zarkov loaded several crates of equipment on
board his ship, then spent five days aboard before requesting clearance for a
test flight and jumping out-system.  The Daisy May and Dr. Zarkov were never
seen again.  The conclusion made by the investigating committee was that Dr.
Zarkov attempted to put his theories into action and destroyed himself and his
ship in the process.  Unfortunately, the notes Dr. Zarkov left behind were
only of the most general in nature.  As a consequence, no one really knows
whether Dr. Zarkov broke the jump-6 barrier or not.

I haven\'t bought a copy yet, but have glanced at it briefly-- there is
one very interesting artistic "slip" that may or may not be deliberate.
One of the Vargr characters is consistently drawn much larger than a
normal human, to say nothing of a normal Vargr... unusual for the species,
and (before the recent publication of V+V) I would have even said impossible.

The obvious explanation is that this Vargr is of the massive Urzaeng breed,
but that begs the question: which came first, the mention of the Urzaeng
in the V+V book or the art in the Flaming Eye? Don\'t get me wrong, I think
that the representation of the varied subspecies is really wonderful, but
I just had this perverse vision of a conversation at DGP....

"Look at these great art layouts for the Flaming Eye book!"

"Yeah, this is really good stuff-- urk! Look at the size of that Vargr! We
can\'t use these-- the continuity hounds would eat us alive!"

"Oh, damn, you\'re right-- Hey, I just had a thought! Why not add a line about
a really rare breed of giant Vargr to the V+V book before it goes to press?"

Nah. Too silly. Also out of line with my view of DGP, which is of a very
meticulous and careful bunch of people who dislike obfuscation (except where
justifying thruster plates and constant fuel consumption irrespective of
Jump distance). |->

at this point, and I may have more as I go along.  Let me start with the
statement that I happen to like the system summary sheets, and the total
amount of background data is probably worth the price of the book.

The book claims, however, to be two "campaigns".  I\'m not sure if we have ever
settled on definitions of "adventure" and "campaign" but I tend to think that
both of these "campaigns" could be played through in two or three sittings, as
long as the gm didn\'t throw in a lot of unincluded material.  That makes them
rather less than a "campaign" in my book.  Just a quibble...

Metlay complained about the cinematic nugget format of Knightfall a while 
back, and with good justification.  I choked a little, though, when I came
across the following, drawn from the summary to start Campaign 2 for players
who have been through Campaign 1:

<The players are asked to deliver a package for a man on Vhodan, for a payment
of Cr100,000. The gm is asked to read this to the players:>

That was some time ago.  The trip from Lakarda to Vhodan was no less exciting
than the entire rescue mission.  Between the Vilani patrols and the Vargr
corsairs, it is a wonder you arrived at Vhodan with your message intact.  
Getting the damage inflicted on your ship by the growler pirates ate up all
but Cr2000 of your ready cash, leaving you hunting for a high-paying job,
before your berthing fees drain your meager account.

In other words, friends, you are asked to rip off the players and damage their
ship--OFFSTAGE. If I was in a game and the gm tried that on me, I\'d be looking
for a new gm.  That is the sort of major plot element that I would rather play
out.  I relize that you could always do so, but it disturbs me to see a "pro"
adventure put that kind of thing in.  Any comments?

map display interface. The main turret carries the 100MW pulse laser, with a 
smaller turret mounted on top of it with the 20MW PD pulse laser.  The PA-10 
plasma guns are in side sponsons, and cannot be fired within 5 degrees of 
straight forward or straight back.

Commodore Perkins class Fleet Escort TL10

     The Commodore Perkins class of fleet escorts was built locally by the 
Planetary Navy of Horosho.  Faced with the usual problems of a low stellar 
tech level local navy, the Perkins are a compromise design.  Offensive power 
is provided by missiles and particle accelerators which tend to be less 
affected by enemy active defenses, and a substantial amount of armor is 
carried to keep the craft fighting as long as possible when overwhelmed by a 
higher tech level foe.  Similar vessels may be found in Vargr and Sword 
Worlds navies of appropriate tech level.
     No small craft weights or costs are included below, although provision 
for accomodation of flight crew is included.

Vigilant class System Defense Boat TL11

     The Vigilant class SDBs were built by a consortium of independent gov-
ernments on Tirem.  As a corrosive atmosphere planet, it was determined that 
in-atmosphere operations would be minimal, so a streamlined rather than an 
airframe hull was selected.  A laser main battery was considered desirable to 
avoid the necessity of missile resupply operations during a major invasion of 
the system.  Similar vessels may be found in planetary navies of this tech
level throughout the Imperium and beyond.

The 100 planetary diameter rules for safe jump distance has always 
seemed to be a rule of thumb requirement where the exact distance 
can be figured out, it is easier to be safe.

The Starship operators manual states that the 100 diameter is due 
to gravitational effects. "...the gravitational effects of nearby 
massive bodies must be considered. Within 10 diameters of a world 
or any massive body (even another starship), the proximity of the 
mass so distorts the fabric of space (and jumpspace) ...."

I decided to calculate the gravitational effects for some unusual
situations, massive stars, habitable worlds orbiting a gas giant, 
black holes, battleships, etc. and come up with safe jump distances.

Using the formula g=G*M/r^2, the gravity can be calculated at
any point. For earth at standard orbit it is 0.952g, at 10 diameters
0.00226g, and at 100 diameters 0.0000247g the earth is a size 8 world.
We could say that the safe limit is 0.00003 g, and 0.0025 g for a
"10 diameter" limit. This allows for a 10% error on the large planets
for differing densities, etc.

Let\'s look at the moon, a "typical?" size 2 world. The force of gravity
at 10 diameters is 0.00445g and at 100 0.00000487g. If in fact we use
the speculative values from above, a safe jump could be done at 40
diameters (gravity < 0.00003g). This is quite a variation for a 
thumbnail guide to be used in practice, in fact as the travel times are 
given in a chart in the imperial encyclopedia (pp. 92, 93), a new chart 
could be developed for worlds with reasonable densities giving more
accurate jump distances.

However considering the earth situation, traveling out to 100 diameters
(directly away from the sun), the ship is experiencing 0.0000247g from
the earth, however from the sun the pull is 0.0005987, or some 24 times
as powerful. Jumping from that point would be like jumping from a
distance of 20 diameters. One could argue that the sun\'s effects are
already calculated in but the variation in the jump distance due to
planetary size would be insignificant. In fact in order to get down to
0.00003g one would have to travel out to over 4.5 AU distance from the
sun. At 1g this would not take 6-8hours, but near 127, or over 5 days!

Either something is wrong with the 100 diameter limit, or the explanation
about gravity being the cause, though I cannot think of anyother reason.

Here\'s a thought: maybe safety has something to do with the curvature of
space-time (or whatever) ... so that being under 0.0005G from the sun
doesn\'t make that much difference. This idea would take some mathematics
to check out -- it\'s relatively early in the AM here so I haven\'t checked
it out. If I\'m wrong, no doubt somebody will flame me (bear in mind I\'m a
retired civil engineer, not a mathematician :-)

that you *MUST* have trade."

"If interstellar trade in impractical, there is no economic connection between

I haven\'t been saying there will *not* be trade.  I have been saying that only
certain things will be traded to certain places.  Things that are available

"<description of economics of trading metalworking tool kits>"

Unfortunately I don\'t have a set of books at work, so I can\'t *really* analyze
this.  But basically this does need to be worked out for every type of cargo.
I\'d guess that packing is about a third of the volume.  For bulk cargo, packing
is negligable.

Tool Kit Cost:   1500cr
Tool Kit Volume:   50l
Tool Kits/Ton:    186 = 14000/50 * 2/3
Tool Kit/Ton:     279Kcr
Shipping Cost:   5.37/kit = 1000cr?/186
Total cost/Kit   1510cr

Obviously shipping tool kits is not going to be a problem, but then I didn\'t
think that it would be.  I expect that metal tool kits are relatively high tech
devices with various alloys.  Note, though that this cost is for one jump worth
of shipping.  Hopefully this kit wouldn\'t get shipping at increasing cost
across more then one subsector.

The bigger question about this tool kit is, where is it going to be
manufactured?  My point is that it will be manufactured where the materials
required to manufacture it are located.  The cost of shipping final products is
negligable, when a ton of them costs 279Kcr, but what about raw materals
including food, water, air, where the cost might be 100cr per ton to 1000cr per
ton on up to 1Kcr per ton.  These are the things that I am saying will not
likely be shipped.

Mark Cook, why don\'t you put me on the Trade and Commerce SIG too?

********** MEGATRAVELLER II: 
			QUEST FOR THE ANCIENTS **********                       
                        
        
HUNT VALLEY, MD _ Paragon Software, the innovative game designers 
of the hit MEGATRAVELLER I, has announced the April release of 
MEGATRAVELLER II: QUEST FOR THE ANCIENTS, distributed and marketed 
by MicroProse Software, Inc.

MEGATRAVELLER II is based on the popular Game Designers\' Workshop 
role-playing system, the most successful science-fiction 
role-playing game on the market, and is also a sequel to 
MEGATRAVELLER I, Dragon Magazine\'s Computer Game of the Year for 
1990. Marc Miller, creator of the MegaTraveller universe and 
role-playing genius, has produced the game\'s main scenario, 
concept and design. "The invaluable insight Marc Miller has given 
us into the nature of role-playing games will make this game 
extremely exciting to play," said Paragon President Mark Seremet.
Players face a global crisis on the desert planet Rhylanor, one 
of the thriving economic centers of the Spinward Marches. A 
mysterious structure, believed to have been built 300,000 years 
ago, has begun spewing life-threatening toxins. The only hope 
seems to lie in finding the reputed designer of the site, the 
fabled Ancient leader, Grandfather, who has remained elusive for 
thousands of years. Players will face the ultimate test of 
resourcefulness, skill and courage.

MEGATRAVELLER II features design improvements, interface 
enhancements and additional features not found in the first 
MEGATRAVELLER game. Over 100 detailed worlds will be explorable 
with at least half of a million square miles per planet containing 
starports, cities, terrain, animals and exciting people. Gamers 
will select from over ten different starship types for travel. 
Players will also be able to generate both human and Vargr 
(genetically altered canines) characters that will act and react 
intelligently based on their individual skills and will combat in 
a non-arcade style.

MEGATRAVELLER II will require 640K and will support CGA, EGA, 
Tandy, High Res EGA and MCGA graphics as well as AdLib, Roland, 
Covox and Sound Blaster sound boards. A mouse and joystick will be 
optional. Suggested retail price will be $59.95.

Paragon Software designs and markets a complete line of 
entertainment software for personal computers, including the 
recently released SPACE 1889. Its products are marketed by 
MicroProse Software, Inc. MEGATRAVELLER II will be released for 
IBM-PC and Tandy computers. IBM and Tandy are registered 
trademarks of International Business Machines and Tandy

Sorry about this being somewhat non-Traveller...

On the last invoice I received from DGP I noticed two things:
  First, they moved to Woodburn, OR,
  Second, the advertise their new game A.I. (tm). "Not technology

First, my comment to Mark...

Boy, you sure do get some mileage on TML from my comments during the game! :-)

Second...

Rob the Vehicle Maven writes, on the subject of duration:

I agree totally and I will probably leave it off any of my starship designs. 
One can just as easily multiply the duration in days by three to get eight
hour shifts or even four for six hour shifts.

I agree.  In general only two modes need normally be figured.  The first being
for times when the ship is in jump.  Basically, computer, life support and
grav plates will be taking your fuel.  The second time is coming out of jump
and going to a planet.  This could really be assuming full power since the
maneuver drive would be going at full output to get to the destination at the
minimum time interval.  Though I would be tempted to ignore the fuel used by
idling the power plant since during the time of travel to the planet the
weapon systems are not using power (unless combat is enjoined of course.)  I
would tend to call these two items a wash.

If anything, if I were to design a submarine with a nuclear power plant, the
rules would lead you to think the thing was operating at 100% power the whole
time if it was not shutdown or idled.  Bull.  They have a full range of
operational power.  They are load-following plants and any engineer that
designed a fusion plant without load following capability isn\'t worth his
bodily hydrogen.  (Though large commercial plants made for generating power
for the general populace would not have to be load following.)

I also think that Dan Corrin\'s idea of Jump Fuel Units is also appropriate and
would reflect the fact that a larger jump drive would be required to travel a
farther distance.  The jump field would have to be stronger around the ship to
allow it to travel the greater distance.  In order to travel that greater
distance the jump drive would have to use more energy to generate the stronger
jump field.

>From the equation for gravitational effects that Dan was working with the

But who\'s to say that gravitions behave similar to quantum mechanics?  It may
be that the "size" of the graviton is dependent on the size of the "radiating"
body.  Then the explanation for the 100 diameter rule could read something
like this...

The 100 diameter rule is derived from the effects on the graviton density in
the vicinity of the jump vehicle.  The lower the graviton density the safer a
jump is.  Whereas the gravitational pull of a body is a function of both the
density of the graviton field _and_ the "size" or "energy" of the gravitons. 
Where the "size" or "energy" of the gravitons is dependent on the mass of the
"radiating" body.

But those with extreme theoretical physics backgrounds can probably shoot
holes in this.

Sure do, but if the GM doesn\'t like the rules for T&C and none of the players
are merchants, then no trade.  It is all transparent to the game at hand.  I\'m
in a game where I have a merchant and the whole bit about trading and cargo is
secondary to the game.  The trade aspect is just a way to keep my chip out of
hock and get into some adventures.  As a matter of fact, when it comes to
trade and commerce, we are tending to keep it out of the mainstream of the
game so it doesn\'t waste the other players\' time.  It can take too long. 
Also, I like playing a merchant but I don\'t want to be the ultimate
bookkeeper.  If I wanted to role-play an accountant, I would have gotten a
CPA in college and done it for real.

I consider that Traveller being set in ONE star system to be one of the
biggest mistakes by GDW.  The most successful role-playing game was not set in
a particular universe or continuum or what-have-you.  It is dangerous to think
that if a group is not playing in the Shattered Imperium, that they are not
playing Mega-Traveller.

Watch out.  This doesn\'t even hold true for the modern world.  Raw materials
are going to go where the labor is cheap.  Of course, there will be exceptions
due to tech level importation restrictions.  Also, I\'m sure that there can be
cases of importing the "coolies".  Depends what kind of "culture" you want.

Were you able to read the file at all, Andrew?  In the sunbane archive,
it\'s listed as "CORRIDOR.Z", which means it\'s a compressed UN*X file.

Running it through the uncompress utility should produce a ASCII textfile
with a header that looks like this:

20-28: UWP
   31: Bases

                .
                .
                .

.. and so on.  Those first 10 lines give the name of the sector and the
columns for each field of information.  I just downloaded the same file
to make sure that it hadn\'t gotten corrupted or something, and it looks
fine.  If you\'re having specific problems, send me a description of the
trouble you\'re having and maybe I can help.  Since I\'m responsible for
the files being there in the first place, I feel a bit obligated to make

I haven\'t got an extreme theoretical physics background, but I\'m going to
shoot at it anyway.

Graviton density, like any radiation density, is going to follow the 1/r^2
rule.  That\'s geometry, not extreme theoretical physics.  Surface area of a
sphere at radius r is proportional to r^2, so density of anything being
radiated (assuming a uniform density of radiation) is proportional to 1/r^2.
Gravity is proportional to 1/r^2, and to the mass of the body responsible for
the gravitational acceleration.  Whether that means it\'s putting out more
gravitons or higher energy gravitons, it has to follow that rule because
that\'s observed fact.  Gravitons, by the way, aren\'t observed fact, so for the
moment you can say what you like about them, as long as it doesn\'t contradict
what has been observed about gravity.

  (details deleted)



   The problem with your argument is that greater mass NECCESSARILY implies
greater flux (i.e. density) of gravitons in the vicinity of that mass. Thus
more massive bodies will always require greater distances to safe jump points
(all other things being equal...). The idea that the SIZE of the body matters
is rubbish. (It can be demostrated that a spherical mass distribution can be
treated as a point mass located at the center of the distribution, as long as
you remain outside the radius of the object.) Only mass, and the distance from
that mass, are of concern. That\'s why, as a physicist, I have always disliked
the idea of travelling "X" diameters to the jump point.



    With this in mind (a solar system composed entirely of effective point
masses), the problem is to develop a suitable mearure for the degree of local
space-time curvature due to gravitational influnces. Clearly, stars will have a
large influence ( with mass scales about 1E+5 to 1E+7 times larger than planet
a large influence (their mass scale is about 1E+5 to 1E+7 times larger than
planetary scales). In order to minimize their affect, curvature should fall
off very rapidly with distance. As an earlier article pointed out, a 1/r**2
fall-off (obtained by measuring gravitational FORCE) has some setbacks. It is
obvious that a 1/r fall-off (the result of measuring gravitational POTENTIAL)
would be even worse. Perhaps by defining a gravitational "CURVATURE" which
falls off as 1/R**3, we can get better results.



    What would such a fall-off do? It just might solve our problems. Look:
Mass is given by Density*(Radius**3). Thus a curvature like Mass/(Distance**3)
would be the same as:



       Curvature = Density/(RELATIVE Distance)**3

where relative distance is really just the number of DIAMETERS away.Sum this
expression over all bodies in the system (in practice, we need sum only over
stars and the planet or gas giant involved) to find the total curvature. If 
this sum is less than a critical value, jump is possible. If we ignore the 
affect of stars (say we are sufficiently far away) ,we can invert the equation
above to get the jump distance:



       N = (density/curvature constant)**0.333



This actually explains the 100 diameter rule: because curvature falls off as 
1/R**3, we can calculate jump distance as a constant distance relative to the
planetary diameter (although the diameter really  HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT)!
However, there is a small correction due to the density of the planet, but that
is no great problem.





For example consider a jump from Terra. (Density=1.00, Diam.=12,740 km).
Suppose than it exactly 100 diameters to the jump point (travelling straight
away from Terra and Sol). This implies a critical curvature constant (CCC)
of 1.2E-6 (Sol has density about .25 Terran, and 1 AU is about 108 solar
diameters). Or for a "10 diameter" jump, the CCC is 1E-3. For simplicity,
say the two CCC\'s are 1E-6 and 1E-3, respectively. Then risky jump is still
at 10 diameters (127,400 km), while safe jump is at 108 Terran diameters
(1,375,920 km). Note the coincidence: safe jump is 108 Terran diameters away
from Terra, and 108 SOLAR diameters from Sol. This is a true coincidence,
but I LIKE IT. Cosmic Synergy and Synchronicity and Fabulous Portents of the
Unknown....

    Any way the only trick left is to find out how far one must go in a 
given direction away from the planet in order to get curvature below the 
critical level. It will, of course vary with direction, if you want to pick
nits with me. There\'s two options: get a computer whiz to come up with a code
(I ALMOST did), or do what I did--stick with the 10/100 diameter rule ( you
can use the (density)**0.333 effect if you like), because otherwise you can
get bogged down in overly technical scientific mumbo-jumbo (like I do at the
office), rather than enjoy the role-playing (which I do in my SPARE time).

Any way. I\'ve vomited my two cents worth. That\'s why nobody likes us
physicists--we overkill science.

Dear fellow travellers,
  Here I am at the TAS and I seem to have lost my membership card... Seriously,
I\'m having BIG problems getting any of the archive packages at sunbane.engrg.
uwo.ca. I can get into the system and get any file I want BUT... I work on an I

BM CMS system and these files have been compressed using a compression routine
for a UNIX based system. Now before anyone flames me, I have been looking for a
way around this problem for two weeks. I\'m no wizard, but I\'m no rookie either.
I am asking you, my fellow travellers of this trouble universe, to aid me in
aquiring a program to use so that I may get the files to a CMS system, then dow
nload them to either a Mac or an IBM type machine.
   I am throwing myself at your mercy. Please help this poor soul.

pardon me while I reiterate...



If I understand the situation correctly, Traveller\'s 100 diameter distance from
a planet necessary for a safe jump, doesn\'t match the assumption that jumps
need to take place in a near zero gravity, below some threshold according to
the 1/r^2 attenuation of gravity as you move away from a gravity source.

First, the diameter of the planet doesn\'t matter, it\'s the total mass of the
planet, and the distance from the center of the gravity.

Second, the 1/r^2 attenuation comes up with a distance well under 100 diameters
for most planets, yet the threshold 1/r^2 attenuation of a star\'s gravity ends
up typically being well past the orbit of habitable planets.


So, someone proposes using a 1/r^3 attenuation for gravitic curvature?
Interesting, in BattleTech, the jump points are typically above the poles of
the star.



What about the points between the star and the planet where their gravity
cancels each other?  Would that be a viable jump point?

  Long in the making and even longer in the promise of making, finally here it
is. A somewhat novelized version of my current Traveller campaign. The campaign
started in 87 and still is going strong (although only one of the original 
characters still is alive). We only had the Traveller Book way back then
when we started and the most fearsome marines were armed with autorifles, but
I\'ve tried to make it somewhat up to date and resolve any conflicts with 
the official Traveller universe.



   If you like it, let me know, and if you dislike it, let me know what you
dislike. I am fairly certain that I\'ll be able to keep them comming with
some sort of regularity.

                 Voyage of the "Gamla Bettan" part One

                                Prologue:

Time: 023-1114  2340 hours Local

Location: Roup/Regina/Spinward Marches



Excerpt from Library Data: Roup/Regina (0407 C77A9A9-6): TAS Amber Zone. 
Waterworld situated on the express boat route from Regina to Efate. Its 
population of 3.4 billions is concentrated on the peaks of a few underwater 
mountains, the only dry land on the world. Real food (as opposed to the local 
fish and plankton concentrates) is highly prized by the population.



   The closed snowjeep plowed through the deep drifts and its headlights 
illuminated the descending snow-flakes. It\'s tracks spread a cloud-like 
mass of snow in a wide arc when the vehicle skidded around a corner and 
briefly visited the sidewalk, narrowly missing a pedestrian.
   "Don\'t worry about the civvies, trooper. We *do* have over-population here 
on Roup." Major Schmallhaussen said dryly. "But try to avoid that signpost over 
there, it might damage our sneep."
   With a lurch to the left the sneep avoided the obstacle. The driver pulled 
hard on the wheel as the vehicle almost lost its purchase in the deep snow. 
After a brief look to make sure that they were driving in the right direction, 
Major Schmallhaussen turned around to face those in the backseat.
   "Do you know which pad those hooligans are using, Mr Troop?" he asked a 
person dressed in thin but warm-looking parka, obviously an off-world item.
   "Pad fourteen or forty, I think." James P Troop answered, "It was hard to 
hear, the wind drowned out the sounds."
   "There are only 35 pads on the port, Major" the other person in the back 
interjected.
   "I know that, Corporal." Schmallhaussen cut him off. "There is no need for 
you to repeat truisms all the time".
   The sneep braked to a stop in the well-illuminated space in front of the 
marine guardpost at the starport gates. The guard came out of the building and 
the driver opened the side window. When the marine saw the military markings 
on the sneep and that the people inside were armed she said something into her 
headset and unslung her gauss before continuing.
   "I want to see some army ID\'s on you guys and your permits..."
   The Major pushed his ID out through the window before she could finish the 
sentence. "My name is Major Schmallhaussen, I\'m from the State Security and 
this is an emergency! A number of criminal hooligans are preparing to smuggle 
in a large consignment of illegal foodstuffs from a ship in this starport,
thereby undermining our society and the faith in our Great Leader and seriously
threatening the Roupian Way of Life. I demand that you open the gates at once!"
the marine cringed when she heard Schmallhaussens political monologue.
   "Well, Mr Propaganda, this port is Extraterritorial. You have no 
jurisdiction here."
   "As I said, this is an emergency. Those criminals might be unloading even as
we speak. And this man" he indicated Troop "is the only one that will recognize
them. Now, will you open the gate?"
   "Hang on a sec, I got to check with the Lieutenant about this." She turned 
away and began to speak into the headset. After a few long seconds the gate 
began to open. The marine pulled an small object out of a pocket of her CES, 
pressed a button and gave it to Schmallhaussen. "This is a marine communicator. 
I\'ve preset it to the guard tactical frequency. All you have to do is press the
big button on the side and speak."
   "We *do* have radios on Roup, you know" Schmallhaussen interjected. The 
marine pretended not to notice and continued "When you have found the ship, 
observe and call on the guards, No shooting, No arrests, No anything, just call
the Starport guards."
   "Of course, we don\'t want an diplomatic incident, do we?" Schmallhaussen 
answered ironically. he indicated to the driver to start. "Put the pedal to the
metal now, trooper. Follow the signs to Pad 14"
   The tracks spun and the sneep rapidly accelerated away, leaving the marine 
in a cloud of snow.
   The starport covered a large area and lacked illumination. Because of the 
almost complete lack of dry land on Roup it had been placed on Roups southern 
icecap. Now it was summer on the northern hemisphere, so the weather at 
Antarctica Starport was at its worst. But the placement had one big advantage. 
It made it very easy for the dictator of Roup and his security forces to 
control access to the starport.
  A few minutes later the sneep had found its way to Pad 14 and Schmallhaussen, 
Moeller and the Corporal disembarked. Troop looked up at the hull of the 
starship that loomed above them and read the name out loud "Free Trader \'Jason\'
from Regina. Yes, that was the name they mentioned."
   Schmallhaussen instructed the driver "Drive to the barracks, get the guards 
and take them here. We don\'t know if the criminals have means to detect 
transmissions so I won\'t use the communicator"
   The driver saluted and drove off. The sound of the engine faded quickly 
and soon only the wind could be heard. On the neighbouring pads the ships 
stood dark and silent, their crews undoubtedly sleeping. "Either in their warm 
staterooms or in the equally warm hotel rooms in Startown" the corporal 
thought. The major\'s voice pulled him back to reality. "Lets take a look at 
that ship", Schmallhaussen said, flipped off the safety from his SMG and began 
to advance towards the ship. "Follow me."
   They hadn\'t walked more than ten meters when Moller, who was in the rear, saw
something move behind the far landing-gear. He took a small penlight out of his
pocket and flashed it briefly two times towards the movements.
   From behind the landing-gear came a shot that hit number two, the corporal, 
who crumpled without a sound. The sound of the carbine was muffled by the wind 
and the snow. "Good shot Preben!" Troop said into a commdot that was hidden 
beneath his collar "For a scout, that is!". "The shot was easy enough" Preben 
Moeller answered. "The hard part was to locate number two. This snow plays hell 
with the IR! Perhaps I should\'ve put a round in each of you, just to be sure."
   Schmallhaussen bent down and searched for the corporals pulse. "Don\'t worry"
Troop told him as he took the corporal\'s SMG, "Preben used a tranq round."
   "I think he\'ll keep warm enough until the guards get here" said 
Schmallhaussen and held up the communicator, smiling. "This was a bonus. 
Why don\'t we use it?"
   While Preben Moeller and Troop fired shots and salvoes into the air in the 
background, Schmallhaussen yelled into the communicator about an ambush and 
demanded immediate reinforcements. He finished the transmission by placing the 
communicator in the snow and firing a burst from his SMG into it. They then 
proceeded to make footprints all around the ship and finally Schmallhaussen 
poured out blood from a bag he had nicked in the battalion hospital earlier 
in the evening.
   "Lets get out of here" Moeller said and pointed towards his air/raft "The 
marines will be here any minute now."
   "I\'m already here!" Troop said, grinning.
   "Yeah, But you\'re retired! By the way, not even a kid would be frightened 
by your stupid face."
   Troop snorted and added proudly "Once a Marine, always a Marine!" as he 
borded Moellers IISS-issue air/raft. "At last, a *real* vehicle. Not some 
stone-age \'sheep\'".
   "Sneep" Schmallhaussen corrected. "We call them sneeps. It\'s short for 
snow jeep"
   "Well whatever, You ain\'t gonna believe me Moeller, but that contraption
ran on tracks, *tracks*. And it was powered by real bloody *combustion engine*,
you know, the ones that burn good booze and spews smoke all around. Might as 
well have been a sled pulled by grazing herbivores. If we had those things in 
the IMC we\'d still be the Sylean Marine Corps, I tell you..."
   After a short flight at the lowest possible altitude and a long monologue 
from Troop at his best, in a loud voice, the three accomplices reached 
Moeller\'s ship.
   "Here she is: Gamla Bettan, The best scout ship behind the claw!" Preben 
said proudly.
   "It\'s certainly the oldest..." Troop blurted forth.
   "All it needs is some paint. Hurry up and get inside, The countdown is 
proceeding and Tower will call any minute now."
   Even in the airlock Schmallhaussen thought he smelled something, and when 
the cycle was finished and the inner iris opened the suspicion went to 
certainty. From the ships interior came a smell as from well used barracks, not
ventilated for weeks. "Phew! Smells like boot camp." Schmallhaussen turned 
towards Troop, "Is this because of the corps or a corpse?"
   "Verrrrry funny, dustkicker" Troop answered sourly.
   "We would be glad to have any dust to kick on Roup."
   "It\'s the air-regenerators" Preben called from the bridge."They are of the 
same type as the ones they use in the standard Type S." He turned his attention
to the controls. An irritated voice boomed forth from the commo panel.
   "Tower calling Gamla Bettan, Answer me, you deadhead\'s!"
   "Eh, Umm, Gamla Bettan here."
   "That\'s better, Where the hell have you been? We\'ve been trying to call you 
for at least ten minutes."
   "We had some, ehh, problems with the, ehh, powerplant, but it is fixed now."
   "You\'re sure it keeps together until orbit at least? Fishing ships out of 
the \'eitch to oh\' is a bloody nuisance."
   "Don\'t worry, It\'ll work"
   "Well then, where were I... Oh yeah, You are clear to start at 0005 hours 
local, that\'s in zero three minutes, The airspace is clear and the weather\'s on
your computer. When you have lift-off follow ascent-path nine, red marker, to 
low orbit at 140 clicks. You are logged for three complete orbits."
   "Can\'t you cut that a bit? I\'ve got a date on Feri."
   "Oh, you do eh, nudge, nudge, Ok then, the system is quiet tonight, scratch 
the orbit, go directly to Onehundred Dee, Do not, I repeat, do not pass \'GO\'"
   "Thanks Tower, Over \'n Out from Gamla Bettan."

   Back at the "Jason" the marines had found the tranqed corporal and the signs
of the "battle". They made a quick search of the area which turned up nothing 
so they turned their attention to the ship.
   After hailing it (to no avail since the crew was sleeping off the effects of
an evening in startown provided by a certain ex-marine by the name of Mr Troop) 
Lieutenant Gargishiid took the decision to blow the hatch.
   "Lieutenant! The ship is empty, sir!" sergeant Fulimara reported as he came 
out of the destroyed airlock, "there\'s neither contraband nor weapons in there,
and no trace of that major."
   The iridescent radiance of hot thruster-plates that pierced the thin blanket 
of falling snow answered the liutenant\'s unspoken question. As the glow 
accelerated upwards and disappeared into the low clouds he began yelling in 
the communicator "Tower! Tower! Gargishiid here! Stop that ship, I repeat, 
stop that ship! They have the major and the contraband on board!"
   He jumped into the air/raft and took off towards the tower.
   In the common room of the Gamla Bettan Schmallhaussen was searching for a 
refrigerator to raid.
   "By the way, I don\'t think I have introduced myself." He extended one hand, 
while the other was occupied opening various cupboards, hatches and lockers 
"Major Werner Schmallhaussen, State Security. Or perhaps I should say, Ex-State 
Security"
   "Force Commander James P Troop, Imperial Marine Corps". They shook hands 
"How are you related to Moeller?"
   "He\'s my cousin. My mother\'s sister managed to get off Roup, but had a few, 
ehh, misadventures, and ended up in the slums of Efate." Schmallhaussen finally 
found a fridge, or something that he suspected served the same purpose. "Yummy,
*Real* food!" He began to rifle through it. "Hey, what\'s this? Plankton Beef? 
Crustacean Candy?? Seaweed Bread??? That\'s not food, that\'s from Roup!"
   "Yeah, we had to stock new grub \'cause the old load was beginning to smell.
How much time to jump, Preben? I don\'t wanna get caught red-handed with a 
deserter onboard!" he yelled at the bridge.
   "I\'m not a deserter..." Werner began to protest. Moeller interrupted 
"We\'ve got 400 seconds more in the atmosphere. Then it\'ll take, lets see... 
4 hours 9 minutes and 26 seconds to Onehundred Dee, Fast enough?"
   "What? Have we started? I didn\'t notice anything." a perplexed Werner asked,
began looking for a window and continued "As I was going to say, I\'m not a 
deserter."
   "Riight" Troop grinned.
   "No really! I\'ll finish my last term of service today at 2400" he looked at 
his watch and smiled "Correction, I finished it ten minutes ago. But then, 
however, there was this little matter with a forced-reenlistment bill from 
Supreme HQ that\'s waiting in the mail, and there\'s no way I could have gotten 
an emigrant visa until after I had got that letter from SHQ. By the way, aren\'t 
there any windows on this thing?"
   "The only big one \'s on the bridge. How did you know you were going to get 
the letter? Hey, what do you think you\'re doing?" Troop almost fell over 
laughing when he saw that Werners fiddling with the controls of the iris to the
bridge only managed sealing it harder. "Press that other button. NOOOO! NOT 
THE RED ONE!!!" he practically jumped the few meters to the fore bulkhead and 
forcibly prevented Schmallhaussen from pressing the "Emergency Blow" button for
the iris valve.
   "OK, Schmallhaussen, listen very carefully now, cause I shall say this only 
once: Until Preben or I have thaught you all you need to know about the ship,
Don\'t...Touch...Anything! This" he indicated the valve "is called an iris valve.
Unless it opens by itself you open it by pressing this green button. Any 
questions?"
   "Yes, what are all the other buttons for?"
   "They\'re advanced options for expert users, don\'t touch them!"
With Werner in tow, Troop entered the bridge where Preben was engaged in an 
agitated discussion with Traffic Control. Werner immediately went to the main 
viewport and placed himself in front of Moeller.
   "No we are *not* going to turn around just because you have had some 
immense foul-up at the port." He held a hand over the mike and asked 
Schmallhaussen "Werner, do you mind? I\'d like to see were I am flying."
   "Oh, sorry"
   "According to paragraph forty-two in the Imperial..." Preben cut them short 
with "I know what that paragraph says, but it seems that you don\'t."
   "It says that *you* should land *here* *now* or we\'ll punch holes in your 
ship big enough to drive an AFV through!" another voice at Traffic Control 
shouted. It was Lieutenant Gargishiid who came bursting through the door 
followed by a blast of Roupian arctic weather.
   "Read that paragraph again guys. It clearly states that it is only 
applicable to civilian ships and this isn\'t a civilian ship. This is a ship of 
the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, and if you start punching holes in 
Imperial ships, there will rain marines out of the sky!"
   "Riiight ON!" Troop yelled.
   "You are under suspicion for one or two cases of kidnapping and murder. Both
are high justice crimes. I\'ll give you one chance of turning back, If you 
haven\'t complied within one minute we will give you what we have of surface-to-
space missiles!"
   "He sounds pissed," Werner said, "High justice crimes! Wasn\'t there any 
other way of getting me off Roup? Whose damn idea was this anyway?"
   "His!" Preben and Troop exclaimed in unison, pointing on each other.
   "No way Preben! It was your idea to use a false smuggling to lure him to the
starport!" Troop complained.
   "But it was your idea to mask it as a kidnapping! Any moron could have 
guessed that they wouldn\'t like a kidnapping! Just like that marine landing on 
Grevgh, Major fiasco from top to bottom!"
   "Eh, guys? One of the screens say \'Missile Alert\'" Schmallhaussen said. Even
if this was his first time on a spaceship he was sure that that meant trouble.
   "Who\'s ops do you call a fiasco? It was a perfectly executed vertical 
envelopment from orbit. Who would have guessed that the enemy had left six
months ago?"
   "LOOK AT THE BLOODY SCREENS!!!!" Werner yelled.
   "Shuddup, Werner, we are having an discussion!" Troop said.
   "What? What about them?" Werner cast a glance on the main screens "That\'s 
just a missile alert.....MISSILE ALERT???" He threw the ship into a sharp roll 
and dive and Werner, who had been looking out the window, suddenly turned very 
green.
   "What kind of antiship missiles do you have on Roup?" Troop asked worriedly.
   "Blurrp" Schmallhaussen answered as he tried to reconcile what his eyes told
him with what the rest of his senses said. "Big ones," he struggled with his 
stomach, "20 meters long passive radar homing missiles with proximity fusing 
and a 200kt warhead! Brand new stuff, we bought them just after the 5th FW."
   Preben swore silently and pushed Gamla Bettan even lower, down into the 
surface fog. "We have to get below the port\'s radar horizon, then they can\'t 
paint us with the designators." He pulled up suddenly when a big freighter 
appeared out of a fogbank. They heard the \'clang\' as Gamla Bettan struck a 
piece of rigging.
   "That was CLOSE!" Troop breathed.
   "Tell me about it! Where is that bloody missile?"
   Troop looked at the screens "Still after us, but too high, and we are losing
their signal."
   "I think they are designed to blow if they lose their signal..."
   "Preben! It\'s diving! Break Left!!"
   As the LSP Thunderstrike came hurtling down, Preben made a 90 degree turn 
and pushed the thrusterplates overload-meters way up into the red area. The 
missile did not change course to follow them. When it discovered that the 
target was gone, it triggered the warhead and disappeared in an expanding 
fireball of plasma while still high above the ocean.
   On Gamla Bettan even five centimeters of superdense hull didn\'t mute the 
sound of the explosion. Simultaneously, several status lights switched from 
green to red. Moeller fought with the controls and gradually most of the lights
began to revert to green.
   "No major damage, thank our lucky stars, and the starport is below the 
horizon now. Phew! That was a close one!" Preben let out a sigh as he let the 
ship continue forward in a slight climb. "I don\'t think we should go to Feri, 
though. Anybody got anything against jumping to Whanga, scooping, and continuing
to Efate? We got to get to Pixie before 070 to meet Miandwhypt and this way 
we\'ll get three weeks on Efate to install new air-regenerators."
   Troop and Werner didn\'t have any objections.
   "Do you think they\'ll put out a \'wanted\' on us, Troop?" Werner asked as they

jumpspace in no worse condition than usual, and at the intended place.

what would happen if a ship were heading out toward a safe jump point and 
suddenly another ship "appeared" (ie dropped out of jump) right in front of
it?  Certainly neither ship could stop nor maneuver in time to avoid the
impending collision.  It seems that there should be designated travel lanes
for outbound and incomming vessels as well as intra-system travel lanes for
boats doing interplanetary travelling.  The outbound lane would naturally
end at a jump zone (at a safe jump distance whatever that may be) and the
incomming lane would start at a safe jump exiting point.  All ships would
then be guided and controlled by the Space Traffic Controllers who would
have regions of control within the system (and no doubt a union).  Then for
most planets (those with Starports of types C or better at least) the Ref
could simply use the 100 diameter travel time as a lower bound on the time
to travel to the safe jump point.  (Ref: "Following the instructions given
you by the Regina Space Traffic Controllers you reach the safe jumping
point in 22 hours and 15 minutes.  You a 15th in line for jump." ;-) )
This doesn\'t solve the 10/100 problem because not all planets will have
controllers and if you are running for your life from the local authorities
(or some one else) you\'re unlikely to wait for permission to jump out system
let alone worry about reaching a safe jump point (Imperium Marine Force
Commander: "Add the following moving violations to the list of charges...")

Now on a totally different topic - Psionics.  Impromptu survey:

1) How many people use Psionics in their games?


2) Do you use standard Psionics or some modification (includes added or
   deleted skills or a different system altogether)

3) Is there any interest in some additional Psi skills?  I have some that
   I have been using and (so far) they haven\'t disrupted the game (read
   unbalanced) or dominated it.  They use standard MT Psi system (task
   rolls etc).  If anyone is interested in seeing them let me know.

4) Do any of you have any additional Psi skills that you could post or send
   to me?  Standard MT Psi system only please.  Also let me know if these
   have been "play tested".

Martin\'s bit of technospeak is a nifty way to slap a bandaid
justification on why jump drives follow the 100-diameter rule;
I\'m going to plug in some other numbers and work out if the
"coincidence" carries to other possible situations. Martin, have
you worked out the math for jumping away from, say, Jupiter? Or
Pluto? What about nearby moons of significant size?



Personally, though, I think I\'m going to mess with the 1/r**2
critical point a bit and see if I can come up with something

I\'ve just added 2 software packages to the traveller archive on Sunbane
(and updated a 3rd one), which should help ease the load on you busy
MT referees.

First, there\'s a C program called \'tnc\' (for \'trade-n-commerce\') which
automates the tedious trade & commerce drugery of randomly generating
freight, cargo, and passenger lists for your merchant players.  The
program is interactive and requires that you know the UWP for your
source and destination star systems, along with skill levels {Admin,
Streetwise, Broker, Liaison, & Steward} used by your players to modify
the results.  The program, along with documentation and a Makefile,
are in ~ftp/pub/traveller/software/trade.tar.

The second program is called namegen, and generates random words/names,
based on patterns formed by the contents of a template file.  If you
want a list of vaguely oriental-sounding names, just give a list from
your telephone book to namegen and it will crank out permutations based
on that list.  The source, along with documentation, a Makefile, and
an ~1200-line names template file, are in ~ftp/pub/traveller/software/
namegen.tar.



The third program is an updated version of the X-windows base subsector
viewer program, \'ssv\'.  This new version allows you to include political
borders in the datafiles, so that they don\'t have to be re-rendered by
hand each time you regenerate a subsector.  As a result, a \'-p\' parameter
has also been added, so that a printer file can be produced directly
without the subsector actually being displayed in a window.  The new
copy is located in ~ftp/pub/traveller/software/ssv.c.



Have fun with these things and please let me know about any defects
you find.  I can\'t fix \'em if I don\'t know about \'em! :-)

I agree that an Insystem Traffic Control organization would be a vital
necessity for a busy system, especially in two critically dangerous
areas -- everything within the approaches to the main world in the
system, and at the system\'s primary gas giant.  The chance of hitting
a ship leaving jump as one approaches a jump point is pretty small,
especially in low-traffic systems.  Space is big; I leave it to the
math people to figure out the area of a 100-diameter sphere about a
typical planet, and compare that to the area of a typical starship.
But near a gas giant, you have many ships swooping around at high speed,
who don\'t know much about the weather down there and are flying nearly
blind as they try to refuel.  Near a main world, traffic would be even
worse; communications sats, weather sats, power sats, restricted orbits
for military use, shuttles, stations, other ships landing and lifting,
suborbital or low orbital surface-to-surface flights, debris from
centuries of space travel, and so on.



Some low tech or remote planets wouldn\'t need much at all, though.  When
one ship visits a week and you don\'t have aircraft yet, the sky should
be pretty clear.



You\'d still want approach/departure routes to the jump points in 
controlled systems, so that the risk of collision would be reduced.
But once the ship crosses a certain point, it should be more or less
free to file whatever flight plan works best.  Besides, it lets the
government know where it should put its patrol cruisers so that it
can check out incoming ships for customs violations....



By the way, I do use psionics, but very sparingly.  It\'s more impressive
that way, and gives the game more of a high-tech feel when its not
overdone.  Having it can be useful for little surprises like Zhodani
commandoes teleporting onto the bridge.

In regards to the 100 diameter jump guide that I brought up:


First of all I will clarify the situation again.



	1) The whole point of the discussion is not to compe up with a
	   rationaliztion for the rules, rather to figure out an accurate
	   way to caluclate jump distance, so one can use it in unusual
	   circumstances. (eg. Jump distance from an unusually dense world,
	   gas giant, neutron star, or even a Battleship?)

	   

	2) The diameter is a approximation of the mass assuming that
	   all worlds have the same density. The small ones, usually
	   without an iron-nickel core are less dense however.

	   

	3) using 1/r^2 for a large planet (size 8-9, std. density), the
	   attraction of gravity at "100 diameters", is 1/20th the
	   gravity felt by the sun at 1 AU.

	   

The first suggestion proposed by Marty Jarrio, that we use a 1/r^3 method
is reasonable but is handwaving as "according to modern knowledge" gravity
follows a 1/r^2 method.



Calculating the gravity felt by the craft by summing gavity vectors of
significant bodies as Jim Baranski mentioned, has a nice appeal.


First, there will always be points regardless of the masses involved that
the net effect of gravity is less than a certain threshold, by adjusting
the threshold accoringly, we should be able to arrive at a value that will
make safe jumps best at around 100 diameters of the planet.



Second, There will be points, especially in a system with a large moon,
where a jump can be safely made much much closer to the planet, than 100
diameters. These would be small (perhaps even smaller than some ships),
and uncertain to use, which would limit their use. Ships could only use
these on an outbound leg as they would effectively be "islands" of
acceptable gravity level.



Third, in a talk given by Mark Miller, he always intended there to be a
limited (but large) number of points that a ship could jump from/to,
otherwise piracy couldn\'t exist (qv my other article in this digest).



The only bad part is that the points of low attraction between a habitable
planet and the sun, may also be "islands". Due to the fact that an incoming
ship precipitates out of jump space when it gets to "100 diameters" this
might make leaving quicker than arriving.

1) Travel zones would be a haven for pirates (assuming no overpowering
   military force in the system - but pirates assume that anyway :-)

   

2) All ships are supposed to jump from "rest". Ie. you accelerate half way
   to the jump point, and deccelerate the other half, so your ship is at
   "rest" w.r.t. the system you are in. In the case sited above the ship
   popping out would have a near zero velocity, and the one approaching
   near zeo. This should be an easy collision to avoid. A meteor, space
   junk, or comet however...

3) The chance of this happening would be close to zero. Considering the
   number of jump points available, and the sizes of the ships. Rember also
   that the ship would appear no closer than "100 diameters" of the outbound
   ship whatever distance that works out to...

Not all jump points are equal! Consider your ship with a zero velocity
w.r.t. the star coming out of jump. If you are travelling to a planet,
your would want to be conveniantly situated. ie. If you come out "100
diameters" behind the planet in its orbit, your would first have to accerate
up to its orbital velocity, and then try to close in the 100 diameters.
You would want to come out ahead of the planet in its orbit, thus the planet
will do most of the work by moving towards you at a good velocity.
This is not reflected in the travel times, however. (Unless you use the
pilot/navigator performance enhancement rules from the starship oerator\'s
guide). Even then I\'d have to check the math.



This next part is based on poor knowledge, but presumably, one would want to
travel retrograde (behind the planet in its orbit) in order to get to safe
jump distance quickly. Thus one would have all the arrivals on one side of the
planet, and the departures on the other, therefore "space lanes" of a sort,
and no collisions.



Now for the can of worms...(all references paraphrased)



The rules state that a ship entering jump space with a velocity, will retain
that velocity when exiting jump space. This is why all ships slow to zero
speed...

For stars with large proper motions jumpspace negates the effect.
Right! Which is it? Are velocities preserved, or are they not? If you assume
that they are normalized w.r.t. each sun, as I have done in the past, then
why, considering that you are moving to a point where gravity and thus
the effects of the sun are inconsequential on jumping, are they normalized?





I\'m sorry if I bother some people with these types of questions, but they
are not just looking for scientific explanations of game effects. They
are contridictions in the rules that should be explained in a semi-rational
manner. (actually people bothered by these questions probably won\'t have
read this far anyways).

  I agree with the second paragraph. There are numerous references that no 
matter how bad one misjumps, one cannot appear inside the 100 diameter sphere. 
Since it is possible to enter jump within this sphere, travel in jumpspace to 
another system or planet and appear at their 100 diameter sphere, I interpret 
this as meaning that when a ship cross the limit from the outside and in it will
be thrown out of jump.

  That would be a nasty surprise for anyone who tries to use the Lagrange points
for jumping. They reappear again just outside the same Lagrange point.



  One might argue that the ship should be immune to how normal space looks in a
line from jump entry to jump exit, and I agree with that, but ships are
obvioulsy affected by large bodies when they are "close to normal space" and 
about to exit jump, the same should be true if they\'ve just entered jumpspace.



  A problem with using Lagrange points and basing the 100 diameters on local
gravitation is that it opens the possibility of jumping from a antigrav area
on the surface. (Hmm, and if one mounts the jumpnet and jumpdrive on the 
outside of the ship, and leave them behind, one has got the jump equivalent
of a massdriver for transport purposes. Imagine the savings if one transported
ore between two systems using just *one* jumpdrive but several hundred 
unmanned hulls and with a launch rate of one per 5 minutes or something:)

  There were an article by him in JTAS about this. Jumpdrives got very limited.
essentially, for each jump-number you could jump to the 100d of the largest mass
in the system. So to jump directly to Earth, you\'d need jump-6.

  I don\'t imagine the system ever became a hit. Not only did it take lots of 
time for the characters to get to the main world if they had a standard ship
like a A or an S, but it required that you knew exactly how the system looked.



  It would also put a crimp on the very popular "jump to the middle of nothing"
to refuel or mothball a ship or whatever unless you happened to know the 
location of a suitable cometary nucleus above some minimum size.

  I don\'t think so, When you start to accelerate from the planet you already
have the velocity vector of the planet, so it won\'t make any difference if you 
accelerate ahead of it or retrograde.

  This is assuming that you have a drive that accelerate using normal physics.
If you use thrusters all bets are off:)

  Perhaps the solution to this and the 100diameter problem is that it isn\'t 
gravitation that is the deciding factor, and that the unknown deciding factor
(that most physicists ascribe to the properties of jumpspace) decrease with 
1/r^3, and that velocities *are* normalized by the gravitation of the local
star (which decrease with 1/r^2)

On the other hand, channeling the traffic into a few specified regions means
the density of ships increases drastically in those regions.  Most of the
system could be left without specified routes.  Space Traffic Control would
either do nothing, relying on ships\' sensors and pilots to avoid collisions,
or at most keep a watch out, and warn any pilot whose ship was approaching
another ship, a restricted area, or any other source of danger.  The main
places where things would really need to be regulated would be the regions
in which traffic got denser anyway, i.e. near the starport and perhaps near
the gas giant.  (Although a gas giant is after all a planet, and a pretty big
one at that - unless there are 10^(my bank balance) ships all trying to compete
for refuelling, there should be little risk of collision there.)  Near the
starport, ships would be ordered into parking orbits until the approach to the
starport was clear.  Many ships simply wouldn\'t bother landing, and simply use
either their own small craft or shuttles provided by the starport.

	As for collisions while coming out of jump, I\'ve always
thought of it more along the lines of the ships accelerating
(pre-jump) to match the velocity of the target star, then jumping,
then maneuvering to match with the target planet. Since the ship
maintains its velocity, this will bring out nearly stationary with
respect to the system it jumps to.

	I like this system. However, just how accurate are jump drives
supposed to be? Again, my assumption is that they can get you near the
system you\'re aiming for, and, for good astrogators, relatively near
the planet.

	I\'m curious too! Besides, when my campaign gets going, it\'s

has already been said so hopefully this will be a (final) summary.



My background is that I *am* a theoretical physicist (in training)
specializing in astrophysics.  That\'s just for the record.



Okay, first, unless the quantization on the gravity field is important
(assume it\'s not) the *strength* of the field should *not* influence
the motion of anything inside the star ship, including the jump drive.
Any object in free fall in a uniform field will not detect the fact
that they are in said field.  If the field is *not* uniform, then,
in the case of gravity, you will feel what we call tidal forces, which
as was pointed out, fall off as the cube of the distance.  Therefore
the person who pointed out that this was the origin of the 100 
diameter rule was exactly right for the best physical reasons I can
think of (thus minimizing the size of the Physics Nullifier Box needed.)
The 100 diameter rule will be subject to modifications due to density
of the object and length of the starship, but I don\'t think it will
play to large a role.  I\'ll do the math if anyone really wants to know.

A new point, just because you jump from 100 diameters away from the 
nearest celestial body doesn\'t mean that you automatically arrive
that close to your destination, it only provides a lower bound.
How do you know where the body is that you want to get close to from
the next system?  If the system is well known, sure the library 
computer could keep an ephemeris for all the planetary information
and calculate it, but that could be a lot of worlds.  It assumes you
know what *direction* you\'re heading in from *exactly* or you don\'t
know where your coordinate axes for the planetary reference frame
will be.  My opinion is that it would be difficult to keep track
of this at best, and the consequences aren\'t too horriffic.

If one is jumping into Sol system and they don\'t know where all the
celestial bodies are, I\'d just jump into the region between, say,
Earth and Mars orbit.  Or perpendicular to the plane of the system
(if that is known.)  And then accelerate to the planet.  Even at
only 1 g that won\'t take more than a couple of days, tops.  The
chance of actually hitting something in there is negligible.  Note
that if you aren\'t showing up in system at 100 diameters, that gives
the pirates (in a fast ship) much more time to match vectors and do
pirate things.  

Finally, the chance of hitting something 100 diameters away from Earth is
basically insignificant even if there are 1000 ships arriving on this
edge each day.  Finally, I see no reason to not be accelerating when
you jump.  So one should be able to make it to jump point that much
faster.

On a related note, assume the jump drive does not violate any 
conservation principles (except information density.)  Then one
ought to reenter jump space with the same momentum and energy as
when one leaves (when you\'re in jump space this gets transfered to
the vacuum zero point energy or some other magical hand waving
concept.)  This can cause interesting situations when jumping
to a star that has a high proper motion relative to the origin.
In that case, you may *want* to accumulate a lot of momentum
(relative to the center of the galaxy) before jumping so that
one doesn\'t have to accelerate half way to the planet, if you
see what I mean.  

Enjoy,

particular, the 100 diameter limit), I\'s like to pose another related
question: How do you handle sensors in space?

In combat, a sensor ops roll has a difficulty profile according to
whatever sensor array you happen to be using, modified by Sensor Ops
skill or computer model and range. The range DM is -1 per square (or
25000 km). That means that even with a Simple sensor ops task and a
model 9 computer, anything beyond 450000 km is invisible. Here\'s how I
arrived at that number:


	 Best dice roll:  12
	 Computer model: + 9
	 ----
			  21
	Number required: - 3
	 ----
	  Maximum range:  18 x 25000 = 450000 km
	   (in squares)

That seems totally unreasonable to me, especially when some of the
sensor packages have a Interstellar range.

Notice that any planet size 5+ can\'t even detect ships out to its 100
diameter radius (without the help of navigation satellites, etc). That
seems really bizarre.

I don\'t _think_ I\'ve missed anything entirely obvious, have I?

After some thought about this problem, I\'ve come up with a possible solution...
The tasks given in the space combat section of the ref\'s guide are for COMBAT
only.  They represent getting a useful fix on the target.  At the range of
18 squares = 450000000 m = 4.5 * 10^8, it will take 1.5 seconds for light
to travel the distance (c = 3 * 10^8 approx).  So for a passive sensor, you
wait 1.5 seconds to detect something and and least 1.5 for your response to
get back (for lasers it is 1.5, for most other things it will be longer).
This is a totaly round trip time of 3+ seconds!!  In a combat situation this
is a VERY long time and the target will have maneuvered somewhat before your
response hits it.  For an active sensor things are even worse and the figures
come out at about 3 seconds to detect and 1.5 (min) response.  I agree that
a range of 18 is a bit long even for space combat, but going down to a range
of 6 squares, you still have one second response time (which is still quite
large).



Basically, I\'d say that the tasks given in the refs guide are for combat
purposes only and that they represent the getting of useful information.
For non-combat sensor scans, a new suite of tasks will have to be devised
which work out to a much longer range.  I haven\'t defined any such tasks
(yet :-), but I\'d be interested in the TML\'s comments about the idea.

This would have to be repaired, a ship that comes out of jump with its
transponder blasting away would have to be detected (it might take a while
for the detection to occur, but it would be known to be present).

hiya,

	I\'ve just found an interesting quirk in the starship/trading
rules in MT.

	A Free Trader costs MCr36.915 (from the Imperial Encyclopedia p81).
	The purchase a starship (same source p89), you put down 20% of
the purchase price (MCr7.383) leaving you with 80% to pay off (MCr29.532)
You pay MCr36.915 / 240 per month = Cr153812.5  You pay this for 480 months,
this is an interest rate of 5.57% per year.  To me this seems a little low.
I\'d rate a starship as a high risk investment (piracy, skipping repayments,
bad luck) and it would be quite a large investment.  I don\'t know what the
interest rates for such investments in the USA are but here in Aust, they are
much much higher than 5.57% (but we do have excessively high interest rates ;-)

	Either the Imperium\'s banks are a little on the stupid side, or they
get some kind of Imperial subsidy for financing free traders.  No bank would
underwrite a loan on the conditions above (unless the person wanting the loan
could guarantee it in some way or they were a well known buisness-person).

	Comments anyone?

Don\'t mail in your next turn-action right away.  go ahead and prepare it,

Part 1:  Somewhare in the Uncharted Depths of Space...



"Aiwi.  Wake the others and ensure we\'re ready to depart jump."  The cool
Aslan reflexively licked the back of his paw as he scanned the ship\'s 
system holos.  A deep purr-growl spontaneously and quietly emerged from
his throat as he thought of a real discovery for the Clan.  "Let\'s see
where we are now."

In the darkness, a sudden blue flare appears briefly, and then changes
color and dims, fading through the spectral colors, the outline of an 
exploration vessel appearing as its grid loses the last of its charge.



The only visible companion to the ship is a yellow-green star, about two 
weeks journey away.  No other bodies appear on any of the scans, but there 
is a strange neutrino flux, seeming coming from almost every direction in 
the ship\'s forward arc.

"For the glory of the clan!" Akhou roars.  "Find us some food and
some fuel, and let\'s see what makes this star flicker."



**************************************************************************



Part 2.  Aboard the Alcyon



<recap>

The Alcyon has gone to general quarters.  The bridge crew is busy
trying to set up a comm link and verifiable sensor readings.  The
armory overflows with volunteers packing powerful sidearms.  The
engine room is recharging jump caps and bringing up engines as fast
as possible.  The Aurora has opened it\'s outer hatch and is preparing
to receive Anton for emergency medical treatment.

Outside, a large force of apparantly Imperial (somebody\'s Imperium)
vessels has jumped in and is rapidly slowing, probably to turn and
approach the ships rendezvoused for transfer.	This fleet is now
about 2 AU away, and heading the wrong (or right) way -- away.

Snowball is spraying hydrogen in an enormous swath between the Alcyon
and the incoming fleet.  This is playing havoc with your (and their)
sensors.  Anslinger is maneuvering erratically, spraying neutrinos in
all kinds of different direction, and all kinds of different energy
levels.  The "scout" is presently on a collision course with one of
the larger ships, at a closing speed that is becoming relativistic.

<turn>

====================

In engineering, Kimball Redd settles in and begins to monitor and
adjust fuel flow and pressure.  He looks around to verify just who is
in engineering right now and where they are.  He spots Abuko giving
instructions to Aaron and Fitz.  Slide, the new guy seems to be
settling in nicely on the corrsponding panel on the opposite side of
the control room, and Ralf seems to be helping him out, or at least
wondering what\'s gonna happen next.

Some of the physical scientists come in, look around and head toward
Johann.  One of the new guys, who is it?  MT?  Yeah, MT head directly
for the open overhead panel and starts to latch it into place.  Ah, a 
real engineer in there with those gravitron-weenies.

Where\'s Zben?  Did he make it in?  Oh yeah, on the bridge.  Good, now
rf they decide to shut down internal radio links, I know who I\'m working 
with anyway. 

One other thought - If we get boarded, how many people in engineering are
armed? - Mine\'s in my cabin, not that I fancy taking on Imperial Marines
with a HEAP snub pistol, but you never know. And does general quarters
include vac-suits? - I never heard an answer to that one.  I notice
some of the folks here have \'em on and some don\'t.



We sure haven\'t had any time for training.  Hope everything is
holding together OK.  "Slide, you haven\'t had long to get to know the 
layout - you managing OK?"

"No problem.  Nicely laid out."

The numbers here would astound a non-engineer.  Nothing to full fuel
flow in under 30 seconds.  Wow!  Let\'s see, 500 tons per minute,
that\'s ... 114,000 plus liters per second at full flow.  Rate of
change is over 38 kl/s/s.  I can hardly wait to see those pipes when
we get out of this one.

=======================

Rigo Edmondsen slowly opened his eyes and shook his head as a jagged 
pain thrust itself from one temple to the other.  Ouch!  What happened?  
He had been sitting at the desk in his stateroom, enjoying a snack and
reading "Lord Alderon and The Rebel Fleet", an old favorite of his,
when... what?

The alert!  That was it!  Ignoring the pain Edmondsen rose to his
feet in one fluid motion and checked the wall clock.  Five minutes!
He had been unconcious for almost five minutes.  As he quickly
tapped his percomp for a transcript of any messages recieved during
his unconciousness, he looked around the stateroom and tried to
reconstruct how he had been knocked out.  When the jump alert had
sounded he had jumped for his bunk and carelessly knocked over his
snack.  Then, when the call for action stations had come, he had
jumped out of his bunk, placed his left heel squarely on the
sandwich, gone over backwards and neatly knocked himself out on
the bunk edge...

As he zippered up his vacc suit and grabbed the life support
unit he felt his ears grow red.  Good thing no-one back home would
ever know this.  The hero of the Groober Block Riot felled by a
ham sandwich!  He gave a small sigh of relief as the comp told him
that no messages had been directed at him.  He buckled on the stun
pistol and, after a short hesitation, his gauss pistol,
automatically checking the load and charges.  As he left his
stateroom he gave a small prayer to Snafu, god of fools, rogues
and cockups, that no-one would ever demand an accounting of him
for those missing minutes.

Falling instinctively into the deceptively fast lope of the
urban sniper-hunter, incessantly checking in all directions for
enemies, he thumbed his communicator onto the generalist\'s band.

"Whitfield?  Edmondsen here. I can\'t fill any crew post except 
communication, so I\'m on my way to the armoury.  Unless you countermand, 
I\'ll put myself under Farouk	and help as a guard.  Edmondsen out."


<Mac> "I\'ve got no problems with you working with Farouk.  Good Luck." 

As he comes around the corner, Rigo is pulled up short by a beehive
of gauss and energy pistols leveled at him.  Stopping, and speaking 
verrrry slowly, he says "Need any help?  I\'m qualified on all infantry 
weapons, but best with an ordinary rifle."


===================

On the bridge, Zben turns to his panel.  "Computer, re-align main radio 
and laser arrays to position of incoming bogie traffic.  Calculate speed 
and [...etc] (synaptic I/O must be good for something)."

A few moments later, Zben turns to Etienne.  "I have established full 
high speed data links with all attached ships (actually, it was part 
of the whole communications set-up), so all you have to do is call it 
up."

Etienne glances at Zben then looks, somewhat suspiciously, at the sensor
console.

"Ahem...Computer...Please display all sensor data from Scout ship Aurora 
in Sectors 50 to 100 of the Alcyon\'s main Holodisplay.  Apply all data 
manipulations currently running on the Alcyon\'s sensor data to everything 
from the Aurora...[long pause] Thank you."

The computer quetly goes about it\'s work, setting aside one section
of the holo for the requested information.  "Sir," it speaks "I have
taken the liberty of also adding all available sensor information,
from all available sources, to the main holodynamic view."  The display 
clears somewhat, as Alcyon\'s computers start muscling the data now 
arriving from four sets of sensors.  The additional information, and 
the attendant information gained by parralax starts restoring color 
and depth to a display that was rapidly deteriorating.

<Etienne> Without looking up from the sensor controls...  Cursing in 
French, under his breath.  "Never heard of an airlock with no safety 
overrides!"



"Charyn, help Zben with commo.  You maintain the links with the Anslinger, 
the fuel barge and the scout.  Zben can handle communications with the Imps.
If any."



"Zben, don\'t transmit anything without Commander Ger\'s orders, but let us 
know what they\'re saying, as soon as anything reaches us."



<Charyn>  "Aye aye, Sir." Charyn uproots one of the movable acceleration 
couches and replants it at the Comm console, edging Zben over to the right 
a little bit (Charyn is apparently a leftie).

"Hi Zben, I\'m Charyn Robins.  Pardon me while I muscle in on this half
of the console."

She pauses for a moment, studying the layout, then makes and brief poke
at the console.  It instantly reconfigures the panel to standard Vilani
mercantile Comm display layout.  Her hands fly over the panel with
deliberate and practiced motions, as if from memory, with a few clever
twists of inspiration.  After 15 seconds her rapt concentration relaxes.
Most of the data has been rearranged into a setup a little different
from the standard layout.  She pulls a strand of hair back from her
face, leans back a little; a pleased, detached smile drifts across
her lips.



"Links with Anslinger, fuel barge, and scout are open and functioning...
Internal ship communications active."



She efficiently opens a small window in the corner of her half-panel on
Navigation, Sensor, Engineering, Security, and other ship functions, so
she can scan the status of all bridge functions secondary to Comm.  She
pays a little heavier attention to the Nav and Sensor displays.  Then
she reprograms her commdot to place her on all appropriate ship
frequencies.

<Zben>  "We now have laser hookups with the sensors from the scout,
the Anslinger, and the Snowball."

Now the holo truly clears with the adidtion of the information
gleaned from the other side of the gas cloud.  Eleven ships are
visible.  Three seem to be of a typical 2000T Imperial cruiser design. 
One is a tender of some kind.  Three are fuel barges, much like
Snowball.  Two are 500T escort vessels, and two are fast pickets. 
These last two already are peeling away from the rest of the fleet
and preparing to engage the Turskaad scout.  The display indicates
weapon range for those combatants in ~6 minutes.  About 4 minutes
remain before you might hear any initial signals from the Imp fleet
(or them from you), and about 24 before any round-trip signals.

<Etienne> "Niishu, will we have jump coordinates by the time 
engineering is ready?	By the way, any idea yet where we\'re heading 
on this next jump?"

<Nishu>  "The nav computer is working on those coordinates now.  It 
shouldn\'t take long; all the equipment on this ship is state of the art.  
If we do have to jump, Engineering\'s charge time will be the limiting 
factor."

"I\'ll report when it\'s done and try to figure out where we\'re going."


========================================


Upon getting the word from Lazer to man the laser turrets on
the \'Talisman, Thul runs to the central Fire Control station about
his ship and 

        1) Lifts the safety cover off a switch
        2) puts it in the Bridge Station Overide position.

satisfied with this, he pell-mells to the \'Talisman\'s bridge and
throws himself into the pilot\'s position.  Thul grabs a card that
he has stashed under the FC panel and methodicly goes through the
checklist that his previous gunner provided him. A red enunciator
indicates "Fire Control Panel Active".  Grabing a square device
with three buttons on it, he presss the left button.  On a screen
a table of selections pops up and he follows it down through the
choices 

   "Fire Control" ----> "Sensor Source" ----> "Passive All" -->

   "Process" ----> "All" ----> "Computer" and releases the button.



        This set of choices in an instant sets up the following conditions:

        1)  Only passive sensors are being used in conjuction with the 
        fire control system.

        2)  All sensor input is processed through the ship\'s computer
        to sync up the fire control.

        3) Disables all but navigational active sensors.

He then selects

        "Sensor" ----> "Process" ----> "MTI"  (Moving Target Indicator)

        

Thul then selects

        "Compute" ----> "Firing Solution" ----> "Passive" --> "Contacts/All"

        
On another screen, (right ref?) the firing solution on all bogeys
is displayed with a confidence level for each.  (Pretty mediocre
considering the sensors being used.)

On a computer console he types "load gunnery 6" "load auto/fire"
"load auto/target" "load select 5"

Lastly he selects

        "Weapons" ----> "Lock/Soft" ----> "Safe"

        

This downloads the firing solution to the turrets for the targets
and awaits target selection.



Over the security circuit he reports in to Lazer.
"Lazer, Thul here,  the \'Talisman\'s fire control system has
 firing solutions for our bogies.  Weapons are in soft-lock and
 safed.   Using passive sensors only.  CIWS activated. Awaiting orders"

If we can recover Anton\'s foot, we might be able to reattach it.  Of course,
this would involve re-growing a great deal of flesh.  Anton would be out of
action for quite some time, and we can\'t be certain of whether the cloned
nerve tissue would take.  I remember researching this area some many years
ago.  Let\'s see...  No, I\'d have to go back to my old notes.  I could be of
assistance if you want to pursue this course -- after I check them, though.

If you decide to use prosthetics, it would still put Anton out for a while,
but as you know would be a bit more certain.

Let me know what you think is best.  Until then, I\'m going to try to get to
some of my equipment to see what the devil could be going on outide.

Limner, out.

Joachim\'s voice comes over the medical channel:

Ian, I\'m scrubbed and preped in sickbay.  Where is the amputation?  If
there\'s no chance for recovery of the missing part, what do you
recommend for a prosthetic?

Christian, we can handle Anton here.  There\'s no need for you to rush
over if your current work is more important.

<Alliara>  Is there anything I can help with?

<Ian>  (Panting) "I\'m almost to Aurora now."  Puff  Puff "Not really
anxious to start running again."  Puff Puff "Doc, where do we go?!"

<Doc Van Der Merwe>  Bring \'im in now!  Joakim, Limner, get here on
the double!  The medical facilities aboard the Alcyon are adequate, 
but all of the really important stuff is aboard the Aurora, where the 
main Surgery is. 

He\'s coming to the Aurora for three reasons: that\'s where the equipment
is, I\'m CMO (& prob. the best skilled & a surgeon), and I have special
expertise in bionics anyway.... Besides, I was just doing some routine
checklists...

Joachim on the medical channel:

Anton\'s going to be out for a while no matter what we do.  Even with
time modification these things take a while to recover from.

I\'m a bit skeptical about rejoining a freeze-dried foot, but then
vacuum medicine is hardly my specialty.  \'Vouf certainly has some
interesting, ... um, err ... hands.  Think we could something like
that for a foot?

We have to stabilize Anton first.  Prosthetic decisions can wait until
the current major crisis is concluded.


Joachim, out.


================================

back on the bridge...



<Niishu> "Etienne, I have that information now.  Jump is layed in,
waiting for engineering.  We should arrive 1.115 AU from this star
here."  A pip on his holo brightens.  It\'s 5 parsecs away, no known
planets, and has a very rhythmic brightness oscillation.  I\'d say
*that\'s* R-alpha.

"If we jump within the next seven minutes, it should be much, much
harder for the fleet to trace our ionization trail."

<Ger> "Etienne, jump as soon as engineering is ready.  Are we still
in Imperial space?

<Etienne> "Aye, sir.  Just barely.  This is the last location
clearly claimed in the latest set of charts."

=================================

Back in engineering, Slide is watching the fuel disappear at an
appreciable rate.  "Nav, Slide.  How much fuel is needed for the next
jump?"  

<Niishu> It\'s a 5 parsec jump Slide.  That\'s about all I\'ve got right
now.  How \'much longer till you\'re charged?"

<Slide> Caps say 73% charge now.   Probably 5 minutes and we\'ll be
ready.  Just get us there.  Out."

Now, let\'s see, ... yeah. we\'ve got enough hydrogen.  Hope we don\'t
misjump.  We sure don\'t have enought for a second.  What the ... !!!	 
Slide gasps as he sees the fuel flow in number 4 conduit suddenly 
skyrocket and and the pressure plummet.

"Engineering.  Emergency!  Overide this bank!  Break in number 4
feed!"  Slide immediately sets to work re-balancing the load to the
governors and capacitors while Redd gets to work on the fuel
routings.

At that instant, as Daniel Sylvmain crosses from Abuko toward the
rear of the control room, the overhead panel bursts open and
inundates him with supercooled hydrogen, freezing him in mid-stride
like a baroque statue, and lowering the temperature in the
compartment rapidly.

MT, the second nearest person, is splashed and knocked across the
control room, sliding to rest not too far frm the front door,
unconsious, and in serious hypothermia.

Engineers and scientists begin donning helmets and gloves, as a
flashing amber beacon cast macabre shadows across the control room,
now glazed with frost.

With practiced hands, Redd secures the feed through the number 4
conduit, bypassing the break, and Slide\'s panel.  Alarms begin
sounding again, and the air-tight doors close.  Lets see.. gotta
reroute pronto or we\'re in deep guano.  Ah, number eleven - bypass
through Talisman\'s fuel hookups and hope she holds.

"Slide, I\'ve got it sealed, hope your maintaining balance.
 Abuko, Redd.  Got it bypassed through Talisman, and secondary on
 Paladin.  Hope they hold together."

Then, stopping to get his gloves and helmet on, Kimball notices the
frostbite forming on his fingers, and on the spot on his lip where 
he\'d been biting.  "Oh shit" he mutters quietly.

<Abuko>  "Somebody get over there and prop him up before he falls
over and shatters."

"Sickbay, Engineering.  Stand by for hypothermia victims."

"Leadfoot, get onto that break STAT!"

Glancing at his portable panel repeater, Johann studies the fuel
flows for a minutes, then switches to the piping diagrams for the
interconnects.

"Redd, Slide, give me 110% on the conduits 1,2, and 3; then back off
Talisman\'s feed to 70%."  



"Bridge, Engineering.  We\'ve had a fuel flow casualty.  We\'ll have to
postpone jump .. 2 minutes.  That gives us.. about four minutes to go
before the caps are charged, emergency fashion -- if it holds.  Or,
if you prefer, we can do it in .. eight minutes very safely."


===============================

<Ger> "Engineering, Conn.  Give us a 6.5 minute charge; a little margin 
of safety, but not a lot."  



Turning to the assembled queue of non-bridge personnel, "Now,
gentlemen, we either vaporize ourselves, convince the natives, we are
NOT dinner, or escape with very little trouble.  In any case, you
have yourself a story, (gesturing toward Adrian) and you have
yourself some information about your competition (talking directly to
Jett).  Better get us some legal precedent quickly.  IT won\'t take
those guys very long to figure out where we went."



=================================

<Abuko (and the rest of engineering)>  "Whew.  Thank God for small
breaks.  Redd, reduce fuel flow to 100% on the primaries and 50% on
the backup.

"and somebody shut off that alarm."

=======================================

In the number 1 passageway:

"Engineering, Ian.  {puff} Almost got Anton to sickbay now.  {puff} 
Be down there in about two minutes.  {puff puff} Anybody at the armory 
got any first aid, {puff} or available to {puff} run down the hallway 
with a body? {puff, click} 



"Doc {puff} I got Lucan here. {puff} Can you send Dulinor down {puff}
or do you need him in Sickbay {puff}?"

Ian, Anton, and Lucan scoot through the Aurora\'s air lock as Dulinor,
the second medbot literally flies out the door and down the
passageway, siren blazing.	Docs Limner and Tabor jump aside as it
screams by, and then Tabor turns around and starts following it to
engineering.

<Doc Van Der Merwe> "Great.  Plug Lucan in there and we\'ll start 
feeding him the new programs while the others fetch the folks from 
engineering.  Ian, walk *WALK* down to engineering and help out."

The two doctors then carefully put Anton into a stasis module and
begin working.


=================================

The bridge\'s main holo display flickers slightly and its image gets 
a little poorer.



<Niishu>  "Sir, the Snowball just jumped." 
<Charyn>  "The anslinger wishes us luck.  Recommends we detonate the
hydrogen just prior to jump to simulate an on-board explosion."

<Niishu>  "Anslinger is gone, sir.  Now the scout, too."

<Ger>  Very well.  "Lazer, slave a single HE missile to the
Talisman\'s turret.  Thul, on my signal, blast the hydrogen cloud with
laser and the single HE.  ... Once.  

Maybe we\'ll get a fireball to remember on our way out of here."

<Lazer>  Roger.  

<Thul>   Locked and loaded.

=====================

Abuko silences the engineering alarm and opens the main control room
door.  Dulinor flashes in and grabs MT and Daniel, and hauls *ss out
of engineering toward the Aurora.

A moment later, Ian appears with a first aid kit, and a *very* large
thermos.  "Who wants chicken soup?"

A chorus of voices is heard.

=====================

<Niisu>  Got a green board, Sir.

<Etienne>  Ready for jump sir.

<Ger>  "Fire.  Engage."

The Alcyon literally sighs as the lights blink, then momentarily dim, 
in their pre-programmed pattern for jump initiation.  Outside, space
becomes bluish, and suddenly brilliantly white, just as it
disappears. 

					     

<Niishu> 99.99995% discharge sir.  We\'re gonna come out of this jump
within a few hundred meters of our programmed point.

I have a question for anyone familiar with the recent history of the
Spinward Marches and it\'s environs:

What are the Border Worlds?



The Megatraveller Imperial Encyclopedia doesn\'t say anything about them
(that I have found), and I lost track of the goings-on in the Traveller 
universe after the Fifth Frontier War.  Who controls the Border Worlds?  
Are they a captive government?  Where do their sympathies lie?

...are an Imperially-aligned buffer state created from half of the 
beaten Sword Worlds Confederation at the end of the Fifth Frontier War
to limit the threat from a united Sword Worlds government. They are a
largely captive gov\'t and would gladly re-form with the SWC if Norris
would let them. Details may be found in THE SPINWARD MARCHES CAMPAIGN.

I decided not to long ago to start a MegaTraveller game here in Berkeley.
It\'s been about 2 years since I last ran MT, but I was still feeling a little
burned out on the Imperium.  I\'d seen so much of it over the last X years
that it seemed NORMAL.  Trying to recapture to exotic flavor of Traveller
for myself, I decided to go ahead and run my new campaign SOMEWHERE ELSE.
(Somewhere still being developed).  What I\'m kind of interested in knowing
is if any one else out there has run Non-Imperium Traveller campaigns
and what interesting things they\'ve done in them.

Thx,

I\'ve been in a couple of campaigns set outside the Imperium, and have a pet
project of my own in the works.



One was a (theoretical, the GM made a new sector somewhere 8-) trans-border
region that hadn\'t been explored very well yet.  We were hired to go scout
it out and survey it.  It was... interesting.  Especially when higher-than-
Imperial tech gadgets group depended on failed for various reasons, 
leaving some of us stranded DEEP in space.

One setting that I\'ve been working on is the Zhodani core expedition.  It\'s
only mentioned in passing, but there\'s a lot of territory it covers, and the
chance to do some very neat things with the setting.

Another is a post-TL20 setting.  A universe with starship-sized portals between
most major planets is a whole different eniverse from a jump-only travel.
And there\'s allways a ringworld or three 8-)

Shannon, I\'ve run two non-Imperial Traveller campaigns: the first was 
before any information at all on the Imperium was ever published 
anywhere (1977-1978), and the second was a "mini-universe" I whipped
up for a campaign for a course I taught in Role Playing Theory in 
college (no, really! and for credit, too!). If one doesn\'t mind the
physics of the rules, one can rewrite things easily, and having a
different reality makes jumps like TDR a lot easier as well if one
DOES mind the physics of the Imperium.



There are a number of other folks who have their own universes too;
one fellow whose name eludes me at the moment has published a fair
amount on the subject.

Well, Shannon, I\'m glad you asked.



You see, I\'ve run a number of non-Imperium games and campaigns
(Traveller being my favorite game system).  I\'ll tell you about
a few of them.  I also still have background notes for some of
them.



Anyway, here are the scenarios:



o Post-Nuclear holocaust.  You\'ve grown up in the wreckage.  There
  are mutant animals and such.  First Contact.  But the Aliens have
  a SECRET, which you must discover.  I ran this as a one-player
  campaign (before Traveller:2300 came out).  It started out more
  like Gamma World than Traveller.  Then the Aliens arrive and
  promise to make everything better.  Yet you don\'t seem to see any
  real progress, only a few tokens of Alien goodwill.  Why?  A bit of
  detective work is called for.

  One this this campaign did was give me experience creating animals
  using Traveller.

  I tried to give the feel of a broken Earth, after being blasted
  back into the Stone Age, with a few mutants thrown in for good
  measure.  The alien part caters to "detective" PCs, and could be
  eliminated entirely if you wish.  This campaign gives Traveller
  players a chance to play larger-than-life heroes, such as are often
  seen only in D&D-type games.

o Exploration mission.  Aiuconium (Ay-You-Ko-Nee-Um) has been
  discovered.  It is a stable heavy element which emits rays which
  stabilize nuclear reactions, making nuclear fusion a reality.  You
  are in an advanced Shuttle scanning the Moon for these ray
  emissions.  What you discover instead is a frontier cruiser.

  Another First Contact scenario, only this time you discover that
  the galaxy is at war and you must choose sides.  I recently ran
  the first part of this at a convention.  It went over pretty well.
  I made great use of impromptu skill rolls for this one.



  The cruiser had a definite Imperial feel, although this was not the
  Imperium.  This was kind of a choice of the lesser of two evils --
  an Empire which will plunder the Earth for its resources, leaving
  its people alone, or a Federation which will bring its technology
  to the Earth, but will bring it into the war as well, and actively
  "assimilate" us into its culture.  Real enterprising PCs might be
  able to find a way to avoid both and buy the Earth a few more years
  of anonymity.



o Another campaign I developed was non-Imperium, non-Earth, etc:
  You are a human from a free Federation, which has been plagued by
  attacks from a hostile alien race.  Eventually, open war breaks out
  between the two races.  The problem is that you don\'t know where
  the alien bases are -- they are a complete unknown.  Meanwhile,
  contact is made with another race, which promises to help you by
  leading you to the hostile aliens\' capital.  What you don\'t know is
  that they are trying to manipulate the war so that both sides are
  destroyed and they can pick up the pieces.



  This is a kind of grand campaign, where the players get to make
  galaxy-affecting decisions.  One thing that\'s very important to
  this type of campaign is to provide LOTS of background material,
  most of which will never get used.  You also have to be able to
  "wing it" pretty well.



  As a point of interest: the characters in this campaign destroyed
  the first envoy from the "friendly" race, thinking it was an attack
  from their traditional enemies (they DID warn them with radio
  messages, but the envoy used a different method of communication).
  They then felt so guilty after learning of their mistake that they
  fell right into the trap unprepared.  They were so unconventional,
  though (and you would not believe the lucky skill rolls they made),
  that they managed to come through in the end.  As an example, when
  attacked by a type of battle cruiser/starbase, they realized that
  their long range fighter would never survive, so blasted their way
  into the hanger, then through interior walls until they got to an
  access shaft to the core (like what Lando Calrissian did to the
  second death star, only crazier).



I can\'t remember the other totally non-Imperium campaigns at this
time, BUT I\'d like to point out another option: what about devising
your own sector/star/star cluster/whatever?



Here are two more background settings I have used:



o You are pirates in a star system on the edge of the Imperium.  You
  don\'t know about Imperial events, and don\'t care.  You live off of
  booty from passing ships.



  This is a fun campaign to run, and to be in.  I once played in one
  of these campaigns as a deposed barbarian chieftain, who was
  vicious with a sword.  The GM put us on an Ancients asteroid base,
  and kept trying to get us involved in Imperial matters.  We only
  paid attention to things that would help us in our piracy, ignoring
  the rest.  We didn\'t want that kind of campaign.  We were PIRATES,
  damn it, not research scientists.  That was lots of fun.



o You are in a star cluster called The Barrens.  They have a unique
  atmosphere which makes them a rather unpleasant place to live, and
  they have always been a bunch of backwater worlds, despite their
  proximity to the sector capitol of the Diaspora sector.  After the
  assassination of Strephon, they find that The Barrens are squeezed
  uncomfortably between Daibei, the Solomani Confederation, and the
  Imperial Marines (which have a base a few parsecs away).  Their
  solution -- ignore everything that is going on around them, and get
  ignored in return.

  I\'ve set up two campaigns in this setting.  It is based in the
  Imperium (although I\'ve made a few minor changes here and there),
  but they have no contact with it.  Each of the five worlds has a
  unique flavor to it, uncorrupted by Imperial tampering.

  "Travellers\' Aid Society?  Are you joking?" -- you get the picture.

  I also took a great deal of latitude in the way things work when
  running these campaigns.



My point with the last two campaigns is this: if you place your
campaign appropriately, you can put it in the Imperial setting but
make it entirely your own, using only what you want from the
Imperium.

The advantage of the Imperium is the background knowledge you have
(it\'s tough to design a consistent universe, and keep it interesting).
Other good sources of background knowledge include using the Earth of
the near future (or present, or past), or books, or movies.

Star Wars is a good model for a universe, as is Star Trek.  I\'ve done
some background work using both systems in Traveller.  You need to
use antimatter drives for Star Trek, but it works.  This was before
the proliferation of RPG\'s though.  Each of these now has its own
game system.  There are also a number of campaign possibilities in
the Foundation universe, although I have not worked on any of them.

Shannon,



I was running a campaign for a while that had the premise that an
over-populated earth had sent sleeper ships out to colonize the
stars.   The result was a collection of ethnic enclaves.  These
enclaves took on some flavor that appealed to the people within
that enclave.   For instance, I had "Nihon" which was the Japanese
enclave that had taken the flavor of fuedal Japan of the 14th and
15th century... only at tech 12!  They happened to get along real
well with the Aslan as well.

There were some tech 15 areas within my universe, but the average
was tech 11 or 12.  

In my universe, the Imperium was known about, but rarely interacted
with.  This was to keep some of my players happy that wanted to
have characters with an Imperial background.  The major difference
was that I had the Imperium displaced in space by a few dozen
sectors so that they did not interfere with the history of Terra
and it\'s outplaced colonies.   Terra, for its part by now had
killed itself off in a series of cataclysmic wars due to the
pressures of overpopulation.  The original reason behind the
diaspora of its peoples to the colonies.

the Traveller Mailing List at large -- James]

I\'ve never run a traditional Traveller campaign, but I\'ve used something
like the Traveller system (actually, it\'s gradually mutated into something
quite different, including a bunch of new characteristics, lots of new
skills, and a weapon system that\'s reasonably close to realistic--i.e.,
Jesus!  They\'re shooting REAL guns at us!  I mean, we could get KILLED
from ONE SHOT!  Jeez!

Anyway, and this background stuff is copyright Mark Gellis 1991, it\'s
fifty thousand years in the future, and humanity is now a young, but
respected member of the intergalactic community known as the Network.
The Network spans the universe.  There are no jump drives, people se
(oops, that should be "use") hypergates, enormous machines that can
punch portals through spacetime...they have no maximum range so people
can just cross the distance between galaxies at will.  In other words,
you\'ve got as many solar systems to play with as you need.

There are three large human governments--the Solian Commonwealth, the
Po Empire, and the Ocyron Federation.  Technically, Solia are the good
guys ("good" a relative term in politics).  There are also dozens of
smaller federations, hundreds of independent systems, and millions of
independent nation-states in the thousands of human-controlled solar
systems.

There are more aliens than you can shake a stick at.  If you want an
alien character, bounce an idea off me and if I don\'t think it will
needlessly unbalance the game, it\'s yours.

Technology has reached a high and stable level.  Assume Tech Level 20 
is the norm, except there are no psionics and anti-gravity (sorry, I
just don\'t believe in \'em)(), although some civilizations are rumored
to have much higher technology at their disposal.  Eeek!

Don\'t worry about uncontrolled mayhem.  The universe does not have a
government--it\'s too big--but it does have caretakers.  Long ago, an
ancient race (actually, several of them, working as allies) fought
another ancient race and ITS allies, and won, so the universe was
not devoured by the bad guys several billion years ago, and the good
guys built the Modems, a machine race who own, control, and often are
the hypergates, and who have a racial prerogative to observe the
organics and make sure they don\'t genocide each other out of existence
(murder and war are okay, but genocide and uncontrolled expansion
are no-nos).  This is actually my explanation for why WE are here
now--after all, if you have intelligent life and FTL travel billions
of years ago, they would have kept expanding and colonized Earth 
and we would never have evolved, unless something stopped them.  (Sound
bizarre...try this experiment, a civilization with a trillion people
doubles its population ONLY once every million years, but it can
travel at infinite speed and its doubling rate starts in a hundred
solar system region two billion years ago...what\'s one trillion
doubled TWO THOUSAND times?  A lot of aliens, and no room for poor
evolving proto-humans.)

Of course, and many of you have listened to me chat about this every
now and then, I really have all of my adventures in only ONE solar
system.  How can I do this?  Simple.  Any space industrialized solar
system, with an asteroid belt (which I assume most of them have, or
will have after they shatter a few big moons) and a sun for solar power
and gas giants and comets for hydrogen has the raw materials to build
habitats (city-states) for several hundred billion people.  Usually,
I figure, you end up with a few million habitats organized into a few
hundred archipelagos.  Each habitat is its own city-state, but the
archipelagos are nations or federations, which are either independent,
or have allied or joined some larger federation, like the Solian
Commonwealth.  

Can you say, "Gee Mark, that sounds like an awful lot of places to
set adventures...and each habitat can have its own set of corrupt local
politicians, local criminals, local celebrities, etc., and so on"?



Why yes, it is.  That\'s why I like it.  I have an infinite range of
possibilities to work with, and I just narrow down to a particular locale
each campaign (or send people running around the system) and work out
the details.



Oh, did I mention that since there is no anti-gravity, and people are
limited to reaction drives (like a 1,000,000 Isp fusion drive--the most
common spacecraft drive) that the cometary halos of every solar system
are effectively a permanent frontier?  They\'re so spread out that no 
government can possibly control them, and they contain an enormous
number of cometary nuclei, which can each be used as a base (big ones
can be used as raw materials for entire habitats), so you get a lot
of free nations, some of them basically pirate nations, out in the
cometary halo of each solar system.  Good for adventures.  

Anyone who has any comments, etc., I would be interested, but it might
be better to send them to me via email, so we don\'t tie up the newsgroup,
since this is so different from the regular Traveller that it might not
really be fair to people who are interested only in the GDW games, etc.

[As list admin, I feel that FOLLOWUPs on specific setups are indeed best
directed at the orginator, but PLEASE feel free to send in an OVERVIEW
of your setup as Mark and others have kindly shared -- James]

Anyway, enjoy.

I have always wanted to play Traveller with 3D star maps. This is
something which has always bothered me about the standard subsector
maps. I suspect GDW kept things 2D for simplicity, but I always
thought this might make things more interesting, especially in border
areas. 



I suggest you add this as an option to sysgen5 (or whatever the next
version is). The key thing to keep in mind is to maintain the average
3D interstellar distances close to that of the 2D game. Otherwise,
game balance as far as jump drives go might be thrown off. (BTW, does
any one know what the actual stellar density is in the various parts
of the galaxy?)

No, but I can see why GDW did not make it 3d.  Consider the problems
involved in displaying such a map.  The best and most accurate would be
a hologram.  But we haven\'t gotten that far yet....
An easier way would be multiple levels of 2d maps.  A real pain to use.
Another way would be to have notes about how far a system was above or
below the major 2d plane.

In the vicinity of our Sun the denisty is about 1 star per 10 cubic parsecs
or an average of 2.1 parsec between stars (in three dimensions).  Of course
this is near our Sun and things would certainly vary as you move in and out
of galatic arms, enter the core, move perpendicular to the plane of the
galaxy or change galatic types such as to an elliptical or irregular galaxy.
Near the core of our galaxy the estimated densities of stars per cubic parsec
goes something like:

Distance      	Number of
from Center	Stars per
in PC		Cubic Parsec
  0.1		3 x 10E7
  1.0		4 x 10E5
 10.0		7 x 10E3
 20.0		2 x 10E3

Hope this helps

I\'m relying on a Charles Sheffield article in a New Destinies issue (I\'m
sorry, I can\'t find my copy right now, but I will post the reference
later if anyone wants it) that is relying on the Daedelus project\'s
estimate of an Isp of 1,000,000.  I actually checked one source, which I
forgot to write down the name of, that listed the potential Isp of
fusion drives at 2.4 million (assuming perfect efficiency, etc.).  I\'m
assuming a) 40% of the ideal potential is conservative, but fair, and b)
my Traveller campaign is set far enough in the future that
matter-antimatter isn\'t even a "neat idea" anymore (anyone get that
reference?)...the engineering problems involved in getting a fusion
drive to its full potential are ancient history to these people.  I do
agree that, sadly, it will probably be a long time before we are able to
achieve this kind of efficiency with fusion, probably, in Traveller
terms, we\'re talking at least Tech.  12 or 13.



By the way, Sheffield also lists matter-antimatter at about 18,000,000 Isp.
I admit that I do cheat a bit and use 20,000,000; it\'s much easier to
figure things out that way.  :)

Greetings travellers,

In one of the later posts about the 100 diameter jump limit, Dan Corrin says:

>
>Third, in a talk given by Mark Miller, he always intended there to be a
>limited (but large) number of points that a ship could jump from/to,

This brings up a question, can you jump from any point outside the 100 diameter
limit regardless of destination?  I.E.  do you have to be on the same side of
the gravity source as your destination?  Or can you jump "through" a G source?
Wouldn\'t this drop you out of jumpspace when you reenter the 100 D limit?



If you do indeed have to be on the same side as your destination, would this
significantly change in-system travel times for some ships depending on your
destination?  Or will this not matter to a constant acceleration?  How about
you physics/astronautic types doing some calculations for travel times to the
100 diameter limit at 90 - 120 degrees around the other side of the gravity
source to see if it makes a significant time difference?

Our TML Historian asked some questions about DGP\'s publications. I
have in fact been in contact with the DGP by phone. From this I
understood that:



1) The first issue of MTJ is not yet out (or, wasn\'t when I spoke to
them two weeks ago). It should be out real soon now, though. The
person I spoke to said that the premiere issue should be out in
February. So, it\'s is just around the corner!



2) Yes, Flaming Eye is out, and has been so for a couple of months.
Manhunt is postponed, and will be released as a part of their Onnesium
triology this fall instead. Apart from this there is nothing more
advertised except their Grand Survey Software Package (or whatever
it\'s called). No word about their Aliens-series or Starship Operator\'s
Manual volume 2, or anyhting else.



3) A.I. (tm) is their new role-playing game to be released this fall
(som I suppose a lot of their energy right now goes into this!). I
asked them for a short resume of the concept, and I got it. If you\'re
interested I can pass on whet they said about it.



Regarding the ftp-site: Have anyone been successful in connecting to
sunbane lately? I haven\'t succeeded at all the last few weeks! And I
want to check that new trade-software... Could anyone send me a
mail-copy of the trade-software?



[MTJ is shipping now! Please feel free to share the AI summary with the
TML if you like.  I\'ve been on sunbane Feb 22 and Feb 28 (today).  It
works fine; are you aware that a couple months ago the ftp address
changed to 129.100.100.12? The new trade software is there, and I have a
copy of it.  If one last ftp to sunbane fails to work, let me know and I
will send you a copy.  -- James]

Metlay, I just gave The Military Corner (Portland gaming shop) a call.
It looks like the MegaTraveller Journal will be there today, or at least
sometime in the next week.  I\'ve been eagerly awaiting this mag!

The most recent DGP products that I know of are Vilani and Vargr,
Knightfall, and Flaming Eye.  No-one has any idea when Solomani and
Aslan or AI will be coming out, but TMC usually gets only about a week\'s
notice from their wholesaler (although TMC sold direct from DGP when the
company was a fledgling).  As soon as I hear of any more new products,
I\'ll be glad to make it generally known.  I pity you, being stuck in a
Traveller-product void.

Now that you\'ve all had a week to think it over carefully,
you can send in your PBEM turns.  Please try to limit yourselves
to a couple of play-type turns, and a moderate amount of 
inter-character discussion.  I, in turn, will endeavor to have
a resonse out ASAP.

So far I have not read it (much).  Just glancing through it, it is very
much like the Digest except it deals completely with MegaT.  The artwork ,
with a very nice cover, is a great improvement over before (on the whole).
Some noted things (I am glancing at it while typing), there are equipment
sheets and a discussion of the different types of battle dress and there is
an article titled,"A Concise History of the Rebellion", written by my
friend Clay Bush.  Should be really useful to someone like me who just got
into Traveller a year after the release of MegaT.  There is an adventure
which corresponds to the front cover and a few other things.

I noted a lack of material on Gming or design itself, and no Q&A, but
looking on the back page, they promise this in the next issue.



Overall, it was pretty much what I expected:  Not a startling improvement
over the Digest, but more articles dealing with the currents state of
the game. Note: there are no articles that deal with Traveller (ie. the
form of the game before MegaT was released) but I doubt anyone could not
use this material in a "old" Traveller format.

Maybe someone out there can give a detailed report of the contents.

     The list has been kind of quiet today, so I thought I\'d ask a
quick question:

     What\'s the data capacity of a holocrystal?  I\'ve taken a
(admittedly superficial) look through all the references I have here
and all I could find was a note in _Traveller\'s Digest_ 10 that one
holocrystal can hold about 5 hours of holographic video.  That\'s fine,
as far as it goes, but it doesn\'t tell me how much raw data the
crystal can hold.  If it\'ll hold 5 hours of video, I\'d assume that the
capacity is fairly large, but *how* large?  500 Mbytes?  1 Gbyte?  1
Terabyte?  More?

     The reason I\'m asking is that I\'m trying to find out how much
data can be contained in a cubic meter of holocrystals (I\'m assuming
one crystal every 2 cm, or 125,000 crystals in a 1 kl lattice).  After
I find *that* out, then I can estimate the capacity of a sphere of
crystals 100 km in diameter.  Yeah, that was *kilometers*.  I\'m writing
a scenario about an old (about the end of the Rule of Man) archive
system.  Large capacity, eh?  It fills the center of a gas giant moon.
Doc Smith would have been proud, eh?  ;-)

     Now that I think about it, this could be more generally expressed
as, "What kind of data format is used in Traveller technology?"  Sure,
an 8-bit byte is a _de facto_ standard today, but it doesn\'t necessarily
*have* to be (at one time, it wasn\'t).  Also, does one "byte" correspond
to one text character, or are all files stored in a binary form that
includes some user-transparent data compression?  If so, do you express
the capacity of storage media in arbitrary-number-of-bits units (i. e.,
its physical capacity) or the amount of data that can be compressed
onto it (its *practical* capacity).  Heck, with lharc, I can squeeze
1.8 Mbytes of (text) data onto one 880 Kbyte Amiga disk.  Could a TL 15
mass storage system do any less?

     Lora  was bored.  Everyone had gone off leaving Daegaer  for 
company.  She wandered about the ship,  Daegaer following.  "Your 
great company,  you know,  Daegaer",  she told him. "A barrell of 
laughs."  He stared blankly at her.  "Go on,  find something that 
doesn\'t work.  I will fix it." He held out a snapped stylus. "Oh, 
very  funny." She wandered back to engineering and pressed a  few 
buttons at random,  then reset them.  "Go on,  I\'ll close my eyes 
and you twiddle a few knobs",  she shut her eyes.  Daegaer turned 
off the light.  "Gee,  that\'s a difficult one", she said, turning 
it  back  on.  She pulled out a reference manual.  "Lets  see  if 
everything meets its tolerance levels." She leafed through a  few 
pages,  "Go  get  me  a welding  kit,  a  fire  extinguisher,  an 
impedence  tester  and  a milkshake." He sighed  and  loped  off. 
"Strawberry!", she yelled after him.

     She  turned  the  power plant on and  began  increacing  the 
energy  flow.  "Just  a  shade below red." Daegaer  returned  and 
dropped  the items.  "Lighting system should be able to take  0.3 
mega-watts",  she  said  around  the straw.  She  flicked  a  few 
switches  and  the lights glowed a very  intense  white.  Daegaer 
gasped and covered his already shaded eyes.  "Sorry!" She  turned 
them off.  "Lets see,  circulatory fans on max." Daegaer held his 
head as she made the connection and flicked the switch.  A gentle 
wind  began  blowing  through  the  ship,  gradually  increacing. 
"Wheee!",  cried  Lora.  She turned it off as the manual\'s  pages 
began  to  blow about in her hands.  Daegaer sat back up  in  his 
seat.  "What next?  Purefication plant? Boring. Air conditioning? 
Never did like snow...  Hull bonding?  Hmmm... enhances molecular 
bonds  in  crystal structure of hull,  three mega-watts."  Daeger 
whimpered  quietly.  "Did you say something?" He shook  his  head 
rapidly. "I know you can talk. Why do you play mute?" She sighed. 
"Lets  give it a go." She twisted a few wires together and  threw 
the  switch.  An  almost subsonic throb echoed and  quickly  died 
away.  Lora  raised and eyebrow and flicked the switch off and on 
again.  The low noise reverberated throughout the ship. "I\'ve got 
an idea."

     She  unwired  the console and set up a small circut  to  the 
power  flow controler.  She set it to one megawatt and  activated 
it.  The  monitor filled with a square curve and around them  the 
hull emitted a vibrant tone.  She smiled.  "Go to stores and  get 
forty  mertre  of six core cable",  she instructed  Daegaer.  She 
dismantled  the  temporary  circut  and  began  studying   wiring 
diagrams.

     She worked rapidly most of the afternoon, Daegaer catching a 
bit  of  her  excitment.  Dashing here and  there,  fetching  and 
carrying tools. In late afternoon the sun was setting. They stood 
on the hot cement to one side of the ship.  A thick cable drooped 
out a hatch and ran to a set of many switched boxes that  Daegaer 
sat  at.  A  thin  wire  lead to the final  aparatus  which  Lora 
carried.

     "Stoke her up",  she said.  Daegaer gingerly turned a  knob, 
watching  the head shimmer radiate off the engines.  "Connect the 
interface."  He threw several large switches.  "Engage  filters." 
Her activated these and his hand hovered shaking over a large red 
button. "Activate", she whispered. He pushed it.

     She savoured the moment of silence,  then leaped in the  air 
bringing  her hand down shaply on the string of her  gitaur.  The 
sound  blasted from the hull\'s surface area and exploded over the 
whole shipyard as she sank to her knees,  fingers madly  plucking 
their way up the nect as the sound rose hight and higher. Daegaer 
clung to the console as the ship slid several inches on its madly 
vibrating  landing  gear.  At  her climax he joined in  with  the 
ship\'s artilery thundering.

     Terry and the others returned that evening to find their lot 
covered in people.  Starport police surrounded the area and a few 
administrators  in business suits were arguing loudly with  Lora. 
Around her several other spacers had turned up and were  chatting 
at  Daegaer.  One  had  brought a howitzer,  another  a  suitably 
modified ultrasonic combat stunner and a tight knot worked around 
a plasma cannon,  making unguessed modifications. Lora waved them 
over.

If you\'re willing to accept modern film/video technology as a starting
point, throw in a dose of computer display specifications, and sprinkle
with a dash of HDTV, we can make a pretty good educated guess.  Let\'s
start with a little biology lesson.

Modern industrial movie cameras record at a speed of 24 fps (frames per
second), while video camcorders are more like 30 fps.  Both of these
rates, if played back to the human eye at the speed they were recorded,
would produce visible flicker.  This is eliminated in video units by
clocking playback at 60 hertz (or higher) and in movie cameras by a
rotating mirror, which rapidly flashes each individual frame 3 times,
producing a virtual playback rate of 72 fps.  playback rates of ~60
hertz and higher are beyond the humans eyes threshold to discern flicker.

Next, there\'s the issue of image quality.  Currently, everyday TV produces
images with a vertical resolution of ~560 lines, which shows up as a very
coarse image if frozen-framed.  Recent research in HDTV (high-definition TV)
produces video images with a vertical resolution of over 1100 lines, which
approaches the image detail in a 1280x1024 hi-res computer display.  Most
people consider this resolution satisfactory.  In fact, doubling THAT
resolution would produce images which are literally photographic quality.
Also, the number of simultaneously presentable colors affects image
quality.  Modern hi-res computer workstations (Silicon Graphics,  DEC,
Hewlett-Packard, Sun, et.al.) use 24-bit \'true\' color to produce photo-
realistic images.


Given these boundary conditions (pixel depth, image dimensions, and
number of frames per second), we can estimate the amount of storage
neccessary for 5 hours of continuous visual data.  Figure 24-bit pixels
in a 1024x1024 image, scanned 60 times per second, and you end up with
1,509,949,440 bits of data per second.  Multiply that by the number of
seconds in 5 hours (18,000) and you get 2.7179 x 10^13 bits of data.
To put this into perspective, think of it as 41,180,439,290 pages of
text (66 lines, 80 columns wide), or 73,800 copies of the entire
Encyclopedia Britannica! And this is just for a silent movie, so far.
We haven\'t even touched on the subject of storing a parallel soundtrack.

These are all valid points.  Even today, it\'s becoming obvious that an
8-bit byte is far from sufficient for even simple text storage.  The
increasing problems of internationalization (or I14N, as people refer
to it) show that 16-bit NLS (National Language Support) is neccessary
to represent far eastern character sets such as Kanji, Katakana, Hiragana,
Triad-Chinese, etc.  Add to this the fact that most western font sets
are very generalized, or VERY specialized, and you end up with lots
of missing special characters.  For example, it\'s impossible for a
single 8-bit font to fully support both English and German, and still
contain all the standard punctuation characters we\'re all used to.



For a single font set to support all existing languages on the planet
right now, a 16-bit font would be hard pressed to serve.  24-bits would
definitely do the job.  I cite even multiples of an 8-bit byte only
for historical reasons.  There\'s no reason that 19, 23, or 26 bits wouldn\'t
work just as well.  However, since computers (at least existing ones)
are binary by their very nature, it seems that using an even power of
2 would facilitate whatever storage scheme you eventually use.  How
you choose to compress this data is left as an exercise to the reader. :-)



Regarding the compression of image data, I offer only one tantalizing
point.  Recent date compression reseach has demonstrated that very
complex natural images (a fern, a tree, a mountain skyline) can be
reduced to a single factal equation for storage, and then reproduced
in total detail, with no loss of resolution.  Optimists suggest that,
eventually, more sophisticated methods will be found which allow ANY
image to be stored in fractal form.  This form of compression results
in a storage space reduction several magnitudes of order smaller than
the original image.  The current drawback is that discerning the correct
storage fractal is very hit-and-miss, and deriving it is extremely
time-consuming.  Some images fail to be fractally compressed.



However, let\'s assume that eventually fractal compression becomes
common-place.  Presumably, each 1K x 1K x 24 image (discussed earlier)
could be reduced to, say, just under 1K of compressed data.  If we
further assume that compression could be done real-time, then that holo
crystal could be a lot smaller, and still hold 5 hours of data.  Now,
instead of having to hold 2.7179 x 10^13 bits of data, it only has
to hold 1,105,920,000 bits of data (138,240,000 8-bit bytes).



I don\'t know about you, but I always assumed that these crystals were
about half the size of a standard domino.  Considering that modern
high-density 3.5" floppy discs can already hold over 1 Mb. of data,
This only represents a 2 order of magnitude improvement in data storage
density, which doesn\'t seem at all unreasonable to me.



If we assume that one of these 5-hour holo-crystals is 1x2x4 cm., then
the total number of them in a cubic meter of crystal would be 100 x 50
x 25, or 125,000.  If we assume that each crystal can hold 2.7179 x
10^13 bits of data, before fractal compression, then you have 3.3974 x
10^18 bits of storage per cubic meter.  Since volume of a sphere is
stated as 4/3 pi R^3, where R (in this case) is 50,000 meters, the
total volume of a 100 Km. diameter sphere is 5.2360 x 10^14 cubic
meters.  Multiply that by the storage capacity per cubic meter, and
you have a total storage capacity of 1.7789 x 10^33 bits.

Now THAT\'s entertainment.

in cover price to $5.95 per 52-page issue.



Next, we are dropping our concept of the Journal being a magazine, and
thinking of it more as a product.  We are viewing it more as a semi-regular
resource book.  Consistent with that philosophy, all issues of the Journal
from 3 and beyond will be double-sized (104-pages) and cost $12.95 -- just
like a product.  This Journal will have minimal ads (no more convention
notices or fanzine ads), and it will appear twice a year (more or less).

Finally, few good writers are coming forward to write TRAVELLER articles
for us.  That means we have to fill the space ourselves.  Not that we don\'t
enjoy doing that, but we are spread pretty thin as it is already.  We want
the freedom to be able to produce a Journal when we have enough material to
fill it -- thus no required release frequency and no subscriptions."



Well, I don\'t know about the rest of you, but I have real mixed emotions
about this.  On the one hand, I think it\'s probably a very good idea, and
issue quality, which is already excellent (more on this later), will almost
certainly get better.  On the other hand, I don\'t know whether I can stand
the wait between issues! :-)  Recent issues of Challenge have been so
scattershot, contents-wise, that I\'m really beginning to question it\'s
usefulness as a MT information resource. Lately, I only buy it for the
Traveller News Service articles (Chorus: "Yah, sure!  Go ahead, pull the
other leg!!")  Okay, okay, so I\'m an MT junkie.  We\'ll just have to see
if I can last between these drawnout issues of MT Journal.

As for the first issue, well it\'s everything Steven Fellows described and
then some!  As he mentioned, it\'s cover price is $5.95 and issue 2 should
be the same.  Then (according to the above notice), issue 3 and later will
cost us $12.95.  Oh well, as long as it\'s only twice a year, sigh. :-)


The cover art is as good or better than any Traveller\'s Digest has ever
had, and includes a creature referred to in the credits as "a Khethss
from Giranima".  I can\'t find a reference to this race anywhere in my
MT stuff.  Maybe our esteemed Traveller Historian can help out (how
about it, Metlay?).



The Domain of Deneb pull-out map is very sharp.  It actually includes
all of the Spinward Marches, Deneb, the Trojan Reach, and Reft Sector,
on a single page.  It includes X-boat routes, borders, allegiance codes,
names and starport types for all listed systems.  Everything but the actual
UWPs are listed.



If this issue is a typical sample of following volumes, then we all have
a lot to look forward to.  It is definitely a "use everything, waste nothing"
magazine.  Articles include a very complete planetside adventure on Wardn
(1727 Spinward Marches), and A Concise History of the Rebellion (as Steve
already mentioned) with a detailed rebellion time running from 1103
(Dulinor\'s elevation to Archdukedom) to 1120.  There is also a detailed
guide to both the Domain of Deneb circa 1120 (hence the pull-out map),
a world guide to Enaaka (Deneb 0203), an interview with Norris (ala Rebel
Reporter), and finally (my personal favorite), a lengthy article on the
niceties of battledress (what can I say; I\'m a hardware junkie, too).
The illustrations in that article alone are worth the price of admission
(if you ever wondered how somebody gets into one of those things, this
will answer your questions).


Finally, in the back of the issue, there\'s an article on a subject
near and dear to all of us (well, MOST of us, anyway): "Shareware:
MegaTraveller Computer Aid Directory".  It explains why DGP doesn\'t
offer MT software gaming aids (low return-on-investment), but how
they\'re going to start reviewing some of the better software they
receive from MT buffs, and how you can lay your hands on the stuff.
Since some of you may entertain thoughts of writing and selling your
own MT computer gaming aids, here\'s the ideal forum for "free advertising",
assuming, of course, that your application makes the (subjective) quality
cut line.

Anyway, check this first issue out for yourself.  And then be prepared
to wait a while for number 2.


                        "Wait a minute.  They\'re selling us replacement
                         parts AT COST?!?  Something stinks here.  LSP
                         NEVER sells *anything* \'at cost\'!"

I have accumulated another batch of vehicle designs, and figured I might as 
well distribute them.  The three Type A variants should be of some use in 
adventures.  I\'ve noted what the actual thrust would be, figured on the
1 Maneuver unit=650tons basis, and you\'ll see that Maneuver-1 vessels have
a slight problem when it comes to planetary landings.

Frenetic Armored Car TL10



     The Frenetic is an inexpensive armored car designed to mount a VRF gauss 
gun.  The gun accounts for almost 2/3 of the vehicle cost. A sealed environ-
ment system is installed for use in chemically or radioactively contaminated 
environments, and auxiliary oxygen tanks can be installed to permit operation 
in non-breathable atmosphere or vacuum.  This results in a decrease in endur-
ance to 40 hours.

Tiremese Termagant class Fighter TL11


     The Termagant is a long endurance light fighter built by a consortium of 
the independent governments of Tirem.  It can be operated by a single crew-
member, but usually carries two on routine long duration patrol missions.  
This requires double occupancy of the accommodations, and results in a high 
sociability rating being advantageous for selection to Tirem\'s fighter serv-
ice.  With no requirement to provided an atmospheric combat capability, the 
designers elected to avoid streamlining in favor of ease of construction. 
Termagant flyers usually call their craft "Uglies".  Use of this nickname by 
the non-Termagant community is not tolerated.

Derwent class Merchant TL11
     The Derwent class is a common Type A merchant variant.  It is fitted 
with a reasonable anti-piracy weapons package, typical for the current unset-
tled times in the Imperium.  No accommodations for passengers are provided, 
but Derwent operators who are shorthanded occasionally carry a middle passen-
ger or two.

Rummelhart Tracked ATV TL12

     The Rummelhart (named for a large shaggy herdbeast of Trin, noted for 
its toughness and endurance) is a fairly ordinary tracked ATV, useful for
situations in which a flying vehicle would be inappropriate.  Originally 
designed on Trin in 887, the Rummelhart is now produced under license on 
several planets in the Spinward Marches, particularly Lunion and Strouden.  
Common field modifications include addition of light armament or cranes, 
rearrangement of the accommodations and cargo space to include bunks, and 
installation of specialized sensors.

Stiletto Light Grav Tank TL14

     The Stiletto is a light grav tank still found equipping second-line 
units of the Imperial Army.  Its small size, high speed, and extensive defen-
sive suite make it survivable in a modern battle.  Cramped accommodations are 
somewhat less popular among the crews.

Type Y Yacht TL15

     This version of the Type Y Yacht appears in the shipbuilding catalog of 
ConTech of Glisten.  The most unusual features of the design are the dome 
airframe hull for rapid transit on planet and provision of a 8x6x2 meter 
swimming pool.  The pool is part of the central atrium around which the five 
passenger staterooms are arranged.  Since the craft itself is capable of high 
speed travel, no permanent provision for carried smaller craft has been made.  
The 57kl cargo area could hold a vehicle of up to 3 tons displacement if 
desired.  No fuel scoops or fuel purifier are installed, limiting operations 
to civilized systems.  Cost of fuel was considered to be no object for anyone 
wealthy enough to own one of these.

    Notes: This was designed using the usual design rules, but evaluated 
using my "1 drive unit=650 tons thrust" method to calculate airspeed.  In 
this particular case, since there are a large number of low density compo-
nents (fuel and staterooms in particular), this results in a performance 
substantially better than the rough estimate provided by the Drive=3 rule.  
The yacht as given in the Imperial Encyclopedia is apparently plagued by a 
number of typos, as I don\'t think it has enough fuel or power to support the 
Jump-4, Maneuver-4 set-up shown.  In Classic Traveller, I believe a Yacht was 
a jump-1, Maneuver-1 vessel, but it seemed to me that that could be bettered.



Stalwart Heavy Tank TL5
     The Stalwart is a heavy tank from the lowest tech level at which such 
vehicles are commonly used.  It mounts a large howitzer in a rotating turret, 
and two machine guns (bow and commander\'s). Because of the ability of the 
16cm howitzer to penetrate an unarmored starship hull, this vehicle is com-
monly found in a starport guard role on low tech worlds.

Type A Free Trader TL10

     This is a fairly standard Type A free trader, with the only changes to 
the basic package being the wedge form hull and the two dual turrets, each 
with a missile rack and a sandcaster.  Free trader crews with members who can 
double as gunners (such as the steward and perhaps the engineer) can allocate 
additional staterooms to passenger service.  The standard grav maneuver drive 
system loses efficiency beyond a gravity well, and only provides 0.95Gs of 
acceleration when the vessel is fully loaded.  This limits the vessel to use 
of orbital port facilities when carrying cargo to or from earth-size planets.  
The ship can make 1.5Gs empty, which allows for landing when necessary.

     The vessel\'s control system is sufficient for installation of a more 
powerful weapons system.

Type S3 Naval Scout TL13

     The Type S3 Scout was built to an Imperial Navy specification for a 
light fleet scout.  Based on the standard Type S design, the S3 includes a 
larger jump drive, electronic countermeasure capability, and a redundant 
sensor and communication suite. A typical mission might involve two or three 
S3s that would jump to the outskirts of an enemy held system, refuel clandes-
tinely, monitor enemy broadcast communications, and identify forces with 
passive detection gear.  If something vital were learned, or at a scheduled 
time otherwise, one of the ships would jump outsystem and report, leaving the 
other(s) to continue the surveillance.  A full tank of fuel would allow 
operation of the life support and sensor systems for over 300 days with no 
other use of power.

     This is a basic Type A free trader, typical of those produced by low 
tech systems in secure areas prior to the Rebellion.  No weapons are in-
stalled, but the control system has sufficient excess capacity to accept the 
installation of any practical armament package.  The hull design is optimized 
for ease of construction.  Thrusters provide a reasonable deepspace accelera-
tion of 0.94Gs, but it should be noted that this is not sufficient to lift 
the fully loaded craft from a size 8 planet.  Planetary landings while empty, 
for crew vacations, passenger loading or maintenance are possible.

Hello, everyone!

  I am looking for the following info. If anyone has good pointers too it, or 
even an on-line copy, it would be greatly appreciated.

	1) Any and all \'official\' subsector names (except Spinward Marches).
	2) A list of what all of the allegiance codes in the Sector data files
	   mean.  
	3) Is there any way to tell which planets in the Sector data files are
	   capitals?  (Sector and subsector capitals)

  If any of this info is in the Rebellion Source book, don\'t worry about it, 
as I should have a copy soon.


Thanks!

Just received Challenge 48 in the mail from GDW.  In the "From the Management"
section it states: "We\'re going monthly starting in July."  



This is good news, because now they are going go head to head with Dragon
and White Dwarf.  I always found Challenge to be a decent mag.  While it
does cover many other games other than MegaT, I do think their other
material is quite interesting.  It will be nice to get a science fiction
gaming mag once a month.  My roommate gets Dragon, but that doesn\'t cut the
cake for a science-fiction gamer (even though they said in their last
editorial they were also expanding to include sf.  I doubt that will
last).



Bad news, because I just sent in a subscription which I thought would last
a year.  Even though the subscription was paid by using gift certificates
it looks like I will have to renew in August.  They also mistakenly sent me
47 on my subscription, which I told them I already have.  Oh well, I\'ll
just give it to one of my players.

Speaking of which, I have to say that their mail-order is quite efficient.
I sent them my order (60 dollars of 65 dollar total was paid using gift
certificates) less than 2 weeks ago.  I was quite surprised to see it so
fast.

I just recently figured out how to access the archives, and spent most of
last weekend reading through everything prior to my arrival on the scene
in June 1990.  (Seems like I\'ve been here longer...)



A question which was discussed at great length was appropriate size or budget
of naval forces.  It was agreed by all that the Trillion Credit Squadron 
rules gave ludicrously large results (I know...ask me about the navy for Narsil
- - --Pop A--sometime), and that the Striker rules, while moving in the right
direction, were still too generous.  What does anyone feel is a reasonable
force level for a population 9 TL15 planet?  If we got the results in terms
of total spending, how much would be devoted to which services?  At TL15 is
there any use for infantry, apart from suppressing low tech natives, standing
guard duty, and occasional police work?  Would low tech planets actually
bother maintaining any sort of military forces beyond the bare minimum 
required for maintaining order, knowing that any reasonable attack by a
higher tech neighbor would result in a rapid defeat?  (U.S./Iraq)  Balkanized
worlds would obviously be a special case here.

Has anyone been following MT discussion on GEnie?  I have an account there
now, but don\'t have the funds to spend on Scorpia time.  Have any interesting
files been uploaded there lately?

Is anyone planning on attending Origins this year?  We really ought to plan
some sort of get together, there and/or at the World SF Convention in Chicago
over Labor Day.  Keep it in mind...

Whoa!  A holocrystal holds 5 hours of HOLOGRAPHIC video.  I think the
parallel soundtrack is nothing compared to the fact that this data is
3-D.  The picture is likely to be 1024x1024x1024.  Multiply that number
by another 3 orders of magnitude to get 2.7831 x 10^16 bits (3,240,000
Gigabytes) if the data is uncompressed.

Actually, fractals are really just the beginning.  There are many amazing
compression techniques which are just being developed now.  For instance,
you can time-compress pictures for a tremendous savings, and without
using nearly as much CPU time as fractalizing would take.  For example,
you might fractally draw a picture once, then move regions of the picture
from frame to frame.  Any compression technique like this would incorporate
a way to patch the new frame, so that you can optimize between drawing new
parts of the picture and moving the old ones.



You could also get even better compression ratios with 3-D fractal 
expansion (although not enough to out-weigh the fact that the picture is
3-D as opposed to 2-D).  There are many other compression techniques, too.
For instance, you could take advantage of things such as locality of color,
which might let you use 8 bits instead of 24 bits (or something like that)
to represent colors).



We could also probably assume that maximum compression is available, no
matter how much processing power is needed.  Computers are bound to be
pretty fast by that time (even hand-comps).



The question remains -- how much compression can we get?  Uncompressed,
the images might take 3 million billion bytes.  I can\'t tell you how
much all of the compression techniques give you, but lets assume that
fractalizing gives you a 32 K to 1 savings, time-compression gives you
a 128 to 1 savings, and various other methods such as color-compression
give you a further 32 to 1 savings.  Wow!  Already down to 25,920,000
bytes!  Of course, this is a very rough estimate, but entirely feasible.
Also, this would be an AVERAGE.  You could get better or worse
compression depending on what you\'re recording.  Hopefully, compression
techniques will have advanced enough to cover just about all cases by
then.

Well, 3 1/2" CD-ROMs can hold 250 MB of data.  Assuming they use the
outer 3/4" band to store data (remember that they are only 1 3/4" in
radius), they have about 6 1/2" of surface ares.  A square inch of
surface area would thus hold 40,330,000 bytes of information.  If you
think of it as a square of bits, thats 6350 bytes per side, or 20,000
bits per cm.  Well, that\'s 8 x 10^12 bytes (7450 Gigabytes, or
6.4 x 10^13 bits), for a 1x2x4 cm chunk, assuming that all else is the
same as today except we use 3-D crystals instead of 2-D disk storage.

In any event, that\'s 300,000 times the size I (optimistically)
estimated as required for storage.  You could assume that the (usable)
crystal is 1/40 of a cm on a side.  Or, you could assume that data
compression techniques are much less efficient.



One thing you DON\'T want to do, however, is to assume that you can
store 3,240,000 Gigabytes on a crystal.  You can\'t.  Compression simply
lets you store video, which, if uncompressed, would take 3,240,000
Gigabytes to store.  Pure DATA compression is an entirely different
matter, and in most cases can\'t come anywhere near the ratios that you
can get with video.

Again, remember that fractal and other video compression methods do not
apply to pure data.  You might be able to get this kind of storage, but
take data compression out of the picture.



Using my CD-ROM model, I got 8 x 10^18 bits (931,000,000 Gigabytes)
per cubic meter, for a total of 4.19 x 10^33 bits (4.88 x 10^24
Gigabytes) for the entire sphere.  You could probably increase this
with data compression as well, but probably on the order of 2 to 10
times, not the same level that you can get with video.


In any event:

o There is more data to store than you thought.  I\'m pretty sure that
  the intention was for the images to be 3-D.



o I think that data compression may be able to more than make up for
  it (but who knows).



o Don\'t take fractal compression into consideration when considering
  how much data a crystal can store.  This merely means you can store
  more video using the same amount of data.

Jerry Williams discussed Holographic data storage in the kind of 
detail that I like.  But one other thing should be mentioned:

Packaging


The crystal itself could be 1/40 cm on a side, but fit into a package
the size of a domino.  I could see that customers would want this for
several reasons:

1)  If it is too small, it can be easily lost.

2)  It needs to be protected from harmful elements:  atmospheres, rain,
dust, and coffee to name a few.  (How many of you drink coffee or something
else while you are at the computer?)

Also, the crystal could be made of a material that easily dissolves, and
thus moisture in the air would ruin the surface.

3)  Big enough so that a label can be placed on it.  (Important!!!! Would
not want to load "Debbie Does Gushemegga"  by accident instead of "Fluffy 
goes to the Circus" when showing it to the kids.


4)  A company would never sell a tremendous amount of data storage.  They
want their customers to continue buying their product, so give them 5
hours.  Thus, the chip could be very small, allowing more to be sold per
production unit.  One could say this makes the company more profit, but
more importantly it keeps the cost of the product down (remember your
supply and demand curves , and rate of return from economics?).





Can anyone else think of other reasons why a small chip would be placed in
larger package?  The package could still be the size of a domino, but I
would imagine it would be a little bigger, for the above reasons.  This
would not apply to computers, but then they also might have a special
packaging for the memory.  Remember, the company who manufacturers the
computer might buy its memory cells from the Holographic company.  The
Holographic company might make special memory cells (hold more data because
they are bigger) but they might still include them in some sort of package
for protection.

Does anyone know offhand what the size of an Imperial Standard cargo container
is?  I was toying with the idea of working out the designs for the Tl12-Tl15
equivalents of semi-trucks, cargo aricraft, railroads, or whatever.  There is
a design in 101 Vehicles for a 200ton monster reminiscent of the contra-grav
ships from H. Beam Piper\'s COSMIC COMPUTER (or JUNKYARD PLANET, if you prefer).
That might well be economically feasible, but I suspect there would still be
a market for something in the 10-20 displacement ton line--I\'ve got a pre-
liminary version of a TL13 10 ton vehicle, which ends up with 8 dt\'s of
usable volume--2 3x3x6 meter 4 ton containers worth.

Would cargo really move in human-driven vehicles, or would it be better to
move bulk goods around in robotic railway systems?  That would keep it out
of the sky being used by Joe Traveller in his family air/raft.

Any opinions?

Yes, that was what I meant by saying that the (usable) crystal might be
only 1/40 cm on a side.  Look at modern ICs.  The "brains" of the chip
are often less than a cm on a side.

I can think of several reasons:



o It would be difficult to put a 1/40 cm crystal into a computer and
  expect it to line up perfectly so that it could be read.  You would,
  in the very least, need something to align the crystal.

o There might be some kind of mechanism for actually GETTING TO the
  data on the crystal.  This could be as simple as a lens, or as
  complicated as a laser read/write head.

o By using a standard exterior size, you could package different size
  (in MB storage) crystals into the same (physical) size package.
  Similar to the way you have double versus high-density disks.  This
  would let the same computer read any size crystal (especially if the
  crystals contain their own read/write heads) without requiring a new
  holocrystal reader.

o There\'s also aesthetics.  Everyone thinks of a holocrystal as a
  "crystal".  The packaging might actually be more "crystal"-looking
  than the crystal itself is.  It could also come in different colors
  or shapes.

- - ----

The lens I mentioned earlier gives me an idea of how to label the
crystals.  The label itself could be tiny, embedded in the crystal,
but a lens on the holocrystal could make it readable to human eyes.
You\'d probably have to use a machine to label the crystals, but who
cares?

- - ----

By the way, if you\'re interested, here\'s my idea of a holocrystal:

  Holocrystals in general look like crystals.  They come in all colors
  and shapes, but all crystals have a 2 cm square base,  You can look
  into this base to read the label on the crystal.  To attach the
  crystal to a holo-reader, simply "plug" the crystal into it.  It
  attaches itself magnetically (or something similar to magnetically),
  and lines itself up this way.  Some crystals actually contain several
  "programs".  You can access the different ones by either turning the
  crystal (allowing up to four programs), or attaching a different base
  (if the crystal has multiple bases).  This would be mostly used for
  video (computers could access the crystal randomly), but would have
  other uses (Corporal Flak, switch the computer to auto-evade! 8-).

  The holoreader would be either covered while not in use or would use
  some advanced technology to keep itself free from dust.  I prefer the
  latter, since the crystals could use the same technology.

  Military holocrystals tend to look more like dominoes, with the base
  occupying 1/2 of the face of the domino.  They can also contain as
  may as four programs, but usually only do this by having four bases.
  They would probably be color-coded so it would be abvious which
  program was currently running.

  Civilian holocrystals more often look like cubes or pyramids, but
  come in a variety of shapes, including the "1/2 domino" compact
  crystal which is very popular for use with hand-comps.  The cube
  shape is popular among video libraries, since it can contain as
  many as 24 "programs", although those who can afford a large
  number of crystals more often use pyramids, which are a bit easier
  to keep track of (especially if they are color-coded).

  Military crystal (showing one base):

it would be simple enough to make the connections axially symmetric....

Close.  Actually, I recognize the probable need for infantry/security/military
police troops regardless of tech level.  I just think that at TL15, say, that
those all purpose undersea to orbit grav vehicle are going account for 90% of
your \'army\' budget.

Agreed.  But I\'m still curious about particulars.  Take TL15 again.  First,
would many/most/all governments be willing to use FGMP-15 battledress equipped
infantry for crowd control?  What about armored vehicles?  What does "very
sizeable" work out to in terms of population or GNP percentage?  If weapons
were tightly controlled, one battledress equipped infantryman would be capable
of suppressing hundreds or thousands of ill-armed citizens in unrest 
(assuming you\'d be willing to flame down ritoers, say, en masse).

   But would we see these forces armed with indigenous weapons, or would they
feel it was better to import a "token" quantity of high-tech equipment, along
with the technicians to maintain it, or perhaps even hire mercenary units 
already trained in the appropriate tactics?  A shipload of TL11 Vargr pirates
is going to be an armful for a TL5 planetary army, when the Vargr infantryman
can wear armor that can only be penetrated by the local artillery.  (I know, I 
know--Traveller has a serious armor/penetration imbalance in favor of the 
defense.)

     I like the psychological angle, although I think it still might tend to
manifest in the form of highly equipped (though perhaps not well trained or
maintainable) "palace guards" rather than masses of TL6 armored divisions.

I *think* 4 displacement tons is a standard container size in this game.

Anyone want to think about the economic rationale of these things?

I have been working very intermittantly on recreating in MT the mass of data
and designs I have for various navies designed to High Guard standards in my
area of play interest.  This happens to include the Sworld Worlds, and I sat
down today to see if I could build something along the lines of a heavy cruiser
or so, to be armed with a particle accelerator-K.  This is the largest spinal
weapon available at that TL, and I figured they would use it despite the
widely known drawbacks of PA weapons.  (Besides, the armor levels on many of
my ships have been going down, making PA\'s look a little better.)

At any rate, the Model 4 computer would seem to have a maximum controllable
value of 15,000MCr at TL10, which is not sufficient to build much of a vessel
around a PA-K.  Does anyone think there would be any major structural
catastrophes (-8 in the game system if:

     a) The maximum cp input rule was ignored completely, which in this
        case would give you a huge crew (maybe ok)  or...


     b) Six model 4 computers were installed under the assumption that they
        were two cooperating networked systems and their respective backups?
        In this case, I suppose you could even work out that System 1 was
        responsible for fire control and System 2 was responsible for flight,
        and apply appropriate penalties when one full system (including
        backups) was destroyed.
Any opinions one way or the other?
Does one feel more "artistically" correct?

	Despite the new found predilection for kilolieters I have always
assumed the standard unit of measure, and thus the size of one container
of cargo, in the ton.

	Given the normal 1.5m floor grid one ton occupies two squares
of a normal starship deck. This gives a rather overbalanced crate so my
standardised cargo containers are four deck squares in area and only half
a deck\'s height. There are standards for projections and indentation by
which they could be lifted and stored. All connections are simple mechanical
to facilitate production and repair at all tech levels. They all have a
certain necissary load bearing capacity to enable them to be stacked as
well as a maximum weight for the unit. This is sumarised below:



        Volume of  Shape     Height   Max          Supporting
        container                     Weight       Weight
        1 ton    1.5m x 6m    half    40,500kg     283,500kg
        1 ton      3m x 3m    half    40,500kg     283,500kg
        2 ton      3m x 6m    half    81,000kg     567,000kg
        4 ton      3m x 6m    full   162,000kg     486,000kg
        8 ton*     6m x 6m    full   324,000kg     972,000kg



*The 8 ton cargo container is optional and is generally only supported by
the largest of transports. Class A facilities must be able to handle these
but not necissarily in all berths.



	By simple examination you can see the standard requirements that
cargo bays be fitted with 6m wide doors. Similarly that containers may
be stacked as much as four full sized containers deep or eight half sized
containers deep. The specific density of a container cannot exceed that
of three times water. There are further regulations covering how much
shock, temperature extremes, and so on cargo may be subjected to. These
are very important for insurance reasons.

  To expand on Robert Dean\'s question - what\'s a world GNP? How much GMP
does a Rich Industrial world generate?

  If and when we know that figure we can assume that a world spends some
percentage of the GNP on miltary and security matters.

  On our own balkanized world we would have ranges from 0.001% or so for
Andora (an army of 35 - the band) to 35% of Iraq from 1980 to 1991.

  My fear is that if the GNP be known, most of the naval ships are
horribly expensive. A backward world would probably not have anything
beyond an SDB or two.


  The internal security matters are less problematic - all it takes a
few armoured cars of MCr0.5 each to settle many problems very well. If
there is balkanization then more major expenditures are required. The
jump from "wheeled 25E water hose" to "grav 65E 100MW laser" seems to
be about MCr20 or so in Rob\'s designs. When GvPz Battalions are raised,
Credits roll.

    Regarding RSD\'s further questions.  First off, back to the high tech case:
    While it may seem silly to keep a bunch of fusion gun armed troopers
around for crowd control, remember that all weaponry is relative (this is
a problem that I have with the standard Law Level system, as you will see).
There are both criminals and otherwise law-abiding citizens around in the
USA who have fully automatic weapons or weapons that can be easily converted
to such, as well as all kinds of explosives.  As a result police where vests
and have access to shotguns and SWAT teams to handle such threats.

    Translating this to a high-tech case, a relatively libertarian future
society will have some citizens who are well armed for criminal purposes,
for self-defense, or for recreation, and the police and internal security
will scale up to deal with this.

    Possible Imperium organization:  the IPA - Imperial Plasma-Gun
Association.  Plasma Projectors don\'t kill beings, beings kill beings.

    On the other hand, a government sufficiently restrictive and intrusive
to prevent the citizenry from being well armed would probably have an
internal army like the Soviet MVD for all sorts of uses.  Not necesarrily,
though, as the case of England points off (not perfect, but they do better
than we).

    On the low-tech side, a small high-tech palace guard is very likely,
especially if the rulers don\'t trust the local people, but I think that
the bulk of the army would still be low tech, simply for price\'s sake
(in my universe the exchange rate is more slanted against low-tech planets
than the Trillions Credit Squadron table).  To be honest, I also do this
because I like Byzantine political struggles (between the low-tech militia,
the mercanaries, the mid-tech imperial wannabes, the government trying to
keep them from shooting each other, security forces looking for treason,
etc.  Yes, I do occasionally play Paranoia).

    As for the armed forces being turned completely into triphibious grav
vehicles, I stick with Robert Heinlein (Starship Troopers) and say that
the infantry will always be there.  They\'re the cheapest self-aiming
self-controlling weapons available.

I\'ve just joined the list and am very glad to be a part of the group!



I have one question: Has anyone else out there put together an alternate
damage system for MT?  I am testing one that I think may be pretty good.
I have taken ideas from Striker, Twilight 2000, and Cyberpunk and have
designed a system based upon hit location and damage level.  It seems
to run pretty fast.  



If you would like to look at this system, or would like to pick up copies
of some programs that I have written to help with Traveller and Striker,
you can ftp into my machine at wew.ucc.nau.edu (134.114.32.3) between
9 to 4 MST.  It is a PC hooked into the Internet and should be accessible
mon-fri during those hours.  Keep trying since only one person can get in at
time.  You can use anonymous ftp.



Enjoy!

people who responded via email, but a lot of those bounced.  If you think
it appropriate to post this in the TML, please do so.

known Universe as known in the Traveller mythos, using sector names
scrawled in tiny print on a sheet of graph paper, one sector per square
centimeter. It was a big damn map, y\'know that? Between the veiled hints
we\'ve gotten in the Zhodani, Aslan, Hiver and K\'Kree Alien Books, to say
nothing of the Vargr map that was recently expanded upon in the DGP
Dullboys\'n\'Doggies thicky, there is a chart of space approximately 18
by 11 sectors in a rough rectangle, spilling off the edges of the famous
GDW promo poster showing The Whole Shmear, as it were. Impressive. What\'s
also impressive are the incredible, aggravating HOLES in this map-- I 
rated each sector on a scale of 0 to 3:

0-- nothing known, other than a sector name (e.g. RimReach or Gmbiir!!k)
1-- Star Map published in the Atlas of the Imperium, no other data out
2-- Sector data available, pre-Imperial (i.e. the GEnie archives)
3-- Current data available (via GDW for Hinterworlds, Spinward; DGP for others)

The resulting map is patchy as hell. We have "good" data for the Hinterworlds,
courtesy Challenge magazine; the Spinward Marches, courtesy the MT rules; and
Massilia, whoops, also courtesy GDW via "Knightfall." We also have DGP maps
for Trojan Reach, Riftspan reaches, Reft, Verge (I think), Corridor, and
Deneb. The rest of the IMperium relies on the GEnie archives, not including
the tiny bits of Lishun and Zarushagar and Windhorn that have been published
in various adventures and the Vland sector in the DnD book. Note, though, that
while Ealisiyiw in the Aslan Hierate is modern and we at least have an old
map for Gvurrdon (the Vargr book), there are FIVE SECTORS in the Imperium
and surrounds for which there is no available data at all: Ilelish, Zarushagar,
Dark Nebula, Reaver\'s Deep and Magyar. This is inexcusable!



So, open question for you completists and archive raiders out there: anyone
know where I can get extant official data for any of the sectors not listed
above? And would anyone like to see a schematic view of the BIG BIG picture
here in the TML? Thrills! Excitement! Learn to answer burning questions like
"What do the Zhodani call the Spinward Marches?" (answer: Tloql) and "How
many official names does the Windhorn have?" (answer: at least three--
Galanglic, old Vilani, and Gvegh-Aek) And so on....

After a fair amount of deliberation, TDR administration has decided that,
due to an overwhelming lack of traffic, the TDR SIG Mail Lists will be
shut down and all TDR discussion will be merged back into the regular

TML forum.



Does this mean TDR is dead?  Absolutely not!!  What it means is that the
splintering effect generated as a result of the establishing seperate
channels for developing TDR will be eliminated.  Everyone who is a TML
member will be able to follow (and participate in) the discussions
involving the development of TDR.  "Traveller Done Right" is still a
going concern, and Metlay and I will make sure that any and all reasonable
suggestions for modification and enhancement of existing MT rules will
be rolled into TDR as it evolves.  The archive for TDR will be maintained
as well.  Anyone will be able to submit complete rulesets to the archivist
(me) for review and distribution.  TDR now has it\'s own directory on Sunbane,
for those of you able to access the TML archives.  We will be placing all
reviewed TDR rule submissions in that directory, after they\'ve been evaluated.

So, the TDR SIGs will be accepting mail until midnight, Friday, March 15th,
after which time they will shut off for good, except for the TDR Admin mail
address (tdr_admin@hpcvss.cv.hp.com) which will remain activated for the
forseeable future.  We would also like to thank Burt Choinski, Dan Corrin,
Paul Dale, Rob Dean, Iain Fogg, Matthew Harelick, Tony Hayes, George William
Herbert, Adrian Hurt, Bertil Jonell, Bill Morrison, Rob Poole, Mark Power,
and Eric Sergienko for their heavy participation and for their excellent
input in the areas of combat, medicine, physics, and vehicles.  I\'m sure that
most, if not all, the new proposals will ultimately find their way into the
first full release of TDR (whenever that may be :-)).



One last thing.  We would like to have a set of submission reviewers for
rules submitted to TDR, specifically in the areas of combat, physics,
vehicles, and medicine.  We would prefer reviewers to have some background
in the area they volunteer to review (i.e. combat reviewers should have
a fair background in military weapons, ballistics, and some physics).  I
already have plans for some TML readers to be reviewers, even though they
don\'t know it yet.:-)  If you\'d like to be a TDR reviewer, please send a
letter to the tdr_admin address (shown above) telling us what areas you\'d
like to review and what qualifications you have to review those areas.
Then we\'ll sort out who does what.


Thanks again and remember, the SIGs may be dead but TDR is definitely not.
Keep those ideas and suggestions rolling in!  Don\'t let the concept die.

Later,



	- Mark F. Cook (TDR Archivist)

I have received a request for "Striker", the rules for combat with
miniatures based on Olde Traveller.  Before I do anything about this
request, I would like to ask a few questions.



1.  Is "Striker" still available from GDW?
2.  If so, can it be bought from them by mail-order?
3.  If not, is it still illegal for me to photocopy the game, or
    parts of it, and send them to the person who requested it?
4.  Anyone want to part with an old set?

I\'m not sure if I\'m doing this correctly, but I would like very much 
to join your TRAVELLER mailing list.

Hmmm, I guess, when I sent you the sector UWP listings, I should have told
you about the OTHER file I have.  GDW indexes the sectors on a standard
cartesian coordinate system with Core sector at [0,0], i.e.:



                            +Y
                   --|----|----|----|--
                     |-1,+1|     |+1,+1|
                   --|----|----|----|--
                 -X  |     |Core |     |  +X
                   --|----|----|----|--
                     |-1,-1|     |+1,-1|
                   --|----|----|----|--
                            -Y



and I have sector names for all the sectors from [-9,5] to [8,-6], with
subsector names for the majority, and multiple names (Zhodani, Vargr,
Aslan, Imperial, K\'Kree, Hiver) in many cases.  Interested?

Nope.  Not for a long, long time.

Nope.  See answer #1.

Yes, but that\'s never stopped me. :-)

Not on your life.  However ("Aha," he says, "There really IS a point to
this drivel after all!"), I can tell where you can get mint, reasonably
priced copies of Striker (Original publications; not reprints).  This
is my semi-regular plug for the Weekend Warrior.



The Weekend Warrior is a mail-order only shop in N. Hollywood, California
which carries the completest selection of out-of-print GDW products of
any store on the planet (Earth, that is).  They also carry quite a few
in-print products for GDW and DGP, plus out-of-print and in-print products
from companies such as...

        Ad Technos, Australian Design Group, Avalon-Hill, Bard Games,
        Chaosium, Clash of Arms, Columbia Games, Different Worlds,
        Empire Games, Engelmann Military Simulations, FASA Corp.,
        Game Research, The Gamers Inc., Games Workshop, GHQ, Chester
        E. Hendrix, Hobby Japan, Hero Games, Iron Crown Enterprises
        (ICE), Steve Jackson Games, Leading Edge, Lion Rampart Games,
        Mayfair Games, Nova Game Designs, Omega Games, Palladium Games,
        Ral Partha, Simulations Design Inc., Sho Kikaku, Supremacy
        Games, Tabletop Games, R. Talsorian Games, Task Force, Tactica,
        Thoughts & Images, Timeline, TSR, West End, and World Wide Wargames.

Whew!  BTW, GDW and SPI are so well represented that they each rate their
own separate catalogs.  The GDW catalog that I currently have is an old
one (I gave my newer one to a friend in Norway :-)).  It has Striker listed
as follows:

        Code Year       Title                      Used       New
        ---- ----        ----                      ----       ----
        704  1981  Striker (1st Ed. boxed)        $20.00    $40.00
        704  1984  Striker (2nd Ed. boxed)        $25.00    $50.00

Now I know that sounds spendy, but I bought a new "bagged" 1984 copy of 
Striker (Ziplock; no box) for $20.00 just last summer.  I\'m pretty sure
they still carry it.  The only thing you\'re not getting (as opposed to
the boxed mint 1984 set) is the actual cardboard box and a pair of
six-sided dice.  Hardly worth the extra $30.00, unless you\'re a die-hard
collector.  To avoid keeping you in suspense and longer, here\'s the
address and phone number:

        Weekend Warrior
        8116 Van Noord Ave
        N. Hollywood, CA  91605
        (818) 988-1441

They take Cashiers Checks, Personal Checks, and Money Orders (all in
U.S. Currency only), but no credit cards of any kind.  If you\'re going
to send Cashiers Checks or Money Orders, you can call ahead and they\'ll
hold items for you (for up to 10 days, I think).

One more thing: they also carry back issues of a number of gaming magazines.
These include Traveller\'s Digest, Challenge, and (hold your breath) the
*original* JTAS!!  Be advised, issue #1 (Annic Nova) goes for $60.00 in
mint condition.

I am in no way connected with the Weekend Warrior, other than being
a VERY satisfied customer.

One half of Dark Nebula sector is "sort of" available. GDW had a game
by that name that used a map that bears a striking resemblaance to a
sector map chopped in half! Complete with X-boat routes.

The sort of, is because the map was made by assembling *sub*sector

there is a pattern that "makes sense" for the maps)

     Well, another suggestion for picking up Striker is of course at Cons.  I
picked up my copy (mint, even got the box in mint) after a brief struggle for
around $12.  Actually Striker was bought by a few old wargamers who were 
disappointed (not playing traveller and using it as a stand alone) and sell
them off here.  The good thing is that there usually aren\'t that many people
as fanatical about traveller as the most of us so you can usually get a good
deal.

     Now what I\'m really looking for is these old FASA deck plans.  Just love
those things.  Didn\'t they come out with one for a starport too?  Can\'t really
find these anymore.  Except, last year I went to a con and this guy was 
selling brand new ones from a box underneath his table for $1.50!!!  I just
about picked up the whole box but only got one of each, besides he only had
adventure ship vol I & II, if anyone could help me out as far as finding the
rest at a reasonable price I would aprreciate it.  Well sorry to ramble but
just throwing in my two cents.

DGP refers to bases in Sigma Zephyrus and Theta Borealis sectors.  I
can\'t find Sigma, but Theta is way the heck out on the spinward edge of
the map; Group One used to have a map for it (probably bad now) but I
see they\'ve kept the name.

Still, it\'s hardly impressive in comparison to the seven great Core

roughly explored (probably not surveyed!) a corridor some thirty

assuming that they aren\'t straying much from a subsector-wide area
near the middle, that\'s still a corridor about 175 sectors long!!!
I figure that it would take a ship able to Jump 6 parsecs every two

still planning the eighth one...you wouldn\'t want to leave anything

Hi all!



I\'ve been pretty quiet lately (not at ALL like me, right Brucer?), but the 
fiber optic cable is installed, the local network is running, and we\'re 
attached to the internet!  And as I come up for air, I have Questions!



1)	Maybe I missed a list-explanation of this, but there are TWO Kinorbs
	on the Spinward Marches map: 2202 and 2512.  What gives?  It\'s not a
	really *pretty* name...sounds like something your doctor can remove
	easily with local anesthesia.


2)	Now that we\'re part of the SMART data net, I\'ve been ftpeeing around,
	and I grabbed the deckplans from the sunbane server.  They wouldn\'t
	print.  I used a VAX and an Ultrix system to send it to an LN03 
	Scriptprinter.  Anyone have any ideas for me?

3)	And in the area of contribuiting, I have made up deckplans for the
	Lady of Shallott class Yacht.  It probably violates many rules and
	conventions, but for the role players it might be ok.  (design freaks
	would probably be displeased)  Anyway, it\'s done in MacDraw (damn
	cute little machine has been sitting in my office gathering dust:
	thought I\'d see how it worked...)
	How do I convert from MacDraw to Postscript, as that seems to be
	a format-of-exchange?

4)	And lastly, now that the UNIX box is on the net, I\'m getting TML here.
	A while back, someone posted a digest-burster for elm.  Can anyone
	point me toward it?  I can\'t seem to find it anywhere.  (My accounts
	look a lot like my desk.  And my car.  And my apartment...)



5)	Got the new MegaTraveller Digest.  It gets the Earl of Margesi seal
	of approval!  Buy this, if only for the map of Deneb.  (but there is
	a lot more.)  Oregon seems to suit DGP.

I\'d like to find out a little more...

It is worse than that, the Zhodani only have Jump-5 ships (since they
are TL=14!).  This makes the one-way trip about 53 years (closer to 54)!
And it would be safe to assume that the early trips were made at a
lower TL than the later ones.

Could be kind of fun running into some high-tech xeno-phobic planet
along the way (one that was marginally industrial the previous time
through, could be capable of putting up decent resistance on the way
back).  The supplies required would be HUGE, they mustn\'t have sat down
and worked out the specific details when the figures in the ref\'s guide
were invented ;-}

I think it would make a VERY good scenaro.  A couple of supply ships
mis-jumping about 1000 parsecs out would cause lots of \'fun\' problems.

I\'m *not a lawyer*, and thus you *shouldn\'t believe me*, but as I understand
the copyright law, it is perfectly legal to make a copy for personal use of
a work which is (1) out-of-print, and (2) unavailable at a reasonable
price.  Thus, if you (Adrian) can\'t find a copy of the Striker rules at one
of the places suggested on the list, you shouldn\'t feel guilty about copying
it.



Somebody should just try to get GDW\'s permission to photocopy the thing --
if they don\'t plan ever to publish it again, why should they mind?  (Oh, I\'m
sure you creative souls will all think of good reasons -- it\'s just a
rhetorical question :-).

I have a couple of Postscript files lurking around in some dim and dusty
corner which map out all the sector names I have ever been able to find.
Trim off the margins and tape them together and it makes quite a nice
2-page spread.  It just shows the names of the sectors (including alien
alternatives), no astrographical features, no political borders or
anything like that.  If anybody is interested in seeing these files I
might be persuaded to go and hunt them down.  I can\'t promise they are
absolutely complete because there are some gaps in my collection.

As far as world data is concerned, I don\'t have any more information
than Metlay.  There are certainly several Imperial sectors for which
I\'ve never seen anything published.  I imagine DGP is saving them up
for future publications.  (We probably won\'t get to see Ilelish sector,
for example, until they finally get around to finishing The Black Duke.)

And whoever had the yacht deckplans -- if you can get them in Postscript
form then I\'d like to see them!

        Greetings Gang! Hi Bob!



     A question, if I may... How do some of you handle a Martial Arts
skill? I know that a while back there was an article about MA in
either Chall. or Travellers Digest, but I found it a bit confusing. If
I recall the author equated MA skill level with dan rank. This would
seem to suggest that you\'d need a skill of 12 to be a beginning black
belt!! I must have missed something and the issue is not available to
me at the moment.

     Or, would the Martial Arts be lumped under Brawling, with
extentions to take care of weapons such as Katana (long blade), etc.?
Have any of you done anything with `ninja-esque\' PC\'s or NPC\'s?? Do
you break down the skill among things like stealth, blade, brawling,
etc?


     Sure, a FGMP is great... but sometimes ya gotta be subtle....

*| Have any of you done anything with `ninja-esque\' PC\'s or NPC\'s?? Do
*| you break down the skill among things like stealth, blade, brawling,
*| etc?

*|      Sure, a FGMP is great... but sometimes ya gotta be subtle....

I have been handling martial arts the way the GM I first started
playing under handled them without thinking too much about it.  The
asumption he made was that a brawling of 3+ indicated some level of
martial arts skill.   Increases above 3 were higher levels of
martial arts skill. 



So far as long bladed weapons were concerned, he (and I ) take the
closest weapon covered in the sword, broadsword, etc skills and
applied those.



Funny you should mention Ninjas... He had some character
generation table that he created just for that purpose.  You could
have a Ninja character in his campaign, and parties often had to
deal with Ninja assasination attempts if they got a little too big
for their britches...

HA!  Are you kidding?   GDW hasn\'t struck me as being too

publishing SHAREWARE for Traveller and MegaTraveller they gave me
the knee jerk reaction of "The Traveller and MegaTraveller names

I tried to explain to them I wasn\'t trying to STEAL anything but....

get books 1, 2, and 3, plus the additional charts.  The only difference
between this and the original boxed sets is the missing 2 6-sided dice

The shrink-wrapped copies are now $30.00 (up from $20.00 early last

  I admit that this version of Pixie (Hitech port in on the road from Regina to
Gvurrdon, with a naval base added as an afterthought) dosen\'t match the official
DGP one (Naval Base out in the middle of nowhere) but we like our Pixie the 
way it it is:)

Voyage of the "Gamla Bettan" part Two

                       The Lawyer:

Time: 070-1112  0230 hours Imperial Standard Time

Location: Pixie/Regina/Spinward Marches



The Gamla Bettan and Crew:
   Gamla Bettan (Old Betty in the language of some ethnic worlds of the 
Imperium, Swordworlders might understand it too) is a tech 11 Scoutship about 
35 years old. She is of a variant class and is shorter and thicker than the 
standard Type S, but has the same performance. Gamla Bettan lacks armament.
   Preben Moeller, Scout, 26 years old. Smart but with great lapses in 
education and behaviour in a civilized environment. Trained as pilot and 
navigator. Born in the absolutely worst slum district of Efate. Ran Xboats 
between Regina and Rhylanor for 8 years.
   Werner Schmallhaussen, Major in the Roupian State Security, 26 years old. 
Very good with all kinds of slugthrowers. Werner has been trained in various 
military areas, including infantry tactics, using a SMG, and as a corpsman. 
Born on Roup and currently on extended AWOL.
   James P Troop, ForceCommander in the Imperial Marine Corps, 34 years old. 
Strong, smart and agile, but with a behaviour and language fitting a Sergeant 
Major. Born in the Shionthy belt, and managed to get out. Trained to lead 
marines in combat, but little else useful.





Excerpt from an interview with John Ichiwara after his visit to his 1000th 
world: "Pixie? Yes, I\'ve been to Pixie. A very curious world indeed. Did you 
know that it\'s been continually inhabited by the same family from the days of 
it\'s discovery back in the 350\'s until today? They are quite sensitive about 
what you call them. Remember to call them \'pixians\', never \'pixies\'."



   Three men came walking down the access-tunnel connecting the Scout ship to 
the Eldritch down Starports main terminal. Or rather: Two men walked and 
dragged the third one along rather effortlessly in the low-gee environment.
   "Easy, Werner, The left foot now, and the right one, that\'s right, and left,
 and right, " Preben instructed him, "Hang in there for a few minutes, there\'s 
got to be a medibooth in the lounge."
   "A month from now you will laugh at this story, Werner!" Troop said 
cheerfully as they stepped out of the tunnel and onto a green carpet of grass 
stretching down to a quiet brook a few hundred meters away. Scattered trees 
stood outlined against the deep blue sky, where the clouds formed the words: 
"Welcome to Pixie, Gateway to Gvurrdon" and in smaller letters: "Eldritch 
Starport Authority, Pixie/Regina/Spinward Marches". After a few more steps the 
hologram dissolved and revealed the Starports\' main mall.
   Troop cast a glance around the silent surroundings, "It\'s pretty dead here. 
What\'s up? A local holiday or something?"
   "No, It\'s just that they are going by IST and looking at that clock," Preben 
indicated a large globe bearing the insignias of the Eldritch Starport 
Authority, "it\'s well past midnight." There\'s the booths!" Preben pointed.
   "It\'s never this empty at Regni, no matter what time a day. And I thought 
that Pixie was on a trade-route. Hold Werner, will you?"
   "Sure," Preben held Werner while Troop opened the booth. Even though it had 
indicated that it was currently unoccupied, a semiconscious sentient in Scout 
uniform fell out. Troop felt the smell almost immediately.
   "Shit! Does every scout always drink pangalactic gargleblasters like it was 
tap-water?" he said as he dragged the scout out of the booth and propped him up
against a convenient wall.
   Preben put Schmallhaussen in the booth and explained: "Yupp, it\'s our 
\'National Drink\'. Just like Marine \'Pufferfish Parties\'."
   "Yeah," Troop grinned "One got to have guts to eat pufferfish."
   "The pufferfish got to have it guts cut out, you mean, I guess?" Preben 
closed the booth that activated automatically. After observing that Werner was
in no condition to answer questions it prompted Preben for a case history and, 
most importantly, money.
   "<Beep> Please state full name and homeworld for you and the patient."
   "Preben Moeller, Efate, and the patient is Werner Schmallhaussen, Roup."
   "Please put five credits in the slot and state the patients symptoms."
   "Nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pains and light fever." Moeller 
answered as he put the money in the machine.
   "Now preparing diagnosis..." The medibooth began to hum and buzz as it 
busied itself. After a few minutes it was ready.
   "The Diagnosis for patient Werner Schmallhaussen is severe food-poisoning. 
Do you wish a treatment?"
   "Stupid soda-can. Schmallhaussen said the same thing himself when he began 
to feel ill, and he has corpsman training." Troop muttered.
   "Yes, we want treatment."
   "The patient is unconscious and can not give his consent. Do you take take 
the responsibility?"
   "Yes I take the responsibility, just get on with it!" Preben signed the 
paper that the machine presented for him.
   "Thank you, the treatment will begin when you have put fifty credits in the 
slot, and will take approximately thirty minutes."
   "What? I\'ve already put five credits the damned slot you stupid piece of 
junk!"
   "That was for the diagnosis, Please put fifty credits in the slot for the 
treatment."
   Preben gave in, and paid up "Very well, just hurry!"


   As the medibooth hummed and the intoxicated Scout began to snore, Troop made
a recon-tour around the mall. It looked like every other type A Starport mall 
that he had seen. Built as a big, four stories high hangar, two hundred meters 
long and fifty wide, and with a big houselike structure in the middle. The 
floorspace was covered with various sofas, chairs and billboards, and the 
banks, shops, bars, and offices for the various freight and passenger lines 
was located in the middle \'building\'.
   At the far end big signs indicated that the starport administration could 
be found to the left and the hotels to the right. The only thing moving was 
the occasional janibot that was sweeping the floor.
   After spending some minutes peering through the show-window of a 
Interstellarms outlet, Troop went back to Preben and the booth, his steps 
echoing emptily in the big mall.
   "This place is dead!" he said, "But I found a ironmonger that seems to 
have a good selection, better than on Efate, at least."
   "Don\'t blame me for the curfew, I had no chance of knowing that Ine Givar 
had planned a major bombing-campaign just when we arrived." he continued 
ironically, "They don\'t consult me, you know.".
   "Look, we\'ve got company."
   When Moeller looked in the direction that Troop indicated, he saw that a 
man was walking in their direction. Clad in a strict suit and tie and carrying 
an attache case, he seemed very out of place in the Starport environment. He 
obviously also felt out of place, because he kept looking over his shoulder 
all the time.
   "You want to know what I think, Preben? I think that the booth has snuffed 
Werner and that that clown in the suit is a Naasirka lawyer coming to nail you 
for it!"
   The man was clearly heading for them and Moeller glanced at the booth to 
make sure that Werner\'s values was in the green.
   Troop put on his best \'Macho Marine\' posture and made sure that Werner\'s SMG 
was easily accessible in his duffel bag. The man in the suit almost stopped 
when he saw this, and came up to them hesitantly.

   "Good evening, gentlemen." he began "Let me introduce myself. My name is 
Eric T Sohn, and I\'m a senior partner in the law firm Sohn, Sohn & Sons from 
Regina, and I would like to ask you a question."
   "Shit! It was a lawyer!" Moeller exclaimed.
   Mr Sohn jumped a meter backwards "I beg your pardon?"
   "No, eh, I\'m sorry, we, eh, we, eh, had made, eh, yes! When we saw you, 
Troop thought that you looked like a lawyer and we made a bet! yes, that\'s 
what it was: a bet."
   Mr Sohn looked very confused.
   "A question, you said." prompted Troop.
   "Uh, Yes, a question. I would like to know if it was you three that arrived 
with the Scoutship about half an hour ago."
   "What if it were? We haven\'t done anything illegal, Have we Troop?"
   "Shaddup Moeller! Let me handle this!" Troop hissed in answer and turned to 
Mr Sohn, "I guess that we should introduce ourselves. I\'m ForceCommander James 
P Troop, Imperial Marines Retired, and this is Preben Moeller, IISS detached 
duty." They shook hands.
   "As answer to our question, Yes, we came in that Scoutship."
   "Do the ship stand to your disposition or are you presently on your way some
where?" Mr Sohn looked disapprovingly on the unconscious Scout.
   "No, we are totally free to go wherever we wish in it."
   "Good, good. You may be the solution to my problems. I\'m trying to locate a 
certain person that has disappeared and I wonder if you would be interested in
finding this person. There would, of course, be a substantial reward for a 
successful conclusion."
   "That sounds interesting, Mr Sohn. Can you be more specific?"
   The lawyer hesitated and looked behind himself to ensure that nobody was 
listening before he continued. "I\'m truly sorry, but due to various reasons, I 
cannot go into specifics at this time and place. Could you come to the TAS 
Hostel in one hour, then we could discuss the mission in more detail."
   "In one hour? Isn\'t it enough to do that tomorrow?"
   "I\'m afraid not. I\'m already booked on a flight to Feri which leaves in 
five hours. It is essential that everything is arranged before that time."
   "Very well, then. We have to get hold of a few friends first, but we will 
be there in one hour.

   When Mr Sohn had left Troop began lecturing Preben "In the future, Preben, 
you keep your mouth shut and let me handle all situations like this. If you 
insist on behaving like you\'d come directly from the slums of Efate, we\'ll 
never get a decent assignment."
   "Oh yeah? What\'s wrong with the slums of Efate? I was born there you know!"
   "Yeah, tell me about it. And even if I hadn\'t known I could have guessed 
after listening to your accent and watching your table-manners!"
   "Don\'t blame me for disliking lawyers. We weren\'t afraid of the cops at 
home, there are no cops at Efate, but the corporate lawyers with their squad
of bodyguards unloading from their G-limo outside was a major storm-warning. 
They usually show up to evict you or give you a summons and if their hired 
muscle \'happened\' to bump somebody off they would get you to pay damages to them
for it!" They were interrupted when the door to the medibooth opened and a very 
pale Werner Schmallhaussen stepped out.
   "<Beep> Treatment successfully completed. Have a nice day and welcome back!"
the booth blipped enthusiastically.
   "I guess I ate a little to much at Efate?"
   "A little!" Troop laughed "You stuffed yourself around the clock for three 
weeks!"
   "We have got a mission now," Preben explained as he walked towards the 
nearest public terminal "there is a lawyer," he pronounced it as an insult, 
"that wants us to look for someone. It didn\'t sound too hard." he put a 
quarter cred in the terminal and called up the naval base.
   A sleepy marine guard appeared on the screen "Imperial Navy, Pixie Naval 
Base, Good evening!"
   "Hi! I want to speak with Master Chief Petty Officer Zod Miandwhypt of the 
\'Monsoon\', that\'s a StrikeCarrier."
   "I know what class \'Monsoon\' is," the marine guard answered irritatedly, 
"but do you know what time it is?".
   "Just connect the call will you? He\'s expecting us to call."
   After several signals Zod answered, at last. "Who the bloody... Oh, it\'s 
you Preben, " he looked at his watch, frowned and shook it. "I\'m going to nail 
the bastard who sold this watch to me. Do you have *any* idea what time it is, 
Preben?"
   "Sure, a quarter past three in the morning." He proceeded to tell Zod about 
the mission and the lawyer that they were supposed to meet at the TAS Hostel.
   "Can\'t it wait until tomorrow?"
   "No, he\'s leaving in a few hours. We are to meet him there at four. 
Remember: the early bird get the largest worm and it sounded like this will be 
a very, repeat very, profitable deal."
   "OK, OK, I\'ll try to get there in time. By the way, have you found an 
engineer yet?"
   Moeller answered that there were nobody on the Gamla Bettan that was 
trained for engineering so Zod continued. "You see, I know this Lieutenant 
Commander that was Chief Engineer on the \'Monsoon\'. He\'s an engineer and he\'s 
also quite good at electronics and stuff. He\'s mustering out today."
   "Bring him along then," Preben said "Remember, The TAS hostel in forty-five 
minutes."
   "Ok, I\'ll be there, Bye!"
   "Bye!"

   Erik T Sohn waited until the waiter had left before answering Werners 
question: "I want to hire you and your ship to locate a certain person that, 
shall we say disappeared, twenty one years ago."
   "How much?" asked Moeller.
   Mr Sohn looked perplexed "How much I want to locate the person?"
   "No, How much you want to pay us"
   "Eh, Rather a direct fellow, are you not? The payment is not in money."
   "We don\'t want another ship." Preben cut him short. "And we can\'t transport 
a lot of goods."
   "The payment is not in goods or something like that! What do you take me 
for? A mere merchant?" Mr Sohn looked almost insulted and both Werner and 
Troop furiously kicked Moeller on his shins under the table. "The payment is 
in securities."
   "In what? Zod asked.
   "I cannot disclose the identity of the company until I know if you accept 
the mission or not. I\'m very firm on this subject for various reasons which I 
cannot disclose either."
   "I guess that we have to know some more thing before we can decide, " 
Werner asked, "for example, how big will our compensation be?"
   "About one and a half megacredits.."
   "Each?" Troop asked quickly.
   "Certainly not! One and a half megacredits total, give or take a few 
hundred thousand. The exact amount depends on the stock market, and the faster 
you find this person, the more it will be worth. This is non-negotiable."
   "Hey, We can buy a turret for that!" Zod exclaimed loudly "I demand that we 
buy a turret!" He began to wave at the waiter. "You there! I want a turret"
   "A turret?" The waiter asked when he reached their table.
   "Yes, a turret, don\'t you know what a turret is?"
   "I\'m afraid that I\'ve never heard about a drink named \'turret\', sir"
   "Not a drink, damn it! A turret! The kind with lasers in it!"
   "This is a restaurant, sir. We do not sell turrets with lasers in them 
here!" the waiter answered testily.
   "Please forgive my friend, he tend to be a bit excited at times." Werner 
apologized to the waiter while Troop rapidly quieted Zod using very harsh and 
vulgar language.
   Preben asked if there were any megacorps involved and Mr Sohn assured that 
there were not.

   "Any other corporations involved?" Preben persisted.
   "There is a Reginan corporation that would like that you didn\'t find this 
person, but they are only active in this subsector. They won\'t resort to 
violence, since that would cause them to lose anyway."
   Troop immediate caught on to thread "Any other violence?". He looked 
almost disappointed when Mr Sohn said that he didn\'t think so.
   "I can imagine that the Marine Corps might be a little irritated, but the 
mission is in no way illegal by Imperial laws."
   "This is unfortunately all I can say, Do you accept the mission?"
   "Well, what do you say?" Werner asked them "It sounds good to me. Anyone 
have any objections?". When nobody protested he turned towards Mr Sohn and 
said "Yes, we accept the mission."



   It was very visible that Erik T Sohn felt great relief when he heard that 
they accepted. He looked like all his troubles were gone and a positive outcome
guaranteed.
   "Could we get the whole story now, please?" Zod asked impatiently. "I want 
this over with so that we can buy a turret."
   "If you mention that word again I\'ll tie you to a Yresish ant-hill!" Troop 
threatened him.
   With a worried look at Troop and Zod Mr Sohn began: "We, that is Sohn, Sohn 
& Sons, have since many years represented the Scofeld family of Regina and the 
company Scofeld Investments LIC, that was founded by the late Desmond Scofeld, 
and several minor partners, in the 1070\'s. It growed during the aftermath of 
the Fourth Frontier War and were, in fact, one of the financial backers behind 
Sergei hault-Oberlindes.
   Desmond died last year without heirs. His wife died in the 4FW and his son, 
John, died in a pirate raid in 1093 along with his wife, Melissa U Chorral and 
their daughter, Desmonds grandchild, Tracy Everlyn Chorral-Scofeld. According 
to his will, the same clause is in all the original five partners wills, the other partners would have the option to buy his part of the shares if he died 
without leaving any direct heirs. The money in this case would go to Desmonds 
closest heirs, a bunch of distant cousins of his totally without interest in 
Scofeld Invest LIC.  
   However, in a late addition to the will, Desmond stated that a certain part 
of the inheritance should be used to finance a last attempt to locate John, 
Melissa and Tracy. When this fact was made public the other two surviving 
partners immediately filed a complaint against the will on the grounds that 
Desmond was mentally incompetent we he wrote the addition. This case will 
begin in a few weeks and I have no idea how long it will take.
   The task of locating his heirs fell on us, the Sohn, Sohn & Sons, since we 
were the law firm that he usually had employed. To avoid any conflict of 
interests we had to refuse any other assignments from Scofeld Invest LIC.

  We began the search with a big advertising campaign all over this and the 
neighbouring subsectors with pictures and fingerprints of John, Melissa and 
Tracy, computer-generated pictures of how they would have looked ten years ago 
and today and promises of large rewards for information about their 
whereabouts. Initially we met with little success, but two months ago the 
first reply came in. It was from one of the pirates...
   The pirate, who naturally wish to be anonymous, had settled down on a world
in this subsector claimed to have served with Captain Belit on the \'Barracuda\' 
between the years 1088 and 1094. He told us that he remembered a strange 
episode that took place in 1093."

  "Belit" Troop laughed. "Do you know how many pirates there is that use that 
name?! The Corps have at least fifteen \'shoot to kill\'s out on pirates that
call themselves \'Belit\'. It\'s fifth on the top ten list!"
   Mr Sohn asked irritatedly if he could continue, and when Troop fell silent 
he did.

   "They had been cruising for several weeks without attacking any shipping, 
slowly working their way coreward from their usual territory between Regina 
and Turedad on the Spinward Main towards Feri. According to Belit they were on 
a special assignment that would be very profitable.
   When they reached Feri they waited for a few weeks before attacking a small
Oberlindes liner enroute from Regina to Efate. Belit ordered them to 
concentrate their fire to the crew and passenger part of the ship. Just 
minutes before the liner exploded a smallcraft was launched and tried to 
escape from the pirates.
   Since all space vessels are expensive they captured the fleeing craft 
intact. The pirate claimed that the three persons on the pictures were among 
those aboard that craft, but they were using different names!
   According to him Tracy had not been related to John and Melissa!
   Belit had interrogated all the survivors from the liner who subsequently 
had been spaced, all except John, Melissa and Tracy. The first two had been 
murdered, put in a freezer and flown to Ruie, and the latter lived because the
crew had refused to space her.
   "Most of us were veterans from \'fourth\'," the Pirate had said, "we were 
only in this kind of work because we had no choice. Some of us had been 
commerce raiders, others had taken \'extended AWOL\' from various units. Zapping 
fat traders, and spacing witnesses is one thing, but the suggestion that we 
should space a seven year old kid almost caused a mutiny. But Belit said that 
contract specifically said that ALL persons aboard the liner should be killed 
so we put the girl ashore on Knorbes on our way to Ruie."
   But on Ruie Belit had returned to the ship without money but in a terrible 
mood. They had immediately blasted off for Knorbes and turned the planet 
upside-down for two weeks until the Navy had arrived to chase them away.
   The Pirate\'s career had taken a sudden end the following year when the 
Barracuda was pounced upon and destroyed by another pirate ship when he was on 
shoreleave.
   We, speaking as the Sohn, Sohn & Sons, thought that the matter was solved. 
Tracy was living on Knorbes and it was their low level of technology that 
prevented her from getting in touch with us. But, sadly to say, all our 
investigations on Knorbes came to nought."
   Zod interrupted him irritatedly "What\'s wrong with Knorbes? I was born 
there and look what I am today!"
   "Yeah, a navy geek that would run if he saw a Zho eye to eye!" Troop 
laughed.
   Von Tjaikovskij almost dropped his monocle when he protested "Excuseth my 
humble opinion gents, by what hasth thee against our glorious Empire and it\'s 
equally glorious Navy?" Preben just listened to the accent and groaned.
   "Hey, have your exaltedness ever heard about the Galanglic language?" Troop 
retorted. "No speaken galanglic, eh?"
   Preben felt forced to intervene "Calm down Troop, If Tjaikovskij..."
   "Von Tjaikovskij if you may." Roshel said as he polished his monocle.
   "On my ship you ain\'t von. On my ship you\'re Tjaikovskij!"
   "Oh dear!"
   "As I was saying, Tjaikovskij may be a noble, but don\'t hold it against him.
If he is a good engineer he\'s good enough for me!"
   "You amaze me, Preben" Werner said ironically.
   Mr Sohn almost regretted hiring them but said "Gentlemen! Please! I must be 
on a ship in two hours time and you bicker about accents." In the embarrassed 
silence he continued:
   "To recapitulate..."
   "Capitulation? Never!" Zod hollered but the rest of the crew shut him up.
   "To recapitulate, " Mr Sohn continued, "we had traced Tracy to Knorbes but 
there she had disappeared. Then came our second lucky break. We got a letter 
from Boughene.
   The letter was from a certain Leonides Chubhelm who was working as an 
electronics engineer for Ling Standard on Boughene. He was born and had gone 
to school on Uakye and he had some interesting things to tell us.
   He had recognized the computer projection on how Tracy would look ten years 
ago and gotten interested enough to compare the fingerprints to the ones in 
the old yearbook from the Uakye City Polytechnic Highschool."
   "They have fingerprints in their yearbooks?" Werner asked amazed "Why?"
   "Standard practice to help catch juvenile delinquents" Troop answered.
   "We didn\'t have that on Efate," Preben remarked, "But I never went to 
highschool!"
   "He further told us that she had gone by a different name then. According 
to him she called herself Kiiara Travernier and were supposed to be the 
daughter of a cousin of a captain of a free trader that plyed the routes 
between Efate and Regina."
   "Passing Knorbes!" Troop exclaimed.
   "Exactly! We naturally did a thorough investigation about this \'Kiiara\' 
person and found that all ID\'s fitted Tracy exactly, All documents identifying 
her as \'Kiiara Travernier\' was forgeries. Quite bad forgeries, actually. The 
trader had died five years ago, but we could confirm that he didn\'t have any 
cousins.
   Mr Chubhelm also told us that \'Kiiara\' had signed up with the marines, and 
that he had got a holo from a publication that Uakye City PolyHigh published 
and sent out to all old students every five years with the latest news about 
what all old students did. The holo," Mr Sohn passed around a holo depicting 
ten persons in IMC uniforms standing around a Trepida AFV, "shows the 1108:5 
OCS class of newly graduated marine 2nd lieutenants here at Pixie."
   Once again it seemed that our work were finished. We thought that Tracy 
served in the marines somewhere in the subsector and that all that remained 
for us was to inform her about the inheritance and clear all legalities. Then 
we ran into a wall, again.
   Our message to her, care of the Imperial Marines, was returned with a 
\'Addressee Unknown\' label. I immediately travelled to Uakye and checked with the
IMC enlistment office there and they confirmed that she were in the marines 
after all. They claimed that she had been assigned to Pixie for OCS and that I 
should check there. I got here and made inquiries about her on the naval base, 
but they said that they never had heard about anyone named Kiiara Travernier, 
or Tracy Everlyn Chorral-Scofeld either for that matter. They compared 
fingerprint- and retinal data with what we had and said that they were 110% 
certain that they didn\'t match any person in the IMC living, dead or 
lowberthed, either in the IMC now or retired or MIA or KIA or POW or anything.
   They said that she didn\'t exist.
   I want you to find her!"

This is the earliest we\'ve ever been late!  In the immortal words of
Zben:  "Glad to see us back!"
                             
Actually, I\'m glad I held on \'till Sunday to finish this up.  Got a lot
of late-breaking news from the Doc \'n\' the Dog.  :-)  The Aslan must\'ve
been stunned into silence by the realization of where they were; I heard
nothing from them, so I\'m gonna play them as NPC\'s until they wake up or
tell me to let them rest in peace.  (C\'mon Rob, life is not all battle :-))


When we left our adventure, the Aslan with the unpronouncable names
had just entered the R-alpha system.  The Alcyon had just jumped toward
R-alpha, on their pre-arranged course, and the Imperial fleet had just 
told the Alcyon to heave to.  I guess that\'ll teach the bureacrats...






**************************** We begin aboard the Alcyon ***************



Jordan peers down the halls almost as if he is in a trance. He watches
and waits for any commotions that may occur. After a while of looking
and observing, he puts the helmet to his suit on and double checks his
auto-shotgun clip. 



Motion stirs him into action and he levels the shotgun at the shadow
creeping up the corridor. 



<Click>  (sound of round being chambered)
[GM note - this is our tried-and-true friend who bonked himself with
the desk, and whose name I forgot.]
"Ulp.  Uh, high.  Sorry I\'m late.  Where do you guys need me?"


Horne orders him back to the armory.



Jordan then awaits anxiously but unemotionally for the
next order to be barked out.



- - ----

Zben pays close attention to the countdown for jump. When he
approximates Jump minus 2 minutes, he addresses the computer:

     

"Computer: High speed holographic recording of all data on
bogies coma Imperial. Begin now. Terminate 20 seconds after jump
initiation. Also, prepare to generate 1 kilowatt RF spectrum burst of
white noise, linked to firing of main laser, delayed by.." he stops
and make a quick calculation of distance to hydrogen cloud ".0025
seconds. Use transmitters on Alcyon, and all sub vessels to generate
multi-nodal wavefront."

Turning to the commander "Sir. I\'ve set up an RF burst linked to
the hydrogen explosion to assist with the jump masking. Do I have
permission to engage?" 

<Etienne> Engage.

#####include all the usual stuff associated with jumping #####




<Niishu> 99.99995% discharge sir.  We\'re gonna come out of this jump
within a few hundred meters of our programmed point.



<Etienne>

In a low but still audible voice:
  "If any of us survive..."


[Addressing the computer...]

"Store all sensor data from just before General Quarters until just 
after entry into Jump-space.  Coded \'Imperial Fleet\'.  Correction, 
coded \'Imperial fleet 1\'.  Then cancel all displays of external data 
and return all intership connections to standard communications setup."


- - ----

Cup of chicken soup in hand, Johann is about to begin to speak when the 
lights dim for jump. Surprised, he looks up at the lighting panels and 
begins to speak, and interrupts himself again.

"Dirty panels... I thought the robot cleaned them at least once a week." 
He cranes his neck and looks close at the slowly evaporating thin film of 
frost on the panels.

   

"Oh, It was just the hydrogene." Johann pauses and looks at the floor that 
is covered with ice that has begun to melt. "...hydrogene...".


- - ----

The SubCommander\'s voice barks out on the all-call channel, a bare ten 
seconds after the Jump is initiated:

"CLEAR THE CORRIDORS, PEOPLE! SUBCOMMANDER COMING--"

- - ----

Zben locks down the external communications station and starts restoring 
internal communications, first by running a diagnosis on all systems. 
Turning to Charyn, "Well, we seem to have made another one! You can consider
this your `trial by fire\'... and I think you did a great job. Its nice to
have someone else on board who understand these wave pushers!  Besides," he 
says with a grin, "with two of us understanding communications there\'s a
better chance for each of us to get on an Away team!"
        

Turning back to the console "`course, you being on the Generalist team, 
I guess you\'ll get a good shot at R-alpha anyway.  Lets just hope the 
`shots\' AREN\'T from our turrets..."

        

(To the console) "Computer, run analysis on stored information
reference bogies coma Imperial. Extrapolate speed, trajectory, and
acceleration for each unit. Predict minimum time for each unit to
match system intrinsics, reposition, realign, and prepare for jump to
any sector of Alcyon target system. Store all data under heading

Imperial Fleet 1"



Etienne turns to Commander Ger with a formally correct salute...]



"Commander, request permission to talk with you privately.  I have 
information whose importance I have absolutely no way to judge."





<Zben>

(Turning to the commander) "Sir. I have an approximate minimum turn-
around-and-jump time for the Impers. 7.7 hours.  This does not include 
re-fuel, but does include any jump vector that puts them in the same 
system as R-alpha."

     

Tuning back to Charyn "I don\'t know about you, but I could use a
drink. Soon as we stand down I\'ll show you where the crew lounge is,
if you\'d like. First round\'s on me." (grinning) "I expect there\'ll be
several rounds after that..."





<Etienne>

"Nishu, start briefing Charyn on what happened during the last jump.  
Also point out anything she may not be familiar with about the Alcyon.  
Like our internal commo setup.  Oh, and she\'ll also need to get a comdot 
as soon as possible.  Plus, I may need your input in a few minutes.  
I\'ll give you a call if I do."



- - ----



The airlock door to Engineering opens and Lucan and Dulinor start
to enter the room.  \'Vouf caroms off of Lucan and comes rocketing in at 
his usual dead run....and hits the ice condensed on the deck.


"--THROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!"


He narrowly misses Abuko, bounces off Morser and sends him reeling, skates
past the crew with tail tucked and arms windmilling like rotor blades,
executes a neat half turn as he passes, and slams backwards into the main
maneuver-drive console at about thigh height.   



<Morser>

"Vy don\'t we chust -OOF!! Hah? Vat? Oh, sorry, herr subcommander...it
zeemz power has been diverted from ze deck\'s heating coils for ze
currrrent crrrisis. Ve should haff zat ice cleaned up as zoon as ze
ship stabilizes."



Abuko drops his cup of chicken soup as he hurries to change channels on 
his commdot.  The ice melts in spots where the soup spatters.  



\'Vouf does a beautiful roll across the surface of the console, randomly 
flipping about fifty switches and using the console surface as a launch 
pad, and sails off and past it for another two or three meters, hitting 
the rear wall shoulders first with a crash and sliding to the floor. 





<Abuko>

"Robot! Do an olfactory sample for hydrogene right now! 
Questions: What concentration is it? and is that concentration 
explosive or flammable?"



Bruised and panting, \'Vouf gets his feet under him, stands
up, falls down again, gets up again, and stands with feet braced wide apart
and mailed fists clenched. He slowly scans the room with a feral glare,
silently daring someone, ANYONE, to even SMILE. 



Ian regains hands-and-knees on the deck and looks briefly at the commotion.
"I\'m sure glad Adrian\'s not here, he chuckles."



Leadfoot interrupts reparing the fuel line and floats still under the 
ceiling for a second. Then he darts down to the floor and up to his 
previous position in the ceiling. Everyone with a communicator on the 
general engineering channel hears the answer.



"Concentration of Hydrogene variable. Local maximums close to explosive 
concentration."



<Abuko>

"Redd! Do you know where the environment controls are? Get over there fast 
and purge the air in this compartment! Everyone, evac engineering! You can hook
up the the panels in here through your hand computers or some consoles outside 
this room. Anyway, the only thing that needs watching right now is the power 
plant, and the crystals, so that they really are empty and don\'t hold any 
additional charge.



"Robot! Set routines for work in explosive environment. No saws, drills, 
welders and so on. And try to move as little as possible and don\'t strike any 
metal."



"Bridge, Engineering here. We\'ve got hydrogene in the air so we are 
evacuating engineering to purge the air in here. It\'ll only take a few 
minutes."



Johann opens the main door "Let\'s go everyone. Try not to slip on the ice 
and slam into something metallic..." 



When the expected explosion doesn\'t arrive, Johann makes a comment about how 
good it is that holodynamic controls don\'t produce sparks when they are 
operated and proceeds with the evacuation. When everyone, including the late 
arrived Vouf, is out he scans the room once again and exits, closing the valve 
behind him.

   "Redd, Abuko here, everyone is out now. Clear to purge."



Helping \'Vouf to his feet, Karl suddenly remembers what he was thinking
about a moment ago(possibly a new speed record for him :-), and almost
drops \'Vouf back on the deck while tapping his commdot:



"Herr Kaptain, it\'z prrobably a bit late now, but as zoon as ve get out
of jump, I vould highly advise checking ze integrity of ze surface jump 
vebs. Until zome of ze injured rrecover, ve haf no vay of knowink what
zey found out zere. I also zink zis should be done from ze viewports
of ze other ships, to avoid usink ze airlocks again until ve find out
chust vat happened! Morser out."


\'Vouf tests his footing gingerly, half ignoring Morser\'s offer of help.
When Morser lets go of him to start talking to the Bridge, he almost falls
again, but catches himself. He then gently conveys the still-chattering
Morser out of Engineering behind the others, carefully choosing his footing,
and doublechecks that no one is left behind but Leadfoot before giving an
all-clear hand signal to Abuko.

As the flammable gas mixture begins pumping out of Engineering, he says, 
"Nice job of damage control, all of you. Sorry you got such a baptism of
fire, Mr. Wrinkely--or should I say ice?" His smile carries no humor.

He turns to leave. "Dr. Abuko, I\'ll leave damage control in your capable
hands. In the meantime, I don\'t want any of you disturbing Doctor van der
Merwe with questions until he\'s out of Sickbay-- he\'s got a lot on his
mind right now. But for those of you who have never seen an L-Hyd leak
before, let me clue you in: we may see Silvmane again, but MT is dead as
a black dwarf." He sighs gustily, and walks away. 

"If anyone wants me, I\'ll be on the Bridge punching holes in the bulkheads."



*****************************************************************



The Kaekh-oh [hope I spelt it rite :-)] drops out of jump space to find
a main-sequence, yellow-green, star, with no obvious planetary bodies, 
but a higher-than-normal neutrino reading from all directions forward.

"Commander, computer says high likelihood of asteroids and extensive
mining in this sector. . 

"By the Gods! Look at THIS!" Akhouw is nearly dazed by the display
now slowly appearing in the holo tank.  As the Kaekh-oh moves, a thin,
silvery arch slowly resolves before them, from edge-to-edge of the tank.
Almost creeping into their consciousness is the fact that what they see
is as far away from the stellar primary as is the Kaekh-oh.

"NOW we have glory for the clan!"

<Aiwi>

"Wait!  we\'ve got a moving body.  Looks like a shuttle."



<Akhouw> Follow it.





- - ----

"Routine maintenance.  Nothing fun about this except I get to see the
stars.  I wonder why he always has me go fix things, and check the
vacuum zone?  `Doejin,\' he always says `you know you love this.\'  Yeah,
but when does Doejin get to play?

"Hmm, that\'s new - it moves.  Stars don\'t move..." 

Fresh orders pour in - Terminate maintenance immediately.  Return to
base and await further instructions.

"Now THAT is curious.  He told us to expect visitors, but now he says
they\'re here and we\'re not supposed to meet \'em?

"Oh well.  Back to base little chair."



- - ----

<Aiwi>  We\'ve got a good fix on that craft sir.  Definitely a shuttle,
power spectrum is cleaner than anything I\'ve ever seen.  He seems to
be out here skylarking.

Uh oh, he\'s turned toward the . . uh . . ring?  sir.  We\'ll never catch
him, but we should get close enough to find a city.


*********************************************************************

Hearing the latest medical emergency call, Dr. Limner halts (he was
on his way to his grav bus), and asks on the medical channel, "Should
we treat them in engineering or in sickbay?".



Just then, Ian and the medbots go screaming by with Anton, then fly 
back for the next round of patients.  "It looks like sickbay it is, 
then." 



Dr. Limner then heads to sickbay.  He realizes that he is still
wearing his vacc suit, and, although the hood is hanging behind his
back, he looks rather like a diver than a doctor.  Putting the hood
on, he scrubs the whole vacc suit.  Then, putting the hood behind his
head and removing the vacc suit gloves (actually they just peel off
his hands and tuck into the sleeve -- the vacc suit does not come
apart), he scrubs his head and hands again.  He then dons a medical
gown.  Now, with the gray hood hanging behind the white medical gown,
the good doctor seems to have transformed again, this time into some
sort of minister or priest.



As he walks into sickbay, Doctor Van Der Merwe tosses him a crystal.
"We\'ve got another surgeon aboard," he curses.  "If only those @#$% 
@#$% corporate types would give us this info *before* we need it!
This guy\'s name is Yorblin, some scout doctor.  Get him out of the
freezer, start him thawing, and get back here and help with  the
incoming."


- - ----

Lazer continues to stare intently at the tactical screen for several 
seconds after Jump blanks it out.  Then he snaps his head up, glances 
across the other tell-tales, and mutters, "A perfect jump after that 
fiasco. There\'s a god for fools and incompetents, and he likes us..."



Then, the controlled tone of command returning, "Mr. Horne, take your 
team and make sure that bloody airlock is secure.  The telltale says 
it\'s sealed, but then the failsafe shouldn\'t have allowed the accident 
to happen at all.  When you\'re sure, put a security seal on the corridor, 
and we\'ll take a closer look later.  Farouk out."


J.J. stands and addresses the rest of his small fire team. "Let\'s button
up, just in case, and check out that airlock." He spits out the cheroot and
sets the Helmet of his Vacc suit an buttons it down. He chins his comunit
in the Vacc Suit. "Mr. Farouk, we\'re on our way, Horne out." And with that
he leads the other two of his team out of security, to see what the awaits
them at the airlock.





<Lazer>

"Security to Engineering.  I can send down some bodies if you need help 
with cleanup.  Security out."



"Security to Bridge.  Permission to power down?  Security over."



While waiting for a reply, Lazer runs a complete systems check, looking for 
any other damages, corollary to the fuel leaks or the cloud explosion.



The comm buzzes politely, and Commander Ger\'s voice comes through,
"Bridge to Security.  Permission granted.  We\'re clear.  Bridge out."



Lazer nods to Andon, "All right.  Shut her down, pilot."  While Andon 
tends the engine power-down sequence, Lazer resets the safeties and travel 
locks on the missile turrets.



" Security, Thul here, you want me to meet the team at the airlock?, 
Thul over."


"Horne here, fine by me meet us there, this OK with you Farouk?"


"Farouk here.  Negative.  Sorry, Thul, someone has to stay at the security 
post there on the \'Talisman.  You got to blow away that nasty threatening 
hydrogen cloud--let J.J. have his fun closing an airlock.  Farouk out."




After hearing "the word" passed that the emergency is over, Thul
grabs the rectangular device with the three buttons on it and goes through
the choices displayed for him on the console:



	"Weapons>" ----> "ALL>" ---->  "Safe..."
	"Sensors>" ----> "ALL>" ----> "Standby..."

	
	

He reaches over to the corner where his guass rifle lay, removes
the magazine and clears the breach.  He removes his webbing and
mutters to himself under his breath "I\'m getting a little old for
this sheise!"   



"Security, Thul Jonson here.   \'Talisman secured from GQ, awaiting
further instruction."



He walks back to the galley, opens a cabinet, and pours himself a
brandy.   He shakes his head slowly, as he plays the events as he
saw them through his mind.   "Mein GOTT!  That reminded me too much
of the close call we had back in \'58!  We were outgunned then too."



When shut-down is completed, Andon and Lazer drop lightly out of the 
command shuttle, after one last check that the docking clamps are 
properly re-secured.  Suddenly realizing he has no duty left to attend 
to--the EVA obviously being on hold, for the moment--but too wound up to 
do nothing, Lazer jogs off to the security post.



<...>   Farouk to Bridge.  Command shuttle secured; I\'m on my way to the 
\'Talisman.  Farouk out. <...>



The easy run through the corridors does Lazer some good--helps work the 
adrenalin out of his system.  On arriving at the \'Talisman, he summons a 
mug of warm, spicy Tammaran zyder out of the beverage dispenser, and 
drops smoothly into a chair.  He scans the board quickly; nothing seems 
unexpected.  



"Thul, if you still want to, you can go help with the airlock.  It\'ll be 
a couple of  hours before I can relax--I might as well watch the ship."






After the trouble is over, Abdul skulks back from the Talisman to his
cabin, muttering something about having to run all over the place for
no obvious reason.  He remove his vacc-suit and stows his equipment
in his usual hap-hazard manner and starts recharging his laser\'s power
pack [ about time too ].



[ A while later ... ]



Abdul rushes to contact \'Vouf, "Don\'t know if you\'re the right person to
direct this suggestion to but couldn\'t we recommence the bug sweep while
we\'re in jump space?  Give us something to do for the next week.  A lot
better than another silly overly long party."



\'Vouf\'s response is carefully measured... Schmud gets the impression that
the Vargr is very angry about something and trying not to take it out on
Abdul. "NO I\'M NOT-- eh-hrf. No, I\'m not the right person to direct it to;
you\'ve got a Security chief to coordinate with. If you need the voice of
authority, then yes, get on it. But check with Farouk first... I know he has 
at least one team on the job already, Horne\'s people are checking out that
supposedly failsafe airlock that mangled Devious. \'Vouf out."



Abdul, have no fear--we\'ll get back to it.  Just as soon as we get this 
mess straightened out.
Farouk out.



- - ----

"Damn all this...." Christian fervently swears to himself while his
hands are feverishly working on Anton, in a valiant attempt to cauterize
the amputation while fighting the decompression and anoxia damage that
Anton suffered when he lost suit integrity.



"Dulinor, type and cross-match five units; inject 10cc dextranol, we
need to give his spleen a kick in the ass. Monitor fluid levels and push
the plasma, he needs blood volume fast."



The medicomp beeps softly, and Christian pauses briefly to read the
latest update on blood chemistry. Not bad, the critical levels are starting
to nudge upward, but it\'s still a near thing. He stabs at a series of
controls, and a holographic projection of Anton\'s neurological scan fades
into existence.



As he stares intently at the hologram, his eyes widen fractionally and
he is momentarily taken aback. Christian utters a vicious curse as he
punches up a supplementary brainwave scan. "Khakh trrae, gvaekh durrgh! If
I ever get my hands on the engineer/moron who is responsible for the
safety interlock failure..." He picks up a laser scalpel and shifts up to
work on Anton\'s skull. "Dulinor, get the bone knitter warmed up and optimize
it for facial repair." If I didn\'t have enough to deal with -- his damn
skull has a fracture and now there\'s a beaut of a swelling haematoma. He
pauses for a second to gather his wits, then plunges ahead with the weary
work of many hours needed to repair the extensive damage.



Just a few minutes later, Lucan flashes in with the LH2 victims, followed
by Dr. Limner. Christian\'s manner is harsh and abrupt. "Limner, take that
table and get cracking. I\'ll be over when I can. Lucan, get Silvmane
stabilized and then help Limner. Maybe MT isn\'t a total loss."


With accomplished hands, Dr. Limner begins to work on the frostbite
patients.

"Doc, I\'ll start on Silvmane.  MT looks like he\'s in *serious*
trouble," Ian pants.  "Some parts broke off when he slid across
the deck."  And Ian turns to Silvmane, plugs him in and starts to
minister to him, while Lucan and Limner start to figure out what
can be rejoined.



"This is the most ill-fated mission I\'ve ever been on," comments
Limner, while busy trying to get blood flowing back into frostbitten
fingers, "and I\'ve explored scores of planets."



"Well, there was that time on Eriandor 11.  Nobody was killed,
although my assistant Brandon received third degree scalds when the
natives tried to cook him.  Yes, they really tried to cook him alive,
big black pot, and all.



"You see, it seems that they had some odd tradition that you are only
supposed to eat during the daylight.  Only animals eat after dark,
they thought, and animals deserved to be eaten themselves.  It seems
that this race was fixated on eating.  They even had very explicit
social rules about how and where to eat, and about what foods could
be eaten with which others.  Probably very similar to many cultures\'
fixations on the reproductive act.



Anyway, what happened was this..."



Dr. Limner continues with his story for some time while working on
the frostbite cases.  After a few minutes he turns to Ian and
finds him passed out, fallen over Silvmane.

(that\'s what you call a real ORAL SEDATIVE).









(waiting to go to sickbay and learn first aid...)        

Whistling despodently, Alliara strolls to her assigned cabin and
settles for a nice rest with Arbiniik Gruushan\'s newest scout poetry
anthology and her favourite toy: LSP Orgasmo-Cycle Mk. XXXIV (60kg, 4 x

0.5hp motors, direct neural inductors, 30 KW/hr Cr300).

 

As soon as Dr. Van Der Merwe finishes unfreezing corpsicles and
pages her, Alliara will get off the O-Cycle (if not unconscious before 
that) and go to the MedBay.

 





Several hours later...





Doc Van Der Merwe turns back to his work, his face set in a rictus  of 
tightly controlled anger. "Too many good men, dammit.... Too many..." 
He continues to work on Anton, while keeping an eye on Limner\'s valiant 
battle to save MT. His face slowly becomes increasingly tinged with gray
as the work progresses. Eventually, he steps back and wipes the sheen of 
perspiration off his forehead. He soberly looks at Anton, and turns to 
Dulinor. "Take Mister Devious and put him in Unit 1. If he\'s still stable 
in an hour, transfer him to the Alcyon Infirmary."



Christian tiredly shakes his head, and then steps over to Dr. Limner.
It is clearly evident that MT is beyond help -- too much cell damage to
repair; ruptured brain cells, a cascade of pulmonary and cardiac damage
leading to an inexorable final conclusion. Christian looks at Limner, and 
shakes his head. "Lucan, take MT to the (his voice tightens) morgue."



As work begins on Daniel Silvmane, the gloom lifts a bit from
Christian, as it becomes clear that the cryonic injuries are not as
severe as was first feared, but the danger of system shock and gangrene
are still ominous. However, as the time progresses, Silvmane\'s system
comes back stronger than expected, and with the wonders of Tech 15 medicine
the cell damage is regenerated, again quicker than normal. As Christian
finishes up, he remarks to Dr. Limner - "That\'s something quite remarkable -
he must have a strong will to live, I guess..." With several hours of
intense effort under his belt, Christian is positively gray and haggard,
and his mood is subdued and somber.



Van Der Merwe wakes Thomas. "Meet Dulinor in Alycon Infirmary -- we\'re
setting up our hospital care there for Devious and Silvmane. Make
sure it\'s all ok. I\'m going to report; after that, I\'m going off
duty for a while..."



"...is ..."

 

Christian slowly shakes his head.   Ian slowly sinks to the deck.  "Yeah.
I\'ll be there in a couple of minutes."







<...> Van Der Merwe to Abuko, Farouk and SubCommander Bhyarrvouf. Please
      meet me in on the Bridge for medical report. <...>





Many minutes later, Christian slowly walks onto the bridge, with a
slight stumble in his step from fatigue. His appearance is strikingly
abnormal -- his face is gray and haggard, his hair is disordered, and
his expression is grim and shows his weary frustration.



Acknowledging the others with a nod, he looks at Ger. "Commander,
Gentlebeings, I am afraid the n..news is not good. MT is dead -- the
cryonic damage was just ... too extensive. Silvmane should make a full
recovery, but he won\'t be able to return to duty for about a week. He
was damn lucky.  Anton Devious, however..." Christian pauses a second,
trying to push away the mental haze of exhaustion. "... There was more
damage than just the amputation... The b..blood loss and de..decompression
did more damage, and he suffered a skull fracture as well. He\'s in a coma
right now.. (looks down at the deck) I don\'t know when or if he will come
out of it... All we can do is hope.."



He looks back up at Ger. "I\'m sorry sir, it\'s the best I could do." He
stops, sways slightly, frowns, then looks over at Bhyarrvouf. Christian 
say  "Permission to faint, sir?" and gently crumples to the deck.



Bhyarrvouf catches Christian as he topples forward, crying, "Aenrra, 
AENRRA!"  He lurches backward under the big man\'s weight, then eases 
him into a shoulder assist. "Permission denied," he whispers. "Not until 
I get you back to your cabin, you moron. Tsakha, what an idiot...."


He helps the half-conscious doctor off the Bridge, tossing over his 
shoulder, "I\'ll see to him, Commander. You should get some rest; I\'ll 
cover the first shift tonight."



Lazer bows his head, "Oh my Lord..."  He gives a quick, silent prayer 
for the dead and wounded.



He opens his eyes just as \'Vouf starts to hoist van der Merwe, and quickly 
steps forward.  "I can take him, if you\'d rather get back to Engineering.  
Unfortunately, I can\'t help there."





 



**********************************************************************



Ayrlathi swings open the wide wooden shutters of the arzeth danunduln
and looks out.  It is sunfade -- Ayrlathi\'s favourite time of day --
and the light is slowly beginning to dim.  He gently takes in the
subtle aromas of the summer evening and listens to the breeze rustling
the taspeln stalks in distant fields.  An irridescent hipsir flits
through the sky in front of him, trilling its roosting song as it
seeks a comfortable perch for the night.

 

Ayrlathi wanders around to the opposite side of the tower and looks
down upon the town of Hilawin.  Here and there, various jijid are
wandering casually about their business.  Small lights are appearing
in some of the windows as the sun steadily disappears.  In the
distance, Ayrlathi can make out two members of the edo najizev
patrolling the top of the town wall, on the watch for dangerous
animals.

 

As the sky grows dark, Ayrlathi returns to the side of the tower that
faces away from the town, and turns his gaze towards the sky.  This
is what he really came up here for -- to watch the stars come out.
He has spent many an hour staring up at the myriad tiny points of
light, and he knows them well.  They are almost like old friends to
him.

 

But tonight something is different.  There is a new light in the sky,
one that Ayrlathi does not recognise.  And... it is moving!  For
several minutes he watches it carefully, his tendrils making small
writhing motions atop his head.  Before long, it passes beyond the
horizon and is lost from sight.

 

Deep in thought, Ayrlathi closes the shutters and makes his way
slowly down the wide spiral stairway.  As he leaves the tower, he
instinctively closes the door behind him and raises the ornate
bronze marker which indicates that the tower is vacant once more.

 

As he walks back towards his home, Ayrlathi is still consumed with
curiosity about the strange moving star.  He wonders whether it will
prove to be of any importance.  Perhaps he should mention what he has
seen to the Ezad when they meet tomorrow...

 

~~~~~~~~~~

 

Rak stands ankle-deep in the freshly-fallen snow just outside the
cave entrance.  His supple neck arches backwards as he stares up
into the night.  Rak rarely notices the cold, but tonight there is
a shiver which seems determined to run repeatedly up and down his
spine.  Perhaps it is not the cold after all.

 

Rak\'s thoughts are interrupted by sounds of shouting and struggling
from the cave behind him.  He looks around to see the shaman Mrog
being dragged out by two particularly burly kythui.

 

"Stop whining, Mrog," snaps Rak.  "I don\'t care if I *have* interrupted
your dinner.  Explain *that*!"  Rak points up to a tiny point of light
moving slowly across the sky.  "What is it, Mrog?  Is it one of your
tricks?"  Rak makes a concerted effort to pull himself together.  He
must not show any signs of fear in front of his underlings, but he has
to admit to himself that this light suddenly appearing in the sky has
left him feeling very unnerved.

 

~~~~~~~~~~

 

Phin Base 1 is always a hive of activity, but today it is doubly so.
Phins are rushing about everywhere as if there was no tomorrow.

 

Ferdy swims into the vast coordination centre and lurks at the back
of the room, observing the comings and goings.  The wall of the great
spherical chamber is lit up by a mind-boggling array of different
instruments and panels, nearly all of them being attended by one or
more phins.  Ferdy has never seen the place so crowded.

 

Eventually, Ferdy\'s curiosity gets the better of him and he hails a
phin who happens to be dashing past.

 

"Harry, what\'s going on here today?  Why all the fuss?"

 

"Come and listen," says Harry excitedly, and he leads Ferdy across
the chamber to where several phins are already listening to a 3D
sonic projection.  "It\'s a deep space sensor," explains Harry, "and
just listen to that blip!"

 

Ferdy listens, and there is indeed a blip.  "Does this mean what I
think it means?"
 

"Yes," says Harry.  "Visitors!"

I happened to drop by the Armory, the local game distributor, this past
weekend, and I noticed a few things on the shelves that might interest
other folks on the TML.  The Armory still has copies of Belter (*not* 
Beltstrike), Asteroid, and Dark Nebula (2nd version, flat box) on the
shelves.  They also had one box of 15mm Martian Metals Traveller figures
(labelled CITIZENS, about ten or twelve people and a couple of grav bikes).
Our local hobby shop grabbed this last, so I could get it for $6.95 from them.
The Armory takes credit card phone orders, and their number is (Whoops! Not 
handy...) available from (301) directory assistance or I can post it tomorrow
if anyone is interested.  I have no connection with the Armory, etc.

Just had a little run-in with the boss that got me thinking about how
difficult a task seems, and just how difficult that same task really is.



Suppose the CO says "Let\'s covert from 12V to 24V to save expenses".
(What he actually said is _almost_ this bad.)  His perception:



TASK:	rewire ship; trivial; int, elec, eng.  3 hrs.  +DM for 
		"doing it as each part comes up for maintenance"
		mishap - inconsequential


In other words, to the outsider, this looks like something that should be
easy, simple, and could be fit in almost anytime.



Now the engineer\'s perception:



TASK:  rewire ship;  normal; int, elec, eng.  3 months.  -DM for
	   "not doing it all at once, thus enabling *all* wiring to burn out"
       mishap  - fateful, possibly fatal





So, how do you folks play out this kind of ignorance in your campaigns?
(This might, or might not, be a PBEM hint.  :-))

Generally, it is the place of a GOOD commanding officer to (a) have
a reasonable idea of the difficulty of most tasks (b) trust his men 
when they tell him otherwise... it is the responsibility of command
to keep the personnel under pressure but not demand impossibilities
(sorry, Captain Kirk, We can\'t all be Scotties). It is and should be
the responsibility of the underling to point out such inconsistencies
and he should be allowed to do so without fear of reprisal. This is
rarely the case in the American military, which is why discipline is
such a mess in many units, or in American business (Except, interestingly,
in most Fortune 500 companies. I wonder why?). The Japanese attitude that
one cannot admit failure produces strong results, and a lot of suicides
and drinking deaths. Make of that what you will. (This may or may not be
a subliminal message to the PBEM ref |-> )

GDW isn\'t so easy to work with sometimes, but a friend DID get permission
to copy the Alien modules for himself. All of them. In fact, he got a
blanket permission to copy anything GDW used to put out and doesn\'t anymore.


As to shareware, well... GDW may not do anything, but DGP does. They are

describe it all in there. Check it out.

	Dieter isn\'t the brightest. This is the character who thought his
hamster was lonley and bought it two more. You have to give him credit
for trying. He is concerned about Annie\'s weight. Being the steward he bought
her several pounds of sugarless sweets (she likes a snack between mouthfulls)
but he thinks she needs more exercise.
	Now swiming exercises all the muscles and is very therputic. They 
haven\'t a swimming pool though and the Chief Steward will hear nothing about
flooding any (not even just one!) of the staterooms.
	They all have ship\'s suits (tailored vacc suits). It says they can
withstand temperatures up to -110oC. So given the large storage tanks of
liquid hydrogen he was thinking of encouraging her to take a dip.
	So the question is what temperature is hydrogen fuel [or methane or
whatever] stored at? How long could Annie swim before it became more than
invigorating [she has lots of her own insulation]?

Liquid Hydrogen boils at 20 Kelvin.  This is -253.15 degrees Celsius.
This is also -423.67 degrees Fahrenheit.  This is at 1 atm pressure.


Liquid Helium is the coldest liquid at 1 atm.  Its boiling point is 4.25
Kelvin.


A suit that is safe to -120 degrees Celsius will not protect the person
from liquid Hydrogen.  Now , if you raise the pressure it is possible to 
increase the temperature, but at the point that it would be safe to enter, 
the pressure would probably be too high.


Lower the pressure, lower the temperature, for those of you who want to know.

			*** HANDY DATABASE ***



Use as much or as little data for each sector as you wish. I have tried
to be as thorough as possible in listing references, and I expect all you
little munchkins to doublecheck my every word and number, okay?



Here\'s a key to the listings, with a sample listing to give you a feel for how

to read them: 



KEY



The first number is the sector\'s location on the Handy Chart. Note that the 
entirety of known space is represented on the grid, with the exception of a 
corridor approximately one sector wide and many, many sectors long stretching 
from the coreward border of the Zhodani Consulate halfway to the center of the 
Galaxy. Nothing is known of the territory of this corridor yet, other than a 
few names of administrative districts and one fully-colonized sector, called

            (We anticipate more information on this and other boundaries, in a 
promised but not yet scheduled book on frontier explorations from DGP.)



The NAME is given in capital letters, followed by alternate names where known.
The first name listed is in capitals, and is the prevailing name in use in the 

Imperium, NOT necessarily that used by the natives of the sector, although for 
sectors far removed from the Imperium that is often the default. The codes for
the various languages are:



A - Aslan (Trokh)
B - Bilandin (old high Vilani)
I - Imperial (Galanglic: used for Solomani and Hiver sectors as well)
K - K\'Kree
V - Vargr (usually Gvegh)
Z - Zhodani



The next line lists the pertinent data available, followed by the reference 
where it may be found and the amount of the sector covered by the reference
listed. If there is no second line, that means nothing at all is known about
the sector except its name(s), a fairly common occurrence due to the inclusion 
of wide-ranging sector maps in many of the Classic Traveller Alien Modules.
Names for core-spinward sectors are from the Zhodani Module (4), coreward 
sectors are named in the Vargr Module (3) and in the Vilani and Vargr book,
core-trailing sectors are named in the K\'kree Module (2), rim-spinward sectors
are named in the Aslan Module (1), and trailing and rim-trailing sectors are 
named in the Hiver Module (7). The Solomani Module (6) contains no new data of 
this type, largely overlapping with the Hiver and Aslan maps, and the same is 
true for the map in the Droyne Module (5). 



The data codes are:



SC Star Chart-- usually includes presence of water or asteroid belts, starport
   type, allegiance code (may be wrong if map is from Trav Classic), gas giant
   and bases if any. Names are only available for High-Population worlds.



UWP Full Universal World Profile listings-- includes, except in very old 
    references, eight-digit UWP and three-digit addendum, hex locale, star
    type, and trade and Zone classifications. Does NOT always have all names.



NM All names are given for all worlds, not just High Population ones.


BR Borders of interstellar states, and Xboat and other main news routes, are 
   shown graphically.



ALL Comprises all of the above data in a comprehensive listing.

- - --> NOTE: Not all of these classifications are nested. For example, GEnie 
listings as raw ASCII are UWP only, and NM only on occasion, but the program
written by Mark Cook can create SC on a subsector basis. The Atlas of the
Imperium is SC only. Several sector listings in Traveller\'s Digest are BR 
only, and so on. Generally subsectors reproduced on their own have ALL data.


Codes for references include:



Sup - Supplement 
Adv - Adventure 
Dbl - Double Adventure 
AM  - Alien Module
TTB - The Traveller Book       \\  These four sources contain a great deal
TTA - The Traveller Adventure   | of data about the Spinward Marches: maps
SMC - The Spinward Marches      | of trade routes, histories, battles, etc.
MT  - MegaTraveller Rules      /  Such extra detail is unique to the Marches.
AI  - Atlas of the Imperium
TAS - Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society (includes Challenge)
TD  - Traveller\'s Digest
MTJ - MegaTraveller Journal
GE  - GEnie Sector Listings
MTA - MegTraveller Alien Book (e.g. Vilani and Vargr = MTA1)


The codes for data extent are:



:all - Entire sector represented
:A,B - Subsectors A and B represented, per the usual array:


		SUBSECTORS IN A SECTOR


			A  B  C  D



			E  F  G  H



			I  J  K  L



			M  N  O  P



- - --> NOTE that information on single worlds, no matter how detailed, is
excluded from this listing. We deal in sectors and subsectors ONLY.



SAMPLE



200	ARGENT (G)/Zhdatlqats(Z)/Grrnokhvrrgaeng(V)/Mulikaa(B)
	SC UWP (GE:all), SC UWP NM BR (Dbl9:J,K) (Adv14:A,B,E,F)



Sector number 200 on the Handy Chart is called Argent by the Imperium and 
other Galanglic-speaking peoples, and its other names are listed. The Star
Chart and UWP listing is obtainable from GEnie\'s archives, but full data
(note that we could have written "SC UWP NM BR" as simply "ALL") is available
from Double Adventure 9 for subsectors J and K, and from Adventure 14 for
subsectors A, B, E and F.


Easy, right? OK, then, here are the listings:

Been working on the PBEM turn all weekend.  So far I have it down to ~84K
bytes, and mor or less in order.  It covers the first three days of jump.
Unfortunately, I have only about six hours of stuff from the R-alpha and
Aslan folks.    C\'mon you guys.  If you\'re quick (next day +/-) I can land
you.  I also want to hear a little bit from the physical and social
sciences teams (Werner, Morser, etc.)  You guys have been cloistered up
against your terminals too long.  It\'s time to come out and say a few
words to your comrades.

A critical eye would rate all of these one level less than I did.
Anyway, here\'s some non-copyright material to feed your imaginations
for describing "that" landing pad in your next adventure.



Last night, I went out and knocked some winter-accumulated rust (this is
Oregon) off my flying skills.  Here is a brief list of a few places I
"visited" (that is, I landed, stopped, and (maybe) took off).



Stop one:  Flying M Ranch
   This is a small, "dude ranch" resort on the Yamhill River, in the Coast
   Range.  The airstrip is gravel, 6 m X 650 m, and nestled between the 
   river and the tree line at the bottom of a box canyon.  No fuel or
   repairs are available.  No navigation aids exist.



   I rate this one  CLASS D in the TM scheme of things.



   I made my skill rolls (with some serious sweat) on the crosswind
   landing, and easily on the cross wind, short-field takeoff.





Stop two:  Hillsboro  (Offically Portland International/Hillsboro)
   This is Oregon\'s second busiest airport.  There are two paved runways, 
   one 50 m X 1900 m, one 50 m X 1400 m.  It has a full-time control 
   tower, visual and radio navigation aids, runway and approach lighting.
   Several different vendors offer fuel, services, and hauling.

   I rate this one CLASS B in the TM scheme of things.

   Skill rolls for this were trivial (just don\'t snake-eye the dice).





Stop three: Twin Oaks
	This is a paved 15m X 875m strip near Hillsboro.  The navaids for
	Hillsboro can be used.  Runway lights are available.  There is no
	tower or even full-time radio watch.  It is a one way strip -- that is
	you have to take off to the south, and land to the north.  (My "home"
	airport).  Some service and fuel are available.

	I rate this one CLASS C in the TM scheme.



	Great landing, but minor panic, \'cause I carefully scheduled this to
	happen after darkness fell.



Explanation:

    I would rate Flying M Class E if it were grass, mud, or snow, or a
	little shorter, or if there weren\'t a really neat restaurant there.
	($100 hamburger anyone?)



	I don\'t rate Hillsboro class A \'cause there is no RADAR coverage, no
	mandatory altitude or radio coverage.   I\'d like to save the "A"
	rating for the BIG \'ports like Heathrow, JFK, LAX, Tokyo, etc.

Woe is me.



Here am I, diligently trying to get a turn out almost on time, and you
guys keep on adding stuff even as I compile.  Ordinarily, I\'d just ignore
it, but it\'s too good.  All of you on the Alcyon SHUT UP until you get
the next turn.  A couple of you are starting to get yourselves out of sync
again...


Of course, my invitation to the R-alpha natives and the Aslan to yap away
is still open.





====

I probably have 5 to 10 hours more work to do on this turn, so I should be
able to get it out this week.  Right now I\'m shooting for posting it
during the work week (difficult, int, writing, luck, fateful).  So
whatever you say after Wednesday will not get heard.  I usually get two
day or less turnaround to everywhere, so I can be reasonbly sure of
getting what you say on Wednesday by Friday.

There is probably very little that is salvagable from COACC...bombs, rockets,
and external ordnance racks being about the extent of it.  As far as I can
tell, too many inconsistencies exist between COACC and the Referee\'s Manual
design system to allow craft from one to compete on an equal footing with
craft from the other.  Scott Kellogg\'s _Indianapolis_ series space fighters,
with their single computers, lack of armor, and batteries worth of externally
slung missiles provide an excellent example of this problem.  (Not to mention
the fusion rockets that Dow Rieder assures us have a greater than light speed
exhaust. I should also mention that the external missiles portion of Scott\'s
designs is reasonable, and I\'d support its incoporporation into TDR Air.)

Aircraft damage capacity is hugely inflated, and controls are not consistent
with the ref\'s manual.  I feel strongly that any rewrite should specifically
take into account dogfights between grav vehicles and aircraft, because there
is no real way to determine the "equivalent agility" of grav vehicles as things
stand now.  

I did like some of the general ideas introduced in COACC--like helicopter and
airship design, but I can\'t say that they are well implemented.

Here it is.  All 1600++ lines of it.  I saw no reason to keep you
folks waiting any longer.  We can just start the Aslan out at day -2 or
something on the next turn.



[In my own defense, I admit I straightened out some confused timeline in
Charyn\'s bridge interactions.  Hope this doesn\'t offend anyone -- James]


One of these days we\'ve definitely got ot finish this so we can all compare
notes and compile them.  As good as the public stuff is, the private is
better.

"Boy, this is a tough one.  



"Here am I out on routine maintenance, a moving object in the 
sky,  visitors coming, and the Hoop wanting me to come back home.


"_Very_ curious.   Maybe almost too curious a situation.  



"I wonder if that object is  the Visitors?  I wonder what the 
Visitors are?  I should go back to the base like I was asked.  



"But what about the Visitors?"



Doejin stars a parallax and passive scan to guage the distance to 
intercept the Object moving in the sky.  



"Hmm, one diameter.  Take way too long to intercept, besides, its
coming toward us, accelerating.  Nope, not a rock.  



Ooohh... just went active.  All kinds of EM radiation. Old stuff; 
no antimatter in use, just fusion.  Not enough fuel to get out there 
and  back, either.    Maybe I can get Their attention."



Doejin fires the thrusters and begins an intercept course.

>From the commander\'s chair, Akhouw looks at the large holotank with 
rapt attention. The meaning of the gleam in his eyes is unmistakable -- 
excitement at the incredible potential that a ringworld possesses and 
deep pride at the glory he will gain for his clan.



"Computer, lock and continue scan of the raohke ship, store all sensor
information. Compute optimal pursuit course and display on my holo."



Turning to his navigator, Akhouw raps out further instructions. 
"Aiwi, find out the composition of the asteriods in this system -- 
particularly  if there are any ice asteroids. After that, I want maximum 
scan concentration on the ringworld -- get as much as you can.  Find and 
locate any bodies of water suitable for refueling.  Look for population 
centers as well, and keep an ear out for communications and tell-tale 
signs of meson packet decay."



He touches the intership commlink. "Eihoftyah, get your troop up, I want 
them ready to go within the next tekhaao (1 Aslan hour = 137 minutes).  
Don\'t know if we\'ll need them, but it\'s best to be ready since we have 
proof of advanced lifeforms. Standard kit. And I want the pinnace crew 
ready right away."



Switching to the general channel, "Attention, all personnel. The next
few tekhaaor may be of immense importance to our clan. Let us show that
we are worthy of our clan-mates. Khaukeairl hrau\'troikh! (To the glory 
of our clan)"





The computer starts spitting out reams of information.  No asteroids.  
Two concentric rings.  Lots of fresh and salt water.  Low frequency AM
radio signals.  Tell-tale indications of gravitics use from all over the
ring.





"Captain.  The ship has changed course.  It\'s on a low-energy intercept!"

... Dulinor, Lucan, and Ian fly off down the hall with the scoutcicles...



Redd : "Ok, once we\'ve *carefully* cleared the air in there, we can see how
	much damage was done by that break. I\'d like to have a good look at
	that fuel line, too - Will we have enough uninjured crew to manage?"



Abuko: "Try to find out what caused it too.  There have been to many
        coincidences on this ship, and we\'d better begin to stay in front of 
        the action instead of behind it, if we want to survive to pay-day."



        Let\'s get a muster here.  We\'ve gotta find out which engineers are 
        left?  Somehow engineering\'s got a higher causuality rate than 
        Security.

Redd:   Let\'s NOT have a party this jump.













After the successful jump, Zben compliments Charyn on her performance at
the Comm Panel.  Charyn winks playfully and says: "Thanks, Zben! In a
ship of this size and sophistication, and with the competent individuals
we have aboard, I feel very secure!"



A dainty frown crosses her lips and her forehead wrinkles, then she
states: "My biggest concern is that we are all so different.  If we had
a base of common preparation and procedure, and a common vocabulary for
expressing ideas, we\'d be better off.  Still, such training and
discipline take time.  It takes time to have a real *team* of people.


She is reserved as to her inflection and movement, and always seems to
carry herself with a steady, graceful poise, friendly and open, though,
not the poise of arrogance or superiority.



"As for a drink, I\'ll be glad to join you once I finish up my shift
here.  I\'ve never been big on matrix management, but I\'ll need to report
in to my other teams here real soon."



After setting up a running update on the computer for the estimated time to
jump exit and making sure that his nav station is secure, Nishu turns his
attention to Charyn with a long sigh.  "Miz Robins, I don\'t think we\'ve
been formally introduced.  My name is Nishu Neriika - kind of a navigator,
though with the preprogrammed jump data I\'m as much along for the ride as
you are."  He smiles wryly.


Charyn pops her head up quizically from the board and absent-mindedly
runs a slim hand through her long dark wavy hair.  



Nishu leads Charyn to the back of the bridge, where it is a little quieter,
and begins to fill her in on the events before her arrival.  


She stands and stretches her shoulders and neck, then sidles back.



Nishu: "Let\'s see we boarded the Alcyon at Turnskaad\'s asteroid base,
and got boosted out to the jump point.  That jump entry was a lot
smoother and a lot less crazy than this one..." He shakes his head.

"Anyway.  Once we were secure in jumpspace, the traditional setting-out
party got underway in the crew lounge.  Both I and our roving reporter
Mr.  Bishop have some footage of that, if you\'re interested."



His grin fades.  "Somehow, we got slipped something a little more potent
than the usual refreshments.  When we woke up, we found out a few things.
One, we\'d been out for about five days.  Two, some of the crew were still
in a coma... and one, Sgt-Major Hammer, was already dead.  Three, someone
had slipped a beacon on board; the electronics and demolitions boys were
still picking over it, last I heard."



Nishu\'s expression by now is rather grim.  "So, we came out of jump at the
rendezvous point, and you came on board... and all zisk broke loose.  You
saw the rest."



"Let\'s see, commdots.  Zben can probably tell you were to pick one up; I
just got handed one preset.  There are ten channels, of which your \'dot
should connect to four - All-call, Help, the \'Kommon\' party-line, and
the Transport team channel.  Oh, and also the Generalist channel, that
makes five.  The computer is handling all the switching, so it should
be pretty easy to use.  If you want more details, talk to Zben."


"Anything else?"



"Pleased to meet you Neriika! Navigation? I\'ve served as Navigator for a
few years on the Perry-Robins merchant fleet flagship.  Thanks for the
Comm info, I already had it programmed up once I found what frequencies
were in use.  I tend to be inordinately nosy and completist that way."
She smiles enthusiastically.



She returns to her console and:



	leaves VoiceMail for the exhausted Dr Van Der Merwe, asking him
	to give her a call when he can schedule her in for the physical.


	Calls up Etienne De Mer and asks what routine services and
	schedule he is expecting.



	Calls up Mac Whitfield and inquires as to how she can serve the
	interests of the Generalists team.



When the shift ends, she looks at Zben and raises an eyebrow.  They exit
the bridge in search of the ship\'s commons, conversing on the way.











Zben says a few quiet words to Etienne, shrugs, and heads for the 
iris valve.  Upon leaving the bridge Zben wanders down to Engineering. 
He heard there was some damage just before Jump, but wasn\'t really 
aware of the extent or type.



All around are engineers and robots cleaning and checking guages, 
switches, valves, wires, pipes, and each others\' work.  When he learns 
of the critical injuries he pales, and is visibly shaken.   He leaves and
heads quickly to sick bay.



He waits quietly while Dr. Limner works desparately to save MT, and Ian
works himself to exhaustion on Silvmane.  After an eternity, Dr. Limner
applies some rejuvenating fluid to his OWN hands, which have become 
rather frostbitten simply by working so close to MT\'s frozen body, 
despite any precautions Limner had taken.



Despite the long monologues that Limner gave almost without pause while
the medical teams were working, Limner finally appears tired, in fact
almost haggard, himself.  "Boy, I forgot how difficult this," he waves
his hand slightly towards the medical room, "can be.  Oh my!  I seem to
have lost track of time.  I\'m past due for some sleep."



Dr. Limner dissapears into the Aurora surgery, where Dr. Van der Merwe is
finishing his stabilization of Anton.  After a few minutes, the two 
doctors leave the Aurora, and head in separate directions.



On the general channel:
  Dr. Limner here.  I\'m going off duty now.



Zben stays.  Here in the Alcyon sickbay, Lucan lifts Ian into a chair and
props his head up on a pillow stolen from a lounge chair not far from Zben.
Dulinor silently wheels in a comatose figure bristling with exotic medical
machinery that is no doubt keeping him alive.  Lucan briefly leaves and 
disappears into the adjacent room with the cold-berths, then returns.
Lucan and Dulinor set  viital sign monitors, and take position, each 
hovering near the head of one of the two recumbent figures.



Still Zben stays.



On the General Channel:
   All hands, attention.  This is Commander Ger.  It grieves me to have to
   report that one of our crew, Doctor Much T\'B Deziered, who most of you
   knew, if only briefly, as MT, is dead, the victim of a hydrogen leak
   in engineering just moments before the jump.  Although he was only 
   aboard a few hours, he was a valued member of our exploration team.
   Memorial services for MT and Hammer will be held when we reach R-alpha.
   It is fitting that those who first gave their lives in search of the
   unknown be left forever with the object of their search.



   We have had too many accidents, and too many unexplained mysteries
   already.  We have only a few days now before ringfall to solve these
   mysteries.  All ship\'s crew on 48-hour minimum-work schedule.  When
   we get back to work, let\'s get it right.  Then the rest of us can
   return to tell what secrets R-alpha has to share.



   That is all.





Zben turns and slowly walks back to his cabin. If anyone greets him in 
the corridor he just walks on, not seeming to see them.  In his cabin, 
he sits on his bunk, unmoving, staring at a someplace many lightyears 
away...



After a while he stirs, and begins, in a low monotone, to curse
fluently.  Anyone listening (Bit?) would hear a mix of galanglic, low
Aslan, and a few Darrian choice words. Mixed in and among them:
"....Damn. I left him there. I just tossed stuff to him and
left..." "....not my fault, sure. Wasn\'t my fault when Norin died.
That didn\'t help him, doesn\'t help MT..."



Suddenly, he sits up straight. Rising, he goes to the storage
cubby and pulls out a beat-up duffle bag. From a side pocket he takes
out a small valutawood case. Inside is a  tarnished medallion on a
blue and green ribbon. Across the top can be read (barely) "HIGHEST
COMMENDATION", and at the bottom the insignia of the Tukera Lines.
Running his fingers lightly over its surface, "Death. Stupid,
meaningless, empty death. Why? Why? So young, so much ahead of them."



His eyes swimming, he closes the case, and returns it to the bag.
Opening the larger part of the duffle he takes out a flask that sloshes,
quietly. Raising it in a toast, he intones "The idea is to die young,
as old as possibile", and takes a small swig. Lying down on the bunk,
he stares at the ceiling for some time before drifting off into a
troubled sleep.











Nishu, the navigator whose large frame and neat beard makes him look more 
like the traditional engineer, walks quietly back to his cabin.  He\'s had 
a full day, from the panic of jump entry and trying to help clean up 
afterwards, lending a hand where he could.  Like most of the crew he has 
taken a moment to drop by Sickbay and look in on the injured.  His usual 
wry grin has been replaced, bit by bit, with a look of weariness.


He happens to pass the crew lounge, noting Bishop in the early stages 
of a drinking session.  Sitting at a table next to one of the blanked 
viewports in the lounge, Bishop stares into a mostly empty glass.  
Judging from the assortment of empties already on the table, he is well 
on his way to alcohol poisoning.  In a loud voice, slurred almost beyond 
understanding, he rants.



"Dulinor,... and Margaret,... and *LUCAN*.  *GOD* *DAMN* him!!"  He
convulsively tosses down the rest of the drink.  "...\'P..\'puter.  Give
another one,... no *TWO*,... of whatever I or..ordered the last time!"
As the drinks arrive, he continues his tirade.  " \'Go on the expedition,
Adrian\' ", he sneers, " \'It\'ll be a great story!\'.  HAH!!  I can see the
headlines now.  \'Well Known INN Journalist killed in Vehicle Accident.
Holo at 2300 hours.\'"



Nishu pauses for a moment, but elects the better part of valor with the 
realization that the reporter probably doesn\'t want company and continues 
down the corridor.  In a few more minutes he has reached his own quarters 
and palms the door shut, sitting down at his desk.



He opens an envelope, spreading the contents out onto the desktop - about
twenty photographs, printed on glossy paper in super-high-res format, and
the crystal from his still camera on which the data is still stored.  
This is one of the things he really likes about the Alcyon:  he can get
the photos printed out now, rather than having to wait until the mission
is over to get the data to a processing lab.  Nishu goes through the 
prints, tossing out the one or two bad shots.  Even Imperial technology
can\'t prevent all the errors of an amateur. 



When he\'s done, Nishu puts most of the photos back into the envelope with 
the crystal, writing the date on the outside.  A few remain on the desk.
He pulls out other envelopes, sorting through them and occasionally add-
ing one to the small pile.  When he has about five photographs, he
reaches for a book he left on the desk - a small photo album, with a 
cover of black leather.



Nishu opens the book and turns to the middle, finding a blank page.  He
begins to mount the pictures of MT under the thin plastic, from his
short time aboard.  Facing these on the opposite page are a few photos
of Sgt. Major Hammer, taken during the mission briefing and the hasty
preparations for setting out and placed in the album shortly after the
first jump.  He notes the contrast between the thoroughly military man
in camoflague fatigues and the grey-haired scientist known for a
reverence for all life.



The photos in place, Nishu takes a moment to turn back through the album, 
looking at other faces.  Toby Briggs, who\'d been standing next to him 
when the PB-772 took a pirate missile.  Vince Parsons, whose ship mis- 
jumped and was never seen again.  Salla Ijini, dead in a groundcar 
accident.  Fallen comrades.  Now this was all he had of any of them.



He closes the book, which still has many blank pages.  He hopes he won\'t 
have to fill any more of them on this mission.






Several hours into jump, Johann suddenly remembered that he has forgotten 
Bit in his transport cage.  Several hours alone in a padded cage, well 
equipped with water and food pellet dispensers granted, but with nothing 
the intensely curious creature hadn\'t seen a hundred times before would 
drive Bit nuts, Johann was certain of that. 


When the Van Der Merves call came through, Johann was in the process of 
trying to coax Bit down from an airvent using small pieces of fruit. He 
ignored the first call, but when it was repeated, he muttered something 
about everything being an class red emergency onboard the Alcyon, ate the 
fruit himself and left for the bridge.


When he returned ten minutes later, Bit had once again managed to escape the 
stateroom or hide exceptionally well. "You don\'t have to hide Bit. Your surgery
is postponed indefinately." Johann looked in the lockers under the bed but no
Bit. "No inplanted tracer beacon. Did you hear that? No commdot. You\'ll be a
free and untracable tree-rat like all your untracable ancestors on Focaline.
At least until he get his act togeather again, I\'ll not allow any doc to bring 
a knife anywhere close to you." 


No Bit showed up, however, so Johann decided that he probably had managed to
leave the room after all. On second thoughts, maybe one of the medibots could
implant a commodot in Bit? It would sure make Bit easier to find in an
emergency. Leaving those musings behind, Johann begun to rifle through a locked
rack of holocrystals, selecting some but leaving most behind. When he was 
satiesfied that he got all that he needed, he switched the auto-answer on the
console on the desk to the highest setting and left for enginering. It would
file all calls and only forward life-or-death matters to him. He hoped that
there wouldn\'t be too many life-or-death matters for a few hours, but he
didn\'t really expect it to hold.



Somehow something always cropped up and interrupted everything. First there
was that party, with the following poisonings and deaths, then the solomani
beacon, the service hatches that should have been closed but had been opened at
sometime by someone, the fleet that just "happened" to appear in the same system
just when they refuelling, the frantic hurry to charge the sinks and get out
of the way of a force packing several thousands times the Alcyons firepower,
two strance occurances of equippment malfunctions that should happen. One 
leading to a lost foot, at the very least, and one leading to one dead and 
one griveously wounded.

  

The only kind of emergency that Johann could think of right away that hadn\'t
happened yet was a weapons accident, and with the amount of heavy weapons
onboard the Alcyon, he tried not to think of the results if one happened.



Now, however, everyone seemed to at least hold their emergencies outside 
the engineering department. Finally, he could run the enhancement programs on
the probe data. Taking over a unoccupied console originally indended to
show holopictures or spareparts, heat distribusion or other mundane matters,
Johann hooked it up to the computers in the command shuttle and loaded some 
programs into it from the crystals. He fetched the recent sensor data from the
refueling, distorted it severely and then let the computer at it using one 
of the sensor analysis program he\'d brought. Small figures of different colors 
and intensity in one corner of the holodisplay indicated the effort the computer
spends on the task, while the picture slowly became clearer and clearer and 
finally approache it\'s original state.



The shuttles computer managed the test with flying colors, so Johann let
loose the entire battery of sensor analysis and enhancement at the real
target. The data the Turnskaad probe brought back from R-alpha.


In the lounge, Adrian arches his arm and pitches the half-empty glass at 
the bulkhead, where it shatters, spraying fragments in every direction.  
"DAMN IT!!", he sobs, his voice cracking, "I\'m a *journalist*!!  I\'m not 
a damn war correspondent!" Picking up the remaining drink, he spasmod-
ically gulps half of it, and then wails, "Lucan, *Goddamm you*.  You shoot 
at me, *YOU* *BASTARD*!!!  I write your own *FUCKING* propaganda!!  Every 
day." he sobs, "Every day, I tell your story,... with that *THING*!"  He 
gestures weakly at the dented and silent shape of the AGNIS unit, laying 
on the floor surrounded by the broken remains of a crew lounge chair.


He gulps the last of the liquor and the glass slips from his almost numb
fingers to thud on the carpeted floor.  As his head falls to the table
amidst all the empties, he sobs, "I\'m a journalist.  I\'m not a so..soldier!"



Richard Jett steps into the room and surveys the debris. He sighs, and 
gazes at Bishop slumped over the table with knowing sympathy. He steps 
over to the compu-bar and says "Computer, recognize Jett, priority 
Turnskaad-Alpha. Accept no further orders from intoxicants from Adrian 
Bishop for 24 hours."



Looking down at Adrian, Richard says "So it finally got to you... It 
happens to all of us who are compelled by circumstance to act against 
our wishes.  You are a journalist, I am a judge -- but both forced to 
contravene the ideals of our profession." Richard is now animated, 
puncturing his speech with pointed gestures, as he continues in a louder 
voice, reckless of any nearby listeners.  His face flushed yet determined, 
he leans in close to Bishop\'s face.  "It *sucks* Adrian, there\'s no way 
around it. I could tell you stories of gross injustice that would make 
you sick -- AND I HAD TO DO IT! Why, *WHY* (as his fist pounds the table)? 
Because if I gave up and surrendered, *worse* would follow -- my power was 
limited, but I did my damndest to do JUSTICE at every turn. The question 
is -- what are you prepared to do? Let it consume your soul in self-doubt 
and recrimination, or rise above it?"



With each blow of Jett\'s fist on the table, Bishops head bounces in unison,
making a wet, slapping sound in the puddle of spilled alcohol.  Finally,
Bishop drunkenly lifts his head from the puddle of booze on the table and
struggles to focus his glazed, red eyes on Jett.  Then he flops back in the
the chair and slurs, "Sh..self-doubt?  I nhe..*never* doubt myself.  I know
eck..eck..*EXACTLY* what my limitations are, counselor.  How many other
people do you know that can honestly sha..say that?"  He fumbles for a
grip on the edge of the table and pushes himself into a weaving, upright
position.

    

"I do my job better than anybody, *ANYBODY* else in this business!!" he 
asserts, obviously fighting to form each syllable.  "I am *NEVER*
self-recri..recrim..criminating."  Then he points at the blanked viewports,
as if indicating imaginary warships in space beyond them and continues,
"But I am *NOT* bulletproof either!  And there wasn\'t supposed to be any
shooting!!"  



He snorts, "We have this HUGE starship", he sweeps both arms in the air, 
"just *FILLED* with scientists, and scholars, and explorer-types.  Oh 
sure, almost everybody carries a weapon.  We\'ve got Horne with his big
9 millimeter \'fire-hose\', and \'Vouf with those two Whirlwinds of Devestation
he carries on his hips.  Have you seen \'Vouf\'s cabin?  He\'s *proud* of it!!  
He advertises it!!  But what about poor Adrian?  Does he carry a laser?  
Does he carry a gauss rifle?  Noooo, he carries *A CAMERA*!!  You know what 
that makes me??  It makes me a god-damn *target*, that\'s what it makes me!!  
A somewhat less-than-innocent bu..bystander.  And don\'t point out those 
stupid little stun-guns that they handed out to everybody last week.  That\'s 
like trying to stop a charging Virushi with harsh language.  You know what 
the epitaph would read?  It would read \'He died because he was *STUPID*\'!!"

    

"These people," Bishop waves around at the rest of the ship, "these
people think they can take on a *BATTLE FLEET* with one lousy little
research ship.  We just entered jump again.  Do you think we\'re going
home, after they tried to kill us?  Hell, *NO*.  Can\'t have any of that
rot, nosirree.  We going on to the bloody ringworld.  We\'ll show those
military shits they can\'t push around *REAL* scientists.  This entire
crew has the cumulative survival instinct of a section of deck plating!!"

    

"And injustice, you want to talk about injustice?" Bishop jabs a
wavering finger in Jett\'s direction.  "Counselor, I make my living, by
the grace of God, off of the *BI..BIGGEST* injustice this sorry empire could
ever imagine.  I feed the masses Lucan\'s *PARTY LINE*,  EVERY...SINGLE...
DAY!!  I know, you see, I know...", He turns away from Jett and mumbles,
"I found him,... last year,... I found him.  I ta..talked to Windhook... he

told me *EVERYTHING*."

    

Bishop spins back towards Jett, grabbing a chair to keep from falling
over.  "I\'VE GOT THE GODDAMN HOLO-CHIP!!  I SAW *EVERYTHING*!!!" he screams.
"I COULD... I could... my God...", his voice fades away as the blood drains
from his face.  Eyes wide with terror, he backs away from Jett, "My God, what
am I saying...?  My God..."  Shoving his fist in his mouth, he turns and
stumbles frantically from the lounge, heading towards his cabin.



Jett is frozen in time for just an instant; a split-second of shock and
disbelief as his mind absorbs Bishop\'s terror-confession. Then his mind
snaps back to reality as comprehension spreads like a tidal wave against
the neural sands. A furtive glance left, then right. He utters a single,
fervent word, resonating with sympathy and frustration. "Damn." He quick-
marches after Bishop\'s retreating, panic-stricken figure.















"All right, computer, close file."  Lazer sighed wearily.  "Tag it and save
under Disaster Inquiry, today\'s date, Farouk report, prelim."  He grimaced.
"No, better make that first bit \'Procedural Report\'."



Lazer stood up and stretched, working knots of bureaucratic frustration out
of his back.  Damned documentation had to be done, and he knew himself well
enough not to let himself put it off.  And now, he had one last errand to run.



He went into the lav, rinsed out his mouth, and straightened his collar.  The 
man in the mirror didn\'t look good. "Dammit, you\'re getting old, Lester."
He came to attention and drew in a deep breath.  Exhale slowly.  He saluted 
cleanly, pivoted, and left.



Fortunately, the corridors were quiet this time of night.  He didn\'t feel up
to an encounter with one of those who deal with stress by getting drunk. 
Just keep the pace crisp and the mind blank.  Down the corridor, to the right,
now towards Engineering, but turn off first--here it is.



Lazer nodded to a bored Ian as he went into the dark Infirmary.  Anton was in 
the bed to the right, laid out under racks of magic gadgets with telltales like
watchful glowing eyes.  Silvmane lay across from him in ghoulish counterpoint.
One dead, two critically wounded, and they never even fired a shot.



He sat, and quietly took fresh air deep into his lungs.  "I\'m sorry, Anton.
You\'re a good man.  You didn\'t deserve that."  He pauses, groping for words.
He continues, quietly, "Damn it all.  That was my order that put you there."
The nagging voice buried deep in his mind taunted, what are you going to do
now?  Ask him for forgiveness?  Think you\'re omnicient, Lazer?  You\'re human, 
fallible.  No.  Yes.  



"I failed you, Anton.  I can\'t weasel-word to my own wounded.  I was 
responsible, and I failed.  I\'m sorry."  Why was it always so hard with few 
wounded?  Mass casualties were numbing, somehow.  My soul is too small too 
encompass that much suffering.  "I\'m sorry."



He tasted salt tears at the crook of his mouth, and welcomed them.



Lazer sat out the rest of his vigil in silence.  After an hour he rose, and
walked toward the door.  "Later, Anton."  Ian was still at his seat as he
left, expression indecipherable.













Bhyarrvouf is performing his "midnight prowl," a ritual he began when still 
an Engineer and which he continues as SubCommander: he walks quietly 
through the Alcyon from stem to stern, looking in each work area, perhaps 
exchanging a brief word with the crewmen on watch, before going off duty. 



All seems well on the Bridge, and he skips through the labs quickly so as to 
avoid disturbing the scientists working late into the night on their 
calculations and preparations for the Big Moment. He pauses in the Sick Bay
entry, and looks for a long moment at each of the recumbent forms before
continuing down the hall. He walks down the quiet halls of the quarters deck,
ears and nose twitching after every faint scent, every sigh or snore from
behind a wall. 



He makes out the unmistakable voices of Bishop and Jett, several meters
down the hall and what he hears stops him.



   "Adrian -- are you OK?" 



   "....

   Look, ...  right?  I never said *ANYTHIN\'*.  It *NEVER* happened."

   ... dead man...  

   I *LIKE* bein\' *ALIVE*.  I want to *GO ON* bein\' *ALIVE*."

   ...

   Don\'t you screw up too...You poke your nose into this, and 

   you\'re a corpse ...

   ..."



There is another brief, hushed, exhange of words, and the distinctive
sound of a forcefully closed door.  \'Vouf continues on around the corner.
He passes Jett in the hall, and favors the lawyer with a friendly 
grin, avoiding an actual conversation.  The judge seems preoccupied, 
determinedly heading toward his cabin.

  









Dr. Morser wanders into the lounge, running his hand through his shock 
of unruly blond hair. He is distracted, as usual, but also somewhat 
somber. He also mutters a bit under his breath as he picks out some 
nutrition(bleah!) from the dispensers:

	"Hmm...seen zome pretty ztrrrange ting in my time...Veird
mutations, odd crreatures, terrrible side-effects...but poor MT..."



He shudders involuntarily at the memory of bits of frozen person shattering
off as MT\'s flash-frozen body slid across the floor just before engineering
was evacuated.



Taking his meal to a table, he stops suddenly at the sight of the paritally
disassembled and maimed AGNIS unit. He steps over and examines it 
immediately, ignoring his rapidly cooling meal. So engrossed is he in this,
that he completely misses the commotion about the Subcommander, and just
keeps poking about the bits and pieces of the poor AGNIS.









\'Vouf\'s long path ends in Engineering, where the liquid hydrogen spill\'s 
effects have quickly been dealt with (after all, when it evaporates it
doesn\'t leave a mess) and the feed has been patched. Now, with the drives 
off and the power plant idling, the huge room is quiet. 



Johann Abuko is up late working on a simulation at one of the holodisplays. 
Abuko doesn\'t hear \'Vouf come in, and \'Vouf doesn\'t disturb him. \'Vouf walks 
past the familiar machines, stopping now and again to run a loving hand over a 
particularly well-kept device, until he comes to the Maneuver Drive monitoring 
station, deep in the bowels of the Engine Room. During Jumps, the thruster 
plates are silent, and the station is on automonitor and abandoned. \'Vouf 
sinks into the contoured couch, poking his tail through the slit at the back, 
and settles into the cushions with a sigh. "I miss this," he whispers softly.
"Promotions aren\'t all fun and glory...." 



He pauses and sits up, his ears focussing forward like twin antennas toward 
the machinery near the main drive coils. His nose twitches furiously, but the 
wind in the vents is at his back, he smells nothing. In a blur of silver, a 
Gauss pistol is in his hand. "I know you\'re there," he says menacingly. "Come 
on out."



There is a moment\'s pause, then a tiny golden head with twitching whiskers and 
rounded ears pokes out timidly from behind the coil. Bright black eyes survey 
\'Vouf suspiciously, and the tiny nose wrinkles at his scent.



\'Vouf\'s ears fold back flat, and he sighs in disgust, shoving his pistol 
angrily back into its holster. "Aw, Bit," he groans, "Get out of there! You\'re 
not supposed to be down here, it\'s dangerous! Johann\'s supposed to know 
better....especially after that fiasco this morning!"



Bit\'s ears perk up at the sound of his name, and he scampers out from behind 
the drive and up onto \'Vouf\'s lap. \'Vouf\'s expression gets even madder. "Go 
away, Bit," he growls. Bit looks puzzled at that, and puts his forepaws up on 
\'Vouf\'s chest to get a better look at him.



\'Vouf bares his teeth. "Let me teach you a little bit of biology, tree-rat," 
he whispers grimly. "In every ecosystem, there\'s a whole order very carefully 
laid out as to how plants and animals get nourished. At the bottom end are the 
bacteria, which digest the corpses of higher forms and provide food for the 
next lower step on the ladder. Then those tiny plants are eaten by tiny 
animals, and the tiny animals are eaten by bigger animals, and so on, and so 
on. That\'s what we call a food chain, see? Now, near to the middle of the food 
chain are little carnivores that eat vermin and insects... like tree-rats. And 
you\'re a tree-rat, see? That\'s your place in the food chain: eating vermin and 
insects. Okay? Now, a ways further up on the food chain are the sentient 
animals, which with the dubious exception of the K\'Kree eat pretty much 
whatever they want to, including lower animals on the food chain. Like 
tree-rats. Now, some species have this weird double standard where they keep 
lower animals around for fun, not for eating. Humans do it; so do Aslan, and 
so do the Hivers, or so I\'ve heard. But the Droyne don\'t, and the K\'Kree 
don\'t, and the Vargr CERTAINLY don\'t. And I\'m a Vargr. And you\'re a tree-rat. 
Are you beginning to understand the implications of this yet, Bit?"



Bit sniffs more closely at \'Vouf\'s muzzle, and his whiskers wiggle.



"Look, I\'ll spell it out for you in simple terms," \'Vouf snarls. "LITTLE 
predators get EATEN by BIG predators. And I\'m getting really TIRED of eating
RECONSTITUTED MEAT from the BIOMASS TANKS! DO YOU GET THE HINT?" His teeth 
draw back into a killing rictus, his jaws open to snap the tiny head off.



Bit licks his nose.



\'Vouf looks shocked, then outraged, then angry, then sheepish, as Bit begins 

vigorously cleaning his nose and muzzle with a tiny rough tongue, stopping now 
and again to sniff at his handiwork. Bit, satisfied with the job he\'s done,
sits back, and \'Vouf laughs quietly, as much at himself as at the tiny animal.
"Oh, g\'wan, get out of here," he grins. "Your papa\'s probably wondering where
you\'ve got to. Go on, shoo!" As an extra impetus, he picks up a glittering
holocrystal from the blank-disk box, waves it in front of Bit\'s eyes so it
glimmers in the dim light, and tosses it away, back toward the occupied areas
of Engineering. Bit gives a little "chuff" of excitement and goes tearing
after the disk as it rolls away. \'Vouf watches him go with a faint smile, then
leans back in the chair once more, closing his eyes. After a minute or two,
his breath comes in slow, easy surges, and one of his feet gives an occasional
twitch. 



After a little while, Bit comes back, the disk clutched in his tail. He climbs 
back up onto \'Vouf\'s lap, inspects the sleeping face carefully, then curls up 
and goes to sleep himself. Absently, one gauntleted hand comes up off the
armrest and gently caresses the tawny fur on Bit\'s back, coming to rest there.







Many hours later, Johann realizes that the engineroom has fallen silent, and 
that he is thirsty. The commo channels are silent, except for the occational
status report from the bridge watch and the entire ships seems to get a much
needed rest. Feeling certain that there is nobody around to ask embarresing 
questions like what the chief enginer is doing running simulations of various
levels of technology on the surface of a simulated R-alpha and comparing it 
to the enhanced probe data in the middle of the night, he winded his way
forward in the ship on stiff legs. The autogalley is never closed. "And it
never complaines about snacks at strange hours."



When he reached the demolished crew lounge, Johann begun to suspect that
someone had had a accident with some weapon after all. Then he discovered the
dented little sphere that was Bishops camera unit. "Either I missed a big
party with a equally big bar-fight or someones got a big grudge against 
cameras!." Johann speculated and went over to the autogalley to punch in an
order for several sandwiches and something with a lot of kaffeine in it.

  

"I know one tree-rat that will be delighted that the mysterious globe is
down at an easy-to-reach level." He thought and remembered that Bit probably
was loose somewhere in the ship again. Johann was convinced that no matter how
it had happened, if Bishop found the camera half-dissasembled on the floor
of the crew lounge, with one guilty looking Bit sitting amongst the pieces,
he would draw his own conclusions.



"Looks like it\'s time to put all the robotics to a practical use." he 
grumbles as he takes the agnis unit and carries it towards engineering.











                        **** Day one  *****

Ferdy checks in at the central maintenance facility.


"Visitors.  WHERE?   Who\'s outside today?  Where are they?"


Swimming over to the console, Ferdy slides into the hoop so that it
just contacts his skin.


"Doejin, where are you?"



- - ----







"Admiral.  He has not threatened us.  He has gone ballistic toward a
large continent.  There is a fresh water lake we can refuel from there."





- - ----



Kimball Redd rises very early and takes several laps around the Alcyon 
with Thule, Lazer, Ian, Charyn, Etienne, and Ralf, grabs a really quick 
breakfast and heads to engineering.



When he gets there he discovers Abuko rubbing his eyes over a large
pile of metallic junk, and \'Vouf stretched out at the number 5
console, with Bit on his lap, furtively darting out a paw and touching 
\'Vouf\'s gauntlets, then as quickly withdrawing it.



Chuckling to himself, Redd grabs a chair by a terminal and starts making 
up a list of things to be done in jump.



"Hmmm...."



Check & repair the fuel line		- what caused the break ?
Check the rest of the fuel lines	- make sure it doesn\'t happen again
Check all systems for damage		- Did anything get frozen ?
Repair the systems damaged by the leak	- Frozen panels, etc


Leadfoot - check him for cold damage, and see about...



"Hey, Abuko - have you talked to Medical about getting Bit  an  implanted
comdot  yet?  It  would  make  it  a lot easier if we could have Leadfoot

listen out for his radio signal & throw him out every time he wanders  in
here -  stop  him  from  hurting himself on something hot. I *think* he\'d
get tired of it before the robot wore out! It shouldn\'t be too difficult
to instruct Leadfoot about how to catch him without hurting him (and what
tasks he shouldn\'t interrupt for it)."


General Maintenance

Airlock	- What happened to it ? Are the others OK ?


"Anyone else think of anything we need to check ?"











In sickbay, Ian gently wakes Silvmane.

  

Dan\'s eyes open slowly and finds himself staring into the soft glowing light

strips of sickbay. 



"How you feeling this morning?"



Slowly he moves his limbs, feeling still a little weak.
The last thing that comes to his mind was the blinding jet of hydrogen
that came from a leaky pipe.  By all rights he should be dead.  Thank god
the ship has modern techniques to save his butt. 



"All your vitals are good.  Doc Van Der Merwe and Lucan both say you\'re
remarkably fit.  I guess we can\'t violate an \'imperial\' edict," Ian says, 
slightly nodding toward the two medbots and grinning.  "I REALLY am glad
you pulled through OK.



Sitting up in bed Dan notices that table next to him has a new set of 
in-ship coveralls.  Slipping into them he feels a moment of regret of 
losing his old uniform.  



Ian drones on almost as though he\'s insensitive to Dan\'s condition.
"I\'m really not a medic.  I\'m a generalist, so we might wind up working
together.  I hate to consider the shape this mission would be in if it\'s
so desparate I have to stay on in medical.  I\'d like to discuss the probe
data with you and Dr. Werner and Dr. Morser and Ralf when we get a few
spare minutes.



Moving slowing towards the door, Dan makes his 
way down to the mess hall.


"If you have any shivers, or nightmares, or strange feelings, or even
questions, just look me up."



Dr. Limner comes in and Ian goes off duty.  Doc heads immediately into
the cold berth area.



"Good Morning .. Jan Yorblin."



Jan shakes off the lethargy off of the low passage.
"Gak! I hate those things, damned navy trait, that frozen watch, does anyone
have a cup of black tea around here?" he says to noone in particular as he
yawns and stretches, his joints popping into place.



Jan is about 2 meters tall, and looks the product of a low-g birth planet
followed by many years in normal to high-g enviroment.  His most striking
feature is his albinism and his belter haircut.  He wears a TL15 Scout issue
vacc suit ("20 years of service, what do I get- two of these and a clean
change of underwear").





"Ah, I believe I recall your holo from my preflight briefing.  Dr. Limner,
isn\'t it?  I assume that were either at our destination, our my services were
needed sooner than expected."



Upon finding that they have not reached R-Alpha, Jan gets a quick brief on
the current situation.



"Well, better get logged on to the ship\'s MedCompSys and get to work:
Computer, prepare log-on file for newly awakened physician, create
personal and patient note files, exam and treatment files, the usual
epidemiology and tracking files, the usual routine..."



"Physician name: Yorblin, Jan Thaddeus.
"Imperial License: STRO/REGI-1108-SPMAR-JYOR-07-11-PI-532-82-2618
"Specialty Board: Fellow, Imperial Academy of Adult Intensivists
"Subspecialty: currently completing work on Astronautic Injury
 Reconstruction"



He asks Limner what patients he can assist with.  After taking a look
at Anton, he sits down with his tea and whatever food he can scrounge 
and begins to review the patient charts.
Assuming that Dr. Limner is present:


"Dr. Van Der Merwe is our Chief Medical Officer.  He should be along
shortly.  Since you seem to have recovered well, \'Welcome Aboard\'.
If you don\'t mind, I have some other matters to attend to."




The few assorted crew-members populating the lounge see a haggard, but 
freshly showered, Adrian Bishop stalk into the compartment.  Without so 
much as a wave or a word of good morning, he heads straight for the auto-
galley.

     

"Scotch," orders Bishop, pointedly ignoring the looks from the rest
of the crew present.

     

"Request denied." the auto-galley coldly replies.  "Authority, Jett,
Richard.  Authorization Turnskaad-Alpha."
     

"Damn", Bishop mutters.  His fist, resting on the counter, slowly

clenches and unclenches.  After an embarrassing pause, he slowly exhales
and says, "Coffee.  Strong and black."  With a brief hum and a click,
the unit disgorges a steaming, if somewhat utilitarian, mug of coffee.
Bishop picks it up and eyes it suspiciously.  He then takes a tenative
sip, grimaces, and then gulps about half of the contents.  Sweeping the
room with a brief glance, coffee cup in hand, Bishop slowly wanders out
into the corridor.  He then picks up his pace and heads aft, towards
the cargo hold.







  Deep down Johann isn\'t surprised at all the calamities that has befallen the 
ship. "What else could one expect that when they put a hairball as executive
officer and fills the ship with Vilanis?!" he thinks and is at the same time
relieved that he put Bit in his cabin so that wasn\'t in harms way when the 
hydrogene spill occured.

  "And what was the language the doc begun mumbled in?! Vargr?! What kind of
flying lunatic asylum is this?"

  

  Johann repairs the agnis unit if it is possible, and takes advantage of the
occation to snoop around in it and take a copy of what it might have recorded.
He installs no tracers or anything, but he takes one of the covers of holo-
crystals from the bag under the agnis, so that he can put a bug on it and put
it back in the bag, using Bit as a diversion, if there is need to trace the
agnis in the future.









Jordan plays with the switches on his suit and prepares for the trip to
the airlock. His helmet mask goes down giving him an eerie appearance due
to the fact that the inner helmet lights are busted, but HUD displays can
be seen reflecting off his face. As he approaches, he activates his motion
scanner and tries to log possible targets. He also observes what the others
are doing and tries to work in unison with them , all the time quiet as a
door mouse.








"Do any of you know how to run diagnostics on this thing," Horne says as he
starts to clean the blood from the bulkhead.



Azabi stares back and then at Mahlel and shakes his head. He slings the
his shotgun on his back and proceeds to help with the clean up. Finally,
Azani speaks,knowing that the danger has passed.



"Sure is messy down here, I wonder what happened..." as he flecks of blood
that has freeze dried onto the walls. Eventually the mess is cleaned and 
some engineers appear to run diagnostics on the airlock.



Azani leaves and relaxes a lot more. He doesn\'t know why, but for some 
reason he feels more tense everytime a stressful situation occurs. 



"Gotta relax alittle," he mutters to himself. His stomach rumbles, reminding 
him that he ashn\'t eaten yet.



He strolls down the corridor, with his helemt in hand and shotgun at back
anticipating the prefab food broth at the mess hall...









An hour later, still holding the now-cold coffee mug, Bishop strides
into engineering.  At first glance, nothing about him looks out of place,
until crew members realize that that\'s exactly the problem.  The one 
object that should be conspicuously absent is the AGNIS unit floating 
silently behind his left shoulder.  A number of double-takes occur, and 
several glances are made towards Abuko, who was, until a moment ago, 
working diligently on the damaged AGNIS unit abandoned in the crew lounge 
the night before.  The bent holo-bot, several of it\'s access panels now
removed, still lies silently on the workbench next to Johann.

    

Bishop walks over to Abuko and stares down at the smashed robot.
"Well, if you can actually repair that thing," he gestures at the
dismantled unit, "more power to you."  Setting down the coffee mug,
he carefully picks up the main housing, so as not to dislodge any probes
or loose components, and with his free hand, grips the holo-chip access
tab and pulls.  Then he pulls a little harder.  Finally, he sets the
unit back down and picks up a pair of heavy grips, which he applies
directly to the tab.  After a grunt and a protracted tug, he gives up
and drops the grip back on the workbench.

    

Casting up and down the bench, his eyes lock onto a pulse-proximity
laser cutter.  Picking it up, along with a pair of protective goggles,
he checks the charge on the cutter.  Satified that it\'s at working levels,
he dons the goggles, turns and announces, "Eye cover kiddies, laser tool
in use!"  Once he\'s reasonably certain that everybody is safe, he thumbs
the "ON" stud and applies the tip of the cutter to the access tab.

    

PI-PI-PI-PI-PI-PI-PING!! shrieks the metal as the thermal change
in the AGNIS housing drowns out the hiss of the cutter.  Bishop quickly
cuts two more dotted lines along the access tab, then the entire cover
comes loose and falls onto the workbench with a tinny clatter.
    

Bishop thumbs the cutter off and lays it down on the bench.  Carefully
avoiding the hot edges of the opening, he reaches into the gap and pulls
the pair of circular holo-chips from their slots.

    

"Got you, you little bugger." Bishop smiles grimly.  Turning to
Abuko, he says, "Sorry about the mess, but I didn\'t expect it to yield
much more than spare parts anyway.  Still, if you can actually get it
to work again, well, another one never hurts."  With that, he pockets
the holo-chips and heads for the exit.

    

As he reaches the hatch, he spots \'Vouf and he stops in mid-stride.
With a malicious grin on his face, he remarks, "Hey \'Vouf, I\'ve got good
news and I\'ve got bad news.  The good news is, I got the entire IceCapade
cart-wheel on chip.  The bad news is, the angles so bad, I probably won\'t
be able to use it!"  After a pause, he continues, "Maybe you\'d consider a
repeat performance!"  Then he ducks out into the corridor and flees, leaving
the almost empty coffee mug sitting on the otherwise orderly workbench.



"Eyeskepeyd Khartweel?" \'Vouf blinks at the retreating Bishop, then reaches
into his pocket for his well-thumbed Vuakedh/Galanglic Dictionary With Idioms.
"Eyeskepeyd, eyeskep-- harf! Got it! \'Escapade\'! Okay. But, \'Eyesk...\' What\'s
the-- \'ICE\'?" His voice trails off into a look of utter horror. "Ice Escapade!
Kae, kakh TSAKHA!" He begins feverishly flipping through the book again. 
"Khartweel, Kartweel, cart wheel... O Kae NO...." He drops the dictionary on 
the deck, and claps an armored fist to his eyes as if in sudden pain. "He 
didn\'t. He couldn\'t! He WOULDN\'T DARE!" His voice rises to a shriek, as he
pelts down the corridor after the now-long-gone journalist.

	

"BISHOP! YOU CRUSTY-FLANKED LITTLE TAILSNIFFER! I\'M GONNA EAT YOUR EYEBALLS! 
I\'M GONNA WATER YOUR ALCOHOL! I\'M GONNA GRIND YOU UP AND FEED YOU TO THE 
LAWYER! YOU\'RE DEAD, Y\'HEAR ME? DEE EE AY DEE, *DEAD*!"
	

A pleading note enters the tirade. "Bishop? Gimme that crystal, Bishop! 
I\'m not gonna ask you again.  Adrian!  Samshkarkh ROUKH!  Come back here!
I promise I\'ll leave you alone!  I\'ll give you that interview you wanted!"



He raises his fists above his head, and his bellow is heard all over 
the ship:



"********* ADRIAN! AAAADRIAAAAAAAAAAANNNNN! *************"






Horne and his crew get to the airlock. "Well now that we are here we might
be able to figure out what went wrong. Run diagnostics on this thing, and I
guess we ought to clean up the blood.  Azani, Mahlel, do either of you know
how to run diagnostics on this Damn thing, if not we will have to get some
engineering type down here. Let\'s get t\'work.


Damn, this makes no sense." With that he starts cleaning up blood from the
bulkheads while the others run checks on the airlock.



"Holy sheeit," Ralf says quietly.  "Look at this."  He\'s got the air lock 
control panel removed from the bulkhead.  It looks like the victim of a
blow torch with an attitude.  "This .. whatever bypassed all the normal 
interlocks.  That iris valve only did what it was told -- to close.
Unconditionally.  


"I sure wouldn\'t trust ANY doors on this ship until we check \'em over."







Dr. Limner\'s voice comes across both the Science and Generalist
channels.  He seems somewhat subdued:



"I\'ve been rather busy with the medical emergencies lately.
 Now that that\'s...over, I\'d like to get back on track.  I
 had been on my way to my grav bus.  I have a great deal of
 equipment stored there, mostly designed for planetary
 expeditions, but some of which is useful at interplanetary
 ranges.



"I\'m used to working basically alone, so I have pretty much
 everything you\'d need to explore a planet, except for the
 equipment which was too big to remove from my ship.



"Perhaps we should discuss what equipment we need to take,
 so that we can avoid too much redundancy in the away teams\'
 equipment.



"Also, what types of long range scanners are available on
 our ships?  We should make sure that we get all of the
 information we need..."



Limner\'s voice appears to have been trailing off a bit
throughout the transmission.  Without picking up the volume
at all, he continues:



"We\'ve already paid for this expedition with blood.  I hope
 we can avoid this in the future, but we\'ve already found
 out that this mission is going to be anything but simple.
 We have a job to do, however.  Let\'s redouble our efforts
 and do it right.



"Limner, out."







"Dr. Limner," Bhyarrvouf replies over the Generalists\' channel, 
"You might want to compare notes more closely with Ralf, who also 
has a fairly well-equipped grav unit with different emphases than 
what yours probably has.  Mister Witfield has nominal authority 
among the Generalists, but this matter lies in a grey enough area 
between Science and Generalist matters that you can probably act on 
matters as you see fit."



"Both Mister Witfield and Mister Edmondsen should be brought up to 
speed on any gear that requires in-field unsupervised use, and....
hrm....I\'m forgetting someone....Hrr, yes! Mister Robins! If she\'s 
finished getting over that hangover she and Blaine were planning 
after the Jump, you should get her up to speed as well. I\'m going 
to be occupied with something very important today, so I won\'t be 
able to join you all. \'Vouf out." 





"On the generalist channel, Ian\'s voice pipes in:"
Does this mean I\'m *officially* a scientist now?











Dr Van Der Merwe is engaged in the singularly depressing task of 
reviewing the autopsy reports, when he hears a faint bellow echo 
throughout the ship.



"********* ADRIAN! AAAADRIAAAAAAAAAAANNNNN! *************"



Seconds later, this is followed by the sound of shoes pounding down
the corridor decking.  The sound abruptly stops just outside the closed
hatch to the sickbay.  The hatch hums open and Adrian Bishop, face

glistening with sweat leaps into the compartment and jabs the door
control.  As the hatch hums closed, Bishop sags weakly against it,
his sides heaving with laugher and lack of breath.  Tears of glee run
down his cheeks as he doubles over with joy.  The laugher eventually
dissolves into a fit of coughing, leaving Bishop almost totally devoid
of breath.

    

"Heeheehee... whew!" he chuckles.  "Well, he probably... hahhaha...
probably won\'t be able to... heehee... find me in here for a little
while!"  Then his face goes straight for a second.
    

"Oops!!" he blurts and quickly palms the hatch open.  The AGNIS unit,
all this time waiting patiently on the other side of the doorway, floats
silently into the compartment.  Bishop hazards a quick glance out into
the corridor, then thumbs the hatch closed again.

    

"Hi doc," he grins at Van Der Merwe.  "Having this bloody thing bobing
outside is as good as putting up a sign that says \'HE\'S IN HERE!\'.  Well..."

    

Then he pauses, and his animated manner evaporates as he studies the
silent injured forms laying in the beds.

    

"I\'m... sorry to hear about Silvmane." Bishop says.  "I didn\'t know
him but I\'m sure he was a good man."

    

"I... ah... I was thinking that now might be a good time to have a
chat.  I haven\'t had a chance to talk to you, and I\'d like to find out
a bit more about the Alcyon\'s Chief Medical Officer," he adds, "if you
don\'t mind, that is."

    

Settling into a nearby chair, the AGNIS unit hovering at his shoulder,
Bishop undergoes what might be termed \'a profound change in behavior\'.
He is suddenly the epitomy of a professional network interviewer.  Even
his appearance is more settled and relaxed.  He has obviously found refuge
in the one thing with which he feels the most comfort: a one-on-one interview.

   

"Perhaps you could talk a bit about your background."  Bishop begins
smoothly.  "I believe your home is in the Marches.  Is that correct?  Also,
I am told by members of your medical staff that you\'re quite the published
physician.  And, that you saw action in the Fifth Frontier War.  Tell me
about yourself, please."









Twice a day for the first few days after Jump an odd, slightly rythmic, 
thumping sound can be heard in the vicinity of the Talisman\'s gym-room.  If 
anyone approaches the gym they hear a voice, barely audible above the other 
sound, coming from the room.



Etienne is standing near one wall with his back to the door, wearing nothing 
but a pair of shorts.  He is facing a body-suit of ballistic cloth armor that 
seems to have been stuffed with odds and ends and lashed to a post.  The suit 
may once have been well made, but it is now very ragged looking, with a number 
of patches.  Etienne holds a classic en-garde position for a second then 
explodes in a series of formal strikes to the dummy.  None of his blows are 
pulled in the slightest and the cloth draped form rocks with each one.



As he executes each blow he mutters something under his breath.  It seems to
be a long list of names, with those of the dead and wounded members of this
expedition at the end.  Among the names are one obviously Varg name, two that
are probably Aslan and, surprisingly, one that can only be Zhodani.  When he 
finishes the list with "Silvmane", he drops back into en-garde, holds it for 
second, then starts over.



His body is quickly covered with sweat, and as time rolls by, his blows
become weaker and less accurate.  When he reaches the point where he can barely
keep the tip of his blade up, he collapses to his knees and remains there, head
bowed, for several minutes.



A short time later, showered, shaved and dressed in a clean flight-suit, he
enters the main lounge.  He orders some food and proceeds to eat while 
watching the action centered around Sub-commander Bhyarvouf.



Etienne rises as \'vouf leaves and follows him out into the hallway.




Bhyarrvouf hears, if not the light tread behind him, the reopening and
closing of the Lounge door. He turns and sees Etienne following him, 
and says mildly, "H\'lo, M\'syoor de Mer. On your way to the Lounge, looking
for me, or both?"


vouf





[Etienne hurries to catch up with Bhyarvouf...]



  "Sub-commander, may I have a word with you please?  Officially."





  "There is a delicate matter I need to discuss with Commander Ger, but I 
haven\'t been able to find him.  It may be critical."



"Certainly.  And you can also tell me, and I\'ll pass it on as well."











Vouf:  (late that night)

"We should decide on a search pattern," \'Vouf remarks as the airlock
cycles, allowing the four into the Paladin\'s dark, silent interior.
"I think we should split up based on our epxertise... M\'Lord Ger, I
think you should access the computer and scan his logs for unusual
behavior or anomalous systems failures before his death. Lazer, check
out the turrets, missile magazine and the ship\'s locker. Christian, 
glance over the Bridge before the Count gets settled in, then check 
the cargo hold and staterooms. I\'ll take Engineering and Avionics 
myself.  Agreed?"



It quickly becomes obvious this is a highly modified type S.  The computer
and security systems are dormant, and seem to be TL16+.  So is most everything
else on board.



<Ger>

Sounds good \'Voof. Just be careful in here, we don\'t know if there is
any latent security devices.  Ger follows Christian and \'Vouf to the 
forward section of the ship.  When Christian is done inspecting
Ger begins to access the computer.



Christian nods, and assuming there are no further objections, walks with
Ger to the Paladin\'s bridge. As Ger busies himself with the main computer,
Christian checks over the other bridge stations and runs some tests,
looking for anything unusual.



The holodynamic display is set up to make the entire bridge part of the 
display.  All of the sensors, and on command all of the sensors of the 
other ships as well, are tied in.  When engaged, the bridge disappears
entirely, leaving Ger and Van Der Merwe "standing" in space, in zero g.
The intense, deep blue glow of the jump grid covers everything, and the
outline of the Alcyon is clearly visible covering the "starbord" side
of the view.



As their eyes adjust, they can make out the shape of the single, form-
fitting acceleration couch.  A somewhat closer examination reveals 
proximity and contact sensors, and numerous suit plug-in sensors, located
all over the chair.



Christian checks with Ger to see if he\'s found anything. 



"The computer recognizes me, \'Vouf, and Hammer.



"Got some synaptic, robotic, and AI stuff in here.  And and incredible
array of sensors.  Kinda makes me wonder if we need the Alcyon\'s.  All 
three of these tag-alongs got better gear."



When finished on the bridge, Christian proceeds to slowly walk to the
stateroom and cargo hold, taking his time to look through each area
with caution and great thoroughness, his senses alert to the smallest
anomaly.



...Not quite your average boarding mission.



Twenty years of combat reflexes keep playing Lazer false, expecting hostile 
fire at every door, twitching for the rifle that wasn\'t there, demanding 
_speed_ before a counter could be mounted...



No. One step at a time, keep checking the scanner.  Just keep your eyes up
and your ears open.



\'Vouf rips open the access panels to the avionics section (well, not 
literally), and enters. He spends a long time downloading data from
the instruments, checking internal monitors of airflow and other environmental
factors, examining the instruments and sensors for tampering, and checking
behind access panels (walls, floor, ceiling) for hideyholes and hidden
compartments, being especially careful to scan for any sort of boobytrap,
either a tripwire, a switch, or an electric-eye beam in UV, visible, or
IR. 



\'Vouf we have some more problems to discuss. Things are still not going
well. Actually I think that this is the most error-prone mission I\'ve
ever been on.



"Error-prone, m\'lord?" \'Vouf\'s laugh is half sneer. "I\'m assuming that you\'re
relying on sarcasm and absolute politeness in choosing your words! Nobody
this "error-prone" would have made it onto this mission at all, I\'ll bet. And 
it isn\'t an error when an iris valve mutilates a man, or a ceiling duct 
ruptures and kills one man and nearly kills another, or an entire crew sleeps
for five days and some of them don\'t wake up at all. If you want a 
confirmation of your suspicions, m\'lord, you have it from me." He nods grimly. 
"We\'re being sabotaged."



At that \'vouf lifts up a spent air canister and bares his teeth.


"Found this plugged into the Alcyon emergency air supply connect.  It was
buried in there *REALLY* deep.  So deep only a really good engineer
who knew what he was doing could plant it.  Nayduz got set up, but good
and we lost a good man because of this."



"Here guy.  Some chemists are gonna wanna see this."
Once that\'s said, he hands the tank to Christian, and walks down to 
the Engine Room and repeats the process again, stopping just short of 
disassembling the engines.





Lazer runs as thorough an inspection of the weapons systems--yes, that\'s the 
right attitude--as he\'s ever given any of his own ships.  



Whoa, what\'s this?  The weapons are all auto-relayed to the bridge and
main computer.  Hmm, only a software switch to transfer control to Thule.
good.  Unusual weapons, too.  A missile rack and some kind of plasma
guns on the turret.



He leaves the weapons locker for last, figuring if he\'s going to find 
anything, that\'s the most likely place.  Opportunism is the key...keep 
the eyes open and the brain running, and be damned sure to recognize 
what you\'re looking for when you find it.



Computer keyed.  Recognizes Nayduz, Ger, \'Vouf, and  Hammer!?  grrr.
Lazer gets Ger to open the locker for him.  He whistles softly.  Captain...









                          **** Day two *****



[I don\'t have any intelligence from R-alpha for day two or day three...RJ]





<Andon>

Hey Lazer,  I\'m going to be down at the vehicle bay, I\'m to keyed up, I need
to keep myself busy for a while.



<Go and hunt down Ralf>

Ralf, I think we were just about to do some checking of the vehicles before
we were so rudely interrupted.  How about we get back to it?



Andon will spend a long time rechecking the vehicles and giving Ralf a hand
with making adjustments, if he comes down.  Andon will continue working until
he is very tired, he has trouble getting to sleep after an alert in which
he can\'t do anything and working helps him unwind.











Christian leisurely finishes his lunch and disposes of the meal in the 
handy recycler. Standing up, he brushes a few crumbs from his gray 
surgery fatigues and scans the room, before his gaze locks in on an 
unfamiliar individual and he strides over to meet the new addition to 
the bio/medical team.



With a wide and relieved smile, he reaches out and gives Jan a firm
handshake, then sits down across from him. "Welcome aboard Doctor Yorblin,
I\'m afraid I\'ve been busy up until now, sorry I wasn\'t there when you were
thawed out so that we could get acquainted. I\'m Doctor Christian Van Der
Merwe, (Order of Starship and Crown), the Chief Medical Officer and leader
of the Bio/Medical Team. Glad to have you aboard doctor, we\'ve been a bit
short-handed until now. What is your medical expertise, Doctor?"



"Pleased to meet you, Sir Christian,"  Jan says as he extends his hand.
He is still wearing the scout TL15 vacc suit he had on in low passage,
but he does have a ship\'s comm dot on.  Jan stands about 6\'6", is pale
bordering on albino, has a white hair in a belter cut, and a white handle
bar mustache.



"Don\'t know if you had a chance to puruse my portfolio before ya thawed
me, but why don\'t I tell ya a little about me.  Finished med school at the
IISS Medical Academy on Stroud.  Did a four year residency in adult intensive
care medicine in the belt in the Stroud system.  Took the board certification
as an adult intensivist two years ago when I went on detached duty.  Been
doing that since then with a focus on reconstructive medicine post space
injuries.



"Figured it was time to get back into exploration, so when I was offered
a spot on the Alcyon, I went ahead and took it.  Before becoming a doc
I was an exploration branch generalist -licensed as a watch standing pilot
and junior navigator.  Got some other skills that make me handy on a
dirtside trip, stuff like weapons handling and recon, things you probably
aren\'t too concerned about."



Christian seems genuinely pleased. "Good! They way things have been going on
around here, I could use a good critical care and reconstructive man. Anton
Devious, who is in a deep coma now, had his foot amputated by an iris valve,
so maybe your expertise would come in handy if we tried to reattach or
regenerate."



"To return the favor, let me tell you a bit about myself. I\'m certified by the
Imperial Medical College in xenomedicine, specializing in Vargr trauma
surgery and neurology, and in bionics. After graduating from the University of
Deneb Medical school with honors, I spent a few years as in the IISS R&D
branch, doing teaching and research; I wrote a number of papers on both of
my specialties. After that, I transferred into \'the field\' as a flight
surgeon and after I picked up my ship operations skills I was assigned as
a courier and \'travelling doctor\' of sorts, looking in on all kinds of
remote posts and such. That\'s how I picked up my ship, the Aurora."



"Anyway, seeing as I was up, I went over the patients you still have in
the sickbay.  What sort of workload do you me to start out with, and
on which patients?"



"As I indicated, Anton is the worst case. I\'m not sure we can do anything
about his coma, but if he comes out we would have to consider regenerating
or replacing his foot. Obviously I have a bionic replacement covered, and
you have regeneration. So you could keep an eye on him. The other patient,
Daniel Silvmane, needs extensive help with rehabilitation after that LH2
accident. If you can handle these two, I have a prior investigation that I
have to attend to. I think that\'s about it; questions?"







Ralf and Andon notice \'Vouf transferring his grav bike to the Command Shuttle.



	Geez, tight fit, but if he can manage it.  I\'d have just

flown it around the outside.  But then I guess this was in jump?



	Ralf comments that anything that big he expects to be 

pressurized for comfort :-)



"Actually, it IS pressurized," Vouf says mildly as he rounds the bend.
"It runs smoothest at high altitudes." And then he\'s guiding it
down to the vehicle docking areas, and is lost to sight.


The armory got a shock today when Rigo Edmonsen bumped a box
(a cube of some flat-black material, about 2\' high) which has been
lying around since the start of the trip.  The box responded with 
a short klaxon and the appearance of a radiation warning sign (a
large red dot with three red trapezoids extending from its edges)
for a few seconds.


Ger walks quietly into the lounge that evening with a large bundle of papers
and a portable computer. He walks to the autochef, and orders a nutri-meal,
and nutri-beverage. After a nod in \'voufs direction he heads over to a corner 
of the room sets up the computer, and spends the next hour or so shuffling
papers, typing on the keyboard, occasionaly talking to himself, and oh yea,
infrequently partaking of the "meal" ordered.



(perhaps some of the people gathered wonder.."He actually reads all the
reports that I send him?? All the way through?")








                      **** Day three *****



Well after the furor of the post-Jump repairs has died down and gradually
been replaced by the relatively routine run of security work and scientific
prep for the long-awaited arrival at R-Alpha, probably the second or third
day of the Jump, Bhyarrvouf vanishes. He\'s not in his cabin, nor on the 
Bridge, nor in the Engine Room, the Alcyon\'s Sickbay, or on the Talisman.
The only person who seems to know anything at all about the disappearance
is Count Ger, whose only comment is, "He is attending to urgent personal
business today. He will be back on duty soon enough."







That night, as the crewmen who aren\'t on duty gather in the mess hall to get a 
bite of supper, \'Vouf comes in with Dr. van der Merwe, laughing and chatting
amiably. Christian seems a bit wrung out yet happy, a far cry from his misery
and exhaustion of the past few days of watching Devious, Hammer, MT, and 
Nayduz either die or get put in coldsleep tubes. \'Vouf is absolutely bubbling
over, happier than anyone\'s ever seen him and not caring who notices. He 
saunters over to the autochef and barks, "Bloodvark, raw, bite-sized chunks."
Christian orders his meal right after that, and picks up both trays, carrying
them to an empty table. He and \'Vouf sit down, and Christian begins 
alternating between feeding himself and popping bits of meat into Bhyarrvouf\'s
mouth. Anyone who gives a closer look at the pair upon seeing this bizarre
behavior will instantly notice the reason: \'Vouf\'s cybergloves are gone. In
their place are two sheaths of resilient polyfoam, from which only his 
fingertips are visible, held rigidly in a splayed position. He rests them on
his lap as he eats, and they twitch occasionally but otherwise don\'t move.






Fitz will come over, gnawing on a chicken wing and ask, "Ey, \'Vouf, what
happened to yer mitts?..."



"You have something to do with this Doc?"



Working his way through a particularly nuclear sort of chili, Christian grabs
a hunk of warm bread straight from the compu-galley and begins to slather it
liberally with synthobutter. In between bites and spoonfulls of chili (and
ballistically tossing bloodvark chunks at \'Vouf -- clearly Christian hasn\'t
been attending to himself of late and is ravenously hungry), he looks up at
Fritz and deadpans: "Sure did, I recommended that he attend to his hygine by
washing his hands before dinner. We just had a difficult time persuading some
of those twenty-year microbes that they could find another home. Last I looked,
I think they were chasing after Bit, yelling something about new tenants..."





\'Hey, If you\'re not going to be needing those mitts, mind if I take a look at
them, they were pretty neat!\'



"Oh, hi, Fitz," \'Vouf says between bites. "My gloves? I took \'em off. First
time in nigh on twenty years, actually. Decided I couldn\'t postpone washing
under my fingernails any longer-- hrf hrf hrf...." He chuckles. "And no, you
CAN\'T take a look at them, no offense. They\'re kind of personal, y\'know?"



Devoting himself to his cuisine, Christian mutters something under his breath
about curiosity...





\'Vouf sighs, but holds out his hands to be inspected. They bear an astonishing
resemblance to human hands from what Fitz can see, with the fingernails very
large and hardened, almost but not quite clawlike. "For your information, 
Fitz, we call them \'hands,\' because they resemble human hands so closely. 
Aslan have paws, K\'Kree have hooves, Hivers have tentacles, and Droyne, Humans 
and Vargr all have hands." The difference between his arms and legs is 
startling, the most obvious sign of genetic engineering by the Ancients: his
arms and hands are quite humanlike in nature, but his legs have the powerful
haunches and enlarged tarsal bones of a dog\'s legs. "My feet have pads," he
says, "Which is why I go barefoot when I\'m off-ship sometimes. But the hands
don\'t. The Ancients did a pretty good job, hrf?"



>Fitz goes back to nibbling his chicken wing.  "You ever try any barbeque sauce
>on them \'chunks\'?"



"Barbecue sauce?" \'Vouf blinks. "Is that the sort of sweetish, spicy stuff the
Solomani smear on charred animal ribcages? Can you get that here?" He glares
at Christian in mock anger. "Yer not taking very good care of me, aenrra!"





    Just as \'Vouf prepares to intercept another bloodvark chuck tossed by
the good doctor, a hand descends on his shoulder while it\'s mate snatches
the piece of meat from the air inches from \'Vouf\'s jaws.  Looking up, he
locks eyes with the ship\'s resident snoop.
    "Greetings, your furriness," smiles Adrian Bishop.  "Hi ya, Doc...
Fitz.  How\'s tricks?"  Then Bishop looks down at his hand, clutching
the hunk of raw bloodvark.
    "Yeee-uuch!!" he grimaces, gingerly dropping it onto the table.
Searching about, he spots a napkin which quickly absorbs the mess.


Bhyarrvouf sighs gustily. "Bishop," he groans, "Don\'t do that. I could\'ve
taken off a finger, and you know it."



Still deeply involved in assuaging his hunger, Christian favors Adrian with
a wearily tolerant eye. "What\'s the matter Adrian, did the INS cancel your
breathtaking interview of the Deputy Assistant to the Undersecretary in
charge of the Adjunct Department for Sucking Up to Lucan?" (grin)



"No," \'Vouf corrects him with a grin, his ears coming up a bit, "Actually he\'s 
onto the trail of a hotter target these days, aenrra. Seems he\'s got the goods 
on a mysterious Vargr whose past is shrouded in mystery and whose present is 
all too concrete...." 



    "Look," Bishop grins at \'Vouf, "I can see that you\'re REALLY busy right
now, but maybe when you\'re finished, we can do that little interview you
\'promised\' me in the hall two days ago, hmmm?"  Holding up an innocent-
looking holo-chip, he glances pointedly at \'Vouf\'s hands and continues,
"After all, in your present state, I guess I don\'t have to worry about
you shooting me, do I?"



Christian glances up at Adrian. "If you think that\'s all you had to worry
about, Adrian.... (meaningful look)" With a darkly humorous chuckle, he
returns his attention to selecting a delectible dessert, looking briefly
at Bhyarrvouf, as if to share an inside joke.



"C\'maahhhhn, aenrra," \'Vouf chuckles, "Don\'t spoil my fun! If he\'s expecting--
whoops!" He looks over at Bishop again. "Almost gave it away. Can\'t have 
that, now, can we?"



    "I\'ll be in the lounge, when you\'re ready, OK?"


"Say good-night Adrian.  Cigarette? Blindfold?"



"I\'ll take the blindfold but no cigarette.  They\'re bad for your health."
Bishop positively beams as he walks out of the room.  It must be the drugs.



After he\'s gone, \'Vouf shrugs and finishes his meal with Christian\'s help.
He then gets up, yawns, stretches, and says to no one in particular, "Tonight
and tonight only, in the lounge, for the amusement and edification of the
Alcyon\'s crew: SubCommander Bhyarrvouf demonstrates that he CAN in fact kill,
dismember and eat a grown human in under five minutes. Without using his
hands." He strides out, licking his chops. 







Hey, Thul, wanna make a wager?  I say \'Vouf can do it.
Farouk over.



Heh!  I don\'t bet on foregone conclusions....

I have their first three books namely Ground Vehicles, ACV and Aircraft. The designs are based on Striker not Megatraveller. As far as Ican tell all vehicles/craft etc are built at TL15. All heavy weaponry isMD or CPR guns. The reason given being their cheapness. However I tend todisagree with that as i think it is hard to hit flying grav vehicleswith CPR rounds fired from ground level. All the vehicles seem to be designed with the thought that grav vehicles will be rare if any and willbe used in the CAS role. Interesting stuff. However they seem to knowa lot about CPR rounds and they have all sorts of neat rounds like APERSand FAE rounds etc. 
Overall well done. If you play in a 2300AD type Megatraveller with noantigrav then this is a great value. Otherwise they are good for theirexcellent art.

***notes***
I need to fix table numbering (speed moved to Rating/Evaluation section)The length table is only partially filled in...
***unix notes***
Some of the tables (and a few lines) are misformatted due to transfer problems.If you have any questions, ask.  (they should be obvious, even if not lined up)

INTRODUCTION
	Humaniti\'s progress in transportation technology has reached a number of plateaus over the millenia.  Currently, the highest reaches of Imperial technology are found in its starfaring vessels.  But these are often overshadowed in importance by other craft: small craft, atmospheric vehicles, and sometimes waterfaring craft.  As a Naval Architect, I\'m proud to present these rules for designing waterfaring craft in MegaTraveller.  They cover designing displacement-based watercraft, surface and submersible, including Hydrofoils.  For hovercraft and grav vehicles, refer to the basic design charts.
	Waterfaring craft (Ships and Submarines) have a number of advantages in low (and even mid and high) tech societies: reliability, cost, and size.  While ships may be sunk, much less effort is required to crash an airplane or grav vehicle.  Also, ships with broken engines usually have plenty of time to fix them.  Aircraft tend to just crash...  Even the lure of the sea still remains a pull to some.
	These rules are a variation on the Referee\'s Manual basic vehicle design system.  As a variation, they use the same form and many of the same elements as the basic system.  You must be familliar with the vehicle design system to use the Waterfaring Vehicles rules.
	Note that these rules can just as easily be used for vessels in Liquid Methane seas, liquid Mercury, or whatever fluid you can find to want to use.  (Refereee\'s, here\'s your lead in for \'Methane Pirates of Planet X...\')  In non-water seas, the changes for the rules are noted.  As a handy reference, the relative densities for some other possible/common liquids are listed here (as well as if they are cryogenic):
 
TABLE 1: Liquid Densities/Specific Gravities	Liquid Hydrogen: 0.07 (Cryo)	Liquid Helium: 0.09 (Cryo)	Peterochemicals (Oils): 0.7 - 1.05	Liquid Methane: 0.28 (Cryo)	Water: 1.0	Mercury: 13.5	Liquid Nitrogen: 0.81 (Cryo)	Liquid Oxygen: 1.14 (Cryo)	Alcohol: 0.8
	
0. OVERALL DESIGN 
	Waterfaring ships are designed using a modified version of the basic craft design rules from the Referee\'s Manual.   The most significant changes are in the Locomotion section, where the speed of the vessel is determined, and in the importance of weight.  Waterfaring vessels are usually designed from a weight-critical and volume-secondary standpoint, different from what most MegaTraveller vehicles emphasize (volume).  Keep this in mind when you\'re using these rules.	Surface Vessels must always way less than their volume in kL.  Submarines must weigh as much as their volume, when ballasted down.  Anything that weighs more than its volume for any reason sinks to the bottom of the sea, wherever that sea may be.  In non-water seas, multiply this allowed weight by the specific gravity of the liquid.  Archimedes principle is hard on heavier-than-water vessels.
	 I hope you enjoy being able to add seafaring vessels to your craft design reprotoire.
 
1. HULL DESIGN
        Waterfaring vehicles are designed using the normal hull design rules.  The minimum armour rating guidelines are: 
Table 2: Minimum Armour	UCP	Minimum Armour	50,000+	24	40,000	22	30,000	20	20,000	18	10,000	16	5,000-9,000	14	1000-4000	12	200-900	10	20-100	8	11-19	6	5-10	4	4-	2

	Odd sizes are as usual treated as the next largest size.  Hull extensions (Turrets or Superstructure) are allowed,as are open topped vehicles, but the stability and length calculations are based on the unmodified volume.
 
	Submarines use a different formula.  A \'Operational Depth\' is chosen, representing the deepest that the submarine is capable of diving safely.  Divide the Operational Depth by 20, multiply this by the world\'s surface gravity, and determine what the armour modifier (not rating) is for that number.  The armour rating corresponding to that modifier is the required armour rating, unless the Surface Ship minimum armour is greater, in which case the higher value is needed.
	(Depth/20) x g = req\'d. armour multiplier
	Submarines also use different rules for hull extensions.  Submarines are not allowed to be open-topped.  They are required to have a hull extension in the form of ballast tanks, and usually have one for a Sail (fin sticking up).  The ballast tanks percentage must be between 5% and 35% of the hull volume.  This extra volume is unavailable for other purposes.  Sails may be any size up to 10% of the basic hull volume, and add half of their volume to the interior hull.  Both ballast tanks and sails simply multiply the base hull cost and weight by the added percentage.  Ballast tanks are necessary to allow the submarine to submerge.  When surfaced, the tanks are filled with air to keep the sub at the surface.  This added bouyancy is released when the sub dives.  Note that the ballast tank volume is also the percentage of the pressure hull that may flood without rendering the submarine unable to surface.
	Length for submarines is calculated for the volume of the hull plus the ballast tanks.  Weight for submarines while submerged should be multiplied by 1 + the ballast tank percentage to account for the added water in the tanks.  In non-water seas, divide the ballast tank volume requirements by the density.
 
	Waterfaring vehicles may use any hull configuration except open frame (Config 0) or Irregular (Config 7) or Planetoid (Config 8 and 9).  Immobile bouyant structures may be Irregular configuration if desired, but are not self-mobile (must be towed).  Larger waterfaring vehicles are usually Box or Needle configuration.  Submarines are usually Cylinder or Needle configurations.  Smaller vehicles can also be found that are Wedge and Cone configurations.  Sphere and Dome/Disk configurations are very rare.
	A waterfaring vehicle\'s loaded weight must be smaller than its volume in kL (exception: submarines).  For normal vessels, the mass should be within the range shown below, for safety and stability.  Heavier vessels have too little freeboard (distance from water level to deck), lighter ones are too unstable (tend to be top-heavy).  For seas that are not water, divide the fraction shown by the local specific gravity of the fluid being designed for.
 
Table 3: Safe Weight to Volume ratios
		Min and Max safe loaded weights 	UCP	(as fraction of volume in kL)	5000+	0.15 - 0.75	1000+	0.15 - 0.66	100-999	0.15 - 0.50	25-99	0.15 - 0.45	24-	0.10 - 0.35 
 
	In addition, when the hull is selected, the Hull Length and the Length Speed Factor are determined also.  
        Hull length (Referred to as \'L\') also must be determined.  The basic length is given below for all UCP values.  If you want to interpolate, the basic formula is that hull length is the length of a box with relative dimentions 8L*1W*1H and a volume of 4/3 the hull displacement.  Configuration and Streamlining modify the length as shown:
 
Table 4: Streamlinging Length Modifier	Streamlining	Length Modifier	Unstreamlined	x 0.75	Streamlined	x 1.0	Airframe	x 1.25
 
Table 5: Configuration Length Modifier	Configuration	Length Modifier	1 Needle/Wedge	x 1.25	2 Cone	x 0.75	3 Cylinder	x 1.0	4 Box	x 1.0	5 Sphere	x 0.33	6 Dome/Disk	x 0.5
 
Table 6: Volume/Length Table	UCP	Length	0.007		0.019		0.037	3.2	0.056		0.074		0.093		0.111	5.0	0.130		0.185		0.25	6.6	0.5		0.75		1.0	10.5	2.0		3.0		4.0		5.0		6.0		7.0		8.0		9.0		10.0	22.5	11.0		12.0		13.0		14.0		15.0		16.0		17.0		18.0		19.0		20.0	28.5	25		30		35		40		45		50	38.5	55		60		65		70		75		80		85		90		95		100	48.5	200		300		400		500	83.0	600		700		800		900		1000	105	2000		3000		4000		5000		6000		7000		8000		9000		10000	225	20000		30000		40000		50000	384	60000		70000		80000		90000		100000	484	200000		300000		400000		500000		600000		700000		800000		900000		100000	1,040
 
2. POWER SUPPLY
	Choose any power supply available from the design charts in the Referee\'s manual.  Note that, as in land-based installations, there is often a tradeoff bewteen output and reliability made: If you lower the output power of a powerplant by some factor, the maintenance requirements (and probability of breakdown) and fuel requirements also decrease by the same factor.  At TL7 and below, powerplants often are seen with effeciencies 10% or lower than the book values, soley to decrease maintenance costs and increase safety.
	In addition, the Solar Cells system has to take into account that on planetary surfaces, Night cuts the solar power down to zero.  An alternate source must be provided, or the vessel will drift at night (not always safe).

	A new type of engine is available, the Steam Engine, at TL 3 and 4. 
Table 7: New Powerplants				FuelTL	Description	Power Out	Price	 Kl/Hr3	Basic Steam	0.05	500	0.0154	Steam Engine	0.10	750	0.015
 
	All steam powerplants weigh 1 ton per Kl and burn hydrocarbon fuels.  At TL3 this is usually coal or wood (solid), requiring 1 crewmember (stoker) per 10 Kl powerplant (per shift) over and above other crew needs.
	Submarines are a special case.  While submerged, they may not in general operate a airbreathing powerplant.  At lower tech levels, Submarines normally install batteries (giving limited endurance underwater).  Fission power sources solve this problem (as do fusion, and fuel cells, which also require Oxygen as per airless worlds rules).  Submarines also may not operate a Solar Power system while submerged.
 
3. LOCOMOTION
	Surface water vehicles may or may not have a suspension (hydrofoil), and all water vehicles must have a Transmission (Propellor or similar system).  Using a Hydrofoil suspension changes the nature of the final Speed calculation and makes the vessel more vulnerable to catastrophic damage from groundings etc.
 
Table 8: Contact Based Hydrofoil Suspension	(all values per kL of suspension)Type	Power	Weight	Price (MCr)Hyd	0.04	1.5	0.05
	Minimum volume of suspension is 5% of vehicle volume.  A hydrofoil syspension is optional.
 
Table 9: Contact Based Water Transmissions	(all values per Mw of powerplant output)TL	Type	Vol.	Weight	Price(MCr)3	Paddlewheel	3.0	5.0	0.254	Propellor	2.5	2.0	0.255	Propellor	2.0	1.0	0.256	Propellor	1.5	0.5	0.257	Propellor + Elec.	1.0	0.5	0.28+	MHD Drive	1.0	0.25	0.15
 
	The TL 3-6 Transmissions are directly connected to the powerplant.  At TL7 and above, the system is an electrical generation/electric motor system, and the power can be utilized for other purpses if the craft is not moving at full speed.
	This transmission is in one or more units (propellor/shaft or equiv.).  The maximum power per shaft/propellor unit is the square of the Tech Level in MW.  If total installed power is more than this, there must be as many shafts as the installed propulsive power divided by the TL squared (round up).  
 
4. COMMUNICATIONS
	Communications systems are installed as per the Referee\'s Manual.  The range required depends on the intended range of the vessel and the size of the planetary oceans.  A good rule of thumb is that a vessel should be able to communicate all the way across the largest ocean it\'s intended to cross.
 
5. SENSORS AND ELECTRONICS
	Sensors are the same as in the Referee\'s Manual, with the addition of the Sonar sensor system.  Sonar comes in two types, Active/Passive (pingers and passive sensors) and Passive only (passive sensors).  Active Sonar has the same characteristics as a Radar system, but with one range band less range.  Passive Sonar ***
 
Table 12: Active/Passive Sonar
	Weight in tons by TLRange	6	7	8	9Long	0.5	0.01	0.005	0.001Very Long	2.0	1.0	0.1	0.05Distant	5.0	2.0	1.0	0.1V. Distant	-	10.0	5.0	1.0Regional	-	25.0	15.0	5.0
Table 13: Passive Sonar
	Weight in tons by TLRange	6	7	8	9Very Long	0.1	0.05	0.01	0.005Distant	0.5	0.1	0.05	0.01V. Distant	1.0	0.5	0.1	0.05Regional	-	10	5	1Continental-	20	10	5
 
Table 12&13 notes:	Sonars have a power requirement of their weight in tons.  They cost MCr 1.0 x their weight in tons.  Volume is the weight in tons  x 2.

	In addition, a simple depth sounder or fishfinding sonar (minimal imaging ability or directionality) is available for one-tenth the size and cost of a Very Long range sonar of the same TL.
 
6. WEAPONS
	Waterfaring vessels may have any listed weapons installed.  In addition, a new weapon (Torpedoes) are available.  At low TL, Guns are favored, with the emphasis changing to Missiles at TL 7, and somewhat to Beam Weapons (Lasers) by TL 8 to 9.  Waterfaring Craft may mount any starship (hardpoint) weapons, with the same restrictions as other craft.
 
	***torpedoes***
	Note that underwater explosions are naturally tamped by the surrounding water.
 
7. SCREENS
 
	All standard screens may be installed.  In addition, three new screening devices are available for sound screening.
	Anaechroic Coatings are a passive hull coating available for any size hull.  They reduce the sound signature by  x 0.5, and weigh 0.01 ton per KL of vehicle.  They cost MCr 1.0 per ton.  Anaechroic Coatings are available at TL 8; early coatings ( only reduce signature by  x 0.75) can be found at TL 7 for the same size and cost.
	Bubble Screens are active equivalents of Anaechroic coatings.  They also reduce the sound signature by  x 0.5, and weigh 0.025 ton per KL of vehicle.  They take 0.1 MW power per ton and cost MCr 1.0 per ton.  They are available for any surface ship except hydrofoils at TL7.
	Noisemakers are decoy bouys, at lower TL\'s simply bubble and sound generators, by TL9 they include sonar jamming electronics.  A noisemaker launcher costs MCr 0.05, takes 0.1 KL volume, and weighs 0.1 ton.  Noisemakers are MCr 0.05 each, and require 0.05 KL and weigh 0.05 ton.  Noisemaker effectiveness is dependent on TL.
 
8. BRIDGE	As Referee\'s Manual.  Until TL 8, waterfaring vessels don\'t usually use a computer for controlling more than Sensors, Screens, and Weapons.   Also, most vessels don\'t need more than basic environment, and never (except Chemical/Biologically sealed) need more life support than the world\'s environment demands.  Lights and heat usually suffice, and except for passenger vessels, are usually fitted only to operations areas (not cargo areas).
 
9. ACCOMODATIONS
	Waterfaring Craft use the standard accomidations rules.  Subordinate craft may be carried as shown below.
	Carrying subordinate craft requires three elements: hangars, elevators, and a flight deck.
	First, there must be hangar space for the vehicles.  For grav or other Referee\'s manual designs, use the listed subordinate craft volume requirements.  For COACC aircraft, fixed-wing aircraft require 60 KL per ton of design weight, and folding wing aircraft (and helocopters) require 40 KL per ton.  Other watercraft require the same as Referee\'s manual listings (dependent on size), and don\'t need elevators or a flight deck.  Land Vehicles also don\'t require a flight deck or elevators, but do need some way of being landed.
	Second, there must be elevators to move the vehicles from the hangar to the flight deck.  They are not required for vessels with a less-than-total flight deck.
	A flight deck is where actual flight operations take place.  It may have any area up to (maximum) 0.15 x L^2 (one sixth L squared).  Minimum area is the largest of 20 % of hangar volume (in meters square per Kiloliter) for the largest helocopter aboard, 15% of hangar volume of the largest VTOL aircraft aboard, 10% of the hangar volume of the largest grav vehicle aboard, 100% of the volume of the largest STOL aircraft aboard, or 200% of the hangar volume of the largest normal takeoff aircraft aboard.  STOL and normal aircraft need that much space to take off and to land.  A single deck area may do both, but not at the same time.  Dedicated carrier ships often have seperate launch and landing facilities for aircraft.
 
10. FUEL
 
	Evaluate the fuel needs and cargo as per the Referee\'s Manual.  Normal fuel needs are determined by determining speed at 0.75 max power,  dividing required range by this speed, and multiplying by fuel usage.  A safety factor of 25% is normally added.  Some military vessels will have an endurance requirement in days or weeks rather than required range.
 
WATERFARING VEHICLE DESIGN EVALUATION
 
	After going over the design carefully, the vehicle Universal Craft Profile is generated from the design.  The UCP for watercraft is slightly different than for other vehicles, the exceptions being noted below.
 
CraftID	Watercraft type codes are preceded by \'SW\' for Surface Watercraft or \'SS\' for Surface Submersible or submarines.
 
Hull	List the normal hull data, and additionally include the hull length.
 
Power	As normal vehicles
 
Locomotion	List the power-to-weight ratio and the loaded and unloaded cruise and maximum speeds.  Cruise speed is speed at 0.75 maximum powerplant output.  Speed is determined as shown below.
        The speed of a ship depends on its hull length, it\'s power to weightratio, and a factor of how \'fat\' (bulky or wide) the vehicle is.  The speeds listed below work for all speeds that watercraft are practical.
	The formula for determining speed is:	Speed(kph) = (LF/g) + PWR - (W/L)/50g
	For Hydrofoil vehicles, this is 	Speed = 2 x PWR - (W/L)/50g
with a minimum resulting speed of twice the hull\'s LF.  Hydrofoils slower than this cannot get \'foilborne\' and lift out of the water.

	For submerged Submarines, the formula is	Speed = 2 x (LF/g) + PWR - (W/L)/50g
 
        Definitions:
                L=hull length in m                 LF=hull Length Speed Factor of the ship (see below)                P=ships\' power, in kW (power in MW x 1000)                W=ships\' weight in metric tons                PWR=Power Factor, depends on power to weight ratio (see below)                g=local gravity in G\'s
 
	The Length Speed Factor (\'LF\') depends on the hull length.  It istabulated below:
 
Table 10: Length Speed Factor
	Hull Length	LF	50+ m	L/10	25-49 m	0	15-25 m	-3	8-14 m	-6	7- m	-10
 
        The Power Factor (\'PWR\') is a direct function of the power to weightratio.  Multiply its powerplant output (in megawatts) by 1000 to find powerin kW.  Divide this by the loaded weight of the ship in metric tons to find the power to weight ratio.  Look up the corresponding PWR factor on the chartbelow.
 
Table 11: Power Factor	P/W	PWR	0.033	2	0.066	4	0.15	6	0.30	8	0.45	10	0.55	12	0.67	14	0.85	16	1.20	18	1.75	20	2.40	22	4.50	24	7.50	26	11.0	28	14.5	30	18.0	32	21.5	34	24.0	36	27.5	38	31.0	40	35.0	42	40.0	44	50.0	50	70.0	60	90.0	70	110.0	80	130.0	90	150.0	100	175.0	110	200.0	120	225.0	130	250.0	140	275.0	150	300.0	160	325.0	170	350.0	180	375.0	190	425.0	200
	higher speeds are impossible with floating ships.
 
 
Commo
 
	List all installed communications systems.
 
Sensors
 
	As Referee\'s Manual, but add Active Sonar Scan, Active Sonar Pin, and Passive Sonar Scan and Pin (if Sonars are installed).
 
	Active Sonar Scan: Active sonar scan difficulty is listed below:
Table ??: Active Sonar Difficulty	Range of Sonar	Difficulty	Long	Formidable	V. Long	Difficult	Distant	Difficult	V. Distant	Routine	Regional	Routine
 
	Active Sonar Pin: Same difficulty as Active Sonar Scan
 
	Passive Sonar Scan: The difficulty level for locating vehicles passively with sonar is listed below:
 
Table xx: Passive Sonar Scan	Sonar Range	Difficulty	Long	Formidable	V. Long	Difficult	Distant	Difficult	V. Distant	Routine	Regional	Routine	Continental	Simple
 
	Passive Sonar Pin:  Passive Sonar Pin is one level more difficult than Passive Sonar Scan.
 
Off	List all weapons as normal, including any Torpedo launchers.
 
Def
	List all defenses, including anaechroic coatings, bubble screens, and noisemakers (if installed).  For computing Defensive DM, Agility is effectively the top speed in KPH divided by 35 (round up) minus the Target Size DM (minimum Agility=0).
 
Control	As normal
 
Accomm	As normal
 
Other	Add the AcousticSig signature value to the ratings.  The Acoustic Signature is determined as follows:
 
Table yy: Acoustic Signature	Power Plant Output	AcousticSig	Over 10 MW		Strong	1 to 10 MW		Moderate	0.1 to 1 MW		Minimal	Under 0.1 MW	Faint
 
	Anaechroic coatings and bubble screens reduce the effective Power Plant output for purposes of determining the Acoustic Signature.
 
 
SPACECRAFT IN THE WATER
 
	There are several references to using spaceships as submarines and other watercraft in various places in MegaTraveller.  Most importantly, the safe operational depth must be determined for subsurface operations.  To find this, multiply the armour modifier corresponding to the vehicles\' armour rating by 15, and divide by the local surface gravity.  This is the safe operating depth in meters.  A normal starship hull (armour 40) is thus safe at up to 495 meters depth.  (This is slightly less than purpose-built hulls.  Spacecraft, while strong enough, tend to have weakpoints in airlocks and sensors and turret connections that lessen the safe depth.)
 
	Second most important is determining the operating speed.  Due to excessivly bad hydrodynamic properties, spacecraft use the following formula to determine in-water speed:
 
	Speed = PWR * 0.5  (surfaced and underwater equal),	with PWR in this case being determined by using the gravitic power (Grav modules or Thrusters) or Rocket thrust in tons.  Other propulsive systems are nonfunctional underwater.
 
	Note that it\'s quite possible to exceed the high end of the PWR system.  You may either treat this as a hard limit or extrapolate the table.  In either case, the vehicle has become very, very noisy, and is automatically detected on every available sonar system (and may be tracked visually on the surface if submerged).  Running at these speeds is usually less subtle than running on the surface, and to be avoided unless, for instance, there\'s a MK 48 torpedo about to test your hull armour\'s manufacturers guarantee.  (Note that heavyweight torpedoes at TL7, with a 1 ton warhead, will breach armour 40 and leave a 1-meter plus hole, a fact not lost of several of my players who tested the high end of this speed range for exactly that reason once...)
 
	Entering the water is safely done at speeds under 50 KPH.  If you touch down faster than this, the pilot must make a difficult piloting roll with a negative DM of the speed divided by 50 or suffer damage to the vehicle.
 
NOTES
 
	A few random comments about these rules and about waterfaring vehicles and activities.
	Remember that a submarine must weigh as much as its hull volume in KL to be able to submerge.  Several previous forays into watercraft in MegaTraveller have forgotten this basic fact and designed unsinkable submarines.
	How much deeper than Operational Depth may a submarine actually go before it implodes?  I\'ve used the US Navy 66% criterion (Operational Depth is 66% of the calculated crush depth), so theoretically you can go 50% deeper than operational.  Submarines are normally test dived to 20% deeper than operational.  Any further than this and the referee can start rolling their favorite accident system rolls for hull collapse.Damaged hulls often will fail at much shallower depths.

[Mea culpa, I reformatted this message so that words weren\'t broken over lineboundaries.  Guess I should\'ve become a writer rather than a programmer, huh?- - -- James]

Fellow Travellers,
I am in need of your thought provoking input on a number of MT questions.  Letme state that I am using the first editon/printing of the MT rules, thus someof these "problems" may be solved and I don\'t know about them.  Now, where tobegin...

1) Personal Combat - I\'ve resently started running a traveller campaign andthis is the first time that I have used the new MT rules.  I\'ve worked throughall the changes that have occured and thought I was ready to move into the newage of traveller, then I had to deal with personal combat.  Traveller was kindto PC with the combat system before, But NOW...  I can\'t kill anybody withoutHigh Energy Weapons...

I try to keep the military related gear out of my players hands... that gearis for the active duty types.  They went along with that fine, so everyone gotcloth armor ship\'s jumpsuits...  No problem, until the first firefight.  SinceI keep the lid on Military gear, most opponents have lower level stuff too...That when we found out that SMGs,Shotguns and Advance Combat Rifles CANNOTpenetrate even "lowly" Cloth armor.  I was stunned.  Topping that feat is theTL14 Vacc suit which will stop anything short of a Gauss Rilfe, ARL or LAG AProunds...  Even when you hit with these, most damage will be disapated...  Ican see the headlines now...  MAN IN VACC SUIT TAKES ROCKET TO THE CHEST ANDLAUGHS.  Now I can live with all the hand waving and scientific slips thatoccur for game sake, but NO DAMAGE without Penetration...  I know the 10%rule, but thats for uncovered areas only... a vacc suit covers all...

Slug thowers are and will be one of the most widely used weapons.  Kineticenergy is the easiest way to convey killing power.  Defensive technology willkeep pace.  This all equates to a police nightmare.  Thank god my players arenot all running around in combat armor or battle dress.

2) Personal hit locations - If we start to consider partial armor covering, asthe 10% rule seems to, why not use a hit location chart ala Aftermath.  I\'m
interested in your oppinions on this, if you use a system and how you work it
out.

3) Rates of Fire - Did they forget about this all together? Sure there is therapid fire rules, but you empty your clip and the auto fire rules cover onlyfully automatic fire.  I\'m sorry...  I may not be a marksman but I have fireboth pistols and long guns before.  With a 9mm Barretta (a travellerautopistol) I can aim and fire off 2-3 rounds in a 6 second period of timeaccurately.  At this rate it would take 30 seconds to empty my clip, but I amfiring at multiple targets also.  A submachine gun only firing 1,3 or 30rounds in a combat round...  I don\'t understand.  With this system an antiqueBlunderbuss (one player has one), a revolver, an autopistol, a SMG, an ACR andA VRF Guass Gun all fire ONE round every 6 seconds.  What was Marc Millerthinking about here...

4) Starship Hijacking - with the new rules about ship computers, this optionbecomes almost impossible.  No real critisism, but I would like to here howyou pull this caper off.

5) Starship combat rounds - 20 minutes... ummmmm...  I\'m sure that alot couldbe occuring in that time.  I realise that the distance can be so great, butmodern naval combat takes place at much longer ranges than that of WW2 combatand things move faster now.  I use 1 minute rounds and throw the movementscales out the window.  I\'d like to know what you do.

6) High Tech Gear - I\'ve got a number of player\'s reading GURPS Ultra tech andasking for conversions.  I agree with most of the stuff, but some things thatmake sense just don\'t work.  For example, construction cement.  I figure thatby TL 15 there would be some form of quick drying polymer that would be usedas material for roads, walls, etc. that is as strong, if not stronger, thanconcrete.  Now my players want to use this stuff as bulkheads in there ship.If the get boarded by bad guys (good guy to me), they just start pouring thisstuff down the halls to the bridge and engineering, thus sealing out theenemy.  How do you deal with logical technical advances that could throw thesystem out of whack.  Its the traveller equivelent of the +5 Holy avenger/runeblade/sword of sharpness.  ..  HHEEELLLLPPPPP....  See reference to question 4

7) Imperial Law Level - As I have stated, I keep the military gear in thehands of the military when and where ever possible.  I know that there are lawlevels for the member worlds, but what if any, law level do you aply toimperial space.  I know that every imperial marine force commander hasnightmares about garrisoning a starport that allows civilian merchants to armtheir security men with battle dress and FGMP-15s.  And should civilian shipsbe allowed to mount meson/spine mount weapons?

8) True Speculative Cargo - The trade and commerce section deals withspeculators buying and selling cargo, but the cargo bought is only supposed togo to the world where the ship is going.  With this in mind, the minimumresale price any good merchant captain will get is 90% of its selling price (2on dice+4 Broker +any Bribery).  What happend to the "What do you mean, youdon\'t want 10,000 snow cone machines... this is a desert planet you idiot".I\'ve got players wanting to buy TL15 household items, with replacement parts,to sell on any given TL11 -14 world.  How do you deal with this problem.

I must state that my campaign is running in 1113 pre-rebellion.  I would liketo see TDR replies.  Enough rambling...

Hi,
        I was messing around with sysgen4 the other I was wonder what theformatting commands the detprint produces are. Could some one help me pleaseI have been porting it to the ST and have had no problems. Now I am just makingit ST specfic (GEM windows etc etc etc), because I felt like it. (I must becrazy).

Comet Personal Speeder TL12

     Intended for the business market and for the high-end hobbyist, the Comet is one of the fastest personal vehicles on the market.  The HUD/comput-er based control system, the roomy seats and the inertial compensator system combine to make a flyer that is comfortable and easy to operate.

  CraftID: Comet Personal Speeder, TL12, Cr707,700     Hull: 1/3, Disp=1, Config=1AF, Armor=4F, Loaded=11.31t, Unloaded=10.98t    Power: 1/2, Fusion=4MW, Dur=3 days     Loco: 1/2, StdGrav=36t, Max Speed=2280, Cruise=1710, NOE=160,            MaxAccel=2.18G     Comm: Radio=Continental  Sensors: Synthetic Vision, Radar=Regional(500km), ActObjScan=Diff,           ActObjPin=Diff      Off: Hardpoints=1      Def: -  Control: Comp0*2, HeadsUpDisplay*1, DynLink*1    Accom: Seats=Roomy*2(Pilot, Passenger), Env=Basic env, basic ls,           inert comp    Other: Fuel=0.432kl, Cargo=0.3kl, ObjSize=Small, EmLevel=Moderate

Songbird Gravbike TL12

     The Songbird gravbike is produced by GliderDyne Industries of Lunion and can be found all over the Spinward Marches.  The basic design is considered to be a classic by gravbike enthusiasts and has remained unchanged for over 150 years.  The Songbird is intended for fairly light pleasure use, although its fuel cell and simple electronic system are robust.  The low power light grav propulsion system allows a much more precise control over maneuver than is found with a standard grav based bike such as the GliderDyne Mockingbird, making the Songbird a particular favorite among amateur precision aerobatic teams.  The rider sits on an unenclosed seat, making operation in inclement weather unpleasant.  No cargo space is provided, but up to 140kg of extra mass may be secured to the vehicle with straps without affecting performance, making some practical travel possible.

Mockingbird Gravbike TL12
     The Mockingbird gravbike is produced by GliderDyne Industries of Lunion and can be found all over the Spinward Marches.  The basic design is similar to the classic GliderDyne Songbird, but propulsion is provided by a less precise standard grav system.  The Mockingbird is intended for fairly light pleasure use, but can also serve as an affordable light general purpose transport for solitary users.  The rider sits on an unenclosed seat, making operation in inclement weather unpleasant.  No cargo space is provided, but up to 460kg of extra mass may be secured to the vehicle with straps without affecting performance.  Enclosed cargo compartments and an additional seat are common custom add-ons.

  CraftID: Mockingbird Gravbike, TL12, Cr6590     Hull: 1/2, Disp=0.037, Config=3USL, Armor=1F, Loaded=339.1kg    Power: 1/2, 2*FuelCell=0.14MW, Dur=95hrs     Loco: 1/2, StdGrav=1t, Max Speed=300kph, Cruise=225kph, NOE=40kph,            MaxAccel=1.95G     Comm: Radio=VDist(50km)  Sensors: Radar=Distant(5km), ActObjScan=Form, ActObjPin=Form      Off: Hardpoints=1      Def: -  Control: Elec*2    Accom: Seats=Open*1(Pilot), Env=none    Other: Fuel=0.057kl, Cargo=0, ObjSize=Small, EmLevel=Moderate

Brute Cargo Hauler TL12
     The Brute is a semi-automated heavy lift wheeled cargo hauler common on civilized TL12 planets.  Up until the availability of high output fusion plants at TL13, the most economical method of moving bulk cargo overland is to use large wheeled haulers on roads.  Most such road nets at these tech levels have automated traffic control systems, allowing the driver to be dispensed with for all but minor movements involved in the loading and un-loading of cargo.  Drivers are, however frequently carried for reasons of safety redundancy, or to allow pickups and deliveries to locations not served by the automated road nets.  The Brute is fully equipped to take advantage of these roads.

Tallis Class Merchant TL14

     The Tallis class merchants were built at Trin by TrinTechnics between 1004 and 1007.  The class was composed of 37 vessels, of which 23 remain in service as of 1117.  The origin of the class was somewhat unusual--in 956 the Planetary Navy of Trin had ordered a large number of Patrol Cruisers which were later cancelled (in 963) due to budgetary considerations.  The uncom-pleted hulls (ranging from 40-90% completed at cancellation) remained in orbital storage for 39 years while the contract cancellation case was in litigation.  Following the conclusion of the lawsuits, the hulls were sold for a small fraction of their original cost in a sealed bid auction to Trin-Technics and completed as fast merchants.  The thrusters are sufficient to allow take off and landing with a full load on almost any inhabited planet, freeing the ship from dependence on orbital facilities.       Many Tallis class vessels are operated with incomplete crews, allowing more than three middle passengers to be carried.  Stewards are seldom encoun-tered.  With the survivors of the class having been in service for over 100 years, careful maintenance is a high priority.  If found for sale, it could be expected that a Tallis would cost less than MCr45 at present.  Annual maintenance, however would be based on the original cost, and might run to as much as three or four times the original expectations.

As I was sitting around today, idly looking over the vehicle design system,I started to build a vehicle for Lydia--an almost airless world in the Glistensubsector of the Spinward Marches with a TL or 5 or 6.  (I figure it is a failed/exhausted mining colony, lsiding downhill fast with nothing but a fewthousand scavengers picking over the bones.)  The only non-airbreathing systemthat the inhabitants can use for power is batteries.  So I started to put2kl of TL5 batteries on a 13.5kl cargo sled (sort of lunar rover-ish), andrealized that those batteries had a theoretical cost of Cr1,000,000.  Notonly does this artificially drive up the control point requirement (which isbased on cost--usually okay, but batteries don\'t require the sort of sophisticated control that a 10MW TL10 fusion plant--also MCr1--would) butit seems ridiculously high to me.  If you followed the actual rules, thesetwo cubic meters of batteries would require a TL5 mechanical control systemoccupying 100 cubic meters, weighing 25 tons.  I don\'t think that will fiton the cargo sled. (-8 (Control Points=1000000*5 [TL]/100000=50.  Each mechanical control unit would supply 0.2CP, so 250 would be needed, and wouldoccupy 0.4kl and weigh 0.1 tons.)  I suspect the real thing could be controlledwith a big rheostat or the like.
     At TL8, we could compare the cost of real batteries to Traveller batteries--from work I did one summer long ago with an experimental battery company, I have it in the back of my mind that the electric cardemonstrator they had had around a 50kw-h battery.  (0.05MW-hr)  That\'s1.25kl of TL8 battery costing Cr40,625.  Does anyone have a handy Cr to $conversion factor?  
     As a first approximation, I think the price of batteries could be divided by a factor of up to 100, and that they could be made exempt incalculations for control factors.
     I\'d appreciate seeing any hard numbers that anyone has on current real-world batteries.  I don\'t want to skew things too much in favor of batteries,but as it stands now, there will never be an electric vehicle in Travellerdue to the cost factors.

	I have somewhat of a vested interest in knowing about batteries, sinceI\'m doing the electrical power subsystem development work for groundbreakingwork on Mars environment spacesuits with NASA 8-)

	The apollo suits used rechargable (but not recharged) batteries witha power density of close to 200 watt-hours per kilo.  This corresponds verywell with the listed TL6 battery (exactly, as it happens 8-).  I don\'t knowabout rob dean\'s Cr to $ conversion, I always used 1:1 myself for most things.

	Future developments are expected to give up to 6-900 watt-hrs per kiloin the next 10-15 years.  The best ones we have now are about 400 watt-hours/kg.

	My guess is that the TL5-9 numbers are accurate.  Above that, I can\'thazard a guess.

	I agree that the listed control point values are out of control.  I would suggest that a battery need only about 0.1 CP per ton, and that any req\'sunder 0.1 CP be ignored. 8-)

First, civilians (and presumably homicidal PC\'s) carrying FGMP\'s.  Marinesshould be capable of dealing with such people, otherwise they\'re useless inwars against Zhodani and Solomani troops who are thus armed.  If someone goesnuts with such equipment, the Marines operate as if it were war, which meansthey bring in heavy equipment.  Heavy equipment means APC\'s with BIG fusionguns, and if necessary a battleship.

Second, civilian ships with large weapons.  Judging by "Azhanti High Lightning"spinal mounts are forbidden to civilians.  I\'m not sure about bay mounts.Turrets are acceptable.  The one thing I am sure of is, no-one except theImperial forces may own nuclear weapons.

In the fine tradition of working on one thing to avoid another, I completeda few more designs today.  Included is the electric cargo sled mentionedin yesterday\'s post on batteries, as well as a TL13 Ship\'s Boat more or lessbased on the old Traveller "Slow Boat".  I always feel a little uneasy aboutusing the statistics for TL15 small craft when adding auxiliaries to lowertech level ships.

If anybody else out there has designs, I for one would be happy to see them.

Alcyon Expedition Recon Walker TL15

     This recon walker is a unique vehicle, custom assembled for the Alcyon expedition.  The expedition was intended to penetrate unknown space and the planners felt that it was advisable to have at least one capable back-up vehicle which was not dependent on grav modules.  The walker is fueled for up to four days of continuous operation including constant availability of surge power for the laser, but does not have extended occupancy accommodations.  It is therefore not intended to be occupied for more than eight hours at a time except in case of extreme emergency.  It is fitted with every sensor avail-able at TL15 plus a 25MW beam laser and 2 heavy robot arms to allow some outside work. The vehicle can be controlled by one operator, but two seats are provided.
     The transmission system is only capable of using 29MW of the engine output, and the maximum performance numbers given below are calculated at 25MW to allow for operation of the life support systems, especially the inertial compensators.  If full power was shunted to the legs, speeds of up 480kph on road, and 384kph offroad could be achieved.  It is likely that any crewmembers would be severely injured, if not killed, due to the inertial effects of traversing irregular ground without the compensators, and this mode of travel would only be used when controlling the vehicle by remote over-ride from the Alcyon.

Ship\'s Boat TL13

     This standard design ship\'s boat is produced throughout the Imperium.  Individual manufacturers attempt to boost sales with flashy advertising campaigns, but there is little substantive difference from one model to the next.  This version is a compromise between an atmospheric/interface opti-mized design and a deepspace independent operation design, and as such is found as an auxiliary aboard vessels requiring a general purpose capability.     No weapons are installed as shown, but 13.5kl of space and sufficient control capacity have been reserved to allow for the installation of any sandcaster and/or missile turret.  The ship\'s power plant is not large enough to allow for installation of a space combat laser, although in the current troubled times it would not be impossible to find these craft armed with whatever can be obtained, such as 20MW planetary combat pulse lasers, or even mass driver guns for ground protection.     The small cargo bay is accessible from a rear clamshell hatch, and has fittings for carrying a variety of specialized cargoes, such as 2 Imperial Standard 4 ton containers, or a up to a 6 ton class ATV or air/raft.

Electric Bug TL5

     The electric cargo bug shown below is a typical homebuilt vehicle from Lydia, a decaying former mining world in the Spinward Marches.  The planetary atmosphere is too thin to support combustion, and the level of retained technology is too low, to permit there to be any alternative to battery power for a reliable vehicle.  (Unreliable worn out higher tech vehicles can still be found.)  The operator and passenger of the bug must wear vacuum suits of some sort for protection while operating the open topped vehicle.

Ridiculous! Performance           looks ok, and no characters should be given an opportunity to buy           one of these things anyway (too valuable to their owners,            regardless of any assessed value in credits), so ignoring the            cost of the batteries entirely looks like a reasonable temporary           solution.  The "faint" emission level is an extrapolation not           covered by the rules.  The vehicle is small enough that passenger           weight might matter, so seats were figured at 0.1t rather than           0.02t, to allow for an 80kg nominal passenger.

Crusher Heavy Tank TL7
     The Crusher has been built in small quantities by the planetary govern-ment of Crout.  Its design reflects the high availability of fissionable fuels on the planet compared to the availability of hydrocarbon fuels. The Crusher units were formed more for purposes of prestige and overawing any potential rebels among the population than for practical combat use.     The three machine guns are mounted on a pintle by the commander\'s hatch in the turret, coaxially with the main gun, and in a ball mount on the bow.

     The Bayard is a limited use armored vehicle with a full tracked suspen-sion. Its armor is not intended to withstand direct fire by anything larger than a machine gun.  It carries a light infantry howitzer with a gun shield on a pintle mount at the forward end of the open passenger compartment for support of the squad, and has mounting brackets at the rear of the passenger compartment to allow the squad\'s light machine gun to be carried in a firing position.

Subject:  Batteries and Credits

I thought I\'d add my 0.02Cr worth on the discussion of batteries.Robert Dean mentioned that the vehicle was supposed to work at TL=5,6 range.  How good is battery technology at this stage?  This is the advent of the car battery and by TL=6 probably the best batteries in use were aboard submarines.  I agree that making space a function of cost is silly, (it ought to be tied to TL, total power output, duration and that\'s it) it doesn\'t seem too implausible that the sort of batteriesyou want would be prohibitively expensive at that TL.  I would suggest that the problem lies in the TL of a world where it is toolow to support people in the environment (TL 4 vacuum, for example,is possible on the tables, but ridiculous.)  I\'d set it up that the population (especially if they\'re miners) imported TL=9 typeitems and the low TL represented their own construction ability.There should be no problems with this if the population is small.

As far as the Cr to $ conversion goes, this is what I use:
Those objects that are not strongly technology dependent (handicrafts,liquors, food) convert from $ to Cr at a ratio of 1-1.Those objects which are strongly technology dependent (vehicles,computer technology, medical aid) convert from $ to Cr at a ratioof 10-1.  Some may argue with some of these (food being TL dependentor medicine being relatively cheap) but compare the cost of, say, treating an infection (using penicilin, et. al.) in 1950 with thecost now in real dollars and it will be lower now.  Of course quad-bypass surgery is really expensive now, but it could *not* be performed at all in 1950.  The cutting edge is always expensive, yesterday\'s technology is dirt cheap and the cost of human labor,in proportion to a society\'s available wealth is pretty constant(at least to first order.)  Some have claimed a 10-1 exchange,some a 1-1 and I think this strikes a nice compromise.  Of courseTraveller doesn\'t take TL differences in cost into account verywell, but there are a lot of things it doesn\'t do very well.  Anycomments?

I recently read the entire message archives of the TML, and noticed that therewas a discussion that was never really brought to a satisfactory conclusionregarding the handling of the JOAT skill.  As you may recall, the skill "allows one free retry at a failed skill roll per level of the skill" orsomething like that.  A review of the rules convinces me that this is supposedto be "free" in the sense of "free from needing to make a determination checkto avoid having the difficulty increase" as opposed to "free" in the sense of"pick up the dice and try again--if you\'ve got JOAT-8 you can roll eight timesand one of them is sure to be a hit".

The distinction that was apparently lost while this discussion was going on wasthat failed rolls still took time and still might damage equipment, at leastin my interpretation.  As long as you were dealing with safe skills, or situations that were not time restricted there would be little difference.

Example of the latter: Dr. Bertran Ode is attempting to access a database todiscover who the legendary figure Georgewashington really was:
  Formidable, History, Comp, 10 minutes
Since he has JOAT-6, he can try up to six times without checking to see whetheror not the task becomes "Impossible", but each attempt takes 30-180 minutes. Since Ode is sitting around in the University for two weeks waiting for hisbuddies\' starship to have annual maintenance work done on it, this won\'t bea problem, and the referee might as well let him make his six die rolls withoutworrying about time.  (Unless he is about to be interrupted by a Vargr corsairraid or the like...(-: )

Example of the former: Toban Dreer, pilot and owner of the Free Trader "LuckyDog" has just had a bomb disable his maneuver drive before achieving orbitalspeed on a liftoff from war-torn Timbucktoo.  He has JOAT-12, but regrettablyhis ballistic trajectory will intersect the the surface of Timbucktoo in sevenminutes if some maneuvering capability is not restored.  He quickly looks overthe boards and the sadistic referee informs him that repairing the maneuverdrive looks to be:

Routine, Engineering, Dexterity, 2 minutes

With a minimum performance time of 6 minutes per attempt, Dreer had betterfinish the repairs in one try, because his ability to remain determined isnot going to help him much one minute into his second attempt (even assumingthat he was so fortunate as to use the minimum time in the first failed attempt).


First----is this how people are playing it? Second--does it make sense this way?

Okay.  There is definitely a problem in Traveller with the effective-ness of armor (it\'s too good).  This includes the vehicle design system, too, since it is very easy to design an APC that will stop a 40mm armor piercing round, and run for three days on a tank of gas, and have a cross country speed of 70mph.  Mike Metlay, our resident historian and general all around Traveller theorist has commented on this problem before.  Hopefully, he\'ll jump in and discuss it this time, too.

I shouldn\'t have to say this, because a game that I pay thirty dollars for should work without tinkering, but I\'d increase the penetration of the weapons or decrease the armor protection until rifle bullets did penetrate cloth...or I\'d arm all security personnel with laser weap-ons.  However, I\'ve laid out a little chart showing how things work out now, using as an example an average character with Dex 7 and Weapon-2 skill, firing a rifle at a stationary man sized target at medium range, a difficult task, with a +1 for dex and a +2 for skill.

     2d6 roll  Chance  Type of Damage  Points (0 armor) Points (5)       2-7     21/36      miss          0                 0        8      5/36    marginal success 1.5=2           .15=0        9      4/36   norm. success      3               .3=0      10-11    5/36   excep. success     6              .6=1 (1 min)       12      1/36   +4 exceptional    12             1.2=1 (2 min)

The standard opponent (7/7/7) has hit points of 3/5.  In the case of the cloth armor (expected value of damage 0.2 per shot) it will take 15 bullets to knock him unconscious on the average, and 40 bullets to kill him.  On the microscale this is too many--one aimed shot should probably have the possibility of killing.  On the macro scale it isn\'t too bad.  In real wars thousands of bullets are expended per casualty.  By the way, a trained sniper (Wpn-4, Dex 10, +6 to hit, with 2 levels of tactics skill for a roving DM of +2) could use the pinpoint fire rule, and therefore get to count a normal penetration (as opposed to no penetration) with exceptional success damage modifers as follows
  
     2d6 roll  Chance  Type of Damage    Points (5)        2       1/36     miss              0        3       2/36   marginal           .75=1        4       3/36   normal success     1.5=2       5-6      9/36   exc success         3       7-10    18/36   +4 Exceptional      12      11-12     3/36   +8 Exceptional      24

That is, 21/36 (58%) chance of a one shot kill, and a 25% chance of a one shot knockout, for a total of 83% chance of removing the opponent from the combat per shot.  Maybe that isn\'t so bad.

What can I say?  Even a few policemen with laser rifles will keep the characters acting cautiously, without modifying the rules at all.

Too much trouble, and *I* don\'t want a combat heavy game in the play-ing.  All the GDW role playing games (except maybe Twilight:2000 because of its combat emphasis) spend too much effort covering combat in relation to how often it ought to occur.  (IMHO)

I won\'t defend the combat system extensively. It does look like there ought to be some sort of ROF rule for hand held weapons.  I tend to run games that don\'t involve a lot of shooting.  (You might look at Jo Jaquinta\'s excellent and amusing scenario from GaelCon\'89 if you\'d like to see how something like that might work--it\'s in the Sunbane archives.)  However, there is a reloading rule on the blunderbuss--in the Imperial Encyclopedia rather than in the combat rules where it ought to be.  See page 73.  A flintlock musket requires 18 seconds (three combat rounds) to reload.  The VRF Gauss gun damage and pene-tration numbers apparently factor in the rate of fire.

Oddly enough, since the players have always had their own ship (of some description) in every game I\'ve run, this has never come up.  I\'ve never felt that it was all that necessary to try hijacking the players\' ship, so it hasn\'t come up on the other side of the fence, either.  If I really wanted to take away the players\' ship without any chance of their responding, I\'d just haul out a 20,000ton navy-type cruiser and demand that they surrender or be meson-gunned.  One shot will annihilate any player class vessel.

Remembering that Traveller was once intended as the realistic entry in the SF games category, this sort of thing really doesn\'t bother me.  If you run through a few basic physics class calculations, you will see that if you want a 20 minute combat turn, and a 1-G acceleration to produce a 1 hex/turn velocity change, that this corresponds to a hex dimension of 14,112km.  If you were to go with the 25,000km hexes described in the Referee\'s manual, the physically correct time scale would be 26.6 minutes per turn.  50,000km hexes would give you a 37.6 minute turn.  At 14,112km per hex, the moon and the earth would be placed about 28 hexes apart on the map.  I don\'t worry about the fact that my lasers could be firing for the entire 20 minutes of the turn, because I think that it may take them that long firing in the general vicinity of a ship to hit it, because of the speed of light lag in targetting and the possibility of extremely small angular errors in the firing angle to result in a miss.  In addition, as I\'ll show, even a hit may not do much good.  For ease of calculation, I\'ll go through what happens when a ship intersects a laser beam fired from a 250MW beam laser turret.  The turret will be assumed to be stationary, firing without turning.  This means we can treat the beam as a straight line in space.  For sake of argument, let\'s say it is fo-cussed into a beam with a cross section of one square centimeter.  Let\'s also say that it is 50% efficient--current lasers are less efficient, so let\'s say it\'s a TL9 laser so that the rest will be reasonable.  This means that a 250MW input to the laser will result in a 125MW output beam.  

     Now for the ship.  Let\'s say it is steel, rather than some more advanced (and hopefully more resistant) material.  Besides, steel is basically iron thermodynamically, and I was able to look up heat capacities and heats of fusion (melting) for iron.  Crossreferencing to Striker from memory, a minimum spacecraft hull of armor 40 is 33cm thick.  To poke a hole in it with our one square centimeter beam will require that we heat the metal to the melting point and then add the additional heat required to fuse it in the time that the beam is on the ship.  Ignore beam travel and heat sink effects of the rest of the hull for a moment.  Assume that the ship is painted with an 80% re-flectant coating.  Only 20% of the incident energy will be transferred to the hull, the rest being reflected back into space.  I calculated that each puncture would require 248,000 joules (watt-seconds) (and that was figuring that the ship started out with a hull temeprature of 20 degrees C, a nice equilibrium with the comfortable interior temper-ature.  An insulated ship would have a lower starting temperature, and therefore take even more energy to heat up).  Figuring the reflectance and the efficiency of the laser, that works out to 2.4MW-sec.  Now, our 250MW nominal laser would thus need to be focused on this hypo-thetical iron column for about 0.01 seconds to melt a hole in it.  Suppose our ship, however, is travelling at a rate of six hexes per 20 minute combat round, and furthermore, that it is 50m long.  At the speed of 70560m/sec, it will cross the beam in 0.0007 seconds-- 1/1400th of the time needed to make a hole. AND THE ENERGY SUPPLIED BY THE BEAM WILL NOT EVEN BE CONCENTRATED ON A ONE SQUARE CENTIMETER PATCH OF THE SHIP!.  This translates to no damage from a single hit.

     Let\'s look at the angular problem for a moment.  Without even considering movement, a laser firing at a 50m long ship at a range of 50,000km must keep its fire within an arc covering 0.0000573 degrees.Let\'s say we had a 10m laser tube pivoting at the bottom.  That corre-sponds to moving the muzzle 0.001 centimeters (4/10000 of an inch...which is a high precision tolerance in machining.)  The longer the baseline of your weapon, the more accurately you will be able to aim it, but...

     If the ship is moving at a constant velocity, the situation becomes worse.  Using the 6 hex/turn example above, we find that to stay on target with our stationary laser requires us to track the ship at a rate of 0.08 +/- .0000573 degrees of arc per second.  Even assum-ing that we could move our gun at that rate, if our tolerance on firing angle was one percent of the movement, our chance of a hit has fallen to just over seven percent (per second).  Now, remembering that the ship will cross the beam in 1/1400 of the time needed to make a hole, and that a 50m by 20m ship has 10 million square centimeters of surface, I get the impression that I should multiply all of this together to get the answer that we will put a hole in a ship once every 2E14 seconds (once every 3 billion years).  Okay, so if combat works at all, it\'s a little better than that.  But it gets worse again fast if both ships are altering acceleration randomly, even over a small range, and the range is longer--lasers are permitted to fire at up to ten times the range I used for this example. All of this goes to support the thesis I advance once before--lasers and other beam weap-ons work by saturating the general vicinity of the target ship\'s predicted position rather than by precision aiming, making the 20 minute combat turn not only plausible, but generous favoring the attacker.

So, what do I do in the game, you ask?  Well, it hasn\'t really come up, but I\'d use the given combat system with the inertial movement rules (and probably the boards and counters, too) from Mayday, the old Traveller ship-to-ship combat game.

To pick on your specific example, I\'d start shooting the idea down like this.  First off, the stuff is likely to be no stronger that the current bulkheads, which means that the boarders can slice right through it with explosives or lasers or whatever.  Second, unless it is a foamed material, it will require a bag of the stuff as big as a hallway to make a wall--if your players are using all their cargo space to haul Plastiwall bags, where do they put the paying cargo? Thirdly, how are they going to get it into the hallway under fire?  You can always tell them that the special distribution tubes they have in mind won\'t work because the stuff will harden before it gets out of the tube, and you could always add a warning or two about the flamma-ble vapors produced, or the toxic byproducts necessitating extremely good ventilation.  Also, as Adrian said yesterday, there is the prob-lem of getting the goop back out when the battle is over...

I\'ve looked through GURPS ultratech in the store, but didn\'t think it looked worth buying.  The maximum Imperial tech level seems to be about equal to GURPS tech 10 or 11 at most, so that may clear up some problems.  Just tell them it\'s not available.

Civilian merchants who spend half a megacredit equipping each of their security guards are going to go broke, so don\'t even worry about it.  If they players insist, start reducing their cargo yields until they are going broke.  Civilian ships may definitely not have spinal mounts!  (The Oberlindes Emissary aside...) Besides, if the players have the money to buy the stuff outright, it\'s time to start over.  A meson gun-J (the small TL-15 standard one--think of it as an 8" cruis-er gun in WWII) costs 400MCr outright, not to mention the 12500kl fusion plant needed to power it, at an additional 2500MCr.  2900MCr will buy you about 78 200 ton Free Traders.

I haven\'t rolled too many merchant captains with Broker-4, but let\'s say that 90% is still correct.  That\'s 90% of the selling price, not the buying price.  I\'ll admit that TL15 industrial world goods can be sold at a profit almost everywhere--take the example of Glisten and Overnale in the Spinward Marches.  Glisten goods base buying price is Cr1500/ton.  On Overnale (Ag, NI, Starport B) they sell for a base of Cr9600/ton.  We\'ll make a bundle on every trip!  That\'s where the referee needs to be a little creative.  Say, Overnale is developing its own industry and has imposed a protective tariff of Cr10000 per ton on goods from Glisten that must be paid before you can even at-tempt to sell them.  Smuggling is, of course, illegal and not without hazard.  Let\'s also say that after you\'ve paid your tariff, you real-ize that an unbalanced exchange situation like this will have drained all the Imperial currency from Overnale long ago, so you can either accept payment in local currency (with an inflation rate of 150% per month) or in barter.  Of course, the local goods are only worth about a quarter of what the Glisten goods are worth per ton, so you have the choice of leaving three quarters of your barter behind (hope it\'s not perishable foodstuffs...) or accepting 3/4 of the price in rapidly depreciating ducheks.  Might as well send the crew on a spree in the starport to get of the ducheks since they\'ll only be worth half as much next run...of course, drunken merchants have a tendency to get into trouble in strange foreign towns.  Do you see what I\'m driving at? If there is a problem with a particular portion of the rules, invent some sort of explanation for why things won\'t work the way the players had hoped, and STICK TO IT.

Hope some of this is of use to you.  Hopefully some others will be inspired to comment, especially on checking my math in the laser combat example.  When all else fails, think in terms of analogies and remember that Traveller is supposed to be realistic.

I assume that the reason that batteries are not considered seperately in thecontrol rules is that no section is considered seperately. One would presumethat every section and several sub-sections would have its own multiplier tothe control point calcualtaion. This would make designs much more complicatedand I believe that they wanted to keep things simple.In most cases I\'m sure that the CP calulation is correct (averaged over theentire vehicle). But I can come up with some other examples.1a) Jump drive is incredibly complicated when it is running, but simple atother times, perhaps one can calculate CP like energy, and determinepeak requirements.1b) Jump drive should be far more complicated than maneuver, but they costalmost equivalent.2) Cold sleep equipment is cheap, but would require much more control thanthe average stateroom. Maybe there is some amount of local control assumedto be built into each cold sleep berth.3) Why are we required to use the central computing paradigm? Why nothave a network of smaller computers to provide the functions of the mainone?

Actually, one shot will annihilate ANY class of vessel.  A meson-T getslots of nice critical hits on small (<100k Ton ?) ships and lots and lotsof internal hits anyway (I seem to remember that it is about 17 :-)  Theonly chance of surviving a large meson gun hit it not to get hit.  This meansa very high agility (which is damn hard to get) and a big meson screen (whichis incompatable with agility :-)  I haven\'t worked out the probs to see whatthe best trade off is (yet????!!!! ;-)

Hopefully, TDR ship combat will try to rectify the short lifetime of largeships a little.  (will we let them live 2-3 turns not 1??? ;-)


I liked most of the rest of the information content in the article, I justcouldn\'t resist pointing out the \'obvious\' error ;-}


oh, and by the way a 20k Ton cruiser has a lot of trouble carrying a largespinal mount.  I designed a ship which was close to the minimum that couldcarry a meson-T, it was a large power plant with a HUGE gun hanging off it.I think it was 20k Ton total (nice size?)

By about 50k Ton you get a \'nice\' navy-type ship that can defend itselfsomewhat better.

My own answer as to what to do about the problems with MT combat andspeculative trade is -- throw them out.  I\'ve been working on a replacementpersonal combat system based on Snapshot, Azhanti High Lightning andStriker.  The first, partial draft is ready  for play-testing, just to seeif I\'m on the right track at all.  I\'ll be happy to send copies to anyonewho would like to do that.  NOTE: Don\'t expect snappy response: I\'ll beout of the office most of the next two weeks.  Also, don\'t expect a lot.It\'s really just at the proof-of-concept stage.  It covers only basic rangedcombat, so far.

Speculative trade is another sore spot.  Re-working spec trade was the primarypurpose of the now-defunct Trade & Commerce sub-list.  A number of usekicked around some ideas, and Greg Givler assembled a preliminary draft ofan expanded trade system.  I could dig that out of the archives and send itto you as well.

Trying to find decent gaming supplies in West Lafayette, IN is muchlike wandering about in a desert wasteland; lots and lots of NOTHING.(Odd, since it\'s only a few hours north of hte last reported locationof Traveller HQ...)

What I\'m looking for is basically a list of equipment, knick-knacs,junk,etc. (useful or not) that players might actually find. If there\'san on-line listing, could Some Kind Soul please send me some info forftp\'ing it, or alternatively, has anyone tried to compile somethinglike this for TDR?

When I said 20,000ton cruiser, I had in mind something like the Piranha classlight cruiser of the Imperial Glisten navy, which was posted here a good longwhile ago, and still available from the Berkeley site.

Its main armament is a Meson Gun-J, which doesn\'t get as many extra damagerolls as a MG-T, but will still do anumber on a small vessel.

(-8 Clearly, almost anything will destroy a player vessel...I just pickeda number that I felt was in the smallest region of the "obviously so big it\'shopeless category".

With regard to agility, you know my opinion on the topic--it should be basedon the size of the maneuver drive (as modified by thrust, for my tastes), so that a vessel that can maintain a 2-G acceleration with all weapons poweredwould have an agility rating of 2.

As you all know, the entire PBEM is soon going to be in the same "place,"which makes communications VITAL among all players. I need to hear fromeach and every one of the PBEM\'s people who are NOT part of the Alcyon\'screw: R-Alpha natives, and Aslan alike.

I would also likea volunteer to translate the master file, which is a .COM file for VMS, intoa unix aliases.text file, for those who\'d like it.

I would also like to hear IMMEDIATELY from people who do NOT plan to be backin the game next September, or who may have to change addresses etc. A lotof the plotline hoops we had to jump through this past year were to cover for people who vanished with little or no warning; knowing ahead of time whomay not be back will make things much easier for poor Richard.

INDUSTRIOUS CLASS TANKER TL7

     THE INDUSTRIOUS CLASS TANKER IS A WATERCRAFT SPECIALIZED FOR LONG DISTANCETRANSPORTATION OF BULK LIQUIDS.

CHARIOT CLASS SYSTEM DEFENSE BOAT TL13
  
     THE CHARIOT CLASS IS A STANDARD IMPERIAL SDB DESIGN. HUNDREDS ARE IN SERVICE WITH THE PLANETARY NAVIES OF THE INDUSTRIAL WORLDS OF LUNION ANDSTROUDEN IN THE SPINWARD MARCHES ALONE. WHILE THE FUEL SUPPLY IS SUFFICIENTTO ALLOW THIRTY FULL DAYS OF OPERATION AT MAXIMUM POWER, IT IS MORE OFTENSTRETCHED TO PROVIDE 75 DAYS OF OPERATION AT 40% POWER, ENOUGH FOR 1-GMENEUVER AND FULL LIFE SUPPORT.  IF OPERATED IN LIFE SUPPORT AND PASSIVESENSOR ONLY MODE, AS WITH A LOITER OPERATION DURING AN ENEMY ATTACK ON THESYSTEM, ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE POWER CAPACITY IS REQUIRED.  THIS WOULDALLOW THE VESSEL TO WAIT FOR UP TO 4375 DAYS BETWEEN FUELINGS--WHICH IS TOSAY, AS LONG AS NECESSARY.

Archive-Message-Number: 2282From: Simon Anderson <cse426@cck.coventry.ac.uk>Subject: Questions, AnswersDate: Mon, 15 Apr 91 16:42:38 WET DST

A thought on the batteries question :

The rules want you to have vast controls  for  the  expensive  batteries,when all you really need to control them is a dial marked "power". 

Why  not  take  the  extra  weight,  volume and price requirements beyondthose for the most basic controls (whatever you think  they  are  ),  andmake  them  the  requirements  to  recharge  the batteries. If you have avehicle powered by low-tech, expensive batteries, then  they  might  wellbe  simple  to  use,  but  recharging  them  would  take a very carefullyregulated power supply, with little room for error,  etc.  That  way  youcan  have  ONE  recharging  unit, with it\'s own power plant, for all yourvehicles. 

On the related point of weapons fire  being  unable  to  damage  hi -techarmours,  I  did  a  (quick) check on the numbers, and it worked out as 1point of damage taken per round fired at the armour. I used  the  figuresfor  exceptional  success,  assumed  skills giving +2 to hit, so a 7 + on2d6 was needed for 1pt damage to totally  enclosed  armour,  and  ignoredthe  fact  that  it  didn\'t  matter if you were firing .22 calibre pistolshots or 6cm calibre high-velocity cpr gun HEAP rounds!

On that basis, all the lo-tech, outclassed police forces need  is  a  fewsquads  armed  with  twin  machine  guns to throw 20 rounds each into anytroublemakers - their armour is unharmed, but they\'ve  been  knocked  outby  the  noise.  If  you  want  to be mean, then twin pulse lasers,  mass- - -drivers, or an autocannon (rate of fire at tech  5  is  listed  at  1500rounds  for  a  4cm bore, I *think* that\'s rounds per minute! ). Policingyour spaceport is now no problem, just put in a few  walls  between  yourbuildings   and  the  ships,  place  some  High  velocity  Autocannon  atstrategic points, and tell people they can\'t  come  into  YOUR  spaceportuntil  they  remove  THEIR TL-15 battledress. A cr 17,500 autocannon is afair swap for cr 60,000 TL-14 combat armour. 

Unfortunately, the rules seem unclear on a few points :

CPR Laser guidance is available for all cpr guns, so all  rounds  can  bespecified  as  hitting  a  single  target.  Very useful against people inbattledress, but does that mean you can only blast their general area  orhit  one  person?  What about targeting 2 people? And can you do the samething with Mass Driver guns and laser weaponry?

It  might  help  if  the  rules allowed for armour to be at least damagedupon receiving a hit from a 10cm bore high-explosive shell  from  a  highvelocity  cpr  gun,  at  point  -blank  range.  As it stands, a characterwearing tech 14 battledress might take up to  4  points  of  damage  fromthis,  on  a  perfect  hit.  This seems a little unreasonable, as I wouldhave thought they would need to someone to scrape them off the inside  oftheir  (undamaged!)  armour  at  that  point.  Maybe treating all totallyenclosed armour in the same way as vehicles would  solve  the  problem  -the  old  Traveller book 4, Mercenary, mentioned using HE rounds to knockout tanks by killing the crew from concussion - It\'s going to  complicatethe  rules,  but there isn\'t much difference between a set of battledressand a tank as it is.

I have been searching through books and adventures most of the weekendlooking up tasks for various and sundry things that players might do. Iwas wondering if anyone had ever compiled a list of tasks for variousskills, objects, etc - and published them. Most of the tasks I foundwere on equipment sheets or hidden away in the players manual. Has anyoneeven compiled all the one\'s in the player\'s manual into one sheet?

hiya,

I\'m about to flog a dead horse here, but while reading through the(old) boxed adventure (for starter traveller even) called Tarsus, Inoticed some more information that would clarify exactly where the 100diameter limit is.  I quote:

\' Break Out From Jump Space: The ship has just emerged fromjump space, and lies about 120 million kilometers from Hote(the central star). This distance is necessary because the shipcannot emerge closer than 100 diameters to any astronomicalbody. Since Hote has a diameter of about 1.16 millionkilometers, 120 million kilometers is a safe distance.  Goodnavigation has placed the ship as close as possible to Tarsus(Tarsus is about 50 million kilometers from Hote), about 70million kilometers distance.\'

This paragraph is pretty self explanatory and it might help clearup the fuzziness around exactly where you may jump from.

	"On multiple-time rumours, change the circumstances slightly and rewordthe tale enough to avoid that "broken record" feeling."
	This chaming piece of advice is part of a paragraph appearing in The Flaming Eye next to the section on rumours. Not once but at least FOUR TIMES![and I haven\'t even finished it yet!) In other places the repeat the tasks"To compute jump coordinates", "To prepare the jump drives for jump", and"To engage the jump drives" verbatim from the rule books at least twice inthe scenario. This is boring and useless. This is boring and useless. This is boring and useless. Sorry, it\'s just, it\'s just, begining to, it\'s just beginingto, become, become habit.
	Not to mention stupid tasks like "To cross landing field safely ina vehicle". It moderates mishaps but not failure.

Hello out there in the ether!
I have been an afficionado of Traveller for many years, but I\'ve never had to opportunity to play the game!  Odd isn\'t it?  I haven\'t been able to find anyone interested in playing until recently.
Now that someone is interested, I am having a hard time determinely where to start.  I would appreciate any mail from those of you whomight have suggestions for the beginning Traveller Referree (sp?).
Anyone who has interesting started scenarios, but especially anyone who can provide a step-by-step (almost) guide to conducting a Traveller session would be appreciated.
I have GMed extensively in AD&D, but for some reason...sigh... I just can\'t get thehang of Traveller.  It doesn\'t seem to get into floormaps, tricks and traps like the D&D stuff does.  Or am I missing something.
BTW, I have the starter stuff for "olde Traveller" as well as the starting boxed set for "MegaTraveller".  Any suggestions as to which is the better setup?  Can anyone help me understand what the differences are?
Thanks for your help!
Oh Yeah....Dale Poole     cadpoole@atlas.cs.upei.ca
P.S.   Is there anyone out there using an Amiga to help them moderate their games?  Any software suggestions would also be appreciated!

Dale, I promised you a detailed email letter, and this ain\'t it. But I canpass along a couple of things quickly:

1. Traveller (Classic or Mega) requires a very different mindset than D&D.Mapping, starship combat, trade and commerce, and fun toys are there for the people who enjoy such things, but the game relies more heavily on realroleplaying than D&D does, as the characters tend to have more depth and dimensionality than D&D characters do (assuming an equally talented player;I\'ve played with excellent D&Ders and with rotten Traveller players before).In general, Traveller adventures are more like D&D "wilderness campaigns"than dungeon adventures, although there are exceptions. Random gadding aboutfor gold and adventure isn\'t done much; people tend to have careers and goalsand get into and out of trouble following them.
2. The tools of Traveller tend to fall in the following categories: pushes(bad things that will happen to people if they\'re not careful), pulls (goodthings that COULD happen if parties strive for them), rumors, gimmicks, etc.Since there\'s no artificially codified means for advancement (there\'s a monsterevery few turns, kill enough and you go up a level, etc.), the referee has to have a more substantive game plot than the average D&D DM does. (Most D&D gamesare live-action Nintendo scenarios, from what I\'ve seen over the past 15 years.)

3. The easiest-to-run and easiest-to-start adventures in Traveller, which alsogive a bang-up description of a small and easy to digest chunk of the Imperium,are Classic Traveller Adventures 1, 2, and 3, and the Double Adventures 1 and 2, and THE TRAVELLER ADVENTURE trade-paperback. They\'re ALL out of print, whichis a shame, but they can and should be found and savored. If you read up on ALL of these books, or several of them, and get a good feel for jumping from book to book, you can run a campaign that will have new things around everycorner for years. Unfortunately, the adventures for MT as of now are pitiful atbest and godawful at worst...CERTAINLY no way to learn the game. (Who out therebesides me considers Murder on Arcturus Station to be the best idea and formatfor a RPG adventure in any game ever? I kept a party of experts tearing theirhair out for WEEKS with that one! |->
If you want to know more, others will have suggestions. But my first piece ofadvice is good enough to repeat at the last: throw away everything you know about D&D and start fresh.

I haven\'t mailed this out for a long time, and it\'s changed quite a bit.In it I outline how to use the TML Archive sites to get archives andpackages of interesting things like Errata, Traveller Game Aid Software,Official Sector Data, and Starship Designs.  The TML archives here atTML central have expanded to contain most things available from thesunbane server.

This handy quick-reference table indicates at a glance what is contained
at the various TML archive sites:

				---- What\'s there ----

	----	----	----	----	----	----	sunbane		ftp	all	all	some*	some	metolius	email	all*	all*	none	none	metolius	disk	all	all	none	none	ocf		ftp	none	none	none	all*	naucse		ftp	none	none	some	none

There are several different sites archiving Traveller Mailing
List-related materials.  The primary archive sites are called \'sunbane\'and \'metolius\', and there are special-interest archive sites at \'ocf\'and \'naucse\'.

There are different ways to request archive information, depending onthe site you get the archives from.  \'ftp\' indicates anonyomous ftponline file transfer.  \'email\' indicates reponse and data via email.\'disk\' indicates 3.5" DSDD MSDOS floppies delivered by the postalservice.

Also depending on the site, there are different materials available.\'Buns\' indicates the TML message traffic, about 9 megabytes in size.\'Pkgs\' indicates "Packages" of collected information: errata, software,official sector data, and starship designs.  \'Soft\' indicates additionalgaming aid software, beyond that available in the Packages.  \'Shps\'indicates starship designs, beyond that available in the Packages.  Theasterisks \'*\' indicate which site is likely to be most up-to-date for aparticular type of material.

SUNBANE ARCHIVE SITE

All the TML traffic (Bundles) and Packages, and some additional softwareand postscript deck plans, are available via ftp from sunbane:

	Host name:		sunbane.engrg.uwo.edu	IP Address:		129.100.100.12	Directory:		pub/traveller	Site administrator:	dan@engrg.uwo.edu (Dan Corrin)

The site is managed solely by the FTP Site Coordinator: dan@engrg.uwo.ca(Dan Corrin).  The University of Western Ontario is not responsible forthe materials and opinions stored in the archives.

METOLIUS ARCHIVE SITE

All the TML traffic (Bundles) and Packages are available via email orMSDOS diskette from the Traveller Mailing List Administrator,traveller-request@metolius.wr.tek.com.  I do this as time becomesavailable, every other week or so, so sunbane is usually the fastest wayof getting information, not metolius.  Sunbane is also better connectedfor sending lots of megabytes out across the networks.  If you stillwant or need to use the metolius archive service, I will gladly send youa detailed Bundle Table-of-Contents so you can pick and choose whichBundles look interesting.

For more information on receiving TML Bundles and Packages on 3.5"Double-Sided, Double-Density MSDOS-format diskettes, please write theTML Administrator via email at traveller-request@metolius.wr.tek.com.

OCF ARCHIVE SITE

The ocf archive site maintains the consummate set of MegaTravellerVehicle Designs.  There are literally hundreds of them available at alltech levels, sizes, and prices, from Starships to tricycles.  Themechanism for accessing the data via ftp is similar to the sunbanearchive, and the specific details are:

	Host name:		ocf.berkeley.edu	IP Address:		128.32.184.254	Directory:		pub/Traveller	Site administrator:	gwh@ocf.berkeley.edu (George Herbert)

NAUCSE ARCHIVE SITE

The naucse archive site contains some private software developmentrelated to MegaTraveller character generation.  The files there are 386PC MSDOS exeuctables (.exe\'s).

	Host name:		wew.ucc.nau.edu	IP Address:		134.114.32.3	Directory:		fixes,misc,gm	Site administrator:	wew@naucse.cse.nau.edu (Bill Wilson)

Announcing a new service of the metolius archive site! If you can\'t ftpthe archives from sunbane, and you can\'t deal with a barrage of email,you can get diskettes through snail mail for your PC.  I apologize for$1/diskette, but it costs Tek $0.81/diskette and I figure the extra$0.19 cents can go toward postage or my time spent.  I\'m NOT SELLINGthis stuff - just trying to cover expenses of supporting it\'sdispersion to the far reaches.

Subject: The WarGamers, Part 1/3Date: Tue, 23 Apr 91 09:50:40 PDTFrom: James T Perkins <jamesp@metolius.WR>


Howdy TMLer\'s, one of us, Theresa Verity, represents a not-for-profitassociation called The WarGamers, which serves as a liaison between RPGvendors and their customers, do playtesting, and serve as a publicationlibrary for paper and electronic information on Role-playing Games.I\'ve included some (somewhat edited) pieces of mail explaining what TheWarGamers are.

So here\'s Theresa:

- - ---- from message 1 ----

The WarGamers play all games and does not concentrate on one game orcompany - unlike the RPGA...  I\'d like to be able to tell everybodyabout us (so that we won\'t become just another large group of gameplayers) who is interested...  I\'d think that such information may behelpful for gamers looking for an established (yet so far onlycentralized in north Florida and southern Alabama - but we\'re growing)and Game-Company sponsored/recognized group.

So far we have 5 officers who overlook specific areas (finance, RP,Playtesting, etc), and have about 40 dues-paying members, and havecontact with 150 or so others.  We playtest for Bard, SJ Games, ICE(some times) - do reviews for SJ and Palladium, and are wholelysupported by: Bard Games, Palladium, FASA, SJ Games, GDW (a little),ICE, Hero Games...  We will be broadening out to Games Workshop, BTRC,and others in the coming months...

We have a 4 year history, and through that time have looked intosetting up nodes at out-of-town universities or gaming groups...  Inthe next few months (as soon as the paperwork is OK\'ed) we will berecognized by the Federal government as a non-profit organizationand donate funds made from our tourneys (1990 had 4 such events) tovarious charities - in return we will use the money appropriated forour organization to start a genaric gaming magazine that will bedevoted to ALL forms of RPG and ALL games no matter WHO puts them out.

- - ---- from message 2 ----

The \'Gamers have been around for 4 years.  We have 6 officers: one for eachof our most busy sections of interest: Role-playing, Strategy/Board Gam-ing, Playtesting, Computer RP/Strat, Finance, and an editor for theUntitled magazine...

We are currently awaiting 2 things: approval fromthe Feds that we ARE a recognized Non-Profit Organization, and ourmove to the office we have set up..

We are in no way controlled by anyof our sponsors and act independantly from them (the before mentionedRPG stores and the companies themselves) - sort of like a VERY free andVERY open RPGA... We enforce no strictures on WHAT game is played - thowe do not sanction open live-action Role-Play...

  We offer discounts (working on a couple of other stores in the Arizonaand outer areas), comradery (if that\'s a word), ability to playtest, useof the local libraries of RPG Source Material (and that\'s why I\'ve hityou guys up for your archives - they will be going into our library), andmany other things...  I\'ve put out a request at UWF to allow the WarGamersor the student UWF Gamers (our first spouter group) to have a permanentnode address so that we can get an edge in to keep in constant contactwith gamers from all over - we WANT to grow LARGE and we WANT to FURTHERgaming...

   Please feel free to write to me or the WarGamers at the following
addresses:   Theresa Verity              The WarGamers (in May)             130 E. Nine-Mile Rd Apt 25  10 Marshall Rd.             Pensacola, Fla  32514       P-cola, Fla  325??

   In May we will be moving into the new office (yeah|), and in mid-AprilI will be moving into a new apartment [Phone number elided - James].

WarGamer update info:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dated: April 4, 1991>From : Theresa Verity       Founder & Playtesting Officer

  Things that have taken shape in the WarGamers over the past couple ofmonths:

  MEMBERSHIP: We curently have a membership of many individuals and              have an influence over more than 150 more.  Membership              drives are taking place locally and in chapters trying to              form in other states and universities.

  COMPANY CONTACTS: We still do business with the following companies:

        Palladium Books              Games Designers\' Workshop        FASA Corporation             Iron Crown Enterprises        Hero Games                   Steve Jackson Games        Bard Games

    These company contacts in no way control our organization or it\'s    intentions.  All, except one, have donated books to our Archival Tomes    Library.  Out of this group we playtest for SJ Games and Iron Crown/    Hero Games, and on rare occasions we have had the ability to do the same    for Bard.

  OTHER CONTACTS: Amongst the regular gaming companies we are on the    playtesting list for FTL Software (makes Amiga RP Games).  We still    work with two local companies for our members\' gaming needs: Koby\'s    Hobbies & Hallmark Shop and Labyrinth Games.  Between both shops we    can usually get anything for our hobbies - and retain a 15-30%    discount on gaming/miniature merchandise.  Another shop, The Gold    Dragon of Mobile, Ala., is on the fringe of our main office\'s area,    and has offered a mail-order service with discounts for members.

  NEW CONTACTS BEING FORGED: We have been petitioning Games Workshop,    BTRC, and Accolade Software into looking at us as a playtesting    group - but this is in the infancy stage, no promises.  Members in    our home group have mentioned that in the future they would like to    work with: Palladium, GDW & FASA as playtesters, Lion Rampant,    R. Talsorian, and Task Force.  Some members have gone so far as to    ask about becoming a node of the RPGA (Officers ask "Why need to?"),    or want to playtest for TSR - I honestly don\'t think that TSR would    seriously consider us (they got in-house players and the RPGA)...

  A SPOT ON THE NET: That\'s right - as of April 3, 1991 we have a spot    in the BitNet and Internet that is available for questions about us,    and for the companies to communicate more quickly with us (and us with    them).  We are connected to the University of West Florida\'s node    as UWFGAMER@UWF.bitnet and/or UWFGAMER@UWF.CC.UWF.EDU for the InterNet.    This address is also where we will be holding a SMALL archive area    (our \'land-lord\', UWF, has asked us to NOT set up a discussion area    in our alloted space - as to keep CPU use percentage low)...  We    encourage node owners to send what the WarGamers or UWFGamers request    to that location, as that\'s where the online passive library will be.    Also, this address will be permanent as opposed to my personal account    which is terminated every semester.

  REGULAR MEETINGS:  We TRY to meet every month, but with as many people as    we try to invite we cannot accomodate them all - so this is what we    have decided to do: The WarGamer officers will meet every two weeks    to discuss new business and such - the meeting minutes are published    in a small leaflet and are distributed to the GMs of the larger games    in the area - the GMs are asked to make this document available to    their gamers in order to tell them what\'s going on.  Our chapters are    notified in a similar way.  If you chance by Pensacola one day you    can call us up at one of two numbers (after mid-May) which I will post    in the next couple of weeks - we\'d like to let you see what we are    doing in our home area.

  TOURNAMENTS: In conjunction with the Labyrinth and the RPG companies we    will be setting up another 3 tourneys for 1991, with the first in May:    Cave Quest II.

  PUBLIC OCCASIONS: In 1991 we will be throwing two "Meet the Public"    parties - one in the summer with BBQ anything (BYOB & BYOF - we    supply BBQ sauce, drinks, the lawn and some combustables), and the    other in December, just like last year (which was a huge success).    We publicize the events and advertise them in the local papers & area    TV stations through the public calendars they offer - then have a party.    These functions serve two purposes: 1. to unite the gamers together and    subsequently show us off to prospective members, and 2. Show the    Bible-Toaters that we aren\'t THAT bad... All of our tourneys and past    parties have been dry - no alcohol at all.

  WHAT WE OFFER: One of the largest gaming libraries available for members    to check things out of (2 weeks - also a list of these books is in the    next file called BOOKS|), ability to get into games or find players,    use of discounts at the stores, ability to playtest for some RPG comp-    anies, 4 years of stability and dependability, a small-but-growing    BitNet extention of our library, ability to maybe link up with the    GM network in SJ Games, ability to get copies of SOME out of print books    that the WarGamers have been given the big legal OKAY to copy (for no    profit), ability to have copies of writers & artist submission guidelines    to many RPG companies and their going rates, and many other things in    the works....

  FUTURE POSSIBILITIES: (most are top secret - these are the de-classified                         plans)
    WARGAMERS SPREADING OUT: In the near future people toating the WarGamer    ID card will be getting discounts not only in Mobile and Pensacola, but    maybe elsewhere.  Areas targeted are Tampa, Houston, Phoenix, and POSS-    IBLY Detroit... If you know of a company who may want to work with us    (we do not impose anything on these companies and do not interfere with    their business, but they may want to get in on some of our deals) have    them write to my address listed below.

    THE UNTITLED: Our magazine will be taking off sometime in October.  We    are looking for paying advertisees and some writers.  People from the    Net with past writings are encouraged to send a sample of their stories    or gaming ideas to the UWFGAMER address on the net, accompanied with an    address (both Net and Real) and your intentions.  At this point the    magazine is planned to be no bigger than Palladium\'s organ: The Magic    of Palladium (approx 16 pages).  We plan for it to cover ALL gaming    aspects of both RP and Strategy (we have an URGENT need for strategist    writers|) gaming.  It will start off of a shoe-string budget and the    editor has not been authorized to offer cash as payment of yet, and IF    we DO pay for written articles/stories the cash will be possibly just    2 cents a word (that\'s about what Challenge offers), but we will NOT    take away your copyrights - it will remain to be YOUR work and not    ours (you let us borrow it for that issue) - not unless you donate the    work will we copyright it under our own group.  And NO we really don\'t    want to call it the UNTITLED, but the other choices have not been    returned on the voting ballot we sent out.
        The choices are: The Phaedrian, Role of the Dice, Your Move...,    Gamer\'s Magazine, Imagi Continuum, RPG\'er, and The New Round.  PLEASE    vote on what you like|||

    AVAILABLITY OF PROOF: I have spoken with some gamers who have never    heard of us (and that\'s okay), and so I have compiled ALL of the    coorespondance that we have held with all of our sponsoring companies    that spans back about 4 years.  Anyone wishing to view this collection    may send SASE ($1.50 postage) and I\'ll photocopy most of the letters as    proof. Also, if you\'d rather, you can call or write the companies that    we claim to be sponsored by and ask about our validity...

    SOON TO BE NON-PROFIT: We have applied under the Federal Gov. to be    recognized as a non-profit organization/club devoted to RP and Strategy    Gaming.  Donations will become tax deductions for both companies and    individuals who are wishing to donate funds and or materials.  We will    let you know when we get our number...

    MOVING: The WarGamers office is moving out of my house (as well myself,    I am also moving out) and into a small business building in the    downtown section of Pensacola - right next to a gaming shop.  I am    moving into an apartment at the other end of the city.  The WarGamer    office address will be available in mid-May - when we move in.



    Well, if this file, the archival tomes library (approx. 100 cols wide),    and our resume don\'t show that we are an agressive and workable group,    I don\'t know what will...  Please remember - we do NOT want to take    over other existing gaming groups or smash them out of existance - we    want to work WITH them as a network of gamers.  I hope the size and    ambitions of this group will not scare potential partners away.  Please    copy this file and SPREAD it... SPREAD it everywhere...  If people are    interested in more info they can write me at my current address:
       Theresa Verity                or the new one: (after Apr 20, 1991)       3330 Fridinger Dr.            130 E. Nine-Mile Rd. Apt 25       Pensacola, FL  32526          P-cola, FL  32514
                                     (904) 484-0578 (call respectable)
       The chapter constitution is being drawn up for the UWF Gamers and    anyone interested in becoming a chapter can have a copy of it.  You    will notice that we are not here to take over any established gaming    groups, we are just wanting to set up a large network of gamers -like    the RPGA BUT with less control over other groups.  Chapters will enjoy    the full extention of the privilages now held by home members...

I\'ve been working over some ideas and I wanted to get some input fromyou fellow traveller nuts. I\'ve been trying to figure out an interestingway of getting the players a starship without just giving it to them. Theydon\'t really have the money to build one (I like to make them struggle at it)but they might have access to a Scout/Courier or Seeker for a limited amountof time. The idea I came up with is basically searching the empty areas inthe sector at least Jump-2 away from a world. I figured that with a seeker,you could completely fill the cargo bay and ord holds with fuel and therewould be enough fuel to make 2 jump-2\'s. I figured the farther away froma system, the better the chance of finding a misjumped starship. Consideringthe area I\'m looking at (the \'Abyss\' - fairly much in the center of theSpinward Marches Sector) there are over ten empty hexes at least a jump-2from the nearest world.

So, have any of you fellow traveller\'s ever played in a similiar scenarioor considered it for your players?
Thanks,
        Bart

Bart Simpson <c447463@UMCVMB.missouri.edu> asks for an idea for an interetingway of getting the players a starship. He suggest an action with a Scout/Seekerwhich uses its full Jump-Capacity.

I have seen this possibility for a Scout/Seeker too, so I have changed thedesign of the Sabine-Subsector in the Deneb-Sector. I established a Dark-Nebula-Zone there which has an average spreading of 2 Parsec. A X-Boat-Route leads around this Nebula. In the Year 1101 a sun is discoverd in adust-free part of the Nebula. This sun is found by a Free-Trader which hashad a misjump. Luckily the navigator of the Freetrader was cute enoughto discover a jump-2-route to one of the next discovered worlds. So theIIS sends a Scout (no other ship available) with L-Hyd-tanks on theshortest way (Jump-4) to the sun.

  I hope the idea of the sun in the dark-nebula-zone will help you tofind an Szenario. Here are some suggestions:

 - The PC find artefacts of an alien civilisation where they discover a   Starmap, in which undiscovered (form the Empire) systems can be found.   Comparision to Empire Starmaps shows, that the undiscovered suns are in   a Nebula-Zone. The PC then create a jump-program to reach this systems.

 - The PC themselves make a misjump to a unknown solar-system in a dark-   nebula. Please remember, the PC don\'t know, how to leave the system,   because they can\'t find out their real Position (no other stars can   be seen).

Everyone who is interested in my full Szenario (including Subsectormap,political structure of the SABINE-subsector and a few ideas about alien-civilizations) is invited to ask for more.

I would like to ask for members of the Traveller-List, who are playingwith the german set of Traveller-rules. Please contact me, per directemail. I\'m especially interested in informations about the germantranslation of the MEGATRAVELLER-Rulebook (there are rumors thatFantasy-Products (the german distributor) will start it this year),the history of the Empire after 1110, and differences between thegerman Rules and the actual MEGATRAVELLER-Rules.

The german rule-set incorporates as far as we know, most of the materialspublished earlier in the Traveller-books and should be consistent withMEGATRAVELLER, because they were published late after TRAVELLER but shortbefore MEGATRAVELLER.

To paraphrase Douglas Adams: "Space is big.  You wouldn\'t believe how mind-bogglingly big space really is."  Your chances of finding a misjumped starshipare effectively 0.  Just for sake of argument, let\'s take a look at a few numbers: Each hex is one parsec across...3.26 light years.  If we jump to thecenter of the hex, a radar pulse would take 3.26 years to travel to the edge and back...and even TL21 active sensors are limited to 500,000km.  Let\'s takean approximation of a hex as a disk 3.26 ly in diameter and 500,000km thick.Our chance of randomly jumping within actice detection range of a derelict isroughly equal to the total area of the disk divided by the area our sensorscover.  The area of the disk is 8E26sq km, and the area that our sensorscover is 7.8E11 sq km...making our chance about 1E-15.  That is to say thatabout one billion lost ships must be contained in the hex before we haveone chance in a million of finding one. 

I\'m limiting this discussion to active sensors because old derelicts willbe stone cold dead, and rather hard to find on passives.  If you think thatradio beacons will help--I\'d guess a typical starship could power life supportand commo for a couple of months minimum after a misjump--then go ahead.  AtJump-2 from the nearest world, the passengers and crew will still be deadfrom power loss even if they all piled into cold sleep berths in the 6+ yearsbefore a radio message would reach the nearest world.  Given that the powerwill only last for months, the odds of intercepting the message by jumpingrandomly into space still aren\'t good...and would only apply for very recentderelicts.

I\'d be inclined to help the players just a little bit more, if the end resultof obtaining a starship was the referee\'s goal. The difficulties inherent infinding a derelict in a star system would be considerably less--whether thevictim of a pirate attack that is repairable, or, say, a single person crewedseeker tethered to a rock next to the body of the crewman who died in a mininglaser accident.  If you insist on deepspace, the Traveller background has generally assumed that it was possible to jump repeatably to some point indeepspace...perhaps you could leak the coordinates of a pirate rendesvous wherecaptured ships are jumped before looting, or a refueling point from the Thirdor Fourth Frontier War that was found by the enemy and raided. (Presumablyfound by ferreting out the coordinates through espionage...you see the diffi-culties that would come from trying to search a space.)

	Ever Hear of Serching for a Needle in a Haystack? 
Let\'s assume that 1000 ships are lost in the hex...If they are evenlydistributed then the average seperation would be 1/10th of a parsec, orabout 3 x 10^12km. I don\'t know how far away sensors would work, asthere would be little local interferance, but the travel times would bedaunting, unless you had the fuel to do a microjump-1.	I\'m not saying that it is impossible to find, but it would bea rare occurance. Then one has to think of what the crew would do if theyfound themselves stranded in the middle of nowhere. First is the "aliens"solution, start the ship moving towards the nearest inhabited system, andhave everyone get into low berths, hopefully you would be revivablewhen you were detected going through the system.	Acutally that\'s the only solution I can think of, I guess somecrews would blow themseleves up, others accelerate until they ran out offuel, perhaps reaching relativistic speeds, maybe some would just sitaround and hope for rescue. Most of these would have an impact on howdifficult it would be to salvage the ship.
	I agree that places jump-2 away would have probably more lostships, as fewer people can recover from a misjump placing them more thanjump-1 from a system. Then again, a lot of people jump their maximumdistance, (case in point, the salvagers coming back won\'t be able todo anything if they misjump), and will be in the same general situation. Also consider that at jump-2 away, those people with J-1 fuel left thatare still stranded (which are the extra ones, not found at J-1), but that extra fuel can be used to power the thrusters for a considerable period of time.

	Lastly, the universe is large, if you\'ve thought of somethingprobably someone else has as well. Therefore if it is profitableto run salvage into empty hexes, someone else is probably doing it aswell, and they may not be pleasant about you cutting in on their "turf".

Archive-Message-Number: 2301Date: Thu, 25 Apr 91 23:09:42 -0700From: George William Herbert <gwh@ocf.Berkeley.EDU>Subject: Empty Space ...


Finding ships in deep space ought not be totally impossible...just veryunlikely.

Over the whole imperium, there are 16 sectors at 1280 parsec-sided hexes eachfor a total of about 20500 hexes.  Given some space around the edges, call it25,000.

Now, next you get to estimate how many starships are operating in thoseregions (to determine loss rates and densities).   The military operates probably more than 20,000 starships; let\'s call it 30,000.  Add in thescouts (10,000 type S alone) for about 45,000 starships in imperial serviceat any one time.  Civillian usage is probably higher, or around 100,000.Assuming military starships last 100 years (mean) and civilian ones 50 years,we can figure out how many have been built over the history of the Imperium.An average of 450 military ships per year, and about 1000 civilian ships peryear are built.  (These are probably accurate to about a factor of 2)

	Next, we do reliability.  I\'d figure that they\'reabout as reliable as modern airliners are, or perhaps one loss per hundred thousand flights.  That translates to 25 per 100,000 per year, or about0.0025 percent.  Making it a conservative case, call it 0.1 percent per year.This would mean that over an average starfaring lifetime of 50 years, a starship has a (roughly) 5% chance of being lost for some reason.  This, combined with the above starship production rate estimates, leads to anaverage loss rate (all causes) of about 50 military and about as many civilianships per year.  100 ships per year, into 25,000 hexes.  Average density after1000 years of Third Imperium: 4 ships per hex.
	
	Now, most of these ships aren\'t lost due to misjump.  Most will be lostto combat, accident, crash on planet, etc.  If airliner statistics areaccurate, something like 75%-90% of all accidents happen at takeoff orlanding.  Presuming most of the rest are misjumps, that leaves us with anaverage density of 1 to 0.5 ships per hex.

	Now, it\'s possible that this is a factor of 2, perhaps even 5 higher.Let\'s work through numbers for both...

Worst case: 0.5 ships per hex	You have to find the ship (ROb Dean gave an idea how hard), and there\'s	only 50% chance one\'s there in that hex anyway.
Best Case: 5 ships per hex	Not too bad, the RMS distance to the closest misjump victim is 	probably less than a lightyear.  With any luck he\'s still got a radio	beacon going or somesuch.
	The worst problem with these assumptions is that a misjumped ship dieswhere it jumps to.  In all likelyhood, the crew buttons up in cold sleep, firesup the drives (if possible), and makes a slow boat to somewhere to the nearestcivilization.  Even if the drives are out, a tight-beam radio message tothe nearest system will get there in 3-10 years, and someone can jump out andget you (at least the crew, likely salvage the whole ship).

In short: 
	There aren\'t that many misjumped missing ships.  It\'s hard to find	them.  And you have to assume they\'re dumb. 8-)

Well, I got almost caught up.  Took me all week.

Thanks for the compliment, Colin.  One of ya\'s safe, anyway! :-)So.. here\'s the damage413kBytes to pore over before I add my own stuff.  
***THAT\'S 200 PAGES!!! ***
Should take me a few days.  You can rest easier, however,knowing that i AM working on it.


One more thing...  If anyone happens to have a copy of the confidentialJJ Horne Character file, from two years ago, contact me and/or Greg Givler ASAP.

Not to worry too much about that 413kByte file.  I just finishedstripping mail header info and it\'s down to 160k or so.  Whew!

I am back in the fray, more or less.  I\'m still a little short oncomputer time during the week, but have wangled a domestic agreementfor a little more weekend time.  :-)  I\'ll try to keep up withincoming requests for GM info, but primarily I\'m dedicated to gettingturn 10.9 ready.  Expect two parts; James wants me to keep individualpostings to less than 45k so internet mailers won\'t choke, and thesize won\'t flag his sysadmin\'s bosses.

While everyone is poring over their mailers, be sure to check yoursub-lists and see that enough of the appropriate people are receivingcopies of your conversations.  Remember, with 40 people aboard, theAlcyon is kind of a small ship, and your conversations have a fairlyhigh likelihood of being overheard.

Suggestion: Put two or three people at random onto the CC: list of each of yourmailings - then you won\'t know exactly which information your characteris going to become privy to, it\'s importance, or which characters areprivy to your semi-private information.  When you become privy tointeresting information, then you can choose whether you wish to sharethis info, and with whom.  

One other caveat - be sure to put the snoops and busybodies on yourrandom cc file more often - after all gossips get that way \'cause they work at overhearing more.  Yes, the people you don\'t want toknow what you say are the ones most likely to overhear it.  Tough
SH**!  :-)
Actually, this information overlap is going to become important(yes, this is a slipped-in hint!) so DO IT NOW!

(Quotes here belong to Alan Husscroft)I am brodcasing this in the hopes of some real discussion of this.

:Hmm, I\'ve just been reading that discussion with Mark Cook about how:much PBEM mail should be kept private and how much should be widely:broadcast.  Not having had the chance to interact with any other:characters yet, I don\'t know how big a problem this is going to be:for me when the main party hits R-alpha.  But it did make me realise:that life might become more difficult for me later on.

Me, too.  Sending lots of mail to lots of people lots of time every day gets outrageous.

 
:I\'m not sure that it\'s going to be practical for me to broadcast:messages to the whole PBEM list (or a large subset thereof), for:two reasons:: :1.  It\'s going to take up a large amount of transatlantic bandwidth.:    It strikes me as being very wasteful sending dozens of identical:    messages across the ocean, and I\'m concerned that the powers-that-:    be might take a dim view of it.

I agree with your concerns, just in general.  I believe in conservationof whatever resources we have.   Especially in this case since the mailof a lot of the players is paid for by their employers.


:2.  The bugs in my mailing system mean that if I send mail to a lot:    of people all at once, some of it will probably bounce.  It:    depends on whether people\'s usernames need to be explicitly given:    in lower case, since I can only do 2 such names successfully in:    any one posting.  The rest get automatically translated into:    upper case.  You and Carl are already taking up those two slots,:    so anyone else who needs to be addressed in lower case is out:    of luck.

My experience is that some of it will *certainly* bounce.  Thisrapidly multiplies headaches for the originator and bandwidth, too.
As for R-alpha posting, I can handle that.


:All this led me to thinking:  Do you know anyone with the facilities:to set up the PBEM as its own mailing list?  ie. so that I would only:have to post a message to one address and it would automatically be:distributed to all PBEMers.  I imagine that quite a few people would:find this useful.  There would be an added advantage that you don\'t have:to worry about individual players keeping their mailing lists up to date.: :What do you think?  Would a PBEM mailing list be possible, or even:desirable?

I can think of a couple, but won\'t mention names.  Right now I think it\'s NOT desirable.  We get a lot of good TML traffic out of the PBEM and vice-versa.  It would become a supremeheadache for whomever is doing it (unless they like that sort of work)and whoever does it will have to work intimately with me about someof the PBEM secrets.

We might discuss changing rules around so there are two or three maindistribution points (these already exist, for the most part), I thinkthe big problem would be having people limit the number of messagesthey send, \'cause of the overhead for the official forwader.  

I started out the PBEM trying a double-blind gambit with me doingall the echoes between characters.  Almost instantaneously I was geting80 - 160 messages a day.   Typically, 40 or so needed to go to three orfour other people, and 10 or so needed to go to everyone.  I gave up inabout two weeks.

As for the trans-Atlantic bandwidth problem - I\'m open for discussion.Your particular problem, I\'ll take up with Carl and John and see whatwe can do on this side of the pond.

BTW - thanks for forwarding my stuff to Arthur - I *still* can\'treliably get to Ireland.  Go figure.

:Alan

 Hello again, out there in the Ether...
Neophypte again, still trying to grasp the concept.
Latest advice says I should try to track down the following:
Classic Traveller Adventures 1, 2, and 3Double Adventures 1 and 2THE TRAVELLER ADVENTURE trade-paperback


So the question which follows naturally -- does anyone have these andwould they be willing to sell?
 
Alternatively, I was following the earlier discussion re:photocopyingand copyright.  If I followed correctly, the result was, if it\'s outtaprint, copy if/when you can -- but don\'t dare re-sell!
 
With this in mind, would anyone care to Copy but not resell?  If thisis not up your alley, how about a loan?
 
If anyone is interested, you can respond here, or if you\'d rather notclutter the Ether, e-mail me at the mailbox noted below.
 
Thanks in advance, and please keep in mind, the sooner I figger outthis stuff, the quicker I will quit being a pest and perhaps havesomething intelligent to add to the general conversation, certainly animporvement!

  I have finally obtained the bloody Traveller and started designing vehicles.Since the largest ship seen by me so far is the Atlantis battleship (of R. S.Dean\'s fame) I have decided to try my hand at a ship exactly twice as large(and of the same TL).
  There is little doubt that this creature will be rather heavy and costlike hell and (what\'s more) guzzle fuel like a Russian farmer during May day.  Since the ship is large and cannot make refueling runs, how the Navy feeds
them?

                   Prince Rupert Grav Heavy Tank TL12
 
 
  Prince Rupert grav tank was commissioned by the planetary govenment ofBendor (Glisten/Spinward Marches). Initial design and production wasawarded to BedArCo, a local manufacturer. The commander and driver sitinside the hull of the tank - all the weapons are in a self containedturret atop the tank. The laser and the fusion gun are located onopposite sides of the turret with the rest of the weapons arrangedbetwee the two.
 
  The extensive computer system installed allows the commander to doubleas gunner.
 
  The tank seemed to be a success, except for the exorbitant price, butin excercises the tank proved to be very vulnarable if attacked frombelow, the hull - too large (even after installing an extensive sensorsuite and a full 30 day fuel tank) and the choice of an airframe hasstill not been explained.
 
  The production run has stopped after 57 vehicles and a redesignrequest submitted.

                   Prince Rupert Mk IIa Grav Tank TL12
  Prince Rupert grav tank was commissioned by the planetary govenment ofBendor (Glisten/Spinward Marches). Initial design and production wasawarded to BedArCo, a local manufacturer. The production of Mk I washalted after 57 units and a redesign request submitted. The Mk II is thechild of that redesign.   The design team decided to decrease both the size and armour of thetank, but to retain the heavy weapon suite. The sensor suite has beenupgraded and the communication suite modified.   The commander and driver sit inside the hull of the tank - all theweapons are in a self contained turret atop the tank. The heavy laserand the fusion gun are now located in two separate turrets - the lasertopside and the fusion gun below, each with a coaxial 5.5mm Gatling gun.   The extensive computer system installed allows the commander toreplace the gunner.   The 600 ton Low Power H-Grav unit of the Mk I was replaced with astandard grav of 450 ton thrust, but the marked drop in vehicle weightresulted in increased speed. The power plant was upgraded because ofthis switch and now supplies 132MW (of which only 129.5 are used).   The new model of the Prince Rupert has been purchased in significantquantities and used in a number of engagements.

Thank you for all the great ideas for derilect (sp?) ship searching. Myoriginal idea was working around using the passive sensors, especiallythe densitometer. I expected that there would be some \'junk\' in space, but(I think) there was generally empty space between systems (can any of youastronomer types help here?) I figured with a sensor radius of 2 light-years(for the passive sensors) - something might be worked out.

My biggest question is can anyone tell me how these things \'work\'? Do theysense the \'dimples\' in space that masses have? I know they rate them atHigh and Low penetration and then xxx kilometers, but beyond that I knowvery little. Can they be effectively used in searching for derilicts?

*******************************************************************
Howdy Folks!
 
Perhaps some of you thought I\'d dropped off the face of the Earth,but like a bad penny I show up with a disk full of designs for youramusement. Just in case you\'re wondering I\'m headed for grad schoolin Physics this fall and with luck I\'ll get a computer account totalk with ya\'ll in a more conventional form.
 
Are there any TML people at the following Universities?      University of Alabama:  Tuscaloosa?      Alburn University?      Univerisity of Texas:  Arlington?      Texas Tech University?
The unluckyest of the above may be hosting little old me and I wantto play some TRAV! (unemployment is BORING!) If there is anyone outthere at the above please send me a card! I\'d like to find out moreabout the above.
 
Scott Kellogg      (703)-739-0831 or (908)-841-470737 Robin RdRumson, NJ 07760
 
As I have in the past, I have found a little brain teaser for thedesign experts of TML...
 
Design problem #117[a]:  NUCLEAR FISSION REACTOR FUEL CONSUMPTION

I did a little computation from a book I have on contemporary navalvessels using the stated range of several ships and their reactorpower output to calculate the total fuel consumed (as given byMegaTrav rules).
 
These estimates are based that the reactor ran at full powerconstantly over the range and speed traveled. This is a BADassumption, but it should give us an order of magnitude. The USSNautilus had three reactor cores in it\'s life. The first shouldhave consumed 136.7% of the total weight of the ship, The secondcore should have consumed 201.0% of the ship. The third core shouldhave consumed 327.8% of the total weight of the ship.
Ok, lets assume that on average the ship ran on 1/3 power she stillends up consuming 109.3% of the ship!
 
The Nimitz with a range of 1 million nautical miles (50,000hrs)burns up 157.4% of itself if you assume full power, 52.5% if youassume 1/3 power.
 
The Enterprise (20,000hrs) burns up 67.9% of itself at full power,or 22.6% at 1/3.
 
The Kirov (6000 hrs) burns up 45.9% at full power or 15.3% at 1/3. 
The following assume a 6 month (4,320hr) fuel supply at full power
Class           full power   1/3 pwr   1/4 pwrLe Redoutable         107%       36%       27%Resolution            108%       36%       27%Lafayette             110%       37%       28%Trafalgar             169%       56%       42%Rubis                 112%       37%       28%Delta                 161%       54%       40%Typhoon               173%       58%       43%Sturgeon              191%       64%       47%Valiant               193%       64%       48%Ohio                  194%       65%       49%Swiftsure             193%       64%       48%Charlie               203%       67%       51%Permit/Thresher       216%       72%       54%Yankee                236%       79%       59%Skipjack              264%       88%       66%Los Angeles           267%       89%       67%Oscar                 295%       98%       74%Echo                  312%      104%       78%Victor                318%      106%       80%Sierra                360%      120%       90%Virginia              570%      190%      143%Alfa                  876%      292%      219%     
!!!!!!!??????????
 
Even if the ship only runs at 10% on the reactor you still consume10.7% of the ship in the least case scenario!
 
Suffice to say, I think the stated fuel consumption for fissionreactors is, to say the least, excessive. What happens?  do theydismantle the hull of the ship and eventually parts of the reactoritself, shoving them into the reactor. The crew stands around on ashrinking iceberg and dutifully throw themselves into the reactorwhen all else is consumed in the reactor?  Regrettably they canonly use 100% of the ship that way. I wonder how the Alfa\'s crewmanages?
 
I have no magic answers to the above problem, but in the designs iinclude I have divided the fuel consumption by 8760 so that 1hour=1 year. Not a very good assumption but it will have to do.
 
Keep in mind, that reducing the fuel consumption of fission plantsby even a small amount makes radioactives have a higher energydensity than the hydrogen fuel of fusion reactors!  If you changefission fuel consumption, you\'re gonna have to change fusion fuelconsumption too!
 
I am afraid that being unemployed has not especially affected mytendency to come up with Trav designs. There will follow a group ofdesigns for your amusement. Hope it doesn\'t clog the air waves. 
Take care,Scott Kellogg

There were a table in "Grand Survey" about the maximumranges of densitometers against various size targets in empty space. It\'s mucheasier to find an object if it floats free in space than if it close to some bigmass like a planet.  I don\'t remember the exact range, but I\'d wager that it was somewhere in therange of 1 AU or slightly more for a ship in less then 20000 ton.
  The biggest question when talking about the PCs  using a densitometer for searching for derelicts is "Do they have one?". Densitometers are military and scout equippment, and unless they have a type S (or perhaps a seeker)they are unlikely to have one.

> I expected that there would be some \'junk\' in space, but> (I think) there was generally empty space between systems (can any of you> astronomer types help here?)

  I\'m not an astronomer, but not knowing what I talk about has never stopped 
me before :)

  What can be found in deepspace? Well, anything that don\'t advertise it\'spresence or is valuable enough to drag a lot of people there. If it did, itwould be on the charts.   Among the things that are right out according to this are large astronomicphenomena like black holes, novas, anything more massive than a small gas giant(the GS table gives the max range a sgg can be detected as up to one parsec),mysteriously undiscovered pop 9+ worlds (Yes, I know about Ruie) and similarthings.

  As for what *is* there is the occational navy fuel/supply dump at strategiclocations (and perhaps a Zhodany ditto occationaly, just waiting for the PCsto stumble upon as they scourge the sector for derelicts:), very rarely aplanet and lots and lots of cometary nucleii.  According to some theories(*), the orgin of comets are in a area at about100AU distance (the Oort cloud)  from the central star of system. Some models suggest that, in addition to the ones that fall inwards and become \'real\'comets, there are also a slow leakage towards interstellar space.   The number of nucleii that have leaked from every system for the historyof the galaxy adds up to a very large number and I did some calculations onthe chance a ship a very high sublight speed and a densitometer had of locatingone (but they are at home, and probably lost in an avalance of old paper, butthe chance was not astronomically small.)


  In my campaign, the players have cashed in on the "needle in the haystack"angle and have used random locations in deepspace as a convenient places to mothball starships. The specific example was a vargr trader (the same as on mydeckplans) that were placed in deepspace somewhere around Deneb 0330 mannedonly by a gunbot in the turret and a hold full of occupied low-bearths (various enemies of the PC\'s. I remember that there\'s supposed to be the SolSek\'rezident\' on Vincennes/Deneb and two officers from the Illelish Navy:)

  The fun really started when the PCs came looking for their ship and didn\'t find it. After some bitching about if they were in the right location and scared thoughts about what\'d happen if someone had found the ship and releasedeveryone there they begun to search the area and found a 200km cometarynucleus winding it\'s way from the scene of the crime.  The nucleus had simply collided with the ship and carried it along. The responder beacon was silent because the gunbot had burned all fuel when ittried to fight off the comet:)

> Bart

(*) November, two years ago, I asked an astronomer here at Chalmers about the    latest status of the Oort cloud theory and got the reply: "Unproven, but    largly accepted because it fits in with some popular theories about the     orgin of the solar system."    After that, however, I heard ("Objection! Hearsay!") on sci.space that     the evidence of Oort could was looking less likely every day.    When it comes to traveller, I refer to exhibit 1,   "MT Aliens 1: Vilani&Vargr", more specifically the Vargr section as proof   that Oort clouds exist in the traveller universe:)

Remarks: Another design from the CAD of Dr. Hloch. The Tribal classDD is primarily an escort for heavier ships. The multitude of pulselaser batteries provides a good anti-missile screen for the vesselescorted. This of course makes her a comaratively lightly armedvessel, but The missile bay is capable of dealing heavy blows toany attacker.
To provide her shield of covering fire, the Tribal must fly incomparatively close formation. It was decided that though shipcaptains don\'t like flying in visual range, it actually is onlynerve racking, not dangerous having such large ships flying onlykilometers apart. Because of the close manuvering needed, theengines were designed oversize. They are capable for short busts ofextremely high speed, but long periods of such manuvers putsexcessive strain on the hull and drives.
Meson defensive shielding was thought unnecessary as the vesselescorted is considered to draw the enemy fire and a meson screencan only cover the vessel so equipped. Nuclear dampers are toogreatly handicapped to provide good defensive shielding for morethan one vessel. However at intercepting large numbers of missilesalvoes the Tribal has proved quite effective.
The Tribals first saw action in the fifth frontier war. Deployedwith the Imperial 214th fleet in the Glisten subsector, a frontdevoid of action. The 214th moved spinward to attack the rimwardborder of the Sword Worlds. At first they did not see much actionas escorts and were often pressed into the more traditionaldestroyer role in which, in spite of their light armament, theyexcelled.  On 085-1109 the fleet struck taking Steel, Mithril,Bronze and Iron.  The operation lasted 60 days. The first fleet battle where the Tribals were used in theirdesigned role as anti missile escort for battleships was in theaction off Sting which saw the Sacnoth fleet destroyed with lightImperial casualties. At the onset of the battle, it was then that Admiral N. Chesterunder heavy missile bombardment from Sword World ships called forhis escorts.  The destroyer squadrons were 3 hours away guardingthe fleets tankers.  The reply from the squadron leader the thenCommander Charles Alburne aboard the Cossack has become legend: "Under way at 6.5G!"
Admiral Chester\'s reply was addressed to \'6.5G Alburne\' and Admiral6.5G Alburne has been known as that ever since.
A squadron of Tribals on loan to the Darrian Confederation also sawaction in the liberation of Entrope.  Five Tribals took on two"Overlord" class carriers.  Three Tribals drew the fighers offwhile two went in and took on the carriers.  Without their fightercover the extremely large but lightly armed Overlords were shotapart with missile salvoes but not before one of the Overlordsdestroyed the Entrope Starport with its fusion rockets.  Withoutthe carriers to operate from, the fighters were soon destroyed orran out of ordenance. Partial list of ships in class:  Cossack, Zulu, Matabele, Iroquois,Nubian, Afridi, Gurkha, Mohawk, Ashanti, Bedouin, Eskimo, Mashona,Punjabi, Sikh, Somali, Tartar, Arunta, Kurnai, Athabaskan, Cayuga,Micmac, Nootka, Saxon, Norman, Kurd, Sunni, Slovak, Czech, Mongol,Zhodani, Vilani, Solomani, and Loeskalth.

Assuming the Atlantis class has the most powerful weapon available, what isgained by increasing the size?  Greater jump number, perhaps.  But for thesame amount of money, I\'d buy more, smaller ships and get more spinalmount weapons for the same cost.  Perhaps the rules ought to be modified toallow two meson guns to be mounted side by side, jointly forming the keel.Or how about a catamaran-type design, with two keels?

Being a nuclear engineer and working at a power plant, I suppose I shouldreally look into the fission reactor design rules.  One thing to note is that the fuel consumption for a civilian power reactor is completelydifferent from that of a naval reactor.

Having worked on both, I can tell you that the actual reactor designsare very different and the naval reactor is much more efficient with respectto power density.  I\'m not sure which data was used to determine thetables in the MT rules but the numbers should be very different dependingon which data you choose to use.  Though they should not be in the percentagerange that Scott identifies. So, I\'ll try to spend some time and look at thetables trying to make some sense of them.

Refuelling using shuttles is possible for medium sized ships. The Atlantis isequipped with scoops and purifier, and on second thought maybe the 2,000,000displacement ships should be equipped with such, too.
Robert Dean remarks that the T size meson gun is deadly to any ship, 1,000,000and 2,000,000 alike. The idea of a catamaran type ship is interesting - let\'ssee - Death Star type sphere type ship? Anyone up to the challenge?

It also seems that Robert\'s Atlantis only uses 5550 hardpoints out of the 10,000 available. When designing the 2,000,000 disp ship I have more or lessthe same problem. The design I have uses up some 9800 hardpoints.

That leaves some 50% of the hardpoints are unused. Should the rest be leftempty or allocated to sand?

A question/quibble on the issue of skills (IS the TDR still active?) - skilllevels are arranged in a rather peculiar way. For all matters Pilot-1 isequivalent to Handgun-1. That is, of course, quite unrealistic. I am a pistoluser/carrier and basic level of use of a pistol is quite simple. Of course,higher skill levels require quite a lot of training, but the basic competencyis not that hard to attain.

Worse, the Linguistics skill is tottaly unrealistic. Each level of linguisticsgives an additional foreign language. Is, then, my "real life" linguisticslevel is 4 (I am a linguitics student)? Of course, this is not true, but skillsystem should be somehow arranged to reflect skill complexity.

Remarks: Possibly the most unusual starship built in recent years.The "Overlord" class was designed as a platform from whichatmsopheric and orbital fixed wing aircraft can operate. Thespecification went out in 1097 for such a platform but all SwordWorlds major shipyards had contract commitments at the time. Thecontract was won by Rekiaben AG shortly before the Great GravFailure of 1098 when all of Rekiaben\'s grav modules were recalledas faulty. Needing to fulfill the Overlord contract but nottrusting their grav modules, Rekiaben opted for a jump capablehelistat. Thrusters were not available due to the grav crisis, sofusion rockets were utilized.
 
To witness the "Overlord" in flight is a truly awe inspiring sight(basically it looks like a cross between a Nimitz class carrier andJules Verne\'s Albatross)
 
The "Overlord" class saw action in the invasion of the Entropicworlds of the Darrian Confederation, and on Praetoria a humanImperial allied world in the Vargr Extents.
 
The rotors pose problems unique to this class of ship. In oceandipping, the fuel tanks can only be partially filled per dip. Ifthe fuel tanks were filled with water, the ship could not lift, butwith hydrogen the ship performs fine. The rotors provide 110% ofthe lift needed to fly the ship allowing it to fly with 10% of therotors out of action or under repairs. One slightly unusual featurein the design is the orientation of the fusion rocket engines. Theyare aligned along the keel of the ship to provide a stable hoveringplatform so the rotors can be brought into operation.
 
Transition from fusion rockets to rotors is tricky in that the shipnearly needs hover in the atmosphere in order to slow to a velocitywhere the rotors will unfold and function properly. Transitioningback to fusion rocket propulsion is the reverse:  the rockets kickin as the rotors gradually fold and stow themselves.
 
The most dangerous heavy weapon carried by the "Overlord" are herfusion engines. More than 150 thousand tons of thrust is expelledby the exhaust vents of the rockets which can be gymbaled aroundand trained as weapons. The starport of Entrope was so destroyed atthe end of the Fifth Frontier War in a scorched ground operation bythe retreating Sword Worlds Occupation Army.

Remarks: The Indianapolis is a high speed interceptor meant mainlyas a long range exoatmospheric operations where it can run ringsaround grav and thruster equipped fighters. Without a HUD, or flyby wire controls, it is not as capable a dogfighter as theValhalla, but with its tremendous speed, it can dictate the place,the altitude, the range and the time he shall combat. A pilot whocan do so has all the advantages.

Turn 10.9 comes in 5 parts.  Part 1 is this admin note.  Part 2 covers days 3 & 4 of the jump.  Part 3 covers day 5.  Part 4 coversday 6.  Part 5 covers the re-emergence into normal space.

Iain Fogg is temporarily, but completely, out of commision.  We aredragging along his character (whose name I do not remember just now)until that fine day he gets to return to the fray.

Peter Bergholm is out for ~ two weeks, as is Nick Sylvain.Mark Cook, after next week, will be out for two weeks.

Purdue is shutting down for the summer this week.Berkeley is shutting down in ~ two weeks.
All players from there are to soon have e-mail problems.
- - ----
Contrary to my instructions, many of you have written short explanationsof WHY we should continue to play, or should shut down for the summer.A lot of good reasons, a lot of good responses.  It turned out some of us already have real lives to deal with, too...

And so the answer is ----
                         A Partial Shutdown
              PBEM - convalescing, niether dormant nor hibernating

We will have one more SHORT! turn period and posting, then PBEM will goon short rations.  I will use the time to catch up on admin work, fix mailers, get new players introduced, and (possibly) work out a PBEM alias-echo system that has been proposed.

I feel especially bad about shutting down R-alpha just as it appears, sothose of you who want to continue to be "in character" and become a native,take care of little things, play semi-out-of-time, or whatever can continueto do so.  

This means that we have a wonderful opportunity to build useful old-turnarchives, set up people\'s mailers and so forth.  Anyone who needs to shut down can do so.  I will still be available (for the most part) to handle things, but play will be a little different, if at all.


About this next short! turn period.  I *WILL* finish and post the turnon the weekend of May 18 (between Mother\'s Day and U.S. Memorial Day).This means I must have stuff to go in the turn received by May 16 or so,so you have ONE (1) week to say something.   If it doesn\'t work out --Oh well.  We\'ll probably have torepeat all this information next fall.

My deepest apologies to all for this deuced inconvenience.

Turn 10.9 Admin

In keeping with our very liberal, batch-oriented, philosphy,I have once again placed words into the mouths of various characters,hopefully not making them say anything their owners would want toshoot me for.  Also, in keeping with tradition, here are my favoriteoff-line quotes for the last three weeks:

 .  We can role play this, or just say it happened ... Ok Richard?

 .  So what DID cause the fuel-line to break? - We\'re all dying to know.
                                                          ^^^^^
 .  At this point, Xxxxx spontaneously combusts.  Only his boots and a     small scorch mark on the deck are left.
          "Oops, there goes another one."
- - ----
We awakened a doctor last turn.  His description engendered a few questions.The most frequently-asked question has to do with Yorblin\'s hair style.>From the belter\'s mouth:  "A belter cut, for all intents is a mohawk, except that it continues   down the back in a ponytail.  As one could guess from the name it is   popular amongst belters (per Larry Niven\'s world)."

- - ----
A major concern at the tail of this posting period was time slew.  You know,the thing that happens when the thyroid-case posters meet the lethargicGM.  :=)  Most of you will quickly notice that we have a truly severecase of time-dilation between R-alpha and Alcyon.  In the 3 days or so thisturn covers, the Aslan are down, refuelled, and have explored some,unless they are as slow as I am.

We finally all get together this time, so this should end.  (I hope)


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

           ******** PBEM Last Time *******


Last turn, the Alcyon was in jumpspace somewhere on the rim of the imperium.  There was minor speculation as to whether the fleet you just ran from belonged to Lucan or Margaret or Dulinor or the Solomani. Bishop was high as a kite (the bird kind, not the paper kind).  \'Voufannounced his paws were working again.  Silvmane recovered from deepfreeze really fast.  And, in general, things were cooling off.

The Aslan ship Trakh (I can never spell kitty words) arrived at anunknown sector and discovered a ringworld with inhabitants.  It startedchasing a small shuttlecraft toward the inner surface of the ring.
and now, without further interruption:

                  ***** Day 3 *****


- - ---- Alcyon, in jump ----

Charyn is up early, around 0430, just like every day, waiting forthe others to arrive for the Alcyon marathon.  Just like every othermorning, she is the first to arrive.  Thule and Ian arrive shortly.<Charyn>"Say, is anyone else turning out for morning calesthenics?"Charyn is habitually there, ahead of the posted time.  <Thule>"I think we\'re it this morning."Thul for his part has added to his morning routine a little.  He isnow wearing his field boots and a pack.  If anybody cares to lookin the pack, it is filled with concrete blocks for weight.  He hasalso taken to wearing a belt with filled ammo pouches."Well, let\'s go."
Charyn works very hard at it, but is apparently not a real physical person.  She appears fairly detached and remote, but astute readers of personality may note she has a look of frustration and determination. Thul, noticing Charyn\'s frustration, says:" Don\'t push yourself TOO hard there... work at your own pace.Start small and work up.  If you\'d like I\'ll chart a workoutschedule for you.   Don\'t need any of our team members hurtingthemselves without good reason..."<Ian>Hey Thule, this might sound strange, but shouldn\'t we find something we can spin, and also induce gravity on?  So we can experience thefull glory of coriolis while we\'re working?  Or is the ring big enoughto preculde that? <Thule>Ya\' know?!?   I didn\'t even think of that... I\'ll have to go findone of the egg-heads and ask them!  
<Charyn>Hey! Look at that...Sometime, during the night watch, A poem mysteriously appearsposted in the lounge, and on bulkheads here and there...            The Brave Ship Alcyon          ----        A brave ship she - the Alcyon       Intrepid venture-wise.       One night - dark night - she spaceward rose       And still goes on to rise.        A brave ship she - the Alcyon       Away from life she flies       But on her board her crew and kin       In droves falls and dies.        A brave ship she - the Alcyon       One man from space returned       And when almost inside he was       His fortunes were upturned.        A brave ship she - the Alcyon       Some fuel did escape       And two tried lives - both good and true       Endured a vile rape.        A brave ship she - the Alcyon       A crewman died of drugs       Another has a thieving bit       And there\'s a lack of rugs!        A brave ship she - the Alcyon       She\'s more than we afford       The bishop is not saintly -       Is drunker than the Lord.        A brave ship she - the Alcyon       The pilot\'s eating frogs       And need we speak of poor exec -       Who\'s life gone to the dogs!        A brave ship she - the Alcyon       She flies intrepid on!       But ere her will is made and done       We\'d better man the con!                           Flt. Sgt. Suom Ynona <Ian>You know, guys.  I don\'t really like running.  But\'cha gotta do someting(pant) to keep your wind up. . . I\'d give a lot for swimming pool.After a day or so in jump, Zben resumes his normal activities,spending just a little more time in the gym working with his blades.Durning that period if anyone asks for some instruction or help withblade use, he gladly gives up some of his time. The only noticiblechange is slightly darker circles under the eyes, and a slightlyshorter temper. Once and a while he can be seen heading toward theweapons training area, carrying a long thin case, more appropriate fora pool cue than a rifle.On duty, Zben tears into the inter-ship network, trying to getthe speed up and the security foolproof. He also does a quick checkout of as many auxillary vessels as he has time for. One other thinghe devises is a `souped-up\' bug detector. Designed to cause andmeasure a reaction in ANY device having transmitting coils, the unitis quite a bit larger than the standard bug detector, but can scan amuch larger area (about 9 square meters). The only problem with it iswhile in use it will detect any legitimate radio as well, so he tendsto leave his communicator in the engineering shop (after sweeping it).At some point during the third day, everybody\'s commdots comes to life.<...> Attention all hands, this is Doctor Van Der Merwe, Chief Medical      officer. Both Commander Ger and myself have reminded you all, but      apparently some of you didn\'t hear or ignored us. So listen up now,      everybody. A significant number of you have failed to show up for      medical exams as requested. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. You *must* be      examined and given any necessary vaccinations or boosters for the      protection of yourself and the mission!      Those of you who haven\'t shown up yet, you better make plans to      do it soon or I *will* have Security hunt you out and drag you to      Sickbay kicking and screaming. If you need any more incentive, I will      not permit any individual NOT showing up from participating in any      away team on R-Alpha until they DO show up. Yes Mister Bishop, that      includes you too!      I hope to see you in Sickbay soon. Have a nice day, all!" <...>- - ---- Air lock 4----At the Airlock:"Holy sheeit," Ralf says quietly.  "Look at this."  He\'s got the air lockcontrol panel removed from the bulkhead.  It looks like the victim of ablow torch with an attitude.  "This .. whatever bypassed all the normalinterlocks.  That iris valve only did what it was told -- to close.Unconditionally."I sure wouldn\'t trust ANY doors on this ship until we check \'em over.""Alright lets shut this baby down", J.J. taps his comdot, "Security, Hornehere, we need a crime lab team down here at the airlock ASAP. I doubt if we canfind anything but we may as well check." With that he takes a handkerchief fromhis pocket and takes the airlock control panel from Ralf. He says to theothers, "Nobody gets near this airlock until we run a check. I think it\'s timewe start checking backgrounds and see who has the electronic skill to dosomething like this. Azani, Mahlel, either of you know how to lift prints?If you do check this doorway with a fine-tooth comb, if not, don\'t let anyonetouch anything. Ralf you come with me, I need a full report on what was doneto this thing."
Not even looking to see if Ralf is following he turns and starts to head forsecurity, as he goes he starts to mutter. "Damn J.J. your slipping, you shouldhave thought of this earlier, sabotage. But no, you go right on cleaning upblood and destroying evidence. Stupid, stupid, stupid, You have to startthinking with your head not your heart, you remember what happened onBright Face..." With that J.J.\'s voice trails off as he realizes that hehas been talking out loud, he glances at Ralf sheepishly and falls intopensive walking. Suddenly J.J.\'s comdot comes to life:
<...>Mr. Horne, please come to my office.  I need a report on the airlock incident.Farouk over.<...>J.J. heads for Farouk\'s office to speak with Farouk."Ralf you might as well tag along, I will need you to explain the electronicsstuff to Lazer anyway"- - ---- Security ----When J.J. and Ralf get to Farouk\'s, J.J. gives his report."According to Ralf here, someone tampered with the airlock control panel, itdefinitely looks like we have a saboteur on board. I would respectfullyrecommend that we pull all the dossiers on board of crew members that haveelectronics knowledge and go from there. Of course it is easy enough to getfake papers, I know I have done it enough. Also I told Azani and Mahlel totry to lift some prints, I will try on this thing here, I doubt if we willfind anything but we might get lucky. Also Ralf recommends and I agree thatwe should check all the portals, uh doors... uh... hatches whatever you callthe things on this ship. Also I have to report that I was slow to cordon offthe crime seen, I was thinking about the accident instead of my job, I didn\'tthink that it could possibly be sabotage until Ralf had pulled the controlpanel. I am sorry about that, if you want to take disiplinary action againstme I understand. I guess you will want to here the technical side of this,Ralf"With that J.J listens and tries to comprehend Ralf\'s report.After Ralf is finished with his report J.J. speaks, "If you have nothingfurther for me, I would like to check the airlock control panel for latent\'sand then get back to the airlock and check there. Also I will needfingerprints for everyone on board for comparison. Also, I will be glad tohead the investigation for the saboteur.As jj turns to go, he says over his shoulder, "I could use your prints rightnow, if that is OK, Ralf."With that, J.J. pulls out a cheroot lights it and settles down to the nutsand bolts of the investigation.<Lazer>That will do for now.  Continue your investigations and let me know whatyou find.  Dismissed.A few hours later the intercom comes on again:<Lazer>I need a report on whatever that was that set off the radiation warningsin the armoury yesterday.  Please come in person.Farouk over.<...><Doc> Just in case you think I\'m kidding, I\'m having Lazer Farouk see if any      of his team is getting a little twitchy from not having seen any combat      recently. That lucky person will accompany me on any \'search\' missions      for those truly reluctant patients. Have a nice day! <...>
<Lazer>
He just might put his stethoscope in the refrigerator, too... :-) 
- - ---- Sciences
Dr. Morser is seen only sporadically during the day. He spends severalhours moving crates back and forth between the cargo bay and his room. Fromwithin can be heard the sounds of tinkering, moving, sporadic curses ingerman, and the occasional crash or small explosion. There is a vivid "Do Not Disturb" sign taped to the outside of the door, which remains locked at all times.Thul tracks down Morser to his hideaway, sees the "Do Not Disturb"sign and snorts to himself.  With the flat of his palm he smacksthe door and bellows:  "HEY DOC!  Got a question for ya!"He is met at the doorway by a very strung-out scientist; Morser is even more unkempt than usual, and he has obviously not slept in some time. He is quite apologetic about not allowing anyone in due to "rrrezearch", but he is also quite adamant, somewhat brusque, and extremely animated(read:wired on caff-tabs). He gives the general impression of someone who wants desperately to tell a secret, but isn\'t quite ready yet...<Thule>On this ring we are going to visit, are we gonna experience anycor- corio--  cor-- what the hell , however you pronounce that wordfor the effect you get from being on a spinning object or is it toobig for that?  <Morser>The scientist looks away bfiefly, then back to Thule.  "Oh. zorry, youcaught me thingking about zomething... Let\'s zee.  mm
No.  No coriolis, unless you want to run *really* fast from one spillwal tozee other.  The ring iz MUCH too big to notice it.  It vill be interesting,though.  Ja?"
He then abruptly excuses himself and closes his door.



- - ---- SecurityEdmondsen reports to Farouk. "Radiation warnings?  Seems to have beensome kind of practical joke that went off at the wrong time.  It was abox of grenades that Ralph checked in."Box was covered with visual radioactivity warnings and handling warnings.  It had internal tell-tales rigged to set off audible alarmsif the box got seriously disturbed or tampered with.  During the commotion it got bumped and the alarms went off."No radiation.  No problems.  Just a strange sense of humor."- - ---- Medical<Merwe>"As I indicated, Anton is the worst case. I\'m not sure we can do anythingabout his coma, but if he comes out we would have to consider regeneratingor replacing his foot. Obviously I have a bionic replacement covered, andyou have regeneration. So you could keep an eye on him.<Yorblin>"Yes, I was wondering about him, your therapy seems a bit conservative, butconsidering how busy it\'s been I could see why you wouldn\'t want to start anything intensive.  I\'d like to continue him on the steroid therpy youhave him on.  Let\'s start some packaged acetycholine, though, to kick in thereticular formation in the mid-pons and then start some scDNA nanocytes tostart damage control.  I think we could hold off at that and see if it doesthe trick.  When he pops up, he should be ready for his new foot"<Merwe>Daniel Silvmane, needs extensive help with rehabilitation after that LH2accident. If you can handle these two, I have a prior investigation that Ihave to attend to. I think that\'s about it; questions?"

<Yorblin>
"Silvmane will do okay, we\'ll see a lot of tissue sloughing in the next 48hours, but that is primarily superficial.  With broadspecs he should bedisease free.  He\'ll probably need ECMO and some modified HGF-alpha toprevent any respiratory sequalae.  Maybe some elastin factor beta, we\'ll see.

"I think that\'s about all there is with those two, barring continuedvasculature problems with Devious.  I\'m going to grab some chow, and thenhead right back down.

"Good to see the medical ops are being handled by another scout,
a sure guarantee of competence, eh!"


A minute or two later, the door buzzer beeps, and Charyn announces her arrival; "Doctor Merwe, this is Mister Robins.  I\'m reporting for my physical as scheduled."

"Come in."

                  ***** Day 4 *****
                           R-alpha
Hooper is in his G-sled when he gets the call from control. Currently he\'swatching a group of Kythui. One big Kyth has a group of smaller Kythbeating up another Kyth while pointing at the sky.

"Aha," thinks Hooper. "I wonder if Ferdy\'s Visitors are on their way back."He guns the Gs and turns the sled for the control centre.

This assignment has got to be some sort of punishment for whatKatie did.  But what she can\'t figure out is how anyone foundout about it.  Well, it doesn\'t matter now.  She\'s stuck fora week playing babysitter for a dozen youngsters way out inthe middle of nowhere.  She was sure she was going to get aspace assignment, what with all the rumors of increasing thenumber of space patrols.  At least Phil is along to help,even if he is rather dull to be around.]"So Phil, have you done this sort of thing before?  No?  Well,there\'s not much to it really."  I wonder what he did wrong toget himself this job."The young\'uns tend to find enough to keep themselves occupied.All you have to do is make sure they don\'t wander off and driftthrough a teleport portal or something.  You can try joiningtheir games but I\'ve found they\'re usually too small and quickfor us adults."  Hmm, some of these youngsters have alreadyoutgrown me!

- - ---- Aslan Ship Trakh ----
Akhouw looks into the holotank and the possibilities for success andglory are reflected in his intent eyes. Turning back to his controls, hepunches up the thruster plates to maximum and continues pursuit of thelow-energy ballistic craft with unerring accuracy. He\'s clearly feelingthe adrenaline thrill of the chase and anticipation of victory. "Aeawiyh,keep an eye on those engines, we need to run flat out. Keep meadvised."
Turning to his companion on the bridge, his face is the picture of purposefuldelight. "Aiwi, record all scan data on the ringworld and keep a closetrack on that new craft, I want to know as much as I can about it. Second,warm up the comm gear and see if you can raise them on the radio or thetight-beam laser or maser gear. You know, the standard contact message,and tie in the computer language translation gear, who knows what theyspeak, whoever *they* are."

- - ---- Maintenance Station #1 ----
Ferdy flicks the communicator panel into life.
"Doejin, what have you got out there?  Any indication of who -- or what --is in that thing?  Do they look as though they\'re going to land?"
<Doejin>"I\'m returning to base, as requested.

Looks like they intend to land, Ferdy.  I\'m gonna give a litte boost toget away from \'em and then get back to refuel and stand by to see what gives next.   My curiosity is highly aroused, but I\'m only back if I have the upper hand in maneuverability and/or weaponry (and I _know_ I don\'t meet the last criteria!)

"From there, I will ensure a rapid refueling  and get ready to go back out and investigate some more.  At the very least I will be in theappropriate control rooms to try and determine who these other visitors are.

- - ---- Somewhere on R-alpha ----
Some hours later Katie spots a shuttle [Doejin\'s] slowly arcingacross in the darkening sky.  After a few moments she realizesit\'s in an unpowered ballistic path (learned that while I washanging out with those space-faring Phins).  And behind it isanother shuttle.  Wait!  It can\'t be a shuttle.  It\'s trailinga tail of light.  And they\'re both headed towards the base.Something big is going on and I just have to be there.  "HeyPhil, I left something backatthebase which I absolutelyhavetodoor I\'ll get stuckonanotherbabysittingjob and justdieofboredom.What?  You *like* this job so far?  Great!  Then canyoutakecare-ofthingsforawhile, atleastuntilIgetbackIpromiseitwon\'tbetoolong.Thanks!"
And before Phil can ask what\'s the rush, Katie teleports out.

- - ----Tapping the intraship comm, Akhouw says "Eihoftyah, I want you and Uhwaikh in the pinnace and ready to launch for high guard duty while we refuel from the ocean."- - ----Out of the corner of his eye, Ferdy notices a small phin darting about inthe distance.  He groans inwardly.  "Oh, not Katie!  I thought I\'d heardthe last of her.  I should have known she\'d manage to get in on the actionwhen the Visitors turned up.  That little maniac will wind up in bigtrouble one of these days..." It suddenly occurs to Ferdy that the communicator is still on.  Doejinmust be wondering what in all the Great Hoop he is mumbling about.  Heflicks off the comm and pauses for a few moments, conducting an innerstruggle with himself.  Finally, against his better judgement, he setsoff after Katie.  "Someone\'s got to keep that blasted youngster alive",he mutters.  He wonders why he feels so responsible for her.  Maybe itis because it was Ferdy who told her that story from way back in hischildhood about a visitor from the stars.  It could be partly his faultthat she has gone so crazy about anything to do with space travel. He is about to call out to her, but thinks better of it.  Knowing whatKatie is like, she would probably just dash off and try to lose him.  AtFerdy\'s age he has no chance of keeping up with her, so he elects tofollow stealthily at a distance.  Until she needs him.- - ----The Trakh continues pursuit, following the shuttle until it suddenlyand inexplicably surges far ahead of the Trakh and disappears behind alow hill near the shore of one of the major seas."Admiral, uh, we have no procedures for even *trying* to maintain positionabove you at a velocity near that of the ring.  Commands, sir?""Launch.  Stay airborne; keep your sensors active; watch for whatever ison or under the surface, in the air, and as far over the ring as you canscan."
And the Trakh touches down on a bright blue, warm water ocean.  The sun directly overhead casting very stark, short, shadows about the outersurfaces of the slowly rocking starship.  A cool breeze blows slowlyfrom the sea toward the shore, carrying the cries of distand sea birdswith it.  A few tens of meters inland, coniferous and deciduous-lookingtrees form copses rustling in the breeze.
"Initiate fuelling.  Maintain full sensor scan, both ships."
"Trakh, pinnace.  Looks like that ship went into the ocean about1 km offshore.  Went deep.  Disappeared from our scan."
========================================================================
                  Alcyon, closer to R-alpha
- - ---- Mess Deck ----
As crew members filter through the ship\'s mess for breakfast, a few of them notice that Adrian Bishop has commandeered a table in the corner for himself.

His meal largely untouched, except for the ever-present coffee mug,and the grey miasma left by countless Nicotine Sticks, he has surroundedhimself with the tools of his trade.  Spread out in front of him is aReston Industries _Combined_Lexical_Audio-Image_Relational_Editor_.Connected to it by a thick optical bus is an Info-Dyne Data Storage Rackwith about 2 dozen 7.6 tera-byte holo-dynamic memory pods plugged intothe top.  Bishop wears a display headset and makes frequent notes witha stylus on a datapad laying next to the R.I. CLAIRE.  He is obviouslyengrossed in his work and, for the most part, oblivious to the rest ofthe mess.
    
"Tag current as segment end.  Move segment to prefix segment 1437.Freeze frame." Bishop frowns at the screen and those nearby may be able see \'Vouf, sitting in the lounge, obliquely facing the viewer.  "Zoom3124 to 4411.  No... his hands are still visible.  Zoom 4411 to 4512.Stop.  Shift UP 4512 to 4655.  OK, good.  Now set current drift andresume playback."  Bishop smiles at his handiwork and makes anothernote on the datapad.
    
Occasionally, Bishop glances up at the current occupants of themess, but never really establishes eye contact.  The only time hisattention clearly shifts from the CLAIRE is when the recently thawedcrew-member, Jan Yorblin, comes in for breakfast and then leaves.Briefly, his appearance occupies Bishop\'s full attention.  Withoutactually staring, Bishop watches the tall, albino belter during hisentire stay in the mess.
Yorblin is scarfing the last of a raspberry (he thinks) danish when DanSilvmane walks into the mess.  Jan gets up to intercept him at the mealdispenser.
"Pleased to finally be able to introduce myself, I am Dr. Jan Yorblin,"he says extending his hand, "I have been delegated to take you throughyour recovery period by Dr. van der Merwe."
Noting that his hand is neither the mushy skin of thawed frostbite northe firm slickness of grafted tissue, his eyebrows raise as he confirmshis initial impression of a man healing himself too rapidly to be justhumaniti.

"Not to say I am surprised to see you up and about, but you are lookingbetter than I expected.  Why don\'t we talk about it over breakfast.  Inthe sick bay, or here which ever you\'d feel more comfortable with.  However,I\'d like to get you back down on the ward, because of some concerns I haveabout your lung tissue.  Are you having any shortness of breath?"
"Uh, no.  Why?"
"Good, good, shall we head down to the bay now?  I\'m concerned thatwith your reduced immune status that you might pick up some bug hereoutside the sterilizer fields.  Among the many effects of LH2 burnsis cellular disruption, and that allows some for very easy infection,and it\'s come to my attention that a number of our compadres haven\'thad their check-ups yet, so we don\'t know what may be floating around."
After Yorblin leaves, Bishop slouches back in his chair and dropshis stylus on the datapad.  "So that\'s the newly defrosted member ofmedical staff."  Comments Bishop.  Then he smirks.  "That is the *WORST*case of freezer burn I have *ever* seen!"



- - ---- Engineering ----
<Redd>Hi Slide.....I\'ve got this program for leadfoot, to catch that  treerat  & keep  himout  of  engineering.  I can\'t implement it until it\'s been tested, andI\'ll need some help for that  - It\'s probably going to look quitestrange, dragging a bag wrapped in synthetic fur around the ducting,etc, so the robot can chase it - I thought of sealing engineering off  toun -authorised personnel (Especially that *!#? reporter!). What it really needs is some kind of small remote-controlled robot to simulate Bit, but we can leave that \'till we find out if the robot tears the \'dummy\' to bits in catching it - no point in wasting expensive hardware when we don\'t have to.If  you  feel like helping in this eccentric venture, drop me a line, andI\'ll get the go-ahead from whoever\'s running engineering this week.... <...> 
Attention all hands. Until further notice, the Alcyon cargo bay isunder medical quarantine and sealed to the general crew. Please contact meif you have any questions. Van Der Merwe out. <...>Johann has been sitting for a long time by the holographic display that hasbeen showing strange patterns for a long time when he suddenly jumps up andtakes off through the door out of engineering."Ger, Vouf, I\'ve found something on the R-alpha data. I\'m comming up."- - ---- Medical ----"Ugh, agh, yugh. I dislike sleeping in a low berth.", As Goughzar looksabout."Thank you doctor, do you have anything with stimulant? Perhaps you cantell me where I can get something to eat. I always feel weak aftersleeping in those.Christian grins and assists Zar to a sitting position on the bunk. "Sure,give me a second." He reaches over to the autodispenser and draws a cup ofsteaming black coffee. "Here you go, hope you like coffee."Zar stretches a bit and wakes up a bit more, "Who do I report to? Iassume we have arrived at the ringworld and my services are needed.Christian\'s face shows his concern, reflecting the seriousness of thesituation. "I\'m Doctor Sir Christian Van Der Merwe, Chief Medical Officerand leader of the Bio/Med team, so (grin) I guess you\'ve reported in.But no, we are not at the ringworld yet, and yes, your services areneeded. Subcommander Bhyarrvouf is going to brief you; I can show youthe way if you like."No sooner are these words out of the good Doctor\'s mouth than there isa ferocious pounding on the door to Sickbay, and a scream of anger thatcould ONLY come from a very, VERY angry Vargr!"VAN DER MERWE, YOU MALPRACTICING SKUZZBUTT! \'FUN\'S DONE,\' YOU SAID! \'TRUCE\', YOU SAID! KAE, KAKH TSAKHA! OPEN THIS DOOR!"The door to Sickbay slams open, and there is a Vargr, buck naked butwrapped in a bathrobe, standing on the threshold. He is bright yellowwith shocking pink markings from head to foot, and he\'s boiling mad.
"I would like a word with you, DOCTOR," He snarls, advancing on van derMerwe. "And that word is--"He hauls open his robe. There on his yellow chest, in pink print, is the word

			GOTCHA


The Vargr allows approximately a half second for van der Merwe\'s reaction,then breaks into howls of laughter. "HEEYARF HARF HARF! \'Truce\', you said!You never noticed that *I* never said it, though! Hrf hrf hrf-- paybacks, mymuddy TAIL! Paint MY arms pink and yellow, will you? Hrf, hrf--GRK!" 

Goughzar hears a fuzzy voice through the slowly receding fog in his mind.His eyes are closed, but there is something reassuring in the tone andchoice of words, something that vaguely says, "Home."

\'Vouf draws up short, aghast, as he sees Goughzar for the first time. His blueeyes widen in shock as his good humor instantly evaporates and his ears foldback flat. "Kae! Ah, um...." He pulls his robe quickly shut. His voice deepensabout an octave. "Mr. Goughzar, I presume. Hrmph! Ahem. Well, urm, welcomeaboard. I am, hrrr, Subcommander....Roukh," he looks sidelong at the doctor,"And I will be expecting you in my office in one half hour for your debriefing. Doctor, see to it that he reads the memos on his assignment whilehe\'s in Recovery." And he beats a hasty retreat, shutting the door behind him.Zar watches in amazement as Subcommander Bhyarrvouf leaves quickly, stillpainted. All the while sipping the coffee and watching the commotion."Doctor, please explain. This Vargr seems familiar to me, but I can\'t placehim. And I am supposed to report to him? What exactly does he want me to do?Repaint him? I have little skill in artistry..."Zar waits while Christian explains the communications system, fits him withthe appropriate gear and shows him how to review the past memos."I see, thank you Doctor. I assume if you need me you will contact me. Iwould gladly accept the offer to show my the way to ... uh ... SubcommanderBhyarrvouf\'s briefing room.Zar gathers what gear might be had here and muses to no one in particular,"I wonder when they will tell me where quarters are, of course I could justsleep on the deck, hoping nobody will wander through with yellow paint..."- - ---- Ship\'s Lounge-cum-Wardroom ----"Wait till you see this." Johann drops down at the navigation display andcalls up a hologram showing a ring-shaped object.  "This is from the probe data of R-alpha . I\'ll change it to show low frequency radio."  "Computer, display EMrad in the 1 to 100 Hz band, execute."The display doesn\'t change noticably.  "As you can see, nothing. Anything that might have been there is too faint for the probe to detect against the background clutter. But there is traces of EMrad lost in there, and all I had to do was run a sixth generation Kowalski pattern matching algorithm on it. Fortunately the computer was fast enough. The last time I did this the run took two weeks. It\'d be nice to have it performed in realtime but even the shuttles computers are too slow for that. I\'ll magnify a part of the inner surface."  "Computer, display area 156 degrees spinward, full magnification, enhancement option \'D\', execute."  The ring grows until it is too large for the display and continues to grow, the seemingly thread thin ring begins to take the shape of a flat strip, and it\'s curvature appears to approach the flat as the display zooms in on a part of the R-alpha.  Faint ice blue lines looking like equidistance marks appear on the black surface. They seem to form a pattern where the links are made of two or four parallell lines between nodes of one or two rings.  Johann put the marker on a line.  "Computer, evaluate." After a long second the answer appear in text in the display: \'High-tension line, Alternating Current 31.83099 Hz.\'  
"Now, what do you give me for *that*." Johann says with a wide grin."Huh." \'Vouf looks at the gridwork carefully. "High tension lines. Anda pretty good-sized network of them, too. Well, we can draw all SORTSof worthwhile conclusions from THAT little fact!" He scratches hismuzzle thoughtfully. "Life. Not just life, but sentient, technical,advanced enough to require widespread power grids, and probably stillthriving."<Limner>\'Vouf is, of course, correct.  This brings up many interesting questions.If the ringworld is still thriving, then why haven\'t we made contact withthe inhabitants earlier?  Could it be that the creators do not possessjump drive capability?  I think this is unlikely.It is also possible that the grid may be operating independently, and theringworld may be deserted.  <Abuko>"Either that or they haven\'t gotten around on to spaceflight yet. Severalthousands of years between electricity and the first steps into space is notunheard of.   But I\'d put my money on that the ring is deserted. Remember the biomecaniclanthanum mine dating back to who knows when in Reft. It was completely automated.  All service done by robots.  Gengineered rock worms extracting the lanthanum from the ground.    Anyone with the tecnological wherewithal to build R-alpha could make something like that work. And automatic service of a powergrid would be a piece of cake!"

<Limner>More likely, the current inhabitants are either not the same as the ring\'screators, or for some reason are no longer as technologically capable.  Ofcourse, it could also be a race so alien from us that we don\'t understandtheir motives.  I could tell you about a race on Marcos 5 that...but I\'dbetter not right now.

In any event, the mere fact that power grids are operating could mean thatthis mission may turn out to be more diplomatic than exploratory.  Is ourContact Team prepared?

<Jett>I can\'t speak for the rest of the Social Science/Contact team, but I don\'tfeel this would present a problem.  My skills and knowledge are primarily in interspecies communication and diplomacy, so if we do run across beings that are sufficiently advanced, I see no difficulty in our "establishing diplomatic relations" of a sort and negotiating from there. Legally speaking, it may work in favor of any claim we may have, although I\'m pessimistic over the prospects for adherence to the rule of law by any of Lucan or Dulinor\'s people...<Sokuku>I agree with Judge Jett, I foresee no problems.  As myexperiences lie in covert survey operations, I would propose that ourfirst course of action would be to examine the natives (if any) from adistance and determine their physical form.  If we can impersonatethem suitably (up to the medical team to decide, I suppose), we shouldland a covert survey team to feel out the population.  Then we canfollow up with a "real" landing and contact.  Of course, if the covertteam determines that the natives are horribly xenophobic, we may haveto think of something else.  Or, if we can\'t suitably "blend in" withthe population, we\'ll have to come up with some more ideas.
<Jett>If I may interject here, I agree entirely with Mister Sokuku, but we dohave to consider one important possibility. We know that it is highlyprobable that we will find technologically advanced beings, so we have tobe ready and prepared for the possibility of their contacting us!We certainly can\'t hide the Alcyon very well, so if they have advanced sensortechnology, they may see us as soon as we exit jump or not long thereafter,and decide to check us out, in person (if they have that technology) or viacommunications.<Mac>"Well, if they contact us. So much the better. That would certainlymake things easier. Just tell them we come in peace, and go from there."Mac smiles as usual.

We know now the power grid is operating. But that\'s not much to go on,
And chances are we probably won\'t have enough info till the contact teamlands. I think we should focus our effort on the murderer, having someonelike that running lose on the ship is not my idea of a good time.
About this time, that interminable intercom comes to life.

<Doc> Attention all hands. I now have two volunteers, Thule Jonson andJordan Kalhoun Azani, who will accompany me should it be necessary tohunt down bashful patients. This is a last warning to all of you who haveby oversight or intent avoided the required medical exams.I *do* hope you will voluntarily show up for your exam and inoculations. Itis essential for the success of this mission and I don\'t enjoy hunting downpeople. But if you insist... (chuckle) <...>
<Horne>
Doc, Horne here, did not mean to avoid you just thought that I had had a physical. Sorry memory is fuzzy from the first week of the trip. AnywayI will drop by sickbay right now, I have been meaning to talk to you aboutsomething anyway. Just with the emergencies and uh... stuff going on I have been a little busy.

<Doc> Not a problem, JJ. I\'ll be in my office most of the day, and am quite     willing to discuss any concerns you may have. It shouldn\'t take long,     assuming you are in good health. <..>
Nice to have people come by "voluntarily." :-)

<Redd>
"My apologies doctor, but it\'s been busy in engineering.  We\'ll  organisea  rota  for the engineers to take their medicals immediately. I\'m afraidyou\'ll have to find Aaron Haut Freider yourself though - He  hasn\'t  beenin touch with engineering recently.

"Johann,  will alphabetical order be OK for the medicals? If anyone\'s toobusy, speak now, or they\'re likely to come fetch you, and I  don\'t  thinkyou\'d enjoy that!""We\'ll  have  someone with you right away doctor, even if we have to drawstraws....."<Doc> Thanks for your prompt reply. I don\'t think any of us wants to get hungup or laid low by a nasty disease.. Who knows what R-Alpha may throw at us.I\'ll be in the Alcyon infirmary, just stop on by.. <...>
<Abuko>
  "Alphabetical is good, I\'ll be down in medical right away." 
Johann turns to Vouf and Ger. "If you would excuse me, I have an appointmentin the torture chamber."

                  ***** Day 6 *****
- - ----
Midnight, Alcyon
Doctor Limner\'s voice comes over your Comm-dot, althoughhis voice sounds slightly crackly:
I\'m sending this message directly to your comm-dot,overriding the normal methods.  Please be aware thatthe computer currently is directing our comm-dotcommunication.  I will attempt to provide a backupsystem, in case you are about to do what I thinkyou are about to do.

<Limner>  "PALADIN, please give me a density, magnetic, and neural scan of the  40m sphere surrounding Bharrvouf.  Feed the data in real time to the  unit LIMNER HC1."

"Allright, Zar.  I\'ll feed you the data through my hand comp.  Weshould get a three-dimensional view of what\'s happening.""I\'m using my own equipment to do some other scans."<Ian> "Hoo boy.  What a *sweet* setup.  Juss a sec."  Ian issues a coupleof hushed commands.  "There.  I\'ve got data reduction working on it,you have control of movement, view point, and spectrum.  Right nowwe\'ve got full EM passive, 0.1 nm to 1mm.  We should be able to catchanything from black-body to high energy neutrinos.  Whatcha want?"<Limner>"We want all power use accounted for.  I\'m scanning for all energy transmissions within all four of the ships.  If there is a renegade computer, it will have to use power, and we\'re going to find it."
Then, almost under his breath .. "I almost hope it turns out tobe the Alcyon\'s computer.  There are some pretty advanced computers on the other ships as well.  Some could run circles around the Alcyon\'scomputer, I bet."As Zar views the sensor output through his hand communicator, he accessesthe paladin\'s computer through the voice link."PALADIN, expand sensor Neural, Magnetic, and Denisitometer readings toinclude all of the engineering sections aboard the Alcyon. Pinpoint andIdentify all known neural id\'s and enhance any unknown id\'s. Mark and runreal time through unit LIMNER HC1 and copy into file MIDNIGHT FIREFIGHTaboard the Paladin."
"Dr. Limner, just thought I\'d put in my own few sensor skills to help thePaladin along. 



- - ---- Outside Engineering ----
Moving low and fast, Andon heads for the rear hatchway to Engineering, and hits the manual lock.
LAZER!!
Who get\'s through our cordon?  I can hear someone coming and if I don\'t getresponse fast I\'m going to have to either gas the corridor or shoot someone.

<Lazer>
"DON\'T SHOOT THE CREW! Just stop them, talk to them, get in their way, tacklethem if you have to. Do you have your stunner? I just don\'t want extra targetsdown here."

The door to the Drive Room opens, and Bhyarrvouf strides in. He\'s in his usual uniform, but the collar is all the way up to his chin, leavingonly his head exposed. His data monocular is down over one eye, and thoseusing IR-sensitive gear will note an IR tracking laser beam emitted froma point just next to the eyeball. His gauntlets are back on, for the first time in a couple of days, and he\'s wearing his Gauss pistols at his hips,slung low for a fast draw. As he walks in, he reaches down and rests hishands on his guns. Behind him, Thul Jonson and Abdul Schmud step into theroom, and begin looking about them. Both are armored and carrying heavyrifles. Behind them in the hallway a form in combat armor is faintly visible.

Zben is in the corner of Engineering reserved for electronic repair. Something in `Voufs voice makes his hair stand on end, and without thinking he grabs the closest thing to a weapon he has on hand, a small laser welder, and eases toward (but Not into) the main drives room...

Kimball Redd looks up from where he was working, and frowns at the  smallarmy  of  heavily  armed troops waving lethal artillery at the most vitaland delicate parts  of  the  ship.  After  a  moment,  he  realizes  he\'sstanding  unarmed  and  unarmoured in what has just become a war zone anddives for cover behind the nearest solid object. 

"Mind  where  you\'re  pointing  those  things!"  he shouts, then sees theAGNIS unit hover into the room. "SH*T. Sh*t, sh*t, SH*T ! - Who  let  HIMin?"  After this brief outburst, he looks around, weighing the chances ofreaching better cover unperforated against the damage the robots metal  -twisting  grip  could  do,  and  wonders  whether  it\'s worth telling thebridge that engineering may be  off  line  shortly,  so  they  could  runthings from there. 

"When  we finish this," Redd thinks, "I\'m going to have a talk with Mister Bhyarrvouf about subtlety, the danger of large guns in small  spaces, the problems of ships which have just blown up their engines and killed half of their engineers in a firefight light-years from  help, and wouldn\'t it have been better to have shot the robot OUTSIDE!"
 
Right now though, anyone listening carefully might hear him muttering   something about"goddamntriggerhappyhalfwittedboneheadedmuttwhatinthehell\'shethinkhe\'sdoing" 

Just as Dan is closing the ceiling panel, he sees this small army enter.Jumping off the grav stool Dan rushes to the vacc rack to grab his suit.Normally this would be an old habit for him from the number of drills that the IISS puts a scout through.  But after being bathed in LH2 he finds himself still a little jumpy.  He finds himself rushing through the suit prep and calms himself down.  "Take it easy Dan, lighting may strike twice,but only if your standing in the same place."  Slapping the helmet seal into place he checks the others to see if they need help.  

\'Vouf\'s voice is brittle with tension. "Afternoon, gentlemen!" He looks around the room quickly, until he spots Leadfoot, hard at work on the ceiling ducts.

Redd sees impending disaster and breaks for the rear doorway, right behind the suit rack next to Silvmane.  "Dan! Let\'s get the H*LL out of here!"Redd slams into the door at full speed, having expected it to open auto-matically for him.  Dan drops down next to Redd, and starts tearing down suits to cover them with.  "Once is enough, thank you."

- - ----Paladin ----
<Ian>
"Power surge in Leadfoot!"  
"Low energy surges to engineering computers, main nav comp and AGNIS."

<Limner>
Bridge, Limner.  Start an immediate diagnostic sweep on all ship\'s systems.Something just got loaded, We don\'t know what, yet.

- - ---- Bridge ----
As Limner warns the bridge, Etienne\'s alarms start to sound atmost of the consoles.

<Ger>
Isolate all computer systems.  Manual re-boot NOW on all non-critical systems.

Stand by to... 

- - ---- Engineering --
"Hey, uh, LEADFOOT!" \'Vouf calls. His hands pull the guns partway out of theirholsters. "Top-priority voice override. Cease all operations immediately. Landand shut yourself down for maintainance inspection." The guns are drawn in a blur, aimed directly at the robot. "NOW!"

Upon hearing this Thul drops to a one knee position and takes aimat the "head" of the robot.  
	DONT EVEN THINK IT SILICON BREATH!!!

Leadfoot grabs the power cables already in his hands and clips them cleanly,causing the lights in engineering to go off.  Simultaneoulsy the robot starts to swing the laser torch around, launches itself horizontally toward the jump drives themselves, and scatters its tool kit in the general direction of \'Vouf\'s head.

Suddenly, the relative peace aboard the Alcyon is rudely shattered with asound that should send a chill of fear down the spine of every seasonedspacer, a warning tocsin seldom heard but always dreaded.

The DECOMPRESSION WARNING klaxon begins to insistently wail.
Hearing the decompression warning, Azani puches furiously at hiswrist comp and pressurizes his suit. He then braces himself and triesto hold onto anything that would keep him from getting sucked away.

While he is typing on his wrist comp, he flickers a bit and then becomes"invisible" once again.

- - ---- Aurora ----
Jan quickly accesses the ship\'s computer to ensure that the ship is powering up and that its environmental systems have disconnected from the Alcyon.  "Hull is intact, good, atmosphere- O2 is good, CO2 is good, Nitrogen is good, air processing functioning at 23% of capacity, good.  Power flux is good, well, we\'re reasonably ready to go."
"Goughzar, Dr. Tabor, this is Yorblin the Aurora\'s enviromental systemis operating independent of the Alcyon, so entry will be through theair lock that we have decon set up on until this thing is over with.""van der Merwe, this is Yorblin, fill us in on any changes when you geta chance."


- - ---- Bridge ----
<Ger>
Still speaking to the bridge crew..

"[Stand by to] manually seal the bridge."

<Decompression alarm sounds>
Ger signs slightly, and says with a note of resignation,"And get yer gloves on."  Ger then reaches over, unlimber his soft helmet, and dons his gloves.

Nishu is clearly experienced with a suit, but the snugness of this modelcompared with the looser-fitting lower-tech suits he\'s used to gets himtangled up once or twice.  When this happens he forces himself to remaincalm and take it a little slower, waiting and dreading the telltale popin his ears that will signal a drop in pressure.

... decompression what the hell we\'re in jump for God\'s sake not supposedto be any ..."  Eventually he gets the vacc suit buttoned up, connectsthe oxygen supply, and fastens on the helmet.  As soon as this task iscompleted, he triggers his comdot on the Transport channel.
"Etienne, What\'s going on?"

<Etienne>
Check all systems that can be monitored from the bridge.Especially, find out WHERE the air leak is!

<Ger> (common channel)
"STATUS REPORT"


- - ---- Engineering ----
\'Vouf howls and cuts loose. A rattling shriek of supersonicsfills the Engine Room as a burst of Gauss needles slams into theflying tools, Leadfoot\'s delicate grav units and the tentacle that is the laser welder. 

As soon as \'Vouf casts his lot, a bright flash and the crack of thunderfill engineering as Thule\'s laser rifle lances into what seems to bethe head of Leadfoot. 

A sharp whistle gives away the invisible beam of Leadfoot\'s laserwelder heating the metal of the bulkhead behind \'Vouf and suddenlyimpacting on AGNIS overhead.  Visibility the darkened room getseven worse as AGNIS automatic thermal controls kick in, sprayingliquid carbon dioxide on it\'s surface.

In the hall, J.J.  pushes Adrian down, and says, as forcefully as possible.

"If you want to loose your head, just go ahead and lift it." with thathe moves toward the doorway to Engineering, keeping an eye on the hall.Ready to lend assistance in Engineering if needed. Also he holsters the.45 and pull his SMG and chambers a round.

Suddenly, everyone\'s polarizer\'s stop down fully, and it seems to those near engineering that all noise stops.  Throughout Alcyon and the otherships, there is the deep groan of the ship\'s hull loudly reverberatingin every compartment.  A flash, blindingly bright, even in the well-lit hallway, stops everyone in the hall.  

Horne is lifted bodily by a wall of air coming out of the engineering doorway and thrown against the opposite wall.  Lazer\'s rifle is ripped from his grasp and caroms off Christian on it\'s way toward the Aurora.  Christian is knocked down, winded, from the force of the rifle and the blast.  For once, Adrian is *glad* he\'s horizontal as he feels the heat scorching his face and radiating from the walls.

Throughout the ship, radiation alarms sound, accompanied by the ominouspulsating red emergency lights.  Most of the ship can hear the faint clicksof the ventilation ducts closing.
- - ---- Paladin ----
<Ian, Limner, and Zar>
Oh my God!

<Limner>
Bridge, Paladin.  Hydrogen fusion by-products in engineering.  Multiple weapons discharges.  No real status just yet.


- - ---- Engineering ----
Anton hops around the corner and through the doorway, leapfrogging the dormant (:=) "door mat?") bodies.  Inside engineering, Dan and Redd are pinioned between the twisted suit rack and the back door.  Zben is stunned and looking forlornly at the burned-through cable that previously connected his laser-welder to its power outlet in the overhead.  Thule and Abdul are getting to their knees, near the forward bulkead.  \'Vouf\'shead is smoking, and he is crawling over the top of the number two power routing console, which is inverted and afire.  

The number two Gravitics console is ...  missing.  Scorch marks are everywhere, small electrical fires are starting in the number 1 and number 4 hydrogen maintenance consoles.  Small leaks of steam and .. something come from about a dozen and a half places all around Engineering.  A trailof steam leads from nead the door, where AGNIS was to the far right cornerof the compartment, where AGNIS was flung.  Looking to the left, Anton seesLeadfoot has been catapulted headfirst into the jump drive governors, and is beginning to right itself by pushing against the grid output cables.

\'Vouf, noticing Leadfoot, starts screaming again, takes three steps, and lunges onto the robot.  Shouts, steam from the robot, flying and writhingtentacles, and smoke from the vargr\'s fur mark the advancing locationof their struggle as Lazer and Zben dash to the back of engineering andstart to right the suit rack.

Leadfoot, intent on some kind of cybernetic seppuku, charges a Thule patiently waiting with sights centered on the struggling pair.  Anotherhowl comes from \'Vouf as he is bodily peeled off Leadfoot by a 6-G closeflyby of the numer 3 gravitics console.  Clinging tightly to Leadfoot\'sgravitic\'s plate, \'Vouf slams headlong into the console and bounces into the secondary bridge controls, leaving his gauntlets firmly attachedto the underside of the now-heavily listing robot.

A single, well-placed, laser bolt cleanly separates Leadfoot\'s powercable from his nervous system and the robot crashes into the floor,emiting a screech capable of raising the hairs on an eggshell, recordedforever on AGNIS\'s holo of the whole affair.





======================================================================
R-alpha
Ayrlathi pulls the string that rings the little bell on Old Tehidazi\'sfront door.  Quite a plain door really, he muses, and quite a modesthouse.  He always felt that such an important member of the communityought to live somewhere a little more grandiose, or at least betterdecorated.
 
He stands patiently at the door, waiting for the bell to be answered.It seems to be taking a long time.  Poor Tehidazi, thinks Ayrlathi, theyears are weighing heavily on her; she can only walk very slowly now.There is the clunk of a latch, and the door creaks slowly open to revealthe withered old jijid.
 
"Ayrlathi," croaks an ancient voice.  "Come in.  It is a long time sinceyou last paid me a visit."  She takes a step backward, and with a broadsweep of her arm invites him through the doorway.  "What can I do foryou?"
 
"Cai Sizadre, Tehidazi," Ayrlathi greets her and steps inside.  "I havecome, as so many do, seeking your wisdom."
 
"You had better come inside and tell me about it," says Tehidazi, closingthe door behind him.  Slowly and painfully she hobbles across the halland into her consulting room.  Ayrlathi follows.
 
"There was... an incident... a few nights ago," Ayrlathi beginshesitantly.  "It has been playing on my mind ever since."  He claspshis hands to his chest apprehensively.  His tendrils droop, with onlyone or two of them giving an occasional twitch.  "You will probablythink I am foolish.  It seems such a trivial matter to speak of."
 
Tehidazi\'s central pair of eyes narrow and regard Ayrlathi carefully."This is not like you at all, Ayrlathi.  You usually take everything inyour stride.  I have never seen you looking so troubled.  Won\'t you tellOld Tehidazi about it?"
 
He tells her of the moving light he saw in the sky as he looked out fromthe arzeth danunduln.  "I cannot explain why seeing this light has affectedme so," he explains apologetically, and makes a little circular motionwith his hand.  "Am I losing my powers of reason?  I should not be ramblinglike this."
 
"Do not be so hard on yourself," says Tehidazi.  "I have known you sinceyou were a hatchling, Ayrlathi Edivair Ikisillolen.  You have a talent fortempering reason with intuition.  It is a talent which has served you well.I have seen it used to great effect in your best work.  You should notturn your back on it when it cries out to you so strongly."
 
Ayrlathi\'s tendrils raise themselves a little and begin to writhe inpuzzlement.  "You speak in riddles, Tehidazi."
 
"Riddles?  Not really.  My advice to you, Ayrlathi, is this: have patienceand your destiny will seek you out.  Follow your eyes -- they have always ledyou towards the imaginative and the innovative -- and do not let yourself beheld back by uncertainties."
 
Ayrlathi ponders the meaining of the aged jijid\'s words.  Tehidazi could beobtuse at times, but her observations were never less than astute.  "I mustthink carefully about what you have said," he replies.  Already he is feelinga little happier for having discussed the matter.
 
Tehidazi reaches into one of the numerous pockets in her apron.  She bringsout a small packet and hands it to Ayrlathi.  "These herbs will help you torelax."  She lays a hand gently on his arm.  "Go now, and be at peace withyourself."
 
Ayrlathi thanks her and departs.

A fatigued Jan Yorblin wipes his brow, finishes noting his 5thcase of radiation exposure, and calls "next!"  
No response.  He looks around and sees no more crew waiting fortheir turn.  "Lucan - who\'s left?"
"Schmud was the last," Lucan replies.  
"Oh yeah - one guy smart enough to wear protection," Jan thinks as hedials up a cup of broth.  He calls the Paladin.  "How many leftover there?"
Doc Limner replies.  "We just finished a few minutes ago.  You done?"

"Just a second."  Jan looks into the Aurora\'s sick bay - three beds and one chair full.  He asks Christian how he feels, and gets a tired nod.

"All done here."  He changes channels.  "Bridge, Yorblin.  Status:   eighteen injuries, no dead.   eighteen cases of radiation exposure   four trauma cases   two burn casesYou can pretty well guess who the hotshot with the burns and thetrauma is.

\'Vouf has a broken rib, a broken leg, a broken finger, a disjointed finger,  second degree burns over most of his head, bruises all over, and under, his body, radiation exposure, and a natsy headache.He\'s the worst we\'ve got, and he should be back on limited duty after a good rest.  He shouldn\'t ever try wrestling a robot again,and he should wait a few days before putting those damned gloves back on.

Zben is the next worst.  He\'s got first and second degree burns andradiation exposure.  Silvmane saved his butt by yanking down thosesuits on top of them.  He needs a good night\'s sleep and a littlepost-trauma counselling.

Horne is bruised and has exposure.  He\'ll be OK if he takes it easyfor a couple of days.

Lazer and Van Der Merwe have minor exposure and some bruises.  Lazerseverely twisted his trigger finger, and Christian got a nasty blackeye.

The remainder of the engineering and security teams all got some degree of radiation exposure.  We need to see them every few daysfor a couple of weeks for follow ups.


All three medical teams came through OK, but we\'re all really tired.Additionally, I advise we treat the hole crew for radiation exposureas a precaution.  This will put us a little bit short on supplies,but I think we can find enough at R-alpha to either trade for ormanufacture some.

With your permission, I\'d like to send all the doctors to bed, sir."

<Ger>
Very well.  We have about 14 hours till we re-enter so get a lot ofrest now.

- - ---- Bridge ----
<Etienne>
All non-critical systems re-booted without error sir.  Still isolated.We need to re-boot the main systems.  It will mean a (he pauses andscans his hand comp briefly) 2.2 second delay in re-entry, and we\'llbe sure all is working.  With your pemrission, sir..

<Ger>
One moment.
"All hands, this is commander Ger.  We will re-boot all main systems infive minutes.  Make sure all your sub systems are off-line, and shut-downuntil we finish re-initialization."  He turns back to Etienne.  "Commencere-boot in 5 minutes.  Let me know as soon as we\'re ready to bringlocal machines back on line.


- - ---- Engineering ----
Abuko, Werner, Silvmane, and Wrinkley don their decon gear and re-enterthe scene of the debacle.  

<Wrinkley>
Fortunately that plasma has a short half-life, or we\'d be in real trouble.

No other words are needed as the four look on and ponder the devastationof only a few seconds.  Then they begin to walk slowly over the entireengineering area, measuring, identifying, and when appropriate closing andsealing valves.

After about 15 mintes of working in silence the intercom comes alive.

<Abuko>
Bridge, engineering.  Status report.   Whole engineering deck is hot.  We nned to wait ~12 hours before      we can commence repairs.  Decon suits needed until then.  We      can work in 2.5  to 3 hour shifts in gear \'till then.   We\'ve got no emergency bridge.  Repair time - 12 hours.   We\'ve got no gravitics backup.  Repair time - 10 hours.   Power routing secondaries shaky.  Repair time - 5 hours.   Power routing primaries intact.   Power plant minor damage.        Repair time - 5 hours.   Jump drives intact.   Maneuver drives, maximum overboost will give us 98%                                    Repair time - 1 day.   Life support, minor damage.      Repair time - 3 hours.   Jump fuel 38%,   Primary fuel 39%   We need to decon engineering and all three of these passageways      between here and the riders.   AGNIS self-decontaminated.  We\'re releasing it.Any further orders?

<Ger>
Carry on.

Leadfoot is a mess.  A crumpled, shredded, lump of titanium and silicon.Abuko carfully takes the brain case, walks over to an isolation test bench and reconnects power to standby circuits.  "There.  that shouldhold you \'till we can find the signature of your killer.  For sure thatvargr did the hard work, but whoever put that bad seed in your brainis the one that *I* want."  Abuko is growling himself.  "You were doomed the moment you got that bug.  Whoever put it there is now justas dead as your are.  Only he doesn\'t know it yet."  As he finishes hissoliloquoy he scans the engineering deck, eyes burning at the devastation.He sighs deeply, his shoulders rising, then slowly falling as he conciouslyrelaxes.  "Oh well.  Gentlemen, we\'ve got a lot of work to do before were-enter normal space.  Let\'s be about it."  With that he slams his fiston a blistered red panel.  It opens revealing a nozzle and retractable hose.He grabs the nozzle, twists a valve, and walks toward the rear of engineering.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

                  ***** Day 5 *****
- - ---- R-alpha ----
Following a full evening of resting, sampling water and air, andfinding no significant, sentient-seeming life forms, the Trakh liftsto about 500m and starts a systematic scan for intelligence.
"Admiral, I have wood smoke, 200 km .. spinward".
There are no human words to describe the inner glee of a true predator,carnivore, _feline_, when that cat knows he\'s on the scent of a long-stalked prey.  This is the kind of glee that literally smells in thepassageways of the Trakh as the crew and landing parties are awakenedfor certain conquest.

"Aiwi.  Briefing in 30 minutes.  Take us to the top of that ridge,.."he indicates with a long, extended claw, in the holo-tank, "there.Put us behind some trees where we won\'t be seen for a few days.  Whilethese creatures are certainly no contest, we should watch them to seeif they carry any parasites or diseases, and to see if it will be moreadvantageous to kill or to conquer."


- - ---- Alcyon ----

The intercom comes to life at the (for some) unhealthy hour of 0600, transmitting unmistakably French-sounding words.  "All Transport team members report to the main bridge of the Alcyon in 30 minutes."

<chuckle> "I do hope I didn\'t wake anyone."
"Shrike here. Wilco, Out."
Charyn arrives, hair wet, with a cup of auto-chef coffee in hand.


Etienne is already on the bridge when people start arriving.  After everyoneis settled...

"Bon matin.  Sorry to wake you up so early but we have several things to discuss and there are only a few more hours until we reach the R-alpha system."

"First:  Niishu, have you calculated exactly what time we will be dropping out of Jump-space?"

   Aye.  It will happen early tomorrow evening, just after evening meal.   18:27:43.1 ship\'s time.  Jump capacitor discharge says we should be    at most a few hours away from R-alpha when we enter, and should have    almost no velocity beyond orbital.  Solar orbital, that is.

"Second:  You may or may not have heard but several of the physical scientistshave been manipulating the probe data of the ringworld and they have recentlyfound what appear to be high-tension power lines on the inside surface.  This may or may not be an indication of intelligent life still on the ring, but ifyou have any thoughts or ideas, let me know and I will pass them on."

"Third:  We have a new member in the transport team, recently awakened from cold sleep.  His name is Goughzar and he is a 16 year veteran IISS pilot and sensor operator from the domain of Antares.  Goughzar will be assigned to fly the scout ship _Paladin_ with Dr. Limner along as R-alpha expert.  I\'m not sure if this means they have already been picked as the first landing team ornot but I imagine Commander Ger will be having an all hands muster before theend of jump." 

"Fourth:  As some of you may have noticed I\'ve set a lot of alarms on bridgeand engineering monitors.  If anything goes wrong between now and a coupleof hours before we exit jump, I\'ll know about it right away.  This means wereally don\'t need anyone on the bridge for the next couple of hours and I think it would be a good idea if everyone got lots of rest.  I\'ll still bein and out of the bridge all the time, but if anyone wants to run a few training simulations, that shouldn\'t be a problem.  I will expect all of youto be ready for duty and at your stations at least 2 hours before end of jump.I realize that\'s quite a lot of time, but I am going to want a COMPLETE checkof all systems.  We can\'t afford any more of these \'accidents\'."
"As to what positions you will be filling, I\'ll let you know soon."

"Unless anyone has anything they\'d like to bring up that\'s all for now.  [Etienne grins] I have to get to sick bay before I get dragged there."



- - ---- Engineering ----
Redd continues working on teaching Leadfoot how to catch treerats.He casually tosses a small, fur-wrapped package, tied to a string,across engineering, then slowly drags it around.

Leadfoot catches it handily the first three or four times.  On the fifth, and fifth only, Leadfoot smashes the lure in its iron grip.  Had it been Bit, Bit would be a stream...

Later tests work fine.



- - ---- in the hangar  ----
"...vell, you see, chentlemen, zis device has only a short range, bursttransmitter...totally unsuited for tracking anyzing outside ze ship<sorryabout any heart attacks, I engaged the mouth before the brain finishedchugging along>. I zink zat zis bug vas planted by a more paranoid memberof ze crew to keep tabs on herr Bishop I vould tink...

I do, however, have zome further zuspicions to investigate...Herr Graf, Ivould like your permission to perform zome \'security maintenance\' on zomeof ze onboard eqvuipment, in particular, ze robots Lucan, Dulinor, and Leadfoot...Und I zink our \'mascot\' Bit should be thoroughly checked out forany biological contamination vich might account for ze unfortunatehangovers eggzperienced after ze party."



- - ---- Medical ----
"Azani reporting for duty, sir," states Jordan and immediately snaps toattention, revealing his sergeant stripes.

He is unarmed but looks very professional and strict.

Christian is taken aback, but recovers quickly and smiles at Jordan. "Atease, Sergeant." He turns back to the file he was viewing when Jordan camein and looks at it for a minute. Turning to Jordan, he looks a little moregrim and serious than just the minute before. "Sergeant, there is animportant job to be done before we go after the reluctant patients. Goget Thule Jonson and have the both of you meet me at the Alcyon cargobay, in full vacc-suit and bring decontamination gear. We\'ve got somerotten cargo boxes in the hold, so to speak. Clear?"




- - ---- Engineering ----
Finally  feeling  better  Dan reports to Engineering for duty. 

By the time Dan gets back, engineering is a  hive  of  activity  - Panelshave  their  covers  removed,  and  anxious  engineers  are  running  andre-running system checks on anything that the hydrogen spill  might  havedamaged, as well as routine maintenance on systems not needed in the jump,and painstaking anaysis of the failed fuel line.

Kimball  Redd  climbs  back  out  of the ceiling, trailing wires from thesystems damaged in the accident, and carrying a  clear  bag  filled  withpieces  of  torn and shattered metal. Throwing the bundle of wires in thegeneral direction of the nearest rubbish-box; already full to overflowingwith  damamaged  components, he mutters something about lighting circuitsbeing an electricians job, anyway, and starts to seal the  bag,  when  henotices Dan.

"Hi Dan, great to see you on  your  feet  again.  Are  you  feeling  wellenough  to  be  back  at  work  yet? Have the Doc\'s Ok\'d your coming backalready ? Still, seeing as you\'re here, how are you on  electronics  ?  -
The  ceiling  panels  got  blasted  in  the  leak, most of the wiring gotdamaged, and I\'m an engineer, not an electrician. Everyone else  is  busywith the drive controls, so I\'d appreciate any help up here."

"Doc says I can work for two hours today, but then I have to go back in formore tests to make sure I don\'t get whatever put all of you to sleep.I can handle your electronic problems. Do you want me to start on the rest of the ceiling panels?" Dan says to Redd.

Once  the  bag  is sealed, he replaces the ceiling panel and seals it up,marking it \'Under investigation - DO NOT REMOVE\'.
"I\'ve  sealed  it  all  to stop bit getting up there, he\'s altogether toocurious when it comes to new places to explore, and I\'d rather  not  havehim  loose in the fuel ducts."
Raising  his voice to be heard on the other side of engineering, he wavesthe bag of evidence and shouts "Could someone arrange  to  get  this  lottested, please - I\'m going for a break."
Dan looks down from the ceiling panel he was working from, and calls to Kimball.  "Hey Redd, I would hurry and head down there to sick bay if I were you, who knows you might get blasted with some LH and wind up there anyway."

- - ---- General ----
Early in the afternoon, a collection of still photos with accompanying typed   captions appear on the Alcyon\'s (physical) bulletin board.  Depending on whether the subjects have seen them, and on their sense of humor, some might be missing later.


(Bhyarrvouf, standing watch on the bridge in his showy black uniform and metal gauntlets.  He is looking out of frame.)  "Executive Officer, great... now all I need is my own fire hydrant."

(Drs. Limner, Werner, Morser, and Tabor bent over a screen showing a simulation of R-alpha.  Dr. Limner is looking up at the camera)  "Ah, Igor, you\'re here.  Did you bring the brain?"

(Mac Witfeld, talking in the mess hall)  "And then there was the time I fixed an air-raft with two paperclips   and some gum, upside down, in a blizzard..."

(Abdul Schmidt, in his usual shabby clothes and unshaved appearance)  Would you buy a used bomb from this man?

(Major "Lazer" Farouk, dressed in silk shirt and eyepatch, cutlass at his belt.  He is standing in a large space, probably the cargo hold, and shouting at someone out of frame.) 
  "Arrr!  Which one of ye scurvey dogs stole me parrot?"

(Adrian Bishop, the black many-lensed sphere of AGNIS floating at his shoulder.  In the background is a doorway in Engineering, with a caution stripe and "MAX. HEADROOM 2.3m" painted on the bulkhead above it.)  Born To Snoop

(Alliara Niigurd, waving the camera away as she works at a console)  Riddle:  How many angry feminists does it take to change a lighting   panel?   Answer:  That\'s not funny.

(Nishu Neriika, self-portrait in a mirror.  He\'s borrowed most of the photographic equipment on board and slung it around his neck, and looks  like the classic tourist complete with bright floral print shirt)  "SMILE!"

- - ---- Paladin

Ian and Limner can be seen infrequently carrying equipment around thepassageways, noting things on their hand comps, and retiring to the labs aboard the Paladin.  Ocassionally one of them will mutter something,stick his finger on the wall, and walk a few meters further.

Bishop wanders over looking positivily irate that they forgot to tell himsomething was going on.  "What\'s with the passive bugs and transmitters?"he asks.  "AGNIS, record."

<Ian>
Oh, hi.  We\'re creating a backup personnel communications system in casewhatever or whoever messed with the ship\'s computer, send a signal, andkilled people decides to shut down our comm-dots.  Besides, after thatbrush with the fleet, I\'ll feel better knowing that we have an inde-pendent monitoring of hallway traffic.

We\'re also testing our surface scan equipment.  We turn down the powerlevels running through specific, non-essential, circuits, and then slowly turn them up and see just how sensitive our detection gear is.

Finally, by placing a distributed network of different kinds of sensorsaround the Alcyon, we can calibrate our phase-synchronization programs,and, as icing can do a little jump-space warp experiment by comparingour readings with Nishu\'s and Charyn\'s sensors.

Ian then walks with Adrian and demonstrates how various kinds of gear operate, and what various kinds of readings mean. 

<Ian> "This is a carbon dioxide sensor.  It\'s a sure givaway for animal life.... Adrian.." Ian pauses with a slightly puzzled look on his face."Adrian, you ever wonder what it would be like?"

<Bishop>"What what would be like?"
<Ian>"On R-alpha.  Imagine living on a world where you never see stars.  Living on a world where the sun is *ALWAYS* directly overhead.  Shadowsnever change.  Nighttime is just like daytime, only dimmer.  No moonlight.No tides.  The horizon rises up to a point and disappears this way," hegestures down the hall, "and is horizontal this way."  He turns 90 to face a wall and spreads his arms.
"Whatever is sapient on that ring - and I\'m personally sure there is -must have a *really* different idea of the universe than we do.
"Oh well.  Now this is a portable radio direction finder..." He goes onlike this for about 20 minutes, when his commdot comes alive.<Limner>Ian, get down here.  I just noticed something odd.<Ian>Well, gotta go.A little while later, the silent AGNIS hovers nearby and catches afew snippets of their conversation:<Limner> ... creating a backup system to ... signals ... computer is down. <Ian> ...Great idea.  Ian\'ll stay out of your way.<Limner> .. setting up meson scanners to interferewith power signals to the computer ...... shut out all power by blowing the batteries and fusion generators ...<Ian> ... easy - didn\'t .. a test run ...<Limner> I don\'t know ... Leadfoot ... internal batteries, ... rather difficult ...... determine who or what reprog...  another renegade computer ...- - ----Command Meeting in the Lounge  Bhyarrvouf\'s gauntlets have been gone for several days. Now, at the time ofthe meeting, they\'re back. But he seems uncomfortable in them, and continually flexes his fingers and clenches his fists as he listens, trying to do so without distracting anyone (and being only partially successful). The effect is no longer that of a pair of effortlessly-comfortable gloves, but of a pairof hand-exercisers whose springs are too stiff.
<Van Der Merwe>
"To put it bluntly, Hammer was murdered, and his killer maystill be onboard. Approximately six hours after the remainder of the crewsuccumbed to the immune response, SGM Hammer was skillfully shot with amicroscopic needle containing curare. Death was nearly immediate."

<Vouf>
"Samshkarkh ROUKH!" \'Vouf\'s snarl is punctuated by an odd little noise, likea spring being twanged twice in rapid succession: *spung spung*. "If I get my hands on that backstabbing clipped-eared toothless barrelgut scum rat bilgetumor...." His voice trails off on a few more choice epithets.

<VDM>
"This means that it is quite possible that his murderer is still aboardthe Alcyon and has been awake for five more days than the rest of us.Obviously my team and I are doing our utmost to develop this information andidentify the murderer and likely saboteur. That is all I have at this time,people, any questions?"

<Vouf>
"Five more days...?" \'Vouf shakes his head wearily. "Too many questions, toofew answers. Why not just kill us ALL in our sleep, if he could kill Hammer?Unless...." He frowns, thinking furiously, then suddenly sits bolt upright inhis chair as if stuck in the rump with a pin. His eyes widen, then narrow intocruel slits, as his face takes on a look of cold, calculating murder. As Morser\'s commentary drones on in the quiet room, \'Vouf sits back in his chair and forces himself to relax. He doesn\'t make eye contact with anyone.Slowly and nonchalantly, he jots a few words down on a piece of notepaper fromCount Ger\'s desk. He folds the piece of paper over to conceal what\'s writtenon it, and casually drops it onto Lazer\'s lap as he gets up from his chair."If you gentlemen want to discuss matters further, please feel free to do so,"he says mildly. "I gotta use the little doggie\'s room-- I\'ll be back in amoment." And he lets himself quickly out of the room and heads down the hall. 


With a puzzled expression, Farouk opens the paper and skims it. The puzzlementis quickly buried by a perfect poker face as he rolls out of his chair and smoothly strides out of the room.
Almost as an afterthough, he calls back, "Sorry, gentlemen. Don\'t let my absence stop the fun."
- - ----Security ----
J. J. is sitting cleaning his pistols, smoking a cheroot and mutteringto himself. "No prints, just some very precise scratches. Too precise fora sentient to make..." Then loudly "Of course..." He gets up and heads forthe door saying over his shoulder as he goes "If I\'m right our saboteur wasright in front of our eyes all the time, best place to hide a tree..." Ashe heads for the hatch, loading his pistol as he goes the hatch opensabruptly.

\'Vouf storms into the Security headquarters on board the Talisman like Judgement Day. He\'s steaming mad, and not only does he have hisgauntlets back on, but he\'s carrying a massive Gauss pistol in eachhand. Without preamble, he makes a hand motion for all present toremove their commdots, and holds up a piece of paper that reads,"RADIO SILENCE".

When people comply, he barks, "HORNE! AZANI! Grab your hardware andcome with me to Engineering. JONSON! MAHLEL! SCHMUD! Follow behindus ASAP. I want at least one man with a heavy laser and one man witha fusion gun." He cocks the Gauss pistols. "We\'re going after thescumrot that murdered Hammer and put Devious in the meat locker!"

Without waiting for an answer, he charges back out again.

On the way down the corridor, Horne speaks, "SubCommander, I hope you arelooking for a robot, you see I just was on my way to find you. From whatI found on the bulkhead behind the panel on the airlock, very precisescratches too precise to be made by a sentient, but a robot..."
\'Vouf pauses for only the briefest instant and glared directly intoJ.J.\'s eyes.  A fleeting instant of communion and recognition anda very slight nod.  With that \'Vouf falls into muttering, he never muttered to himself before this trip. "Robots, never did trust them... they\'re too perfect, too good, give me sentient mistakes anytime..."

Farouk arrives at the armory hot on \'Vouf\'s heels, checking over his laser pistol.

"Dammit, you hear him! Combat gear, NOW!"  He tears his loose shirt over hishead, vaults a table and grabs a light armour vest. "Stay OUT of yourbattle dress!  It could be jimmied just like that iris valve."

"Azani, Mahlel, break out the heavy guns, but for GOD\'S sake, remember we\'rein jumpspace. Thul--ok, that\'s right--Abdul, get your rifle. Speed COUNTS, people! Andon oh good you\'re here. Arm up and follow us.  To Engineering."
Lazer sprints out hard after Thul, Horne, and \'Vouf.
Hearing the urgency in \'Vouf\'s voice, Azani quickly dons his combat armorand activates the electronics in it. The glimmer from the HUD illuminatesAzani\'s face and gives him an eerie presence. After suiting up he goesto his chest and places his hand on a print sensor.

"Confirmed." And the chest opens up. Inside is several small tray of firearm parts and miscellaneous cleaning tools for his auto-shotgun.He grabs the auto-shotgun and slaps a clip into it and pulls back thecharger, ready to rock and roll.  He then grabs his hand laser and holstersit at his side.

Andon opens his locker and quickly dons his flak jacket and pistol belt, grabshis rifle and starts to chase after the rest, but he stops short, when herealizes he\'s the last out.  He stops to seal up security, "Computer, sealsecurity, open for no one, command override only." As soon as the locks clickshut Andon races off.  

Christian Van Der Merwe bursts from Count Ger\'s office in an unprecedented speed sprint towards the Aurora, with the bellowed words "AENRRA! YOU FOOLHARDY TAILSNIFFER!" echoing in his wake. In his fearful and reckless hellbent flight, he squeezes past people in the hall with not a word, and probably cannons into one or two, but just picks himself off the deck in an instant and continues. As best he can, he seems also to be yelling instructions into his commdot.

Arriving at the Aurora soaked in sweat, Christian snatches a combat environsuit from the waiting Lucan and frantically struggles into it, cursing asseemingly stubborn fasteners impede his progress, even as Lucan assists inthe operation. Dashing into his surgery, he pounces upon a prefab traumakit, pauses for a microsecond to survey its contents, then tosses in auniversal antitoxin kit and a medical scanner.

Leaping back into the hallway, he grabs the laser carbine from Dulinor,tightens the securing straps, checks the status readout, then takes themedkit from the deck and sprints off back into the Alcyon toward thelocation of Bhyarrvouf\'s intrepid group, yelling into his commdot "DAMMIT\'VOUF, HOLD IT UP FOR A SECOND!" as he goes along. As he nears theirlocation and rounds the corner, he fervently hopes that he hasn\'t gottenthere too late.


Adrian Bishop virtually flys out of a side-passage, with thefloating AGNIS unit humming to keep up.
    
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up a sec." Bishop exclaims.  He\'s obviouslyin \'better shape\' then demonstrated in recent days. "What\'s with all thefirepower?  Finally cornered our pesky saboteur, eh?  Shoot-out at theLagoona Starbar, that sort of thing?"  He smiles as he talks.  One coulddescribe his mood as positively \'perky\'.
    
As the group hurries on, Bishop backpedals to maintain pace withthem.  "Well, Turnskaad will want to see all of this, I\'m sure."  Wheneyebrows raise at his sudden aquisition of backbone, Bishop declares,"Hey, large battleships, that\'s one thing.  But firefights mano-a-mano,that\'s no big deal.  I\'ve been in several of those.  AGNIS switch tohigh speed storage on my mark."
   
Just then, Bishop realizes where the security team is headed.  "Waita second, isn\'t this the way to the computer core?  Hmmm.  Maybe I shouldhave said mano-a-machino ..."



Azani follows \'Vouf and Thul and the rest of the security team.The auto-shotgun is off his back and is cradled in his arms. His gribtightens as he approaches engineering.

The HUD in his suit marks down targets and numbers them. He then takes athermo sight and peers down the hall for anyone around corners.Satisfied that no one is going to ambush them. He slowly waits for thenext command, while at the same time, typing in information on hisforearm calculator. His suit flickers and then anyone seeing into theinfrared has noticed that Azani has disappeared.


Johann watches first Vouf and Lazer leave, then Van Der Merwe rushing out,then Mac going.
  
Then some sounds comes through over the communications system. Sounds ofharsh language from engineering. Johanns face darkens and he springs up, overturning the chair and begins to run after Mac towards engineering.
"Hey! Vouf! Watch out for the laserwelder, it\'s in the middle tentacle on thebottom!" he shouts over the engineering channel between curses of "Bl**dyf***ers f***ing around with the brain of MY robot.", "One more killer mekbot incident in the bl**dy media and the bl**dy market will never recover.","If I get the sucker who did it I\'ll wring every last credit he\'s cost me outof him!"
  
He arrives, sees the AGNIS and mutters something about "Never should haverepaired that floating intel-breach in the first place."



"I\'m an idiot, Thul," \'Vouf grits, checking the auto-aim cybereyeson his guns against his data monocular as he strides down the hall."I couldn\'t see the forest for the trees, like you pinkstinks wouldsay. We scanned everything in the ship, right? We scanned OUTSIDEthe ship, right? We used everything at our disposal to make a goodsearch, and while we were doing that, we entrusted the very systemsthat were used to kill Nayduz and mangle Devious to someone wenever thought to suspect!" He stops for a moment, and Jonson nearlyruns him over. 

"AND MT!" \'Vouf takes off again. "It never occurred to me, but MT andSilvmane were probably his victims as well! It all fits together. Wewere out for five DAYS, man! A starship can\'t FUNCTION for five dayson its own, even in Jump! There are a zillion things to do, requiringa huge spread of skills, and if you\'re all alone, you\'d have to do everyjob on the ship-- and that doesn\'t leave any time to even SLEEP!"

By this point, they\'re approaching Engineering. \'Vouf slows, and checkshis weapons one more time before zipping his uniform up to his chin;Thul realizes it\'s actually an environment suit of some kind, and isprobably armored. "Our saboteur was a trusted source of continuity checks. He could move silently. He could run an entire ship by himself.He never slept. What does that tell you, Thul?" 

A brief look of dismay flashes across Lazer\'s face as \'Vouf\'s reasoning sinks in. "Oh hell...\'Vouf, what kind of armour does that thing have?"
"Be ready with that cannon; anything other than an immediate surrender,cut loose on full power. I\'m going in first; you\'re what\'ll keep himfrom killing me, my friend." He holsters his pistols but leaves thesnaps undone, waves the Security Team back from the door out of sight,and opens the hatch to Engineering, sauntering inside.

As \'Vouf enters the hatch, Abdul is ready to take a pot shot at any targetsvisible on the other side.  "Hope he knows what he\'s doing...", he mutters,"This isn\'t quite how I wanted to see a fusion blast."


Lazer quickly details Andon and J.J. to perimeter to keep the crew "the hell out of the way. And if they don\'t like it, stun them."  When Azani and Mahlel lope in, he gestures them into position.

J.J upon hearing his orders, grabs Bishop by the shoulder, "Keep your headdown if you don\'t want to get it shot clean off" Bishop hears the distinctiveclick of a hammer of a COLT 45 Revolver being pulled back. Horne\'s grins andclamps down on the cheroot in the corner of his mouth.

Andon takes up position down at the next intersection, puts on a gas mask andmakes sure he has a Tranq Gas grenade handy.




- - ---- Paladin

Goughzar pauses while looking over computer printouts and inspecting thePaladin. Looking up at Dr. Limner, he growls a bit and then clears histhroat.

"Sorry Doctor, bad habit". Switching the comdot and telling Limner todo likewise, he looks up...

"I\'ve only been awake a day and already they kill. I think we might beneeded!

"Doctor Van Der Merwe, this is Goughzar. Where are you! Do you needassistance?" As he moves about the Paladin, he finally throws off theprintouts and heads towards the stateroom where he stashed his equipmentearlier. "Just in case!" he shouts back at Dr. Limner as he looks up.


The commdot crackles to life, and as Christian speaks, Goughzar can heara variety of sounds indicating that the speaker is running through thehallways at a significant rate of speed. <...> Almost .. reached \'Vouf ..Don\'t know what .. up .. Hope I\'m in time .. Wish luck.. <...>
Azani starts to tap on his wrist comp and speaks into his headset.

"Doctor Van Der Merwe, maybe you should assign someone to get sickbayready incase we have some serious fatalities...Azani out."

Jordan then goes back into his crouching position and readies himselffor the firefight.

Christian mutters to himself. "Dammit, I should have realized that." As hearrives at the combat team\'s location, he quickly stabs at his commdot.<...> Doctor Yorblin, report to main surgery (aboard the Aurora) stat!Prepare to receive possible trauma facilities. Everybody else, prepare tomove if we do get casualties. I will provide on-site care. Will call formedbots if needed. VDM out. <...>As Goughzar is bouncing about his stateroom aboard the Paladin, he finallymanages to strap the power pack for his laser carbine over his back andthen hears over the comdot "...Yorblin... ...report to main surgery......stat!". Finishing grabing the carbine itself, he finishes the connections.

"Doctor. I am sure I will be too late to help in the firefight, but I musttry to help in some manner. I\'m going to head to sickbay and see if I mightbe needed there. I\'m going to leave now, and you are quite welcome to joinme!"As he finishes the sentence, he grabs the helmet to his suit (tailored vaccsuit - scout exploratory issue) in his other hand and begins to jog throughthe corridors to the access to the aurora."Yorblin responding to the trauma bay aboard the _Aurora.  Goughzar meetme there.  Dr. Limner stage just outside the firefight zone, hold on andI\'ll see what other info we can get.  Christian, where would you likeDr. Limner to stage?  How about the rest of the medical team?  Ifyou could give us a SITSTAT {situation status report} that would beappreciated.  What hostiles are we up against?  Any danger zones we needto avoid?"Jan snarfs down the rest of his chocolate croissant as he runs downthe p-way."_Aurora_ medcomp, voice activation Yorblin, set up trauma bay one tomy preset, standby for possible ballistic, blast, and burns.  Set updecon prepack in airlock.  Dulinor, Lucan acknowledge and assist asneeded."
As he is jogging, Jan is slipping on his gloves and attaching the hoodof his vacc suit.  He leaves the helmet off, ready to slip over hishead, if the alarm should sound.
"Christian, if you get a chance to pass it up the chain of command,see what security we may need around the treatment area.  If we can\'tget someone down there, at least send a runner with a couple of gausspistols for me, ta."
"Goughzar here, Acknowledged. I have a laser carbine with full chargeand can act as security if needed. I\'d probably be more useful in thatfunction anyway - I\'m only rated as a class 1 medic."
"Well, Doctor", Zar says to Dr. Limner, "It seems we play withthe Paladin\'s sensors and computer later."
Goughzar rechecks the connection and charge on the laser carbine andactivates it in case of emergency. Under the other arm he carries the helmetin case of decompression. Zar continues to the Aurora.
Joachim\'s voice comes on the comdot: "Dr. Tabor here, where do youwant me.  I have extensive emergency surgical experience but no heavyweapons." 
You hear Doctor Limner come on the air.  He seems to bebreathing heavily as he talks, as if he is involved insome physical activity.
"I\'m currently aboard the grav bus on the Paladin, which has trauma facilities.  If you wish, I\'ll go to the Alcyon medical bay, although right now I\'m preparing for backup communications in case we need them.  I can also be of direct help from here.  Ask \'Vouf what I mean.  By the way, we\'d better make sure everyone is wearing a vacc suit and carrying a flashlight.""Doc, Ian.  I\'m here with Limner.  We\'re ready for decomp andburns, not hypothermia.  I think we\'ll be more usefull, overall, here."Ian turns back to the ad-hoc computer interface, voice and keyboardcommands flying thick and fast."Tabor, this is Yorblin, head towards _Aurora_, we will be using it asprimary receiving.  Establish triage \'midships to decon.  Goughzar isacting as decon and security.  Dr Limner is at _Alcyon_ \'bay as secondaryreceiving. Christian is with the entry team."
"Christian, suggest you take Spears as your back-up medic.  Anyone elsewe need to assign?"
"\'Vouf, sir, suggest you order the decompression klaxon sounded, and letpeople suit up in the event of pressure loss."Jan, having said his bit, his trauma room ready, does what every experiencedmedic awaiting wounded does.  Going to the kitchen unit he dials up coffeeand an pseudosteak sandwich, not knowing when the next time to eat may be.Goughzar comes to rest outside the Iris valve leading to the Aurora. Jangoes on inside and Zar squats down next to the valve and over to the side.The laser carbine is on and ready and the helmet for his vacc suit is in hislap, in case of decompression.
As he sits, he pulls out his hand comm unit and tunes it directly intothe Paladin\'s computer, and checking it over, routes communication to Dr.Limner from his hand communicator to the Paladin to Dr. Limner.Opening it up, he activates the voice-only and starts speaking to Dr. Limner,"Hello doctor, nice to hear from you. I\'m outside the _Aurora_ doing..."As he speaks, he keeps a close eye on the corridor for either wounded orhostiles.This is Tabor, I\'m on my way.



Taking a moment to catch his breath, Christian stops at the rear of thearmed team and nods grimly at Bhyarrvouf, as if to say \'Ready when you are\'He taps his commdot, again.<..> Morton, stage at Alcyon sickbay as alternate trauma center. Gustav,
we have a probable cyber renegade. Situation unclear. Stay clear of Alcyonengineering. Keep team ready. Will advise. <..>

"_Aurora_ medcomp, voice activation Yorblin, set up trauma bay one tomy preset, standby for possible ballistic, blast, and burns.  Set updecon prepack in airlock.  Dulinor, Lucan acknowledge and assist asneeded."

<..> Advise possible toxic agents, be prepared. <..>

"Christian, if you get a chance to pass it up the chain of command,see what security we may need around the treatment area.  If we can\'tget someone down there, at least send a runner with a couple of gausspistols for me, ta."

This is file #5 of 5
This file covers the re-emergence of the Alcyon.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
                  *** day 7 ***

- - ---- Ship\'s Assembly, mid-afternoon ----

Ger stands before the entire crew, not nearly so formal as during theinitial assemblies.  \'Vouf and Zben have bandages on various parts oftheir heads.  \'Vouf\'s right leg is in a cast, and he is on crutches,undoubtedly refusing to be seen on a grav-chair.  AGNIS floats toward the rear of the room, unobtrusively.  Abuko, Werner, Silvmane, and Wrinkley are exhausted, after putting in a second shift in engineering.

Ger addresses the crew.

"For your edification, we\'ve synthesized the records made by the Paladin\'s sensors, by AGNIS, and by the suit sensors used by the security team,during the night.  We have a short rundown of the engagement, so you can think about what happened and use the lessons learned to some advantagewhen we reach R-alpha."

He presses a button on his hand comp and the large holo tank comes alive,with a view of engineering just as the door opens and \'Vouf walks in.\'Vouf looks at the robot and starts to speak.

"I have the sound turned down for obvious reasons." Ger says as he stopsthe playback.  He continues.  "At this point, you can see three unprotected engineers, on duty, starting to scramble for safety.  Also at this point, Leadfoot correctly recognizes a danger and dumps all available power to his gravitics and laser."  The playback starts again.  "As leadfoot beginsto spin and move he completes his most significant offensive action,"the playback slows to a crawl "one most of you didn\'t even know happened.Here his microwave transmitter contacted the main computer on-boardhigh-speed communications interface, and transmitted a virus to the Alcyon.... Here he does the same thing to AGNIS, and ... here he does it tothe command shuttle.
"Fortunately, Drs. Limner, Zar, and Thomas worked all day yesterday on wayswe could verify what was happening.  We don\'t know what this virus was.We re-booted everything and destroyed it.  No, Adrian, we didn\'t washany data from AGNIS.
"At this point, Leadfoot kills the lights and signals the false decompwarning.  We probably would have done well to heed it and close allthe doors, anyway.
"Here, \'Vouf draws and fires.  I didn\'t know he was *that* fast.  Youcan see here in the enhancement that most of the flechettes bounced offtools and ricocheted all over engineering, causing minor damage.  Threerounds do get through, though and almost sever the laser welder.
"Now, Thule fires.  His laser bolt penetrates the skull completelyand exits, after which it burns a hole in the secondary power cablinginsulation.

"And the real killer...Abdul fires.  A fusion gun certainly is not myfirst choice of on-board weapons, although it was certainly effective.Notice that he fortunately hits leadfoot squarely in the body.  Theblast, ... well, you know what the blast did."

At this point, Ger speeds up the playback for a few seconds as bodies robots and equipment fly across the room.

"Now, \'Vouf decides to administer a coup de gras with his gloves.  Iguess it worked."  You can see \'Vouf attack the rising Leadfoot andwatch as his ears flex backward repeatedly from  the awful sounds causedby the tearing of the metal and the screeching of his gauntlets.  Suddenly, and with amazing clarity you can see the agonized expressionon the vargr\'s face as he loses his grip because of the snapping ofhis tibia on the flat of the secondary bridge console.

The view shifts and you can see the IR tell-tale from Thule\'s sightmoving steadily with the advancing form, stayin dead on the jointbetween the lower body and the upper articulations.  A bright flash,and the playback ends.

As the holo disappears, the room erupts in many small, almosthushed, conversations.  The CO waits a few moments for the discussion to die down.

"Mainly, I wanted to make sure all of you saw exactly what happenedin there.  I know a lot of us weren\'t aware of lwhat was happening,and a lot of us have never before seen combat quite this personally.That whole sequence took six seconds.  It will take us almost six days to repair the damage.  I\'ll leave to each of you to decide if it was worth it to remove a sabteur.  

"Oh yes, we do have reason to believe that the virus was introduced before we left, not after."

He pauses a few more seconds, looking around.  He steps down off thesmall rise he has traditionally used as a podium.  He grabs an emptychair from the front row, and sits backwards on it, leaning his elbowson the back of the chair.

"Well, we\'ll be arriving shortly.  We have now completed the *easy* part of our mission.  I have it on good authority our sabteur hasmet his maker."  He smiles wryly at Abuko.  

"Now, we are about to visit a single world with the same habitable surface area as all of the inhabited worlds in the Imperium put together." He pauses to let that sink in.  "There are fewer thanforty of us.  We have to find the history of a long-dead race, find an intelligent species, and prevent Imperial conflicts from destroying this gem of an artifact.

"We are much better prepared for this part of our mission than we were for sabotage, however.  Look around you.  We are scientists, we are engineers, we are scouts.  Only a few of us are trained killers."  Heslows down just a little.  "And all of us, _all_ .. _of_ .._us_, haveworked our whole lives for this moment.  For this opportunity.

"You have demonstrated a teamwork on board these last few weeks.  You have demonstrated tenacity in adversity.  And you have demonstrated an ability to adapt.  All of these are needed and will serve us in good stead in our coming venture. 
"When MY grandchildren ask me what it was like, I will proud to tell themhow wonderful it was to serve with the greatest collection of explorersever assembled. 

"I salute each and every one of you.

...

After about three seconds, Ger stands, carefully replaces the chair andsteps pack up on the rise.

"We re-enter our universe shortly after evening mess.  Make sure yourgear is properly stowed, and everything is ready for the transition.After we arrive, crew of first away team will be posted.

"Dismissed".



Several hours later, almost at the preidicted moment, the jump warningsounds, and the lights dim.  Once again, everyone is subjected to thatannoying, nauseating, tumbling, feeling, and the pale blue glow on allthe outside monitors is replaced by starlight and sunlight.

Everyone hears, from just over her or his left shoulder a quiet, soothing,alien, voice.  In each person\'s native tounge comes the message:

"Welcome.  We have been expecting you.  An envoy will be up shortlyto show you where to dock.  The peace of the cosmos be with you."
None of the typical intercept or probing signals appear on the ship\'ssensors.

Looking out any viewport, you can see just how good a jump this was.In an arc stretching from as far as you can see forward to as far asyou can see aft, and slightly below the Alcyon, is a wall of dark, gray,metal, with sunlight shining off the edges.  Far forward you can seea second arc and far aft is a third.  These two are tiny silvery bandsthat begin well away from the vanishing points of the metal floor, andextend around, behind, and above a shimmering greenish-yellow star.These tiny bands almost connect above the star, giving the appearanceof a halo.  Keen eyes detect a very slight fuzziness at the edges ofthe "floor" near you.
Inward from the first ring, a second becomes visible.  It is in a planewith the first ring, but much smaller, and much darker.   
The inside of the ring is visible fore and aft of Alcyon as the wallarcs away from you.  You can clearly see forests, seas, deserts, islands,continets, and various signs of life - villages, smoke, roads.  Motiondetectors tell of flying creatures as well.

The speed of rotation of the ring is much more than the speed of yourorbit.  The breathtaking view literally flies by as sciences asks Christianto have Lucan or Dulinor bring a couple more cases of holo-crystals up to the lab.

Hi folks, I just squashed a bug in my TML Incoming Mail DigesterSoftware.  If two messages come in to the TML (the"traveller@metolius.wr.tek.com" address) at the same time, the softwareis supposed to serialize its processing so messages get added to thedelivery queue one at a time and so the archive message numbers anddelivery queue don\'t get messed up.

I discovered today that my lock algorithm was slightly broken so theserialization did not occur.  The end result was that messages werebeing lost - they never appeared in the digests.  The only clue is thatthere is a gap in the archive message numbers (the number in the subjectlines).  Over last few months, I\'ve lost three of four messages from TMLsubscribers that way.
I\'d like to apologize to those of you who have sent messages thatvanished; this behaviour should no longer occur.

James

With A-EMS topaint targets for laser guided bombs heads up displays it makes agood all round fighter compared to the "drop everything for speed"approach of the Indianapolis. 4 troops can be carried and a hatchallows them access to the bomb bay where drop capsules may becarried. The bomb bay is used primarily for entry into theatmosphere from orbit when the aircraft needs it\'s streamlining themost, but the external hardpoints are used for missile loads.
     There are preloaded racks aboard the Overlord which can beinstalled in the bomb bay quickly for fast turn around. The Wingtip launch rails are invariably loaded with anti-ship missiles fordefense. Watch out for that bomb bay load:  as many as 40 clusterbombs or Fuel/Air explosives.

                        Wraith Medium Grav Tank
 
 
  The Wraith was designed to the requirements of the KKMD armour units.For crew convenience, roomy seats are provided. Weapons are installed ina remote turret, the crew - inside the hull. Standard doctrine calls foruse of the laser for long range fire and for the fusion gun for mediumrange or closer. Indeed, the laser and fusion gun cannot firesimultaneously. The 0.5MW laser is operated by the commander from insidethe hull and fires in a 70 degree arc forward. 
  An extensive sensor and computer suite allowed the designers tosimplify the control system of the craft even beyond the existing level,up to and including removal of the gunner. The KKMD declined thisoption, settling for a lower endurance and larger crew in order toretain the tactical advantage accorded by a tank commander.

An increasedarmour fit required a more extensive grav unit to maintain speed on parwith the Wraith and the weapon fit is sparser in order to conserveweight, space and power. Because of the increased weight, durationsuffers a marked decrease.    As in the Wraith, the laser is installed are in a remote turret.

Remarks: The Daniel Kellogg class is a rework if the RebellionSourcebook\'s rework (SEH class) of the Gionetti class cruiser fromSupp 9:  Fighting Ships.
 
The Kellogg class light cruiser is named exclusively for posthumousrecipients of the Imperial Starburst for Extreme Heroism.
 
"Originally intended as a fast-reacting fighting ship, its actualuse has evolved with experience. The ship is currently in favor asa flagship for many minor operations. Its high jump capability make(sic) it extremely responsive to most situations, and it ispossible to displace troops or service crew (or both) to providequarters for command and staff personnel." - Fighting Ships
 
Question, did I name this ship in a fit of egotism?  No, justfamily history:  Here\'s the score as I know it. One at Bunker Hill, One at The Little Bighorn, One at the Alamo, and One on board theArizona at Pearl Harbor. (I haven\'t checked the Vietnam memorial) Seeing as we\'re on a winning streak, it therefore seems resonableto me that some offspring of mine is probably going to win one ofthe aforementioned awards...
 
Enjoy, Scott Kellogg

    Hmmm. Looking at the MT combat rules, (which are much changed from theold Traveller rules), I note that a ARL using HEAP has a Pen=10, damage=4,Autofire targets=2, Danger Space=1.5, difficulty as Rifle, and counts as Gyro-stabilized.  I note that some guy in a TL 14 vacc suit has an Armor Value=7, and I assume this target type person is an average Joe, with physical stats of 777, giving a hits value of 3/5.  Good so far?    We will assume that Average Joe in the Vacc suit is shot, for no goodreason, by X the Unknown, who is armed with the afore-mentioned ARL. We assume that X has a typical skill of 2 (and an average dex = 7) with his weapon of choice. We further assume that X shot Average at medium range, which seems to be typical firefight range, and I don\'t feel like fooling with attenuation right now.
    Okay, first we find out that the task for X blowing away Average is
        Routine, Weapon, Dex, Move DM, 1 rd (Gryo-stabilized Rifle)
which means X needs to roll a 4 or better on 2D to hit.  On the average,X will roll a 7, which gives him 3 better than what he needed to hit.HEAP against the Vacc Suit is a low penetration hit, halving damage to 2,but X rolled over 2+ what he needs to hit, so it\'s doubled, back to 4.But wait!  X, being a smart, if nasty, kinda guy, goes for pinpoint hits,(pinpoint hit requires rolling 2+ than he needs to hit, but with evenminimal skill, it\'s likely to work, unless the dice are feeling nasty.)targetting those weak points (like the faceplate).  Good ol\' Average\'s Vacc Suit only counts as an Armor Value of 3.5 (4)...which moves the HEAP shot to a HIGH penetration hit, which does 4 points....still doubled, now to 8 points, because X still rolled 2 or more than what he needed tohit.  And, since the ARL is an autofire type weapon, if X is feeling reallynasty, he can follow the first shot up with a 2nd one, of similar damage,in the same round.
    So what happened to Average?  Well, the 8 points were applied againsthis hits of 3/5 (total 8).  If Average is an unimportant NPC, X just blewhim away...if Average is a PC or important NPC, we flip over to the nextchapter, "Assessing Damage".  We find that each damage point from combattranslates to 1d6 applied to the first 3 stats...just like in old Traveller.So, our Average Joe just took 8d6 damage...he might live through it...except that X, if he\'s feeling nasty, followed up with a second 8d6 hit.This is if X just performs at an average level.  Maybe X is lucky today.If X rolls a 12, he gets 8 above what he needs to hit... and does 8 * 4,or 32 points --> 32d6 to Average Joe.  They use a vacuum hose to pumpthe remains out of his vacc suit. And then there\'s the 2nd shot...
    Please note that Armor vs. Penetration determines whether it isa high, low or zero penetration hit...that is the sole effect of armor. Itdoes NOT absorb damage on top of that.
    Amused parties may want to run through similar examples with say, clotharmor vs projectile weapon of choice to reassure themselves that, yes, firefights are dangerous.  Note that cloth armor was DESIGNED to protectits wearers from similar tech-level weapons.  Also note that even azero-penetration, 1 pt hit can do up to 8 point (=8d6) if the shooter isskilled and lucky.  And 8d6 can kill an average character if the dice roll right.  I hope this discussion clears up any confusion outthere on relative lethality of combat, and/or how combat works.  The damagepoints vs hits system is there to provide quick adjudication of hitresults; players can find out how damaged they and the NPCs really are afterthe shooting stops (ie, translate hits to D6 of damage against stats).
 
>  A submachine gun only firing 1,3 or 30 rounds in a combat round...>  I don\'t understand. 
...Single-shot, burst, and full-auto settings, respectively.  Fullyautomatic weapons actually have a rate-of-fire selection switch. (I wonderwhat they call the high setting on a VRF gauss gun...Puree?)
    If you want to empty your pistol at a high-rate of fire, there is anoption called rapid-fire that allows you to do that, and spray the landscapewith lead, besides.

In response to 2301 and related entries,
I have a hard time with the comments about the number of starships in theImperium.  
Dragging out TCS, Mercenary, and diverse other sources (like my calculator andvaroius sector listings), i note that the average starship costs between $500Kand $2M per ton (displacement, of course).

1)  Trin produces a Naval budget in the general range of $5000,000,000,000.
2)  Using the assumptions in TCS campaign rules, they would be able tomaintain ten years production as the value of their local fleet.

3)  Using $2M/ton as cost, this translates to ABOUT 25,000,000 tons ofstarships maintained by the Trin defense forces.
4)  At about 100,000 tons per ship, this gives Trin 250 major warships.
5)  Using the assumption that there are 11,000 Imperial worlds, of which 8.3%are high pop (at half of Trin\'s pop on average - a bad assumption - a betterone would be twice Trin\'s pop - a lot of A worlds out there ((Gad, that wasrun on and confusing))), produces an Imperium wide Naval force of AT LEAST115,000 major warships (100,000 tons or so).
This assumes that most, if not all, Imperial naval ships are a) expensive (ona per ton basis), and b) 100,000+ tons.  A better assumption for AVERAGEtonnage would be less than 50,000 tons apiece, therefore 230,000 ships (ormore).  Estimating the effect of the other 10,000-odd world should add aboutten percent more to the total fleet strength - 253,000 ships.

Note that this number is a minimum based on an assumption that the averageeship tonnage is about 50,000 tons.  Based on all published modules, there isevery likelihood that the average is as low as 25000 tons (double that numberAGAIN! - 500,000+ warships.)

6)  merchant ships - Using Striker, Trin has an estimated GWP of 300 trillioncredits.  Assuming that about 0.1% of the GWP is invested in ship-building,and that the TCS campaign assumptions still apply, Trin maintains a fleet ofabout 12,000 ships similar in size (and cost) to a Tukera long-liner.   This is a terrible assumption, as Trin is close enough to it\'s neighbors toonly need jump-2 ships for most local commerce.  A better assumption would be20,000+ ships of similar size (or perhaps 100,000 small, cheap ships like thefree trader or fat trader).

7)  again, estimating the Imperial population from published data, the numberof merchant ships in the Imperium at any given time should be between6,000,000 and 10,000,000, with an upper limit of perhaps 50,000,000.

8)  Note that the fraction of the USA\'s GNP devoted to internal transportationsystems (trucks, barges, planes) is rather higher than 0.1%.  Note thatinterstellar trade is a major factor in the Imperium, at least based on thenumber of IMMENSE corporations that invest heavily in the field.

9)  Note also, that a planet like Trin probably has upwards of 10,000 ships inport at any given time, excluding non-starships.  Busy, eh?   Note also thatTerra system would make Trin look like a Ghost town (50,000+ ships in port onany given day, and 1000+ ships travelling to or from the jump points at anygiven instant)

Just thought I would share a few thoughts on the commonness of starships inthe Imperium.  Comments?

In TML message number 2320, it was stated that the MT rules for fuel usage infission plants were out to lunch.  I have to agree.  

>From my Naval Nuke School days, I acquired a good feel for fuel usage in anaval nuclear reactor.  The suggested conversion of hours-years in the tableis the one we use when we do fission plants.  It is a convenient conversion,but NOT especially accurate.  Modern naval nuclear plants are CONSIDERABLYmore efficient than that.  Probably hour-two years would be more accurate.
As to the difficulty implied be the fact that that would make a fission plantconsiderably superior to a fusion plant, ALAS!   MT fusion plants are a mongthe most mind-boggling INEFFICIENT power plants i have ever heard of.According to my calculations, a MT fusion plant (TL 15) is about 0.014 PERCENTefficient at getting usable energy from fusion. Slightly ridiculous, eh?A possible explanation for the above inefficiency is that a VERY largefraction of the fuel used in a fusion plant is used to cool the plant, and isthen dumped overboard.  This would imply that planetside plants should beperhaps 1000 times as efficient (or perhaps 2-3000) as shipboard plants.
Unfortunately, this does not explain why fusion plants are preferred tofission plants in the Imperium.  I prefer to believe that there are ratherobscure environmental protection statutes involved (read: wierd localprejudices).  Alternatively, the fact that fission plants are REALLY heavy,and cannot produce any reasonable amount of agility might be considered. still another possibility, all them guys may have forgotten fission in thelast 3000+ years.  whichever.

Are you using the correct internet address for sunbane? It changed 6-9months ago to 129.100.100.12.  If you have old how-to-get-archivesinstructions, they list a different internet address.

I checked that I could connect to sunbane at 129.100.100.12, from mylocal internet machine, gateway.bv.tek.com, just now.  Sunbane was slow,but definitely alive! The PBEM turns are even there, stored in thepub/traveller/pbem directory in files PB1 thru PB14.  (Thanks for movingthem into the traveller area so quickly, Dan!)

Traveller Mailing List Administrator	     James T Perkins @ Tektronix, Inctraveller-request@metolius.wr.tek.com	     Beaverton, Oregon, USAuunet!metolius.wr.tek.com!traveller-request  "Load Auto/Evade, Beowulf!"----Archive-Message-Number: 2343From: Richard Johnson <richard%oresoft.com@RELAY.CS.NET>Subject: What to do with the PBEM archives?Date: Fri, 10 May 91 10:56:19 PDTI have received numerous suggestions and requests that we considerpublishing the Mega-PBEM.  I have been thinking about this now, andhave a few ideas I\'d like feedback on.
1.  Desire:
	Do we really want to put the effort into it?  Such an	undertaking would cost those involved even more of that	irreplaceable commodity - time.  Think about it.
	
2.	Format:
	We really have three good vehicles for the endeavor. 
	1. We can publish a novel (actually, probably a series)
 	
	2. We can do a campaign materials package with adventure   	   supplements, pre-gen\'d characters, deck plans, maps, etc.

    3. We can (maybe) do a computer game based on the Aclyon	   adventures.

	So, thinking this over, we could do one, two or all three of	these.  I personally think the first would be the most	financially rewarding, but we have some hoops to jump through,	and it\'s got the smallest chance of finding a publisher.  The	second would be the most fun for us collectively (I think) but	have minimal return.  The third would be the hardest to do, but	the most fun for us individually later.

3.  Return:
	I think it\'s _possible_ to make money from this.  If it happens	it won\'t be much.  Well, more properly don\'t expect much.  The	chance of return goes down exponentially with the size of the	return.

	I think if we do wangle a deal for whatever, we should put the	money in escrow for either a PBEM/TML convention somewhere	someday (if it\'s a lot), a subsidy for TML\'ers who *need* public	access but can\'t afford it, or a fund for miscellaneous things	like disks, postage, or whatever.  Or...  My idea is that	*really* any reward that happens to come out of a mutually fun	project should benefit us all.


I think we have the muscle, training and talent to do all threevehicles.  (Great from a marketing standpoint.)  I\'m not sure wehave the will power.  (I doubt my own, too.)

I invite your comments.

    'body' => '  The time has come to mention the background of the story. Early winter 87(I think it was) three upstart traveller campaigns had failed for one reasonor another (one mine, two others) and the movie \'Aliens\' had just come tothe local theatre, which apparently is on the absolute end of a distribution circle.
  So we went to see it and afterwards someone commented: "We could do thatin Traveller." and after a short discussion it was decided that I\'d do something\'Alienesque\' to start off a campaign with. Having a nasty streak as a Ref andknowing that everyone in the group had seen the film and was expecting asingle reenactment, I played some pranks on them. The first appears in thisepisode, where one character encounter a harmless herbivore that just happens to look like a facehugger. I\'ve seldom seen a player being more terrified thanhis character, but this was one of those rare moments:)

  BTW, Zod\'s episodes with the watch, the SMG and the turret actually happened that way, unbelivably but true. The SMG became an institution in the game before the sad demise of Zod in the slavehold of an Shionthian galleon.

Voyage of the "Gamla Bettan" part Three           Something in the Engine Room is Drooling:Time: 071-1112  1000 hours Imperial Standard TimeLocation: Pixie/Regina/Spinward Marches

The Gamla Bettan and Crew:   Gamla Bettan (Old Betty in the language of some ethnic worlds of the Imperium. Swordworlders might understand it too) is a tech 11 Scoutship about 35 years old. She is of a variant class and is shorter and thicker than the standard Type S, but has the same performance. Gamla Bettan lacks armament.   Preben Moeller, Scout, 26 years old. Smart but with great lapses in education and behaviour in a civilized environment. Trained as pilot and navigator. Born in the absolutely worst slum district of Efate. Ran Xboats between Regina and Rhylanor for 8 years.   Werner Schmallhaussen, Major in the Roupian State Security, 26 years old. Very good with all kinds of slugthrowers. Werner has been trained in various military areas, including infantry tactics, using a SMG, and as a corpsman. Born on Roup and currently on extended AWOL.   James P Troop, ForceCommander in the Imperial Marine Corps, 34 years old. Strong, smart and agile, but with a behaviour and language fitting a Sergeant Major. Born in the Shionthy belt, and managed to get out. Trained to lead marines in combat, but little else useful.   Zod Miandwhypt, Master Chief Petty Officer in the Imperial Navy, 30 years old. Good shot and quite smart, but prone to act first and think later. Zod were chief NCO of the gunnery section of the \'Monsoon\', a \'Wind\' class Strike Carrier in the Imperial 213th Fleet. Born on Knorbes and got to Regina as a stowaway.   (Baron) Roshel von Tjaikovskij, Lieutenant Commander and Chief Engineer onboard the \'Monsoon\', 30 years old. Roshel began his career as a fighter pilot but later got a transfer to the engineering-branch. He is usually happy when he has a set of drives to take care of and a fighter to fly.

   "And it\'s got to show local time on Regina, Capitol, Vland, Terra and Zhodane!" Zod told the clerk.   "Zhodane? Why Zhodane?" the clerk asked suspiciously.   "Because everybody says \'Attack at dawn!\', And if I\'m gonna attack the Zho\'s at dawn, I must know when they think dawn is! It\'s common logic!"   The clerk looked confused "Hmm, That *sounds* logical... But I\'m sorry, We have no watches that have Zhodane time preset. But we have, of course, several models that can have many customized local times. Here for example," he took up an expensive-looking watch from the counter, "is Ling Standard\'s \'TransImperial-5B\' model. It\'s got IST and Capitol time preset and can have up to 20 local times programmed into it. It is equipped for the LST-signals on most average stellar and above worlds.   "What\'s that?"   "LST means \'Local Standard Time\' and the LST signals are transmitted on a standard channel throughout the Imperium. They will give the watch information about the correct local time on the world in question. Additionally the TransImperial-5B is made from LSP\'s secret-formula \'PseudoMonadium(tm)\' alloy and can for an unlimited duration withstand all atmospheres that a human will survive in. It comes with a data crystal that lists more than 1000 major worlds and their local time data."
   "What about Zhodane?"   "Let me check, yes Zhodane is among those worlds that..."   "It\'s settled then." Zod interrupted him, "I\'ll take it!"   "That will be 1500 credits, thank you."   "One point five kays?! But if it got all those timezones.."   When he had bought the watch, Zod went looking for the others. He found Preben and Troop at the Interstellarms weapons centre were the clerk were demonstrating a Gauss rifle for Troop. The shop was the consummate dream for everyone with an interest in weapons. Every wall were lined with transparent cases filled with weapons of every conceivable configuration, and several holoviewers played demo-tapes where people dressed in camouflage armours demonstrated the weapons in operation.   "This is the Interstellarms M25 Defender, the absolutely latest in high-penetration electric slug-throwers. In addition to all the standard features it has a laser-point sight with either visible or infrared light," she pointed the rifle towards a full-figure target in the back of the shop and a tiny red dot became visible over the heart of the target, "that almost guarantees a hit versus targets at less than twenty meters. It accepts both the MilSpec 40round mag and a special 100round mag made especially for the M25. It also incorporates a unique \'booster\' powerunit that will increase the lethal energy of the rounds by twentyfive percent. It lasts for one 100 rounds magazine before recharging. Now, moving down to the grenade-launcher..."   "Is it legal here?" Preben asked tiredly.   "Excuse me?" the clerk had been so caught up in the demonstration that she almost missed the question.   "I asked if it is legal here on Pixie."   "Eh, no, it\'s not legal here, but that isn\'t a problem. We deliver it door-to-door to your ship or sent it to an address of your choice in the subsector."   "Is it legal on any worlds in the Marches?"   "Yes, absolutely, absolutely!" she began typing on a terminal."There is about fifty worlds in the Spinward Marches where it is legal."
   "Anyone in this subsector?"
   "Yes, Dentus and Efate. Sorry, Efate\'s under martial law now."
   "Who cares if it is legal, Preben?" complained Troop.
   "What good is a weapon if it will lie in the ship\'s locker all the time? I say that we buy things that we can use: SMG\'s, Assault-rifles, Pistols, Shotguns and a laser or two. And we better forget about all the expensive stuff before we have got all other supplies."
   "Expensive? The gauss rifle is expensive?" Troop turned to the clerk "How much is it?"
   "3500, excluding ammunition."
   "I think you are right, Preben...How about you Zod?"
   "I want an SMG. Just a standard SMG with a silencer, " Zod said
   "I think that this is the weapon for you then: The Interstellarms M19E, "
   Zod interrupted her "and I want an bayonet on it, and a flamehider, and anelectronic sight and a goldplaque with my name on it."
   "I think that we can fix everything except the bayonet... An SMG is too short to put a bayonet on." she answered hesitantly.
   "Put the bayonet on the silencer, that will make it long enough! How soon can you have it ready and how much will it cost?"
   "It will be ready tomorrow, and it will cost, lets see, one M19E at 750..."
   "You\'ll have to get that SMG of your\'s later Zod. We have to get moving this evening!" Preben declared.
   "We can rush the job if you want to," the clerk hurriedly said, "but that will, of course, cost more."
   Zod sighed "Do it, I\'ll pay!" as Preben gave the clerk a list with all that they wanted and number of the ship to which it should be delivered.

   "The admiral will see you now." the marine guard told Werner and Roshel who were waiting in the outer office of admiral Annelina Lashiir, commander of the Pixie Naval Base.
   When he entered the office, Werner noted that the guards that had escorted them here from the office of the chief of domestic affairs stayed behind in the outer office.
   The admiral\'s office was large and airy. The entire wall behind the admiral seemed to open up towards Pixies airless surface and Eldritch starport. Werner couldn\'t see any trace of a window, so he assumed that it was a hologram, even though he discovered that he could pick out \'Gamla Bettan\' among all the ships in the port. The other walls were covered with various projections of maps and diagrams, the majority of which blanked out as the admiral pressed a button when they came in.   The admiral was in her fifties and her hair was beginning to turn grey, but as a former Major himself, Werner recognized the hard look in her eyes and guessed that she had been base commander during the fifth frontier war. The war in which the Zhodani 1st fleet had stood at Efate and the Vargrs had held the trailward part of the subsector as far as Beck\'s World. And Pixie had been right in the middle of it.   Admiral Lashiir greeted them as they sat down in from of the large plasteel desk, and expressed her amazement to see Lieutenant Commander von Tjaikovskij so soon after he had mustered out.   "Do you regret breaking the family tradition already?" she asked jokingly.   "To put it totally frankly, Admiral, I honestly don\'t know yet." Roshel answered, once more doubting that he had done the right thing.   "I was quite surprised when you left the navy, and even more so when security told me that you and another person were walking around the base and asking sensitive questions today!"   "Well now, we weren\'t exactly walking around, as you so bluntly put it, Admiral. We were only making a slight query about the whereabouts of a certainperson, when those marines barged in and took us here."   "And why, if I may ask, did you make this \'slight query\'?"   Roshel though furiously for two seconds, then he passed the hot potato on to Werner." I think that this gentleman, Major Schmallhaussen of the Roupian State Security may answer that question more completely and clearly than I am able to."   Werner had been feeling less than well all morning after getting the stomach-pumping in the medibooth, and having visibly suspicious admirals glaring at him and demanding answers didn\'t exactly make him feel better. "We are contracted to find a person."   "So your interest in the matter is the money, but what is the interest of the person that pays you?"   "Ok, lets be frank with each other. There is no need to beat around thebush," And as the horrified von Tjaikovskij looked at Werner, "There is a personnamed Kiiara Travernier that probably is a Lieutenant in the Imperial Marines. Now, suddenly, she has disappeared from every database as if she never existed.We were trying to get some information from your chief of domestic affairs that would lead us to her."   "And I say the same as Commander Underhill said to you before, Any person with the name Kiiara Travernier, or matching the finger, retinal or gene patterns that you showed to him has never existed in the IMC, or the IN either for that matter, we have never heard about her and we have no idea where she is now."   "If no connections exists between Kiiara Travernier and the Imperial Marine Corps, then why did four armed marine guards take us here? Surely an Admiral must have much more important things to do than repeat what her subordinates already have told us..."   "I cannot answer that question." the admiral answered sternly, "And I must ask: Who is your employer and what is your employer\'s purpose with seeking this Travernier?"   "If \'this Travernier\' don\'t have any connection with the marines, why do you ask?"   Roshel groaned softly "Now you\'ve done it!"   "Do you realize that you can be held here on the base until you provide the answers?"   "I am afraid that I cannot disclose the name of our employer, but I think that I can give you the big picture. We have been hired by a lawyer, "   "Werner! I got the distinct impression that we weren\'t supposed to tell anyone about it!" Roshel hissed.   "Don\'t worry, This don\'t count! As I said, We have been hired by a lawyer to find Kiiara Travernier. The reason behind it is that the mother of Kiiara Travernier recently died, and her father is currently hospitalized for a chronic malady that requires quite expensive treatment. A court of law on Reginahas frozen the family assets since it cannot be determined if Kiiara is aliveor dead, and the money for the treatment is rapidly running out..."   It was a long time before Admiral Lashiir spoke again. She stared intensely on something on a screen in the desk, then she turned the chair around and looked out over the pads and drydocks on the surface for several minutes, and then she began to write something on a piece of official navy stationary.   "I am really sorry, but there is nothing I can do. Even I don\'t know exactly what is going on." She gave the paper to Werner. "Give this paper to the representative of the Imperium on the world where this Travernier\'s fatheris hospitalized. It is an order that says that his illness is caused of woundsreceived while on active duty in the navy. That will make him eligible for the veterans medicare program. Since the marines attached to the base is under myjurisdiction I can do this. Regarding this Kiiara Travernier, I can only repeatthat the IMC have never heard of her..." she hesitated and added "But tell herfather that whatever it was, it was for The Imperium!"
   "What was that about family tradition you talked about?" Werner asked von Tjaikovskij on the way back to the starport.   "Oh that, Well you know, I\'m not really a baron, contrary to what most people claim. It is my brother who is the holder of the patent of nobility. And throughout the history of the von Tjaikovskij family it has been assumed that the children that didn\'t get the patent signed up in the Imperial Navy. There they have worked hard, fought for the glory of Emperor and Empire, done well, climbed in the ranks quickly and been decorated...posthumously..."   "Uh oh!"   "I am the second von Tjaikovskij that have survived to muster out."   "Who were the other one?"   "We don\'t talk about him in the family! He got a dishonourable discharge for reasons that I don\'t want to elaborate on."   "So, what are you going to do now, after you have survived the navy?"   "I don\'t know. Family tradition don\'t give me any clues!"

   "So she admitted underhand that this Tracy, sorry, Kiiara had been in the marines?" asked Preben as they got back.
   "Yes, definitely. But it appears to be some major hush-hush going on that even the admiral isn\'t in on. I got the impression that hadn\'t I been a major and hadn\'t Roshel been a noble, and a lieutenant commander in the navy, and recently mustered out from this base, and hadn\'t we had a good story with human interest, she would never had let slip so much as she did."   "Yes, where did you learn to modify the truth to so good an effect?" Roshel asked him.   "State Security. Remember? One get quite a good knowledge about human nature there, and old warriors tend to become sentimental. But if she, who knew you, Roshel, didn\'t tell us more than this, I suspect that it will be a real pain to get any more information."   "There is a possibility." Troop had been looking at the holo of the lieutenants, "If this holo was taken here at Pixie, somebody must know who the other persons on it is. And they are bound to know who Kiiara is, and some one might be inclined to talk. Zod, do you think that you could try to find out the names of the other persons on the holo?"   "I can try. But I won\'t guarantee anything." Zod didn\'t sound too hopeful.   "I have been talking to tower. There\'s a vacant launch-window coming up in six hours. I\'d like to be able to use it, because after that the schedule is full for several hours more. So I suggest that everybody that have to buy equipment do so now." Preben continued "I\'m going to the port authority to file a flightplan and sign us up for the window."   "Flightplan where?" asked Troop "I don\'t remember discussing where we are going now!"   Werner spoke up "I suggest Boughene. Sohn said that he would stay there for a week on his way back to Regina and that Chubhelm type lives there. And he\'s the only lead that we have now."   "Boughene is my choice also. It has a scout base where we can get refined for free." answered Preben. "Do you mind staying onboard, Troop? Someone has tobe here to receive the supplies when they arrive."   "Nope, that\'s OK with me."   "Hold the fort marine, Don\'t let any Zho\'s aboard!" Zod told him and were rewarded with a thrown cup that clattered against the bulkhead behind him.   Two hours later everything had been delivered to the \'Gamla Bettan\' and Troop was beginning to feel bored. He began to play with the ships sensors and spent some time looking at the heavy traffic above Eldrich Starport. When he got bored with that too, he went aft to the freezer to get a beer.   Even though the ship was empty except for him, it was not quiet. The air-purifiers hissed as they pumped the newly scrubbed and oxygenized air into all parts of the ship. The hull snapped and creaked slightly as the changing sunlight upon it created thermal tensions in it. From the commo panel on the bridge, there came occasional bursts of static and voices as it caught bits and pieces of conversations, some held hours ago in completely different parts of the Pixie system. The cooling system of the ships main computer hummed slightly and penetrating it all were the deep, almost infrasonic, rumble from a powerplant on sustenance-level.   Troop didn\'t hear any of this as he opened the freezer and discovered that there were no beer in it. He had been on ships for so many years that he was used to all the sounds a ship can make. So when he realized that he actually heard something it caught his attention.   At first he wasn\'t sure of what exactly it was or where it came from. But after a few minutes he had pinpointed it to an internal communications console.>From this console there came a faint scraping and creaking sound. When he saw that the console had a line open to the engine room, he began to feel uneasy. And when he discovered that the visual link to the engineroom also were open, even though the screen was pitch black the uneasiness turned to worry.   A quick check on the appropriate panel told him that somehow, both the primary and secondary illumination was broken, and the scraping noise from the engineroom just went on.   Troop began to weigh the alternatives. Something was definitely going on in the engineroom, and that was the second most vulnerable place on the ship, after the main computer. If he investigated immediately he would be alone. If he waited for Preben and the others it might be too late. Being the marine that he were, and being in the mood to kick some ass because of the lack of beer, he decided to act.   The effects of laser or automatic weapons in the engineroom of a ship is severe so Troop went to his cabin to fetch his service magnum. He put on a flak jacket and a pair of light intensifying goggles and loaded the revolver with \'shipboard\' ammunition. Ammunition specially designed to inflict high damage, but not penetrate far.   Behind the valve to the engineroom darkness reigned. Darkness pierced by occasional statuslights that caused the goggles to locally overload and show the lights as luminous rings on the green-black picture. In the middle of theengineroom the jumpdrive lurked outlined in the slight glow from reflected lights, tangled in heavy powerfeeds, fuelpipes and databuses. To both sides Troop could perceive the twin manueverdrive transformers that took their power from the fusionplant downstairs and fed it to the thrusterplates aft.   Troop silently entered, gun held ready, and closed the valve behind him. He pressed the lightswitch, but the panels in the roof remained dark. The scratching noise had stopped when he entered and only the normal noises were heard in the engineroom.   A movement over the jumpdrive caught his eye and he responded with two slugs from his magnum. The reports were reflected in the metal walls and deafened him, but he saw the shower of sparks as his shots tore lose one of the lighting panels.   "Oh Shit!" he exclaimed when he thought of what Preben would say about the damage, *any* damage to his precious ship, and noticed that he couldn\'t hear his own voice. He didn\'t hear the impact of six legs upon the floor plating either, or that they, and their owner, began to run towards him.   Troop turned to look at the rest of the room and when he saw something move he fired again. The shot hit the creature and it was thrown into a corner. It tried to move, but Troop followed up with the rest of the rounds in the revolver.

   "Aside from the wiring to the lightingpanels, it hadn\'t chewed on anything else." Zod explained to Doctor Ushkarun, Surgeon on the Pixie Naval Base, formerly on the \'Monsoon\' and hobby xenobiologist since many years.   Doctor Ushkarun prodded the lose collection of spidery legs and pieces of carapace with a metal rod.   "Let me guess, Your friend\'s ship is not a trader of any sort, is it?"   "Yeah, How did you know?"   "Because if it had been trader, he would have recognized a handspider."    "A what?"   "Handspider, They are really quite harmless but they have a few quirks that have made them infamous among merchants. They eat almost anything, but they are particular to electrical insulation. If they are scared they tend to grab hold of something and not let go. If they don\'t want to let go you\'ll have to cut them apart to get them away from whatever they have attached themselves to.Since they can stand vacuum for some time, probably a month or so, this have lead to their rapid spreading throughout the subsector."
   "How come?"
   "They grab hold to landing gears or other parts of ships with all six legs and tail and get a free passage to a new world. I even got some here," Doctor Ushkarun took a big cage and put it on his desk.    The cage held three handspiders, and Zod saw that the name was appropriate, since they looked like skeletal hands with foot long fingers as legs, and a long segmented tail as the arm. Doctor Ushkarun rattled the cage and the spiders within scrambled around like mad "I was trying to find a fast method of getting rid of them from navy ships, but they seem to be hard against anything."   "Where do they come from?"   "Nobody knows for sure, or nobody cares. There exists thousands of species in the Imperium that is spread over several worlds but nobody knows where they originated. Those handspiders seems to be a quite new addition to the group of animals that live on and around spaceships and spaceports, but I guess that they will prosper."   Zod got an idea "Say doc, you don\'t need all those handspiders you have there, do you?"

    'body' => 'STRIKER TO MEGATRAVELLER

As all the old-timers and most of the new people probably know, sections of the original Traveller miniatures rule set "Striker" were lifted and incor-porated wholesale into MegaTraveller.  Unfortunately, as we also all know, the MegaTraveller rules were not very well proofread, and we are left with a number of omissions and systematic errors resulting from the transfer,both small and large.  Probably the single most important, from a militarytechnology sense, was the total loss of tactical missile rules, a subject which I intend to cover in a conversion article in the near future (while I\'mstill in the mood).  However, for the benefit of the morbidly curious, Ihave covered a few of the missing bits below.  Before I get to that, however,I have a question:  Why?  What good did it do to put all of that stuff inMegaTraveller?  As a wargamer, I liked the Striker concept: a set of integratedrules and design systems to allow simulation of military action across the range of Imperial technology.  As a role-player, much of the material includedin MT is superfluous: The mercenary campaign is nowhere near as appealling tome as the merchant campaign, and the way to deal with tanks is the same asthe way to deal with 50000ton cruisers--don\'t get involved.  I don\'t havemany players that are seriously interested in the differences between aTL5 and a TL7 16cm howitzer.  Also, as far as I can tell, the only good thingabout the TL17+ equipment in the book is that you can point to it when a player says "Why can\'t I" to show him what tech level would be required to dowhat he wants. Enough philosophy.  The material is there--let\'s deal with it.

POINT DEFENSE

One of the Striker artifacts left in the MT rules is the Point Defensetargetting system.

Basically, a point defense weapon could do one of three things: Shoot attargets (like anything else), shoot at direct fire weapons like missiles,as long as they were visible for long enough to track (the PD weapon had tobe able to see the last 150m of the trajectory, and you could support othervehicles as well as your own), and shoot at incoming indirect fire. A tech9 PD system gets 4 dice against indirect fire, plus two dice for each tech level higher, so that TL10 gets 6, TLll gets 8 and so on.  These dice aremodified by individual DMs of plus or minus the difference in tech levels.Zero is the minimum.  Thus, if your TL14 artillery fired at my TL9 PD system,I\'d roll 4 dice (at -5 each, meaning that only 6s would knock down a projectile.)  If my TL9 artillery fired back, your TL14 PD system would roll14 dice (+5 each) for an average of 119 projectiles destroyed.  Multiplerocket launchers, which shoot everything at once, have an advantage againstPD systems due to overload--divide the hits by two. So, in the example givenabove, you would knock down an average of 60 rockets, rather than 119.

Nothing to it...but they didn\'t bother putting it in MT, even though they leftin the PD fire control systems. 

My additional recommendation would be to allow weapons with PD fire control to fire at moving targets with no movement penalty, since they are designedto destroy fast moving targets.  I\'d also limit the number of indirect firerounds that can be destroyed to the rate of fire of the weapon, which putsa premium on things like rapid pulse plasma guns.  A third recommendationwould be to not permit anti-indirect fire with a PD projectile gun.  You stillmight want PD fire control for a projectile weapon because of recommendationone, however.

ROCKET LAUNCHERS
Left out of MT were the Striker rocket rules.

>From Striker:     
<suggested MT translations and modifications below>

Design Sequence 4: Multiple Rocket Launchers

Multiple rocket launchers (MRLs) are available at tech level  6+; they  are constructed using the CPR gun design system, using  the same characteristics as mortars with the following exceptions.

A.  Launcher:  A single launcher consists of a number  of  launch tubes, plus fire control and carriage.     1. Crew: A launcher\'s crew is the normal crew for that  size weapon, times the number of tubes in the launcher, divided by  10 (but never less than 2).  All crew except the gunner are required only  for reloading; if the weapon is to be used only  once,  the rest of the crew may be dispensed with.     2. Weight: Each tube has a weight multiple of 0.01     3. Volume: The volume of a tube is its weight times 25.     4. Price: Each tube has a price multiplier of 0.5  <0.05???>     5.  Indirect Fire Range: There are three types  of  rockets: short  range,  medium  range and long range.   Their  ranges  are determined  on the CPR gun tale, using the mortar, howitzer,  and gun  columns, respectively.  Range is modified by the tech  level of  the rocket or the fire control, whichever is lower.  At  tech level  6, count up two rows.  At tech level 7, count up one  row. Count down one row for each tech level over 8.     6.  The rate of fire of a launcher is equal to the number of tubes.
B.  Ammunition:  Rockets  are designed in the  same  way  as  CPR rounds.   They are identical to mortar rounds with the  following exceptions.     1. Weight: Rockets weight twice as much as listed.
     2.  Volume: A rocket\'s volume is equal to its weight  in  kg divided by 500.  <in kl>
     3.  Short range rockets have a base price multiplier  of  4, meidum  range rockets have a multiplier of 8, long range  rockets have a multiplier of 12.     4. The RAP option is not available for rockets.C.  Remote MRLs: Properly equipped launchers may be fired from  a istance by communicator signal.  Both the gunner and the launch-er must possess communication equipment and must be in communica-ion.  In addition, the launcher must include control  equipment, which  costs  Cr1000 and weighs 15kg; the gunner must  also  have control  equipment, which costs Cr1000 and weighs 1kg.  A  single gunner may control any number of launchers, but may fire only one mission at a time.  Only one fire control system is necessary per gunner.

OK.   Those  are  the actual rules as laid out  in  Striker.   To convert  to  MegaTraveller, I\'m going to key all  the  price  and weight multiplier to the Mortar table.

Weight: Each tube weighs 1/25 (.04) times the weight of a  mortar of  the  same diameter. 
Cost: Each tube costs .5 times the price of a mortar of the  same size.  
Range:  Ignore  the range shifts.  The original  table  had  four times  as  many entries, so it only has an effect if you  have  a TL12+  system  (in which case you would shift down 1, so  that  a 12cm  short  range rocket would have a range of 8km  rather  than 7km).
Cost  of Ammunition: Any reasonable warhead should be  available, and  the cost would be 4/3 the mortar cost for short  range,  8/3 for medium range and 4 times for long range.

DISPOSABLE ROCKET LAUNCHERS, GRENADE LAUNCHERS, AND OTHER INFANTRY
HEAVY WEAPONS

Combat factors for all of these weapons are given in Book 1, but costs andweights are nowhere to be found.  I could type up the list from Striker andpost it, if anyone is interested.  I think it would be much more likely thata character might have access to a rocket launcher than to a 16cm howitzer,so if one set of data was to be left out, I\'d rather see it be the howitzerset.  Better to include both, of course, but I mentioned the proofreading
before...

ARTILLERY SET-UP TIME

Set-up  times for artillery in MegaTraveller would agree  closely with  Striker if they were in thirty second combat turns  instead of seconds.

MASS DRIVER GUNS

There is a major error in the translation of mass driver guns from Striker intoMegaTraveller.  The same calculations are used to figure rate of fire, but inStriker, it\'s rate of fire *per second*, and in MT, it\'s ROF *per minute*.  Ithink the former is correct, and a multiplier factor of 60 should be noted in the margin of the book.  There is one design in 101 Vehicles using an MD gun.To be consistent, its ROF should be multiplied by 60.

SMOKE AND ANTI-LASER AEROSOLS

In Striker, dense smoke and anti-laser aerosols degraded laser performance forlaser of TL8-12.  TL13+ X-Ray lasers ignore these rules.  A unit/vehicle indense smoke or aerosol cloud may not be communicated with by laser, may notbe targetted by a laser designator, and gain an armor factor versus laserweapons as follows:

Dense Smoke 25 vs TL7-8, 20 vs TL9-12Anti-Laser Aerosol 50 vs TL7-8, 45 vs TL9-12Prismatic Aerosol 80 vs TL7-12

It\'s not clear in the original how this was supposed to work in combinationwith a vehicles armor.  Armor factors are not stricly additive.  The annoyinglytechnical solution would be to find the weight multipliers for the two armorvalues (say 20 for the tank +25 for the smoke, 5.95 and 9.17 respectively),add them together (15.12) and find the armor value corresponding to that,rounding excess down (30, in this case).  The quick and dirty solution wouldbe to use the higher of the two.

A canister provides 4 turns (2 minutes in Striker) of coverage to a stationaryobject, and 1 turn to a moving object.  Those laser sensors that are notdescribed in the vehicle design system can automatically trigger a canisterif a beam is sensed.  Laser sensors detected a beam on an 8+ (2d6) at TL8,7+ at TL9, and so forth down to 2+ and TL14+.
Since these canisters are small and cheap, and pretty effective against TL12-lasers, it should be noted that my military vehicle designs at those tech llevels which rely on laser armament alone are probably less effective than I had considered when I did them.

RADAR

While I generally like the composite Active EMS system in MT, for certain applications not requiring great robustness, or requiring low cost, it wouldbe nice if radar continued to improve beyond TL9.  In Striker, Radar tablesfor up to TL13 are included, and could be used directly in MT.  Also, radarsof intermediate ranges (other than 5*10^n) are included, and would occasionallybe useful.
That\'s it for right now.

I can\'t speak authoritatively for Scott, but it is probably a typographicalerror.  However, I do know that the "displacement" values for aircraft areroughly equal to the volume of a rectangular box touching the wingtips, nose,and tail.  So that "displacement" contains a lot of empty space.  A surfaceship, on the other hand, can get up to 13.5 tons of water displacement (minusthe amount needed for stability) per ton of standard (liquid hydrogen)displacement.

Well, the design looked pretty good to me, given the assumptions you have madeabout fuelling.  Personally, though, I don\'t see any reason why you can\'t refuel a 1,000,000 ton ship by gas giant skimming directly.  We could probablythink of one, but there is no such restriction in the rules. (At least here.)I\'ve also always figured that starports\' orbital facilities refuel vesselswith whatever sort of hoses it would take to transport liquid hydrogen, ratherthan with shuttle runs.

Courser class Surface Warship TL9

     The Courser is a typical TL9 purpose built warship.  By this tech level the surface warship is obsolescent, but there is no easy substitute when there is a requirement to provide continuous escort to other surface vessels.  The Courser is equipped with a wide variety of active and passive electronic detection and countermeasure gear, including the lightweight composite hull which has an inherently low radar reflectance.  The communications gear includes two high power tightbeam communicators, suitable for communication with orbiting spacecraft or geosynchronous comm relay satellites. The ves-sel\'s main armament consists of three multiple missile vertical launch sys-tems--two fifty tube light missile systems fore and aft, and a thirty tube heavy missile system amidships.  Statistics for heavy SAMs are shown below, but any 5000kg missile designed to approximately the same shape can be fit-ted.  Four 20mm six barrel autocannons and a 20MW pulse laser are carried for point defense.  Anti-laser aerosol dispensers (not shown below) are also fitted, and it was considered prudent to have a point defense system that would not be impaired by the ship\'s own passive defenses.
     The ship\'s appearance would be rather startling to someone accustomed to lower TL warships--there is no large superstructure, and the only visible weapons are the cannon in their low, rounded turrets.  Extensive computer control has reduced the crew to a mere 50 men, enough to provide three full shifts of operators.  Damage control is adversely affected by this, but this is considered to be acceptable.

Seagull Maritime Support Helicopter TL9

     The Seagull is equipped as a general purpose maritime support helicop-ter, and could be used from a shore base or a fairly small water vessel.  Submersible warcraft are still a threat on balkanized worlds at TL9, and starships engaged in illegal activities frequently resort to hiding under-water, so the Seagull is equipped with magnetic and sonar sensors for sub-merged search.  The bomb bay (which doubles as a cargo bay as required) would ordinarily be used to carry one or two homing torpedoes.  A four seat passen-ger section is carried for liaison work.  Four light hardpoints are provided which can be used to carry light depth charges or air to surface ordnance for use in low threat areas. The rotors fold for ease of shipboard storage.

Lucas,
I keep a limited number of recent TML biweeklies on hand.  The *real*archives are organized into 45Kbyte "archive bundles".  If you\'d like avery long index of the archive bundles (about five 45K messages), youcan ask for it and then you will know which archive bundles you need.
Or, I see you\'ve been a member since 11-Feb-91.  Would you like me tosend you all TML traffic bundles generated between 11-Feb-91 and17-Apr-91? By perusing the bundle index, I see that these are bundles170-184, hence they represent 15 bundles, each 45Kbytes in size.
Let me know if you want to pursue one of these options.  If so, pleaseelide the Cc: of traveller in your reply.

Remarks: The 67 square meter solar panel is deployed in aretractable array in emergency and supplies only sufficient powerfor an emergency beacon and life support for one stateroom. Thegrav unit is normally used for attitude control when docking with ajump tender, but in an extreme emergency can be used formanuvering. The extreme low acceleration requires that the pilot gointo a low berth for the duration of any such trip, but the solarpanel is sufficient to keep the computers, low berth, grav unit andemergency beacon going during an interplanetary trip should the X-Boat misjump. (Provided there is a suitable source of stellarradiation.)

Some reference is made to other unnoted worlds, such as thebalkanized planet Tirem, which has four main governments, one of which is theOffworld Coalition, which controls all of the activities in the system away from the main world.  ConTech is my all-purpose sector-wide macro-corporation,which builds ships, maintains mercenary battalions, and so forth.  LSP is themajority stockholder, but they find it advantageous to allow a certain amountof autonomy. SIE is Stewart Interstellar Enterprises, a struggling merchantshipping company with interests in Glisten, Lunion and District 268. (It\'sbasically the GM\'s alter-ego.)  References to the Imperial Navy in the Glistensubsector are virtually synonomous with the Imperial Glisten Navy, a planetaryand subsector navy which provides nearly all of the actual strength of the 1100th Reserve Fleet.  IGN ships are built at TL15, but usually with a lowerjump capability than first line Imperial Navy standard ships.  In my game,because I wanted to use the IGN that I had put so much work into, and becauseI started working this out before the full course of the Fifth Frontier Warwas known, the industrial planets of District 268, Collace and Forine, engagedin a bid for permanent independence as part of the Outworld Coalition, andoccupied the attention of the IGN during the first six or so months of thewar.  Ships of the Collace Liberation Fleet have been posted previously aspart of my vehicle design packages.

I have also generally assumed that the material from Beltstrike, Tarsus,Leviathan, and Safari Ship can be fitted in with little or no change.  Tarsus,for example, was occupied by Collace forces during the early part of the war,but this occupation consisted primarily of ships, so there was little impacton the planet.  The Bowman system was not attacked, though they may have beentroubled (like many other systems) with some of the swarms of small commerceraiders built by Forine.

If anybody is *really* interested, I have planetary maps of one sort or anotherfor Overnale, Windsor, Caledonia, Tirem, Aki, New Rome, and Crout.  Most are done in colored pencil and would be dificult to reproduce short of colorxeroxing.  My local copy shop does color xerox, at about $1.75 a shot.  If youare interested in any of these, arrange something with me by private email.You can have them at cost, but I can\'t afford to send out bundles of them forfree.  A number of these maps predate World Builders Handbook, Grand Census,and Grand Survey, which makes them a little dull.  I like the map drawing guidelines from those books. (-8

I hope you find this of some use...

WEISS   A626464-B

     Population about 72,000.  Colonized following the Third  Frontier War  in  990 by a group of Sword Worlds dissidents.   Recent  problems have stemmed from the fact that the inhabitants have more sympathy for the Sword Worlds their ancestors left than for the Imperium.   Glisten pre-emptively  assumed control of the planet in 1104, and tension  has remained high since.  The local language is a form of Germanic  rather than Anglic, and persons addressing the inhabitants in Anglic  outside the  controlled  spaceport district are likely to find  trouble.   The planet  itself  is fairly unpleasant, with most  of  the  hydrographic percentage  tied up in the two large icecaps.  Individual  settlements outside the spaceport tend to cluster around a pressurized greenhouse.  Most surface travel is by tracked vehicle.

NEW ROME  B837866-B

     Population:  725 million.  New Rome has been occupied since  pre-Imperial  times,  at least according to local  tradition.   The  truth cannot  be proven, but in fact the planet was settled by Solomani  via Darrian  (by a splinter group having some political dispute  with  the majority.)  In recent years the planet has generally been self-suffic-ient,  and an Imperial Navy base was established in 826.  In 1042  the planet  was divided into six nations corresponding to the current  ad-ministrative districts.  A major war broke out over control of  seabed mineral deposits north of the Latium continent, and the Imperial  Navy was forced to intervene to protect the base.  The regional populations are too strongly differentiated to combine successfully in a planetary government, and the current administration by Glisten MinCol is  still officially  termed "interim".  The New Rome Peacekeeping Force is  the only  authorized planetary armed service, and was set up as an  inter-national  organization in a deliberate attempt to provide contact  be-tween  countries and thereby ease tensions.  The results to date  have been disappointing, and low level violence and subversion remain prob-lems.  The extranational ConTech enclave was formed primarily to  pro-tect  the commercial starport, and its existence remains a sore  point with nationalist activists.MELIOR D140466-7     Melior is a long-term terraforming project, being administered by the MinCol branch office on Egypt.  Large quantities of ice  asteroids are being diverted and used to bombard the planet.  Thier impacts have all  been  precalculated to avoid inhabited areas, but  mistakes  have occurred  and  MinCol takes no responsibility for ships  landing  away from   the   scientific  outpost.   There  are  no  exports   of   any significance.  This phase of the terraforming project is scheduled  to be  completed in 1150, and has been underway since 1090.  MinCol  will contract for pusher ships on a freelance basis.ROMAR B450456-8     The  Imperial  Navy base provides the livelihood for  the  entire population   of  this  unpleasant  little  planet.   About  half   the population  are dependents of Navy personnel, and the other  half  are engaged  in  service activities catering to Navy, Scout  and  Merchant personnel.   Most  food is imported, and food prices  are  quite  high outside the subsidized Navy commissary.     No significant exports.FFUDN  A41489D-C     Population:943,000,000     Tech Level in 1105: 8     The planetary government concluded a treaty with Glisten in  1109 for  major  technological assistance in return for a monopoly  on  the export  of radioactives.  The colony was founded from Glisten  in  726 when  exploitable quantities of superheavy elements  were  discovered.  The  current bureacratic administration is a direct descendent of  the Glisten  MinCol Department which was responsible for the planet  prior to  the declaration of independence in 877.  In the early  900\'s,  the population  was  almost completely converted to Khargin, a  stoic  and introspective  religion  of Vilani origin.  The  population  increased drastically  and  the  technological level fell off  as  more  of  the planet\'s  resources  were turned to maintaining subsistence.   By  the time  the treaty was signed in 1108, the tech level had fallen  to  8, and  the exploitation of the resources that were the colony\'s  initial purpose  had  long since ceased.  At present,  offworld  visitors  are restricted  to  the vicinity of the starport, and  the  population  is closely controlled because of the scarcity of resources.     Imports of food are duty free, and generally can be sold for  10-30% over the expected value.  (20-40% if the trader is willing to take payment  in barter).  Exports are radioactives (restricted to  holders of Glisten MinTrade licenses) and heavy metals.WURZBURG  C795300-A     The scout base here is orbital.  The entire planetary  population is  transient,  hirelings of the ConTech military  training  facility.  The  planetary flora and fauna are toxic to humans, and  all  previous attempts at colonization have failed when crops were overrun by  local pests.    The  problem  is  not  insoluble,  but  the   economics   of terraforming  have  not been favorable up to now.   ConTech  has  been using the planet as a training ground for mercenaries since 1072,  and their facility is available for a reasonable fee.BENDOR  A756656-C     Bendor  is about as nice a place as you can imagine.  Except  for the  thin  atmosphere,  the  planet  is  extremely  earth-like.    The population is small, and the Count likes it that way.  No  immigration is  permitted,  but  visitors  are  welcome.   Much  of  the  planet\'s agricultural  activity  is  automated,  with  robotics  mostly   being imported from Glisten.  Bendor is a favorite vacation spot in the  the region,  and  hotels  are very common in a variety  of  settings  from mountains to shore and from temperate to tropical.  Since it is  ruled directly by an Imperial noble, cooperation with the Navy base is good, and  there is little friction.  Unusual exports include  karakka  nuts (native  to  the  planet  and  impossible  to  cultivate  in  quantity elsewhere),  a  variety of perfumes, and a number of  excellent  wines with  a  lot  of snob appeal.  These latter can be  found  for  export occasionally (Formidable, Trader, 1 day, success produces 3d6  bottles at 2d6*50 credits each).TSARINA  D120636-5     Colonized in 697 from Glisten for exploitation of platinum  group metals.  The ownership of the mining company came to be controlled  by three  families  by  726, and has remained so since.   The  colony  is totally dependent on imports of food and equipment--equipment of up to TL9  is  used, but there is no repair capability.   The  situation  is becoming unstable at present as Glisten social activists are  engaging in   a  propoganda  campaign  among  the  mineworkers.   The   workers themselves  suffer from prolonged breeding among too small a  breeding stock, and have an substantially subnormal average IQ.  They are  also extremely  superstitious,  and view the three families  as  ruling  by divine  right,  which  has led to limited success  thus  far  for  the Glisten  social  activists.  "Stupid as a Tsarina miner" is  a  common turn of phrase in the subsector.     Imports: Food, Parts, Heavy Equipment     Exports: Platinum group metals     Restrictions:  Books, tapes, and other data media  are  severely restricted, with import duties for approved items starting at 400%  of base value and going up.CROUT  E4359CA-7     Population:3.7 billion     Crout is very overpopulated for its size and current tech  level.  In addition, the outlook of its inhabitants borders on the xenophobic.  All  of  this leads to a very high-pressure  and  unstable  situation.  Many  starship  captains would be reluctant to land here even  if  the port  facilities  were  better  because  of  the  resentment  of   the inhabitants toward anyone perceived as being better off.     The  current  planetary administration has been  in  power  since 1031,  and  is based on the annual election of four co-rulers  from  a very  limited  pool  of  candidates.   While  public  opinion  remains supportive  of  the  regime, sociological analysts  predict  that  the repressive  measures  recently enacted will precipitate  a  civil  war within ten to fifteen years.     Crout is very technologically backwards; the only area of unusual expertise is in environmental control--greenhouses supply all food and most  of the breathing air.  Recycle of biomass provides  methane  for supplentary  heating and power.  There is a very strong cultural  bias toward  self-sufficiency,  so that each family should  be  capable  of growing its own food, repairing its own house, and so on.  Communities tend to center around glassworks, with self-sufficiency in this  vital area being judged on the community level.FLEXOS  E5A1422-6     The  atmosphere of this planet is carbon dioxide/nitrogen,  which allows   basic  plants  to  be  used  as  atmosphere   converters   in greenhouses.  The inhabitants are all descendents of the 14 passengers and  crewmembers of a starship which misjumped about 650, and was  not discovered  for  approximately  80 years.   Extensive  inbreeding  has caused  a good deal of genetic drift/damage.  The current  inhabitants are  all very uniform in appearance, bald, albino, and  six  fingered.  They  have little desire to breed outside the group (and vice  versa!) and  the  population  is  declining.   The  ship  is  still  partially functional at the core of the inhabited area.
BINGES A800231-A

     Binges  was  colonized  from  Glisten  in  1057  by  a  group  of speculators hoping to build the starport and cash in.  However,  their analysis  of  traffic in the region was faulty, and the port  has  not prospered.  The planet has the dubious distinction in recent years  of being a flag-of-convenience homeport to a large number of disreputable free  traders.   (Larger companies are not free enough  from  Imperial restrictions to avail themselves of this service.)     During the Fifth Frontier War, the starport was opened to Collace fleets,  which nearly caused annexation of the planet after  the  war.  However,  the owners of the port successfully appealed their  case  in the Imperial Court at Trin, arguing that they had little choice in the face  of  overwhelming  force.   Despite  the  outcome  of  the  case, resentment remains high among local Imperial officials at Glisten, and more IGN ships than usual have been passing through the system.
MILLE FALCS  B9A2469-C

    A  typical navy base planet.  The atmosphere is  almost entirely nitrogen, and there is no life except for a few types  of anaerobic bacteria, of interest only to scientists.  As a result the surface is very dusty, and windstorms frequently make landing at  the downside base impossible.  The downside base consists of a number of buried domes. The orbital facility is fairly extensive, and is interconnected with the civilian modules.WINDSOR C783511-9     Population:200,000  (5% independent rancher, 5% independent farmers, 2% independent fishermen, 65% Windsor Agrocorp employees, 23% Akian immigrants)

     Windsor  is  a colony world currently under development,  and  is wholly  owned by the Windsor Agrocorp.  WA is owned by ConTech  (50%), LSP  (30%),  SIE (10%), general public (7%), and the Bank  of  Glisten (3%).   The  Akian immigrant population is tending to cluster  in  the three cities at present, in distinct contrast to the remainder of  the population.  There is some friction between Akians and the others, but it  has remained subdued.  The colonization fee for Windsor is  fairly high (Cr30,000 with discounts available for needed skills), so most of the  immigrants  were at least middle class to start  with.   The  Aki government  has proposed to subsidize emigration to Windsor, but  this proposal received strenuous protests from the WA Board of Directors at the 1110 annual meeting.

SOREL E48569A-1

Population:9.5 million

     A regressed colony originally planted by the Solomani during  the Second Imperium.  The original infrastructure was destroyed by nuclear war during the Long Night, and technology had recovered to TL1 by  the time  of  recontact.  The IISS maintains a  semi-interdiction  of  the planet  at  the  request of the local  rulers.   Imperial  contact  is permitted, but importation of technological items must be approved  by both  the  local rulers and the IISS.  Persistent rumors  of  psionics among the upper classes are "apparently" unfounded.TRANE C639422-B     Mostly  a waterworld-the land is concentrated in  one  continent.  The  population of 70,000 is scattered across this continent in  small holdings.   There is a heavy reliance on orbitial  communications  for the  planetary  datanet.  There is a well developed  medical  response system, paid for by subscription of over 95% of the population.  It is considered good manners when on Trane to offer a contribution for  the med  service.  The primary exports are exotic organics harvested  from the local fauna.  Water travel is primarily by submersible due to  the magnitude  of  inclement weather which can be experienced  with  large unbroken expanses of water.CENTRY E222447-6     An  abandoned mining colony.  The remaining inhabitants  live  in the abandoned company buildings, hunt the upland forests, and come  to town  for  parts  to keep their respirators  running.   All  operating vehicles are left over from the mining operations.  There is little or no  contact with other worlds, except for a visit from the  occasional free trader.  Population is about 20,000.LYDIA E110430-6     Population:90,000     TL6  is  barely sufficient to maintain the colony  domes  in  the trace atmosphere.  Formerly a mining colony founded to exploit massive quantities of silver, it has been on the decline since the silver gave out around 1020.  ConTech closed the starport in 1035, and most of the population  emigrated.   The remainder are expert  garbage  pickers--a fair  amount  of  useful  salvage at  TL12  remains  from  the  mining operation,  enough that free traders occasionally call to pick up  the junk.
CALLIA E150852-6

    Water  is  currency  on this extremely dry  world.   The  original colony  was founded here by a group of religious ascetics around  640.  Very  little trace of the original religion remains  today--the  harsh climate  seemed to breed nothing but a host of prophets.  The  several main groups of nomads are very fierce, and extremely adept at the  use of  primitive weapons.  In the cities, the current religion  is  built around a cannabalistic cult with an emphasis on high fertility.   Both types  of cultures are highly ritualistic, and anyone interested  must study the ritual skill seperately (defaults to Liaison minus 3).   Use the  level of ritual as a positive DM on reactions with natives.   The occasional  outsiders  who venture here are generally  safe  from  the local violence.  The Glisten PARS usually maintains a cutter here  (in orbit)  to  render  any necessary  assistance  in  space  emergencies.  Refueling  capability in the entire system is virtually  non-existent, and  any ship visiting had better have fuel for the return  jump.   If you  try to use water to refuel on the planet, it costs  roughly  10cr per liter.

ASTER C86A410-9

     Aster  is a potentially rich water world, which is  chartered  in its  entirety  to  the Aster Exploitation  Corporation.   Two  shallow seabed  cities  are presently under construction.  The  population  of about 40,000 is almost exclusively employed at this, although a number of scientific teams are scattered around the planet.AKI    B443987-9     Aki was settled from Deneb around 300, and converted to  Aborism, a pervasive religion around 450.  Religion and government remain  sep-arate.   Offworlders  find the planet uncomfortable due to  the  large population, mostly crowded into large cities, and because of the  hos-tile attitude of Aborites to non-members.  This changes rapidly if one converts.  Most cities have large slum areas, and much of the  popula-tion  subsists on church or government doles.  Most imports, with  the exception of foodstuffs, are subject to a 10% import duty.  All normal starship  servicing  fees are doubled, due to a government  effort  to collect Imperial currency to facilitate offworld activities.       General Description of culture: Reactionary-Indifferent, Passive-Neutral,  Harmonious-Aloof,  Aborism:684419  Unusual  Custom:  Parents arrange marriages for children.
Miscellaneous Notes:     Wills--as  a result of a number of lawsuits early in the  history of the planet in which beneficiaries of wills were declared ineligible because they were not on the planet at the time the will was resolved, current law allows two Imperial Standard years from the time of  death to the reading of the will, and this time may not be shortened  unless all  beneficiaries  are present.  In addition, "every effort  must  be made" to ensure that all beneficiaries are notified.     Airline  Rates--Most  cities on Aki are served by  some  sort  of scheduled  air travel. Rates run about Cr0.1/km, with a minimum  price of Cr150.      First Impressions--Housing density is fairly high in most cities, cleanliness  is fairly low.  General clothing design is loose,  colors favored  being black, grey, brown, and subdued reds and greens.   Cer-tain  groups  of rebellious youth dress in tight fitting  clothing  in bright  colors  (blue, purple, red), and wear their hair  very  short.  Cuisine is generally vegetarian due to the scarcity of arable land and ethical  inclination.   Urban windowbox miniature herb gardens  are  a common  sight.   Privately  owned vehicles in  cities  are  small  and scarce.  Large trucks are common for cross country travel.  Mass tran-sit systems are available in most cities, but are often run down.

Airline/Airport Encounters:
   1: Concerned Aborite, attempts to engage in religious discourse
   2: Lost child
   3: Business traveller
   4: Vargr merchant
   5: Army private in dress uniform, on leave, 1d6 in number
   6: Pickpocket, roll again for appearance

BICORNN  E563576-2

     Settled in 390 by a group of Utopian idealists, the planet  pros-pered for 500 years, although it divided into several nations.  Always isolated  from the Imperial mainstream, a war was waged  using  biolo-gical agents in 893, at which time the population was 877-8.  In  less than  a year, 95% of the planetary population died,  and  civilization disappeared.   Virulent diseases (to which the present  population  is immune)  remain active in the biosphere, which ensures that the  world continues  to be isolated.  No exports or travellers from Bicornn  are permitted to land on any other world in the region, and offworld visi-tors are advised to remain in protective suits.

INTHE  C100598-B

     Inthe is a mining colony, fairly prosperous, under the  authority of  the  bureau  for Extra-System affairs  of  the  Tiremese  Offworld Coalition.  All inhabitants are residents of one city, Inthetown,  (or just \'Town\'), and most are Offworld Citizens.  Town is clean, and  the air  smells  normal, which is about all one can hope for  in  such  a place.   The  primary export is copper, along with silver  and  a  few scarcer metals.  Town is self-sufficient in food due to application of space  habitat techniques.  A flotilla of four OC fleet  escorts  (7th Flotilla,  Watson, Egaron, Falmont, Garis) is based here  permanently, and at least one government bulk carrier is usually present.

HOROSHO  C3378A6-A

     Horosho  has  a very high population for its size, most  of  whom live in arcologies.  The current ruler is Admiral Bolton Gannivar, who was voted into power in the planetary general elections in 1103.   The major  thrust  of his foreign policy has been to  acquire  or  sponsor offworld  colonization projects.  Because of the high population  den-sity, personal courtesy is considered by inhabitants to be very impor-tant.  A code duello involving blade combat provides a "safety valve."  No  export  of  food  is permitted.  Offworld  visitors  must  post  a Cr10,000 departure bond before leaving the starport.

     Colonization  Project--The  prime effort has been  a  preliminary survey of Dawnworld in District 268.  Dawnworld has remained  uncolon-ized  to the present due to a cluster of related  ecological  factors.  On a microlevel, most humans experience an allergic reaction to common Dawnworld  pollens.   In addition, in some  regions,  airborne  spores exist that will sprout in human lungs.  Most plants use L-rotary  sug-ars and are nutritionally useless.  the fauna in the planet\'s  current epoch  runs  to dinosaur-like creatures, the largest of which  pose  a threat  to  humans  from sheer size.  In many of  the  smaller  animal niches, cold blooded creatures predominate, allowing for a much higher carnivore  population that would otherwise be the  case.   Perversely, while humans are poisonous to native creatures, they also smell tasty.

CALEDONIA  C541636-5

     Dry.   Population clusters around water.  Colonized in  950,  and currently  strongly  influenced  by  the  various  Tirem  governments.  Emphasis  is  on  self-sufficiency, and trade  centers  on  import  of easily  repaired  and  durable low-tech  gear.   Exports  are  heavily informational, and in 1107, Caledonian folk-music was very popular  on Tirem  and Glisten. Population of 9.1 million about 40% Tiremese,  50% Trinese, and remainder primarily Akian.
     Folk music--most  notorious is the literature for the bladder-pipe, an instrument which arouses a good deal of feeling among both its admirers and its detractors.',

  Practically all surface or air combat takes place at ranges far below \'visual\'distance in space combat (50km, I think it is) with the exception of the variousforms of missile combat. And since the DM at visual range in starship combat is:

  own computer level - enemy computer level - enemy agility 
  It would make perfect sense if the DM at shorter range would be:
  
  (own comp * A)-(enemy comp * B) - enemy agility 
  
  where B probably would be smaller than A, because the weapons used are often speed of light weapons, and the time delay won\'t be large enough to cause problems at those ranges, ie the nonpredictability of the target won\'t be as high. (\'Nonpredictability\'?:)

  Exactly how this should be modified by range is another matter, but I say asI\'ve found that I\'ll say more and more after reading Striker: "When MegaTdon\'t work, try Striker" :)

I\'m under the impression that the Imperial Encyclopedia listing of the worlds of the Spinward Marches is supposed to be from 1120 orso.  Does anyone else think different?

Not that I\'ve noticed, and I usually keep an eye out for news from theGlisten subsector.  There are a couple of possibilities--Marastan hasalways been an Imperial Reserve, so Norris might have decided to declareit off limits until he knows who it belongs to  (-8.  Or, since it is abalkanized, low tech world, they may be engaged in a remake of World War I,which could cut down on tourism.  (-8  Or, since it is at the very edge ofthe Aslan occupied zone, there might be a substantial problem with, uh, illegal immigrants. (-8.  Take your choice.

Well, I like the looks of that in general.  I tend to think that A=2 andB=0 would be reasonable, but I could also see that A=3 and B=1 would give you some reason to have a computer--otherwise your Computer Model 2 oppo-nent is almost certain to hit you every time.  I don\'t think there was a combat benefit in Striker for having a "battle computer" aboard your vehi-cle.  As near as I recall, it was mostly good for ensuring that you could maintain continuous communications with tight beam communicators while on the move (which was important in that game.)

    'body' => 'SOME NOTES ON THE DEAN DESIGN COLLECTION

Since quite a few of my designs have accumulated by this time, I thought I had
better assemble a few comments on the unofficial changes I have made to various
elements of the design systems to allow people to reinterpret them to taste.

These notes include interpretations, changes, presumed errata corrections and
miscellaneous comments, and are keyed to the design system flowchart.

Basic Hull Design:

I generally ignore the ambiguous maximum armor rule from the narrative, for two
reasons- it makes no sense as there is really no limit to how thick a piece
of steel can be, and increasing price and weight cause their own penalties.

On many vehicles I ignore the turret rules if I can fit all my components into
the base volume.  If the hull weight/cost tables were linear instead of
discontinuous, there would be no difference between the cost and weight (the
important factors) of a hull 10 +40% turret and a hull 14.  Power requirements
to move the turret are almost always neglible in the overall design, unless you
have a very large turret on a small vehicle with a tiny power supply--which 
has never come up in a "realistic" design.

Power Supply:

The incredible fuel consumption for fission plants given in the book has been
discussed at some length on the list in the past.  Let it suffice to say that
I usually use the .003 kl/year rule that I suggested, and anyone who disagrees
may apply an appropriate fudge factor to the endurance of any of my fission
designs.  Fuel cells are the best high tech power system for anything up to
about 2 or 3 megawatts.  If you need more, go fusion--small fusion plants are
useless except as technological curiosities. I generally have no problem with
installing more energy consuming devices than the power plant can run at one
time, so long as important limits are noted (e.g. no maneuver drive and energy
weapons at the same time) and all important systems can be powered at the
same time (maneuver and life support at a minimum). There has been discussion
in Traveller\'s Digest and on the list regarding fractional use of power 
plants.  I consider this to be reasonable, and recent designs list endurance
at typical power settings as well as at maximum power.  Fuel usage is 
considered to be proportional to energy output, an assumption which should 
possibly be modified for small vehicles whose lower energy levels are below
the "economy of scale" factors.  Batteries should probably have their control
point requirements ignored, and should also probably be rated in terms of hours
at the expected output requirement.  Thus, if you have 1-MW/hr of batteries,
you could figure a ground vehicles speed either on the basis of 1MW of output
with a 1 hour endurance, or 0.5MW output with a two hour endurance, or some
other reasonable combination.  My feeling is that there would probably be a 
design limit to the speed with which the batteries could be discharged.
Starship power requirements can usually be estimated at the start of a design
by figuring the desired life support (all goodies works out to 1MW per disp
ton), the maneuver drive requirment, and any weapons and shields you want to
be able to use at the same time as the maneuver drive.

Locomotion:

My recent designs have been listed with two sets of statistics for maneuver
drives, one being the straight Maneuver=3 or whatever, and the second being
(Thrusters=3250t) or the like.  Those numbers are calculated on the basis of
one thruster or anti-grav maneuver unit = 650t thrust, which corresponds to
equal energy consumption for anti-grav units.  In this rationalization 
thrusters require more energy to do whatever double talk allows them to operate
beyond gravity wells at full efficiency.  Although I haven\'t done it, my
extrapolation would permit thruster units to be placed in any size craft, so
long as the unit is at least 0.4 "units" large. (5.4kl minimum). For most
player-class craft, these rules result in approximately the same amount of
total acceleration capability.  I have a disagreement with the rules over
the agility question, which I have discussed at great length before.  
In essence, I have always played that ships may have multiple devices which
use the "same" power (but not at the same time), so that maneuver power can
be fed to the weapons as long as you are willing to accept a reduced or zero
acceleration as a result.  Between that habit, and some calculations about
vectors, angles and so forth of space combat, I am firmly convinced that the
most important factor in a ship\'s ability to avoid being hit in space combat
is dependent on the gross effects of its maneuver drive, and that agility
should therefore be equal to drive rating, provided that you are not "double
dipping" the drive power for weapons.  I have always believed that this was
the intent of High Guard, and I think it works well with the thruster tons
suggestion above for acceleration, since it has the desired effect of making
heavily armored ships slow and non-agile.  More comments on this under weapons.

In the thrust based suspensions for smaller vehicles, it should be noted that
the minimum thrust for standard grav is one ton, the minimum for low power
heavy grav is 0.4 tons, and the minimum for low power light grav is 0.1 tons.
Except at the very lowest thrusts and power levels, a tradeoff analysis will
always favor standard grav.  Example tanks in 101 Vehicles using LP-HGrav
could have their overall costs reduced by 50% by using std grav, even including
the need for additional fusion plant and higher thrust to maintain performance.

In contact based suspension, the minimums for volume of wheels and tracks as
revised by the errata (1.5 and 2% respectively) are fairly generous.  Striker
heavily penalized high ground pressure vehicles (reasonably), and although
the complexity is probably not merited in MegaTraveller, I have always aimed
to keep my ground pressures around the 5-6 dividing line between high and
low off road performance in deference to reality.  The rules are also unclear
as to whether P/W should be figured using total power or power after all other
devices are powered.  Because of the method of calculating transmission size,
I have assumed the former, which means that the "power requirments" of the
wheels and tracks can pretty much be ignored.  If there is any doubt, the
power plant must supply at least enough to power the suspension, but I\'d
figure that into the P/W.  Thus, it\'s only effect is to put a lower boundary
on a vehicles power plant size, which is unlikely to be a problem unless you
are trying to use batteries or some such.

Communications:

In almost all cases, except for very small vehicles and low tech level devices,
the only important factor for communicators in the final design is price.  I
usually don\'t get too worked up over having .03MW of power used for electronics
in a craft with 2MW of power, so I frequently ignore them when adding up power
requirements. I also usually like to have a back-up communicator on board all
spacecraft. Just a matter of taste.  The credits saved by leaving out the 
backup are usually negligible in a starship design.

Sensors and Electronics:

As with communicators, most of the time price is the only important factor.
Lower tech large EMS arrays may end up using enough power to worry about, and
military vehicles sensors may be important.  Don\'t forget that active and
passive EMS include all the smaller single purpose electromagnetic sensors.

Weapons:

The meson gun is the king of starship weapons.  Nothing else available at
Imperial tech levels will kill a ship with one shot.  Armor is irrelevant
to meson guns, and screen are really only effective against the smaller
ones.  Thus, no battleship needs to be bigger than necessary to carry and
serve the meson gun.  Since agility is one of the better defenses, and my
version of agility calculations places a premium on light armor, I\'m finding
that there may be some limited utility in large particle accelerators to
damage and inhibit the construction of unamored meson gun carriers.
Lighter armor also gives fighter and SDBs something to do, though they had
better have large computers to be effective at TL15.

While the rules are clear about turrets taking up 13.5kl regardless of the
number of weapons installed, the TD example starship construction from
issue #14 incorrectly shows triple laser turrets taking up 40.5kl.  I also
usually figure that the turret weight about the same regardless of the 
number of weapons, which is probably not what is intended.  On most ships
the difference is not significant.  Any of my ships without specified missile
magazines need to load missiles in cargo space.

I have used turret mounted direct fire mortars in some designs of TL8 and 9
military vehicles.  These are not permitted by the rules, but exist in the
real world, so I extrapolated.

Cluster bomblets, tactical missiles, and rocket launcher artillery should be
put back into the game from Striker for use in military adventures.

Mass driver gun calculations should give rate of fire in rounds per second,
not round per minute.  (Error in Striker translation).  Without making this
change, MD guns are probably not cost effective.

Point Defense rules need to be put back in from Striker.

Screens:

All meson screen power consumptions should be divided by ten according to
Trav Digest#14. (e.g. UCP1=.015, UCP2=.03)  I have left specifics of 
obscuration devices off of recent military vehicle designs.  Their power,
weight and cost are negligible, and if needed I would specify a reasonable
number before combat (say 3 or 4 dozen maximum).  I don\'t like the little
sandcasters because I don\'t think the particles would stay airborne long 
enough to do much.  No rules for any of these gadgets are provided, either.

Bridge:

I usually go ahead and put in basic env, basic ls, ext ls, grav plates and
inertial compensators for the entire volume of a starship.  I haven\'t found
that it drives power requirments up too horribly for merchant ships.

To maintain consistency, I do calculate the control point requirements for the
hull, despite my difficulty with increased armor requiring more control.

For a military starship, there can be no excuse for not putting in the biggest
computer available at your tech level.

Based on the Starship Operator\'s Manual descriptions, I almost always use 
holographic linked panels when available, because I figure the using character
would want them.  I try not to install more add-ons than I have crew members
to use them. 101 Vehicles has an implied rule change allowing you to use linked
panels without a computer, which I have never taken advantage of.

Accommodations:

Rule 3, reduced vehicle gunners, still looks bad after the errata: (C+S)/W,
since S is usually substantially larger than C, and I\'d think that your
computer would have more to do with it.  What I use is X=C/(W/S) and some
common sense.

Rule 4, supplanted vehicle commander says X=(T-S)/C, which has the effect of
making it impossible to get rid of the vehicle commander if the total cost
of the vehicle apart from the sensors is greater than 100,000C/TL.  The best
value of C/TL is 8 at Comp 9, TL15, and Cr800,000 doesn\'t buy much of a
TL15 grav tank.  I think that X=(T/S)/C, plus some common sense works better.

In very light vehicles, I usually calculate the weight of seats at 0.1t rather
than 0.02t to allow for the weight of the passenger.  This is almost always
ignorable on large vehicles.

Starship command crews look awfully bloated to me, especially in cases where I
am carrying a 130 man marine company on a small vessel.  I usually reduce them
with the same formula as the bridge crew, which satisfies my prejudices.  If
the total was less than 10, there was no reduction.

Fuel:

If necessary, ships could jump as soon as the fuel processor had done enough
fuel for the jump, rather than waiting for the full load to be processed.
Fuel scoops and purifiers are almost always economically justified.

Design Evaluation:

In grav vehicle speeds, I usually give them in terms of the "vacuum" speed,
so they should be multiplied by .9 for standard atmosphere, to taste.  I have
also interpolated values on occasion.  If you tried to use the rules as w
written, many airframe configuration craft could go faster in thin atmosphere
than in a vacuum, which doesn\'t look right.  Purists might wish to recalculate
lift requirements for grav vehicles based on local gravity. I don\'t usually
bother.

VOX: Yes, there\'s somthing missing in these young men\'s lives, something that 
leaves them empty, aching, alone....

MIKE: [walking over to the sales clerk] Yo, Buddy! How\'s by you? 

CLERK: [reading a DragonLance novel, not looking up] Mm.

DOW: [hands thrust in pockets, shoulders hunched] Listen, we, ah....

MIKE: [hopefully] We\'re looking for, um, well, YOU know----

BOTH: [eagerly and with desperate hope] The MegaTraveller Journal #1!

[There is a long silence. Slowly the clerk looks up from the book. Cut to a 
close-up of Mike nodding and smiling hopefully. Cut to shot of Dow scratching 
his chin. Cut back to the clerk.]

CLERK: Traveller? They still publishing that?

[Dow winces. Mike slaps his forehead.]

MIKE: Of COURSE they\'re still publishing it, you moron! The MegaTraveller
Journal! Number ONe, with the map and everything! The Spinward Marches!

DOW: [starting to look discouraged again] Body armor, new rules. You know.

CLERK: [going back to his book] Never heard of it. Try Shadowrun.

MIKE: [near tears] Oy, vai is mir!

DOW: [bleakly] Whatever. 

[As the pair walk slowly out, mourning, the voice over continues:]

VOX: Yes, that\'s right. Dow and Mike are living in Pittsburgh, one of many
cities worldwide with Traveller-disadvantaged game stores. They have never 
even SEEN a copy of the MegaTraveller Journal #1, though they hear regularly 
from friends who have had them for weeks or months. Please--won\'t you help
them? Send your offers of support, specifically to find copies of MTJ#1, to
mpmst1@vms.cis.pitt.edu or to wr0k+@andrew.cmu.edu.

  I know that guy! He and all of his equally alert relatives *also* work at
the games store here in Gothenburg:( with the exception that almost everything
these lame ducks carries is all the Games Workshop \'super-space-chapter-marine-
gene-stealer-space-ork\' boardgames with attendant tons of miniatures:(

  Typical quote: "What? Challenge 47? Should it have been out three months
ago, you say? Well I don\'t know, I don\'t read it."

  The only solace is a persistent rumor that a new gang will open a new shop
in Gothenburg this summer:0

  Judging from the big political map over the Extents in Vilani&Vargr, some 
portions of the Regina subsector (Yres, Menorb and some of their neighbours)
has been occupied by Vargr forces, and this is \'confirmed\' by the MTJ1 map
over the domain.
  I also don\'t remembering seeing the Border Worlds on the map in the players
handbook, but I might be wrong on this one. I know, though, that all the worlds of the Border Worlds are listed as standard Sword Worlds in the MARCHES sector
file that I ftp\'d from sunbane a few days ago.

  Another strange anomaly on the MTJ1 map is that the imperial border around
Five Sisters(?) (The subsector with Andor and Candory) disappears off the 
spinward edge of the map, which could indicate new Imperial accuisitions,
spinward of Spinward so to say, or a faulty map-making algorithm at DGP.

  Hmm, \'Imperial Reserve\' gives me the picture of vast tracts of land, going on
for miles and miles, totally uninhabited, prize property for any Ihatei(sp?)
that just \'happens\' to land there:)

copies 8-). There may be two reasons for it:

1. Germany is a little bit smaller then the USA

2. My local dealer is more engaged (we engage him a lot 8-).

I\'m looking forward to get MTJ#2. Can somebody tell me, when
it is scheduled ?

  Enclosed after this note is an executible file that will allow you to generate
random words in the Vargr language (taken directly from the random word gener- 
ator tables located in Alien Module 3). I AM planning on adding a pronounciation
along with the generation process, but that is still in the works. The file I
am sending today is uuencoded, so that it will survive transmission over the network. All you need to do do recieve the file is to save it, cut the header off
of this mail, (and digest material), and download it to your machine and uude-
code it. Then it is directly executible. It should round out to about 18k (I
think 18,102 to be exact). When you execute it, it will give you this help
message:
        Usage: vargr number-of-names [maximum syllables]

You have to specify the number of names/words to generate whether it is 1 or
1 million. Since this random generator sometimes creates very long words/names,
you can limit the number of syllables generate by entering a 1 to 6 parameter.
The maximum number of syllables is 6. I really haven\'t had time to write any
doc for the program, but I think you can handle it...ha ha. It\'s still in the
software development stage (new features, doc, etc), so I will call this
release 1.0.

Generic Disclaimer: This program is useable only on IBM PC and Compatibles. I 
compiled this program using Turbo C version 2.0 running on a Zenith 286 running
DOS 4.01 (if this is necessary). I will not claim responsibility for any mishaps
generated by this software. It is virus free, and as far as I know, is bug free.

This program is copyright May 1991 by David C. Boddie. You may copy this software freely, and give it out to whomever you see fit. There is not shareware charge
for source code either (when released). When the source is released, you may

So sayeth the writer.

Hope this will be something you can use...

  Enclosed after this note is an executible file that will allow you to generate
random words in the Zhodani language (taken directly from the random word  
tables located in Alien Module 3). I AM planning on adding a pronounciation
along with the generation process, but that is still in the works. The file I
am sending today is uuencoded, so that it will survive transmission over the network. All you need to do do recieve the file is to save it, cut the header off
of this mail, (and digest material), and download it to your machine and uude-
code it. Then it is directly executible. It should round out to about 18k (I
think 18,140 to be exact). When you execute it, it will give you this help
message:
        Usage: zhodani number-of-names [maximum syllables]

You have to specify the number of names/words to generate whether it is 1 or
1 million. Since this random generator sometimes creates very long words/names,
you can limit the number of syllables generate by entering a 1 to 6 parameter.
The maximum number of syllables is 6. I really haven\'t had time to write any
doc for the program, but I think you can handle it...ha ha. It\'s still in the
software development stage (new features, doc, etc), so I will call this
release 1.0.

Generic Disclaimer: This program is useable only on IBM PC and Compatibles. I 
compiled this program using Turbo C version 2.0 running on a Zenith 286 running
DOS 4.01 (if this is necessary). I will not claim responsibility for any mishaps
generated by this software. It is virus free, and as far as I know, is bug free.

This program is copyright May 1991 by David C. Boddie. You may copy this software freely, and give it out to whomever you see fit. There is not shareware charge
for source code either (when released). When the source is released, you may 
copy that also at will, and have free reign over what you wish to do with it.
So sayeth the writer.

Hope this will be something you can use...
Dave Boddie

In the PBEM game Mike Metlay recently made the following statement:

>    There are few things on
> which Lucan, Dulinor, Margaret, Strephon, and the Solomani all agree;
>psionics are one of them.

Now, I wonder about the Solomani. We\'ve been told that the present anti-
psionic hysteria was started around 800 by a mismanaged experiment in
psyco-history (Has this been stated as true, or is it just a theory?).
The problem was exarcebated by the fear of the "Zhodani menace" and got
out of control. Well, at that time the Solomani Sphere was very remote
from the Imperium mainstream. They may not even have been part of the
experiment, and they definitely can\'t\' ve felt seriously threathened by
the Zhodani, can they? _Is_ there actually any great anti-psionic
feeling among the Solomani? Especially the rimward part that were never
under Imperium rule? Can anyone remember reading anything about this,
either pro or contra?

Mike?

As an aside, I don\'t think that Lucan, Dulinor, Margaret, Strephon or
very many of the more educated part of Imperial society is all that
bothered by psionics either. It\'s Joe Q. Public that gets upset and
institute progroms, necktie parties and other such fun. As witness
the two psionics institutes that were allowed to survive in secret to
advance imperial knowledge. The authorities uses psionophobia (lovely
word, don\'t you think? ;-) but they don\'t suffer from it. I wouldn\'t be
at all surprised, actually,  to learn of high nobles secretly employing
psionic adepts to increase their security.

I had the "opportunity" to spend several hours in airports recently, and got
to thinking about what starports are likely to look like.

1.  We know that weapons are not prohibited in the starport.  We also know
    that it is standard procedure for ship\'s crews to take possesion of all
    weapons for the duration of the flight.
2.  I think its probably safe to assume that a starship passenger will check
    most of his baggage through to his cabin.  Most starships are not
    designed for the passengers to easily carry all his luggage for a week\'s
    stay to his cabin.
3.  Most starship crews want this luggage checked for weapons.

If we assume (I seem to be using that word a lot) that there is some
organization providing ticketing and baggage handling for single ships and
small lines (Tukera et.al. will probably provide their own.), they will
probably also provide security scans of baggage and passengers.  These
organizations are the subject of another message, but for this discussion
details are not important.  I see this leading to a situation not unlike
modern airports -- passengers pass through detectors before being allowed
onto the ships, and their bags are checked for explosives and weapons before
being delivered to the ship.

Starship crews and starport personell are issued ID cards of some form, and
must display these to enter the flight line and maintenance areas.  Weapons
possesion in areas outside the secured areas is not prohibited, but is
discouraged.  Ship\'s crews are permitted to carry weapons in the secured
areas, but the starport security people won\'t tolerate disturbances.

Obviously, this changes the atmosphere that many of us create for our
starports.  Has any out there never been in a major firefight in a starport
bar?  It does, however, seem to make more sense to me.

I still have a few questions, though.  While the preceding would apply to A
and B class ports, and would probably apply to most C class, would it apply
at all to D class ports?  I noticed a while back that some security has been
instituted at the general aviation facility of our local airport (B/C
class), which was unheard of ten years ago.  Anyone with more experience
(Richard?) care to comment?

Also, does this ruin too many scenarios?  I think it can be worked around,
and in fact can imagine the effort to smuggle guns onto a ship being a
nights adventure in itself.  Does anyone disagree?

psionics...  he couldn\'t be more right.  It\'s the worst kept secret in
Traveller that the Emporer has his own psionic secret service (called "IRIS",
I forget what the acronym actually stands for).  The whole point to IRIS
is to provide extra security for the Emperor by psionically scanning all
his visitors, retinue, cohorts, etc.  This way, the Emperor should never
be subject to any assassinations...  Of course, we know that this is bunk,
since Strephon was clearly shot by Dulinor on the Imperial Palace\'s closed
circuit TV during prime time.  What happened??

For reasons unknown to the privvy public, Strephon had IRIS removed from
his court about two months (or so) before Dulinor made his attack.  Thus,
"The Unseen Who Also Serve" were not anywhere nearby to detect Dulinor\'s
threat.

Now, as to his point about nobles keeping psionic adepts around for greater
protection... that\'s anybody\'s guess.  But, there are a few points to keep
in mind.  1)  Sure, harboring a psionic is a class-two felony, even for nobles,
but how many nobles do *you* know of who follow all those tedious imperial
laws?  2)  The sheer number of nobles, and hence of plots thereof, guarantees
that some of them will be employing psionics.  3)  Psionically gifted nobles
exist in and of themselves (just look at how many are playing in campaigns!)

As for the Solomani, official word says that the Solomani hate them just as
much as the Imperials...  Of course, we\'ve seen how well the Imperials follow
their own supposed "psionophobias".

P.S.  In the Hinterworlds, there\'s even an independent state of humans called
the Anubian Trade Confederation who openly and unrepentantly use psionics for
commercial advantage.  (And they directly border on the fringe of Margaret\'s
domain.)  This might give us some idea as to how far the psychohistory exper-
iment went.  RHA

Striker on my PC.  I\'d appreciate any comments or suggestions.

First pass would be two-player only and would exclude vehicles and all
of the optional rules.  It would also only allow simple orders in the
"move-shoot-rally point" format.

Hans Rancke-Madsen has questioned my authority (ALWAYS a bad idea |-> )
on the matter of psionic hatred in the Solomani Sphere; due to the relative
remoteness of the Sphere from the Zhodani, he asks, is it not reasonable
to assume that the psionic hatred established by the backfiring Psycho-
history project would not have taken root there? 

To which I reply: *BZZZT* Wrong. Sorry, Hans; the Traveller literature
states (PRECISELY where, I\'m not sure, but my best guess is Alien Module
Six) that the propaganda leading to the Psionics Supressions went into
full swing all over the Imperium, including the Autonomous District, nearly
two centuries before the fracturing of the territory. The Solomani are
Imperial in their tastes and prejudices in that respect; you won\'t see
many psionic shield helmets in the Rim, but the people there hate psis as
much as anyone else. See also "Prison Planet" for an example of how psis
are treated by the locals.

It seems to be my week for questioning assumptions.
The following came up during a discussion on law and ethics in the PBEM:

>       "Thank you for your LEGAL opinion Doctor; perhaps you would care
>to examine Section XXV, which as a part of every crewmember\'s employment
>contract waives all claims against Turnskaad, its agents and employees,
>except to recover amounts due under the insurance and salvage agreements
>which all crew signed."

This is undoubtedly good law in the Imperium of the PBEM universe. I
remember my character being asked to sign this waiver. I didn\'t think much
about it at the time, but today it struck me that this may be good law in
USA, but it certainly isn\'t in Denmark. In Denmark there are certain rights
you _cannot_ sign away. If someone is responsible for maiming you, then no
amount of waivers will mean a thing. He\'s still liable.

So the question that struck me was: What are the laws of the Imperium? Are
they just carbon copies of American laws, late 20th century? Can anybody
remember any Imperial laws mentioned in the Traveller and Megatraveller
canon? I seem to recall something about a definition of murder and some laws
about robots. Anything else?

  Israel\'s newest battle tank carries a locally developed 120mm smoothbore
cannon. The cannon fires rounds which are almost completely used up in the
firing process - there is no case to eject. The 60mm mortar is fired from
within the hull, without requiring the crew to expose themselves. Two
machine guns, the coaxial .5" and the commander\'s MAG, complete the weapon
fit. In locating the engine in the front of the tank (before the driver) IMI
provided additional protection to the crew and the crew compartment if further
equipped with flash fire suppression system. An environmental sensor is tied
into the fire-control computer providing data on weather conditions and cannon
barrel curving. A telephone is located in the rear of the tank, allowing
infantry units in combined operations to talk directly to the tank commander.

Note: This is not exactly the Merkava. I abided by the rules and made the
      ground pressure much higher than I would have liked - no way I could
      stuff the armour and suspension and the weapon fit into the weight of
      the real Merkava. I am now short some 3.5 tons from the real tank.
      An additional problem is the ammunition for the main gun - removing
      42 rounds allows the tank to carry 6 infantry - by the volume taken
      by 42 rounds is not enough to carry 2 men... Oh well. Moreover, the
      cannon uses special AT rounds which are not known to me and I have
      no idea how to quantify them. This is (in any case) revision 1 of
      the design. I will try some more to fit the design to reality later.

   To answer a question from last week:
   HIWG (the "History of the Imperium Working Group) and Tiffany Star go
together.  Membership in HIWG gets you the subscription.  HIWG members generate
several magazines aside from TS.  One of these is Terra Traveller Times. Aside
from TS, subscription to the other \'zines is open to all.  I subscribe to TTT,
but I am not (yet) a HIWGer.
    TTT in particular is put together by Mark Gelinas, who has a rough schedule
with the Navy.  The mag gets sent whenever he gets back from a cruise, so if
you send your money, be patient...

    The craft designers on the TML should probably hold off on marine (water)
designs for a bit.  Terry McInnes\'s Wet Navy rules will start serialization
in Challenge 51 or 52, and deal with (just about) everything.  You have to read
his combat example to see the potential...
    Wet Navy has been a project on GEnie for the past year, so this is no real
secret...

    By way of introduction, my name is James Kundert. I am a SF Bay Area
resident, and have been a Traveller player/ref forever (so it seems). I have
an account on GEnie, where I have been annoying HIWGers and DGP/GDW staffers
for the last nine months.  By way of avoiding the "everybody here is named
James" problem, I also answer to Farstar.

The only reason that I can think of that Imperial laws might seem like carbon-
copies of U.S. laws is because most of the people who write adventures and
articles are from or live in the U.S.  However, since very little is ever
mentioned about Imperial laws (except in the aforementioned adventure), I
would guess that the fine folks at GDW *meant* to leave the penal and civil
codes up to the individual refs.

If there are any legal aficionados out there who are feeling ambitious...
this might be one idea for a time-suck.

But why? We\'re talking about a _massive_ experiment here. The
cost must have been huge, not to mention the number of trained
psyco-historians that must have been needed to control the
experiment (all right, they _didn\'t_ control it). As I recall
the Autonomous District was very much left to itself at the
time. It would not have been nessessary to include them in the
experiment, since the District\'s influence on The Core were
negligible at the time. Wasting resources on it seems foolish.
Yet they did. Why?

Are you saying that all the Solomani Sphere were once a part of the 3rd
Imperium? I have the impression that a part of it never came under the

But dosen\'t that strike you as odd? If fear of the Zhodani were
a significant factor in this process there _should_ have been a
marked difference between the two ends of the Imperium. Since
there _isn\'t_ any difference, one can conclude... what? I don\'t
know, but I find it intriguing.

program is set to generate a set of vowells and consonants , switching on
every other word, but is done in such a way that it is easily modifiable. I
for instance, knowing nothing about C, was able to rewrite it to remove the

        You may also find it helpful to get everything in this directory if

I don\'t have my Traveller books with me today, so this is not 
authoritative.  However, there is a brief section on Imperial Law 
in the World Builder\'s Handbook.  In summary, it said that the 
Imperium was primarily concerned with fostering trade and pro-
tecting member planets from war and piracy.  As a result, most 
Imperial laws dealt with those topics, and there was only a 
minimum of Imperial criminal law (e.g., murder is prohibited), 
and that only applied where there was not already a local law 
covering the situation.  So in the case of liability waivers, the 
Imperium would probably, IMO, not intervene at all, and it would 
be a matter for the courts on the planet of origin to handle.  
For something like the Alcyon expedition, I suppose that a "base" 
planet would have been agreed upon for legal purposes, presumably 
one whose civil codes were to the taste of the organizers.  
Anyone from a planet with different codes would be out of luck, 
and their heirs would have to sue on the base planet.

ASLAN

Like most of the villains in Traveller (you all remember the 
devious and oppressive Zhodani, don\'t you?), the Aslan \'invasion\' 
of the Spinward Marches postulated by the background material 
included with the MegaTraveller rules seems to be getting \'wa-
tered down\' as time passes.  The Aslan aren\'t really bad guys 
wantonly conquering planets, we\'re now told--they\'re just set-
tlers who don\'t see any reason why you would want to leave land 
unsettled on your nice planet.  Maybe so, maybe so....Looking 
over the Glisten subsector, I see only a few planets that are 
really \'earth-like\' (i.e., that will support life without techno-
logical assistance, and have water, and so on).  I can see the 
eager Aslan settlers making their new homes in these places.  
According to the recent MTJ#1 these Aslan settlers are attempting 
to cooperate with local authorities as much as possible.  I 
wonder if this means that they would be willing to conform to the 
TL2 tech restrictions on Sorel?

Anyway, the real question is this:  We all know that Aslan males 
want to hold land.  I\'m guessing that \'real land\', the kind that 
you can walk around on without breathing apparatus, and that has 
plants and animals living on it, is the best.  Is anything else a 
sufficient substitute?  Would a farm tunnel out of THE MOON IS A 
HARSH MISTRESS be land enough to satisfy their cravings, even a 
little bit?  How about a condominium in New York City?  If the 
answer to these questions is no, then why would the Aslan take 
over the administration of an airless rockball rather than just 
ignore it?

FROM THE GAMEMASTER:

A few more notes on Traveller:

1.   The game aims to be realistic, and any referee\'s calls  will 
take  this  into  account.  The idea is to try to  have  fun,  so 
please  remember,  it\'s only a game and the ref has to  have  the 
final call.

2.    The main scientific breakthroughs assumed in the  game  are 
the invention of usable anti-gravity generators (at tech level 9) 
and  the  invention of the Jump drive for star  travel  (also  at 
TL9).  There are no all purpose force fields.  Until TL13 or  so, 
the all around favorite personal weapons will be slug throwers of 
one  sort or another.  Laser and high energy weapons tend  to  be 
bulky and finicky.

3.   Anti-gravity can be used for spaceship propulsion,  allowing 
continuous boost at up to 6 gravities for a month or more in  the 
typical  spacecraft.   However, the basic rules  of  physics  are 
still  in  effect.  At 1G (a typical drive value for  a  merchant 
ship),  a trip between Mars and Earth at closest  approach  would 
take  about  two days.  A 1G constant acceleration  trip  between 
Earth and Jupiter (average separation) would take 6 1/2 days.  If 
a  ship  in space powers down its engines, it  continues  on  its 
course  at  its current speed, as modified by  any  gravitational 
effects.  It doesn\'t stop.  Even with beam weapons with ranges of 
500,000km, space combat is slow.  Two ships which had been  head-
ing in opposite directions at high speed could require many hours 
to match courses.

4.  Communication comes in two flavors: radio and other  electro-
magnetic  radiation  which  travels at the speed  of  light,  and 
messages  sent  by  ship, which travel at the speed  of  Jump  (a 
maximum of about 19 light years per week--Jump-6 ).  Large  scale 
government  tends to be decentralized because of  the  communica-
tions  lag.   A message sent by the Imperial Express  Boat  route 
from  Capital to Glisten would be in transit for almost  a  year. 
Thus,  it  would take two years to send a message and get  a  re-
sponse.   In  a  typical star system  communication  between  the 
innermost and outermost planets at the speed of light might still 
be subject to a time lag of tens of hours in each direction.

5.  Combat is fairly dangerous, and in almost all cases, dead  is 
dead.   There  is no memory recording technology, nor  any  clone 
replacement bodies.  There is suspended animation technology,  so 
a  critically  wounded character *might* last until  a  high-tech 
hospital can be reached.

6.   The  Imperium is big.  Their Navy is big.  Their  ships  are 
bigger  than anything else you will see moving in space.  If  one 
shoots  at  any ship a group of players is ever likely to  be  in 
control  of,  they will be dead.  Don\'t give them any  reason  to 
shoot.  Don\'t break the law.  Fortunately, the laws of the  Impe-
rium itself are minimal.  Rule#1: No nukes.  Rule#2: No psionics.  
Rule#3:  Don\'t disrupt trade.  Rule#4: Leave other people\'s  pla-
nets  alone. Most governing is done by local governments, due  to 
the slow speed of communications.

7. Computers:  Traveller is not a computer heavy game.  Don\'t ask 
me  why,  but  we\'ll play along.  No  cyberware.   Some  computer 
background is assumed for most characters from high tech  worlds, 
because the game does include things like "dynamically configured 
controls"  on  most  vehicles of TL10 and above.   Plug  in  your 
favorite  set  of control parameters and any  vehicle\'s  controls 
look much like any other\'s--to you.  Trying to use someone else\'s 
default  controls could get interesting.  (But it\'s all in  Japa-
nese!??  What does this blinking green light mean?)

8.   Aliens:  There are a number of them.  Aslan and Vargr  would 
be  the most common major races seen in this area.  Droyne  would 
be  possible.   Darrian (home of a minor human race) is  not  far 
away, and you would probably recognize a Darrian if you saw  one.  
The Sword Worlds, a rather backward and clannish group of planets 
are also fairly close.  You\'d probably recognize a Sword  Worlder 
if  you saw one, too, but it would be less likely.   The  Darrian 
Federation is friendly toward the Imperium, the Sword Worlds  are 
not.

9.   Monsters:   Lots of planets have native life forms.   It  is 
possible  that  there might be some commercial value  in  hunting 
them for anything from their fur to their unusual body chemistry, 
but  they don\'t usually store treasure in their lairs.  The  game 
is  not usually about interactions between players and  monsters, 
but about interactions between players and non-player characters.

Sounds OK to me.  Besides, the last time I ran a bar fight it was fists, 
daggers and a body-pistol or two.

At a class D starport, the ship is likely to be a free trader.  While it might
be easier to get *to* the ship carrying a weapon, I\'ve always figured that
the free traders in the business of stopping at these places either searched
all the luggage by hand, or had portable metal detectors to do the basic 
screening.

I have always been under the impression that this is *supposed* to be a
problem, which is the reason for the indetectable body pistols and the plastic
knives and so forth.
 
All your comments look pretty reasonable to me--so much so that I\'m not sure
why you think this is changing the flavor of the game by any great amount.
Your comments are in accord with the way I\'ve always done things.

Being the author of the remark which spawned your query, I am also very
interested in this subject. A long way back, I submitted to the TML a
message which speculated on how laws operated in the Imperium, in terms
of what was forbidden, under whose jurisdiction things fell, and so on.

My best resource so far is a well-read No. 14, Journal of the Travellers\'
Aid Society, titled "Laws and Lawbreakers." There\'s an article on police
forces, a couple of paramilitary/police Striker vehicles, and an article
entitled "High Justice" which briefly sketches out how to handle legal
matters.

Hitting the high points: Modern crimes are the concern of planetary 
authorities; subsector courts handle unlawful introduction of hi-tech
to a low tech world, violation of a planetary interdiction, possession
and/or use of NBC weapons, and war crimes (as defined by the Imperial
rules of war.); Imperial courts handle capture/transport/possession of
slaves, piracy, murder of Imperial officers/officials/nobles, theft of
Imperial property, treason against the Imperium and conspiracy to commit
treason against the Imperium.

        Also, Re: Imperial Laws
        I\'m probably the current legal expert (?) on the Third Imperium; an
article of mine is set to run \'any issue now\' on the Imperial Legal system.
To give you some general ideas, there are several levels of law:
        High Justice law
        Imperial Law
        Recognized Law
        Local Law

        High Justice is the real nasty stuff.   Waging Illegal War, Possesion/
Manufacture/Use of Nuclear Weapons, Interfering with an Imperial Warrant Holder.
The Imperial govt. and all its agencies come down very strongly on violations
of High Justice laws.
        Imperial Laws are the next level; Murder (usually only applies on
starships in flight), Piracy, etc. are Imperial Laws.  The Imperial Ministry
of Justice is empowered to investigate and deal with violations of Imperial Law,
and occationally other Imperial agencies will get involved.
        Recognized Laws are those that are not of Imperial general interest,
but that the Imperial Government will allow extraterritorial pursuit and
extradition for violators.  Most murders and moderate-to-severe crimes are
Recognized.  Local governments are responsible for investegating and enforcing
these laws, though the MoJ may assist.  It is important to note that these
are not per se Imperial laws; the local government has to enact the law, which
will then be recognized by the Imperial government.
        Local Laws are those that the Imperial government feels are of minor
enough nature to not warrant allowing Interstellar Extradition.  Assault and
moderate theivery are the top of Local Laws, which goes down as far as
Parking Tickets etc.

        If anyone has specific questions beyond that, feel free to contact
me.  I don\'t want to post the whole article since Challenge bought it and
it\'s now their property, but I\'ll assist people who would like specific
points answered.

I did some work on this a couple of years ago, but put it on
the shelf when I realized that even given quite conservative
assumptions the total number of civilian ships in the Glisten
Subsector (a not terribly populous subsector) would work out
in the neighbourhood of 40.000!

I came up with a procedure for working out trade routes (4
different levels of trade volume), but never managed to put
figures on the levels. I could post it if anyone is interested,
but it may be a while before I have the time.



Then Rob Dean writes about the terrible aslans:

I\'ve always been bothered with the way those aslan got moving
so fast and so far. The map enclosed in Megatraveller is from
ca. 1120, unless I\'ve misunderstood something. There\'s three
things that I find hard to believe about it:

1) That the aslani clans can cooperate enough to attack the
   Marches in concert. This has been the weakness of the aslan
   from the time of the Aslan Border Wars till now. Why should
   it suddenly change? I just don\'t buy the explanation about
   this coordinator of _ihatei_ movement. Especially in view of
   the fact that

2) I would personally undertake to defend the three imperial
   subsectors of Trojan Reach with nothing but the subsector
   fleets, never mind what regular fleet units Norris may have
   allowed to remain. Remember that the opponents are ihatei
   fleets. This is the _surplus_ that the clans can afford
   to spend on younger sons. A considerable portion of the
   military might of the 12-16 subsectors that the aslan inhabit
   on this side of the Great Rift must be tied up in guarding
   the clan holdings from rival clans. Any contribution from
   the far side of the rift must be negligble. (Surely the parent
   clans will want the wealth of transriftine sectors to flow
   to them and not the other way). And as any single aslani clan
   would control very much less than the total ressources of
   those 12-16 subsectors, the Duke of Tolia would propably be
   able to fend the aslan off by purely diplomatic means.
   Especially as

3) There is in 1116 a belt of neutral worlds approx. 10 parsec
   wide between the aslani worlds and the Imperium. Surely those
   worlds would be much easier prey than even a weakly defended
   imperial subsector? Furthermore the typical ihatei fleet is
   composed of obsolete jump-3 ships. If you analyze a map of
   Trojan Reach, you will find that there are _very_ few ways
   for jump-3 ships to get into the imperial worlds (double-
   jumping will reduce the capacity of these colonizing ships
   something fierce!). The Imperial High Command would certainly
   realize this and take measures to guard these few routes.

   (As a final aside, can you imagine any sizable ihatei fleet
   being assembled in secrecy? Give me a reasonable imperial
   spy-net and a few hundred courier ships, and I\'ll guarantee
   to _meet_ any invading fleet with an imperial fleet before
   they get inside the Imperium!)

I guess the answer must be yes, then. ;-)

In current times, the laws in force on a ship are the laws of it\'s port of
registry (which is why alot of North Atlantic commercial ships are
registered from bizarre places...). The laws in force on board a commercial
airliner are the laws of the country that the airline is based in (e.g. an
Air Canada international flight operates under Canadian law).

In both cases, there are a set of international laws (LOS == Law Of the Sea
for oceans; I dunno for aircraft) that preempt any contradictory local laws.

Sorry, to mention this but I\'ve already written a ship design program
and it is currently having some documentation written for it (hopefully :)

The program is written in mostly machine independent C and I\'ll be making
it available sometime real soon.  I have tried to stay as compatable as
possible with the current MT design rules, and I think I have succeeded
quite well.  There will also be a version for TDR when the TDR vehicle
design rules stablise a bit.

I cannot really help you with the mysterious errors, it could have something
to do with rule interpretation.  I should also say that I haven\'t checked
out the designs in the GDW books, so it could be GDW is at fault!!!!  ;-)

I have not heard discussed before, that we design a REALLY interesting alien.
I suggest this because it is my belief that there is enough expertise on this
list to actually come up with an alien race with could actually function and
why.  It\'s just a though actually but I think some aliens designed on this list
(or on a sub-list) could really spice up a lot of traveller campaigns.  I would
like to hear what you think.  Hopefully I\'m not wasting to much bandwidth.

how about body chemistry and metabolism?  that may be a bit much but one

bit unlikely.

Here\'s a quick rundown on chemistry possibilities for near-terrestrial planets:

nitrogen compound breathers (forms various acids in solution, which can
function to oxidize food. Also, one of the NO compounds is paramagnetic.
The effects of that, who knows, but perhaps the atmosphere itself will
produce a magnetic field.)

sulphur compound breathers (sulphur is very similar to oxygen, except
that it is solid at near-earth temperatures. H2S is a possible
substitution for the role water has in plants, and is indeed used that
way in certain ocean-vent life forms on Earth. However, sulphur isn\'t as
reactive as oxygen, so life forms might be lower energy <ie- move slower
to catch food, sustain energy with greater care, etc>)

Chlorine/flourine/etc breathers (HIGHLY reactive, so life forms may be
more energetic.)

Other chemistries:
Silicon- silicon forms VERY tight bonds, so either used in high
temperature life form (ie- molten rock level) or used for skeletal-type
structures.

Sugar- this is our chemistry (more or less) Note: at high temperatures,
sugars are as explosive as nitrates are in our temperature.

Nitrates- Cold life forms, possibly.

Ammonia- at low temperatures, ammonia bears some of the same
dissasociative properties as water.

Metallic- Possible electron transfers and salt solutions form basic chemistry.

Inert gas foo- certain inert gases can be used in gas pump lasers.
Perhaps a \'gas cloud\' being, composed of many separate pieces, uses
lasers to interconnect the nodes... or something.

Heavy metals, radioactives- depending on the chemical type of the
compounds, oxidation may or may not be important. Radioactive decay and
linked reactions form chemistry. Note: Xenon absorbs neutrons, and may
be of use in such a life form.

Crystalline- As WHAT crystal hasn\'t been mentioned, there\'s alot of
lattitude here. Crystals have interesting properties of resonance and
reproduction that may make it more common than non-crystalline life.
<shrug>

Cold hydrogen- mentioned in a certain Carl Sagan book whose title eludes
me, liquid hydrogen can occur in two forms, determined by whether the
spins of the electrons match or not. He postulates that this difference
may be utilizable and be the structure of some sort of life form.

Plasma- the photospheres of stars may be the most abundant sources of
life in the cosmos. Plasmas, ionized gas, are matter and energy which
affect each other. It doesn\'t take a huge leap to postulate life of this
sort.


Well, this covers some of the possibilities for chemistry in life forms.
When I\'m up to it, I\'ll post about some of the different forms I think
life could take. Oh, and maybe the social/evolution stuff (though that
is so specific perhaps I shouldn\'t...)

Until next time...

        What with all the recent posting of binary name generators, and my
recent postings of the C source code to various generic name generators, I
decided to see if I could adopt one of them to the traveller name tables system.
        So far I\'ve made it for Aslan and Vargr, but since if I recal a binary
was posted for Vargr (not sure here) , though only ussable for PC\'s, I\'ll 
start off with the C code for the Aslan one (yes, I speak with run on sentances
that too... :-) ) . With a little modification anybody with a C compiler should
be able to get this to work, and modifying it for the other name tables used
in Traveller should be simple.

    I have also wondered about the same thing, and to that end, I\'m
trying my hand at designing my first mini-adventure for some friends.
 
This may be a shop worn idea but......a local starport installation has
intecepted a ship carrying contraband.  The ship\'s crew has been detained
but for reasons unstated, Imperial officials are looking for a crew to 
pilot the ship to the nearest Marine Base for disposal.
    The ship is carrying several large canisters, usually devoted to 
carrying unstable medical materials.  In actuality they are carrying 
lifeforms like those in the \'aquariums\' in the movies ALIENS, which are
encountered in the med-lab.
    The basic theme is corruption and moneymaking on thepart of local
and some Imperium officials, muchlike in the movie.
 
If the adventure goes well, the players gain some expereince piloting a
ship, interacting with some ranking NPCs and earning some loot.  The
exposure also allows the developmentof further ideas.
 
If the adventure still goes well [grin] their curiosity will overcome
them and they\'ll have a look inside the canisters.  The rest is history!
 
Will they become host trying to destroy their cargo?  Will they recognize
the danger of actually delivering the cargo?  How will they explain the
destruction oftheir cargo?  etc...etc...

This being my first crack at any Traveller material, how does it sound?
Is it too ambitious for first time out?  Can you offer any suggestions
that would bring the plotline more in line with what goes on in the
Traveller milieu?

Thanks, from the Neophyte!

Well, there are probably a number of good scientific reasons for this, but
I\'ll add a few game mechanical and game background reasons.  People not playing
with the official universe can ignore these.  Races would have little reason
to interact (and it would be difficult for them to do so) if they didn\'t
breathe approximately the same atmosphere mixture.  One of the intentions of
Traveller aliens was that they be playable both in their own cultural context
and in a mixed human/alien context.  Major races, of course, are limited to
humaniti (all three major branches), Vargr (modified Earth life), Droyne (who
presumably fooled around with Earth life because it could live in their
environment without special attention), and the K\'Kree, Hivers and Aslan.  I
won\'t make excuses for them.  Several minor races have been presented in 
various Traveller products (some quite \'official\') that are not based around
oxygen chemistry, such as the Jgd-il-jagd (sp?) who are gas giant dwellers,
the Ebokin (methane breathers) and the Brinn (also methane? or are they a
hydrogen breathing species?).  The old FASA adventure "Ordeal on Eshaar"
took place on a halogen atmosphere planet, from what I recall from hearsay.

> neon.  Wouldn\'t this be much more realistic?


Not necessarily.  I could look up (if anyone is interested) a number of science
fact articles published in Analog over the last thirteen years (since I started
reading the magazine regularly) which go over why chlorine and fluorine 
atmospheres are extremely unlikely (making life in them even unlikelier) and
why silicon based life won\'t really work (silicon doesn\'t actually form the
same range of structures as carbon, making \'silo-organic\' chemistry unlikely.
Some silicon/carbon hybrid systems could be possible.).  Breathing neon is
prety unlikely because it just doesn\'t do much in the way of reacting, and
the whole point of breathing is to fuel some sort of chemical reaction to
keep your lifeform going.  You could probably design a lifeform that could
exist in a neon atmosphere, but it wouldn\'t breathe in the sense that we use
the term.

Not a bad idea perhaps, although I think our pool of expertise doesn\'t include
too many biology types, at least from what I remember of last year\'s survey.

No sublists.  Traffic has a hard time sustaining the critical volume required
for good discussion.

Sounds good to me.  (Never apologize for presenting ideas!)  It might be 
prudent to start with a fairly conventional alien first, though.

^L               The Vargr word generator was created to speed
                up creating words and names in the Vargr lang-
                uage using the tables found in Alien Module #3
                for the Traveller Role Playing Game. This code
                is copyright by me, David Courney Boddie on 
                May of 1991, and I give express concent to any
                one who wishes to copy and/or change the code 
                at will, but if you wish to sell the code, I
                would request that you contact me first. This is
                my first batch of C code that actually works
                that does more than prints "Hello World", and
                I am pretty proud of it. This code is public
                domain, but if you distribute it, keep all the
                parts together.

                Compiling this program is simple...There is no
                makefile, and the only file that you need to 
                compile is VARGR.C, which will call all the 
                remaining C files. An example command to com-
                pile for a Unix machine would be:

                        cc -o vargr vargr.c

                For Turbo C, you can just type the following:

                        tcc vargr.c
                
                which will create an executible with the same
                name as the C program. You can also use the IDE
                to generate an executible file. Any errors generated
                by the code should be sent back to dboddie@uafhp.uark.edu.
                
L               Once you have generated an executible, you can execute
                the program with the following parameters (square brack-
                ets [] represent optional parameters):

                        vargr number-of-words [maximum syllables]

                The number of names (whether 1 or a million) must be
                specified. I haven\'t updated the code yet to take any
                number of arguements, so I had to stick this restriction
                on it. Since this word/name generator can generate up to
                6 syllables, and each syllable can have up to 10 char-
                acters each...so that can be a lot. So I have entered a
                parameter that allows you to set the maximum number of
                syllables. Neither of these numbers can be 0 or negative.
                
                Well, there you have it...If you have any questions about
                the code or have patches, please submit them to me. I    
                would like to see what you can do with this if you want.
                I believe this code is somewhat bug free, but I have 
                heard that the executibles may crash some PCs. This 
                program is simple, and you shouldn\'t have any problems  
                with it....but you still might...

                Standard Disclaimer: Since this is my first written 
                piece of code, I will disclaim that I will not be res-
                ponsible for any harmful effects of this code. If you
                are a programmer of C, or can understand C somewhat,
                you should inspect this code before installing it on
                your machine. For those who aren\'t adept at C, all I
                can give you is my word that this code is harmless.

^L               The Zhodani word generator was created to speed
                up creating words and names in the Vargr lang-
                uage using the tables found in Alien Module #4
                for the Traveller Role Playing Game. This code
                is copyright by me, David Courney Boddie on 
                May of 1991, and I give express concent to any
                one who wishes to copy and/or change the code 
                at will, but if you wish to sell the code, I
                would request that you contact me first. This is
                my first batch of C code that actually works
                that does more than prints "Hello World", and
                I am pretty proud of it. This code is public
                domain, but if you distribute it, keep all the
                parts together.

                Compiling this program is simple...There is no
                makefile, and the only file that you need to 
                compile is ZHODANI.C, which will call all the 
                remaining C files. An example command to com-
                pile for a Unix machine would be:

                        cc -o zhodani zhodani.c

                For Turbo C, you can just type the following:

                        tcc zhodani.c
                
                which will create an executible with the same
                name as the C program. You can also use the IDE
                to generate an executible file. Any errors generated
                by the code should be sent back to dboddie@uafhp.uark.edu.
                
^L               Once you have generated an executible, you can execute
                the program with the following parameters (square brack-
                ets [] represent optional parameters):

                        zhodani number-of-words [maximum syllables]

                The number of names (whether 1 or a million) must be
                specified. I haven\'t updated the code yet to take any
                number of arguements, so I had to stick this restriction
                on it. Since this word/name generator can generate up to
                6 syllables, and each syllable can have up to 10 char-
                acters each...so that can be a lot. So I have entered a
                parameter that allows you to set the maximum number of
                syllables. Neither of these numbers can be 0 or negative.
                
                Well, there you have it...If you have any questions about
                the code or have patches, please submit them to me. I    
                would like to see what you can do with this if you want.
                I believe this code is somewhat bug free, but I have 
                heard that the executibles may crash some PCs. This 
                program is simple, and you shouldn\'t have any problems  
                with it....but you still might...

                Standard Disclaimer: Since this is my first written 
                piece of code, I will disclaim that I will not be res-
                ponsible for any harmful effects of this code. If you
                are a programmer of C, or can understand C somewhat,
                you should inspect this code before installing it on
                your machine. For those who aren\'t adept at C, all I
                can give you is my word that this code is harmless.

==============================================================
When is the last time a contractor delivered a ship to the navy
or a building to the county WITHOUT(!) cost overruns?! It\'s my
contention that your spreadsheet is probably more accurate than
you think it is. When you look in the books and see that a ship
of a given class cost X, X is probably an average. Every ship
is unique. As ships of even the same class age, they are refit,
equipment is added or replaced, etc... Our wet navy puts a great
of effort into standardizing equipment but things happen beyond 
their control(eg sub assembly maker goes bankrupt, Murphy\'s Law,
etc). Prehaps after trials of the first few ships of a class, 
some improvement is made, and changed in follow on orders.
Reality: there are over twenty Spruance class destroyers
in the US Navy. There at least 4 different variant sub-classes
which vary from the general design in some minor way. 
They probably didn\'t square on the Navy\'s spreadsheets either.
(Rumor has it that the last ship in that class was supposed to
be a can of peaches but the order number had digits transposed...)
There are scads of factors to consider in building a ship(wet).
Starship construction is an infinitly more challenging project.

PS. Just got an article accepted for MTJ #3, according to a letter by Rob
Caswell of DGP I just got in the mail.(He actually said he "would like to
make room for it," which might mean that it gets pulled at the last minute,
but I can hope.) He\'s also asked me for another article by the end of summer,
which I don\'t think I\'m going to make deadline on, UNLESS someone who enjoys
creating rules tables and testing them from scratch would be interested in
co-authoring with me...?

first thanks to Dave Boddie <dboddie@uafhp.uark.edu> for his Vargr and
Zhodani word generators. I got the sources yesterday and they run (after 
some slight problems 8-).

I made some changes to get them started. Both sources are similar. The 
problems and changes I\'ve made are the same in both sources:
          

Problem 1:

> char *string[6], *wordstring; 

In this line the declaration should be

char *string[7], *wordstring;

because you nead string[6] to create a pointer on a char variable which 
contains the NULL delimiter if using 6 syllables.


Problem 2:
You had to complete the following line:

> string[i] = \'\\0\';

by:

string[i] = malloc(sizeof(char));
*string[i] = \'\\0\';

That\'s the only component of string[i] which needs memory seperatly. In the
loop above this line, the pointers of the variable "string" are set to the
entries of the tables "alt" and "basic". So no allocation of memory is needed.


Problem 3:

I had some trouble with the random generator used. I have compiled the program
with Borland TurboC Version 2.0. The random generator included there 
generates random numbers ranged 0..max-1 if you call random(max).
The random generator in the sources generates numbers ranged 1..max.
Make sure your random generator works in the correct range. The tables
of vowels and consonants need ranges of 0..5. The functions GetICons etc.
need ranges of 1..6. The variable "syllables" should also assume values
from 1 to 6.


The results produced by the original were unusable and can\'t be spelled.

If someone has better ideas for correcting the source, please send me
a notice.

P.S.: By the way, can somebody tell me if MTJ#2 is out in USA. If so I had

As some of you may have noticed the ftp server is down currently.
I am having some difficulties with the hardware involved. Barring
further difficulties, it should be running again by Thursday (12th).

With regards to the recent talk about name generators, I have one
available on the FTP server under the /donations directory. It is
in the middle of being converted to allow it to read allegience
codes from sector maps, and generate names for planets, but right
now it will generate words of random or fixed syllable(sp?) length.
It reads its word data from files, and there is a file for each
of the major races (vargr, Aslan, Droyne, KKree, etc.) Sorry no
Hiver language - obviously.

I am not a very good programmer, particularly because I have been teaching
myself C, so I will try to answer this reply taking into consideration your
criticizms. I really need the criticizm, so fire away... This is a learning
experience for me... :)

I thought I had already compensated for that. Since all arrays in C begin at 0,
if you were to have 6 syllables, that would contain the elements 0-5, with the 
6th element being the terminating char \'\\0\'. Of course with the loop, if you 
ended up with less than 6, the \\0 would be placed wherever the end of the number
of syllables would lie.


+>Problem 2:
+>You had to complete the following line:

+>> string[i] = \'\\0\';

+>by:
+>string[i] = malloc(sizeof(char));

Why would you have to do this? I figured since I defined string[6], there would
be space allocated for it. I do admit I didn\'t do this, but I saw no reason to
allocate extra memory for a string terminator.


+>Problem 3:

I am also using TurboC v2.0 also. In the beginning, I thought about generating
a 0-max-1 or 0-5 range, but thanks to personal preferences, I decided to go 
with the 1-6 range and change it later. In the GetICons and other functions, 
I reduced the random number generated by one whenever I went to reference
anything from the array tables. THat gave me a 0-5 range (I know it\'s not 
truly random, but what the heck...I reduced all the values of my random
generated variablse by 1 whenever accessing an array. I think it was mostly
preference than anything...I tested it here, and it came out fine.


+>The results produced by the original were unusable and can\'t be spelled.

Hmmmmm. This seemed to work for me...it follows the rules laid down in the 
Alien Modules for creating words. If you will look in the Vargr alien module,
you will notice some of those words do gain an excess of 15+ letters, and 
are sometimes hard to pronounce. I believe in my next indever (unless some
one wants to help me -- hint, hint) I will add a pronounciation to the word
generator.

Yes, please do...this is pretty fun to get critiqued....

    'body' => '    I was looking at my copy of the Megatraveller Journal the other day with a
particular emphasis on the Enaaka Worldguide article. I was looking to
incorporate it into my own (fledgeling) campaign, set in an "alternate" uni-
verse. Boy, that was a good article. The "Fungus Planet" has soooo many
possibilites. Anyway, I turned a cold, analytical eye to the world data, and I
found some problems. Most are minor (for example, the mass/gravity data just
doesn\'t jive with the given size/density data, unless my abacus is screwed up).
These inconsistencies are easily resolved, but I found one GLARING problem:

    Aton: capital city of Enaaka
          --population: 9.75 million
          --location  : inside a dome some THREE KILOMETERS ACROSS

    The population densitty of this city is OVER ONE PERSON PER SQUARE METER!
This seems a trifle high to me. Particularly for a planet with a tech level of
six. Even if you assume extensive underground tunneling, I don\'t think it is
feasible. Think of all the things a big city needs: Heavy industries and manu-
facturing, power generation, transportation, distribution and retail of food 
and consumer goods, waste management, atmosphere purification (for a city in
a dome, city administration, planetary government (for a capitol), emergency
services, decontamination services, law enforcement, and probably gobs of
other things I can\'t think of.
    Anyway, this is no  great problem in itself. I am just going to assume 
the city of Aton to be inside a number of such domes. The problem, though,
is HOW MANY? I.E. just how big does a city of about 10 million have to be?
I think this question has a lot of applicability in other situations, too.
That is, given a particular environment (vacuum world, desert world, Earth-
like world, or maybe some type of hostile atmosphere), what is the maximum
supportable population density of a city? I would expect that as the tech
level increased, so would pop density. But how much so? 
    As another example, my "home-brew" campaign wound up with a kinda freak-
ish (randomly generated) world: Selky (diameter: 2000 miles -- about the size
of Earth\'s moon, I believe -- airless,waterless -- population over 90 BILLION!
Tech level: 12. I was tempted to throw this out as being pathetically unreason-
able, but instead I upped the tech level arbitrarily to 15 (high stellar tech-
nology can really pack those bodies in there, don\'t you know) and made a rather
interesting and dangerous planet (can you say "secretly cannibalistic under-
classes"? I knew you could.)
    Well, to summarize in one question:
Would anyone care to enlighten me about their views of technology and pop-
ulation density? Does anyone care? Have I been wasting my time discussing
this? Have you been wasting your time reading this?

One question ?:-)

In the Traveller System, random generateds can get wierd on you.  But with a
creative GM it isn\'t a problem.  Lets take for example your world:

_200A__-C

Obviouslly native life is not possible unless we get into some wierd energy
beings (which is of course possible).  Why was this system settled?  It was
probably the only planet in the habitable zone.  What would drawn 90 billion
people to this rock in space?  It sure isn\'t the Hilton Head Is. of space.
This is probably a system that has a good quantity of metals used is ship
construction and or a "hub" planet for trade.  Not the best place to have it,
but its location makes it suitable.

TL 9 to TL 10 is probably high enough TL to build orbitable habitats.  So you
could have domed cities on the surface and orbiting cities and you could easily
spread the 90 Billion out.  Also, the Basic Traveller rules can be interepreted
to mean the population of the system, not just the mail world!

Hope this helps
Rob

serves as an admirable introduction to the theory of the arcology, a city
that accomplishes maximum pop. density, minimum environmental impact, and
maximized human comfort all in one swoop. Suffice it to say that based
on the theories of Paolo Soleri, who developed the idea of the arcology in
the 1960s, 10 million people in a three-klick square is not only possible 
but in fact quite easy.

I use arcological theory (straight from Soleri, not the watered-down stuff
the popular media tends to handle) in the games rules sets that I write;
if your local library has a copy of "Arcology: The city in the Image of Man"
by Soleri, I heartily recommend reading it, assuming they\'ll let you take it
out. (It\'s a very unusually-designed book, and most public libraries consider
it a work of art as well as a reference and hence limit its circulation).
A very, VERY poor substitute is Niven and Pournelle\'s "Oath of Fealty," 
which gleefully manages to drag every bit of Soleri\'s vision through the
dung heap. Feh!

I should also point out that high technology makes arcological building 
easier, but it is by no means vital: any TL above 4 could build arcologies,
with the maximum population density growing as the tech level did. The
arcology is a philosophy of architecture, not a specific machine; arcologies
can have only a few hundred people, or millions. 

I can go into more details if people want me to, but not immediately; I\'m
leaving tomorrow for a research trip, and will have only limited net access
from now until June 30th or July 1st.

Yes, have played 2300 AD for quite some time now, and I am very
addicted to it now. In fact, I have not refereed Traveller/MegaTraveller
the last 4 years because I have prefered 2300. I like the combat system,
I like the universe, I like the aliens, I like the task system (almost
identical to MegaTraveller\'s). All in all : it is a great game - the only
bad thing is the current lack of support from GDW. When will 2300AD get
their own DGP company to support them ? 

I am not sure what you mean by a smaller game and smaller focus, but
I have to admit that the background material details a tiny universe
compared to MT. The 2300 AD rules on the other hand do everything
they are supposed to do, even though they only use a fragment of the
number of pages the MT rules use.

Yes I think so. Also the lack of wild hi-tech equipment gives a better
feel (even though it might be unrealistic). 

We could go into rules discussions and supplement/adventure recommendations,
but that may be out of focus for a Traveller mailing list ?

It\'s after midnight, and I\'m going to be on shift until 5 am or so waiting
to put beam on target here at the accelerator facility at Notre Dame U.
(a pustulent, oozing chancre on the upper lip of the United States), so I
thought I\'d catch up on some requests for Traveller related materials that
I\'ve gotten and just generally ramble, as I haven\'t done for a while....

ON ARCOLOGIES: Paolo Soleri was a really weird old coot (and may still be,
I don\'t know if he\'s kicked it yet), and his main writing was done in the 
1960s; the tone and tempo of his works reflect this, tho they still apply
quite well even today. Recall that the environment movement was still in its
infancy and not yet in vogue in the 60s, largely a hippie-and-egghead concern.
It\'s worthwhile to see how his ideas translate into Traveller terms....

Cars were big and burned lots and LOTs of leaded gasoline, and it really did
look as if the world was going to be totally paved in asphalt. Soleri addressed
this concern with vigor and bile; he was convinced that the automobile was the
Antichrist made flesh, the modern Mammon that all humans worshipped to the 
detriment of the planet. Which was and is true, to an extent, but what the hey.

In Trav terms this gives rise to varying degrees of arcological development
based on tech level and type of government and law level. Arcologies are not
megalopoli; they do not grow in random directions like cancers. In fact they 
do not grow at all; they spore. When an arcology grows crowded, a new arcology
is built elsewhere. This type of growth and development depends heavily on the
attitudes of the population; worlds with high or extreme Laws and the types
of governments that tend to regiment individual movement stringently will have
an easier time building arcologies. Why is this true, and what does it have
to do with the Satan That Runs on Four Wheels? Simple! Private ownership of 
fast long-range transportation is a basic personal freedom we take for granted
here in the USA, and the single greatest blockage to arcodevelopment: if people
move around all the time and constantly go to new places to get more elbow
room, the arcology cannot succeed. Arcologies depend on a populace that has
no private transport and no need or desire to move around a lot, except perhaps
for vacations. A world with arcologies must by definition make ownership of
cars or air/rafts a difficult, expensive and possibly illegal matter. Public
transport must fill the gap, so efficiently that the average citizen does not
miss having no private go-box. The result is a world of tiny, compact urban
areas with wilderness in between, a world that can "breathe" according to 
Soleri\'s vision. 

The average arcology holds hundreds to tens of thousands of people; larger 
designs of over a million are possible but less practical. It is a single
building that combines comfort and beauty with practicality and efficiency;
while the "basic" designs tend to be pretty but not startling in their
applications and settings, the more "advanced" designs are nothing short of
incredible. I\'ve used designs straight from Soleri\'s book on parties of 
Trav characters, and gotten looks of, "You\'ve gone bananas, right?"

Arcologies can go anywhere there is a need. Fishing and marine development?
Float one on the continental shelf. Shipping and transport? Build one over a
river delta. And- one of my favorites- imagine incorporating hydropower, 
irrigation control, population support and a remarkable esthetic sense by
damming a huge river to form a reservoir, and making the structure of the 
dam itself an arcology of over a half million people! Soleri also predicted
the rotating drum design for the L-5 colony years before it went on the 
drawing board, and in his more fanciful moments created arcological equivalents
of igloos, pueblos, kibbutzim, and designs that could only be called, well,
"abstract." Neat stuff, and a lot more complicated in conception and use
than just a huge apartment building.

ON TECHNOLOGY: I watched a movie on TV last night, something I rarely do these
days. It was a Schwarzenegger shootemup flick I\'d missed in the theaters the
first time around, called "Predator." I\'m sure you\'re familiar with the plot,
such as it is: a group of mercenaries in central America get picked off one
by one by a critter that is nearly invisible, moves like lightning, and kills
with a swipe of razor-sharp claws or a blast of energy. (Until Arnie takes
it on with a handmade bow and arrow and some pungi sticks and wins, of course)
And, Trav-head that I am, I got to thinking:

1. The alien\'s armor was remarkable in its similarity to combat armor: good
protection, chameleon capabilities (altho "our" armor only works in the IR
range, not the visible), and tactical heatscans. The weapons platform was
described as something that could shoot big or small holes in things and 
perfectly cauterize wounds: basically a plasma weapon. It was laser-aimed
and guided from a shoulder mount by head and eye movement; not that much 
fancier than what the Emperor\'s troops carry. Conclusion? It\'s a good thing
the guy chose Earth to hunt on; in a TL13 environment, the local game wardens
would\'ve shot him to pieces in no time.

2. One weapon which I\'d heard about but never seen in action before the film
was the 30mm MiniGun, a gatling weapon firing huge shells at a high rate
of fire and capable of rendering just about anything into taco filling, up
to and including armored vehicles. The drum-loading grenade rifles were
also quite interesting, but not as much so since they have an equivalent in 
the Traveller rules. What I want to know is, why no MiniGuns in Traveller? 
They\'re heavy and noisy, but really efficient compared to lasers and early
high-energy weapons. Hmm, time for another article in the MTJ....

Well, that\'s enough for now; the mini-machine-pistols from Total Recall aren\'t
in the rules either. I guesss we need an Arnie supplement for the rules. |->

Hmmm, time to put on my "Ye Olde Weaponsmith" hat.  The weapon carried by
Blane (Jesse Fortuna) in "Predator" was a modified General Electric M-134
minigun, and is 5.56mm (.223 caliber), not 30mm.  As such, it does much
less damage (using the same round as an M-16).  While it can make chopped
chard out of plants and people, it is significantly ineffective against
armored vehicles (whereas a 30mm gatling gun, like a GAU-8A Avenger, is
most certainly not).  With variable fire rates from 2000 to 6000 rpm, the
M-134 doesn\'t stay loaded very long, once the trigger is pulled.  I read
that Blanes backpack supposedly held 1000 rounds.  Assuming a conservative
ROF, that\'s 30 seconds worth of ammunition.  But, boy howdy!  Talk about
rock \'n roll!!  Sure beats the hell out of Ginsu Knives (tm). :-)

>From an MT combat standpoint, the M-134 is just a 5.5mm Gatling Gun-8 (pg.
77 - MT Players Manual) but with a much higher ROF.  (The ones in the manual
are unrealistically low anyway.) Even the 30mm Avenger could be treated as 
a VRF Gauss Gun, but with a smaller ammo capacity.  The Pen/Atten and
Damage are about right.  However, I\'d jack the Autofire targets *way*
up to, say, 20 or 30.  Sound excessive?  Well, that\'s an Avenger for you. :-)

Those pistols in "Total Recall" were Calico M950 9mm semi-autos, modified
to full-auto for the movie.  The horizontal rotary clip they mount on top
of the receiver holds 50 rounds.  Needless to say, they got reloaded a
*lot* between takes.  Calico also makes a .22 caliber version that accepts
either 50 or 100 round clips.  None of them are full-auto capable however
(sigh).  Maybe, some day, I can afford that $3600.00 H&K MP-5.  Gotta win
the state lottery! :-)

BTW, Firefight 1.0, the personal combat rules for TDR, easily accomodate
both of these weapons.  Iain Fogg and I had intended to redraft the rules
to correct some of the first round omissions, as well as streamline it
a bit.  I haven\'t heard from Iain since the beginning of the year, but
I expect he\'s been as busy as I have.  Maybe we can get something going
again this fall, when the TML revs back into slightly higher gear.

anyone know offhand if it\'s still in print?  (I know, check Books in Print...
but it may take me a day or two to get to the library.)

In addition to restrictive societies, it would seem to me that arcologies 
would be the way to go for a planned colonization of a marginally inhabitable
world, say one with an atmopshere too thin to breathe without a compressor.
In a situation like that, there wouldn\'t be much incentive to gad off on your
own and try to homestead.  I ran through the World Builder\'s Handbook pro-
cedures for Horosho/Glisten in the Spinward Marches a few weeks ago, in
connection with my face to face game, and came up with a base temperature
and atmospheric pressure combination that meant that over a broad band around
the equator, the seas boiled in daylight...which means rain, Rain, RAIN
elsewhere.  With no native life, this looked like a perfect place for arcs, and
I would have put them in anyway...but the dice came up with populations of the
same order of magnitude as the world population (8) for the primary cities,
which made it a sure thing.  I also figure that the unstable atmospheric 
conditions restrict the use of grav vehicles.

Guns:

As Mark Cook pointed out, the minigun does have a Traveller equivalent.  Also,
since some people have access to Striker, I should point out that Striker\'s
gun design system allows you to design any size and barrel count autocannon
you might like.

However, for the stout of heart, I picked up a copy of "Guns, Guns, Guns" by
Greg Porter of BTRC this weekend.  There was an article in Challenge #40 by
Mr. Porter on GGG to MT conversions.  This system allows you to design guns,
rockets, missiles, lasers, and high energy weapons using a fairly straight-
forward and easy to follow system (easier than MT vehicles, let\'s say, but not
quite so easy as Book 2 starship design).  For a conventional weapon, you start
by picking the slug parameters, followed by the powder charge, the casing,
the receiver, the barrel, and the add-ons.  My only problem is that I\'m not 
a real gun buff, so I don\'t know how silly something might be before I start.
Anyway, if you want something with a penetration of 7 so that it will punch 
through cloth armor, it can be done (I did it with a TL9 DS round for what
turns out to be a 9mm heavy machine gun cartridge fired from a bolt action
rifle with cost increased 4 times to get a 50% cut in weight to about 6kg--
think of it as a Boys Antitank Rifle.)  Just for grins, I\'ll append my first
three design tries, converted for MT (without the extraneous GGG data) below.

One of the things I especially liked about the system is that guns improve with
tech levels.  We\'re all aware of the recurring problem of cultural paralysis
in MT, where the TL1 and the TL15 manufactured versions of an item are 
identical...

Notes: The 3mm Needler is a TL10 product, and fires a 3x30mm flechette caseless
round.  It looks like you could probably fire it as a rifle rather than a 
handgun if you used an extendable stock.  Sort of an Uzi or Ingram M-10 
item.

The 4.5mm Assault Rifle is manufactured at TL9 by the League Arsenal (Sea 
League, Overnale/Glisten), and is fairly conventional--cased round, bullpup
configuration. The rate of fire is pushing the limits, and a referee might 
want to think about jamming mishaps if the weapon is used for extended auto-
fire.  It should, however, be able to handle 2 autofire targets without
problems.  (Heavy duty receiver, unusual in an assault rifle design.)

The 9mm Pegasus Hyperion is a bolt action bullpup rifle chambered for the
Pegasus 9mm HMG round (Pegasus Defender HMG forthcoming), used for hunting
the large game found in some of Overnale\'s coastal regions (36,000kg
amphibious killers, would you believe?).

The 20mm assault gun is basically a light grenade launcher firing a short range
small HEAT round.  I\'m figuring on a folding stock on this one...sort of a 
cross between a 10 gauge shotgun and a German HK-69 grenade launcher.  Semi-
automatic.  The flechette round carries 128 2x20mm needles, and I treated it
along the same lines as the game treats shotguns as far as danger space.  Like
a shotgun, anyone in the path might have a problem.  I doubt you would use the
steel slug (AP) round for much of anything, but it\'s cheap for practice.

According to GGG, most Traveller weapons ought to be able to reach into the
next range category, although that would make firing them at extreme ranges
"Impossible".  (Maybe not a bad model...)

One thing Porter doesn\'t cover in the Challenge article is cost conversion.  
In GGG he uses something he calls credits, and I have transferred them over
intact.  This means that most of these weapons come out a bit pricey next to
current MT models, so you could fudge those as you like.


Overall, I\'d say that it\'s worth the $8.95 price, especially if you\'ve got
a) the Challenge 40 article, and b) a need for odd guns.

Why do you think the lack of high tech equipment in 2300 feels unrealistic?
I think it works pretty well, though I\'d like to see a little more on some
topics like ship economics, trade, and vehicle construction. (-8

2300AD is within the \'approved area of discussion\' for this list, so, by all
means send your comments.  2300AD is one of those games that I\'ve kept buying
the supplements and sourcebooks for, because it looks like it _ought_ to work,
but have not yet found anyone interested in playing.

I have noticed the problem of low ROF for machine guns, too (and a corres-
ponding problem of _high_ ROF for small autocannons at low TLs), but have 
been sliding by assuming that the multiple barrel MGs and the VRF Gauss
Gun are all in the "1280, 7 targets" category.  I have this horrid suspicion
that that is supposed to mean 1280 rpm, which is still low.  You\'d want to
fire in fairly short bursts most of the time anyway.  Of course, you still
can\'t manpack the thing in Traveller because the weights for those weapons
are nowhere to be found (short of the semi-legendary Striker miniatures rules)

  I just bought the MegaTraveller Boxed set, after playing with the
original game design for about the past 8 years.  At first glance it
seems to have taken care of most of the wholes that I had unfortunately
run across in numerous campaigns.  I also used the archives this past
weekend and came upon the deckplans.  I thoroughly enjoyed these.  Does
anyone out there have any more that I might look at?  I know of the
deckplans that GDW sells and am currently trying to obtain these.
Are there any more out there in the public domain?  If so, please contact
me as soon as possible....

that should be answered are:

- - - How many greater Asteroids are in the Glisten belt?
- - - Is there a special government world ?
- - - How many planets are in the system ?
- - - Which details are known about government, justice and live in the belt?
- - - Where can I buy the best ships ?
- - - Where can I buy the best "Wiener schnitzel" ?

Any detailed Informations are welcome.

the subject of arcologies; I have only SEEN "The City in the Image

for pointing out the single most important reason for arcologies, that
of inclement environments (and perhaps, sadly, the reason why the Earth
will someday be arcological--it\'ll be unlivable otherwise. But I digress)

Second, reading the comments on the Minigun, the Avenger and the M-134
(OK, so it WON\'T kill a tank. Big deal. And you say it\'s made by General 
Electric? Sheesh, why don\'t they use THAT in their ad campaigns showing
how many fields they\'re in? All together now: "GE...we bring good things
to DEATH!" *budda budda budda* |-> but I digress). I\'ve realized that
the reason I was so impressed with the M-134 in "Predator" is that I 
recognized the niche it served as a crew firebase weapon at TL8, the
logical next step after the M-60. Caseless DS rounds that weigh less and
take up less room will allow TL9-10 weapons to have higher ROF and longer
fire-times between reloads, to say nothing of the beginnings of smartgun
control ("Excuse me sir." "Whaddaya want, M-264?" "I just wanted to remind
you that since you very nearly got yourself killed and me captured when
you emptied me panic-firing in that last ambush, I\'m limiting you to fifty
round bursts this time." "Oh shut up."). TL11 brings us, at last, to one
of my pet projects dating back to 1980, when I was expanding on the Book 4
rules for my college game: a Gauss firebase weapon, halfway between the
Gauss rifle (empties too quickly) and the VRF Gauss Gun (too big). The
Gauss Machinegun (GMG, for want of a better term) would be bigger and a 
bit heavier than the rifle, have a lot more penetration power and a much
higher ROF, and would gobble needles and amperes from a battery pack/needle
feeder bin worn on the back or fanny. Work it out, gang; a laser pistol
power pack would be able to power such a gun for thousands of rounds, and
at only 3mm diameter, you could pack a LOT of needles in a fanny pack.

I have an NPC in my Pittsburgh game right now, a seven-foot-tall Urzaeng
Vargr with Down\'s Syndrome and a GMG. He basically feeds himself, keeps
himself clean, and shoots anything that tries to attack the party. He serves
admirably as a means of preventing the players from wasting time worrying
about self-defense and concentrating on meatier gaming fodder....|->

Anyway, enough of this rambling. Midnight-to-eight shifts on the particle
accelerator do this to me....

Imperial Intelligence Report:
Files on Old Terra - Emerging Cultures Symposium, Case 2:

TL8 Integral Targeting System
(From PC Week, June 17 1991    Story by Neal Boudette)
(Headline and annotations mine)

The U.S. Army has tapped a Houston firm to develop a hand-held
"soldier\'s computer" with a heads-up display that could could have
applications [sic] in business as well as battle.  

The 1-pound 386-based unit would include a microphone and radio for
sending voice and data, and a joystick for targeting weapons and
directing vehicles and troops, said Michael Stewart, president of
Texas Microsystems Inc.

A heads-up display, which projects a virtual image in front of the
user\'s eyes, would be mounted on a soldier\'s helmet or goggles, he
added.

In battle, the computer would allow soldiers in the field to view
real-time maps of troop positions, according to Stewart.

In business, the coputer could be used by auto mechanics, police
officers and medical technicians, he said.

...
=========

Is this a "typical" TL8 development, or is does it simply show up in
heavily militant cultures?


Using TL8 materials, what do you suppose are the "bad" side effects?
Here\'s a few I just thought of:

   . Is it radiation hardened?

   . How much does the HUD limit peripheral vision?

   . Can the signals from other people\'s units be jammed, foiled,
     confused? 
	    (I assume the current position info is telemetry, not passive)

   . For that matter, can your own unit be misled?

   . Will reliance on the unit make the wearer more vulnerable when it
     breaks?

   . Does it connect to night-vision equipment?

   . Does it have RFI that gives away your position?


Too bad they\'re only using a first-generation 32-bit chip.  I think
it would be neat to see one of these integral suit-mounted units
with hard-wired connections to your suit-mounted weapons and
sensors.   I also think it could be done in 1991 (old earth calendar).
I also wonder if their HUD presents a flat or a 3-D image.


What\'s the real advantage to the nation that possesses this equipment,
both militarily and economically?  Do they have any enemies worthy
of this kind of military sophistication or are they working on
citizen suppression?


[This guy really has a predeliction for 1-sentence paragraphs, and
doesn\'t seem to know about using "that" and "which" -ZB:  which has
"applications", the HUD or the computer?  Oh well.  Who are we to
judge vagaries of aboriginal grammar?  RJ]

The weapon was not a 30mm MiniGun.  It is the M134(GAU-28/A). A 7.62 Nato
round MiniGun.  And it is primarily used in ground support by helicoptor
personel. example. the MH-53J.

The weapon exits.  Not sure of its name though.  It has a 6 round \'revolver\'
style magzine.  Loaded one round at a time.  Would be interesting to try and
design one....

> What I want to know is, why no MiniGuns in Traveller?

There are Mini-Guns in Traveller they are the 7mm Gatling gun (ref: Striker
book 3) and can be designed using Striker AutoCannon rules.  You just have
to some how interpolate to a smaller round (smallest size capable using
Striker is 20mm).

No we don\'t need an Arnie suppliment for the rules, we need an
Arnie rules suppliment......

If I remember correctly, it is no longer available in subscription form
- - - you must buy it from your dealer.  The price is around $5.00 an issue,
and there are going to be (four? some small number) issues published
each year.

> Are back issues also available?

Before it\'s current incarnation, the MTJ was called "The Traveller\'s
Digest".  There are very few TD back issues available - I suggest
checking with DGP itself or The Weekend Warrior.  There has only been
issue #1 of the MTJ and it has been extremely popular and his
disappeared from everywhere.

If you write DGP and ask Joe Fugate for explicit permission to photocopy
past issues for personal use, they tend to be pretty relaxed about it.
But make sure you receive their permission in writing to keep the
lawyers happy!

access to an uncompress program for the IBM-PC I could read them
there instead.  But unfortunatley I don\'t. Any ideas on how to be able
to decompress these files?  I really would like to have a look at them.

Brian,

    You can get an MSDOS compress from wuarchive.wustl.edu in the
/mirrors/msdos/starter (I think) directory.  Or I have the source
code to one available for download from my bbs (918 834 7402).  First
time callers are given full download privileges.  Other than that, if
you can\'t find a compress give a yell and I\'ll ship you a uuencoded one.

    'body' => '  If we look at the number of different weapons per TL in the lists of
Traveller weapons we will notice one curious thing. There is a lot of
\'contemporary\' weapons, and the number of weapons per TL goes down as the 
the timedistance (\'timedistance\'?:) from today gets greater.
  (I\'m doing this from memory, so I reserve myself for the errors in advance)
  We have the rifle, the bolt action rifle, the carbine, the hunting rifle, the
autorifle (equivalent to the Squad Automatic Rifle (SAW) I think) several 
calibres of pistols and revolvers, the shotgun, the autoshotgun, two assault
rifles, several machine guns, the submachinegun and so on as examples of 
weapons using the \'brass case\' technology.

  Lowtech weapons, of the \'powder and ball\' and \'arrow\' versions there are a
few.

  For \'caseless\' technology weapons, we have the ACR (?), but the snub pistols,
the accelerator rifle and the Assault Rocket Launcher might also be caseless 
weapons, since they fire rocket propelled bullets. It depends on if the initial
launching charge is in the bullet itself or in a brass case.

  Gauss weapons are a small group, there are only the gauss rifle, the gauss
pistol and the Vulcan analogue, the VRF Gauss Gun (Vulcan is the 20mm minigun
that viritually all US fighters use, the VRFGG would have to have at least
penetration 40 for me to call it a GAU-8 analogue:)

  Lasers have the laser rifle, carbine and pistol.

  The high energy weapons are practically the same weapon done at 6 different
TLs.

  The grenades, grenadelaunchers, hand grenades, rifle grenades, recoilless
rifles and all that stuff have a lot of types on a lot of TL\'s, but the only
new innovation is the RAM grenades (And that\'s not really new either. It could
be compared with the RAW (Riflemans Assault Weapon, a HE or HEAT rocket powered
thingy fired from an M16 to bust bunkers and vehicles)

  From a military point of view (conventional wisdom, at least) one needs one
weapon for the common rifleman, usually a rifle:)
  There should also be several different support weapons of various portability:
Heavier versions of the riflemans weapon, and some kind of direct & indirect 
explosives projector too.
  The officers need something light like an pistol and all the rest needs a
good and light defence weapon.

  Add to this the civilian versions of the above, the hunting rifles and so on.

  So, what is my point with all this? The point is that a lot of weapons that
logically (In my opinion, at least:) should exist on the higher TL\'s doesn\'t
exist in Traveller. Where is for example all the caseless versions of 
contemporary weapons? Where is the light manportable pulse laser support 
weapon? Where is the gauss SMG (or if you think that the current gauss pistol
is really a SMG equivalent: Where is the non-auto gauss pistol?) Where is the
gauss shotgun?

  One of the troublesome result of these holes in the list of weapons is that a
force equipped to something more than TL9 won\'t have the capability that it 
could have. I think this is one of the basic causes of the \'This TL\'s infantry
weapon can\'t penetrate this TL\'s infantry armour\' problem.
  I also think that the fact that a lot of people introduce non-standard 
weapons that fills these holes are an indicator that the problem is a real one.
Examples are Mikes Gauss MG and the Painter (Laser MG that works by letting
it\'s beam scan over a designated area, thats where the name comes from) from
my own campaign.

  A slight problem with Striker is that very small bore/low power weapons 
designed with it will be less effective than small arms from the lists. For a 
striking (excuse the pun) example, look at the lowest power vehicle beam laser 
in the MegaT vechicle design rules (The weapons in there were apparently 
designed with Strikers system for designing weapons. If I remember is correctly
it draws half a megawatt and has a penetration of 5. Any designer that uses 
this laser must be crazy, for a laser-rifle will be both more effective and use
less power....
  And then we haven\'t thought of how a 4mm bore hypervelocity massdriver firing
KEAP ammo can get a penetration of 20 (the VRFGG).

  So my recommendation for a relatively small very high rate of fire weapon with
resonable penetration would be a number of gaussrifles strapped togeather:)

  Permit me to doubt the practicallity of it. I know how hard it is to keep a 
helmet and a pair of ear protectors on straight while using a weapons at night:)

  Other than that, I think the greatest problem is the batteries. The computer
part will be easy enough to power, but the display and especially the radio
will eat batteries like popcorn.

  Other problems might be that the light leaking out of the HUD alerts enemies,
and the incredible amount of chatter over the radio that probably will result
from every soldier having a radio of their own.

It\'s me I\'m back!  Not that I v\'e ever actually been on the list, but I now
actually have a computer account, but I have contributed before, much to 
every ones chagrin, but I hope that you will put that behind you and accept my
formal and humble request to join your list.   (PLEASE!?)

Now that I\'m a grad student I won\'t have the time to bug you all with loads of
craft designs so you can all breath easy.

Has anyone out there noticed that the thrust to weight ratios in trav and the
speeds predicted are totally crazy?  you need a ratio of 1G to get to 1200kph!
or something like that.  Here is a partial list of real data points.

aircraft	t/wt	top speed
Tu-22		.2917	1480kph
B-1A		.3038	2232kph (original design speed)
Tu-26		.4190	2445kph
F-111		.4590	2655kph
Mig-25		.7168	3380kph

SR-71		.3824	3186kph    some of these speeds may be low but that
makes them a safe bet.

Of course changing the existing speeds means a revolution in speed for all
vehicles.  However I must point out that the thrust generated by all trav
turbine engines is hugely exaggerated.  the highest thrust engine I have found
are the high bypass turbines of the 747 ie 21 metric \'tons\' of thrust. followed
by the 18 \'ton\' thrust of the twin engine Tu-26 mach 2 heavy bomber(engines
originally develloped for the Tu-144 supersonic transport)

so we have to revamp COACC\'s engines thrust output too!

By the way, has anyone ever considered the possibility of broadcast power in 
trav?  New power plant Idea #765

Same size weight cost output etc as a fission reactor but no fuel!
Power input?  decaying mesons from a meson gun.  Required:  Direct
coommunications link to power source (if military must be at least a maser comm
we don\'t want that signal varying or subject to jamming!)  Probably a max range 
of Planetary where meson gun accuracy starts to fall off. 


#766  Laser powered boiler.  Solar cells would get burned off to easily, but
suppose you have a non X-ray laser captured by a parabolic mirror and focused on
a collector (perhaps defocused to prevent burning the plant to slag) again 
planetary range restrictions (beam columation problems)

Object will have very low agility when at long range.  course changes must 
be sent to the power source in advance to maintain beam focus.  Of course if
the vehicle is using a radio to maintain its link it is broadcasting its
 position for all to hear...  Just what a gunner wants to know...
Still it is an interesting idea yesno?

	Anyway, I hope this gets through, I never have used a VAX before.

As a MilSpec device, it *has* to be, otherwise the DoD won\'t authorize
the purchase.  As an employee of a military contractor (among other things),
trust me on this one. :-)

Built into a helmet?  Lots.  Find out how many military Helos have crashed
at night because the pilot was wearing a \'night vision system\', and ran
into a power line or something equally pathetic.  Imagine a soldier wearing
this thing, crashing around in the brush, because he keeps tripping over
roots he can\'t see very well.

Not neccessarily.  If they have the equivalent of a SINS (Ships Internal
Navigation System), they don\'t need telemetry.  Just spin up the gyro,
feed it a very accurate initial position, and you\'re ready to go.  Subs
use these because they can\'t get navsat signals when they\'re at operational
depths.  (Right, Carl?)

Nope.  See previous answer.

Depends upon how stupid (or lazy) the soldier is.  ("Gee.  My life
preserver just sprang a leak.  Too bad I never learned how to swim!") :-)

> . Does it connect to night-vision equipment?

An NVS is maginally useful for pilots (see above), and more useful for
a stationary spotter (like a sentry or sniper).  For a person trying to
move around on foot, it\'s probably not much more than dead weight.

> . Does it have RFI that gives away your position?

MilSpec would prevent it from having enough to do that.

Maybe less than you think.  (Picture this: high-tech 21st century ground-
pounder stumbles around half-blind while Afghani Mujahadeen (sic) creep
up out of their foxholes and slip a sharp knife into his shrapnel-stopping
Kevlar vest.)

Hmmm.  Maybe, but I think a good design would overcome both of these
problems.  The display can\'t be too bright or it zaps the soldiers
night vision.  As for radio, I imagine it would be strictly LOS with
a very limited range (say, 5 klicks).

Again, I don\'t think there would be enough light leakage to be a problem.
As for radio chatter, most of that could be controlled by rigid commo
discipline and no VOX activation.  If you have to think about it before
you push the \'transmit\' button, you\'ll be amazed at how much it cuts down
on the idle chatter.

  Some weeks ago, the tv here showed \'The Longest Day\' which prompted me to
hunt through the bookshelf after the original book by Cornelius Ryan and got me
thinking about the problems that would appear if the characters in a campaign
got a pan-galactic too much and enrolled in the ground force of some faction.
  
  I normally supports the idea that there shouldn\'t be any difference between
a PC and an NPC from a game-mechanical point of view, but playing out an entire
planetary invasion looks as unappealing as rolling all the \'to hit\' and \'to
penetrate\' tasks of a 200 battery batron salvoe:)

  One workable solution might be to look at it from the characters standpoint:
They see just a small part of it, and they don\'t know about all those bullets
that arn\'t aimed in their general vicinity. In game-terms this would probably
be something like a task to avoid getting shot at during a certain interval
of time (COACC uses this approach with regards to small arms fire vs low flying
a/c) and some sort of random list of what types of weapons the enemy uses.
Has anyone done something like this? Did it work?

They had this A-10 ("Thunderbolt II" or "Warthog" - take your pick)
sitting on the pad.  The gun is mounted in the nose about eye level
for most U.S. males.  It has six enormous barrels.  Looking into 
one gives a calidescopic effect.  The riflings have the tightest 
twist I\'ve ever seen.  Looked like about 1 full revolution for each
6 inches or so of travel.

I think Mike\'s comment about "lightly" armored is true only in the
sense of light for TL10 and up.  :=)

I think the other reason they are considered non-portable is because
of the weight of the ammo.  *I* don\'t want to carry a grav sled 
with 100 rds/second of 30 mm ammo.

True.  I tried \'unsigning\' the standard energy wpns using Striker and the
stats given in Striker.  And I was very unsuccessful.   I then tried to
design an autocannon for personal use.....
  It was a 2cm bore and came out to be about 20kg not including ammo.

BTRC is the Blacksburg Tactical Research Center, which is a small gaming
company that started at Virginia Tech (in Blacksburg, VA).  Greg Porter
is the guy that does most of the development work.  It is now based in
Richmond.  Anyway, he has one main game called Time Lords, which has a
very realistic but somewhat complex combat system.  That is the one that
uses all the parameters and stuff you saw in GGG.  He has a couple of
scenario books for Time Lords, plus GGG, and a couple of other spoof games
along the lines of "Mutant Biker Nuns from Hell" or something like that.
I knew him at VT, and my friends and I playtested Time Lords thru many
variations and campaigns.  It was a lot of fun.  And GGG is just the thing
for you armchair infantry weapons freaks - Greg is one and he wrote it!
Plus there were several others in our group.  A LOT of research went into
it as well, so current tech designs are very realistic.  Future tech weapons
are also dealt with, but depend on assumptions that may or may not fit with
the typical trav campaign - things like battery storage density vs. tech level.
But you could certainly have fun and learn a lot from trying it out.

BTRC does not export overseas themselves, but they are available thru
many dealers and distributors.  I got mine from a mail order place called
Adventure Games Unlimited (where everything is 35% off retail).  They do
ship overseas.  Email me if you want more info on them and I will send it
to the mailing list.  They have nearly every game in print, plus lots of
miniature figures and also some books and magazines.

I have had lately with Traveller is trying to figure out what future combat
would look like.  It seems that the introduction of the grav vehicle ought
to increase the pace of battle so much as to make the invasion of Kuwait
look lethargic.  Along the same lines, it would appear that vehicles suffer
from much the same problem that Bertil noted yesterday regarding infantry
weapons: they appear to be seriously undergunned in proportion to their 
potential.  We have also been informed that as the TLs go up, the distinctions
between different classes of combat craft (tanks, fighters, system defense
boats) blur until the only thing distinguishing them is size.  Thinking along
these lines, I present:


Phalanx Ground Support Gunship TL15

     The Phalanx was designed in 1092 and deployed in limited numbers by 
corps level heavy support battalions in the Spinward Marches during the Fifth 
Frontier War.  While intended as a fire support vehicle for task forces of 
smaller grav combat vehicles, it has a secondary role as a near orbit space 
fighter relying on its dual heavy fusion gun mount.  Its heavy armor gives it 
near immunity against anything short of a light meson gun.  
     The secondary armament is arranged in four circles of turrets perpendic-
ular to the long axis of the craft, so that at least three of the turrets of 
each circle can fire at any given target.  Much of the fire is fully automat-
ed, with the gunner primarily serving to prioritize and designate targets 
which are then engaged by the available weapons until sensors indicate that 
they have been destroyed.

The marginal cost of adding more weapons to an already existing platform seems
to be pretty low compared to adding additional platforms.  I would expect that
armed forces would strike some balance between multi-weapon platforms and
single/small number of weapon platforms based on their perception of the risks
or benefits of concentration of firepower.  I _think_ that this ought to be
able to destroy any equal cost collection of grav vehicles from the 101 
Vehicles book, especially if you allow some rule as discussed a few weeks ago
to give it an advantage for its Model 7 computer system. (I should also point
out that I think the values given in Book 1 and copied above for a ship class
fusion gun are unreasonable).

I also think that it is time to rethink the 1 turret/100 tons of displacement
rule, since this bird could have easily powered 6 additional starship fusion
guns in lieu of the secondary armament.

I only put enough fuel in for a day\'s worth of combat--I\'m thinking that the
fighting phase of a planetary assault wouldn\'t last long enough to require
refueling during the critical part of the operation (that is, while the enemy\'s
grav fighters were still contesting the invasion...once the tanks are beaten 
the infantry is reduced to impotence as far as I can see...surrender or be
dug or blasted out, if necessary by infantry using things like this beast as
back-up.)

Dr. Rammduzer Tuerz esteemed sociologist...

	I would like to express my disgust with many members of the
Vargr scientific community and the scientific community at large on
the matter of Vargr natural heritige.

	Many of my collegues have dropped their charisma far to low
on the issue, and are unworthy to clean my boots.  They shoud hang 
their tails in shame!

	Because of the influence of the ancients, Many of the so called
Major races developed theri technologies on planets alien to their 
genetic origins.  The Aslan, The Hivers, and the (untranslatable) plant
hunters of (untranslatable) dubious intelligence K\'Kree are the only
native of their own world.  Consequently most of our knowlege on
the biology of humans and Vargr come from who?.... The SOLOMANI????

	The Solomani manifesto is clear.  For many centuries before they
obtained spaceflight (during which time The Vargr conquered vast tracts
of space) the Solomani used their knowlege of genetics and biology to
subordinate subspecies of their own race.  Mass murders occured for
prejudiced reasons and were called science.  The small continent of
Austrailia was a penal colony for \'The Criminal Type\' (The translator
apologises) Obvious Idiocy!  Now The Solomani claim to be the ultimate
humans?!  HA! (Untranslatable)

	These are the scientists who tell us that the Vargr were
genetically engineered...  AND YOU BELIEVE THEM????????

	
It is my firm belief that the data on the fossil records of earth has
been falsified by these (untranslatable)s.  It is my contention that Vargr
were the original intelligent life form of earth.
The Ancients came in and decided to try to use us as slaves.  Perhaps they
did make some changes in our genes but these surely were not major ones.
Vargr DO NOT make good slaves.  Every time it has been tried it fails
Vargr respect charisma, not weapons.
	Any one who tries to keep Vargr slaves will have to spend a lot
of money on guards.  And a slave owner that allows a vargr slave near a
weapon will not live long...
	Human history is full of slavery.  It was from humans that
Vargr learned to keep slaves.   If the Ancients wanted us as slaves they
really (untranslatable) that one.

	Humans have obviously been engineered, look at the different minor
and major human races and you will see that easily.  I believe that the
humans were constructed from primates.  For Millenia on Earth humans
believed that they had been created!!!!!!!  The theory of evolution was
ridiculed because the religeons knew that humans were constructed!!!!!
Plus there are ancient legends of Vargr on old Earth:  The Were Wolf
A large sapient life form which matches the description of a Vargr!!
These creatures were hated and FEARED!!!!!  As the Solomani Fear Vargr
now!!!

	Yet in spite of all this evidence, my (untranslatable)
collegues have accepted this line of  (untranslatable)
And what is the NAME of this evil smelling putrescent (untranslatable)
theory???   THE SOLOMANI THEORY?!?!?!?!?!?

	AND YOU BELIEVE IT??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

I (translated as "strongly reject") this nose full of feces!

I do not disagree that Vargr may have had some small genetic manipulation
But there is NO GOOD SOLID UNSUSPECT SOURCE OF EVIDENCE to suggest that
Vargr did not evolve naturally!!!!!!!!!
	Science is as full of prejudice as anthing else in life.  The
opinions of the researcher can and do show up as prejudice in the data!
It\'s all a matter of what data is discarded as false data points.
I do NOT beleive ANY thing that a SOLOMANI says about eugenics!
Neither should you or the rest of the galaxy!!!!!

	My tail stands proud and my charisma is undaunted by the
SOLOMANI THEORY!!!!!  I tell you that the Solomani monkey boys are
making their monkey laughs at you.  Stand proud, Tails HIGH, and
Bite for the throat of the next Human who tells you otherwise!

Dr. Rammduzer Tuerz

PS  Refrain from calling our old world Lair.  The name comes from
SOLOMANI origin.

	(The translator apologises for his inexperience with the
subtleties of Gveug.  I\'m only human.)

how\'s that for food for thought and role playing?

Sure it\'s a lot more bulky that the TL 17 missile but hey!
After all,, here we are with TL7-8 equipment turning out small amounts of

at TL 5 we couldn\'t get ANY plutonium but at 6 you can get enough to make

> . How much does the HUD limit peripheral vision?

Built into a helmet?  Lots.  Find out how many military Helos have crashed
at night because the pilot was wearing a \'night vision system\', and ran
into a power line or something equally pathetic.  Imagine a soldier wearing
this thing, crashing around in the brush, because he keeps tripping over
roots he can\'t see very well.

> . Does it connect to night-vision equipment?

An NVS is maginally useful for pilots (see above), and more useful for
a stationary spotter (like a sentry or sniper).  For a person trying to
move around on foot, it\'s probably not much more than dead weight.

> What\'s the real advantage to the nation that possesses this equipment,

Maybe less than you think.  (Picture this: high-tech 21st century ground-
pounder stumbles around half-blind while Afghani Mujahadeen (sic) creep
up out of their foxholes and slip a sharp knife into his shrapnel-stopping

"practicing" infantryman, I think it has been a while since you\'ve
used night vision gear.  The primary factor to consider when you\'re a
grunt humping in the bush at night is that you can\'t see ANYTHING
anyway; take it from me -- having to turn your head to see the root in
shades of green beats the hell out of tripping over it when you can\'t
see your hand in front of your face.  Modern low-light NVS goggles are
fine for driving and MUCH more than adequate for walking.  Admittedly,
helo pilots do have a problem, but flying takes a HELL of a lot more
peripheral vision than walking.  When we get the thermal sights they
use on AFV\'s down to a reasonable size, things will be even better.  I
expect they would equip everyone with the things now except for the
cost and battery problems.

As for radios, most infantry squad and team NCO\'s carry at least a
radio receiver now.  The military really got ripped on these things --
we used to go out and buy the Radio Shack voice-activated radios `cause
the issue ones were so bad.  Having everyone in the platoon on the
same frequency but only allowing the leaders to transmit would be a
substantial advantage.

If they do a decent job on the design, these helmets could be a real
"Good Thing".  Picture the Afghani with his knife being drilled at 200
meters by the infantryman with adequate night vision.  :)

I find the Battletech figures quite suitable (not the \'mechs, the ground
types).

Of course the Grenadier Traveller figs are very good, but they are
out of production as far as I know.

Other suggestions could be shadowrun figures or any modern period figures
for that matter. The range of weapons of course won\'t be available, but
my chracters still run around with 7mm rifles.

The hard part is providing vehicles, horses just don\'t cut it. I have
gone to auctions looking for good vehicles and not found too much. The
old 15mm line of traveller figs produced a couple (air/raft, and a
wheeled vehicle), but there isn\'t too much for 25mm vehicles (There\'s
a lot of lead in a good scale vehicle - even the 15mm air/raft weighs
about a kilo).

Could this be caused by downright unimaginitiveness on the part of GDW\'s staff?
I am not saying I would have done any better....:)  Perhaps whoever was

so weapons we could have come up with if we\'d thought about it?

Here is a question for all you military types (or armchair weaponeers).   Do
cased rounds have any inherent advantages over caseless rounds?  In my game
(which I hope to start up again *REAL SOON NOW*  :)), I have arbitrarily
decided that all explosively-propelled slug throwers tech 9 and above use
caseless ammo.  Does this sound reasonable?  Arguments for?  Against?

This was proposed as a power scheme for jet airliners what, 15 years ago?  The
idea was to leave enough jet fuel for takeoffs and landings and a margin for
emergencies if the beam cut off.  Once you got high enough the laser satellite
cut in and you turn off the jet engines.  The laser beam heated the atmosphere
for propulsion.  It was supposed to use frequencies that wouldn\'t penetrate to
the ground in case something went wrong (like terrorists, or aiming problems).

Here is an odd question to the Referees out there....

What is your favorite galactic conspiracy?

I\'m afraid I do not use the shattered imperium setting, I set it up in
classic Trav time ie 1102-3 pre fifth frontier war Spinward marches and
Foreven Sector (foreven is my own designed sector comprised of amber zone
articles and other adventure planets)

As a ref I like to set the players up against something very powerful
such that their actions can have galactic implications.

I generally start them off with something small low power when they run
into the tip of the tentacle of a BIG plot...
As they progress they gain power and gradually learn what\'s going on
until they work their way to the heart of the octapus.

Is there anyone else who likes this style?

I am curious what big plots against the galaxy someone else has come up with.

Here is mine (One of my ex-players will read this and say Ho! HO! so that\'s
what was going on.  {Hi Steve!  How do I send you mall?})

Colonel Baremkatalasche\' was the head of SORAG, the Zho covert operations
organization for Spinward Marches & Ikar (Foreven).  He worked his way up
the ladder believing that eventually, the Consulate woul;d defeat the
Imperium and bring the benefits of their way of life to the poor oppressed
Imperials, before they strangled the way of life of all good and right
thinking Zhodani.

Upon reaching the top he then was let in on the Consulate plan for control
of the Imperium.  There would be no conquest.  No liberation.  The Consulate
simply planned for the cold war to go on indefinately.  All the operatives
he had seen give their lives were completely wasted.  All the efforts.
All the death pain suffering...  All for nought.

Something had to be done.....

He gathered his allies in SORAG, Naval and military intelligence and has now
defected to a faction in an Imperial client state.  This faction is willing
 to take over the government and swing to the Consulate on Baremkatalasche\'s
say so.

The Plan
Baremkatalasche\' is building up the client state\'s fleet by using the defecting
Zho ships as pirates.  Stealing ships and valuables to fund the states war
effort.  When they are prepared they will begin attacking Imperial and
Zho ships to start a war.
At the moment the Consualates plans are not ready for war for another five
years.  The premature start of the fifth frontier war will result in a 
horrible Consulate Defeat.

Once this is accomplished, Baremkatalasche\' will return to the Consulate
now with a powerful Consulate ally and begin preparation for the Sixth
Frontier war...  And when the Consulate knows it must strike and strike hard
there will be no more half efforts to conquer the Marches.  The Sixth 
Frontier War will destoy the Imperium utterly!!!!! HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!!!
(evil cackling in the background)

With this going on there are lots of ways to get the players involved.

One time I had them running weapons but the money was secretly going to
fund the plot...

One time the players ran into a slave gathering expedition where the
slaves and profits were going to go to the plot...

One time I hired the players to raid an ancient site (but the artifacts
were going to the conspiritors...

One player was a scientist, I kidnapped him and put him in a work camp
similar to the village in the TV series the Prisoner...

Nobody has yet made it close to the  heart of the conspiracy (I\'ve
moved before they quite made it there)

Any way, This is the big plot I have used in the past and probably will 
continue to use.

I liked the Zid Rachele Society plot to take over the Imperium.  The reason
I don\'t use the civil war imperium is I like to make it so that the
characters can do something big that will effect the big picture.  With
Lucan and friends running around with BatRons, it\'s tough to really do
anything unless you want to give your players a FLEET!  (NOT ME!!!)

The Sadistic thing about this plot is that the players (if they are
successful) will stop the Fifth frontier war from happening early.

But they won\'t stop it from happening...

On the bright side think of how many billions of man-years of peace they can
buy for all Humaniti.

Anyway, I\'m curious what you guys may have used or would like to use.

So what do you say,  If your players read TML I\'d like to hear your plots
anyway by personal mail if possible (I\'d really appreciate it.)

Thanks,

Mr. Scott

Feudal Technocracy is a form of government unique to Traveller. My personal 
argument is that it is in fact unique to the arcology-based worlds alone, 
and that arcological development, especially on hostile worlds, goes hand in
hand with feudal technocracy. The essential concept behind the FT is that 
the world\'s population centers exist and operate (as self-contained units
and in relation to one another) to perform specific tasks and act along
rigidly defined lines of authority. An arcology may be responsible for a
certain planetary export, or provide some critical service to the planet,
or merely (!) serve as a seat of government. Its place in the economic and
political (and social) structure of the world is fixed; it may well have been
fixed at the dawn of the planet\'s history. Within each arcology, subsections
are fixed in their operations and statuses as well; this could be more or less
socially stratified in addition to being tightly organized for production 
purposes. 

The FT differs from the company world in that the latter employ people and
are contracted to take care of their dependents, and the former consider
all inhabitants to be employees, with known duties and responsibilities
from birth to death. No one questions the system or attempts to redefine
the placement or importance of an arcology; such is the stuff of civil war.
The FT differs from democracies in that there is no guarantee of individual
rights or mobility (up/down or laterally) for most citizens. Essentially
the idea is of a closed, efficient society that operates like a well-oiled
machine. (Outside ideas are discouraged as destabilizing in most cases.)

For Traveller, I use the old 15mm figures produced by Citadel.  I also have
a few Laserburn figures, and a set of Martian Metals Zhodani (which don\'t
look much like "official" Zhodani - no beards or turbans :-) .  The Laserburn
ones are the most human-looking, unless you assume the Citadel ones are
wearing very heavy clothing (cloth armour, perhaps).  Using the 15mm figures
means I can use 15mm deck plans with them.

Someone else asked about vehicles.  25mm works out as about 1/72 scale, which
means you can use 1/72 scale model vehicles, with a bit of customising.  Or
you can build your own.  One vehicle I made was an Imperial grav APC.  I
used the chassis of a HO scale Chieftain tank, with the suspension area covered
over with some plastic card, along with the turret from a M-24 Chaffee tank.
I took the Chieftain\'s gun barrel, cut it in half, and glued one half to
the M-24\'s turret.  The Chieftain\'s gun barrel has a thick section just over
halfway along; that part became the muzzle of my APC\'s gun.  The result looks
quite impressive, especially as I use it with my 15mm figures.  The big idea
of this vehicle was to let the players know that if their characters got too
rowdy, there was something bigger and meaner than them, and this was it!

Some of West End\'s Star Wars figures would be suitable for Traveller - in
fact, the Imperial officer looks almost exactly like my 15mm officer figure
from Citadel.

And if this is anything to do with the PBEM military game, I\'ll use the
Darth Vader figure.  :-)

True.  It\'s been about 15 years.  However, I think I\'ve been doing a
fair job of following the technology in literature ("Jane\'s", and other
places).

This may all be well and good for roadmarches at night, but for advance
recon in the dark, NVS isn\'t worth diddly.  Peripheral vision is critical
(hearing is even more importmant, but that\'s another story).  Every time
I ever tried this, we usually ended up on our bellies (or hands and knees
at least), feeling our way along, so as not to snap any sticks or rustle
too many leaves.  If the foliage is thick, the problem is worse and NVS
is even less effective.  BTW, you know that objects tend to be more visible
in your peripheral vision in the dark, than when directly faced.  This is
because the cones (color receptors) in the eyes are clustered near the
center of the eye, whereas the rods (B&W intensity receptors) are dispersed
around the perimeter.

Until NVS and thermals are reduced to the size (and weight) of wrap-around

I don\'t have any experience with personal military commo sets (all they
teach us USMC bottom-of-the-food-chain types are hand signals :-)), but
I can\'t believe the RadioShack VOX headsets are better.  I own two of them
(I used them to talk to the pit when I was Events Coordinator for the
Oregon Int\'l Airshow, years ago).  They have a max. LOS range of 1/2 mile,
and less than 1/4 mile in trees.  Add to that, the fact that the little
whip antenna gets tangled in everything, and the VOX trigger requires that
you speak fairly loud before it kicks in.  It also tends to get activated
inadvertently by other loud noises (gunfire comes to mind).  It\'s bad
enough having to listen to the cacophony of a firefight, without hearing
it repeated and amplified in your radio headset!  ("Jonesy!!  Open fire!!"
"What?" "Open Fire!!" "WHAT?!" "OPEN FIRE!!" "Hold on while I turn off
my radio!  I can\'t hear you over the gunfire!!") :-)

Agreed.  This is the Sentry/Sniper position I mentioned (above).  Also,
this assumes little cover/clear terrain.  Try this in the \'Nam and you\'ll
get your head handed to you.

As I understand it, it\'s where the community is dependant on something,
e.g. vacc suits on an airless world, water on a desert world, cars on a
world where the population is small and scattered.  The ruling elite are
the ones who control the key commodity.  Imagine Dune with the Fremen
taking complete control of the universe, due to their monopoly of melange.

A while ago, someone said the fusion rocket is impossible:  exhaust velocity
would have to be greater than speed of light.

Actually, as v goes to c, mass increases, thaerefore you can get any momentum
you want to if your exhaust goes relativistic.

According to JTAS 8 or so, Jack-o-T meant your back ground concerning your
other skills was extremely broad.  You could perform tasks related to ones
you had mastered in a manner similar to Instruction skill

ie if you have Pilot-3 and Jack-o-T-3 you can perform as a Navigator-2
 or Engineering-2 Jack-o-T-1, you can perform at Electronic-0, mech-0, etc

The example in the Journal of TAS 8 or maybe 12? was Truck driver flying a
Air/Raft.

Does this definition still apply?  Or has it been supplanted by new def?
I used to have a Physics-3 Jack-o-T-3 character, therefore Chem-2, Bio-1,
Astronomy-2, Computer-2 etc.

That is how I use Jack-T skill, anyone else?


One last note,

A couple of months ago I  was babysitting my nephew 4 yrs old, and ran accross
a Children\'s cartoon where the villans are A VARGR CORSAIR BAND.

No doubt about it, admittedly they fly TL-5 - TL6 airplanes, but they act as
corsairs (animated wolves)

I started watching this cartoon (it is pretty funny some times, awful at
others) until I saw th pilot.

The Pilot is an adaptation of THE TRAVELLER ADVENTURE, yes Cargo pilot
and pirate band defector team up with megacorp to stop Corsair band from
obtaining spinal mount!  How do they do it?  By stealing a crystal!!!!!

Unfortunately the corsairs, led by the Fabulous Don Carnage (roll the R...)
are not always on the scene.  There are some bad episodes.  (What do you
want it\'s a kids afternoon cartoon)  And the Corsairs follow the best
traditions of inept cartoon bad guys, but Don Carnage is the stereotypical
Vargr Ship captain

	"uhh captain?... we were wondering..."
Carnage:  "Speak up my door is always open sometimes..."

	Uhhh well we don\'t understand your latest plan..."

Carnage:  "That is why I am in charge and you are bit players!"

Carnage"  "Oh, did I hurt your feelings?"

	Murmers of assent

Carnage:   "Good!  This is all part of my master plan...."

etc.

Anyway, This is OBVIOUSLY inspired by Traveller, and I thought I should 
tell you about it.  Please don\'t accuse me of watching silly kids cartoons
without good reason.

Yes it is set @ TL5 or6 but it is Trav

enough rambling

Yes.  I had a group of PC\'s who were mercenaries, and who were involved in
a big war on some planet.  There were several actions going on at once; the
PC\'s were only involved in one.  I used "Book 4 - Mercenary" and its abstract
system to handle all the other fights, and ran the PC\'s battle directly.  (If
I did "The Longest Day", I\'d have use Book 4 on all beaches except Omaha, and
run that one directly.  If I were in a good mood, maybe I\'d let the PC\'s be
on a different beach.)  After the whole thing was over, there was a debriefing
in which the commanders of various units discussed their parts in the whole
thing.  One was proudly describing how his forces had shot down a Zhodani
fighter, although he didn\'t know what the Zhodani were doing there.  The PC
commander chose not to reveal that he had been using a captured Zho fighter
which he allowed to stray from his battle area.

number of good single figures.  RAFM also has a few really excellent

produced a excellent set of figures for 25mm (unfortunately these are hard
to come by now as they are out of production).  Many of the Warhammer 40K
figures are also usable in Traveller.  You can also look for a return
sometime in the future of the Traveller figures.

As for vehicles well you just have to make your own.  Your best bet is to
shop at various stores for acceptable source material.  Packaging material
can make some great vehicles with a little imagination and also works well
for futuristic buildings.  My wife has given up on asking why I keep
anything anymore.  Frank Chadwick is using Leggs panty hose containers for
25mm landers (he made balsa legs for them).  I am collecting deodorant
containers for my landers.  I even found one package in the trash here a
work that looks exactly like a small shuttle.  There are also a number of
the smaller G.I Joe vehicles that work fairly well for 25mm with a minimum
of conversion.  Other sources are old model kits.  The Starwars line
actually had several 25mm kits (the A wing and X wing).  Check your local
Toys R Us for what is on sale and then use your imagination.  The Expanders
vehicles are often on sale and while they are not a constant scale for the
figures they are excellent starting places for parts.

For my 25mm unit I am using the following: one each of the battletech
packs for main line infantry.  Several of the single figure battletech or
RAFM figures for commanders.  The APC will be a G.I.Joe vehicle that was an
AA rocket launcher thing with the rockets cut off an the figure seat
covered over (this gives a real nice APC with a fighting compartment on
top). Artillery is from another G.I.Joe vehicle that had this cherry picker
gun assembly (gun removed made a nice futuristic artillery piece).  G.I.Joe
vehicles were on sale for less than $3 at the local mall toy store.  Air
support will be Starwars A wings (which I overbought when I was making my
15mm Striker company about eight years ago).

I might conjecture that the limiting component regarding radiation hardening
would be the human inside.  I\'m thinking more along the lines of the possible
source of the EMP vice the EMP itself.

True enough Mark.  Though I think and individual SINS is a bit much.  All the
soldier needs (and this was used in Desert Storm) is a receiver that picks
up the satellite signals that then correlate to a given position.  Any 
reasonable tech level world would have such a system.  For an invasion force
from off world, it would be prudent to deploy such a system as part of the
invasion itself!  The idea here is less moving parts and most likely less 
bulky that an individual gyro.  Plus, it would be more stable from an
individual point of view.

I think too much credit is given MilSpecs.  The thing to always remember is
that the enemy is just a step behind you and in some cases ahead of you.  In
other words, you design something with lower leakage, then I design a detector
with increased sensitivity.

Solomani scientists.  And as a scientist myself, I can tell you
that the value systems and judgements of the investigators are
nearly always reflected in their work.  Look at all of human
sociology prior to old calender 1960 (solomani dating) it shows all
kinds of internal prejudices, which are now being focused outward
to the rest of the galaxy.

Particullarly against the Vargr.

If we ever get back to TDR, the full range of \'tech improved\' components 
will obviously have to address computers.  I tried to fit that hand computer
into a draft chart for computer size/weight by TL, and there was no way
to get it to fit in reasonably.  My temporary solution is to ignore the
line that says that it is equivalent to a Model 1.  If we do decrease
computer size/weight/cost with increasing tech level, there will be one
immediately apparent effect on the game--TL14/15 merchant ships will easily
be able to mount Comp 5,6,or 7, making piracy and so forth, especially
by lower tech ships, even more unviable than it is already.  Vargr corsairs

Maybe so...but it also does twice the damage of a pulse laser with the
same energy consumption, which is good enough for me (at least right now.)

No.  The problem, as described to me (and this was Dow Rieder\'s calculation),
is that you are limited by the amount of energy contained in that quantity
of hydrogen you are fusing.  So, most of our propulsion systems are terrible
energy sinks, but we also have the fusion rocket, which not only uses a fusion
process orders of magnitude better than our power reactors, but also lets us
take power out rather than putting power in...that\'s the problem.

The definition of JOAT according to the rules is that it does little except
represent your \'resourcefulness\' with the other skills you already have.
This is done by allowing you extra tries at performing a task without
imposing the \'determination\' checks and corresponding increases in task
difficulty that would otherwise occur.  No "everything=JOAT-1" any more.

   I have always thought that this system might evolve
after a world undergoes some type of cataclysm (war,
plague, asteroid strike, etc) which causes a general
collapse of its dominate culture. The world in question
undergoes a general depopulation. First there is the 
diaster which causes the chaos and then there is the
"After kill" which is worse in many ways. Civilized
socities create many structures to sustain life -
food distribution, hospitals, police, etc. As these
structures are overwhelmed, the outlook for the 
population looks grim. 
   At some point if the world has not been rendered
completely uninhabitable, there is a rebound of sorts.
The afterkill creates a situation where there are 
still too many mouths to feed but not by a factor of
thousands. Civilization begins again but there are major
changes. Skills that once common were replaced by
technology and have to be re-learned. (Imagine an 
empty headed valley-girl trying to shoe a horse)
There is technology left over but those skills are
also forgotten except by a few. This "few" soon becomes
an economic force. Over several generations, it
is easy to see how they would become a major economic
force.
   As the years pass after the diaster which laid waste 
to the world, the lack of education and social structure
causes the people to revert back to a more primative
level. Those who have technology and the skills to use
it evolve into a "priesthood". I use the word priesthood
with care: I don\'t mean to imply that a cult will grow
around technology users but it could very well be the case.
(see below)
   The type of technology the ruling elite use will have
a major impact on the society. A clan of engineers sitting
on a fusion reactor would be very differant from the 
decendants of doctors keeping a hospital going. In both
cases they are in a unique economic position offering
a service that can\'t be had elsewhere. These groups will
likely be very rich (relatively speaking- remember they
are the decendants of a collapsed society) and willing
to fight against challenges to their position.
   Another angle of particular importance to explore is
what the common people think about the collapsed culture.
They may revere the "Old Ones" as Gods or revile them
for bringing down the wrath of an angry God". In both cases
it will have a major bearing on how the technology using
and non-technology using cultures interact. In such settings
it is not unthinkable that many religious sects may pop up.
There may well be distrust and open warfare between the
primatives and technology users (witches). This is 
fertile ground for the Game Master and can lead to some 
very interesting situations. There are many books and
films based on similar themes. Several episodes of Dr. Who
come to mind.

    'body' => 'Inspired by Bertil\'s recent post on how to do D-Day, the Gulf War, and
some previous thinking of my own, I present the following for discussion:


                  LARGE SCALE WARFARE IN THE IMPERIUM

     In  light of the recent reconquest of Kuwait, I would like to  take 
the  opportunity to consider warfare in the far future depicted by  Tra-
veller.   I  am  posting this to the list in hope of  stirring  up  some 
debate  on the topic.  Who knows?  If we come up with a consensus,  per-
haps we can submit to the Journal or Challenge...

     From my point of view, the most interesting aspects of the Gulf War 
as  applied to Traveller were the incredible pace of operations and  the 
potential  increase in real-time tactical intelligence due to  sophisti-
cated sensor systems.  As Traveller depicts the development of technolo-
gy, it seems that these trends can only continue.

     Let\'s  look  first at the \'total war\' scenario as it applies  to  a 
planetary  assault against a stellar technology planet.  Planets of  TL8 
and below, and low population planets are automatically at the mercy  of 
any  attacking force.  Why would you assault a planet at all?   For  the 
same  reason  that we still have ground forces in  the  nuclear  age...a 
demand to surrender or be bombarded into oblivion is not always believa-
ble.   A planetary assault would only occur during deliberate  offensive 
operations  aimed  at  capturing territory.  During a  raid  into  enemy 
territory,  with  no short-term intent to govern the population  of  the 
target  planet, bombardment _would_ be preferred. Under limited  circum-
stances  a ground raid to capture specific removable  objectives  (data, 
personnel,  or prototypes) might be considered, but it would have to  be 
small  scale  to permit a stealthy approach. A stealthy approach  for  a 
large raid is not generally possible, though the possibility would exist 
for  regiments or divisions to be deployed by black globe  using  dread-
noughts.

     An  attacking fleet jumps into a system as a fairly  compact  unit.  
The  local  forces will learn of its existence in hours at  the  latest, 
depending  on  the location of the appearance.  If they  are  scattered, 
they will attempt to withdraw, attempt to combine, or engage  piecemeal, 
depending on their commander\'s assessment of the relative strengths.  In 
any  case, a superior attacker can proceed to the main  world,  possibly 
refueling  on the way if the configuration of the planets and the  enemy 
fleets  permits,  possibly  reduced by combat if the  enemy  elected  to 
engage.   In  any  case, the mainworld will be  warned.   The  planetary 
defenses  will stand ready, deep meson gun sites prepared to fire,  grav 
craft dispersed and moving or hidden in the oceans or deep bunkers as  a 
reserve.  As the fleet approaches the planet, all craft in orbit will be 
detected  and  identified.  Deception will be difficult  or  impossible. 
Cheap  drones emitting the electromagnetic signature of important  craft 
may  be deployed to confuse the attacker\'s perception of where the  tar-
gets  are,  but there will be no way to hide where  the  defenders  _are 
not_.   Drones are a two edged sword, for the attacker will use as  well 
in the next phase.  Prepared for the planetary meson guns, the attacking 
fleet does not hazard the largest ships against them.  Instead they rely 
on  saturating the defenses with numerous smaller craft  and/or  drones.  
Some  will  be lost to meson gun fire, some to ground based  lasers  and 
missiles.   Many will get through, and most of them will carry  substan-
tial  sensor suites, jam-proof maser communicators, and enough  tactical 
computing  power  to pass the reconnaissance information to  the  combat 
control  center(s).  If the defender\'s deception plan has been  success-
ful,  defending grav craft will outnumber and defeat the attackers.   If 
not,  the skies above the planet will soon belong to the  attacker.   In 
either  case, this phase of operations will be comparatively  short  and 
extremely rapid.  Logistics will not be a consideration when almost  all 
craft  are  armed with energy weapons requiring no ammunition  and  have 
fuel  for days or weeks of continuous operation.  The entire  atmosphere 
and  close  orbit space will be an enormous swirling dogfight  as  craft 
engage at hundred of kilometers at speeds of thousands of kilometers per 
hour.  Infantry, even when equipped with battledress and grav belts will 
have  no  place in this phase of operations.  Their  individual  weapons 
will not affect grav combat vehicles, there will be no pressing need  to 
assault immobile positions until the \'dogfight\' is over, and they  would 
be vulnerable while riding in their carriers for no gain.  It is  possi-
ble  that infantry carriers might deploy with the assault wave  to  take 
advantage of the saturation, and then ground and spread out to await the 
next  phase.  Ground mobile forces will also have little place  in  this 
combat except to fire at anyone coming within their immobile reach.   If 
the defending grav forces are defeated, their ground forces will rapidly 
be destroyed as the highly mobile attackers can concentrate on them  one 
at  a  time.   The attackers will make a special effort  to  target  any 
immobile  communication  and sensor facilities that  are  detected...al-
though a deep meson gun site may have multiple sensor and  communication 
relay  stations, without the use of meson communicators the  final  link 
must  be immobile, though perhaps concealed and well  hardened.   (Meson 
communicators  will allow the deep site spotters to be mobile and  main-
tain communications through the ground without the use of surface  level 
relay points.) (A deep meson gun site should be buried below the maximum 
resolution  level of the enemy\'s densitometers, which is  one  kilometer 
for  a TL15 invader.  The existence of TL16 sensor-building  planets  at 
the  Imperial Core just prior to the outbreak of the Civil War has  pre-
sumably rendered sites buried to the 1km minimum obsolete.) Both combat-
ants  will attempt to attack as many of the enemy\'s most capable  sensor 
platforms  as  possible, but the size and power TL14+ sensors  makes  it 
easy  enough for every grav tank to be its own Gulf War  J-STARS  system 
equivalent.   If  the defender has concealed assets at the  end  of  the 
\'dogfight\' phase, they may now be cut off from central command, and will 
probably  lack the opportunity for large scale surprise.   Trading  them 
one  for  one for attacker forces would probably gain  nothing  at  this 
point;  better  on a strategic level, though not  necessarily  for  this 
planet,  to leave them concealed to strike when the attacker  has  with-
drawn most of his assault forces for the next operation, or to at  least 
force the attacker to devote resources to tracking them down one by one.

     After the \'dogfight\' comes the \'mop-up\'.  Immobile defending  posi-
tions are assaulted as soon as overwhelming force can be brought to bear 
against  them.  Limited force, in the form of infantry with very  selec-
tive  direct fire support, might be used against targets which  the  at-
tacker  desired to capture intact, or where collateral damage is  to  be 
avoided,  such as cities--it has already been mentioned that an  assault 
would only be ordered with an intent to capture, so it is to be  assumed 
that  these  target would exist.  With his mobile  forces  destroyed  or 
otherwise  neutralized, each of these targets/force concentrations  will 
be isolated.  Surrender and sabotage of valuable targets to deny them to 
the attackers might be common in this phase, since the conclusion is not 
certain.   The defenders will lose unless assisted by an outside  force.  
If  such an outside force exists, they may hold out for a  while.   This 
phase  will certainly be longer than the \'dogfight\', as it  may  involve 
house  to  house searches of a city until the defenders  give  up.   Any 
remaining  defender  heavy weapons will be at a severe  disadvantage  in 
this phase, since the attackers sensor superiority will be so pronounced 
that  they  will  probably not survive for multiple  shots  after  being 
revealed,  at least as long as the attacker has thoroughly  covered  the 
area with his own heavy weapons.

     After  the final formal surrender will be the  \'occupation\'  phase. 
Guerrilla  resistance  will be made difficult by the  sensor  imbalance.  
The existence of the advanced sensors postulated in the game would  seem 
to make counterinsurgency trivial for a high-tech attacker.  A guerrilla 
attack  occurs,  using  weapons hidden and not  discovered  in  searches 
during the \'mop-up\' phase.  The attacker is immediately alerted,  either 
by  jam-proof communications or by the sudden appearance of  jamming  on 
the  passive sensor network.  A grav mounted rapid response  force  sur-
round the area, sets up a sensor interdiction perimeter, and attacks any 
immediately  detectable  enemy forces.  Civilian movement  will  be  re-
stricted, brutally if necessary (Warning! All grav craft over the  East-
ern  Continent ground within 5 seconds or you _will be destroyed_).   No 
guerrillas  will  be able to filter through the  sensor  perimeter  with 
their  weapons, although they may abandon them and escape  as  civilians 
unarmed.  There will be limits to their weapons supplies, and enough  of 
this  will  render  them harmless.  If a group does attack  or  jam  the 
sensors  in  the  course of an escape, another response  team  could  be 
called.  Enough guerrillas could saturate the response teams, but  over-
all I think that guerrilla losses would be prohibitive.

   Ruling a hostile population, and one perhaps made more hostile by the 
measures necessary to suppress any large scale guerrilla activity  would 
be  a  difficult (if not formidable task), but it has  been  managed  on 
Earth  with a far less overwhelming superiority on the part of  the  at-
tackers.

   As I said at the beginning, I\'m trying to extrapolate what the situa-
tion would look like with fast, highly capable craft which can attack at 
very  long distances by current standards.  If there is any interest  in 
this, we can discuss what the \'view from the cockpit\' might look like at 
different levels on each side of this sort of operation, as well as what 
it would look like to non-combatants on the ground.

Good Folks,

I was in my local Games Shop here in the UK on Saturday  and
noticed  a  boxed  computer game, MegaTraveller, The Zhodani
Conspiracy (or something like that) - sitting on the  shelf.
Looking  at  the  box art and screen images on the back, the
game would, at first sight, appear to be worth  buying,  but
this  *could*  be the usual marketing hype you normally find
with computer software.

My question therefore is quite simple  :  has  anyone  tried
this software out ? If so, what are your thoughts, opinions,
omments ? Is it worth parting with a few million credits to
buy it ?

Apologies to the TML  if  this  question  has  already  been
answered.

All the best everybody.

Hugh.

Interesting... a few comments.
 
The Desert Storm analogy can be pushed even further... remember that the sortie
rate over Iraq was only about 2000/day, and a single Scout/Courier with a pulse
laser can hit more than that number of targets daily.  A small invasion force
relative to the planet\'s size (population) will have the same effect as DS\'s
attacks; over a period of weeks, total descruction of transportation, air/
space assets, hardened bunkers etc.  A large one will do it in days.  A really
intense attack can do it in a matter of hours.
        I can see an attacking force holding at altitude 10-50,000 km and
establishing a free-fire zone against planetary defense craft and ground
facilities, while doing realtime recon/intel/targeting which would feed into
a ground targets list which was hitting things within minutes of their being
identified as targets.  As soon as planetary defences are out, the task force
would approach closer and drop troops and concentrate on battlefield support...
imagine a intel/targeting system good enough that a trooper with a rifle can
be identified and targeted from orbit... it would be possible and practical
on these scales...

(This is about the support vehicle you introduced

"Phalanx" seems like a weak euphamism.  I see a single support
vehicle of this kind cutting a swath that pales Sherman\'s
march to the sea.  And leaves it radioactive, too.  Let\'s
rename this the "Basalt-making Battalion Batterer" or something
like that.

Actually, I find your prediction of technological march to
horrifyingly true to want to deal with a vehicle like this.
OK, Mark, Bertil, Marc--how would the poor slag er "ground"

	An interesting thought occured to me yesterday when I was working with
a friend on a car of his.  He had put a new engine in it and was putting in a
carberator (sp?) for racing when I asked him why he didn\'t use fuel injection.
He stated that although fuel injection was all fine and dandy it was a pain to
fix and in the last couple of years, carbs have greatly increased in performance
and durability.  Now, most of you ask what this has to do with traveller, let me
give you two examples below:

	Sharek popped open the engine compartment of his new air/raft.
	It was a beauty, brand new technology on his TL15 world it used
	the latest in technology.  Its power output was much higher than
	the old ones and it grav system just new of the drawing boards.
	HOWEVER the warning light had just come on and it had coasted to
	a landing in the sandy desert.  He looked at the power plant, a
	jumbled mass of control circuits and tubing, he couldn\'t even 
	begin to fanthom it without his gravitics kit.  The instruction
	manual, claiming that the engine was too complicated unless 
	specially trained, only said "call nearest service center".
	Sharek looked up at the approaching storm, "Uh-oh."

Now a different example.

	Sharek popped open the engine hatch of his "Safarimaster" air/raft
	although not the most sophisticated model, it had stood up to the
	test of time using mostly components invented around TL12, 150 years
	ago on his planet.  He stared down at the power plant, it was large
	and flat and was a mass of square modules each coded in one of ten
	colors.  Because of refinements to the equipment over the years the
	control chips had all been standardized into ten sorts and coded, 
	plus many of the systems were redundant.  A small square turned blace
	in the top right corner if it had burned out.  Sharek scanned the
	power plant for a moment before finding the bad module.  A red module
	had burnt out, he quickly reached over and took one from the "spares"
	holder mounted on the side of the compartment.  Pushing the reset 
	button, he heard the powerplant come to life and shut the hatch.  All
	green light appeared on the display panel.  He quickly lifted the 
	air/raft off the ground and sped towards home.  He chuckled as he
	looked over his shoulder, the storm would be 1000km behind him by 
	the time he reached home.`

	As you can see from the examples, old technology at a higher tech level
might be desirable.  Why that old laser pistol, first available at TL8 but build
at TL15, might be usable right after it is wiped off after being dragged from
that hole after 10 years.
	In game terms this would mean there would be 2 tech levels for every
item, ship, etc., one for when it became available and one for when it was built.  Although this (slightly) increases paperwork and records, it also is very
handy as a game tool.  Bob\'s brand new laser rifle might shoot for more damage,
but probably John\'s older, more proven, one will probably shoot longer with less
maintenance.  
	For planyer this means:  A) that they will recieve a plus on the die for
the difference between the techs.  B)  They will be able to smuggle in goods to
TL restricted worlds without it being so noticeable.  "Commander Vrog, the 
rebels seem to have the same rifle we do, but they never seem to require 
maintenance and can constantly be abused without breaking".
	What is everyone elses opinion on this?

Wellll... (sorry this is so long)
I got it for the Amiga about a week or so ago.  It plays well.
It\'s fun.  I could get addicted; then you\'d NEVER see a PBEM 
turn again.  :=)  Actually, here\'s a more serious review:

Hosts: I *know* this came out for PC\'s and compatibles first,
       but I haven\'t seen it played on one.  The version I
       have is for an Amiga.   While it handles other processes
       running concurrently, it doesn\'t use multi-tasking
       advantageously.  No surprise.  The screens are mainly
       overhead view things.  Look like about EGA quality for
       smoother movements.  Sounds are fairly limited.  Again
       no surprise, but I\'d rather have a fun game with
       limits on the bells and whistles.

       You might want to find out a little more from someone 
       who has a copy running on the same host you\'re planning
       to buy for.  If it\'s PC, I understand a second adventure
       is out already, too.

Docs:  The manual goes into great lengths explaining MT, the
       various races, the various craft, weapons, skills etc.
       and leaves out lots of information that would be really
       useful to someone who knows MT and wants to know how 
       they implemented it on the machine.

       For example, here is the description of the skill "Tactics":

          The character is experienced in small unit tactics.
       
       What does this mean?  We know, because we\'re MT\'ers, that
       in the game, tactics modifies the party\'s reaction time
       for surprise value, and the skill level is a die modifier
       on a difficult task.  It would be nice if the game writers
       would tell us what things *mean* for play.

Characters:  You get a party of five characters (or less).  With
       them you must fight, learn, fly, and all the other associated
       MT activities.  Character generation is pretty good.  At
       least you have the option of infanticide before trying
       to enlist that 35453B brat.  :=)  Make sure *all* your
       characters have a vacc suit and gun of some kind before
       you start the game, though.

Play:  It took me about four days to learn the basic interface.
       :=(  It is one of the most frustrating things I\'ve
       ever tried with a computer.  Better docs would have
       helped.  Now that I know it, it sorta makes sense.  The
       Ami version has the "old" interface with the real-time
       combat (which I don\'t find that bad) and an in-system
       flight thing that is heinous.  Gravity don\'t work that
       way folks!  The planets you want to get to are all 
       ringed by unbelievably dense asteroids capable of 
       sending your ship into the void, at maximum opposing
       thrust.  I heard the PC version is better.

Overall: I really like it, despite it\'s shortcomings.  It\'s
       about time we had a computer game that at least 
       tried to get the flavor of MT.  With "The Zhodani
       Conspiracy" we might not have the full flavor yet,
       but we certainly have some nice aromas from the kitchen.

I was pleased to see that there was a Traveller Q&A today (though less so 
when I got there at 10 and it was at 3--not much to do in between).

I\'ll post more on this later next week, but I should mention that there is
another on Saturday, and I expect I\'ll have the chance to read my mail Saturday
morning before I go.  If you have any <silly> questions you want relayed,
send them to me by private email to avoid cluttering the list.

Panel members were Tom Peters, Charles E. Gannon (introduced as Challenge
MT coordinator), and Marc Miller.  They mentioned that GDW is pledged to 
increase MT support in the near future (a little infighting there?), and the
projected products include an Equipment Guide, something called Hard Times,
which will discuss the technicalities of the decay, Diaspora (modern equivalent
of an old style sector sourcbook), and
Star Viking.  This last is apparently
almost intended to be a separate game,
and its theme should be clear to any
reader of Piper\'s _Space Viking_.

Miller comments noted:  DGP and MTJ are gospel, Challenge is \'sort of
unofficial unless collected elsewhere\'.  Piper was indeed a primary inspiration
for all of Traveller----so read anything of his you can find for the \'authentic
look and feel\' of Traveller.  Aslan
can sublimate their desire for land pretty well, so airless rockballs 
aren\'t safe. (-8  The shattering is
permanent for the forseeable future.
Traveller has definitely evolved in concept--as I suspected the Kinunir
was a battle cruiser (1250t) because
that was a reasonable name for something that size when 5000t was maximum.

That\'s all for now...

Hi Jo
 
I would love to test/review this software, sounds great. For transmission
I suggest you compress, convert to ascii, split then send.
 
Compress - you can use the unix compression utils called compress or use
a PC based one such as lharc, pkzip etc.
 
ascii - convert to ascii for transmission over email. Use Unix uuencode
or PC based boo utility.
 
split - max size of files over email is usually 100000 bytes so use unix
split utility to split if file is over this size.
 
Cheers
 
Paul.

I meant to say more about my sub but the Ducvax is having troubles(Me too)

Patton:  Fixed fortifications are a monument to the stupidity of man

Translation:  A fixed deep meson site is a dead meson site.

If you want to have your meson gun survive the first few minutes, you need
it to be mobile.  Any good intelligence team would recon the location of a
defence site before any invasion started.  It would be the first target put
into the invaders computers long before they even jumped in system.

Solution:  Mobile meson guns.  As a sub with 2km of water over head,
densiometers are going to have a tough time.  Its the same over all density
as the water around it.  It\'s on the sea bottom connected to a geothermal
plant in the sea bed.  No neutrino emmisions.  If they want to move it,
use the meson boiler powered by another sub and move them in leap frog
fashion.  The crew could have a choice of several geothermal stations
to get power from thus an attacking fleet won\'t have a clue where they are.
You have Passive sensor modules disguised as civilian g-carriers all over
the planet these transmit data via meson communicators (No body knows about
these...) I will post one in the near future.

OK suppose a starship enters the water...  I have not seen ONE ship designed
with a sonar set.  NOT ONE.   (Hint)

A sub, especially at low tech makes the best SDB (See my designs of the
Soviet missile sub Typhoon class @TL8, and the US missile sub Lafayette)
just fix \'em up with surface to orbi missiles instead of ICBMS and that\'s
what you have to fight with.(Lafayette=TL7)


The Herbert Dean class sub is operational in the seas of Regina and saw action
in the 5F War, the Zhodani assault used psionics to aid in the location of the
sites and sank one ship.   Since then the ships are being equipped with psi
shielding in the hulls as part of the PDI (Psionic Defence Initiative)

The subs spend most of their time on patrol resulting in somewhat lower
morale than the rest of the SDB contingients.  Thus they are equipped with
sufficient low berths to allow for crew members to spend less time being
bored without so much as a window to look out of, than they would normally
have to on what is normally a 1 year mission.

	(US sub crews spend 6 months (?) and in comparison to other SDB crews
who can afford to land for fuel and supplies every month life on the Herbert
Dean is pretty SLOW.  No interceptions to be made, little or no movement
(Every time they change location they are subject to tracking) Just sit on
the bottom and wait for the invasion.  Even Deep meson site crews go home
at night (course they\'ll be on the moon first when it hits the fan...)

I had trouble figuring the speed out, but she\'s a purpose designed sub (even
if it doesn\'t have ballest tanks) so the depth given is for subs not ships
Acoustic Sig=Strong? With a very quiet fusion reactor, grav drives and
anechroic coating?  What do you say George?  I\'m not so sure
I would say that an MHD drive would lower acoustic sig and your notes don\'t
say anything about that.  Also I know that speed of a craft destroys sonar
readings but I have no idea how much or at what speed.  (please Help)

All of you who may be concerned about me desigining mountains of stuff..
relax I got too much work to do (but it\'s a holiday so I got a little time)

Here is a vehicle I was requested to turn out (yes I take requests)

Deuterium Cargo/Fuel Transporter

	The Deuterium class transport is a common sight around starports
where pilots are nervous about some nut in a g-carrier ramming into the
side of their ships.  
(I sure wouldn\'t want a helicopter refueling aircraft at the airport
I fly at!!!!)

Hull:		(14/34) Disp=15, Config=4USL, ARmor=3G, Unload=32.6,
		Load=195.6 //as fuel transport Load=46.8

At TL13 weight is +1 ton and reduce speeds by 10kph,

The Deuterium class transport can handle 12 disp tons of cargo easily, and is
often the loading vehicle for starships handling standard cargo bins.  It is
most often seen around starports or making deliveries in or around cities
It is cheaper than a grav vehicle of equal capacity and for short to medium
distances it is more economical and just as fast.  (Imagine flying a grav
vehicle through crouded airspace say like...Washington where there are 3
MAJOR airports all within a stones throw?)  When a delivery takes 2 hours
for large bins of cargo, who cares if it could be done a little faster?
in commercial terms the time saved is not worth the extra effort or cost
	You want it faster?  Then use a special grav transport and double
the freight costs.
	Most of the componants of the transport are TL13 only the hull is
TL14 and many componants are less than TL13.
	For safety\'s sake (lots a lawyers on high tech worlds) the vehicle is
equipped with 2 radar systems for anti collision warnings, Plus active IR
vision relays in the rear of the truck for watching those tight turns and
lane changes.  It has a Slave unit so that the vehicle could be operated by a traffic control net should that be required by local law.  Often times a robot
system will be used (theres one in 101 robots) in place of a sentient driver
to insure safe consistant driving.
	It has environment control for the cargo bay enabling it to be used
for perishable cargoes and as a ground fuel truck.
(Watch the speeds boys you\'re carrying 12 tons of liquid hydrogen...)  The
speeds listed are Possible speeds (I wouldn\'t want to drive offroad at
72kph with a load of liquid HYDROGEN!!!!

  Even though I know that I\'m going awfully close to the edge of the TML charter
I have to comment that the Gulf war wasn\'t a normal war in any way. There were a
long undisturbed buildup, a long undisturbed air campaign and the climate and
geography were ideal for high-tech warfare. 

>      An  attacking fleet jumps into a system as a fairly  compact  unit.  

  Not nessesarily. Even during the best of circumstances, the fleet will be
spread out quite thinly in both time and space.
  1. Time: A normal jump takes 124+2D*6 h. The fleet will arrive gradually 
           during several days. If the transports arrive before the escort,
	   this could spell a major fiasco.
  2. Space: No matter how smart the navigators and how skilfull the engineers,
	    one ship in thirtysix will still make a misjump that can add to
	    the error in time or add a new error in space.

  Taken as a whole, the safest way would be for the fleet to aim at some quiet
corner of the target system and spend a few days reorganizing itself before
proceeding inwards.

  (Coming to think about it, this error might be the big reason behind the
success of the carrier batrons, because they are guaranteed to arrive as a unit,
contrary to a group of battleships. Something to think about for an as anti-
carrier pro-battleship type as myself:)

> The  local  forces will learn of its existence in hours at  the  latest, 

  A system has no outer limit except the limit imposed by fuel. The range of
sensors is the big unknown in this equation, because they seem to have a far
shorter range when used in combat compared to what\'s in the design specs.
  I suspect that if someone tried to unload a sensor with an advertised range
of Interstellar that can only discover ships at around 400000km on the IN, the
Moat would be up in arms.

  Remember that the attacking force have to bring *everything* along. Every
kiloliter of payload that has to be there costs 200kCr(*) (Assuming J3 1G 
unarmed 20kt transports) while the defender can have pre-positioned supplies
all over the system (As can the attacker, strictly speaking, but he might have 
a hard time keeping them secret).

  (I\'m well aware that the attacker probably didn\'t buy all the transport
capacity the day before they set out to conquer their neighbours, But the same
thing applies to the defender. I\'m also aware that the attacker could bring in 
supplies gradually, but a supplyline stretching possibley several jumps is 
extremely vulnurable and keeping it safe would tie up large tonnages. The
attacker will *at least* have to bring enough for 3 weeks of combat, since that
is when the first transport would arrive (Sending transports to a system 
without knowing if the invasion fleet had to beat feet out of there or if they
gained a foothold is not recommended. One risks giving a lot of supply ships 
away to the enemy. I count with one week of fighting, one week to the the
message home and one week for the supply ships to jump back to the target
system.)

  The edge that non-jump ships have over jump capable ships is well known. I\'ll
just repeat that a ship with J4 will have 30% less space for useful things
than the non-jump capable ship. Besides, a jumpdrive costs a lot of money,
money that could be better used for weapons.

  The only advantage that I can see the attacker would have is that his 
forces would be concentrated while the defender would have to guard the entire
system. As shown by history, this might be enough to enable the attacker to win.
\'Win\' in this case means that they reach the mainworld.

  The defending ships have nothing to do in low orbit. They are much more usable
far out in the outer system not for what they can do there but for the threat
they represent there. A threat that will tie up a portion of the attacking
fleet. Any defending ships left on the planet are better off sitting on the 
ground with their powerplants and interior grav off until the attackers are in 
range. The closeness to a major mass, the atmosphere, the powerplants on the 
planet etc all make them much more difficult to detect that way. Add to that 
that the ships can be hidden inside larger structures or below ground.
  
  o Passive energy scans won\'t see them. (It will however get a lot of clutter
from civilian sources)

  o Passive object scan won\'t see them. The figures for passive object scan and
pin used in space combat comes from the densitometer range/resolution tables
column \'smallest object detectable in *open space*\'. Unless the target use
artificial grav which will make it stick out like a sore thumb, the only way
to detect a ship is to recognise it\'s shape and the materials used. And to do
that with any amount of accuracy the sensor needs to be closer than 500km 
(10m resolution) or even 50km (1m resolution). [The attacking ships will on the
other hand be in open space and easy to see].

  o Active object scan probably won\'t see them. To see them it has to use a 
frequency range where the cover the ships have (say metal and concrete) will
let the radiation through, but the ship will reflect it. And as far as I know,
anything that will penetrate metal won\'t be reflected by a ship. The question 
is: Will superdense reflect xrays?:)

  See above. They will only be able to detect what is firing at them. It is
extremely tough to detect a defensive installation that don\'t want to be seen.
I think that a resolution of less than one meter is needed, because they are
as opposed to ships, not made of readily recognizable materials like super-
dense. And if the drones and small-crafts go that close, they\'ll begin to take
fire from the groundforces as well.

  Since the defender have no reductions imposed by logistics (compared to the
attacker at least) they can ripple-fire arbitrarily large amounts of nukes
at the attacking small crafts, most too small to have nuke dampers, since the
larger nuke damper carrying ships are hiding out of range. The attacker can
either and use nukes too (and hope that the defender don\'t have a lot of 
ground-based nuke dampers that work in conjunction with his crafts) which will 
place even greater strain on their transport capacity. Or they can bite the 
sour apple and try to fight it out anyway using only energy weaponry, in which 
case they have a big force multiplier against them.

  A Tech 15 sensor suite capable of doing a passive energy scan and pin as good
as any starship has the following data: 0.232 kl, 111kg, 430kCr. Cheaper than
a suit of battledress. It can be hooked up to the normal power net and 
communicate over the civilian computer network. It is preferrably powered by
batteries or solar cells to make it harder to detect (2.6m2 solar cells) and
for 250kCr extra it can have a 500km meson link.
  
  Sensors such as these (or 1.5MCr more expensive if they shall be able to do
passive object scan/pin) can be hidden literally everywhere. The world might
have a law that every newbuilt house has to have one on the roof. A group of
sensors can be patched in to a computer site. That site is in communication
with a deep relay site (one of many), not directly with the meson pit to
make it impossible for attackers to find out the location of a meson pit by
conquering a sensor or a computer site.

  The sensors are passive, and if they use batteries or solar cells they have
no neutrino signature, and they are hidden among billions of transmitters and
other electronics on the ground. All in all a tough target.

  I\'ve always been sceptical towards the claim that the only way of discovering
the deep meson gun pits is to use densitometers. Since meson guns impacting a
meson screen gives a signature (Digest#6? It\'s the starship issue at least)
that should be enough to triangulate some likely positions, and the planets
transparency to mesons is a two-edged sword... 
  Alternate solutions might be good oldfashioned intelligence work or good
zho-fashioned clairvoyance work:) The attacker might also try to locate the
powerplants that feeds the meson pits with neutrino sensors and blow them
away with their own meson guns. The trouble for the attackers is that they never
can be sure if they have destroyed *all* powerplants and meson pits or if there
are a few left that has been shut down to be undetectable... waiting...

  Groundforces may also use meson communicators to communicate with deep
control sites via deep relay sites. All gravtanks may for example have the 
orders that \'If out of contact with HQ, try contracting these coordinates <list
of a handful of sites> using meson link\'. It would be hard for the enemy to
capture any intact enemy grav-vehicles during the early part of the battle, so
discovery of the relay sites is a minor problem.

  The trouble is that, to quote \'Murphys laws of combat\': \'If the enemy is in
range, so are you.\' If enough large ships come close enough to begin firing at
ground targets the ground targets will begin to fire back. And you can fit more
lasers on a planet than on a whole batron:)

  Small defence weapons can by the way also be deployed as the sensors above.
A small mount with self-contained powerplant and a meson link to a computer 
site in the vicinity along with a number of collegues.  Almost impossible to 
detect until it fires. To protect against visual and active EMS detection it
can be contructed as a pop-up facility.
  [Real-life comment:the Swedish air defence use pop-up radars that are 
supposed to duck down behind heavy blastdoors and several meters of rock if any
ARMs or other missiles are heading their way. Target memory won\'t help a AS-12
Kedge against that.]

  The most effective orbit-to-ground fire support weapon is the meson gun.
With a few forward observers on the ground the attacker can surgically 
annihilate defensive positions. According to Striker a meson gun used against
ground targets have a 100% kill percentage within 100 to 200 meters. The 
defender may however have meson screens. As for the best way of removing a 
defensive installation, I\'d recommend nukes fired using direct fire from so
close that the point defence and nuke dampers never have time to react
(Either 500 meters or 50 meters according to Striker. It\'ll have to be small 
 nukes to fire them at 50 meters:)

  The defenders won\'t move their mobile forces unless the attackers forces them,
because they are much harder to detect if they sit tight (like for ships). So
what the attackers has to do is force the defenders to begin to concentrate 
their forces, and the best way is to open a bridgehead at some lightly defended
part of the planet. The defenders will then have to choose between letting the
landing continue unopposed (and attackers on the ground will be as hard to 
detect for the defenders as defenders on the ground are for the attackers, the
attackers may also start to deploy their own defensive networks etc) or try to 
crush the beachhead with ships, grav-vehicles and ground forces. 
  As those begin to move they will become visible to the attackers who will 
start to attack them from orbit and air, and as the attackers units move into
range for the defensive installation the defender will start to fire back. As
\'new\' defensive installation and units reveal themself the attackers will have 
to attack them as well, to protect their own ships and so it continues.
  If the attackers manage to supress the defensive fire they can go on with
their main mission, which is to destroy the defenders ground forces, otherwise
there will be a \'ground\' (ie gravtanks, gcarriers and infantry) battle where
the defender tries to crush the bridgehead.

  It\'s all a question of if the attacker runs out of ships before the defender
runs out of hidden batteries, since once the attacker knows about the existance
of a battery, he can destroy it if he makes enough of a commitment.
  There is of course also the normal amount of doublecrossing etc where the
defender lets one battery among several fire and when the attacker sends some
ships after it, the others reveal themselves and destroys the ships. And
conversely: the attacker sends down some ships that are shielding what seems
to be several transports, and when the defensive batteries open up, reveal
themselves as cruisers and blows away the batteries.

  I\'ll suspect that when the defenders mobile forces are destroyed, the 
defenders will surrender because they have lost their only way of cutting the
attackers foothold. The situation is comparable to a 20th century nation that
just have had it\'s army, navy and airforce destroyed, but still has some
SAMs and coastal SSMs.

  Densitometer scans will have to have a resolution of less than 20cm, probably
between 5 and 1cm to recognize a weapon. That means a range of less than 500 
meters and a scan dimention of 5m per scan. I\'ve forgot how long a densitometer
scan takes, but it would still be a major undertaking unless the population was
to pass through checkpoints. And scanning the entire countryside is almost out 
of question. And to foul the scan\'s it\'s easy to make another law that every 
house built has to have a bunch of weapons replicas walled up in the cellar:)

  Any sensible non-combatant would hide in a shelter.

  To summarize I don\'t think that the balance between the defender and the 
attacker will change greatly at higher TL. The attacker will have greater
capabilities than today but so will the defender. The best edge is still to
be several times more than the defenders or/and have and edge of one or more
techlevels. And the problem of logistics will still exist and it\'s a big problem
when the nearest source of supply is one jump away. I\'m leaning towards that
it is big enough to make a planetary invasion a *major* undertaking that 
requires the combined resources of a large part of the imperium for a long
time (If the target is Hi In TL14-15).

  (Ouch! 19k I think I\'ll end here and put the rest, a brief recouting of the 
battle of Naasakiira, a planetary invasion that I\'ve actually played, in a
separate message)

What is the mission?

Is the mission to wipe out the entire population?  Then drop nuclear warheads
on an intercept course somewhere out in the umpteenth orbit.  They come in
like meterorites and are undetectable until BOOM.

Alternate:  It takes a 1G ship 35.39 days to reach 1/10 speed of light.
6G\'s 5.9 days.  At that speed 10 grams has the equivalent energy of a
kiloton.  No way to stop it no screens. no dampers no lasers, no detection
just pure BOOM.

If you want to wipe a planet out, that\'s the way to do it.

But I think most of the invasions are going with the object of capturing a
planet, so using nukes as Bertil suggets is out.  Like wise for the defenders
You don\'t throw nukes around if you want to live on your own planet, and
If you start throwing them so will the other guy.  Right?

Finding a deep site meson gun is a snap.

You can do it with a densiometer pen of 1m or less.
Fire your meson gun at the surface.  BoooM!  Sismic shock pattern monitored by
densiometer.  They do it now for oil with dynamite.  Why not at higher tech.
	You could even do it without the densiometer, just use LADAR to
measure ground movement.  Even Jamming the Active EMS wont work on LADAR.

This is why I designed the 
Meson Sub, At it\'s geothermal site, no neutrino emmisions, with nearly 3km of
water of equal density to the ship it\'s gonna be real tough to find.

About destroying the sensor relay\'s, you\'d have to destroy nearly everything
on the planet that you want to capture intact.

By the way I think I left it off when i posted it, but the Herbert Dean
class Meson Sub is TL 15

I really think subs are the way to go in planetary defence.  Everything else
could be destroyed too fast.  Mobile defences are the key.  This is why the
US spends so much on AntiSubmarine Warfare.  Those SSBN Boomer subs are
deadly!!!!

This is also why in an earlyer post of mine I included an ASW contingent in
my TL-11 Overlord class Assault Helicarrier.  That was designed for planetary
invasions.

Just rambling disconneted thoughts

Mr. Scott

Three Vargr are running down a wet dirt road.

After getting his nice new uniform all soiled, the second turns to the third

					   Depot/Corridor. Model7fib
  
   Each assault transport carries one mechanized regiment consisting of
     800 8t combat and support vehicles and 5000 troops. The composition of
     forces were four lift infantry regiments, one grav armor regiment and
     one artillery/air defence/support regiment. All 6 were fully mechanized 
     and all troops had space to ride in grav vehicles down to the last mechanic
     and supply clerk:)
     They had config7 to be able to launch all vehicles at once.

    [ The first two ships appeared in the starship issue of Digest in the
      hands of the Vargr force that tries to help Zid Rachele steal a few
      cruisers from Dynam Depot ]

  Defending forces: The Naasakiira system defence force:

    1 1000t Chrysantemum DE TL15 (which just happened to be in the area:)
    
    6 5000t SDBs TL9 (Exact stats forgotten, but they didn\'t last one round
		      anyway)

    6 factor 7 missile batteries.

    15 factor 8 beam laser batteries.

    60 factor 8 sand caster batteries.

    These batteries were organized in to three areas, one defending the 
    starport, one defending the capitol and one defending the largest spaceport.

    The Naasakiira ground forces were equipped to TL9, 4 mechanized infantry
      regiments, one lift infantry regiment and one grav armor regiment.
      One infantry regiment defended each group of batteries and the last one
      were spread out around the govermental buildings and various other 
      areas. The grav-troops were held as a reserve.

      All troops and vehicles had prepared positions and shelters.

      [ The vehicles used were the Rob\'s Akian line (the Shellback, Cossack,
        Longbow etc, with stats remade for Striker and tac-missiles added) ]
   
   The vargr force had already defeated a large group of SDB\'s in an initial
engagement around one gas giant.

   As I mentioned, the SDBs waiting in low orbit didn\'t survive the first round
of meson gun and nuke missile fire from the Aenoegrr ships. They got
destroyed critical hits (the space battle used Rebel Guard) before they had
even fired a shot. The Aenoegrr ships deployed as to screen the relatively
defenseless assault transports until they were close enough to deploy their 
troops. As the force closed on the planet, the planetary defences started to
chip away at it. One assault transport became dead-in-space and one suffered a
cargo hit on it\'s load of munitions and simply blew up when the DE surprised 
the vargr force from behind (the didn\'t have the time to reorganize the screen
to cover the back as well).
  Meanwhile the attackers try to silence the ground based batteries but have
little success, the batteries are stationary, but they are very heavily 
shielded and the sandcasters manage to deflect most nuke-missile and laser
salvoes.
  The dead-in-space transport playes possum and hopes that everyone has 
forgotten it.

  The DE manage to avoid major damage through fancy flying and hiding behind
other ships. It\'s missiles are the only missiles that are able to penetrate
the nuke dampers of the Aenoegrr ships due to the difference in computers.
It manage to chew up enough screening ships that the ground batteries were able
to get some shots in at the assault transports. Another transport suffers the
cargo hit fate (10+ on 2D leading to explosion in some of the carried ammuntion.I still can\'t believe that the players rolled 10+ almost every time!:-o).

  One Aenoegrr ships suffers a ship vaporized \'Destroyed\' crit, and another
failes morale and let the transport screen it instead. When the force reach 
drop distance only 4 Aenoegrr, 18 corvettes and 2 transports remain, mainly due
to the DE. When they begin to drop, the DE flies past the screen in to visual
range (as close as a few km) to one of the transports and fires a nuke missile
salvoe which hits almost 100%. The transport gets a \'ship partly shattered\'
result and the aft 25% of it is destroyed at the same time as the DE gets a 
little irradiated. The main part of the regiment deploys in order.

  The 1.75 regiments attack one group of batteries each to clear the way for
the transports and corvettes to land and load up with loot. The first wave
in is the assault speeders armed with forward firing rapid plasma gun B\'s, 
16 lense 8MW pulse lasers to function as point defence against SAMs, and
20 tons of cluster and 1000 kg bombs each as well as ARMs. The troops huddle in
shelters as the air defence vehicles roll out to face the speeders. The speeders
lauch the ARMs at the SAM vehicles and the SAM vehciels fires back. A number
of SAM vehicles are hit and looses their radars, and few SAMs hit, but they do
no major damage against the factor 30 speeders. Some speeders are shot down
by the laser batteries, but they have trouble slweing fast enough to hit the
wildly jinking speeders. 
  The speeders sweep in, strafing the defenders with their plasmaguns and
dropping clouds of cluster and 1ton bombs (the load of a B52 is about 25tons)
Some shelters are hit, most are not, the HE cluster bombs have trouble 
penetrating the defending vehicles but there are causualities. As the speeders 
sweep out, more SAMs are fired but they are all shot down by the PD pulse 
lasers. 
  Next the infantry lands and the grav tanks begin to knock off the defending
batteries and tanks one by one, while defeating the return fire with point
defence pulse lasers. Very few attacking vehicles are destroyed while the
defenders are taking heavy causualities. The attackers also begin to call in
meson gun fire from orbit to annihilate large areas at once. Unless the wild
factor, the DE had been there, the vargr forces would have won in hours. As it
now happened, the DE used it\'s sandcasters against the infantry and fired
salvoes of nuke missiles against the fighting vehicles. 

  When the ships in orbit discovered that their ground force were being 
annihilated, they accelerated away and jumped outsystem. The powerless
assault transport surrendered, but during the time from the surrender to that
the Naasakiira forces managed to scrape a few ships together to ferry them
down a lot escaped in smallcrafts to hide in the outer system.
  
  The Naasakiira defence used the caputured equipment to reinforce itself, the
captured troops to begin rebuilding the starport which had been totally levelled
during the fighting. They also sent a delagation to the Glory of Taerz... (It\'s
1AM here, much to late for me to remember vargr spelling:) and managed to 
strike a deal where the Glory forces took over the protection of Naasakiira in
exchange for about as much as Naasakiira had payed to the Imperial military 
previosly.

  Material damage were extreme. The starport and the spaceport lay in ruins.
The capitol had taken a few stray hits (the attackers got bridge destroyed crits
on the defenders). The attacking forces lost 21000 dead and 10000 captured. 
The defenders lost about 40000 dead (30000 civilians) and half that amount 
wounded (here too 75% civilians). Hightech combat involving meson guns and 
nuclear missiles is very very deadly.

Ahem.  ;-) Let\'s take a look at current technology for a moment. 
Granted, there _are_ computers that would fall into the weight category
of a hand computer (and in fact, are such), the desktop models of the
same are quite a bit larger.  Much of this is due to the requirements
for input/output devices (keyboards and CRTs come to mind) as well as
the various economies of scale.

Futhermore, one would probably _not_ expect the same amount of
expandability in a hand computer as a desk-top model.  Sure, the CPU
speeds are the same, but I\'d really like to see you lug around a 600 MB
SCSI drive interfaced to your Atari portfolio ;-)

Finally, we must consider the working environment of a desk + chair + cpu +
printer + peripherals + documentation + offline storage (floppies to
several MB [currently]).  My current work-space (at home) would take up
a minimum of 9 square meters.  If we consider the tonnage requirements
of various computer models based on _volume_, rather than actual
tonnage, the rules are still pretty much in line.  (Especially if the
rules are modified to allow for computer staff.)

                       Traveller
                 Character Generation

Overview:
This is a new way of generating Traveller characters.  It is based, in
principle, on the methods found in games such as GRUPS and Champions.  The
characters is created rather than rolled up.  While some like the random
varibility of the Traveller system, others prefer to have more control over
the characters development.  This system allows that without violating game
balance.  The created characters should fall between those of the basic system
and the advanced system in the number of skills and stat modifiers.

Instead of working with a term at a time, we randomly determine when the
character will enter play.  Their starting age is calcuated as follows:

Starting Age = 22 + 2d6, each 6 earns an extra roll.

Thus the starting age is open ended.  Generally the starting age will be around
29 years old.  Each character has a number of skill points that are used through
out the generation process to buy stats and skills.  The number of skill points
is computed as follows:

Starting Points = 10 + Age

The average 29 year old character will start play with 39 skill points.  This
system allows the GM to give out experience after play that the characters can
directly apply to their stats and skills, much like GURPS and Champions.  These
points should be 2 or 3 a session.  The rules for reading the Stat and Skill
charts change after the character is created.  During the creation, the skill
points listed are the cost for that level of skill.  After play begins, the
cost to go from one skill level to another costs the listed amount.  This
will be detailed later.

Stats:

Stat      Cost      Stat      Cost
 1        -32        9          2
 2        -16        A          4
 3         -8        B          8
 4         -4        C         16
 5         -2        D         32
 6         -1        E         64
 7          0        F         96
 8          1

Thus, if a player desires his or her character to have a Dexterity of C (12)
it would cost them 16 character points.  After play starts, and that character
is improved to a D (13) dexterity, it would cost the player 32 points.  At
creation time, it would have only cost 16 points in addition to the 16 already
spent on the C dexterity.

Skills:
Skills work much like stats.  The player spends points to buy skills at a
certain level as determined by the following chart.

Skill     Cost
  0         1
  1         2
  2         4
  3         8
  4        16
  5        32
  6        64
  7        96
  8       128  (Each point above 8, costs an additional 32 points).

All skills must be purchased at the lowest cascade level.  Thus Jet Aircraft-3
could be purcahsed for 8 points.  If the player prefers to have the whole
cascade group, it can be bought for the next highest points.  Thus, the
following are examples of buying groups.

Jet Aircraft-3 = 8 points
Aircraft-3 = 16 points
Vehicals-3 = 32 points

(Note this could cause a problem where the cascade skills run to different
levels).

After play begins, the cost to improve is read straight from the chart and no
one may improve more than one level in a session.  Thus, if the Jet-Aircraft-3
player wanted to improve to Jet Aircraft-4, it would cost 16 experience points.

Stats may be improved in a similar fashion, however to keep players from
abusing this, a die roll determines which stats are improved.  If a player
wants to have three stat rolls, it would cost them 8 points.  The stat that is
improved is based on the following chart:

        Roll           Stat
        1              Strength
        2              Dexterity
        3              Endurance
        4              Intellegence
        5              Education
        6              Social Standing

Each character starts with some base skills and some given skills based on
their branch of service.  The following chart details these base skills.

Computer-0 (Artisan-0 if TL too low)
Vehical-0 (Equestrian if TL too low)
Gun Cbt-0 (Hand Cbt of TL too low)

Service         Skills
Army            Cbt Rifle-1, Brawling-0
Sailor          Small Watercraft-1, Mechanic-0
Flyer           (Aircraft)-1, Vacc Suit-0
Navy            (Space)-1, Vacc Suit-0
Marine          (Blade)-1, Vacc Suit-0
Scout           Pilot-1, Vacc Suit-0
Merchant        Trader-1, Admin-0
Belter          Vacc Suit-1, Prospecting-0
Pirate          Brawling-1, Streetwise-0
Rogue           Streetwise-1, Stealth-0
Hunter          Hunting-1, Rifle-0
Law Enf         Pistol-1, Streetwise-0
Doctor          Medic-1, (Tech)-0
Diplomat        Liason-1, Lingustics-0
Bureaucrat      Admin-1, Interview-0
Scientist       (Tech)-1, (Science)-0
Noble           +1 Soc, Carousing-0

All skills in (parantheses) are cascade skills and the player must choose a
skill from the lowest level or pay for the group.

Mustering Out:
        At the age where the character will begin play, the character is
mustered out at that point.  Rank, starting cash value, and possessions are
determined.  Instead of making cash rolls, the characters Social Standing
determines their starting wealth.  Note: This includes the value of all
possession except for those gained during this phase.  If a character is
listed as having 50,000 credits and they claim to own a house, the GM must
determine the value of that house and deduct it from their available cash.
Also, the GM must limit the starting cash of high Social Standing characters
by forcing them to have a large sum of their value tied up in investments, etc.

        Soc            Credits                 Soc            Credits
         1                 500                  9             200,000
         2               1,000                  A             500,000
         3               2,000                  B           1,000,000
         4               5,000                  C           2,000,000
         5              10,000                  D           5,000,000
         6              20,000                  E          10,000,000
         7              50,000                  F          20,000,000
         8             100,000

Additional Musting Out benifits are determined by the characters finishing age.

        Finish Age    Rolls            Roll         Benifit
          22-25         1                1          Low Passage
          26-29         2                2          Weapon
          30-33         3                3          Middle Passage
          34+           4                4          High Passage
                                         5          Traveller\'s Aid Society*
                                         6          Ship (10 years pmts)

Finally, Rank is determined by finish age and Social Standing.  The following
chart shows the equivialant Officer Rank for Navy and Army people.  The GM
should assign titles and such accordingly to other services.

      Rank    Title                    Age Range         Soc  Age Group Mod
        1     Ensign/2LT                Upto 24           9       +1
        2     Lt JG/1LT                 25-26             A       +1
        3     Lt/Cpt                    27-30             B       +2
        4     Lt Cmdr/Major             31-36             C       +2
        5     Cmdr/Lt Col               37-42             D       +3
        6     Cpt/Col                   43-50             E       +4
        7     Commodore/Brig Gen        51-56             F       +5
        8     Rear Adm/Lt Gen           57-62
        9     Vice Adm/Maj Gen          63-68
       10     Adm/Gen                   69+

Characters with higher Social Standing can use their influence to speed up
promotions.  This is the reason for the modifier.  Thus a 33 year old character
with a B Social Standing would be of rank 6.  Their age of 33 made them a
rank 4, and their social influences has moved them up the ranks faster.

	 I don\'t think that we should give up on Deep Meson Sites quite so
easily (though Scott Kellogg has a bunch of good points 8-) .  Rather, let\'s
look at a well-done survivable Deep Meson network.
	  
	First, let\'s assume that the point is to build a net of 10 sites, geo 
powered with factor-T meson guns.  Each site\'s weapons already cost MCr 1000,
so total installation value (per) is probably nearly MCr 2000 or so.  Make them
manned, unless you\'re worried about Zhodani in the area, then make them
unmanned (but man-tended) or put psi-shields in the walls.  In any case, bury
them far enough that neither densiometers nor nukes are a real threat... say
5km.
	 Now, given that they\'re 5km deep and need to have secret locations,
and that the project will cost MCr20,000 without any infrastructure, we can
start to arrainge the whole network.  Say we build a tunnel, from one base
to another, 5km deep.  Make it a bit curvey, and somewhat variable depth, just
to confuse people.  Say it\'s 50km long.  Given current engineering prices,
and a reasonable extrapolation of dollar->Cr, it\'s going to be three to five
billion credits to build.  That\'s ok, we\'ve already budgeted 20, so going
50% more on other stuff would be reasonable.  Assume that the main tunnel is
5 billion credits.
	Off the main tunnel, at random intervals, run side tunnels.  Make them
about 5km long, but of variable length and at random directions
	Have robots make the tunnels, and don\'t let someone on the outside
plan the locations.  Don\'t even keep records of the locations.  You don\'t need
them.  Have all transport to the sites via inertial-compensated vehicles in
the tunnels, so nobody knows where they\'re going, and can\'t run an inertial
trace on position.  Assume that the side tunnels and other stuff are about
another 5 billion credits.  Run wiring so that if a single site loses power
or targeting, it can get it from the rest.  Handle targeting with a large
network of meson-communicator connected passive (and thus untracable) EMS
sensor sites, and neutrino detectors colocated with the Deep Meson guns (they
don\'t emit and work perfectly well under rock).
	
	This arraingement is difficult to trace, and nearly impossible to 
destroy.  If you\'re worried about people running seismic waves through to find
where tunnels run, just pipe grout into the ground in wierd patterns to shield
or confuse seismic returns from the area. (cheap).  The whole thing doesn\'t 
cost all that much either, compared to the guns... The installations only
cost as much as the weapons themselves, ignoring the power system.

	Alternate arrangements might be a whole interconnected network of 
tunnels, tunnels with mobile crawlers with meson guns, and I\'m sure more are
possible.

As soon as energy weapons with long range and high rate of fire become
plentyful infantry will have horrendous problems on the battlefield,
grav belts or no. A gatling arrangement of 5 25Mw laser turrets can sweep
a large area at a high penetration and damage (for infantry) without
lowering the firing craft\'s ability to fight. This ability, coupled with
good longrange sensors make open field battle a virtual deathtrap for
dismounted infantry.

Dismounted infantry shall maintain an edge on vehicles in builtup areas and
indoors, as well as heavily broken or wooded ground. The air/space above
the battlefield (battlespace?) shall be controlled by a combination of 
vehicles - a-la modern surface fleet.

Well, NOTHING short of a major starship weapon can do anything to that bugger.
Missiles (unless directed in the hundreds) are useless against a foe that
can target and fire 4 250km lasers as anti-missile fire.

Prognosis:

	Task Force (Planetary), TOE

Major Ship Units (atmosphere capable)
APV-FS Vechiles
AP Vehicles		AV Vehicles		Grav Tanks
Grav APC		C^3I Vehicles		Grav Arty
Logistics Vehicles	HQ Vehicles		
Liason Vehicles		
Infantry

1st line are the major units, going down in survivability to infantry. However,
as soon as this task force MUST take a built up area INTACT (i.e. not slagged
and radioactive) the organization becomes:

Infantry		Light AP Vehicles (i.e. high ROF AP APC)
Grav Tanks
Grav Arty		Grav APC
Logistics Vehicles	HQ Vehicles
C^3I Vehicles
Liason Vehicles

The superheavy AP-FS of the BPBB Phalanx type is non-introduceable into the
conflict and must be used to interdict battlespace around the primary
target.

Thus the BPBB is a High-Guard unit of city and woodland combat.

instance, in Dean McLaughlin\'s "Hawk Among the Sparrows" we have a TL7
or 8 fighter/recon plane against TL 5(?) biplanes (think of an advanced
version of the SR-71 getting thrown back to WW I).

The pilot discovers to his horror, that his radar & heat guided
missiles are useless. There\'s so little metal in the biplanes that the
radar rejects them as static or decoys. And as for heat seeking, there
are several orders of magnitude difference between a jet turbine and a
primitive internal combustion engine.

As for guerillas needing to hide weapons, it all depends. What you can
do with common household items is astonishing. If you allow "safe" 
industrial items the list grows even more. A certain type of fuel and a
certain agricultural chemical combine to make an explosive rather
better than dynamite, if somewhat less stable.  This is why the Army
has *long* lists of materials that must be controlled if sabotage or
guerilla warfare are expected.

BTW, a trebuchet makes a nice, hard to detect, indirect fire artillery
piece. It\'s got quite a range if you are using high TL projectiles.

Now as to getting things past TL restrictions, allow me to suggest
reading "King David\'s Spaceship" by Jerry Pournelle. To someone at
TL14, the difference between TL3 & TL4 may be insignificant. To the
mercenaries on the ground, it is *quite* a difference. 

Also, given the benefit of a few extra TLs of knowledge, you can do
some amazing things at the low TLs. I and a friend once drove a GM
nuts. He\'d dropped "us" complete with our knowledge into a fantasy
medieval world. In short order we were raking in lots of cash with
things buildable with our knowledge, but that TLs tools. Even with
medieval "chemistry", things like nerve gas are possible, if you know
some *real* chemistry. 

I strongly suspect that some players with a pocket computer containing
the imperial encyclopedia and some reference works could make
themselves indispensible on a low TL worldm. And with a bit of luck, 
make it low like "native" breakthroughs.

Refs:  Be supplied with bad one liners if you use the above.

Seriously, on the subjct of pseudo biological bots:  I think that the rule
that you multiply the whole unit by eight in terms of cost and 1.5 in terms of
weight is a bit much.  In the above I have done so only for the componants
which make the robot appear human:  Chassis, Head, Arms, Legs, Transmission
Eyes, Voder.  Why should a powerplant (that is not exposed anyway) cost and
weigh more?  Olfactory sensor?  not exposed.  Auditory? ditto.
	Perhaps the brain should be more complex, as it has to mimic humans
more closely, but that should show up in the brain construction rules.
and why should a pseudo bio\'s skill programs cost eight times that of another
robot.  If you\'ve got emotion simulation, you\'ve got it right?

	If you disagree with the above then the cost and weight are higher:
Cr=3,190,524 wt=393kg

Yes, I liked Terminator 2

I did a little adding early this morning.

You want to kill Lucan?  Easy.

Take 1 Kl of lead (13.5tons) take a scoutship (2G) jump into capital a long
way out.  Accelerate toward capital till you hit 1/10 speed of light
(15 days or so) and dump the lead block overboard so that it will impact
close to or ontop of the grav palace.  (preferably at night so he will
be sleeping there for security or maybe when he\'s holding court)

The lead will have no emmisions, a low radar cross section, and will be in
detection range for a VERY short period of time.

At .1c the lead will have  the equivalent energy of 1.3GIGATONS of TNT.

One dead nasty emporor...

Planetary invasion forces that aren\'t so choosy about what they find can use
the same tactic.

On another subject, I am curious.  Has anyone ever used the K\'kree module
successfully?  I got it a long time ago and it seems basically unplayable
too much complex stuff.  Maybe as a NPC, but not as a PC.

I wonder if anyone tried and what luck they had.  I have the same 
question for the Hiver module.  I can see them as NPC\'s but not PC\'s
(Sorry Steve)  But I haven\'t seen the player who could pull it off
convincingly.  I wouldn\'t even know how to ref a Hiver or K\'kree PC.

Soooooo

What luck have you folks had?

Asker of silly questions,

The reason I asked about computers is this:

Basically, a starship has 3 computers running in parallel.  Each one
checks the answers provided by the other two.  If one disagrees with the 
other two, the two out vote the errant one and it is noted.

If one computer is consistantly giving wrong answers it is shut down and
says FIX ME!!!

So, If the volume of a computer is actually the work station volume, then
in a starship case it shouls only be 1/3 of that.  And a car with computer
aided control should have less volume because it doesn\'t have a work
station right?

Where am I coming from and why am I babbling so:

Right now, a TL5 car with no computer and a top speed of 100kph
will perform the same as a TL8 computer with a model 0 at a top
speed of 100kph.  As far as I can see there is no difference that the 
rules will generate.  Actually a TL8 car with anti-lock braking smart
suspension etc will perform much better (I would guess anyway)
What I am looking for is a small computer that would be usable in a small
vehicle to get just a lousy +1 in difficulty rolls that doesn\'t require
the Cr 900,000 model 1 computer!  Right?

So all you vehicle theory guys, what do you say?

Somebody mentioned the problem of vehicle maintainance and Tech levels.
	Well, The problem as I see it manifested in today\'s cars as
opposed to cars of the 60\'s is one of engineering design.
In the 60\'s gas was cheap.  You want a fast car:  Put in a BIG engine.
90\'s: You want a fast car:  Reduce weight, smaller chassis, higher
RPM engine...

Now you want to fix em:  OK the 60\'s car is so big you can crawl inside
the hood (bonnet for you brits).  Lots of space!  you can see everything

90\'s car?  You want to change the oil?  Well we\'ll have to drop the
engine to get at the oil drain pan and.....

Get the picture?  The more constraints there are on a design the harder
it will be to fix.  As to the problem of 100 year old reliable design
that everyone knows how to fix, that again is just bad engineering.
during the 100 years mechanics had to figure out how to change everything
into an easily maintainable form.  If the designers had done a proper
job, they would have thought of all the maintainance problems before the
vehicle ever hit the market.

Unfortunately, trav designs are a volume critical process.  There are almost
no designs that have space left over.  It all gets called the cargo bay
or in some cases the fuel tank.  That means that there is ZERO room left for
a mechanic to crawl around in an engine compartment.

Does any of this make sence?

Bigger ships will probably need about 1/5 of machinery space for

Modularism is likely, with each piece of equipment in a frame to hold it

Dean assumes a TL15 invasion although no presumption of defending TL 
is made. A TL 15 defending force can have some of the same options as the 
attacker, they can be where the "defenders are not" by using black globes to 
mask their prescence. Also since deep site mesons can basically fire in ANY 
direction from their site it can be practically impossible to pin the general 
location of the site especially if the planet has moons with their own meson 
guns. Since sensors are fairly cheap they can be redundantly placed with only 
a small fraction active at any given time. While the former approach requires 
atleast TL15, the later just requires the technology to build meson guns
TL-11. Communication lines can be land lines protected against detection and
radiation effects. There can be multiple back-up systems to allow continuous
flow of information.

Lets also be careful of the densitometer\'s capabilities. Most worlds can have
or even "set-up" fake meson-gun sites by setting up large mineral deposits
with high metallic content. Since meson guns are quite lethal even at low
numbers the tonnage of these \'deposits\' can be highly variable. I am not 
certain whether the depth of a site is solely a function of the densitometer 
capabilities. Depth may be more a function of protection from more 
conventional weapons, in which case the site may be much closer to the 
surface making an attacker\'s job harder since most metallic deposits would 
be fairly close to the surface and let us not forget the forged metallic
cities of the future. Some of these cities could run quite deep beneath the
surface of the planet, raising some tough ethical questions for the attacker.
Especially if the defender did intentionally put a meson site under the city.

In any case, every wrong guess means atleast one dead spinal mount armed
ship which can wipe out a fleet eventually. I also think that the initial 
attack will be the best place for ground pounders. 

My scenario is that the fleet moves in at full strength destroys as much
of the defense as it can, inserts troops and then the major ships pull
back leaving as Dean said, the fighters and the "smaller" craft to slug it.
If the attacker fails to win orbital superiority then all is lost for them,
but the defender even if defeated can silo and husband their craft for later
use in vital tactical superiority missions. ftrs as no large ships will be
be in combat range. Their hardened silos may have little to fear from the big
ships but they could still be bombed by attacking fighters. Similarly if the 
attacking small craft win they will also have to withdraw otherwise they will
be wiped out by planetary defenses. 

So they\'ll withdraw returning only to provide tactical support to ground troops
The tanks and the troops will have to quickly start occupying cities to protect
themselves and then find these meson sites with the "Low Power Densitometers" 
ASAP.

The main point being that until those sites are found the attacker\'s
victory is not assured and those sites may not be all found out for a long
period of time. And they will not be found without overwhelming "ground
forces". 

While the hi-tech sensors in MT make it very hard to surprise a well
defended site, it does not make it any easier to find guerrillas. In a large
urban sprawl it may be impossible to distinguish or find them. The rapid
response force while a good idea has no real edge. Most guerrillas in the
modern age rarely use any kind of mechanical vehicles, hard to understand 
why they might want to in the future considering it is so obvious. Especially
grav units of any kind as they are immediately detectable by densitometers.

How would the sensor perimeter prevent the guerrillas from leaving armed?
Neural Activity Sensors work only at fairly short range and most hand weapons
require little or no power, and even batteries may be hard to detect.
Consider a hi-tech guerrilla force in Combat Environment Suits with helmets
including psionic shields carrying non-metallic ACRs. In a jungle or in a
urban situation very hard to find. If they bury their guns they can come back 
for them later. Again this is not very hi-tech stuff only TL-12 at most and
most of it is much lower.

Guerrillas job will be harder in attacking valuable strategic targets but
the opposing force\' job in finding them will not become easier.

A high-population hi-tech world can be very hard to capture and control. The 
best way may be kidnap a portion of the population from all over the world 
and of all walks of life and hold them hostage to force compliance of the
people until a sufficiently large garrison force is available.

  Traveller is a game ("He said it!" "Heresy on the TML!" "To the stake!":)
and more or less integral to the enjoyment of an RPG is the ability for the
players to identify with the characters somewhat. Besides from that nanotech
wasn\'t even theoretically invented when the basic assumptions of traveller were
set down, a nanotech society would probably be too alien to identify with.

  I have used a nanotech device in an adventure involving ancients. The players
got mightily confused when they found a pool of what looked like mercury that
radiated neutrinos. The got even more confused when they bottled a part of it
and it continued to radiate neutrinos:)

    Like everyone else that saw the movies, I am working on my on CD-101.
Although I am not ready to publish it yet, I have a few comments on the
design that was already presented.

    The 101 is not a psuedo-bio robot, it is contoured.  They function without
their camoflauge (aka skin.)  They are polished (to act as reflec, since laser
and plasma weapons seem to be the rage in 2029 LA) and heavily armored.  They
have a small, low-power primary power source, and a reserve battery.  There is
no evidence that they are particularly fast on foot, and are probably not much
faster than a human (TOP=30 kph).

    The greatest problem in designing these things is the power plant.  There
are no nuclear batteries in MT, which makes it hard to simulate their power
supply.  There is no evidence of fuel outside the power plant itself, and the
plant is small enough to miss when being impaled by a T-1000.

    I noticed that the design presented mixes the MT vehicle construction with
the brain rules from Robots (Book 8).  Anybody have a timetable for the next
Robots-like release and have there been any interesting articles anywhere on
using old-style robots in MT?

This is in response to several notes on a lot of topics:

First Scott Kellog\'s sub is a great idea. And I will grant him that
very few starships have sonar. But generally a sonar will not be
needed. A meson armed submarine could be detected by several armored
drones carrying densitometers and a maser, even at 5km depth. Which
incidently is very rare. Most modern subs have problems getting a mile
deep and part of the problem is that there are just not that many places 
that are even close to being that deep. Geothermal sites would be picked
up by a Passive IR detector and could be targetted just as a matter of 
course with nuclear missiles. If you try to stop them you are found.
If you don\'t then your crew is probably toast.  

Somebody else pointed out that you could get a seismic shock pattern
reading from explosives. The question being what range you need to
be at from the surface(and the meson gun) while you are doing these
tests. Secondly wouldn\'t you pick up several false readings. There
could be a variety of metallic objects underground.... Lastly a LADAR
scan would be hampered by first the atmospheric conditions and secondly
its narrow beam. The seismic pattern reading can be done but not from 
ship but from troops  on surface which would somehow have to be landed. 
Once the troops, who are more expendable than ships, locate a meson gun
site for certain then capital ships could move in and knock it out. 

Bertil Jonell\'s Battle for Naasakiira:

Nice set-up. However the Aenoegrr class cruisers had major design
problems. Built using High Guard they did not fit. As I recall after
the Spinal-E was inserted, there was only enough place for a powerplant
and fuel. No space for crew, jump or M-drives or dampers. Same problem
with Oegveng class gunned corvettes. Perhaps the reason your 5000t SDBs
died was because they were the only ones built by rules. I don\'t believe
that if a ship is impossible by High Guard standards that it would be
possible with MT starship generation system. Still I would like to see a
<10,000 t ship with Spinal Mt (any kind) and a reasonable jump and  maneuver 
drives and Dampers and Screens. Most examples I have seen are basically
battle-riders. 

As a side note on Battleship vs BattleTender question. I always thought
bringing 8 spinal mts to battle was always superior to bringing 2 or 3 even
if the other side ended up with 30-40% greater tonnage and better
"survivability" through jump drive availability.

I am afraid I fell down on the job slightly and missed the Saturday
Traveller seminar at Origins.  If anyone who was there would like to upload
a brief discussion of what went on, please do.  Marc Miller said afterwards
that there wasn\'t much of importance discussed...

I did spend quite a bit of time talking to Tom Peters of DGP during the
convention, who was sympathetic to what I think of as \'our viewpoint\'--
leaning in the direction of introducing as few bizarre technological
results as possible in the course of making a playable game.  The following
answers are not official, of course, and I\'ll make a few remarks below about
his recommendations to those of us concerned about these things.

Gravitics:  Inertial compensators have no particularly good explanation,
  but the idea that they are doing whatever they do through more applications
  of gravitics as opposed to some other force is probably correct.  Thrusters
  are just grav drives that work beyond gravity, not some special new force
  that \'really\' works on the volume of the ship, so my scheme of calculating
  accelerations at 650tons per thrust unit is probably good.  Despite mention
  of a \'6-G barrier\' to grav acceleration, this is probably more of a design
  trade-off barrier than a physical limitation to grav performance.

Streamlining:  Take the Fugate comment in the Question and Answer section
  of MTJ#2 with a grain of salt regarding streamlining.  Apparently Mr. F
  has a tendency to \'shoot from the hip\' on these answers, and we shouldn\'t
  rewrite \'Traveller Physics t.m.\' to account for his answers.  While pushing
  a USL hull through a gas giant atmosphere would be a bad idea, there is no
  real reason that you couldn\'t land one (very slowly) on a typical inhabitable
  planet.  Airframe hulls don\'t provide lift, although there is room for a
  small rule expansion to include lifting hulls (or wings).

Tom Peters suggests that we send letters to Joe Fugate about these sorts of
things cropping up in the Q&A section--for example, in this issue there was an
answer to a question about \'low signature\' for Gauss rifles, which included a
note about it being possible \'if the bullet reached supersonic velocity\' in the
gun barrel.  Except for rocket projectiles, I know of no bullets which accel-
erate beyond the gun barrel...Joe is apparently a computer programmer by trade.

I went ahead and handed out our email information in various places, telling 
the Traveller \'pros\' that we would be all too happy to help them avoid these
sorts of problems in the future, and otherwise volunteering the use of our
compiled expertise.

Is there anyone out there with a very capable computer who could port the
daily list to GEnie email to send to the DGP and GDW people?  I could theor-
etically do it, but it would involve downloads and uploads with a 300 baud
modem and transfer through a capture buffer of only 18K, which is a problem
for the bigger mailings.  Wilson?  

A lot of Traveller books moved through the auction.  As a result of buying a
few things that I was missing as part of larger lots, I now have spare copies
of Double Adventures 1-3 and Gamelord\'s Desert Environment supplement.  These
are basically \'free to a good home\', so contact me by email if you have a
real _need_ for them.  Didn\'t Metlay recommend DA3 for beginners?

Reprints:  DGP plans to reprint the World Builders Handbook as soon as the
AI project has recouped enough money to pay for the print run, hopefully by 
the end of the year at the latest.  So those of you without a copy should be
patient.

  After spending some time over the July 4th weekend at Lambert Field
in St. Louis, I got to thinking what a class A or B starport in the
universe of MT would look like.  I came up with the following kinds of
questions.

o   What kind of facilites are there?  Obviously there are those that
    are stated in the various manuals (construction and repair
    facilities) and hotels and restaraunts.  What else?

o   What kind of people services would there be?  Obvious things such
    as hotels, restaraunts and bars, what else?  How many?

o   What kind of ships would one be expected to see?  A lot of real
    small free trader type ships, or major ships with just smattering
    of smaller ones....

o   What kind of facilities would exist for the small starship
    captain?  Would each ship be awarded a gate to a concourse?  Or
    would they have to park out in a general landing field and walk or
    ride to the facilities in the starport, sort of like how some
    yacht clubs have their boats just anchored out in the water, and
    you need a dinghy to reach the shore.

o   If a smaller ship captain were denied councourse access, I suppose
    that it would mean that these facilities did not exist or were
    being used by larger (more regular) ships?  Are there many people
    transport lines available?  Is space travel more like air travel
    today except longer, or more like ocean-going travel in the past?
    (i.e.  More cargo and less passengers)

o   What approximate size would the average class A or B starport be?
    Both orbital and land-based?  For orbitals, approximate tonnage?
    Also, would it be advantageous for these orbital stations to be
    maneuverable?  I mean more than occasional manuevering to maintain
    orbit, more like changing from a low to high orbit or vice-versa.
    For land-based starports would the size of the starport be
    comparable to small city?  What would be its population?

o   Who would control the starport?  Would it be under the jurisdiction
    of the local government or the imperium, or ruling subsector?  Who
    would be responsible for the investigation of crimes in a
    starport?



    Well, thats about enough questions for now.  I never thought that
    this subject was discussed in great enough detail in the original
    game, and has not been expounded upon in the revised editions
    either.  Any opinions are welcome.

  In the MT Ref\'s Manual it lists the power consumption rates for Manuever
Drives and Weapons in terms of what?  Mw?  Kw?  Watts?  I designed a real
cool 500 ton Pirate ship only to discover that it required over 800,000
watts of power!!!!  I immediately thought the computer had screwed up the
number...  (People never screw up, it\'s those damn computers!)

 If it were Kw, it would make more sense in places, of course a single watt
to launch a missle does not seem right.

Ex.  500 ton ship Manuever 3g = 40 thruster units at 70 Mw of power per
     thruster = 2800 Mw...  Now a tech level 15 power plant produces 6 Mwatts
     of power for every Kliter.  That leave us with 466 Kl or 34 tons...


     Now wait a minute..........

     Never mind I see.....   Problem in my calcs.   Multiplying by kl of
     manuever drive instead of thruster unit...   Whew.  I didn\'t think
     that 37,000 Mw would be necessary to push a 500 ton ship at 3g!

   Sorry for wasting your time....!!!

	Well, there are a few problems with this idea. I do have the
computers that can handle things like this . (Mac IIfx, with 9600 baud modem
to name one.) But the problem lies on the traffic generated from this. 
First of all, DGP is devoting all their resources to AI project these days.
I don\'t think Joe (Fugate) login on GEnie daily anymore. It\'s more like
once every two three days. And In two to three days, about 10-15 messages
are generated. I don\'t really think Joe would have time to keep up with 
the traffic. The same goes for GDW, actually, the problem is probably
worse with GDW. Loren Wisemen and Julia are the only two I know/talk
regularly there. Loren has his hands full with Twilight 2000, Merc 2000,
plus the upcoming projects. Julia has her hands full with the Challenge 
magazine. I doubt they could keep up with the traffic, not to mention
neither of them are really traveller experts anyway. I don\'t know how often
Marc checks in, but I haven\'t seen posts from him in a long time. Also,
in doing this, that might generate the same conflict between us and DGP that
occured with HIWG and DGP, which I really don\'t want to go into detail.

Now Rob, don\'t get me wrong. I do think it\'s a great idea, but I just don\'t
think it will work in practice.

Brian, this spawns a suggestion more than a response to your querys.  Why don\'t
we spend some time and post some of the facilities that we have created.  This
is the kind of shareing that makes this list great!  They could then be
archived at the FTP site for later grabbing!.

Since I shot off my mouth about posting stuff, here I go :-)

What follows is a description of a dining and entertainment facility that my
wife and I created for Traveller moons ago.  It is the ONLY bit of role playing
I have ever gotten out of her (Sherry is president of WADD, Wives Aginst D & D).
It is appropriatly named after her.

- - --

Shea Sherree\'s -- Fine Dining and Entertainment at Class A and B StarPorts.

Shea Sherree\'s is chain of Elegant Dining facilties that have been spreading
throughout the sector.  Upon entering Shea Sherree\'s, guests are greeted by a
coat/hat/weapon check person.  This person is very polite and asks that all
weapons be checked.  All customers then pass through an elaborate weapons
sensor.  Should someone attempt to sneak a weapon in, a large muscular Host
will see them out.

After passing through the sensor and surviving Guido, the guests are then asked
if they are there for Dining, Dancing, or Refreshments.  The Motif is that of a
Terran 1890\'s era establisment.  Real Brass and Glass are used for the decore
(expensive, that is why weapons and fighting are not tolerated).

The typical Shea Sherree\'s is a two story facility.  The dining area is laced
with local plants and is located on the lower level.  Large stained and etched
glass windows look out on the StarPort Mall.  Usually live dinner music is
provided.  The tables are all heavy wood and finely carved.  Upon being seated,
the server hands each guest a hand held computer and stylus.  They select the
meal that they want and the delay before it arrives as well as any drinks,
including special orders.  This information is then sent to the kitchen/bar for
processing.  At the time orders are place, the Credit/ID card is scanned for
billing purposes.

Also on the lower level is the bar/lounge.  This is your typical bar.  Behind
the bar is a large etched mirror, that if it gets broken will cost some one on
the order of 10Kcr.  The wooden tables are supported by polished brass columns.
This lounge is the pass thru area to the twin spiral brass staircases that lead
up to the club.  Also, clear, gas powered elevators travel between the floors.

The Club itself is a modern, high-tech club.  Almost every imaginable high-tech
gizmo is present.  Holographic video displays bring the music to life.  When
a band isn\'t playing, and videos are running, it is like having the band there
in person.  The floor even supports Gravity control for those Zero-G dances.
The sound insulation between floors is amazing, the lower level is very quiet
compared to the loud volume of the upper floor.

This is a sketchy description, but I hope it helps spawn some others to post
other StarPort facilities.

  All ships involved were redone for MegaT using some of Rob Deans first 
suggestions (It was played around last yule) namely not including the hull CP,
reduced gunners and bridge crew, but using the old agility rules (I even
calculated the agility for the vehicles involved in the same way:).
  
  The weapons the vehicles were equipped with were designed using Striker 
(that\'s why there are such things as 48MW 16lense-pulse lasers even though the
 concept of lenses is just mentioned in passing in COACC. Spaceship armaments
 are straight from MegaT, except the PCs last invention: They charged the jump
 drive for a jump 1. Then they dumped the energy from the crystals using the
 emergency dump system. That system heats the hydrogene from the fueltanks 
 using the energy in the jump crystals and expels it from the ship. They used
 this as the largest blowtorch in Corridor against some of the vargr ground
 forces:)

  On to the Aenoegrr \'cruiser\' (I guess strike cruiser sounded more charismatic
than \'meson gun destroyer\':) Here\'s some parts of the design spreadsheet:

  Since HighGuard has jumpfuel equal to 10% of ships volume per jump number and
MegaT uses jumpfuel equal to the jumpnumber plus one times 5% it is quite easy
to do a ship with enough fuel to do 2 jump 6 without refuling. This would
have taken 120% of the ships volume just for fuel in HighGuard, while in MegaT
it just takes 70% of the ship for enough fuel.

  Add to this the booster power plant idea and the practice of not providing
lifesupport for the entire hull etc, and the MegaT designs with have strayed
quite far from their HighGuard forefathers.

  I\'m posting the full MegaT stats for all the ships and vehicles involved
in the fight (excpet the DE and those pesky SDBs, I think I\'ve posted the DE
sometime before and I still haven\'t found the SDBs, talk about ship vaporized:)

The Terminator design was a joke!  (Get it? Boy you guys are serious)

But seriously.  I more or less designed THAT ROBOT as a contoured one
That\'s how I violated the upper max on armor values for PseudoBio robots
As to the speed limits, that was the artifact of the power to weight
ratio of the design using legs.

As to the 150 years duration... Well, there aient no power plant that can do
it without going into ultratechnology.  I tried to put in a fusion plant,
but it just wouldn\'t fit.  (Plus he probably would have had a road speed
in the supersonic range...)

But seriously, The T-150 (or was it the CD-101)  I only saw the movie once,
and my memory for trivia has a smaller capacity than Arnie\'s acting ability

anyway the T-150 has a minor problem with its visual sensors:  The Light

   The Aenoegrr so-called "Strike Cruiser" is an old Vargr design originally 
developed by a planetary navy in the Julian Protectorate but now common in 
large parts of the Extents as far spinward as Provence Sector. It is a light 
warship that forms the mainstay of several corsair bands and serves in escort 
duties in system navies. Its popularity with corsairs is probably because of 
the spinal Meson-E gun. A meson gun has always been considered as a very 
"charismatic" weapon among corsairs and it is especially usefull as orbital 
artillery in support of ground forces. Among the battles in which ships of 
Aenoegrr class have participated is the infamous Dynam Depot debacle.
Currently, ships of the Aenoegrr class are very common in the conquered parts 
of Spinward Marches, Deneb, Vland, Lishun and Antares and especially Corridor.

   The Oegveng class gunned corvette is a Vargr ship of common design, similar 
to at least a hundred different classes of light escorts from the Extents. It 
was ships of this class that were deployed as escort screen for the Aenoegrr 
cruisers at Dynam Depot/Lishun.
The most famous recent battles in which Oegveng class ships have been used are 
the first battle of Naasakiira/Corridor and the hundred day battle between the 
Destiny Alliance and the Depot Security Fleet at Corridor Depot/Corridor.

   The purpose of the Goerrghkfae class assault transports is to transport a 
full TL13 regiment of 800 fighting vehicles and 5000 troops and deploy it in 
orbit over a hostile world. The configuration enables all crafts to start at
once and descend to the surface under own power while the TS provides counter-
battery fire using its missile turrets. It is a relatively recent design local 
to Provence and saw first action during the invasion of Corridor.

  The Gvehoerr is one of a series of almost standardized tech 13 (originally 
tech 11) vargr combat vehicles. The standardization in this case comes from 
the fact that extremely large quantities of 108m3 wedge-shaped hulls became 
available cheeply when a large manufacturer in the Empire of Varroerth 
suddenly went broke in 1002. This opportunity was siezed upon by a local 
governor in the Ngathksirz sector who bought the whole stock, had a number of 
fighting vehicles designed with the hulls as base and successfully fought a 
large-scale seccession from the Empire of Varroerth in his sector, thereby 
gaining great charisma for himself.
   Attributing much of the victory to the vehicles and especially their shape, 
\'My tanks looks so <word incorporating all the positive meanings of \'good\', 
\'bad\' and \'charismatic\'> that Destiny looks favourably upon them!\', the 
governor set out to secceede for himself with an even larger chunk of the 
Empire of Varroerth. Following his death this creation quickly decayed and most
of it was absorbed back into the Empire of Varroerth.
   The fame of the vehicles however, lived on, even though they only have the 
hull in common and new manufacturers all over the Extents have taken up 
producing their own versions of them.

    For defence against ground fire and missiles it relies on it\'s high agility
and a aft-mounted point defence pulse laser.

   The Kaghtsuen Light Combat Grav Transport is available in as many 
configurations as there are operators. Each agency that build or use them have 
their own model numbers. Most common are a pure cargo version, various 
versions are equipped for use by the support troops for example mobile 
workshops, kitchens, fuel processing plants, ammo carriers and so on. One 
version is specifically built to be used in conjunction with the Thonghsudh 
artillery vehicle. It carries two modular hoppers of 450 200mm MDHwz rounds 
each that can be loaded into a Thonghsudh in four minutes if the old hopper is 
to be taken care of and less than one if the old hopper is scuttled.

   Heavily armed and armored, but not very agile, the Rogh Uerralor makes up 
for this lack by mounting a heavy-duty pulse laser for point defence. It 
doubles as a means to dispose of large numbers of lightly armed vehicles and 
troops without having to engage the main armament. It is controlled by the 
commander but it is usually put in \'auto engage\' mode.

   The purpose of the Thonghsudh artillery vehicle is to defeat point defences 
by overwhelming them with it\'s high rate of fire. The ammunition is carried in 
a large 54m3 hopper to speed up loading during battlefield condition. The load 
of 450 rounds (usually of one type, mixes has to be prepared at the supply 
site beforehand) is enough for two 225 rounds bombardments, each covering an 
area of 1800m times 1800m (airburst HE).
  (*) Each target in the dangerspace is attacked twice: once for direct hits 
and one for shrapnel hits.

  To score a direct hit on a target in the danger space using cluster bomblet 
   munitions:
   Difficult, GunDM, BombardmentDM , 1 cmbt rd (absolute)
   Referee: The GunDM is +6 for this caliber of gun. The BombardmentDM is +2 
for converged sheaf, -1 for dispersed sheaf, -2 for shattered sheaf. A direct 
hit has a penetration of 26 and does 20 damage. The damage is modified by 
success normally according to the table on Pg 71 in the Players Manual to 
reflect multiple hits.

  To score a shrapnel hit on a target in the danger space using cluster bomblet
   munitions:
   Difficult, GunDM, BombardmentDM, 1 cmbt rd (absolute)
   Referee: The GunDM is +7 for this caliber of gun. The BombardmentDM is +2 
for converged sheaf, -1 for dispersed sheaf, -2 for shattered sheaf. A direct 
hit has a penetration of 8 and does 6 damage. The damage is modified by 
success normally according to the table on Pg 71 in the Players Manual to 
reflect multiple hits.

the undefined concept of "excess energy" applies to whatever is left over
after the life support and weapons systems are powered, NOT to whatever is
left over after the weapons systems, life support _and maneuver drive_ are

is most assuredly not what was intended.

out and interesting so far.  Permit me to retract my comments regarding
guerilla warfare as insufficiently considered, for the moment, and allow me
to make a few clarifications about some of the other implicit assumptions in
the narrative I posted:

Attacker\'s Superiority:  A numerical and/or 1-2 level technological superiority
on the part of the attacker was assumed, since I was more interested in 
discussing the mechanics of "ground" combat (obviously a bad name for a 
primarily air/near orbit battle) than I was in investigating fleet combat.
Thus the attacker can be beaten by the system\'s defenders early on, before
they ever get to the mainworld, if conditions are right (e.g. the defender has
numerical or tech level superiority, the defender concentrates all of his
forces instead of guarding all gas giants, whatever.)  We don\'t have to 
restrict discussion to what happens when the attacker wins the initial
space battle, but it won\'t shed any more light on the invasion phase.

Invasion vs. Bombardment: We are all agreed that you would only invade to
capture, not to destroy, correct?  Some interesting bombardment techniques
have been mentioned, but they are also divergent.

Planetary Defense Meson Guns:  The prospect of espionage seems to me to make
concealment difficult (perhaps not impossible), but how does anyone think the
Imperium feels about these guns?  Would they allow a planetary government to
build them as part of a secret program, or would they require the locations to
be on file somewhere in case the planet should rebel?  (That could make an
interesting adventure, by the way, whether to penetrate a regional database to
look for data prior to an invasion, or to try to erase the data from a center
in enemy hands.)  If the defending meson gun network cannot be located and it
is extremely capably, the invasion may end at that point.  An attacker _might_
be able to make some headway by flooding the planet with \'expendable\' craft
and staying as mixed as possible with the defenders.

Dogfight Phase:  I think that this would be the phase of decision, and that
it would be quite possible for the defender to win here.  I phrased my 
suggestion the other way, so I could offer an opinion on the \'mop up\'.  I
do think that it would make more sense for the defender to put everything that
will fly into the air as early as possible, because I think that the pace
of operations will make any imbalance grow rapidly.   If we had just seen a
European War instead of the Gulf War, I don\'t see the side with the inferior
air force trying to hide it, since it will be eroded piecemeal without being
able to shoot back.  That erosion may be slow, but it would happen, and the
attacker would have the advantage. Thus, even if the defenders are outnumbered,
it would probably be better to fight at odds of 1-3 than to save half your
forces and fight at odds of 1-6 twice.

Mop-Up:  Are we agreed that infantry would only be used for \'low intensity\'
portions of the operations? And that ground forces would be devastatingly
outmaneuevered?  (Making the TL12-13 tracked tanks in 101 Vehicles a little
silly...)

Occupation: Ruling a hostile population can only be done as long as that
population remains willing to be ruled.  If every person on the planet agreed
that it would be better to die than to live under Emperor X, then Emperor X
made a mistake in invading that planet because it will probably result in a
net loss of resources for him.  An incorrect assessment of the situation might
cause such an invasion to occur anyway.

Black Globes:  What happens if you turn a black globe on while sitting on a
planet\'s surface?

This has been a good discussion so far...

Hope you are all having fun.

"Hawk Among the Sparrows" is a great story--I tracked down and purchased
the appropriate 1968 issue of Analog one time to be sure to have a copy
to show to people.  I\'d be hesitant to use it as a model for cross TL
interaction in Traveller, though, because many of the problems cropped up
because there was no anticipated _need_ on the part of the aircraft\'s
designers to allow for meeting biplanes in combat.  A TL14-15 naval architect
in the Imperium _knows_ that his creations might be used against low tech
forces, and can plan accordingly.

Well, I\'m backing off of my earlier comments on guerilla warfare operations

True enough.  As it applies to the planetary invasion discussion, I don\'t
think it would make much difference, except to give an invader an occasional
slight surprise.  If modern U.S. forces invaded Anglo-Saxon England, they
might be surprised by nerve gas once, but they already have worked out the
countermeasures, so hopefully the AngloSaxons will make the most of their
one opportunity.

I think Scott is correct here.  Starship computers may include workstations
with all the peripherals, but vehicle and fighter control computers will be
specialized for one type of I/O and operation.  Thus, we have to assume that
the volumes given in the rule books are the actual volumes of the computers,
not including hypothetical workstation peripherals.

My first response would be to "wing it", since what you say makes sense.  I
also pointed out recently that having a Model 7 in your grav tank ought to
give you a noticeable +dm in vehicle combat, which is basically the same idea.

It does.  However, is there anything lost if we make the assumption that the
volume given for a piece of equipment includes the minimum necessary space
around it for maintenance and access?  That would explaing why a lot of heavy
metallic components (like internal combustion engines) get a gross density
equal to that of water...

The statement that modern subs have problems getting a mile deep is correct.
But, the problem is _far_ from having no place a mile deep to go!  Look at
any ocean chart and you\'ll find plenty of places (most of the ocean) has
numbers over "2000".  That "2000" is fathoms at 6ft per fathom or most of the
oceans over 12,000 ft or greater than 2 miles deep.

The biggest problem for submarines is getting material that is strong enough
to handle the forces at those extreme depths.  Given the materials at the
higher tech levels, this could be done for a military machine though.

But if a world was at a higher tech level with those advanced materials, why
would they need submarines?  I suppose one idea would be that a world was
advanced in tech level with respect to materials but not starship technology
or jump technology.

And as far as these submarines that are being talked about, what powers them?
As far as I can tell, a densitometer wouldn\'t be the optimal detector.  How
about a neutrino detector.  Any good submarine will have a self-sufficient
power source, i.e. nuclear plant or fusion plant.

I might be willing to post the TML to GEnie.  To avoid large expense I might
post whole bundles in the file library rather than a nightly TML download and
subsequent upload to the message area.  For one, they (GEnie) might get
irritated at the _very_large_ message some of the latest TMLs would create!
I would like further input from people on the list prior to this undertaking.
Specifically, the administrator.  {HEY JAMES, YOU OUT THERE??? :-)

Bundle uploads would also save me money since message posts are not free.

Yo! I\'m here, I\'m just doing my usual action of keeping my head down on
the list.  I\'d hate to be an admin who, like Rush Limbaugh on the radio,
uses the media as an organ for their own personal views, eschewing other
opinions.

There is a limited membership of TMLers who receive the 45kB archive
bundles as they fill up.  This is called the "Bundle Subscription
Service".  You don\'t get the guaranteed timely (ha!) response of the
digest, but you get the same set of messages in mangageable,
predictably-sized chunks.  This service may be useful to you, Carl.

Isn\'t there a direct mail link to GEnie? Does host aesd.dnet.ge.com
gateway email to GEnie? How many people on GEnie do you think would read
the TML bundles? And remember, there are now about 200 bundles worth of
TML back-issues - 9MB.  Do we want to add this to GEnie? Yow.  Food for
thought.  The floor is open for disgustion.  :-)

I hope to post a 4-year TML anniversary summary of messages and
membership soon.  It\'s now a couple weeks overdue.  Anyone else notice
that the TML has gone into high gear in July? Lots of interesting and
fun material.  Keep it coming, folks.

Hi,

Just reviewing the accusations against my sub.  Well,  She had an operationa
depth of close to 3 km, designed according to George Herbert\'s rule supp
(Great stuff George!)  At that depth she\'s going to be below densiometer
range.  She\'s got continental range passive sonar and the same densiometers
that an attacking drone would have.  She can pick em out before the drones
might.  Any drone that gets within range would need a meson com to say what
it has found, That means big fusion plant so easy detection.
The Sub is powered from geothermal plants so no neutrino emmsissions.

The Sub is FAR below the thermocline layer so EM level is probably ZERO
plus it will be hard to detect by sonar.

Also, the sub is the same gross density as water.  therefore Very hard to
detect in the surrounding medium and indestinguishable from a sunken ship.

Finding standard deep site meson guns:
Well, I still think that LADAR from orbit will be adequate to perform
sizemic analysis, after all you can use the same apparatus to monitor 
conversations in a room by monitoring the vibrations on a glass window
right?  Also remember that that can be done with just a few detection points
Now multiply that by the cubic volume of a densiometer scan and tell me
what you think that will do to increase signal to noise!!!

I really think with adequate computing power it should be a snap to find the
buried sites given the strength of the sensors available.

But here is one question related to the PDI (Psionic Defence Initiative)
How much Power, weight, Volume, Cost should it be to shield a vessel?
Any Ideas?

	Here is a question for you with military experience:

What is a realistic ratio for officers to enlisted for ships/ground forces?

More questions,

I just saw Terminator 2 etc. etc. last night, and after word got into
a little tete-a-tete with some friends about the Termintor T-1000.
 
I may have this wrong, but I beleive Arnie told us that our
- - - liquid-metal - friend was made from something called
- - - Mimetic Poly-Alloys -.
 
Given current advances in medicine and computerization, and projecting
a few more years into the future, would it be possible for some
- - - genetic-like - engineering tobe applied to metallurgy/physics/electronics
could you give this liqud metal a genetic capability?

In particular I refer to the T-1000\'s apparent ability to pull itself
together in extreme situations. (a vague description to purposely avoid
providing too heavy a SPOILER)

This ability is very similar to the idea that each human cell contains
all the information it needs to clone the original it came from.

Considering the Trav milieu, can this kind of Terminator be 
represented?

I can\'t remember the title of this film....it was one of the recent
disaster in deep sea, but meet a groovey alien, themes.

One of the nifty pieces of tech they used was a deep sea diving suit
in which the wearer breathed an oxygen impregnated liquid, to keep
his lungs from being crushed as extreme depths.

Would it possible to design such a submarine, in which the entire 
- - - atmosphere -  was a liquid.

If such a capability were possible, the sub wouldn\'t have to be extremely
large and powerful, if the threat of advantage were present in the
ability to maintain and strike from such ocean depths.

Could this significantly change the balance in favour of the defender,
during a planetary invasion?  Is this kind of technology possible

Huh?  In several scenes the CD101 keeps up with a moving TL8
ground transport.  In particular, in one scene it runs alongside
a moving truck, if I remember correctly.  On the other hand, it
doesn\'t seem to be able to match the top speed of these vehicles --
witness the fact that our heroes finally drove away from it at one
point (once they got the car turned around :-).

I would estimate 30MPH (50KPH) or more.

    'body' => '     Before I start unloading MY collection of vehicle designs on y\'all, I\'d
like to share some thoughts on...er, modifications to, the vehicle design
systems as it stands in the MT Referee\'s Handbook.
     Looking at the Armor Type Table, the Jump Drive Table and the Thrust-Based
Suspension Table, we notice an oddity that is not shared with most of the other
tables.  That is the interesting fact that the aforementioned systems do NOT
improve in performance or anything else with tech level.  Yes, you get new
types at various tech levels, but the older variants do not improve once
introduced!  Apparently, a TL 15 Free Trader uses a Jump 1 drive that costs the
same, takes up the same space, uses the same power, and has the same
performance as a TL 9 Free Trader\'s Jump 1 drive -- except that it requires
MORE controls!  How\'s that again??
     As for Armor Types, apparently having steelworkers in an early Industrial
era factory roll out your sheet steel is just as cost-effective as having the
TL15 robotic factory fusion-smelt it out of an asteroid, or whatever...Yeah,
sure.  As for Low-Power Hi-Grav and Low-Power Low Grav, apparently in 2000
years (the approximate time since the max Imperial TL was 12) NO ONE, NOT ONE
PERSON, has ever figured out how to produce said units more cheaply. 
Apparently, they were introduced at the ultimate stage of refinement, with no
improvements possible (except for adding on controls as TL increases).  How\'s
that again??
     Furthermore, this non-existant one person was not able to figure out how
to build Maneuver Drive size Low-Power Grav units for shipboard use either;
they are relegated to vehicle use only.  And I have some swampland on Dinom for
you.  Interested?
     After choking on the above improbabilities, I took out GURPS Ultra-Tech, 
lifted some ideas on equipment/weapon/etc improvement per tech level, and
liberally applied pen and pencil to the more objectionable parts of the Craft
Design Sequence.  I present to you my personal modifications to various tables
in the Craft Design sequence; take \'em or leave \'em as you see fit.

	Armor Type Table: Basically, I halved the price mod 2 Tech Levels above
the TL of introduction.  So my ATT looks like this:

	Jump Drives: I didn\'t want to tamper with the current set-up TOO much; I
ruled that the price of 3 MCr/unit applied at TL9, and jump drives cost 1.5
MCr/unit thereafter.  I assume the Imperial government and the Megacorps are
artificially supporting the price at a high level; some of the published
material has hinted as much.

	Thrust-Based Suspensions: Get real.  Tracks, Legs (!!), and Wheels all
improve with TL; the variations on Grav should, too.  I improved them by
lowering the price; you get more lift for your buck, as it were.

	14		Low-Power L-Grav		 8,000

	Maneuver Drive: I just added the Low-Power Gravs to the Maneuver Drive
Units table.  The prices are derived from the values on the table above; the
rest was worked out by calculating how much thrust one standard anti-grav
maneuver unit was putting out and crunching the numbers for the same
performance from the other grav units.  

	TL		Maneuver Drive Units	Power	Volume	Weight	Price
- - ----
	12		Low-Power H-Grav	13.0	32.5	19.5   750,000
	14		Low-Power L-Grav	 6.5	19.5	13.0  2,000,000 

	
	Oh yes, as Steve mentioned in his essay on Nuclear {fission & fusion}
powerplants last time, fission powerplant fuel consumption is strictly Twilight
Zone material.  We changed the fuel consumption to 0.002 kl/YEAR of
radioactives, not kl/hour!  It is close enough to the real thing to do.  

	The most obvious effect of the above changes is that SHIPS ARE CHEAPER! 
This is much to my liking, as I always thought ships were too damn expensive
and the profits too marginal for anyone to ever justify buying one in the first
place, let alone support the level of interstellar trade implied in the
published material.  There are some interesting effects in ship design in
introducing the Low-Power units; although they have a very high power-to-thrust
ratio, like standard anti-grav, the performance suffers beyond 10 diameters
from a world.  You make trade-offs.  For example, I have a series of very high
performance Interface fighters that use the LPLG units; more room for weaponry,
and more powerplant to run the weapons.  Since these fighters are intended for
near space use, the 10 diameter limit is not important; but, you don\'t want to
have to use them in a deep space fight!  Conversely, I have a re-working of the
old Sylea class 50-ton heavy fighter that uses thrusters; it\'s intended for use
as a deep-space, anti-fleet fighter.  I find that it is possible to resurrect
some of the old Traveller designs by use of the power-conservative Low-Power
Grav units; just be sure you really don\'t high performance in deep space.  For
example, merchant ships at TL 12 or higher will almost certainly mount LP-HGrav
maneuver drives; they aren\'t in that much of a hurry to get there, and the
savings in power plant volume and cost tends to more than make up for the
increased maneuver drive volume and cost.  I re-designed the Leviathan for MT
using LPHG... and I will post it one of these days.
	Oh yes, I base the control point requirements on the new, reduced costs. 
More efficient designs of old technologies should reduce or at least hold
constant the amount of buttons, switches, etc, etc, etc...it certainly should
not make it more complex, as it does under the existing rules.
	
	Next time, I start posting my ship designs!!

1. Rob, yes, the forces invading Anglo-Saxon England would quickly
adjust to the nerve gas attack. Then come the claymores. Then the radar
decoys, then... :-)

2. Traveller seems to be woefully lacking in kinetic kill weapons. For
instance, something likke the THOR system that was once proposed in the
80\'s would make a great ground suport weapon for orbital forces. How
*do* you stop what is essential a 5-20 kilo steel bar with *very* 
rudimentary steering and target identification? Especially when it\'s
coming in at orbital velocity!

3. Deep meson sites. Assuming an earthlike planet (crustal plates over
a fluid mantle), is it possible to design a a "sub-terrene" to house
the meson gun? This would be a *mobile* installation "swimming" thru
the mantle. While at rest, It could attach to the bottom of the crust, 
and use temperature differentials btween the mantle and crust for
power. Or it could use a reactor. Lots of luck getting close enough to
use a densitometer. 
	As for relaying sensor info to meson sites, it may be possible
to *broadcast* the info in some way. Does Traveller allow for neutrino
communicators? If not, other means *are* possible. Say by having the
relay site use a meson gun to cause deep explosions, modulating them
would send sound waves all around the world. Data rate would be low, 
but not impossibly so.

4. Someone made a comment about "you can put a *lot* of lasers on a
planet". This got me to thinking. If every public and commercial
building was required to incorporate a small ground to orbit capable
weapon (say a pulse laser with a low rate of fire), just how bad is
that for the attackers? 
	Using my example, so what if it takes the generator/solar
cellsa/whatever an hour to recharge the laser after every shot? There
are an *awful* lot of them in a fair sized city! Porcupine style
defenses have their points. 
	If the attackers were dumb enough to concentrate their forces
in orbit, a simple set of target co-ordinates over the public
communications channels (phone, cable, broadcast radio & tv) would
likely result in *billions* of pulses arriving in that area. With a
better job of control (more centralized) it might be possible to create
what I\'ll call a "phased array laser". That would be *really* nasty.
	But even localized control aiming at broadcast co-ordinates
ought to be devastating.

 on-line Traveller adventures, perhaps soon. He is very pleased at the
 activity he\'s seen here on the net (yes, he still reads what we post),
 and is rather excited about prospects.
      Beginning with HARD TIMES, GDW is planning to do a MegaTraveller
 product each quarter.  Most of those will be done in-house or by Chuck
 Gannon, the MTJ Consultant to Challenge.  Products will primarily
 relate to Diaspora Sector or the background for STAR VIKING rather
 than the Rebellion era.  As of last Thursday, Chuck Gannon has a
 contract for DIASPORA SOURCEBOOK, the follow-on to HARD TIMES.
      MTJ2 is out for Origins.  SOLOMANI & ASLAN will go to press in
 just a matter of weeks.  In fact, Mike Vilardi was finishing some of
 the interior illustrations as he sat behind the DGP booth.  (Sharp
 looking stuff!)

"bart@cs.uoregon.edu" asked about... in message 2564
why wont the t-1000 run as fast as a fastmoving car?
well, the cd-100 (arnie) said that it cant simulate moving parts
or machinery...therefore in order to propel itself, you have to imagine
a pirce of metal stretching each leg piece forward with each step, so
maybe there is a limit to how fast it can stretch it self, and how far..
otherwise it would look like that badly drawn cartoon show character
Plasticman (stretch ungodly distances really fast..)...but based on that
description, how does the t-1000 simulate a person? just on outside appearance?
because the human body sure has a lot of moving parts inside...

maybe there should be a terminator newsgroup! 8-)

Actually, subs can quite useful for all sorts of things. My friend Gerry was

  If you are to pop up into a primative society with all
sorts of neat technological tricks, you will probably get
burned as a witch. If you pull something really neat to 
get away (a cloud of tear gas for example) you will only
strengthen their resolve to do you in.
  People (if we are talking about the human variety) do not
react well to the unexplained. Throw in a little religious
neurosis, a dash of demonoic mythology, a bushel of 
superstition and a pinch of xenophobia and you\'ve got a real 
problem.
  The history of earth science shows us how powerful a
deeply entrenched religion (or two) can be. Recall the
persecution of Galileo, the inquisition in general, and the
problems that Jenner faced while doing the first work
with innoculation to prevent smallpox. More recently Bell
was told by investment bankers that they would dissaude
people from investing in telephones because they feared 
adverse public reaction to the technology. 
  Good general rule: people will behave as idiots ruled by
ignorance and fear even when it is not in their best 
interest. Our history is filled with far to many examples
of this fear and loathing of new technology. My grandmother
told me as recently as 1984 that I was ruining my life by
majoring in computer science. "It is obviously just a fad
and will pass. They are too expensive to do any good anyway."
  I am positive everyone has seen this trend at work. There
is always a person in every office who dreads it every time
a new computer is installed, new software arrives or some-
thing changes. This dread stems from a) this person will
be forced to learn something new b) this person may be 
forced to change something about how he does business
c) this person fears that computer will do its job so well
that he will no longer be needed. I have seen cases where
where this fear runs so deep that computers have been
*sabotaged*.
  These are things about human nature that you might well
keep in mind before you whup out some TL 7-15 "magic" 
around people who live at TL\'s 1-6. Trust me on this one.
I\'m a computer professional working in *Mississippi*. I know 
this problem and have only narrowly avoided being burned at

do as in the original MX proposal and have the meson guns on vehicles that move
randomly *in* the tunnels? To keep densitometers from detecting the meson 
vehicle in the tunnel, the tunnel sides are covered with grav-plates. This also
makes moving the vehicle easier. Seismic methods might also be defeated by this,
in a manner similar to \'active sound damping\'.
  That the tunnels exist, and where they are, are no secret. Where the meson gun
vehicles are at a given moment is secret, and probably impossible to detect or

  If I\'m allowed to diverge some more: The best method I\'ve heard of would
be to take a random asteroid, install jump and manuever drives on it, let it
accelerate to some awful velocity and program it for a jump to the 100 diameter
border of an enemy planet....
  It depends however on if a jump conserves the movement, and movement relative
to what, but we\'ve already had that discussion once:)

  I\'ve seen something called the \'Meson Gun Rebellion\' mentioned in some old
traveller papers, which might be a clue that this is a hotly contested question.

  It depends on if we are using modern air-war as the analogy or if we compare
the orbiting ships to modern artillery, and the grav-crafts to modern ground
forces. It makes sense for the defender to stay under cover as long as the 
attacker is out of range of their weapons. I also have my doubts about the 
effectiveness of small grav-crafts when used against naval vessels. Pounding on
the big ships are the tasks of the SDBs, the meson pits and the other space
defence installations. The purpose of the grav-crafts and other small crafts 
is to engage the attackers small crafts and grav-crafts when they appear in the
atmosphere.

  As for why the attacker would risk his small crafts before the defender is
totally neutralized, I can only offer two reasons:

  o  They would want the war over with within a resonable time-frame (To
     begin invading the next world presumably)

  o  It is hard to determine *if* the defender is neutralized unless he is
     forced to react to something the attacker does.

  Hmm, I tend to include grav-tanks and lift infantry in \'ground forces\'. If we
assume that it is easier to aquire a target in free air than one hugging the
ground it would be possible to have something looking like ground combat:
Both the attackers and the defenders grav forces can\'t use their entire 
potential because if they ventured too high, they would be blown away. The 
defender by the attackers orbiting ships, and the attacker by the defenders 
space defence lasers installed on every roof.
  [Gives a whole new dimension to \'Home defence\':)]

  I think that the globe would cut out a half-hemisphere below the generator,
not destroying it, but cutting all drainage pipes, power lines etc. This would
not be an issue if it was done in the wilderness.
  Some messages echoed from GEnie about BG\'s suggested another effect: That the
globe would begin to absorb kinetic energy from the surrounding molecules of
air or whatever, thereby absorbing heat from the environment until the sinks
are overloaded.
  Maybe there would become an insulating layer of frozen air around the globe
that slows this process, does anyone know the insulating properties of ice
made of oxygen and nitrogene?

Subject : Planetary invasions, defenses, etc.
 
In order for any discussion of planetary invasion to be meaningful, the extent
of the defense forces should be determined.  Using Trin ( one of those lovely
little TL15 Hi Pop worlds so beloved by the Imperium ) as an example, (and, as
usual, using Striker Rule 73, and listings of the Spinward Marches as
references) it is seen that Trin\'s planetary defense forces (read: Army)
should have a value of MCr 25,872,000.
Given that, for whatever arbitrary reason, we use 10% of that amount for deep
meson sites, and the associated sensors, we come up with :
 
           300 Factor-T meson guns, 
           power plants for same (distributed in small plants throughout the 
                        planetary crust, heavily ECM\'ed to prevent detection)
           1,362,727 TL14 passive EMS sensor arrays (and power plants for
                        same) scattered about the planet.
 
By the by, don\'t forget the near space defense spacecraft, infantry, cavalry,
armor, and other stuff.  They\'ll be in there, making an invasion unpleasant
and unproductive, too.
 
First, let\'s look at the sensor platforms and meson sites.  Trin is
Terra-sized, and so has those sensor platforms scattered all over the planet
about 22km apart over the entire surface.  Each of them can spot an object
10,000 meters above the planetary surface to a range of 350+ Km.  Therefore,
each point of the planet\'s surface is watched over by about 1000 sensor
arrays.  As long as the enemy knocks out less than 99.9% of the sensor net,
reasonably complete coverage can be maintained over the surface.  Any ship
coming within 50,000 Km of the planet can be removed by the combined fire of
300 spinal mount weapons.  Assuming the ships are approaching orbit at 4Gs,
they will be within that range for 26 minutes (plus or minus).  Unless a WHOLE
BUNCH of EXPENDABLE ships are sent at one time, the likely result is total
loss of all ships in that range bracket.
Note also that if the attacker has 12,000 warships, and if each of them
survives to destroy 100 sensor platforms, then the sensor system will be
reduced by 88%, and will still function pretty much as well as at start.
 
Assume 30% of the Army budget buys guys in battledress with FGMP-15s.  Then
you have an army of (about) 57,000,000 guys with FGMPs.  Using the Rebellion
Sourcebook, you get about 25,000,000 guys like that.  VERY difficult to remove
entirely, or even significantly.  Note that the FGMP has a range of 5000 
meters, more or less.  That can keep those attackers nervous, at least, as
they approach ground.
 
Assume another 30% in AFVs (imperial marine standard, from Striker), we get
about 4,000,000 AFVs...  Note that the main gun on an imperial marine grav APC
can punch holes (small ones, at least) in all but the heaviest battleship. 
They can scrape guns off the surface of even those battleships.  Put those
things up to about 15,000 meters, and the effective range of the weapons
become 1054 Km.  Quite adequate for denying orbital space to an attacking
fleet.  Keep them on the ground, and range is 105 Km, which is more than
enough to deny use of airspace near a battlefield.
 
 
Then, there is the system defense fleet.  About 5000 "flying Knives" (stats to
follow at the end of this ramble).  Any one is a match for anything less than
a battleship/battlerider.  Any six can butcher the best battleship in the
Imperium.
 
 
now, discussion.
 
Assuming the classic 3-to-1 odds for a successful assault, the Imperium would
require the resources of seven similar worlds to successfully assault Trin
(note that most of a world\'s resources are not interstellar capable).  Note
that the spinward Marches includes THREE other worlds similar to Trin.  The
closest (Mora and Glisten) are twelve parsecs away.  Four jumps at Imperial
standard J4 (note that the route must be slightly indirect due to stellar
placement).  That is a six week trip (five if you are lucky and fast).  The
trip from the USA to France in WWI was only three weeks long.  About the same
in WWII (excluding aircraft, which could transport only a small amount of the
needed war materials).
 
Admittedly, the Solomani Rim, for instance, has a great many such worlds
crowded together.  It also has worlds like Terra and Muan Gwi which make Trin
look like a deserted cross-roads at midnight.  Still the same problem, just
more ships, and equipment.
 
 
 
As to tactical (as opposed to logistic) concerns - the "dogfight" described in
an earlier post is wonderful, except that it ignores the possibility of
"stealth" ships for reconnaissance and some combat use.  Note that a such a
vehicle will be included after the "flying Knife".  It also assumes that all
ships follow the GDW pattern of massive offense, trivial defense.  A ship with
heavy defenses and light offenses can survive a lot longer, and cause that
phase of the conflict to last that much longer.  And the longer it takes, the
worse for the attacker.  Note that the defender doesn\'t really need to knock
out the attacking battlewagons.  it needs to knock out the transports and
landing vehicles.  Saves a lot of wear on the nerves when you can ignore all
the tough parts of the enemy fleet.
 
The "mop-up" phase is another amusing idea that depends on the defender
cooperating.  It assumes that the defender\'s sensor nets will be destroyed at
a higher rate than the attacker\'s.  Assuming the defender understands, this,
he can target the attacker\'s sensors specifically to delay the attacker. 
Remember that anything that stretches the attack out will help that long
supply line to cause the attacker problems.
 
Then there is the "non-existant" guerrilla phase.  Anyone out there care to
guess the most effective weapon for a guerrilla on Trin???  Assuming that a
miracle happens and all the meson sites\' sensors are destroyed, the army
destroyed, the world occupied...
 
Gauss rifle?
FGMP?
snub pistol?
 
no.  Try the telephone, instead.
 
Assume that the control computers for the deep-meson guns include a map of the
location of every phone on the planet.  Assume that a phone used to call is
automatically located by the meson gun control system.  Pick up a phone, dial
a number that links to the meson gun control system, tell them that a cruiser
is 12 Km south of you, hang up!  the control determines the position, aims the
guns, and obliterates the cruiser.
Make sure there are a few dozen million numbers that get into the meson gun
control system (there are ten billion possible numbers in the US phone system,
not to mention the overseas connections.  Plenty to spare).  Include a million
or so numbers that require no message - call the number, and the meson guns
obliterate everything within 1000 meters of the calling phone.  The caller
dies, and so do all the enemy troops and ships near him (a good trade if you
are into that sort of thing)
 
 
Note that if planetary invasions were easy, then the five frontier wars would
have included a lot more territory changing hands.  
 
 
And have any of you noticed that during the last few months all the
assumptions about planetary invasions look like Desert Storm?  Last year they
all looked like D-Day.  Strange...  
Has anyone ever tried to play one out, using TCS campaign rules, or other of
your choice.  Try it about six times.  After each trial, rework the attacker
and defender to incorporate lessons learned, or new ideas.  Then, you MIGHT
have an idea of how an invasion works in MT.
 
 
 
And for those of you having a hard time setting up defenses for your TL10
worlds, how about the "treatymaker" (traveller model)? --

It can also blow a hole 450+ meters in diameter in your average battleship.
Since your average battleship is less than 1200 meters long, over 30% of the
ship would evaporate under that light.  Alas for that former Imperial
battleship.
 
Remarkable digression that, but I\'ve always loved that as an example of an
EXTREMELY powerful weapon.  Consider it as a spinal mount sometime.  Makes a
nice change of pace from the meson guns.
 
 
 
I digressed too much.  The "flying Knife" and stealth ship will follow on
another post.

The Sikkintar (Flying Knife) class SDB/Battlerider was developed privately by
Vospor/Trin as a vessel which could be used as the riders on the new "Norway"
class Battleship or as a SDB filling the requirements for the X-1111 heavy SDB
as specified by the Trin System Defense Squadron.
As is obvious from the spec sheet, this vessel is designed to fit a large meson
gun on the smallest platform that the requisite defenses could be fitted to.
Basic design assumption was that a spinal mount meson gun was worth more than
ANY possible combination of secondary weapons in a general fleet action.  The
Sikkintar was intended to put more spinal mounts out per MCr than was feasible
using alternate design philosophies.
Note also that the basic concept could be (and is being) upgraded to include a
meson gun-T by increasing the tonnage to 9000, and scaling up whatever needs to
be scaled up.
Note that this ship is designed using standard MT rules (plus any good idea that
came across the TML), not our house rules.  Note that the original design used
last edition High Guard, which made the design much easier.

Re:  tried and true vs. "modern" stuff.
 
 
I noticed a post recently discussing the relative merits of new technology
versus "tried and true" technology from 150 (plus or minus) years before.
 
 
A novel idea...
 
Can I have a show of hands, please?
 
How many of you all still use horse and buggy for transport?
 
How about those who think the army should use percussion caps?  flintlocks?
 
How many think we should not trust the airplane for at least 60 more years?
 
Any one still using Pony Express?  How about clipper ships?  Horse-drawn
plows?  
 
Come on.  150 year old technology looks like the stone age from today.  Why
should it look any different to the people of the Imperium?
 
Besides, the example was ridiculous.  If the factory has modularized the 150
year old junk, why shouldn\'t it modularize the new stuff?  Did they forget how
in the last few centuries?
 
 
As to the notion of a perfected design, last time I looked, it took longer to
perfect a design than the useful lifespan of the design.  The next generation
device comes along long before the last was perfected.  Look at AFVs.  For
that matter, the only gun design ever "perfected" was the flintlock.  The
others were superseded before the bugs were worked out.
 
 
Note that the Imperium reached TL15 40 years before the Rebellion.  It reached
TL14 100 years earlier.  I suspect that most of the bugs of most high tech
devices were about as "perfected" as they will get.  After all, the Imperium
is drifting into TL16 now.
 
 
 
BTW, to digress (AGAIN?!?), how many of you have noticed that the history of
the Darrian people, as published in the Darrian module, makes no sense at all?
The assumption that the TL16 starships of the Darrians lasted 2000 years is
ludicrous.  There are rules for TL16 ships, and longevity is not mentioned. 
Therefore the Darrian TL16 squadrons were built in the present era, and
Darrian has been a FUNCTIONALLY TL16 culture for centuries, at least...
 
Food for thought...

	Here\'s the first of several ship designs; these are all designed using
the modified design rules I posted the other day.  You may want to recalculate
agility to fit your favorite method of figuring agility; the MT method as
written made no sense, so I used the old High Guard definition of Agility.  I
assume that the Imperium has some safety regulations requiring that all ships
have enough emergency power to run a radio and life support in the event of
main power plant failure; therefore all my ship designs will have solar cells,
supplemented by fuel cells if necessary.  I also assume that it is desirable
to be able to conduct EVA in vacuum or unbreathable atmospheres; almost all my
ship designs have 2 or more airlocks.
 
	This ship was the predecessor to the new Donosev Class Scout
Surveyor.  It has seen duty all over the Imperium, and was the workhorse of
the Third (?) Imperial Grand Survey.  Many are available as surplus (at
considerably lower prices) now that the Donosev Class is replacing it.  Note
that it was designed for stealth, the ability to maintain station for a
long time surveying a system, and to carry a large party of scientists/
surveyors.

an auxilary craft on many scout vessels, including the ubiquitous Type S
Scout/Courier.  Note rather different performance between running empty with 1
or 2 passengers and running fully loaded with 11 tons of cargo in the back.

The Highlander class is a Louis & Clark Class Scout Surveyor modified for
merchant use; in this case, extra armament was added, and the computer was
upgraded.  Note the use of 25MW vehicular Beam Lasers for point defense; in
space, the range is entirely adequate for such use, and it is unnecessary to
use the full power of a 250MW ship\'s laser to blow up unarmored missiles. 
Also note the use of Fusion Y guns for close-range combat; at the short range
of, say, a boarding attempt, the Y guns are capable of turning the average
(armor 40-60) corsair or pirate\'s hull into so much Swiss cheese.  
     Also note Darrian computers; listed as 7(fiber-optic) rather than 7fib
because 7fib is a conventional computer with fiber-optic backup and is priced
to reflect the redundancy; Darrian computers are purely fiber optic, no backup
involved.  Note the use of extendible solar panels to increase the level of
"emergency" power, and additional fuel capacity added in the form of external
tanks and a collapsible tank in the hold -- Highlander is intended for
extra-Imperial exploratory trading, a la Leviathan.  Highlander refit designed
by Steve Higginbotham.

That wasn\'t bogustech they were feeding us in "The Abyss." Oxygenated

though; a lot like a Dolphin ship but even weirder to live in.... I wonder
if there would be any advantages?

I\'m going to pass along your ship design suggestions to Dow Rieder, assuming

	There are some very simple explanations for why costs stay pretty level
for items... they tend to 8-)
	If you think about it, they really aren\'t.  For instance, if you get
5 kl of TL15 Fusion Powerplant, it will generate a lot more power than 5 kl of
TL11 plant, though they cost the same.  You can assume that equipment designers
keep increasing sophistication as material costs drop, improving performance
but keeping overall cost about the same.  Most equipment is either constant cost
(implying performance rises with TL) or constant cost per wt/volume, which
indicates fixed performance but decreasing size and cost.  Much of the same...

	As for steel and materials... It\'s been pointed out that modern steel
isn\'t that much cheaper in constant-money equivalent than the first mass-
producable bessemer steels.  Most materials don\'t get cheaper after the first
good mass-production techniques are developed.  Some cheaper, but not a lot.
They get \'cheaper\' to use because overall economic levels go up, so that
there\'s more money to spend on it, but the \'real\' cost stays constant.
	Yes, materials will get cheaper, but the most significant impact of this
is when you\'re talking about right around their introduction.  For about one
TL, they\'re incredibly expensive (before engineers know how to make it), 
then as TL rises they quickly level off at some reasonable price.  If you 
really want to play with materials, just introduce them at double or triple cost
one tech level early... (see: experimental test craft), or \'pushing the limits
of current technology\', always a real popular item with the PR people but less
so with most production engineers 8-)

Fabulous!

Actually, Cynthia, have you checked out the archives of vehicles?  I\'m not
certain, but I\'m pretty sure that Rob Dean posted a MegaTrav Leviathan
from the GDW adventure.  Before you spend a lot of effort I think you might
take a look at what designs are already available.

I posted a bunch of High guard conversions for Supp 9 Fighting ships, and
other stuff:  Shivva patrol Frigate, plus numerous original stuff.
On the other hand, perhaps the other design nuts might like to compare your
conversions with theirs.  But please by all means send your designs in.

As to your modifications, Here are my OWN opinions, not colloberated by
anyone else.

1)	You are right about control points.  I try to use the lowest TL
at which performance is not affected when calculating Control points.
Therefore:  A jump one drive at TL9 should have the same #CP at TL15.
At TL17 (or something like that) the performance is affected (fuel consumption
drops) therefore calculate CP\'s with TL 17 as a minimum.  But where
the craft\'s performance is affected you have to use the higher Tech level.
ie A TL14 ground car with wheels may have the same weight, cost, volume, 
and power consumption, for it\'s transmission and suspension as a TL9 car,
but it\'s speed is much faster.  So use TL14 Dig?]

2)	About, Price of components dropping.  Well, I see your point, but
I don\'t quite agree.  At TL6 hard steel is first used, maybe a TL15 corp
can produce it cheaper, but that money would probably go into a higher
profit margin for the manufacturer.  After all, The consumer is willing to
pay the extra at TL6, so we fix the price and rake in more cash!
	The thing that will really make prices drop is if the company can
make a lot of a certain unit,  Increased volume, decreased cost.
ie.  The one millionth grav unit produced is going to cost less than the
second the company produced.  On the other hand, that cash is again
probably not going to be passed on to the consumer.

So what am I suggesting to you?
Well, If you feel ships are too expensive, then charge less, but I would
make the cheaper ships not generally available.  It is okay to reduce price
for players (hey look at this ship that fell off the back of a jump tender)
Or more likely, they bought one Free Trader out of Ling Standard Products
run of 2000 ships manugfactured.  But calculate them as normal price.

Personally My feeling is that ships are too cheap.  Look at the cost of a
single TL8-9 radar evading bomber:  approx 500 million$, if rate of
exchange is approx 1Cr=1$, then the B-2 cost much more than a lot of starships!

On another note, I think I came up with a possible solution for low cost]
small vehicle computers.  Review the problem:

A TL5 car with a top speed of 100kph, has the same performance as a TL8 car
with same top speed, which presumably has antilock braking, active suspension
etc.

Example:
A car is driving on slick roads toward a wall.
TL 5 car hits the breaks skids and hits wall
TL 8 car hits the breaks (performs identical task roll) skids and hits wall.

According to the rules you have to add a model 1 computer to get a Plus 1
That\'s almost a million credits for a lousy +1 on the dice!

Suggestion:
A robot brain, with no command or logic program, just enough CPU for a
skill of Vehicle-1,  The computer multiplier would be 1, allowing you to
use linked panels without a big heavy costly computer, as is implied in
101 vehicles to be possible.
The brain isn\'t big enough to be an autopilot, just sufficient to aid in
controlling the vehicle, somewhat like a fly by wire system.  (note that
in COACC the computer aided fly by wire does not require a computer from the
tables) {if one was required it would have to be three such computers,
because that\'s how computer aided fly by wire works [at least in the X-29]}

All in all,
Please send your designs!!!

Here is a quick question:

When a ship using a laser communicator is firing a sandcaster, won\'t that
really mess up transmission?

That is the reason I have always used masercoms as opposed to lasercoms.

What are the prevailing opinions?

A while ago I asked a question which no one picked up.

Now maybe it wasn\'t a very interesting question, but the lack of traffic may
indicate a possible answer.

The question was:  Has anyone ever used K\'Kree or Hivers successfully as
player characters or even NPC\'s?

If no one answered, am I to surmise that No one uses them successfully,
actually, that Would be my guess...

Hello,

	Bertil, I THINK (correct me, if anything) that your Vargr vehicle
designs have a slight error - 

>VARGR THONGHSUDH ARTILLERY VEHICLE
>  CraftID: Thonghsudh Artillery Vehicle, TL13, MCr 6.874
>     Hull: 116/296, Disp=8, Config=1AF, Armor=40F, Unloaded=147tons, 
>           Loaded=176tons

Unless I am gravely mistaken - Displacement of 8 gives 108kl hull which, in
turn gives 108/15=7.2rounded=8 points to Inoperative. Why is the arty listed
as having 116/296?

I don\'t know about advantages, but the one *big* disadvantage is that it
would kill the crew! :-)

Seriously, super-oxygenated CFCs as a breathing medium have been studied
for years (I think Duke U. has been one of the centers for study).  The
rat in "The Abyss" really was breathing fluid.  If a human were to try
the same thing, they\'d suffocate.  The problem is one of volume, the
reason a rat can breath fluid while a man can\'t is the same reason an
ant can carry 30 times it\'s own weight.  Muscle power drops by the square
of the volume.  For a human to breathe fluid, he/she would have to push
hundreds of times the volume of a rat\'s lungs worth of fluid in and out
of their human lungs.  The human diaphragm isn\'t strong enough to do that.
It tests on fluid breathing, rats lived (low enough lung volume), and
dogs died after about 15 minutes (due to muscle spasms in their diaphragms,
caused by exhaustion).  Unless a fluid with a much lower density (one
approaching air) can be found, fluid breathing for humans is strictly in
the realm of SF.

Regarding deep subs a hidden meson gun platforms, I suspect that it\'s
an exercise in futility after about TL 10.  Even now (what are we? TL 8?),
we can image deep (> 1 mile) ocean currents from LandSat, using thermal
imaging techniques.  (There was great article about this in Scientific
American sometime in the last 2 years, but after over an hour of searching
last night, I couldn\'t find it.)  If we have this capability now, image
what a TL 15 thermographic scanner/magnetometer combination can do!!
Any H2O ocean will be as transparent as glass.

I think the sub-tectonic meson platform has a better shot at concealment.

By the time of the Imperium, the human race (and the technology it relies
on), should be so alien, we would be unable to recognize, let alone
comprehend, it.

As an aside, it should also be pointed out that language and social
evolution follow a similiar (if less accelerated) pattern.  Even assuming
we understood the technology, we would probably be unable to interact

One possible problem with Vinge\'s supposition is that it fails to take
into account that people must apply the technology that has been
discovered, and this takes time.  The biggest limiting factor to the
growth of technology, as I see it, are the factors of societal
communication and understanding.  It takes time for engineers to
incorporate new ideas, it takes time to develop proficiency in their
use, it takes time to bring people up to speed, and large projects where
many new technological advancements are put together have a high risk of
failure.  Look at the failure of the first n Mariner space probes, the
incredible cost of the Space Shuttle, the Sergeant York program, Hubble,
Galileo, the Soviet Mars moon probes, and the NeXT computer.

I feel that, since there is a limited capacity and speed to which humans
can (or WANT to) absorb information and knowledge, and there is a
limited speed with which Systems Technology can be pushed forward, that:

	[[[ James\' Maxim of Technology Advancement ]]]

	You can\'t push technology faster than it can be
	communicated, understood, incorporated, and perfected.

To bring 10,000 worlds, or even 100 along with you, vastly slows the
pace of technology growth, and results in much duplication of effort.
In today\'s world, even bringing the 50 United States, Europe, and Japan
along with you on a world with instant communication, takes time.  How
many wonderful new ideas have been sitting on desks for 20 years waiting
for the rest of technology to catch up?

Regarding these facts, I\'ve always had a really difficult time believing
that a structure as large as the Imperium could ever exist as a single
political entity - a heavily divided Imperium makes more sense to me
from the standpoint of technological innovation and parallel discovery.

Yes, we are in the age of technological growth.  I see advancements in
complexity going exponential, but I see systems technology growing
linearly.  I see improvements in computer speed growing exponentially,
but the software technology bogging down in complexity management.

What about ceramic high-temperature turbine-powered drive-by-wire
automobiles? One innovation at a time, please! Serial, not parallel
improvement.  New ideas on a proven base.  It\'s they way human
engineering and technology transfer works.  The human mind has a limited
capacity to absorb and use new ideas.

Enough ramblings and food for thought.  I\'m not 100% committed to all
these ideas, the floor is open for discussion...

UK TMLers, and TMLers in general,  Hello!

We have had a rash of TML delivery problems lately.  This has been
because the Tektronix->Internet gateway machine was not rewriting the
From:, Sender:, and Resent-From: fields to values palatable to the
outside world.  Mail that should have left Tektronix with the address
"jamesp@metolius.wr.tek.com" ended up leaving with the header addresses
"jamesp@metolius.wr".

Some mail sites and gateways outside Tek look upon these most bogus
headers with terror, Just Say No, and throw it in the trashcan icon as
quickly as they can, sending a copy to the local mail admin dude who
gets irate and sends me a complaint.  Other mail transfer programs see
the bad headers, look away in disgust, and forward the mail anyway.
Still others Just Don\'t Care and send the mail on to the recipient
without a clue that something is rotten.

Anyway, the root cause of the problem, an arcane and slightly wrong
sendmail.cf file at the corporate mail gateway, was band-aided last
night before the digests went out, in a mostly successful attempt to
correct the problem.  This problem had been fixed once before, but like
most computer problems, cleverly figured out how to break itself a
second time.  When the corporate gateway admin returns from vacation
Monday, he will commit a more official fix and try to make sure it
doesn\'t break itself again.

Thank you all for your patience.  Let the missed-back-issues requests
commence!

This is only true if the underlying technology needs to be widely
communicated, which may not be the case.  Joe Citizen does not need
to re-learn how to drive a car, just because fuel injection, power
steering, and catalytic convertors get introduced.  A closer example
would be the introduction of RISC architectures in UN*X workstation
SPUs.  While these provide an order-of-magnitude (in some cases)
performance improvement in the computer, only a small sub-set of the
total user base (the system administrators) need any supplemental
training to take advantage of the new technology.  To all the other
users, the change is transparent; their programs just run faster.

If the advances in technology occur in the information and communication
industry, then the rate of increase may go even faster.

With the possible exception of Galileo and the NeXT computer, these failures
can be directly attributed to mismanagement and political infighting, not
the inability to disseminate new technology.  (This is *not*, however, true
for the Sgt. York.  It was a piece of sh*t from the start.  But I digress...)

I don\'t think you can make a blanket statement about the entire human race
like that and get it to hold water.  While a fundementalist Christian (or
some other individual with strong political, cultural, or religious views)
may say, "I want nothing to do with TV, even though it will make me better
informed, since it can be a corrupting influence and is therefore a tool
of the devil.", a starving Ethiopian would almost certainly embrace radical,
new farming techniques, if the alternative was death from hunger.  Closer
to home, what technophile TML member would not snatch up a new technology
offered to them, if it would make them wealthy or make life easier for
them.  I maintain the once a society becomes comfortable with \'high
technology\', it becomes easier to continue to introduce \'higher technology\'.

No argument here.  I just think that the new technology is being
communicated, understood, incorporated, and perfected faster all
the time.  I cannot believe that mankind has some inherent \'upper
limit\' for accepting these changes.  The limit is cultural, and
since the culture is modified by the new technology, and vice-versa,
I don\'t see any immediate obstacle to accelerated assimilation.

OK, now this is a different story.  I had intended the Vinge example to
apply to a single world.  When you talk about the Imperium, you are suddenly
faced with the light (or jump-6) barrier as an absolute propagation speed
limiter.  Also, one cannot assume that a new technology will be disseminated
planet wide the instant it arrives from space, *unless* it is the latest
in a smooth series of innovations.  However, this is an ideal situation,
and hardly likely to occur.

If the hardware speed can advance, why can\'t the software\'s ability to
maximize the performance do likewise?  Just because it hasn\'t yet doesn\'t
mean it won\'t.  As for linear growth, processor speed is currently
increasing geometrically (currently about 2x per year), not linearly.

Not true!  all three concepts (ceramic engines, turbines, and drive-by-wire)
were developed independently of one another.  None of those ideas had to
wait for any of the others to be perfected before they could work.
Synthesis is the fundemental nature of innovation.  Right now, the only
thing preventing all three concepts from being incorporated in next year\'s
Chevrolet is one person with a sufficiently large checkbook. :-)

As for the human mind having a limited capacity to absorb and use new
ideas, that may be, but we\'re nowhere near the limit.  Using a work-
station running X-Windows, I can absorb an order of magnitude more info
today than I could have on an ASCII terminal 5 years ago.  I maintain
that the *true* limiting factor is the efficiency of the data interface.
Vinge agreed with this and postulated a direct mind-machine neural link.
the most efficient way to inform a person is to pump the date directly
into the head, in a fashion that doesn\'t overwhelm the recipient.  How
one does that is still in the realm of SF, but I believe it *will* take
place, eventually.

Well, in my initial post on this subject I was assuming that the 
heavy planetary defenses, meson gun sites and what have you, would
be the main reason that you wouldn\'t leave your fleet hanging in an
orbit within firing range of the ground.  Instead, you\'d send in the
troops and small craft to either force the defenders to respond (and
be destroyed when identified) or track them down and destroy them
one at a time.  Since I figured that the attacker would _not_ have the
substantial orbitting fire support in the early phases of the operation,
so as to keep them from being decimated by the meson guns, I felt that
it would be to the defenders advantage to come up and fight.

See above on orbitting attackers prior to neutralization of the heavy 
defenses.  Maybe it would be profitable to think of these things for a
moment as 16" coast artillery, helicopters and helicopter carriers...

I am not including grav equipped forces in with the \'ground\' troops 
unless they are dismounted infantry.  I only mention \'pure\' ground
troops at all because of the existence of TL12+ tracked tank designs
in the <somewhat less than adequate> 101 Vehicles book from DGP.  If you
are willing to go even a little above NOE you can still get around pretty
fast and therefore avoid having the enemy concentrate against you with
superior mobility to defeat you in detail.

      I hate to be an apologist for the rules, because I think that
some really stupid things have been done over the years, but Darrians
was produced before the MegaTraveller rules, with the first ever TL16+
design information available to us, was on the market.  As a result,
it doesn\'t have, uh, total forward compatibility.  TL16 was *magic* in
the good old days, much like we\'d think of TL21 as we play the game 
now...

Hello,
 
  A number of people (including me) have been arguing about planetary
invasion. Without going into the relative merits of deep meson guns
versus orbital defence belts, I would like to pose a number of questions
cum comments, as follows:
 
  The prices of various armaments are just paper money to us, the
vehicle designers and wargamers - what do we care if the Meson-T gun is
MCr3,000 or MCr3,500? However, assuming a limited GPP (Gross Planetary
Product) and a limited defence spending, how many are produced? How many
warships and assault tenders?
 
  The very fact that spending is limited would favour an attacker or
defender who balances the quantity of medium priced combat vehicles with
a quality of high priced combat vehicles (be these vehicles TL9 grav
tanks or TL15 super dreadnoughts). There may be 5 Atlantis battleships
(Robert Dean\'s Prize Baby :-) in a star system, but a mixed force can
outmaneuver it and perform a planetary landing.
 
  On another hand - a planetary assault may take place WITH THE CONSENT
of the defender - if an attacker finds himself faced with an apparently
impenetrable defence belt, he may just give up the idea of an assault
and accelerate a few medium sized asteroids at the target planet. Thus a
situation similar to a battle of Maldon may arise - the defender
granting battlespace to the attacker.
 
  If the above comments hold true the deciding stage in an invasion
would be how much of the attacking force can the defender destroy before
an engagement on the world surface, but without making him desperate
enough or hurt enough to bombard and jump outsystem. This may or may not
be the fine art of generalship in the future.
 
  The future batlefiled itself depends very much on the concept of
anti-gravity. If it invented (and within Traveller it is assumed so),
filed artillery and infantry will rapidly decline in importance. Indeed,
infantry is losing importance even now, long before even air-cushion
combat vehicles have appeared.
 
  Infantry shall continue to be used in city assaults, police and
security work, shipboard actions and heavily broken areas combat.
Artilley shall probably lose all almost all use except for the most
rapidfiring cannon in light anti-vehicle combat.
 
Yours,

But on a more serious note:  Matter Transport in trav.
The subject is addressed in detail in adventure 12 Secret of the Ancients
Basically the Transporter of Star Trek falls into the catagory of 
ancient artifact level of technology.  Frankly, It\'s just a mite too powerful
a device to be standard equipment on your average type S scout.

There are a few ways of performing Teleportation, but If I remember rightly
they aren\'t much better than the ordinary Psionic Teleport skill.

Mr. Scott

Speaking of bad movies I just saw Saturn 3:  DUMB Flick
It did have one neat idea though that might be usable in Trav:  at one
point the guy uses a breaching charge which is sprayed out of an aerosol
container.  It struck me as a neat possible weapon.  (keep that can away
from heat or flame!)

And while I\'m on the subject of weapons, Has anyone come up with a design
for the good old TL6 support weapon which can take down a guy in battledress

Yes, the old FLame Thrower?

Just rambling

I don\'t know about how well imaging from landsat works for the bottom of

You need some form of ultra refrigeration to keep your hull from slagging
perhaps you could use the meson gun as a heat dump, but you have to do
some considerable cooling to keep such a sight habitable.  At TL15 I don\'t
see it happening.  Maybe as an ancient artifact but not TL15.

	Going by my previous example, the price of a installation for a 
deep meson weapon probably approaches that of the weapon itself.
	Given that assumption, it\'s likely that putting in a lot of mid-sized
(bay) meson sites is a great advantage to the defence...
	IF they have secure and reliable communications.

	Think on this one, a bit... rather than a \'national guard\', give
everyone on the planet a combo pack of the following:
	Laser Rangefinder/direction finder (PRIS Binocs do fine)
	Inertial Locator
	x range masercom (determined by other constraints)

	How is this useful?  Well... Mr. Ikaron is sitting on the porch of his
farmhouse when a company of TL14 Zhodani grav tanks flies overhead.  Mr. Ikaron
has the standard Imperial reaction to psionics, and goes into the house to 
check out the news reports and get his \'Designator\'.  When he hears static on
the radio AND his cable holovid, he knows something is up.
	Walking outside, he points the masercom at a nearby hill he\'s been told
has a relay station on it.  Initializing his setup, he then points the 
Designator at the nearest tank and pushes the designate button.
	Within about a hundredth of a second, the 3-d position and speed of
the tank has been transmitted out to the relay site, and in another hundredth
of a second reaches the local deep defense coordination center.  It takes
another hundredth of a second for the computer to process the information,
give it a relatively high priority (being an opportunity target, with no
defences, it a pretty good target).  Less than five-hundredths of a second
after Mr. Ikaron pushed the button, one of 100 hundred-ton sized deep meson
sites has been pre-empted from assault-transport bashing and retargeted 
for the time being on a tank.  It takes all of about a tenth of a second to
retarget and fire.
	Less than a fifth of a second after the button was pushed, the Zho
tank commander sees the \'laser designation\' warning light flash on his control
panel, but before he has time to react his tank explodes, only about 10 meters
from the center of a 50 meter radius meson detonation.  There has been no time
to dodge, not even enough time to slew a point-defence weapon to bear on Mr.
Ikarion, who survives.  Scratch nearly 15 megacredits of tank.
	
	And the best part is that that collection of equipment needs not cost
more than about Cr 15,000 .  At TL 15, with standard defense budgets, it
wouldn\'t take that long to have one in every house...

	Traveller large-scale warfare is simply horrifying.  There are soooo
many ways to kill something...

ENclosed are the final versions of the Mercenary Division Vehicles.
Some were redesigned, a number of new designs added and a Phalanx-like
vehicle was inspired by Rob Dean.

                Cyclops Heavy Fire Support Vehicle Mk II
 
 
  The Cyclops HFSV is intended to provide long range, heavy, fire
support for the initial stages of planetary invasions. Carrying enough
armour to withstand hits from all weapons at TL10-13 short of major ship
weaponry, it can engage targets at a range of 50,000km.
 
  The main hull is almost all powerplant, grav unit and fuel. The pilot,
secondary weaponry and other subsystems are distributed among the weapon
turrets. To offset this disadvantage, the control system has been
provided with a large holographic display, which compensates for the
turret rotation automatically.
 
  Despite carrying a power plant capable of lighting a fair sized town,
the space limitations have resulted in a maximum speed of only 720 kph.
This is considered unacceptable by any standard, and a redesign
programme is contemplated.

  The landing of infantry on a hostile world is an endeavor wrought with
danger, an endeavor the Daisun APC is designed to cope with. Carrying an
infantry squad in a heavily armoured hull this APC is able to enter the
atmosphere from orbit and bring the soldiers to world surface in face of
hostile opposition.
 
  In recent operations, two problems came to be regarded as of highest
importance - the lack of PD capable weapon and the small weapon load.
These were rectified and the new model, Daisun Mk IIx is now in the
pre-production testing stages.

                        Banshee Signals Vehicle
 
 
  The Banshee is a member of the Wraith family of vehicles designed to
serve as a fast and mobile signals unit. Equipped with a very extensive
sensor and communication suite but light armour, the Banshee is not
intended to participate in TTT (tank to tank) engagements, but to follow
the battle from a distance and to provide communication and sensor
services for the main force. One model 1/bis computer is dedicated to
communications routing an can supervise, route and operationally
integrate 144 channels simultaneously.
 
  Weapons, installed in a remote turret, are intended for point defence
and AP fire. The three lasers are co-axial and are governed by a single
point defence targeter. There is enough excess computer power and power
supply (14 MW) to replace the weapon suite with more powerful weapons,
if desired.

  The Duergar is a member of the Wraith family of vehicles. Developed to
complement Zombie tanks, mainly in engagements with heavy use of
anti-laser means, it is equipped with a 140mm cannon. Removal of the
laser armament allowed a significant decrease in power requirement,
resulting in the maximum speed increase of more than 18% and endurance
increase of 26%. For AP and PD fire, a rapid pulse plasma gun has been
installed in an independent barbette.

                           Ghost ADA Vehicle
 
 
  The Ghost, a member of the Wraith family of vehicles, is intended to
supplement a mobile task force and provide it with PD and AP fire. Five
lasers, each with its own point defence targeter in an independent
barbette can engage targets at short and medium ranges. Unlike the other
non-tank versions of the Wraith, the Ghost class vehicles are intended
to take part in TTT engagements and retain the full tank armour.
 
  The Ghost has enough spare power (8.7MW) to augment its weapon or
sensor suite, as needed.

                         Selkie Light Grav Tank
 
 
  The Selkie, designated light only because of its armament, is a
development of the Wraith grav tank. The weapons are installed in a
remote turret and the crew is inside the hull. The Wraith design has
been copied even to the point of carrying a heavy fusion gun and a laser
but the decreased power requirement of the Selkie allowed a bigger grav
unit to be installed and thus the speed has been drastically increased.

                           Wisp Recce Vehicle
 
 
  A member of the Wraith family, the Wisp is mainly employed in recce
companies. It retains the sensor suite of the Wraith tanks, but the
downgraded weapons and armour provide a significant drop in weight and a
commensurate increase in speed.
 
  The Wisp is not intended for TTT (tank to tank) engagements. It is
used to engage mechanized infantry vehicles or serve as perimeter or
flanking force. Enough spare power (6.75MW) is retained to augment the
weapon or the sensor suite as needed.

                        Wraith Medium Grav Tank
 
 
  The Wraith was designed as a heavily armed medium tank. Weapons are
installed in a remote turret, the crew - inside the hull. Standard
doctrine calls for use of the laser for long range fire and for the
fusion gun for medium range or closer. Indeed, the laser and fusion gun
cannot fire simultaneously. The 0.5MW laser is operated by the commander
from inside the hull and fires in a 70 degree arc forward.
 
  An extensive sensor and computer suite allowed the designers to
simplify the control system of the craft even beyond the existing level,
up to and including removal of the commander, but most customers prefer
to settle for a lower endurance and larger crew in order to retain the
tactical advantage accorded by a tank commander.

                         Zombie Heavy Grav Tank
 
 
  The Zombie is a member of the Wraith family of vehicles and is
equipped with maximum armour available at the tech level. An increased
armour fit required a more extensive grav unit to maintain speed on par
with the Wraith and the weapon fit is sparser in order to conserve
weight, space and power. Because of the increased weight, duration
suffers a marked decrease.
 
  As in the Wraith, the laser is installed are in a remote turret. The
extensive sensor and computer suite allows two persons to operate the
tank. For crew convenience, roomy seats are provided.

                         Cato Command Post APC
 
 
  Designed to operate as mobile command posts for any vehicle or
infantry formations, the Cato command post APCs are nevertheless an
unfinished design. It has not been decided what to do with some 28kl of
space and these were left unused for future expansions.
 
  Command and Control functions are assisted by the most powerful
computer possible, which also accounts for 84% of the vehicle cost. The
weapon fit is minimal in order to conserve power while maintaining high
speed.
 
  It has been noted in recent operations that 4 men on command staff is
not always enough and there are now plans to increase the power supply
of the craft, the locomotion section and install two additional roomy
seats. This will, at least partially, employ the empty space.

  The Corbulo APC is intended to carry an infantry squad into battle
while providing a reasonable protection from light anti vehicle fire.
Three light lasers and a plasma gun are pintle mounted - two over the
infantry compartment and one laser and the plasma gun together over the
commander\'s position. The plasma gun, when firing, pre-empts power from
the lasers. The fighting compartment is provided with firing ports and
roomy seats to allow easy carriage of fully equipped infantry. Field
reports indicate that the vehicle is underpowered, and studies are now
conducted with a vehicle equipped with a 250 ton grav unit. This vehicle
model has not yet been manufactured in great quantities.

                Paullus Heavy Armoured Recovery Vehicle
 
 
  Member of the Corbulo family, the Paullus armoured recovery and
battlefield repair vehicles are intended to support any combat craft up
to 800 tons in weight. A heavy grav unit and an array of heavy robot arms
allows the Paullus to carry other craft clamped under it. Other,
simpler, repairs may be made from inside the vehicle using the light and
medium robotic arms. A sizable quantity of spare parts and complete
field-installable modules may be carried without loss of performance.
 
  The 2MW laser is manned by the chief recovery operator.

                  Scipio Heavy Artillery Grav Vehicle
 
 
  Intended for indirect fire support, the Scipio is a member of the
Corbulo vehicle family. Sufficient ammunition is carried to maintain
fire for a reasonable time. The 5 MW lasers are in side sponsons and
are intended for AP fire only.
 
  Increased armour and the need to carry ammunition have lowered speeds
to an unacceptable level. An upgrade programme is envisaged to raise the
speed to at least 1000 kph at the price of endurance or ammunition
storage. So far these plans have not been put into action.
 
  A heavy robotic arm is provided to assist combat resupply.

the vehicle is moving faster than 300 kph since it compromises the
streamlining of the vehicle. The 5MW laser is equipped with a PD module
and is located in a small subturret mounted on top of the rocket
launcher assembly.

ranks in many TL12 ground armies. The cramped seats are a cause for
constant complaint among the users, but no plans are afoot to modify

  The F6 fighter is designed to function as a light fleet defence unit.
It can also maintain long range patrols and function as a light SDB. The
greatest failing of the fighter is the small computer, and a modified
model (Type F6-IP) is available. The data in brackets is for the F6-IP.
 
  The turret is a hybrid unit containing a single TL12 fusion gun and a
triple sandcatser. Combat mode takes twice the power of running mode.
The two control seats and the controls are located between the two small
staterooms.

Really depends on which direction your laser is communicating in and the
direction of fire for your sandcasters.

The other thought is that the laser communications are on a different
frequency than the laser weaponry.  The sandcasters would be developed for
a specific range of laser weaponry frequency to optimize energy absorption.
This optimum frequency is probably different than for a communication
array.

I would liken your question to the following...

Can a radio transmission be received with intervening chaff?

I believe the answer is yes and thus laser communications can take place
with intervening sandcaster material.

The fuel injection and power steering are evolutionary changes to technology
not revolutionary.  I would tend to agree with James regarding revolutionary
changes (horse vs car) and Mark regarding evolutionary changes (Model T vs
the Ford Taurus).

Look at how long it takes for evolutionary military hardware to develop.
I don\'t have the exact dates with me but I believe the B2 bomber took something
like 15 years to develop.  In my discussions with the research lab that I am
seeking employment with, they mention that the ideas they develop today won\'t
be seen in the military for at least ten years.

The talk of fast or slow technological development is dependent on the area
of technology that is being discussed.  Mark sites the computer technology:

But this is _very_ different from a revolutionary change in the methods of
computing and _what_ a computer may do.  Running a program faster is purely
evolutionary.

Mark and I discussed the advance of technolgy briefly last night and I would
say that if the direct neural link he proposed would be developed, then
James\' hypothesis of the time required for society to assimilate the
change is correct.

Now _here_ is one of the _real_ problems...  The politics of advancement and
the management of the funds relating to the advancement will _always_ be
there.  As the technology advances, the cost will also increase.  My
opinion is that the cost of technology will increase faster than inflation.
Thus, there will be fewer and fewer "backyard" inventors making significant
contributions to technological advancement.  I think we have already seen this
in the past fifty years.

I believe that there is a limit given a certain population base. 
One person\'s capacity is finite.  Mark provided the neural computer
implant as a way of increasing the capacity.  But I submit that this just
increases the capability of the person no the capacity to hold and
assimilate information.  An example would be Mark\'s specialty in computers
and mine in engineering.  I couldn\'t develop a "C" program that would be
useful (at least not now.)  I don\'t think Mark could solve some of the more
difficult nuclear engineering problems that I work with.  Now both of us
could do the others work given the time and training.  But the sacrifice
would be the previous job capability.

Basically, each of society\'s individuals is required to become more specialized
in order to support a higher technological base.

The other thought rattling around in the brain is the cost of the technology.
Many a TMLer may be more ready to accept a revolutionary concept in, say, 
transportation...the personal flying vehicle, about the size of a car.  They
exist now.  You can go out and buy one.  They will fit in your garage.  They
are not the dorky-looking aircars of the 50s.

But they cost over $100,000!!  I don\'t know of a TMLer (though I only 
personally know a few :-) who could afford one!

I caution against the oversimplification.  The developments are neither
wholly serial nor wholly parallel.  Technological advancement is a very
synergistic process.  I believe that if the complete failure of one or
two technological advancements is postulated, a whole raft of other
seemingly independent advancements would also fail.

And as far as the checkbook...sorry Mark, I think that it takes a whole
slew of checkbooks (DOD not withstanding :-) to make a technology work.

I don\'t believe your absorbtion capability has increased, I maintain your
efficiency has increased and thus you are able to weed out more garbage
and find more of what you need or want.

Perhaps, but there had better be something that can take out those 5 Atlantis
class battleships, or at least keep all 5 occupied for a long time, or else
at least one battleship will come and make the invasion very costly.

The whole assumption in this discussion is that for some reason, the attacker
can not/does not want to destroy the defender totally in this manner.  (Why
was such a tactic never used during any of the Frontier Wars, by the way?)
Otherwise, if the attacker finds himself faced with an unbeatable defence
at any stage, he can just give up, take off and nuke the planet from orbit.

Fine art?  Either the attacker wins, or the defender wins.  If the defender
wins, the attacker brings up the asteroid.  End of defender\'s story.

Why?  There are reasons why the infantry has to get out of the vehicles
and fight on foot.  The only way anti-gravity will put an end to fighting
on foot is if every soldier gets a grav-belt, and anyone with Striker will
know what that will do to the unit\'s maintenance costs!

The first and last of those come under the heading of "Getting stuck in
and capturing the real estate".  Assuming you actually want control of the
planet, you\'re going to have to take control of the cities, which means
city assaults.  If the cities have been bombarded, it means broken areas
combat.

Certainly it is true that at higher tech levels, you can build vehicles which
are invulnerable to any practical conventional CPR or mass-driver round.
So long as the infantry stay in their heavily armoured APC\'s, or in their
bunkers, they are safe.  (And so long as someone doesn\'t let off some nuclear
rounds.)  Artillery will still be a good way of keeping their heads down, and
weakening their morale.

Now imagine trying to do that in real life.  Can you imagine what would happen
if President Bush tried to pass a law that every house be fitted with a 
military installation?  Even something relatively harmless like the above?  If
a war was in progress, or looked like being imminent, he might get away with
an emergency programme, assuming that the required number of devices could be
provided, distributed and installed at short notice.  Otherwise there would
be the mother of all peace protests!

As for doing it in Traveller - on a non-democratic world perhaps, or maybe by
Imperial decree.

At the time I found the article highly amusing, since I didn\'t play Traveller,
and ended up using it for monster generation when we were bored with the
typical Monster Manual critters.  I can\'t comment on how "good" the article
would be for any of the Traveller game systems, since I don\'t know any of them
that well at all.

There was a short story about Traveller-types, I remember, and an article
detailing a "new" type of Traveller character.  I don\'t at the moment remember
what they were called, but they were the people who were the second group to
land on a planet.  Only the "real basics" as far as electronic exploration goes
were done by the first group; this second group did the actual intensive
ground-based research.  Thinking back on this, the type of group sounds similar
to the EEC (Exploration and Evaluation Corps) group in Anne McCaffrey\'s
_Dinosaur_Planet_.

I posted an offer on GEnie last Wednesday.  The offer was to transmit the
TML on a periodic basis to either the message board or upload bundles to
the file library or even to send stuff on a personal email basis.

I have yet to have any response _at_all_.  It seems that if GDW or DGP wanted
to see what the average Traveller player was up to, they should get on the
TML and get away from GEnie altogether.  There just isn\'t much going on
over there.

I\'ll keep the TML posted as to the status of GEnie, but for now I think the
idea is dead due to lack of interest on the other end.

  Yes, but there has been two corrections to this. First the official in the
errata that states that all vehicle damage figures are to be multiplied by ten,
and then Rob Deans TDR Vehicle Design where inop damage is computed as
unloaded weight divided by 1.2 and destroyed damage by multiplying unloaded
weight by 1.7 (with reservations for my memory).
  
  The best (IMO) result of this is that extremely heavy vehicles like tanks
and SDBs get larger damage point totals due to their heavy armor.

2004-2007  The Glowing War

The 3rd Millennium kicked off with a bang, when in its first
decade both Paris and New York fell victim to nuclear terrorism.
The blow to the western psyche was heartfelt, yet the fear the
terrorists hoped to illicit was replaced only by anger in the
wake of the destruction. A handful of nations were held
responsible for backing the terrorists, and repercussions were
both swift and certain. Through a combination of neutron and
bacteriological strikes, the so-called offending nations were
decimated and a virtual moratorium on nuclear weapons was called
for by the seven superpowers. A policy of "Cooperative
Guardianship" was ruthlessly enforced by the superpowers in order
to maintain the nuclear free world.


2011-2034  Germ Wars

The so-called peace following the Glowing War was short-lived.
For another two decades, as the ability to produce
bacteriological weapons became available to the developing
nations through numerous advances in medical science, a series of
"germ wars" plagued the earth. By the middle 30\'s, the death toll
was three billion people. The wars resulted in tremendous
biomedical advances in the more advanced nations, however the
third world nations rarely benefitted from new discoveries and
were the hardest hit. Although relatively minor outbreaks
occurred later in the century resulting in half a billion more
fatalities, the wars were said to officially end with the Treaty
of New Delhi in 2034 when India unveiled the Yama Bug, a class of
germs with theoretically no possible immunization or antidote.
Such a germ had already existed in the more developed nations for
several decades, but never before had its release been
threatened. The Prime Minister\'s statement, "If India dies, the
whole world dies," brought an abrupt halt to the self-inflicted
genocide.


2047-2080  The E-Grid

By 2047, the world\'s first fusion reactor with a positive net
power output was successfully tested in Tokyo. Although the news
came as an astonishment to the energy community, the media and
public reaction was one of disinterest. Several times before
nuclear fusion had been announced only later to be disproved.
Further, the advent of fusion had been anticipated for next to a
century, so that when it finally came about, people wondered only
that it had taken so long for science to accomplish. Without
going into the technical reasons for the delays, it can be stated
with some accuracy that it was only until the middle 40\'s that
the technological components for the nuclear fuser were at hand.
   Several nations began extending their national energy grids,
exporting inexpensive electricity to the third world by way of
power lines or energy capacitors. The boost in world productivity
was astounding, and with the energy crisis finally licked, the
major stresses inciting conflict between nations were for a time
relieved. In 2080, the national energy grids of the nine super
powers and twenty-seven other states joined together in an
"energy confederation" under the auspices of the United Nations.
The World E-Grid was born.


2068-2088  Only One Earth

In 2068, the nine superpowers joined in a treaty known as the
"Green Pact" which was to later evolve into the "Only One Earth"
restoration campaign. As the global-warming crisis continued
unabated, the world community cooperated in the implementation of
long-term solutions to the greenhousing of the earth\'s atmosphere
and the environmentally sound disintegration or holding of toxic
substances. Although initially greeted with mixed support, the
efforts of this campaign were finally joined by the remaining
nations in 2088, instituting policies of renewal over the entire
planet.


2084-2102  The Farmers\' Rebellions

In the years before the establishment of the world e-grid,
particularly during the middle stages of the Only One Earth
Campaign, the emerging energy-confederation began reclaiming
large areas of infertile land traditionally used for small-scale
subsistence farming. In so doing, the land was once again made
fertile for collective farming, however, hundreds of millions of
small-time farmers were displaced. This sudden shift in the
social order created a people entirely dispossessed, and in the
resulting chaos, a number of rebellions broke out beginning in
2084 and continued sporadically for eighteen years until the
Nolanders\' rebellion was ruthlessly crushed in 2102.


2107-2181  Corporate Science

Throughout the 21st century, the vast majority of critical
research in the sciences was conducted with government funds, yet
beginning in 2107, corporations took the lead role in developing
emerging technologies. In 2107, Femm Biolabs in the United
Kingdom engineered a new species of algae which not only helped
reverse global warming during the 22nd century\'s period of
increased thermal-energy pollution, but also technologically
paved the way for sea farming. In 2122, cryogenic suspension was
refined to the point where long-term "freezing" became both
feasible and relatively safe. In the early 40\'s, several
breakthroughs in synaptic-electric links made artificial
prothesis of both limbs and major organs more feasible, and by
the middle 50\'s, the human mind could be connected directly to
computers for the transmission or retrieval of data. The 60\'s saw
the advent of limb and organ regeneration, and by the 70\'s
startling progress had been made on total body rejuvenation,
enabling individuals to live up to 200 years. Yet it was in 2181
that the corporate science achieved its crowning glory: the
development of gravitic technology. Though it wasn\'t for another
three centuries that the science behind the phenomenon was
understood, this step opened an entirely new field of technology,
revolutionizing the global transportation industry almost
overnight.


2162-2212  High Road to Peace

Despite all the progress made toward a unified social structure,
tensions began again to sweep the seeds of discord. Disputes over
territorial rights, population control, reparation for past
injustices, patent infringements, and a whole host of other
issues divided the varying and often fluid factions as though by
an iron wedge. It is thus significant that the United Nations
took the lead in renewing cooperative ties between the world\'s
many states, inciting perhaps the most unifying gesture of the
first quarter of the millennium. In 2162, the U.N. approved its
first fifty-year plan for space exploration and colonization.
Though this action may seem today more an attempt to divert the
world\'s attention from the "real issues", the joint venture did a
great deal to quell nationalistic aggression and instill a
feeling of "world community" among divergent peoples. By 2178
both Martian and Lunar colonies had been established, and by
2210, numerous colonies existed in the Jovian and Saturn systems
and in the asteroid belt.


2197-2243  A Human Question

By the late 22nd century, the cyborgization of the human species
was well underway. Since the 50\'s, numerous machines had been
designed to do nothing other than link with the human nervous
system and provide artificial sensations. These "psychedelic
sensitizers" or "sex machines" as they were sometimes called were
by the close of the century responsible for as many as a million
fatalities worldwide. To compound the problem, the public seemed
oblivious to the mounting death toll. This "crisis" prompted the
United Nations to create a Council on Human Affairs, and for the
first time in its existence, the U.N. began dictating a universal
morality from its high pulpit.
   For the most part, this infringement on private enterprise
came as a shock to the business sector which began moving its
more questionable operations off-planet where the Council would
not have legislative jurisdiction. However, as the 23rd century
dawned it became apparent the U.N. would have more on its hands
than mere sensitizers.
   In 2231, unprecedented breakthroughs in biogenetics allowed
the precise description of an unborn child\'s future traits, and
by the end of the decade, the IHM Corporation began marketing its
"First Step" program to prospective parents. First Step was
basically a euphemism for the "service" of altering the genetic
material of an unborn fetus in an attempt to create "perfect"
human beings. As the U.N. began wrestling with the ethics thereby
involved, geneticists began work on altering the human DNA to
even greater extremes. In the majority of cases, the geneticists
delivered on their promises, producing evermore intelligent,
physically powerful, and dexterous humans, however in a certain
number of cases mistakes were made, and artificial mutants were
born. Although many of these "accidents" were promptly disposed
of, not all could be hidden so easily. Finally, in 2243, the U.N.
passed a comprehensive ban of genetic engineering on human DNA.
By this time, however, several million super-children had already
been born, and although this figure represented only a small
fraction of earth\'s thirty billion inhabitants, the threat of
superbeings pounded a serious impact on the social psyche.


2212-2262  Conquest of the Solar System

With the successful completion of the 1st fifty year plan,
industry began to get heavily involved in space interests,
particularly in asteroid mining and shuttle services. Thus, when
it came time to draw the 2nd fifty-year plan in 2212, the U.N.
conferred heavily with business leaders to form an opinion on
what was possible and what was financially feasible. At the 2212
conference, the Aster Corporation unveiled its prospects for the
construction the Von Neumann Robotic Miner. Once complete, the
spacecraft would be capable of self-replication, it\'s sole
purpose to find mineral deposits among the asteroids, mine them,
and reproduce itself. By 2220, the first VNRM set sail for the
belt, and within four decades, hundreds of the miners existed,
plying the asteroids for minerals which manned vessels could
later find neatly deposited with a homing beacon and refine in
the deep of space.
   Planetary population stress, however, proved to become an even
more serious issue than the plundering of the belt. Despite the
numerous microworlds and planetary settlements created during the
first fifty-year plan, the Terran population pressures were more
evident than ever, and by 2212 every nation on the globe
practiced some variety of population control. It was therefore
critical that some form of large-scale terraforming be undertaken
by the world community. Again, the corporations came to the
rescue with a number of exotic ideas involving the biological
terraformation of Mars, Venus, and Titan. Forming into a
cooperative combine latter to be known as the Solar Planetary
Trust Corporation, these companies demanded exorbitant property
rights on the planets to be terraformed, rights which bordered on
the creation of sovereign states beyond the United Nations\'
traditional jurisdiction. With the world community\'s grudging
acquiescence in 2217, the long process toward terraformation was
begun.


2251-2292  Children of the Apes

With the road to human genetic development legally cut short in
2243, many "human engineers" found themselves squeezed out of the
private sector. One such scientist, Dr. Ukliv Eski, returned to
the academia where he founded the Department of Hominid Studies
at the University of Kampala. There, his research team raised
several generations of chimpanzees, the genetic structure of
which he successively modified toward humanity\'s own. By 2289,
his chimps gained international notoriety on a holovideo talk
show where on several occasions they argued the "world issues"
with political leaders, the implicit parody of the situation
flustering their opponents and creating a media circus. Although
never progressing beyond a grade school intelligence, the chimps
ingratiated themselves into their hearts of the common people.
However, in a biological mishap at the University in 2292, the
chimps and their trainers, including Dr. Eski, were killed. Later
that year, the U.N. extended its 2243 prohibition on the genetic
manipulation of human DNA to cover the DNA of all hominid
species.
