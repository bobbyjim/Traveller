Neutrino are "almost" noninteractive and "almost" harmless.  But
it takes "enourmous" amounts to pose a threat.  Amounts that
you only get at a supernova.  I don\'t know if the levels are
lethal out to a distance where being underground would protect
you from the blast or not.  I have heard that the neutino wave
just proceeds the blast so if you are in a space ship outside
of a supernova you get a lethal dose just before you are blown
to smithereens.

I find Cuchulainn\'s sword is sometimes called Caladi/n and his spear Gael-bolg.
Perhaps this is Cladcholg, "Hard Dinter" the sword of Fergus? (Ellis\'s
Dictionary of Celtic Mythology).  In other sources, I find that Caladbolg
(Hard Lightning) is sometimes given as Cuchulainn\'s sword.

A disputed point.  Malory has the swords the same, other sources differ.
John Matthews has the Sword in the Stone (unnamed) destroyed in an early
battle.  Other sources have Excalibur given to Gawaine.

Brewer\'s latin is pretty unlikely, considering the more likely derivation
from Caladfwlch (Cladcholg) to Caliburn to Excalibur.  (Calafwlch is
mentioned by Geoffrey of Monmouth as Arthur\'s Sword).

Depends on who you listen to. The vulgate is full of Gawaine using
Excalibur.  I\'d go with three swords: Galatine a sword of Arthur\'s given to
Gawaine.  Excalibur, The Sword of the Lady of the Lake, which is not nearly
as magical as it\'s scabbard (which protects the wearer from losing blood in
combat).  Sequence, A sword of Arthur\'s which he uses only in mortal
combat.  Lancelot used Sequence at least once in the Vulgate.

I\'d say that Sequence or Galatine could be the Sword in the stone (if it
was not broken in battle), but that they are not all three the same...

No actually _Grandfather_ would not have any problems with it, although
most everyone else would.  All he would need to do is feed the fuel for
the ship in through it\'s teleportation portals from the pocket universe
it carries with it & it would have plenty of fuel.  If our ship does
jump 6 every week with an instant turnover each time the journey will
take less than 3.25 years one way. 

However if Jump Space is a manufactured artifact then the ship will be
useless outside the main part of the galaxy.

Adventure Hook - Grandfather was curious about the Magallenic Clouds &
sent a robotic ship there.  It jumped as far as it could & then switched
to sublight & achieved a very high fraction of c.  It explored a bit &
just came back the same way.  It is a bit confused as to where it\'s boss
went to & starts causing trouble.

Even Sillier Adventure Hook - the ship was not robotic but was crewed &
the PC\'s are part of its Droyne/Human/Vargr/Sentient Robot crew.

I always thought that the reason why the population of the Regency was
increasing but the population of the Imperium did not because the
Regency was a more dynamic society & this sociological change caused
different population dynamics.

I note that IIRC somewhere in MT it said said that the (circa 1067 &
earlier) Second Survey data was still valid until the Rebellion caused
changes.  If true (& taken literally) this indicates that no planet in
the Imperium experienced any population changes large enough to change
its population modifier between 1067 & 1117.  Maybe there was something
in the water ?

Can you picture the Scout Service standing in the highport & telling the
planets government & inhabitants "I am sorry but we can must insist that
immirgration & birth are balanced by emigration & deaths so our survey
data remains correct." :)

A supernova generates so *many* of them that the small percentage that
*do* interact will give a lethal radiation dose at 10 AU.

To help you get an idea of just how *many* are generated, when that
Supernova in the Lesser Magellanic Cloud was observed in 1989(?),
neutrino detectors on Earth recieved 4-6 neutrinos from the core
collapse. That\'s at something like 100,000 parsecs. Back calculate
using the inverse square law and the flux is something *insane*. 

Let\'s see. A parsec is about 2e5 AU. So that makes our distanace about
2e10 AU. divide by 10 AU. Gives 2e9. square that to get 2e18. times 5
(median) gives 1e19 neutrinos.

Now consider that the total detector cross section was on the order of
100 square meters. So that gives a flux of 1e17 *interacting* neutrinos
per square meter. The number of non-interacting ones doesn\'t bear
thinking about.

Nope. Neutrino. The number of neutrinos emitted by the core collapse is
something incredible. See my other reply for the calculation, but
basicly, based on the fact that we *detected* (ie interacted with)
something like 4-6 neutrinos from a supernova a *long* ways off in
1989, I get 1e17 "detected" neutrinos per square meter at 10 AU from
the supernova. The number of ones that *don\'t* get detected is
incredibly larger. 

But those 1e17 will ruin your day.

When someone did the (much more detailed) calculation back in 89, you
could hear jaws dropping all over the place as the concept of a
neutrino flux so high that it\'d be lethal penetrated. 

BTW, this means that if there\'s ever a supernova in or near the
Imperium, folks will have about an hour\'s warning before the light gets
there. The neutrino flux ought to *destroy* neutrino detectors for a
hundred or so parsecs. :-)

The reason for the hour lag between the neutrinos and the light is that
the neutrinos escape thru the star almost as if it wasn\'t there. Then
the core collapses as they carried off the energy that was supporting
it. The collapse is followed by an expansion (rebound) just in time for
the outer layers of the star to meet it as they fall in. The temp and
pressures are such that *everything* fuses. And then the light has to
work its way out past all the junk that\'s still trying to fall in. 

And spread out behind the EM wavefront is the sleet of particles that
used to be the outermost layers of the star, boost to a fair chunk of c.

Introduction

Pocket Empires is an excellent product, but it is essentially designed on
the scale of interstellar governments. In my opinion, it provides an
excellent framework for a high-level game, or an excellent generator of
scenarios and ideas for a low-level campaign.

This article is aimed at the space in between - essentially, at creating a
set of rules to put flesh out the activities involved in a low-effort
colonisation, so that the colonisation effort and running the colony
afterwards can be the focus of a roleplaying campaign.

I have tried to be generic throughout, specifying the skill used and the
difficulty of the task. This allows individual GMs to tweak things
according to their particular flavour of Traveller.

As well as the formal tasks assigned in the rules, just about everything
can and should be made a roleplaying opportunity. Players should be
encouraged to turn a skill roll into a gaming session, and if they or the
GM see a way that an action or a set of skills could assist in a particular
problem, then wing it. Turn raw numbers into something more meaningful -
describe the slow shift from frontier to settled as a world climbs from
infrastructure two to all the way to five, and how dirt tracks are turning
into highways, and describe how the original dozen air-rafts that ran an
airlift of supplies from the southern continent and kept the infant
settlement of Stornoway from starving during the Famine of \'47 have been
installed as statues in parks around the planet.


Survey

The first stage is the identification of a colony world, and of a site for
colonisation within that world. This would be an Average Survey task,
assuming two out of adequate time, supporting skills and equipment. Every
criteria missing increases the task difficulty by one level. The supporting
skills would depend on specific circumstances - a world with an active
biosphere could make Survival or Biology useful, whilst finding a good site
for a mining colony could make Prospecting skill required. The time scale
is a month to survey the system, plus a month per world intensively
surveyed. Success results in accurate UPPs for each world or moon in the
system, and preselection of the colony site.

A special success on this survey roll indicates that the survey party have
found an exploitable export resource for a colony established in that
system. This could be an ore body, a native animal who\'s hide or meat
resembles an existing delicacy, an atmospheric concentration of some
valuable trace element, an archeological site that could be mined or
something else. In macro terms, all that matters is there is something on
the world in question that could be profitably exported back to
civilisation for difficult currency.

Of course, this assumes the world concerned does not have sentients on it
already, and the surveyors are not opposed in their activities - finding a
secret enemy naval base supporting privateers would not be a Good or a
Healthy thing for the survey team, for example[1].

If the prospective colonists already have, for example, a IISS or Megacorp
survey report, then this stage can be skipped. Personally, I would
recommend a quick trip to the site, to make sure that the survey crew didnt
spend their time experimenting with what halluciogens an IISS medikit can
be induced to produce, rather than exhaustively documenting the trace
elements in the biosphere of the world concerned.

Equipment

The second stage is the orginisation of the colony expidition. This will
need four things - money, money, money and people. The base cost of a
colonisation effort aimed at establishing a colony for 1000 people is 4
megacredits, times one point [PE atmosphere infrastructure modifier] times
transport costs of one point [distance in parsecs from source world, times
two if TL9 or 10 transport is used], times the TL of the source world.
Costs for recruiting the colonists is extra.

Needless to say, orginising all this is a Difficult Admin task. Costs can
be shaved by 10% per level of difficulty increase. Other relevant skill
tests could include Broker, Liaison and Bribery, and perhaps Streetwise,
Engineering, Mechanic, Electronic and Gravitics if pre-owned colony
equipment is purchased to cut costs.

This gets what is in effect a colony starter kit, comprising a 20 MW power
plant (usually fission), a multi-purpose ore refinery, a food production
facility, a hydrogen/oxygen cracker, a plastics manufacturing plant,
prefabricated shelters, a sick bay, a mechanical shop, an electronics shop
and several bulldozers. If the world has a less than benevolent atmosphere,
then the equipment includes air compressors, vacc suits, protective domes
and so on as appropriate.

No military equipment comes out of this standard budget. If the colony
wishes to invest in such, they will have to buy it seperatley (a dozen
self-guiding anti-starship missiles, a cheap passive sensor rig, a LIDAR
for target tracking and a battery-powered particle accelerator could be a
good investment. A nuclear damper also has it\'s uses, especially if your
nuclear reactor is going supercritical. Small arms are always handy, and
there are few military problems artillery cannot help solve. Kindly contact
your local Famile Spofulam representitive for a fuller list).

Other equipment the colony may consider includes a starship-fuel grade
hydrogen refinery and associated tankage, an orbital shuttle or three, a
spare power plant and anything else the management team wants and can
afford. Remember to apply shipping and environmental hardening costs where
appropriate.
 
While shopping, remember that this will be a colony of two TLs below the
world the equipment was bought on, at least at first. Equipment at higher
TLs than this will not be able to be repaired and may not be able to be
maintained locally. Consideration should be given to \'mothballing\' hi-tech
equipment until a crisis that it can solve is at hand, rather than having
it continually operating, and thus building up demand for maintainence.

The basic equipment masses 500 displacement tons, times one point [PE
atmosphere infrastructure modifier] and masses 3500 tons . It is assumed
that the colony charters starships as appropriate to ship it (a transport
budget in the tens of megacredits will lease a big starship for the
neccessary month or three), then that cost can be trimmed.

If the admin roll is failed, then the equipment side of the colonisation
effort will be plagued by disorginisation. The power plant puts out power
at the wrong voltage for the hydrogen cracker, the instruction manuals for
assembing the shelters are in Old High Vilani and the cargo ship leaves
four weeks after the passenger hauler picks up everybody. Cost blowouts may
also occour.

The failure of other skills could have effects ranging from annoying (the
four hundred vacc suits were bought, but the deal didnt include shipping
from Depot) to potentially lethal (the fission plant was bought off a
merchant who forgot to mention that it was on the wrong end of an IN
bombardment a decade ago, and has been in mothballs ever since).

Example : A plan is hatched to colonise Iimidi, a world with a Dense,
Tainted atmosphere. The equipment is bought on Khuir, a TL9 world three
parsecs away. The cost is MCr4 * 1.3 (Atmosphere Infrastructure Factor) *
1.6 (3 parsecs at TL9) * 9 (Khuir\'s TL), or MCr 71.72.

People

Next, what are euphemistically called the human factors. Whilst most
governments do not particularily mind people buying equipment for export on
their worlds, some react badly, even violently, to people who try and bribe
their technical or other specialists off-world. Others are glad to get rid
of religious or political dissidents, useless mouths or career criminals.

Getting official approval for recruitment is an Easy task for worlds with
law level 3 or less, Average for worlds with law level 4-6, Difficult with
law level 7-8, formidable with law levels 9-11 and Impossible for law level
12 and up. The basic skill is Diplomacy, with Liason, Legal and Admin as
secondary skills. Use of Bribery is possible, allowing a number of rerolls
per level of Bribery skill available for a bribe in megacredits of twice
the local law level (we are probably talking Cabinet level corruption at
least here ...). Needless to say, spectacular failure on any of these rolls
may be bad for the health of the management team.

The Third Imperium as a whole has a law level of one, maybe two, so
Imperial permission does not need to be granted to recruit colonists from
within the extrality fences of starports. However, the majority of Imperial
Citizens do not live in starports, so direct liaison with world governments
will probably be neccessary at some point.

Key skills for finding willing people include Recruiting [2], Admin, Liason
and possibly Acting or Broker, plus of course money. GMs may want players
to draft up or even act out advertising spots or other media campaigns for
recruiting colonists. Needless to say, the greater the time pressure the
colony program is under, the more chances there are for mistakes.

The base difficulty of finding 1000 eager colonists is an easy Recruiting
or a medium task for any of the Streetwise, Admin or Liason cluster,
involving spending 1 megacredit. If the official permission of the local
government does not exist, then these become two levels more difficult,
costs triple and Streetwise becomes a secondary skill. This assumes that
the colony orginisers merely want willing warm bodies - if they want
something more than the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to
breathe free, then things get more difficult, not to mention more
expensive. A colony will have a Culture score equal to the weighted average
of the worlds the colonists are recruited from. If the management team
wants to weight recruitment either to the more flexibly minded of a
hardworking if ossified society, or the less flakey and more hardworking of
a more freewheeling planet, then the a difficulty increase of the projected
cultural difference exists.

Example : The Iimidi Colonisation Company is recruiting for colonists on
Khuir, in the Empire of the Seven Stars. Khuir has a law level of B and a
Culture of 5, so getting government permission is a Formidible task. If
this permission is granted, then recruiting 1000 prospective colonists is
an Easy recruiting task costing 1 megacredit if the ICC is happy with
gaining a Culture of 5 when Iimidi is colonised, increasing by one
difficulty level per point the IIC want Iimidi\'s culture to differ from
this value. If Khuir\'s government diapproves of the colony effort
recruiting, then it is a Hard recruiting task, costing three megacredits -
recruiting for a Culture score of 6 will thus become a Formidible task.

Finding people with a specific skill is an Easy Recruiting task, or Average
if using Admin, Liaison or Streetwise. There is a -1 DM per law level of
the target world above 5 in any case, plus the 2 level shift in task
difficulty if the local government has not given permission. The recruiter
requires one or more offsiders with the skill(s) in question to assist in
testing applicants. Every additional skill is an increase of one level in
difficulty. Time needed is one week per attempt. Cost is a base KCr 20 per
attempt, plus KCr 10 per recruitee actually hired (again, triple costs if
host government permission is lacking). Every point by which the recruiting
roll is made adds one potential recruit. The testing process takes place in
this week, and is an easy task for the offsider for each skill tested for.
If the testing roll is failed, the tester is unsure as to whether the
applicant is actually competant - a spectacular failure results in a false
positive result. The person making the attempt and their offsider(s) are
fully occupied for one week advertising, answering enquiries and testing
potential applicants. This time increases to one month is the skill or
skills set being searched for is sufficiently rare or obscure.

Example : The Kallyr\'s Belt Development Corporation is looking for
Engineers with familiarity on TL8 fission plants, just in case the PC with
that skill is busy when a crisis hits. Their recruiting specialist has
Admin-3, and they have an offsider (actually the key PC) with
Engineering-3. They make the recruiting roll by 4. They have found 4
potentially interested appropriately qualified engineers, who are prepared
to sign up for KCr 10 apiece. The tester makes 3 of the 4 rolls, so they
are certain 3 of the applicants are competant on the equipment. These 3 are
hired, so the total process costs KCr 50.

Wise colony orginisers orginise appropriate training for potential
colonists before shipping them out - hiring trainers and orginising skills
training for all prospective colonists may aid survival rates in the
critical early months, especially if Survival, Vacc Suit or similar is
needed to survive outside the protective domes of the fledgeling colony. A
cost of MCr 2 per 1000 colonists per months training is involved, with a
base difficulty against Admin or Instruction of Difficult, falling by 1
difficulty level per month of additional training. If official approval
does not exist for the colony attempt, these costs are tripled, and in
addition a Difficult Admin or Streetwise roll must be made each month
(Formidible for law level 5-8, and Impossible for law level 9 or up).
Success at such a training excersise raises the general skill level of a
colony from \'unskilled\' to \'normal\' - a special success will result in the
colony having an Infrastructure score of 3.1 rather than 3. 


Constitutional Issues

The next issue is orginising the legal and government structure of the new
colony. Some element of foreknowledge, or even participation, by the new
colonists in this may help prevent problems down the track. Options include
a corporate structure, with shareholdings split between the new residents
and the parent holding company, a system of sweat equity - the colonists
will own their land after putting down a permanent residence and
cultivating 2 hectares for 5 years or a system of bonded indenture. 

The proposed legal system for the colony should also be known ahead of time
- - one advantage of stable societies such as the Vilani is all this sort of
detail is already negotiated within the overall social contract.

If some known model is not being used, then drafting a workable set of laws
is a Difficult Legal task, taking as many months as the target law level.
Failure results in a law level (2d6-7) levels different from that planned
for. Spectacular failure results in a Law Level determined at random.

Consideration should also be given to the social mores, official or
otherwise, of the new society. This may be a critical issue if colonists
were recruited from several worlds - different socieities may have
different moral codes dealing with issues such as cohabitation issues,
whether personal relationships are legally sanctioned, are local moral
codes enforcable on strangers etc.  The trip to the site may be a bad time
to discover that massive cultural incompatibilities exist between the
colonists at large, and their life-support system technicians.

Establishment

Assuming the trip to the colony world is without incident, then the colony
itself can be established.

Unloading and setting up is a Average Admin task, Hard if the colony site
does not have a atmosphere breathable with filter masks (assuming of course
the survey report was accurate and nothing untoward has happened in the
meantime. This is an especially bad time to find the survey crew was sadly
deficient in some field, such as tectonic plate engineering, native life
migration pattern analysis or solar flare frequency prediction).

This is just the "starter kit" equipment. Military equipment has to be
sited seperately, using Combat Engineering, weapon-specific skills and, as
always, Admin skill.

At this point, the world is now settled, and gets a type E starport, a TL
of 2 below where the colony equipment was bought and a UWP and economic
extention as appropriate. The world has a Resources score calculated during
the Survey phase, and an Infrastructure score of three. Culture is
determined by the weighted average of the Culture scores of the worlds the
colonists came from, as modified by special recruiting efforts.

Example : A colony of 2000 colonists is formed on Iimidii with equipment
bought on Khuir, with 1000 coming from Khuir with culture of 5 and 1000
from Uurigger with culture of 7. The colony is therefore culture 6. The IIC
forms it as a Corporate State, with law level of four. It\'s full UWP is
therefore E493314-7 203, with an EE of 7226.

Running the place

The base annual per capita income of a colony is equal to Cr 5 *
Infrastructure * Resources * Tech Level * Finished Goods Trade. This
represents domestic production, including the non-cash proportion of the
economy - startup colonies tend to have a large non-traded sector of
subsistence farming and co-operative work, but for the purpose of the
world\'s account\'s it\'s all measured in Imperial credits.

If the colony is sited on or near an exploitable export resource, then the
colony has an additional per annum income of KCr 1d6 per citizen each year
[3].

Administering a colony is per Pocket Empires - a Formidible Admin roll each
year. Failure involves an increase in 10% of basic civilian expenses.
Spectacular failure involves a loss of 1d6% of colonists in some sort of
disaster, if the colonists were not adequately trained before departure.
Spectacular success automatically removes this status if the colonists had
not been adequatly trained before departure.

Basic Civilian Expenses are {[5*Culture]+Infrastructure(1+Infrastructure
Atmosphere Modifier)+Law Level]/100}*Administration Factor*Government Type
Factor. This involves minimum civilian living standards, law enforcement
and maintainence of existing infrastructure.

Example : Iimidi has a GWP of (Cr 5*2*7*8*1) or Cr 560 per capita, or a
total of MCr 1.12 per annum. It\'s minimum civilian expenses are
{[5*6]+3(1.3)+2}/100*1*1.1, or approximatly 40% of this - KCr 405.

Taxes

Planetary income in excess of minimum civilian expenses is split between
the citizenry and the government according the the ruling tax rate.
Remember that the tax rate can be increased, at a cost of popularity. [5]

Keep track of both a world\'s income and it\'s stock of unspent funds or
accumulated deficit.

Example : Iimidi has a government type of one, so it\'s base rate of tax is
20%. The government\'s share of the rest is thus KCr 122. Incidentally, this
puts the after-tax income of the average Iimidian at Cr 445 per year -
about two poor meals a day, plus a cheap set of clothes once a year.

Planetary Defenses

The colony management team gets to set the defense budget, design command
structures and purchase equipment. Most colonies will not be able to afford
a formal military, and will make do with militia and perhaps a central
armoury.

Professional soldiers cost one point five times the planet\'s after tax per
capita income each. Locally produced equipment can be bought normally and
costs 10% of it\'s purchase price each year in maintainence, while imported
equipment costs 20% of it\'s purchase price each year in imported spare parts.

Example : Iimidi has a per capita income of Cr 560, so any professional
soldiers will be paid Cr 840 per year each, plus equipment. Iimidi makes do
without a formal military, as 100 soldiers would consume almost the entire
government budget without equipment.

Developing Infrastructure

Small colonies may improve infrastructure in tenths of a point at a time.

Improving Infrastructure by one tenth of a point is a Difficult task
against a world\'s culture score [4], taking a minimum of (Atmosphere
Infrastructure Modifier+1) / 5 years and costing (Atmosphere Infrastructure
Modifier+1) * (Infrastructure + 1) * Cr 200 per capita. This cost can be
split over a number of years, with the roll being made when the entire sum
is paid.

Example : Improving Iimidi\'s infrastructure from 2 to 2.1 will take a
minimum of one year and cost 
KCr 1.4 per head, or a total of MCr 2.8. Considering that the Iimadian
government\'s total budget is KCr 122, this will clearly have to be done
over many years.

Improving Technology

It is assumed that small colonies may use the Technological Uplift rules,
so improving technology is cheaper and easier. The task is a Difficult task
against a world\'s Culture score, with cost and time as per Pocket Empires,
However, cost is in KCr per person rather than RU per world. Note the
minimum required starport and infrastructure scores for technological advance.

Example : Improving Iimidi\'s technology level from 7 to 8 would cost KCr 4
per head, and take a minimum of 2 years. Note that a TL of 8 would allow
exploitation of the Iimidi system\'s 3 gas giants, thus raising Resources
from 7 to 10, with a commensurate 40% rise in per capita income, so it is
probably a priority for the fledgeling colony.

Improving Starports

Improving a starport is a Formidible task against a world\'s Culture score.
Times are as PE, with costs divided by ten and in KCr per head.

Example : Improving Iimidi\'s starport from E to D would cost Cr 120 per
head, and take at least 2 years. Given the low economic impact of a Type D
port vis a vis a type E, it probably isnt a priority until the planet is
developed enough to go to a type C port in fairly short succession.

Population Growth and Immigration ; the good news

Population change occours annually as per the rules in Pocket Empires. All
population growth above 3%, and half of all growth below 3%, represents
immigration, and immigrants bring KCr 1d6 apiece with them to the colony.
Whilst technically privately owned, this adds to the total wealth of the
colony and is thus best represented by a cash inflow direct into the
government\'s coffers, where it will doubtless be spent on socially
beneficial purposes.

If a colony chooses to assist migration by offering subsidies to the travel
costs of prospective migrants, then roll two dice rather than one when
calculating the Population Change Factor, but immigrants do not bring
wealth into the colony.

Immigrants are a good source of plot pushes and pulls - migrants may
bringpolitical struggles with them, or be seeking to escape them. Migrants
may be highly skilled retirees from one of the Imperial services, or
desperatly poor reufgees seeking a better life. Social tensions may exist
between existing colonists and tenderfeet, especially if wealth disparities
exist between them.

Example : Iimidi rolls a 4 on it\'s PCF roll in it\'s first year. It\'s PCF is
therefore (4+resources 7 + infrastructure 3 + technology 7)/ (labour 2 +1)
or (21/3) or 7. This would normally be a 6% population increase, but the
class E port drops this to 3%. Half these persons are native born, and half
(thirty) are immigrants, bringing with them an injection of cash and goods
of KCr 1d6*30 (not insignifigant when the government\'s annual budget is KCr
167).

Population Growth and Immigration ; the bad news

Infrastructure and starports are designed for a particular level of
population. Too many people, and air recycling equipment gets stressed,
roads get potholed, farmland or equivalent starts to become overworked and
the starport starts becoming overutilised to the point of danger.

When a colony goes up a full UWP population code, it\'s starport falls by
one class and it\'s infrastructure decreases by one full point.

Drift in culture and self-determination

Do this every 10 years, with a DM costing KCr 1 per head, rather than the
flat amount per planet.

Random Events

Do these as per Pocket Empires. They are an excellent opportunity for
roleplaying.

Popularity 

Roll popularity each year. If the management team is on the planet,
remember to apply the \'trusted lieutenant\' rule.

Offworld Investment

Many colonies will be faced with a crisis of underdevelopment, being unable
to spare the resources to invest in improving the world\'s infrastructure
and technology in any reasonable sort of time.

A possible solution is importing resources from offworld.

Other worlds can assist with this for various reasons - the Imperial Navy
or IISS may want to put a base on the world at some future point in time,
and the presence of a thriving colony will help with the operation of this
installation, or a transport company may want a better starport on a world
in order to allow easier refueling in a certain system.

Worlds or corporations may also recognise the future benefit of developing
their trading partners, and be willing to invest money in a world with an
eye to establishing a long-term trading partner - an investment by
Makhadurin of mere megacredits now may result in a long-term trading
partnership that may profit the company greatly over the centuries.

Alternativly, investors may just regard a world\'s bonds as a good
investment, secured as they are on the future and exploitable resources of
an entire planet.

Issuing Bonds

The basic Traveller rate of interest is 3%, and raising money at this rate
is a Staggering task against Broker skill. Every 1% increase in possible
rate of return reduces the task difficulty by one percent. If the success
roll is missed by one point, half the projected money is raised at the
target rate of interest. If the success roll is missed by two points, one
tenth of the projected money is raised.

Raising funds costs a basic two percent of the size of the issue in
brokerage, advertising and similar costs (as always, appropriate
roleplaying and character skills may affect the costs and success chances
of a bond issue - perhaps a player could design an advertisment aimed at
gaining the participation of small individual investors). These costs have
to be paid regardless of the success of the issue.

Declaring bankruptcy or unilaterally reducing the repayment levels on a
bond is possible, and could result in effects ranging from a negative
response to future attempts to raise money, to attempts to sieze offworld
assets, to sponsorship of a coup attempt by the financiers affected.

Buying bonds back is certainly possible. This costs an amount equal to the
original amount raised, plus five percent. [5]

Example : The Iimidian government decides to issue a bond for 10
megacredits, repayable at 4%. The plan is for 8 megacredits of this to be
used to increase Iimidi\'s tech level from 7 to 8, with the other 2
megacredits to repay the annual interest for the first 5 years. After this,
the population and local economy should have grown sufficiently to allow
repayment of the KCr 500 per year in interest costs. The bond issue would
be a Formidiable task at that interest rate, involving a cost of KCr 200.

Direct Investment

Direct foriegn investment is also a possibility. Each year a world comes to
the attention of the corporate community at large by improving it\'s
infrastructure, technology or starport, there is a 1 in 6 chance of one of
these corporations sending a corporate team to the world to scout out
investment opportunities.

Such an event is important for a colony, and efforts will presumably be
made to show the planet off to it\'s best, and to assist the corporate team
in any way possible.

The corporate team will go home without a decision, unless the local
government succeeds in a Staggering roll against Trader or Diplomacy skill,
with Liason, Carousing, Admin and perhaps Bribery as secondary skills.

If successful, then investment will amount to an offworld corporation
providing the funds for an immediate attempt to increase Infrastructure by
one tenth of a factor, plus one tenth of a factor for every two points the
task roll succeeded by. This is paid for immediatly, and subject to the
normal task roll against a world\'s Culture score. This investment could be
in the form of a single large plant, or of purchases of stock in a large
number of local corporations, or of a mix of direct and indirect investment.

On a special success, a corporation is interested in improving the starport
by one grade, provided it can run it as a private installation. The effect
of this will be half of a world\'s Finished Goods Trade bonus will go to the
world, and the other half go to the investing corporation as fees and
import and export duties. Needless to say, the host government is not
obliged to accept this offer.

Substantial corporate investment in a world will have a long term impact on
it, and the greater the investment the greater the effect on a world\'s
economy and society. If a single offworld corporation has a large amount of
equity in a world\'s industries, then it may be in a position to
substantially influence a world\'s government, economy and society by a
variety of direct and indirect pressures. 

Example : After many years of hard work, Iimidi succeeds in raising it\'s
Infrastructure score from 2 to 3. A Foriegn Investment roll succeeds, and a
corporate team from Allfinanz arrives. The world\'s leadership team pulls
out all the stops, and succeeds in their Formidiable roll by 2 points.
Allfinanz therefore puts up the money for an attempt to increase Imiidi\'s
infrastructure form 3 to 3.2. This will take 2 years to resolve, and if it
succeeds Iimiidi will have Infrastructure 3.2 and Allfinanz will have
influence over Iimidi commensurate with it\'s 6% share of Iimdii\'s stock of
capital.

These are not "megacorporations". Oberlindes Lines and Al Morai are both
local to the Spinward Marches. Imperillines is the cover for the private

propagating via X-Boat. Sort of (vaguely) like Air America, the CIA airline.

I\'ve played around a bit with it and what I want would look
like an exponential curve that becomes logarithmic at a certain point. 
This maintains a monotonicly increasing curve that grows slowly.
Now, given this curve, write a function that plots this way on 
semi-logarithmic paper, where the y-axis is logarithmic and the x-axis
is linear.

I looked at polynomial and trigonometric functions, but they have
(as noted) some properties that I find undesirable (periodicity and/or
non-monotonic growth. I am looking for a function that (at least
conceptually) can be expressed as y=f(x) and x=f(y). x and y are both
positive.

The x-axis is the summed indices that rate the amount of trade that
Rob generates. The y-axis is the passenger volume index. 

On the other hand, Rob\'s latest values (exponent 0.36) seem defensable
on further analysis (at least for the Rhylanor-Porozlo pair). 

Rob, could you post the latest iteration of your algorithm?

thanks,
Michael

Gee... does the ship^H^H^H^Hplanet have vestiges of a hexagonal grid on

one of grandfathers Children wanted to conduct a study of what would
happen if he created a specific enviornment (underground setting) and
introduced a modified human stock (Dwarves) and some other simular
human hybreds into this set up environment.

We can say that the planet had lots of carved out areas to support
the varrious eco-systems, with many planned plants and animals put
into place first. Then introducing the different cultures and setting
up their societies.

Now this would be that there would be a superstructure of Ancient
machines and facilities throughout the planet to support the
scientific experiment. I\'d also say that nost likely there would
be one cloning lab that can and does create humans. The purpose
of the lab could be to create the different life forms and genetically
alter them to meet the need.

Now what I\'d propose is that the maintance crew are cloned standard
humans who live in a domes just under the surface like the Logan\'s Run
city. Theses humans are programmed with skills and develope 
personalities as they live. Lets say at age (30) they are "Renewed"<g>
and that well something happens.

Ok long long ago the controlling Grandson of Grandfather stopped
coming and the ship floated through space on it\'s pre-set path. The
computer ( a now self-aware kind entity)  followed it\'s pre-set plan
and just awaited the Grandson\'s return. He never came and the ship
drifted on.

Well as all good things come to a end, the planet course would
take it into a solar system where the computer knew that it\'s engines
couldn\'t allow it to escape. Being  self-aware it then  decided to
put the planet into a safe orbit, and began opperations to maneuver
the planet into a correctly safe approach and etc.

As was part of the grandson\'s original game plan for this world,
the planet had large atmosphere processing plants in place to help
convert and rebuild the planet a suitable atmosphere.

The computer started to grow many more clone human crew and program
them with needed skills to do the many tasks. So then the planet
was able to settle into orbit about a large gas giant. In doing so
the earthquakes and etc caused alot of damage, they atmosphere
processing plants began to start working. They were set on automatic
settings and etc.

Now part of the damage was that the powersource for the world ship
was damaged and had to be taken off line for good. The computer had
a set amount of battery back-up and set in motion (30 years- one
generation of the clone crew) to work out many of the serface world
issues. 

Also the computer was damaged as well and was loosing many of it\'s
command ability. Actually it has stopped being Self-aware somehow
and many of the things that use to be controlled by the computer
were now not. Now the human crew continued their jobs but as all 
humans will they started to exert themselves and the beginnings of 
a new human culture did form.

Now I would set this campaign some 4-5 generations after the planet
went into orbit and the humans have broken out and discovered the 
serface world and have started to reclaim it. They now control the 
computer and it\'s great knowledge in some areas and lack of information 
in others. They begin to establish more conventional
power systems and factories to produce materials and etc.They also
redesover first basic flight and then through the computer and 
experimentation more and more complex aircraft. Soon they descover
space flight and and develope an effective Pre-Jump space ship systems
and etc. Remember this type of data wouldn\'t have been included in the 
computers data base. 

Now while this is all happening the other cultures that have noticed
some changes and etc, have started to explore some things that were 
taboo in the past. It seems the old God (the computer) has abandoned
them and etc. These different low tech cultures start fighting with each 
other, and somehow they too find their ways to the serfice. As
with all first contacts, fear is always there and fighting breaks out.

So then begins the fight for control of different sectors of the 
surface world by the different races. The Dwarves perfer the Mountains, 
the Orcs perfer the deep forests, and the humans perfer
the great flat open spaces.

The dwarves are very good at coming up with a low tech approach to
solving a problem plus they are real crafty and very smart. The orcs
are fast breaders and are very close to nature and etc. The Humans
have like Tech level 9-10-11 depending on what it is.

Now while all this is going on on this new planet "X", I would also
have another planet native to this system just gain Tech level#9.
They have just started to explore there own solar system and consider
the New planet "X" to just be another Moon of the gas giant. They
have sent some unmanned probes to do fly buy and takes some pictures.
They have noted that there is a Eco-system on the planet, and that
there is most likely plant life and basic animal life possible.

I would also place a third world in system that was rich in minerals
with a basic atmosphere and some plant life and a few life forms.
This world would be between the main home world of this native
life form and the Gas giant who has planet "X" as one of it\'s moons.

I would set the campaign as the players are part of the new scout 
service, formed from the military force. They would have both Military
basic skills and Scout skills. 

The sky would be the limit as the cultures clashed and etc...<g>!

are to swim with.

Leave out Military vessels in active service. Leave out massive megacorp
vessels on very regular runs - some TU\'s have 10000 (or 100000)ton
trade ships that only go from point A to point B and back again, I think
we know where they are.

Leave in Free Traders and other private or small corporate trading
vessels that travel with no planned route, or only plan their route one
or two systems past the next starport. Leave in whatever private
pleasure vessels (Yachts, chartered Safari Ships, etc) may exist.
Leave in starmerc vessels, university or corporate research vessels,
Seeker mining ships, and most of the Couriers in known space.

Yes, I know the Scout Service runs most of the Couriers, but lots of
corporations, worlds and wealthy individuals will have a reason to 
maintain their own link with a world two or three parsecs away, or 
a trusted aide to send on roving inspection tours of facilities all over
a subsector or more. 

You can even leave in all the IISS, Imperial Navy and other government
ships that may be travelling the spacelanes incognito, as well as all
those "detached duty" Scout/Couriers. 

Total up all these ships for an area, say the Spinward Marches. How
many sub-1000 ton ships are running around this sector? This should
be important for the flavor of a TU, but I\'m not sure if there is any good
way to tell. And if I want to go unnoticed in my nice 400-ton "blockade
runner", it\'s nice to know if I have 100 other 300-600 ton ships to hide
amongst or 10,000.

There are a lot of class E starports around. Some I\'ve seen described 
have nothing for traffic control but a ground based beacon that a crew can
(if they want to) walk up to and key in their ship name and a date - maybe
(due to the low-tech of the computer at the beacon) any old name and
date they want to. Others might have just a beacon satellite that records 
transponder codes, and (if you send it the right code signal) will dump the 
last 1000 or so it recorded to you. If it erases afterwards, a Pirate would
love to get his hands on the transmit & dump code. <g>

Not to mention the temptation to try out your new Darrian Superhack-9000
computer intrusion program on that TL-9 beacon satellite, to try and
get it to change it\'s code records - or just pretend it had a glitch and
lose all of them.

(Adventure seed: A hijacking attempt on a Donosev-class 400tn Survey
Cruiser. It seems the ship has been on beacon-maintenance duty on
a string of frontier worlds, and has a lot of traffic data in it\'s memory
banks that might not exist anywhere else - and someone wants that
data to go away...)

If there are tens of thousands of little ships wandering around, and enough
class E starports that don\'t have any ability to forward traffic records
to a central clearing house, it can be easy for a trail to get fuzzy very
quickly. The Impies might not tolerate such a situation around Core,
but might have more important things on their minds in a frontier sector.
If you want to track a specific ship, you might have to send your agents
to a lot of planets and have them manually check records, do the legwork
of talking to witnesses, etc - all months (or years) after the event of
interest took place. Then they have to get all this information to a central
location for analysis. Then they have to send agents out to act on the
analysis - weeks or months each way.

Eventually your dragnet might make it possible to catch the _Sporting 
Jenny_ (constructed at Gram in 998, many owners, current owner 
suspected of piracy & hijacking, home port Ruie) next time she shows
her face. By that time, she may very well be _Barbara Allen_ (with pretty 
good papers to show that she is a salvage-yard build, of many worn but 
functional parts, first flight 1107 at Trin).

As usual, YTUMV.

Good dodge, but I don\'t think it works either. Others have claimed M1100
has a Vargr system at TL 16 with a total population of two (2) individuals.
IIRC M0 has a few lo-pop TL 14 systems; one in Core sector with a class A
starport! Where are these systems importing their high-tech commodities
from?

I don\'t see much of a difference between your definition and mine except
the bit about technology technology restricted to an elite but available
to travelling visitors. It seems to me that if items are of limited
supply (which would IMO usually be the case with restricted items) then
they would not generally be available; and if they were in general use
then they would most likely be available.

Pretty much the way I see it.

>Hopefully, he\'ll be able to buy them, but there\'s no assurance of that.  

IMTU the TL indicates the technology that is available at normal prices.
Higher tech items may or may not be available for purchase (the elite will
have imported some, but possibly only for their own use), but if it is
available, it will be more expensive.

All this will show _a_ ship visted.  If you just don\'t carry passengers
(and even if you do, but it is a lot harder) then you just have records
that can be faked and witnesses of people who they didn\'t pay much attention
to at the time (try asking someone at an airport counter to remember
one person they served weeks ago out of all the people the served
during that period without a photograph).  And even if you have
a big brother kind of situation with cameras on everyone (and not
everyone sees the Traveller universe this way, as we have established)
then you just have a picture of one person and bunch of fake ship
records, how do you track him down in a huge Empire where
communications may not even move as fast as he does?

And then you get into the question of how they tie this into
a piratacy that occured, esp. since most pirates will just
skip trading on the world they did the piracy on.

>it will have to use
>its real transponder code.

Well, as you know, some don\'t agree with you on this.  As you remember,
many of us don\'t see communications in the Traveller universe as being
fast enough to allow unique codes for each ship to be transmited
to every location before the ship can get there.  Nor would this
be an easy task as it is in the modern world where you just send
it out by telephone.  Without that you rely on some sort of
untamperable transponder which is also something people disagre
wtih.

>Well, I assume that faking engine and hull numbers is a whole lot more
>difficult than using fake transponder codes.

Why?  If they are ingraved they are easier to change and if they
are electronic they aren\'t any different.

Well, unless you assume that a pirate attacks a ship and then decides
to try and trade at that world (the height of stupidity), then you
have to try and cover all the worlds he might have visited (in
2 or 3 jumps in case he doesn\'t try trading at the very next world).
You are going to get a lot of ships like the general type.  You are
going to then comb those records ones that have been faked or where
the pirate has failed to cover a crucial bit of info.  I do, in fact,
think that happens and some pirates get caught that way.  I don\'t
think it comes close to catching them all.

>Yep. I argued that even if it costs a few man-years, it would be worth it.
>If the cost turns out to be counted in man-hours instead, it just makes my
>argument that much stronger.

Actually, my main response, that has been lost, was that it wasn\'t a
matter of time.  The records are either going to be faked well enough
for him to get away or they aren\'t and this will be shown up
fairly quickly.  The amount of time doesn\'t matter.  However, if
you have to spend man-years on each ship that jumps to pick out
the pirates, it is _not_ going to be cost effective.  If you
have to spend man hours it will, and this is something that
catches some fraction of the pirates.

>>If you think they are forwarded to the subsector headquarters, it could go

Only that each ship paid taxes.  They won\'t care who they are if
they paid on so there will be no need for the kind of info to
be forwarded.  In fact, it is possible for it be conciously removed
to encourage criminals to pay taxes.  In the USA it is quite possible
for you to pay taxes on illegal income an not get caught.  Some
do just that to avoid Al Capone\'s fate (the never caught him for
mob activities, just for income tax evasion).  This all is also
irrelevant if the Imperium doesn\'t tax ships directly.

>>that foolproof the most wanted list in the US wouldn\'t exist.

Well, this get back to the kind of universe we see Traveller as being.
This has been disputed.  However, as I mention above, I\'m not convinced
this would be as effective you portray.

He is going to go several worlds over before he does business.
No pirate is going to attack another ship and then blithly
land at he same system.

You presented this a minimum that was adequate to catch pirates.
I was pointing out that it isn\'t even close to the task.

How much more info will depend on how much more you have (which
have disuputed before) and how much more you need (which we have
disputed).  Thus, the question hangs on assumptions and questions
that people don\'t agree on (which we knew :-).

Not sure he\'s actually saying that, but its true.  However, the warning would
be quite long (could actually be an interesting scenario -- a supernova occurs
at location X, it arrives at these worlds in these times, organize the
evacuation).  Hm..wonder what the lethal distance for a supernova is?  Does
anyone actually know?  I\'d guess your typical supernova (say, 100 billion solar
luminosities) would cause drastic climate effects out to a couple of parsecs,
and throw out enough hard radiation to kill surface life out to some ten
parsecs, but that\'s just a wild ballpark guess, anyone have real numbers?

          Old Traveller Miniatures for Sale

Hello fellow gamers. I have a number of old Traveller minis that have been
gathering dust  for a long time, that I have finally decided  I can part
with. Almost all of them are the old "Martian Metals" 15mm Traveller line.
Now its my understanding that most of these molds were destroyed in a fire
at Martian Metals many years ago. Maybe someone out there can confirm this,
but I do know that I have NEVER,in  almost twenty years of attending cons
,seen  these miniatures offered for sale. I have never seen them ANYWHERE
else, except in my collection.  I mention this not only to make them sound
extremely rare (ohh,ahhh) but to find out once and for all if the fire
story is true. I know that there are still hardcore fans of the best
science fiction role-playing system ever  written that may have the answer.

Well, on with the list:

20 Vargr mercenaries (10 painted)
24 Aslan Warriors (mixed vacc suit and combat armor)
11 Stinkin Zo (Zhodani in combat armor, painted)
11 Imperial Strike Team (I think that\'s what they were called.Painted)
12 Sword Worlder Troops.
  7 Adventures in vacc suit
32 Adventures in various garb (some in military dress, some in civilian.29
are painted).Most are armed with pistols, laser and otherwise, and
including 6 female adventures.
10 Imperial citizens.

Also, I have a few of the old "Laserburn" figures that you can use for
Traveller:

6 Redemptionist Rebels.
4 Adventurers.
3 Marines in Dreadnought armor.
These are pretty cool looking figs.

That makes a total of 137 figures. Now I  have no idea what to ask for the
figs so if you are interested in the them  please make me an offer.  All
offers will be considered, as I need spending money for historicon. Please
e-mail me as soon as you can as I need to make the sale  quickly. Also, I
will be happy to answer any questions that you may have. 

Thanks, 

Rick

Sure.  The problem is actually getting up the resolve to do anything about the
problem, imperial technology can\'t prevent a supernova, and the Imperium is
pretty clearly slow to react to even immediate threats.  Most likely imperial
technology will know \'this star will go supernova soon\' (say, next couple
thousand years) and then will get more warning within a year or so of the
actual nova.  That\'s plenty of slip to ignore for a long time and then suddenly
have to deal with a problem

IOW, a typical S-curve, or learning-curve. ;->

I\'d like to see a good algorithm for a curve that simulates a
exponential/logarithmic curve, too.  I think that fits a goodly number
of functions I\'d like to model.

What is available for purchase by outsiders at a Starport and what is
available for general purchase by inhabitants of a system don\'t have
to be the same thing.  First, I can see many situations where a ruling
elite might want to keep technologies away from the general
population, but wants them for itself and wants the "hard currency" it
gets from selling them to tourists/travelers passing though...there
are situations like that RW on Earth.  ;-> Second, items for the
repair and maintenace of starships might be available at, let\'s say,
TL 12, at the starport, but TL 12 *comsumer* items are generally
unavailable to anybody.

I see the UWP\'s as a guide to *travelers* and that\'s about all. 
Actual, TLs for internal use in a system can be very different.  As
I\'ve said, this is IMTU, what you do IYTU is your business, and you
know I don\'t recognize ACTU.

Well, I don\'t assure players that their PC\'s will find anything at
"normal prices" ever!  The UWP\'s TL is a guide as to what is
*probably* available in the system, but there is no guarantee on real
availability, quality, or price.  

Maybe it\'s a difference between *running* a campaign and designing
things.  As a GM, I don\'t want the players to feel sure about
anything, and the only rule they can count on is that the GM is the
only one that makes the rules.  As a designer, things are totally
different, as designer I want certainty.

I go with jump space being featureless as well..the true definition of
nothingness.  However, I still use the description of shifting,
swirling colors.  

These colors are caused when the residual jump mass slowly passes
through the jump bubble into jspace resulting in a strange radiation
effect.  Different elements and velocities of the atoms as they cross
the barrier produce different wavelengthed emissions, thus producing
different colors.  The swirling is a normal effect related to the
lines of force produced by the jump grid.

Bah, have real fun.  Consider Deneb (Deneb/Deneb 0305 B445A21-C).  Orbits a

Margret\'s spouse is an upper-management Tukera (Count Blaine Trulla Tukera). 
Oberlindes operates primarily in the Spinward Marches\' Regina and Aramis 
subsectors (the Traveller Adventure involved their expansion into Aramis) 
and the Vargr extents.

Al Morai is a sector-wide company, operating in the Matches and into Deneb and 
Trojan Reaches.

I thought she was married to Blaine Tukera. In fact I\'me positive of
this because her faction is listed as having the Vermene as their intel
arm, and the basis of her \'keep the trains running\' outlook.

No real numbers, but a gaming suggestion.  As the effect should reduce
by range how about something like...

     Die-off from 
      Radiation

 Parsecs   % Killed
 ===================
    1        6/6
    2        5/6
    3        4/6
    4        3/6
    5        2/6
    6        1/6
 
 Modifiers:  -1 Inside building (concrete/brick)
             -2 Underground  (+3 meters of dirt/rock)
             -3 Deep underground (+10 meters of dirt/rock)
             
Ecosystems close to a supernova would be destroyed no matter what
anybody does, but digging in deep and waiting it out would allow many
people to survive and begin to recolonize the surface after the
particle wave passes over.

I said _evacuate_ not _simulate the effects of the supernova_. I know
the two sound and look very similar...;-)

It\'s a poorly known number; between a few parsecs and 10-20 parsecs is a
reasonable range for guesses.

On the other hand, the supernova rate for the whole galaxy is one per 10-50
years, or about one per million years per sector, so there should be 
relatively few in the Imperium.

(Although I\'m considering setting a campaing in a Islands-like subsector that
has been completely cut off from the Imperium by a supernova on the only
jump route to Imperial space...) 

For even more excitement, a gamma-ray-burst event (if the numbers for the
Really Big Burst recently observed are right) might have a kill radius of 
fifty to a hundred parsecs.

As someone mentioned, Imperiallines isn\'t one of the megacorps officially.
The original reference suggested that Imperiallines was a subsector or
sector-wide company operating in the Marches.  The concept seems to have
been that other names and corporations that weren\'t obviously related were
used outside the Marches to maintain the cover.  (Besides being a good idea,
this means the referee can use, say, "Kashkanun Freight" as a stand-in for
Imperiallines once the players know about that secret.)

Otherwise, in scale it *is* Imperium-wide....

And how long will it take to pass? Makes a difference if you have a SLOW

Unless your world is tidelocked (in which case it has a pretty weird ecosystem
to begin with) its rotation period isn\'t very important, supernovas usually
last for weeks.  Of course, depending on the tilt of its orbit as compared to
the supernova, some portion of the planet near one pole or the other (half the
planet, under ideal circumstances) will not be illuminated).

That was tukera! Margaret was married to a tukera (and accordind to the Traveller Adventure)
Tukera and Oberlindes are not on speaking terms!

There is no such thing as a small megacorp. 
The term excludes small corps.megacorps either are megacorps or they are no megacorps?

Ah, but we are not talking about people that pass through an airport by
the hundreds every day, we are talking about starships that are visiting
Class E starports which only gets a few visitors per month.

Well, I\'m assuming for purposes of this argument that the authorities are
not even taking a few cheap, basic precautions, because its been years
and years since the last pirate attack, and you claim that in such a
case preventive measures will inevitably deteriorate. I don\'t agree with
you about that, but I\'m trying to meet you halfway, so what the hell,
none of the so-called \'Big Brother\' stuff.

>then you just have a picture of one person and bunch of fake ship records,

Well no, you have the exact ship class (I refuse to believe that you can
disguise a ship against close visual inspection), which reduce the number
of possible ships to a few hundred to begin with. That\'s assuming that this
merchant is running the risk of faking his identity long before he even
knows that he is going to luck into an opportunity to capture someone.
Which is a pretty silly assumption IMO.

>how do you track him down in a huge Empire where communications may not
>even move as fast as he does?

If he has gone back to normal merchant activity he is not outrunning the
Xboat network, let alone the Scout and Navy couriers. Come to that, if he
is flying a more or less normal merchant ship, perhaps a little souped up,
then he is not going to outrun them even if he is just jumping his two
parsecs per week. Still, I agree that if he scoots the moment he has
commited the crime then he stands a good chance of getting out of the
Imperium. In fact, I do believe I stated that just a few exchanges ago.
But that isn\'t what we\'re discussing, now is it? We\'re discussing
someone "running with the fishes", doing legitimate business in between
the occasional opportune capture.

That really goes without saying (though it leaves unexplained why he was
in the system to begin with if he didn\'t have any business in it), but it
just isn\'t enough, because he can\'t change the fact that he left a system
within range the previous week.

>Well, as you know, some don\'t agree with you on this.

Yes I know, but I still don\'t know (because you still haven\'t told me) how
you imagine that a ship can engage in legitimate merchant operations without
the people it does business with getting a pretty good idea about it. And
that\'s assuming it never carries freight. Or perhaps you think that there
are plenty of people willing to turn over a cargo to someone of whose
identity they don\'t have a pretty good idea?

So? Neither do I. But I do believe that it is fast enough to have codes
for 99% of all ships arriving before they do. Which is an altogether
different state of affairs.

They do? I thought most of us went with the CT version of transponders
and ignored the TNE travesty. It is (CT) canonical that it is possible to
get a special _extra_ transponder (some with more than one slot) that can
be programmed with fake identities. It is possible, though non-trivial,
to change these identities. What I refuse to believe is that just any
rambling would-be pirate could change the ship registry of all the
starports and navy ships it may encounter. I grant you that it\'s possible
to change your transponder code from FLAMING EYE to DRIVEN SNOW, but how
is that going to help you when there is no DRIVEN SNOW in the ship
registry?

Nowadays they stamp engine numbers so deep into the engine that they only
way to remove them is to remove all the metal (which tend to be easily
spotted and detrimental to the performance of the engine to boot). Still,
I granted you that one too, didn\'t I?

He is supposed to heve been engaged in regular merchant operations until
he got his opportunity, remember? Multiple jumps between transactions is
not the reccomended way to make ends meet for a merchant.

>You are going to get a lot of ships like the general type.

But almost all of them will show up at their proper destination because
they are not trying to fake anything. Only the very few that has something
to hide will not, and those few are the ones you start checking up on.

>You are going to then comb those records ones that have been faked or
>where the pirate has failed to cover a crucial bit of info.

But the problem for the pirate is that he can at most fake one part of the
records, his own identity (and I don\'t believe it is all that easy even to
do that, but let that lie for the moment). It\'s kind of like double-entry
book-keeping. Just changing one entry won\'t do you any good. On the
contrary, it will stick out like a sore thump. You have umpteen ships
jumping from the various systems one week and umpteen minus one ships
arriving the next. Nothing anyone will care about normally, but easily
spotted when someone does begin to check.

>However, if you have to spend man-years on each ship that jumps to pick
>out the pirates, it is _not_ going to be cost effective. 

No, but as I\'ve already pointed out twice now, you don\'t have to spend
man-years on each ship, because a simple comparison of starport records
will exonerate most of them.

>>If they are taxing the ships\' activities, they will be happy to bother with

If the Imperium is using the same tax scheme the the Regency used later,
the amount each ship owes depends on how many passengers and how many
tons of cargo it carries. To have any chance of checking up one these
ships, records of what ships left with what passengers and cargoes
would be collected at each starport.

Thereby sticking out like a sore thumb wherever he winds up because he
arrives without having done any business with the neighboring systems.
And his alter ego sticks out like a sore thumb back where he came from
because he left a starport and didn\'t show up in any neighboring
system. Gee, I wonder if that could be the pirate?

>No pirate is going to attack another ship and then blithly land at he

At least we can agree with that. Bit of a problem for him if he is
carrying anything destined for that system, don\'t you think? And if
he isn\'t, what is he doing in that system in the first place?

"Pointing out" isn\'t the same thing as refuting. Tell me, just how many
ships do you envisage flying around the Spinward Marches?

If you call saying "I don\'t agree" disputing. I don\'t think much of

Indeed we did. Whenever your opponents come up with some figures you say
"I don\'t agree" without providing any suggestions of your own. Not very
constructive IMO.

Things like how much more information than just the ship tonnage you would
have if the pirate only takes the cargo, you mean?

Well, I am a firm believer in vetting randomly generated stats after the
fact, so I would have no compunction about changing UWPs that are too
weird. My standard way of dealing with such is to spend some time trying
my damndest to figure out a way to account for the stats and then, if I
can\'t come up with anything, make the smallest change that will make it
work for me. So my first impulse would be to eliminate those two Vargr
as being too implausible.
	However, one thing that has never been established is how many
people it takes at a minimum to run a society of a given TL. For TLs
below our own I expect it is possible to figure something out (Leonard,
do you have any ideas about this? How many people does it take at a
minimum to perform all the functions necessary to a TL 1, 2, 3, etc
society?) But for higher TLs it is trickier. Does one man with a Mobile
Fabrication Unit like the one in _Central Supply Catalogue_ constitute a
stable TL 10 society? How about two Vargr with a TL 16 Mobile Fabrication
Unit?
	As for the high-class starports I believe that there is some fairly
large minimum number of people needed to run one, but I\'m not sure how many.

No, Al Morai is an independent company owned by (some of) its employees.
In 1110 it was a sector-wide company covering much of the Spinward Marches.
In 1202 it had expanded into the rest of the Regency.

Al Morai is an independent sector wide corporation.  It was established in
120 on Mora (still home base).  A full description of Al Morai is available
on pp 30-31 of the Spinward Marches Campaign.

Akerut, on the other hand, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tukera in the
Aramis subsector (the Akerut name is just a [can\'t remember term]
rearrangement of the Tukera name).  Tukera services only the major trade
routes, and establishes subsidiaries, of which Akerut is one, to provide
service along feeder routes.  Akerut has (as of 1105-1107) a fleet of fifty
5000 ton displacement "Hercules" class bulk carriers which are generally
occupied shuttling cargos to and from the Vargr border.  This information
is from p 135 of The Traveller Adventure.

Coincidentally, I\'m planning to set my non-canon Trav universe in a
M:0-like period, just at the tail-end of a Long Night *caused by a
supernova*.

IMTU, I\'m using the \'jumpspace planes\' concept, in which jumpspace can be
distorted by gravity in various ways. I\'ve decided that a really big
disturbance, like, say, a supernova, would create vast, chaotic effects in
jumpspace, thus disrupting jump travel for, say, a 50 parsec radius. The
disruptions for *centuries*.

Boom: instant Long Night. Well, not quite instant; the effect spreads out
at the spead of light, just to make it that much scarier. Everything seems
normal until the supernova appears in the sky, a very real harbringer of
doom, and suddenly nobody can jump outsystem any more. Their drives just
don\'t work, or worse, they *automatically misjump*. And just as suddenly,
arrivals stop appearing in-system. 

Makes the Black Curtain and the Empress Wave look positively comforting. 

100 parsecs across would be a big area in the canonical TU, though not
*too* vast. But my game universe is 3D (though mapped in flat planes,
stacked up). A 100pc sphere is a pretty huge volume of space. Somewhere
inside of which, of course, is most of the Terran Expansion...

GRB\'s are known to have wiped out several ancient high civilizations IMTU.

I\'m slowly developing a rather lurid billion-year galactic history. Entire
advanced civilizations come and go constantly, like bubbles in a glass of
beer.

Best,

Only if he is stupid enough to visit the port at a system he has

Well, is isn\'t just that.  The list has had flame wars on what is
reasonable (a also refer back to my post on the question of why,
if relative cost is what matters, every home doesn\'t have a security
system, or why every subway train doesn\'t have a security camera)
and we also disagree on how effective they are.

Well, if he is also engaging in smuggling other activities, the
already has reason to.  (A merchant who engages in both legal and
illegal activities isn\'t going to be restricted to smuggling).

Yeah, and the Xboats only go along the back bone.  The news then
has to be transmitted of the backbone and to many worlds it has to
linger, waiting for the next courier.  My PCs have shown that
it is quite possible to, if you try, keep ahead of news.

No, I\'m just talking of getting out the general region, then the

They do have a "pretty good" idea.  A criminal works by beig the rare
exception to an otherwise reliable system.  If they are to numerous
the system will break down.  The system of records is going
to be good enough to keep crime down to a reasonable level so that
merchants only have a low level of loss.  There
is going to be something a chance 1/1,000 or 1/10,000 of a cargo
getting lost to pirates, stolen by dishonest merchants, etc.
(Similarly is the canon crime of skipping out on payments).
All this hangs together and matches how crimes historically
work.

To catch a pirate this way the Imperium is going to need records
of every port that every ship ever visits throughout the Imperium
and they are going to have to be current.  (otherwise you are
a ship that just came in from out of the sector).  Then they are
going to have to check that with the transponder of every ship
that arrives in port.  This goes beyond "non trivial".  And
even then, you don\'t catch a pirate that just does wilderness
refueling, skips over a system, and leaves no record he was
ever in the system in question.

Again, that assume that every planet has a current registry of
every ship in service.  I don\'t believe this is possible.

And, as metal working moves up to Traveller TL 12 or even 15 removing
such thing that are mearly stamped into metal become trivial.

Well, the free cargo helps a lot in changing that.  Especially
if he was taking a rick in finding a cargo at the world.  If
he was smuggling he might not even have to give that up.  This
assumes he takes just the cargo (which I favor).  If you pushed
this you _might_ get me to think that they take the whole ship.
In which case I would drop the levels of piracy the Imperium
would tolerate by an order of magnitude or so.

>>You are going to get a lot of ships like the general type.

How do you know that a ship hasn\'t shown up at there destination?
You can\'t telephone to find out.  You could try an institute
the kind of meticulous system of ship tracking many of us
just don\'t see as "Traveller" where every time a ship arrives
a message is sent back to the originating system that they
left from.  But you are going to know that the ship didn\'t
show up at it\'s destination until weeks later, and then
you have to take at least a week to send an alert to
the neighboring system that will have to wait for transport
to all those system.

No,they need records that "a" ship arrived and paid taxes.

And how do they know this.  They can telephone neighboring

I agree.  However, you were accusing me of "grasping at extremes"
I was pointing out how my response was, in fact, suitable based
on what you had posted.

When they were disputed before, there was more than "I disagree".
Hans, we both know that most of these subpoints have been beaten
to death.  I could give point that were given before and you
could respond with responses that were given before and we
could reargue ever subthread.  But I\'m just not intersted.

>>[Things already covered snipped....]

Hans, I scanned down the message and saw that everthing else
I felt had been covered.  If I didn\'t repond to specific sentence
it was because it was covered or irrelevant in the broader scheme
of things.  After all, you youself don\'t hit every single point
(like when you started in on how it taking only man-hours to
check records support your case when I had already said that
I felt the time necessary was an unimportant side issue.)
Don\'t play these games, it make debating with you highly unpleasant.

That is what I really don\'t like about this list.  Everyone
is alway looking to attack the other person rather than simply
find out where this disagree.  That and the fact that nobody
can seem to accept the legitamacy of views they don\'t agree
with.  It could be so much more pleasant.  Sometimes I
wonder why I bother and just don\'t stick with lists that
are more fun.

Also the Imperium needs to keep records about the various nations, what

As I recall, you ought to be safe at about 20-50 parsecs. Inside that,
it\'ll screw up planetary magnetic fields, cause massive radiation
problems, and other nasties.

But I was saying that neutrino detectors are designed for a much
*lower* neutrino flux. It\'d be sort of like taking a night vision scope
to Mercury and pointing it at the sun. Fry!

Ok, the detectors on earth totaled maybe 100 square meters of area for
the neutrinos to have passed through. They got 4-6 neutrinos detected
from the supernova. Call it 5 neutrinos. That\'s 5/100 or 1/20th of a
neutrino per square meter "detectable flux".

If one neutrino in a zillion <grin> is detectable, that means the total
flux was 1/20th of a zillion per square meter. Ok?

Now, that was at 100,000 parsecs. At 200,000 AU per parsec that\'s
20,000,000,000 AU.

Flux follows the inverse square law. That is, if the flux a distance A
is B, then the flux at 2A is B/2^2. 

So that tells us that the flux at 10 AU would be 10/20,000,000,000
*squared* time the flux at earth.

Anyway, you go thru all this, and it works out that 1e17
(100,000,000,000,000,000) neutrinos would be detected by a square meter
of detector at 10 AU. And using our "one in a zillion detected" rule,
that means that you\'d have 1e17 *times* a zillion neutrinos passing
thru. Only the 1e17 would actually *affect* anything. Such as anybody
in the vicinity.

A supernova generates so *many* of them that the small percentage that
*do* interact will give a lethal radiation dose at 10 AU.

To help you get an idea of just how *many* are generated, when that
Supernova in the Lesser Magellanic Cloud was observed in 1989(?),
neutrino detectors on Earth received 4-6 neutrinos from the core
collapse. That\'s at something like 100,000 parsecs. Back calculate
using the inverse square law and the flux is something *insane*. 

Let\'s see. A parsec is about 2e5 AU. So that makes our distance about
2e10 AU. divide by 10 AU. Gives 2e9. square that to get 2e18. times 5
(median) gives 1e19 neutrinos.

Now consider that the total detector cross section was on the order of
100 square meters. So that gives a flux of 1e17 *interacting* neutrinos
per square meter. The number of non-interacting ones doesn\'t bear
thinking about. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Does cross section matter? I thought it was just volume and perhaps
density.

How many per cubic meter? One person = one twelfth a cubic meter?

My sums for 100 parsecs from a SuperNova give 5 Million per square
meter. That sounds unhealthy.

Any idea of safe distance and intensity/lethal dose?

Add to this the recent astronomical speculations(?) about the eventual
collapse of two closely orbiting neutron stars to form a black hole,
with massive meson emission, maybe really could sterilise a whole
galaxy? 

Unblockable Mesons as well as unblockable Neutrinos, ain\'t we lucky?

If the asteroid doesn\'t trash you, and the supernova doesn\'t ash you,
the collapsing black holes probably will :)

So perhaps the sensible thing for an old high TL culture really is to
head off into intergalactic space?  Either that or live inside a white
globe. And of course thats why SETI hasn\'t found anyone yet :)

What, you mean exactly like the generation ship in the Metamorphis Alpha
(to Omega) RPG?

I was wondering how to fit that ship into Traveller. So rather than the
silly mutation background, it becomes gramps forgotten geneering sealed
colony experiment :)  I think I could make it fit. Methinks I will take
another look at this when I get back home.

It also dwarfs every other ship in the Imperium. 

Its appearance in Imp space would give the Emperor the perfect excuse to
order a lab ship or two :)

Consider that the Imperium is much more advanced that current Earth technology.
If we extrapolate some current technology to Traveller (as is done with other
things) , isn\'t possible to say that we can predict a SuperNova sort of how we
predict earthquakes or other weather patterns on Earth?

Now if the Imperium can do this they can give a Star and a system , and the
surrounding areas some kind of rating based on the predicted lifetime of the
star. Considering that the Imperium (at the time of the Rebellion) is at least
a thousand years old, a star can be predicted to
    1) Overdue for a SuperNova or other major event.
    2) Completely Stable
    3) Major Stellar event expected within a thousand years.

With this prediction ability we can make some other extrapolations.

If a Stellar system and it surrounds are overdue, they could be rated Amber or
Red. Further Insurance rates on businesses , homes, etc in this area
can be so high that it is no longer worthwhile to live here.

On the other hand, perhaps this area is on the fringe of a strategic or
profittable area and people residing here get hazard pay for staying within
an area that may be decimated by a Stellar event at any time.

You are a shipyard on a TL11 planet. You build reasonably efficient TL11
2000t jump-2 freighters - biggish fusion plant, thruster plates, jump-2,
pretty poor sensors. Your TL11 warships, on the other hand, suck.

You know of a nearby TL15 planet. It builds slightly better TL15 freighters
- - their power plants are about half the size, but everything else is pretty
similar. Their TL15 warships are hell on wheels.

You therefore approach the TL15 world with an offer to build all their
slow, clunky freighters, in exchange for a much smaller value of TL15
warships. It\'s a good deal for you, because you get more firepower at less
cost than building TL11 warships as well would have got you. It\'s a good
deal for them, because they get more freighters for less cost.

>So the only reason that one would buy a lower techlevel of expensive

A very old Traveller product (Striker) suggested that equipment of higher
TL than produced locally needs double the amount of maintainence and costs
20% of sticker cost each year in hard currency for spare parts. This makes
a lot of sense to me.

Because an engineer who is used to using very high tech equipment is
probably going to have problems with engines designed to be thumped with a
spanner to get them working again ... things that have *shudder* no
electronics.

Records are going to be kept by the starport authorities, by the ship
itself, by the freight, passenger and cargo brokers and possibly by the
Imperial authorities as well.

They are going to range from grossly inadequate to exceedingly detailed -
if I am going to send a megacredit worth of computer parts somewhere, I am
going to be damn sure I can answer the question \'where is the cargo now\'.

The fact that holding such records makes piracy insanely difficult is
merely a nice side benefit. It is going to happen because people need to
know what is happening with their business and when. It also helps stop
merchants just disappearing with the goods ... after all, with no records,
what stops you claiming the freight you are carrying is actually your own
speculative cargo ?

The Imperium may tax commerce going thru starports, it may invoice worlds

Part of this depends on whether you regard the Imperium as a feudal system,

The available evidence can be read either way.

I was thinking about it, but it was way too late and I just wanted the damn

announce that planet is where the next IN Surplus auction is to be held is

Part of why I thought the rules were needed is that it lets you establish a
framework for a Raiders and Traders or a Corporate Brute Squad game.

If the players are playing \'The Man Who Would be King\' and do knock over
some low-tech world, make em run it. Make em deal with actually running it,
rather than throwing an Imperial Marine Landing Force at them.

If players are traders, give them a world with specific needs \'We dont have
any money, but we can give you a hold full of x, which you could sell on Y.
We really need a new fission plant we can maintain locally, which you could
get on A\'.

Corporate Brute Squad ... \'We were shepherding this Finance team who were
trying to lend forty small ones to this dirtball world\'.

It can also be done to show a number of worlds developing over time - the
GM can sit down beforehand and plot out (probably with a spreadsheet) how a
subsector will develop. A colony of 2000 people is going to be
substantially affected by the annual visit of a single Far Trader.

Well, let\'s see.  As an example, I\'ll take the "Trimkhana-Brilliance" drop
liner design I posted a while back (800/1120 dtons; J4; 200 passengers and
48 tons cargo).  Given a hundred thousand of those (80 million d-tons of
shipping at TCr 32.4) running at normal capacity and a one-week turn over
at both sides of the jump, you can move a billion people and 240 million
tons of freight (240 kg per passenger) in four years.  Fifty thousand can
do it in eight years for TCr 16.2.  Note that this *is* a high-capacity
passenger liner that I\'m using to get a handle on the numbers.  Oh, and
add something like another TCr 5+ to cover reimbursement of the shipping
operators for the passengers.  The planet being evacuated should be able
to contribute substantially to this, though.

In practice, I\'m not sure there\'s this much passenger shipping available
even at the domain level, so you\'d have to convert freighters and build
more ships.  A handful of population-A worlds with class-A starports
might be able to collectively build this many ships in the time allowed.
Of course, there aren\'t many worlds like that in any sector.

In Vland\'s case, the Tukera Lines corporate HQ is one parsec away, at
Tauri....

It can be true. "The maximum TL that can be LOCALLY PRODUCED" doesn\'t say
that everything they produce is of the TL, just that anything they produce
is of that TL. A TL 10 planet with a population of say 10 humans might only
produce TL 10 belts and import everything else. The TL digit tells the ref
that IF something is locally produced then it CANNOT be of a TL above that.

I agree however that most ref (me included) tend to take the TL digit as a
description of what the general TL of the planet is be it locally produced
stuff or imported.

Oops that should read: It can be true. "The maximum TL that can be LOCALLY

anything they PRODUCE is of that TL or less.

The above will depend on how you see the political dynamics of the 
Empire. How much power do Imperium-spanning, Dreadnaught-building,
Planet-owning Megacorps have at the Imperial Court? If they have too
little to suit themselves, you might very well see them help install a
very different Imperial Court.

Assuming a Megacorp used some tact and at least maintained the facade
of obeying Imperial Law (such as GSbAG running Psi-Drug factories, but
being nice enough to run them outside the boundries of the Imperium),
the Emperor might be leery of moving against them for "minor
misunderstandings". I don\'t have a good feel for the economic might
represented by these Megacorps, but it might rival that of many
Sectors - such power is a much better ally than enemy, and demanding
a 40 GigaCredit fine (sorry, "contribution") might make them a lot less
friendly.

Regardless, I would say that if a Megacorp wanted to do something
heinous, they would have layers and layers of deniability well in place
before the first nefarious act occurred. You might find a secret base,
but unless the penalty for tax evasion is death you\'re not getting him
to tell you where the profits went. It\'s likely that the front company
he was working for (a layer or two away from anything traceable to the
Megacorp in question) will happily liquidate him if they think he will talk,
and use people that can\'t be traced back to them to do it.

Count me in!  I have a friend who is going to be casting the old Morrow

(a) If the imperium can predict supernovae as well as we can predict

Well, there _is_ a reason they called it MegaTypo...;-)

Actually there was a discussion about this about the time that T4 came
out, and MM\'s official word was that any event not in the current milieu
is to be considered aproximate. After all we are typically dealing with
dates several hundreds if not thousands of years in the past.



Take the T4 date (4521) as canon.

 I had it straight from Steve Jackson (of SJG), once a close associate of
Martian Metals, that MM did indeed burn, and that most or all of their molds
and equipment were lost. Among the lamented dead are the only miniatures for
Rivets or Chitin-1 ever produced...

Bionic Man is on the Horizon 

Special to ABCNEWS.com
     June 23 - In The Six Million Dollar Man, Lee Majors played
an astronaut brought back to life after a terrible crash, with
mechanical eyes and limbs that gave him superhuman powers.
The catch phrase on the show was, "We have the technology."
Now this line is more than just a catch phrase, it\'s a reality. 
     Carol Burns started going deaf five years ago. "I always
felt like I was on the outside looking in," she says. "I wasn\'t
really fully a part of everything." 
     Last year, Burns received a cochlear implant, a tiny device
embedded inside her ear. It translates sound into the electrical
impulses her brain needs to understand sound. 
     "The telephone? I\'ve gone from barely being able to hear
a dial tone to understanding 96 percent on the phone now,"
she beams. 

This Is Not SciFi 
     And what works for ears will also work for eyes and
someday even limbs, as in the well-known 1970s television
series. We have the capability to build the world\'s first bionic
man....

A Bionic Brain
...Dr. Jerry Pine and his team of scientists at Cal Tech...
invented the neurochip, a device that combines computer chips
with living brain cells.

1. Hans made me think: a rare thing indeed!  The local law

2. If so, then perhaps traffic protection is an Imperial thing,
   while local enforcement and is a different thing.  Oh, what a
   headache.  For now I\'ll just lump them together and let that
   idea simmer awhile.

Anyway:
The article is posted at

	http://www.metronet.com/~washi/Tas/Calida_Orbital/index.html

A script to do all the hard work is at

	http://www.metronet.com/~washi/Tas/Online/index.html

...except it seems to still use an index of 0.39... naughty, naughty,
my mistake.



First, calculate a \'trade index\' like so:

	  Starport (A=3, B=2, C=1, D=0, E=-1, X=-2)

	+ ( Population digit  - 6 )

        + ( ceiling( TL / 2 ) - 4 )	# \'ceiling\' means round up!
				  	# don\'t round at all for granularity...
        + ( Naval Base?  +1 )
          ( XBoat Route? +1 )
          ( Gas Giant?   +1 )
          ( Amber Zone?  -2 )
          ( Red Zone?    -4 )

This produces a value V from -16 to 14, or thereabouts.

To find the traffic between two worlds:

	1. Caculate the systems\' trade indices, V1 and V2.

	2. Subtract the distance D (in parsecs) from V1 and V2:

		V1a = V1 - D
		V2a = V2 - D

	3. There is no trade if either value is less than 1.
	   Otherwise, the passenger traffic is:
	
	10 ^ [ ( V1a * V1b ) ^ 0.36 ]

	So, the "population digit" for weekly passenger
  	traffic is

	     [ ( V1a * V1b ) ^ 0.36 ]


The exponent and the UWP value mappings are the numbers I fiddle
with for now... the equation is about as complex as I like it; a
different equation of relative simplicity would also be fine by me.

Examples:

By the way, the combined populations of the system pairs above are:

The only shocker to me is the JT-Celepina connection... that\'s a really

make a trip to Jae Tellona over a citizen\'s lifetime.

OK, but remember this is from someone who hasn\'t looked at Pocket
Empires.  

The settlement results seem to imply that every place on the world\'s
surface is equally hospitable in that there is no "all the good land
it taken" multipliers.  If we are the first people to settle a planet,
we should be able to choose a location with *all* the right
attributes, if they exist anywhere on the world.  In essence, we\'re
guaranteed a good harbor, plentiful water etc.  It seems that this
factor should be significant, probably changing an annual growth rate
of 3% into an annual growth rate of 6%. (Neglecting external
investment.)

Of course, this has to be a decreasing function as the planet gains
more population.

I must admit, that when I read this, I thought it said "lawyers and 
lawyers of deniability..."  I laughed, then realized what it said.  Then 
I realized that in fact, that was what was meant!  :-)

I\'ve been thinking about the power of the Imperial Nobility, other 
worlds, and the various levels of corporations.  This would be a very 
interesting thread.  

An imperial noble in my mind is very powerful, especially at the higher 
levels.  A Marquis could make things very unpleasant for a company doing 
business on "his" world.  But I think that would depend on both the 
world and the company, as well as his connections to other nobility and 
pull at court.  A Sector-Wide company could ignore him though, don\'t you 
think, unless the world was a major producer of lanthanum-enriched 
widgets or whatever that the company needed.  How bout a subsector wide 
company?  You think the Evil Empire (tm) of MicroSoft is tough?  How 
bout when a company that spans WORLDS starts getting pissed...

And a MegaCorp?  I don\'t think there is much comparison, unless you are 
a Duke or ArchDuke.  Maybe a count could make them miserable for a 
while, but what if the corp turned on the noble and started a campaign 
against him?  

Lots of intrigue!

I\'m working on this right now IMTU, and having a ball!

\'Produced\', especially in this day and age, doesn\'t mean the same as made.
What if the TL of items \'produced relates to high tech equipment assembled
from components manufactured off world, or relates to the TL of the
equipment used to make items.

A modern day example would be a car plant outside the first world making
vehicles for Europe or North America, or a chemical/process plant built
from high tech equipment to meet a local need.

Seems to me that all this poses a significant improbability for there
being advanced life on Earth. After all, it took us how many hundreds of
millions of years to get to this stage? If at any point along the way
we could have been wiped out by a nearby supernova, gamma-ray burst,
chuck of rock, etc... then what are the odds of all these things _not_
happening? Clearly, we got hit by a few rocks. Life bounces back. But
if a supernova or gamma-ray burst can _sterilize_ the planet at 10-100
parsecs, then it seems to me that the odds against advanced life just
became nearly insurmountable. The fact that we are here to appreciate
this notion shows that perhaps we are among the lucky few, and it
forms quite a nice solution to Fermi\'s Paradox about why aliens aren\'t
dropping out of the sky like flies. Anyone want to run some numbers
and theorize about the odds of some random, life-bearing planet
clearing this hurdle? I mean, is it something like 10%? 1%? 0.00001%?
This would have a huge impact on any SF-campaign.

These are semi-facetious names I use for the ruts that many Traveller
campaigns tend to fall into.  \'Raiders \'n Traders\' is where the characters
are merchants, buying and selling cargos with the occasional pirate
encounter or smuggling venture.  OK for beginners, but they never seem to
really go anywhere.  \'Corporate Brute Squad\' has the characters as mostly
ex-Army and Marine types, doing odd jobs (usually illegal and/or violent)
for various mystery patrons.  These are the Traveller equivalents of the D&D
\'dungeon  crawl\' and \'you meet a cloaked stranger in a tavern\' schticks.
Sorry for any confusion!

I recall from Survival Margin that Antares was being studied and was expected
to go supernova relatively recently.

Dear Diary,

Went to Louie\'s place on Treece last week and traded my old T5 transponder 
plug-on for one with three slots... one E/P slot just isn\'t enough for me.
Just yesterday I found a guy (\'Lefty\') with some stolen registry tapes, and 
bought a couple hundred ship codes off him.  That should keep me going for 
awhile.

Since Treece is off the X-Boat route, and Inthe is clamping down on
expenditures to make its starport upgrade payments, the Courier\'s
schedule is a bit spotty.  Also, few of these tramp liners bother to
enter their manifest with the starport authority... heck, lots don\'t
even file flight plans.  Why bother?  A misjump is a 50-50 chance of
death anyhow; why give away your coords to the repo man?  So an
occasional, accidental wipe of the records isn\'t going to be noticed
much... I\'ll bet there are several different official transponder
log collectors covering Treece -- say, a dozen organizations, mega-
corps, and banks (and don\'t forget the Scouts and Navy) for Regina,
Inthe, and Rhylanor, who occasionally whip by and grab whatever logs
are here.  There\'s way too much human element to keep track of all
visitors.  Oh, and don\'t forget people like Lefty, who is smart
enough to break into the beacon and force a purge.

Anyway, Treece gets no real traffic per week: just last week I see
there were 4 ships who registered... a 600t liner, a far trader,
and a couple of scouts... I know of a couple others who were here
but didn\'t register.

Hey, lookie here.  Says here that Treece\'s starport (really just
a few outbuildings and a 400-ton fuel depot) cost under 50 million
credits.  That\'s pretty cheap.  A wealthy individual could build
himself one, if he had a reason to.

Well, I\'m off to pillage a small trading post in the local asteroid
belt.  Wish me luck!

Yes but Talisman\'s putative \'thousands of generations later\' travellers

I\'m in the process of porting Jim Vassilakos Galactic program to run
on a Mac (using MacPerl) and on Unix (using Perl and Tk). The Unix
version is coming along nicely; the Mac version a bit more slowly.

I don\'t have an ETA for either.

I was surprised to learn that there are people who took 
that to mean that the sky was clear and blue - seems the youth of 
today are growing up with TV sets that bluescreen when 
there isn\'t a signal... 

sigh... The technology is changing all the similes.

Remember...The 3I is a _commerce_ based empire...Ol\' Cleon probably made
the heads of the Megacorps nobility to start with. The Nobles are far
more tangled in the affairs of the megacorps, than simply letting tem
run offices on their planets...

I don\'t mind people posting news stories -- if there\'s some traveller
related commentary, like a discussion of what TL bionic limbs would be
and how much they could do, how long, or how rugged they\'d be.  I can
get news stories off AP.


  From: "Smart, David J (David)" <David.Smart@ons.octel.com>
       Last year, Burns received a cochlear implant, a tiny device
  embedded inside her ear. It translates sound into the electrical
  impulses her brain needs to understand sound. 

I know someone who\'s working on doing cochlear implants.  This has
been reality for a couple years now.  It is useful for a specific kind
of hearing loss in which the nerves are still OK, but the ear
structure is not.  Normal hearing aids won\'t work.  But the implants
only send - the brain can\'t alter them directly.

  This Is Not SciFi 
       And what works for ears will also work for eyes and
  someday even limbs, as in the well-known 1970s television
  series. We have the capability to build the world\'s first bionic
  man....

As someone who\'s worked with locomotion in the MIT Leg Lab, which is
also doing research into knee orthoses, they have a few obstacles to
overcome before the six million dollar man comes into play.  Two that
leap to the top of my mind are power and control.  Enough power to wag
your leg around for hours will drain batteries pretty fast.  More
importantly, transferring impulses to motions is an extremely
difficult area of research.

  A Bionic Brain
  ...Dr. Jerry Pine and his team of scientists at Cal Tech...
  invented the neurochip, a device that combines computer chips
  with living brain cells.

I recall an article about successfully growing cells onto a computer
chip.  It didn\'t see if any two-way interaction came about, or how
long the cells could live.  Anybody know?


It seems to me that to control "bionic" limbs to be as good as the
real thing, one would need to automatically connect the right nerves
and decode the impulses.  There are too many nerves to do it any other
way.  So at what TL would such be possible?

Granted that different planets might develop certain aspects of technology
more than others, but it has always been my opinion that the ability to
clone/grow/regenerate replacement body parts would be of a lower tech
level than making truly realistic  electronic ones. Granted that
electronic limbs offer
some advantages, but if that were so great, why not just have your limbs
cut off and replaced premptively. Most people wouldn\'t see that as a great
idea.

I think that at Imperial tech levels you would see biological replacement
rather than mechanical replacement for injured/severed limbs. Maybe at
Tech Level B or so.

MHO.

Oh, now I am scared.  All this because I asked about people living in an impromptu

some of my other \'odd\' game ideas.  This is cool.

Yeah, and a friend who had worked at Lawrence Livermore Labs (an
installation you need secret clearance to get into) had
to have a lock down device for his calculator because of all
the theft.

Yeah, people put too much faith into systems of documentation.
And that is in the US where it only takes seconds to send a
message by phone, etc. compared to an Imperium where it
takes weeks to months.

I suspect we should wait until such effective artificial limbs/organs
are available and reliable before we make any pronouncement about how
many people would do it. The lack of cyber gear in Traveller is a very
consious decision on the part of the games designers, at least in this
\'Cyberpunk 2020\' day and age.

After all, look at how many people wore contact lenses when they were
hard, as opposed to now with soft, cheap, disposable lenses. Hell
they\'re giving away free trial pairs on TeeVee.

They are a significant number of people who wear non-corrective soft
lenses simply to change their eye color; a cosmetic thing.

Granted, this isn\'t the same as whacking off your arm and replacing it
with a cyber implant, but it\'s a clear indication of where people draw
the acceptability line. When I first got contact lenses, back in \'69 or
so (I was quite young when I got them) getting accustomed to them was a
long painful process that took over a month; someone wearing them just
to change eye color would have been considered eccentric to dangerously
insane, depending on who you asked.

When cyber limb replacements are around that give the level of sensation
and control that natural limbs do, with good reliability, I\'m sure there
are people who will consider getting them quite easily.

Say you\'re (to suggest a hackneyed stereotype) \'Microelectronics
technician\' having an arm with interchangeable, highly controllable
micromanipulators built-in, so to speak might be a natural thing to
have.

Mind you, exterior replacement arms with advanced feedback might come
close, but having something directly wired into your nervous system
would definitely give you an advantage.

  Without the permission of the original company or the current holders of
said rights it would be theft, AFAIK. Or piracy, if you\'ll pardon the
expression. 

  FWIW, the Martian Metals figures are hardly worth copying, as they\'re of
truly marginal quality (see page 21 of "Adventure Gaming #6 12/81" supplied
by Mr. Spieker for photos of better looking than average MM figs) to begin
with, even before the additional detail degradation to be expected with
recreating molds*.

  *I\'ve been told that the higher quality options are impractical for quantity.

  It might be more productive (and at least legal) to track down this company
"Hobby Products GmbH" who seem to be re-releasing under license the 15mm figures
from Citadel, which were (IMNSHO) the best 15mm Trav figures ever done. Is there
anyone on the list well-placed to look into a seemingly German mini\'s producer?

I propose

	... the original poster of the offer act as the intermediary to get
the actual figures.
	... the person doing the casting keep the duplicates as partial
payment for the actual effort involved

I very deliberately didn\'t identify the person in mind for two
reasons. (1) My memory is failing and I\'m not 100% certain who I
remember; (2) I don\'t even know if the person is interested, and
didn\'t want to expose him/her to the concerted whinings of the entire
list aimed in his/her direction; (3) there may be others beyond the
one I remember!

	In addition to the actual cost of purchasing the "originals,"
whoever wants copies will have to cough up the cost of making them
and mailing them. That\'s the other part of the partial payment. I\'d
consider the originals and the ability to have the molds as the
incentive.

	As for legality--I\'m no lawyer, and I don\'t play one in Traveller,
but I feel fairly confident in this assessment: it\'s ONLY legal if
Martian Metals gives their consent. And I\'ve no idea if they would.
Does anybody on the list have a special in with them, or should we
approach them shotgun?

It\'s questionable. Here\'s something to check out first: Back when Martian
Metals was still in business, they licensed RAFM to produce the figs, with the
proviso that they could not be sold in the US. Since MM is now gone, I\'m not
sure this holds, and RAFM may still have _their_ molds -- or at least their
masters.

Ask RAFM if they could consider a limited run if outsiders pay all the
costs...assuming the molds are still there. You\'ll get better quality figs
than someone\'s home copies, and stranger things have happened.

I have to agree with Bob on this one, when my ship was in Long Beach Naval
Shipyard they used old landing craft with the front ramp welded shut, as
pusher boats. They had several sitting on platforms made of railroad cross
ties at the end of jetty. The landing craft were about five feet off the
ground, on those railroad ties. 

One day a shipyard worker was sent out to pick out the best two of the five
on that jetty. He went out with a large mobile crane get them, place them
in the water and bring them back. He came back with the best two of the
three landing craft. What happened to the other two missing landing
craft...the shipyard never found out. The storage area was on the end of a
long jetty, with nothing their size around them, the jetty was on shipyard
property with a large fence wire on top. The shipyard used large mobile
cranes with place and remove them. Ingenious minds and time can do wonders.

All very well, but if that is true, it should be easy for you to provide
an example of a set of assumptions (none of which directly contradicted
the canon) where piracy is viable. Then maybe I would not agree with you
about the assumptions, but if the ramifications of those assumptions did
indeed make piracy viable then I would have to admit that it was a question
about a simple difference of opinion concerning basic assumptions. Instead
you keep pecking away at one assumption at a time, but never presenting a
coherent whole.

1) I\'ve several times said that I was talking about the record he left
behind before he committed the piracy and the trail he will leave behind
if he goes back to normal merchant operations after the piracy. 2) So
what? I already said that the first step is to collect records from all
systems withing range.

You have a point there. OK, if said merchant includes smuggling as part of
his legitimate merchant activities then he could have reason to use fake
identities on occasion.

I see. You believe that it is possible for a normal merchant to keep
ahead of unwelcome news and to prove it you tell us that as a Referee
you have allowed your PCs to do so. Think about that one for a moment.

This is an example of what I mean when I say that you focus on one
assumption at a time but fail to provide a coherent whole. Yes, a
ship can get from one venue to one a long way off by making a number
of jumps using wilderness refuelling to avoid visiting any starports.
But is that an economically sound strategy? Every jump the ship makes
without earning money is a loss. He will have to be able to fence the
captured loot for more than he loses by not carrying legitimate cargo
(or smugglers\' goods!) instead.

And again you fail to address the basic economic principle involved: Every
jump he makes where he does not make any money is another jump that the
captured loot will have to compensate for.

But the system you describe does not appear to be good enough to keep crime
down to a reasonable level. If a starship can use a false identity and then
go and capture a ship, take its cargo, and then skip to somewhere else and
be pretty safe from capture, what\'s to prevent a captain from using a false
identity, get a cargo loaded, and then skip to somewhere else and be pretty
safe from capture? If anything it seems to be a much better scam than piracy.
You cut out the whole business of hunting down and capturing another ship with
all its attendant risks and difficulties, and instead of having to take pot
luck on what cargo your victim is carrying, you can just read the cargo
manifest and wait for a particular juicy cargo to skip with. If the system
don\'t prevent piracy, how does it prevent this? And contrarywise, if it
prevents this, why does it not prevent piracy?

It\'s that business of focussing on one detail and missing the big picture
again.

I keep repeating that what I\'m talking about here is identifying the
perpetrator of a pirate attack after the fact. That means the investigator
collects the evidence, taking some months to do so. Since we are talking
about a ship that up until the moment of the attack had been doing regular
merchant business, the ship will have been registered as outbound from a
world not too far from the crime (if coming from a world with a lot of
starship activity) or been noticed by someone local (if coming from a
world with very little starship activity). Oh, maybe the pirate got
lucky and came from a world where he wasn\'t noticed, but he will have
been registered on the previous jump or the one before that.

Since checking a transponder can be done by a computer subroutine, I don\'t
think that is correct.

No, but such a pirate is not doing legitimate merchant business (or even
non-legitimate) while he is doing that.

Not every planet (just the ones with any system defenses) and not a 100%
current registry. But it dosen\'t have to be 100% current. You check the
new arrivals. Most won\'t fit the profile of the pirate. Of those that do
fit the profile, 99% are in the register. The last percent gets singled
out for attention. Why is that so hard to believe?

OK. You assume that in the Traveller universe it is easier to unkink
metal than to kink it. Fair enough. Dosen\'t contradict any canon I can
think of.

But is it enough? It is a matter of pure luck just how much the cargo is

Ah, but that is one of the things you don\'t get to drop. The level of
piracy is a matter of canon. Remember, the whole thread originally
arose because I claimed that piracy as portrayed in the CT canon did
not make sense. If you have to change the frequency of pirates from that
portrayed in CT sources in order to make piracy possible, then it does
not make sense as originally portrayed, now does it?

Simple. I check the records my agents have gathered and see that the
ship does not appear in any of them. And btw. the question should have
been how I check that a ship DID show up at its proper destination since
we are talking about eliminating ships as suspects, but the answer is
the same: Yoy check the records and see that it did show up.

>You can\'t telephone to find out.

You can do the equivalent, send an inquiry to the starport authorities
of the system or send an agent if there is no starport authority.

Sure. Why do you think I was talking in terms of man-years to track them
down? Because it can keep several investigators occupied for months.

Actually, I was talking about tracking him down months later when the
investigators have narrowed the possibilities down to a few prospects
and start tracking them down. But if you will allow me a tiny bit of
precautionary measures then _arriving_ ships can actually be checked
quite shortly after they arrive. All it takes is a routing dispatch
of starport records to all neighboring systems whenever a ship is
going in that directions.

Except that by one of your own assumptions (that pirates will propably only
take cargoes), a lot more information would be available, so why argue
about a state of affairs that one of your own basic assumptions says
won\'t occur?

Yes, but why? Because you argue about each subpoint in isolation without

I would much prefer not to argue these subthreads one by one and instead
deal with a complete concept, but I can\'t until you (or some other pro-
piracy advocate) comes up with one.

     I have been wondering; why is it possible for only type A starports to
build starships?  I could see a case being made that a class A port is the
only one with the facilities to build jump drives...but why not buy jump
drives and import them to a world with a class B port?  What other factors
might affect starship construction (besides TL obviously) ?

IMTU, I am using the CT starship construction rules (with modifications and
editions...putting it together in a document to post here soon), with HGv2 to
be used for large than 5000dt vessels.  I am thinking of having class B ports
capable of building ships up to 5000dt, and requiring A ports for anything
larger.  Feedback, perhaps?

On a related note, does anyone have any idea what the average yard capacity
(for shipbuilding purposes) a class A or B port would have?  I am running into
the problem that in my subsector, there are 2 worlds ( TL\'s D and C) with
populations of 9.  This gives them an enormous advantage over even the higher-
tech worlds, simply because of thier naval budget (using TCS).  It\'s kinda
like comparing the combat power of the US Navy to the combat power of the
Nigerian Navy :-)  I have considered  lowering the tax rate from Cr500 to
Cr100, but this hurts the smaller worlds even more.  I am thinking now that
yard capacity should be the limiting factor.  Anyone have any Real World (tm)

	Just as a real-world contribution to this, let me throw in
corrective surgery--after 20 years of near-blindness, I underwent
laser surgery (flap\'n\'zap). From being literally unable to see the
eyechart (big E is 20/400--I couldn\'t even see a grey blur), my eyes
went to 20/20 *overnight*. I\'m now somewhere around 20/15 to 20/20.

	How many people would have even thought of something like this not
too many years ago? The basic concept has been around since the \'40s,
when a surgeon was removing the front of corneas, freezing them,
placing them in a microlathe to correct the curvature, and
reattaching them. Well, I certainly wouldn\'t have even *considered*
that...

Lower TL credits are often worth less than higher TL credits. Sometimes
a lower TL ship is cheaper than a higher-TL one. It depends on a number
of factors.

It hasen\'t been defined. Those of us who have difficulty believing in
pirates think it is unreasonable to assume that they would be less
complete than those of present-day wet harbors, but there is no real
evidence one way or the other.

It is not established that the Imperium does collect taxes on ship
activities. There is some evindece to suggest that it MIGHT be the
case, but the evidence is not conclusive.

Again, this has not been defined. IMTU the Imperium base its assements
on member planets on their economic strength, charging each world a
percentage of GWP.

1% of GWP is the figure I incline to at the moment.

I don\'t think Megacorporations are taxed as such. The Emperor owns a
percentage of each corporation and gets dividends.

  I\'ve communicated with RAFM over the last couple of months, and they 
apparently no longer have any 15mm molds and very few (samples only) figures.

  The worthwhile ones are the Citadel 15mm\'s, for which both the masters and
their ownership seem to be in the hands of GW. Apparently Hobby Products GmbH
is a licensee of GW USA.

  OC, the RAFM 25mm\'s are still available from some retailers/distributors.
The only other 25mm\'s are the old Grenadier product; it\'s unclear if the new
owner of the Grenadier line (Nemo/Stratelibri) has the Trav-25 molds, or if
the original license (with GDW/FFE/Mr. Miller?) still allows production.

Paritially correct.  Its not theft.  Theft is a state crime.It more akin to piracy,
although that term is usually reserved for different contexts.

What it is:

- - Copyright Infringement.  The copyright owner of the sculpted work would
win in a federal cival case against you.

- - Potentially, Criminal Copyright Infringement.  I don\'t think so, but I\'d have to
double check.

- - Trademark Infringement.  The company that sold the product, and its subsequent
forms would win a federal trademark against you.  They may also win a state action,
depending on the states.

- - Counterfeiting.  Can be a federal crime in some cases.

BTW, even if you might win against such charges on various defense theories,
we\'re talking about US Federal Law here, which means a Federal Law lawyer,
which means a highre price.  Surely not worth it.

Don\'t do it.

Better:  make some new Cardboard Heroes (tm) - type figures.

  Yep. If, however, an L-Hyd supply gets left behind then the system is still
a strategic refuelling location, and thus a potential liability. OTOH, the
potentially very long cruising ranges of Trav ships will obviate the need for
bases like coaling stations or seaplane/recon airstrip facilities - Wake and
Midway Islands both come to mind.

  As someone else mentioned, what about the option of using lower TL kit?
Specifically, use high tech but reliable (i.e., well short of bleeding
edge) materials and techniques to construct a lower TL (but tested and
refined) design? This should produce a very nice mix of reliability and
economy at the expense of the uppermost performance levels (hmm, sounds a
bit like small personal aircraft nowadays?).

Insurance companies aren\'t into repeated significant losses, either.

  This reminds me (however vaguely) of a bit of background from one of
Cristopher Rowley\'s novels (his Vang/Starhammer universe) - an extremely
rich bad guy is threatened with being taken to court by the interstellar
government for _really_ annoying them. It doesn\'t matter if his legal team
keeps him out of jail - they can\'t keep him from being stuck in the same
city as the court for years or decades, and his influence on the world he
was on will wane without easy instantaneous commo and personal contact.

  Presumably the arrests occur while the ship is nearby. If others choose
to try and escape from the port or orbit then the result likely won\'t be
worthy of being called a shoot-out.

  Actually, I don\'t know that a fence (typically a dishonest broker or

Fine idea.  I\'m not especially enamoured of the Martian Metals\' line (I
liked the Citadel types MUCH better), but I AM committed to Traveller 15mm;
I\'d contribute just to help maintain a presence in this scale.  

Concern:  Copyright boogyman...  Has anybody looked into this?  For all
that Martian Metals is OOB, does somebody own the rights to the figs?

Question:  Has anybody thought of what figures in 15mm are needed, beyond
those available from Tabletop Games, Irregular Miniatures, Peter Pig (I
think, IIRC), Stan Johansen (Space Opera figures), and Laserburn (or are
those also Tabletop Games, I wonder?), to establish a Traveller 15mm figure
line?  

A basic figure suite would seem, to me, to include (and this matches,
strangely enough, much of what Martian Metals produced...): Aslan; Vargr;
Droyne; Hiver; K\'kree; Zhodani (at least in armor), and some miscellaneous
Aliens...  That ignores the typical Imperial types that are produced, more
or less, by the aforementioned manufacturers.

There are lots of 15mm figure makers out there - perhaps an ambitious soul
could approach one to see what it\'d cost to get some masters made and
figures produced...  The scale of cost is nowhere near what it is, say, for
a plastic model; one can obtain masters from the likes of Joel Haas
(except, I\'ve heard, he\'s not sculpting 15s anymore...) for about $75 or
so...  If a manufacturer thought he or she could sell a few of the things,
they might be willing to produce.  I\'ll be at Historicon 98 in a couple of
weeks - I\'ll ask around to get an idea of costs, if anybody\'s interested...

Perhaps. Or maybe not. You\'d need a serious motivation to replace a limb,
because it\'s going to take a long time to re-learn how to use it. One
problem often overlooked in discussions of bionics is that your brain has
developed as your body developed; if you lose a limb and replace it with a
prosthetic, you\'ve got to re-learn all kinds of basic physical tasks from
scratch. Tet a new prosthetic arm, and you have to re-learn how to tie your
shoes, to drink from a cup, to eat with a knife and fork...

Worse, the adult brain isn\'t as flexible as a young brain, so it can take a
long while to re-learn those tasks, and you\'ve no guarantee that you\'ll
*ever* regain complete mastery of the limb. You might just have to forget
that promising career as a concert pianist.

Then there\'s the interesting question as to whether the brain is even
equipped to accomodate a variety of "interchangeable, highly controllable
micromanipulators", or any other prosthetic that doesn\'t mimic the original
limb. Prosthetics can only be accomodated at all because the brain retains
a phantom limb, the neural image of the original, which \'inhabits\' the
prosthetic. Patients who completely lack a phantom limb (as sometimes
happens) find it difficult, or impossible, to operate neural-interface
prosthetic limbs. So far as the brain is concerned, there\'s no limb there
to operate.

But then, why lop off the original limb? You could just install a neural
interface that suppresses impulses to and from the original limb,
substituting input and output from a remote device - a cargo-handling
robot, say, or the micromanipulators you mentioned. Or a ship\'s weapons
bay. Or a pair of extra arms strapped to your back (shades of Dr.
Octopus!).

Still, I\'m not sure if this would work. Suppose you wire your nervous
system up to, say, a forklift; can you learn to operate it as if it were a
part of your body? I would say it\'s *possible*, because the brain *is*
incredibly flexible; but it would be a major challenge, involving months of
solid training, perhaps years. Somehow, your brain just might learn to
accomodate a robotic forklift as an integral part of your body-image.

Well, let\'s not get into this "whacking off your arm".  It is misleading
to think that way (and leads toward things like that stupid cyberpsychosis).

I do think that not everyone will want cyber limbs.  Not because of
any aversion, but because, in a technological society, things like
body strength are that crucial.

If the corporation in question was headquartered on Capital then The
Emperor could show up at the meeting in person....

If the Emperor shows up in person & makes a no confidence motion it
would be darn close to laissez majeste (sp?) for the other shareholders
to disagree.  As an effective means of making a point it has few
equals.  If the Emperor is accompanied by say a few companies of Battle
Dress euipted "bodyguards" I think _everyone_ will get the message.

mea culpa. I re-read it yesterday... OOPS! <Blush> Gotta wake up before
reading e-mail.

However, what do you call a vastly diversified, multi-sector commercial entity?

I\'d call it a mega-corp. Even if it isn\'t multi-domain.

IMTU, a mega-corp is ANY imperially liscenced, massively divesified
commercial entity, characterized by massively parallel vertical production.

IMTU, that\'s what the nobility is all about, and why they are so prevalent.
I figure a per-capita charged to the GOVERNMENT, overseen by the local
nobleman, who has to budget for the local IISS X-net office, IMOJ office,
etc, plus oversee the extrality zone, and the imperial legation office.
Imperial taxes come from per-capita, services fees, and subordinate nobles,
as well as any extrality zone fees past budget needs. Thsu the tracking of
traffic is dependant upon both the noble and the local system and the hired
help.

It wouldn\'t be the Mega-corp with 40 TCr, but a local subsidiary  hit with
BCr1-2. Besides, anything which the Big 13 do to make money makes money for
the imperial house, as that\'s who the shares go to... so the stock holdings
are part of the regalia of office, not the government per se. I figure that
the Government also gets a cut... say a flat 5% profits tax.

  Wait a second . I\'ve been supporting the "opportunistic pirate" for
some time, and I\'ll continue to do so until I\'m convinced one way or
another as to its\' viability, but at the same time I can\'t see why I
should conform to the "wandering monster table" approach to actual
pirate attack frequency. Wouldn\'t it be better to have the basis be to
explain a threat level and nature such that a CT trader would have two
turrets of weapons (because they\'re sure as hell not going to slow up
a Shiva class or equivalent raider or stop even a few det-lasers from
gutting the freighter)?

  Same hassle as running TCS in the Islands Cluster, except there the highest
TL\'s and pops and separate, and TL D vs A allows for being outnumbered ten to
one or so. OTOH, TCS Cr 500 budget is screwy (use Striker [I]), and they also
base yard capacity on population anyway.

  My suggestion would be to make the budget formula non-linear past a certain
point (500 million or 1 billion people [1x10^9] or whatever amuses you) and
then use a formula past that point to slow growth - representing a decrease
in per capita machinery, resources, and overall durable goods production.

  Is it Peter Pig who makes the "Command Decision" 15\'s? Those are decent
enough, and the 251\'s can be converted to ACV or grav suspensions easily
enough (as Scotia did for some of their micro-SF lines, apparently). I\'ve

I might detest Pudding Workshop, they do seem to have the advantage here.

I agree, but I dont want to do this - I want lower tech worlds to have some

It mightnt be that realistic, but I think it can be finessed.

I phrased the threat fairly carefully ... the flunky is saying \'Fix the
problem, or the boss might find out\'. The Emperor probably hasnt personally
dealt with the matter - all the flunky is saying is *she* believes that
this is being planned. And, as a fraud investigator at work recently said
\'And if he said it was true, he must have believed it to be true at the time\'.

I think it would be a gross violation of protocol to front to an AGM as a
shareholder with armed bodyguards, btw. I\'m sure they will get the hint
easily enough.

I shouldnt have used \'is\' I should have used \'should be\'.

Your on-planet factor and/or the flunky you sent to babysit the cargo sends
you a postcard from each port on a pre-planned route.

A variant involves setting up the message tree via Xboats while the cargo
itself goes by slower freighters.

You can tell where it should be now, within fairly tight limits. You can
definitly tell where and when it went missing, unless it\'s an inside job
with faked reports. Which isnt really piracy, although it is cheaper,
easier and more profitable.

This works, although I would do it as a percentage of GDP rather than as
per capita, otherwise poor worlds will be unable to afford their taxes.

I think the Imperium has a long-term cycle of \'use Nobles because they are
reliable, honourable and uncorruptable\' to \'use bureaucrats because they
know the job better\' back to \'use Nobles\'. A compromise is to have
bureaucrats who are also noble.

Reminds me of the Maghiz. The Darrians did not quite blow up Tarnis, but
activeted it a way too much - but the effects spread through the whole
Darrian subsector. It would be interesting how that\'s been compared to
hard numbers ... anyone?

I think we had this discussion earlier on this list. But its up to
everyone to make his own appearences. I adapted the idea of jump spcae
looking like a silverish, liquid bubble around the ship (inspired by
StarGate). Perhaps this looks also different on Aslan/Vargr/etc
Jump Drives ... or depends on the Megacorp that built it ...

The population growth rules in PE are one of the most wonderfully elegant
game mechanics I have seen.

Essentially, you add up the tech level, infrasturucture and resources of a
world  (essentially how nice a place to live it is), add the roll of a
dice, divide by the current population code minus one and then look up that
number of a table. You then multiply by a starport factor (good starports
exaggerate the effect up or down, poor starports diminishes it), and thats
your population growth factor.

It\'s one of the rules that make PE the great product it is. I\'m proud to
have built on it.

Diary of Lieutenant Shovac Mitisky, MCG and Bar

\'204-1017 Operation Ratcatcher is going well. I sold the codes to a person
who remained nameless. His particulars as I recollected them are attached
as Attachment A. The list is being forwarded to the relevant authorities -
in about six months we\'ll run through the records to see if any of them
have been used, and keep doing it at four month increments.

Attachment B is a list of all ships who docked at Treece Down, together
with identifying features.

Please give my regards to Bubbles\'

I\'d really like to see the Grenadier Traveller figures produced again--I
don\'t have the Alien Mercenary set. (Anyone got one? I\'ll pay collector
prices for it...)

If you want to play with 25mm figures, though, you should check out the
web catalog for Ground Zero Games.  They have a line of combat troops
who look reasonable Traveller-esque, and they are expanding into civilians,
ship crew and bystanders who also look good.  Obviously there are no Traveller
specific aliens, but look at their UN Space Marines--they look an awful lot
like my Grenadier Traveller Imperial Marines.

Laserburn are TTG--though I think that the figures were once produced in
the US by Ral Partha.

15mm would be good for skirmish wargaming, but I would prefer 25mm for 
roleplaying when figures are used. 

I haven\'t been doing much with Traveller lately, although I have been painting
some 25mm miniatures I\'ve had for a while with the intention of doing a bit
of science fiction gaming to vary my usual historical habit. I am intending
to use Ground Zero Games Stargrunt II rules with the 25mm figures. They are
intended to be generic, and I think that adapting them for Traveller is going
to be pretty simple. (They\'d work for 2300AD with no mods at all...)

You can find the QSDS, SSDS & the VDS (vehicle design system) at Ethan 
Henry\'s page http://www.magmacom.com/~ehenry/traveller/

There\'s a lot of software on the web for all versions of traveller.  The best 
possible way to start might be with the Traveller Webwring.  Check out:

Maybe the best "legal " way to go is to contract w/ someone to make a whole

Diary of Lieutenant Shovac Mitisky, MCG and Bar

\'204-1017 Operation Ratcatcher is going well. I sold the codes to a person
who remained nameless. His particulars as I recollected them are attached
as Attachment A. The list is being forwarded to the relevant authorities -
in about six months we\'ll run through the records to see if any of them
have been used, and keep doing it at four month increments.

Attachment B is a list of all ships who docked at Treece Down, together
with identifying features.

There are some days it just plain sucks to be a bad guy. Getting caught
in a sting operation is just one of them.

Whatever enterprising IN agent comes up with this one had better be
patient, and have a streetwise roll good enough to make it more profitable
for him to be a bad guy himself. (Duty and honor are very, very good things
to instill in your intelligence agents...how many CIA agents became
drug smugglers or freelance operatives doing bad things?)

He has to get a rack of transponder codes, for the express purpose of
releasing them into the wilds. Granted, he intends to have all of them
on a hot sheet - but whatever governing body is in charge of transponder
codes (assuming there is one) will want him to do anything else.
The average ship (or even sub-C class starport) will have to take a
transponder at face value. While there may be so many fraudulent
transponders out there that this is unwise, whoever is in charge of
transponders isn\'t about to admit it and allow a bunch of extra codes
to float around out there.

He has to find "Lefty". Just sitting around in starport bars and whispering
"hey buddy, wanna buy some new transponder codes?" will only get
him in touch with player characters. <g>

Oh, and I will give you that a starport (class E or so) that doesn\'t
forward traffic records (marked spots of bedrock may have limited
administration facilities) might be suspected as a pirate stop, and
might have an IN agent hanging around recording info for the next
courier that might (or might not) show up next week. He\'ll probably 
be a low-level agent ready to try *anything* to get promoted out
of this job...which might lead him to try the sting we\'re talking about,
even though the following is more likely to occur...

Lt. Mitisky sells his rack of bogus codes to "Lefty" in a starport bar.
What happens to them next?

"Lefty" goes and sells 90% of these codes at a discount to an
employee at a shipyard who wants to get a bunch of codes for
a tenth the usual price and pocket the difference, probably without
knowledge of the rest of the company. Instead of having to deal with
several dozen dangerous pirates, Lefty only has to deal with one
greedy clerk. Lefty thinks this is safer, though he will sell a few to
his special "Free Trader" friends. 
The codes go to ships built by legitimate small trade companies
and individual merchants, and as far as these individuals know everything
is legal and up front. They probably even have legitimate paperwork.
Two subsectors (or sectors) away, an Imperial Patrol Cruiser reads
their transponder, sees it on the hot sheet, and impounds them
until this can be figured out - which is long enough to put a small trader
crew out of business. The bank (owners of the ship) lose their property
to Imperial Seizure. The crew either goes to jail, or at least have no ship
and a several MCr debt with no ship to pay it off with. Mr. shady shipyard
employee scampered a long time ago with his several MCr take, leaving
the rest of the company to take the blame, the charges and the lawsuits.
The shipbuilding business on the planet is ruined, and the local noble
(seeing a massive loss in tax revenue) blames it all on our intrepid
Lt. Mitisky dumping those transponder codes onto the black market
in the first place. The sector office of the Imperial Navy hunts around for
a scapegoat, and Lt. Mitisky spends the rest of his career piloting a
one-man scout on the Zhodani border.

Not saying that some enterprising, promotion-hungry intelligence agent
won\'t try this - say, with a rack of codes that belong to impounded or
IN-destroyed ships - but stings like this can blow up in your face pretty
easily on Earth - not to mention how they could go wrong in a society
plagued by multi-week communication delays.

Of course, the adventure seed here is the players find out the code of thier
brand new starship is on a hot list - they have the fun of dodging Impie
navy vessels until they can get back to where they bought it, and find
the greedy bum who screwed them over. Maybe they even get to take it
a step or two farther, and hang the blame on our daring Lt. Mitisky... <g>

I downloaded this software to try it out.
It looks great.  The map generator looked
the most useful although when I tried

brought down my OS (no surprise there I\'m

Does anyone know of a working map generator

an application to help create planet maps.

ringrose@ascent.com very nicely requested I include something related
to Traveller rather than just posting the info. Good point, I\'ll try to do
that
in the future. The two reasons I post such items to the TML is to:

 1) hopefully open the floor for discussion and start a thread
which people can learn actual science from...which is exactly what
happened...and
2) hopefully make/keep someone (anyone) out there aware that although
Traveller may be "just a game" (yeah, right), we all are actually
*living* part of the technology _right now_! Traveller can be an incredible
teaching tool.

Example:  I always wondered how a high-TL world-wide communications
network that starships routinely access at a Class A/B starport could
come into being when the cost would almost always be prohibitive. Well,
you all happen to be reading this post on such a network. A network that
wasn\'t built by any government, megacorporation, or multi-billionaire.
Pretty cool, huh?

The fact that some TMLers actually are members of the scientific
community just tickles me to death. You all have posted some really
great stuff in the past which has allowed me to compile some wonderful
technical/background briefs for my TU. It\'s also helped learn alot about
physics an technology. Thank You!!!

As for the Traveller 15mm minis, I believe the manufacturer\'s address is
as follows:

Hobby Products GmbH
Postfach/P.O.Box 101020 46010 Oberhausen Germany.
Tel.: +49(208)70011

They have a website at:

http://www.luding.com/company/c0361t.html

I couldn\'t get into their website (connection refused...well!) and someone
familiar with German addressing standards may want to repost the
address the way it should be written.

Well, I\'m not quite sure who you mean, the person who offered the figures
or the first to respond to your idea of reproducing them from the
collectively purchased figures.  I think I was first to offer to pay for
such figures.  I can\'t be *the* organizer, but herein I\'ll try to get a
ball of sorts in a moving state.


Here\'s a summary of posts on this subject;

Citadel Produced some excellent 15mm figures, which seem to be owned by
Games Workshop.  Hobby Products GmbH is a licensee and may also (or
instead) have Traveller Molds

RAFM Produced Good figures, but do not have the molds anymore.

Grenadier (Now Nemo/Stratelibri) Produced 25mm figures, and may or may not
have the molds.

This is a call for volunteers.  Someone needs to contact these people.

It would be preferable if the contacting person had a prior relationship
with someone at the company.  One volunteer for each company please;

Grenadier is, indeed, out of business, but one article I found on the web
mentioned that 95% of their molds went to Italy to Stratelibri.  Now, I
don\'t speak Italian, and a call there would be relatively expensive
(especially if I had trouble communicating).  If some enterprising soul who
is at least in europe and has some command of Italian wants to contact
them, please do.

As far as copyrights goes;  We are contacting the company with the molds
first.  If this is unsuccessful we can attempt to reproduce molds from
figures, at which point the company and/or artist may need to be involved
and get a license fee.  In either case Marc will need a fee (and his fees
are reasonable - if he gives the same deal as I\'ve seen for such ventures)
and those costs can be rolled in.

In other words, we\'ll cross that river when it bars our way.

I think that reproducing molds may not be easy enough for this type of
venture.  Convincing a company to put out a limited run with
already-committed customers seems like a more likely prospect, especially
if they have cash up front to pay for the costs involved.

Hold onto your wallets everyone.

I will not be answering mail for about ten days, if anyone cares.  Anyone
who contacts the companies above should report to the list on the results.

Pete

P.S. If anyone knows what is involved in producing molds and figures I\'d be
curious to know how difficult and what quality a "basement" operation can
be/do.

I agree completely...until higher tech levels when "software dirvers" fit
with the brain\'s impulses and match the action of the artificial limb.

Well, I see this happening in a number of possible ways;

First, rather than operating the Liftbot (Big danger-yellow teleoperated
legged lifting vehicle ala Aliens) by direct limb analogy (i.e. as though
the \'bot\'s limbs were your limbs) you could operate by mentally "pushing"
the limbs into place or mentally "lifing" the manipulation arms as though
it were a plastic action figure.

Second, a holographic or video set of "controls" could be provided.  Mental
impulses move the controls and those controls move the \'bot.

The point is, its all in the software.  The computer coordinating your
brain to the teleoperated item (whether an actual limb or some external
device) takes the impulses your brain sends and translates them into
movement, then takes the movement and translates it into a change in the
kinesthetic sense, and, if applicable, feedback in the form of resitance,
touch, heat or cold, etc.

On the other hand, some people (probably the younger ones, as you point
out) are going to find that they can directly manipulate the items to be
controlled using, say, their finger circuits.

An interesting topic.

I think the primary base invention is a device that can meaningfully mimic
or generate neural impulses directly to the brain.  Once there is a
connection established to the brain which can generate sensory input and
capture instructional output we have Gison-like cyberspace.

IMTU people "plug in" at Tech 13+ to their computers.  None of this silly
voice interface stuff.  Of course, the plug must be surgically implanted,
and the ISP fees are usually quite high (to keep the riff-raff off of
course).  Also, you never know when you may run into a cyber-paranoid place
where implants are either outlawed or shunned.  Then there\'s Glisten where
your implant is as much a status symbol in some circles as laptops are now.

Your post is mostly correct, and I agree with a lot of it, but this part is
not an accurate representation.

The initial funding for the oroginal Internet "Backbone" was from defense
dollars (DARPA/ARPA) and, later, Other Government agencies (NSF, NIH,
AFOSR, DOE).  Also, Universities invested in a lot of hardware in the early
years (as they do now) providing gateways and routers and, more
importantly, a market for The Internet by getting all those smart young
students hooked on email. (Much of that money came from the Governments of
various countries, the ones that provide research grants, which directly
and indirectly were used to buy equipment).

Corporations, Billionaires, etc all make their own contributions in a
piecemeal fashion.  User fees from ISPs provide a lot of those companies
with the money to upgrade their own connectors, whose fees contribute to
upgrading the backbone hardware.

So you see, it is just those Governments, Megacorporations (or as close as
we have now) and Multi-Billionaires, plus us Billionaires to be and the
University/Research community which built the network I am using right now
to tell you all this.

to him.  Frito\'s real name was something that sounded like a
pudding Deb liked; but Deb never paid attention.  He was a
busy man.  He was in charge of Keanou Yentil Down Starport.

He was traffic control, customs, shuttle service, repair yard,
and sometimes even brokerage.  He was the bartender, the social
director, and the police.  And he didn\'t mind his job,
because he got paid for what essentially was free time with
a smidgen of what he called "customer service".  

It wasn\'t that Keanou is a dump; well, the atmosphere is a
bit nasty, and there isn\'t a lot of water.  But gravity is
a bit light, and it\'s a real quiet place mostly.  Perfect 
for retirement, Deb thought.  He watched Frito jog back to
the diminutive Scout base, a tiny affair without even a
parkbay.  It did have its own landing pad, though, and the
lone Courier ship was just leaving.  For another month, it
would be just Frito and Deb; after that, maybe Frito would
get that transfer he always wanted: "To Hefry, the Scout
Capital of this Quadrant!"  Deb didn\'t know that people
talked like that; "Quadrant" sounded like Solomani terrorist
language to him.

There was no regular trade routes running through Keanou:
Inthe was only one parsec away, but the system\'s miniscule
population removed any hope of contracts.  But they had a
nice starport.  It was tiny, true, but it was still nice.

Deb watched the beacon telltale that had begun flashing.
"A ship", Deb\'s autonomic nervous system seemed to bark out,
as he bolted upstairs to the observatory.  Just a spark of 
light, but the ship was approaching nonetheless.  The beacon
would even now be scrawling obscure analog glyphs through
the recording surface onto nothing.  Deb had forgotten to 
reset the receiving device after the last purge.  Stupid
Vilani black boxes, thought Deb.  Why have separate control
systems for mutually dependent parts?  He had complained
once to a visiting knight, who assured him that all would be
taken care of in due time.  "There ain\'t no more true
gunslingers no more", thought Deb.  "Are there?"

He then went to the control tower, sat down to wait (he had
the patience of Job), and opened the packet Frito had brought
over from the Courier.  There were lists of suspected 
criminals, and associated marked transponder codes.  Deb 
transferred a bunch of work from his "In" box to his "Out"
box, then set the new information in the now-emptier "In" box.
He\'d worry about them later.

The ship sailed in gracefully and set down on the lone airstrip.
There were no public parkbays, since traffic was so light,
so the ship just worked into a corner of the pad at the strip\'s
end and powered down.  Deb scooted out in a general-purpose
open-top wheeled internal combustion vehicle. 

The crew looked like free traders, a bit rumpled but alert.
One wearing captain\'s colors tromped out, a bushy, slightly
graying beard leading the way.  He stuck his hand out in a 
human gesture of friendship.

Deb and he spoke while the man\'s crew bought beer.  After
awhile Deb leased them the cargolifter to do some exchanges.
They had stuff Keanou could use, and Deb had some, erm, 
materials that he found difficult to rid himself of.  Both he
and the captain were very pleased.  Deb found that man to be
charming and personable, polite and a fair trader.  He never
wondered about the cargo; he figured it was probably stolen.
But the markets in Keanou didn\'t ask questions; for some goods
they were desperate, and would absorb them as quickly as they
came in without knowing where they came from.

Before they left, Deb suggested to the captain that when he
was fixing some minor problems on their ship he found some
errors in his transponder programs.  The captain understood
at once and thanked him.  And then they left.  Deb figured
he wouldn\'t see the pirate again.


Meanwhile, Sunbeard the Pirate was switching to his alternate 
strategy.  He had plenty of emergency plans: no pirate could 
survive without them.  In the meantime he could use transponder 
codes to play cat-and-mouse, but he shouldn\'t use them too much
until he could find another pirate to swap portions of the
list with.  For more marked codes, he thought.  He wondered
how many marked codes he had, in off-line storage.

Well, no matter.  He now had a very illegal shipment of
groat tonsils to give to the nice (though superstitious)
Patrolman at Dinomn.

    'body' => 'We\'re not murderers. Maybe Captain Kinzarid turned into one, but the
rest of us, we were just people doing our jobs...soldiers who ran out of
war, from a planet that wasn\'t ours anymore.

We were the proud crew of a Wespirran-class Patrol Cruiser, part of the
planetary navy of Colchis. A whole arm of trading partners had no navy
to speak of, little more than marked spots of bedrock to land the cargo
shuttles on - so we ran circuits through these worlds, showing a flag
and playing beat cop in the lawless outer systems of these backwater
worlds.

We met with a sister ship, the Acensa Kaldiz, at the Mankenna 
fuelling station. Her captain told us what had happened on Colchis,
and we didn\'t believe it. A coup? A bunch of lunatic fringe insurgents
in charge? We\'d been on cruise for a month or so, it seemed impossible
that so much could have gone so wrong in so short a time.

Then the courier showed up from Colchis with our new orders, stamped
"By Order of the Supreme Colchis Technarch Council". That\'s when we
started believing.

We had family on Colchis, though none close to us - the Colchis Patrol
Service tends to become your family, what with the year-plus rotations
to the Sector Navy Auxialiary Escort program. We also knew that we
had nowhere to turn - as long as these "Technarchs" paid their Impie
taxes, those damned Impies wouldn\'t care how many free citizens of
Colchis had their property "Optimized" or their lives "Efficiently Directed".

Colchis lost some of her interstellar navy that day. We met some of the
other crews, some joined us, some shot at us - but most of us decided
that it was time for the Technarchs to hurt. We couldn\'t go back to
Colchis system, the couple of Dragon-class SDB\'s they kept would make
scrap out of us - but we could snipe at any cargo moving through Colchis
Subsector, cut their little technocracy off at the knees. Ever try to fulfill
promises of an Air/Raft in every garage when someone is nailing
your grav module cargos?

We\'d worked blockade with the Impie Navy on our force rotation training
cruises. We were used to keeping our Cruiser running on ingenuity and
grob-nabble chewgum. We knew every workshack and fabrication plant
all up and down the backwaters, and most of them had about as much 
use for the new Technarch Highlords of Colchis as we did. For a time,
we were the bane of merchanters in the subsector. Ships that were too
big, or had powerful enough drives to jump straight from Hamovar to
Colchis, we left alone - but the tradesmen that had to go through the
hinterworlds to get to Colchis were often as not ours for the taking.

We even found a pipeline out of the subsector for goods, so we could not
only hurt Colchis but also start gathering the funds to organize a little
coup of our own. And that, as the saying goes, is where things started
getting out of control.

I think the first time Kinzarid saw a pile of credits on the table - when
Sahin, that Free Trader from Jihael bought a cargo of computer parts
from us. He paid us a fraction of what they were worth, but still the
Captain looked at that pile of credits with a startled expression - like
it had never occurred to him before that moment that any part of our
gallant crusade could involve him sitting in front of a pile of credits, more
than he had ever seen in one place before. That was the beginning of
the end, I think. It hurts to see noble aspirations turn to thoughts of
credits, especially when those piles of credits are so few and far between.

You know the rest. How the formal requests from the Right Technarchic
Assembly of Colchis for Imperial assistance in the control of piracy
was answered by a flotilla of Impie fleet Destroyer-Escorts - 
Fuer-de-Lances were they, or Chrysanthemums? Something like that.
We could outrun or outfight any of the piecemeal starmerc ships that
Colchis hired to police the lanes, but when the ships with the starburst
logo started making themselves known we were out of luck and on the
run. 

Our ship and ourselves were marked men and forfiet to Impie law by then.
Sahin came through for us again, his underworld contacts getting us
some transponder gear and spoof rigs that might let us pass, and got
us out of Colchis subsector. We\'re on the fringe now, a step ahead of
the law and taking what we can, trusting to the Captain\'s instincts to 
fly us out of harm\'s way and into fat traders with cargo we can use.
We have to move every couple of months, and our Cruiser is slowly
turning from a clean-lined ship of a respectable navy into a rag-tag,
field-expedited raider. The crew is changing as well, and we are no longer
the men who dreamed of a free Colchis. Except at night, when I awake
from a dream of sailing her seas, with my Noralle beside me, with stars
overhead that twinkle instead of stare coldly into my soul. He\'s probably
dead by now, as my Colchis is dead to me. I won\'t see it again, 
except in my dreams...


Author\'s notes: Just some ideas on wheres and whys of piracy. "Colchis"
is a world in a backwater subsector, at the end of a trade link from a
planet called "Hammovar". Colchis is very important to it\'s inhabitants,
and almost irrelevant to the Imperium. The string of backwater worlds
that trade with Colchis are even less relevant. Colchis maintained a
small system defense force, and a flotilla of jump-capable patrol craft.
These patrol cruisers would perform peacekeeping and patrol duties
in the other systems, rotating back to Colchis instead of being based
at these lesser worlds - Colchis wanted it very clear where the patrols
were coming from, and had no interest in letting these hinterworlds
forget that they owed their well-being to good trade relations with Colchis.

That\'s looking at it the wrong way round. A starport gets a Class A rating
if it is capable of building starships. Therefore only Class A starports
are able to build starships, because if a Class B starport was able to
build starships, it wouldn\'t be a Class B but a Class A.

That said, the rules on the subject are contradictory. TCS does forbid
worlds without a Class A starport from building starships, but there is
a rule somewhere (Book 2, I think) to the effect that planetary
governments can build starships at their own TL even without an A port
(they can also have them built at any starport in the same subsector at
no extra cost).

IMTU starport classification is a purely civilian phenomenon. If a civilian
can order a starship and have it constructed in the normal time, the
starport is Class A (That is, provided the other requirements of a Class A
starport is likewise met). That means that a starport with shipyards
completely booked up for years ahead gets a temporary drop in classification
(I\'ve used this in several cases to explain high-tech, high-population worlds
with low-class starports).

>I could see a case being made that a class A port is the

IMO that would change the Class B port in question to a Class A.

What I think is needed is an "Extended Starport Profile" showing its various
capacities (so many passengers/week, so much cargo/week, this tonnage repair
capacity, that tonnage boat construction, that tonnage ship construction, etc.)
  
>On a related note, does anyone have any idea what the average yard capacity
>(for shipbuilding purposes) a class A or B port would have?

By TCS rules it is 1 T per 1000 inhabitants of the planet. IMO this figure
is for military capacity only and civilian capacity (as well as both military
and civilian maintenance) is in addition to that, but that\'s debatable.

>I am running into the problem that in my subsector, there are 2 worlds

Well, if you are using _High Guard_ ships and combat then a TL 15 fleet
should be at roughly a 5-to-1 advantage against a TL 13 fleet and at a
20-to-1 against a TL 12 fleet (assuming proper design on both sides). A
TL 14 fleet is at 3-to-2 against TL 13 and 10-t0-2 against TL 12, so if
they have a population level of 8 they might be able to hold their own.
Still, you are perfectly right. High-population planets dominate. That\'s
just a fact of life in the Traveller universe.

The formula I use is dividing by log (population) - 7 for populations above
100,000,000. That will give you 1/2 the normal budget for a planet with one
billion inhabitants and 1/4 for one with 10 billion. Note that high-population
planets are still more powerful than those with lower populations, just not
proportionally so.

What Peter said, and this:

Most of the wires this all travels on were put up mainly by government
authorized monopolies, often subsidised heavily...telcom networks the
world over represent trillions and trillions of dollars of investments
over a century of building; in the US that was, until the breakup of Ma
Bell, a single monopoly with legislated tariff structures. 

In the beginning, this prevented a standards problem with the telephone
that had plagued another great network of the 19th century, the
construction of the rail network, where there were different standards
on every railway, preventing efficient integration of the whole into an
efficient transportation network.

Some indication of the potential problems have been seen on the Internet
here in the US, where often the largest bottlenecks are between the big
trunk providers, between Sprint, UUNet, MCI and the others, because
their routers often speak different languages, and jammed up talking to
each other. That this is happening during exponential growth in traffic
doesn\'t help, either.

Now of course, what with the Telcom Act of \'96, the baby Bells and ATT
are slowly coming together like the rolling blobs of T2000 in Terminator
2, but that\'s off topic.

Granted, were the worlds telcom net wiped out and had to be rebuilt from
scratch we could do it cheaper, but there would still be a significant
amount of governmental subsidy to ensure universal access in most
countries.

Cheap, efficient, and reliable communications infrastructure is going to
be even more important in the 3I than it is now, and so governments are
going to have a big stake in what\'s done, again that ensuring access is
as universal as possible. Granted _interstellar_ commo is relegated to
the speed of travel, but the rest of the system is hardly on the 19th
century model.

Hmmmmmmmmmmm...

Class B\'s are capable of *repairing* starships.  I\'d say, replacing jump 
drives would be a repair function, & therefore legal...

Absolutely.  I think the Judges Guild\'s 50 Starbases had this kind of

This is a liveable number, I think.  But what about the TL 16 planets with 2 
or 3 inhabitants boasting an A starport?

Oh, hell no! Robots are valuable and hard to replace! That\'s why
Universities prefer Grad Students, even though they do messy,
inefficient things like sleep once a week,eat occasionally, attempt to
have lives, and expect to get a degree when they graduate...;-)

When I was back at university ( mech enh course back in 95) I did a course
in digital and analogue control. In it, we had a guest lecturer (IIRC from
the Oxford Radcliffe hospital in the UK). He was demonstrating the work
that they were doing on prosthetic limbs for accident victims.

They had done a lot of work quantifying the signals sent out by the brain
to control muscles, and tailoring the response of the limb to such
responses. At the stage that they were, each limb was uniquely built and
tailored for the user.

One of the big areas they were discussing looking into was the fitting of
sensors for feedback to the nervous system. They seemed to think that was
the next big challenge.

The really scary thing was when they demonstrated the control system on me
by wiring up some contacts on the nerve centre of my arm and then
proceeding to totally overide my control of my arm. It was quite frightning
not being able to control my movement myself.

I suspect that the work must have progressed further now...

I use a metaphor of the Earth, or of America, for understanding TL. The USA
has a TL of N (meaning some unknown number in this case rather than 21). Does
that mean that every other place on Earth has the same TL N, or is that TL
lower because of difficulties of transferring TL to other locations?

The armaments of the Mexican army are probably not at TL N, rather at TL N-1
or N-2 or ever lower. Why is this? I suppose primarily because of economics...
costs involved in, maintenance, and whatever. Recently, the USA gave Mexico a
fleet of TL N-2 helicopters (which the US doesn\'t need anymore). Mexico has
none of them flying however, because they don\'t have the maintenance crews to
keep them up (and perhaps don\'t want to spend the money to do so).

Similarly, there are places on Earth where local TL is 1 or 0 (primitive
tribes in the Amazon?). You could, I suppose, spend a lot of money and upgrade
them to TL N, but (1) there is little economic purpose/benefit in doing that,
and (2) it would require importing a support structure that would cost a lot
of money.

Right now, there aren\'t even cell phones in the Amazon... because there isn\'t
an economic purpose. But, if you discovered oil deep in the Amazon, I\'m sure
someone would set up a cell phone network. However, would the natives be able
to make use of those cell phones? The would if they all got hired as oil rig
workers and started getting incomes, but the ones who weren\'t hired (lack of
education, social skills, and whatever else) would hardly have access to the
high tech stuff that gets imported.

To recap... the restrictions on TL are based on economics. If you want to
carry a full high tech set of equipment to some other world, you certainly
can. But local tech level restrictions (not legal, but economic) mean that the
local economy can\'t build high tech stuff. If you wanted to, you could come in
and build a factory to make high tech stuff and then sell it to the locals
(whether you make a profit depends on what the locals have to spend). Worlds
with great exploitable resources have a potential for higher TL because they
can get the money to upgrade. Poor worlds probably don\'t.

I can look, but afaik hobby products print run was over a couple of years ago.
today the old miniatures are hard to find in german stores as well.

Another thing that differentiates an A class from a B class starport is
that an A class can build hulls with the lanthanum grid in them, which is a
primary component of the jump drive.  B class starports can\'t.

Yes, they did produce some very nice figs.
Yes, they still are in business.
But, as I recall they have discontinued that line.

This is one of the great dilemnas of intelligence - you want people shifty
enough to be good at their jobs, but honest enough to always be on your
side ... actually, it smells far more like an IISS plan, rather than like a

Sounds like a great job for PCs ... \'Welcome to Treece. Your mission,
should you choose to accept it (*) involves trying to penetrate the pirate
bands that K division have assured us are here\'

(*) Not accepting the mission involves facing the tender mercies of the
Imperial Navy Adjutant-General over certain unspecified but serious charges.

Hmmmm. Not impossible, but I\'d say it\'s more likely that it\'s the starport
owner or manager who could pull this off - at the least, you\'d need a
forged receipt from BuStarships, or whoever it is that issues transponder
codes, and some way of switching funds from the \'Pay BuStarships\' account
to the \'Pay Me\' account.

The alternative would be for the Navy to offer the suspects His Magesty\'s
Hospitality while the Navy finds another crew (who pass positive vetting)
to mind the ship. Heck, it makes sense to draft the ship into the Imperial
Reserve pending judgement - the crew still have title to it, until the
story is sorted out and they are either released or charged.

If the story comes up OK (and this is a case where the ship\'s books and
starport records are your friend as a suspect - if the records indicate
you\'re clean, then you should be OK), then you get the ship back.

If it doesnt, well you might end up charged as pirates, or as whatever else
comes up.

Depends if it is an actual on-orders operation, or something dreamed up by
some rogue lieutenant.

The point also got raised earlier by ?Bloo? that banks would be far more
paranoid about skipping and such than many people seem to think - and
skipping is the easiest form of piracy, seeing how you already have the
ship\'s crew on side.

Why didnt Deb pass the list onto Sunbeard in exchange for appropriate
compensation ?

If Deb is not happy with a permanent retirement, he may want to pass a
report up the line about Sunbeard. I\'d assume that the bits of the IN or
IISS who deal with suppressing piracy would be inclined to reward or
promote people who helped crack pirate rings.

Wouldnt this drop the other pirate in the poo ? While this is fine for

I\'ll bite. Why not sell the ship, and use that to fund the Revolution, or
sign on as a mercenary cruiser, and use the funds so raised to fund the
good fight ?

I\'d need to go through the detail on the Rules of War, but I\'d imagine the
hands-off Imperial attitude to planetary governments also applies to a
hands-off attitude to off-world rebels.

I imagine it as something like Australia\'s position to fundraising for
rebels, secessionists and the like. Essentially, if there are two ethnic or
political groups slugging it out somewhere, there are people on both sides
in Australia. Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, Macedonians, Greeks, Turks,
Russians, Uzbeks, Timorese, Indonesians, Tamils, Sri Lankans ... we\'ve got
the lot. From memory, there have been three cases of politically motivated
violence in Australia - but everyone raises money here, and sends it home,
or to Switzerland or wherever for forwarding to the fighters. Similarly, if
you have thirty blokes who want to fight the good fight, thats OK too
(there have apparently been planes to the former Yugoslavia carrying
volunteers for all sides simultaneously). But you dont do the actual
fighting here. You go home to do that.

This, for me, fits with the Imperium\'s acceptance of diversity, and their
hands-off attitude to local affairs.

But class B starports can build non starships of any size.  Including
those which are carried in extenal mounts by their parent ship.  Now
maybe the 10 ton launch carried in an external grapple by the 390 ton
Fat trader fits within the traders jump field but what about a 20,000
ton battle rider carried by a huge tender.  Shouldn\'t this ship need a
lanthanum hull grid.  Yet a type B port can build one.  IMNHO a type a
port must be capable of installing the zucchi crystals or some other
techno babble answer, but a type B starport is perfectly capable of
ensuring that the hull grid has the right ammount of lanthanum in it. 
It seems to me that all you really need to lay the lanthanum grid
properly is the ability to melt lanthanum in the first place & maybe
some primitive means of anlyzing the output, I would say you could do
this without much of a problem at, or maybe before, TL 5.

Strephon\'s assasination arrive in Shiwonee (Massilia J, Geonee

	a) Ripples through the Imperium, in The Rebellion Sourcebook, lists 
a Ripple dated 258.1116 going through subsector N, so the date for 
Shiwonee should be around one or two weeks before, lets say around 
240.1116

	b) Xboat routed for Massilia, appered in TD 16 (?) and in Kngihtfall 
(here, some were severed due to the split of the sector between Li 
and Ma) shows that the only way to go from Shiwonee to Core sector is 
a long detour to subsector D, numbering 14 jumps. Then, there are no 
canon (AFAIK) Xboat routes for Core sector, but an optimistic 
estimate looking at the map would give around 10 jumps from that 
point (Massilia D) to Capital. This yields 24 jumps, i.e. 24x7=176 
days. Added to 136.1116, the ETA for Shiwonee would be  312.1116

	This is a difference of more than 70 days (10 jumps), and it could 
have important effects on a campaign.

	A note is that the Xboat routes for Massilia are somewhat strange. 
Even before 1116, in subsector B, there are THREE loose ends, without 
connection between them.

	What do you people think? Help!

Hate to break the news to you but the Internet exists because of the US
government. The Department of Defense\'s Advanced Research Projects
Agency (ARPA) set out to create a communications network that could
survive a nuclear strike by routing around damaged nodes. 

That was the ARPAnet, which was the beginnings of the Internet. It was
still a significant portion of the Internet not all that long ago.

The ARPANET connected various universities that had research contracts
with ARPA. And then the universities set it up to connect with other
universites and companies they worked with.

At this point some of the colleges allowed friends to link their
systems to the net. By the early 80s (back when I first got on the net)
personal sites were actually getting to be not all that unusual. 

I could go on, but the basic fact remains that without a *lot* of
government and corporation effort we *wouldn\'t* have the net as we know
it.

Because there is a difference from saying "I know you\'re up 
to something and could you please go away" and "I know 
you\'re up to something, and I\'m prepared to give you 
blackmail leverage against me by offering to sell imperial 
data". I know police that look disgusted at dope smokers, 
and suggest that they "not be seen with it around here" 
without actually busting them. It doesn\'t mean they 
approve, just that the hassle factor of trying to do 
something about it is greater than is worthwhile to the 
Cop.

But If Debs in in the IISS - they don\'t have ranks 
(according to the LBB and the T4 book) - how do 
you get promoted? Do you get shifted to a more important 
planet? Or get given a Scout/Courier when you leave so they 
can drag you back into the reserves next time there is a 
shooting war?

Besides, there was two scouts and a bunch of (probable) 
pirates. Debs gives them some excuse to believe that he 
suspects they\'re dodgy, but not enough to believe that Debs 
will dob them in (in a month or two when the courier gets 
back) so they don\'t need to torch the "scout base" to cover 
their tracks. 

(When you\'re a long way from backup, you don\'t necessarily 
make a big deal about somethings.)

I\'m not exactly sure I can buy into that arguement either.  I kind of see it
like this:

I am using a computer that I put together myself.  I "built" it from purchased
components.  I assembled it, but I did  not MANUFACTURE it;  I don\'t have a
clue how computers actually work...but I can put one together with parts that
someone who DOES know how manufactured.  I see jump drives as being the same
way.

I agree.  The table in CT gives something like a 5% chance per jump.
that means a merchant could expect to get attacked by a pirate once
per year, which I regard as way too high.  However, I see the
table as more of a _PC_ encounter table, not a statement of
the actualy frequency of piracy.  My assumption has always been
that (with the exception of turbulent times, commerce raiding,
Vargr incursions, etc.) a merchant will likely go his entire
career without being attacked.  Assuming a 40 year career and
25 jumps per year, that is at most a 0.1% chance.

 You are right RAFM owns the only masters of these figures, but I\'ve been here
since 1989 and at that time we were no longer producing the line for some
years.
Since you are talking about a sizeable order we could not possibly produce
them
for you in a legal manner as we are not licensed to do so. Plus we would have
to
search through our archives to find those moulds which would add some cost to
the
price of the packages.  I\'m sorry we cannot provide you with the miniatures
that
you desire at this time. Possibly in the future these fine miniatures will
once
again be available but for now we can\'t be of assistance. You may post this to
the
news group.

You\'ll also note that Deb had "forgotten" to reset the receiving
device, so that transponder signals were being received, but not
recorded...a most beneficial "oops" for a system that was off the
beaten path and needed most anything *anybody* cared to deliver.

Oh, and Deb, wasn\'t described as a Scout, that was Frito.  Deb was
probably just a local who was looking out for local interests.

Anyway, whether things would or wouldn\'t work like this IYTU is less
important than the wonderful adventure hooks stories like this provide
for everybody.  Can\'t you see setting your "legit" merchants down on a
world like Keanou Yentil, or having your scouts ordered to transport a
replacement for Frito there, or any of a dozen other things?

That\'s how I see it. IMTU...

"A" ports are where shipyards that routinely build starships and
non-starships exist, and *usually* facilities exist locally to
manufacture all the components needed.  In some cases, the components
are imported from elsewhere, but even so the locals have experience
designing and building starships.  This is where you would expect to
find new Stock starships (20% discount) for sale, and higher-quality
used starship lots.

"B" ports are where there are yards that routinely build
non-starships, but don\'t *routinely* build starships.  Components to
repair or upgrade starships are usually available, generally as
imports, but designing or building a starship isn\'t a normal function
of the local yards.  They can build you one from their stock of
components...usually, but it will take longer and cost more than at an
"A" yard.  You would probably be limited to a few, older, very common
ship designs, and you\'d still have to pay custom rates. Here you can
find lower-quality used starship lots.

"C" ports have repair facilities, at least for *most* things on a
starship, but usually there aren\'t local yards that build spaceships.
That isn\'t universally true, but local yards at "C" ports are pretty
rare, and limited to building a few small spaceships.  It\'s possible
that if several non-functional ships were available they could be
cannibalized to refit one working starship, but it would be a
staggering task for a typical "C" type port.  Finding any kind of
starship available for sale around a "C" port would be a true rarity.

Weird!  I know for a fact that RAFM once also produced the old Citadel 15mm
Traveller line because I placed a hefty order for the things from RAFM in
1988.  They told me then that I should order all I was likely ever to need
because the figures were not in production & that they were shipping from
warehouse stock.  I\'m looking at a bag of \'em right now - Stiker Set #11
_Terrorist/Guerilla Unit_, and the card says _Citadel 15mm_ and also bears
the RAFM sword logo with _RAFM_ below...  

Is it possible, Mr. Shaik refers, unknowingly, to the Citadel range and NOT
the Martian Metals\' range (as they were out of production long before he
got there and, after all, both ranges WERE 15mm Traveller types!)?  I hope
not, as I\'d REALLY like to see the stuff produced, but that\'s what I fear...

I saw it and thought it an excellent movie. What few glitches along
the way in no way detracted from the exciting and engaging plot.
 The outcome was of course not an issue, but the movie was nonetheless
very enjoyable.

The reviews I\'ve read appear to have been written by people who hate
action movies, and whenever they pan a movie I\'ve found those are the
ones I enjoy the most.

   I bounced this supernova thing off a friend of mine (happens to be in
nuclear physics as well as being a fellow Traveller) and attach his reply for
comment and discussion: 

Although I\'m not sure what the "lethal range" of a supernova is, it will be
a function of its initial mass and possible the proportion of nuclear
catalyst such as carbon (the last bit tends to be speculative). If lethal
means total planetary sterilization, then are talking about events that
will turn the surface into a magma sea. In this case the distances you have
quoted are likely to be over estimated by a factor of at least 100 if not
more. If your talking about an event that will kill everything down to ten
meters in the earth then we are likely talking about an overestimation of
about 10 fold. If your talking about a dose of 400 rads (the typical LD50
for mammals and interpreted by most people as the lethal dose) to
organisms in the open air at high altitudes, then I might believe those
figures. In any case, the radiative pulse from a supernova is very quick,
i.e., about four hours, and thus only half the planet will be irradiated.
If you take into account atmospheric scatter, sky shine, then about 2/3
will get nailed. The important point is that a significant fraction of the
biosphere would survive. It would require two supernovae to reduce a
planets biosphere back down to bacteria only and that is if you don\'t count
the oasis of life around deep sea hydro thermal vents.

As to Travelers, I suspect that the imperium has had to deal with the
problem of supernovae at least once. I think it would be a pretty sticky
situation where people would know that a supernova was possible in their
sector but its likelihood was one in a thousand. Then the star begins a
process that people realize will end in a supernova in just a few years or
months. Would wars break out to possess the deepest mines or the best
tunneling equipment? Hmmm... sounds like a scenario could be built from
this.

subject has renewned my trust in the posibility of decent figures being made
availble once more.  I would like to focus on the 25mm front.  If my history
is correct, just as GDW was implodeing.  Rafm had released a number of
Traveller New Era products.  They released ships and some figure blisters.
Marines, Aslan Mercs. Robots, Grav bike and Techs, These are still availble..
However, they were just releasing some addtion  figures.  

The planed figures were:
5850 Coalition/ship crew
5851 Traders and Merchants
5854 Mercenaries-Traveller
5855 Nobles- Traveller
5856 Scouts/Surveyors- Traveller
5857 Planetary Grenadiers - Traveller
5861 Coalition Landing Party- Traveller

I will get to the point.  I called Rafm\'s  800 number and they said that these
were produced, but were mail order only because of the demise of GDW.  The bad
news is that figures are out of production and sold out.  However, according
to the woman on the phone they still had the molds and were looking to buy the
license for a production run. 

With the death of Imperium this process must be even more convoluted.  There
is a market for Sci-Fi figures. So, why can\'t we get any?  Old Greniadier
Traveller boxed set are going for a premium, so let apply some market pressure
and get urge Marc Miller to license some figures from Rafm or PArtha or
Reaper.  

I know that there are substitues, Stone Mountain, Table Top Miniatures, Ral
PArtha, Fading Suns, and some more I can think of.  I want normal figures.  No
spiked hair or huge guns.  I know there is someone reading this and shaking
there head in disblief at my quest for relative normality.  But how many Han
Solo figures can you have on the gaming table at one.  Blue Han run and Red
Han shoots. Its a nightmare. 

 I have had a player and a chat room debator  frothing at mouth declearing
normality of fading suns figs.  If you want to play a 250 pound, S&M gimp with
nipple rings, go for it, just don\'t be surprised when "BO" calls you sweetie
and has you squeal like a pig.   I\'m a Role Player, but I have my limits.

We need 25mm figs that are supported by the Traveller, with GURPS coming out
and the eventual release of a More Sci-Fi games.  It should be easy to produce
normal 25mm figs and have them sell.

Yes, white-collar crime is a wonderful thing. What I envisioned was a
minor clerk (or perhaps underpaid computer operator) who had enough
access to enter a list of transponder codes into the "cleared for use"
list wherever transponders are activated. I saw this as happening at
the shipyard (considering how integral to the ship a transponder is,
by some descriptions on the TML), but I suppose transponder encoding
and activation could be the last step of a Starship New-Build Certification
procedure that an Imperial inspector performs at the nearest starport.
The greedy clerk adds the codes to the list, and debits the operating
fund of the shipyard the expected amount to cover the new transponder
codes. He redirected the money to himself, shared some with "Lefty",
and skipped planet before an audit could turn up the screwy paper trail.
Move the identity of the bad guy up the ladder until you have someone
with the access/authority to do this, but realize that for every Vice
President there are a dozen assistants who can probably forge his
signature and read his email.

While the "rogue lieutenant" idea provides a nice closure point for a

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Captain Kinzarid here, I\'ll answer this dirtfoot.

Why didn\'t we sell Wespirr Miranta? We could trust no one, and you want
us to trade our only warship in for a pile of credits? With the Miranta we
had a base of operations, and a weapon with which to strike back at
those upstart Technarchs. Not to mention that as far as those Impie
devils were concerned, we were flying stolen property - owned by the
Supreme Colchis Technarch Council, all right and legal, complete with
requests for notification and return of stolen property. Our first show
in a port where we could sell her, or our first attempt to get a Starmerc
license, and we\'d probably lose our ship to the repo men...or have to
leave their blood on the soil of some Impie port.

I can see how these Technarchs got this coup to work - they were
cunning, attended to details. The Families had gotten soft in the wake
of their successes in assuring the peaceful future of Colchis. What did
they do with my family\'s estate, I wonder? Turn it into farmland? 
Divide my father\'s lands up among the underclass?

I\'m a starship captain, of a warship - maybe not a fancy Battleship or
Strike Cruiser, but a warship just the same. They took my estate, my
career, even my world away from me - but by my blood and name, 
they\'ll not take this away from me as well.


Author\'s note: the "rebels" aren\'t always the good guys. Looks
like Colchis was a self-perpetuating oligarchy which got overthrown
by a popular uprising, and some scions of the old upper class
were off-world when it happened - perhaps only the rich and powerful
of Colchis could get their sons and daughters the appointments to the
Interstellar Flotilla. When the revolution came, these few hundred people
and twenty ships or so had, literally, nowhere to go. Their fortunes
(both on-planet and off) were seized, they went from being wealthy
sons of priveledge playing at navy officers to being penniless, bitter
paupers with nothing but a handful of stolen patrol ship and a hatred
of the new rulers of Colchis. And once their arrogance lead them to
run their own private war against Colchis, with interstellar spacelanes
as their battlefield, it was only a matter of time before they attracted the
attention of the Imperium.

Their little flotilla ws scattered, they were no dissidents or legitimate
Colchis Government-in-Exile - they were Pirates. By the time ships with
the IN Starburst ran sweeps through Colchis subsector, the last remnants
of the old Colchis ruling class were marked men who would be hunted
for the rest of their lives. In chunks large and small, these men who once
had a world at their feet lost everything that was ever important to them.
In the process, their bitterness spread from the Technarchs of Colchis
to the Imperium that they feel abandoned them.

Perhaps, by the time the fuel of bitter hatred runs out, they will have
found a way to survive in the frontiers of known space, or even to
prosper. Most of them will be dead by then, their ships lying broken
in salvage yards throughout the Sector...those that weren\'t smashed
to unrecoverable junk.

One source of pirates, the losers of a war. Another source can be
the unwanted warships that belong to the victor...

I\'ve got to agree with this whole heartedly.  For God\'s Sake people!  Lighten
up!  go and watch it to be entertained.  If you want to critique something, pull

I\'d think that the licensing fees for this stuff should be paid to Far Future 
Enterprises or whatever holding company Marc chooses to set up.  Seems to me, 
this would help Marc pay his bills.  Have any miniatures manufacturers

There\'s a market for this stuff, as the recent offering of Letters of Marque 
showed.  And I have *ZERO* problem with Marc making money, too.  Keeping him 
alive means we\'ll eventually see more Traveller stuff in the future.  <grin>

I, for one, would be interested in 25mm figures for Striker (the *OLD* version, dammit!!!), since my current roomie is a wargaming buff just *DYING* to get introduced to the sand table.  <evil grin>  

Personally, I could care less *what* is being released for GURPS.  Played it once, didn\'t care for it.  A \'Swiss Army ruleset\' isn\'t my thing.  And I consider G:T to be more of a \'missionary tract\' than Traveller per se.

Even on-orders ops get blown.  And you can bet yer last credit that if it is, 
the Secretary will disavow any knowledge, etc, etc, etc.  That\'s how things 
work out here in the real world.

They might not have cashiered him.  They *might* have just invited him to work for ONI \'off the books\'.  <grin>  It\'s been done before, I know...

Well, to begin with there were probably less than twenty of them.
Not a lot to start a colony with. And many of them had a mad on
against these upstart usurpers, wanted to hurt them *now* instead
of 100 years from now. 

Some people would call the stereotypical "pirate base" (a hollowed
asteroid nobody knows about) a "government in exile not subject
to the Imperium". At least until an Imperial patrol finds it...

How big is the boat, anyways?  And wouldn\'t the dethroned gov pull a Marcos & 
head out of town quick with the treasury, or as much as they could get their 
hands on?  And what of their interstellar neighbors, who the Old Regime has 
been trading with since way the hell back when *before* there was an Imperium 
raking off all those tax credits that could be put to better use restoring 
palaces^H^H^H^Hhistorical landmarks?  Those people knew who was running things 
before the People\'s Revolution, and probably want their money back that\'s 
still out in loans.  Odds are, the Techarchy isn\'t going to get much support 
from *them* unless the money keeps on coming.

I find the concept that only *one* Loyalist ship would desert to be a bit 
weak. After all, if I was running an oligarchy, I\'d make sure the whole damned 
*Fleet* was officered by sons & daughters of loyal Party members, thus having 
a vested interest in keeping the status quo.

And a couple million credits from a couple of Colchis\' miniscule fleet of 
subbies taken over by the Loyalist Fleet would go a long ways toward financing 
an Ine Givar-style terrorist organisation against the Techarchs.  Considering 
the Old Regime is stuck making the payments on these puppies, it probably 
could get away with calling the \'piratical\' action of liberating the subbies 
from the New Regime as \'repossession\'.  As long as the bank still got paid, 
why should they care *whose* flag the subbies now fly under?  Odd are, the 
interstellar neighbors would only be *too* happy to reflag and reregister any 
boats the Old Regime cared to pull into their ports.  Can you say \'legit merc 
cruiser\'?  With a success-only ticket from the Colchis gov in exile to support 
the Contras?

> Some people would call the stereotypical "pirate base" (a hollowed

Naw.  They\'d prolly be living on their neighbor\'s planet, spending the treasury and complaining mightily about how unfair the Techarchy was in throwing them out to where they might concievably have to *WORK* for a living!!

Damn, I\'m coming up with some nuggets here...

My quickie review:  Standard, dead-head, action movie sprinkled with tid-bits of
touching moments.

I found myself yawning a lot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah...then I\'d get
chocked up for a second...but only for one second...then it was back to the
yeah, yeah, blah, blah stuff.

		BNF            <DIR>
	The BNF program grew out of my interest in the Backus Naur form for
describing computer languages.  This is a very powerful recursive
description of how the elements of a language can fit together.
	My initial interest was to write a program that would write
syntactically correct programs at random.  This didn\'t quite work out
but it left we with some routines for defining and replacing text
patterns to give a random output.  I expanded these and produced BNF
as a quick way of prototyping output.
	I will try and illustrate it\'s use by looking at an example, the
creation of a UPP for a Mega-Traveller character (a fuller version is
given as an example in npc.bnf).

	ACCRETE2 is a DOS-based update to ACCRETE, a simulation that generates solar
systems after randomly determining a solar mass.  What I have done is given
the user the ability to choose a solar luminosity and mass, providing a
greater flexibility for the program.  The original sourcecode appeared to be
K&R C, which I rewrote and converted to ANSI C++  (compiled with Borland C++
4.52, compatible with BC++ 4.xx).  This change will allow me to make a more
robust program/database at a later time.

		CHARGEN1       <DIR>	Character Generator (MT)
	This program was intended primarily as an aid to player character generation
using the basic character generation system, however it has been modified to
allow random PC generation (for NPC\'s) and RANDOM generation of a specific
character.

     Genesis was designed to relieve the TRAVELLER gamemaster from the tedious
development of a TRAVELLER universe by randomly creating the systems.  The
referee may then view the maps and systems, move systems about, create or
reconstruct areas on the maps, display and edit characteristics of the
systems,
print out the characteristics (for the players\' or referee\'s use), and type
text about the systems into \'scratch-pads\' that can be viewed at a later time.

	This software is designed to produce subsector maps for Megatraveller. It
uses
input files generated by another of our programs, the Imperial Atlas database,
but the standard sector listings provided by GDW and available from CompuServe
can probably also be used. A couple of sample files are included, illustrating
the format.

This is the first public beta release of the Traveller Sector Viewer. This
program is designed to allow people to view sector and subsector UWP listings
in map form. The graphics of this program were designed to approximate closely
those found on GDW\'s map of the Spinward Marches. Thus water worlds are blue,
worlds with no water are white. The same is for the rest of the symbols.

SYSGEN1 xx yy zz
       This is the level one system generation program. It produces basic
mainworld information.

SYSGEN2 xx yy zz
       This is the level two system generation program. It produces extended
system information.

SYSGEN3 xx yy zz
       This is the level three system generation program. It produces
information comparable with world builder\'s handbook.

SYSGEN4 xx yy zz PlanetName
       This is the level four system generation program. It produces
surface maps for a planet. It prints a high level map on the screen then
asks which triangle to expand. The triangles are numbered as in (A)

TTIMES xx yy zz
       This program computes the travel times between planets of the
star at the given system. It only computes them for the top layer though.

DETPRINT xx yy zz PlanetName
       This prints out level 3 details on a planet in English. Included are
physical stats, principal cities, local customs, local religion, law levels,
tech levels and hex row seasonal temperatures.

ORIGIN xx yy zz NumberPeople
       This is for finding origins of NPCs. You give it a system and the
number of origin planets to find. It first calculates the total population
from the vacininy then randomly selects planets based on population. It uses
the level 2 figures for the entire system to determine population.

SCANNER xx yy zz
       This is a simple interactive region examining program. It uses the
ANSI clear screen command. While in it the keys X, x, Y, y, Z, z shift along
the given axis. a, A, or + transpose amongst the three axis. The screen
maintains the level 1 info on the center system. 2 and 3 print the level 2
and level 3 information. Q quits the program.
       Really primitive.

TIMTBL xx yy zz time
       This prints a timetable for departing ships for a given system. The
time is measured in days and is an arbitrary number. The data is in the
following format:
The Franhe (Arnelia) out of Sosen (9985 9981 10012)
       Departing 10 for Mouthit (9999 9998 10004)
       26 High berths 2 booked, 3 standby
       7 Low berths 2 booked

The closer a ships gets to its departure date the fuller it will be. I used
it for a simple PBM game over the net that withered away.

SCAN xx yy zz
       This is really just a shell to search outward for whatever you want.
At the moment it prints where it is when a key is pressed and otherwise
searches for the mythical planet "Polo". Unless you are actually searching
for Polo you want to modify the program. It uses level 1 information but
that is easily changed (with the expense of speed). I have used it to look
for water worlds, high governments, etc... [see also capital].

NAME xx yy zz NumNames
       This uses the languages tables for the given system to produce
names. It produces as many names as given but the default is one.

HEXMAP xx yy zz time
       This is for producing a standard 15,000 mile per hex space map
for the area surrounding a planet. The time is optional to give settings
for the satelites. It doesn\'t seem to work for all planets correctly.
It first asks for the planet, then prints a list of the satelites and what
page they would appear on. It then asks for the number of pages wide and long.
It writes to the specified file in strips. Each is designed to fit on your
standard 8" paper in condenced mode. The strips can then be seperated and
taped together for your battle map.
       Try tracing the routes of the ships in coloured pencil as the
battle progresses. We did once and it was really worthwhile. Just like the
tatical maps in Star Wars!

PRMAP xx yy zz PlanetName
       This prints a triangle map of a planet surface. It prompts for a
file name to store the result in. It is straight ascii. It will ask for
a triangle, specifier and size. See sysgen4 for an explanation of what
these mean.

EPMAP xx yy zz PlanetName
       If under MS-DOS this prints a map to the PRN port. If under UNIX
you will want to change the line in the file or else a file called PRN will
be created. The graphics are printed with standard Epson FX-80 compatable
outputs. It will ask for a triangle, specifier and size. See sysgen4 for
an explanation of what these mean.

TCMAP xx yy zz PlanetName
       This is completely analagous to PRMAP except it prints the output
on the screen. It is only compilable under TurboC.

SECPRNT xx yy zz
       This prints a 10x10x10 "sector" starting with the coordinates given.
It uses Epson FX-80 compatable escape sequences for italics, and underligning
(to indicate POP of worlds). Waits for a keypress between pages.

CAPITAL xx yy zz
       This is similar to scan except it searches a 10x10x10 "sector" starting
with the coordinates given. It was originally used to determine the best
planet
as a captial for a "sector". The current example searches for the highest tech
level. It uses level-1 information.

	1) sectmass.bas  MS DOS 6.22 Quickbasic (qb.exe) source for the sector 
massager program.  This splits the dgp (genie) sector data into subsector 
data that can be used with the sub2ps subsector mapping program. It 
could be used to split subsectors for other programs, such as 
Galactic, but it will have to be modified.
	2) Biglist.txt is a text file containing the data for neighboring 
sectors, the name of the sector, and the filename of the sector data.
	3) hardtimes.bas is a program that "Post Virus-ify\'s" a sector using 
the collapse rules in the TNE manual. It produces a sector\'s worth of 
data, replacing the last three letters of the source file name with 
\'_cl\'.  the output can then be run through sectmass to produce

	TRAVVIEW.EXE is a Visual Basic, Windows application which will work with

	The sector name will appear in the window caption, and there will be a
4 x 4 grid, with each subsector\'s name appearing on a button in the grid.
Click on the subsector you want to see, and the Subsector display will appear.
	The Subsector display has been designed to mimic as closely as possible the 
appearance of the Star Map; Subsector Capitals are written in Red text,
planets 
with a population over 1,000,000,000 are written in uppercase, Red and Amber
Zone
planets are denoted on-screen, etc.  To see detailed information about a given
planet in the subsector, click on the planet\'s name.  This will bring up the
Traveller Planetary Information screen.

Look at Andy Slack\'s website:

If all goes to plan you\'ll see 2 (possibly 4) new BITS/CORE 101 Books
released at GenCon UK.

(It\'s all a balancing act between real life (tm) and finding the time to
write material :-\\ ).

He\'s considering the Gamma & X-rays from the blast. The real hazard at
a distance is the "shockwave" (expanding "gas" shell). It\'s expanding
at .8 c or better, and is mostly stripped atoms and free electrons.
And at a density of several hundred to several thousand times that of a
normal vacuum. Thus you\'ll be getting *huge* amounts of secondary
radiation as all these particles hit the upper atmosphere. And it\'ll
last for *months* if not years.

It\'ll also totally screw up the planetary magnetic field.

It works just the same as every other meson gun. A month or so back, I
posted a redesign of the Tracy-class TL11 Free Trader incorporating a
spinal meson gun. It isnt a very big one, true, but with 100 dtons to play
with, I think we could get quite an impressive bang.

Essentially, you have 1400 m3 to play with. I\'d say about 600 m3 of meson
gun (you dont need much length to bushwhack a pirate ... the plan is
surrender, passively target and then blow the crap out of them when they
close to board), 600 m3 of accumulators and 200 m3 of batteries to power
the baby (you cant risk conventional fusion because of the warmup time, and
The Abomination Known As Fusion Plus is something that doesnt exist IMTUs).
It\'s simple enough to build with FFS.

With a bit of footwork, you could probably build it into a sphere, allowing
360 degree rotation and any angle, avoiding the problem of pirates saying
\'Point that way, and keep your turrets at y angle\' ... wont they get a
surprise when they get into range *grin*.

100 ton ? Free Trader ? Isnt that a bit *small* for the IN *grin* I have
this image of a 200 dton Free Trader spewing out a hundred or so missiles,
each with a 500 kiloton det laser warhead on some schmuck pirate in a

If their accounting procedures are this bad, it\'s easier just to redirect
the payment from the Certifying Authority to your own account, and skip
town without all this mucking around with transponder codes and Lefty.

OK. There\'s the answer. Bad or non-existant legal advice on the finer
points of Imperial Law. They think the Imperium gives a damn about some
fight between the old and new governments.

Of course, by going pirate, they completely stuff any attempt to get enough
bits of the Imperial authorities on-side to keep the counter-revolution
going by legal means.

If they had got decent advice, then they\'d keep the ship hidden (in case
something goes wrong), set up the government-in-exile, and register the
mercenary unit with a success-only contract from the government-in-exile,
thus providing a fig leaf of legality for their privateering.

If you have good enough legal advice, then I\'d say you could argue that
hidden base is actually \'New Colchis\', the base for the government-in-exile
that can then apply for lawful recognition over that world. That Imperial
world then supports the counter-revolutionaries on Colchis, under the
\'legitimate extra-planetary interest\' clauses in the unwirtten Laws of War.

    'body' => 'The Traded Sector

If a fledgeling colony can find or develop a source of export income, then
it will be able to buy many goods it cannot produce effectivly locally, or
indeed produce at all.

A surface analysis would indicate that fledgeling colonies would be at an
almost insurmountable economic disadvantage vis a vis already developed
worlds. However, a deeper analysis(1) indicates that things are not as bad
as they might be for both useful and luxury goods (2).

Essentially, a useful commodity\'s value (around which it\'s long-run price
fluctuates) is determined by it\'s cost of production, plus it\'s cost of
transport to the market. It\'s cost of production is determined by the price
of the labour embodied in it, plus the rent on the fixed capital used in
it\'s production plus the price of the raw materials used in it\'s production.

Now, the price of a raw material is determined by the price of the labour
used in it\'s extraction, plus the rent on the fixed capital used in it\'s
extraction, plus the rent paid to the owner of the raw materials.

Fixed capital recieves rents rather than profit, because it has already
been produced, and thus cannot have a value per se to determine profit from
(3).

The minimum price of labour is determined by the cost of living for those
workers. The effective price of labour will depend on their bargaining
power, which usually depends on their alternate employment possibilities
and their ability to negotiate for part of the expected profits of the
enterprise.

Now, a flegeling colony will tend to have rents for raw materials
approaching zero, both because of the sheer amount of raw materials
collection sites versus the number of people in the colony, and because the
low level of law enforcement will quite possibly mean that owners of
resources cannot enforce their legal rights. (4)

Therefore, the price of a colony\'s exports is fundamentally determined by
the price of labour in that colony, and by the costs of maintaining the
capital so used.

Now, we can calculate the minimum per capita income for a world, and
infrastructure maintainence costs 1% of total production per point, so we
know how much exports will cost to gather.

Assume each export sector worker can gather ten liters per week per point
of infrastructure. One displacement ton is 14 000 liters, so one
displacement ton of export material will need 1400
worker/infrastructure/weeks.

Infrastructure maintainence is calculated for the world as a whole, so that
is therefore covered.

The workers involved in the traded sector will not be directly contributing
to the wider world economy, so reduce world GWP by the number of workers
involved in the traded sector multiplied by the per capita income of the
planet (only reduce production. Do not reduce civilian expenses). This
represents the minimum wages of those workers (5).

We therefore have an amount of goods, so it just has to be got to market
and sold.

For non-luxury goods, the sale price at the market world is determined as
per the vanilla trade system. This money can then be used to buy off-world
goods, including spare parts for high technology equipment. (6)

Example : Iimidi (E493314-7 Lo Ni) has a Infrastructure of two, and Khuir
(B478ABB-9 Hi IN) 3 parsecs away. Exports from Iimidi will have a base
price of Cr 5600 on Khuir, plus Actual Value modifications (probably an end
price of Cr 6150 or so).

Each Iimidian worker can gather 100 liters a week of export goods, so 14
workers will be able to gather 1 dton of export goods per week. These
workers have to be paid Cr 560 per annum (average earnings for Iimidi). The
Iimidi Development Corporation has a friendly Detatched Duty Scout with a
Type S ship, which can fit 4 dtons of cargo.

Therefore, if 50 people were gathering goods for export, they can fill the
Type S with cargo in about the time it takes to go to Khuir and back -
about 5 weeks.

The cost of pulling these 50 people out of the domestic economy (2.5% of
Iimidi\'s total workforce) is KCr 28 per year. The projected earnings from
selling the goods on Khuir is roughly KCr 240 per annum. Clearly, if the
Iimidians can negotiate a passable agreement with their friendly
neighbourhood scout, then they will be able to raise a reasonable amount of
hard cash with which to improve their world\'s prospects. If the deal is a
50/50 split, then the export sector is producing goods worth KCr 120 with a
commitment of only 50 people.

(1) Given that Traveller is in many ways the 18th and early 19th century in
space, what choice do I have but use a neo-Ricardan analysis for
interstellar trade ? Interested people are referred to Ricardo, Sraffa and
Joan Robinson, less interested people are invited to use it as econobabble
(the social science equivalent of technobabble) on questioning players to
justify the rules outlined further in.

(2) Luxury commodities are things that are bought for reasons of status, or
where the commodity itself is perceived as having value, regardless of what
it actually does. A warm blanket is a useful good, a hand-embroidered quilt
is a luxury good.

(3) Imagine a gasohol factory that cost MCr 10 million to produce, with a
workforce of 100 that requires a minimum income of Cr 1000 a year. It
consumes 1000 units of corn, and produces 500 units of alcohol. The cost of
operating the factory is thus (price of labour) + (price of corn*1000). The
revenue from the enterprise is clearly (price of alcohol * 500). If alcohol
sells for Cr 1000 a unit, and corn sells for Cr 500 a unit, the total
profit of the enterprise will thus be Cr 400 000 (probably split between
the workforce as wages above the minimum and the owners of the factory).
However, imagine if the price of the factory\'s inputs or outputs changes.
Clearly, the profit of the eneterprise will change. But this will be true
regardless of the original cost of the factory. As long as the factory can
produce only alcohol, the revenue to the factory owners is not determined
at all by the cost of the factory. Thus, the factory in effect acts as
\'land\', and thus receives rent rather than profit.

(4) Of course, if landowners do try and reinforce their rights against
tresspassers by use of force, then we may have the quaint traditions of
range wars, and of shootouts between claim owners and claim jumpers.

(5) I am assuming the minimum wages to be socially determined (eg by the
Culture score). If forced labour is doing the work (eg concentration camps
or similar), then costs might be different.

(6) If the resource owners or workers in question are in a position to
export the goods themselves, then importation of offworld luxuries is more
than likely. One of the themes in developing societies has been the
conflict between the free-trading, agrarian, raw-material exporting regions
and the protectionist, industrial, local-production oriented regions. The
societies where the former group has triumphed have usually failed to
develop economically (eg Argentina vs the post-Civil War USA).

Arrive to who? The public? The local IN admiral? The various Megacorporate
managers? The local Imperial noble? The Shiwonee System government? The
answer may be different for each of these groups. IMO you\'d be best off
deciding for yourself what resources each group would have dedicated to
get important news from Capital, work out the average time it would take
those resources to get the news to Shiwonee and then impose a random roll
(say, 2D-2 days) to account for delays caused by the initial confusion.
Is Shiwonee the Sector capital for Massila? That would make a big difference.
IMO the Sector Admiral would get the news as fast as a Jump-6 courier could
get it to him. The various Megacorporate sector managers would propably also
all have arrangements made to get crucial news delivered by jump-6 courier,
but these arrangements propably have less redundancy that IN arrangements.
Actually it is my belief that megacorporations have both the funds and the
need to have a complete jump-6 courier network between their major managers,
but I know that others disagree. But at the very least I think they would
have a few standby couriers for really crucial information. Indeed, any
sufficiently rich organisation MAY have had a standby courier stationed at
capital. That would include sector-wide companies, governments of high-
population planets, and many Imperial dukes. Not all of them would have
seen a need for something like that, but I think some of them would.
If Shiwonee is not the Sector capital, the next question is how long the
Sector Admiral, Sector Duke, and Sector managers will sit on the news
before they pass it on to their subordinate in Shiwonee System. This would
vary so much according to the goals and personality of each individual that
almost anything is possible.

Whether Shiwonee is the sector capital or not, the Shiwonee government may
have invested in a standby courier of their own, possibly giving them a
jump on the local IN admiral...

You may want to take the line that a randomly rolled X-boat network is too
silly to accept and work out a proper X-boat network for your own TU. If
not, calculate the fastest X-boat trip to the offical X-boat nodes closest
to Shiwonee and then see how long it will take for the news to get the
rest of the way by private means. Calculate with weekly jump-4 passenger
liners between major Class A starports down to occasional Jump-1 tramps
between Class E starports.

I don\'t see the objection. IMO a Class A starport is not so much a starport
where the government could build a starship if they chose to (though I know
that that is exactly the case in TCS). Rather it is a place where a civilian
can go and order a starship built. A Class B starport is one where they
don\'t build starships. They might be able to, but they don\'t, propably
because they can\'t compete economically with the neighboring Class A
starport (After all, if they have to import the jump drive, transportation
costs will increase the total cost of the ship).

There\'s also the very likely possibility that starship yards simply don\'t
sell prefab jump drives (or boycott any subcontractor who does), precisely
because they don\'t want to lose customers to the spaceship yard next
system.

First question: How big is Colchis\' economy and how significant is the
trade partners on a planetary scale? That is, Colchis\' scale?

If these world are too primitive to have anything more than Class E
starports, how do they manage to have any significant in-system traffic?

OK. So the population of Colchis is so small that their entire navy
consists of a couple of (presumably quite large) SDBs and a handful of
patrol cruisers, yet it is the largest system in the subsector? That
sounds somewhat anomalous for an Imperial subsector. 

>Ever try to fulfill promises of an Air/Raft in every garage when someone
>is nailing your grav module cargos?

So these worlds that Colchis trades with has populations too small to
afford a single small SDB, bout they are big enough to specialize in
their production to the point that Colchis finds it cheaper to import
grav modules rather than build them itself?

Just how many workshacks and fabrication plants capable of producing
starship replacement parts are there in a gaggle of worlds with Class E
starports and minuscule populations? And how do the rebels pay for the
replacement parts? With cargoes stolen from the same worlds? (Hurting
the Colchis trade without hurting the trade partners dosen\'t seem
possible).

How many intermediate stops from Hamovar to Colchis? All Colchis (or
Hamovar) needs to be able protect merchant traffic is one sufficiently
big task force in each intermediate system. BTW. what is Hamovar doing
about the disruption of its trade?

How long is the pipeline? Every extra jump adds to the transportation
costs. Pretty soon the fences will begin losing money on cargoes of
stables even if they get them for free.

Colchis don\'t need to chase the rebels down to protect their trade. All
they need are ships that can outfight them. And since they no longer
have to support the rebels, they can afford to hire about the same
weight and quality in starmercs as they lost to the rebels. So unless
_all_ the jump-capable ships in the Colchis fleet rebelled, they
outnumber the rebels. BTW. I suppose the old Colchis government was
silly enough not to have any reserve ships laid up in ordinary?
Because if they had, the Technarchs could have recommisioned those ships
(equivalent to anything from 50% to 800% of the active peacetime navy
depending on your assumptions) and used them. I admit that it will take
quite a while before Colchis can build new ships.

As long as the ships don\'t need to actually visit any civilized starports,
they could propably get away without any of that stuff.

All very poetic, but it dosen\'t do anything to prove that such an existence
is possible. It may be or it may not be, but just saying that it is dosen\'t
help a whole lot. (Mind you, I think the renegade patrol ship is the most
plausible source of pirates anyone has come up with so far, but I don\'t
think they would be all that numerous.

A rather unusual astrographical set-up, isn\'t it? I mean, how many similar
setups do you think there is in the Imperium?

That formula was wrong. What I do is divide by 2^^(log((population)-8)).
So for a population of 100,000,000 I divide by 1, for one of 1 billion
I divide by 2, and for one of 10 billion I divide by 4.

places wanted to see the "custom graphic" before committing to do
even one for me, but both advertised being able to do orders of
"any size".  I have no reason to believe that there would be any
real problems with doing them in choice-of-color (so that you
Marine types can get the yellow ones with the red sunburst, for
example); there are, however, some questions outstanding which
_must_ be answered before I pursue this idea further:

(1) Arguably, Marc and IG may have legal vetoes over this idea;
morally, Marc absolutely does.  I\'m not interested in making
money from this; if it becomes possible, the cost to anyone who
wants one will be the cost of the cap plus shipping.  Do I hear
any objections from anyone entitled to object and make it stick?

(2) Is there any actual interest in this?

(3) What kind of price would people be willing to pay for this?
Give me three estimates: One if you can only get it in one color,
black with yellow sunburst, one if you can pick from a fixed menu
of colors (i.e. Standard-Bk&Y, Marine-Y&R, Navy-... etc.), and
one if you can pick your colors freely. (By the way, what _are_
the standard color combos?)

I also want to point out that this is potentially advertising for
the game system.  I don\'t go to cons, but people here do, and if
Marc gets a new publisher in the near future, this is a potential
source of ready-made promo stuff - depending, of course, on
whether the places can actually handle very large orders, and at
a reasonable price...

It\'s probably better if you write to me privately to express your
interest; no sense in cluttering the list.

It might be possible that Wizards of the Coast might be able to purchase
the license and port it over to Alternity, at least until the current
license expires. Bill Slavicek (sp.), one of the Alternity design team,
worked on Star Wars over at West End during what many consider it\'s heydey.
(I don\'t think the 2nd edition-Revised was such a good idea, myself...)

If anyone could make a go of it. it\'s probably WoTC/TSR.

It must be terrible to be so cynical of a movie you went to
(presumably) be entertained by.

While I had some questionable moments during the movie, there wasn\'t
anything that messed up my willing suspension of disbelief enough to
ruin the enjoyment of it.

I\'d be willing to buy one, up to about $30, assuming it is a good cap as
well as having the sunburst on it (i.e. a quality all-cloth type cap, and
not a plastic-mesh-backed cheap baseball cap). I probably wouldn\'t buy it
at all if it weren\'t a good cap on its own, regardless of what is on it,
even if it was cheaper.

I put this up here, because I wanted to raise the issue above - the quality
of the actual article, apart from the logo blazoned on it. I hope that all
Traveller licensed products can be pressed to follow this philosophy,
rather than the as-cheap-as-possible model.

MHO,

Yeah, I saw that, and it came as something of a surprise to me. I was

Well, I liked MT cos it had the advance charcter genration until I found it
came from CT (LBB). Then I figured it was just an import and no better than
the original. But I like the TNE system because the player can make a
character they want to play, which is the major criteria of my game ie. the
players have fun (within my limits :))

Err, being a Twilight 2000 fanatic I guess TNE win\'s out. Throw the players
into a bloodbath and at worst only a couple will die, the others get mangled
limbs :)

Worked out the MT system on paper... Hell I\'m a gearhead FFS does most of it

CT (LBB) was the easiest and more fun to implement.

It just doesn\'t work, why trade stuff to other planets when you living on a

Err, Adventure points are cheap and easy and since the skills are only a
minor part of the game I use them, TNE.

Of course :)

I am currently running a game set in the year @2100 AD (well before the
imperium) the characters are Marines working for the UEPF (United Earth
Peacekeeping Force). Basically I\'m working on having a no anti-grav
Cyberpunkish kind of society. The governments rule with the backing of the
corporations...
  First contact has been made! Unfortunately it was with the Kafer (stolen
from 2300) who tend to kill things. Then the Hatchlings (aka Bughunters)
appeared and now it\'s a mess of highly dangerous weapons and psychopathic
PC\'s. Fun for all the family :)
  I am using the TNE system both because I like it and It\'s hard to kill a
PC. Considering the firepower around in this campaign then this is a good
thing. Hey I like realism but sometimes you gotta let go and have a
megablast!

This is wrong. It should be 20 liters per week each, so it should take 70
workers to do a dton in a week.

This is right - 50 workers do about 4 dtons in 5 weeks.

Absolutely...the .sit and .hqx versions of the Mac files are ok. Most
everything else is text.

Of course you\'ll need some version of MS-Dos to run a bunch of the programs,
or a C compiler handy, as many of the programs include source code.

Speaking of MS-Dos...any Mac folk on the list with enough experience to say
whether Real PC or Virtual PC work well enough on a PowerMac 7200/75 to
emulate at least a 386? (All I really need for stuff like Galactic and the
apps on the CD..I don\'t _want_ to do Windows at home...I\'ve gotta put up with
_that_ all day long at work!)

I\'ve got bunches of memory and diskspace...All the reviews I\'ve read of the
products are by people running Windows or twitch games on it, no one bothers
to test five year old RPG utilities with it ;-)

In 1850 it was routine for dirty laundry to be shipped from San Francisco
to China to be laundered and ironed, then returned to SF.

You never know what local conditions will lead to - every situation is
unique. Imagine a freighter crew being given 100 tons of *dirty laundry*
for transport to a neighboring world for washing and ironing  ;)

You can\'t get less for a sheep than to sell it live, so New 
Zealand does. You can\'t get less for timber than to sell it 
unprocessed, so New Zealand does. New Zealand was 
the only place in the world that grew Kiwifruit, so we sold 
some breeding plants to Chile, and now they are taking 
over our markets.

The Real world is full of examples that don\'t make sense. 
I fail to see why the Empire will be smarter. What makes 
sense at an individual level, is often stupid on a more 
general level.

I would like a combat system where it was possible to 
make someone stop shooting at you by hitting them with 
a 9mm round to the chest (assuming for the moment that 
they are unarmoured). I\'m not asking for a guaranteed 
one shot stop, but 50% would be nice. T2000, and by 
extension TNE doesn\'t achieve this (I only own T2000 
ed2).

As it is the TNE combat system is unable to guarantee 
you that hitting anyone will put them down. Thus the 
characters up the level of artillery they carry until they 
_can_ get a reasonable assurance of putting someone 
out of the fight. This screws with the assumptions I base 
my world on when deciding what an average load out is 
for a cop for instance. 

What I want is a system where people go down when you 
hit them, but if you get to them quickly enough, you can 
save them with the wonders of modern medicine. CT 
combined with Striker actually did this for me reasonably 
well, since most weapons would put someone down, but 
it was actually quite difficult to get an instant kill, thus 
satisfying the opposing desires of some degree of 
verisimilitude vs not having to roll a new character every 
two sessions.

technologies - the anti-grav module and the meson gun.

I dont think it was the intention of the games designers to make meson guns
as dominant weapons as they are for ground combat, but under FFS you really
cant go past a small meson gun as a vehicle weapon. It is trivially easy to
make a 20 km range meson gun, and the ability to kill armoured targets
makes the typical Traveller \'grav tank\' dead meat.

Given the power of meson guns, Ogre-style vehicles will tend to dominate,
as they can commit the volume and power for thick enough meson screens to
defend against the meson weapons carried by vehicles and small starships. I
dont like this. We need to lobby Marc Miller into mandating a minimum size
for meson guns (I\'d suggest 100m at TL11, falling by 20m per TL thereafter.
This puts the abomination that is the handheld meson gun at TL16, which is
where it should be).

The second dominant technology is contra-gravity. As well as enabling very
heavily armoured grav tanks, it enables grav-packed Mobile Infantry by
about TL10 and exceedingly fast contragravity powered missiles.

Although Bubba-style kinetic kill missiles are probably not viable in
atmospheres, combustion laser warheads probably are. This will push the
required point defense range out to line-of-sight, which essentially
restricts this role to lasers (plasma and solid warheads cannot reach the
missile in time to stop it detonating).

Particle weapons are, I suspect, best used in an anti-personell role -
dug-in infantry will tend to use a lot of sand in and around their
positions, possibly suspended inside some sort of plastisised dome, and
neutral particle weapons will allow these positions to be suppressed. The
length/diameter requirements of PAWs mean that they need to be quite large
to penetrate the armour a grav tank can easily mount.

I have to agree with you here, a 45 or 9mm should have a reasonable
chance of producing a "one shot stop"....and I *like* TNE and by
extension TW2K, so I\'d rather discuss *fixing* the problem. 

By a "one shot stop" I don\'t mean instant death, necessarily, but a
heavy slug in the chest really should put most people out of action
very quickly.  Let\'s look at this and see what we can come up with.

First let\'s assume an average TNE character who has 6 for all stats.
That gives a Chest Hit Capacity of (6+6)*3 = 36 points.

To stop this average character with a single chest shot you\'re going
to need to get a "Serious Wound" plus an "Unconsciousness roll", a
"Quick Kill", or at least a "Knockdown."

Serious Wound -- more than the hit capacity, but less than double, ie.
37 to 72 points.  This reduces the Initiative rating by 3 (severely
limiting their ability to act), and if they fail a continuing 1d100
against their CON they fall into unconsciousness, ie 93% chance of
dropping every 30 seconds.  This looks good, but unfortunately, most
hand weapons can\'t deliver 36 to 72 points with a single bullet, and
for it to be about a 50-50 average you\'ll need a 10d6 weapon.  Look
one of those up. ;->

Quick Kill -- "Any shot which hits the chest or head may constitute a
killing shot.  Roll a d20, if the roll is less than or equal to the
damage value of the shot, the target is instantly killed except on a
roll of 20 exactly."  This has been interpreted two different ways,
either the damage value mentioned is the number of *dice* rolled, or
it is the number of *pips* rolled.  If it is the dice, then pistols
have a 5% or 10% chance of a Quick Kill.  If it is the pips then, for
pistols, the chance ranges from 5% to 60%...for most pistols the
average chance is 15% or 20%.  [Personally, I prefer using the pips,
because I want combat more deadly.]

However!  The rules go on to say that the Quick Kill rule shouldn\'t be
applied to PC\'s, and no bones are made that this is something of a
cop-out.  Instead the suggestion is to roll for the Quick Kill, and
double the damage done if the roll succeeds.

Unfortunately, even doubling the damage for a single 9mm Auto Pistol\'s
round (1d6) rolled at *maximum* is only 12 points.  So, it would take
3 slugs to the chest, all at maximum roll and all quick kills to fall
1 short of a serious wound.

Knockdown -- if the total damage take in a turn exceeds current AGL
the character is knocked down and can\'t act for the rest of the turn. 
So, we need to put 7+ hits on a character to knock him down.  That\'s a
2d6 weapon, and in TNE that means a you need a 9 mm Magnum or a rifle
bullet to have a chance on a single shot.  Even then the character can
get back up next turn and most likely continue fighting...that helps,
but not a lot.

Ok, what can we do about this problem, for those of us that see it as
a problem?  (Don\'t say...play XXX...because XXX probably has similar
problems. ;-)

1.  Reduce the number of hit point capacity of each body part,
particularly the chest.  This might be a good idea, but I don\'t think
you can drop the numbers enough to have an effect without creating
other problems.

2.  Increase the amount of damage that weapons deal out.  Using d10\'s
has been suggested, forex, but I\'m not enthused by that suggestion,
I\'d like to stay with d6\'s for damage for a number of reasons.  I *do*
think increasing the number of dice and adding modifiers is a good
idea, though...that\'s something about GURPS I like.  Still, I don\'t
think anyone is going to want to increase the numbers enough to have
the "one stop stop" effect we want.

3.  Modify Quick Kill to become QUICK STOP, and apply it to *all*
characters.  Use the rule as it currently stands, but instead of
causing instant death, it causes an instant *stun* that drops the
character. Regaining consciousness could be a Difficult (or
Formidable) task against CON.  If you wanted NPC\'s to be dead instead
of stunned, then that\'s a GM\'s prerogative.

Personally, I favor a little of 2 and a lot of 3. 

Two more things...

First, a seriously wounded...but conscious...character seems to be
able to perform many tasks as if they were fresh as a daisy.  T4, MT
and CT temporarily reduced Attributes due to hits, and that seems like
a realistic thing to me.  I know I wouldn\'t be able to recite pi to 15
places *as easily* if I\'d taken a slug in the head, even if it didn\'t
knock me out.  I\'d also reduce the mental Stats, particularly if the
hit was to the head, maybe chest too.

Second, cuts and puncture wounds tend to cause bleeding and the
wounded will usually get worse and worse until they fall into
unconsciousness and/or die.  I don\'t see where that is addressed very
well at all in TNE...or in T4, MT or CT for that matter.  Without
getting too complicated, a way should be found to model the continued
draining of a character\'s "life force", to steal a phrase from MT,
until the wound is treated.  How about keep reducing Attributes by one
each turn as long as a wound isn\'t "stabilized?"  It\'s not quite that
easy, but that\'s the basic idea.

To summarize, I think...TNE (and T4 too, though less so) needs to make
combat a litle more deadly, particularly, chest shots.  The number of
hit points a weapon does should go up, but that won\'t solve the
problem. A "Quick Stun" rule would help a lot, but solve everything. 
A way to reduce Attributes through damage and having some kinds of
hits continue inflicting additional damage over several turns are
features that should be included.

Well that might not be realistic.  9mm are pretty pathetic actually...  There
are notorious instances of those Samoan guys not going down after taking over
20 x 9mm rounds...  Handgun fatalities in general are lower than most people
think, too.

The 9mm autopistol has a DV of 2.  Knockdown says that if you take more damage
*points* than current AGL, there is a knockdown w/ no other actions for the
rest of the current turn.  Average damage points from that 9mm is 7, which is
higher than average AGL (6).  Max damage is 12.  Outstanding Success doubles
damage,  as does the (optional) Quick Kill/Double Damage rule.  There\'s a
potential damage of 36 using TNE as printed, which is a Serious chest wound to
the average (STR 6 CON 6) detailed character.  

I use D10 for damage and quadruple damage when there\'s both Outstanding
Success and Quick Kill... meaning there\'s 80 possible damage.  That\'ll put a
Critical chest wound in the above average character.  When I want a lethal
situation (which varies by circumstance), I also have an intersting play on
the optional Quick Kill rule (but don\'t think it applies to small caliber
handguns).

What assumptions are those?  I\'m interested in what others assume for the

TNE does this perfectly. They go down in my campaign... especially when we\'re
talking about combat rifles in trained hands.  TNE is Wound Severity system.
Critical hits (non head) give you 10 minutes to get medical attention
(Formidable Medical (surgery) to reduce a critical wound to serious) or die.
I put a house rule giving head crits 1 minute if there\'s a success against
Quick Kill.

Gary, the *average* guy isn\'t going to take multiple 9mm chest shots
and keep coming, or at least they shouldn\'t in my game.  An
exceptional character might and random variation should allow Joe
average a chance, but not normally.  Maybe it should take multiple
hits from a 5mm to drop the average guy, but 9mm rounds aren\'t
pinpricks.  ;->

>The 9mm autopistol has a DV of 2.  

Not in the TNE rule books I own.  The 9mm Magnum Revolver is 2, but
the auto pistols are 1.  There might be errata that I missed, but I
specifically looked it up tonight on the table in the in the back of
the TNE basic rules.

As I posted earlier, I think the DV should go up some for handweapons,
and use modifiers.  Something like...

22 pistol (5.6mm)  1d6
32 pistol (8mm)    1d6+1
9mm pistol         2d6
9mm Magnum pistol  2d6+1  (longer short range/less stopping power) 44
pistol (11mm)   2d6+2
45 ACP (11.5mm)    2d6+3  (shorter short range/more stopping power)

...for example.  Can you tell, I\'m been around the the 9mm/45ACP
debates over the years?  ;->

>Knockdown says that if you take more damage *points* than current AGL,

>turn.

Yep. I\'d just like to make it less likely that the bogie will get back
up next turn and keep charging.  Ok!  Ok!  That\'s why I put another
round or two into him while he\'s down, right?  ;->

>Average damage points from that 9mm is 7, which is higher than average
>AGL (6).

As I pointed out above, it\'s only 3.5 if it\'s not the Magnum revolver,
and won\'t knock our bogie down even at the maximum roll of 6.  I agree
that it *should* though, which is why I suggested increasing the DV
for handguns.

>Max damage is 12.  Outstanding Success doubles damage,  as does the
>(optional) Quick Kill/Double Damage rule.  There\'s a potential damage
>of 36 using TNE as printed, which is a Serious chest wound to the

It\'s 37, actually "...more damage than its capacity...", and as a
break point it is significant that even the 2d6 weapon won\'t *quite*
get there on an average character.  Outstanding Success requires 10
greater than the needed roll, that\'s not an easy thing to get unless
you\'re taking an aimed shot at short range.  Even with some training,
Joe Average is going to have an asset of only 9 or 10 isn\'t he? 

Anyway, look over my other post.  I think we agree in principle,
except I might feel the need to make wounds a lot more serious, and
think medium and heavy pistols should have more oomph, not necessarily
more killing power, but more stopping power.

I wasn\'t talking about fatalities, I was talking about 
effective stops. From the Cop records study I read in 
some gun magazine (I think it\'s available on the web, but 
I\'m not sure where) the average 9mm was achieving a 1 
shot stop (the bad guy could not return any more fire, nor 
run anywhere) counting only hits to the torso, was about 
50-60% depending on the type of round used. This was 
more or less the same as the Colt .45 ACP. (for every 
story about a 9mm fail-to-stop, there\'s another one for 
.45\'s)

On the subject of fatalities though, it\'s not unknown for 
.22 pistols to achieve instant kills with chest shots. It\'s 
not common, but it happens. T2K doesn\'t address this 
very well either.

There is talk that assassins sometimes use .22 pistols 
because they can get in, get a shot in, and leave, and 
they are less likely to be spotted because the signature 
is so low. Characters don\'t bother with this because they 
need to use a .50 cal slug to get a reasonable chance of 
a kill from a chest hit.

In T2000, a 9mm does DV 1, so that\'s slightly different, It still means that to put 
out for the fight, I need to achieve a Serious chest hit, 
which you\'ve indicated happens 1 time in 36 on a 
outstanding success, as opposed to about 50% IRL.

I\'d like to have the cops carrying sufficient to put down 
the average person with one hit. In real Life, 9mm is 
adequate for this most of the time. If the same isn\'t true 
in the game, then the characters (who come loaded with 
sufficient to take someone down in the game system) 
probably can take down the cops without the cops being 
able to command the level of respect necessary to be 
taken seriously. In Traveller, it\'s more likely to be 
something taser-like.

No argument with that, but rifles are a different subject to 
pistols (I did once hear a story about someone who 
walked into Emergency with twentysix 5.56mm slugs in 
them. - you want to try modelling that?)

But still I\'d like to achieve a certain amount of respect for 
pistols. In the real world no one want\'s to be shot with 
even a .22, but characters who _know_ a .22 can\'t take 
them down in one shot are prepared to take more risks.

(Well, I bought T2000, but after some consideration, I 
think it\'s a better small unit wargame than a combat 
system for RPG\'s; So I didn\'t buy TNE partly because I 
already had (most of) the system, and partly because I 
laughed my ass off over the virus :-)

I think I\'ve been reading the same studies as you. That\'s 
my definition of a "stop" - something that ends the fight 
for the victim, though not necessarily fatally.

My T2k suggests a .50 cal machine gun delivers 8d at 
close range...

> Quick Kill -- "Any shot which hits the chest or head may constitute a
> killing shot.  Roll a d20, if the roll is less than or equal to the

> roll of 20 exactly."  

in T2K it\'s on a d10 - that makes it a little more deadly... 
followed by "It is recommended that PC\'s that suffer a 
killing wound instead suffer enough damage to increase 
the wound level of the head or chest to at least serious if 
unwounded, and critical if wounded, in addition to the 
normal damage inflicted by the round."
This suggests that in T2k a pistol hit to the chest on a 
PC would be sufficient to inflict a "serious wound" if the 
kill amount was rolled (a 10% chance).

This has been interpreted two different ways,
> either the damage value mentioned is the number of *dice* rolled, or

Seems pretty clear that it\'s number of dice in T2K.

(Struggle....)
You could always try CORPS - it is very elegant, and you 
can use (optional) "hero" points to reduce the lethality of 
combat... (Sorry couldn\'t resist)

This was my first reaction. What do you see as the 
problems?
 
> 2.  Increase the amount of damage that weapons deal out.  

This too was my second option, Increasing to d10 ups 
the average dice damage to 5.5, an assault rifle M16 
equiv would be doing ~11 points. Still not enough... 
Combined with halving HP per location (actually, I\'d tend 
towards making them less spread out.)

See the T2k rule above.  Still gives a relatively low 
chance of a stop unless you apply it to pips of damage.

Sounds not unreasonable. I\'d tend to roll against severity 
of damage, modified by amount of activity on the part of 
the victim. "Don\'t move johnny, you\'re bleeding bad"

To a certain amount, yes.

True, although a slightly toned down version (such as the SJG \'Ogre\') is
well within even M0\'s tech level.  A robot tank with nuclear weapons is not
something you\'d want coming after you, even if it isn\'t truely self-aware.

In T4 a 9mm hit (if the first hit a player takes) is likely to drop the
player into unconsiousness -

Avg roll for 3D = 10.5

Avg roll for stat 2D = 7 (okay, so this is low because you can raise the
stat in Char gen)

A snub pistol (5D) gives 17.5 avg, but you discard the lowest 2 dice thanks
to the KE limit so it should be the high end of the 3D range, ie >10.5, and
there is also a 1D explosive damage hit simultaneously IIR-EA-C.

  By "bunches" I assume you mean at least 64MB of RAM and a free 200+MB of
hard drive? If so you\'ll be fine...
 The current versions of both _recommend_ a faster machine, but for exactly
the reasons you mention. Both are Pentium (cue the stupid jingle) emulators
(only Real PCs predecessor SoftWindows, v1 and v2 weren\'t Pentium emulators).
While I have access to both, and plenty of machines to try them on, I lack the
time to test such things as five-year-old RPG utilities.  More\'s the shame.
  My general sense is that Virtual PC is more stable. Our local emulator nut
seems to prefer it over the others. By avoiding the Windows versions, however,
BOTH can be had for about $120 total, so trying them both isn\'t too hideously
expensive.

Well, definitely the Mk. 25+ Bolos far outclass anything the
Imperium can throw at them; they can duel (and usually win!)
with warships in orbit. I was thinking of the lesser Marks.
I envision the high-end grav-tanks of the Imperium have some
very smart non-AI computers onboard. Hmmm...now that I think
about it, Slammer\'s tanks *are* pretty close to want I\'m
envisioning though I\'d think TL15 armor would be capable of
a little more autonomy (not complete autonomy though).

BTW, Leonard and Pete, thanks for setting me straight on
development of the Web.

Question for the TML:  would grav-tanks be able to engage
in a maneuvering dogfight similar to fighter aircraft or
would they be limited to locking down their turret if they
go above a certain speed in an atmosphere. Technically, these
things can be booted out a cargo bay from low orbit and make
their own way to the planetary surface (can\'t they?).

	1. Why dogfight? The reason aircraft dogfight is to bring their
fixed weapons to bear. Since the pilot can\'t fly and aim a turret at
the same time, the weapon is rigid inside the plane, and to hit he
has to point the plane at the enemy. The enemy, naturally, tries to
avoid being the pointee and hopes to return the favor. On the other
hand, a grav tank, with high-tech stabilized weapons and fire
control, can aim its weapons independently of the direction it\'s
facing. Of course, there\'s going to be jinking and maneuvering to try
to screw up the other guy\'s fire control, but it\'s not going to be a
classic airplane ball\'o\'string trying to line your nose up on the
other guy.

	2. Yes, above a certain airspeed, turret weapons, etc. have to be
locked down. However, you can still use fixed weapons ... which leads
you back into the dogfighting realm. However, I\'m not sure most grav
vehicle combat will be conducted at those high speeds, unless you\'re
trying to escape.

Yoou also have to look at it this way: it\'s also cheapest to sell sheep live,
and timber unprocessed. Post production processing requires capital
investments and an infrastructure to support those investments.

_Most_ raw materials, especially large livestock, are not processed by the
original \'manufacturer\', but are raised by one business and sold to another
for further processing. (In the case of some things, like cattle, there might
be five or more middlemen betwixt that cow on the range and that plastic
wrapped steak on your grocers shelf).

The kiwi fruit thing is simply a matter of marketing, cost of production, and
in the case of the US market favorable trade regulations (In return for
destroying a 150 year history of peaceful, democratic, civilian government,
instituting a 20 year reign of terror and death, and ohbytheway not
nationalizing US copper interests, the US gave Chile a berth in NAFTA,
markedly lowering trade barriers to the US market.)

Besides, trying to keep the kiwi fruit exclusive to New Zealand would have
required a level of government opression unlikely to be tolerated by the
populace, as the kiwi trees would have to be declared state property. 

Fruitless, as well, because if nothing else, you\'re exporting tons of kiwi
seed with the fruit.

There are notorious instances of those Samoan guys not going down after
taking over 20 x 9mm rounds...  Handgun fatalities in general are lower
than most people think, too.
 
One of the hardest things to model in games.  I use CORPS because it does a
good job of handling the various odd things that bullets do.

A veteran LAPD officer was  shot in the foot with a .22.  The bullet was
visible under the skin.  The officer died of shock before he could reach a
hospital.

In New York City, a man was shot in the forehead from a distance of about
two feet by a .45 caliber pistol.  The bullet deflected off the man\'s
skull, traveled around his head under the skin, and exited the rear of his
head.  The gunman, seeing an entrance and exit wound, assumed his target
was dead.  The target awoke, and walked to a hospital.

These are extreme examples, but show what you face when you talk about
modeling bullet wounds.

And every soldier has heard about the Trepedia that shot out of nowhere to

hatches open, the crew had been dead for hours...

IMTU, there is a definite line between grav-tanks and speeders.  G-tanks
make maximum use of cover to get close enough to engage the enemy.  Speeder
go balls to the wall to deliver smaller payloads.

The game Renegade Legion: Prefect has an interesting section on combat
between grav formations.  Basically, units probe and shift, waiting for
good intel on the enemy main force, with many small meeting engagements.
Once you have a fix on the enemy, you attack with everything hoping to
catch him off-balance.  On this scale, a single division front would run
the length of California (800 miles, more or less, compared to the modern
division front of 5-10 miles.)

Units that "go high", i.e. get out of NOE flight, move much faster, but are
easy targets.  In Traveller, this would from orbital fire, remote MRLS
equipped with anti-armor "chaser" missiles, and every line-of-sight weapon
that can see you.  Going high is reserved for desperate dashes to a
critical area, and even then you go low hundreds of miles from the FEBA
(Forward Edge of the Battlefield Area.)

Tanks can de-orbit themselves, but I tend to use assault shuttles that are
optimized for atmospheric flight that get down to about 40,000ft (on a size
8, atmosphere 6 world) before dumping their eggs.  These vessels can also
drop dead fall ordinance while they\'re on site, causing difficulties for
any defenders directly below the release point.  Of course, by the time you
are dropping tanks, the Marines should have secured a landing field for you.

Yes the lower model numbered Bolos are design able in MT/CT. I used a
collapsing rounds for the Hellbores, 20cm to 30cm in size Mass Drivers with
max ROF, Multiple Nuclear Dampers batteries, and batteries of small calibre
(<= 1cm)MD guns for infinite repeaters, and due to the amount of armor is
used track ie tread units.

It was no design able until about TL12, but the Mark 1 and 2\'s can be done
at lower TL\'s. As for the robotic brains I used the Robots book design
sequence, at lower TL the robot brain\'s were pretty pathetic but at higher
TL\'s ie 14-15 the robot brains were adequate.

Yes they could dogfight other craft, depending on their speed they might
have to stow their large turrets, but also their type of configuration will
also have an effect on the max speed. It has been done in the past designs
a high speed grav fighter.

My campaign is estivating for the summer, but I can give a synopsis of the
story line.

The Sylean Federation is paralyzed by a conflict in the moot between a
expansionist faction led by the charismatic Cleon Zhunastu and an
isolationist faction led by the Marquess Aurion. The Sylean Federation
Scout Service (SFSS) is wracked by allegations of corruption and
incompetence; they are being sued by a shipping company for false survey
data and the Navy is maneuvering to take over gathering survey data and
reassign the SFSS only to collating.

Meanwhile, the Interstellar Confederacy is self-destructing from
independance movements, the legacy of an extremely divisive civil war.
There are persistent rumors the movements are receiving outside assistance.

I am trying to use troupe-style play. Each player has two characters, and I
allow them to run important NPCs. This has been very useful in that I don\'t
have to arrange for the same people to always have to show up at all
important events. There is a tendency for players to use NPCs to help out
their own characters, but I haven\'t decided if this is a problem or not.

So far, the players are a collection of scouts, technicians, and minor
bureaucrats who have survived a purge of non-Syleans in the scout service.
Recently they have all been hired to upgrade the starport on Adgu Uun, a
newly independant Confederacy system. It must be important, because a
member of the moot and a squadron of Navy vessels, including a 100 000 dton
Obsidian class destroyer, are there to oversee the operation.

An important subplot is Rampant Interstellar Piracy! Yes, despite the fact
that Federation planets have hundreds of SDBs, merchants are armed, and
multi-kiloton warships patrol the starlines, hardly a month goes by without
headlines proclaiming another ship lost to this scourge. While none of the
players has ever seen a pirate, knows no one who has ever seen a pirate,
and there has never been a pirate attack on a Federation system in living
memory, everyone KNOWS they are out there. Where else are all the ships
disappearing to? Just recently a free trader was reported lost 2 subsectors
outside the borders. The Federation must expand its borders to protect
itself!

The rules system is T4 plus whatever sounds good at the moment.

Doug, I just can\'t get into CORPS...and I\'ve tried. I\'d rather use
GURPS in all it\'s advanced rule glory than CORPS for gun combat, and
quite frankly, I\'d rather *not* use GURPS for gun combat. ;-> I guess
it\'s a different strokes kind of thing. The TNE|TW2K and T4 rules,
with modifications naturally ;->, just *feel* better to me.

Yes, continuing damage from shock and bleeding should be included
somehow.  Very rare for slight wounds, like from a .22, but
*possible*, and more common and faster for more serious wounds from
medium and heavy pistols and rifles.

And yes, the converse should be true as well.  A .45 (or 7.62 rifle)
bullet to the head at point blank range should not always kill the
target, almost always, but with a *chance* of survival.

Probably, the easiest what to handle it is GM fiat, but not everybody
*likes* that idea. ;->  So, we keep tinkering.

BTW, what ever became of the detailed combat system you were working
on for T4?  Did you drop it when IG went south, or are you just
holding off on it until T4.1 comes out?

It\'s quite possible that the trading partners of Colchis have very little
in-system traffic at all. Most of the Interstellar Flotilla\'s role was
probably making the Self-Perpetuating Oligrachy on Colchis feel
like some kind of Interstellar Power, rather than actually fulfilling any
useful purpose. How many nations on Earth have no electricity in
most of their people\'s homes, yet try to buy modern attack aircraft?

OK. So the population of Colchis is so small that their entire navy
consists of a couple of (presumably quite large) SDBs and a handful of
patrol cruisers, yet it is the largest system in the subsector? That

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Colchis may be the largest, except for some big systems (like Hamovar)
on the edges of the subsector that perform the overwhelming percent
of their trade with the better-developed subsectors next door. To the
dispossessed crews kicked out of Colchis, they may think of Colchis
and the planets two or three parsecs around (the ones they visit all the
time) as "their" subsector.

Look at District 268 in the Spinward Marches. A subsector with one
medium-sized planet as the biggest britches around is impossible
with the random subsector generation presented by Traveller, but if
you generate the entire sector and then move the planets around to
make things interesting (or even sensible) you can get frontier
or backwater sectors like this with ease.

So these worlds that Colchis trades with has populations too small to

grav modules rather than build them itself?

The first officer may have been waxing poetic at this point. Also, she

Colchis lost most of it\'s interstellar navy during the coup (all ten to twenty
sub-1000, or even sub-600tn ships of it) - all were crewed or at least
officered by members of the old ruling class. They\'re probably looking
around for a way to replace their navy, and they will eventually - but it
was faster to file a complaint with the Sector Admiral and get a navy 
patrol flotilla to make a sweep.
Hamovar? It may not have even noticed the trade problems with Colchis.
As I was saying, Colchis is of prime importance to her inhabitants,
and almost irrelevant to anyone else. 
I see two to three jump-1 from Hamovar to Colchis, and this route being
underdeveloped worlds with little besides refueling stations. There may
be other routes as well, especially if the Colchis government is trying
alternate routes to reopen interstellar trade.

Hans again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
BTW. I suppose the old Colchis government was
silly enough not to have any reserve ships laid up in ordinary?
Because if they had, the Technarchs could have recommisioned those ships
(equivalent to anything from 50% to 800% of the active peacetime navy
depending on your assumptions) and used them. I admit that it will take
quite a while before Colchis can build new ships. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Considering how small the Colchis military budget was, they were
probably using ships they purchased from the mothball fleet of some
other planet. They may have some hangar queens lying around, but
everything that could make jump-1 was in the flotilla.
Old Colchis couldn\'t afford the navy they had. They also couldn\'t afford
the manor houses, offworld educations and other trappings of their
ruling class. That\'s one of the reasons they have a new government.

Hans again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Colchis don\'t need to chase the rebels down to protect their trade. All
they need are ships that can outfight them. And since they no longer
have to support the rebels, they can afford to hire about the same
weight and quality in starmercs as they lost to the rebels. So unless
_all_ the jump-capable ships in the Colchis fleet rebelled, they
outnumber the rebels.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Let\'s see - Colchis has just seen a change in government. It\'s off-world
bond rating (due to the chaos and uncertainty, as well as the loss of
many merchant ships going to or from Colchis) is in the dumpster,
and the new government goes through the books and finds out just
how deep in debt the old ruling class put them before the coup.
Colchis wasn\'t paying rent on those starships, they *owned* them - 
the loss of the Interstellar Flotilla doesn\'t indicate any funds being
available to hire an equal weight of starmercs.

Starmercs cost more to operate than a navy of your own costs to
maintain, at every unit size. You pay the premium because you only
pay the starmerc when you need him,. you pay the navy all the time.
I make three to five times as much per hour when I freelance for a few
hours than I make an hour when I\'m at my place of usual employ.
If you own a navy, then lose it, the operating fund for that navy isn\'t going
to replace it for a very, very long time.

The new government of Colchis tried some short-term, piecemeal
solutions (we have enough MCr to hire one Starmerc ship. Oops, he
got blown up. OK, we just got enough MCr together to hire another
one. Hmmm, he hasn\'t come back either...). Eventually, one of their
representatives made a plea that was heard at a Navy base, and 
something better than starmercs showed up - Imperial Destroyer Escorts.
For the corsairs of Colchis, that was the end - those who weren\'t caught
fled for far subsectors and some continued the only thing they thought
they could do, piracy.

I was painting an unusual, short-term situation that could not (and did
not) last. One of the after-effects of the coup on Colchis was the
creation of a small starship flotilla, crewed by embittered men and
outlawed by both their homeworld and the Imperium. Modify the details
to make it work, I was trying to develop an idea as to one possible source
of illegal ship-takers.

The big one for me is incidental and non-combat damage takes PC\'s out
too fast.  For example, in a brawl characters should be able to take a
few punches to various body parts without falling down dead.  ;-> So,
I\'d like the damage capacity to be high, but have a secondary factor
that comes into play for certain kinds and amounts damage.  Let\'s say,
on cutting and penetrating attacks that do more than 5 points of
damage the possibility of continuing damage exists from shock and
bleeding.

Nope, and I don\'t have dozens of d10\'s, like I do d6\'s.  ;-> I really
want to stay with an xD6+y model for damage.

I don\'t think changing HP is the way to go, as I mentioned above.
Another idea I\'ve tinkered with is having a second damage track for
Systemic damage (knockout, shock, bleeding, etc).

Take a look at the one I posted using the total pips.  Using the pips

I believe the concept you are looking for is called"Hydrostatic Shock."  Its
been a while since I read anything about
this.  IIRC, is has to do with the fact that the human body is mostly
water, by mass.  A shot to the torso can cause general systemic
shock, i.e., temporary unconcsciousness, usually of very short
duration, although that can vary.

I can\'t vouch for my sources as I don\'t recall them.

Having said that, even current body armor does a great deal to minimize
the damage.  I saw last year a new type of body armor that is amazing.
The maker of if, shot himself in the belly with a 357 Magnum Revolver.
The body armor stuffing, \'puffed\' out from where the bullet struck.
But the man was only knocked back a step and mildly winded.
Of course, he was braced, but still amazing results.

[snip]

> Does this make sense to anybody else?

Yes, generally.  I don\'t play TNE but your points are well taken.About the
reduction of attributes, I agree and like that T4, etc.
reduce specific attributes.  But I think that there ought to be
some reduction in effective intelligence or education (for skill tests only),
as a result of Stress, Shock, Fatigue, etc.  I know that I can\'t recite
pi to the 4th digit after being on the bottom of a rugby scrum.  I know
the answer but getting the old noodle to kick out the correct answer
is a bit difficult.

I wonder if Marc is going to revise combat for T4.1?

At Close Quarters is nearing completion, and hopefully will be published by

I need people who will actually playtest the thing.  Not ask me for the

It has something to do with supersonic waves in the circulatory

I can talk from personal experience about being knocked out...once
from a kick to the head, once from a blow to the chest, twice from
having the "wind knocked out of me" and three times from heat
exhaustion...yeah, I must have low END, but I\'m not that atypical. 
;-> In each case, I was only *out* for a few seconds, but I can tell
you I wasn\'t worth much for the next hour or two afterwards.  Without
any doubt in my mind, a 9mm to the chest would drop me like a rock,
maybe not instantly, but within seconds just from a shock reaction.

Oh, I agree about body armor (on a theoretical level, not having

Absolutely!  Most people just don\'t think all that clearly after
taking a blow, especially to the head.

But we have meat works shutting down through lack of 
work, and timber mills doing likewise. It\'s what New 
Zealand has specialised at for 100 years.
 
I\'m not sure that it is cheaper to sell meat live - it\'s quite 
a difficult thing to ship sheep to Saudi Arabia without 
losing 30% of them to travel stress en-route.

Not at all, America does such things by delcaring things 
"munitions" and preventing those products from being 
exported. (Can you spell PGP?) 

New Zealand also has (had?) laws about many fruits 
requiring that they can/could only be sold overseas 
through the National marketing board. The theory was 
that our producers would be prevented from competing 
with each other, thus guaranteeing higher prices for 
everyone rather than dropping the price as far as possible.

Not exactly. Due to  some barely understood process (by 
me anyway) you need to have male and female plants to 
produce fruit, and the seeds from the fruit produce only 
female (This is from long ago memory, and may be 
incorrect.)  - there was something strange about them 
which meant we had to ship out "breeding pairs" to screw 
up our monopoly, so we did.

In my copy it\'s page 198 column 3, about half way down 
under a subhead "Quick Kill:" (Note that I have 2nd Ed, 
Rev 1 - I don\'t know if that\'s important. It bugs me that 
they changed a number of important things in rev 1, and 
the only way you\'ll know is if you read the fine print on 
page 4, or have an argument about how many skills your

It seems to me that the problem then is the difference 
between damage weapons do and damage that punch 
ups and falls do is not different enough. It doesn\'t matter 
how many HP you have, one of the problems will still be 
there. Perhaps you need a shock system, where if you 
get damaged you have a chance of fallking down and 
being uninterested in much for 20 minutes or so.

I can see that. A well aimed hand gun is more dangerous 
than a poorly aimed rifle...

What is means, IMTU, is that roughly 1 in 20 encounters will be with craft
with piratically inclined crews, and interaction is dependant upon local
SysNavy, ImpNavy, and IISS forcelevels, local laws, crew and skipper
attitude de jur morale, and apparent weakness of the craft encountering
them... and only some 3-5% of pirate encounters result in hostility to the
encountering vessel, barring unforseen PC actions (like opening fire for no
reason... had some do that... not even to "Pirate" entires... Gave me an
excuse to execute them for Treason, when they shot down a subsector duke\'s

Must be, because it isn\'t in my copy of TW2K, 2nd Ed., <sigh> second

Actually, it\'s possible that like the existing ACVs that have "main
guns" they may not even *have* a turret. As with an ACV (Air Cushion
Vehicle) turning the entire vehicle should be quick enough to be worth
eliminating all the hassles that a turret adds to a design. For one
thing, it\'d enable a much heavier weapon.

And if they *don\'t* have turrets, then they don\'t have the slipstream
problems when turning it (instead they have other problems).

BTW, if grav tanks *do* fly at any sort of altitude, they *can\'t* have
thin "belly" or "roof" armor. Which raises the cost. It also makes the
likely shapes *far* different from what has been shown. 

Frankly, I expect that the optimal shape will be a spheroid or oviod of
some sort. Small blisters for secondary weapons, and the main weapon is
fixed, but the tank can spin about any axis rapidly *while moving*, and
the shape would prevent airflow problems. 

After all, the reason tanks are so *flat* is so that they can hide
behind things. Grav tanks don\'t appear to use that tactic much. Or if
they *do, then we are back to thinner top and bottom armor, and they
wouldn\'t *dare* fly at any sort of altitude.

Please note that there are vehicles, and there are *vehicles*. The
Germans had artillery pieces that were mounted on some pretty massive
"vehicles" (like multiple railrod cars). 

And in any case, a *fixed* meson gun site can still pick off grav tanks
like flies.

Don\'t count on this. There have been real world prposals for kinetic
kill munitions deployed from orbit as tank killers, and in larger
versions ship and bunker/silo killers.

It\'s not that hard to design your "flying crowbar" (for tanks) or
"flying telephone pole" (for bigger targets) to survive renentry. The
*hard* part is the guidance/sensor package.

Or in the "flying crowbar" case, you need to get it *before* it
impacts. And at 11+ km/sec, you don\'t have a lot of time. Luckily, they
can\'t dodge worth beans. On the other claw, they tend to come in
bunches.

PAWs in atmosphere are a royal pain. And like high powered lasers, they
make counter battery fire *easy*. In both cases you have this striaght
line of ionized air point back at the weapon. Take two shots from the
same location, but at different targets (or at a single, *moving*
target) and the enemy will have your position *nailed*. And they\'ll
drop a present on it ASAP. 

With meson guns, that means that lasers and PAWS don\'t *dare* make more
than one shot without moving.

assuming you set it up right, it should run OK for stuff for a 25mhz 386...
but don\'t expect any better than 50% of your system speed. A few (doing
run-time pre-compile type emulation) achieve up to 90%, but I don\'t know
about the specifics. I know that I ran Herobase useably on a Color Classic
(68030, 25mhz) at useable speeds under SoftPC.

I KNOW soft PC works well. In any case, make certain thet whatever MS-DOs
Emulator has the following: a speed control option; PPC Native code; easy
emulation of hardware options (the one failure, imo, of many emulators).

BTW, slightly off topic, on a 33mhz 68040 mac, the freeware CP/M emulator
runs so fast I can\'t follow the cursor on the games... and it also lacks a
spedd restrictor setting...

Actually, the meson as a weapon system, IMO & IMTU, is non-prevalent due to
extensive fire control reasons... like the difficulty of bracketing targets
with  the fire. Unlike all other DF weapons, it is not a 2-D fire solution,
but 3-D... you have to get the fire into the target\'s volume. The bigger,
the easier. SO small 10-20 Td craft are hard to hit, simply because you\'re
trying to put a 20m shere to intersect with a 20m^3 target, which is moving
and maneuvering. If trying to do this while in a moveing and maneuvering
vehicle, computation becomes the problem... and computerized or automated
fire control becomes required. So, due to the problems, and the
psyychological factor of Fusion and Plasma Guns, MBT\'s are MBT\'s, not Meson
Carriers.... Meson arty fires from a standstil, primarily for radiation
effects over infantry.

OTOH, IMTU, certain elite marine boarders use Meson Battle Dress. MBD has a
1 damage Meson with the smallest FF&S1 TL14 Beam pointer, and a 48hour
duration...I posted it about 3 years ago... then promptly lost the design
specs. In any case, a platoon rides a NADS (Non-atmospheric drop shuttle)
and heads for the surface of capitol ships, doing key weapon destruction on
a pinpoint basis. I figure 4 reinforced regiments of these per sector (1
Battalion per subsector).

Rather than do that, why not simply make non-computerized fire EXTREMELY
difficult... I use +4 diffmod for hand aimed, +2 for OMFC w/o computer, and
+2 if no beam ptr... And since most man-pack and small craft sized meson
guns (under FF&S1) did very little damage, they aren\'t that bad. A Fusion
gun is a better conversion of energy to damage, As I Recall.

non-intrusive, especially if you limit it to "Soft Targets"-Living critters.

Additionally, to maintain the one shot kill chance, but allow a 1 shot
stop, make one roll: if
	Roll <= DICE of damage			Autokill
	Roll <= PIPS of damage rolled		Autodrop
I\'ve used this; it sort of works.

Another way is to allow aimed shots at close range to add user skill to
damage value (in dice). Or to add skill level to each individual d6 rolled.
I have tried the latter... made it QUITE lethal with heavy MG\'s.

As for systemic damage, I simply apply an ammount toalling half of the

The nicer thing about MT is that you don\'t apply fresh damage to attributes
until the adrenaline wears off.... and many "One shot stops" in MT wind up
being flesh wounds that heal in a few days. Many "Combat kills" in MT
survive. While I really do prefer the TNE CGen, I much prefer MT\'s combat

over "Damage Rating".

Eris, 

On issue I have with TNE is that in the version that I have is that no
matter what your skill with firearms you have 15% chance of missing.

Doug,

When you went thru sniper school would they have passed you if you missed
15% of the time?
I have talked to some VN era snipers that I have contact with and they only
had a 15% or worst chance of missing only under extremely difficult
conditions.

My view leans towards the fat attack helicopter school.  The main weapon
fixed, with hardpoints for various ordinance, and a secondary weapon for
soft targets.  Add on a point-defence laser.

IMTU, I keep tanks close to the ground simply because it\'s cheaper to use a
hillside for armor than to armor up a tank to that level.  Tanks use
pop-ups, concentration of force, and extensive EW/ECM to close with and
destroy the enemy.

Which we already have. And BTW selling sheep live overseas required new
infrastucture to be put in, becuase the sheep, being live need to be fed,
watered, etc.

However in one of the few bright move in New Zealand\'s exporting history we
have now reached a deal with Chile (who is one of our bigger trading
partners) whereby we help their dairy industry in exhange for a chunk of
it. This allows us to launder cheese, etc through Chile and export it to
the US as part of Chile\'s quota. I belive this has produced a number of
unhappy people in the US.

Just make it illegal to export cuttings, seed, etc. This would make it hard
to export enough to make the venture profitable.

However the seed need not be fertile.

My way around that is to rule that a shot by an undetected sniper is not
really \'in combat\' so the auto-miss is on a 20 only, not 17-20.

There is a missile produced by Shorts Bros., and in consideration by the US
DoD, called Starstreak.  It consists of a bus vehicle and three kinetic
kill darts.  IIRC, it has been available since the late 80\'s or early 90\'s.

I actually found it quite entertaining.  The movie is nearly 2 1/2 hours
long and I found myself pretty much engrossed in the movie to the point
that I really didn\'t notice the time go by.

It\'s not as scientifically accurate as "Deep Impact" (although, IMHO,
*both* movies take a number of liberties in this regard), but much more
entertaining overall.  The acting and characters were a bit more enjoyable
to watch as well (and, no, I\'m not talking strictly about Liv Tyler).

Rupert,

Well it works for that situation but it still does not resolve the issue ie
a skill level 15 handgun expert with a attribute of 15 skill misses on
17-20. I personally know of some individuals who are not at those levels of
skill and attribute tier miss rate is less than 5% under combat handgun
range conditions.

But did not the American sniper?? ie Sergeant York during WWI have miss
rate less than 20% being "fighting the trenches" would be what I call
combat conditions in my book. IIRC he achieved a kill for every shot using
a iron sights, yes the first few shots, his location was undetected but not
the last few shots.

  Well, specialized pieces like that are more nearly equivalent to planetary

or special use interdiction artillery).

  True, but it requires that the Striker meson gun "indirect" firing rules
be changed - not necessarily a bad idea, either. Anything much larger than
the S:B 3 unit (particularly if using power plants below TL 15) will cost
as much as an entire company or more of tank destroyers if mobile, and still
require both spotters and advantageous (although possibly realistic) new
rules to make it a desirable general deployment item.

uniform containers in stacks to the roof, with some aisle space and possibly
an area for sorting/loading (some have already been removed).

  The landing site (with facilities) is on the edge of a large body of water,
presumably so that defective vessels that undershoot won\'t leave visible scars
to upset future travellers :)

  This would be way cool; if the prices weren\'t too much out of line with
their last products then I\'d buy them all simply for completeness.

  Global Games "Legions of Steel" is a squad level SF skirmish game (with
a Stalingrad playtest version on their web-site) - the metal figure version
of the basic boxed set includes 19 figures with a total (& reasonable) retail
value exceeding the boxes\' price - includes 25mm compatible room & deck
geomorphs.

  Remember, if you mail-order LoS stuff from Canada (<www.imphobbies.com>,
<www.sentrybox.com>) you\'re paying (for lead figs) the same price as US
stores sell the pewter ones for - and the Canadian dollar is worth only
two-thirds of yours :(

  Stone Mountain is great stuff, and they may have their web site up by now (?).

  Remember, if retailers (& distributors) are going to stock any new RAFM
Traveller release (and unrelated generics won\'t be stocked, frankly) then
it would help greatly if we go out and ask for them to get any _old_ RAFM
TNE figs they can for us to buy first; distributors like interest in a new
line, but they\'ve got to be rid of the old stuff first.

  OK, so Pinochet had an image problem :), but he wasn\'t a US puppet. Now,
consider the acceptable outcomes of covert ops in the 3-I, which doesn\'t
even pay lip service to concepts like human rights, equality, democracy
(or any political rights) _at the planetary level_.

  Sure, if you can get offworld and convince an Imperial recruiter that
you\'re a wonderful human being then you\'ve an in to all sorts of rights
and privileges (not the least being that they\'ll take great exception to
anyone but they or their designated opponents physically damaging you),
but for the most part they consider labour camps and hit squads as quaint
customs - as long as you keep them local.

The Iron Duke Class were one of the earlest examples of the classic Terran
Ship of the Line and even though it was a rapidly outclassed in terms of both
size and power, the class exhibits most of the common features of the type;
the large spinal particle accelerator, wedge hull form, extreme automation to
reduce the crew requirements, extensive backup electronics and a heavy point
defence laser battery. The Iron Dukes were designed shortly after the end of
the 1st Interstellar War and formed the backbone of the Terran fleet during
the 2nd War and early 3rd War. In total 257 examples of the class were built,
and though the class suffered heavily with the wholesale scrappings that
followed the 3rd War, some examples survived in auxilary roles for many
years. The longest serving was the Hiei which survived as a colonial guard
ship at Hades until 2402AD.

The most famous example of the class was the Agamemnon on which the
mysterious Lord Nelson incident occured. The Agamemnon was a reserve 
squadron
flagship during the critical Battle of Junction in 2152AD. During the battle
the Vilani broke through the Terran line and attacked the reserve; and the
Agamemnon was struck by a spread of Vilani missiles which damaged the 
ships
control systems and killed or injured most of the bridge crew. At this point
the "ghost" of Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson (1758AD - 1805AD) "appeared" on
the ships bridge. He exhorted the crew to attack the Vilani centre. The
senior officer (Leftenant Pi Yu) choose to follow this course of action,
against all naval doctrine of the time. The result was that against all
expectations the reserve smashed the Vilani breakthrough and turned the tide
of the battle in the Terrans favour.

The incident has thus far defied explanation. The ship\'s internal bridge
sensors were offline due to battle damage at the time, so no accurate
independent record exists, but the incident was confirmed after the battle by
the Agamemnon\'s surviving bridge crew (some 17 individuals). It is known that
the ship\'s jump grid had accidentally discharged due to the damage sustained.
The most commonly accepted explanation is a mass hysterical delusion
brought on by combat stress and the jump grid discharge; however the incident
still remains a tantalising mystery and is the subject of much popular
debate.

The Agamemnon herself suffered severe damage during the battle, and though
she was repaired, she was never again employed in frontline service. She
served as a convoy escort until the end of the 3rd War and was then assigned
as a colonial guardship at Midway until 2172AD when she was designated as 
an
escort for the long range colonisation program. The Agamemnon left for the
Rim in 2177AD and her ultimate fate is unknown.

I noticed that in my version, too. ;->  Is it different in the Mk1?

IAC, in play, I *forget* that line entirely.  A natural 20 is a
guaranteed miss, and I\'m not entirely happy with a guaranteed 5% miss.

I don\'t know what you\'re talking about! <wink> That rule must have

There\'s an interesting point in there, beside the main one that a 20%
guaranteed miss rate for all shooters at all ranges strains
credibility.

In TNE attributes aren\'t supposed to get above 13, IIRC, and I can\'t
recall ever having seen a skill level 15 at anything on any
character\'s sheet.  It seems looking back over some old sheets that in
TNE professional level assets were generally in the range of 12 to 14.
Occasionally, they got to 16 to 18, but I don\'t recall anything higher
than that.  My players and I always spread the skills out too much to
get levels in any one skill much above 6.

Were we an atypical bunch?  Was it a common occurance to get skill
levels into double digits in your games?

The Herectic has a strained credibility?<G>. But I also agree with the above.

Ooops sorry was thinking of T4 skills and attributes.....
Ok change that to a skill of 6 and attribute of 12.

No my players did just great with single digit skills and double digits
attributes except for the Vargr who used a pistol with no skill in handgun
and had a low attribute for it. He even had other PC\'s load more ammo into
when it ran out. Most of the time they were loath to do so.<G>

But my players for the most part had a large tactics pool isn\'t that right

Well you could say that on a 20 you miss unless it a well aimed
braced/rested shot from an undetected position by the target.

Yeah, you could "munch" your way up to there in T4, one dimensional

That\'s more like it.  Still an attribute of 12 is pretty rare in TNE,
1/36 plus a +2G homeworld if I\'m not mistaken.  Personally, I let the
players distribute points within the range of 3 to 9, and being a
heretic they distribute 50 among 8 attributes.

Yeah, there may be a case for a 20% guaranteed miss for hand guns and

5%.

I\'m wondering how "easy" it\'d be to make an "opposed landing" against a
planet liberally equipped with the equivalent of the Sprint ABM system.

This puppy accelerated at around 100g. It was two stage and the second
stage ignited almost as soon as it cleared the launcher. While they
were to be equipped with nuclear warheads so as to make "near misses"
into kills, in testing they wound up having to "detune" the tracking as
otherwise they\'d have had the sprints *colliding* with the incoming
warheads (which would have resulted in the remains of both landing where
the Russians could have salvaged them). 

Anyway, the poor attack force would have to shoot down dozens of the
long range ABMs, enough that they\'d probably figure that they were
through the defenses. Then when they get down to a mile or two, the
Sprints would get fired. Even TL15 point defenses would have trouble
then.

Actually, shock can set in from really *trivial* things. For example, I
got shocky and almost passed out when I had my ear pierced. No idea
*why*, but it happened. 

BTW, from my experience a lot of people get "shocky" and don\'t
*realize* that they are in shock. I only know what it feels like
because one time a nurse friend *told* me I was in shock.

A few years back we had an idiot get drunk with friends in his Bow
Hunting group. They tried the "William Tell" bit with a beercan on his
head. They missed the can and he wound up with a broadhead *hunting*
arrow thru one of his eyes and clear to the back of his skull.

Believe it or not, they got him to the hospital and the arrow was
removed. Aside from losing an eye, he survived with no ill effects!
And no, this *isn\'t* a urban legend, I can scan the article from the
paper and I recall the TV news coverage. The guy has even done some
anti-drunkeness ads. 

Try getting players to believe *that* one!

Most of the characters in our group were generally oriented towards one
skill area (Engineering had the engineering skill, Mechanical, etc.) and
several other lower level skills.  We generally had one or two individuals
that had fairly high tactics skill.  We generally had no problem taking on
the small fleets and small armies, but we generally had a harder time
against the lone Aslan gunman (gunalsan?).  He nearly wiped us out single
handedly.

The Vargr.  I don\'t remember where he came up with that revolver, but even
with a 0 skill level he was deadly with it.  Unfortunately, it was
generally us he was hitting.  We got to where we would load it and duck
behind him and find cover, generally a couple blocks behind him with a
couple of buildings for cover.

The US imports things from other parts of the same planet, not another
planet (except maybe a few moon rocks :P ). The way I see it is with a
populated enough planet (a couple billion or so) then there would be little
need to import raw materials and stuff from other planets, just novelty
items and such.

Yeah, like the 80cm Gustav. When assembled the equipment was 140 feet
(42.79m) long 23 feet (7.01m) wide and 116 feet (38m) high and weighed 1350
tonnes (1329 tons). It fired a 4.7 ton (4800 kg) High explosive shell out to
29 miles (47 km) or a 7 ton (7100 kg) concrete piercing shell out to 24
miles (38 km).
Although not the largest calibre gun ever built Gustav was certainly the
largest artillery equipment in history.
Gustav was fired during the siege of Sevastopol.

There have been documented cases of police in shootouts that burned off 2 full
*clips* at a perp in a gunfight & failed to hit.  These police were pretty
decent shots on the range.

Other statistics support the 15% guaranteed miss (or actually a higher
miss rate.)  In WW II it took some 200+ rounds of ammunition to cause
one casualty in infantry combat.  Even considering suppression fire
that\'s pretty bad.

The 5% miss rate comes from "range" conditions which don\'t simulate
panic, adrenaline or real bullets flying back at the shooter.  History
and the news are full of gunfights where a 20% miss rate was several
times better than the real miss rate.

Leonard,

Have you or anyone else built any atmospheric KKMs under FFS2 rules ?

If they can be built so that they have high enough speed to make
laser-based point defense systems usable, then I\'ll have a think about them.

Steve (or should I say Comrade Hudson),

It appears that you have not been keeping up with your ideology sessions.
Whilst the Early Works are valuable and provide useful insights, they are
not definitive - the most recent works to come out of the Central Committee
(in this case FFS2) should be regarded as definitive. We should not fall
into Gloranthaism, where the oldest resources are regarded as the most
definitive (unless Gregged at a later date).

Oh, I\'m not saying that all shots should have a 5% miss rate.  I\'m
just objecting to a *guaranteed* 20% miss rate.  ;-> For most PC\'s it
isn\'t going to come into play that much, only for aimed shots and for
*very* highly skilled PC\'s.

For quick shots, the most common kind, and given an Asset of 14, which
is pretty high, and firing at stationary target the chance to hit is
70% chance at Short range, 35% chance at Medium range, and 15% chance
at Long range.

For aimed shots, using the 20% miss the numbers are 80% Short, 70%
Medium, 35% Long and 15% Extreme.  My way would be 95% Short and the
same for the others. 

Too high?  Maybe, but it makes close combat more deadly, and I like
that.

Exactly, range conditions are the optimum environment. Imagine your
character walks out of their favourite night-spot and round the corner comes
into contact with a bunch of hoods... This ain\'t a range, this is an alley,
the targets are trying to put a knife in you, aim, or shoot, or club them
with the lump of metal in your fist.

People who have carefully read the first two parts may have realised that
the economically optimal place to put a colony will not neccessarily be
optimal from a point of view of habitability. (1)

The rules in part one essentially assume that colonies will be
self-supporting. This is not necessarily the case, which brings us to the
next part ...

Eat in or take away ?

A common assumption among Traveller players is that food will not be a
major export or import for worlds. However, for worlds that would otherwise
have to spend substantial amounts on complex artificial life support
systems, importing food from a world with an active biosphere actually
makes economic sense.

Proof : Assume interest rates are at 3%, transport costs are Cr 1000 per
parsec, and life support capital costs are as per FFS errata. Assume our
colony has a choice between building a VB class life support system -
closed loop with fresh fruit and vegetables, or staying with a class IV
life support, and importing actual food. Assume people need 2 kilos of food
per day.

In the first case, a capital investment of KCr 200 per colonist is
required, over and above the class IV life support system (which needs to
be bought to add a class V system on to anyway). At 3% interest, this
represents an annual cost of about KCr 6 - if you didnt have to do it, you
could save KCr 6 a year in interest on the smaller capital cost of
establishing the colony.

In the second case, the type IV system sees to air and water recycling, and
only food needs to be imported. 2 kilos of food per day is approximatly 700
kg per year, or one half of a displacement ton. Assuming the food itself
costs KCr 2 per displacement ton, then it could be shipped for up to 4
parsecs at a very high KCr 1 per parsec shipping cost until the breakeven
point between growing and importing is met. There are very few worlds more
than four parsecs from a world with any sort of biosphere.

Of course, if interstellar trade gets disrupted and freight costs skyrocket
(due to an outbreak of war, for example), then a colony will have to draw
down on it\'s accumulated food reserves (a couple of hundred displacement
tons of emergency rations is an excellent investment for a belter colony).

Three Hundred Thousand Ardalopeburgers for Arbuthot IV ... 

The game effect of living with food imports is that a world gets a
Infrastructure rating for export purposes of 50% higher than otherwise, but
has to ensure a high enough level of shipping into the system to import one
half of a displacement ton off food per citizen per year, at a cost of KCr
3 per ton plus shipping cost (2).

This can lead to an excellent relationship between two new colonies - the
one with the biosphere can be the granary for the one with the toxic
atmosphere and hard-currency exports.

(1) Note that every world and worldlet can and probably should be surveyed,
and a special success on any of these rolls reveals an economically
exploitable export resource - i.e. a place you can use the export sector
rules in part two. You wont always get this success roll on the planet you
might otherwise want to colonise.

(2) The FFS rules on how long food lasts in storage are a bit pessimistic.
Carefully chosen TL1 foods can easily last for a year with moderatly
careful storage, and some of them even taste good. Grain, dates, dried
fruits and salted meat come to mind.

BEYOND THE EXTENTS
Campaign Introduction
by Carlos Alos-Ferrer

 The following is a transcription of a recorded report by Eneri
 Thaynei, dated 2,707 Unified Calendar.

 Good morning, fellow sophont. I know you feel disorientated, but do
 not worry. It is just an after-effect of a poorly maintained
 hypersleep. For the moment being, let us concentrate on some simple
 facts. You are in a hospital bed, staring at the screen of a monitor,
 which is displaying my image.

 Who am I? My name is Sir Eneri Thaynei, and I am an Imperial Knight,
 although this rank is now irrelevant, for reasons that will be
 obvious in a few minutes.

 To help you order your thoughts, let us focus on the last things that
 you should remember. For whatever the reason, you were in the
 starport of one of the few loyal worlds of Lishun sector in late
 1,120. Maybe you even remember the name of the world. An airless moon
 of a gas giant. If you do, it is a good signal. If you don\'t, it will
 come later, and then you will know that your disorientation is
 vanishing.

 I have said a loyal world. Loyal to our glorious Emperor Lucan, of
 course. But things were getting quite hot there, with those
 treacherous Vilani, not to speak of the Vargr hordes. And these were
 the real problem for us. More concretely, the problem came from the
 corsair attack that destroyed the main colony and left the starport
 in chaos. The life support system was heavily damaged, and over one
 thousand of us, stranded at the remains of the starport, faced a
 certain death in a few weeks, at the very best.

 But we managed. Fortunately, one of the ships on-planet at the time
 of the attack was a huge colonial transport. We cannibalized the
 starport and the other damaged ships, and brought it back to life
 just in time. We installed in it every single low berth that we could
 find, and went into hypersleep. One thousand two hundred and
 seventy-two  passengers, plus a presumably capable crew. They should
 have brought us back to safe imperial space in  a few weeks.

 They failed miserably. I do not know what happened, because there is
 no hint of where the crew could be, but we are not in imperial space.
 The bad news are that, apparently, we headed for the Vargr Extents.
 The good news are that we surpassed them. We are... beyond the
 extents.

 I can see that you do not believe me. You have noticed human doctors
 and nurses around by now, so we should be in some civilized place.
 Well, the place is civilized, rest assured, but don\'t try to talk to
 the doctors. They do not speak galanglic. Neither galanglic, nor high
 Vilani. Nothing that you could understand. Fortunately, one of their
 languages is close to galanglic (although phonetically twisted in a
 strange way), so you will be able to communicate in a month. At
 least, that is what it took to me. With help, it can be quicker for
 you.

 In fact, maybe you have also seen some Vargr doctor. Do not worry,
 this is a multi-racial society. There are four human species around,
 plus two Vargr races (Urzaeng and Suedzuk, in case you care), and
 several other alien races. Some will be familiar, some will not.

 What was I saying? Oh, yes, beyond the extents. From astrographical
 observations, I believe that we are one or two sectors coreward of
 Dfotseth sector, that is, around six or seven sectors away from
 imperial space. And, incidentally, beyond the edge of charted space
 as we know it. Interesting, isn\'t it?

 I cannot blame you if you do not believe me. I myself wish it was not
 true, but it is. You have my word. And you will be able to check it
 by yourself in the next weeks.

 You are confused. Please remain with me. This will help you to
 understand your new situation.

 How comes there are humans here, if we are outside of known space?
 This is a long story, but I will try to offer you a summary.

 We have to go a bit back on history. Do you remember your history
 lessons? The Vilani human race established the First Imperium, then
 they met the terrrans, who conquered them and created the Second
 Imperium, which collapsed and was followed by a Long Night of almost
 two millennia, which ended with the birth of our glorious Third
 Imperium more than one thousand years ago, the same Imperium which is
 nowadays shattered by the Rebellion against our Emperor Lucan... got
 it? Good. We only need the two first empires.

 The Second Imperium, or the Rule of Man, collapsed in -1,776. At
 least, that\'s what the history books say. Actually, this date was
 decided by the historians afterwards. The fall was a centuries-long
 process. Thus, it is not surprising that some clever people were able
 to foresee what was coming.

 Two such people were a retired terran admiral called Joseph Tyrrell
 and a Geonee industrial called Brud Ardashee (The Geonee, in case you
 don\'t know, are a minor human race native to Massilia sector).
 Together, these two clever people organized a huge expedition with
 over one hundred TL-12, Jump-3 starships, thousands of colonists of
 terran, Geonee, and even Vilani origin. This should have been
 something.

 The Tyrrell-Ardashee Expedition should transport all these colonists
 beyond the boundaries of the collapsing Rule of Man. More concretely,
 to the Empire of Gashikan, a human-dominated state in the middle of
 the Vargr Extents, seceded from the rule of Man in -1,666. A
 promising place, indeed. Unfortunately, when the expedition arrived
 in Gashikan in -1,658, Gashikan itself had been sacked by Vargr
 Suedzuk and the whole sector was in the middle of a race war. Not a
 promising place to found a new home.

 Admiral Tyrrell and his Geonee companion decided to continue farther
 away, in search of an appropriate area, beyond the Vargr Extents if
 necessary.

 It was necessary. Three years later, they left the extents and
 arrived in a sector that they named New Hope. Pay attention. This is
 the name of the sector you are in now.

 In New Hope, they found some Vargr, specially of the Urzaeng race
 (stronger than other Vargr, but no so clever), but also alien races
 native to the sector, and a cluster of worlds in the hands of the
 Hhkar mystery race (a reptilian race, scattered along known and,
 apparently, unknown space). But, more important, they found humans.
 There is a minor human race native to this sector, the Retani. Left
 behind by the Ancients in a world called Retan, they had obtained
 jump technology from Vargr traders half a millennium before. By the
 time the Tyrrell-Ardashee Expedition arrived, the Retani already
 controlled a dozen of worlds.

 The colonists settled down. A few years later, several waves of
 Suedzuk Vargr arrived in the sector, probably displaced from the
 massive interstellar conflicts originated after the Sack of Gashikan.
 Wars between the Suedzuk, the Urzaeng, and the humans, fostered
 cooperation between the Retani and the technologically more advanced
 expeditionaries. Around seventy years later, the Three Races Alliance
 was founded, encompassing the Retani worlds, a world colonized by the
 terrans, called Nawarth (by the way, the word "Solomani" is unknown
 here), and a Geonee world, called Ardashee. These alliance
 established a Unified Calendar based on the terran one, a unified
 economic system, and several other important things.

 Let us stop for a minute. There is a unified calendar. Today is the
 year 2,707 UC. But I cannot tell you which Imperial year it is. The
 Tyrrell-Ardashee expedition arrived here in -1,655 Imperial, but a
 lot of things have happened in the meanwhile and there are no clear
 historical records to establish exactly which UC date was this. The
 most accepted theory places it around -74 CU, which would place the
 current Imperial date in 1,126. Probably, the Rebellion is over and
 our emperor Lucan has already brought the Imperium to a new era of
 prosperity. But, according to other theories, it could have been as
 late as -50 CU or as soon as -150 CU. this places the actual imperial
 date between 1,102 and 1,202. We know that we left in 1,122, so it
 cannot be sooner than that, but the other date... well, this is
 irrelevant for us right now, but, hell, I would like to know which
 year is it.

 Anyway, let us go back to our history. Let me have a look at my
 notes, I want to give you a feeling of how different history is here.
 In year 0 UC, the Alliance of the Three Races was founded. A lot of
 things have happened since that. Wars with the Vargr were a constant.
 The Alliance fell eventually, and the three races (Retani, terrans,
 Geonee) followed different paths. The Retani were even absorbed by a
 Vargr state, the Ruganz Empire, based on a world called Dzorg, which
 is important today. When this empire fell, the sector experienced
 something similar to the Long Night, which they call "First
 Interreign". Ironically, the expeditionaries escaped the Long Night,
 but their descendants didn\'t.

 This Interreign finished with the birth of the Four Races Alliance,
 which included some Vargr worlds, in 1,367 UC. But a minor alien
 race, the Danak, rebelled, the government of the Alliance was taken
 over by a group of Admirals, and in 1,753 the Second Interreign
 started.

 Two hundred years ago, this "second long night" ended with the
 creation of a new political entity, called the Federation of the
 Races. Only two hundred years ago. This Federation is quite young,
 and not really consolidated, I would say. It started with Retan,
 Nawarth, Ardashee, and Dzorg. Today, it encompasses 32 worlds. Not
 eleven thousand, just 32. It has reached TL 13,  and maintains firm
 border policies against Vargr corsairs and the unpredictable Hhkar
 raids.

 It has been already two months since the terrans awakened me, and I
 have already realized that this sector is full of wonders, mysteries,
 and dangers. To mention only a few, there are constant conflicts
 between the Vargr states, the Federation, and the Hhkar, the Danak
 still refuse to join the Federation, there is a strange "infestation"
 of unknown origin which attacks dozens of ships per year, far traders
 are bringing back stories of huge battles between unknown races
 coreward... Also, the Federation itself is not very peaceful. Several
 balkanized worlds are in civil war at the moment. The big
 Corporations have private armies and apparently use them. And you can
 surely imagine the racial tensions, but the social ones are even
 worse.

 In summary, quite a lively place. I think I like it.

 You are probably losing patience by now. I am sorry, I really wanted
 to talk about this. But now, I should go back to the questions that
 you have in mind.

 The first is probably: How the hell have we arrived here?

 Unfortunately, I don\'t know. Apparently, our starship was found,
 unmanned, in one of the asteroid belts of the Federation. The
 automatic systems still worked, and were keeping us alive, but we
 could have been there one week or one year. No way to know. The
 starship was badly damaged, and, anyway, the authorities will not let
 us examine it. It\'s high tech for them, you know. It has already been
 dismantled and sent to several dozens of laboratories for study.

 My first hypothesis was that we misjumped, but now I find it quite
 improbable. The maximum previously reported length for a misjump was
 less than 40 parsecs, I think, and we are at almost 300 parsecs from
 our original location. Our ship must have been through a very
 interesting history. Maybe it was seized by Vargr corsairs who
 brought us to the extents for some reason. Maybe something weirder
 than a misjump happened. I do not know. This is another mystery that
 I hope we will be able to solve. By the way, of the original one
 thousand two hundred and seventy-two passengers, only six hundred and
 forty of us arrived here. We have the corpses of two hundred more,
 deceased due to unfortunate malfunctions. The rest just disappeared.
 A part of them even disappeared with their low berths. Puzzling.

 Now to your second question: What are we going to do here?

 Going back is discarded, for the moment being. We have no ship, and
 the Federation is not going to give us one. Besides, I see no real
 reason to risk my life traveling through the Vargr Extents, to go
 back to a Third Imperium which might still be at war, or maybe to
 find out that seventy years have passed by and nobody knows who I am.
 I recommend you to discard any ideas about going back. At least, get
 yourself a ship first, and wait until we have a better estimate for
 the date.

 After our discovery, the Federation authorities awakened two
 subjects, and those turned out to be me and Professor Borthan, an
 academic which you will meet at some moment. We spent a month trying
 to communicate, but, as I told you, one of the terran languages here
 is similar to galanglic. After that, we have been discussing with the
 Federation authorities. Some people, specially Retani, wanted to
 classify the whole matter and get all of us indefinitely quarantined,
 but, in the end, thanks to terran sympathies, we convinced the key
 people not to do so. Our existence has been made public, but people
 is not paying any real attention to us, we are just a society note.
 There are far more important things going on in the Federation.

 We have reached an agreement with the Federation. We all are going to
 be given Federation citizenship. For a month, you will be taught one
 local language and will be given time to get adapted to this new
 environment. Then, you will be thoroughly interviewed. I ask for your
 cooperation. The Federation is interested primarily in whatever
 advanced technical knowledge you may have. If you are a real expert,
 you will probably receive an offer to work for them. Please accept
 it. Advanced knowledge is better in the hands of the Federation than
 in the hands of Vargr corsairs. If you are not an expert, you will
 simply be released into the Federation, and you will probably receive
 some other offer. Being familiar with advanced technology is enough
 of an asset for several corporations to be interested in us.

 Professor Borthan and myself are going to start a new Federation
 Office, which will be known simply as Office KT-47. The purpose of
 this office is to provide you with some assistance, and to coordinate
 our efforts in our obviously common interests. I would like that all
 of you keep in touch with this office in the future. And I would
 probably ask some of you to work for the office, to help us answer
 some of the mysteries which I mentioned.

 To summarize: I recommend you to take your adaptation period easy and
 to make a decision to establish yourself here, in the Federation of
 the Races. This is an island of civilization in a sea of chaos, and
 many new experiences are waiting for you.

 Now, you should rest a bit. As soon as the doctors say that you have
 recovered, your language courses will start. We will see each other
 soon. Greetings, fellow citizen. And welcome to our New Hope.

70% of something is better than 100% of nothing.  NZ, like Australia, sells
their produce to Saudi Arabia because the Saudis are willing to pay a good
price.  Unfortunately, they require live meat imports for religious and
social reasons.  Given that the Saudis are unlikely to change their customs
the alternative to the NZ farmers would be to find another market, one that
takes frozen livestock imports.  NZ has high labour costs when compared to
many nations that can offer the same service.  This means that while the
overall price for the meat is higher (and thereby reducing demand) the profit
to the farmer may not be when compared to shipping live exports to Saudi
Arabia (even including the 30% that they lose enroute).  Welcome to the
global market =).

How many \'fleets\' were in the 3rd Imperium?
Or, perhaps a better question is: what is the average density
of fleets per sector in the 3I?

Looks like, during the 5FW, the Spinward Marches had, ummmm,
perhaps 6 or 7 fleets?  Or were there more, but some were
lurking?  And what about "reserve fleets"?

Besides those, I know of the Corridor fleet, a fleet around
Antares, a fleet just interior to Antares, a Core fleet,
probably more than one fleet along the Solomani border, plus
perhaps another couple fleets.

So in the civilized sectors is there perhaps only 1 fleet
per sector, and on the frontier sectors there are several?
Thinking caps on, please!

Also I\'d like your opinions on what the average tonnage of
a fleet might be.  I think it\'s in the range of 1 to 5 mt.
Can anyone hazard a better guess or should I just take a
middle path and say 3 mt?

Who cares?  Well, it may answer a lot of questions in my mind
about military, industry and starship production rates in the 3I.

From a gameplaying angle, it\'s better to have some limitation to
starships.  The "lanthanum grid" idea is nice, because it forces
shipowners to build a jump ship with a hangar for boats, rather
than just strapping them to the outside of the ship.

That\'s the only reason I like the grid, I think.  There may be
issues with jump drive replacement and upgrade, but on the whole
I think to me the grid is only good for enforcing hangars.

I\'m going to try doing away with the hit-points concept entirely, instead just
rolling on a chart for wound severity.  ie.,

Roll 2D6+DV (+1 if head shot)
   2-3   Scratch
   3-8   Slight
   9-11  Serious
   12+   Critical

These are just off-the-cuff numbers.
I haven\'t decided yet how to use CON to modify this (perhaps a Formidible test of
CON to reduce the severity by one level?).

The usual wound effects would be in effect.  The initiative penalty for Serious
wounds I interpreted as being cumulative.  Perhaps in addition require a
Willpower task to do anything during a round, especially if it requires using the
wounded body-part.

IIRC, each sector had a named fleet that encompassed all the numbered
fleets in the sector.  Each subsector then had a numbered fleet, ie. the
212th was at Rhylanor at the eve of the FFW.

Each numbered fleet consisted of several squadrons of similar ships, ie.
BatRons, CruRons, DesRons, etc.  Each squadron was composed of several
similar class ships and the assocoated support elements.  IIRC, the
Tigress, 500kt, was in a BatRon of 6 ships (?) which for just the capital
ships would be 3mt.  Add all the escorts and support ships and you are
probably looking at about 5mt fo one BatRon.

I would think that each numbered fleet would be closer to 15 to 20mt.

What???

If it\'s a populated enough planet, then the exact opposite is true - you
have a HUGE need to import raw materials from other planets.

Imagine a whole planets that had the population density of, say, New
Jersey - not completely packed, but packed in spots with some more open
spots around too. 

Where do you plan on putting the uranium refining plant? The lanthanum
strip mine? The few hundred steel mills you\'re going to need to make the
steel to build everything with? Where are you going to grow the lumber
(does lumber even grow there)? (and you can\'t put everything in orbit
either)

Raw material processing is ugly, messy, unpleasant and has low
profitability - any planet would be glad to be rid of it. Every forward
thinking planet would be the Imperium\'s version of Japan if they had
their way - import somewhat processed raw materials cheaply, export
expensive manufactured goods. The Imperium would foster that kind of
development as well - the more interstellar traffic, the greater the
need for the Imperium. In a universe of self-sufficient worlds, who
needs an Imperium?

There is normally one numbered fleet of 2 - 10 squadrons (50-200 ships) plus 
one numbered reserve fleet per subsector.  The Imperium as a whole had about 
320 numbered fleets. (as of 1116 - Rebellion Sourcebook)

The term \'fleet\' is used for a couple of levels of organization.  There are the 
numbered and reserve fleets, which always have a number as part of their name.  
Next, each sector has a named fleet (no number in name) which consists of all 
the numbered fleets in the sector.  As well, named feets can be created for 
specific purposes, to organize a large number of ships.

Does this take into account that at most infantry operations, it was
estimatedthat only 20% were able to keep their cool enough to actually aim their
gun
to hit another human?

Some US Army General did a study and found this figure was true almost
across the board, even for the Marines at Iwo Jima, and resulted in the
more modern combat training, i.e., to shoot as a reflex, etc.

I think it was 1,000 rounds/casualty in VietNam.

Hm...interesting point I was playing with.
Assume you _know_ that a supernova has occurred at some point fairly nearby --
exact timing, etc, is known.  Assume, also, that transporting your full
population in the time before the supernova hits is not practical.  To what
degree would it be possible to actually shield a planet against the effects of
a nearby supernova?  I was playing around with a plot involving a supernova,
and picked Hefry (1 parsec from Regina, class II orange giant, probably has a
visual magnitude of around -6 from Regina) as a relatively plausible candidate
(it has other factors which make it appealing from a gaming perspective).  It
was determined that a supernova was a significant probability around a year in
advance, so Regina would have around 4 years of warning, though the possibility
of serious governmental blindness before the event is confirmed (i.e. the star
actually blows) shouldn\'t be ignored.

So, how do you shield a planet from a supernova?  The initial gamma pulse isn\'t
necessarily all that hard -- you start by grabbing a convenient moonlet with
construction devices.  You probably want around 10^14 tons of \'stuff\' available
to block with, moving that into place within a reasonable timeframe requires
between 10^9 and 10^10 tons of thrust.  That\'s probably more than available
construction tonnage, but even 10^12 tons of \'stuff\' is enough to be useful,
and that much tonnage of thrusters might well be available.  You probably also
want your materials to be vaporized, but that isn\'t terribly difficult to do,
you just make sure your materials retain significant velocity as they meet. 
The timing is a little bit tricky, since your \'stuff\' will move, and probably
cease to provide a useful shadow relatively quickly, but it doesn\'t have to be
there all that long.
Now, we need to eliminate the charged particles, which will be spread out a lot
more in time.  The trick here is distance and a magnetic field -- it shouldn\'t
take an utterly impractical magnetic loop to shadow the planet, if you put it a
ways off -- you probably can\'t trap the particles, but you can scatter them
with a field a lot weaker than your average planetary magnetic field.  I really
don\'t know the exact scale of doing this, but it doesn\'t seem impossible.

So, how possible does any of this seem given Imperial technology?

How about this:
A jump coil produces an elipsoidal shaped bubble around the ship.  It
deforms a bit due to the length of the coil.  This makes for good
spherical and cylindrical ships, but those needle and boxy ships would
be wasteful if they had to rely strictly on the elipsoidal shape formed
by a coil.  For these ships, the jump field gets squished into place by
the lanthanum grid near the surface of the ship.

Thus, you can have jump coils and jump grids in the same universe.

Additional Note: Jump carriers may favor the jump coil method to be able
to encompass their cargo, however their jump efficiency would probably
be the same with or without the attached ships.

Excellent.  I\'m going to start using that T2k Quick Kill immediately.  Jon is
quite correct in his assessment.  Not having T2k I had to resort to my house
rule, but I find that is a better solution, all around.

shooting a range target is _much_ different than shooting in a combat
situation.  Second, most police departments train their officers in a
standing isocoles or Weaver stance (both hands on the weapon), but studies
have shown that almost all police shootouts have involved moving targets,
moving shooters, and one-handed shooting

After a number of diagreements about how the combat modifers in TNE should
work, I took two of my gamers out shooting twice on a three-day weekend,
and focused on nice calm Weaver-stance shooting.  Then, on the third day
(last Memorial Day), I had them try shooting at an outdoor range, from
non-stable positions, etc.  I also had them shoot one-handed.  The dropoff
in accuracy was amazing; I had people who were hitting center-mass 95% of
the time in the range barely able to make 25% at  8 yards.

In the month since then, I have gotten a lot less argument over some of the
combat die roll modifiers I insist on.

I will admit that I only consider a 20 to be an auto-miss, though...

There have been documented cases of police in shootouts that burned off 2
full *clips* at a perp in a gunfight & failed to hit.  These police were
pretty decent shots on the range.

I encourage all developers to look into Java, since it is my current
favorite language.  The technology is reasonably up to date, it is fairly
teachable, and it scales up well.  Further, it is about the only cross
platform solution which produces good UI across many platforms.

(I know people who have used Tk to do good UIs, and they have my utmost
respect.  I have found it disturbingly difficult to do such.)

One significant complaint - there is not yet a cheap DOS-only VM out there.
 Some potential authors have complained that a plain old 286 with DOS can
run a number of fine programs doing more than the program they are
considering, so why is there no JVM.

I have mostly (90%) finished a port of my text to postscript converters
into Java.  They do not yet handle borders and such, but they seem to
handle subsector, full page subsector, and half page subsector maps well
enough.  Currently, I am working on a SimEmpire program, which will
hopefully also do a good postscript write.

No, CHINA. I\'ve been doing research for a script I\'m working on and have
this data from multiple sources - it was economical to send laundry to 
China for washing and pressing during this time.

The Iron Duke Class were one of the earlest examples of the classic Terran
Ship of the Line and even though it was a rapidly outclassed in terms of
both
size and power, the class exhibits most of the common features of the type;
the large spinal particle accelerator, wedge hull form, extreme automation
to
reduce the crew requirements, extensive backup electronics and a heavy point
defence laser battery. The Iron Dukes were designed shortly after the end of
the 1st Interstellar War and formed the backbone of the Terran fleet during
the 2nd War and early 3rd War. In total 257 examples of the class were
built,
and though the class suffered heavily with the wholesale scrappings that
followed the 3rd War, some examples survived in auxilary roles for many
years. The longest serving was the Hiei which survived as a colonial guard
ship at Hades until 2402AD.

The most famous example of the class was the Agamemnon on which the
mysterious Lord Nelson incident occured. The Agamemnon was a reserve
squadron
flagship during the critical Battle of Junction in 2152AD. During the battle
the Vilani broke through the Terran line and attacked the reserve; and the
Agamemnon was struck by a spread of Vilani missiles which damaged the
ships
control systems and killed or injured most of the bridge crew. At this point
the "ghost" of Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson (1758AD - 1805AD) "appeared" on
the ships bridge. He exhorted the crew to attack the Vilani centre. The
senior officer (Leftenant Pi Yu) choose to follow this course of action,
against all naval doctrine of the time. The result was that against all
expectations the reserve smashed the Vilani breakthrough and turned the tide
of the battle in the Terrans favour.

The incident has thus far defied explanation. The ship\'s internal bridge
sensors were offline due to battle damage at the time, so no accurate
independent record exists, but the incident was confirmed after the battle
by
the Agamemnon\'s surviving bridge crew (some 17 individuals). It is known
that
the ship\'s jump grid had accidentally discharged due to the damage
sustained.
The most commonly accepted explanation is a mass hysterical delusion
brought on by combat stress and the jump grid discharge; however the
incident
still remains a tantalising mystery and is the subject of much popular
debate.

The Agamemnon herself suffered severe damage during the battle, and though
she was repaired, she was never again employed in frontline service. She
served as a convoy escort until the end of the 3rd War and was then assigned
as a colonial guardship at Midway until 2172AD when she was designated as
an
escort for the long range colonisation program. The Agamemnon left for the
Rim in 2177AD and her ultimate fate is unknown.

If anything, he should get a *NEGATIVE* DM for a shorter sight radius.
(When the front and rear sight on a weapon are closer together, it
increases the margin of error when aiming.)

After all the deliberate planned attempts by NPC\'s to kill the group, a

Ahh the PC comments "Loook out the the Vargr is drawing the pistol, find a
bunker fast." James had the worst luck with dice when tried to fire that
pistol, not even close to average rolls. Maybe it was cursed.<G> But it was

It is a Excel 97 spreadsheet that graphically displays the sector locations
(and various sector names in each language).  It was originally intended to
link to the other spreadsheet to provide the sector data (such as I have),
but if you are just looking for the location of the sectors, it should work
for you.  I am not familiar with Galactician, so I can\'t compare them.

Hope that helps!

Subject: The Whole Traveller Universe?


I\'ve been using Jim\'s Galactician program for my CT campaign.  Does anyone
know/have the layout to ALL the sectors?  Are the in order of appearance in
the
program (i.e. Rimward to coreward)?

I\'m also still interested in finding a set of language tables for Galangalic
or
Angalic.  I\'m going to be implementing more languages in my campaigns.  I\'d
also like to know if anyone has ever "published" a dictionary or set of
vocabulary words for these languages.


Thanks for the input.

Keven,

Unfortunately my anecdotal\'s were of persons with a little bit better
training like SWAT, or even better SEALS, SAS, or Mil Spec snipers(L.H.
Oswald for one). Under the TNE systems they will missed 20% of the time,
under all conditions and situations.

Contrary to most persons living here in the US most police officer\'s do not
normally posses the skills, expertise, or mental ability for *real* fire
fights, some veterans excluded of course.

Kristian,

Ok then Sgt. York of WWI got a even better success rate what was it IIRC 10
rounds=200+ prisoners and ten kills.

Most of the troops were not trying to hit anything just firing at anything.

Kristian,

I would consider such individuals a skill of 1 or 2, very few had I would
consider a skill of 3, but then they did not have the other things needed.

Remember that a jump tender can carry riders on it\'s exterior if the
riders have grids of their own.  The tender simply contains one huge
honking jump drive, which powers it\'s own grid as well as those of
the riders.

In fact, isn\'t this how modular external cargo containers work?  They
must have a grid imbedded in their hulls or they\'d interrupt the grid
of the ship on which they\'re mounted.

If you want to guarantee a financial limitation, you have to make sure
that the installation of a grid by itself is just as pricey as the
installation of a jump drive.

Steve,

Ok Marine General "Chesty" Puller in his enlisted days in Central America
is credited with a hip shot with a 45 while running for cover shooting at a
target in canoe going down river at less than 50 yards. Hit the target in
the ear. Yes he was aiming to hit the target too, not just FFE.

Your gamers would be a skill of 0 or 1? Beginners I think would have what
you have described, but *experts* would not.

When I was a "shooter" I practiced one handed and two handed firing and
different stances. I used/owned a modified 45, 357 Ruger, 44 Ruger
Blackhawk, 9mm Mamba and a 22 cal Ruger Target. I have fired others like
the 221 Fireball and the TC 30 cal Herrett(sp), most interesting to say the
least. 

I would place myself at a skill of 3 during those times but I did not have
the mental to go along with it. I could have shot two Naval
Officers(Commander and Lt. Commander) and most likely killed them under the
conditions I was in, but I did not. It would have entirely legal also, and
justified under the conditions.

	Discovery Channel or TLC did a piece on this recently. The studies
(in Korea) did in fact show what was mentioned above: in the midst of
combat (instead of a low-threat range situation), most armed
combatants failed to fire a single round--and I think the 20% number
above was a bit high. IIRC, no more than 15% of the troops in any
engagement actually fired their weapons. Not aimed or hit
targets--fired.

	The "culprit" was traced to the fact that it\'s a fairly horrible
decision to actually kill another human being, and that most people
unconsciously froze when faced with it. 

	The solution was to condition the troops to automatically fire their
weapons at any man-sized target without having to actually make a
decision. Hence, firearms training (again, in a low-threat
environment) involves firing at targets as soon as they pop up,
without giving the shooter time to think. Eventually, it becomes
near-automatic. The "modern" rate, IIRC, is somewhere around 75% of
eligibles actually pulling the trigger. Again, that\'s just pulling
the trigger to fire the weapon ...

	Meanwhile, this doesn\'t explain the individual 15% miss rate. That\'s
explained by the fact that the game designers couldn\'t stomach the
reality that the miss rate in real-life combat situations is often
*80-90%* even at close ranges. It\'s a very rare individual who can
accurately aim and fire when under fire himself.

	If you really wanted realism, you\'d start there, and then give
bonuses for, e.g., nobody shooting at you. Failing that, I always
played the 15% auto-miss as under "full" combat, and reduced it in
situations like surprise, sniping, etc.

I hadn\'t heard of the Samoans...but I know the reason the US Army went from
.38 cal revolvers to the Colt M1911 .45 was because the Moro tribesmen in the
Phillipines (around the turn of the century)  could not be stopped by the
.38\'s.  It seems they would take a rawhide thong and bind thier testicles so
tightly that they could feel no other pain.  There are documented reports of
Moros being shot 15+ times with .38\'s and still managing to kill several
people before  dying of blood loss.

I also worked for 2 years at a mortuary in Phoenix in 90-92.  I picked up one
man who shot himself in the toe w/ a .22 cal pistol, and died of shock on the
phone w/ the 911 operator...we also picked up another individual who had been
a victim of a drive by.  He had been shot no less than 19 times, by a 9mm, a
.45, and a 12-ga.  The man apparently walked 1500 yds before he died ( based
on the location of the casings and the guys body when we arrived)  I\'d say it
simply depends on the individuals willpower (and luck, of course)

I can speak to the fact in MY personal experience (Korea, 1988) that I went
thru 5 loaded mags of .223, while ducking behind a rock one nite (talk about a
mad minute!  :-) )  We had been fired on by surprise and I just hit the
ground, stuck my rifle up and burned thru the ammo w/o looking...panic
reaction.  My whole squad did much the same thing...dawn showed one NK dead
with 1 hole in him...we expended better than 1000 rds for that!

Use the weapon specialization from Tw2K Referee\'s Scree... It allows
developing a specialization in a given weapon, reducing the auto-miss
chance. It also reduces the recoil number for the user...

According to MT sources, there is a "Sector Fleet" for every sector, an
Numbered and a Reserve Fleet for every subsector, and some extra numbered
fleets, and a few special fleets. WHat varied seems to have been specific
combinations of ships per fleet, rather than "Fleets per Area". Basically,
a fleet will have at least 1 CruRon, 1Desron, 1 ScoutRon, and 1 AuxRon...
Usually more , with a core of a BatRon. Also, the AuxRon is Usually
seperated from the TankRon. Also, most will have 1 or more assaultRons for
panetary punishment. the FFW countermix seems to be "Deployable Groups" and
"Deployable ___Rons"

Oh, and remember a Ron is at least 10 of something. Some subsectors can\'t
even afford A fleet... others could afford 20 or more.... but the map shows
no ss with more than 4 numbered fleets, Excluding Core. It is strongly
implied that EACH numbered fleet has a reserve fleet.

It\'s in #73 (Lethality In Roleplaying Small Arms Systems, Frank Chadwick).  I 
recall it being posted to GEnie way back when, and thought I still had it saved 
somewhere, but no such luck.

It\'s a report of 5 incidents that occured on the US-Mexican border.  The San 
Diego PD set up an undercover task force to look for criminals preying on 
illegal aliens in a rugged, undeveloped area of the border. 

Here\'s an excerpt from the observations at the end of the article:

- ----begin----
In the 5 incidents presented above, task force officers fired about 90 rounds, 
most of them at close range, and scored 29 hits, or 32%.  Of even more interest 
are the 8 shots fired while effectively in physical contact with the target.  
Of these 8 shots, only 4 were hits (50%).  Finally, it is interesting how many 
of the casualties were acheived by one man, Chacon.  Although he apparently did 
not fire or score hits in incident 3 and was not present for incident 1, he hit 
with his only shot in the fifth incident, was the only officer to hit Hernandez 
in the fourth incident , and actually scored at least one, and perhaps more, 
hits on _every_ man (including two friendly officers) wounded in the second 
incident.

As to bullet lethality, a total of 15 officers and suspects were wounded in 
these 5 incidents, and they were hit by a total of 32 bullets.  Most of the 
injured men were struck by a single bullet; 4 were struck by multiple bullets, 
and of these one was struck by 8 bullets.  Of these 15 casualties, 2 were 
killed almost instantly while the other 13 survived and recovered.  All those 
that suffered multiple gunshot wounds recovered.  That is, none of the 
fatalities were caused by a cumulative build-up of trauma, but rather were due 
to a single, almost instantly fatal wound.
- ----end----

The two fatalities:

Fatality 1:
   A knife-wielding suspect jumped one officer.  During the struggle, a second 
   officer jumped on the suspect\'s back, put his snub-nosed .38 to the back of 
   the suspect\'s head, and fired once.  The shot killed the suspect instantly, 
   and temporarily blinded the officer that fired.

Fatality 2:
   Officer Chacon fired a shotgun at point-blank range into the center-chest of 
   a suspect.  The suspect stood for a moment looking at him, then turned 
   around and calmly walked away into the darkness.  Chacon followed cautiously 
   (wondering if he had somehow missed or the suspect was wearing body armour), 
   and found the suspect lyng peacefully on the ground, dead of massive chest 
   injuries.

Chart of hit locations:

   Area         #Hits  %ofTotal

   head & neck    2       6       1 fatal hit (50%)

Have you considered tying this more closely to _World Builder\'s Handbook?_
I think WBH had a lot of good ideas, but lacked a few finishing touches.

At this level I would think that one could be more specific about transport
costs. If you know the amount of equipment and the number of people to be
moved, it should be possible to let the PCs chose the particular ship they
want to hire and work out a schedule of transportation. That way you get an
exact number of weeks the ship is hired and a weekly (or monthly) rate of
hire for an exact transportation cost.

How much more effort would it be to come up with a shopping list of these
items with appropiate costs? That way the PCs will be able to chose whether
to spend the money on a spare bulldozer or the extra cash needed to make it
a fusion plant, or whatever.

Rather, spare parts cannot be manufactured locally and engineers and

Point of information: The equipment carried by an Aslan ihatei ship is said

How about working out some recruiting rules similar to the rules in
_Mercenary_?

Actually, that issue can affect the recruiting considerably. There would be
quite a difference between, say, raising the venture capital by selling
places in the colony to people and in having a few fat cats putting up all
the money and recruiting suitable skilled personnel. In the first case you
would have a democratic setup with everybody having an equal say in the
running of the colony (and the skills the colonists had would not always be
exactly what you needed. In the second place you would have some kind of
oligarchy. A company providing the money would be yet a third situation
because the colony would have to pay a dividend on the investment as they
went along.

How about a couple of generic sample constitutions to fit the most usual

I don\'t really think the macro-level economic extension of PE is suitable
for a micro-level colony management game. Take Infrastructure, for example.
This is actually a combination of roads, vehicles, production equipment,
and production housing. What is the infrastructure of a colony with one
settlement, no roads, four aging grav trucks, two Mobile Fabrication Units,
and a lanthanum mine right next to the settlement? Actually, the effective
infrastructure of a small colony can easily be quite high. It\'s only when
the settlers spread out across the countryside and the grav trucks begin to
break down that the infrastructure score begins to go down.

A newly established colony may have a very high population growth provided
it has restricted recruits to younger people. Take as an example a parent
society with an annual population growth of 3%. Say its population has an
average life expentancy of 80 years and that most people have their
children before they are 40. Now, the 3% is actually a birth rate of 4.25%
offset by a death rate of 1.25%. Then take a colony made up of people
below the age of 40. If the colony has no serious dangers, the death rate
is going to be almost nil for many years to come. At the same time 4.25% of
the total population is actually 8.5% of the population below 40, so the
colony growth rate could easily be 8.5% pa. Before any immigration. If you
have an even more skewed population composition (perhaps 80% adults to only
20% children), you can get even higher growth figures.

>The basic Traveller rate of interest is 3%,

How do you arrive at that figure? The rate of interst on starship loans is
somthing around 5.5%.

It sounds like you\'re talking about some kind of planetary level sandcaster.
Screening out gamma rays and w/ a magnetic (or gravitic) field of some kind

It just seems like a sandcaster on a macro scale.  I don\'t see why not if
sandcasters are at all possible.

There are obviously gaps in the grid.  Just look at the cover of the SoM.  It
has large gaps for the windows of the Beowulf free trader and probably over
the Thruster Plates (or Heplar heat exchanger depending on your viewpoint), as
well as the turrets.   And think of the large bore of a spinal mount?  We can
assume there\'s a cover w/ a grid but we can also assume alot of things.
"Strap on" craft (cutters) are also visible in the original Traveller
illustrations of the Broadsword I\'ve seen.  What\'s a few more, as long as it\'s
on a similar scale (as most small craft will be to the mothership)?

IMTU, both lathanum grids and coils are possible.  The Vilani favored grids
and the Solomani generally followed suit.

The major benefit for hangars is maintenence w/o having to go EVA, to say
nothing of protection of small craft.

Wouldn\'t it follow that pcs should/would probably be in the same boat?
Besides, I think we\'re talking about Quick shots rather than Aimed shots.

cashiered) is on the trail of this same person. Add in a Marine General
(ret) for fire support.

They locate their quarry in the second city. Some legwork identifies the
place he is staying (a dumpy saloon/inn). Take the ship\'s boat there; use
the Air/Raft to motor around (can you say stand out?). Turns out the quarry
checked out a couple of hours ahead of them. Took a taxi. Shake down the
taxi company for info. They dropped him at the rent-a-wreck place. Seems he
hired a Land Rover equivalent and headed out into the back country
(scattered agricultural settlement all over the place).

The players have decided that aerial recon is in order; they have decided
to use the ship\'s boat for the mission.

Now for the search: using MT, I reckon that the task to locate this vehicle
is Difficult (uncertain). The rental vehicle is painted in a distinctive
livery. The terrain is mostly open and not rough; there are not large areas
of heavy forest to hide in. Unfortunately, the quarry has about a six hour
lead on the players, and a hasty search will be in failing light at best.

The quarry is aware of the pursuit; he is hoping to circle back into town
under cover of darkness and hole up for a couple of days. He (the "bad" guy
(just misunderstood ;))) has a Safari Ship in orbit with the launch in the
outback under cover. The players might locate it on a special success. They
don\'t know that he has one.

At one point I asked the players who was Clint Eastwood and who was Lee Van
Cleef. They giggled.

What do people think of the search task? It might be easier using the
sensors on the yacht, but it is limited by orbital mechanics, while the
boat is a bit more flexible. The Air/Raft might work a bit better, but they
don\'t have enough seats for everyone they plan to include in the hunt.

Since you play the last survivors of humanity, no new immigrants come
in and no new supplies show up - you make it with the stuff you brought,
the stuff you build and the people you breed.

One thing they mention in Outpost is factors in Mortality Rates (MT).
Your initial MT due to age is very low (you brought young adults with
you for the colony), and it\'s also low for disease (you used decontam
procedures and didn\'t bring anyone with the sniffles). During the initial
colonization efforts, however, your fatality rate from accidents is
very high. Think of it: you bring several thousand people from a safe,
long-civilized world to a wilderness, possibly one with a hostile
environment, and have them take part in heavy construction projects
that are very time-critical. Yes, you trained them, but until they get some
personal experience on this brave new world they are going to die a lot
more often than usual.

Once the habitat domes are up, the oxygen plant is built and the
fusion plant is online, your mortality rate from construction accidents
starts to decline - the careless and clumsy people have already wised
up or died off, and the survivors are experts at vacuum-environment
construction (or whatever you\'ve had to put up with). The few babies
born during the intial construction phase are joined by a steadily
increasing baby boom - another nice side effect of bringing young,
healthy people along. As it will be still some decades before age
becomes a factor in mortality rates, your colony will go through 
some pretty impressive growth, even if there is no immigration.

There should be little to no emigration during the colony growth
period - the only major emigration I can think of is if a good chunk
of the population were corporate or Imperial construction crews
that stayed for five years or so to finish initial construction projects.
Locals should be so poor that leaving is not an option - unless, as
has happened on Earth a time or two, the colonists find something
incredibly valuable on their plot of land, sell it and all go on with their

Immigration has been covered by the other excellent posts on this
subject - I\'m not sure what percentages the ideas on mortality causes
would indicate, but I think they make sense and should be taken into
account.

This seems underarmoured for a capital ship = especially only a 3-G
maneuver one - though standards during the second interstellar war may 
have been lax.

By the way - do you reazlly think Terra was TL-11 during the second war?
Terra was TL-9 during contact with the Vilani, right? When did they go to
TL-10 and TL-11? (Just asking - I have some M:IW designs of my own I\'ve

I think the one he is probably referring to is TD 13 in the Medical Digest
portion.  It was in the 2nd of 3 issues covering replacement body parts. 

The location rolls were:
2 - Right Foot
3 - Right Hand
4 - Right Leg
5 - Right Arm
6 - Lower Torso (Additional roll of 1d-2 for number of organs hit)
7 - Upper Torso (Additional roll: 1-2 - Heart
                                               3-5 - Lungs
                                               6 - Both heart & lungs)
8 - Head (Additional roll: 1 - Right Eye
                                    2 - Left Eye
                                    3 - Right Ear
                                    4 - Left Ear
                                    5 - Throat
                                    6 - Roll Twice)
9 - Left Arm
10 - Left Leg
11 - Left Hand
12 - Left Foot

This was for MT, so you rolled once for a moderate wound, twice for a
serious wound and three times for a deadly wound.  If a serious or deadly
wound level, the body part rolled must be replaced.

I hope that this is what you were looking for.

Ok, I understand the points that you and Kristin are making, but I
think the right way to handle this kind of thing is with the
difficulty of the task.  A short range non-aimed shot it\'s already a
Difficult task, so an asset of 14 (which is pretty outstanding, I
think) the chance of success is 70%.  If you raise the difficulty to
Formidable because of the circumstances (such as the one you presented
above) the chance of success drops to 35%.  To *me* that looks like
the right way to handle it.

The automatic miss on 17+ (20%) only really comes into play on aimed
shots at Short range for most people.  It seems to me that if you have
the time and concentration to aim then that\'s precisely where you
*shouldn\'t* have a 20% automatic miss.  

The other place it would come into play is with a *highly* skilled
character who has a Gun Combat Asset of 17+, but how common is that?
And if somebody is *that* good then an automatic 20% *still* seems way
too high.

Interesting take!

The 2d6+DV is the way the "big guns" do it already, so you\'re unifying
small with large weapons.  I like that, quite a lot.  

How about melee weapons?  And how about for unarmed kick and punch
attacks..still UCD (unarmed combat damage)?

I use both in mine.  ;-> The grid inside the hull armor produces the
protective interface between the bubble of normal space and deadly
jump space.  The coil and jump mass are used to open the rift though
which the ship enters jump space.

The coil and fuel are required at the beginning of jump, but the coil
can be shut down after the ship is actually *in* jump space.  The grid
has to continue running as long as the ship remains in jump space.

If you are interested in Java application development you might want
to look at CoffeeShop at
http://www.sfs-software.com/coffeeshop/index.html

It is an inexpensive RAD utility that is similar to how Delphi or
Visual Basic work, ie. you can do pretty impressive stuff without
being a masterful UI programmer.  Because it is written in Java
itself, CoffeeShop is truely cross platform and will run on *nix,
Window, OS/2, and the Mac (I assume the Mac can handle JDK 1.1.5 or
higher).  And best of all, to a cheapskate like me, it is under $100!

Yep, its one of the fundimentals of the period. The Terrans were TL 9 going into 
the first war (2110AD), TL 10 at the end (2118AD) and TL by 2120AD. Basically 
the Terrans met the Vilani an simply reverse engineered everything.

Most certainly, thank you. However in light of yours and some other coments, 
I\'ve slightly reworked the design.

The Iron Duke Class were one of the earilest examples of the classic Terran
Ship of the Line (the first to be fitted with thrust plates) and even though
it was a rapidly outclassed in terms of both size and power, the class
exhibited most of the common features of the type; the large spinal particle
accelerator, wedge hull form, extreme automation to reduce the crew
requirements, extensive backup electronics and a heavy point defence laser
battery. The Iron Dukes were designed shortly before the start of the 2nd
Interstellar War and formed the backbone of the Terran fleet during the 2nd
War and early 3rd War. In total 185 examples of the class were built, and
though the class suffered heavily with the wholesale scrappings that followed
the 3rd War, some examples survived in auxilary roles for many years. The
longest serving was the Hiei which survived as a guardship at Hades until
2402AD.

The most famous example of the class was the Agamemnon on which the
mysterious Lord Nelson incident occured. The Agamemnon was a reserve 
squadron flagship during the critical Battle of Junction in 2152AD. During the 
battle the Vilani broke through the Terran line and attacked the reserve; and the
Agamemnon was struck by a spread of Vilani missiles which damaged the 
ship\'s control systems and killed or injured most of the bridge crew. At this 
point the "ghost" of Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson (1758AD - 1805AD) 
"appeared" on the ship\'s bridge. He exhorted the crew to attack the Vilani 
centre. Against all naval doctrine of the time, the senior surviving officer 
(Leftenant Pi Yu) choose to follow this course of action. The result was that 
against all expectations the reserve smashed the Vilani breakthrough and 
turned the tide of the battle in the Terrans favour.

The incident has thus far defied explaination. The ship\'s internal bridge
sensors were offline due to battle damage at the time, so no accurate
independent record exists, but the incident was confirmed after the battle by
the Agamemnon\'s surviving bridge crew (some 17 individuals). It is known that
immediately prior to the incident the ship\'s jump grid had accidentally
discharged due to the damage sustained. The most commonly accepted
explaination is a mass hystereical delusion brought on by combat stress and
the jump grid discharge; however the incident still remains a tantalising
mystery and is the subject of much popular debate.

The Agamemnon herself suffered severe damage during the battle, and though
she was repaired, she was never again employed in frontline serivce. She
served as a convoy escort until the end of the 3rd War and was then assigned
as a colonial guardship at Midway until 2172AD when she was designated as 
an escort for the long range colonisation program. The Agamemnon left for the
rim in 2177AD and her ultimate fate is unknown.

I\'ve been hearing of alot of  T2K rules that should be in TNE, methinks.  Can
anyone here (Loren maybe?) say why they weren\'t?  The quick kill rule and
specialization for one both sound like real good ones (as do controlled
bursts)...

You\'re talking awesome and *rare* shooters.  They should get a special
dispensation from the rules, I think.  Either adopt Ruperts 20 or  the T2k
specilization maybe?, I think.

Sgt York shouldn\'t be typical.  If he\'s that stat12 skill 6 super duper weapon
master then he should only miss on maybe 1 in 20.

> Most of the troops were not trying to hit anything just firing at anything.

But PCs *should* behave like most of the normal infantry and such.  The way to
simulate it is a larger chance of pure miss.  I\'d say give the notarized <g>
experts a special rule.

    'body' => 'After WWII, a study by the US army or some such led to a radical change in
training methods. The reason was that many to most (50+) combatants did not
fire in combat, being reluctant (as mentioned elsewhere) to shoot another
human being. Training methods were revised to get people to actually shoot.

To quote a book (written by a friend-of-a-friend; I have every reason to
believe that this autobiographical account is true) about the Falklands War
of 1982:

\'How can I tell you that the man I killed was just a paper target to me? A
target appeared, I fired. Just like they taught me. I knew what I was
doing, but it didn\'t matter. Trained reflex.\'

I have this on the authority of another ex-soldier. \'At the time, you just
do it. Later, you might think I DID THAT. But at the time it\'s just like
being on the range. Aim and fire. I\'ve done it so many times before.\'

This reflects the training methods used more than the men involved. 

But as soon as lead starts flying back, then you start to miss.

I used to impose an extra difficulty factor to shooting if there is any
\'combat stress\' present (firing at an unsuspecting target is not subject to
stress. Trying to shoot the guy who\'s about to bayonet you is.)

Thus my players found that the place to be was in cover, on a flank or
behind the enemy, firing by surprise. Manoeuvre and stealth became more
important than tactics pools. Standing up and blazing away = highly
dangerous. There\'s usually someone on the other side in cover, not
stressed, aiming at your wonderfully exposed body.....

Used to? Guess I still do.

and finished a new version.  For those new to the list, TRTOOLS is a set of
command-line utilities for Traveller (non version specific).

TRTOOLS 0.97.1 has a few new features, but most of my effort went into
thoroughly cleaning up the code prior to attempting a Linux port (console
only using SVGALIB, I\'m looking at an X Windows version later on down the
track).

TRTOOLS features (from the README file):

* Map Sector:    by Allegiance, by Tech Level, by Starport, by Population,
by Habitability, by   Travel Zone, by Bases, select Trade Code

* Map Subsector

* Map \'theatre\'

* Calculate Hard Times (Megatraveller) effects

* Calculate Collapse (TNE) effects

* Regress Second Survey data to T4\'s M:0 era.

* Convert stellar data

* Generate sector data

* Recalculate trade codes

The code has been drastically cleaned up, and should be easier to modify
(I\'ve included a MAKEFILE) to simplify the compilation process.

TRTOOLS was written using Borland\'s Turbo Pascal v6.0, although it would
probably port to FPC-Pascal (an excellent freeware Pascal compiler) without
much fuss.  The Linux version will be written using FPC-Pascal.

As usual, the source code has been included, and the utilities are
completely free provided:

1/ any bugs, gripes or suggestions get passed on to me.
2/ if anyone does anything to the code, I\'d appreciate having a look (I\'ll
prolly learn something).

I\'ll modify my Web pages to reflect the new version ASAP.  For now, TRTOOLS
can be found at:

I had heard about that study as well, A friend of mine 
doing a Masters in Strategic studies told me about it. He 
also told me that it had been fairly conclusively 
debunked, but I don\'t have any more details than that.

By looking on the web (the web is your friend) I found the 
following URL
http://www.erols.com/twool/sniper1.htm

From which I\'ll quote a few lines.
[big snip]

Statistics from past wars suggest that this probability 
figure may be optimistic. In Would War II, the United 
States and its allies expended 25,000 rounds of 
ammunition to kill a single enemy soldier. In the Korean 
War, the ammunition expenditure had increased four-fold 
to 100,000 rounds per soldier; in the Vietnam War, that 
figure had doubled to 200,000 rounds of ammunition for 
the death of a single enemy soldier. The risk to 
noncombatants is apparent.  

In contrast, United States Army and Marine Corps 
snipers in the Vietnam War expended 1.3 rounds of 
ammunition for each claimed and verified kill, at an 
average range of six hundred yards, or almost twice the 
three hundred meters cited above for combat 
engagements by the average soldier. Some verified kills 
were at ranges in excess of 1000

What I want from a system is the tendency of people to 
spray and pray (most of those rounds would probably 
have been fired at nothing) with it\'s commensurate low hit 
probabilities, and the ability of snipers to hit people at 
600 yards 60-70% of the time.

I came up with the number by working backwards from PE, then plugged in a
list of things you\'d have in the colony ship.

Essentially, I didnt want to do a list of equipment at each TL. This could
be done, but I wanted it to keep it simple, and didnt want to do that level
of work.

The Mercenary rules (which I no longer have) are about finding people in

One of the things I was thinking of was a South American colony

This is represented by losing a point of infrastructure when you gain a pop
code increase.

The level this is pitched at is a bit higher than \'micro\' ... micro is a
\'Seattle Farmers Collective\' type game, where all the colonists are PCs,
and Fixing John-boy\'s Grav Truck is a life-or-death issue for the colony.

I thought of this, but then I thought that you should have to damp off
population growth (and increase civilian consumption later to deal with the
\'baby boomers\' reaching retirement age), so I just assumed that the initial
population is going to be normally distributed agewise.

The starship loan figure minus a risk premium of 1.5 percent ... plus 3% is

Nope, tweren\'t the article I was referring to. THe one I am referring to is
specifically for MT, and was in a T specific publication.

Traveller\'s Digest had a really good series of medical articles for
traveller, covering (amonst other things) psychological problems, bio/cyber
tech medical applications, including regeneration of limbs, low berths.

IMHO, TD (after release of MT) should be considered semi-canonical... the
rules _errata_ definitely was.

Heck, there are actually some sound reasons to site next to a large
body of water. Besides a supply of fuel, it also makes it possible to
do ballistic landing of some types of cargo. And given Traveller tech
levels, water landings for ground to orbit shuttles aren\'t a bad idea. 
Heck, some "frontier" type *ships* may be designed for water landings
and takeoff.

S.L.A. Marshall, _Men_Against_Fire_ - which most referees would do well to
read, as it\'s readily available (at least in the US).  Some researchers
have determined that Marshall\'s methods were not everything he claimed, but
no one has disputed his basic conclusions.  A more recent and comprehensive
treatment is _On_Killing_ (McDonald? I\'ve loaned my copy out - scary book).

The "combat oriented" training had the twin results that (1) firing rates
went from an estimated 15-20% (ever fired their weapon during combat) in
WWII, to 50% in Korea, to as much as 90% in Vietnam, and (2) combat stress
and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) casualties increased by about the
same amount.

Only about 2% of a normal population has the typical PC\'s ability to kill
at close range and not suffer for it mentally.  These "aggressive
psychopathic" personalities are not necessarily evil or bad - many police
officers fall into this category (sheepdogs vs. wolves), and that 2% are
virtually the only troops  that can avoid becoming stress casualties after
100 days in continuous combat.

One very possible explanation for the high miss rate in close combat:  the
individuals firing are *trying* to miss, but firing anyway to make it look
good.  _On_Killing_ goes into the statistics, but even in Napoleanic line
of battle units survived volley after volley in dense formations at ranges
where (in tests with period weapons) 60% of aimed shots hit a
formation-sized sheet of plywood.  Answer?  Most of the shots were probably
aimed just above the heads of the opposite line.  Modern skirmish combat,
with the isolation of the individual firer, makes this form of "combat
avoidance" even easier.

>I think it was 1,000 rounds/casualty in VietNam.
>
>Bloo

Don\'t forget:  the principle infantry weapon of WWII was still a
semi-automatic M1 rifle or carbine, while in Vietnam it was the full-auto
M16.  Moreover, the tactical employment of squad weapons had changed
between the wars, as a result both of S.L.A. Marshall\'s studies and the
specific circumstances of jungle warfare.  In WWII, marksmanship was the
goal (one shot, one hit), in Vietnam it was firepower (hose them down with
lead).

After a number of diagreements about how the combat modifers in TNE 
should work, I took two of my gamers out shooting twice on a three-day 
weekend, and focused on nice calm Weaver-stance shooting.  Then, on the 
third day (last Memorial Day), I had them try shooting at an outdoor 
range, from non-stable positions, etc.  I also had them shoot 
one-handed.  The dropoff in accuracy was amazing; I had people who were 
hitting center-mass 95% of the time in the range barely able to make 25% 
at  8 yards.

In the month since then, I have gotten a lot less argument over some of 
the combat die roll modifiers I insist on.

I will admit that I only consider a 20 to be an auto-miss, though...

Except that the usual "Wild West Showdown" involved firing quick while

Interesting - the FBI\'s stats clearly show that there is no significant
difference in knockdown between .38 special (with modern ammo), 9mm and
.45ACP assuming they\'re all firing bullets of similar construction. They
also show that the best knockdown is achieved by the .357 magnum, followed
by the .44 magnum (its rounds are so powerful that a fair bit the their
energy is wasted in over penetration).

The quick-kill rule is, but in a different form. The TW2K rule was for the
damage value on a D10, and vs a PC gave an automatic serious wound (I
think). It only applied for aimed chest or head shots. The TNE rule applies
to all chest/head hits, but on a D@0 for double damage.

I suspect that the specialisation rules were left out for game balance
considerations.

BTW who would one need to get permission from if one wished to put all
these little TW2K rules up on a web page for the TNEer\'s who don\'t have TW2K?

    For the 9mm to be an effective \'man-stopper\' it has to be a hollowpoint
round.  Otherwise you get too much over penatration, and most of the
round\'s energy exits out the back of the target.
    The .45 is effective because it\'s very efficent at transferring all of
it\'s energy to the target.
    Reason:  9mm, smaller but faster.  .45 larger and slower (subsonic).
    Of course this a large hand waving sweeping generalization, but is
mostly true.

     This is a serious case of gun control.  You know, being able to hit
your target with the first round.  One .22 hollow point round to the heart
is more effective than 2-3 9mm rounds to the torso that miss the heart and
major blood vessels.

     Ya, but they don\'t just use a single round.  They use .22 short
semi-autopistols with a sound suppressor.  The technique is called
\'zippering.\'  You fire 5 or 6 shots, starting at the groin and working your
way up to the head.  Each one of those shots may not be fatal, but add all
of them together, and you have a different story.  Because of the low
recoil, a trained shooter and pop off those half dozen rounds quickly and
put all five in a torso sized target at 3 meter ranges.

FYI, I current run TNE rules.  I use d10s for damage and make use of quick
kill & knockdown rules.  I also use the \'npc\' stats for cannon fodder, so
they go down pretty damn quick (i.e. less points, what the Hell, they\'re
Cannon Fodder).

a "Reserve Fleet".

A "Named Fleet", then, has all Numbered and

addition, there are some extra numbered fleets
and special fleets, but I\'ll absorb them here,
because many sectors are only partially
Imperial (plus sectors like Corridor have 
some Rift in them).

16 sectors, and guesstimate naval tonnage.
                                               5000 mt

Slightly over 16. Most subsectors have one fleet each. A few (in Corridor
and in Core) had more.

Each subsector has a reserve fleet. Those subsectors with more than one

The <Sector Name> Fleet is a so-called named fleet which consists of all
regular fleets in the sector. Occasionally special named fleets are
created for special purposes, but most named fleets are just an
administrative umbrella with few ships of its own.

Fleets differ in size. It would depend on the number and composition of
its component squadrons. A TCr squadron would be about 1.2 megatons.

This is a repost of an analysis I posted some months ago. I hope you will
find it useful.


AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPERIAL NAVY IN THE CLASSIC ERA
===================================================

Main sources: _Fighting Ships_, _Spinward Marches Campaign_ and _Rebellion_.

NUMBER AND TYPE OF SHIPS

_Rebellion_ p. 27 states that each sector of the Imperium theoretically has a
group of fleets numbering about 1000 ships. This number includes combat vessels
such as cruisers, carriers, battleships, and _some_ escorts (emphasis mine).
It does not include auxiliaries, support ships, and scouts.

The first ambiguity lies in just what kinds of escorts are included in the 1000
ship figure and what kinds are not. Are the 5,000 T _Sloan_ class escorts so
big that they are counted, or is there a class of escorts smaller than a
light cruiser (30,000 T ships), but bigger than Sloans?

One could postulate an escort class of around 10-20,000 T, big enough to mount
a spinal weapon, but too light to be classed as even a light cruiser. A bit
inelegant, especially since FS states that escorts are ships of up to 5000 T
and that the presence of a spinal mount is what distinguishes a cruiser, but
OTOH, are there really no ships in the 5,000-20,000 T range? And this way we
can define \'combat vessels\' as ships with spinal mounts and auxiliaries as
ships without. 

Perhaps escorts in BatRons and CruRons are not counted while escorts organized
into squadrons of their own (EscRons? ;-) are?

The simplest solution is propably to ignore the \',and some escorts\' part and
just consider the presence of a spinal mount the criteria for being part of
the 1000 ship figure.

The second ambiguity is whether battleriders are included in the figure or
not. I would have preferred that they were not, but the one detailed squadron
I know of (the 154th Battle Rider Squadron described in SMC) clearly implies
that they are.
 
In the following for ease of reference I\'m going to use the word \'armada\'
about the sector fleets and reserve the word \'fleet\' for the sub-sector-sized
fleets that the armadas are composed of. Also \'combat vessels\' for the ships
included in the 1000 ship figure and \'auxiliaries\' for all the ships that
isn\'t.

If the 1000 ships are for a sector with a full sixteen sub-sectors, then the
average fleet has 1000/16 = 62.5 ships. Since there are 320 regular fleets in
the Imperium, the total of combat ships for the Imperium would be around
20,000.

Further down it is stated that a regular fleet has between 2 and 10 squadrons
amounting to a total of between 50 and 200 ships. This would appear to average
out to 125 ships per fleet with an average of 6 squadrons per fleet and 21
ships per squadron.

Possibly this means that the squadrons are combat vessels _plus_ escorts and 
that the 125 ship figure includes auxiliaries. This would give us a navy of
20,000 combat vessels and a like number of auxiliaries.

However, FS states that CruRons are generally of 4 to 8 ships and the examples
in it implies that 8 ship BatRons are the norm. (Also, I seem to remember
squadrons of non-combat vessels mentioned somewhere, but I can\'t recall the
references).

Possibly the 2-squadron fleets and 25-ship squadrons are rare and almost all
fleets have 8-10 squadrons with almost all squadrons running to between 8 and
20 ships (half combat vessels and half escorts). With an average of about 9
squadrons per fleet and 14 ships per squadron we\'ll get about 20,000 combat
vessels and the same number of escorts. This still leave the pure auxiliary
squadrons like tanker squadrons and patrol squadrons (PatRons ;-) unaccounted
for, but it\'s a start.

SIZE AND COST OF A SQUADRON

The 154th Battle Squadron detailed in SMC consists of:

  1 300,000 T _Lurenti_ Class Carrier @ MCr23,056         =  23,056
  7 20,000 T _Nolikian_ Class Battle Riders @ MCr9,268.25 =  64,878
200 50 T _Sylean_ Class Heavy Fighters @ MCr105.33        =  21,066
  7 5,000 T _Sloan_ Class Escorts @ MCr3,334.5            =  23,342 
  
A total of MCr132,342 of which MCr109,000 goes to the combat vessels and the
remaining 17.6% goes to the escorts.

Obviously this must be one of the cheapest squadrons in the navy. If all the
20,000 combat ships cost around MCr19,000 (including the cost of its pendant
auxiliary) then the total cost of the regular Imperial navy would be TCr380.
This would represent 15% of the Imperium\'s total military investment, which
would make the whole shebang cost TCr2,533. Annual maintenance would run to
TCr254. Divided by the 15 trillion inhabitants of the Imperium that would be
Cr17 per man.

If we assume that the ships in FS constitutes a representative sample, then
we see that the average cruiser/carrier is of 52,714 T and costs MCr31,193.
If we reduce that to 50,000 T and add the cost of a 5,000 T escort apiece,
the average cruiser works out at roughly MCr33,000. The three battleships
average 300,000 T and costs MCr206,106 apiece, which with the escort and a
little rounding comes to MCr210,000.

Unfortunately, that just isn\'t enough. Even if we assume that ALL the combat
ships are battleships, it still only amounts to a total cost of TCr4,200,
which works out at a military budget of Cr187 per inhabitant of the Imperium.
If we assume a ratio of battleships to cruisers similar to the one in FS
(3:7), the the cost falls to TCr1723, or Cr77 per inhabitant.

Of course, we might say that we still haven\'t accounted for most of the
auxiliary ships yet. We\'ve included one 5,000 T escort for each combat ship,
but what about the couriers, destroyers, smaller escorts, transports and
tankers that appear in FS and elsewhere? For example, I happen to believe that
a navy would have a massive number of couriers, say 20 per fleet, but even
6400 couriers only amount to another 1.6 TCr. The same would apply to
destroyers and the like -- you need a huge number of them to affect the budget
noticeably. Some of the other auxiliaries like tankers would cost more
individually -- the milion T _Gorodish_ class fleet tenders mentioned in FS
might run to MCr400,000 apiece, but how many of those are the average fleet
likely to have? One? Two? OK, that\'s another 256 TCr, which is a help, but it
still leaves a long way to go. Remember that every credit we increase the
budget with represents another 3000 destroyers (just to pick an example), and
we know from the recent pirate debate that the Imperium apparently lack the
small ships to police all its member worlds adequately. So we may push the
budget up to Cr85/man by use of the smaller fry, but not much more than that.

There are two more possibilities that I can see. One is that battleriders are
NOT, after all, included in the 1000 ship figure. If a carrier and half a
dozen dreadnaught-sized battleriders counted as one ship instead of 6, then
we could get some really expensive ships. Unfortunately battleriders tend to
be cruiser-sized. The carrier needed to carry 6 200,000 T battleriders would
have to be about 2-2.5 million tons and the maximum size of a ship in CT is
1 million. A 1 million T carrier would only amount to about twice the cost
of the average battleship (MCr430) and according to FS the 500,000 T
_Tigress_ class dreadnaught is the largest ship in the Spinward Marches. A
500,000 T carrier would cost about the same as an average dreadnaught, which
leaves us back where we started.

The other possibility is that a large number of ships are laid up in
ordinary. That would require that part of the annual budget was used to
maintain these inactive ships, which would make the active part of the navy
a correspondingly smaller share. If we assume that the wartime budget of the
Imperium is 1.5 times the peacetime budget (a guesstimate based on the
various government multipliers in TCS) and that there would be enough ships
in ordinary to operate on the wartime budget, then there would be about one
ship in ordinary for each two active ships and about 6% of the budget would
be spent on maintaning them. If instead we assume that peacetime spending is
the 3% of GNP that _Striker_ gives and wartime spending would be 15% of GNP
then the Imperium could have EIGHT ships in ordinary for each active ship and
spend 45% of its peacetime budget on maintaining them. That would push the
military spending up to about Cr150/citizen. Whether you like the idea of an
Imperial reserve fleet of 160,000 combat vessels is another matter. (There is
some small support for the notion in the fact that acording to _Arrival
Vengeance_ ships are still being reactivated in 1123, six years after the
beginning of the Rebellion, with at least two more years to go before they
are finished. OTOH it requires an implausibly long view to maintain reserves
that will take 8 years to activate...)

And in the end, even with the best will in the world it appears that the 
Imperial navy is only about half the size that it should be (Cr150 would be
1.5% of the GNP and we were calculating with 3%).

To those who would suggest that perhaps the Imperium feels so secure that it
is using even less than the standard 3% peacetime spending I\'d like to point
to the Solomani, Zhodani, and K\'Kree and suggest that it is rather implausible
that the Imperium would feel so secure.

I\'d like to finish off by re-emphasizing that all those ships, the 20,000 
combat vessels, the 20,000 big escorts and the unspecified number of lesser
ships only represent 15% of the Cr150. Another 15% goes to the subsector
fleets and the remaining 70% goes to planetary defenses, though admittedly
6-40% of that (4.2-28% of the total) would go to armies.

=============================================

Shiwonee/Shiwonee (Massilia 1430), 272-1116

	Emperor Strephon was killed by Archduke Dulinor or Iilelish on
 136-1116. Empress Iolanthe, Grand Princess Iphegenia, and the Aslan
 Yerlyaruiwo Ambassador are also reported dead. Archduke Dulinor has
 claimed the imperial throne by the right of Assasination, but most
 sources consider Prince Varian to be the immediate heir. Archduke
 Dulinor apparently fled Capital after the assasination
	Duke Darnaaga Neowashee, present in Capital at the time of the 
assasination, has sent a message to Shiwonee encouraging the Geonee 
worlds to remain calm and loyal.

 Notes: The arrival of the news of the assasination to Shiwonee at
 272-1116 assumes that the three "loose ends" of the X-boat network at
 Massilia B (Arar, Gasha, and Sargashad) are actually connected
 through two jumps (stopping at some intermediate world), at least for
 very important news like this. Ordinary news which do not use this
 shortcut would be delayed three more weeks. Anyway, there is a J-6
 route which halves the time to 70 days instead of 140.

Shiwonee/Shiwonee (Massilia 1430), 277-1116

	Emperor Strephon, Empress Iolanthe, Grand Princess Iphegenia, and
 Prince Varian were buried on Capital on 136 and 137-1116. Prince
 Varian was found dead on 136-1116. Varian\'s brother, Prince Lucan,
 has ascended the throne in a private ceremony.
	 Several human nobles have opposed the ascension of Emperor Lucan, 
claiming that it needs to be confirmed by the Moot. Emperor Lucan has 
exercised the Imperial right to dissolve the Moot for one year.

Shiwonee/Shiwonee (Massilia 1430), 290-1116

	Unrest in Capital continued at 210-1116 after the assasination of
Emperor Strephon by Archduke Dulinor and the oposition of human
elements of the Moot to its succession by Emperor Lucan
	 A message from Duke Neowashee arrived today in Shiwonee with one of 
his personal Jump-6 couriers, calling on all citizens of the Duchy, 
regardless of race, to remain calm and prepare themselves to support 
the Imperial authorities against the rebels led by assasin Dulinor 
and any other uncontrolled elements, if necessary. The duke declared 
that even his personal guard got involved in fightings at Capital, 
and announced his arrival in Shiwonee shortly after the message.

Shiwonee/Shiwonee (Massilia 1430), 314-1116

	Representatives of the Geonee worlds have issued a joint communicate
 today in Shiwonee, firmly establishing the unbreakable loyalty of
 their worlds to the Imperium and its authority, clearly represented
 by the Duchy of Shiwonee.
	Naval bases at Hiponee and Shiwonee, as well as the Colonial and 
Reserve squadrons, are now under special alert due to the possibility 
of attacks by subversive elements. The Scout base at Prindee, under 
command of Imperial Baron Mazun Smythe, has refused to place his 
ships under Naval authority.

Shiwonee/Shiwonee (Massilia 1430), 332-1116

	Duke Darnaaga Neowashee arrived today in Shiwonee, and held a press
 conference immediately. The Duke declared the support of the Duchy to
 Emperor Lucan and warned the worlds of the Duchy about the fact that
 several noble states in Massilia sector have alligned themselves with
 the criminal elements that seek the destruction of the Imperium.
	 "We are the sons of the Ancients, and ours is the responsibility to 
guard civilization. We belong to a Duchy, and we belong to the 
Imperium. In the name of the emperor, we will be the guardians of 
Massilia sector, and beyond." - said the Duke.

Prindee/Shiwonee (Massilia 1330), 352-1116

	 Naval elements assaulted today the Scout base at Prindee, after the
 Scout Commander Baron Smythe refused the direct order of Duke
 Neowashee to submit to Naval command. Part of the Scout personnel
 rebelled against their command, facilitating the naval takeover.
	 Several scout starships, mainly under 400 dt, managed to escape and
 jumped out-system. Baron Smythe has been captured.
Until the Scout Service sector authorities designate a new commander,
the scout base has been placed under direct navy supervision.
 Informed sources estimated over one thousand cassualties in the
 operation. At least ten scout ships were damaged, and three of them
 were utterly destroyed. No naval ships were significatively damaged.
	 Witnesses of the surface assault report that large numbers of
 Llyrnian marines were involved.
	 Several hundreds of scout personnel have been arrested, although 
part of them have been authorized to remain a week at the base for 
Chirper Recovery. A marine garrison has been stationed to guard the 
prisoners.

 Note: Of course, Chirper Recovery is a standard after-battle
 courtesy. Chirpers tend to flee away when a place is assaulted, but
 they usually come back after a few days looking for their masters. If
 a married Geonee prisoner were to be taken off-world immediately,
 this will cause the loss of his Chirper, which implies immediate
 divorce.

Hm...I think your estimate of GNP is off.  Remember, money for imperial
shipbuilding should be Imperial (TL 15 starport A) credits.  A significant
portion of the population of the Imperium is lower TL or starport, and thus
would contribute less per person.  Depending on exactly how you convert local
credits to imperial credits, you probably want an actual figure of 100-200
credits per person.  Also, is that 3% of GNP for the _fleet_, or is it for all
imperial services?

Phil had some last minute things to straighten out at the printers, and it 
wasn\'t going to be back in time for him to mail it out last week.  He was due 
back home yesterday, & was also supposed to mail them out then.

    Big time awesome and rare shooters.  Remember that to get it\'s \'hit the
target with the first shot no matter what the conditions\' ability, SEAL
Team Six had a bigger ammo budget than the entire US Marine Corps.

    I\'d argue the listing of Lee Harvey Oswald.  According to his Marine
records, he was fair shot at best.  
Either he got real lucky or start looking toward the grassy knoll... :-)

I would say that there are cruisers smaller than 30,000 tons, but
they\'re obselete!  The Rebellion Sourcebook (MT) included examples of
TL-11 Vargr cruisers, and "various others" (I don\'t have my books on
hand) in the 10,000-30,000 ton range.  The Reserve Fleets might have
things like this still around, but most would be in planetary fleets (at
least if planetary navies that have jump-capable ships - it\'s implied
somewhere that they don\'t, but I suspect that\'s a guideline, or a
doctrine, rather than a rule).

  "Newly" integrated worlds/subsectors are likely to have reserve fleets
composed of their old independent naval ships, rather than Imperial
handmedowns, (particularly in T4 type early settings).  Of course, the
Imperium hasn\'t been doing much expanding in the last few centuries, so
such non-standard fleets are likely to be fairly rare.

The 5,000-30,000 ton "gap" is a result of the old kinds of ships that
filled this range (cruisers) becoming larger, and the ships below this
(destroyers and other escorts) staying the same size.  There may be "big
escorts", but probably not many.

	The show did mention several attempts to play down the study ...
primarily on the grounds that "our glorious jarheads aren\'t cowards!"
 But that wasn\'t the issue. And if it was debunked, why did combat
training change afterwards? And why did similar followup studies show
an increase?

	A perfect example of the difference between your average fighter in
a firefight and someone who\'s (a) already come to grips with killing,
(b) chosen his position, and (c) probably isn\'t in the middle of a
firefight.

	An extreme example of this is the "duel" described by on of USMC\'s
premiere snipers, Gunny (?) Sergeant Carlos Hathcock. He wound up
trying to hunt down a VC sniper who was trying to get him. After
several false attempts, Sgt Hathcock finally saw a glint of light,
took a chance (he couldn\'t fully see the target), and fired.

	When he and his spotter got there, they discovered his bullet had
gone in the front of the enemy\'s scope, out the back, and into his
eye. In other words, the enemy sniper was a hair\'s-breadth away from
shooting at him.

	More generally, I want a system that takes into account the
situation. A firefight, whether in a garage, engineroom, or jungle,
should result in low hit rates. A carefully planned, "low-stress"
shot under conditions similar to a firing range, should result in
higher rates.

	In fact, Discovery channel had another show on firearms development.
At one time, faced with a competition between a magazine-fed
(==quickly reloaded), and non-magazine fed rifle, both of which could
hold six rounds before needing reloading, the United States Army
*deliberately* chose the one which took longer. The idea back then
was force the soldier to make each shot count.

IMTU, BatRons consist of two Battleships and their associated cruisers,

grouping them into eight-ship squadrons is a strategic mistake.

    'body' => 'Just pondering the reason so many peaceful merchant ships in the
Third Imperium have 6Mcr+, a couple tons of precious hull space,
and a couple of crew positions devoted to weaponry. Some ideas I
came up with:

Peaceful uses: There\'s a PC game called "Elite" where one of the
weapons you can mount on your ship is a mining laser. Perhaps
that Pulse Laser in the turret is intended for salvage, mining, and
anti-(small) asteroid work? The ship master might just figure that
paying the little bit extra to make it combat-capable was worthwhile.
Missile Racks can hold drones, probes, all kinds of neat things
besides explosive missiles. This would be more for science vessels
and scout ships than merchants, unless the Free Trader captain 
picked one up for a research charter. And once she has it, the
captain may decide that laying in a missile or two for self-defense
just makes sense.
Sandcasters - I don\'t know enough about them to figure out peaceable
uses for them, but they\'re cheap and defensive only, so you might
see them even if the only thing they\'re good for is keeping lasers away.
Meson guns, bay weapons, energy weps and particle beams are for
military ships, so we don\'t have to worry about them (The Infamous
Science Ship of Doom notwithstanding).

Insurance: It\'s not reflected in the rules, but it might be that an armed
merchant pays a smaller insurance premium. Just like anti-lock
brakes and seat belts in an automobile affect car insurance, there
would probably be a whole list of ways a shipmaster could reduce his
insurance payment - Anti-Hijack software, defensive weaponry,
up-to-date Crew Certifications, etc. would cost money but might save
money. We\'d need insurance rules for this to be useful. As it is, the only
thing we see in this vein is the requirement that your ship be armed
before you can sign up for a mail contract.

Naval Auxiliary: Was the ship recently called up to military service?
All the standard designs allow for weaponry to be installed - did the
Imperial government subsidize the designs, on the condition that they
be capable of conversion to militarized status? 
If the local Navy commander never has enough starport capacity, he
might just leave the weapons in place when he releases the ship back
into civilian service (with appropriate loans for the crew to buy the
military surplus hardware, of course). That way he can save his starport
for patching warships together again next time the balloon goes up,
all the naval auxiliaries will already have their weapons. The naval
commander may not think it a big deal that a lot of 200-600tn civilian
ships have obsolete military weaponry on them - after all, they\'re no
threat to his 5000tn Destroyers.

Self-Defense: What does a merchant vessel have to protect itself from?
Alien Corsairs. Spacefaring barbarians (if a trader beyond the frontier).
Sudden local conflicts flaring up - if I\'m in starport on a balkanized
world in the Imperium, my triple laser turret may be able to get me
and mine off-planet if all I\'m facing are TL7-8 aerospace fighters.
What if a "local conflict" between two Imperial worlds starts to involve
starmercs and commerce raiding? If a patrol cruiser knows I have
a triple missile rack, he may go chase that freighter over there instead.
And who knows...somewhere in the murky reaches of space, that
impossibility of impossiblities might lurk...the Star Pirate!!!!  <g>
In all these cases, remember that you don\'t necessarily have to be
able to out-fight the opposing ship. Many of these foes may decide to
go after prey with fewer guns after you open up at extreme range, just
to show how many guns you have. 

And of course, having guns on your merchant ship gives you the
ability to do a little privateering of your own....

SWAT are fairly common, lets see (Arlington, Dallas, Fort Worth, Irving,
Grand Prairie, Benbrook, Mansfield, Aledo, and Richardson) police SWAT,
County Sheriff SWAT, Department of Public Safety SWAT, FBI SWAT, US
Marshall SWAT. each with atleaat 4 team members 13 times 4 is 52, which
will be a gross underestimate. As for former SEAL members and former
snipers I can name four former SEAL\'s in my area(I work with one, another
was in the SEAL precursor group), and at least one former military
sniper(Not you Doug). Also we have several iron silhouette shooting groups
in the area around 100 memebers in the DFW area. So there are more awesome
shooters than you think. I perefer to let the skill determine whether or
not you hit. High skill low chance of missing works for me.

SEAL 6 had bigger budget than the USMC, that is I would have see those
figures, in other words I don\'t believe it, someone has exagerated a wee
bit. Just remember that just because it says ammo in the budget does not
mean that they will actually buy ammo it might be other Non PC thingees.

He is listed *officially* as the *lone* sniper of JFK, three shots with a
mediocre rifle and scope in record time, all hitting a target. The
Leatherwood brothers would be proud to make such a shots on a *non* US
political figure.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Whether that is a mistake or not depends on how big a squadron your
designated opposing force makes out of their 200ktn battleships.

A battleship is overkill for everything but one mission: turning chunks of
the enemy\'s biggest warships into E by way of C squared. It may be
that the only good strategic use of a battleship is to group it into
a line-of-battle type squadron and park it somewhere strategically
significant. Otherwise, you risk losing your battleships piecemeal
to his squadron of battleships - which may be able to invade you as
fast as news of their invasion can spread, giving you no time to gather
your scattered battleships into mutually-supporting squadrons.

Imagine the following scenario: We both have eight battleships (and
proper supporting ships), and we\'re facing each other over the frontier
between our two interstellar powers. Your battleships are showing the
flag in every one of four frontier worlds. My battleships are in port
(at the center of my command/control stucture, with fresh crews and
cheap maintenance). A minor incident blows up into a sudden war,
both of our naval headquarters know of it at the same time. 

My eight battleships are already at headquarters. I send them across
the border to where your most distant pair of battleships has just 
(or has not yet) recieved their orders.

My eight battleships meet your two battleships, we kill them with some
minor damage. We get to do this once again, maybe even twice again
before we get to something you have worth defending. I still have
seven (or even eight) battleships, you\'ll be lucky to have four - you
might have only two. Chances are I win.

For squadron concepts to work, you either have to have a lot of squadrons,
or you must ignore low-population planets in favor of critical high-pop
planets. If my route to your capitol could go through six low-pop
worlds, you\'d better sacrifice them if you don\'t want to give me local
superiority wherever I go - as most of your defense fleet will be guarding
worthless dirtballs while I\'m shelling your Imperial Palace. In my turn,
I\'ll ignore your low-pop planets once I have my fuel - I don\'t have the time
to subjugate them, or the ships to hold them if I did. We\'ll take our
entire fleet to your capitol planet, your low-pop hinterworlds we can
clean up later on.

Long Tranh (White Feather, aka Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock) is still a
legegend among snipers.  Among his other feats, he made a kill at 2500
meters with a scope-mounted .50cal MG firing single shot, and pinned down
and destroyed and entire NVA company over a three day period.  He had them
in an open field, and everytime sombody moved, he fired.

When I trained as a sniper, his name was mentioned in the same tones that
baseball fans reserve for Babe Rith, or music fans for Hendrix.  An
absolute master of his art.  He\'s still alive, but extremely ill.  A
shooting competition was held recently to raise money to help him.

I really need to finish ACQ.  In it, you use APs for actions like shooting
and moving.  You also use APs to gain the first shot.  So the players has
to juggle the odds.. don\'t spend AP on the Action/Reaction task to have
more AP for aiming, but the other guy will probably shoot first, or go for
a quick shot and hope you get lucky..

I don\'t know about the budget part, but I have heard that they expended
more rounds per year than the USMC did.  IIRC, it was something like
2000rnds per person, per week.  That is about a 104,000rnds per person, per
year.

I was a player in a Dr. Who-inspired RPG a few years back and the damage
system we used was completely free-form. The referee and players just made
up whatever damage effect they wanted based on the drama of the situation.

IIRC the Amber RPG also has a very free-form combat system (and every other
game mechanic).

Kurt,

Numbers game old boy, that is what it is, the USMC still expended more
rounds total that team 6. Team 6 had few members than the Corps thus a
greater number of rounds expended per man but let us take into accound what
Force Recon expended/fired per man, or say some of the other services
*elite* units. The number of rounds expended can be stacked many ways to
show many things.<G>

Shhhhh! Don\'t give away the secret! ;->  I think *most* GM\'s use a

I\'m prepared to believe that most people weren\'t actually

weren\'t actually firing.

Because it wasn\'t debunked for some time. They believed 
the conclusions - that doesn\'t mean it was right.

> And why did similar followup studies show an increase? 

Perhaps because Marshals orignal data/methods were 
flawed, and they were getting a more accurate (read 
"higher") result?

IMO the reason Vietnam had such a high PTSD rate was 
for two reasons.
1) Vietnam was not a place where units got to be rotated 
out of the front lines, and be safe in the rear, Unlike 
WW2. Troops were always potentially at risk.

2) Measurements are different. I\'ve read a study which 
claimed that some US  units lost 110% of people in the 6 
weeks after D Day, and that approximately 25% were 
"non-wounded casualties" i.e. Shell shock victims.

The same study claimed that there was similar rates in 
the british units, particularly the bomber command (where 
a unit could lose 10% shot down per night - work those 
odds out)  which dealt particularly harshly with "lack of 
Moral Fibre" cases, with no appreciable differences 
compared with other units. 

The US supposedly had quite a lenient and humane 
policy towards people suffering from "battle fatigue" up 
until the battle of the bulge where Patton had some guy 
whacked for "deserting his post" for the encouragement 
of the others.

In partial summary, I think that PTSD has been with us 
for a long time, it just didn\'t have such a fancy name, nor 
quite as many shrinks to identify it. Thus I don\'t regard 
it\'s increase as necessarily validating Marshalls claims.

To address the issue of troops shooting, I\'ve spoken with 
my local historian/strategic studies buff, who mentions 
that there were numbers of troops who were regarded as 
particularly effective, and that this might be because 
while the poorly trained troops like the average american 
grunt who got 6 weeks basic training were indeed 
reluctant to fire their weapons and attract attention to 
themselves, while well trained troops, like the New 
Zealanders and the Germans, were particularly effective. 

In particular German troops who\'d been on the eastern 
front, knew the russians didn\'t take prisoners, and that 
retreating wasn\'t really an option, were ferocious in battle 
because they weren\'t going to survive otherwise. 
Germans were also giving their troops about 4 times as 
long basic training as most of the allies, right up until \'45.

The New Zealanders were used as shock troops in both 
world wars because they were reknown for closing with 
the enemy (highest per capita losses). This may be to do 
with their training, or perhaps the society. (In vietnam we 
had too many volunteers for service, so our army was 
only letting people with at least 3 years service go to 
vietnam. A different picture to the reluctant US draftee 
portrayed in many sources. I\'m sure that this will affect 
the degree of enthusiasm that people will put into their 
combats...) 

I\'m not convinced that the marshal conclusions are due to 
the reasons suggested, poor training, lack of confidence, 
or societal expectations.

In "Immediate Action" by Andy McNabb he claims that 
the SAS training cadre has a bigger ammo budget than 
the rest of the british army.  They were regularly going 
through 5000 rounds per person per day, when the rest of 
the army had budgetry restraints.

Imagine spending 6 weeks, getting up at first light, 
dragging a tea urn out to the range, and a land-rover full of 
bullets, and shooting a pistol until it got dark, then going 
back to barracks...

That was their pistol familiarisation training.

So what is the government code for the Imperial Government?

If the Imperium is government type 3, "Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy -
Government by a restricted minority , with little or no input from the
masses." [the nobility] (MT Ref\'s manual pg 22) than its peacetime
spending would be 0.90 times base and its war spending would be 1.20
times base. 1.20/0.90 = 1.3333

If the Imperium is government type 5"Feudal Technocracy - Government by
specific individuals for those who agree to be rules.  Relationships are
based on performance of ttechnical activities which are mutually
beneficial." [this view of the Imperium would note that most high
Impeial nobles are semicanonically filthy rich & own & control the
megacorporations.] its peacetime spending would be .95 times base and
its wartime spending would be 1.40 times base. 1.40/0.95 = 1.4737

If the Imperium is government type 8 "Civil Service Bureaucracy -
Government by agencies employing individuals selected for their
expertise" [To call the Imperium a type 8 you would have to assume that
the nobility do not really control it but that the bureacracy they
appoint does so.] (op cit) than its peacetime spending would be 1.10
times base & its wartime spending would be 1.20 times base.  1.20/1.10 =
1.0909.

If the government of the Imperium is a type C "Charismatic Oligarchy -
Government by a select group, organization, or class enjoying
overwhelming confidence of the citizenry." [the nobility] (op cit) then
its peacetime spending would be 1.20 times base and its wartime spending
would be 1.50 times base. 1.50/1.20 = 1.25

So the Imperium might well spend only a little more in wartime than it
does in peacetime.  I would be inclined to call the Imperium a
government type 3 which would mean its wartime spending was 133.33% of
its peacetime spending

Another option for determining the budget ratio would be to individually
calculate the revenue of each planet in the Imperium in both peacetime &
wartime & compare them, this method might be the most logical but would
be rather numbers heavy an approach.

My take on this is that the technical personnel who activate old ships
are the same personnel who repair new ones & that therefore they were
too busy to activate ships as rapidly as they might have done in other
circumstances.

If you look whre most of Canada\'s military recruits come from (and I
really don\'t know much about the military - this is mostly IMO) they\'re
from the east - New Brunswick & Newfoundland - coincidentally, the two
poorest provinces in Canada. New Zeland, while very plesant, has never
struck me as a rich country - I think that for the most part, people in
poor places tend to be more eager to sign up for the military as it\'s a
much better career option that unemployment or gutting fish (or shearing
sheep) for a living.

By comparison, during the Vietnam era a lot of Americans pictured
themselves doing something a lot more enjoyable than sitting in a
foxhole with wet feet waiting to get shot.

I hope no vetrans on this list will take offence when I say that I don\'t
picture military life as being especially comfortable or enjoyable much
of the time and it is a lifestyle that, given a choice, most people
would not choose unless they had few other options.

[Well, that is kind of offensive, but I do think it is the unfortunate
truth - put a nice way, military life is hard and most people are soft.
I have often wondered if I could have made it in the military.]

Sounds very plausible.

No one ever said that the Imperium was using its assets optimally. Why,
they can\'t even do something as easy as prevent piracy! ;-)

And Walter Smith replies:

If FFW is an accurate depiction of major warfare in the Traveller universe
(not necessarily the case), opposing enemy forces are fleets composed of a
number of squadrons. So 4 2 ship squadrons would be much the same as one
8 ship squadron. Especially since the Imperium canonically split up some
of their BatRons in peacetime.

Maybe, but the Imperium have used Tigresses for enforcing the interdict at
Andor.

Don\'t forget that according to _Striker_ the Imperium allow its member
worlds to retain 70% of their military budget for system defense. We
don\'t know just how many jump-capable ships planetary navies generally
build  --  I expect that will differ from planet to planet  --  but a
large part of that will be spend on non-jump-capable system defenses.
That means that even if all regular and reserve fleet units are away
from a planet, it is still defended by at least half again as many
vessels as are absent.

In addition to the eight battleships you\'d have the equivalent of 12-18
more in system defenses (depending on how much of your budget you use on
your army).

Not if the two battleships are using the SOP I worked out in a long-ago
TCS game: Move about outside the 100 diameter limit in a semi-random
manner and _never be withing weapon range of wherever you were one and
two weeks ago.

That way the enemy can never jump in within firing range of your ships
except by sheer accident, because they can\'t know where your ships will
be. And as soon as your ships see the odds against them, they jump.

Furthermore, even if your ships are stationed at a predictable point,
the attacking admiral may not be all that thrilled with the idea of
jumping in withing firing range of them. You see, even with the tight
arrival jump option, his ships will arrive spread out across a span
of about an hour (bell curve propabilities). That means his first
ships may very well be outnumbered, allowing the defenders to start
shooting while those attackers that has arrived are still in the
minority.

since a well-prepared ship can jump out 20 minutes after it initiates
jump procedures, the attacker could wind up losing one of his own
ships without even defeating any of the defenders (though admittedly
the odds favor him getting both at the prize of one of his own).

But that\'s not the worst part of it from the POW of the attacker. If
you randomly move about your battleships he has no way of being
certain that the two ships are the only ones he\'ll meet. And if by
bad luck he happens to jump in while you have 4 or 6 battleships in
the system, he could lose all of his ships...

It certainly isn\'t very exact ;-).

Regular ships, possibly (though I could give you an argument for auxiliary
ships like tankers and transports being built at the level suitable to
their jump number), but there are indications that not all regular ships
are TL 15. Colonial ships are built at the highest level in their
subsector and system defenses are built at every level from 8 to 15.
Also consider that the planets with the biggest production is the ones
with the highest TLs, so the low-Tl planets contribut the least to the
budget. But yes, the figure is propably a bit off (unless you use
_Striker_ figures where the per-capita income goes up with the TL  --
IIRC an industrial TL 15 planet can get close to Cr30,000).

>Also, is that 3% of GNP for the _fleet_, or is it for all imperial services?

It is the defense budget for the individual planets. Of this the Imperium
takes 30% (half for its regular fleets and half for its reserve fleets).
The remaining 70% is used for system defense and the army. A planet with
a breathable atmosphere will use 40% (of its 70%, ie. 28% of the total)
on the army, but one without will only use 6% (4.2% of total). The
Imperium\'s cut will presumably have to be shared between the Navy and
the Army, but IMO the Imperial Army is not very large (perhaps 6%?).

I will leave it to any Kiwis on the list to reply to Ethan about whether
or not New Zealand is a "rich country".  My understanding of it is, it
ain\'t totally zipperland.  Neither Australia (where I live) nor New
Zealand have ever had large military forces, except in the world wars.  

I\'m going to swap over to talking about Australia now, to avoid making
mistakes about NZ.  Australia had next to no military forces at the
beginning of either world war.  In the case of World War II, it had a
regular army of about 2250 personnel, and a militia of 80,000.  The
militia had increased greatly over the two or three years before the
war, when it was obvious that war was likely.  There was no
conscription.

During the First World War, two referenda to introduce conscription were
defeated, largely on the strength of opposition from the Catholic
bishops, the Left, and the (Irish) Catholic sections of the working
class.  Of those who volunteered, about half had been born in Britain,
rather than Australia.

The situation in World War II was vaguely similar, although there was
conscription into the Militia.  The end result was about 640,000
Australians, out of a population of about 7,000,000, wound up in the
armed forces.  Few saw combat.  Of those who did, a high proportion were
from the volunteer forces, who had joined up to fight the Germans before
Pearl Harbour.

At least some of the volunteer forces would have to be regarded as
"elite troops", as several unit suffered extreme (around 90%) casualties
in certain situations, without collapsing!  The Australian commando
(special forces) units, on the other hand, were not regarded as an elite
(but some were!)  While several Australian units were taken prisoner,
none disgraced themselves.

The current Australian Defence Force (regular Army etc) was formed on
the basis of three battalions of volunteers from both militia and
volunteer divisions who formed part of the garrison of Japan after the
war. 

National Service (conscription) existed during the Vietnam War, leading
to a very large number of Masters degrees, as University students were
exempt from the draft.  These students were the basis of the
Anti-Vietnam war protest movements.  (The previous statement is based on
anecdotal evidence from people (leaders) who were there).

The current Australian military is an all-volunteer force.  There is a
term called "AJ".  It stands for "Army Jerk".  The ADF does not possess
a high status within Australian society, although its officers are
eagerly poached by corporations....

The NZ defence force is similar to, but smaller than, the ADF.  

I have gone through this rave mainly because someone else mentioned NZ
troops as a pretty good bunch.  The Australians were pretty much the
same.  A hint - I also play WWII miniatures - I know something about
WWII!  There is no particular "warrior" tradition in Australia and NZ -
neither country is a particular exporter of warriors in the way 15th and
16th century Scotland was (although there have been mercenaries from
both countries - but this is technically illegal).  There is no
particular "economic draft" in either country either - no-one "joins the
army to go to college", or anything of the sort, although there are
scholarships for students who join the defence forces - someone I went
to school with was a doctor on a hospital ship in the Gulf War, because
he had taken the bucks while he was a student.

I said at the beginning of this tirade that I was going to lead Ethan
Henry to the Kiwis.  I was wrong.  Ethan Henry was wrong.

I have lots of friends and family in the military, always try to take

degrees of magnitude worse if these people weren\'t guarding the

but they spend a lot of their time doing unfun or even dangerous
things. Thanks guys.

ObTrav: what does the average Imperial citizen think of the Imperial
military? Are they heroes in the Spinward Marches, or agents of 
Imperial Oppression? (Probably matters for this whether there\'s
just been a war or not). How about in Core? Are they considered
relics of an old and embarrasing past?
Imagine someone who is used to all kinds of courtesy for wearing
his Imperial Marine uniform, when he\'s transferred to a sector that
has no use for "those jackbooted Impie thugs".

Lots of good basic info on system defense snipped...

...which might be irrelevant if we start talking about battleship-based
fleets instead of just squadrons. Eight fleets will beat four or six
fleets enough times to make a commander willing to fight at those
odds, and when we start talking about that many ships it becomes
irrelevant where in the system they are, or whether the invader
is spread out an hour or not - when you start talking large numbers,
factors like time and location start to abstract out.

Though it does make sense to give your commanders on the frontier
orders to retreat if faced by superior odds. If you only have one
homeworld worth protecting, it might even work to have them retreat
to it. If you have a few, things get nice and dicey - is my thrust
headed towards you Imperial Palace, or your starship construction
yards a couple parsecs away, or your industrial center a couple
parsecs the other direction?

That\'s why spies love to steal naval strategy plans...<g>

And if the frontier worlds are worthless dirtballs, they\'ll have 
inconsequential system defense of their own - a rescue cutter and
an aging 400-tn system defense boat won\'t even be noticed by 
a fleet of 200ktn battleships. If you want to seriously defend these
worlds, you\'ll have to use system defense assets built at your
homeworld(s) - which means that if I bypass these otherwise-worthless
frontier worlds, you\'ll not have these assets to defend your homeworld
with. Concentration of force - it\'s not going to affect either of our
empires if you lose or keep a pop-3 planet, you might lose your
pop-A planet if you strip some of it\'s defenses to protect that pop-3
world.

Hmm, seems to me that if the Marines fire X rounds and SEAL 6 fires Y

First, thanks to Walt for useful suggestions and opinions.

I dug up Supplement 9 (_Fighting Ships_), the _Spinrward Marches

<<Good Stuff Snipped>>

One source you missed, or decided to omit, is Fighting Ships of the
Shattered Imperium.  I was looking over it last evening and they had a
rather good essay on the squadron concept.

I think it\'s on the CD.

If you\'re talking about the stuff that was at ftp.ocf.berkely.edu, you won\'t
be able to *see* the directories, but you *can* loot it all by issuing a
\'get *\' command.

Travellers\' Digest #14, "The Uniforms of the Terran Occupation Force" details 
Marine uniforms.

Rank for enlisted Marines is indicated by a pattern of discs on a square patch, 
worn on the upper sleeves and front and rear of headgear. 

   "The \'Cross\' system of enlisted rank marking, in effect from 979, denotes E1 
   to E3 with, respectively, no discs, one disc at the left, and one disc each 
   on the left and right edges of the square.  E4 to E6 add a disc to the top, 
   and E7 to E9 add one at the bottom edge."

The wording is uncertain - do all of rank E4 to E6 add a single disc to the 
top, or does each rank E4 to E6 add a disc?

Branch is indicated by a triangle attached below the rank square.

Appointed unit senior NCOs (company, battalion, and regiment sergeant majors, 
usually E7, E8, and E9 respectively) dispense with the Cross insignia, and 
instead wear a device on the sleeve above the cuff:
   company sergeant major:   Imperial sunburst
   battalion sergeant major: Imperial sunburst in a wreath
   regiment sergeant major:  Imperial sunburst in a larger wreath surmounted by 
                             the Imperial crown

Officers (of all Imperial Armed Forces) consists of one to three silver (black 
on field dress) sunburts, called "pips", for ranks O1 to O3, one to three gold 
(grey on field dress) pips for ranks O4-O6, and one to four gold (grey on field 
dress) four-pointed stars for ranks O7-O10.  These are worn atop each shoulder 
and in the center of the chest on the combat environment suit.  (Another system 
is described later in the article for service and dress uniforms.)

OK, you asked for it!!

I\'m GMing a PbEM game now, called The Scattered Worlds.  It very non
canon, with the players  (one scout, one merchant engineer, and two navy
guys) being formerly in the service of The New Home Confederation, a
collection of worlds just coming out of a very long night situation. 
Several old human colonies from the ancient Sivoloc Empire have been
found, as well as what may be the remnants of that same empire.  The
Sivoloc were virtually wiped out in a series of huge wars, always with
aliens, as they were apparently quite xenophobic, and the entire region
for the campaign was demolished.  The players have presently found
themselves stranded on a comet orbiting a star on the fringes of the
Confederation, while searching for a particular item for a mysterious
women they met shortly after mustering out.  The ship that the former
scout in the group last served on has been found destroyed, and the ship
that did it has now blown away the groups own ship.  They are currently
exploring a strange alien structure within the comet, while those that
destroyed their ship are beginning to land on the surface, hunting for
them.  Frankly, I don\'t know how they\'re going to get out of this one  ;)

I\'m sure you left us an out or 3 in there someplace.  We just have to *FIND* it.

    'body' => 'I\'m running a PBEM set in MOVOTTU (my own version of the Traveller
universe ;-).  The game is set several thousand years after something
destroyed a mythical empire called the Imperium.  Whatever destroyed
it, completely destroyed it...at least in this area...and brought on
the "dark times" where everyone regressed to what we\'d call TL0 and
lost virtually all information on what had gone before.  Exactly what
happened before, during or after that time has been lost, what little
that *is* remembered is in the form of myths, legends, and children\'s
stories.  

As societies slowly rediscovered science it became obvious that humans
originated elsewhere.  Scientists have advanced number of theories
about how mankind came to be spread across all the known populated
worlds. Currently the two most popular are that once there was a vast
empire that spread mankind then collapsed, and that humanity is the
product of simple parallel evolution and interbreeding that has
occurred as dozens of societies rose visited nearby stars then sank
back into the "dark times."

The campaign is set in area near the end of a long star main called
the Quental Main locally where several societies have recently
reentered space and are competing with each other.  The PC\'s are
citizens of the Confederated Systems of Argent, a collection of a
dozen worlds, which has been at war with the neighboring Zeristu
Empire intermittently for most of 100 years.  Coreward of both the CSA
and Zeristu are hundreds of systems, almost completely unexplored and
containing unknown aliens and uncontacted humans, new markets, ancient
artifacts, and who knows what all.  Both empires are expanding slowly
along this main, but have run into several independent systems that
have resisted forced incorporation by Zeristu and peaceful union with
the CSA. 

The "hook" that connects the various PC\'s together is their
great-great grandfather Akus Moby.  Akus has died and left them an
inheritance, a starship.  The PC\'s only have to travel from Argent to
Mark and prove that they are Moby\'s heirs to collect it...oh, and they
have to "work it" for the next seven years on the Quental Main to get
a clear title.  

So far, the group (two ex-scouts, two merchants, a cashiered CPO, an
archaeologist, and couple of...shady characters) has discovered and
explored an ancient Imperial site on Gorath, engaged in various sorts
of vandalism, b&e, and assaults, been almost witnesses to (and
suspects in) a murder aboard a liner, and wrangled endlessly about who
should be boss and run things.  ;-> 

Currently they have taken working passage on a far trader heading from
Beck to Mark, and have just survived the explosion of a steam coolant
pipe in Engineering.  Once they get to this system\'s mainworld expect
more hilarity!

Ships for Emerging Markets
====================
Once a reasonable level of trade between neighbouring worlds becomes
established, and the space lanes are relatively secure, then its time
for the shipping corporations and governments to move in. 

Tramp traders are all well and good on the wild frontier but once
stability is established, and a reasonable infrastructure is in place,
the market is ready for a more professional service.

To satisfy this market Stones Throw Shipyards announces the launch of
its highly profitable, entry level "Contact" series of freighters and
liners.

These ships are the end result of a rigorous design and testing process
with many designs assessed for profitability, ruggedness, flexibility
and practicality. All ships are designed to meet or exceed the very
latest Imperial standards. We don\'t expect you to take our word for it,
we give you the figures straight and let you judge for yourselves (and
unlike some of our competitors we include everything and use realistic
figures!).

And don\'t worry about inadequate infrastructure in emerging markets,
these ships can go anywhere. They are designed to operate in sub-optimal
conditions with ease. They can operate from a high gravity down-port,
they can scoop and refine their own fuel, and carry more than adequate
deterrence. With a high level of automation and thoughtful design these
ships are a pleasure to operate.
 
First of all what are we offering:

First Contact Liner
==============
Our "First Contact" liner, as its name suggests, is designed to be the
first dedicated passenger liner to be used in a new market. When
passenger trade between adjacent worlds approach 2000 return passengers
per year, then this is the liner for you.

This liner carries at least 100 first class passengers, 100 business
class passengers, and 100 economy class passengers. I say *at least*
because in line with our policy of painting a realistic, rather than
rosy, picture this is assuming worst case of all rooms single occupancy.

Like all of our liners it is designed to be profitable at the 50%
utilisation level, while still being able to undercut standard rates by
25% or more on price. This gives scope for use in marginal markets,
allows flexible pricing, and enables you to weather downturns in the
market. 

For the more developed market we have variants of this liner for the
different market segments. Our "High Contact" liner is designed for the
more discerning traveller with luxury and personal service in mind. The
"Business Contact" liner is for regular business passengers with
superior accommodation. Finally our "Street Contact" liner is for the
regular traveller, looking for value. Specifications and financial
analyses for these variants are available on request.

All our Contact series of liners cost under 200 MCr. The First Contact
liner is just MCr 195. Such a low price for such a big liner (1500DT) is
possible due to the standard, tried and tested, design. This also keeps
down the cost of spares and maintenance.

How did we arrive at this design? Well we assessed the profit curve for
a variety of different size liners with different levels of
accommodation, propulsion  and automation. The profit curve rises
quickly at first, but levels out just before 1500DT. Sure you could get
an extra 1 or 2% return on investment by buying liners twice the size.
But considering the flexibility, economy and market penetration enabled
by a smaller design, why bother?

Passenger fares to achieve a 5% profit at 50% utilisation are:

High        Cr 6400 (large stateroom - high quality food & service) 
Business Cr 5100 (large stateroom - standard quality food & service)
Economy Cr 3500 (small stateroom - standard quality)


First Contact Freighter
=================
Stones Throw Shipyards are proud to announce the arrival of their 3000
DT entry level bulk freighter. Using an exhaustive design process we
have come up with a truly awesome freight carrier offering unparalleled
performance at an entry level price of just MCr 420. It is capable of
carrying over 2400DT of freight and able to undercut freight market
price by more than 5% when only 80% loaded.  So once trade between
adjacent worlds exceeds 50,000 DT per annum its time to step in and
start signing those contracts.

Notes
=====
All figures are prepared to Imperial Standard guidelines or better
[Akins FFS2]. Costs include Ship\'s Payment, Depreciation, Insurance,
Maintenance, Fuel, Salaries, Life Support and Berthing.

In line with conservative accounting practice all figures are based on
worst case assumptions and you therefore can expect much higher returns
than indicated. In particular figures are based on only 25 trips per
year and life support costs of KCr2 per person. Increase the number of
trips or reduce the life support costs and profits rise steeply.

A detailed economic analysis is available on request.

I\'m sure you will agree these are very practical and profitable market
solutions.

So, how do you shield a planet from a supernova?

Now, we need to eliminate the charged particles, which will be spread
out a lot more in time. The trick here is distance and a magnetic field

take an utterly impractical magnetic loop to shadow the planet, if you
put it a
ways off -- you probably can\'t trap the particles, but you can scatter
them
with a field a lot weaker than your average planetary magnetic field.  I
really
don\'t know the exact scale of doing this, but it doesn\'t seem
impossible.

So, how possible does any of this seem given Imperial technology?

How about a few hundred Bussard Ramjets (TL9?) between you and the
supernova. They catch the ionized medium in their magnetic ramscoops and
fuse it for thrust, thrusting laterally so that the ions are directed
away from the planet. The scoops will cause a lot of scatter too. A
series of overlapping layers of these should drastically reduce the
particles reaching the planet. But is it enough? And what will the ions
do to your star? I don\'t think you will be able to shield that!

We\'re talking apples and oranges here. It is faster to bring a handgun
to bear...yes, that\'s the primary reason handguns exist.

However for long range aiming accuracy, a pistol will lose out to a
rifle every time, and a large part of the reason is that the sight
distance is so much shorter with a pistol.

Finally, quickly aiming the two are completely different; you \'point\' a
pistol more than you aim it, the reverse is true for a rifle. (I know
I\'m being a bit confusing here...)

Well, if he went via miltary transport, he\'ll have been warned about
wearing his uniform when off duty. If he went via civilian transport,
then it\'ll depend on which end wrote the orders. If the destination end
did, they may include a warning as part of a "breifing packet" type of
thing. 

The military has to deal with that sort of thing *now* and they are
pretty good about warning folks in advance. Though often the warnings
may be "unofficial" and passed on throught non-com\'s "network" that is
what keeps the military running. :-)

Kurt,

There is not such thing as "Simple Accounting" in any military.<G> Many
things can be *hidden* in plain sight by inventive minds in such budget.

As for X and Y well the rounds per marine and Special Ops is what it should
be. I would want the Spec Ops to be better at conventional firearms than
general Marine. 

But I think that all infantry units should have more live fire than they
currently get. 

But the budget of say the Marines has some expensive ammo that the Spec Ops
have no need for like 8 inch howitzer rounds, or depleted uranium anti-tank
rounds, so unless the Spec Ops are playing extremely expensive ammo on
large scale the Marines ammo budget in money will be bigger.

How many of you out there can name the various *elite* units that each
branch of the US military has?

>What will hapen if the grid or exterior coils are hit in combat ???

The coil is internal.  There are two, actually. one near the bow
through which the hydrogen is injected and one near the stern (called
the ring) where the wormhole is pinched shut.

The grid is *inside* the hull armor next to the inner skin of the
ship. When it is charged it projects an energy field that extends
through the armor out to about 3 meters.

>Will the ship be able to enter Jumpspace( redundant systems ???)!!!

The grid has redundancy built in, so a *few* gaps can be compensated
for.  The larger the gaps the thinner the boundary and the more chance
of jumpspace intruding into the ship.

The coils aren\'t expendable.  If the coils are damaged the ship will
either misjump or won\'t jump at all.  But, because the coils are
inside the armor, except at the open bow during jump injection they
are pretty well protected. 

IMTU, of course.

The length of the barrel has something to do with the accurracy of the
shot as well.  Not the aim, but the actual path of the slug.  Pistols
are inherently less accurate beyond some short range.

I don\'t know if this is true or not, but I\'d think "hip firing" either
a rifle or pistol would suffer about the same aiming penalty.

Of course, I\'m not a shooter.  My experiences are those of a small
game hunter and I haven\'t hunted in 25 years. ;->  So, what do I know.

That\'s an awful lot of passengers.  I don\'t think that many are possible

these are non-pc ships and don\'t abide by the listed rules.

However, the question is:  Has anybody designed a ship by starting with a

expected cargo/passengers? These would obviously be specialized vehicles.

I\'m not sure any of the standard classifications for planetary governments
really works (due to the communiciations problems), but fortunately it is
not relevant. According to _Striker_ the Imperium gets 30% of what each
individual government use for defense. Thus it supposedly gets 30% of 0.9
times base in peacetime and 30% of 1.2 times base in wartime from each
self-perpetuating oligarchy, 30% of 0.95 times base in peacetime and 30%
of 1.4 times base in wartime from all its feudal technocracies, etc.
Please note that this mixes rules from two different rules sets. The 30%
comes from _Striker_, but the government modifiers come from _TCS_. (Or
are they in _Striker_ too? I forget.)

I say supposedly, because I\'d like to propose a slightly simpler system
that, IMO, makes a bit more sense, namely that the Imperium gets a fixed
percentage of each planet\'s GWP, regardless of government type. Otherwise
the Imperium\'s cut would change every time there was a change of government
(or every time the Scouts reclassified the _same_ government as another
type!)

The system I propose is that the Imperium gets 1% of GWP in peacetime. On
the average individual planets spend 2% of their GWP on defense. This works
out as the official 3% of GWP in peacetime with 33.3% (instead of 30%) of
that going to the Imperium. Not, IMO, canon-breaking.

The thing is, according to _Striker_ wartime spending can go as high a 15%.
(I suspect that it can\'t stay that high permanently, but there are no rules
about that). This means a five-doubling of military budgets instead of the
10 to 50% increases from _TCS_. My explanation for that is that _TCS_ deals
with small political units living in a state of tension far higher than
the peacetime Imperium. The _TCS_ figure of Cr500/citizen for naval forces
alone (army forces are _not_ not included in this figure) is already 5% of
GWP if we assume a GWP of Cr10,000/citizen. So I assume that the base _TCS_
figure is actually 10% of GWP with half the money going to the navy. This
would make the highest possible wartime government modifier equal to 15%
of GWP, which fits neatly with _Striker_.

But as mentioned before, that means that the wartime budget for the
Imperium is 500% of its peacetime budget instead of the 110-150% we
get with _TCS_ rules.

>So the Imperium might well spend only a little more in wartime than it
>does in peacetime.

Only if you go by _TCS_ rules. And if you do, don\'t you think that you
should also go by the _TCS_ budget figures? Which happens to be
Cr500/citizen for the naval forces alone instead of roughly 70% of
Cr300/citizen.

Well, you could do it for half a dozen representative subsectors and
multiply the average by 300.

That\'s my take too.

Reactivating an _AHL_ Class cruiser will take about 15 weeks. Repairing a
shot-up ship will take one to eight weeks depending on the nature of the
damage. So certainly repairs will have priority over reactivating. (By the
same token reactivating will have priority over new construction).

But by the _TCS_ rules Trin alone has a shipyard capacity of 12,000,000 T
in wartime. For Trin to push reactivating the _Arrival Vengeance_ down the
priority list for six years because of battle repairs, the Vargr and the
Aslans would have to have shot up (but not destroyed) roughly 85 _Tigress_
Class battleships (or an correspondingly higher number of smaller ships)
per year for six years to tie up Trin alone. Multiply that with the
shipyard capacity of Glisten, Rhylanor, Mora, Magash (0316 Deneb), Starn
(1417 Deneb), Atadl (3015 Deneb), Tobia (3215 Trojan Reach), and Lintl
(0503 Reft), and you can multiply that number by at least a factor ten.

850 _Tigresses_ per year for 6 years, that would be about 5000. I don\'t
think that sounds at all plausible, do you?

My suggestion would be that the sector and subsector dukes has the
authority to declare a \'state of emergency\' during which they are
entitled to demand a tax rate of 5% of GWP rather than 1% and also
entitled to demand that their planets go on a war footing. Such a
declaration would always be subject to later review, and any duke
found to have panicked without ground would propably be in big
trouble. Anyway, I don\'t suppose all of the Imperium went on a
war footing during the 5FW, but I certainly think the Domain of Deneb
and propably also Corridor (I imagine that whenever the Corridor
Armada (OK, Fleet) is away from Corridor, the systems there gets
a bit antsy) did go on a war footing. Possibly also Vland.

  Wouldn\'t the Domain of Deneb had a simple lack of a pressing need to
re-activate ships at the highest possible rate? They weren\'t sufffering
significant combat attrition, and there\'s no need to interfere with their
own infrastructure w/o a war for those ships to fight, is there?

This means your capital ships are several hours away from the primary 
world - which makes one wonder what the point of having them there is: they
can\'t respond to a commerce or facilities raid, and (since they\'re only two
of them) can\'t deal witha  a major fleet attack.

It\'s interesting to note that it\'s implicit in mImperial deployment (and in
FFW) that civilian populations are essentially off-limits to attack, since
none of the deployments discucssed are capable of defending worlds from
strategic attack...

TMP has terrible rules, but in spite of that it is an AWESOME game. We
played it using a homebrew rules set, and it would probably work great
with the T2K rules too.

Don\'t recognize it from the vague description, but if it had no title,
you have obviously not got the whole product.

Most of the stuff is still available through at least one mail order
web-based game store. If you don\'t find it with an alta vista search,
drop me a line and I\'ll try to find the name of it.

In fact, one of the reasons for MP\'s decline is because
T2K stole its thunder as the favored "postapocalypse
with real-life equipement genre" game.

>(see how that is sorta Traveller related?)

Heck, just after it came out, I described TNE as
"Morrow Project in space." It even has a "vampire."

What, you thought it was a coincidence that there\'s
an FF&S version of a Commando V-150 in the RCES

But there is a big difference between the two...

In MP, you are there to help rebuild civilization, an altruistic and needs
of the many type goal.  In T2K, the goal is to stay alive and off the other
guy before he offs you.  It is a very "Me" centered game.

That is exactly what TNE was portrayed as.  Morrow Project in Space.
Unfortunately, everything that was published to support it was more along
the lines of T2K in Space.

Just my opinions.

a scout or courier to the destination fleet upon departure. I figure one
per Capitol Ship plus 2 per world is the baseline.

AssaultRons are ground assault... and specialized. Figure one per High pop
(my SWAG, make no mistake), capable of carying "hundreds of battalions"
[FS].

The forces totals are for IMPERIAL ships, couting Regular, Reserve, and
Colonial squadrons. Colonials are from TL9+, Pop 9+ worlds. [FS]

System Squadrons are not assigned to any fleet. THey exist in any system
with TL9+ and Pop 4+, and are locally manned and maintained. Thus they are
outside our considerations.

So a nominal Numbered fleet might be:

1 BatRon		 6  MTd
2 CruRon		 2.4  MTd
1 AssaultRon		 1.2  MTd
4 DesRon		 0.24 MTd
Auillaries and scouts	 1.5  MTd (scattered throughout other Rons)
1 TankRon		 3.0  MTd <-- 12x 500KTd Tankers from FS
			----
                	14.34 MTd

Minimal Fleet
1 CruRon		1.2
1 AssaultRon		1.2
2 DesRon		0.12
Aux and Sct		0.5
TankRon (small)		0.5	<-- using smaller tankers...
			----
			3.52 MTd

A huge Fleet:
2 BatRon		15   MTd <-- one of .5MTd\'s and one of .75MTd\'s
2 DreadRons		 4.8 MTd <-- 200KTd Dreadnoughts [S9]
4 CruRon		 4.8 MTd
2 AssaultRon		 2.4 MTd
20 DesRons		 1.2 MTd
Auillaries and scouts	15.0 MTd <-- half total tonnage so far...
4 TankRons              12.0 MTd
                        ----
			55.2 MTd



Figure about 11-30 MTd per Numbered Regular and Numbered Reserve Fleet.
320 Numbered Fleets and 320 Numbered reserve fleets... 640 fleets at (say
20MTd), around 6.4GTd ... 6.4 E9 Td, roughly, a conservative estimate.

Not counting system fleets, which may add another 1E9 or so in tonnage. [SWAG]

All of this is naval and scout, excluding scout-only craft like survey
cruisers and XBoats. For X-Boats, I\'d figure on 3 per segment of the
Express Boat lines, plus 1 scout per planet not Navalized, thus not in the
pools, on X-Mail service to non-route worlds. So, add 110KTd in Scouts, and
probably 50KTd in XBoats, plus a 600Td tender in each leg, adding another
300KTd... chump change, really.[gueses based upon craft sizes and
maintenance and misjump rates, probably 50%low for XBoats; scouts counts
only those not subject to navalization and thus not under naval figures].

SO, roughly 7.5 E9 Td in imperial service. Not counted are Depot Fleets,
which are the mothballed reserve of obsolescant craft.

Joint Imperial Services Rank Symbols are:

O1 to O3: 1 to three small "Imperial Starbursts"
04 to O6: 1 to 3 Large "Imperial Starbursts"
O7 and up: 1 star (not starburst) per grade higher than O6.

Enlisted use white discs on a colored square, in patterns... See the TD

  And it fixes the oddity that any world that neglects its\' own defense
doesn\'t pay much for the IN (30% of diddly = ?), or pays more for defending
itself. The latter might work if it\'s meant to reflect Imperial concern at
worlds overspending to acquire local influence (or local dominance in the
event of a civil war). Perhaps the minimum of 1% should be modified to add
30%/one-third of anything over the 3% average?

Yes, that\'s why I said \'part\' of the reason. And with a modern pistol barrel
that\'s less important than the fact that rifle and pistol slugs tend to have
considerably different aerodynamic properties, as well.  Pistol slugs are
short and squat, rifle slugs are long and pointy, to generalize enormously.
They also tend to have considerably different velocities, as well. All of
these affect accuracy and range.

Well, part of the problem here is we\'re talking about weapons optimized for
pretty much opposite conditions. Hip firing a pistol, IRL, will be easier for
an experienced pistol shot than hip firing a rifle will be for an experienced
rifle shot.

But pistols are designed for close in combat, hence the shorter barrels: it
makes them easier to draw, carry, and aim at short ranges, it takes less
motion to traverse a pistol x degrees than it does a rifle, which is also why
the sight radius is important...variation from the target point with a pistols
sights leads to a greater error of actual aim point than you get with a rifle,
at equal ranges. 

So the effects are all sort of bound up in each other.

From the answers I have received here it seems likely that I have picked up
the basic rules.  I\'ll open it up when I get home tonight and see.

There was a book called "The Morrow Project" with more or less the same
"after the war" recovery theme, but this book had mental powers as well as
some tech. It was a ~150 page teen fiction book, probably published very
early eighties or late 70\'s.  Anyone know which came first, the book or the
game?

(one bit of the story was one of the characters being poisoned by a mutant
snail on the beach.  It was over 15 years ago that I read it however!)

People on this list have mentioned the Al Morai Route Protectors

Is it OTU?

I\'m trying to get a feel for the Imperial policy on privately-owned

fully-armed AHL-class Cruiser _Emissary_ outside Imperial Space
to get around the Imperium\'s laws on demilitarizing warships sold to the

The Spinward Marches Campaine. The ships are Gazels, I can\'t recall how
many they had, but they didn\'t have many ... but then Al Mora only had 52
or so merchant ships in there fleet.

yup ...

I think it was all the weapons, probably because the navy has usese for
laser turrets and missile bays, but I am not sure on this, as I don\'t have
AHL with me.

The problem I have with this is that the vanilla economics section is
incomplete. It doesn\'t include the major costs of depreciation and
insurance for example. If you adopt sensible figures for these then it
just isn\'t profitable to carry freight at Cr1000 per DT in anything much
smaller than a 3000 DT dedicated freighter, at least at TL12*. High and
mid passage rates are reasonable, perhaps even generous, low passage and
freight rates are loss making. 

In other words you have to break some of the vanilla rules to make other
vanilla rules make financial sense (at least to me and I hope to any
merchants or accountants on the list).

You could argue that basic insurance is included in the price of the
mortgage, as a risk premium. This has the advantage of simplicity and
has minimal impact on canon, but it does make the banks profit wafer
thin, and IMO it was already very low.  But you can\'t ignore
depreciation. As a ship is worth 25% of original price after 40 years,
then annual average depreciation is 1.875%.

As we are discussing a supposedly hard science fiction game, then IMO
the economics should be equally as hard. So a small free trader design
that would satisfy me economically would have to break the rules, and
one that would stick to the rules wouldn\'t satisfy me economically.
Perhaps we should increase the number of trips per year (32?), or
perhaps increase the price per DT of freight (Cr1500?), or some other
cost saving or revenue generating device?

I don\'t have a problem creating such ships but my take on what canon to
bend, or reality to ignore, wouldn\'t be the next persons, so there is
little point posting them to the list. 

* Note that by TL15 the freight figure starts to look bearable. Perhaps
the freight rate should vary by planets TL, say increasing by Cr100 for
each TL below 15?

Well, I think that\'s kind of strong, but I\'ll glad admit that I really
don\'t know much about New Zealand and that my sum knowledge of Australia
is from having lived there for about 7 or 8 month a few years back (on
university exchange). I really didn\'t mean any offence.

I\'ll gladly restrict my comments to Canada, if only to reduce the
potential population of people who can flame me.

In my non-scientific survey of the few dozen people I know, the military
service is a more popular career option in the east that in the rest of
Canada. Coincidentally, but perhaps not correlated, is the fact that the
east is economically depressed compared to the rest of Canada. There are
fewer job opportunities in places like Newfoundland and the jobs that
are there are usually labour jobs, like fishing or working on an oil rig
- - while these are fine jobs (well, except that all the fish are gone and
the oil rigs are deadly), I can\'t imagine that they look a lot better
than joining the army and learning some potentially useful skills to the
average 18 year old.

<off topic rant>
Canada has all sorts of indirect government-sponsored job transfer
programs. The military could be considered one of these. It\'s also much
easier to get a job in the civil service if you\'re bilingual. Oddly
enough, the one bilingual province is also the one that raises the most
political shit - but surely the Canadian government isn\'t buying
political peace with government jobs, are they?
</off topic rant>

ObTrav #1: Would the Imperial military forces be dominated by recruits
from planets with lower tech levels and lower per capita incomes? Would
there be more recruits from worlds like Regina or worlds like Tarsus?
Since most of the Imperial population is concentrated on a small number
of high-pop worlds, would the distribution of members of the military
match the distribution of the general population, or would it be skewed
towards having proportionally more people from smaller worlds?

If anyone want to reply to this message, I ask that you send it to me
privately, as I feel bad enough about having cluttered up the list this
much already.

Ethan, totally off topic.

Norris was sufficiently concerned about an attack by the Zhodani that he
apparently stripped his coreward and rimward frontiers. That is a pretty
good motive to start the reactivations immidiately. Once it became clear
that the Zhodani were not going to attack, the Aslans and Vargr were
alrady taking big bites out of his domain[1]. I\'d say that was a pretty
good reason to keep it up until those areas were back under his control. [2]

[1] Never mind that IMO the Aslan _ihatei_ and Vargr opportunists as
    described in CT sources would be incapable of mustering the strength
    to take those areas away from Norris; MT claims they did.

[2] Again, I know that according to MT sources Norris did abandon several
    subsectors to the Vargr and Tobia (his third most important system)
    and surroundings to the Aslans, but that just isn\'t the Norris I
    recognize from CT sources.

Remember that the task is to hit your opponent, not to out-draw them.
(The Traveller task system doesn\'t have what I consider adequate rules
for long range smal arms fire.)  However, I can state with a fair
amount of certainty that if I have a rifle/carbine at port arms,
and you have a holstered sidearm, then for any distance beyond 1 meter,
I\'m the one that will walk away and you\'re the one they\'ll bury. :^)
Rifles (in general) are not slung unless there is almost zero
chance of conflict.

Bruce Johnson <johnson@pharmacy.arizona.edu> writes:

Right, Bruce.  Handguns are, by defensive weapons, designed to be used
at close range (i.e. less than 50m.)  Rifles are offensive, first-strike,
long range weapons.  The two can be used interchangeably, but only up
to a point.

The "point, not aim" statement is only true at contact distances.  If
you get more than 3m away from your opponent, you\'d better be using
your sights.  As an old instructor of mine once said, "Speed is no
substitute for accuracy; you can\'t miss fast enough to win a gunfight."
We tell our handgun students, if they forget everything else they\'ve
learned in our classes, they *MUST* remember the "3 Secrets": Sight
Alignment, Sight Picture, Trigger Control.  If you practice these
elements of shooting, then you can count on one more statement
to also be true: "Distance is your friend."  If you\'re a better shot
than your opponent, and you\'re far enough away, it probably won\'t
matter if he beats you to the draw.  You just have to hit him first.

Another significant factor is damage vs. time.  To instantly shut
down your opponent, you have to overwhelm the biological machine.
This means deliver major trauma to the body before the shock mechanism
engages.  Studies have shown that highest likelihood of success 
requires a double tap to the center of mass in under 2.5 seconds.
Properly trained, a person can recognise a threat, draw a handgun
from concealment, aim, and fire two shots in that time.  I know
because I do it on a regular basis, and I\'m nothing special.

True but probably not a factor.  For ranges inside typical combat distance
(less than 200m), a handgun can be as accurate as a rifle.  Very few
people (myself included) can actaully shoot to the complete accuracy
of a good handgun.

OTOH, the real difference is damage.  At 100m, a 9mm slug is more likely
to wound than kill.  The opposite is true for a 5.56x45mm NATO or a
7.62x51mm NATO slug.

If the Domain could not only fend off the Outworld Coalition in the FFW,
but then carry the fight to them, I would think that the Aslan and Vargr
would be closer to a Gulf War engagement than a WW2 style engagement for
the Domain.  Also, the Domain was just ramping down from a war footing, and
the Cats and Dogs were coming in as oppurtunists.  IMTU, the Cats never got
past the rimward subsectors opposite the Spinward Marches, but the Vargr
raiders played havoc with shipping and raids along the Vargr borders.  This
is even moreso once it is established that the Zhodani are not a threat.  

I agree, this is not the Norris I knew from the FFW.

Okay, just one more note and I\'ll let this go:

The original MP background was written so long ago (1980?) that it placed
the WAR somewhere in the far future: 1995!  On November 18, 1995 (the date
of the nuclear war in MP), we had a MASSIVE End of the World party to
celebrate the destruction of the-world-as-we-know it.

Alternately, figure that all freight figures are in _imperial_ credits, while
starships are bought with _local_ credits -- which means that in effect, ships
below TL 15 are cheaper.

  I concur, so that\'s not a real cause for reactivating ships at highest
speed (after paying to do so, maintenance once online will be 10% again,
yes?). As for the Zhodani, my (perhaps somewhat abnormal) approach would
be to accept that they have enough strength (given a year or two to get
organized) to conquer the unsupported Domain regardless of what I do (due
to disparity of capabilities); beyond redeployments to deter them in the
short-term the best service one can do for your own cause is to not make
choices with serious negative long-term economic effects (assuming that
the real short-term deterrent to the mind-raping bastards is that the
Imperium will obviously will be stabilized back at full strength in a
few years...).

  Given that the overbuilt establishments in the Marches/Corridor already
have a maintenance/support cost probably approaching the allocated IN budget
(3 to 5% of production?), then reactivating all those ships (say, a further
2.5% of GDP times six to eight, or more) will eliminate the possibility of
further investment in the Domain for the foreseeable future. It is not the
TU we\'ve seen to assume that a garrison state will arise, and if it did it
would still face stagnation if not regression as real depreciation occurs.

  I\'m assuming that the shipyard capacity and _personnel_ are available, 
the latter of which certainly isn\'t a trivial consideration.

  FWIW, even ignoring the costs of absorbing refugees and patrolling 
insecure frontiers it seems quite bizarre that the advancement to TL 
16/17 is being made in the RSB.

ROFL!!!!!!!!!!

I had a copy of TMP, & actually got to *PLAY* it once.  Prob was, the ref was
seriously into Munchkinism.  Our party \'leader\' took on an armoured column of
M1 tanks with a HAAM suit in hand to hand combat and *WON*.  *sigh*

Main prob I saw with TMP was the emphasis on combat & hardware.  It was
hardware-heavy.

OTOT, TMP makes a decent sourcebook for a \'back from the Stone Age\' type TNE
campaign, & I\'d certainly use it as such.

  I haven\'t found current figures (let\'s not kid ourselves, there\'s
not much call for military history in Canada...), but the figures for
the World Wars probably support your thesis somewhat. However, that
probably fails to take into account the higher proportion of recent
immigrants from the UK (a significant factor in participation rates
in the period); comparing those two jurisdictions with Ontario would
probably be more useful (Newfoundland wasn\'t part of Canada at the
time of either war, IIRC).

  Nowadays your figures are going to be skewed several ways - job
opportunities (sorry, the army wanted to commission one guy I played
micro-armour with, but with a Civ.Eng degree he had real money to make)
as you mentioned being the obvious one. Culture and access are another:
Halifax probably has a higher participation rate than any population
center west of Ontario (I\'d guess the highest in the country). Small
centers don\'t have recruiters, are remote from same, and don\'t have
militia units (AFAIK, most of the West is badly underestablished for
Reserve intake).

...

  I\'m not sure about the standards for the Reserves, but IIRC the full-
time Forces require high school graduation, and then they reject the
majority of applicants; it\'s the skilled slots that are a bitch to keep
filled (that probably sounds familiar to a lot of people on the list...).
The guys I know tend to join up for the money to finish university, or
for the job prospects (learn commo/computer skills, for ex.). I\'ve only
met a few combat arms people, and while they probably weren\'t economic
cases (one described his goal as to learn how to blow things up, IIRC)
that may have been because they had the economic freedom to choose to
enlist for the fun/adventure.

  That latter of course brings us back to the entire philosophy of having
nobles to perform certain functions, as their economic security relieves
them of pressures that might prevent them from functioning optimally. I
wonder if there are any good 18th century tracts that could be ported
to Traveller as justification of the feudal hierarchy - at least the
material would be public domain...

  Canonically, yes, though one has to start wondering about this. After
all, the Imperial Marines are a small establishment of TL 15 (c.1100)
troops, so why would they bother recruiting below high stellar TL\'s?
How much time would be needed to upgrade a TL 7 recruit to this standard
(and could he/she/it even get technical skills at that TL)? (the Navy,
however, is a separate issue)

  Another issue becomes which environment (Tarsus or a high-pop world)
has more economic opportunities - if the former then your frontier
worlds will provide a few recruits only, in it for adventure or to see
the galaxy (aka Munich, Hawaii, Cyprus...) at His Majesty\'s pleasure.
Contrary to what GW might "think" (a charitable term, that), there\'s
no evidence that street scum are the best recruits, at least in the
opinions of pre-20th century generals that I\'ve read.

  OC, the real answer probably has something to do with the fact that
a technologically determinist char-gen system would be contrary to the
Trav background and campaign style (IMO, anyway).

There\'s the 10,000 ton escort destroyer ("ED-15" from MT Fighting Ships, or
_Rapier_ from TNE Battle Rider).  It looks like it might be intended as a 
very light cruiser, probably with the same mission as the even lighter 
_P.F. Sloan_ fleet escorts; clear the enemy escort screen out of the way
of your BatRons, and keep them from doing the same to you.

welcome to Earth.  The standard for basic US Army Infantry is the ability
to engage a target at 50 meters, and hit it, with a M-16A2 rifle is three
seconds.  That\'s from either the prone unsupported of bench rest.

  Was it also the lack of physical fitness of conscripts in the 1st 
World war (or was it earlier) that gave us the heritage of  Physical 
Education, and free milk in schools (well in the UK)

Welcome to the Dorsai. ;-) The men are all away, you\'re facing the
women, children and old men.

do you 	a) Surrender?
	b) Shoot yourself in the head and get it over with?
	c) Give them your planet in return for your impudence?
	d) All of the above.

Historical Notes

The Vanguard class battleships were designed as follow-ons to the
famous Iron Duke class ships-of-the-line. They were designed to
specifically address the problems of the previous class, notably the
poor armour protection and low maneuvering capability.
In common with the Iron Duke class, the class displayed typical Terran
design features; a large spinal mount, high levels of automation to
lower crew requirements,  multiple redundant electronic systems and
heavy point defences.
The Vanguard class\' design specification required it to able able to
accelerate at up to 6g, together with an armour rating 2 to 3 times
better than that of an Iron Duke.
The Vanguard\'s designers were able to able to meet these specifications
by employing a novel method of armouring the ships. Instead of a thickly
armoured hill completely encasing the ship, the designers used a much
lower armour-rated hull, and instead highly armoured the ship\'s vital
internal areas. By sacrificing the weight of the armour over
non-critical systems such as the cargo bay and the hangar, much more
armour could be assigned to critical areas such as the bridge (where the
surrounding armour is >2.5m thick!), life support and the controls.
This design concept became known as the \'Citadel\' system.
In addition, the Vanguards were designed with two complete computer
systems, one at each end of the ship, in case damage caused one to
become inoperative. There is an instance in the the archives of a ship
(the Joan d\'Arc) taking massive damage amidships which knocked out fore-
aft communications and data lines, but continuing to fight on as 
the fore and aft computers controlled their respective parts of the
ship.
Despite this innovative design system the Vanguards were only produced
in limited numbers ( a total of 12 being built around the start of the
3rd Interstellar War). This was a result of the rapid growth in capital
ship displacement at this time. However, the high speed of the class
enabled a limited use in the cruiser role towards the end of the 3rd
war. 
Compared to a vessel of the Iron Duke class, the Vanguard\'s
disadvantages were it\'s higher cost and much larger crew requirement.
The Vanguard\'s advantages are it\'s higher speed and greatly increased
armour.

Designed using Andy Akin\'s excellent FFS2 spreadsheet.

The inspiration for this design came (obviously) from Andrew
Moffatt-Vallance\'s Iron Duke design.

I\'ve worked on a few other designs using the same Citadel concept. I\'m
trying to get a web page organised to put the designs up on. If you\'d
like the \'light\' versions of the spreadsheet files sent to you to look
at, then let me know.

Btw, if you try to recreate the design in version 2.5 of Andy\'s
spreadsheet, there is an error in that Life Support Armour volume, mass,
power, and cost are included in the totals shown (I\'ve mailed him about
this).

Regards,

Rob.

Nah. T2K was more of a spin around the tube blowing the hell out of the
aliens coming up it game, using the superzapper when in a panic.

Gurps that\'s the hold up.  SJ games is trying to do this one right, so the
errata level should be down from the previous incarnations of Traveller.

The good news is that the manuscript for the Spinward Marches supplement is
up for playtest and looks pretty good.  More detail on the systems - a
little bit less per planet than J. Andrew Keith did in his Pilot\'s Guide to
the Drexilthar Subsector or GDW did in Path of Tears, but each system does
have at least a blurb about it.  Significant additional background
material - more sector and local corporations , additional minor races, a
year by year history of the of the sector from 1098-1120 including all of
the TNS stories, and some interesting long term plots.  One campaign and
several shorter adventures and encounters are included.  About 90% of this
should be usable regardless of milieu or system, except for M:0 of course.

It does look promising....

I did this.  ++Good experience!  Leisure Games emailed me the day they
received my order and sent all five items out to me same day.  I just
received the things today, July 9.  I ordered on July 1; they emailed me
confirmation on July 4...  I rarely get this sort of service in-country!

Most/many of you have already seen the 101 series - this was my first
exposure, though, and I was quite impressed!  They\'re
professionally-produced digest-sized booklets running between 40 and 44
pages long.  101 Plots says it all - "A useful handbook for when the
referee runs out of ideas"...  They remind me of the old Paranoia Press
pubs, except that the BITS products are 1998 TL and are more tightly edited
(that was a compliment to the latter, not an insult to the former).

General comments:  Little wasted interior space; good quality paper; glossy
color covers; indexed and/or contented (not like cows).  Descriptive
materials beyond what I mention below.

101 Rendezvous contains 101 locations for meetings - flavor, descriptions,
etc.  Not pages-long descriptions, but enough for a good referee to run
with on short notice.

101 Plots is inaccurately titled, as it contains 108... - short narrative
descriptions of situations the referee can throw at the players.  I don\'t
know that I\'d be able to run an evening\'s adventure on the fly from reading
on on-site, but seeing these the evening before would certainly point me in
the right direction.  The plots range from detailed patron encounters down
to short paragraph hooks.

101 Lifeforms contains 102 of \'em.  They\'re generally (I\'ve read about 20
or so, so far) well thought out, with enough detail in the descriptions to
run on the fly (OK - you may need to make stuff up...)  

101 Travellers is right on - 101 of them!  Much like 76 Patrons;
descriptions are good and they\'re grouped by the sort of passage they
booked.  Some of the encounters, though, are painfully normal (I think now
of Thom Yood, the voc-tech carpentry instructor and his kids)... Still,
these sorts of encounters can mess with players\' heads (He\'s got WHAT? - an
odd-looking knife - in his bag?  I\'m drawing my laser...).

101 Cargos has 104....  This, though, is only a part of the booklet.  A
section on adventure links - cargo-related hooks - I liked a lot.  There\'re
also sections on cargo codes and the inevitable cargo generation tables.
Quite worthwhile - and a source of the sort of excruciating detail I need
to do battle with my ship-owner player...

As is obvious, I liked the 5 suppliments.  They provide shortcuts for
people like me who don\'t have unlimited time.  I especially liked the fact
that, including postage, they cost me about $8.50 or so apiece.  It kinda
makes one remember the days when EVERYthing Traveller-related came in a
little black (or other colored) book for about $5.  Oh well - inflation...

The question is : what does "ease of aiming" mean?
- -the ease to bring the weapon to aim/point/bear
- -the ease to aim the weapon at a target

If the target is inside the pistol\'s aiming short range ( example 6m),
wouldn\'t be it easier to
hit it than using inside the same range a rifle??? What if i have two
target in front of me at
the same range as above!! Which would be better to have the pistol or
rifle?
And would it be reasonable to give DM ( not range or aiming DM \'cause of
sight radius)???

_WE_ couldn\'t stomach the fact that every buyer of a game incorporating
realistic combat rules would have demanded their money back and complained for
the next decade that the game was hopelessly broken. 

S.L.A. Marshall\'s _Men Against Fire_ is the most controversial source for the

While it\'s been out of print since the mid to late 80\'s, I know for a fact
that as of a couple of years ago, it was still possible for some games
shops to get everything from their distributers.  I picked up the entire
run in \'96 from "Campaign Headquarters" in Norfolk, Virginia (I miss that
store now that I\'m back on the west coast).  When I left Virgina a year and
a half ago they were still keeping a complete set, plus, in stock.

Elite units???There are more than enough for everyone :-)

Army :
    Rangers ( if you count them as a unit, and not as recon/pathfinder

    Elements of Light Infantry Divisions ( I consider them being above

    SpecOps Squadrons ( Nightstalkers ???) ( not realy a elite ground
unit, mainly AirOps )
    Air Security Personel ( Base defense ) or whatever they are called (
I heard they are
                                                         as good
marksmen as the Marines )
 Marines : ( to be already considered above Army Standard,

yards with the M16
                         Army recruits need only 100 yards

                     that\'s a key factor because firing in burst mode,

    ForceRecon
    Marine Snippers
    Marine Epeditionary Units ( SpecOps Capable)
 Navy :
    SEALS
SpecOps Cmd ???
    Delta Force
    Special Forces Groups ( mostly specialist from more than one branch)

    Special purpose mission tailored units could be formed within the
branches or as joint units!

In the end the ammo economy or number of shot fired in each unit ,
depense on the
training priorities. For mecahnized units or units with a short mission
timaspan
ammo economy is not as important as for light infantry units carrying
all their ammo with them
and having to use them over a longer time.

Morrow Project was a great _idea_ for a game. The rules were -- um -- less

Judging from the mail we received, (and the comments from the local gaming

I think I would characterize Twilight more as a game set _during_ the
apocalypse, but maybe that\'s getting a little picky.

  There were always physical fitness concerns with recruits (apparently
about 25-30% of US WW I conscripts were rejected on these grounds, but
some were trying to get out), although I believe the UK problem persisted
to the 40\'s; ISTR an account (Shirer?) of a war correspondent in France
commenting on how British prisoners who grew up during the depression
appeared clearly small and scrawny compared to the German conscripts of
the same age group, who\'d had the advantage of better diet from the more
comprehensive National Socialist welfare programs. Of course, the health
benefits were short-lived...

  I was initially referring more to the opinions I\'ve read about their
motivation levels (including a Prussian example). But the decline in 
recruit quality in the UK probably went back to Marlboroughs\' time, and
would\'ve gotten worse as underemployment (and presumed poverty and under
nourishment) spread in rural areas with the population boom that supplied
the factories\' labour force. Freeholder and gentry participation rates
probably plummeted after the Civil War, although I\'d want to check that.

  IAC it doesn\'t quite apply to Traveller, as any TL 5-6+ culture can
subject its\' citizens to all sorts of useful indoctrination without too
much effort. Whether the 3I (as opposed to its\' constituent planetary
members) would bother to do so is dubious, as it\'s not a democracy.
Boot camp, OTOH, could include truly amazing standards of ideological
indoctrination disguised as various programs for ameliorating cultural
differences, promoting harmony, and training on Imperial standard tech
and procedures.

  As it happens Space: 1889 has lots of good resource material, including
combat rules and design sequences for armourclads, sky galleons, and plain
old colonial skirmishes. The only hassle I had was with the (IMO) ahistorical
militarist and expansionist bent attributed to Bismarckian diplomacy, but
this was presumably installed to provide a regular and understandable foe
for the PC\'s to operate against.

LIDs are WWI Infantry Divisions with M-16s.  Nothing special about them.

The 82nd and 101st don\'t really have "elite" capabilities, beyond their
tempo of training and the requirement to be Airborne for the 82nd.

You missed Special Forces, Special Operations Detachment Delta (aka Delta
Force), and TF-160, the special ops helicopter unit.

Snipers are assigned to regular Marine units, so don\'t really count as
spcial units, but highly trained assets.

MEUs are regular Marine units that go through a pre-deployment excercise.
Calling them SpecOps capable is a bit of a misnaming.

I think you are referring to JSOC.

These are both Army.

I was assuming T4 Milieu 0 with TL12 local and TL12 Imperial Credits.  I

Anyone know the Space 1999 date when the Moon is due to depart taking

IMHO
You have to assume that regular freight and passenger liners break the rules.
For a start, their routes and timetables should be known well in advance
so that the local representatives will probably have all the spaces on
each flight booked before the ship leaves the previous planet.

Also being a regular trader with history means that people will trust them
to actually deliver the cargo and not skip with it (or kidnap the passengers).

The rules as given are for merchant players arriving unexpectedly, trying
to put together a cargo and passenger list in one week with no long term
contacts on the planet.

I believe that the intention was to ensure that PCs could not just fly
round the galaxy piling up cash without taking risks and that the ships
and trade rules were designed to ensure this.

>>However, the question is:  Has anybody designed a ship by starting with a
>>trade route and then basing the cargo hold and staterooms based on the
>>expected cargo/passengers? These would obviously be specialized vehicles.

The trade rules would not be a good starting point because they
would almost certainly suggest too small a ship. Especially because
this ship is on a regular route with prearranged cargoes and passengers
and would be trusted to arrive at each destination.

However, this was the intention of THUDDD 8.

The answer is that something like a cheaper subsidised merchant wins
everytime because it has the same passenger/cargo mix as a free trader,
is cheaper per cargo ton, but is not so big that the passenger/cargo
rules leave it empty.

A properly designed ship makes cash at 50% loading. If designed with a
route in mind (ie if your 10,000 ton ship is half full, then a 5,000 ton
ship is full) can return the initial investment in about 5 years
(since 5 year morgages cost less than 40 year ones).

I agree that depreciation is ignored (at least by PCs who don\'t expect
the campaign to last for 40 years), as is loss insurance (since the PCs
tend to be part of the loss)
but there is enough profit margin for the corps here already.

>In other words you have to break some of the vanilla rules to make other
>vanilla rules make financial sense (at least to me and I hope to any
>merchants or accountants on the list).

No, the small ships are designed for merchant adventurers who move
cargos from one planet to another for large profit margins per ton.

They travel with these cargos to ensure they arrive safely and own
their own ships so that they can travel when they want and directly
to the world that is going to make the most money, especially since
time is often a factor.

Typically their cargos are high value and low volume, so they use
small ships for flexibility. Sometimes their cargoes are people.

If they can\'t find a suitable cargo, they speculate on local produce
markets. The profits are lower, but at least they pay the bills
so that the merchant can try on another planet.

If there is left over space on the ship they might book passengers
or freight. They rapidly learn not to because the passengers die
or stabotage the ship or steal the cargo or hijack the ship or are
disguised pirates. The freight is no better, because it is usually
a fake box containing a bomb, a homicidal robot, hijackers, pirates,
slavers, murderers, terrorists, or just something illeagal on the
destination world.

IMO, trying to scale up Imperial trade from the PC trade rules is
about as accurate as assuming that 1 in 6 of all Imperial citizens
is a Scout because of the draft die roll :-)

Need to add the Marine Corps\' Air & Naval Gunfire Liaison Company 
(ANGLICO)...  Similar to Force Recon, but prob more highly trained.  The 
mission is different...

But Doug, he didn\'t say the Snipers, he said the "Snippers".  Now these 
guys really are special...  They get ahold of every one of the Marine 
Recruits and begin the indoctrination process (after the DI is your face 
of course)...  They remove every strand of hair, and there you have 
it...a jar head (I can say that, as I am one).  Seriously, well, as 
seriously as a typo can be, I have a friend (carpooled together) who is 
a retired Gunny.  Was a sniper.  He was the subject of a write-up in the 
base paper.  His picture was on the cover.  He was proud of it...  Then 
he noticed that the caption talked about Gunnery Sergeant Ismael Cruz, 
Marine Snipper, and the article talked about him doing stuff at Snipper 
School.  Man did we ever ride him about that!

It a bit of a misnomer, but they have other capabilities than the 
standard MEU, and therefore are SOC.  They have some other equipment and 
receive some additional training.

>I think you are referring to JSOC.

I remember when these guys came on board our ship when we were floating 
of the coast of Beruit in 85 following the hijacking of the TWA 
airliner...  Plans were being made for a permissive NEO (the red forces 
covered the map so nonpermissive was right out.  Seems everyone had 
their own ZSU!)

Yes, but if things return to less-than-full crisis conditions in a year or
two (and to assume that we have to rewrite canon; I for one can\'t
reconcile the abandonment of several subesectors of the Domain with an
attitude of business as usual. Norris might abandon some of his people
if he was forced by lack of resources to concentrate on protecting the
rest, but I can\'t see him doing it if he wasn\'t stretched to the limit),
why reactivate anything at all six years later?

I agree that as the months go by and the Zhodani remain quiscent, Norris
might begin to reconsider the full-scale mobilisation. But not to the
point of ignoring the Aslans and the Vargr.

Oh, and another thought just struck me: Norris\' loyalties. Norris is a loyal
man. The canonical explanation why he didn\'t send fleets to the Imperial
core is that they were needed at home; in other words, his loyalty to his
subjects overrode his loyalty to Strephon. But if his fleets are not all
needed at home, then what? Somehow I can\'t see Norris go back to a
peacetime level of expenditures while the Imperium is kilkennying itself.

>Given that the overbuilt establishments in the Marches/Corridor already
>have a maintenance/support cost probably approaching the allocated IN budget
>(3 to 5% of production?),

If my analysis is reasonably correct, the active fleet in the Domain is only
consuming about 1.5% of production. That was the reason I proposed that there
was a huge lot of mothballed ships absorbing about half the total defense
budget. (Having the Domain assume the cost of supporting some of the Corridor
fleets won\'t help a whole lot, since 3 or 4 regular fleets is only about 1%
of the total Domain budget).

>then reactivating all those ships (say, a further 2.5% of GDP times six to
>eight, or more)

The figure of a mothballed fleet 8 times bigger than the active fleet was
base on the fact that that would allow the total reactivated fleet to be
supported by 15% of total production, the maximum allowed by _Striker_.
I would assume that this figure cannot be kept up indefinitely. I also
assume (since there are no rules on the subject) that a society can (just)
keep up an expenditure of 12%. This is again based on ther assumption that
the base figure from _TCS_ represents 10%; two of the governments would
then have peacetime expenditures equal to 12%.   

>  I\'m assuming that the shipyard capacity and _personnel_ are available, 
>the latter of which certainly isn\'t a trivial consideration.

Certainly not, but it is most critical in the short run. With six years
of prepartation time the domain should be able to man everything they
reactivate. Yet we are told that the reactivations are scheduled for
another two years...
 
One possibility that just struck me is that if Imperial naval spending is
only 1/3rd of that of the _TCS_ pocket empires, then their naval shipyard
capacity may also be only 1/3rd of the _TCS_ figures. THat would make the
Trin shipyard capacity 4 million tons instead of 12 million, which will
help quite a lot.

Except... It seems to me that the Imperials would be able to expand their
shipyard capacity once the war started...

Personally, I would use the excellent fighters from Svennson Small Craft -
about 4 gees, armed with a laser in the 250 MJ range and capable of
mounting a couple of missiles.

Designs available on request.

One of these days I have to pull my finger out and build the 600t, jump-3
disk-shaped Escort Carrier for them.

Sort of. TL11 is just dandy for building jump-2 freighters, and there are a
couple of \'magic\' technologies at TL12 (nuke dampers and meson screens)
that TL11 and below just cant build.

If you assume the ICr is a starport A, TL12 currency, then the exchange
rate from the ICr to 11 will be more extreme than from, say, TL15 to TL14.

They had four Gazelles. If I didn\'t get my sums wrong, their cost works out
to 3% of the cost of their merchant fleet. The article didn\'t explain how
four ships actually went about protecting 52 merchants ships jumping back

"The Buffer Zone" as it is called IMTU. For centuries the Imperium had had
a policy of discouraging Aslan _ihatei_ from encroaching upon the Buffer
Zone. With the Rebellion the _ihatei_ got the chance to move into it, but
they never had a chance of crossing into Imperial space (except as oath-

I\'d hazard a guess that they only escorted merchant ships that were:
A) Carrying unusually valuable cargoes compared to the rest of the
Al Morai fleet. This would include high-publicity cargoes, the loss of
which would harm Al Morai\'s reputation.
B) Performing exploratory trade in unknown areas.
C) Trading at Amber Zones where the presence of an armed vessel
would make a difference.
D) Trading in star systems that had suffered recent losses of ships
to Corsairs, Commerce Raiders or "Unexplained Disappearances".

In case D, I could see Al Morai restricting or suspending trade
operations for the area in question - unless the prospect of profits
from trading in the middle of a shooting war pushes their greed over
their caution.

Oh lord, another Atomic Knights fan! 

I\'ve got some of those in my comic collection somewhere. 

Another good "after disaster" comic is Gold Key\'s "Mighty Samson". 

And their "Space Family Robinson"/"Lost in Space" comics would make a
decent encounter. Hmmm. I may have to try designing the shuttles and

I actually helped a friend set up some more reasonable supply caches.
And he wanted some sort of "leftover" weapons system to give the
players trouble. So I told him about the Thor kinetic kill weapon
project. And showed him the pictures of warheads re-entering from an
issue of Scientific American (I swear, they look like the biggest,
nastiest *energy weapons* you\'ve ever seen :-)

I never did hear how the players reacted.

Would you happen to have a *date* for the launch of the Jupiter II? I\'m

The standard TL 14 grav tank of the Imperium (as of MT, at least),
companion to the TL 14 Astrin APC. Both detailed in _Rebellion Sourcebook_

Vehicles_. A quick look at a T4 book (the title of which I do not recall)
had an illo of a grav tank looking suspiciously like a Trepida running down
some troops.

I think it was detailed, in several configurations, in a TNE sourcebook as
well. The tank illustrated in the main TNE book is *not* a Trepida, at
least according to _101 Vehicles_, in which this was a TL 12 grav tank
popular with mercs (the name of which I cannot remember).

Which is, incidentally, why coffee is roasted before being drunk. The

The confusion here is partly generated because CT\'s _Supplement 9: Fighting 
Ships_ and MT\'s _Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium_ disagree on what
an "Escort" is.  In CT, an escort is a ship of up to 5000 tons, covering 
everything from a 300/400 ton _Gazelle_ close escort to something like the
5000 ton _PF Sloan_ fleet escort, and including all the destroyer-escorts
and destroyers and everything else in between.

In MT, on the other hand, escorts *start* with a ship essentially identical
to the _PF Sloan_ (the "EM-15" missile escort) and work their way up to a
20,000 ton monster that\'s the size of a small cruiser, basically filling in
the 5-20 kton gap.  I didn\'t think to see if any of the "escorts" had a
spinal mount; the 10,000 ton "ED-15" _Rapier_ doesn\'t.

I think that the intention was that the MT escorts (from 5000 to 20,000 
tons) should be counted in the "1000 ships per sector fleet" figure, but
not the smaller ones.  Then we count:

  * Battleships (includes dreadnoughts, battleriders, battletenders)
  * Cruisers (anything else with a spinal mount, plus fighter carriers)
  * Fleet Escorts (any non-spinal mount fighting ship 5000 tons or over)

and ignore auxiliaries, including scouts, light escorts, assault transports,
tankers, most non-starships, fleet couriers, and so on.  

The new pea-shooter grade spinal mounts that started showing up on small
ships in TNE mess up this picture a little.  By "spinal mount", I mean
something more like the large weapons from CT/MT.

In our MP game our supply caches contained (GASP!) rebuilding supplies.
The lists were very funny to read:

20 cases nails (5,000/case)
50 cases diapers (250/case - assorted sizes)
10 cases ball point pens (500/case)
5 bullhorns
40 bundles of wool blankets (10/bundle)
10 cases American Flags (20/case)
20 cases Morrow Project Flags (20/case)

etc...  This would go on for *pages*.

And of course, some explosives  ;)

I think it is possible that Norris might have seen the writing on the
wall...is it possible that he decided realitively early that whoever won the
Rebellion, it was not going to be a return to a pre-war Imperium?  Maybe he
figured that Lucan stood a fair chance of winning over Dulinor, and was going
to come after the Domain next.   Maybe he figured that he was going to have to
be the white knight after the others beat themselves to death.  And is it
possible, Norris having been ex-Naval Int, that he some knowledge of the
Imperiums secret weapons programs?  I\'m not saying that he specifically knew
about Virus, for example, but other programs???  (Actually, upon further
reading of Survival Margin, it does seem to me that Norris acted incredibly
fast and decisivly in sealing the border off...)

Has anyone else ever looked at this possibility?  We know that at least one
scientist fled (to Dulinor).  Maybe more than one (in a different direction?)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I know there are people on the list quite conversant with ideas for
advanced weaponry in the Traveller universe. Most of these weapons
will never be in the hands of player characters, and if they are ever
used directly on the PC\'s you\'ll be rolling up new PC\'s.

This doesn\'t mean the PC\'s won\'t see these weapons used. They can
add quite a bit of color to an adventure that happens in or near a war
zone, or can be the superweapon of a terrorist attack. But to make them
work as a GM, we need to know what they\'ll look like on the big screen.

Orbital-dropped Kinetic Kill weapons (Thor\'s Hammer and such):
Do these tire-irons (or telephone poles) fall too fast to be seen with the
naked eye? Will they look like energy bolts (due to re-entry heat)?
What kind of explosion do you get when one hits a tank? How about
when a scattering of them hit a field or plain old dirt?
How close can the GM drop these without killing the PC\'s?

Fusion Guns: White-hot, yellow, red? Straight-line bolts, or streams
of blobs (for the rapid-pulse model)? How bright are they at night when
fired - does a single grav tank firing a fusion gun light up the night?
What kind of sound do fusion guns make - sharp cracking sounds?
Thunder-like rumbles? 

Particle Beams: I\'ve heard these described as straight-line lightning
bolts - blue-white? How bright? What kind of explosion when they
smack a building? How close can the GM shoot these things to the
PC\'s before we start getting suspension of disbelief problems?
What kind of sound - a hiss? A crack?

Anti-Laser Aerosols: Do these look like regular smokescreens, perhaps
with a funny iridescence to them? What happens if a fog of this passes
over you? Coughing, irritated eyes just like smoke, or something worse?
What color are they? What happens when a laser hits the cloud, is it
backlit like a cloud in a thunderstorm? Can you get cooked by laser
scatter from the big beamer that\'s trying to zap your APC through a
cloud, if you\'re nearby when it happens?

Good descriptions are so essential to role-playing games - giving the
players a good feel for what the weapon\'s effects look like is probably
as (or even more) important than getting the stats down to the last
cubic centimeter.

That\'s also why I love deckplans & sketches - the stats are needed to
make the ships consistent with each other, but they\'re not really a
_starship_ until we\'ve got deckplans to run around on!!  <g>

dampers to accelerate the fusion process, I can see how it might be protected,

shield nuclear weapons from dampers?

still occur at normal decay energies (in which case using an accelerator on
radioactive materials could be highly dangerous)?  If not, it has somewhat
unfortunate consequences in terms of conservation of energy.

   The Trepida is the standard Imperial grav tank starting in 1109.  Stats 
are available for MT and FF&S1 (including post-Collapse modifications) that 
I\'ve seen.  TL14, 10 displacement tons, mounting a big fusion gun, and the 
equivalent of 2.6 m of steel armour on the front (half that on the other 
faces).  Capable of fast-subsonic speeds in an atmosphere.  Did you want any 
particular set of stats?

It\'s pretty rich in comparison to any non "Western" country and we
used to rank pretty high on the "Standard of Living" chart, but
now we\'re dropping of the end of it.

It\'s largely a result of protectionism, we don\'t have any the rest
of the world does.

Just a piece of (uncommon) support for the Diggers from a Kiwi.

The story of the guys who paddled all the way to Singapore and

Not entirely true. There _is_ a  warrior tradition amongst
the New Zealand Maori, sopmething they captialized on to great
effect at places like Monte Casino and Bir Hacheim

True, but one does have to take into account the fact that
New Zealand has the highest number of firearms per capita in the
world, even with restrictive legislation on ownership.

In New Zealand there _was_ in the 1950\'s and even up to the early 1980\'s.
_I_ joined the RNZAF in 1980 to learn a trade and get out of a
depressed rural area.

There are still officer cadet scholarships, which, with free
tertiary education no longer being availale in New Zealand
are more sort after than they used to be.

No bonuses to thit should be present for pistols (they actually are no
harder nor easier to *AIM*, but they tend to be faster to aim. In my
experience, persons trained to "Point Shoot" with pistols can bring to bear
faster than those with rifles, but accuracy is all still a matter of skill
and appropriateness of range FOR THE WEAPON USED (ie, not too close, and
not beyond the effective range of the weapon).

Rather than a bonus to hit, at ranges less than double the length of the
weapon, I\'d impose a +1 diff mod to to ability of an aware and resisting
target to push the weapon and dodge to prevent the firer from actually
getting the weapon to bear.

While Traveller generally doesn\'t account for speed in bringing a weapon to
bear, under the TNE Initiative system, I\'d allow the shorter weapon to fire
before the longer one IF BOTH WILL FIRE in the same initiative point.

Pure Grid designs:
According to MT Starhip Operator\'s Manual (DGP), a damaged jump grid maight
prevent jumping. Since the jump grid holds jumpspace 1m away from the hull,
breaches in the grid less than 2m will not radically affect jump, other
than 1.5 to 2m holes damaging the exterior surface. larger holes allow
jumpspace to intrude. It is implied that Jumpspace will form hemispherical
or hemis-oval-spheroid intrusions with a diameter of the narrowest breach
in the grid. Also, it states that major ammounts of damage to the grid can
cause an automatic "Destroyed Mishap", as jump-space cuts the ship into
pieces. Note also that, while not explicitly stated, it is stated in a
roundabout manner that normal matter cannot survive direct exposure to
jumpspace; jumpspace is the ultimate nuclear bond breaker.... Hmmm gives me
an idea how disintigraters work at high TL\'s....

Pure Coil designs:
since it can be assumed that the coil is either one coil assembly for the
whole ship, or a series of coils; and we can assume coils will generate
ovaloid bubbles, a ship cannot jump safely if any coils are non-working. I
find only one canonical reference to jump coils: TNE\'s Regency Sourcebook.
It gives no information on damage to coils.

Mixed Designs:
From Eris description of how HIS TU works,  THe coils seem to generate the
jump, and the grid and injection mass hold the bubble open... so damage
would be a combination of the above.

IMTU, I use both pure grid designs and pure coil designs (with Irridium and
Lanthanum as material options... Irridium became the backing for currency
due to its strategic use for jump grids and coils, before lanthanum was
discovered to be better), but I do not use Mixed coil&grid designs. Coil
designs are good for military ships, since they can take many surface hits
without loss of jump capability, and many civillians use the grids, due to
easier access for maintenance, but with the problem that even surface hits
can cause loss of jump capability. Also, still IMTU,  Coil designs can be
easily retrofit, while grid designs cannot. Another restriction on coils
IMTU is that they are more difficult to control; higher chance of error,
but lesser chance of severe misjumps (Since my primary system is MT, all
tasks for jump coils are one level higher, but one die less on mishap
chances when a mishap occurs), so coil ships will seldom be destroyed by a
misjump. This also explains the prevalence of Grid ship IMTU: most civilian
ships use grids tue to safety and ease of use; Most naval jump navigators
IMTU are E7-E9 ratings, with YEARS behind the boards.

Dunno, but I\'ll name the ones I know. Depends on definition of Elite.
Listing of Elite/Special, as I understand the term (units with high morale,
training, and washout rates in training):

By international standards, the whole bloody USMC USED TO BE considered an
elite unit...

US Navy: Seal Teams, UDT Teams (phased out, AFAIK), Air/Sea Rescue (Altho
not combat elites), SeaBee\'s (Construction Battailons, specifically those
trained for war zone base construction; the ones I knew spend more time
shooting than practicing construction)

USMC: Force Recon, Seal Teams, Snipers

US Army: Airborne, Rangers (many of whom are also airborne), Green Berets
(Cadre specialty), Air Assault (just barely, IMHO), CID Special
Investigations (I knew a CW3 in this specialty... doing undercover ops both
on and off various bases... he\'d recently stopped doing undercover work
when I met him), EOD, Arctic Warfare, Moutain Warfare, SNipers

US Air Force: Delta Force (technically multi-service), Para-Rescue, Combat
Controllers, EOD.

Police (in general): SWAT, IAD, CRIT (Crisis Response Intervention Teams;
similar to SWAT, but trained for less confrontational situations as well),
EOD.

Also, the entire Submarine Service of the USN is borderline on Elite.
All Drill Instructors could be considered Elite... But I don\'t consider
them so.

All the above have fairly high morale by comparison, special distinctions
(except CID SI), extra training, and most have very high wash-out rates in
training.

IMTU, there are a variety of "Elite Forces" some of which are not combat
forces:
Navy: SeaBees, Special Boarding Squads, Deep Space Combatant Rescue.
Marines: Beachhead teams, Special Boarding Squads, "Bounce Infantry" (who
are Grav-belt trained drop troops trained in high speed maneuver warfare,
and various specialty units.
Army, Flyers, sailors: varies by world.
Police: Much the same as above, plus Orbital Teams (based upon being able
to get ship skills in the MT Law Enforcer career.)

Lest we lose sight of the origin of this particular sub-thread, it started
when I suggested that _maybe_ the reason why the numbers I had workded out
for the tonnage of the active Imperial fleet didn\'t fit with the presumed
peacetime military budget (3%) was that the Imperial fleet had lots and lots
of mothballed ships which sucked up a lot of the budget. One possible setup
was that they had so many ships that if they went on a war footing, their
wartime budget (15%) would just suffice to support them all. Against that
spoke the fact that this worked out at 8 times the active fleet, which is a
hell of a lot of ships. Nevertheless, there was some _small_ supporting
evidence in the fact that Trin was still reactivating old Imperial ships
after six years on a war footing and planned to do so for at least two more
years. (Mind you, even 8 times the active fleet is not going to tie up the
shipyards for six years unless the yards are much smaller than TCS indicates.
But it\'s a better explanation than combat repairs).
 
So I\'m not claiming that this is the only logical setup. Just that it is
logical and that there is a tiny bit of evidence in favor of it.

This begs the question. If the Domain was under such tremendous pressure
and didn\'t have a humongous mothballed fleet, why wasn\'t these ships
reactivated years earlier and put to use? That is, why are these ships
available for reactivating and turning over to friendly Aslans in the
first place?

So why not reactivate the ship, put it to use, and start building a
suitable ship for when they want to release one to the Aslans? With six
years\' lead time there should be no particular problems sheduling that.

>There may have been a spare parts problem - these were old ships.

Of which a number were still active in the Imperial fleet.

Likely. But does he have more pressing things to do than getting every ship
he can lay his hands on reactivated and sent off to control the Vargr and
the Aslans?

Sorry,   I think we\'ve given you the wrong idea about Al Morai. Their 52
ships are more in the way of passenger liners.

Al Morai don\'t do that.

Maybe. I myself would expect the Navy to stir itself enough to send out
a patrol once a system began suffering from Corsairs, Commerce Raiders,
and unexplained disappearances.

We\'ve batted this around before on the list. I think we decided it was
up to the ref. That is, it ought to be possible, but it may unbalance
things.

I\'d say one follows from the other. And I wouldn\'t want to be around a
fission warhead if you hit oit with a damper set to "accelerate".

I\'d say yes. So it\'s great for cleaning up fallout, but only if you can
get folks out of the area first. :-)

> 5)  How much does a damper accelerate/decelerate decay?  

Well, since it\'s supposed to be able to render the site of a nuke blast
usable, I\'d say several billion to several trillion times. (Hundreds of
years in a turn at least).

Because "Lightning" Class cruisers are real clunkers with no place in a 
modern fleet engagtement, and didn\'t get reactivated until all the 
good ships had been brought out first?> And even then, they got given to
the Aslan...

(Don\'t get me wrong, the Lightning is a beautiful ship, and we all lo9ve it
because it has decklplants, but at 2G it has no chance of surviving an
engagtement with a 6G light cruiser.)

Give what missile warheads re-entering looked like in the *daylight*
photo in Scientific american, you\'ll likely see a blinding white bar of
light. That\'s a combo of the plasma sheath during re-entry, and
persistence of vision. They\'ll be moving around 11 km/sec, so you won\'t
see them move except from a long ways off.

> What kind of explosion do you get when one hits a tank?

Depends on the mass and velocity of the projectile. The rule of thumb
is that at 3 km/sec an object has kinetic energy equal to its mass in
TNT. And it increases as the square of the velocity (twice as fast =
four times the energy).

So figure 25 kilos at 11 km/sec is equivalent to a third of a ton of
TNT. All concentrated on the point of impact. Ouch!

For the silo busters, let\'s figure 500 kilos (half a ton). Which gives
us 6.7 kilotons. (20 times the mass, 20 times the energy)

> How about when a scattering of them hit a field or plain old dirt?

Same kind of blast, as long as they hit something "solid". And at those
speeds *water* is pretty solid. But the blast from a silo killer would
be fatal to a sub that hadn\'t managed to dive *real* deep. 

Do note that these things are intended to be able to steer themselves
toward anything that looks like whatever type of "target" they were set
for at launch. So if they are set for tanks, they\'ll go for tanks. And
you may even get multiples going after the same tank. 

So the odds are that they won\'t be hitting "dirt" very often. Of course
if they are homing on *foxholes*... <evil grin>

> How close can the GM drop these without killing the PC\'s?

How close would you want to be to 1/3 ton of TNT? :-)

Think of these as being *very* heavy artillery, or Naval guns.

> Fusion Guns: White-hot, yellow, red?

Blue white. Anything *close* to fusion temps is white shading into blue
or even violet. 

> Straight-line bolts, or streams of blobs (for the rapid-pulse model)?

Good question. At a guess, I\'d say they are an ellipsoidal (cigar shape
or *stretched* egg shape) long axis in the direction of travel. Moving
fast, and expanding as they go.

They should make a magnesium flare look *dim*.

Problably not that different from thunder. *Close* thunder.

Think of them as directed lightning. They don\'t glow, but the
atmosphere they pass thru *does*.

Much like the explosion from anything else dumping that much energy
into the target. :-)

Personal if it was less that a meter away, I\'d consider myself to be in
*deep* shit. At even 10 meters I wouldn\'t be real happy. Since a P-beam
has side effects much like the grandaddy of all lightning bolts, a near
miss can be pretty traumatic.

Think lightning bolt. *BIG* Lightning bolt.

They\'ll probably be your typical gray-white cloud. Color is a measure
of what wavelengths something reflects. Since you don\'t know what
wavelengths the enemy will throw at you, you have to be ready for all
of them, thus the "grey-white". 

It probably wouldn\'t do your lungs a lot of good to inhale the stuff,
but they won\'t make it toxic if they can avoid it. It\'s just that
inhaling fine particulates is not a good thing. I assume respirators of
some sort will be standard issue (heck, gasmasks ought to be and they
can filter the stuff out).

Given that the cloud has to do more than just *scatter* the beam (the
beam will be doing its best to vaporize the cloud particles in its
path), the area near the path of a beam is *not* a good place. Expect
interesting effects such as the vaporized areosol particles reacting
with the air (burning) or vapor depositing on nearby cool surfaces.

For example, if the areosol is silicate based, the leaves near the
path of an absorbed beam might have a thin coating of glass (soap
bubble thickness) on them. There\'d be odd crackling or tinkling noises
when you brushed against those leaves and the coating shattered as the
leaf flexed.

It had been a long day!

My point was: neither New Zealand nor Australia have maintained
significant military forces outside the World Wars.

Ethan is actually kind of right in one respect - I think military
recruitment in Australia may be higher in rural, rather than urban
areas.

On another topic, my pocket empire campaign(s) have tended to feature
"good guy" empires with very small standing military forces and big
militias - partly on the Australian model, and partly because my
campaigns don\'t tend to feature the "Smash and Grab" type of military
scenario.  It also differentiates my PEs from the "US marines in space"
style of, for example, the Reformation Coalition.

It tends to work like this - on a united, relatively stable world with a
popularly supported government, there isn\'t much need for infantry and
other ground troops.  The main military threat comes from off-world
raiders, who rarely have much in the way of ground troops.  So, you
establish a rapid reaction force and allocate most of the rest of your
resources to your fleet and planetary defence batteries.  This works
well enough in the TNE setting, and coincidentally allows you to
concentrate almost all of your scarce relic equipment in the units that
are most likely to see combat.

Once again, sorry I flamed you, Ethan.

Call the above general ideas for what a 50-ship line would do with
four Gazelle-class gunboats, then...but (as this is TML), I must
refute each of your objections above...as I\'ve never had the pleasure of
reading the Spinward Marches Campaign, I\'ll have to reference
Hyphen\'s web page at http://pcug.org.au/~davidjw/libdata/library.htm
as it claims the Al Morai entry to be data from the SMC.

A> On carrying cargo:
"Established in 120 as a local transport company serving systems
within ten parsecs of its base, the company soon expanded to handle
freight and passengers travelling from the Darrian and Sword Worlds 
subsectors to the Imperium." (SMC from web page above)

Freight and passengers. This indicated they\'ve carried cargo almost since
the company was founded. Do they still do so?

Besides, many passenger vessels carry cargo. The 600-tn Subsidized
Liner had more internal volume dedicated to cargo than it did to
passengers.
And of course, if your "valuable cargo" is a celebrity holo-vid megastar,
you might want to give him an escort. 

B> On exploratory trade:
"During the widespread explorations of the Marches in the third
century (201 to 300), Al Morai established an Exploration Division to 
supplement its cargo carriers." (SMC from web page above)

Sounds like the company had an Exploration Division. Perhaps not in
the same league as BT/BY\'s Leviathans, and it may not still exist - 
but they had one.

C> On Amber Zone trading:
They\'re trading with the Sword Worlds and the Darrian Confederation - 
outside the Imperial border. To some frames of mind (perhaps especially
the Imperial corporate mindset), anything outside the Imperium is the
equivalent of and Amber Zone.

D> On depending on the Navy:
When will the Navy decide to take an interest? Before or after your
vital cargo of zuchai crystals is ready for pickup? 
A dedicated escort might be a good idea anyway. If a pirate knows
that many of the Al Morai ships passing through this system have an
escort, she might be wary of jumping one - she\'ll keep wondering where
the escort is, whether it\'s in a sensor shadow, coming out of jumpspace
any minute, whatever. 

Of course, the average pirate captain will be parsecs away from even
the _rumor_ of a Navy task force arrival.

Al Morai may also have these "Route Protectors" for some less
public reasons. I don\'t suppose anyone has checked them for
variable transponders lately? It seems an unidentified gunboat
has been harassing independent traders on a certain trade route
in Lunion, a trade route Al Morai has been eyeing for some months
now...private police forces can be as handy as Trader or Broker
skill, if you aren\'t too picky about how you use them.  <g>

Ahh, another lover of the venerable AHL. <G>

I think they kept the AHL\'s around for two reasons: 

1) AHL is Jump-5. Jump-5 can be a nice asset to have, if it keeps
the enemy worried for another parsec away from the frontier. 
It appears that the IN uses Jump-4 as a standard, only one warship
besides the AHL in Fighting Ships (CT supp 9) is more than Jump-4.
And even with it\'s agility-5, I think the _Gionetti_ would have problems
with an AHL - AHL has bigger guns, more armor, more defenses, and
a couple of fighter wings over the Gionetti.
Why is Jump-5 so much nicer than Jump-4? Take a look at a sector
map, see how many stars that extra parsec of range adds to your 
hit list. Every star you can visit from your base or frontier is a star
your enemy has to fortify. Every extra star he fortifies dilutes his
defense budget - probably quite a bit more than it cost you to pull
some older ships out of ordinary.

2) Cost Effectiveness - there are a lot of tasks that need doing, but
don\'t need a first-line warship to do. If a ship will last a century or two,
why ditch it when it\'s fulfilling a role on the cheap? It takes a long, long
time for an AHL\'s operating costs to equal the cost of a new build,
even the new build of a smaller but more capable ship.

Not every submarine in the US Navy is Seawolf class. Not every ship
in the Imperial Navy is going to be the cutting edge of TL15.

And Australian troops shouted "The Australians are coming!" at El
Alamein, although I couldn\'t find the precise reference!

Actually, this is an example of the nonsense I included in this
posting.  The fact was, the Australian army in WWII was cadred by
veterans of WWI.
What I (think I) meant was, that there was little organisational
continuity between the two, and subsequently - the Australian (& New
Zealand) forces in the world wars were essenctially ad hoc formations,
and the current regular armies are more or less "post-War" creations -
which may NOT be true in the NZ case - I could be talking complete
hogwash here!

Actually, the "present" Australian defence force was formed from WWII
veterans, and was more or less continuously involved in one conflict or
another from 1945 to 1972, including some campaigns (eg West Papua) that
aren\'t really talked about. There\'s a "warrior tradition" if you want
one.

A couple of Australian VC winners have poured a great deal of highly
plausible scorn on the Australian "gun lobby" along the lines that
civilian Ramboes have no idea what it is like to actually fight in a
war.

I\'ve met a former NZ army colonel who had been a "contract officer" in a
Middle Eastern state after leaving the NZDF.  He was looking to pad out
his retirement funds.  When I met him, he was a civilian, working for a
Third World government, doing exactly the same.  I don\'t doubt he would
have been a good soldier if "the Middle Eastern state" had been involved
in a war while he was serving there, but it still suggests a certain
pragmatism.

As far as I know, there are no official stats for the Vegans.  Maybe the
Digest Group wrote something about them which I don\'t have.  

I\'m assuming here that you have access to either the CT or MT library
data on them.

Vegans seem to be about human-sized.  TNE has stat adjustments for
different planetary conditions.  I would recommend applying the relevant
modifiers for Muan Gwi (stats available in Solomani Rim and one of the
basic MegaTraveller books) to Vegans, perhaps in addition to those for
their actual homeworld.  This would have the effect of making them tall
and skinny beanpoles, which is my reading of their physique.

There is no evidence to suggest that they are any dumber or smarter than
humans.  In the 3I, they would seem to have had similar educational
opportunities to humans, having their own (TL 15) imperial autonomous
district.  Subsequently ("New Era") is subject to your interpretation. 
Social Standing is a worry.  As long term Imperial subjects, I presume
that they would have Social Standing similar to human characters. 
However, this would be modified by their status within their own
society.

The big problem with playing Vegans, is of course, the fact that this is
a non-human society!  Vegans, despite millenia of co-existing with
humans, have their own culture. Without having my books here, I can\'t
spell "tuhuir" correctly.

Vegan character generation, in most respects, should be double-streamed.
First, they will be operating within "normal" (human) Imperial society. 
Secondly, they will be operating within their own society. 

You could generate Vegan characters as normal human characters.  This is
as close to the "official" way to do it as I am aware of.  However, it
will neglect the unique elements of Vegan society.  This is not a
problem in a CT (or Gurps T) campaign, where the Imperial rules, er,
rule.  It could be a problem in a campaign where Vegan society is more
important.

The most important difference between humans and Vegans is the
lifespan.  Remember the aging rolls?  Vegans don\'t have to do them.... 
Remember the 70 years between the collapse of the Third Imperium and the
New Era?  The Vegans do, in precise and "I was there" detail.  They WERE
there!  In the TNE setting, there are BILLIONS of Vegans who where
former citizens of the Third Imperium! They haven\'t forgotten anything. 
They know about TL15....

I don\'t know what the Vegans were doing during Milieu 0.  All I know is
they were the Vegan Polity, they had the Easter Concord to coreward, and
the Old Earth Union and the Dingir League to rimward.  Dull, huh?

Regarding this and the other recent postings on Bolos, it seems to me the main obstacle to creating early to middle Mark-series Bolos is not so much the weapons tech as it is the level of AI available in Traveller rules. Besides, do you really want a Virus-driven Bolo to deal with?
I recently read a Bolo story in which a planet had some Bolos parked in orbit, using them as weather sattelites or something. Wouldn\'t THAT be a nasty shock to an invading force. (Nope, no system defenses, just a few obsolete satellites. Let\'s go raiding!  BOOM)

    'body' => 'Walter Smith asked for a few suggestions as to what various bits of
Traveller artillery would look like.
Here goes :-
i. Kinetic Kill weapons eg. Thor system.
From a distance, they\'d look like shooting stars as the bars (?telegraph
poles) re-entered.
I guess close up they\'d look like orange-white hot lumps with a \'smoke\'
plume behind (with high-speed photography??).
There would be a sonic boom as well, probably in a small area around the
site of impact, although you can hear aircraft from several kilometers
away...
Damage is a function of their kinetic energy at impact (which would
precede the sound - if you heard them come in, you\'re not at ground
zero!).
For an object in low Earth orbit :- potential energy = mass X accel due
to gravity X height -
say one million joules for a one kilo lump 100 km up (g=10ms^-2).
Ow. Big explosions. You can imagine the ground just erupting as a flock
of these things hit - like a much more upmarket cluster bomb
explosion...
Danger space rules for energy weapons and artillery in the core rules
can help you resolve the proximity issue, by comparing \'energy content\',
if you like.

ii. Fusion guns : colour is a function of the plasma temperature - the
star system generation rules in pre-T4 Traveller might be useful.
I think it\'s the Stefan-Boltzmann law (?) which states that the
wavelength of radiation emitted by a black body is proportional to the
4th power of its temperature..
Trajectory is a function of muzzle velocity. I suppose the plasma beams
are going to be pretty much straight line. There may be a blobbing
effect with the rapid pulse weapons, depending on the frequency of fire
and the velocity of the plasma \'packet\'.
Signature for energy weapons is listed as high - lots of light flashes,
lots of LOUD cracking sounds as more air gets ionised by the plasma.
Maybe rapid pulse guns sound like someone peeling apart an enormous
strip of Velcro..

iii. Particle beams : The same colour considerations apply. We can
similarly generalise about danger space (vide (i.), above).
I reckon these look and sound like lightning - but arrow straight until
it hits something.
Explosions - tricky. What\'s the building made of? You might just punch a
hole straight through a (soft, thin) wall and then ignite the contents -
boom. Or someone might build with bonded superdense and you\'ll just have
a big patch of wall boiling off and falling on the street below in hot
droplets...

iii. Anti-laser aerosols
Multi-wavelength (?broad-spectrum) aerosols would probably look like
thick black smoke with whatever wavelength of light or infrared, etc. it
blocked (total internal reflection).
For less efficient aerosols, scattering will produce some colour
proportional to particle density (compare the colour of the sky with
changing atmospheric conditions and time of day).
Particle size and density could be problematic - unless you\'re using
breathing apparatus.
Anything much smaller than 20 micrometers is going to be deposited in
the deepest parts of the respiratory tree. An acute asthma attack is the
last thing you would want to have on a battlefield with laser cannon
present!
I cannot recall the various parts per million (ppm) concentrations of
any aerosol required to have respiratory effects - the only RPG I\'ve
seen these in was Fantasy Games Unlimited\'s \'Space Opera\' (!). A
textbook of occupational medicine or ventilation engineering (or
friendly expert therein) is suggested.
It would be a damn shame to be cooked by laser scatter behind your cloud
of \'protective\' mist. Unfortunately it wouldn\'t happen. The idea of
these aerosols is to disperse the light beam so little or no power gets
delivered to a large area (large energy in a short time to a small area
equals big damage).
Now an interesting possibility exists. Anti-laser aerosols and
sandcaster \'sand\' are probably of a similar chemical composition
(?plastic or inorganic crystals - literally sand?). If one could heat
them up enough in their mist form and they supported combustion, you\'d
have a fairly good fuel-air bomb.......

My last contribution on Vegans was obvious garbage.  Their physical
stats  will be influenced by their homeworld, of course, but not twice. 
The way I suggested it, the homeworld modifiers would be applied twice. 
Basically, physical stats start at the human level, but are modified by
homeworld as normal.  Given that the usual homeworlds for Vegans are
worlds resembling Muan Gwi, they will have the kind of weenie physical
stats that I was thinking of.

In other words, Vegan stats will start at 777 (or TNE 666) and then have
the homeworld modifiers applied to them.

Thankyou to all the members of the list who helped me in my claim against

It would have been impossible to get anywhere without the testimonies to
the

*ob Trav. what measures would be in place in the Imperium to cover damage
to 
and/or loss of goods or messages in transit. I mean the Imperium grants
licences
for traders to carry mail, right, so what compensation backing and or
guarantees 
would exist to allow it to be viable? Nobody is going to send precious

goods aren\'t covered by insurance, just to see them nicked by some nasty

procedures
in place, I take it the Imperium, or the Trading Corps would.

While some people who go to the ranger School are not Ariborne, all three

In addition, just about anybody can go through Airborne School.. the 82nd
is hardly an elite unit with 14,000 soldiers.

Special Operations Detachment Delta is an Army unit.  From it\'s commander
down to the newest memeber, they are drawn from the Army\'s special Forces
and Ranger units.  They *work* with other teams (SEAL 6 most often), but
are not a multi-service operation.

The only real multi-service SpecWar orgaization is the 1st Joint Special
Operations Command at McDill ARB.  This Command was created after Desert
One and Grenada showed a desperate need for coordination of SpecWar assets.
 The command rotates among the services.  IIRC, the current commander is a
USMC Major General.

pictured on Freelance Traveller http://w3.execnet.com/jeffz or
(http://www.tightbeam.com/FreelanceTraveller).  Colors discussed
were yellow sun on black cap, without ruling out other color
combinations.

Construction: None of the caps I checked (at their "on the spot"

Macy*s) were cheap construction.  They had waxed canvas,
all-cloth (85/15 acrylic/wool), and leather-brim.  The waxed
canvas and all-cloth were one-size, with plastic adjustable
strap; the leather brim was one-size with a leather strap with
aluminum friction buckle.

Pricing: Estimated cost for one cap will be in the $20 to $25
range.  Quantity orders will be discounted at the rate of one
percent per cap for each cap ordered, with a minimum order of ten
caps, and a maximum discount of 60%.  More clearly:

1-9 caps: no discount

I neglected to inquire for sure, but I would pessimistically
assume that different color combinations will price as different
orders.

I did not ask about exclusivity on the logo; I would assume that
it would raise the price, with a possible exception for a
guaranteed volume level.  If exclusivity is to be pursued, I
think that I would have to have (at the very least) some sort of
formal statement (writing, on letterhead, not email) from Marc or
a licensee authorizing this item.  I still take the position
that, even on the semi-informal level that this discussion is
currently at, Marc has a moral (and possibly legal) veto over the
entire idea; I\'d appreciate a comment on this.

Color combinations I\'m aware of:

Yellow on Black
This is the Cleon I original design, probably still used for sale
as souvenirs to tourists to the Palace, for the Palace
groundskeepers, and for off-duty use by the unit acting as
Emperor\'s Guard, regardless of service.  This is also the
probable Imperial Navy design.

Maroon on Yellow
This is the probable Imperial Marine design.

Red on ???
This is the probable Imperial Scout design.

Black on ???
This is the probable Imperial Army design.

Based on the machine I saw at the Mall, the Marine design may not
be possible; I saw red but no maroon thread.  I\'d need to know
the cap colors for the Army and Scouts; the sunburst color was
listed in the Imperial Encyclopedia (MT).

(Personally, I\'d opt for the original/palace/navy design.  It
looks the coolest, and accessorizes the best.  Even the New York
Mets went to a black cap for (some of) their uniforms; the old
blue cap, while still available, didn\'t sell well because there
was too much that it didn\'t go with.  Black can be worn with
anything.)

IMO subsidised merchants don\'t feel very realistic.  They actually pay
you to run an inefficient ship, and would also be a very large
temptation to "cook the books".

>A properly designed ship makes cash at 50% loading. 

Can you point me at one of these designs. I have been trying to make a
large freighter profitable at the 50% level and have failed miserably. I
can\'t get better than about 65%. It is easy with passenger vessels but
try as I might I cannot do it with freighters.

Note: I use canon depreciation (1.875% pa) - insurance of only 1% (IIRC
I read an article recently that put the average US corps liability -
insured or not - at around 2.5% of expenses) and a berthing fee equal to
volume (though this makes little difference compared to the above
figures).

Corps still have to look out for the short term. Paying off a relatively
low interest mortgage quickly costs you liquidity and loses you all
sorts of high return opportunities.

Free traders are part of the background as well as for PCs. If they
can\'t make a profit shifting freight or carrying low passengers then
what are the tables for? I don\'t think they were intended as marginal
business lines to be used as a last resort when all other options are
exhausted. After all high and mid-passenger rates are very generous when
they should be just as tight. IMO they were meant to be staples with a
small but reasonable profit, and they just didn\'t get an accountant to
check their assumptions. I can understand that ;-)

IMO they wouldn\'t be able to get by without some form of insurance.
Otherwise a single weapons hit or minor collision would bankrupt them. A
PC friendly GM is not something that you should factor into your
business plan ;-)

Such a high risk, high gain approach to business certainly has the
frontier feel.  The problem with such high risk businesses is the
failure rate.  IMO you would not be able to get the mortgage in the
first place with a business plan like that, at least not at the canon
rates. It would also make insurance premiums rocket.

Sorry, I must have been thinking about the Tukera Longliners. Al Morai\'s
present-day fleet consists of 53 3000 T ships with 1,200 T of cargo space
and 30 passenger cabins. The do carry cargo. AND passengers.
 
>And of course, if your "valuable cargo" is a celebrity holo-vid megastar,

You have four escorts spread out across 51 worlds spread from Raweh to
Boughene. Whenever one of your ships realize that they are going to need
an escort for a special cargo, odds are that the nearest ship is 8-10
parsecs away. Which means 2-3 jumps to notify it and 2-3 jumps for it to
reach you. Although I suppose clever scheduling might cut those figures
down somehow, odds are that your escorts will hardly ever be there when
you need them.

When are your escorts going to be in the right place at the right time?
Whenever you have a couple of months warning that a special cargo is due.
Otherwise in about 6% of the cases...

About the only way I can see it working is if every other major company
has escorts too and they have a mutual cooperation agreement. Which is
not at all an unreasonable set-up.

"THE EXPLORATION DIVISION originally surveyed star systems, but as new star

Shirene. The Exploration Division currently operates a large geological
survey team, with prospecting detachments throughout Shirene." [SMC, p. 30]

Not in 1110. That service was discontinued in 589 and wasn\'t resumed until
after the Rebellion. [SMC, p. 31] ButI admit that they do trade with some
Imperial planets with Amber Zone classification (Roup was the one I found

As soon as they are notified, of course. What Navy commander is going to

What are the odds that one of your escorts are closer to the trouble spot
than an Imperial squadron?

issues that are being discussed elsewhere.

You mnust have missed the first part of the discussion. I was defending
the notion that maybe the Imperial Navy had a huge number of mothballed
ships in peacetime, so many that even after six years they hadn\'t
managed to reactivate all of them, as witness the fact that even after
six years they hadn\'t reactivated all the Azhantis.

>(Don\'t get me wrong, the Lightning is a beautiful ship, and we all lo9ve it

Eh? What does the acceleration have to do with its combat performance? OK,
it affects the agility, but what 6G cruiser has power enough to let it
utilize its full 6G for agility? Even then the computer is much more
important to combat performance. Besides, there is plenty for them to do
apart from indulging in singleship duels with 6G light cruisers. An Azhanti
can make mincemeat of a whole Aslan _ihatei_ squadron all by its own. Or its
own weight in Vargr cruisers. Believe me, if the official history of the
Rebellion is true (which I admit I don\'t believe it can possibly be), Norris
would have plenty of uses for all the Azhantis he could scrape up. No, the
only plausible reason why those ships weren\'t activated earlier is IMO that
Norris had better things to do with his shipyard capacity.

I agree, although I think that IF he had wanted to, Strephon should have
been able to work out a message to Norris that would convince him of
Strephon\'s legitimacy. So I would think that Strephon never did send off
such a message. Initially he propably didn\'t want to take forces away
from the Zhodani border. His diary makes it clear that he expected the
way back to be a cakewalk. By the time he realized different and found
out about the strange quiscence of the Zhodani, he had decided to play
the part of the false Strephon.

I agree. And in addition, he may well have been reluctant to tempt the
Zhodani overmuch by sending off a couple of dozen fleets.

A third factor may have been the Siru Zirkaa. Someone once suggested that
the reason why Strephon didn\'t help out the beleaguered systems in
Corridor was a belligerent attitude on the part of the Restored Vilani.

He\'s dead on as far as it adding to the feel of the Traveller universe, but
not correct about PC\'s being on the recieving end.

Many of the powerful weapons (Meson and other Particle accellerators are
powerful weapons systems, yes. But, if one is running a large scale
military campaign (several articles were published for doing this,
especially for MT), PC\'s may be in charge of craft large enough tobe
survivable under such fire. Large Scale Mercenary games (under CT+Bk4 or
MT) will see much weaponry of great power unleashed.

As a backdrop, however, nothing seems to impress players more than an
"Imperial Intervention"--ortillery wiping out entire ground bases, brigades
of marines droping on cities, wave after wave of marine and army landing
craft unloading to secure the civillian sectors. It is even more powerful
when the PC\'s were involved in either causing or calling for the
intervention.

Even small elite heavy weapons troops can be impressive... and under both
CT and MT, I\'ve seen PC\'s survive a direct hit... months later, the PC is
out of the hospital, but still not home free.

It takes about 4 days per 1000 tons of ship to properly mothball it for
future use.

Every two years or so the reactor is refueled and the ship is checked for
damage.

As I see it, perhaps the delay in reactivating the ships in the Marches is
due to a lack of engineering crew, or, engineering crew rated on the AHL
class.

Or...it could have been what was needed to make the scenario work.

Actually, Bolos being intelligent already (and likely *more*
intelligent than the average virus strain) would *resist* the
"infection". There\'s at least one Bolo story where someone tries
subverting their programming. Getting caught at it would be rather
fatal for the virus. :-)

Pick up a copy of L.E. Modesitt, Jr\'s "Adiamante". It has a "harmless"
planet. It\'d require a lot of reweorking to fit Traveller, but it\'d be
an *excellent* way to deal with players of the "shoot first, ask
questions later" type.

For that matter, just about *all* Modesitt\'s SF has things you can
steal. Especially the two series:

The Forever Hero
- ----
Dawn for a Distant Earth
Silent Warrior
In Endless Twilight

"Adiamante" and the Ecolitan stories are great at showing how to have
*subtle* threats. The Forever Hero series is less subtle, but a few
"Devilkid" NPCs would go a long ways to liveing up a game. So would
their homeworld (earth in the stories, but that can be changed).

Basicly the planet is one big toxic waste site due to a combination of
poor planning and wars. There are occasional clean pockets where some
normal humans manage to survive. The "devilkids" are a mutation caused
by the conditions. *They* can survive in the contaminated areas. And
they are "superhuman" in a number of ways.

Subsidised merchants & liners weren\'t *designed* to make a killing, they were
designed to make sure that there was at least *SOME* regular trade done in an
area.  The thought behind them is, it\'s in the local government\'s interest to
get offworld stuff even if they lose money in the process.  The \'hook\' for PCs
running a subbie is that they get to keep half the money the boat generates
without getting stuck with the payments.  All they have to do is cover the
usual operating expenses.

FWIW, I did some dinking around with the CT rules & found out that with a
character with Broker-2 and a half million credit stake can *EASILY* run up
the 20MCr down payment for an M-class liner (100MCr cash price) in about a
year of speculative trading, including the 1000/ton freight fees to take him
where he wants to go (with his cargo) and no less than a Middle Passage. 
Further dinking around, with a 1MCr \'holdback\' from the 21MCr+ generated
in that year allowed him to make the first *5* years payments and still have a
hefty amount of cash left over, all generated during the 14 months\' wait for
the boat to be delivered.

Standard subbie contracts require the boat to service their assigned line 70%
of the time, leaving about 20 weeks a year to do some *SERIOUS* adventuring. 
And there\'s no reason why a subbie can\'t pay off its loan within 5 to 10 years
doing spec trading.  It\'s a good way to do a Merchant Prince style campaign: 
travel to far off, strange planets, meet exotic and different cultures, and
take them for every dime they have!  <grin>

The planet may not have formed the desired raw materials (low density, never 
had a molten core, lack of suitable life-based resources).  Plus, much of the 
Imperium has been populated by industrial societies for 5-10 thousand years, 
and many worlds will have exhausted their non-renewable resources.

In one of DGP\'s early adventures, they had a liner (a Tukera 1000t long-liner) 
that was not designed with the internal bracing/landing legs required for 
landing (to allow more space for cargo/passangers).  If it needed to land, It 
could only do so on to a special grav cradle or in a body of water.

I haven\'t decided about unarmed combat, but I figure on something like the 
table above, but less chance of lethal damage, skill having more of an effect 
on wound levels, and the use of CON/Endurance somewhat like in CT.

I have no trouble seeing them exist, since they are inteanded to run on routes 
that are unable to attract regular commercial service.  And, governments have 
shown an amazing ability to back enefficient and downright losing businesses, 
with or without books flambe. (At least, contemporay governments like the 
Canadian one have.)

Due to C-lag, one of the first places at least scouts go to, if not entire
attacking fleets, is at the same spot (well outside of 100 dia).  Even if you
don\'t come out near the defense that\'s out there (which is unlikely IMO due to
the vast volume of space out there), you\'re going to see the Native (qv) ship,
or where it was a few hours ago.  The Native ship has no chance to detect the
intruder however do to the fact that the Intruder wasn\'t there a few hours
ago.  The concepts of C-lag, native, and intruder are all in the Regency
Sourcebook.  

Plus, as Bruce pointed out, your BBs way out on the fringes can\'t get back to
defend the world they\'re there for.  With that set up u\'re going to see
either:

A) Walt Smith\'s (?) 6BBs (and escorts) going into to pound (or occupy) the
main world before the native BBs (2 in the hypotethical) can get back to
defend them.  

or...

B)  A large number of bogeys inbound to overwhelm the inferior native forces..
Either you flee or are destroyed and your mainworld is still at the mercy of
the objectives of the enemy.

The Azhanti High Lightnings were reactivated for the Aslan anyways.  Arrival
Vengeance was diverted for other uses (namely a recon of the Shattered
Imperium).  There\'s only 6 left in the entire Domain of Deneb (all
decommissioned) that are recommissioned for the Aslan (though we all know the
mission Arrival Vengeance was diverted to).

I don\'t think you do starship combat much, Hans, if you don\'t know how much 2G

Actually it is ZSU 57-2 standing for ZSU Armored, tracked vehicle; with 57mm
guns; mounting two of them.  You\'re probably thinking of the ZSU 23-4 which
is a quad mount of 23mm guns on the same ZSU chassis.  These also sported a
radar system that was considered the only true nemesis of our helicopter
forces after 1972.

Also true.

My main point was theat the original thread was about reactivating ships,
and why the hard-pressed Domain hadn\'t reactivated the AHLs sooner; I was
suggesting that - if they have a whole bunch of ships in reserve - the AHLs
would be fairly low on the list to reactivate, not that they should have
been scrapped or anything. I love the observation lounge too...

(Sigh. I miss the days when Traveller shoud;/could undertake projects that
big...) Those were *great* deckplans. 

With their mixed armaments and fighter complement thae AHLs make great ships
for defending against non-capital Vargr raiders, though.

The AHL\'s meson screen helps here (Gionetti has none).

And fighters aren\'t decorative, if you realize that you can build a
pile of 2000-ton escorts that will get an appreciable number of hits
with their bay weapon of choice on even a 6G, Agility-6 capital ship.
They won\'t hurt it lots, but they can chip away at weapon battery factors
and fuel tankage. Your Spinal Mount is a Weapon Battery. With the
tight design specs usually in use, it takes very, very few Fuel-1
hits to cut an entire parsec off a starship\'s jump range. 97% of the
fuel to make Jump-4 means you don\'t get to join your fleet four parsecs
from here after you get your butt kicked.

The only problem with this pile of Torpedo-Boat style escorts is that
it\'s hard to make them resistant to a swarm of ship-killer fightercraft.
You can either carry a slingshot that might hurt goliath, or you can
carry enough armor and anti-fighter turrets to ignore the little beggars,
but you can\'t do both. Not without making a bigger ship, and making
a lot fewer of them. And it takes a _lot_ of these "Slingshot Davids"
to make a difference.

If you\'re dreadnaught is busy in a slugging match with my battleship,
and my torpedo frigates are unmolested, they can nibble you to death.
Fighters are a cheap way to molest them. Anti-fighter fighters are a
cheap way to let the frigates work unmolested.

Not to mention the classic method of "working your way up the
food chain"...
Your fighters win the fighter-vs-fighter battle.
Your fighters help your escorts win the escorts-vs-escorts battle.
Your escorts help your cruisers win the cruisers-vs-cruisers battle.
Your cruisers help your battleships win the battleship-vs-battleship
battle.

The smaller ships have a role beyond adding color to your fleet.
An all-battleship navy, as someone once said, is a very bad naval
assets investment - but I wouldn\'t want to be the first country they
got mad at. <g>

Not to mention:
In the particular case of this hypothetical single-ship duel, the
Rampart missile-armed fighters were designed to fire with datalinks,
allowing them to act like reasonably high-factor missile batteries.

	*I* could have gone to Airborne School, and would have had my unit
had an extra training slot. Which, if you know me, would strike you
rather humorous. College ROTC students regularly go to Airborne
School, and not just Army ROTC, either. It\'s basically initial
parachute training with the usual Army attitude and calisthenics
thrown in. I figured I\'d skip the attitude and just pay to learn how
to jump out of perfectly good airplane. My jumpmaster and instructor
was an Air Force captain who\'d been sent home from the Army\'s HALO
(High-Altitude Low Opening) jump school because he wasn\'t taking it
seriously (a veteran skydiver, certified instructor and jumpmaster,
he had more jumps under his belt than most of the instructors)

Traveller Chronicle has Vegan generation for TNE.

Peter Newman (on this list) has a minor human race he created for one of my
games, who are esentially only slightly different from normal.

A few minor races were presented in JTAS, including Dolphins (T. Galactis),
and a minor race subject to the K\'Kree both come to mind, both for CT.

A few more (The H\'lassani, for one) appeared for MT in Challenge Magazine.

A note on using dolphins as PC\'s/NPC\'s in MT: to find MT Hits value, use
total of CT damage to unconsciousness + damage to death totals as life
force. Note that dolphins, as presented in JTAS/Best of JTAS, were
presented as a Bestiary entry, even tho\' they were sophonts, and thus do
not have Str, Dex, or End values. (I assumed 1d of hits represented Dex,
others split evenly between Str and End; YMMV.)

Rececyling will be *very* common on such planets. Hell, it\'s a good bet
that in less than 50 years people will be "mining" old dump sites for
the metals (and maybe even plastics).

Also, unless I grossly mis-remember shipping costs, shipping things
between continents here on Earth costs about the same as shipping
things between planets in Traveller.

their contribution, turning everything into Crimp. The result was roughly
TCr350/subsector for Deneb (I didn\'t count the three almost empty subsectors)
and roughly TCr550/subsector for Massilia. Taking the average, TCr450, and
multiplying by the number of subsectors in the Imperium (about 300) I get a
yearly GWP of TCr135,000. (Including the medium-population worlds would up
that by slightli less than 3%.(

1% of that would be the Imperial cut of the military budget: TCr 1,350. Of
this half would go to the colonial fleets. The remainder, TCr675, corresponds
to a regular fleet worth TCr6,750.

320 fleets of the size I propose in another message will cost @ 7.3 TCr =
TCr2,336, or about 34% of that.

A Fleet Tanker carrying 5 Fuel Shuttles and 5 Fuel tanks can carry 750,000 T
of fuel and can refuel in 4 runs. After performing a jump-3 it will have
450,000 T of fuel left. This means it can refuel itself and 500,000 T of
escorting ships. It will need cruisers and escorts to protect itself and
escorts to escort the fuel shuttles and kick the snot out of any SDBs unlucky
enough to lurk just where they chose to refuel. I suggest 5 cruisers and 25
escorts would be reasonable.

The average BatRon masses 2,170,000 T. If it is a jump-4 squadron, it
requires 868,000 T of fuel to refuel. The Average CruRon is 420,000 T and
would require 168,000 T to refuel it. Two fleet tankers carries 900,000 T of
excess fuel and would thus be able to refuel 1 BatRon or 5 CruRons. I suggest
that a TankRon consists of 2 Fleet Tankers (plus their escorts). Thus a
TankRon would consist of:

                          Tonnage          Cost
2 Fleet Tankers         2,000,000       504,000
10 cruisers               500,000       295,000
50 escorts                500,000       325,000

Total                   3,000,000     1,124,000

(Actually, if I was doing it for a TCS campaign, I\'d rework the Fleet Tanker
into a 400,000 T design and put five of them in a TankRon. That way a single
Fleet Tender could be detached and service one average CruRon if the need
arose. But the tonnage would be the same and the cost almost the same, so I
can\'t be bothered. Anyway, we know that at least one 1,000,000 T Fleet Tender
design exists (The _Gorodish_).

This is the kind of supercillious, condescending remark that has been known

They can get to it as fast as the attacker can. If they chose.

I can\'t resist the temptation to return you one supercillious, condescending
remark. Here goes: As you would know if you had actually read what I wrote,
jumping in withing firing range of the defending fleet is dangerous because
your information is at least one week out of date (usually two) and there is
no way you can know if the defender has recieved reinforcements. And if he
has, your attacking forces are toast, toast, toast.

If all you have is 8 battleships, then spreading them out like that is
propably not a good idea. But if you have a number of other BatRons it
may not be that bad an idea.

Walt didn\'t have the defenders two BB squadrons defending their mainworld,
but some of their lesser worlds.

No offense Dave, but there is a world of difference between learning to
parachute and leaving a C-130 from 300 feet in total darkness with 85lbs of

_Striker_ specifically mentions the Imperium. As for _TCS_, it reflects
the same basic realities (supposedly) as exists in the Imperium. Thus any
difference between conditions in the Imperium and _TCS_ rules ought IMO to
be thoroughly examined and justified.

I don\'t expect accuracy from a RPG. I do want (\'expect\' is not the right

Actually, I think it\'s quite possible to work out something that fits both
TCS and Striker.

2,000 Tigresses? That would require 8 million crew. Trin alone could easily
supply that, given time to train them; its less than 1/1000th of its
population. As for cadre, at a very rough estimate, the Domain has at least
16.5 million people serving in the active forces (regular, colonial, and
planetary).

Less than 1/1000th of the population of Trin alone? Try working out the
total population of the Domain.

>The Azhanti High Lightnings were reactivated for the Aslan anyways.

Well, I hope the third time is the charm. For the third time: That\'s the
central problem! Let me see if I can make it clearer:

1) The Domain of Deneb went on a war footing because Norris feared that
   the Zhodani would take advantage of the situation to invade. Eventually
   he realized differently, but in the meantime the Aslans and the Vargr
   had invaded.

2) Presumably Norris didn\'t go back to a peacetime mobilization while
   roughly half his domain was either threatened or in the hands of the
   Aslans and the Vargr. (Note: I don\'t believe that the Aslans and the
   Vargr had the strength to do anything like that, but that\'s what the
   canon says they did).

3) Since quite a few subsectors formerly part of the Domain is not under
   Norris\' control in 1124, his navy apparently got the snot beat out of
   them (Again, I don\'t really believe that that is plausible, but that\'s
   what the canon says).

4) If the navy is getting the snot kicked out of them, presumably they
   can find a use even for such poor ships as Azhantis. And it only takes
   1/10th the time to reactivate them that it takes to build new ones.

5) So if the Azhantis wasn\'t reactivated, then it wasn\'t because the navy
   couldn\'t use them, but because the shipyards had more important things
   to do.

The question is: What? Just saying that the yards had better things to do
begs the question. That\'s like answering the question "How isa Louie the
Dip supposed to have plundered Fort Knox?" with "Easy. The doors were open
and all the guards gone!".

>There\'s only 6 left in the entire Domain of Deneb (all decommissioned)

I can\'t quote you chapter and verse because I don\'t have the books with me,
but I\'m almost sure you\'re wrong about that.

>I don\'t think you do starship combat much, Hans, if you don\'t know how much
>2G sucks versus 6G.  That 6G ship is going to have a major advantage.

Well, that\'s true enough. I don\'t do starship combat much. It\'s also the
most unresponsive answer I can recall ever recieving, since you don\'t
explain anything. But don\'t bother yourself, I dug out my _High Guard_
and found out for myself. And I was right in the general sense:
acceleration does not in itself convey any advantage in combat. What is
does is enable the ship to use any agility it may have. And agility does
have a large influence. I also checked my _Fighting Ships_ and found that
you were right in the specific: A Gionetti (which is a 5G ship, BTW) can
indeed deal harshly with an Azhanti. Not only does it have a +5 defensive
bonus due to its agility where the Azhanti has none, it also has a +3 to
attack and +3 to defense due to the difference in the computers (If I were
reactivating Azhantis, I would take the opportunity to rip out the computer
and install a factor 9 (Or factor 10; are Vincennes making factor 10
computers yet, do you think?).

But how you jump from the fact that a Gionetti is a better ship than an
Azhanti to the conclusion that the Imperial navy would have no use for
Azhantis escapes me completely.

In classic High Guard, any fast ship carrying a Mod/9 was essentially
immune to light fighters.

(Though in a more realistic system this isn\'t necessarily true, of 
course.)

	No argument there--the guy I learned from did just that, under fire,
during the invasion of Panama. No point in carrying a reserve chute
on that kind of mission. My unit was a Tactical Air Support
Squadron--over half our pilots were jump qualified, because their
primary job was not to fly, but to hump around on the ground with the
Army as forward air controllers and air liaison officers. Crazy guys,
as I found out one year, during the annual parachute water survival
qualification. Normally, all you do is hook a parachute harness to a
speedboat and prove you can get out of the harness while being
dragged through the water, to simulate an over-water bailout. THESE
guys, however ... Have you ever seen a Marine Corps OV-10D Bronco?
The back hatch is removed and left in the hangar, and there\'s four or
five guys sitting on the floor, with their backs to the open door.
The guy in the very back has a single strap behind his hips holding
him in. The pilot comes in literally at treetop level, pulls back
hard on the stick, and goes into a 45-degree climb. The guy in back
releases his strap and all four fall out of the plane at about two or
three hundred feet, and then the pilot does a hammerhead stall and
dives back down to tree level. The Marines use this to insert recon
teams behind the lines ... our guys did it for fun to liven up the
boring water survival qual.

	But from my understanding, Airborne school itself is just the jump
training. It\'s only when you actually get assigned to an Airborne
unit that you start having to deal with the hairier aspect of it.
Those guys I respect. The pimply-faced ROTC cadets strutting around
because they went to Airborne school over the summer ...

Would that be UDT?  There are still UDT teams.  I used to work with a
former UDT.  As for why he didn\'t go for SEALs, "I\'m crazy, but I\'m not

The iron silhouette guys are in a different class than the snipers.  I\'m a

   This was according to the autobiography of the founder, who is an

(Do you really want a sane person for that job?)  He also claims that Six
doesn\'t

    So would anyother world class sniper.  LHO must have put in a lot of

Well each SWAT team has varying levels of training but all have more than
3x than *normal* police officers. The major city SWAT and Federal SWAT will
have the higher levels of training for SWAT. By the way if you want to get
some *interesting* looks talk to a police officer about the his
department\'s SWAT team training info and tyr to get specifics.<G>

No there was a precusor team a *step* up from UDT but before SEAL team was
finalized, you might call it beta test for the concept. Once the bugs were
worked out it became the SEALS. Todays SEALS are *different* from the
founding SEALS types.

The 500KTd carries 300KTd of fuel, with 1G and J3.

The 200 KTd carries 120 (Book has typo) FOR DISTRIBUTION; roughly 3x own fuel.

Both use 1000Td fuel shuttles.

The flexibility of smaller tankers, especially if you assume normal
distributions is in TG\'s of 2 or 3 cruisers plus escorts, is much better in
operational deployment for the frontiers.

I agree with Hans\' basic premises that fighters are quite valuable (even if
HG didn\'t make them particularly valuable) based upon using vector based
systems (BL, Mayday, Bk3, my modifications to use MT Vehicular Combat
rules).

One point to consider: like WW2 in the pacific, a fleet battle can only be
forced when one side or another cannot leave. Most battles will be fought
around fuel sources or populations; items of strategic value which cannot
escape. And don\'t discount battles around worlds... Few captains will risk
court martial for "Allowing a planet to Fall" (Treason, or at least Failure
to follow instructions). At least a token resistance; if at all possible,
they will try to lure the enemy around the planet so as to allow plandef to
fire. Also, keep in mind that grav-tanks can and will go orbital in order
to assist in defense.

Taking a planet requires an inbound phase anyway, and meeting engagements
can become single pass engagements quickly if the outbound force is
outnumbered.

Tanker ops do play a part in the offensive campaign: Jump in to the
outsystem, refuel on the inbound, and be able to retreat if enemy forces
are too high. The distance out is set to allow for inbound refuel before
engagement, with the tankers retreating before combat.

Those 2G AHL\'s may not be able to go far nor fast sublight, but they CAN
AND WILL use staged engagement: Fighters go in and soften up targets\'
defensive batteries (this works even under HG, if you use enough of them);
then the slower cruisers come in with heavy missile barrages and spinals
and bays. While the faster ships may be able to shorten the exposure times,
under newtonian (or gamer\'s vector semi-newtonian ala mayday/bl),
engagements are either single pass or by consent, even where consent is
forced by orders to defend.

You know, I took a look at the RCVG yesterday to see the stats for this
tank, and I noticed it had an AV of 258, but in the description it was said
to have the equivalent of 2.5 meters steel protection. Now, correct me if
I\'m wrong, but according to FF&S1, 1 cm of hard steel is equal to an AV 2.
This would make the armor protection of the Trepida 1.29 meters, not 2.5,
wouldn\'t it (since it would be figured 258/2 = 129 cm)?

I think that is the case - it grew out of the reforms that Lever (Port
Sunlight) and Cadbury (Bournville) instituted to improve the lot of the
workers (and thus get higher production...)

Dom,

I have all of the LEG rules from the second edition to the last one before
the went out of business. You might check out rec.frp.marketplace you might
find a few copies. But it is the best realistic gun combat rules.

Well, yes, if you want to get picky about it. :)  (The dangers of relying on my

Actually, your memory wasn\'t faulty. You remembered right. It says right
there in the text, "2.5 meters of steel." I was just wondering if this the
typo, or if the stats were wrong.

Several of their games come immediately to mind for me:
	Aliens RPG
	Phoenix Command
	Rhand: Morningstar Missions
	Living Steel

All of these use the same task and combat systems, with differing ammounts
of depth to the tables. The system is realistic, playable, a little table
heavy (not quite Rolemaster/Spacemaster Level, but on par with MERP).
Combat can be quite deadly. Shock kills, rather than simple impact energy.
Have only run Rhand and Aliens... Both Rhand and Aliens are lite on
background and heavy on system mechanics, altho\' what BG there is is VERY
well written, concise, and appropriate.

   At least 3x I hope.  Most officers only draw their weapons during yearly

They get their Academy training, and then only draw their weapons once a year.
SWATs get a lot more than range training.

The Traveller trade rules break easily when faced with operaters with
adequate amounts of working capital (eg enough money to buy a full load of
speculative cargo), and with sensible trading strategies (own the cargo,
rent the ship). They are designed solely for cash-poor ship owners, and
break when faced with anything else.

Part of what I really dislike about the \'vanilla\' Traveller trade rules is
they dont encourage this. What they encourage is short-haul routes between
a small set of planets.

If you\'ve got the multi megacredits for the down on a ship, you\'re not gonna 
be cash-poor.  And Broker skill didn\'t happen until Book 7 anyways.  High 
admin would have given you the same effect, but we were talking of characters 
putting in 5 terms & coming out with *6* skill levels total.  The original 
Book 1 rules didn\'t come apart as badly under those conditions.

Nobody\'s disputing they don\'t need some overhauling, even under CT after Book 7 came out.  And besides, it\'s easy enough for a ref to throw \'em a \'gimme\' spec cargo that they *KNOW* will sell good at that Sword World 3 parsecs away as a \'pull\' to get them where he really wants \'em.  Check the old Traveller Adventure for examples of this.

Thanks for the information; due to the extremely bad reviews it got, I never

My 1MTd design is actually a jump-6 500KTd design capable of carrying 300KTd
internally and an extra 500KTd externally (with a corresponding decrease in
jump capacity).

The 400KTd design I spoke of would actually be 200 KTd designs corresponding

How many? How long does it take a tanker to refuel?

Well, I said I thought 5 400 KTd tankers would be better than two 1MTds, but
the final size and cost would be very close anyway.

What\'s a TG?

That wasn\'t me. I don\'t have much of an opinion. I remember that the fighter
designs I made for the TCS game I was in were 60-70 T designs with factor 9
computers, but I never had them tested against more conventional designs.

Unfortunately everything you mention except the Marines is already included
in the 34%. Remember, the actual maintenance of the ships only account for
10% of the figure, leaving 90% for other expenses. Also included is
replacement of worn-out ships (but not battle repair and replacements). 
Research, espionage, and the Imperial Army is not covered either. Neither
are the Scouts, but it is unclear whether or not they need to be paid for
or whether they pay for themselves through the Xboat system.

Anyway, I can\'t see any of these accounting for 66% of TCr6,750. And let\'s
not forget that the Imperium have other sources of revenue than the purely
military tax.

I was wrong. The ships I remembered as active in the Spinward Marches was
active in 1107, but they all got decommisioned in 1114 and are the very
ones being reactivated at Trin (5 of them, not 6). There are two more in
Darrian hands which may or may not be in commision and some in the Scout
service that may or may not be stationed in the Domain. Also, the
reactivations are only scheduled for one more year, not two as I claimed.

Not the light fighters of the Serendip Belt (parralel universe #34478).
All their fighters carried Mod/9 computers. Mind you, you couldn\'t
really call them _light_ fighters; they massed about 70 T. But they
were the lightesr ones I had.

Perhaps the cruisers were in poor shape.  They are 120 years old or so, and
were originally tech-14 ships.  On the other hand, the conversion to CF and
tech-15 was done more recently (about 40 years back).  

We also know that they\'d been in service during the Fifth Frontier War.  It
could be that some of them had suffered damage left unrepaired at the close
of hostilities.  Perhaps they were prepped for storage rather than to go 
back into service immediately.  That could knock them down the queue.  That
was why some of the Azhantis weren\'t converted from fleet intruder to 
frontier cruiser, after all.

Then again, other sources suggest that Deneb was looking at reactivating 
300 year old tech-13 battleships (the _Voroshilev_) in 1120.  Of course,
that adventure also claimed that no-one knew those ships were installed
recently with experimental tech-17 disintegrator spinal mounts, either.

I remember the Svenson fighter from a while ago - I thought it was a great piece 
of design, and packed a lot of punch.

I have a patrol cruiser/light fighter combo that I designed with some offshoots of 
the THUDDD fighter contest (FF&S2 spreadsheet):

The Waft & Fanfare classes are based around a stealth/standoff concept - if 
you can\'t be seen, you can\'t be hit, and if you can hit them from long range 
you\'re harder to see.  Admittedly this is quite a tricky ideal to live up to when 
using Bruce\'s DSR, but the lower your signature is the better.  As a result, both 
the fighter and the carrier have lots of drive masking and stealth-designed hulls, 
along with the longest range laser that I could fit into them.

One interesting side-effect is that they can\'t use fusion+, because with drive 
masking the radiator area required goes through the roof.  This should please 
those members of the list who like to refer to "The Abomination Known As 
Fusion Plus" - you know who you are!

Waft Class. A single seat light fighter, armed with a single medium range laser 
weapon. Excellent stealth capabilities and acceleration make this an ideal anti-
piracy or light commerce escort craft. 

Displacement: 15 std
Price: 80 MCr

Designed as a small commercial escort carrier for the Waft class fighter (see 
above), the Fanfare class Commerce Escort is a cheap and versatile way of 
protecting shipping from piracy or small-scale commerce raiding. 

The Fanfare carries four 15 std light fighters (designed for the Waft class above, 
but can be built to accomodate any similar fighter - contact your dealer for 
details and prices) and a range of supporting weaponry designed to give any 
pirate a large scale headache. 

Displacement: 446 std
Price: 770 MCr

If anyone would like the stats, I can send them to you off the list - it\'s probably 
a bit much to post them both here.

Shrug.  100 years of radioactive decay on a plutonium warhead would generate
the equivalent of a micronuke (around a ton of high explosive equivalent), and
make it completely useless; given that a nuclear damper probably reduces the
neutron capture cross-section for a micronuke, induced fission isn\'t a big
problem.  100 years of radioactive decay on a U-235 warhead is some five orders
of magnitude less energy, which is enough energy to heat the uranium up by
quite a bit (possibly making the warhead nonfunctional) but isn\'t terribly
dangerous to people nearby (well, lethal radiation doses out to 10 meters or
so).

Incidentally, one question still not answered: what is the radius of effect for
a nuclear damper?

Actually, Bolos being intelligent already (and likely *more*
intelligent than the average virus strain) would *resist* the
"infection". There\'s at least one Bolo story where someone tries
subverting their programming. Getting caught at it would be rather
fatal for the virus. :-)

True, but maybe I wasn\'t clear in the original post. According, at least to the Robots LBB, Imperial robotic/computer brains aren\'t able to achieve the level of self-awareness present in even the lower Mark-levels of Laumer\'s Bolos. In fact, I\'ll have to look to see if any level of self-awarenes is possible at all before, say ~TL20. This being the case, if you have a Bolo then it will be subject to Virus. If you say that that level of AI is possible, the Virus is no longer quite as big a threat, since it would seem likely that computers for starport and large starcraft would be at least as capible.

    'body' => 'When I said that a ship could be designed that made a profit at 50% loading,
it was suggested that this might be impossible.

It is true that it was an approximate remark
(ie I didn\'t have a design to hand that did)
but I felt sure that it could be done.

It can, but it is harder than I thought, so here is the design.

Notes
At TL15 making a ship that breaks even according to the econ chart on
Andy\'s excellent spreadsheet is reasonably straight forward, at TL12
it is harder.

If you want to have a liner, then it is easy at TL12 if you are carrying
high passengers or even if you are 50% full but with each passenger on
a mid passage.

Low passages are a complete non starter due to the costs of medical
facilities.

Pure freighters are harder. The problem being that cargo is figured as
seven times as dense as staterooms, so a freighter needs more thrust for
take off and thus more power. For many cargoes this would be too much
so I have allowed a 2G structure so that the extra performance can be used.

This design works only because it uses 1G contra Grav to escape the planet
and then switches to 0.5G thruster plates to move to the 100dia limit
(it can\'t run both at once).

There are no weapons and the streamlining was only added because it turned
out to be very cheap.

The cost is based on a one off prototype, mass production discounts
make life a lot easier - as I just realised :-(

Economic Design Study #3.6 was produced to explore minimal cost design.
As it does not fit within the profile of the Postmark Design Bureau,
there is no intention of offering ships based upon this design for sale.
However the design should be considered to be formally registered, and
licencing arrangements may be possible.

We are still able to take orders for lab ships.

Not really - the 100-diameter limit is basically comparable to weapons 
range; if the defenders are hovering right at the limit they have at
least a 50% chance of being in weapons range of an emerging attacker.
To have true security they need to be 200-300 diameters out, which leaves
the attackers (particularly if they arrive with their delta-V pointing at
the target world) able to get to the target much more quickly.

This is true.  Right now I am working up a champaign using the rules from
LGG, the setting from the Aliens RPG, & some background to Traveller. 
Basicly, the whole idea is that the Terran Confederation finds the Aliens &
there branch of the Marine Corps, called the Colonial Marines fights them. 
As time goes on the players will meet up with the 1I.  I would like some
input on this idea.

Thank you.

Well, we were (orignally; see the thread name) talking about the AHL, which
carries the 15-ton 
"Rampart" light fighter, who\'s only real role in serious High Guard 
combat is getting you a +1 on your initiative roll for having more ships
than your opponent. 

The problem with heavy fighters like yours or the classic Imperial Heavy
Fighter is that those Mod/9 computers are dammned expensive; fighters with
big computers are much less cost-effective than ~1000 ton light battle
riders, who end up with one computer for ten turrets of firepower rather
than ten computers for the same firepower, and are only one point easier to
hit if you make them 999 tons.) 

Fighters have their uses (please don\'t resurrect that debate!) but to drag
things back to the AHL, my main point was that its dinky little Rampart
fighters are useful only for patrol/system control/raiding, not combat 
against another capital ship.

How are you going to get 407 std (50%) of freight per trip?
Obviously, you ignore the vanilla availability rules and assume this is a corp
vessel.

Mine got here this morning.  *LOVE* the insert.

Best parts of the book I\'ve seen so far (course, I\'m biased as HELL here) are 
the detailing of some more of Reavers\' Deep (one of my all time *FAVE* places 
to hang out) and the cut-down star system quick-detail hints.  I could have 
done without the hand drawn stuff, given that the insert came with it.

All in all, I *LIKE* it, typoes notwithstanding.

Unfortunately, it\'s a book published by IG, & not an online archive.  I\'d love 
to see an online archive of this stuff, but I doubt it\'ll happen due to 
copyright restrictions.

Task Group. A naval organization formed from Parts of a fleet for some
sub-mission of said fleet; usually of a temporary nature. Also sometimes
known as a Flotilla, which is a misnomer. (A flotilla is actually a synonym
for a squadron, IIRC.) In traveller terms, since Ron\'s (a contraction of
squadRON) are ships of a single mission type, a TG is a multi-role or
special assemblage. TaskForces (TF\'s) can be construed to be either larger
or smaller versions of TG\'s, dependant upon useage. IMTU, they are
interchangeable, and set by the forming commander (who is almost never the
TG/TF commander).

An example From MY TU: TG Aramis (created out of the 214th Fleet) consists
of 1 Battleship,  2 Cruisers (from a CruRon) with their destroyers (a total
of 5 from the DesRon attached to the CruRon and the BatRon), 4-8 Type S
Scout/Couriers (attached from the 214th Fleet Scout Pool) plus any extra
needed from the scoutbase, one tanker of the 500 KTd kind, one of the
200KTd (from different tankRons), one carrier (from a CruRon) with it\'s 2
escorts and fighter wings, One assault craft carrying an attached MarDet
(Marine Assault Detachment) of combined arms forces, including at least one
regiment each of Drop Troops, Bounce Troops, Armor, Arty, and WetMarine
(Amphibious troops) plus it\'s escorts. Purpose of the TG: THe standing
fleet garrison of the Navy base. A matching reserve fleet draw provides TG
Aramis Reserve, with similar (but older) composition. One or the other is
on near-world parol, while the other is either in port (ie, orbiting with
skeleton crewing) or deployed for training maneuvers. When enough ships are
in port, TG-Aramis and TGR-Aramis turn over near planet defense to other
ships in system and go to another world in system and simulate combat
conditions.

Also in the system will be the System fleet, which is (IMTU) primarily a
few destroyers and a few PatRons (Patrol Squadrons). PatRons are the basic
naval unit with which my PC\'s deal... usually in one to three ship
"Flights" out of the much larger PatRons.

Now I recognise them. Played Aliens a long time ago, and wasn\'t too
impressed. But take that thought with the knowledge that there is probably
10 years of mist between the last time I looked at it. Then again, I\'m more
in the rules-lite school myself.

PS Legate mentioned running in the Aliens background - check out the
Colonial Marines Technical manual - quite a good source book.

PPS If you plan to play B5, you could do a lot worse than using T4.1 for
the rules (dropping PPG availabilty/substituting lasers) and getting hold
of TBP and the Earthforce sourcebook, combined with  the B5 security manual
for background.

This isnt neccessarily true, if you cant borrow against your equity in the
ship. The \'classic\' Traveller Free Trader is always scraping for the next
mortgage payment, which means you dont have a cold megacredit or three to
invest in a full cargo hold of accumulators or 7.62mm bullets or whatever.

It is a very nice, tight design. Greg Svensson built it to my specs - if I
remember right, it had to have 2 crew, pull 4 gees and mount a 250 MJ
laser. Later versions added missiles, and a small \'police\' version was buily.

Part of the problem with this philosophy is all that masking blows the cost

The minimum size of fusion plants restricted fighters to TL12 anyway ...

auxiliaries, and for beating up on ethically challenged civilians, but
militarily they are useless. A fighter just cant mount big enough weapons
to hurt ships of the line).

Power plant cost efficiency at TL15 is wayyyyy higher than at TL12 - they
are about 20% of the size, and cheaper to boot. Personally, I\'d add a
*little* more power - another 20 MW should ensure you can keep both the
jump bubble and the life support running.

The major difference at TL12 is the power plant, and it will take up a fair
bit more space and cost a fair bit more.

Yeah. The low berths takes up all this expensive hull space that could be

Why the AEMS ?

Finally, the thing that kills TL15 freighters is TL12 freighters are
reasonably competitive with them, while TL15 military ships absolutely crap
on TL12 military ships. Therefore TL12 worlds will build freighters, and
export them to TL15 worlds, in exchange for much smaller numbers of TL15
warships.

Note: this ship uses the unofficial fuel in waste space rule.

The James Clement Class bulk carrier is a very old design, dating back to
the early years of the Terran Confederation.  It\'s predecessor, the \'Ben
Allen\' Class, actually predates the Terran Confederation (it was built in
small numbers by the Commonwealth of Australasia from 2132 AD).

As the economy of the Terran Confederation became increasingly reliant on
interstellar trade, the \'James Clement\' was designed as a low-cost workhorse
transport that could be quickly built in large numbers.  Using
\'off-the-shelf\' components and a compartmented, modular design, the
\'..Clement\' could be assembled in separate sections, prior to final orbital
assembly.

The primitive nature of the \'..Clement\' is highlighted by it\'s lack of
gravitic technology.  At the time of the classes\' conception, gravitic
technology had been newly acquired from captured Vilani vessels, and was
only availablwe in the newest military vessels.  Artificial gravity is
instead supplied in the bridge, engineering and accomodation spaces by using
an interior \'spin hull\'.

Despite it\'s age, the class is still found within the Solomani Rim sector
and adjoining space in the early years of the Third Imperium.  It still
produced on a number of worlds (primarily within the Easter Concord and
Dingir League), as a low cost private bulk cargo carrier.

The Vegan Polity produces a variant of this freighter, known as the
\'Sastyuir Hsaar\'.  The primary modification is the removal of the spin hull
mecahnism, and it\'s replacement with gravitic compensators.

Slight error there. I was running the Serendip Belt in a TCS campaign and
the Belt had a TL of 12, so my fighters couldn\'t have a bigger computer
than Mod/6. Nevertheless, I still think the basic idea of stuffing the
best possible computer into a fighter, even if they become far more
expensive that way. Better 1 fighter that can hit than 10 that can\'t.
But as I said, that\'s pure theory; I never had them tested in battle.

So it is still a valid strategy for pickets, since 50% is better odds than
100%. Also, the basic problem of the attacker remains: He risks having
some of his ships arrive ahead of the others and 1) be outgunned, 2)
warn the defenders and give them time to jump away; and he risks jumping
into the teeth of a visiting defense fleet. Whether those risks are worth
running depends on circumstances.

They can\'t be in all that bad a shape or they would have been scrapped
rather than mothballed. After all, mothballed ships require maintenance
too, so they would have to have some potential value to the Imperium.

I have no problem postulating that the Azhantis were put at the very end
of the reactivation queue. What I doubt is that they would be so poor
ships that they would even be put behind new construction (new construction
taking ten times as long as reactivation).

An 200,000 T battleship may be worth more than a 60,000 T cruiser, even one
a TL higher (especially since the cruiser has a computer TWO TLs lower) and
it would only take a couple of weeks more to reactivate.

That sounds like a challenge to me :*> And since I was working on this for my 
Ships of the Interstellar Wars site anyway. Mitsumi Heavy Engineering takes 
great pleasure in unveiling the Reppu Fighter (I make no claims as to its actual

Perhaps one of the most unusual Terran designs to come out of the
Interstellar Wars period, the Reppu class fighter was designed in 2098 AD by
the JSSDF for service aboard their four Hiryu class Carriers. The Reppus
were intended to capitalise on the newly developed Advanced Nuclear Drives
(reverse engineered from Vilani examples) which enabled much smaller missiles
than had previously been possible. Consequently the designers were able to
produce viable combat vessel using a hull of only 75 Td. The Reppu was the
direct antecedant of the Terran missile boats which became such a vital
part of the Terran navy during the early Interstellar Wars. Despite its
insperation of the very successful missile boats, the Reppu itself was not a
successful combat design. It was rapidly rendered obsolete by the larger
missile boats which followed it. Although the Reppus were deployed aboard
the Hiryus as commerce raiders they proved to be only moderately successful
and with the end of the war they were quickly reduced to the reserve. It was
long believed that all the Hiryus and their Reppus had been broken up shortly
after the 1st War, however in 2547 AD the Hiryu class carrier Taiho was
discovered in the planetiod belt of Dismal with her full compliment of five
Reppus. Apparently she had been laid up as a contingency reserve for the
colonial milita and remained forgotten there. When she was rediscovered, she
languished for another 46 years before she was moved to the Colonial Forces
museum at Prometheus in 2593 AD.

Ahh TCS, what memories that brings back. I think I\'ve lost track of the number 
of times I\'ve seen Esperanza (TL 11) build a class of dreadnoughts mounting a 
factor K PA just to catch the 50 ton fighters built by New Home (TL 13). Not 
that the 50 ton fighters can really hurt anything, it seemed to just be the 
principal of the thing. :*>

Well, I\'ve been gaming since before Traveller came out, and _I\'d_ never
heard of Living Steel.  

As a matter of interest, how many other people (besides me) played
Traveller when it was first released?

I think that the real factor that pushes the bang per buck ratio down for the Waft 
is the 500kkm MFD that I fitted.  It takes up buckets of space and weighs a 
ton, so lots of extra space has to be used for thrusters and the PP to run them. 
 But IMHO it is an essential piece of gear for the craft - it enables it to use the 
extra range of the laser to good effect.

I have designed an "ordinary" light fighter - 10 tons, 200 MJ laser, 5G, 15 MCr 
to you guv\'nor.  I\'m not so fond of it though, because while the laser has a 
higher discharge energy, the range is less.  if you have to close to short range 
to fire your weapon, you can bet that any "ethically challenged civilian" (nice 
euphemism BTW) will be firing back with everything they\'ve got.

I agree with you to a point - certainly light fighters will only be of real use 
against the aforementioned ECC\'s, or of course any traders that the enemy has 
knocking around.

I have also designed a medium (33 tons, 100 MCr) and a heavy (50 tons, 145 
MCr) fighter in the same style as the Waft, and using Bruce\'s MCS (first draft) 
the gun on the medium is capable of doing surface hits to military ships upto 
~5000 tons (destroyer/escort sized), and inflicting real damage on PC sized 
ships.  I haven\'t rated the gun on the large, but it is more powerful again.  This 
means that heavy fighters can assist in taking out escorts, which free up your 
escorts to assist in taking out cruisers, etc.

Umm
4 x 300 MJ laser, grouped as 2 batteries of 2 w. MFD\'s
4 x twin missile launcher barbettes w. MFD\'s
A big fusion plant.
More of that drive masking & stealth stuff (suprise!)

Oh yeah, and 4 external grapples :)

	Unfortunately, you are reading it right. M:0 was computer-generated 
with a lot of mistakes. (Did you already notice that almost all 
planets have Law=Gob?). IMM0U (In My Milieu:0 Universe), Vland has 
Pop 9.

	This is not so important, because it does not mean a uniform TL:D in 
all fields. I assume TL:D is an average, meaning e.g. advanced 
biological sciences but TL:C in starships and military. My Geonee 
Second Confederation in M:0 has access to TL:D in some fields (even 
better, sometimes!), but this does not mean they can "outtech" the 3I 
in the most relevant fields for expansion...

in an honored place out in the garage somewhere.  Played it all of three

It included about a zillion counters, most of which were lost after two
plays.  Rules booklet, which included news service bulletins, etc.

I said that I couldn\'t do it for a freighter using canon depreciation
(1.875%) and a reasonable value for insurance (say 1%) in the expenses.
If you apply these expenses to your design then, even after bulk
discount, and installing a fuel purifier, it is not profitable at the
50% level. Though it is closer than my designs :-(

IMTU taking basic security measures reduces the corps insurance premiums
(e.g. minimal armor, turret(s), anti-hijack programs, minimum
acceleration). Hence justifying armed merchant vessels ;-). "Minimal" is
defined in terms of the value of the ship and its cargo, so bigger ships
need more / bigger / better measures. Measures above the basic level
reduce premiums still further though in ever smaller increments. So
while it may be cost effective for a big ship to have lots of measures,
small ships get by with much less, 

[snip: design for a basic 1000DT freighter]

Why no fuel purifier? A minimal purifier would make your design more
profitable.

It is normal to have triple redundancy in computers, as your life does
depend on them. It may then be cheaper to use a slightly lower spec
computer and have an extra engineer, though this is largely a matter of
personal taste.

I am a little concerned that it can only manage about 1.08G when full.
Obviously it can\'t take off with a full load on any planet with a
gravity higher than this figure. Though I guess if you are getting 100%
utilization you could either take less or take lighter freight. You
probably want to charge a premium for over-standard-weight freight in
any case.

Heh Heh. Up its power rating a bit, stick on a couple of decent turrets,
give it minimal armor & strength and install huge cargo doors. When
empty it can do 3G. You can fit a fully laden free trader in your
hold... Instant corsair ;-)

As for Living Steel, the same company did a roleplaying game based on Aliens

Had me going for a minute there. That should be 1550MW I presume.

Does it really need to carry a years fusion fuel? That\'s a lot of space

The available volume suggests 144 hours, though a 6 day purifier isn\'t

I also played 1st Ed Runequest (the one with the brown cover and Fanzine

Good design, but a question.  Why put a purification plant (and backup) in
an unstreamlined design?  The saving in space and cost would probably cover
the cost of refined fuel.

That\'s it. Not a big upgrade, but the only bug that has been reported to me
in the last month.

In the excel version, I\'ve also added macros to save/load "lightweight" text
versions of each of the individual weapon pages, thus you can save weapon
designs and bring them up in a variety of ship designs. I have not assigned
hot-keys to these macros...I couldn\'t think of a good combination. They can
all be found under the Macro area.

Some people have reported problems with the macros in Excel - something like
"library not found" errors or such. I have no idea what this means...the
macros work fine on my machine (and a few others I\'ve tested on). I\'m a
Quattro Pro 8 user myself, so I\'m afraid I don\'t know much about excel. If
anyone out there knows what\'s causing this error, please let me know.

Well, back in 96 there was this company called Imperium Games (IG) and they
published a game called \'Marc Miller\'s Traveller\',  sometimes refered to on

I\'m mostly in agreement with you there.  I suspect they\'re near the end of
the queue, but that there\'s been new construction going on at the same time
as all the reactivations.  After all, it takes a long time to build a ship,
so they\'ll want to be working on them early as well.

Here\'s another question.  What\'s the current condition of Spinward Marches
Fleet?  How long is it going to take them to replace losses taken during 
the 5FW (ended 1110)?  How bad were those losses?

It looks like some of our members are making assumptions they shouldn\'t
be making.  ;-> I\'m certainly an oldtimer, and there are a lot of games
out there I\'ve never heard of, and plenty of others I *have* heard of,
but whose publisher is a total mystery to me.  For example, I\'ve *heard*
of Living Steel and Phoenix Command, but have never seen them in a game
store and never played them.  Frankly, I didn\'t know that Leading Edge
Games was their publisher, although I\'ve seen/heard LEG mentioned from
time to time.

>As a matter of interest, how many other people (besides me) played
>Traveller when it was first released?

Here. 

I\'m a *real* oldtimer.  I got started with the original AH wargames in
the mid-60\'s, created my own squad level wargame that including
roleplaying like features so several players could interact during play.
Was delighted when I found the original white box D&D, because it broke
the strict wargaming mold I was playing in and allowed me to see the
possibilities of pure roleplaying.  Went through Tunnels & Trolls (in
many ways better than D&D) and first edition of Runequest (I liked it to
read but never really made it work in play) and some sort of
semi-roleplaying Star Trek game (I\'ve got it stored away and can\'t
remember who published it or if it came before or after Traveller...I
*do* remember it didn\'t play very well).  

Having always been a SF fan, I was on Traveller when it first came out
like a duck on a junebug!  I can\'t remember an exactly when in 1977 I
first saw Traveller in the game store, but I *think* I bought it about
this time of year and I *know* I bought it the first day I saw it.  That
old game store had one opened box of everything so you could browse
through the material to see if you wanted to buy it.  I remember it was
behind the counter where a sign reading "Shoplifters will be beaten to
death!" was prominently displayed.  ;-> It was, IIRC, a birthday present
from myself to myself, or maybe it was a Christmas present...us
old-timer\'s memory isn\'t as sharp as it once was...;->...but it *was*
sometime in the second half of \'77.

Personally, I never directly connected Traveller with the Star Wars
movie (I remember seeing in June \'77...three times ;-), but I think
Loren has said SW was an inspiration for the GDW folks, and a number of
players in my first games obviously were heavily influenced by the space
opera aspects of SW too.  In my case, the inspirations behind my first
Traveller games were Poul Anderson, A. Bertrum Chandler, and Gordon
Dickson stories.

The next few years were very interesting, with lots of good (and not so
good) stuff from GDW, Judge\'s Guild, Seeker, FASA (Freedonian Aeronautics
and Space Administration...I loved the whimsy), and DGP...I absolutely
*loved* the stuff by the Keith Brothers.  It seemed like everybody was
writing stuff for Traveller, and I bought a lot of it. ;->

Over time I drifted away from new material, because I was doing just
fine with what I already had, and my home-grown universe was already far
away from what was becoming...spit, spit...frozen in canon.  But I
fondly remember the exciting years of the late 70\'s when Traveller was
new, and there was something new and interesting to buy and *play* every
month.

Sometimes it pays to be the only one willing to be the GM.  ;-> 

I was GMing an every Friday night group in \'77 when I got Black Box. We
had recently finshed a fantasy campaign and had played one-of adventures
the last two or three weeks.

I got Traveller on a Saturday afternoon, read it that night, and had an
adventure ready for the next Friday night.  I handed out pre-generated
character sheets and ran a game that first week...it helped that 3 out
of the 4 players were SF fans and everyone was still hotly into SW so
they were *ready* for SF roleplaying.

I remember we had trouble with some of the rules, either I didn\'t
remember them or they weren\'t in the 3BB, so I did what I always did...I
confidently rolled a handful of dice and made something up.  The PC\'s
went off in a totally different direction from what I was expecting in
my notes, so again I did what I usually ended up doing...I confidently
refered to my hidden notes that had nothing to do with what was
happening and made it up as we went along.  Everybody had a lot of fun,
and after that I don\'t think we ever looked back.

The next week we spend the entire session creating characters (yes, I
remember a couple dying and I we quickly dumped that rule), played them
buying an old ship, then stopped and they upgraded the ship they just
bought, adding weapons and software, etc.  I\'ve still got that first
ship in the box with my BB\'s.  ;->

By the third week, I had a subsector generated and the players started
exploring it.

I started on Snapshot in \'79, I think.  I was a hardcore AD&D player at the 
time, which freaked the hell outta the wife.  Before that, in college back in 
74, 75ish, I\'d done Tactics II & a few other hardcore wargames, but no \'real\' 
RPG\'ing.  I was playing with the CWRU gamers back in \'80, even though I wasn\'t 
a student at the time.

Was that the FASA one?  It makes good source material for *writing* about ST, 
but as far as playing goes, it just didn\'t work out too good for me.

I don\'t collect any more, even though I *did* get LOM.  (grin)  Love it.  
Mostly, I use what I have for ideas for PBEMs I work on.  I haven\'t
face-to-face gamed in about 10 years now.  Kinda miss it, but I really don\'t
have the time...

to it.  Oh joy!  The copy of Brilliant Lances I\'d mail ordered arrived
today, too!  

I just opened LoM and quickly skimmed though it.  It looks good.  I\'ll
get to BL after I finish with my email.

Mark,

I\'ve been using Corel 6 for deck plans and floor plans. I haven\'t seen LoM
yet :( but I can\'t wait! If you\'d like contact me by private mail and maybe
we can swap some files. I\'ve been doing "component" designs for star ships,
then using them to "fill in" the deck outlines.

Traveller Class of 1977. First set of LBBS sold by my (now long gone FNGS).
Reffed the first game for my game group (prior to Traveller mostly WWII,
Civil War, with a bit of D&D for variety) 2 weeks later.

No, this was *way* before FASA\'s ST game.  It was...Starships and
Spacemen, or something like that.  Maybe it was by FGU?  One of the
first things they did?  It might not have been as bad as I remember, but
my memory says that it was BAD.

Does anyone remember Starfarers Guide series that Phoenix Games put out?

Not me, Rob!  I waited a few months after it was released!  (Feb or Mar
\'78)  Hm.  What month *was* Traveller released in 1977?  I\'m sure I
remember an interview with Marc Miller stating some Star Wars
inspiration, so it couldn\'t have been earlier than June 1977.  (Unless he
was influenced by those bland Thomas/Chaykin comic books.)

    'body' => 'I have seen the ongoing discussion about the uses of fighters, and couldn\'t
resist sticking my oar in the water...

     IMTU, I use the fighters in a squadron role.  As I see it (under HGv2
rules), any single hit on a fighter, while may not necessarily destroy it,
most likely will cause a mission kill (take out the weapon battery, kill the
pilot, etc.)  I assume that a squadron of fighters (10 fighters in my case)
either has some sort of datalink system w/ it\'s squadmates or is being
controlled by a Fighter Direction Center on the mother ship.  This enables me
to use the fighters as a single ship, w/ a battery size of 9 usually (7 w/
missiles). I keep track of the # of hits on the squadron, and reduce the
weapons code accordingly.  The ships must all be alike...same weapons systems,
same agility, same computer, etc;  anything that changes a fighter to where it
no longer matches the squadron makes it a mission-kill.

     One additional rule I use, which is neither specifically stated or denied
by HG is that ships operating at the same range to each other may combine
thier defensive fire;  that is a cruiser and a destroyer may use thier lasers
or casters against incoming fire aimed at a battleship, as long as all three
ships are at the same range.  This makes smaller ships like destroyers and
escorts much more useful in the screening role, just as DDG\'s and CG\'s today
are used to screen the CV\'s.  This role is also one that fighter squadrons are
a natural for...the more space and energy you can put into a mobile turret (as
it were) is more you can add to your capital ship (within reason), and it
provides the enemy w/ a target-saturated environment.  A single TL15 Tigress
can out the equivalant of 30 factor-9 lasers...thats more than any other ship
in Fighting Ships except the Kokirakk-class DN!  Granted it\'s mostly defensive
firepower only, but still...and how many PC\'s ships do you know and handle a
hit from a factor-7 nuke shot? (One crit hit for each code the weapon factor
exceeds the hull code...I don\'t know if it was in HG but it was in MT, and I
think its a realistic rule.)

Anyhow, any feedback or holes you might find in my reasoning would be
appreciated.  (Also, the rule regarding the defensive fire is just that:
DEFENSIVE.  No 5 DNs combining thier spinal mounts against one ship in one
shot...players tried that the first time.  You know they are:-)

This might be a good technique for a ship running bulk cargo on a known route, maybe a megacorp hauler that has shuttles waiting for it or a \'tug\' to pull it to a \'high\' starport\'. I think I would want a minimal maneuver drive if I had any thoughts about running a free trade route.
Another idea I\'ve been playing around with as a megacorp ship - a refinery ship (Nostromo class, anyone?) to take advantage of localized high purity deposits in asteroid belts and on planets without having to incur the unprofitable hauling of raw ore, and avoiding the cost of abandoning or moving a permanent installation when the local ore vein plays out. What size would you think appropriate?  I see it as streamlined, jump-1, man-1, use bulk haulers for the purified metals. Not an especially good ship for PC\'s but a possible encounter/nemesis if a corp was pirating ore reserves in restricted or interdicted areas. The PC\'s could be hired by the equivalent of Greenpeace or a rival corp to investigate. Comments?
>>As a matter of interest, how many other people (besides me) played
>>Traveller when it was first released?
Would 1979 be close? (I still have my original LBB\'s, and Paranoia Press\'s Scouts and Assassins - thought it was pretty cool until I tried to generate a character with it.)

It could have been Space Opera by FGU.  It was HORRIBLY bad, IMHO (but I still
have it in my game room.  Go figure)  You have to be nice to it though...Phil

I agree!!!!!

At least TRI TAC had some neat stuff and could still be played, but I did
run a Space Master/ICE game for about three years, then we went TRI TAC.
But Space MMaster has some neat stuff Dark Space, a Dunesque Universe
And if you edit the rules, it can be played!!!!!!!!! Really It can People

I agree that the combat system for the Morrow Project was clumsy, but the
idea of trying to save the world after the Holocaust was great.  I ran my
group in a cross over into Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.  While the Team slept
the Twilight War of Twilight 2000 was fought, the nations started to
recover then the ecosystem collapsed.  Eventually they reach the city in
the sea and make contact and try to accelerate their rebirth.  However, Mil
Gov shows up having used Morrow Project technology to freeze several
thousand personnel and their dependants.  The look on the players faces
when a Mil Gov officer asks their names turns to a terminal and gets a full
readout of their Morrow Project personnel files was fantastic.  They went
berserk when they found out how Mil Gov got the files.  It seems that one
year into the war somebody noticed that Morrow Industries was using an
excessive amount of resources for the equipment being produced.  This
resulted in the trial and execution of Bruce Morrow for treason and the
capture of the majority of the Morrow Project.  As you can imagine the
players after their escape went whole hog in hunting down and killing Mil
Gov troops.

Well, in point of fact, I was pretty much the only one willing to GM anything,

a game no one else was interested in playing. )-: So I kept on with D&D.

Well, as much as I hate to think about it, I played my first game of
Traveller in a \'after-hours\' game at a bookstore in Renton, Wa back in late
\'78 or early \'79.  Didn\'t get seriously into it until \'83 though...

I have need of a FFS2 vehicle spreadsheet. I managed a grav vehicle well

supported.

VDS and Rob Prior\'s Infinity-V are nice but being a PC user I kind of feel

No, this was before Space Opera.

Ah ha!  I didn\'t find my copy, but I did find an old FGU catalog in my
Space Opera box.  It was _Starships and Spacemen_, by Leonard Kanterman.
The game was very Star-Treky without being exactly "Star Trek", so I\'m
sure they didn\'t have a licence from GR or Paramount.  I\'m not sure it
was so bad, but I\'ve blocked a *lot* of it out of my memory, so I
suspect it was. ;->

Oh, man!  Heck no!  You\'re just a youngster compared to us *real*
oldtimers.  I was *teaching* junior high when Traveller came out in \'77.
Of course, age isn\'t a factor with Traveller, it\'s all in how you play
the game.  I hope we\'re all still going strong when we\'re retired and
have the time to get together and play like we did when we were kids.

Rob, it would for me.  I run OS/2 on my home system, this means I can
run OS/2 programs, DOS programs, Java programs and Win3.1 programs, but
can\'t run Win9x.  It\'s too bad you can\'t do it with a Java tool to make
it more portable, but I understand the need to use what\'s available.

I\'ll help out if I can run the software.  Of course, I\'d *rather* have
you port Mecator or do an FFS version of Infini-V. ;->

I can\'t help you much there, but I got a mailer from CodeWarrior at work
a couple of months ago.  It said they would *give* copies to instructors
that are using CodeWarrior to teach courses.  If you\'re going to be
teaching with CW this fall you might want to check with them and see if
you can get a free copy and/or manuals.

	I think that would be Chris Griffen\'s page at:
		http://www.best.com/~cgriffen/traveller/deneb.shtml

	As a confirmed TNE devotee, I wouldn\'t dream of trying to 
persuade you to switch to another version of Traveller.  In fact, I\'d 
like to invite you to join the TNE-RCES mailing list, which is devoted to 
discussing and producing background for TNE.

	Send a message with the word "subscribe" in the body to 
listproc@tower.ml.org

	IMHO, it has a much higher Signal/Noise ratio than the TML.  Also,
follow the links on Chris\' page to the BARD pages, which are a collection
of many of the best things posted on TNE-RCES.  You can get the complete 
archives from the listproc or a searchable but less complete version at 
www.reference.com.

I got Mayday whenever that came out, and then bought Traveller because I
wanted to build ships and planets. I did this for a year before I realised
you were supposed to play the game WITH OTHER PEOPLE!

My high school gaming club actually played space combat using the vector
movement system from book 1. Our ships were represented by bits of polar
coordinate graph paper glued on cardboard with fishing line coming out the
centre; we wrote down our current velocity (eg. 10cm at 225 degrees) and
figured weapon ranges and course changes with the fishing line. Ghod, it
was great.

I played it a bit in 1977 but moved back to FRPGs when Runequest came out
in Summer 1978...  The people to whom I had ready gaming access were just
that - wargamers - and our SFRPG sessions quickly turned into SF skirmish
games, nothing more, through no fault of the game system...

Version 2.6 of my FF&S2 starship spreadsheet is now available.



Some people have reported problems with the macros in Excel - something like
"library not found" errors or such. I have no idea what this means...the
macros work fine on my machine (and a few others I\'ve tested on). I\'m a
Quattro Pro 8 user myself, so I\'m afraid I don\'t know much about excel. If
anyone out there knows what\'s causing this error, please let me know.

I\'ve had some problems with Excel recognizing macros from other spreadsheets, especially Lotus. It seems that Excel uses Visual Basic as a macro language, and will translate only very basic macros from other spreadsheets. Hope this helps.

That\'s the task system I strongly recommend for T4 and the eventual
T4.1, unless we reverted to TNE\'s 1d20.  I actually have found a couple
of uses for 1d3\'s (the half die), but *really* don\'t want it in the Task
system. Except I call Average, Routine, and Impossible I call Hopeless.

I also recommend keeping the Attributes to a narrower range, say ranging
from 4 to 10 for normal humans.  Characteristics above 10 should be the
provence of the truly exceptional human, and anything below 4 is pretty
much disabled.  If the player wants to play very low or very high, then
that\'s fine, but it should be a player call and the GM should vet those
decisions not a random die, IMO.  Limiting humans to this range also
allows aliens to extend higher or lower in selected attributes...for
flavor.

With the probabilities from the dice sequences printed above, assets
around 12 are right for "professional" level characters, 74% at
difficult tasks and virtually guaranteed at average ones.  This means
you generally need skill levels of 4 to 8 for PC\'s with stats around
average.

This means Skill Levels need to be a *little* higher.  And that means
you need to give out a few more skills for each term.  Personally, I
like the player to have a lot of say in what skills they get, but I also
want an element of random luck and requirements based on background and
careers. 

As for as numbers, I use 4 per term from the career\'s required list,
plus 2 free pick "hobby" skills, plus the possibility of 1 more from
commission or promotion.  That give 6 or 7 skills per term.  Characters
also get 6 to 8 background skills, depending on homeworlds, tech levels
and so on, and another 3 or 4 levels of career skills during the basic
training for their careers.  A 6 term adventurer (42 years old) gets
from 45 to 58 levels to spread across his skills.

With a skill list like T4/T4.1 (MT or TNE too for that matter) a well
developed character will have somewhere around 15 skills...in my
experience.  And with this scale what you need is something like, one or
two at 7-8, two or three at 5-6, three or four at 3-4, and five or six
and 1-2.

This works.

Of course, if the player has a good concept go with that.  Don\'t be a
slave to any particular system.

This works even better. ;->

I believe I first started playing Traveller in about \'82.  I didn\'t
seriously get into playing it until about \'86, when I joined a group
playing in Dallas.  The group has been playing it off and on since then,
right Sam.

I got my copy of "LOM" on Saturday and have spent the entire weekend reading.

Thanks for a great product, even if it is a "draft" in nature.  It\'s a toss
up as to what will be the most useful item in the whole shebang.  I never
will see trade war in the same light.

Planetary development is definitely speeded up, but if  an individual is
still a little anal concerning details, they can find other resources.

I can see Cabot Enterprises and OBERG (Obergische Biologisk Engenjorisk
Raumforschung Gruppe) have their work cut out for themselves.  Cabot being
a quasi-military company of ex-Imperial Marine and Scout investors and
OBERG being a group of Naval Architects, Computer Programmers, and
Bio-Engineers.  Outright piracy would not be in either company\'s style, but
corporate espionage, payoffs, a few accidents might be up their sleeves.

By the way, who has the ISBA company description/registration form?

I might be interested in the further NPC and company development of OBERG.

Again, thanks Paul for your efforts.

The Eclipsed Sun of Rhylanor, OBERG and Cabot Enterprises are the product
of Eric and Maryann Holmes\' fertile imaginations.  Any resemblance to
persons or companies with these names is purely coincidental.

The book _Star_Wars_, by George Lucas, came out in October 1976 - complete
with "Soon to be a major motion picture!" on the back (surely one of the
all-time great understatements). The movie came out in May 1977, and
Traveller in June 1977.

It sounds facetious, but I have always liked the book just a little bit
better...

I liked Space Opera - it was a great Traveller sourcebook...

No, there really was a game called Starships and Spacemen, by Capt. Leonard
H. Kanterman, MD, US Army Medical Corps - "Carry Out Missions in the Final
Frontier", "Science Fiction Role Play".  (c) 1978, FGU, intro says it was
compatible with the Galactic Conquest quasi-roleplaying game.

I started in the late 70\'s. I\'m uncertain as to the exact year. But I recall

I loved the game from then on. I\'ve been playing pretty steadily since.

Aftermath was (and still is) a neat system.  The combat system wasn\'t
nearly as hard as it *looked*, but it is more complicated than I\'d want
to use today.  From what I hear, Phoenix Command would have swamped me
even in my rules heavy days.  ;-> It could use a more modern task
system...hum...maybe a graft from TNE would fit.

Even if you don\'t use Aftermath\'s systems to play, the environment is
good.  I plopped more than a few TW2K survivors into an Aftermath of one
disaster or other.

I too have had parallel gaming experiences. I started with Tactics II in the
\'60s and progressed to AD&D in the seventies. I remember picking up the black
box set at a gaming convention in West Germany while in the U.S. Army in
1978. I remember trying to make sense of the books and immediately
transformed my AD&D group into a Traveller group. I guess I was a child of
the original StarTrek series and found the game innovative but lacking and
started to design my own universe, which has progressed to approximately ten
boxes of material - including almost everything ever published on Traveller
and its\' versions. I found myself running games not only in Germany but later
as a civilian in San Antonio, Houston, Austin, and currently, Dallas. If
anyone in Dallas is interested in joining a serious highly modified campaign
Traveller group in Dallas I\'m starting such a group and would enjoy hearing
from you via e-mail or phone at (972) 783-4575)!

  Given its\' exposed position on the Frontier, and the purpose of the 
interior fleets as reserves, aren\'t the local losses simply going to
be made good from ships arriving as reinforcements? (also, once the
war gets going there should be a heck of a string of them coming up
well after the war is over)

I\'ve got a copy of Space Opera laying around someplace, though I just have the 
two books & not the insert.  Never played it, but it looked *somewhat* 
interesting.  The thought of a fission-powered FTL ship kinda boggles the 
mind, methinks...

A *NEW* Traveller supplement writtien by Andrew Keith.  It deals with piracy, 
privateering, & the like in and around the Carrillian Assembly in Reavers\' 
Deep.  It was just printed up a couple weeks ago, with a limited run.

He played an ensign on the *ONE TRUE TREK* series, back when even Gene

Yes, I remember the original shiny black box.  $12 for the complete game
wasn\'t it?

I think I\'ve seen Living Steel but I didn\'t pay it much attention.  I
don\'t have any idea how good it is.

Hard to believe it was designed by the same guy who did Shadowrun, hmm? 
If you read the one paragraph blurbs in the back of the Aftermath book,
one of the things Paul Hume muses about is how cool a setting it would
be if Magic started working again after the war...

Or it\'s spin-off, "Monsters, Monsters!"  I cut my role playing teeth on

Still, I liked the old black and white sketches better than the gloss

The James Clement Class bulk carrier is a very old design, dating back to
the early years of the Terran Confederation.  It\'s predecessor, the \'Ben
Allen\' Class, actually predates the Terran Confederation (it was built in
small numbers by the Commonwealth of Australasia from 2132 AD).

As the economy of the Terran Confederation became increasingly reliant on
interstellar trade, the \'James Clement\' was designed as a low-cost workhorse
transport that could be quickly built in large numbers.  Using
\'off-the-shelf\' components and a compartmented, modular design, the
\'..Clement\' could be assembled in separate sections, prior to final orbital
assembly.

The primitive nature of the \'..Clement\' is highlighted by it\'s lack of
gravitic technology.  At the time of the classes\' conception, gravitic
technology had been newly acquired from captured Vilani vessels, and was
only availablwe in the newest military vessels.  Artificial gravity is
instead supplied in the bridge, engineering and accomodation spaces by using
an interior \'spin hull\'.

Despite it\'s age, the class is still found within the Solomani Rim sector
and adjoining space in the early years of the Third Imperium.  It still
produced on a number of worlds (primarily within the Easter Concord and
Dingir League), as a low cost private bulk cargo carrier.

The Vegan Polity produces a variant of this freighter, known as the
\'Sastyuir Hsaar\'.  The primary modification is the removal of the spin hull
mechanism, and it\'s replacement with gravitic compensators.

	Where can I find out more?  Is it still available in some form?  
What setting does it cover and is it intended for a particular rules system?

I bought my first copy of the LBB (the original version before they discovered 
metrics) in 1978 (I was still at high school just). back then photocopiers were a 
relative rarity were I was and I had to copy the subsector grid by hand on to 
tracing paper. My Greater Magellanic Cloud setting has its origins back then. 
That lasted awhile and then in 1979 we discovered Runequest and instantly fell 
in love and Traveller languished for awhile. Strangely enough I didn\'t start 
playing D&D until 1981 and it just never really satisfied me after Traveller and 
RQ.

A few spring to mind
1 - The small arms designs from FFSv2
2 - Vehicles design from FFSv2 (though I get by fine with Infini-V)
3 - A T4 (or even better T4.1) chargen, though I\'m not sure you could do that in
    a spreadsheet.

My favourite would be 1, though I\'d expect 2 would be received better by the 
general Traveller audiance.

Not quite. 

A TL15 freighter gives about a 20% better return on investment than a
TL12 one with the same design specs. Corps would kill for a trading
advantage of that size. Would you move to a bank offering 10% interest
when your current bank was offering 12% ?

The general point is that the TL12 freighter is just as suitable for the
role as the TL15 one, providing the price was right.

In the exchange you mention the TL15 Gov. has the TL12 Gov. over a
barrel. Not only will they demand, and get, at least a 15% discount on
the freighters, they can charge what they like for maintenance of the
TL15 ships as the TL12 Gov. wont be able to do it themselves. Also they
are quite likely to provide TL15 warships with TL14 capabilities, just
in case their neighbors started getting any funny ideas about borders.

The TL12 Gov. would effectively have passed control of its navy to the
TL15 Gov. This is not a strong position militarily or contractually for
them. The position is better if there are other nearby TL15 worlds to
trade with (not very likely).

This is effectively the basis of the 3I.

There\'s one inside of Hard Times, I think.  Or was it Survival Margin?

It\'s geared for CT, but useable (with suitable adaptations of course) for MT &
mebbe T4.  You might wanna ask Phil Sanders if he has any copies left; it was a
limited press run of 120, I think.

I think an adjective (viz, \'marginally\') is needed in there :)

OK. Rip the armoury, the gym and the galley (what ? no Zen Room ?), and put
in an energy weapon of some sort or a missile magazine. MCr 223 is an
awfully big price for a defenseless delivery system for three missiles. On
the other hand, military systems are bloody expensive at TL9, so the Reppu
might be as good as it gets.

This actually isnt a problem. If the ETC shoots at you, then you get to
call for support from the real warships. Just remember to issue red shirts
to the pilots ... and give them a medal afterwards for confirming the
bogey\'s identity as a pirate.

If it\'s designed to escort merchants, then the stealth stuff isnt going to
be much use - the bad guys will just detect the merchants, and begin
evasive maneuvering anyway.

Apart from that, I\'d say there just isnt MCr 950 worth of firepower in the
total package ... but then, I believe in firepower rather than stealth.

I\'ve found what the problem is. The save design sub routine referrences an office

Norris SAID he was loyal to the Imperium as a convenient feel-good public
statement. It allowed him to justify any action he took (as loyal to the
Imperium) without committing to a faction on a permanent basis. It was clear
the Imperium was gone (to anyone analyzing the situation) but his stand gave
him time to build defenses and resources.

Its got an endurance of 3 months and no artifical grav, so I think the gym and 
the galley need to stay; and well the armoury takes up virtually no space. At 
TL9 warships are basically large flying partical accelerators. No other weapon 
system will work (missiles will be too huge and lasers just don\'t have enough 
power to be useful for anything other than PD against the non-existant 
missiles). Even on the Reppu I had to cheat and use TL10 missiles.

Actually, I didn\'t translate the PerfectScript macros to VBA...Simon Early
wrote the VBA stuff for Excel only...and I stole some of it for the later
macros. So it shouldn\'t be a translation problem, unless there is a macro
problem between Excel 97 and Excel 5.0 (it\'s written in Excel \'97, but I
save it as Excel 5.0 for compatability sake).

The Excel version actually has more bells and whistles compared to the
Quattro version, due to Simon\'s code. The QP version only has a simple TL
set macro (although it has a _way_ cool button...whoo hooo! :) )

Why is this a problem? Most ;-) TMLers have access to the Internet right,

Well, if you can regress to being a DOS user you might be in luck...

I\'ve finally got the department\'s laptop repaired and CodeWarrior
installed.  As my first project I figure I\'ll convert Infini-V, as I
already have the difficult code done and would just need to learn the PC
interface. The easiest solution seems to be doing it as a SIOUX
application, which is essentially a DOS terminal interface inside a
minimal Windows window, which only has the Save (as text), Print, and Exit
commands.

The other option involves learning C, which I should do anyway but is a
lot slower, especially as I\'m trying to learn Java too.

I\'m going to be out of touch for a few weeks, so if you desperately need
to reach me email Dom Mooney, who has kindly offered to field questions
and act as my interface with the TML until I return.


So long, and I\'ll say hello to the dolphins for you.

This actually can be done in _Battle Rider_.  Missile flights can be attacked
by anyone on the board that has a lock.  The target of the missiles also gets
a last chance at defensive fire before detonation.

This makes some sense of the "close escort" concept.  Those _Gazelles_ could
be assigned to a particular major unit as a screen for that ship.  It\'d be
interesting to game that out; the official storyline says the "close escort"
concept was a failure and that the escorts tended to be chewed up in combat.

I have gamed that out a few times...the escorts tend to get locked up w/ the
attacking fighters and destroyers...they kinda fight a mini-battle of thier
own while the BBs slug it out.  A single broadside from a ship much bigger
than a 5000dt escort will for the most part cripple a close escort, but while
it\'s doing the escort it can\'t bother the BB, which can in turn do the same
thing to it that it was doing to the close escort!

Hey, I\'ve gotcha on this one!!!   I bought the first boxed edition of the
LBBs back in about \'77 (or so, my memory is getting poor lately.....) 
Sophomore in HS at the time.  Been playing off and on since.

I certainly gave it a high rating.  Good job!

From what I\'ve seen, both the GURPS Traveller book and Behind the Claw are
coming along really well, too.

Well I got my LBBs in 1998, well the set in the Little Black Box.  But
my first set of Starter Traveller (The Big Black Books But Only Two) I
got in 1983.  I was so disappointed that I could not find the LBB in 
1983.  The Alien modules got rid of that disappointment as they were the
same size as the BBBBOT.  The main thing I lacked was the Spinward Marches
Map in colour, I found a copy of that floating around the local game store
about 1995 or so.  

Traveller is my favourite game, especially because in both a previous
game of Runequest a character got trampled by a tusker - on a limb no but
on a chest yes.  The previous game of ADD ended with the Orcs throwing 
a barbeque in honour of their slaughtered enemies :-).

My first Traveller character was 67 year of age IIRC and was a Merchants
and Merchandise smuggler...  Prison Planet was a lot of fun.

So favourite 7 or so games today

FWIW I use a modified MT task system like this:

  Task difficulty  Target no.

   Simple/Easy          5+
   Average/Routine      8+
   Difficult           11+
   Formidable          14+
   Staggering          17+
   Impossible          20+

Stats give +1 per THREE full points of stat.  JoT allows extra rerolls
with no difficulty increase.  Time factor is (3 + 2d6 - DMs)*10% of
average time for the task.  Uncertain tasks are done T4 style - i.e.
player rolls one die, I roll the other.  Seems to work OK so far...

Cheers,

Andy

Heritage did a Star Trek "fake role playing" (really a miniatures game)
for their miniatures, and that was the first Trek game I remember seeing.
 Gamescience (Lou Zocchi) had a game called Star Patrol (?) which, years
later, was expanded into something decent and rename Space Patrol (I may
have the names mixed up).  It was very, very heavily Trek-oriented.

Starships & Spacement was an early FGU game, predating Space Opera (which
was like Traveller with every single supplement ever imagined and C&S\'s
character generation, all put into microscopic print....wonderful
supplement for Traveller, but difficult to read).  

Do any of these ring any bells for yuh?

Uh, I was born in Oct 51\' and had been in the Army 8 years when Traveller
came out in 77\'.  Of those 8 years I was on my third Overseas assignment
(5.5 of 8 years).  I think I had physically travelled around the world three
times by then.

Me.

"White box" is *not* "original". The *original* was a sort of "wood
grain" print. The white box came later. (Which shows you how long *I*
was involved with this. :-)

BTW, speaking of *old* wargames, remember the instructions for the
"nuclear war" scenario in Tactics II? :-)

Hey Eris,

As the fighter thread is restarting, perhaps we could email Ken Bearden and
restart the task thread?

Then we could put up a screen of fighters to stop the pirates breaking
through thanks to task rolls that make near-c rocks too easy to create...

Hmmm. Corel can export to CGM, right?

The reason I\'m interested is that there\'s a tool to convert CGM to RIP,
and RIP is usable on BBSes and on the web (there\'s a RIP add-on for
Netscape, and maybe for IE). 

RIP uses 7-bit "text" strings to send vector type graphics (including
Bezier curves) as well as having sound capability. So it\'s *really*
fast compared with bit-mapped images.

Check out the web site: www.telegrafix.com.

This could be a nice thing to use both on the CDs and on Traveller web
pages.

You\'ve got me beat on that one.  I got D&D in March 1976 (for my birthday),
and it was a fourth printing in a white box.  I was around in time to get 
Eldritch Wizardy when it hit the stands, about the same time as The Dragon
#1, which I also got...

ObTrav: In this discussion someone else mentioned Starter Traveller, in
the two big booklets.  I snagged a copy of that from a dusty game store
in 1990, and it has been my favorite Classic Traveller edition for
carting around.  It\'s almost always tucked discreetly in a folder in
my briefcase, along with a spare copy of Citizens of the Imperium and
a few black dice with red spots, just in case I need a diversion at the
office at lunch, or on the road.  The folder gets moved to my backpack
for "fun" expeditions.

It seems Zhodani Terrorists have kidnapped Suzette Dollar and are

The $4.37 was found under couch cushions quite readily, but her 
husband is apparently balking at parting with the Boxed Set.  :-)

Therefore, we announce the reappearance of a newer, wilder, 
Traveller Chat, with an actual topic, and everything...

Actually, he had a Star Trek game (you played it with "ship counters"
that were 4" squares on a *large* area of floor!). It wasn\'t authorized
and he had to change the name of the game, races, and many weapons
rather quickly. I have a Xerox of the old rules around here somewhere.

Really?  My copy is from early \'74, and was the first copy in the game
store I\'d been frequenting for years to buy AH and SPI wargames.  So, it
might not have been the first print run, but it was the print run that
made it to Pensacola.  ;->

Sure, do.  ;-> I\'ve still got most of those old AH wargames stored away,
too.

That\'s true enough. Ten 55 T fighters (TL 15) with Mod/9 computers costs
three times as much as an equivalent 1000 T SDB. But a single such fighter
can defeat any number of light fighters (+8 to hit, -8 to be hit), so
between us it seems that we\'ve just eliminated fighters altogether.

If you are playing rules lawyer like that, then you\'d also have to knock off
one hardpoint for a 999 T design.

It must take a hell of a long time for the 400,000 T tanker to refuel.

I thought a squadron was a number of similar ships PLUS their escorts
grouped together for administrative purposes.

You\'re not alone! ;-)

If you\'re talking about the OTU the answer is: We don\'t know. The information
provided is too meager to figure it out without making some assumptions. I
once tried to figure out something based on a merchant fleet worth twice the
amount of the military fleet. I also tried working something out based on
the information _The Traveller Adventure_ gives about the merchant fleet in
Aramis Subsector. The two figures differed almost exactly by a factor 1000. 

>A breakdown of these ships in terms of affiliations 
>	(Navy/Scout/megacorp/minorcorp/private/noble/planetary militia/...)

Well, the Navy we\'ve discussed pretty thoroughly in the last couple of
weeks. The Scouts I haven\'t done any work on, but I guess something could
be worked out based on the number of bases. Merchant traffic depends, as
I said, on your assumptions Private/noble: Work out how many people per
million (or 10 millions) you think can afford a yacht (hint: average per
capita income is Cr10,000-30,000 depending on what rules you use) and
then divide the total population by that. Planetary militia would be
part of the planetary defenses forces which some calculations indicate
would be equal to 2% of GWP. 
 
>As an example just take a subsector from the rim and one from the core.
 
I\'ll see if I can dig up my analysis of the trade fleet in Aramis.

Hmm...

It seems Zhodani Terrorists have kidnapped Suzette Dollar and are 
currently holding her captive on the planet Zort.  Ransom has been 
set at $4.37 and a First Edition, First Printing LBB Box Set.

The $4.37 was found under couch cushions quite readily, but her 
husband is apparently balking at parting with the Boxed Set.  :-)

Therefore, we announce the reappearance of a newer, wilder, 
Traveller Chat, with an actual topic, and everything...

OK, maybe so, anyways.

This Week\'s Topic:

Renegade Anarcho-Syndicalist Nuns in Thong Vacc Suits

OK, don\'t like that one?  :-)

Let\'s try a real one then:

Stupid GM/Player Tricks.

A 2-3 hour purgative exercise on the silliest, dumbest, or nastiest 
things ever perpetrated on a GM or player by their opposite number.

6 PM PDT, 9 PM EDT, #traveller on Undernet.

Be there, aloha.

 This wouldn\'t be the one popularized in Murphy\'s Rules would it? The one that
involves lighter fluid?

 I started RPGs the same month that Steve Jackson\'s TFT:Wizard appeared from
Metagaming. Traveller took another year or so. Back then most of my buying was
determined by the reviews in Space Gamer...

I started playing Trav in Sept 1983. I was the first player in our group to
own a set of rules, when I got the following for Christmas: Deluxe
Traveller, The Traveller Book, and Spacemaster. Our GM got a set in January
of 1984, when I proudly rolled my next character out of the book, rather
than off his hand-copied tables. Reminds me, does any one know a Traveller
GM/Player by the name of Rick Singleton? Haven\'t seen that GM since he left
for U of Texas in 1990....

AS to gaming prior to Traveller: I started with AH\'s "Survival" and "1776",
in 1977, when my SHRINK (a PhD Psychologist) used it to both disarm my
restraint and to chaneel my agression into a useful mode. He also kept my
parents from forbidding me to play AD&D, when I started that in 1980...
about the time I started Jr High. I played a few (<7) half-hour sessions of
Star Frontiers (TSR) in sept 1983, then found the traveller group I stuck
with til may 1985.

Who knew I\'d become a gaming junkie... I haven\'t gone more than 6 weeks
without some form of gaming since Basic Training (1987, Ft Dix, NJ, C-3-39
Inf)... and, discouting that, since 1983. Were it not for the dice being
locked away, I\'d have had a group going DURING basic. Instead, I simply
wrote most of my own system during Basic... at least until they sent me
home... for being psychologically unfit: "Too Violent for the US Army".

Also, I haven\'t gone more than 9 weeks without GM\'ing since may 1985... and
50% of all that was Traveller in one form or another, but less and less
since GDW went away.

Not a bad system, but kind of stylized. Onnce you get used to it, it is a
wonderful (if ever so slightly rules heavy) system. Which, BTW, seems to be
back in print... I\'ve seen softcover single volume editions of SO at Boscos
(WWW.Boscos.com)... havn\'t had the time nor money to get it and check it
out.

SO is a WONDUREFUL reference for traveller; I\'ve even run traveller using
SO... Also, SO ties into FGU\'s Space Marines minis rules. I still prefer
Mega over all other rules I\'ve tried for Trav... altho I do use the T4 base
book Psionics rules with MT now....

The "Star Trek RPG\'s" I know of:

Starships & Spacemen, FGU, 1978. attribute based, obvious ST Ripoff, kinda
fun for beer and pretzels gaming, ties into FGU\'s other ST Ripoff: Star
Explorer (boardgame). Best noted for the Videni Carrier and the Zangid BC.
Zangids, the klingon rip-off, were not detailed as people, but their ships
WERE BAD. The Videni, a romulan rip-off, lacked plasma torps but did have
fighters.

Space Patrol, Gamescience/Lou Zocchi, 1977. Even worse mechanics than S&S.
Purely confusing. Some attempt at skills. Written by Kurtic and Russo. I
got it in 1990 for $1.50, and felt ripped off at that price.

Star Trek, the RPG. FASA, Two editions, both in the 1980\'s. Percentile
system, skill based. Not bad, but few tips on actually PLAYING the game.
Many decent supplements, lots of horrible art. Fasa can write, but they
sure can find the WORST B&W art in the industry...

Star Trek RPG (exact title not yet released): due out christmas this year,
New design/mechanics, new publsiher. Will incorporate TNG and DS9 material.

GURPS Trek: unofficial "On the net" coversions to GURPS. Interesting, and
enough for a full book. Too bad SJG can\'t get the liscence to run with it.

Prime Directive, Task Force, 1991 (?). Playable, but not aimed at ship crew
games. Focuses on "Prime teams", a cross between seals, Deltas, SWAT, and
Special Warfare (read as psionics and psychological). A two supplements,
both good. Two adventures, both good. Game mechanics are roll lots of dice
versus target numbers; read each die separately, use best single die, dice
open end on rolls  of 6 (couting as 5+ another die).

Twerps Twek: Reindeer games. Date unkown, still in print, AFAIK. Typical
Twerps. Red Shirts have penalties to survive. Cute.

I suspect that the culprit spoken of is S&S... which has strong wargame
overtones.

I see three problems:

One: I can no longer do single issue purchases of issues of Pyramid which
may interest me for ONE article.

two: Arrainging payment is a hassle without a credit card or checkbook. No
more dropping down to bosco\'s, flipping through, and handing over a 5-spot
if I like what I saw. (Mind you, I have NEVER purchased an issue of
Pyramid... IMO, it wasn\'t worth the money for paper verisons, and the OL
version is not enough less after I print it out to use the materials.)

three: Offest printing produces much higher quality than any of my printers
(Best currently working is an Imagewriter II [72dpi color]).

Then again, the only magazines I did buy religiously were Traveller\'s
digest, Autoduel Quarterly, and the April Editions of Dragon.

    'body' => 'B5/TBP has a simple, 2d6 task system

basics: Attribute + Skill +Specialization bonus +1d6 -1d6 vs target numbers
from 3-30. Attributes range from 1-10 in practice, with 4-8 being the
normal ranges. Skill range from 0 to 5 (system limit) and starting PC\'s
have maximum of level 4. All skills have one or more specilizations, and
having an appropriate specialization adds 2 to the total. Note that the
dice are +1d and -1d; double 6\'s and double 1\'s are special. On of the
special doubles is a boon, one a bane. THe ban is a complication, not an
autofail. the boon is also a plot factor. They reccomend a gree die and a
red die, with the green being positive and the red being negative.

So, in general, TBP\'s task system is att + skill. For T4, the range of
attributes is about 1.5 times TBP\'s, and skill levels run a little higher
(TBP: 29 "Points" total, with a point being a level or additional
specialty; for all skills the first level also grats a specialty),so I\'d
say T4 skill levels are about 1.25 times as many for characters I\'ve seen
in T4 play...  Using TBP\'s task system with T4 "as is" works, by simply
ignoring specializations...

One thing of note about TBP: all characters start with the same "29 points"
to work with, including 1 skill at level 4, and 3 at level three, each with
two specialties, then 12 points to spend on other skills. TBP assumes the
characters start an epic cycle about average, and climb in skill to meet
the story arc.

I think PST is -7 Zulu, and we\'re currently +12, so we\'re 19 
hours ahead or sumething like that. If they want to do it on

Sorry, I didn\'t mean it to sound sarcastic when I suggested your 550MW
power-plant was a typo for 1550MW. I seriously thought it was. By my
calculations you need a 1520MW plant to power a J2 drive and maintain
the J bubble and life support.

J power req = 0.018 * jump number * ships volume

= 0.018 * 2 * 42000m3 = 1512 MW

>The fuel purification plant has been removed (you\'re right Doug - it

? A fuel purification plant still allows you to save 400Cr per DT on
your fuel purchases. It is worthwhile to have as it reduces your running
costs considerably, and increases profitability.

>3xComp (CM:0.6 CP:1.67)

Upping your computer model by one level would more than make up for the
cost with the reduction in crew required, and reduced running costs,
again increasing profitability.

Sorry to be a pain but I have this thing about economical designs.

PDT is GMT-7 thus:

A friend was an *old* time wargamer. And he ordered a copy direct from
TSR as soon as it was announced. He got it in Early 74 and was informed
that he was their first sale in the NW US. He didn\'t get the
multi-sided dice for a while as they either hadn\'t been delivered or
were backordered.

I don\'t have a copy, but I\'d almost consider picking up one if it was
available *cheap*, just to show people. "Pour lighter fluid on map",
indeed!

Really? How about the force it would take to acellerate the moon to a speed
such that it can travel from one star system to another in a week\'s time, slow
down to spend days or more passing through the system, and then accelerate it
through interstellar space for the next episode?

mine showed me the game and helped me roll up a character for it. My first
game of Traveller occurred that fall, when I played in a game put on by
some members of our local gaming club at the time. Didn\'t play regularly
until 1981, when I played in a short-lived campaign that my friend Greg
ran; one of those "merchants-who-become-pirates" things. Played
sporadically after that, including running Traveller a few times myself. I
never did try to play MegaTraveller (which I am now regretting), although I
owned it. In 1993, I got into Traveller: The New Era and ran a enjoyable
campaign with that, switching to T4 when that came out. right now, I\'m not
running Traveller as such, but will be planning to revive both my TNE and
T4 games under the GURPS rules this fall.
	My first gaming experience was, of course, D&D...actually, a hybrid; the
Monster Manual and Player\'s Handbook for AD&D were out, but not the DMG, so
we just used original D&D and the Greyhawk supplement for that.
The next game I got heavily into was Champions :)

Ah, here you\'re talking about Zocchi\'s (non-role-playing) wargame
Starfleet Battles.  Or I may be remembering the boardgame Task Force
published, which was basic\'ly a reworking of the Zocchi game.  Zocchi\'s
Starfleet game was preceded by (and loosely interpreted from) a fighter
jet game which I can\'t remember the name of.  Just like the Starfleet
game, it used lots of space and string.  He demo\'d it several times at
the local Air Force base which, though I spent months there, I\'ve
forgotten the name of IT too.  (It\'s sad when a once-adequate mind

Actually, the Zocchi game was Star Fleet Battle Manual.  Great cover art
of the Federation dreadnaught USS Alliance, NCC-2113.

Got my start with D&D in \'76.  Empire of the Petal Throne &
Metamorphosis Alpha somewhere in there, & Trav in \'77.

Feh.  We had a D&D game going during OSUT at Ft. Benning in Oct 84.  DM had
the rules memorized, and sketched down stats in his Infantry Bluebook
during intsruction.. Drills thought he was taking notes.  We had a single
20-sider which was used for all rolls.

For some odd reason the majority of people in that game ended up as
Rangers...

You mean that\'s not possible?  :-^   I thought it was \'cos of all
those wormholes the  moon  kept  dropping  through  (interstellar
space must be like swiss cheese)!

Of course, you might prefer a modern accurate SF  TV-series  like
Star Trek.  Very few wormholes there ... though it does sometimes
seem like \'Star Trek: Voyager\' should be renamed ...

I\'ve heard of some kids who got permission to play it in the gym at
their school on days when it wasn\'t being used for practice. Apparently
a basketball court is just about enough room. :-)

I\'f I\'d ever finished the bases I was making out of scrap masonite, it

Yep. Though I don\'t think Murphy\'s Rules gave all of it. You see,
Tactics II had counters and scenarios for everything from bronze age to
modern... 

So the instructions for a WWIII scenario did refer to lighter fluid on
the map. After that they then went on to say that you should start over

I should let folks know that I originally wrote it back in Summer 1996 (it

I am willing to accept on faith that Suzette _might_ want to hide from

from the $4.37 in small change.  Can anyone enlighten me?

The Dashami Lashas class was the most common Vilani merchant ship plying 
the space lanes in the Solomani Rim during the Interstellar Wars. It displayed
most of the charateristics of the "classic" Ziru Sirka merchant vessel:
restricted endurance, reliance on external fuel supplies, the capacity to be
armed in emergancies, a flattened disk hull, decontamination equipment on all
access points, limited automation, low passenger capacity, and the inclusion
of a Shuligii in the chain of command.

The ship\'s only carried sufficent fuel and supplies for 21 Vilani days (4
Terran weeks) and was incapable of wilderness refueling. This was a result
of the Ziru Sikra\'s deliberate policy to restrict starships endurance, thus
limiting their abiltiy to ignore established trade routes or to travel
beyond the confines of the Ziru Sirka. As with all Vilani merchant vessels
the Dashami Lashas class was normally unarmed but was also a naval auxilary
and subject to mobilisation in times of emergancy. Thus the class was fitted
with four empty 3 Td turrets and its fusion plant produced 4.09 Mw of surplus
power. This allowed for the ship to be armed in times of emergancy. Indeed,
throughout the Interstellar Wars many Vilani escorts and patrolships were
simply armed merchants.

Unlike Vilani warships, Vilani mechant ships were traditionally given names
in the Terran fashion. The Dashimi Lashas class were most commonly named
after notable persons from Vilani history. Even after the final collapse of
the Ziru Sirka the class remained very popular. Not only did it continue to
be very popular with the Vilani, but many Terran shipping companies found it
to be a highly profitable design for well established trade routes. Captured
examples had been highly sought after items during the Interstellar Wars and
after the end of the Wars several Terran shipbuilders started production of
the class. The Sharik Giidada was the first example to be built in a Terran
yard. Named after a humanitarian Vilani Ligumii (Nurse) who had at great 
personal risk had saved 45 Terran prisoners of war during the 3rd Interstellar 
War.

    'body' => 'I have received several comments about this design study for an
ultra cheap merchant ship.
This was why I put up a design study, rather than a documented design.

I\'d like to make an "in my opinion" reply to some of the points made.
I\'m not going to quote each one because that is too many digests to go
through, so appologies if I misquote anyone.

Firstly my own comments:
	It would probably be easier to load if it was box shaped instead
	of speherical, especially with standard cargo containers.
	I think the hull is too thin, probably should be 10[29] not 0[20].
Then
	"It needs 3 computers"

This depends on what you think the computer is in Traveller.
I assume that it is a spread out set of linked control systems with
little bits of dedicated processing power for each, so losing one bit
of the system doesn\'t affect the rest. Of course if the bridge is out
of action you need to put people at each individual console which could
be difficult with a crew of 3.
Perhaps a second computer, although you should be able to have lots of
redundancy and ability to fuction with partial availability even with
just the main computer.
If anyone points a "gun" at this ship it might as well surrender, so why
bother with 3 comps to survive battle damage.
Besides, it has an addition flight comp.

	"No purification plant"

The economics are out here.
With a 0.5G drive it takes 6 hours to get to 100 dia for a running jump
(actually longer, because it cannot accelerate for the last hour whilst
the jump drive warms up. (1G is 4 hours, assuming planet size A)
This is why I felt it was a reasonable cost saving.
To get to a gas giant takes over 1 week so it does not cost in.
Besides, with only subsonic streamlining, you canot refuel there.
You could ocean refuel, but there are questions as to would high tech
governments allow it, so that leaves wilderness refuelling.
This ship is not designed for wilderness trading.

	"Only 1.08G"

Solution, boost the CG and reduce the thrusters until it can take off.
In reality, with the sort of regular freight operation this ship works,
it would be more cost effective to drop the CG and use shuttles based on
the planet (size the ship so that all the destinations add up to several
ships per day and this works). The streamlining was only an afterthought.

	"Why an AEMS"

Because it is quite cheap and it was there (ie it was on the spreadsheet
and I did not delete it).

	"Needs another 20MW to run jump and life support"

Sniff. And I spent so much time trying to get this right :-(
I thought it had enough power since all the sensors can be turned off in
jumpspace. Of course, I probably turned off the computer as well.

	"Where do you get 417 tons of cargo"

As was observed, not from the standard trade tables.
The point of my original message was that the trade tables do not apply
to real Traveller merchants using proper trade fleets.
The point of this design is to refute the arguement that Cr1,000/dt and
Cr10,000/high passage don\'t pay and must be increased - they do,
especially if the infrastructure is available to ensure that
the ships are full (>80%).
Low passage is a different problem, because the rules say it exists but
economically it does not seem to work and it tends to kill its passengers.

IMHO, PCs do not play "proper merchants", they play "merchant adventurers".
That is why they get their own set of trade tables.

Besides, if all the crew take a percentage profit instead of their usual
salary, then the free trader has a perfectly good business plan, even
with normal freight rates.
("5% of nothing is nothing, we want 10% :-)

(There is some evidence for PCs being extra risk - if the players
start with a 30 year old ship, it is not at 40% cost with 40 years
payments, its at 25% cost but with 10 years payments.
Not exactly conclusive, I grant you.)

Who is Andy Aikins? :)

Just kidding...don\'t feel bad, but my name is mispelled just about
_everywhere_.

Now, about the t-shirt...just send $19.95 plus shipping and handling to.....
:)

Ummmm...it is done :) I just can\'t release it until the game itself is
released. Plus, the actual design rules aren\'t frozen yet, according to Dave
Pulver, so I may have to change the system.

It\'s a nice system, modular in fashion but completely compatable with
Vehicles 2nd Edition. Not too shabby.

As soon as the NDA is lifted due to game release, and I get permission from
SJG (they require written permission, which is fine with me, since they
don\'t charge licencing fees if I make it free, which I will), I\'ll release
it as well.

Also, in the next day or two...for us old timers I\'ll be releasing a High
Guard spreadsheet...I was feeling nostolgic (sic), and plus I needed to
chekc on something...

> Andynus Akinus, Gearheadus Maximus

I find this amusing...becuase I don\'t place myself in the gearhead category,
actually :) To me, gearheads are those that want the most detailed design
rules so they can assemble their items...actually, that\'s not me. I like
things simple. High Guard, even with its flaws, is probably my favorite
design system. The reason I make these spreadsheets, other than to gather
worshippers for my quest for world domination, is because the new design
sequences are _HARD_ in my opinion, and I want them simple for myself. And
if I\'m going to make them for myself, I might as well share them with the
rest of you guys, since a lot of you have helped me over the years
(especially those of you who helped me rebuild my Traveller collection lost
in the flood of \'93). Since I happen to be a programmer by trade (goin on 10
years now), I write tools to make this complicated stuff simple - in my
mind, the gearheads are (and I mean this in a good way, I admire you guys)
people like Dave Golden who _designs_ these rules and such...something I
could never do...

But, if you want to canonize me, go ahead. It\'ll look good on the resume...

Ah yes, Aftermath. Or as our old game group used to call it; Role-Playing
for Accountants. I can\'t think of it without a wry smile of amusement. The
combat system of this doctoral thesis disguised as a game included a 2-page
flowchart to describe the rather convoluted phases of a combat turn.
Swords, bows, firearms, explosives, lasers, slingshots, and probably
toothpicks for all I know, had completely different combat rules. You had
fo figure things like the encumberance of each bullet differently if it was
loose or in a clip.

We had some real memorable firefights with that one. My favorite was the
time a guy took a 50 cal HEAP round from an APC right between the eyes,
said "ouch", then shot everyone inside the APC. Through the armor. With an
SMG. Then there was the time a guy fired his crossbow at an enemy but
accidently shot himself in the throat. The biggest encounter we tried to
run using the full rules was between 8 combatants. Unfortunately, it
included a slingshot and a laser rifle, so it took about 2 days of constant
play to complete.

The critical miss rules brought new meaning to the words "friendly fire".
There was a time we organized a bunch of villagers to attack a Master Rat
colony, and when we gave the order to open fire practically everyone shot
each other.

The only game I found to rival Aftermath is Paranoia.

I think you are thinking of Strategy I (SPI). Tactics II was set in the

I have made this offer before, and it still stands.

If someone on the list starts generating winmail.dat files, notify the user
and direct them to me.  I will make every effort to assist them in
correcting the condition (if I can), and prevent a repitition of the
unpleasant attitude I had to put up with while I was originally
troubleshooting _my_ winmail.dat problem.

Generally the user is not aware that they are generating the files, so
public pronouncements without _specific_ notification_ are pretty much
useless for anything but creating bad feelings.

Some (me included) might argue for this number being a factor of 3-10
larger.  Perhaps 12-15 xboats per leg.

Perhaps you are including this in that last sentance, but doesn\'t the IISS
have scout *cruisers*?  The AHL Class served for awhile in that role.  I
would assume that the AHL\'s replacement class (I don\'t know of a Canon
replacement) may have served in the Scout Cruiser role in its obselescence
as well.

Anyway, its bound to be, as you say, chump change in comarison to the
regular Navy numbers you have, even if there are 60k cruisers in large
numbers.

Ooohh, Count the mothballers too!  Good old TL14 and TL13 designs just ripe
for a few Zho lasers to chew on.

Mind if I ask how you came to this conclusion?  Back in \'The Days\', way the 
hell back before Supplement 3, a *LOT* of us refs generated our own sectors 
because we *HAD* to.  The only things in JTAS were individual world writeups.  
Some of us hacked the source materials, some of us just threw them into the 
subsector as the next stop for the party.

If you\'re talking about on a 3D map then the formula is
Square root (x^2+y^2+z^2)
That is, the square root of the sum of the x, y, and z co-ordinates squared.

On the classic traveller 2D map, count the hexes ;)

Actually, that was Star Fleet Battle Manual by Zocchi and Kurtic; Still in
print as of 2 years ago. THe "Rework" was Alien Space Battle Manual;
compatable, and definitely not ST, it was a playable game system.
Gamescience was liscenced by Franz Joseph Designs, not Paramount. After
their disaster trying to force Task Force to stop Star Fleet Battles (the
court ORDERED paramount to liscence TFG/ADB, as subliscencing was assumed
to be allowed unless expliucitely forbidden when FJD got liscened by Desilu
and GR). So, Paramount basically ignored the otyher FJD liscened game.
Latest printing I\'ve seen of SFBM includes the same disclaimer as SFB:
"Some elements are (C)1990 by Paramount Pictures Corporation, and are used
with permission."

Combining Alien Space Battle Manual with SFBM, one gets the ability to take
the "Standard Trek Ships" (Fed DD, SC, DN, CA, TT) versus  a wide variety
of opponents, in a simple and playable system. But by no means was this
system anywhere even close to roleplaying.

Depends on which sources you read... MT Sources are so stated, but some CT
sources are based upon Similar Ships of the line. (Supplement 9 makes NO
reference to auxillaries and escorts being in CruRons or BatRons, but does
mention that A BatRon can be composed of Battle Riders and their tenders.)

I will now look up Squadron in Library Data: I find no References to
Squadron, DesRon, CruRon, BatRon, or similar squadron designations. [supps
8 & 11]

Canon is a tricky thing; Supp 9 says 4-8 ships of a class in a CruRon;
FSotSI says many more ships, PLUS ESCORTS. perhaps the problem becomes one
of an obvious change of environment during/after the 5FW.

Spinward Marches Campaign gives us a look at a Battle Squadron: the 154th
Battle Rider Squadron. 1x 300KTd Carrier, carrying 200x 50Td fighters AND
7x 20KTd Battle Riders; the "Escort Division" consists of 7x 5KTd escorts.

OTU Canon is lacking in detail. Sources are not compatable as to numbers
(see my previous post for the MT numbers.

Be afraid, be very afraid

I assume that the work involved in creating your own sector is what is worrying 
you. The trick is to start small, generate a single subsector and detail one or 
two worlds; as the game progresses you detail a few more. After awhile the 
subsector will seem to take on a life of its own and it actually starts helping 
you in the work. Then after another while, you create an ajoining subsector. 
Detailing this will be easier as you already have a sketch of the region from the 
other subsector. And so on and so on and before you know it you\'ve got your 
very own referee generated sector. It is a lot of work, but it is also very 
"rewarding".

That was intended to be used with Fasa\'s Next Generation Officer\'s Manual.
The TNGOM was much better. But those two products may have cost FASA their
liscence... according to Several distributors (as quoted by First Epire
games, and in two cases, told to me directly by the distributors while I
was at FEG, as they asked to speak to the customer...) FASA was buying back
ALL STRPG products from the distributor\'s shelves due to having lost their
liscence over the TNG materials. Having hear this personally from two
distributors, and through FEG from 4 more, and having seen indicia pointing
that way in several correspondences with FASA, and having heard of the
ramifications through TFG\'s sources, I tend to giv it some creedence.

As for Prime Directive (TFG), it is a fun system, if you play it in a
ST:TOS mode of thought, crossed liberally with the mentality of the
"A-Team" [from the show of the same name].

Which brings me around to a traveller issue: The feel of a game system
directly relates to the task system and it\'s effects on realism. STRPG
suffered from a poorly deifned task system... and so the feel varied widely
from group to group. PD has a well defined task system, lending towards
fast, furious, action-packed, but unrealistically cinematic resolutions.
T4, likewise, tended towards cinematic situations. MT tended towards a more
subtle "Cinema Verite" feel... not violating easy  suspension of disbelief,
but with some problems. TNE, IMHO, lended towards gung-ho action-adventure.
Since, according to MWM himself, T4/M0 is essentially "TNE without Virus",
the relationship in feel of the profferred task systems seems to fit.
GURPS, IME & IMHO, tends towards a more gritty, slightly cienatic feel, but
definitely in the believable range, it will affect the feel of games run
under G:T.


Now, the real question for the list: How much of the "feel" of a game is
task system, how much is CGen, how much is Flavor Text/Background, and how
much is GM\'s perogative (with the acknowledgement that a Good GM with house

I, despite many years of Friendship with Peter (Incidentally, Peter & I
became acuainted due to traveller), and having many similar attitudes on
traveller, WHOLE HEARTEDLY DISAGREE on the "preserves". I\'d like to see
official sectors for the whole OTU. I think any "Preserves should be
limited to subsector sizes... if even that large.

OK, by FF&S1, a ship (assumed jump drive) needs 3 computers. One is a
operations machine, one is a maintenance machine, one is the jump machine.
The Ops and Jump machines could be Flight computer models.... but, unless
FF&S2 has changed this, the Maintenance computer cannot be, so lacking this
third computer, maintenance times are not reduced by the computer multiple.
The FF&S1 rules also imply that the Jump computer is also the back-up for
the ops computer.

And, IMTU, the FLT model for ops could\'t handle jump software, and the jump
computer being a FLT model couldn\'t handle the ops programming. Same
physical stats, different needs. The Ops FLT computer is distributed
somewhat, whereas a STD computer would be a core plus distribution. a Jump
FLT computer would be a core and distribution to the jump drive only. A
Maintenance computer requires distribution AND a core, thus eliminating a
FLT model (IMO, the FLT model is EITHER a distributed net OR a core unit.)

One thing I feel FF&S3 will need is more specialized computer types: FLT,
Maint, JMP, DATA.
IMTU, I allow these already. The Std is a COre with distribution and
multi-role configuration, resulting in massive redundancy.
FLT: as per FF&S, allows N-space operations only, and only in the primary
environments of the vehicle.
JMP: a dedicated Jump Course Processor. Same cost/Space/mass/power as a FLT
computer.
Data/Library: A dedicated data processing unit. Primarily a core-based
system, with smart terminals. Sorta like most current UNIX Miniframe
systems. Multi-station Multi-user capable. Not wired into ship systems....
Cost/Power same as FLT models, space and wieght DOUBLE that of FLT models.
Maint: Half cost/mass/space, same power as a STD model.
Smart Station: Same space/mass/power as a FLT model. Asset = 3x Model
Number in primary skill, asset 2x Model Number in 3 related skills. Extra
skills can be bought at asset 1x model number for 10% of unit cost, 2x
asset at 50% of unit cost. Cost as per STD model. Mass/Space: as per FLT
model. Power 2x FLT model.

I ran a very interesting and satisfying campaign using the Fantasy Trip
rules. I acually bought GURPS later, hoping it would be an expanded game
along those lines. In a way it is, but much too rules heavy it the GM lets
it be.

WARNING Funny Role-Playing story,

A friend of one of the members of our play group decided to sit in on one of
the FT games. His primary previous experience was with D&D. Now the Fantasy
Trip games I ran had a more rapier and dagger flare than the armour heavey
D&D he was used too, but he insisted that he wanted a full suit of plate
armour.

Later in the game the party found them selves in a running battle with a
small group od ork guards. Needles to say as all of the unarmored PC\'s were
in fast pursuit of the orks this poor guy was turning purple trying to catch
up! After a couple of turns he alternated dropping off pieces of armour and
running to catch up! By the time he finally caught up to the party he was
down to his skivvies, out of breath, and all of the mosters were dispatched,
the rest of the party was sitting around cleaning their weapons and counting
"retrieved" loot!

His next question was whither there was someplace he could sell or trade his
armour and bastard sword for a rapier, brace of daggers and some leather.

Assuming this thing has the spare surface area, you could take the power
plant up to 600 MW (extra MCr 10, 50m3, 200t), increase the jump drive to
jump 2 (140m3,MCr42, 420t) and put in an extra jump worth of fuel
(1400m3,100t).

Cargo falls to 485 dtons, cost increases by MCr 39 to MCr 209 or so and
maneuver performance stays about the same (mass has actually fallen by 680t).

The doubling in jump capability takes it up to Ziru Sirkaa Fleet Standard,
and roughly halves the time it takes to get to worlds more than one parsec
apart.

If you use the local currency rules in Striker, TLB Starport A credits
trade at 0.5 to the Imperial Credit, taking the sticker cost of the jump-2
version down to MCr 104.5 in TL15 Imperial Credits. The jump-1 version
would cost IMCr 85. Incidentally, either design could easily be built at
Porozolo (Spinward Marches 2715) or Gram (SM 1223).

I\'d say these things should be all over the Marches, in the process driving
down freight rates to well under ICr 1000 per displacement ton.

Computers are a bit funny in Traveller. Careful looking at Bruce\'s sensor
rules indicate that quite a bit of \'sensor\' volume and mass is actually
back-end computer processing, which could be one explaination for the crash
in computer costs vis a vis High Guard etc. A TL11 CM 0.5/CP 2 computer
only costs about KCr 70, so it really doesnt add much to total system cost
to put in two redundant computers, just in case one goes out of warranty at
an inopportune time.

Ditto.

IMO AEMS arent cheap - the smallest possible TL14 AEMS still costs KCr 250,
which is signifigant. The smallest TL12 AEMS costs MCr 1.25, which means an
extra KCr 5 per monthly payment - enough for quite a retirement fund when
added up over a 40 year operating life.

20 MW of power isnt a huge deal economically. Power tends to cost MCr 0.1
per megawatt at TL8, and gets rapidly cheaper after TL12.

Yeah, and all that bulky freezing equipment takes up space that could be
used for two-to-a-bunk fourth class passengers.

As far as I can see, there are no limits to the amount of speculative cargo
you can buy, and that is where the real money is anyway.

Does anyone want to help me write a \'Merchant Venturer\' campaign set, based
in the post- Fifth Frontier War Spinward Marches ?

I am thinking having the players in charge of a Recollet or similar
high-jump freighter, and have a series of linked adventures. I like the
idea of a trade expidition to the Islands Clusters myself (think of the
profit margin in exporting TL15 military gear there ...).

Salaries arent the dominant cost for a Traveller merchant ship - 5 crew at
KCr 5 a month each is KCr 300 a year, while 4% interest on a MCr 50 ship
loan is KCr 2000 a year.

I\'d say crews working on a percentage of audited profits is actually more
normal than the \'vanilla\' Traveller financing package. A 90/10 split
between the financiers and the crew sounds about right for me.

Its quite doable, you only have to bump the power plant to 504 Mw, and it pays 
to push the computer up one level (otherwise you need two extra engineers) 
and the cargo only drops to 489 Td, cost goes to MCr 206 (assuming a 25% 
discount). But the ship ceases to make a profit even at 100% capacity. 
However it would make a good subsidised merchant.

If you use the local currency rules and assume that all freight is paid for in ICr, 
then the jump 2 version can run at a profit at 80% (even without the 25% class 
discount I pumped into the design).

The design was intended as a Vilani design from the Interstellar Wars era, but I 
think it will make economic sense in any milieu. I think this is one of my more 
useful ships :*>.

So what\'s the eventual disposition of the materials if they can\'t get a

This reminds me of an interesting point brought up in a book I was
reading today. 

The hereo is going thru pilot training and the class is told that they
are going to have to use hard copy manuals for working on ship\'s
systems. One of the trainees asks why. 

	"Think about it, Lieutenant. How can you figure out how to
repair the power system if the information you need can only be
accessed thru a system powered by the ship and you don\'t have power,
which was the problem to begin with?"

	"Oh..."

The Type 1 Galamlur (offensive patrolship, usually translated as attack
cruiser) stands apart from virtually all other Vilani designs of the
Interstellar Wars era. Also known as the Dingir class, it was designed as an
emulation of the Terran Ships of the Line at the behest of the remarkable
Diikagkarunii (Provincial Governor) Sharik Yangila. The design itself was an
interesting combination of Terran and Vilani design philosophies. The most
striking features were the spinal particle accelerator (a weapon found on no
other Vilani design), and the extended endurance (13 Terran weeks as against
the Vilani standard of 4 weeks) and use of a fully closed loop life support
system (copied from ancient pre-jump Vilani sublight designs). All of these
features were inspired by the Terran Ships of the Line, while the class still
retained the classic blocky rounded hull form, the lower level of automation
(forced by the nature of the Vilani caste system), the substanial missile
battery (though much lighter than traditional Vilani designs), and the
extensive ECM suite. Unusally for Vilani warships, the members of the class
were assigned individual names following the Terran pattern, taking their
names from Vilani worlds in the Kushuggi (Solomani Rim) sector.

Though the class represented a very interesting experiment, it was not a
fully "mature" design, having several weaknesses (the poor sandcaster
battery, relatively low powered spinal mount, the use of muliple low powered
lasers linked into "batteries" etc). Many later naval architects have
speculated on the likely evolution of the type had the Vilani perserved with
its development. However the type fell out of favour with the downfall of
Sharik Yangila during the 4th Interstellar War and further development was
abandoned (though two Type 1a prototypes were built). However the Type 1
continued to be produced in limited numbers and examples served with the
Kushuggi provincial fleet until its final defeat during the 9th War.

Absolutely nothing. In fact, on Undernet, #Traveller is always there 
because it is a registered channel. Of course, unless one of the 
designated ops is around, no one will have ops, but that shouldn\'t be too 
much of a problem.

I\'d love to see the channel used more. Just be forewarned... if you don\'t 
\'advertise\', you will have to have a great deal of patience before people 
start dropping by regularly. Once upon a time when the Small Change 
was less demanding, I practically lived there and people dropped in a lot.

"The military is also interested. They are studying MEMS called 
"surveillance dust", which can be sprayed over a battlefield. This dust,
which will hover in the air for hours, can be equipped with infra-red

locate enemy positions." p270

Make the fog of war vanish with a little cloud of your own, hmm?

MEMS are already a US$2.2billion industry. The "surveillance
dust" above is technically possible today, though too expensive for
use.

Four incredibly well written starships, that were mangled by IG.

Now that my plug is in..

The bulk of the book is a re-wrtiting of the Fifth Frontier War combat
rules to work with Pocket Empires.  Essays about naval organization,
playing naval characters, etc.

I give it a 7 out of 10.

For example, a sector may have humans who fled the Interstellar Wars, took

colonization, conflict within the sector. The current date is just about

I mean that it was scary that someone needed GDW to preserve sectors (the

Most of my campaign takes place in the Andromeda Galaxy and there is
no such thing as the Imperium.

I only use the Imperium when I feel lazy.

I think its scary because I find it bad to depend on the RPG industry for
supplements to be able to play game.

Well, we have the official numbering at any rate.  T4.1 is dead, Long live

This would be a good product.  I could see it as a boxed set that includes
a "FFS" world builders handbook, and software to handle most of the numbers
crunching.

I\'ve long been an advocate of the smaller campaign, a subsector or two at
most.  I like the greater detail of worlds and populations, rather than
having the planet as a stepping stone effect you get with Imperium spanning
campaigns.

Marc,

Can you give us an update on T5?

You don\'t have to give away any Imperial secrets or anything.  I\'m just curious
what your thoughts are about the direction on the new game.  I\'d like to know
things about ideas for products, milieu it will be set in, if you\'ve found a
suitable publisher, when you expect it to be coming out...basically, any news that
you would like to share with us.

Thanks,

Ah, I guess it reassuring to know that IG stuff people about without prejudice. 
IG have single handedly done more damage to the game than CCG, the demise 
of GDW and the march of time put together. Mayhap a crack assault team of 
lesbian Aslan pirates should be arranged :*>

I just received LOM yesterday, and decided to pull out everything I had on
the Reavers Deep.  It turns out there was quite a bit published.  

In the adventure "Escape" by JAK, published by Seeker, at the end it says
to "Look for the next adventure folio in this campaign: Rendezvous With
Danger."  In looking at the list above I did not see it listed.  

Since it already had a title, the proposal had probably already been
written, so I am wondering, was this adventure lost, or does JAK still have
some more stuff sitting around that he didn\'t sell to Paul.

Just wondering (i.e. hoping) if there might be more Keith stuff around.

    'body' => 'UAP is a small Fledgeling line mentioned in Merchant Prince. Formed as a
partnership between five free traders, it concentrates on routes between
Efate and Regina.

The line is somewhat unusual, as it\'s fleet consists solely of jump-1 and
jump-3 ships - two TL11 Sharik Gidaada class and three TL12 Recollets. This
being so close to the Vargr frontier, all ships are armed, usually with a
mixture of missiles and lasers.

Two of the Recollets, the Ditzammer and Winifreda, were built in the
General Products yards on Regina in the last twenty years, while the Sharik
Gidaadas were both built three decades ago at Adabicci in Lunion subsector.
The third Recollet, the Hengabar, is somewhat old in the tooth and hails
from somewhere in Core - it\'s records are somewhat blurred on this point.

The line currently serves seven worlds in the Regina subsector - Efate,
Uakye, Alell, Roup, Ruie, Regina and Jenghe. Somewhat surprisingly the line
concentrates on two of the less developed worlds in the subsector - Ruie
and Roup.

The line has entered into a favourable trade agreement the the government
of Roup, and this is proving beneficial for both parties - UTP is gaining a
secure base of operations, while Roup is gaining access to regularily
scheduled freight services, leading to valuable hard-currency earnings.
 
The corporation has access to a sizable ex-military facility on Roup,
mostly empty at this time, and UTP personell carry special passports that
identify them to the authorities on Roup and exempt them from many local laws.

Negotiations are ongoing with several of the smaller governments on Ruie
for a similar arrangement.

The Sharik Gidaada \'Princess of Ruie\' conducts a regular scheduled circuit
of Ruie-Regina-Ruie-Jenghe-Ruie, while the Michat Forbolden travels
Alell-Efate-Uakye-Efate-Alell.

The Ditzammer is active between Roup and Ruie, while the Winifreda travels
between Alell and Regina via Roup. These ships trade places when
maintainence is due, allowing only a minor disruption in schedules.

The Hengabar is being refitted as an express passenger ship, travelling
between Regina and Efate, with a brief stop for refuelling at one of the
four gas giants in the Knorbes system. It is hoped that this service will
provide a level of competition on this route with more established carriers
- - indeed, the vagaries of jumpspace may at some point allow UTP to access a
brief window of being the sole owner of important news from the subsector
capital to the subsector\'s main world, or vice versa.

UTP is carving itself a niche market in low-technology industrial goods -
it has placed a number of orders for small fission power plants with
industrial concerns on Roup, and it is aggressivly recruiting a sales staff
to sell these 2 dton/12 MW plants to belters throughout the subsector as
cheap, rugged, reliable, emergency power backups.

The companies plans include solidifying it\'s political position on Ruie,
and expanding out towards Enope, Louzy and perhaps Extolay.

Currently, it employs a small staff of between three and twelve people on
each world it services, and has contracts with General Shipyards on Regina
and Uakye F\'therizili for maintainence of it\'s fleet.

Financially, the company is attempting to absorb the consolidation of the
debt on four of it\'s five ships. It\'s routes are surprisingly profitable,
and within three years the company should have the choice between buying
several used ships, investing directly in it\'s suppliers on Roup and Ruie
or diversifying into asteroid prospecting in the mostly-untapped belts of
Roup.

****************************************************************************
*********

Thats the overview. Next instalment is going to go into more detail on the
personell of UTP, their facilities and even a copy of their balance sheet.

Incidentally, I didnt plan on the company focussing on Ruie and Roup, but
they turned out to be remarkably profitable - you can even make a small
amount shipping goods away from them to higher tech worlds, although the
real profits are with imports. This is a problem in the long term, unless
goods are exported to balance this, which is the case in this case.

Incidentally, Roup appears to be Amber Zoned ... I\'m not sure why. Could be
something to do with the fact it\'s a water world with government A and law
level 9. Ruie is an Amber Zone, balkanised and also TL7 ... something tells
me UTP is shipping sonars and TL7 naval goods in general to Ruie from Roup.
I\'m not sure whats coming the other way.

Well, if it wasn\'t William, it must have been Andrew, eh? ;->

I just finished LoM, and I\'m going to have to read it again.  I\'m not
running a pirate/privateer/corsair campaign at the moment...never know

though I\'m not, there\'s still a lot of *very* useful material in there.

Ok, after a whirlwind visit to Rome, Paris (I missed the party), and
London, I\'m back home for the next six-months or so.

****

NEW RELEASES

I hesitate to make this announcement so soon - seeing that at least 1/2 the
people who bought LOM are still waiting for their copies to arrive in their
mailboxes...but what the heck - I\'m bored and ready to get started. (With
temps hitting 117f I am \'housebound\', and can only stand so much swimming
in the pool.)

Marc has given me permission to release limited-TML printings of the other
four Andrew Keith supplements. I\'d like to get them all \'out\' by Christmas
if possible. I\'m inclined to release "Starport Planetfall" next, but
thought I\'d ask for a show of hands...

So - which shall it be?

"Starport Planetfall" 

"Faldor - World of Adventure"

"Scam" (Rouges in Space II)

"Artic Environment" (I\'m working to include the \'missing\' material from
"Ordeal by Eshaar" as an insert - 1/3 of the original manuscript was cut
from the final product - so keep your fingers crossed.)

I\'ll wait one week for feedback (please send your vote to me at
timmon@primenet.com), and then post an announcement as too the results.

****

COST

Below is a breakdown of costs per supplement, and shows why I\'ll need to
charge $20 for each supplement from now on. To make up for the increase in
cost, Andrew has agreed to autograph copies for those who want it, which
for LOM was well over 1/2 the copies sold.

$ 400 (Marc - $100 cash, and $300 in goods - i.e. the cost to produce his
20 	copies)
$ 600 (Andrew - per manuscript)
$1100 (Printer - 150 copies - only 120 of which are available to sell, 20
     	are reserved for Marc, and 10 reserved for people who contribute to 
	the production)
$ 250 (Postage and envelopes)
$  50 (Misc.)
- ----
$2400 Total 

120 copies x $20 = $2400 (Cost will be the same for all orders - Domestic
and Foreign)

****

CONTEST

Since things are pretty dead on the list at the moment, I thought I\'d try
and liven things up by launching a mini contest...

For those wishing to enter, please send me one or both of the following:
 
* A *detailed* NPC to be found at or around a starport (with fully-fleshed
out text descriptions rather than just stats).  

* A small starship with a *specific purpose* (again, stats are ok, but I\'m 
more interested in detailed text descriptions, and those with deckplans are
even better). 

Entries similar to the old White Dwarf articles "Three of a Kind" and
"Bounty Hunter" are what I am looking for.

I\'ll pick the five best entries and include them in the insert for
"Starport Planetfall". 

The five winners will receive a free copy of "Starport Planetfall" AND one
of the other supplements to be chosen by the winners.

Either email me your entries at: timmon@primenet.com -or- send \'em
snail-mail to: Paul Sanders, 1316 W. 2nd Ave., Apache Junction, AZ 85220 USA.

As for a contest deadline...how about mid-Sept.

****

LOM

Rather than answering the numerous inquires individually...

I don\'t have any copies of LOM left/for sale - please contact either Marc
Miller, or see if anyone on the TML has an extra copy for sale - I know one
individual bought five copies to specifically have \'spares\' on hand for
those who missed out.

Many thanks for all the positive feedback sent privately - Mark, they
really liked your work in the insert (yes - it\'s a plug - and he deserves
every bit of it).


Ok, I\'ve rambled on quite enough :)

 Several places exist to do this on the M:1100 maps of Known Space. While I
would be partial to a pocket state contacted by the Zhodani about 1000 LY
towards the galactic Core (hey, where the Ancients went so went Humaniti in
some form...) there is also lots of room in the wilds beyond the Vargr
extents, the far spinward rift-edge zone beyond The Beyond (and sweeping
coreward into Zhodani-explored space, where my current game is), and out
rimward of the Solomani and Hivers. LOTS of room.

 With the simple act of placing a moon-carrying gas giant in the habitable
zone of a star, you can build single systems that could keep a group busy for
weeks or months. Just think: a campaign where the characters would be ecstatic
over the acquisition of a Modular Cutter, instead of needing 800 dtons of
electric death just to jump around in...
