Good thing you put that in quotes.  It completely destroys the

  This is proof that no one has ever had the thought of winning
mail contracts by providing a fast service on a small hull? Or
that no such business exists in the Imperium?

  I also seem to recall the theory that no merchant would want
to use any service other than the X-Boat system due to security
and/or privacy concerns.

I\'m sure that the description in the book and film is closer to:

	A motion detector + IR + simple AI control

(that AI as in the sort of AI we have in the real world now, not TL16)

If a person was controlling something with a visual sensor, then lying
very still would not be a good defence measure.

  What proportion of small traders are that fast? Even if economic
J-3+ free traders are relatively common (unlikely by most T* design
systems that I\'m aware of) their trade/movement patterns should be
a random walk over time (within the constraints of the structure of
the region that they\'re in); a consistent run from an administrative
center (for those who feel that internal security concerns will be
deliberately compromised by total compartmentalization of such functions;
strange IMHO, but it could happen) would be a tip off which traffic records
could give an insight into the likelihood of its\' occurring naturally.

David, mate. Commercial starships are in port for at least 24 hours.
Therefore, you would have a record on the Commercial Starship Register
unless you

(1) had a higher jump than the highest normal shipping
(2) hung out at a series of low-traffic ports, or
(3) fueled up and went everywhere you went

In this case, I think the authorities would be interested in you.

You check the cargo against the manifest.

You politely ask the captain where they have been, checking it up with a
couple of basic questions.

If everything matches, then you say \'have a nice day\' and file your report.

If they dont, you ask them about their future travel plans. You send a
message ahead to all ports in range, and ask them to keep an eye on ship x.
If you are feeling really nasty, you make the offer to hire them to carry
cargo x from the starport to a naval base 4 parsecs thataway. The courtesy
detail of two marines to keep an eye on the cargo is a, well, courtesy
detail (hey, thats a really nasty job for ship-less PCs ... riding shotgun
on 40 dtons of guff on board a probable pirate/smuggler).

If ship x never shows up, then you put out an all-ports bulletin.

Yep. Nothing beats an actual witness. And travel times count against
criminals too ... the fastest you can get a message to your confederates to
get at witness x is the fastest ship going there.

I disagree.  But that\'s just my opinion.  :-)

The bottom line for me is, I\'m playing a game to have fun, and to allow my
players to have fun. If having fun means "starships and sixguns" then so be it.

I\'m glad you have fun playing in your style..

When I started playing Traveller in the Spinward Marches back in *gasp* 1979, I
think most people saw it as being that way.  IMHO, as more and more was
published, the tone of the background changed.  As much as I love the DGP stuff
for its artwork and content, I also feel the had a big hand in changing the
atmosphere of the game.  To me, the Trojan Reach sector was a little explored
area of space (based on my reading of adventure #? Leviathan).  The Domain of
Deneb sector data changes the whole aspect.

I\'m happy playing in my militarized frontier sector, with it\'s four TL 15
worlds, and average tech of 7.5 or so.  This doesn\'t mean I devalue anyone
elses version.  It\'s just that I prefer mine.

And how much got through ?

That was also a damned expensive operation that no _Customs_
organization could have afforded, the equivalent of an INS battle
fleet being put on customs duty.

And only INS would be able to get away with it in Traveller, as the
starship and starport itself is extra-territorial to the customs
authority, in most cases, they only get to inspect what leaves the
starport

And you\'re thinking 1980\'s tech. Anything like that is so easy to
crack or fool, no sane Customs authority would ever trust it.

Of course, if you\'re one of those that believes ship transponders
can\'t be hacked....

Also, no Merchant is _required_ to carry any of these devices, and
not  all civilisations you are trading with would even have the
technology to read such things anyway.

If the players are providing the containers, what happens when they accept a load already in standard containers?  They gotta leave *theirs* behind cause there\'s no room.  A 3 dt \'can\' takes up the same volume empty or full.

The AK 100 has a permanent place in the history of the Terran Free Traders.
First designed for the European Union during the 1st Interstellar War, the
AK 100 was envisioned as a cheap reliable utility freighter for rear area
duties and was produced in quantity by several of Earths power blocs. The
AK 100 performed adequately in this role and nearly two hundred examples 
were produced during the war. With the end of the war, the AK 100 was quickly
replaced by more capable designs in Naval service and surplus AK 100\'s were
placed on the disposal lists. These surplus ships proved to be very popular
with the many fledgling Free Traders and quickly became one of the vessel of
choice for many of them. In 2121 AD the legendary Terran industrialist Yukio
Hasagua set up the Free Trade Foundation to foster the development of the
Free Traders and the FTF reopened production of the AK 100 and made them
available at heavily subsidised prices. Production of the AK 100 was to
continue until 2146 AD, when it was replaced by the much improved AK 111.
None the less, they remained a staple of the Free Traders until late in the
Interstellar Wars.

The AK 100\'s were an extremely simple design with few comforts for 
passengers or crew. They were fitted with a primitive contragrav drive to enable 
them to reach orbit and a simple fusion drive to push them out to a safe jump
distance. They were crampt and had no gravitic compensation (entailing long
periods in freefall). However they were also exceptionally rugged and
reliable, with many examples remaining in service for over 100 years (at
least four survived into the Long Night). Most Free Traders removed the point
defense laser (only suitable to provide emergancy defence whilst the ship
jumped) and used the turret to stow additional cargo. The AK 100 carried an
integral fuel bladder which enabled them to carry sufficent fuel for two
consecutive jumps (the bladders took up 9 Td of cargo space when inflated).

It was an AK 100 (the Kobe Maru) which sparked the 3rd Interstellar War in
2146 AD. The Kobe Maru was engaged in \'speculative trade\' (smuggling) to the
Vegan world of Tyudhuar when it was challenged by two Vilani Gadni type 56m
Escorts. The Kobe Maru brought herself to a dead stop, apparently awaiting
bording by one of the Escorts. As the first escort approched to dock, the
Kobe Maru fired her fusion drive at a range of under 2km, destroying the
Escort and then jumped out of the system. The Vilani Diikagkarunii claimed
that the Kobe Maru had been engaged in a covert operation to provide support
to Vegan dissidents and used the incident as a pretext to launch and invasion
of the Terran Confederation. The Kobe Maru herself was never heard from again
and is presumed to have been lost due to a misjump.

Isn\'t that what \'teleportation\' is supposed to be - transforming matter
into energy (thereby destroying it) and transform it back on another place?
(Not psionic teleportation, IMTU)

Or would you rather like to make a copy from the original, especially
with viruses?

But neither do I want to make a test pilot for this - even when it\'s
considered fully functional ....

If you use a short range fire control, does the factor get above 0 ?

Go down yes, but will it come back up?  With Russians, that\'s not always a

Or, in the original Arabic:

"La la\'aba ila\' al-musaafir, wa al-haaris al-\'aalii risaalat al-la\'aba."

(Literal translation:  "There is no Game but Traveller, and High Guard
is the message of the Game."  I chose this rephrasing to replicate more
closely the Arabic of the Isalamic declaration of faith.)

(Note:  the \' symbol is used to represent both the letter "ain" and the
glottal stop.)

        Hi, Eppu!

        IMCTU, I have always presumed that missiles were built like an
active-homing version of the WW2 ASW "Hegehog" system...  dump enough
munitons into a probability area and you will damage *something*.  Hence why
with High Guard, more missiles is more basic USP.  In Traveller, the
accuracy of the probability area is degraded by distance and improved by
computer programs like "Predict" and the seeker tips on the missiles themselves.
        Given in current military concepts, if it costs a million dollars
(guess cost on a Harpoon) to reduce a $300 million destroyer or light
cruiser to scrap, then you *want* that million-dollar missile.  Lets say
going with a cheaper sensor pack in the snoot knocks the cost down to
$100,000 each, but you are less likely to get a kill (and therefore more
likley to get drubbed yourself, with resulting costs).  I\'d argue the
million-dollar missile is cheaper than repairing your ship and replacing
lost crew even if you do kill the other ship.
        Also, in the CT equipment rules, look at how the cost of
communicators goes....  TL 5, Continental Range (5000km) is 300kg & Cr15000.
At TL 12, same range for 1Kg and Cr5000.  So what is a emmisons-seeker tip
that goes active at 10Mm for terminal really gonna cost?  Not Much, compared
to the "kill" cost of the target vessel.

I\'ve played only a few other games (GURPS, Champions, Shadowrun, AD&D,

the adventure (makes sense - unless you\'re studying to improve or learn a skill, 
in which case see the GURPS rules), and then there was always a chance that 
you "didn\'t get it."

This also made it more difficult for characters to have outrageous skill levels

logical to me.

I will be running GT soon, and will probably dish out EP as some hybrid of 
these systems.

Absolutely.  The whole system is set up on the assumption that traders
are law abiding citizens making a buck by moving legal products through
legal means.  If you take that away, then you HAVE to have a system for
checking/monitoring all the cargoes, or at least a portion until the
inspector has a feel for whether or not there is contraband.

Of course there are lots of ways around all this stuff.  Always will
be.  It\'s sophant nature.  Even the Zho\'s I\'d say.

  This is proof that no one has ever had the thought of winning
mail contracts by providing a fast service on a small hull? Or
that no such business exists in the Imperium?
******************8
The people who start them tend to have \'accidents\'...such as blundering
into Imperial Navy \'Live Fire Exercises\'.......There is a reason the
X-Boats are only jump 4 (IMTU of course).


  I also seem to recall the theory that no merchant would want
to use any service other than the X-Boat system due to security
and/or privacy concerns.
******************
Nah, its the other way around...no merchants *want* to use the X-Boat
system due to security
and/or privacy concerns.  Of course the Imperium reads the mail, and they
only accept non encrypted data to make it easier for them.

I beg to differ.
Whilst you could teleport an assault squad into the bridge who could
shoot half the people their and destroy their consoles, and then
teleport them safely back 1/32nd of a second later...

I\'m sure that anti-matter bombs had to be teleported at least 10,000km in
front of the ship.

(probably play balance or something).

However you have to remember that you could put a large thermonuclear
device into a shuttle which could be landed into a shuttle bay and then
explode (inside the shields) for only 18 points (minor damage to a cruiser).

Gotta love those level 5 confinement fields :-)

From my system, loosely based on MT, with some T2K, and other home rules,
but roughly twice the damage.

I needed more scale.  When all the pistols do 2D, I had a problem.

For example:
The body pistol does 2 dice damage, the revolver does 3, Magnum does 4, Snub
Pistol with HE does 6, etc. . .

I also include Armor Pen values, so that even light armor can save you.

  A worthy objective; I felt that Striker with some JTAS upgrades achieved
this, and I\'ve been told that MT managed to do so as well.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Agreed!

My problem is that I wanted to separate the physical stats from the damage.
(they are used to figure the hit points, but that is it) It is hard for some
players to understand what it means to loose your STR, but if you tell them
that your hand has just been blown off, you are loosing lots of blood, and
going into shock, they understand.

Just using the stats is a little too sterile for me, it did not convey the
horror and fear that _combat_ has.

        Hi, Bob!
        Question for you?  How does this work with Aliens and potentially
different physiology?  I am specifically thinking about CT:Double Adventure
5 - The Chamax Plague.  The Chamax required one solid hit of 12+ damage for
their acid sacs to rupture, destroying the creature.  All the other organs
were covered by a "soft spongy tissue" that basically mean that anything
other than a puncture to the acid sac was a no-effect.  I am curious how you
would handle that.  Admittedly, it is an extreme case, but it does
high-light a problem with damage multiplier tables presuming human physiology.

I\'ve got *weird* gearhead tendencies.  I\'m building Longbow.

To be more precise, I\'ve been modeling it with Bruce Alan Macintosh\'s
Definitive Sensor Rules and some physics.  As defined, Longbow is a
passive EMS interferometer with an effective diameter of about eighty
terameters.  Compare this to the orbit of Pluto, which is only about
twelve terameters in diameter.  The Longbow array is three light-days
across!

I\'ve checked the resolution numbers given that diameter.  At a range
of 1500 parsecs, it\'s seven meters in 10 micron IR, and 40 centimeters
in 550 nanometer visible light.  At a radio frequency of 900 MHz, I
think resolution is 235 kilometers. 

The big question is sensitivity.  1500 parsecs is nearly range 22.
The rules limit tech-14 sensors to a sensitivity of 16; you can\'t
build it much better anyway since a sensitivity-16 science sensor
is going to cost TCr 5.  (Bruce, is there a technical reason for
the DSR sensitivity limitiation, or is the limit there just because
more sensitive sensors are so darn *expensive*?)

In IR, Longbow can easily work up +2 in modifiers.  A target ship
that\'s surprised and running active loses another +2.  Under these
conditions, a ship accelerating at 3G with a 10000 MW power plant
and no masking is just detectable, assuming no other modifiers. 
 
I\'d like to make Longbow sensitivity-16.5 to give it better odds;
in fact, I\'d like to make it sensitivity-17, but I\'m sceptical 
that the Imperium could hide that much money in a secret project.

Wouldn\'t that take a day and a half to get your readings?  What are you using for

well, you should get some sort of bonus for staring for a day and a half before
the ends of your array report in.  But my question is: At 1500 parsecs away,
you\'re looking at stuff from 5-6000 years ago... was there really any 3G/10000 MW
ships 1500 parsecs away 6K years ago?  and if there were, why should you care?

BEGIN_SOAPBOX_MODE

Man, this is exactly the kind of round I *don\'t* want to see civilian
LEOs carrying.  Considering how hard it already is to discriminate
between police and military, and given their generally poor firearm
skills (see a recent Washington Post article about DC Metro cops,
their Glock 19s, and the appalling number of accidental discharges
resulting in injury or death over the past 8 years.)  Frankly, giving
a police officer a round that will (to quote Danny Vermin) "shoot
through schools" without guaranteeing a commensurate level of training
smacks of wanton disregard for civilian life and property.

END_SOAPBOX_MODE

ObTrav: What would the LEO equivalent of this be in the 3rd Imperium?
We already have gauss and HiVel rounds against a variety of body armor
types.  What would the police/military use to defeat body armor? 7mm
gauss needles with explosive heads?  Slug guns throwing mico HEAP/HESH
warheads?  How about a micro-missile with mmWave radar and an onboard
AI that specifically targets the soft parts (armor joints or unshielded
parts of the body)?

Boy, and HCI thinks things are dangerous *now*!  Science marches on! :^)

The trend was already well underway by then. Many writers had (lazily)
used what they knew as background - so we ended up with the USA-in-space.
(With a bit of Europe-in-space from the few non-American writers.) 

My personal \'breakpoint\' was the Ministry of Justice article in
JTAS/Challenge, which dictated one agent per 100,000 citizens. That,
combined with the Imperial Law article (which stuck very closely to the
American legal system) was when my campaign started to break with canon.
I\'ve always held that canon shifted from under me and I just held firm :-)

Beverly Cleary, author of children\'s books, such the Ramona and Henry

the 4th grade.  Actually, I haven\'t _read_ it SINCE the fourth grade,

        Hi, Bob!
        Question for you?  How does this work with Aliens and potentially
different physiology?  I am specifically thinking about CT:Double Adventure
5 - The Chamax Plague.  The Chamax required one solid hit of 12+ damage for
their acid sacs to rupture, destroying the creature.  All the other organs
were covered by a "soft spongy tissue" that basically mean that anything
other than a puncture to the acid sac was a no-effect.  I am curious how you
would handle that.  Admittedly, it is an extreme case, but it does
high-light a problem with damage multiplier tables presuming human
physiology.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Good question!

Having played the Chanax Plague, it is an easy answer.  For that case I used
the same rule.. 12 (I changed it to about 16 points) and poof!  That made it
really simple.  I still remember watching the PC\'s drop the SMG\'s that did 3
dice, an average of about 10 points, and pick up the riot gun, 7 dice (!)
really fast.    :)

Most of the other races have a physiology that is at least a close match for
the human..  upright, bipedal, two eyes, mouth, nose, etc.  Where I ran into
trouble was with the k\'Kree, Dolphins, Vegans (hands and face)  and of
course, my favorite, the Hivers.  For most of them I did not have to worry,
I role-played the effects on the NPCs.  (In other words, I had the players
roll, and fudged the rest behind my screen, telling them what was hit) When
the players started to run a group with dolphins and Hivers, I had to do
some research, and come up with a hit location/damage chart for them.  If I
remember correctly both were simple charts, but with the dolphin it really
shows the danger of packing a lot into a small area.  It is _hard_ to miss a
vital area!   And the chance of hitting a fin or tail is really low.  We
also had to come up with some rules for the Waldos.  I did have one PC that
lost her dorsal fin to a Snub pistol HE round.  Ouch.   She was so angry
that she ended up ramming the poor bloke that fired the shot (she was in a
TL 15, Grav Waldo, doing about 60kmh at the time), double ouch.  Water
leaking out from a few holes, etc.  It was a real mess.

I guess what I am saying is that the charts are not as easy as letting the
stats fall, but are more interesting for me in letting the players know what
type of damage they are taking.  For other races I had to do more work, and
that did increase the paper sitting around the table some what, but it is
worth it to watch a PC loose her cool over losing the top half of her fin.
She was really pissed!  That reaction would not have happened if she only
had to take 10 points from her STR.

In that case, we may have the opposite problem: armour is too

protection from non-surface spinal PAW hits (else, why have meson

This sounds a lot like the German Antipodal (sp) bomber that was supposed
to launch from Germany, skip across the atmosphere, bomb New York, and then
complete the orbit and return to Germany.

I for one never saw the 3I as the USA in space.  If anything, I tended to
model mine along the lines of Victorian England or earlier colonial eras.

An interesting way of looking at it.  Alot of the articles from JTAS I took
with a grain of salt.  Same goes for Challenge.

My turning point was with MT.  Something about all those CT ships written up
as TL15 designs turned me off.

        Good point.  However, in this case, it\'s rather like most things...

        Here in Halifax, even the tramp costals are hauling container.  You
can tell the tramps from the scheduleds because they all have self-unloading
capability;  derricks and cranes for off-loading the containers.

        This is a StarShip economics question.  The problem is that the
basic "I am just hauling containers" rules are broken...  a TL-15 sub
merchant can\'t pay the bills required to run it...  Presuming full cargo
holds every trip, 75/25 split between high and mid passengers, rigged for
mail, full low berths and properly crewed, after annual maintaince makes
less than MCr1.0 per year.  In perspective, that is less than 3 payments, or
say, a 1% return on investment.
        If we premise that the Big Boys are the only ones hauling containers
and the side-show traffic is handling break-bulk, then I\'d say the cost of
the "Smart Container" is written into the 1KCr/ton fee (move enough of them
and ignore the small dent).  For the side-show guys, its just a bit more fat
on the bottom line doing break-bulk.
        IMTU, I say that if it is going out-system, then its containerized
(except for special items, like ATVs, which are RO-RO).  Container traffic
runs Cr2500Cr per ton per jump.  Containers are either 1/2ton or  1 ton.
There is a 30Cr fee per container at starports for maint and sterilization.

Two things would make this easier in GURPS, Hero, or any other point-based
character generation system if they were more widely recognized:
 The first is a quote from various Hero System books: "If it isn\'t
really a disadvantage, you don\'t really get points for it."
 The second is philosophically abhorent to most players of such games
(believe me, the facial reactions I\'ve seen prove it) but is really
quite reasonable: Make the point totals represent the character INSTEAD
of having the character represent the points.

 Since this isn\'t a GURPS or Hero list, I will leave it at that.

 ObTrav: Thankfully this has nothing to do with Traveller (aside from
G:T) which has its own set of deeply-dug philosophical rifts and
doesn\'t need any more...

The limit is mostly size and expense; one could allow sensors a

cheaper, though...

Which modifiers did you take? It should probably get the bonus for
being in the outer solar system, and single-hex scan (at those
ranges a whole other star system might count as single-hex, which is
really supposed to represent a <1 degree cone). And you could take
24 hours per scan.

Pleased to know that it makes at least some sense...

Heh.  Depends heavily on manuever, really -- it\'s much harder to get high
acceleration _and_ high manuever in GT than in classic traveller.  I can
withstand a basic spinal PAW with a J-3 M-1 ship of about 50 kT, but for an M-6
ship I\'d probably need 25-50 MT of ship.  Using more expensive armor you can
resist a spinal PAW at around 12 kT.  Make it an SDB and you can probably drop
by a factor of 4 again.  However, for large ships damage _will_ outstrip armor
- -- if you take the same ship and make it 64x larger, it will do 8x the damage
and only have 4x the armor.  OTOH, it will have 16x the hit points.

Incidentally, GT needs to have spinal mounts take up hardpoints ;).  It\'s very
tempting to build battle riders as \'gun, with ship wrapped around it\'.

The problem the Missile folks have in the Traveller universe is that lasers
work. A laser that will swat contact missiles out of the sky is a lot
cheaper than an expensive missile in Traveller, and cheap missiles have
very limited amounts of delta-vee.

If you want a quick CT answer, look at a rapid-fire X gun as a point
defense weapon. 

Counter-missile missiles also have a role, and they dont have to be
ship-killers, and will tend to need much less in the way of supporting
electronics etc.

The Imperium, obviously, wants to maintain it\'s news advantage over the
citizenry.

On the other hand, it is depressingly easy under all versions of Traveller
to build a nice little jump-4, 1 gee fast packet. If you are, say, Sector
Vice-President of Purchasing for SuSAG, it is very easy to need such a fast
back channel to news, and there is no commodity quite like information for
bargaining with your equals. (\'Thanks for doing this for me. If I gave
*them* this, they\'d owe me one\' ... \'I couldnt comment\' ... \'I know, but
they\'d still owe me one\').

Now, here is the pointy bit of where that creation of the megacorporations
and those creations of the Imperium have a bit of a blue.

Personally, I think the compromise would have been that the Xboat network
stays, but the Imperium reserves jump-5 and -6 ships to itself, but I can
see it going either way.

The Xboat routes made sense, when they were set up just after the Civil

Not under Captains - you could put t-bombs anywhere. They did have a time
delay of 2 1/2 impulses before going off, which usually meant you put them
in front of the enemy so they\'d be armed by the time the enemy was almost
on top of them.

Dont forget the \'flash cube effect\' for uncovering cloaked ships ... put a
t-bomb in their hex, then wait a bit, and nose onto it to detonate it ...
if you get lock-on, bye bye Mr Romulan. Setting off your own t-bombs also
has it\'s uses when dealing with massive drone swarms, when you want
absolutely precise control of when they go off (set them for shuttles, and
launch a shuttle when needed. Make the point defense crews aware that the
lowest performing ADD or P-3 crew goes on the shuttle).

Very much so. A old issue of Air and Space Magazine hada cover article

Well said.

Thus far, I\'ve really enjoyed converting old Trav chars to GT.  With the
addition of a few ads/disads, they\'ve acquired greater depth and detail.
While I\'m going to use GT as the "core rules" I\'m going to keep CT character
generation and then convert those chars.

Two systems suitable for largish fleet actions (High Guard* for CT, and
Battle Rider for TNE.

Imperial Squadrons (T4) provided an updated version of Fifth Frontier
War (boardgame for CT), which handles operational/strategic combat
between fleets (a unit represents a squadron of the appropriate vessel
type.)  Imperium (a boardgame detailing the earlier Interstellar Wars)
is in a similar vein.

*(reminded of this by an earlier post) "There is no Game but Traveller,
and High Guard is its Product."  (Or, in transliterated Arabic, "La
la\'aba ila\' al-musaafir, wa al-haaris al-\'aalii risaalat al-la\'aba.")

The problem is not just that the freight rules are broken, but that too may
\'canon\' merchant ships are, frankly, appallingly designed.

If you design a ship with only enough power to stay in jump, run life
support and 1G of compensation, then you can easily make money at Cr 750 +
Cr 500 per parsec. Maneuver is one gee plus a little contragravity. If you
need combat capability, then install a hour worth of battery boost power.

Applying the Striker currency exchange rates to commercial starships pushes
this down further, because TL9-12 starships develop a much lower \'sticker
cost\'. Check out Andrew Vallance\'s TL11 freighters for examples of designs
that will quite happily exist in a TL15 Imperium.

With well-designed ships, Cr 2500 a dton per jump makes way too much profit.

My Military Combat System (known in the privacy of my heart as "Fusion
Guard"), mostly for T4/FFS2, should work reasonably well as a mass
combat system - it includes rules for squadron fire and suggestions
for streamlining into very fast combat, although it needs a fair amount
of work still.

        Hi, Ian!
        Hmmmm...  I\'ll get back to you on this...  I am currently GMing a
TL10-11 game, with ship designs by High Guard.  The TL shelf on the
powerplants makes the vessels obsecenely expensive.  I just finished a 540dt
TL10 merchant with 2G (needed to get off of size 9+ worlds), 3Jp1 and a
power-plant 2.  1/2 the hardpoints aren\'t even armed.  The TL is actually
high for the region it is designed to operate in.  The only reason I armed
it is because it is a "Frontier" merchant, where Privateers/ Pirates are an
issue.  The big range is for the same reason.  It\'s partially streamlined,
with scoops and purifiers so fueling costs aren\'t an issue.
        At 1000Cr/ton frieght, it looses 10MCr per year.  The "Price Per
Ton" breakpoint (costs / revenue tons *2) is 4500Cr.  If I ramp the TL up to
15 (big drop in powerplant size and costs, giving boost in cargo space), the
PPT breakpoint drops to a mere 2825Cr per ton per jump;  however, it still
looses MCr7.4 per year.
        I suppose I could chop the range down to 2Jp1.  If I do that (I have
an economics spreadsheet that does ship expense modelling for CT/High
Guard), then PPT drops Cr2148; loosing MCr6.1/year at 1000Cr per ton.
        I suppose the answer is to ignore peril, strip all the weapons off,
cut the range to 1jp1, speed to 1g (ignore landing on big planets) and hope
alot.  I\'ll cut the computer down, too...  it was a 2bis....  I still don\'t
think that\'d get me to a PPT Cr1000...  Hang on...  Well, I\'ll be damned...
PPT is Cr483.
        So, it is TL15 540t 1-g, 1jp1 pp-1, Model/1 computer, 10 passengers
and 336.5dt cargo, no weapons or defenses.
        At TL10. same stats except cargo degraded to 326t, PPT is Cr632
(makes MCr2.9/year).

        Ok, so to have a frieghter make money, you just have to either make
a killing at speculative, or stick to patrolled areas within a jump-1 of
each other, regardless of TL.  That *somehow*, IMHO, sounds contrary to the
spirit of the game.

        Oooooooo.  I *like* this idea;  so a TL 10 ship in a TL15 game is

        Well, with the above mangled TL10 design, switching from Cr1000 to
Cr2500 bumps the annual return on the ship, under perfect condtions, up to
about MCr14.6.  Verses the cost of the ship, that is a 9% rate of return
(ie, a weak mutal fund).  At Cr1000, rate of return is an unattractive 2%.

        Sorry for the length of this post, but you caught me in an
experimentive mood.  I guess the question is this:  is a 2% rate of return
under perfect conditions enough to make someone want to spend MCr160?

how to scale it.

MegaTraveller has one in I believe the referee\'s companion or the rebellion
sourcebook. It is for surface engagements though, not spaceborn ones, but
it probably could be extropolated into CruRon and Batron units.

Well, if you\'re reasonably adept at Pascal, you could always write a battle generator program.  I\'m thinking about it myself for some stuff I need done here.

Sorry to inject a little reality in your fun bubble, but personally,
I get a kick out of knowing that it is a real company while most
people think its totally fictional.

        Hi, Walt!
        I am very impressed with the presentation...  I don\'t know much
about the GURPs design rules, but I like what he has done with the side
profile and the over all deck plans.

1-D Linear is what I meant. 2-D is a world\'s surface. A 3-D border is

Because there are too many of them, and searches of them allwould be

No doubt. But unless they have some reason to suspect you, they often don\'t
try.  A world with more resources and more will to control its airspace
could be more effective, which is why I was interested in what kinds of
resources would be required.

Except that information travels at different speeds along
different routes.  For single warrants this isn\'t so bad: but for
anything complex,  such as targeting fences on the basis they
can\'t prove where they got such and such,  you are almost certain
to get multiple echoes, as the same list comes by different
routes.  If a world modifies the list based on what it knows and
others don\'t before passing it on, you get distorted echoes.
That\'s practically a recipe for noise.

And every captain in space, innocent or not, is going to be
saying exactly that every port he goes to.  ("I\'ve been CLEARED
for the same *#$%^ thing six different times, including the last
time I was HERE!!!")

This is the kind of thing I expect at individual worlds. They
would handle their own customs regulations plus most violations
of imperial laws. I can\'t see the Imperium getting involved on a
regular basis.  Big scores by the customs office doesn\'t mean
that stuff isn\'t getting past them...

As a special operation, OK. But if ships coming into Halifax
under ordinary conditions got this treatment, your government
could expect to hear complaints.  Even then, you\'re just
searching suspicious cargos, not everything. If the smugglers
are careful and everything looks OK, enough of their stuff can
get by to keep them in business.  I was thinking also of the odd
container with a special handling label which you don\'t want to
open in an evacuated cargo hold in the absence of gravity (IMTU,
a certain percentage of cargo holds have no life support at all)

>Nope... you are thinking 20thC tech.  Every cargo container has

Even if the ship and containers blab everything they know, it\'s
reasonably safe to assume a clever enough smuggler will be able
to figure out how to fool them into thinking they know something
that ain\'t so.  The more inept the criminal, the easier it is to
catch him...

(At the risk of mentioning another game system....) 
There are at least two sites on the Net with modifications to Ground Zero
Games starship minitures rules Full Thrust to allow for the representation of
fleet actions in the Traveller universe.  They are at
http://www.erols.com/nolan/conversion.htm and
http://www.uwm.edu/~cthulhu/FT/5thThrust.txt.  And for an introduction of the
system for those not familiar with Full Thrust you can look at

Of couse this applies to Canadians to.  The problem they would have
is that thy would have to have a 100% turnout to match even a 10%
turnout from the USA (not taking into account, of course, that Canadians
might vote for a presidential system and American might vote for
a parlimentary system or that one country might have a larger
proportion of voting age in its population).

If Canada joined the USA, they probably at the least would
drop down to two parties (as you surmize, the USA uses as
winner takes all system that favors formation of a two
party system).  Except for presidental votes, there is
no real reason that Canada would have to go with the
Democratic and Republican parties as their parties and
would probably keep two of their original ones at first.
(You don\'t need to form a working majority in congress
to form a governement and the US congress allows a fair
degree of freedom to individual members to vote as they
please).

However, the desire to influence presidential elections
would probably cause the Canadian parties to start forming
Alliances with the American parties.  Eventually they would
merge.

Focusing back at Traveller, the US has 10x the population
that Canada has.  This is a drop in the bucket compared to
the population difference between the first Imperium and
the Terran confederation.

Well, I\'m not trying to "prove" anything.  However, the ships
presented in the books as carrying mail aren\'t jump-6 and the
Rebellion Source book indicates that general news of Stephon\'s
death did not go jump-6.

There may be specialty ships that take messages faster (some
megacorps have built them for themselves, right?), but I don\'t
see widespread disemination going this way.

I don\'t, but then I don\'t read every thread.  My guess is
that most info would propigate fastest over the X-boat
backbone and then spread out from their more slowly.

The issue of the type of governemental control is different than
the issue of the amount of governement control.  The Imperium
is likely to have a large impersonal bureaucracy, but that doesn\'t
mean they exert high level of regulation/documentation of
events.  It just means the events they do regulate are controled
by faceless bureaucrats.

Maybe (it is the approach that first comes to mind, though
maybe you can just bop out of the Imperium and sell the
ship and get a new one, but it would probably just be easier
to change).

I think you missed the point in this messge...

It was that at the port of Halifax, where fast
communication around the world make checking back to the
source port trivial compared to the Imperium, they don\'t
do so.

a) you don\'t need to be that fast to out run mail that

Right, they drift along, if they smuggle they have the choice of

not getting caught, etc.

Ships will be moving to get to certain areas for a variety of
reasons.  This isn\'t much of an excuse to detain a ship (and
then the background needs to present the effects of all
those other ships being detained by mistake).

High Guard is a combat system between starships.  There is no part of 
High Guard which is a "here\'s what\'s on this side, here\'s what\'s on 
that side, roll a die and here\'s the final results" system.

I want a mass combat resolution system.  Perhaps that\'s clearer?

Not really, we have almost reached a technological wall with the current

  Dare I ask how so/why? Admittedly, it seems that such a high level of

High Guard doesnt tend to deal with small civilian vessels terrifically
well. It assumes ships are built to military specifications, and you have
the 20t minimum size for bridges.

Try plugging in a CT book 2 power plant in, and see what that does to the
operating profile.

You might also take the maneuver drive to one gee (again, use one out of CT
book 2), and install some contragravity units out of Striker to help you
get out of deep gravity wells.

If it is fully streamlined, I think you could put a good argument up that
it should be able to make winged takeoffs from big worlds, even at (say)
1.1 gees.

My rule of thumb for freight rates is Cr 750 plus Cr 500 per parsec. A
jump-3 freighter should be able to ask for Cr 1750 a dton, plus risk premiums.

Risk premiums should be pretty severe, given all those pirates.

Now, lets assume you are shipping ... High Guard power plants for 200 t Far
Traders. Buy em at Industrial worlds, ship em to non-industrial worlds with
type A and B starports. Now, assuming we buy them at 90% of book value at
the industrial source world, and sell them at book value at the
destination, how far can we ship them at Cr 5000 a jump-3 ?

Note that at 5 TLs worse, your breakeven point is only about 40% higher for
a 1 gee, jump-1 ship. Compare this to how much more inefficient a warship
is at TL10 vis a vis TL 15.

Or take the completely and absolutely stuffed Cr 1000 per jump freight
rates and drop them off a bridge somewhere in Jersey. If a jump-1 costs Cr
1000, then a jump-2 should cost more, right ? The fixed freight rules are
the equivalent of requiring all knights in the Imperium to ride horses in
combat.

Oh, and sticking to patrolled areas isnt absolutely neccessary. Triple
sandcasters and triple missile turrets only take up hardpoints and space,
and dont chew up expensive power.

It has *huge* implications. Really, really, big implications. No more
hi-tech freighters - they are too expensive. Lots of low-tech traders from
the boondocks, shipping people and goods for handfuls of Imperial credits.

Oh, and under HG combat rules, figure out what a captain with Ship
Tactics-4 is worth ... and then figure what she could ask for, and get, as
an annual salary.

If you are using the Merchant Prince trade rules, go the whole hog, and
apply currency exchange rules to the buying and selling prices of cargos.
Hmmm, the idea of shipping stuff from high tech worlds and selling it to
low tech worlds isnt quite as dominant as it used to be ...

Just as a question of interest, could you build me a 10 000t jump-2, one
gee freighter in HG ... put a 50t missile bay and some sandcasters and
lasers on it (enough to intimidate the crap out of any small pirate), plus
the best TL11 computer available. See what price it needs to charge to earn
3% on ship cost per annum.

Well, you have to remember that the US stock market is in the midst of a
massive speculative bubble right now. 9% per annum rises in stock prices
are *not* normal. There have been large chunks of history where investors
would have been happy to get 2%.

Yes, but it doesn\'t work like that. It\'s quite neat though - everybody
around the jinxed character (but not the jinxed one) takes a penalty to all
their skill/stat/etc rolls. For a -1 penalty it\'s worth 20 pts., for a -2
40, and for a -3 60 points. Note that the other players aren\'t told about
the jinx (at least not if you\'ve any brains), so the only way to work out
the cause of the bad luck is to observe the improvement in performance when
the jinx isn\'t around.

The AK 111 class Ketch was an upgraded TL 11 version of the older AK 100.
Externally it was identical (utilising the same hull), it featured greatly
improved habitability (including gravitic compensators) and a much improved
electronic suite. It also replaced the AK 100\'s primitive fusion drive with a
thruster unit of much greater power. However, despite these improvements and
a 52% increase in cargo capacity, it was never to achieve the same level of
popularity as its predecessor.

In service the AK 111 proved that it had lost none of the AK 100\'s rugged
reliability or ease of maintaince. In 2186 AD the AK 111 was selected by the
Terran Confederation for crash production in response to critical merchant
losses in the opening phase of the 4th Interstellar War. One of the ships in
this emergency program, the Lucky Dragon, was built in only 5 weeks; an
achievement which has never been repeated. However as the situation
stabilised, production was scaled back in favour of larger and more efficent
designs. None the less, the AK 111 remained in production well into the
period, and the last example was not completed until the late 23rd Century.

I agree with the alliances.  However, the US party system is completely
different from that in any other country in the world.  Strictly speaking,
the Democrats and Republicans aren\'t political parties at all, just brand
names at election time.  The Canadian parties would have to degenerate a
whole lot to become such a pack of scumbags, hopefully.

I do believe I said it was a handwave.  This is a pseudo-explanation for
why the computers on TL 10 ships ain\'t the equivalent of TL 15
Nintendos....

Centrelink is the Australian government department that looks after
unemployment benefits and pensions, and stuff like that.

Unless said human doen\'t believe in evolution, and considers any attempt
to monkey with nature (pun intended) blasphemy.  I know many people who
_would_ be mortally offended at the idea of uplifting anything, and
_personally_ offended at doing it to a chimp.

Even if every state became a province. Constitutional change isn\'t just a
matter of majority rule up here. Instead, you need to develop a consensus,
which is slower, messier, and sometimes impossible. But it keeps the
politicians busy and out of other mischief :-)

OK, let\'s establish some parameters. 

1) Do you want a die roll per side and the entire battle is resolved, or
would you prefer a few die rolls (and/or decision points) so you could get
some storyline detail (eg. "Enli\'s cruisers make a swift attack on the
left flank. The enemy pulls reserve units to meet the threat. Varnak\'s
battle squadron make a suicide attack on the centre, which crumbles the
line and lets the rest of the fleet pour through to victory").

2) Will you be maneuvering squadron independently of this system, or do
you want strategic movement as well?

3) Will player-characters have an influence on/be influenced by the final
outcome?

4) What is it about Fifth Frontier War/Imperial Squadrons you don\'t
like/don\'t find suitable?

5) Would a fleet equivalent of the abstract system from Book 4 Mercenary
be what you\'re looking for?

Two reasons:

1) It was an incredibly high presence, especially for a single Ministry.
It was also incredibly intrusive. Remember that when we started (Adventure
1: Kinunir) the Imperium was a force more often heard about than actually
encoundered, and suddenly every world had a branch office of the MoJ.

2) It contradicted the dictum that the Imperium was concerned
aboutinterstellar matters, leaving planetary matters to planetary
government.


The Imperial Law article was even worse, in that it wasn\'t science
fiction. (My letter about that got published in the next issue of
Challenge.) No reference to crimes that weren\'t already crimes in the USA
(and most Western cultures), with a clone of the American legal process
(at least, it matches the American legal process as explained in my
Writers Digest "HowDunnit" books).

<non-canon>
In a nutshell, here is how _my_ Imperium works in M0:

1) Imperial citizenship is not automatic. All nobles are citizens, as are
Imperial veterans _after_ their term of service. Children of citizens are
citizens as well. (This will eventually means that everyone is a citizen,
so my M1200 we rejoin canon.)

2) Imperial citizens have the right to trial by an Imperial court, which
usually means the local Imperial noble. This may not be more lenient, but
it is almost always a guarantee of fairness.

Look at how Paul makes a big deal about being a Roman citizen for an
example of this in action. (There are other examples, but most people can
probably find a bible somewhere around.)

3) The Imperial court may enforce the local law, or it may just ban the
offender from the planet in question (with a note that returning to the
locality means that the citizen is explicitly renouncing their right to
Imperial justice).

4) Imperial laws are concerned with:

a) Interstellar trade and conquest
b) Defense of the realm
c) Protection of individuals _in Imperial territory_ as distinct from
planetary territory.
d) Long-term actions that would affect whole populations
e) Relationships between subject polities
f) Treatment of Imperial citizens

Thus, under (d) and (e) a country on a balkanized world could use Imperial
law if another country diverted rivers that they required for survival, or
otherwise altered the ecosystem. Assault and murder are not an Imperial
problem unless they take place on a starship in space (c) or are against
an Imperial citizen (f).

5) The Imperial justice system is both feudal and Napoleonic. The duty to
administer justice is part of a noble\'s job. The judicial system is
Napoleonic, in that the judge takes an active role in questioning and
conducting the investigation, and in that precedent is a non-binding
guideline and is distinct from the text of the law (which is binding).
This has the game advantage of requiring only the law, not pages of
precedents, when the players want to see the laws they have broken :-)

Michel Vaillencourt e-mailed an _anti-matter_bomb_ from Nova Scotia to
my Yahoo address.  Since it had to go to California and then back to
Maine, a die roll of 6- would have the experimental device become
unstable during travel.  Roll once per 1000 km, it blew in Iowa.  Now,
if he had sent it directly to my ISP in Bath, I\'d definitely be one
with the ether right now.

Are the levels of rank within an Imperial starport?  Are they civil,
military, or what?

Sorry if this is elementary.  I\'m a recent convert, thanks to GURPS, but
don\'t find that issue addressed anywhere in that material.

I have every citizen of an Imperial world also carrying Imperial
citizenship.  This simplifies things like travel.  Most people think of
themselves as Reginians or Morans before being Imperials.

IMTU, the Imperium will not intercede in apurely local matter unless they
believe that the trial might vioplate one of the big Imperial laws.  An
interesting scenario comes about when you have a fugitive reaching a world
where his crime is considered nothing special, and resisting extradition.

My Imperium is fairly remote.. worlds have a consulate where the Imperial
authority is concentrated.  This can be anything from a large office
tower/park on a subsector capital to a single room office at the downport
with a "Gone Fishin\'" sign hanging on the doorknob.

There was an article on starports and starport personnel (to include
career/character generation info) in an early edition of Journal of the
Traveller\'s Aid Society.  Since I just got back from Active Duty I\'ve been
looking through my old gaming stuff.  Give me a day or two to dig it up and I
can get a quick \'thumbnail\' of the article to you (or anyone else on the list
that\'s interested).

  Something like F&E perhaps? You\'d have to assign the relative values
yourself, but as long as you have an idea how good you think the ships
are it should work at least as well as using 5FW on a one ship per

Battle resolution.  TCS breaks down when New Home is attacked by waves

a) I don\'t own either.

Well, as far as I\'m aware, there was never a definitive answer as to 
how FFW related to HG.

Hmm; perhaps count the amount of bays (potential and real). The million tonner
would have about 1000 bays maximum (minus 7 for a type T meson gun, and minus
her turrets), and a 60000 tonner cruiser would have a lot less ( 60 max minus

I\'m asuming no differences between bay types and sizes to simplify the combat

 Well, I\'m not trying to "prove" anything.  However, the ships
 presented in the books as carrying mail aren\'t jump-6 and the
 Rebellion Source book indicates that general news of Stephon\'s
 death did not go jump-6.

I simply think that the Court wants to keep this available only to themself.
The x-boat network is kept at a jump-4 level through regulations so that 
the Court will have an edge through getting the information to and from its
destination more quickly. This insures that the Court is the first to know, 
and that the Imperial Megacorp gets that litte edge that keeps it ahead of 
everybody else.

    'body' => 'I\'m creating a fairly detailed Excel spreadsheet (inspired by Mr Akins)
to build GT spacecraft using the modules provided in GT and those posted
on the TML, but I\'m all little confused with the way turrets and weapons
are treated in the rules. Perhaps somebody here can shed light on my
problem.

As I see it, turrets and bays are assigned in one step of the process
with each turret and bay having their own space, mass and cost (ie, 1
space for turrets, 20 spaces for bays, etc). Individual weapons are
added in a later step, and have their own space requirements, mass and
cost (ie, 1 space for each laser in a turret, 50 spaces for a bay, etc).

How does this work?  Up to three weapons are supposed to fit in a
turret, so how can three 1 space lasers fit into a 1 space turret? Or a
50 space bay weapon into a 20 space bay? Are these figures for turrets,
bays and weapons inclusive (say, 1 space for the turret and it\'s
associated bits and pieces, + 1 additional space for each extra weapon
in the turret), or is there something I\'m missing?

I\'m totally lost as to how this is resolved, and it\'s all that\'s
stopping me from completing the spreadsheet (which is heavily influenced
by Andy Akin\'s fine FFS2 spreadsheet - Congrats on the addition to your
family Andrew!) and I will release it when it\'s finished. There\'s
nothing in the errata I have that helps (which is admittedly dated from
October and may be incomplete).

Well, the UK\'s politicians like to refer to the country as UK plc or Great
Britian plc (plc is public limited company, ie traded on the stock
exchange). So the loss of all these former possessions could be considered
corporate downsizing and a concentration on core business. ;-)

FFW as modified in the T4 rules book _Imperial Squadrons_ by IG is the best
bet. It ties back to Pocket Empires if you really want to run large scale
combat between empires. There are some bugs in the SDB factors, but someone
posted a solution here (I may be able to dig out a copy). Pocket Empires
has a very simplistic, but effect combat system too.

BITS has also started work on a development of FT for Traveller - the
combat system has been modified to give a Traveller feel, and the ship
construction system is being changed to match the Fleets Book version.

<GRIPE> Unfortunately, none of the playtest copies people aske for has had
much in the way of feedback for it </GRIPE>

From trying them, Fifth Frontier Thrust seems best of the two you\'ve
quoted, although the spinal weapons are truly screwed up.

For what it\'s worth, GURPS Compendium II has a couple of abstract and mass
combat systems that are character results-oriented, rather than strictly
wargames.  These would be reasonably easy to adapt, if that is the sort of
thing you\'re looking for.

There is, and it works as described earlier.  What you may be looking for
is Unluckiness [-10 points]: once per play session, the GM can make
something go viciously and maliciously wrong for you.  He can\'t actually
kill you outright, but anything else is fair game.  Some vehicles
(starships, say) can be Unlucky in lieu of more mechanical difficulties as
well, and this would reduce the cost of the Starship Patron advantage (the
latter is my house rule, and not official).

Needless to say, GM finesse is necessary to make this enjoyable.  I use a
3x5 card marked "Unluckiness" that I have to hand to the player involved
when I invoke the disadvantage, so that they know what\'s happening (I run
Luck the same way, in reverse).  Running gags -- like having your cargo
minutely inspected at *every* port -- are also a good way to make the
situation humorous instead of adversarial.

The forthcoming GURPS Traveller: Starports and Starbases will cover the

same John M. Ford that wrote the original article for the JTAS, should be
out early next spring (if I understand SJ Games\' development schedule).

My personal view is that they are civil, and important nobles get important
starports, while a class E/class I starport could get run by some Knight
who made the mistake of making a pass at the wrong person, and suddenly
found himself on this iceball with a handgun, a navigation beacon, a
collapsible fuel tank and four hundred pounds of explosive to clear a
landing field with.

Needless to say, our noble may not run the place themselves, but may have
flunkies to do this for him.

Hey, thats a neat adventure hook ... \'There\'s a bar fight ... call the
brute squad ... wait a sec, we *are* the brute squad\'.

I\'d say that running a starport would involve having one level of Status
and Administrator rank per quality of starport, with perhaps Security
Clearance and Wealth as appropriate.

You could either run them on salary (perhaps inadequate), or on a
percentage of turnover (it\'s a fief), or on the basis of whatever you can
skim off without getting arrested (we *did* mention the Imperium is
corrupt, didnt we ? Check G:T p126, and note that Bribery existed as a
seperate skill in all flavours of Traveller ...).

Military starports are the Naval bases, and they are a different story.

S\'ok. The thing you have to remember about the Imperium is it is big,
diverse and has a long history, so if you think something is cool (for
example, buying commissions in the IN as a way of justifying that character
who wants to run a Filthy-Rich-if-incompetant Naval Captain), then justify
it through \'It\'s left over from a memo signed by Grand Admiral Arbatrella
just before she left to solve the Civil Wars, and it\'s never been revoked
that commissions in the 371st Fleet may be sold at auction\'.

The galley I could vaguely justify, but a *gym* on a 100 dton freighter ?

While this is cute, I happen not to like Jinxed, for the simple reason that
one player gets extra points for penalizing the other players (who are not
consulted on the matter).  The same is true of Weirdness Magnet - which is
also redundant with the zero-point advantage/disadvantage, "Player Character."

Without wanting to start up the "unalterable transponders" thread again
maybe the Imperium needs some way be able to make a note on the Captains
Imperial ID noting that he was, indead, cleared of the charges. 

I would suggest using some sort of read only media on each Imperial ID
card into which the judgement of the court could be placed.  See example
below.

"Mora/Mora 106-1112 Imperial Court #4 Baroness Judy Slobotnik presiding

It is the judgement of this court that Eneri Jones
[IMP ID # T5R 2K8 C5F 2Z7]      is Not Guilty of Barratry.  So it is
said, so it is written, so it is so.  This concludes the finding of this
court."

[Actually I think that all Imperial Courts should probably invoke the
name of the Emperor in each decsion but I am not sure what would sound
right.]

Naturally the news would be written on his Imp ID card and go out by X
boat routes.  Therefore it would not be in Eneri\'s best interests to hop
a jump six fast courier the moment the moment the verdict is pronounced.
The next planet he arrived at would not have heard of his trial and
exoneration and he could easily be shot "While resisting arrest."  If
not he would probably be held while the news of the verdict arrived on
the planet.  The authorites there might even conclude that he had forged
the decision onto his ID and retry him for the crime (with forgery &
possibly treason charges added on), find him guilty and have him neatly
executed before the news that he was found not guilty arrived.

Given the population of the Imperium this would mean that the IMOJ has
150,000,000 agents.  Did the article say one _agent_ per 1000,000 or 
one employee per 100,000?

On the other hand given that most planets in the Imperium have a
population of less that 100,000 unless the IMOJ rounds up on their
personnel assignments most planets would not have an agent.

I was going through some of my old rpg material the other day when I
realised that I was holding the answer to the lack of big ships for
Alternity in my hands. I\'ve got a number of supplements for the old FGU
game _Space Opera_, amung them _Sheldon\'s Compendium of Starcraft_ 1 and 2.
These books have quite a number of ships in them, both large and small (54
in total, to be exact), and by converting the large ships I figured I\'d get
a good range of ships from Destroyers to Battleships for little effort.
Thus I threw together a conversion \'system\' to convert Space Opera ships to
Alternity, which I\'m noe posting on the off-chance that someone finds it
useful.

Converting Space Opera Ships to Alternity v1.1.2

Note: These guidelines divide PL7 into early, mid, and late. These are
shown by: PL7e, PL7m and PL7l, respectively.

For small ships convert their tonnage to Dur on the following table and
redesign using Alternity.

Space Opera Tonnage	Alternity Dur (Civilian/Military)
100-   8/10
250-   16/20
500-   24/30
1000-  32/40
2500-  40/50
5000-  48/60

For larger ships just convert the stats and don\'t worry too much about
whether they\'re possible or not.

Durability
DUR = Space Opera DC/25 round to the nearest whatever if it pleases you.

BattleScreens
These become Deflection Inducers. BattleScreens of +15 or more only suffer
a +1 penalty for a Critical Failure, get triple the bonus against non-space
weapons and double vs. Standard space weapons. Those of +30 or more also
get +1 extra to their bonus vs. Attack.

Armour
Space Opera   Alternity 
BattleArmour  Armour Type
0 - +3        None
+4            Light Polymeric
+5            Medium Polymeric (TL7/PL7e)/ Light Alloy (TL8+/PL7m+)
+6            Light Cerametal
+7            Heavy Polymeric (TL7/PL7e)/ Medium Alloy (TL8/PL7m)/ 
              Light Neutronite (TL9/PL7l)
+8            Medium Cerametal
+9            Heavy Alloy (TL7/PL7e)/ Medium Neutronite (TL8+/PL7m+)
+10           Heavy Cerametal
+11 - +12     Heavy Neutronite
+13 or more   Heavy Neutronite x (BattleArmour value/7, rounded to the 
              nearest 0.5)

Nova Guns
N*200+ are considered to be Particle Accelerators, unless the manufacturing
entity uses MegaBolt Torpedoes, in which case they are considered to be
Plasma Cannon. Small Nova Guns should be taken off the following table, as
should standard ship\'s weapons when converting. Twin turrets in Space Opera
ships should be taken to be single turrets in Alternity, and triple turrets
as single turrets with a -1 step to hit bonus.

Nova Gun Calibre  Alternity Weapon
N*25              Point-Defense Gun
N*50              Mass Cannon
N*75              Mass Cannon
N*100             Plasma Cannon
N*125             Plasma Cannon
N*150             Particle Accelerator
N*175             Particle Accelerator

For civilian Hardpoints and the smallest Hardpoints on military ships use
the following rule: Half the Hardpoints will become Point-Defense Guns, and
the other half will be read off the table above. Obviously this means that
N*25 calibre Hardpoints will all be Point-Defense Guns.

Long Range = Plasma/PAW long range + (Nova Gun maximum range - 500)/50
Short and Medium Range retain the same ratio to long range as the standard
Alternity weapons (round down).

Damage = Plasma/PAW damage x (Nova Calibre/100, round to the nearest 0.5)

Accuracy = +0 vs. Large Ships, and +1 vs. Standard Ships.

MegaBolt Torpedoes
Considered to be very large Mass Converters, with corresponding Acc and
special effects. Their range is the same as that of a Mass Converter (very
short). All MegaBolt Torpedo installations are considered single forward
mounted guns.

Damage = Mass Converter damage x (MegaBolt Calibre/100)

Accuracy = +0 vs. Large Ships, and +1 vs. Standard Ships.

StarTorps
Large Space Opera StarTorps are considered to be large missiles with large
Matter Cannon shells as warheads. As a result they the smaller ones aren\'t
too accurate. The ST*775s have good ECM systems, however and are thus quite
accurate against large ships. None of the larger StarTorps are very
accurate vs. Standard sized ships however, because they are not very
maneuverable.

Calibre  Range     Damage            Acc
ST*157   ST*157s are considered to be normal missiles, with all stats as
the particular 
         type of missile loaded.
ST*257   10/20/30  Matter Cannon x2  +1 (+1 vs. Standard ships)
ST*375   12/24/36  Matter Cannon x4  +0 (+2 vs. Standard ships)
ST*775   16/32/48  Matter Cannon x8  -1 (+2 vs. Standard ships)

The ST*775 takes two phases to reach long range, and thus doesn\'t make it\'s
attack roll until the phase after it was fired if the target is more than
32 Megametres away at the time of firing.

Maneuverability and Acceleration
For military ships take the Space Opera TISA acceleration and
cross-reference it on this table:
TISA Acceleration  Maneuverability
+5                 +3
+5/+15             +2
+5/+20             +1
+10/+20            +0
+10/+30            +0*
+15/+30            -1
+15/+45            -2
+15/+60            -2*
+25/+50            -3
+25/+75            -3*

*-1 bonus to maneuverability due to stabilization.

Acceleration and cruising velocity should be read off the Alternity table
as if the ship is using Induction drives (as that is exactly what it is in
fact now using).

Some classes of ship should probably get a -1 bonus for stabilizers and/or
high top speed e.g. Terran Battle Cruisers and perhaps MegaBolt armed ships.

For civilian ships take a look at their acceleration and their top speed
relative to the top speed for their tonnage.

Starfall
Take the ship\'s FTL speed in LY/Day and round to the nearest 5. That is the
ship\'s Starfall range in Light Years.

Computer Grade
Take off the following table:
Total Marks of all ship\'s computers	Alternity Quality
1 - 11                                   Marginal
12 - 14                                  Ordinary
15 - 17                                  Good
18+ or any total from 3+ computers       Astounding

Sensors
Civilian: Take your best guess based on the ship\'s range vs. The maximum
sensor range for that TL, and the ship\'s role.
Military: Military ships will, as a general rule, have all available
sensors for their PL, barring the Remote Network. The presence of a Remote
Network and the number of uses it has will be dependent on the type of
vessel, its role and the designer\'s nationality. As a guide use the table
below:

Ship\'s Class      Number of Uses
Commerce Raider   6
Fleet Corvette    None
Destroyer         None
Destroyer Escort  6
Light Cruiser     12
Heavy Cruiser     6
Fleet Cruiser     9
Battle Cruiser    15
Battleship        12
BattleStar        18

Add 3 uses at PL7l or later, and subtract 3 uses at PL7e (if this drops to
less than 6, no Remote Network is installed).

Communications
Like sensors, pretty much whatever seems reasonable.

ECM, etc.
For a Space Opera ECM value of 5+ give Chaff. For 10+ give Chaff, plus a
Jammer, and multiply the number of Chaff launchers and Jammers by 1 per
\'full\' 2.5 the ECM value is above 10.

Other Features
Ships will usually have enough small craft, Escape Pods and Reentry
Capsules for the whole complement plus passengers.

The cargo Dur of a ship will equal a percentage of its durability equal to
the percentage the cargo tonnage occupied in the original Space Opera design.

Damage Control:
Space Opera    Alternity
Standard       None
Superior       Ordinary
Comprehensive  Good
StarFleet      Astounding

Powerplant: The rating after type (if any) is the surplus power available
as a percentage. This gives a surplus in case of battle damage, and also
allows some maneuvering and firing during Starfall.

Boat Deck: The number and type of small craft carried. Use some general
equivalent. For the fighter flight deck assume that 100 m3 of Space Opera
flight deck means 1 Dur of hanger in Alternity.

Cost: As a very general rule Space Opera ships cost 10 - 20 times their
Alternity equivalents.

Compartments
Divide the ship into 5-10 compartments. There should be 1 Command, and
enough for most essential systems to be split between two compartments
(this doesn\'t matter so much for a civilian ship). There should be a
separate compartment for each weapon battery, with the StarTorps in with
the 1st Secondary Battery. 

I await comments, etc.

Continents:
	Africa, Asia, North Am., South Am., Europe, Australia (AKA
Australasia),
 	Antarctica. Sometimes Europe and asia are considered a single
continent,
	called Eurasia)
Subcontinents
	India, Arabia, (by some definitions) Central (or Middle) america,
	Greenland.

Plates doen\'t enter into continent definitions, per se. They just happen to
overlap in many cases.

The city of Anchorage, Alaska, sits on the edge of the N.Am Plate, and
several "Exotic Terrains" or "Microplates"... bits of other plates scraped
off, bits of plates otherwise long gone....

SoCal also crosses plate boundaries, and has several exotic terains.

PEI, Nova Scotia... they are definitely part of N Am... Hawaii, no. Cuba,
Dominca, maybe... (some claim them as part of central america, others as
part of north america, and others as non-continental islands....)

Hope this successfully muddles thigs up... <G>

The point of the subbie isn\'t to make money, but to provide a largish
"Small ship" for the outlying areas that no bank would otherwise finance.
Assuming it is subsidized, it doesn\'t need to make a clean profit, just
cover crew salries, fuel and maintenance; the subsidizer takes 1/2 of the
left over, if any, for 40 years, then turns over the ship to the subsized
owner/operator.

Under MT, A subbie crew can make a profit, assuming no monthly payments. It
just cannot make a profit with only carried containers while making monthly
payments. Once "paid off", it can make a tidy profit. And, if it carries
speculative cargos, it can make a killing.

I don\'t like "Smart Containers"... I use a standard container, property of
IMoT, in the following sizes: 1Td, 2Td, 4Td, 8Td. (The containers are in
Striker/MT terms AV8, TL 12).

For Ex: the 1 Td (Using MT Design Sequence)
			Pwr	Vol	Mass	Cr
Disp 1			-	[13.5]	 1.5	3300
Config 4 (BoxUSL)	-	-	x1	  x0.6
Armor TYpe F (SD)	-	-	x0.26	  x1
Armor Value 8		-	-	x2	  x2
			=====	=====	=====	=====
			-	-	 0.78	3960
Basic Mechanical Ctrl	-	  0.4	 0.1	   5	1 panel.
			=====	=====	=====	=====
				13.1	 0.88	3965
This allows a vaccum sealable container (Hard Times/One small step) that is
not intended for protection from stellar radiation nor microasteoridals.
I figure rental on the containers is about Cr 100 per month (pays in 40
months), with a one month minimum.

Reefer Box add
BEnv			0.0135	0.0675	0.0675	 135	Rental addition Cr5

Live Cargo add
ExLS, BLS & BEnv	0.054	0.783	0.783	6885	Rental Addition Cr 200

all the above can operate off of 1 mechanical panel. THe add-ons assume
external power.
Larger boxes are cheaper.

I think your container costs a bit low... (This is still much cheaper than
under GURPS Vehicles; PN and I figured that out... YEOWCH!!!)

I\'ll run up some additonal (MT) containers an post them later.

If you use the vehicular combat rules with appropriate movement addon (say,
Mayday?), you can use the large scale combat rules to any scale. I\'ve done
this on rare occasions.

If you use the HG-based ship combat rules, not really.

IIRC, Aren\'t these the working definitions:

Brittain: The island containing England, Scotalnd, and Wales.
Great Brittain: The Govenrment covering the Island of Brittain, composed of
3 local regional sub-governments of England, Scotland and Wales.
United Kingdom: Great Brittain, and the dependancies of N. Ireland,
Brittish Virgin Islands, Singapore, the Falkland Islands, and a handful of
other small dependancies.

Commonwealth of Nations: A non-governmental trade body consisting of the UK
and it\'s former dependancies who have left under peaceful means, but
generally still use the monarch as the facce on the coins and currencies....

Under SFB Commanders AND Captains: you cannot transport a t-bomb to go off
inside another unit. It has fail-safes to prevent it fom going off in
enclosed spaces (for handling purposes, primarily, but also game ballance),
and under Captains (D15, D16, specifically) you cannot transport directly
to control spaces due to transporter shielding. Bridge H&R Raids are
basically beam just outside the control space, blow down the doors, lob a
few photon grenades, and beam back out.

Ob Trav: What kind of security systems are used for control spaces on Trav
Ships? IMTU, most imperial designs in the DD have psi shielding on the
bridges to prevent Zhodani Teleporters from taking the bridge directly.

One \'t\' in Britain, British, etc.
British Isles = Great Britain, Ireland, various other smaller islands like the
Isle of Man
Great Britain = the island which contains England, Scotland & Wales
United Kingdom = the state, which includes the countries of England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland, and dependent territories
Places like the Falklands are (apart from being very few in number) kind of half
and half and as far as I recall do not have full citizenship. The main ones
(since the handover of Hong Kong) are the Falklands and Gibraltar, mainly
because they annoy other countries.

It\'s not a trading bloc like the European Union (which begand as a trading bloc,
but is now more than that); countries in the Commonwealth do not automatically
get favourable terms for trade. It\'s effectively an institution whereby most of
the countries who have had British rule and culture imposed on them can run
joint (cultural) programs, network, etc. Many of the member countries are
republics, and have no association with the British monarch, other than that she
is head of the commonwealth. The principal common factor is the English
language. Several former colonies/possessions are not members (USA, Ireland and
I think Yemen), at any given time at least one has probably been expelled
(currently Nigeria, again I could be wrong), and at least one member
(Mozambique, a former Portugese possession) was never a British possession and
does not speak English, except at ambassadorial parties.

That is just about exactly what everybody I\'ve ever played GURPS with has

engagements under High-Guard.
        Basically, for Mesons for example, you take the %to-hit x %to pen
configuration x %to pen screen x%to score a critical.  You wind up with a
tiny number that is the total odds of a given attack disabling the target;
that is the %losses you inflict.  Add a bit of randomness to skew the
bell-curve around (1d; 1 %losses /4, 2 %losses/2, 3-4 %losses as indicated,
5 %losses x1.5, 6 %losses x2) and that would resolve by software program
pretty quickly.

        I\'m running CT, but I think that this\'d be valuable to others on the
list.  My container costs are on the premise that like the RealWorld(tm) the
transporting craft is borrowing the containers or, more likely, just moving
them for someone who is borrowing them.  However, the customs & quarentine
charges are paid by the shipper.
        When I go back to work on Monday, I am going to ask our traffic
co-ordinator what it costs us to ship 2TFU-load of product from Halifax to
Antwerp.  I believe by G3, that is a week-ish trip, so it\'ll be an interest
RealWorld(tm) benchmark.

The copyrights might have reverted.  But you\'re fine with that.

I don\'t like "Smart Containers"... I use IMTU a standard container,
property of IMoT, in the following sizes: 1Td, 2Td, 4Td, 8Td. (The
containers are in Striker/MT terms AV8, TL 12). Pretty dumb, but still not
cheap. The reasoning for giving them vacc-capable hulls is simple:
survivability in case of bay depressurization. They can be handled in
vaccum. They can (for short periods) survive harsh atmospheres... Big lines
and multi--system broker conglomerates may own their own. The truly
paranoid might add a 1L computer and commo package for a "Smart Container",
as well as enough battery power for this. Huge, commercial, high volume
units willl probably come in 10, 20, 50, and 100 Td sizes, with only dry or
refer versions.

For comparison, Striker/MT AV8 = 2cm of hard steel. Striker does, but MT
doesn\'t, consider armor volumes (One of my gripes about MT... See, I even
pick on MT ;^)

        Hi, William!
        Actually, there is a faultline that runs ride downt the SW-NE axis
of Nova Scotia.  The west side is native to the NA plate, but the East side
is geologically native to the *African* continent.  How\'s *that* for a muddle?

If one stretches this just a bit, to include any form of remote sensing
(not a big stretch, IMHO), a truly _twisted_ naval architect would still
psi-shield the bridge, to prevent the enemy from discerning the thoughts
of the command crew.  Said twisted architect would _also_ psi-shield
things such as a fuel tank near the bridge, a couple of high-radiation
areas near the psi-shielded engineering section, and other singularly
unpleasant places, on the theory that the telepaths would detect the
psi-shielding, and either:

	a.  Assume that the shielded area is a vital C2 node on the ship (thus
possibly getting the commando team to teleport to a messy and unpleasant
death), or

	b.  Assume that the naval architect was a sadistic SOB, who
psi-shielded a hazardous area deliberately to lure a commando team to a
messy and unpleasant death.

Either way, you cut down on the teleports onto selected areas of the
ship.

OTOH, I figure that anyone who tries to teleport from one moving ship
onto another deserves whatever damage he/she/it takes from differential
in kinetic energy....

Hi.  I\'m new, so you don\'t know me.  I\'m not new to Traveller, though.
 I\'m a rabbid CT fanatic.

I have been trying to find out what the deal is with that Alternity
thing.  I even joined a little on-line club of fans, but they seemed
pretty boring.  I saw the books at a book store, but didn\'t have a
chance to look it over.  My real question is should I farm the players
of that game for Traveller converts or are they just a bunch of
wild-eyed little snotgobblers to be ignored?  (Sorry, haven\'t had my
shot today).

From what I\'ve seen a good chunk of the on-line people seem to be AD&D
players who bought it because TSR wrote it. OTOH they also seem to be quite
taken with the \'novel\' idea of sci-fi roleplaying.

The game itself is mainly directed at the space opera genre, with fairly
heroic PC\'s and a task system that a vary wide range of possible results
from horrible failure to almost over-the-top success. However despite the
herooic tone the combat system is actually pretty deadly and has quite a
neat mechanism for post combat death by shock and bleeding - if you take
\'mortal\' damage you keep getting worse until you\'re sewn back up or die.

We shouldn\'t.   The Zhos at TL-14 should be using X-ray lasers (either grav
focused or no), which actually facilitates *smaller* turrets.  When I designed
my Hiver capital ships, i used ROF 200, 144 Mj Grav Focused Xray laser turrets
(on a 3dt turret assumption).  I then tinkered w/ the size of the focal array
(shrinking it) and got the volume down to 36m3 w/ optimum damage performance
out to 80 BL/BR hexes.  

I did use the 3/6 dt assumption, though.  More from familiarity than anything
else, but it is a useful size niche.  The detail could (and probably would)
vary according to actual volume.

I think the 3dt turret and 6dt barbette are actually decent for TL-12 (when
the Imperium started).  Once they get to TL-14, x-ray laser turrets would
probably be used over tunables, which allows for much smaller volumes
(especially w/ non grav-focusing, which isn\'t quite needed w/ x-ray lasers).

Me 2.  Anyone wanna tackle this beast?  I\'ve done alot of thought on the
Hivers.  I did my designing (Hiver cruiser, carrier, destroyer,  Ithklur
fighters, etc) in mind w/ a Hiver convoy to the Reformation Coalition,  I
think i\'m likely to do some pre-collapse designs (which i touched on in the
design descriptions).  If for anything else, it\'ll make for some deadly
vampires to be prowling around...

I\'m interested in any references from anyones TU for durations of landing
clearance and clearance to leave a system.  This ties into the
sensors/detection capabilities of a mainworld, which were largely consistent
until the DSR.

This whole issue goes more into "standard" customs procedures and system
traffic control (STC), and the volume of system traffic, of course.   How long
to detection/contact by STC?  Do they have a 300,000km PEMS at the starport?
I\'m actually evnvisioning a network of probes... actually probably small
sensors stations maybe no more than 10dt... at least enough to cover the
mainworld to 100d limit for worlds outside the well of the primary and any gas
giants.

Could there perhaps be a simple equation to match various UWP digits?  I\'m
thinking... if a mainworld has starport A and pop A, then it takes N hours to
get through the traffic pattern.  You want to take off and leave to another
system... how long of a wait to enter the traffic pattern?   Does anyone have
answers to that or does everyone do as I do and just say Xd amount of time, or
just skip it entirely?  I\'m aware of nothing canonical in this regard (the G:T
TNS entry on the TJ bringing Strephon back to Capital and snarling the traffic
pattern of Capital comes to mind in something i\'d like to be able to model).

First, there is this rumour that ship costs have gone down in G:T. They
havent - the fact you dont have to buy a power plant is compensated for by
the fact you do have to pay for fuel tankage (and serious money, too). You
seem to need more maneuver drives under G:T as well.

Secondly, streamlining is vicious in G:T, at 20% of total volume, no
discounts. Unless this has been errata\'d, I would argue it should be a 20%
increase in surface area (in effect, a 20% loss of DR), with no effect on
volume as such. Volume is only really a concept that applies in jump space,
and jump space doesnt care what shape you are, just how much volume you
take up.

OK. Here are the ships. The first one is a FFS2 TL9 8000 dton bulk
freighter. It\'s something I\'ve been meaning to do for a while - see what
sort of ship you can build at TL9. I cheated slightly, and put in a TL10
HePLAR drive. The second one is a G:T compliant GT10 10 000t trader (with
the obligatory Honking Big Particle Accelerator).

Both ships come in at or around a gigacredit and can drive transport costs
well below Cr 1000 for one parsec. 

The ships arent really suitable for PC use, but they are excellent ships
for characters to have been on - either Decafreighter can expect a monthly
turnover in the tens of megacredits, so if you are a hot captain in charge
of one, you could easily be clocking up company bonuses that add up to a
downpayment on your very own Far Trader.

As usual, starship components are rounded up to the next MCr 0.1, to
provide for Ditzie\'s Retirement Fund.

FFS2 TL9 Decafreighter

8000 dton Short Cylinder (52m long, 52m diameter ; 12921.4 m2)

10 Sanitary Facilites (35 m3, 0.5t, MCr 0.1)

10 Standard Airlocks (30 m3, 2t, MCr 0.1)

1000 m2 Cargo Hatch (MCr 1)

6650 dtons cargo (93 100m3, 93 100t)

Total : MCr 981.05, 109 600t

Crew : 51 total - 8 Command, 8 Maneuver, 4 Electronics, 11 Maintainence, 20
Engineering (Captain gets large stateroom, officers get singles, everyone
else gets a bunk and *likes* it)

Note the lack of namby-pamby facilities like artificial gravity, a gym, a
galley ... it\'s a ship that spins when it isnt pulling it\'s impressive 0.3
gees.

On the other hand, at TL9 and for under a gigacredit, you get to move 6650
dtons of cargo one parsec from orbit to orbit. Surface to orbit transfer
would be done through a number of smaller, streamlined contragravity craft.

OK, now the GT Decafreighter (GTL 10).


Hull : 170 t, MCr 8.5

20 000t armour : 20 000t, MCr 60 <DR 2353>

Command Bridge : 2 dt, 20.3t, MCr 9.6

Basic Bridge : 2.5 dt, 8.6 t, MCr 4

Engineering : 1 dt, 4.1t, MCr 0.32

1100 Mnvr : 1100 dt, 3740 t, MCr 176

200 Jump : 200 dt, 800 t, MCr 620

JFuel : 1000 dt, 1300 t, MCr 160 

Utility : 1 dt, 11.5 t, MCr 0.3

Missile Bay : 50 dt, 619 t, MCr 0.85

PAW Bay : 50 dt, 467t, MCr 22.9

10 Triple Lasers : 10 dt, 319t, MCr 20.4

2 Sickbays : 2 dt, 1.5 t, MCr 0.2

150 staterooms : 600 dt, 360 t, MCr 1.8

7000 dton cargo : 7000 dt, 35000 t

Total : 63 700t, MCr 1085

Crew is : 52 - 8 Command, 22 Maneuver, 8 Jump, 2 Missile, 2 PAW, 10
Lasers/Stewards. 8 single staterooms, 22 double staterooms. 120 passengers.

The armament should be enough to intimidate most pirates (the ship only
dedicates about 1.5% of volume to armament), which is just as well, because
the Decafreighter pulls 0.69 gees.

Under standard financing, a monthly payment is MCr 4.52/mo, so it looks to
be viable at about Cr 350 net for cargo and Cr 2750 net for passengers.

Now, if you rip 1000 dton of cargo, 100 dton of maneuver you can take it up
to jump-2 by adding 100 dton of Jump and 1000 dton of JFuel. Mass is
60060t, cost is MCr 1539. Crew goes up by a net 2 (lose 2 maneuver techs,
gain 4 Jump techs). A payment is MCr 6.41 a month, so it looks like it is
viable at around CR 600/Cr 4000 net. The ship still pulls about 2/3rds of a
gee.

If you go for jump-3, you get 1900 dton less of cargo, 300 dtons less of
maneuver, 200 dtons more of jump, 2000 dtons more of Jump fuel, for a net
mass of 56 580t, a net cost of MCr 1983. The smaller M-drive means the ship
pulls 0.55 gees, and the crew is 54 (eight more jump techs, 6 less maneuver
techs).

A payment in this case is MCr 8.27, so it looks to be viable at about Cr
850 for cargo, net Cr 6000 for passengers.

A few skills and advantages that players might want.  I think
it likely you could run a campaign for a while on GURPS Lite

covers what you want or you want to shell out few bucks for
more.  By all means give it try....

On the other hand, I dont believe that the Spinward Marches in the 1100s

it\'s the Navy). It, like Australia, may have the myth of being a wild

The Japanese had no trouble getting volunteers to pilot the Oharu(?)
(aka "Baka") flying bomb. So if the waste of personnel was justifiable,
I can see at least *some* Zhodani teleport commandoes willing to port
into the enemy command ship for the purpose of destroying it.

200 kilos (commando + gear) at several hundred km/sec relative velocity
will do a rather good impression of a nuke (at 100 km/sec I get an
equivalent of 200+ kton).

An often overlooked portion of the Terran navy during the Interstellar Wars, the 
highly specialised Bomb Ketches were none the less a vital part of the fleet. 
Designed specifically for planetary bombardment duties, two very distinct forms 
of the vessels were produced. The first were the small cheap, mass produced 
designs intended for service as orbital artillery in low threat environments; the 
second were the larger heavily protected designs intended to neutralise enemy 
planetry defences. The General Grant class fell into this second catergory. The 
most notable feature of the design was the heavily protected hull (over 1.1 
meters of crystaliron) with armour that would not disgrace a Ship of the Line. 
Since the vessel was intended to operate in a stable low orbit, little attention 
was paid to maneuverability; however the class featured an extensive ECM 
outfit with particular emphasis on passive jamming and a heavy point defence 
laser battery. The class carried six 3 Td lifeboats, each capable of carring up to 
11 passengers for up to 24 hours (since the class operated mainly in low orbit, 
this was considered sufficent endurance).

The class\'s offensive armarment was its three missile bays optimised for the 
small (0.25 Td) Raiden missile. The Raiden was a short range high-g missile 
which could be fitted with a wide variety of warheads, including a 500 KT det 
laser, a 12 x 10 KT MIRV, a wide variety of smart deadfall ordinance, chemical 
and biological warheads, and many others. Bomb Ketches remained an 
important part of the Terran Confederation\'s fleets throughout the Interstellar 
Wars, but they fell out of favour as the Rule of Man adopted Vilani style Strike 
Cruisers for the planetary attack role (though fitted with the newly developed 
meson gun).

One of the most famous examples of the type was the Marshal Ney. During the 
Eigth Interstellar War, the Marshal Ney was one of the flagship of the small 
flotilla of Bomb Ketches that were carried by Admiral Albadawi\'s jump 3 fleet 
tenders. It was the accurate and effective attacks by the flotilla that enabled 
Aldadawi to reduce Enulsur, Apishlun, Shikashu and Duriim in quick
succession; thereby isolating the Vilani fleet and enabling the Terrans to 
smash open the frontier.

IIRC psi shielding in later forms of Traveller blocks both Telepathy and
Calairvoyance.  As I see it Zhodhani Teleporters could _theoretically_
teleport into a psi shielded area but without a clear mental picture of
their destination (which they can\'t get without Clairvoyance) they may
well end up dead if they try.

        Hi, Dusty, Tommy!
        You are also forgetting a significant issue:  TL.  You can build and
maintain JP4 X-Boats and Tenders at TL13 (any subsector Captial, no matter
*how* frontier the region), whereas JP6 requires TL15.  So, If the X-Boat
Network is to be as pervasive as is needed, then you can\'t go JP6, since you
can\'t maintain the vessels in frontier areas....  The Spinward Marches, for
example, NEED to be in touch with the Core in case the Zho attack again...

Sorry, saw "Men in Black" again, \'tother day...

One thing to consider, when we start thinking about all the IMOJ agents,
Customs Agenmts, Imperial officials, etc, etc, etc is _how_ many of them are
full-time IMOJ agents, Customs agents, etc, etc. 

How many of these agents are simply local administrators who\'ve gotten yet
_another_ hat to wear?

I\'d suspect that the local ruling noble\'s staff does _all_ of the work for the
imperium, as well as their regular jobs...

So, on paper you have 1 IMOJ agent per 100,000 people, and one Office of
Calendar Compliance, and one Customs liason, and one Imperial Trade
representative, and one overworked bureaucrat doing all of these jobs. 

All of those agencies _will_ have people doing just that one function;
ferinstance, I\'d suspect that on most hi-pop worlds in the Marches, there are
sizable IMOJ offices, with lots of agents.  The Marches also have several
active terrorist organizations, lots of other unrest, piracy, etc etc, and the
Navy doesn\'t do all the civilian law work...

How do they deal with eating modern farm products, such as corn peas or
potatoes? Any of them own chihuahuas or poodles? Bet on the odd racehorse, eat
chicken, pig or turkey? Have pet goldfish?

Every one of them has been geneered, just the old fashioned way, by
generations of directed crossbreeding.

Is Jeremy Rifkin a high priest of that church?

Dragging it _back_ to Traveller, I find it astonishing that dogs _weren\'t_
mentioned right away as uplifted species...they\'ve been companion animals with
mankind far, far longer than any other species, and would be a natural
subject, IMHO.

Then again, I look down at my dogs and think "Just as long as they don\'t give
them _thumbs_!" (Favorite Gary Larson cartoon: Man is reading a note scrawled
in a childish hand-\'Bob and me are going for a ride. Stay ! STAY!\', as two
laughing dogs drive off in his car...)

        Hi again, Ian.  Here is the "Full Meal Deal"(TM) on your ordered
design...
        
        Again, we see that the 1000Cr/ton is not enough to support an armed
merchant.  At this size, we are close.  And this is one *mean* bitch in
Merchant vs Pirate combat....  that missile bay will incinerate anything
smaller than a Merc Cruiser in a couple of shots.  The lasers are pretty
stiff against smaller craft and effecive in the anti-missle role;  the sand
is practically opaque to anything the size of a patrol cruiser or smaller.
The cargo bay is massive....  you can *hangar* 11 sub-merchants in it....
It carries a nice number of passengers, and has enough gunners off-duty at
any one time that a hi-jack is not even an issue.
        But you still can\'t pay for it.

        Now, if we tinker the numbers to reflect your suggested
750Cr+500Cr/jp, and we tell our captain to only take Jp2 cargoes
(1750cr/ton), then we get a *profit* of 5.7MCr per month, or 68.4MCr per
year (I don\'t show the calcs below, so just trust me).  That is about,
again, a 2% rate of return under perfect conditions.

This is propably one of the reasons interstellar empires fall after a time.
The local burecrates get fed up with doing the jobs while the nobles gets
all the fun. Sooner or later they start neglecting their "imperial duties"
and concentrate on the local work, that really "mean" something.

>I\'d suspect that the local ruling noble\'s staff does _all_ of the work for the

I also think that younger Imperial Nobles get assigned to to certain liasion
duties to local high level ruling nobles. I suspect that quite a few of these
neglect work and become a burden for the locals.

>So, on paper you have 1 IMOJ agent per 100,000 people, and one Office of

And he most propably has several local duties also. And as he is a local
boy, he\'ll soon realize that it is easier to climb the local ladder of 
power that the Imperial one, and start concentrating on these functions.
That means that the good bureacrates will get better jobs in local agencies
while the Imperial positions whil be filled with lesser able workers. Maybe
this gives the pirates and smugglers an easier time in fooling or paying of
these agents.

  It doesn\'t really, beyond the extent of rough TL of forces and the budget

Keven, we argued this out for 15 bloody months. Piracy is *not* dead.
Routine piracy *around mainworlds* tends to make pirates dead, and is
insanely difficult to make money doing.

Big difference. Especially if you are a friend or a relative of an asteroid
miner who died after a raid, when the nearest SDB was 7 hours travel away.

Secondly, if you have no customs or paperwork in Imperial Space, then there
is, by definition, no smuggling, except across the extrality fences.

Now, we know at least two commodities that are illegal in imperial space -
nukes and slaves. Nukes are easy ... ask \'Any fissionables ?\', then wave a
damper over the ship from a safe distance. They probably dont do it twice,
if conservation of energy applies.

Slaves are more difficult, especially if they are of the \'bonded immigrant\'
sort. I can see densitometers used on cargo containers.

Now, if the Imperium is serious about stopping piracy, then we get the
whole vexed question of whether the Imperium would try and track stolen
cargos. I think it would depend on whether or not piracy was perceived as
being more of a problem than usual.

If Sufficiently Important People think it is, then we get cargos tracked,
backtracked and so on.

If not, then business as usual.

Of course, if the Imperium makes certain drugs illegal, then we can toss
all that logic out the window. Me, I say they dont care.

But then how would they feel about an uplifted dog?  In any case,
we can agree there is not more reason for Vargr to be insulted
by uplifted dogs than there is for a human to be insulted by
uplifted monkeys?

I have allways disallowed the Jinxed disad for that reason.
However, I have no problem with Weirdness Magnet (except
it is too silly for me :-).  The brunt of the problems
fall on the character that took it and the rest only take
fallout (which is fine by me).

In any case, taking Unlucky would fit better (the fact that
it manefests as problems with ship papers is a special effect
that doesn\'t affect the point cost).

        IMTU, UN Staff available at any given starport/ planetary capital is
given by the following:

        Starport   Staff Mult
            A           12
            B           8
            C           6

            E           2
            X           1

        Square the Pop UPP factor and multiply that by the table above and
1d/3.  So, a class A starport, Pop A, roll of 6, you\'ve got 3600 civillian
employees handling UN affairs on that planet.  Everything thing else is the
local world government\'s problem.  Every subsector has a facility of twice
that many civillian beauraucratic employees on a world that handles the over
all subsector\'s affairs.
        Of course, this doesn\'t involve military affairs or diplomatic affairs.
        Obviously, if there aren\'t enough bodies, then divide jobs by people
and it\'ll tell you how many hats any one person is wearing.

        Hi, Ian!
        So, for EP, "pretend" it is a HG powerplant and derive energy
production normally?
        I agree with your HG observation.  The problem is when you get
"civillian" ships alongside "military" ships;  protected convoys under
attack by raiders.  Since they operate under different design rules (CT:
missle does 1d hits;  HG: one hit only), it gets strange resolving these
situations.  So, I figure it is easier to tinker with the "break-even"
numbers for commerce than it does to try and balance the differences in ship
design.
        Particularly where commerce between systems doesn\'t seem to give a
damn what the shipping costs are.  Unlike, lets say, the V2 rules for TSR\'s
"Star Frontiers" where they had rules to model the ebb and flow of trade at
the Imperium scale.

        One of these days I am gonna have to read Striker.  I haven\'t
bothered (even though I own it), since its never been applicable to anything
my players have done.  Of course, now that I have an interstellar war
looming on the horizon, maybe I\'ll have an excuse.

        Nope.  The "Wilds" class Frontier Merchant that we\'ve been
discussing is a "Close Structure" hull design to cut down on hull costs.
However, good point for furture designs!

        I think this is how I will start doing things IMTU.  I can even base
the "risk premiums" on the area:  Core Worlds = 1x, Established Worlds =
1.5x, Frontier Worlds = 2x, Beyond Frontier = 2.5x.

        Yeah, I noticed that too.  Fighting ships suffer alot with TL, but
merchants and liners don\'t really.  Of course, that 40% can look like a Rift
when you\'re trying to make a starship payment.

        Yepper!  It makes the "40-year old" merchant ship believeable,
particularly in a technologically growing TU, such as mine.  Max TL for the
Core is 11, but by the end of a 100-year war, the Core will be TL 15.  That
means a state-of-the-art Core Merchant is going to be a Frontier TL vessel
by the end of the payments.

        Yeah, but I\'ve heard a lot of financial analysts indicating that at
the rate the world is developing, the "first world" nations\' economies are
going to be running hot for a while.  Postulate that you have planets that
you can export an entire world\'s worth of grain consumption too (starting
colony, hi-pop worlds, etc) and I don\'t see that slowing much below 5% on a
much lower risk money environment.

        Thanks very much, Ian.  I am really enjoying this thread.  Nice to
chat with someone online who can debate/ discuss a point rationally for an
ongoing period of time.

They deal with it by ignoring the contradictions. Anything they remember
from childhood falls into  the catagory of "things have always been this
way". Some will even talk for hours of the "evils of science", pausing
only to take their medicine (such as anti-biotics)! Not an attitude
limited to Phillipino Baptists, either.

It was my first encounter with people who actively scorned logic. I was
astounded.

*making time-out signals* there is a typo of mine in there. Cargos should
earn Cr 250 + Cr 500 per jump ... plus risk premiums.

Now, we have a ship that can incinerate most anything smaller than a
destroyer, and it can give a destroyer a couple of nervous moments. Hell,
you could militarise it, stick in another 400 staterooms, and carry an
entire Imperial Marine battallion ...

Now, as a customer, is this level of security worth paying extra for ?

My answer is a definite \'maybe\'. Some destinations and some cargos will
make it worthwhile.

Remember, this is a TL11 design ... if you are operating in a higher tech
Imperium, buying it with soft currency and getting paid in hard currency,
then it starts to become more and more economically viable, even without
risk premiums.

And you have that neat little MT story about how Norris took advantage of
being the only one who knew to make himself Arch-duke to support that.
Unfortunately that story was one of those ideas that sounds great until
you give it a closer look. Then it starts leaking like a sieve.

>The x-boat network is kept at a jump-4 level through regulations so that 
>the Court will have an edge through getting the information to and from its
>destination more quickly.

The real meta-reason why the X-boat network is only jump-4 is that you
couldn\'t make a 100 T jump-6 courier with the original High Guard ship
construction rules (I forget if it was possible with Book 2; I don\'t think
so). Indeed, the TAS newsbriefs that tells of the newfangled drop tanks
also mention that plans were being made to upgrade the X-boat network to
jump-6, at least along the major links, using drop tanks.

Nowadays, after the mandatory 20 T bridge is no longer mandatory, it is
possible to make jump-6 X-boats. So another reason was needed. But "the 
Imperium wants to keep the capability to itself" dosen\'t cut it. Jump-6
ships are _potentially_ available to far too many people with both the
funds and the desire for quick information. (My own preferred explanation
that jump-4 was the highest possible jump when the X-boat system was put
into place, and the X-boat manufacturers lobby has labored mightily to
keep the Imperium from upgrading. But I also think that a lot of different
organisations have their own private courier network.)  

>This insures that the Court is the first to know, and that the Imperial
>Megacorp gets that litte edge that keeps it ahead of everybody else.

First, that\'s 16 different organisations right there: The Imperial
Bureaucracy, the Imperial Navy (both canonical), and 14 Megacorporate
networks. The megacorporations are not the same as the Court, you know. Add
to that all the high-tech, high-population worlds that like to get their
news fresh and you have another I-don\'t-know-how-many private networks. And
then, of course, precisely because advance information is so valuable in a
commercial sense, I believe that the sector-wide companies would have to set
up networks of their own in sheer self-defense. And the sub-sector wide
companies would propably club together to set up their own network. Then
there are the sector-wide news networks and TAS, both IMO both willing and
able to pay for a courier network of their own.

And a general comment about the X-boat network. It looks to me like it was
generated using random dierolls and that table in Book 3. It certainly
wasn\'t reality-checked. If the question about communication time really
was so serious as the Library Data claims, a much better setup would IMO
be in use. IMTU the sector captials are tied together by direct lines that
go by the most direct route and subsidiary networks carry the news to and
from subsector capital and other major worlds. Those doglegs that make
some major worlds less than 6 parsecs from each other three or four jumps
apart by X-boat just don\'t exist IMTU.

The system mechanics aren\'t that bad... (It is somewhat cinematic, but not
unplayable.) Haven\'t seen too many munchkins get interested in it, but
mostly old D&D\'ers who are looking for something to replace Star Frontiers.

It is an easy to learn, easy to run, well written, beatifully illustrated
system. (IMHO, it made T4 look like something that feell out of a horse)

deluge.  Anyone else needing pre-\'97 versions can just e-mail me as well.

        Hi, Ian!
        Nope, it doesn\'t work....  JP2 cargoes only earn Cr1250/ ton,
meaning you loose KCr121 per month, or MCr1.46/year.  Cr750 + Cr500/jump is
a healthier balancing number for low tech ships.

        I agree.  The problem is that our PPT calculations at Cr750 +
Cr500/jump call for *perfect* conditions *every* trip.  One brawl that you
have to do significant repairs, even if you obliterate the corsair and his
two foolhardy associates, and you are in the red for the year.

        At (Cr250 + Cr500 /jump) /ton, with risk premiums as I suggested for
MTU, this ship would have to operate almost exclusively in the Frontier to
make solid profits.  Paradoxically, this also means it runs greater risk of
taking expensive damage.  Again, YMMV, since I don\'t know how dangerous YTU
is.  In the Frontier, there is a 3/12 chance of a Corsair or Privateer at a
"B" class starport....  it gets somewhat worse at lesser ports.

        Hi, Mike!
        Here they all are, ZIP\'ed as either MS Word95 or MS Excel95.  Have
fun, and I hope you enjoy them.

        Hi, Ian!
        I agree...  IMTU, the Core of the Terran Sphere is a death trap for
Pirates.  The UN believes in Q-Ships.

        ROTFL!

        IMTU, I assign a given ship "Noteriety" based on kills and how
surviors report they were treated.  I\'ll spare y\'all the tables, but suffice
to say that it is sufficiently difficult to hunt down a single ship that it
can be some time before the UN-DSN tasks ships to start searching the area a
given Corsair operates in with SAND orders.
        Of course, when they *do* issue that order, that Corsair is in a
whole *lot* of trouble.  And it serves to remind the others that "Crime Does
Not Pay For Long".

        I define "smuggling" IMTU, as "the attempt to circumvent or avoid
lawful application of customs prohibitions and excise duties on a delivered
cargo".  Thus, simply trying to get a load of ATV\'s onto a planet without
paying the customs fees (Planetary Law UWP - 1d = %cargo value fee, min 1%;
Luxury items +2% (Liquor, recreational drugs, artwork, etc.), Medical Items
- -2%) constitues smuggling under UN Law.
        IYTU, YMMV.

I was on this list a _long_ time ago (internet-wise), but had to leave when I
stopped working on my own sci-fi game.  Well, i\'ve returned to working on that
game and I\'m currently working on making some systems for it.  I\'ve found
Traveller, specifically TNE, to be one of the best systems out there and,
instead of re-inventing the wheel, have decided to use it in creating my own
systems.

The problem is that I don\'t have the time to make all the rolls and record the
information.  I was hoping to find a System Generator on the web somewhere,
but the only ones I can find are DOS based.  Does anyone out there know where
I can find a Windows-based program to generate systems (particularly ones that
I can enter my own star types).  Please reply via private e-mail at
noctifer@aol.com.

Thanks for any information you can provide.

Other non-gravitic gizmos :-
Ultrasound probes and directional mikes to check for breathing and
heartbeats.
Millimetre wave cameras.
Gas analysis (CO2 from non-sealed containers? Other breath volatiles??).

Failing this, CT scanning (now that would make for an interesting
customs post).
Neural activity sensors for the really high-tech customs officer.

The other option might be to inspect the container more closely.

"The manifest says there\'s twenty tons of vegetables in that container.
Why is it using a human rated life support system?"

and what wasn\'t, and there are only two kinds of warships in Imperial
space - warships under Imperial command, and warships shot at by
warships under Imperial command. 

(Note that "Imperial command" could mean Imperial Navy, and of the
subordinate Navies, or even the navy of a client state.)

This probably isn\'t a big deal, as a 10-turret missile battery can do
a nasty number on most pirate vessels.

Question for this 10,000tn trade vessel - should it carry it\'s own shuttle
facilities, or will it depend on local capabilities? Or will it only run on
routes that it\'s owning company has prepared with company-operated
port facilities?

        Hi, Walt!
        Spinal mounts, yeah, most definately.  Bays...  depends, to me,
what\'s in them.  A mean missile mount or fusion gun, yes....  if only
because you can do that with turrets.  Particle and meson;  no.  Very Too
Military.

        The shuttle facilities on board mean it doesn\'t matter where it
goes.  It also served as a worst-case price tag for the ship, which was part
of the excercise.

I visited my Dad tonight, and we were talking about farmers. He mentioned
the US Interstate system in the state of Iowa.

It seems that when the highways were being planned, the Department
of Transportation representatives figured out that the major traffic was
between Waterloo and Des Moines - and arranged a public meeting
with the local farm boards to discuss the main highway, to run
southwest from Waterloo to Des Moines. They were nearly lynched
by the irate farmers. After some discussion, the highway planners
agreed to run all the highways in Iowa on straight east-west lines,
unless a river, hill range or other terrain feature (one that also interfered
with farming) got in the way - running a diagonal highway would have
screwed up too much acreage of farm plots.

My point is, the best plan on a map isn\'t necessarily the best plan
in the real world. Not every star system works out as a defendable,
supportable, dependable location for a heavy-use communication
system base, no matter how well placed. Not every well-placed
world has as much clout as a slightly less well-placed world will
have. Some worlds that are currently peaceful members of the
Imperium were rough frontier worlds when the X-Boat link was
built, and haven\'t been re-evaluated as a place to move the link to
yet. A high-pop, vital world may have been undergoing a revolution
or severe civil unrest (Amber/Red zone) when the route was laid,
and missed the chance at hosting an X-Boat route. Heck, there may
even be natural causes - solar radiation that isn\'t dangerous to most
starships, but makes communication too difficult for X-Boat ops?

I like to look at random rolls as idea seeds. Sure, I\'ll toss them when
it suits me - but I like to at least look, and see what ideas they
present. Instead of saying "That X-Boat link is stupid there", I say
"that\'s odd. Why would that X-Boat link go that way instead of this?"

For all that it\'s cinematic the combat system is quite deadly, though. It

Actually, here\'s an interesting TNS entry from Challenge 30...

REGINA/REGINA (0310-A788899-A) Date: 330-1116 

   The ducal household today announced that Duke Norris of Regina will travel
to Rhylanor to meet with representatives from several key worlds in the
Spinward Marches and Deneb sectors. The conference is scheduled to cover
"economic matters", a general term used when the agenda has not been made
public. The exact nature of the meeting has not been disclosed.
   In related matters, a rumor that the Duke has recently received a private
communication from Emperor Strephon has not been confirmed by official
sources. 

10 days later, the Ducal household acknowledges Strephon raising Norris to
Archduke.  It\'s far more likely, IMO, that there was a high level meeting over
"what to do" and that Duchess Delphine, etc etc all had a mean debate that
settled w/ Norris being elevated rather than Norris alone getting the info.
This seems to be a setup for just a theory.  It\'s a good bet the regional
megacorp exec\'s were there.

It wouldn\'t be a real Jump 6 network.  It would still take at least two jumps
(and therefore double duration).  The J-6 couriers would still have an
advantage.  Maybe J-6/drop tank xboats *are* the commercial "Imperial Express
Service."  Could\'ve well been running for years before the assassination.

Isn\'t it 13 (Imperial) Megacorps?  And isn\'t the TJ the *Emperor\'s* private
courier network, not that of the Imperial bureaucracy in general, no? Or is
there another?  Still that\'s a nit, 15 canonical organizations...  Course, the
Imperial Household has a piece in all of them, which just coincidentally
supports the theory of the Iridium Throne keeping J6, at least, controlled...

There is no canonical mention of any restrictions on a J6 private
network,though, is there?  Could the Imperium outlaw J5 and J6 drives for non-
commercial uses (w/o special permission/permit, etc) w/o violating canon?  For
that matter, were jump drives regulated at all?  There were annual maintenance
and licensing... perhaps it\'s never granted to large quantities of J5 and J6
ownership w/o the Imperial Household having a piece of the action?

Very impressive.  I wish I\'d thought of it!

It would work IMTU, just because it\'s so ingenious.  To even try to work
out problems with it would merely be trying to penalise players for
thinking.

	In specific, I\'m intrested in languages of the other alien
species?  How do the Hiver communicate?  Aslani??


	Here are my views.  The Vilani probally have a small number
of languages.  One \'religious tounge\', and one language that evolved
over the years of the First Imperium.  In another 1000s years, if all
goes well, Anglic will probally end up as the only Solomani tounge--
in the meantime, though, i\'d probally put versions of the languages
that belonged to the other major civilizations of the 21st century.

	The Vargr probally have hundreds of languages, though i\'d
imagine that a simple pidgin language that\'s evolved over the
centurys to faciliate trade and such forth over the Extents.  It\'d
be a very simple language, enough to get across simple concepts but
not really communicate in detail.

	The Zhondani are probally like the Third Imperium;  They would
have one language that serves a function simliar to Anglic, and afew
other languages left over from old civilizations.  The Dryone probally
only have one language, and no other forms of communcation of their own.

	
	I\'m not as *sure* about the other races, and am pretty much
at a total loss about how the Hivers *communicate* period, much less
details about their languages...

    Piracy *is* harder to pull off as a career.  Classical
pirates are like predators. They need to be some combination of
bigger, faster, better armed, or stealthier than their targets. 
They also need a safe base to operate from and a place to sell
their ill gotten gains. It\'s easy enough for a peaceful, well settled
imperium to make piracy a very high risk occupation that by 1100 I\'d regard
it as largely a thing of the past. (Find where they go between raids and
park an IN cruiser there: Watch the poor homeless pirates decide to go
somewhere or be something else.)  Periods of expanding frontiers with
merchants racing ahead of the IN or warfare (privateering) are a different
matter.
   Smugglers aren\'t predators, and it\'s very difficult to get rid of them
without hampering more desirable trade. They can use anything between a
personal reentry capsule and an Imperial Dreadnaught, without actually
taking posession of it. The IN doesn\'t have standing orders to shoot at
suspectedsmugglers on sight.  (In some regions it\'s taken for granted
thatevery merchant is, has been, or will be a smuggler sometime). Your
suppliers usually aren\'t running away or shooting back at you, either.
  Worlds can make smuggling a high risk occupation, but if there is no
acceptable substitute for the goods, this just drives the price up and the
greater risk gets a greater reward.

Wouldn\'t the hivers want even bigger turrets just so they could get
in there and fix stuff? That\'s the level I\'m talking about in some
ways. Figuring out what a given alien would take as a baseline
assumption. What kinda room do they need to be able to do damage
control? Do they care?

yeah. But another thing to consider is your enemy. At TL14 or less,
the Zhos need to figure out how they will typically fight a TL15
enemy. Maybe they decide to forgo small turret weapons altogether,
and even their small ships have weapons with maximum DE for the TL
(assuming the TL*50 DE cap in FFS). They might have fewer weapons
per ship, or lower ROFs, but they can do more damage if they do hit.

It is cool because if you can rationalize such a thing it makes
aliens a little more alien. Hell, psychology might play a role in
weapon standards. Tradition as well. Adds a nice flavor, IMO.

  Ooh, democracy in Traveller again!
  
  But seriously, while I think there\'s something to be said for the
sentiment that "representative democracy is no democracy" it may not
be a meaningful complaint to a particular society (e.g., currently 
most of North America).

  Even if a renewed federal Imperium (giggle) would occur and could
decide on some form of scaled representation that wouldn\'t simply be
the imposing of high-pop worlds\' wills directly on others (as opposed
to the indirect system of domination implied by the economic system)
there remains the difficulty of communications (see - this is a Trav
thread!) times.

  Either worlds representatives are powerless due to a requirement for
their constituencies to approve all their actions, or federal powers
are restricted to very little (probably less in theory than the current
Imperial system), or those representatives can bind their worlds to the
agreements they make in their name - which latter makes both planetary
sovereignty and local responsible government somewhat problematic.

  Regardless of said representatives powers, their ability to negotiate
will be severely curtailed, again due to time lags. Those major (hi-tech,
hi-pop) worlds closest to the capital will be best able to ensure that
their own interests prevail, and worlds further from the core will find it
increasingly difficult to negotiate & express their desires before other
parties have determined their preferred course of action and arranged the
support necessary to pass it. Non-participatory democracy without effective
interest aggregation being available to all participants seems problematic.

  The point of having an assembly with any powers when the object appears
simply to be to disguise the perpetuation of the previous systems effects
may escape many of its supposed citizens.

  At the very least there would likely be something functioning like a 
telegraph line operator, possibly combined with various financial services,
unless the ref wants to assume circumstances where there isn\'t any market
for such services beyond those already served by the X-Boat network.

  While a J-6 system requires real money (at least under HG) a mere drop
to J-5 saves a good percentage of that, as not only does the cost per Dt
of ship drop, but you can actually get all that into the minimum 100 Dt
hull at TL F*, at worst requiring some mildly dubious tweaking. Then you
bill people for the privilege of cross-connecting ~high-pop worlds that
happen to be on different X-Boat lines at whatever interval is the most
profitable.

  OTOH, I would accept the possibility that the Imperium (and its\' licensed
commercial subsidiaries) maintains a de facto monopoly on J-5/6 commo, but
that implies a certain type of cynical, power-mad government which I might
find depressingly realistic.

  Or between the handful of high-pop worlds in a typical sub-sector,
and the rest of the sub-sector - can you imagine trying to build a
genuinely workable community out of even as simple a set of stats
(ignoring the cultural aspects) as the Islands Cluster? We tried to
build an Imperium game out of that, and the basic economic research
showed that any three-plus sided campaign would turn into "contain
the Esperanzan gutter-scum"; luckily they\'re only at TL B, but they
have _60%_ of the population of both sub-sectors!

  Which is part of why I\'m in favour of having industrial output for
worlds be non-linear beyond some level under a billion people.

  That I wonder about - we have genuine (theoretically, anyway)
socialist parties, and some other odd quirks, of which official
bilingualism likely would not go away.

  Of course, although the 3I has to worry about separatism, it\'s
a truncated threat due to the lack of a forum for regional issues
to be aired - which begs the question of just how clever was it of
Strephon to re-emphasize the Domains?

  Which presupposes that all such systems are not run for efficiency -
which is difficult enough to believe for the X-Boat system (what was it,
a theoretical J-2.6 per 7 days average?); a commercial system becomes
largely inexplicable under those constraints.

  And don\'t even think what happens if INI actually has a real grip on
anti-piracy tasking and budgets.

  Besides, as far as I can see the major side-effect of actually
having reasonable internal security is that major starship related
crimes become fairly difficult :)

Just the canon references here... one of the TravLang types can probably
give sources developed from there...

The CT Alien module series (all of them except Solomani) makes reference to
languages. These same also give word generation tables for the respective
languages.

Several JTAS articles cover different aspects... one gives dialectical
differentiation. One covers some aspects of Vilani language.

MT sources include more details on Trokh (Aslan).

Some notes:
Vilani, according to JTAS, is tonal, using 6 tones, and inflected thusly.
(From JTAS, and questionable, but I like it).

Trokh is spoken both on the in and out breath motions. The appropriate
break-points are importnat, especially in poetry. There are two written
forms, one for males and one for females. (The flowing letters of the male
script are what we normally see... the female script is more of a block
printing.)

Gveh is one of several related languages of the Gvurrdon area.

Hivers are mute. They communicate by touch and hand-waving (sign-language).
The entire hiver interstellar nation state uses hiver glyphs (the written
form of the hiver "Language") as the lingua franca, especially for
contracts. Hivers are not deaf. They can hear, and thus learn to
understand, spoken language. Hiver language is definitely not scent
based... only about half of all hivers can smell.

JTAS suggests that the farther from the mains, the more divergent the
locals use of galanglic should be. Mechanics of the article are for CT.

In CT, languages could be learned, and were on a 1-12 scale, and didn\'t
count against the "experience limit" (Source, alien module 1: Aslan). In
MT, language ability was implied to be boolean: each level of linguistics
allowed you to speak one additional language; linguistics counts against
the experience limit. In TNE, each language was a separate skill, and there
is noe Experience limit. Didn\'t pay enough attention in T4.

===IMTU Seperator===
IMTU, I use MT mechanics; I have occasionally utilized the following tweak:
each reciept of a linguistics provides 1d6 levels of a language and a level
of linguistics, OR 2d6 levels of language and NO liguistics level.
Languages don\'t count against the experience limit. Linguistics does.
Native language is spoken at 12, or both at 6+1d6 each if bilingual, or
4+1d6 if tri-lingual. I require some justification for bi- and tri-lingual
characters. I also assume that many worlds have a local dialect of
galanglic, usually causing a 1-3 level reduction in capability between
locals and non-locals. (This is based upon the JTAS article mentioned
above.)

Flip to the economics rules in Striker Book 2. They have GDP number for
various TLs, modifiers for Trade Codes, and exchange rates between various
worlds. Plus annual costs of soldiers of various qualities.

Book 3 has lots of good gearhead stuff, and lots of pre-built infantry gear.

Ah yes, but your payment should be so much less, because our TL11 world

Well, balanced against this is the fact that you only burn ammo while in
combat, and the smaller power plant makes you cheaper. Basically, two
lasers = 1 missile + 1 sandcaster, with the plus of being more flexible,
but the minus of needing power.

40 year old merchant ships are entirely believable in my book. Personally,
I reduce the Cr 2000/jump \'life support costs\' and increase annual

I do. Check out the US stock market in the 1950s, for example. In any case,
low interest rates are good for gaming, becuase if you can only get 1%
clipping coupons, then speculative investments (like, say, your Third
Cousin Alledon\'s Frontier Trader) get to be a much more justifiable
investment.

One of the concequences of technological development in Traveller is that
transport costs go down. I dont know what the exact numbers are, but it is
true as a trend.

HG has those lovely \'Fuel Tanks Shattered\' crits, doesnt it ... what are
the odds of at least one of those corsairs being left for dead in the
water, ready for boarding ? Adds insult to injury for the pirates when the
freighter boards *them*, doesnt it ...

Seriously, a free market should eventually pitch freight rates at an
appropriate level to compensate for risk. The alternatives would be
freighter owners deciding to mothball their ships until things improved, or
flee to a Safe of one sort or another, or face de facto nationalisation by

This is too high to be believable IMO, unless you are in the midst of a
Civil War or similar. Give me a budget for our B starport, and I think I
can make life uncomfortable for pirates in that system. Also, remember that
historically piracy has been a sign of healthy trade and expanding economies.

The next question is what percentage of those pirates are hard enough to
take on a National class ? Piracy is a business, and I can see a big
downside in tangling with something like a National ...

Of course there might be some Jump-6 couriers owned by others than the
Emperor, but IMHO the Imperium would outlaw a Imperium wide Jump-6
Courier Network on the basis of internal security. Enourmous hills
of documents to be filled. numerous comitees, subcomittes to win over.
And so on. If the Emperor wants to keep his Jump-6 Courior Fleet to
himself I think he will get it. Anything else will be seen as an open
act of aggression by the nobles.

I was more thinking of the Emperors corporation from M0 when I said
*the Imperial Megacorp* (singular). I only own some TNE and T4 stuff,
everything else is pick up from reading TML and a lot of webpages.
I get the impression that the Emperors corp is something you keep
out of the way of. Even the other megacorps deal carefully with it, and
makes sure that they don\'t take to many contracts in competition with 
it. You could say that I view the Court (including the Megacorps) much
as the Centauri from B5. There is much infighting, murder, deception,
but nobody dears threathen the Emperor, his house or his companies.

Able to pay and willing do they get the chance, but the Imperium is a 
long time monarchy, where the Emperor is much like a god. One does not
oppose or speak against him, his word is law, his family and busniesses
are holy. It is only for him to have the best.

The idea behind having the ship commissioned was something along the lines
of a National is my idea of a Subsidised Merchant. Self-escorting, jump-2,
and a big enough cargo bay to make a difference to the worlds en route (if
you just want a mail packet, use a Type S or a type A2). The National comes
damn close to being self-financing as well.

I can see why the IN would want to regulate heavy firepower, but I can also
see how His Grace, the Duke of Everywhen may want to write to his Cousin,
the Admiral, advising him that His Personal Yacht, the National Prosperity,
was going on a cruise under the command of his nephew, and would he mind
signing this exemption ?

The other solution is to declare it a Naval Auxilary, and put a
commissioned Lieutenant in charge of the missile bay, plus a double squad
of Marines to board any pirates silly enough to tangle with it.

Personally, I think that the port should have the surface-orbit assets, but
the National class carries a big shuttle. Hmmm, I wonder what overhead
re-entry capable cargo containers should have ?

  I\'m not sure if many megacorps have their own networks of scheduled
couriers as opposed to having such vessels available at sector HO\'s
or the like - at this stage that may not yet be covered.

  If a corp (even a sub- or sector wide one) had its\' own regular
network, then they would have to have a good reason not to use it
to generate revenue by carrying others\' messages on it.

  IIRC, someone claimed that no tramp trader would send a message
ahead to announce their intended arrival (plus cargo and passenger
manifests where applicable) as it would be unthinkable to send a
message via another merchant ship.

  Of course, such a theory is clearly outmoded by the principle that
"most mail will, in fact, go on the self same commercial ships", i.e.,
tramp traders?

  If the X-Boat system is the fastest form of commo for most info then:
a) most info is almost completely time-insensitive, including from the
customers POV, b) the X-Boat system does run very much closer to 100%
efficiency for all but the lowest priority data, or c) the system is
broken and the backup "suspension of disbelief" damper has to be fed
the new suppression mission specs.

 OC, the above doesn\'t preclude a restrictive attitude towards J-5/6 units.

I dislike the Ship Patron advantage.  I can\'t put my finger on "why" I 
dislike it, but I do.  However....

I really like this idea!  

How about:

Ships could have a Reputation, either good or bad.  Or ship classes 
could have a Rep.  This could affect the value of the ship.  It could 
affect the amount and type of cargo people would be willing to ship.  "I 
dunno if I\'m willing to send my precious cargo of fleep in *that* 
thing."

Or, it could possibly affect crew performance.  

For instance, lets say the Stickley class patrol boat has a -1 
Reputation for being a lousy design.  Whenever a ship related task is 
rolled for, the crew member in question must roll IQ or less to avoid a 
- -1 to the skill roll.  

Don\'t like that?  Hmmmm.  How about any crew with the Superstitious 
disad instead of all crew....

And... and... if I only had my books with me I\'m sure I could come up 
with plenty of variations. 

:^)

<snip>

So let me see...

I make the X-boats for the Imperium.
Someone invents J-5
I could:
	a) lobby to get the whole thing replaced with (more expensive) J-5,
	b) lobby to just replace the old ships with new ones as they wear out.

When you consider the advantages of (a): your could use the now redundant
J-4s on shorter feeder links thus expanding the service (and the future
per year replacement bill \'cos there are more ships.)

by 1116 and a successive upgrade to J-6 you would have spare J-5 ships
and probably X-boats for each of J-1 to J-6 (there are enough routes
that the savings on J-1 ships for J-1 routes should be enough).

Then all the worlds would actually have regular Imperial contact.

Also you could use X-boats with fuel for two jumps on routes to small
worlds at J-1 through J-4 distances and do round trips without needing
a base at both ends.

Finally, the 3I should be able to replan the X-boat route every 100 years
or so (after all, you don\'t remove service, just add additional long jumps.)
They\'re not totally Vilani after all. :-)

Conclusion:
Either
	the J-4 X-boats are just an example (the type most frequently encountered)
	and J-6 boats exist (but there are only a few running the main routes)
	and the X-boat network is optimised for travel times (using warships,
	bases in empty hexes and feeder lines to all planets using ships capable
	of two successivejumps.)
OR
	The Imperium keeps J-5 and J-6 to itself.
	The X-boat network is designed to be worse than it could.
	The Emperor, the Navy and the Megacorps have an information advantage.

Choices, choices.

The trouble here is IMO that that implies a government power-mad enough to
go to enormous trouble to keep a jump-6 monopoly, but lax enough to allow
independent smugglers and pirates, and which for some inexplicable reason
use the slow X-boat network instead of faster private network for its
official correspondance. 

There may be Imperiums that are so tightly controlled that they can and do
prevent the existence of private jump-6 networks, but IMO it is not the
same Imperiums that allow pirates to run riot and private trade wars all
over the place.

It looks like your conception of the nature of the Imperium and the Emperor\'s
status is too different from mine to let us have a meaningful discussion.
Suffice it to say that I don\'t find any support in any canonical sources
for the Emperor being a God-Emperor.

However, there is at least one canonical organisation with the means and the
incentive, indeed, the obligation, to set up a jump-6 network: The Imperial
Navy. Even if no commercial or civilian network exist, I\'d say that data
about ships that are in violation of Imperial law would be a legitimate
load for an IN network, wouldn\'t you?

I didn\'t say it was a very good explanation. It\'s just the best I could come
up with. And it isn\'t totally silly. There\'s no guarantee that just because
you can make jump-4 ships you can upgrade to TL 14 ships. Many of those
shipyards could\'ve been facing the total loss of their contracts to other
yards if the Imperium decided to upgrade the X-boat network. And there\'s
another thing. A lot of planets would lose their X-boat stations if the
jump numbers were to change. Still, I admit that it is a cheesy explanation.
If you can suggest a better one, go ahead.

I agree with you 100%. Yet the fact remains that the X-boat network DO use
jump-4 ships in 1100. How do you explain that?

Now that is how things work IMTU. But in the OTU the X-boats are clearly
said to be jump-4, period.

Not possible. It is canonical that the Imperium allow planetary navies. Any
TL 15 planet is able to build and use their own jump-6 couriers.

>    The X-boat network is designed to be worse than it could.

No, it was designed to be as efficient as possible back when it was built.
That fits with the canonical descriptions of how the Imperium is straining
under the stress of the communication times between the periphery and the
core. What dosen\'t fit is that the major links haven\'t been upgraded.

>    The Emperor, the Navy and the Megacorps have an information advantage.

That\'s 15 different sets of people right there. It is said that two people
can keep a secret if one of them is dead. That\'s an exaggeration, but not
much of one. An advantage you share not with 14 other people, but with 14
other GROUPS of people is not much of an advantage.

We have a house rule that we don\'t award any points for disadvantages.
When we say you can build a 150 point character that is 150 points in
attributes, advantages, and skills. 

What happens that the GMs of our group can assign the disadvantages based
on the character\'s role-playing. Usally the GM limits this to 40 points
worth. For the physical disadvantage what happens in-game happens in-game
so if a character winds up lame he winds up lame. The upside is that if
the character finds a cure he doesn\'t have to spend the next X xp toward
getting rid of disadvantages.

Racial, and template disadvantages are not affected by this rule.

What we all found is that the players that can\'t role-play well. Well..
their role-playing ability remains minimal. The players who want to
role-play the disadvantages will any way. Since our group is a mix of
both we decided it would more fair and fun for everyone that we do this.

What has happened is that character come in game with one and two
disadvantages and by the end of the second and third adventure it is
usally quite obivous what the other disadvantages are. The nice thing it
makes for better characters because your initial conception never survives
100% from the first adventure. As you role-play your first couple of games
the character alters as you better understand what you are trying to do
and what the gamemaster\'s world is like.

Of course for some of the players in my group seem to wind up with the
same disadvantages time and time again. For one guy the entire group was
unanimous that his next character was to have the common sense advantage.
So we can the right to explain to him why the action he just blurted out
was so bone-headed and too take it back.

Zhunastu Enterprises do not survive into 1100. There is no information on
what happens to it (my own theory is that it goes down the tubes during the
Civil War), but it definitely isn\'t around any longer. Instead, the Imperial
Family (exactly which members of the IF is unspecified) owns stock in all
Megacorporations (except one, and IMTU that is a misprint) and all the (four
or five) lesser interstellar corporations of which I\'ve seen breakdowns of
stock ownership. In some of them the IF ownership is as low as 2%, in others
it is considerably more. (IMTU the price of getting an interstellar charter
is to give the Emperor 2% of your stock(known as "The Emperor\'s Share").
That\'s what finances the Imperial Bureaucracy IMTU).

Depends on how you define "ready", but there\'s _lots_ of stuff available.
Traveller has always provided a fair amount of information on languages.

Every alien module contained a system allowing you to generate words with
a unique \'feel\' - except Hivers, who use a gestural language.

Look up the old CT/MT/TNE alien modules for more information.

The idea of the self-escorting Naval Auxiliary is interesting, it costs
quite a bit more to put that missile bay in a 1500-2500dtn hull of
it\'s own (an escort frigate).

To answer Steve Hudson\'s question on how I break it down, what\'s
Imperial Fleet and what isn\'t:

The usual Imperial, Sector, and Subsector fleets are considered
Imperial fleets for purposes of determining whether they can have
warships or not. Planetary Navies can have warships with spinal
mounts and bay weapons if the jump capable ones are incorporated
into the Imperial command structure. System defense forces
(monitors and SDB\'s) aren\'t really worried about much, they\'re not
considered a force projection threat - though there may be planets
that have misbehaved in the past and aren\'t allowed such dangerous
toys.

So, Regina could have it\'s own Battlecruiser Squadron, if it were part
of the Regina Subsector Colonial Fleet. Another thing that keeps some
planets from building their own jump-capable warships: since they\'re
incorporated at some level into the Imperial Fleet command structure,
procedures are in place for an Imperial Admiral to take them away from
you, probably when you\'d most rather they didn\'t.

        Well, our MCr4475.95 National, if bought at a TL11 Class A port in a
TL15 game, costs MCr2685.57.  This makes the PPT Breakpoint a very
easy-to-swallow Cr748/ton.  So, at our broken Cr1000/ton, we make MCr35 per
year, and at Cr250 + Cr500/parsec we make MCr70 per year, and at Cr750 +
Cr500/parsec we make MCr140 per year.  Those are then 1%, 3% and 5% rates of
return, respectively.

        I think something between first and last.  Riskier areas cost more,
and you are more liable to have organized covoys protected by SDB\'s or
destroyers between the jump-point, gas giant and the main world;  convoy
protection paid for by the system that otherwise wouldn\'t see anything but
smugglers.

        IMTU, the Frontier is a squabling ground between major corporations
trying to set up Colonies on choice worlds before The Other Corp does.  As a
result, much "piracy" is in fact "Privateering", complete with ships being
paid by the ton of "kill".
        The Serpent-class ship I just posted to my website is a purpose
designed ship for exactly this purpose...  the plasma guns in the nose
generally leave very little to board and plunder...
        Now, no Serpent crew in thier right mind would pick a fight with our
National....  6 crits per hit from the missle bay?  OOOOOOOOuch!  Then
again, the Serpent is Agility 5...

>The next question is what percentage of those pirates are hard enough to
>take on a National class ? Piracy is a business, and I can see a big
>downside in tangling with something like a National ...

       See above comments =).  Again, IMTU, since the Terran Sphere is very
young (85 years since jump technology went public), ship sizes are *small*
compared to the Imperium.  The UN-Deep Space Navy\'s pride and joy is the
"County"-class striker carrier at a whooping 1200 dtons, packing more
firepower than any three patrol cruisers and an unbelieveable 30 "Typhoon"
class fighters!
        You could hangar three of these in the cargo bay of the National.
        Now, in about 100 years, after the scheduled war is over and the
panic of trying to build bigger and better capital ships is over, we\'ll be
seeing the odd 100Kdton dreadnaught, and the odd 10Kdton merchant at the
Frontier.
        In the meantime, it is 200-ton frieghters, 300-ton escorts and
400-ton patrol cruisers and corsairs.  In short, MTU is the *perfect*
climate for smuggling and piracy/privateering.  There are no x-boats,
maximum jump is 2, starving under-defended colonies all over the Fronier,
and the Core a comfortable 3+ months away at maximum speed.  Local corporate
facility administrators being the un-monitored Top Dog over an entire star
system, save the odd review by an out-of-favor UN Political Officer and
visit by an UN-CMC Corp on "excercise".  Think Spanish Carribean, circa 1700\'s.

Give me a little credit, Walt. I\'m not talking about taking a dot map and
drawing six-parsec lines between sector capitals. What I am talking about
is just precisely to take a good look at the planets that ought to be able
to support defendable, dependable heavy-use communication bases and working

Of course not. But that dosen\'t explain all the undefendable, undependable
systems in odd places that do have an X-boat link. Nor does it explain the
places where two systems, BOTH WITH X-BOAT STATIONS, lying less than four
parsecs from each other still don\'t have a link.

A high-pop, vital world would rate a link for its own sake. How long does it
take to establish an X-boat link to a suitable world? Years to make the
decision, perhaps decades (though that is stretching my willing suspension
of disbelief to the breaking point). Certainly not a generation.

>Heck, there may even be natural causes - solar radiation that isn\'t

>for X-Boat ops?

The point is, just what is the purpose of the X-boat network? We\'re told
that the Imperium is straining under the communication lag and that the
X-boat network was concieved to relieve that strain. Granted that that may
not be the truth (IIRC it is in a Library Data entry and not in a piece of
Referee\'s information), can you come up with a believable explanation why
the central authorities wouldn\'t want as efficient a communication network
as possible? What possible gain can outweigh the risks involved in having
communication times be about twice what it could be? And if you say that

That\'s exactly what I do. I think that random generation is a splendid 
servant, but it makes a very poor master. In other words, by all means
start out by using random generation, but after that go over them and
reality-check them (well, consistency-check ;-).

However in the specific case of X-boat links, the question I ask myself
most often is "That\'s odd. Why is the communication time between those
two capitals twice the time it could be at half the cost?"

And when I can\'t come up with an explanation, THEN I toss it.

I agree. Especially when you consider that even if Norris had been the sole
reciever of the advance notice (which, as I said, is an assumption I don\'t
agree with), then the Domain would get the news eventually and anyone who
knew about the existence of secret couriers would be able to count backwards
and figure out that exactly what Norris\' had done.

I don\'t quite follow you. Some nodes lies exactly four parsecs apart and
would not benefit from increased jumps, but others lie six parsecs apart,
necessitating two jumps-4 (Two jumps-3, actually. I\'m not at all sure that
economics of scale and the convenience of sticking to one model only would
outweigh the saving of having special lower-jump X-boats for shorter links,
but I\'m not prepared to argue the point. Anyway, that\'s by the way.) which
could be replaced by one jump-6. But the real saving lies in the primary
distribution runs, the \'core-to-border\' runs.

Yes, I think you\'re right.

No, that\'s right. But that begs the question. If the Imperial Bureaucracy
uses the X-boat network, why is the X-boats not optimized? That\'s sort of
like hamstringing THEMSELVES. If the X-boats are purely civilian traffic,
you could justify the IB screwing with it to get that precious advantage
(maybe), but then there would be an official IB network too, wouldn\'t there?
Either that or they use the IN network, which comes to the same thing.

Having 2% of the stock in a company is not the same as controlling it.

None that I can recall.

I\'d say that depends on how controlling you think the canon makes the
Imperium ;-).

One of the characteristics of a megacorporation is that it is too large
for the central management to excersise much control of the regional
managers. The Imperial Family may have a piece of the action, but I doubt
that they would have control.

I disagree with the last bit. Historically ambassadors and envoys were
endowed with plenipotentiary powers precisely because of that problem
(communication lag) and their respective countries managed to retain
their sovereignty.

Of course, they reneged on their treaties all the times, but that problem
IMO arose from the nature of sovereign power rather than the deficiencies
of the treaty-making process.

Come to that, individuals who let their lawyers work out a deal is in much
the same position.

From: Craig Barnett <craig_barnett@iname.com>
Subject: GT: Ship Design Question
As I see it, turrets and bays are assigned in one step of the process
with each turret and bay having their own space, mass and cost (ie, 1
space for turrets, 20 spaces for bays, etc). Individual weapons are
added in a later step, and have their own space requirements, mass and
cost (ie, 1 space for each laser in a turret, 50 spaces for a bay, etc).
How does this work?  Up to three weapons are supposed to fit in a
turret, so how can three 1 space lasers fit into a 1 space turret? Or a
50 space bay weapon into a 20 space bay? Are these figures for turrets,
bays and weapons inclusive (say, 1 space for the turret and it\'s
associated bits and pieces, + 1 additional space for each extra weapon
in the turret), or is there something I\'m missing?
******************
The turrets and bays are external to the ship. the one space is rotation
space for the turret and a gunner station.  The turret takes up one space
inside the ship, and would provide 3 spaces outside the ship.  The bay
works the same way.

Very good point about TAS.  And it\'s interesting to note that TAS is
a \'private\' organization, not part of the government.  (Note that in 
the American revolution it was the \'private organizations\' that first
responded to British atrocities!)

However, TAS can only remain a somewhat effective defense 
against unreasonable search and confiscation only as long as 
the Imperium allows free speech.

Huh? How will altering the deck height chance a problem with distances?

I was commenting on the problem of a 1-yard grid, and the fact my group
didn\'t like converting yards to metres, and didn\'t like the 10% slop in
saying "1 yard = 1 metre". I figured that if the artist was willing to
overlay a different grid that would solve the problem. (Yes, we\'d rather
have corridor walls in the middle of a square/hex than have the length of
the hull calculated wrong. Like I said, iron-ringed gearheads.)

Interesting. Genetic engineering biotech advances are canon (especially
the Solomani species uplift projects) in the OTU, but live-person 
gengineering is not usually mentioned. It may be that the OTU places 
gengineering a mature, living being into the realm of nanotechnology, 
which is tech level 16+ (beyond normal Imperial maximums), perhaps
due to some currently unknown law of quantum physics.

An aside: _Barlowe\'s Guide to Extraterrestrials_ has a species known
as the Dextrans, from a book I haven\'t found yet (_Right hand of Dextra_?).
These giant plant-like beings are very intelligent, telepathic, and telekinetic.
One of their tricks is to put a living being into one of their large leaves,
dump some kind of lif-support liquid over them, and then use a combination
of liquid secretions and telekinesis to change the creature at will (or even 
at whim). Physical changes, genetic changes, whatever the Dextran had
in mind - and of course, the Dextrans would have very alien minds to get
"improvement" ideas from. I\'d like to read the book to see what these
critters had in mind, or what their other attitudes were - I\'d hate it if such
an interesting species idea ended up with some cliche humanesque
psychology.

If the 3i discovered these beings, would they sterilize the planet or
just red-zone it?

What I\'m looking for is a viable design.  The hull shape
doesn\'t suggest specific needs other than the ones I 
posted.  It\'s been so long since I played, however, that
I don\'t recall if it makes tactical or EP sense to put a 
100 ton Meson or Particle Accelerator Bay and/or
a repulsor bay on a 2000-2400 ton low jump & slow
maneuvering ship.  If it does, then do so... Otherwise
just make it a design you think would make sense.

btw: The hull shape is modeled after a bathtub water-
works toy enjoyed by a 2 year old who eats my food,
wrecks my living room, and keeps me up at night.

Why don\'t you use 5\'/1.5 meter grids? I thinks that\'s 3% slop or so

Subject: Deca-class freighters
Couple of comments first.
First, there is this rumour that ship costs have gone down in G:T. They
havent - the fact you dont have to buy a power plant is compensated for by
the fact you do have to pay for fuel tankage (and serious money, too). You
seem to need more maneuver drives under G:T as well.
**************8
the costs on some of the ships have gone down.  A free trader for example
is only 27MCr.  Fuel tankage can add up, and more manuver dirves are needed
because you need to provide thrust for the mass of the ship ratehr than the
volume.



Secondly, streamlining is vicious in G:T, at 20% of total volume, no
discounts. Unless this has been errata\'d, I would argue it should be a 20%
increase in surface area (in effect, a 20% loss of DR), with no effect on
volume as such. Volume is only really a concept that applies in jump space,
and jump space doesnt care what shape you are, just how much volume you
take up.
************
What is actualy is is a 25% increase in surface area, with the effect of
taking up more room in a spacedock and having to extend the jump feild to
cover the streamlined shape.




OK, now the GT Decafreighter (GTL 10).

Hull : 170 t, MCr 8.5
20 000t armour : 20 000t, MCr 60 <DR 2353>
*************
Way too much DR, the \'min\' for the ships is 100, this a DR I would expect
on a warship. DR of 2100 is enough to stop average damage from a TL10
Laser.






Command Bridge : 2 dt, 20.3t, MCr 9.6
Basic Bridge : 2.5 dt, 8.6 t, MCr 4
**************8
two bridges make it a viable auxillary.



Utility : 1 dt, 11.5 t, MCr 0.3
**********8
20 of these are needed to provide for the entire ship. They are of real use
in the cargo bay as they prevent shifiting of cargo.


PAW Bay : 50 dt, 467t, MCr 22.9
10 Triple Lasers : 10 dt, 319t, MCr 20.4
*************
consider traading the PA bay for 10 triple sandcaster turrets, very helpful
in PD.

Also consider heavy compartmentalization.



Crew is : 52 - 8 Command, 22 Maneuver, 8 Jump, 2 Missile, 2 PAW, 10
Lasers/Stewards. 8 single staterooms, 22 double staterooms. 120 passengers.
*************8
I get (Assuming 8 command are Captain, 1st O, 2 Pilots, 2 Sensor and 2
commo) 27 Engineering, 13 gunners (PAW needs only one) for 4 single
(Captain, 1st O, Cheif Engineer, and Head Steward/Gunner) and 22 double.
You can add 8 Steward/Cargo, and keep the passengers the same.

Remember that you can carry 240 middle passangers instead fo high.


Reworking the stats with my suggestions gives

DecaFreighter
Crew: Captain (Leadership, Tactics), 1st Officer (Leadership, Tactics), 2
Pilots (Pilot Starship),  2 Navigators (Astrogation), 2 Sensor (Electronics
Operation [Sensors]), 2 Communications (Electronics Operation [Commo]), 27
Engineering (Engineering, Mechanic), 22 Steward/Gunners (Gunner [Beam or
Missile]). for 5 single (Captain, 1st O, 2ed O. [either a navigator or a
pilot] Cheif Engineer, and Head Steward/Gunner) and 27 double. 120 High
Passengers.

10,000 Space Hull, 100DR, Heavy Compartmentalisation, Command Bridge, Basic
Bridge, Engineering, 1,100 Manuver, 200 Jump, 1,000 Fuel, LowBerth, 152
Staterooms, 2 SickBay, 20 Utility, 20 Turrets, Weapons Bay 30 Lasers, 30
Sandcasters, Missile Bay, 7,031 Cargo.

Statistics:  EMass 8712.4, LMass 43867.4, Cost 1,040.816MCr, HP 255,000.

Performance: Accel 1.00 Gs, Jump 1, Air Speed USL, Size Modifier +12.

This Model is faster in system, and has much better defenses against
missiles. Price is a tad lower, but the crew is a bit higher so that should
ballance out. (4.34 MCr/month)










Now, if you rip 1000 dton of cargo, 100 dton of maneuver you can take it up
to jump-2 by adding 100 dton of Jump and 1000 dton of JFuel. Mass is
60060t, cost is MCr 1539. Crew goes up by a net 2 (lose 2 maneuver techs,
gain 4 Jump techs). A payment is MCr 6.41 a month, so it looks like it is
viable at around CR 600/Cr 4000 net. The ship still pulls about 2/3rds of a
gee.
**************8
Mass 40,227.4 Cost 1,495MCr Engineering crew is 29 (net +2) Accel is 0.99
Gs Payment is 6.23 MCr/month.


If you go for jump-3, you get 1900 dton less of cargo, 300 dtons less of
maneuver, 200 dtons more of jump, 2000 dtons more of Jump fuel, for a net
mass of 56 580t, a net cost of MCr 1983. The smaller M-drive means the ship
pulls 0.55 gees, and the crew is 54 (eight more jump techs, 6 less maneuver
techs).
A payment in this case is MCr 8.27, so it looks to be viable at about Cr
850 for cargo, net Cr 6000 for passengers.
***************
with 900 MDrive and cargo of 5031, it pulls 0.98Gs  31 engineering crew
(net +4) Mass is 36,587.4 cost is 1,949MCr Payment is 8.12MCr



Hrm.... If we drop the accell to 0.5 Gs ....

with 480 MDrive and cargo of 5451, it pulls 0.52Gs  24 engineering crew
(net -3) Mass is 37,259.4 cost is 1,882MCr, Payment is 7.84MCr



I bet we can make the original J1 ship really cheap by cutting to 0.5 G....
with 600 MDrive and cargo of 7531, it pulls 0.54Gs  18 engineering crew
(net -9) Mass is 44,667.4 cost is 961MCr, Payment is 4MCr

The Stellar Diameter tables were for some reason left out of WBH. However, they can be found in CT Book 6: Scouts, p. 45

Very nice. My players came up with another evil defense against
psi-teleporters. In this scenario, they knew basically were the teleporter
would teleport to, if at all, so they basically rigged the whole room with
metal sticks from floor to ceiling and very close.

This way, there was no way for a person to exist between the sticks inside the
room. A teleporter would have teleported into the sticks and met a messy end.
Luckily (hmm... I controlled her) for her, she incidentally chose another
action.

Off course, this defense renders the room in question useless until the defense
is removed again, but I still thought it was a neat idea, and it worked in this
scenario.

	Kinda.  I tryed running Traveller:  the New Era awhile ago,
but it didn\'t turn out very well.  I never ended up getting any
traveller books except the main \'New Era\' book;  until G:T.

	Ohhh :) Cool.  That helps alot, about the Hivers and their
gestural languages.  :)  Other than that, it seems like the aliens
have mainly one language per race;  something that I won\'t be using
in my game.  :)  Anyways, I\'ll probally post my language information
to the list before long.

Excuse my ignorance, what\'s WBH (world building what?)  ?

> Did I miss something ? If not is there any way to generate, or gage
> stellar diamiter from Stellar mass or stellar type ?

Yes, IIRC my astronomy course (i\'ve read this things i\'ll post in a book i have now at
my hands, so it should be right), a star\'s luminosity is direct dependant of the
square of the radius and also of the fourth exponent of it\'s surface temperature.

L = k * (radius)^2 * (surface T)^4

where k is a constant (which i don\'t know).

The temperature is deduced from it\'s absortion/emision spectra lines, but a star
apparent bright we receive depends on it\'s real luminosity and the distance at which
it is...and this distance is not easily measured for far stars, and IIRC it may have
real great error, since distance estimations are build up on several assumptions,
which are also based on other suppositions...

Stars in the main sequence, that is, that burn hidrogen as the main energy source to
counteract gravity collapse, range from 1/10000 to 10000 solar luminosities, with
surface temperatures from 3000 kelvins to 30000 kelvins, Sol has about 5000 kelvins.

This is a table of stars type and their T in kelvins

type   T     solar mass   solar luminosity

O    30000
B    20000      10             44000
A    10000      2.3               23
F     8000
G     6000      1.1              1.4
K     4000
M     3000      0.1          0.00006

I\'ve got a table (long) of nearby stars, with its parallax in arcsec (inverse of the
distance in parsecs of a star) and the aparent magnitude (with the distance data you
can calculate the absolute magnitude and then find the intrinsec luminosity) so if
you\'re interested, i can email you privately, with the calculations to do to find the
luminosity, and so you can have a way of finding the radius of those stars...

It\'s a long work to do, anyway, and as it interests me maybe i\'ll make it...but i\'ve
no time these days.

Hope it helps.

Comments wellcomed.

There is a Galactic program mailing list where people who work in sectors for galactic write their
projects. It\'s not so posts prolific as this is, it has passed a couple of months since i got the
last post, but you can ask there to get an answer.

To subscribe write to

majordomo@indiana.edu

and with empty subject, write in the body of the text

subscribe burdickd_galactic@indiana.edu

and remember not to include any of these signature file people attachs to the end of their posts.


I can tell you that, unless something has changed without me noticing it (wich it well could be),
that nobody has written a public file for Malorn sector for TNE in galactic, as i was the last who
asked to, but due to the features of my "ideal" sector, this was too close to imperium.

Hope it helps.

Huh? How will altering the deck height chance a problem with distances?

if you make the height of each deck less. changing it from 2.77m to 2.36m
then the volume of the ship is the same and the yard wide hexes are now

OK, but (a) how do you armour the turrets/bays? Presumably using the volume
of the weapons they contain, but that\'s not clear.

(b), more importantly - how do you calculate jump drive/fuel? After all,
that\'s the single most important thing volume is used for (since maneuver
performance in G:T is mass-based.) A ship with "full" turrets and/or bays
could be about 3% bigger in total volume than its basic hull size indicates - 
so its jump drive will be 3% undersized (and its jump fuel.) Admittedly,
this sounds trivial (although for a thousand-ton jump-six ship it would
be 18 tons, which isn\'t negligible) but it\'s ambiguous; and it could be much,
much, much more of a problem for people who do G:V designs and have bigger
bays and/or ignore the hardpoint limit.

I am currently hard at work on a new Traveller site dedicated to the 
Project: StarRise campaign.  Last year, I converted to 
the use of MicroSoft\'s FrontPage 97 (now 98), and really enjoy using 
it.  I\'ve also recently located the Software Developer\'s Kit which 
allows me to design my own themes for the website, and I came up with 
an idea for developing a Traveller theme for the new site.  Since my 
artistic abilities are not the greatest, and I want to avoid 
reinventing the wheel, I wanted to ask a few obvious questions before 
I started on this project:

1)  Has someone already developed a Traveller or Science-Fiction 
theme for MS FrontPage that I could use?

2)  If so, where could I get ahold of it?

3)  If not, is anyone else with more artistic talent interested in 
pursuing this?

Please send me e-mail privately, as I do not want to take away from 
the excellent discussions of this List.

Thank you very much,

Actually, it almost certainly is a typo -- it probably should be 10 (rotation
space for a 25,000 cf full-rotation turret).  Note that you can, if you wish,
install bays _internally_ to a ship, in which case you don\'t need to armor them
separately -- however, this hurts their field of view.  I did it with the
missile bays on the azhanti high lightning, since direction of fire really
doesn\'t matter all that much for the type of missiles available in GT.

You armor it based on the area of the turret/bay, which is 800 for the turret,
6500 for the bay.  This seemed relatively clear (and they did address in the
text having a different armor level for the body and the turrets).

That one is a problem, I chose to assume that jump-drives can actually exceed
computed performance by about 5%.

Well for MTU, i only use Hivers for command crew (and not even all of them).
The rest is various member races of the Federation (there are supposed to be
170... wow), who are a bit more agile.  Even so, I had their turrets remote
controlled (usually in batteries) via MFD, though they still require
maintenance.  I\'ve intended to make a couple more, but never got around to it.
Maybe i should put that on the queue. ; )

Yeah, things like that would be a factor, but in general, most of the
Traveller races fit in a relatively hominid mode (not as bad as ST or even B5
after the 1st season (when they stopped using the Mantis guy, etc)), excepting
the K\'kree and Hivers (and Droyne, to an extent), and Traveller hasn\'t touched
on this before.  

There would be design philosophies according to powers & species, but this
would vary more by the particulars rather than generalities IMO.  Excepting
abberations like the K\'kree, and their requirements of quite large ships, of
course. : )

All interesting concepts.  In a PE game I reffed for my group (i started them
all at TL9 in a single sector), they went from scratch... i worked out a tech
advancement system (all the alternate tech from FF&S available too) based
roughly on an in-depth analysis of the computer game, Ascendancy.  Battles
were run using Battle Rider (on this large hex mat i bought... took nearly a
month to complete a *massive* battle at one races homeworld).   They\'re not
Traveller grognards, though, so it was interesting watching them try out all
kinds of concepts, so I can shed whole wads of experience on things like
fighters etc.  The best player got to like TL-11, though none of them had
really used the Battle Rider concept, though i was trying to hint on that and
other things.  In fact, I had jump drive the most readily acquired so few of
them kept an active r&d program beyond improving efficiency of their existing
tech.   It was fun, but it petered out as we were growing increasingly
disatisfied w/ PE.

I\'ve already thought of alot of alterations to the tech program, in particular
(making things more open-ended, especially in regards to the alternate tech, i
was relatively new and inexperienced w/ Traveller and BL/BR especially, at the
time)... maybe it\'s time to start up another w/ a new batch of players... PE
needs some fixes though (some major), as it becomes quite unplayable (at least
unenjoyable)...

Hey, Jim V?  Does this sound interesting for the IEGG? ; )  

Btw, fighters are quite effective in BR as point defense and missle delivery
platforms.  In large numbers, they *can* affect large capital ships (and/or at
least their tactics... you see that task force/squadron of 50dt fighters
(especially when unidentifyed) let out a few vollies of bogeys (missles) and
you get concerned pretty quick)).  Dummy task forces can play hell w/ the
minds of other players, too. : )

One of the things I most like about BL/BR is that it wasn\'t designed top-down,
but bottom-up.  There is no inherent "right way" to fight the battles.
Certain things are common-sense (pd, good acceleration, fuel endurance, etc
etc), but the rest is pretty much open ended and depends more on the
particulars of the enemy design.  This is really cool IMO because it would
mean that design theories and styles would alter in response to each other
even considering teh crawl that tech level advancement becomes.

I\'d agree.

Yes, the J4/drop tank Xboats get 6 parsec range but the J6 couriers (TJ and
naval) would still have an advantage in time, so i don\'t think having a
J4/drop-tank growing xboat network would be disagreeable to keeping the J4
Xboats as a control system.  As was mentioned somewhere else, they would
beging building droptank equipped xboats (almost certainly those that could be
still picked up by the old xboat tender).  Militaries (especially the big
ones) are notoriously thrifty.  If these new xboats would require new tenders,
they\'d be that much more difficult to ever be approved.

Eneri the Bureaucrat probably has brought it up and the Emperor\'s man has told
him to sit down and shut up. : )  Seriously, the X-boat system in 1100 (if not
for the previous century) is a control system.  It\'s desirable for the Emperor
to be able to have an information advantage over his subordinate nobles *and*
over the bureacracy, as well (keeps them from coordinating a junta or coup).
I\'m sure Arballatra might have agreed, after the First Civil War.  Otherwise,
wouldn\'t the Xboat system have started as a J5 system instead of J4?  Was
Arballatra keeping J5 for her private courier network or was the cost really
to high to justify it?  Wouldn\'t the burueacracy have wanted a J5 system?
Maybe the Empress\' man told em to sit down and shut up? : )

No, but the Emperor could (and would IMO) most likely know (or find out) what
any of the Megacorps are up to, at any time.  And Bad Times will befall any
megacorp that ignores the Emperors wishes (and he finds out about it).
Anything that\'s possibly a threat to the Iridium Throne would be controlled,
or at least very closely watched, after the First Civil War.  More tight, at
first, then loosening (possibly alot under Strephon, given his attitudes in
other areas).

heh.  I don\'t know of any canon that would make J5 and J6 heavily regulated
uncanonical.  Megacorps (and anyone w/ any sort of power or influence) could
well get exceptions, but Joe Trader or Citizen Eneri?

The megacorps wouldn\'t be their stooges or toadies.  That\'s not what i\'m implying.   
If they should do anything to threaten the Imperium or the control network in place,
though, The Emperor could and would shut them down.  Having ownership just lets
the Emperor put his own men and intelligence apparatus in there to tell him
things he wants to know (as well as the credits<g>).  IMO, The Imperium would
acquiesced to the megacorps having J6 courier networks, but only if they
weren\'t used to circumvent the control network that is the Xboat network.  The
enforcement of this would be the biggie, as well as the interpretation of what
an individual Emperor (and/or his agents) finds to be "threatening."

Unclear, and probably not true.  Either they castle (in which case the wires
wind up where the teleporter came from, which is fairly non-harmful), or there
is at least some force (sufficient to displace air) when they teleport, or
teleportation is _very_ unpleasant and fairly unhealthy as the atmosphere and
dust in the area is suddenly one with the teleporter.  Given that teleportation
doesn\'t kill people all that often, I\'d be inclined to assume that
teleportation displaces objects, probably with a force comparable to what a
normal person walking can displace (i.e. if you can casually push it aside, it
isn\'t an obstacle).

How exactly are you detecting the presence of a man-sized object?  Note that in
general teleporting into an area with an extensive sensor web just isn\'t all
that useful, regardless of what type of defenses you connect to it (connecting
it to an alarm and sending down guys with guns is likely sufficient).

Unless you can only teleport into vacuum it could be argued
that teleport does, infact, push things out of thje way.  It certainly
pushes particles in the *air* out of the way, no?  Or does it utilize
the matter found in the space to create the teleported object -
thus - teleporting into a vacuum would be impossible?

*Quick Gel* Riot foam with sensors to detect teleport may be
a good measure even if teleport pushes it out of the way - the

We have socialists in the US too.  Some form fringe parties,

in local areas where they may have number, like Berkeley).

No.  I supposes that the mail distribution systems can\'t be run
for maximum efficiency for any particular bit of mail.  If an
incoming message has to go out to two other systems, forwarding
to one of the those system is going to have to wait.  If the
need for mail to be sent back to the original system is greater,
then they both have to wait.  Unless every bit of mail comes
into a system with a ship waiting to carry it on to all destination
systems (and we are talking a lot of ships here) then messages
are going to have to wait.

Well, we are talking smuggling here.  We have hashed this over

anit-piracy and a suitable budget is (or how effective any
particular level of prevent would be).

Well, I don\'t know the slang "twig to that".  If you mean
they will think of it, of course they will.  But unless
they detain ships just because they are jump3+, it will
be of limited use.  (The US knows what kind of boats
are used for drug smuggling, but they still need other
means of identifying the smugglers).

How do you stop them without detaining them?

  Well, I concede that the current situation is basically inexplicable.
We know that the IN/INI and the Household have J-6 systems, although it\'s
not clear that they have committed enough hulls to run it as a "ship per
day" rather than a ship per week or so system. Either way, the long-range
transmission of info between (sector?) collection centers must almost
certainly be quite close to J-6/week.

  It\'s not impossible that the X-Boat system is largely only civil, low-
priority, and news*, with Imperial and large corporate** systems running
parallel at a lower frequency but a very high speed between command nexi.

  That model would imply a certain amount of double-think, as anyone who
knows anythings about it (including every spaceship crew in the 3I) would
have to politely ignore the implication that what the official mind of the
Imperium knows (and when they know it) is important, and that the wants and
needs of its\' regular inhabitants are mere inconveniences. Believable?

 * this assumes that the 3I doesn\'t really want fast news to its\' members (RSB)

Well, lets not confuse "what" is being sent with "how" it is
being sent.  It can be argued that a merchant wouldn\'t send messages
that reveal their future trading plans for fear that the
unscrupleous would intercept them (perhaps even by x-boat).
But that say little about how other messages are sent, just
that merchants don\'t send those kinds of messages.

This is a stretch.  Even if you have a fleet of jump-6 couriers
at each world waiting to carry messges you only cut transit time
by 50%.  After all, plenty of time senstive mail was sent
before overnight services like Federal Express became available,
it mostly just meant that things got put off a day or two
before they become urgent and had to be sent "now".

Well, this is subjective.  I find this picture of an Imperium where
they can track everyone, catch smugglers reliably,
etc. to be hard to believe in a background where communications
have to be carried by ship and the interstellar governement
is supposedly disinterested in local affairs.

  True, but that was in a primarily bipartite atmosphere; multi-participant
"horse-trading" (and the Imperium would have _hundreds_ of major worlds even
if you somewhat cynically decide to ignore the poor ones - and the richest
ones are spread out throughout* the entire 3I, too); creating a meaningful
federation where those powers nearest the core can optimize their policies
(presumably at others\' expense) seems a very difficult task, at least for one
with a significant lifespan. The Sylean Fed may have run across this problem
at a lower level at some point.

how strongly is it pushed, how is it pushed, and how fast is it pushed.)
Can the person just push air out of the way, or water as well? How about
dust? Corrosive atmosphere? Riot foam? Bead curtains? And what
happens when the person can\'t push the matter out of the way (like the
case of steel pins all over the place, steel wire grids or an unfortunate
misdirection into a tube full of steel ball bearings).

This will be affected by how you see teleportation working IYTU. Is it a
space warp, a trip through jumpspace, a momentary transformation into
pure thought? Each will end up with different mechanics of exit and
entry, and will have their own cool special effects.

Speaking as a gearhead, I find this a little irritating - adding up 
component masses and powers and costs to the fourth significant figure and
then having to assume that the single bulkiest part of the ship is      
automatically overdesigned by 5%. What about freighters? (I know, it\'s
Just A Game...) I suppose one could take the model that the jump field
actually extends a significant distance from the hull (several meters or
more), which makes the hit for streamlining more comprehensible.

It would have been clearer if it had been obvious that bays and turrets
stick out of the hull, which it wasn\'t - definitely needs some clarification 
for slow-witted people like me.

I was under the impression that it was J4 because most of the bases and 
centers it connected were J4 or less.

Unfortunately, it doesn\'t require too many accidental executions of innocent
people (due to hardware failure, etc) for the system to acquire enough bad
press to get removed.  Most likely any lethal internal defensive system is
going to only be fully active under unusual circumstances, and will usually
merely generate a security alert somewhere.

Differing dialects of Vilani, depending on year, are canon, and I\'ve
always assumed that the same holds for other languages.

There\'s nothing that actually says that there are no more languages in
Traveller. Most of us assume Galanglic as a lingua franca, with other
empires having their own equivalent. Differing regional dialects of
Galanglic are canon, and minor races and isolated planets have been
\'reveals\' as having different languages.

  That\'s all pretty reasonable; presumably worlds that have misbehaved
get their normal SDB/COACC budget requisitioned by the IN/colonial fleet
to cover the cost of defending those naughty boys (which won\'t work really
well, as SDB\'s are supposed to be the most cost-effective portion of the
defenses for a given site*)?

  That should work, although perhaps only under limited circumstances;
i) they check you out and get a match for two ID\'s on file - oops. This
maybe shouldn\'t be allowed (rapid scans to compare to their database) as
theres\' no genuine need for the capability to exist, and it really screws
over PC\'s (even if there are 100 billion plus current ID\'s out there...).

ii) they check out your ID and it isn\'t listed on their file of ID\'s
issued: when and where (although not necessarily with Empire-wide DNA
registry included) - your ID can pass some musters, but even if faked
by an insider it still can\'t appear on a list as having been issued any
earlier than the forgery, which could get you caught.

  FWIW, it\'s probably a great deal safer to sanitize your ship by getting
rid of it (preferably outside the 3I) than it is to try and disguise its\'
original construction without replacing some of the major fittings (OC, if
you do get rid of them, that should help a lot).

For some reason I get this image of Zho teleporters with drop tanks ... or
maybe collapsible abdomenal bladders (owch).

I always envisioned teleportation more as opening a portal to step through
(like the "dimension door" of AD&D) than an actual "poof, you\'re there"
effect. It just seemed like a better solution to me. Of course, I envision
ships jumping as an effect similar to that in the computer game _Decent:
Freespace_ -- a shimmering, two dimensional doorway through which the ship
flies. YMMV.

    'topic' => 'Re : The Darmine',
    'body' => 'Just catching up with the accumulated posts....

This is an interesting human variant race.

There are a few little problems I can see, though.

i. The more active immune response implies a much higher incidence of
autoimmune disease and allergies in the population. Blood transfusion
and organ transplantation would be nearly impossible without
sophisticated medical trickery.

Reproduction is possible because of :-
a. the presence of immunosuppressant factors in the semen or vaginal
secretions ;
b. placental \'block\' (as correctly pointed out in an earlier posting,
one of the mysteries of contemporary immunology).

Libido would probably be lower :-
Probability of reproducing = f(reproductive risk, energy and time
required to ensure survival offspring, cultural factors)

ii. As Leonard Erickson correctly pointed out, an enhanced transport
system rather than an augmented immune system makes more sense.
While the immune system is amazingly good at recognising different
organic molecules, it isn\'t too flash at differentiating between
differently sized hydrated metal ions.
Protein load becomes a problem with an antibody based system : severe
derangements of osmotic pressure would ensue, depending on the
concentration of metals.

Another simpler option (for all you budding genetic engineers) is to
dramatically decrease the affinity of the intestinal mucosal receptors
for metal complexes.
This enables the \'internal milieu\' to be about humaniti normal, but
prohibits the interesting cosmetic changes e.g. green hair. (but see
notes below).

Unfortunately, \'please pass the salt\' becomes a logistical rather than
an etiquette problem at a mixed dinner party. Darmine outside their
usual environments become rapidly iron, zinc, etc. deficient.

There may also be unpleasant problems associated with bacterial
overgrowth in the gut, most metals being nutrients for them too. Unless
intestinal levels get very, very high... hmm,
an extremophile enteritis sounds interesting.....

The biggest problem I can see with absorbing all the metal is an
increased incidence of liver and gut cancers (from the radioactive
isotopes which will be present).

iii. Someone said conventional medications would not readily work on the
Darmine.
If their immune response is super amplified they will - all foreign
molecules will induce anaphylaxis (oops).
If we posit that the handling of metal salts is different, and that is
the only real difference between the Darmine and the rest of humaniti,
then other drugs will work just as well (or as badly).

iv. The Darmine worldview and cosmesis.
I presume that the problem with the Darmine worlds is that the levels of
metal salts in the environment are so high as to be toxic to most
lifeforms.

What an amazingly colourful place these worlds must be - the various
reds, blues, greens etc. in the water, the metallic tints in the plants
and animal hides....

Perhaps Darmine colouration is cultural. They dye their hair shocking
pink or verdigris because these are common colours in the environment (a
residual from hunter gathering days, or more darkly, internecine
attrition wars in the jungles of the homeworld)...

v. Why are outsiders interested in the Darmine?
Assume they have normal gut absorption and enhanced elimination - mining
companies will want Darmine bile or liver extracts to make marginal ore
bodies viable.
\'Bioremediation\' of waste sites is another important application.
Pharmaceutical companies will want Darmine bits for the treatment of
metal poisoning and
research ; the basis of \'mucosal block\' remains unclear at contemporary
tech levels (i.e. how the intestine decides how to stop absorbing any
more iron, for example).

Just my Cr 0.02...

I\'m looking for someone to develop HG and other details

Close Structure, and, based on exterior appearance,

mentioned in canon?

For instance - is there a holiday celebrating the Emperor\'s birthday?
His/Her ascension to the throne? Holiday\'s commemorating the Veterans of
the Frontier Wars?  A holiday celebrating the Founding of the Imperium (at
a guess, I\'d say it would be celebrated on Day 1), etc.?

Any comments, suggestions, or canon ref\'s appreciated.

Thanks,
Paul

     Day Zero of the Imperial Calandar was the celebration of the founding

That\'s what I always figured the canon Aslan, Zhodani, etc languages

Libido would be *higher* since the lower birthrate due to the intensified 
immune system would dictate that matings should occur as often as possible to 
beat the odds.

And they\'d naturally carry \'trace tabs\' containing higher levels of these and 
other elements than a normal human\'s trace tab.  \'Pass the salt\' could get 
normal humans killed from heavy metal poisoning.

Darwinian selection would weed out those who couldn\'t deal with these 
problems,  The survivors would adjust over time, just like isolated genetic 
pockets adjust to their environments here on Earth.

I\'d assume they\'d want Darmine bacteria & fungi to concentrate lowgrade 
minerals.  This would make sense.

Taking "sensor in outer system", "single hex scan", and "scan time of
hours", the modifier is +2.5.

The text says some observations are occurring at ranges as distant as
1500 parsecs, about range 22.  Setting aside issues of funding for now,
let\'s assume Longbow is sensitivity-16.5, costing about TCr 50.

Given those numbers, Longbow can just detect a signal of +3, which 
corresponds to a 10000 MW ship that\'s "surprised" and "using active
sensors", assuming no masking or other modifiers.  If the target is
also using HEPlaR to maneuver at all, it only needs a 1000 MW power
plant to be potentially visible.  Like any other sensor, once Longbow 
spots a target it has a much easier time tracking it (+1.5 modifier).

I took a quick look at the Very Large Array\'s web site.  It cost
$78.6 million in 1972 dollars to build, which is 0.0065% of the US
GDP in 1972 (about $1200 billion in 1972 dollars).  If we assume 
the Imperial GDP is about PCr 250 (TCr 250000), then the proportion
of GDP the Imperium spent on Longbow would be roughly equivalent to
the US having built three VLAs.

 I also agree with the previous poster about this. Most Police Officers that I
have seen can\'t shoot worth a d--n (no flames; I was one myself). I do not
like the idea of a police officer missing a perp and putting a high power
rifle cartridge through my apartment wall. I wish that LEO\'s would be issued
with submachine guns firing pistol cartridges instead of rifles and/or
carbines as department shoulder arms (though I still prefer a good shotgun).

Whatever happened to the Waystation being built on Echiste, Lanth described
in Twilights\' Peak. IIRC it never made it to MT. An oversight perhaps?

Alternatively, was it nuked in the FFW?

Any thoughts?

Canon - (Imperial Encyclopedia, MT, (c)1977 to 1998 FarFuture Enterprises,
All rights reserved, quoted for discussion purposes).

Express Boats: Rapid communication ships designed to make optimum use of
jump technology in communicating information within the Imperium. Because
the Imperium is so large, ordinary communication must depend on ships
travelling along established trade routes, making Regina nearly 4 years out
from the Imperial Core. The express boat (abbreviated Xboat) system,
established originally in 624 and expanded to cover the entire imperium by
718, reduces this communication time by nearly 75 percent.

Selected locations along major trade routes are established as sites for
express stations, which are orbital facilities which service and refuel the
Xboats on their communications runs. As an Xboat arrives in a system, it
beams its recorded data to the express station, which then retransmits it
to an Xboat standing by for a jump outsystem; Time between jumps is almost
always less than four hours and has been recorded at under seven minutes
making the speed of communication nearly the speed of jump (since Xboats
carry jump-4 drives, speeds near four parsecs per week). In practice, this
speed is somewhat reduced by the fact that trade routes do not follow
straight lines and that not all jumps are made at jump-4. Nonetheless, the
system achieves approximately jump-2.6 per week.

Express Boats (1117 update): Since the assassination of the Emperor by
Archduke Dulinor, the progress of Xboats through the Imperium has become
increasingly impeded. Various factions restrict information flow to gain
advantage. Additionally, the Domain of Deneb is effectively isolated from
the body of the Imperium by the Vargr corsairs that have overrun Corridor
sector since the withdrawl of the sector fleet. The Xboat link through
Corridor is severed; the only links are maintained by merchants and naval
couriers, travelling both through Corridor, and the Great Rift.

IMO the Imperium deliberately maintains the network (which is Civilian) at
J4. The Imperial Navy has a courier system at j6 for urgent messages. I
suspect pressure would be brought against any party trying to expand the
network to a higher jump rating, or perhaps the Imperium restricts such
operations in a similar manner to telecoms and post office operations are
deliberate monopolies in some countries.

I would conclude (from MT material ) that the Imperium controls information
as in your second conclusion, especially as the construction of a J6
network would require more Waystations to be built (and TL15 facilities to
maintain them?)

My view is that Artemus breaks it up in return for holdings in the other
MegaCorps, or potential MegaCorps. This will defuse potential concerns
about his pacification policies and the concentration of power...

I haven\'t got anything to back that up, of course.

Depends how you think a NAS actually works, but since someone in a low berth
has rather minimal neural activity, probably not (or at least, not at any
significant range at all -- maybe 1% or less).  Someone on fast drug would
probably be harder to detect as well (assuming an inverse square rule, which is
rather an assumption, someone on fast drug would be detected at about 1/8
normal range).

Ouch.  Definitely derogatory.  In deference to Leo, let\'s abreviate
them "DB" for Donut Brigade, instead of LEO. ;-}

BITS has also started work on a development of FT for Traveller - the
combat system has been modified to give a Traveller feel, and the ship
construction system is being changed to match the Fleets Book version.

<GRIPE> Unfortunately, none of the playtest copies people aske for has had

Me too. I have thought that bays were internal ever since I was introduced
to the term in _High Guard_. I never knew that they were just big honkin\'
turrets (Imperial designation; BHTs). Why call them bays at all? I also
thought that virtually all starship turrets were of the pop-up variety
(regardless of MT illos), although I am not sure where I got that idea.

Aslan 1. Hivers 1. Vargr many. Zhodani1. Vilan 1. Sword Worlds 1. Darrians

Differing dialects of Vilani, depending on year, are canon, and I\'ve
always assumed that the same holds for other languages.

There\'s nothing that actually says that there are no more languages in
Traveller. Most of us assume Galanglic as a lingua franca, with other
empires having their own equivalent. Differing regional dialects of
Galanglic are canon, and minor races and isolated planets have been
\'reveals\' as having different languages.

Nope, it isn\'t a typo. David Pulver said he designed them that way
intentionally, seeing the bay more as a big turret with crew inside it
(kinda like a cupola, I thought.) The 20 spaces inside the ship are
basically for the support machinery and "rotation space".

Okay, I got it to work -- after a fashion.  For standard hulls in GT (very
good streamlining, lifting body option), the answer is

minimum glide angle = 0.00143 Lwt / Sa

where Lwt is loaded weight (in pounds), and Sa is surface area (sf).  Glide
ratio (horizontal distance traveled for vertical distance lost) is then 

glide ratio = (1 - glide angle) / glide angle.

For the ships presented in GT, the actual numbers are:

Ship				dtons	stons		sf		glide ratio	
Iramda				10	58.9		2,000		10.8	
Launch				10	36.0		2,000		18.4	
Lifeboat			10	40.8		2,000		16.1	
Rampart				10	90.3		2,000		6.7	
Gig				20	77.9		3,000		12.4	
Ship\'s Boat			30	97.1		4,000		13.4	
Fuel Skimmer			40	104.3		5,000		15.7	
Pinnace				40	130.4		5,000		12.4	
Modular Cutter			50	189.6		6,500		11.0	
Interplanetary Shuttle		100	230.0		10,000		14.2	
Shuttle				100	374.5		10,000		8.3	
Suleiman			100	346.8		10,800		9.9	
Suleiman II			100	382.0		10,800		8.9	
Animal				200	398.9		15,800		12.8	
Beowulf				200	631.5		16,600		8.2	
Empress Marava			200	556.6		16,600		9.4	
Akkigish			400	1,340.8		28,200		6.3	
Dragon				400	2,907.4		28,200		2.4

The unweighted average is 11.  Comparable glide ratios from the real world:

High-performance sailplane	25-40
Typical patrol or transport	12-20
High-performance bomber	20-25
Prop-powered trainer		10-15
Jet trainer			9-16
Transonic jet fighter		10-13
Supersonic jet fighter		4-9
Helicopter			3-5

So, the Dragon drops like a rock, and the rest are in the right ballpark
for transatmospheric craft.  For best results, use the aerobraking rules on
VE2, p. 164, to get down from orbit to 15,000 ft and figure the glide from
there.

The derivation follows.

********Gearhead Alert*********
	
All right, let\'s examine what we have, shall we?  According to VE2:

Top speed (Vmax) depends on aerial motive thrust (Amt) and aerodynamic drag
(Adr), 

Vmax = sqrt (7,500 * (Amt/Adr))				(eqn 1.0, p. 134)

Aerial acceleration (aAccel) depends on aerial motive thrust and loaded
weight (Lwt), 

aAccel = (Amt/Lwt) * 20						(eqn 2.0, p. 135)

Put it another way:

Amt = (aAccel * Lwt) / 20					(eqn 2.1)

But the unpowered glider has no aerial motive thrust and no top speed (Amt
= 0, Vmax = 0), unless it accelerates by diving. This acceleration (a
component of aAccel, in this case the only component) depends on the
fraction of total velocity (V) that is dedicated to vertical movement (Vv,
where V = Vv + Vh; this is only an approximation, but given as such in the
text).  That relationship is

aAccel = (Vv/V) * 20						(eqn 3.0, p. 155)

Combined with equation 2.1, this gives aerial motive thrust and top speed
as

Amt = Vv/V * Lwt							(eqn 2.2)

Vmax = sqrt (7,500 * Vv/V * Lwt / Adr)			(eqn 1.1)

     = (Vv/V)^1/2 * (7,500 * Lwt / Adr)^1/2		(eqn 1.2)

You can see that Vmax varies as a function of Vv/V.  When Vv/V = 1 (a
vertical dive), Vmax equals terminal velocity (p. 157, Falling).  As Vv/V
tends to zero (pure horizontal flight), Vmax also tends to zero until
eventually Vmax is less than stall speed (Vs).  Thus the minimum allowable
value of Vv/V occurs when Vmax = Vs. For the unpowered glider,

Vs = (Lwt / Lift Area) * Sl * Rs				(eqn 4.0, p. 133)

Set Vmax = Vs, and

(Vv/V)^1/2 * (7,500 * Lwt / Adr)^1/2 = (Lwt / Lift Area) * Sl * Rs
										(eqn 5.0)

GURPS Traveller sets some parameters for standard hulls:  Very Good
streamlining, Lifting Body option, no Responsive Hulls.  This allows us to
simplify 5.0 to

(Vv/V)^1/2 * (37,500 * Lwt / Sa)^1/2 = (Lwt / 0.3Sa) * 2.2	(eqn 5.1)

where Sa is hull surface area.  So

Vv/V = 0.00143 Lwt / Sa

for a minimum dive angle to maintain Vmax = Vs.

I\'ve always treated bays as being internal to the ship.  And I\'ll continue to
do so.

If you wish to you can.  In that case apply the following mods:
a)  Take up 50 spaces each.
b)  Significantly reduced field of fire (roughly 90 degree arc of fire).  This
does not affect missile launchers.
c)  Do not add any surface area.

FT stands for Full Thrust, a set of simple rules for starship minitures done
by Ground Zero Games.  While there is a semi-official background, the rules
are designed to be generic and the mechanics are very open for tinkering if
you wish to create just the right feel for whatever universe you wish to
simulate.  Current rules sets I\'ve come across on the Net include Starcruiser
Yamato/Starblazers, Traveller, Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica,
Macross, Mobile Suit GUNDAM, Babylon 5 (and the official fleet sim for the B5
RPG uses Full Thrust), Battlefleet Gothic, and Starfleet Wars.  You can find a
good starting point at http://www.uwm.edu/~cthulhu/FT/index.htm with an
overview of the game at Introductions.  Two links to Traveller rules sets are
also here and as others on the ML have stated there is another floating around
out there (which BTW I\'d really like to see if someone would be kind enough to
send me a link/URL or the file;  thanks in advance).

As an aside, the creator of Full Thrust, Jon Tuffley, also has two ground
combat games with Dirtside II and Stargrunt II.  While the nominally generic
they are a bit more complex in the mechanics then Full Thrust and lend
themselves more to a tech level as seen in 2300 AD or the Aliens universe, but
again rules sets are out there and the mechanics can be played with easily
enough to do TL14-15 combat.

Now we return you to your regularly scheduled Traveller discussions.....

Which, of course, is totally different from High Guard... 
where they are internal as described:

"Weapons may be mounted *in* bays, large areas near
the skin of the ship\'s hull."

"Empty weapons bays may be put to a variety of uses,
such as holding small craft, or storing cargo."

Bays are obviously internal, given the description for
turrets:

"Weapons may be mounted in turrets emplaced *on*
the hull."

Would that be for the 50 ton bay or the 100 ton bay?

Welcome to the real world! :-)

The diameter of a star depends on its mass *and* its age. Stellar type

No, it\'s a typo.

Otherwise, we have to assume that 

1) very heavily armoured ships magically get armour over their bays for
free, and

2) all jump ships with bays magically get more efficient jump drives (or
that jump ships without bays install bigger jump drives than they need)

While we are fixing up typos, you missed explicity stating the minimum hull
size needed to install bays (otherwise FS is building a 40 dton Heavy
Fighter with a PAW bay bigger than it is).

Traveller canon seems to have been written by people who did not ahhhh have
the grounding in either history or economics to predict the natural
concequences of having free trade and different TL planets. The touching
attachment to Cr 1000/dton/jump (regardless of length) is an indication of
this.

On to your specific points.

Firstly, it\'s not a big deal to find a hi-tech world to do maintainence at.
A ship needs 2 weeks in 52 of maintainence, which means with a little
planning it isnt a problem.

Secondly, lower tech worlds will have lower-value currencies, but their
ships will presumably be paid in the same hard currency the hi-tech
freighters get paid in. Given that (under all flavours of Trav) higher tech
freighters are only marginally more efficient than lower tech freighters,
cheaper lo-tech freighters will dominate, except for the Express Package
business (i.e. jump-4 and up).

On the other hand, hi tech military ships are far better, so logically the
lo-tech shipyards build merchant ships, and the hi tech yards build
military ships.

I cant put this politely. Too many ships in canon were not optimised in
terms of price.

BTW, thrust has been based on mass since FFS v1. Incidentally, I dont like
cargo to be assumed at 5t per dton ... that is about 0.3 t/m3, which is
lower than I think most commodities would be.

It\'s a change in canon I dont like. The G:T rules as they stand make
planetfall-capable merchants too inefficient, and we want to encourage
ships that can make planetfall themselves, rather than stay in orbit and
have big interface shuttles come up to meet them.

Anyway, a mostly smooth sphere or cylinder should be capable of making
planetfall with contragravity, as long as you didnt leave too many bits
sticking out.

Considered, and filed under \'Famile Spofulam Built Me\'. It is FS, so it has
a Honking Big Particle Accelerator. The ship is meant to intimidate the
crap out of ethically challenged civilians. If they are forced to stay at
long range, then our odds of surviving long enough for the cavalry to
arrive are improved.

10 laser turrets will give the point defense, plus my reading of the combat
rules indicate missiles can ram other missiles, and we will have missile
parity against most things.

No you cant. Not charging Cr 8000 a passage you cant - the economics rules
are broken enough to start with, doubling the density of middle passenger
biofreight makes them into even more of a sick joke than they are (and I\'m
referring to the Traveller trade and freight rules, not the half page job
in G:T).

On the other hand, the escort frigate is more flexible, and has the agility

*nods* A National has 29 crew, right ? So assuming you get half value for
one badly-treated, last-owner-careless Corsair, and the crew get to split
10% as their share, then they get a Holiday bonus of ... about Cr 250 000

One of the concequences of commerce raiding is a fairly vicious
evolutionary progress towards more defensible ships.

In HG terms, defensible means bigger, because of the relationship between
size and critical hits, and computer power and defensibility.

  {
    'body' => 'I had a good time this past Friday...

I decided to start a M:0 campaign (must remember to update my campaign
listing out on Rob\'s page...) - I don\'t know why, it just suddenly seemed
like a good time.  IG is out of the picture, T:G seems to have taken over
the M:1100 slot I enjoy, T5 is looming on the horizon.

Call me contrary - I just browbeat my players into a M:0 campaign.  :)

This past Friday, they left the Imperial borders behind, and ventured
seriously into the wilds.  They are travelling in a 200 dTon Free Trader,
and I thought that they really needed to know that the "Rules Had Changed".
So I threw in a pirate encounter.  Not with the pirate, but with the victim
(a 400 dTon \'Fat\' trader...)

The system they jumped into was BA - no population, but between two
populated systems.  It\'s on a main, so if there is anywhere that would have
traffic, that would be the place.  And the mainworld, while not particularly
pleasant, is habitable for short periods of time.

One of things that I have given a lot of thought on is how commerce works
when the Imperium is not around to supply a banking system.  Ships,
especially out on the fringes, have to carry enough wealth to cover
expenses, and it has to be transportable.  The \'Imperial Visa Card\' won\'t
cut it, Imperial Credits are a curiosity.  And freight cargo (i.e. the cargo
you just haul, but someone else owns) is going to be few and far between -
except in pocket empires.  So the tramp ships have to be carrying a fair
amount of valuables to cover expenses.

So, says I, while I\'m putting the game together, what are pirates after?
Cargo - if it\'s valuable.  The Strongbox/room (there has to be enough
valuables to keep the ship going through a few bad ports, it has to be small
and transportable enough to not take up a lot of room, and it has to have a
universal value that can be converted on virtually any planet.)  And
entertainment....

They knew the ship was in trouble as they approached it.  It was in a slow,
3 axis spin (deadman\'s tumble), with the bow doors open and cargo containers
floating around the ship.  There were hull breaches around engineering, and
enough residual H2 detectable that it was evident that at least one of the
fuel tanks had been damaged.

There was a brief discussion about trying to dock - but it was tabled after
I started smiling...  They donned suits and jumped for the center of mass.
(There was also some discussion about just shooting a line attached to a
magnet to the ship and letting the motion \'reel\' the person in.  Funny,
everyone wanted someone else to try it, but no one wanted to be the one...)

They entered through engineering, on the starboard wing.  Power was almost
exhausted, so they had to use the manual systems to open the sphincter
hatches (600 turns of that little knob down there...).  Once inside the
starboard M-drive room, they found a handle for the hatch - which made it a
lot easier - and opened up the hatch to the cargo bay.

The cargo bay was a mess - the cargo modules had been moved around and not
re-secured to the deck.  Once the floor fields had lost power, the
centrifical force of the spin had caused the cargo to shift aft and to port,
pretty much at random.  They were unable to access the manifests, because
the computers were down (no power).  Plus, they were working pretty much by
flashlight.  One of the party elected to stay here and try and figure out if
there was anything left.

The rest of the party headed to the upper decks through engineering.  They
were not pleased.  Engineering was open to space, and the J-drive obviously
had taken one or more hits.  It looked like the Power Plant was intact - but
most of the breakers had been tripped.  The engineer started working on
this, while the Pilot decided to work forward.

This is where I really started questioning the players.  They had one person
(alone) down in the cargo bay, one person (alone) in engineering and one
person (alone) working his way forward.  Because they were trying to
re-pressure the ship, they kept closing the hatches (and I kept stressing
that it takes about 5 minutes to open the darn things manually), but they
were really into it.

[(sigh)  I should have done the hungry, carbon-lifeform-eating, space
creature scenario instead...]

Anyway, forward of engineering there is still pressure.  The after third of
the passenger area decompresses when he opens the sphincter hatch from
engineering, but no one is there anyway.  He closes the hatch and moves
forward to the next - noting as he does that every cabin door seems to have
been blown open by a small application of explosives.  (C4 on the latch)
After opening the next hatch, he is suddenly operating a Vacc Suit in a half
atmosphere - but very cold.  He elects to keep his helmet on (a very smart
idea as it turns out) and moves forward into the lounge.

There he finds the passengers.  It wasn\'t pretty.

Continuing forward, he enters the bridge.  The same person who opened all
the passenger doors apparantly removed the storage media from the computers.
They are totalled.  There is some spalling on the interior of the
viewscreens - small arms fire.  They still have not located the crew.

At this point, they decide to see if they can get the power plant back up
and restart life support.  While the two engineering types work on the
plant, the third removes the bodies to several of the staterooms and looks
around some more.  One of the places he goes is to the low berth area - and
there he finds the crew.  6 of the low berths were disabled (small arms fire
into the control panels) and the tops were welded shut.

Finally, they get the power plant back online.  The breakers for the Port
M-Drive will not stay closed (visual inspection shows that it will need
shipyard repairs), sensors are dead, J-Drive is out, and while they can get
pressure, there is no heat or air treatment available.  And while they can
get power to the starboard M-Drive, the control circuits from the bridge to
the drive are non-operative.

While they are tracing this problem, it takes them back into the low-berth
room.  One low berth is showing green.  This is a bit startling, since the
ship appears to be very, very dead - so they get the doctor up there quick.
Sure enough, now that there is power, it appears that the occupant of this
berth is alive!

But every other occupant of every other berth is dead.

Suspicious, the doctor checks the berth log.  The occupant is 21 years old,
170 lbs (don\'t ask me to convert - I can\'t) entered the berth at the last
port of call.  Scrolling back, he finds that this berth has been
consistantly used for every jump as far back as the log goes.  And the
lifesigns are all reading well within the norms for the body type.
Everything is completely normal.  They can see the shape of a body through
the frosting on the panel, the emergency batteries seem to be charging back
up from flat.

Too make a long story short, the low berth is a dummy.  The body in there is
a manican, and the readings are such that they should never take a second
glance.  Once they got the berth opened up, they found the equivalent of
cr150,000 in gems, metal (lanthanum), and various planetary currency (no
good anywhere else) in the base of the berth.  And, having moved it to their
own ship, they now have (for as long as they keep their mouths shut) a
pretty secure strongbox.

If you were to take the amount the US spends on a recon satellite, or a 
ballistic-missile-early-warning radar (billion dollar assets even in
1972 dollars), you could probably end up with a Longbow array rated
at 17.0 sensitivity, which would make its life easier...

This is where my comment about a long-run fall in freight rates comes in.
We pitch the rates at a level that makes sense for the Traveller universe
involved, given free markets and efficient starship design. Cr 750 plus Cr
500 per parsec is reasonable at TL11.

Given your level of piracy, I think that risk premiums would actually
dominate over interest costs, so freight costs would higher than this.

The other design of interest is the open-frame carrier design, with a
mixture of fighters and cargo shuttles.

The question is, therefore, what is the reaction going to be when rumours
hit the spaceways of Ciergatz SA\'s massive bond issue, and their investment
in an orbital construction facility for a 10 000 dton ship ?

That\'s a valid sentiment, but I just wish they\'d get proficient with

(4 full-auto firearms between my wife and I, and #5 is on the way) and
I could tell stories about bad SMG and shotgun handling that would
turn your hair *white*.  The problem with most shooters is a snap
perception issue: in a fight-or-flight situation, if they see an
opaque object (wall, car, hedge) behind their target, they tend to
treat it like Mt. Rushmore WRT to slug-stopping ability.  Usually,
the ability is more like Kleenex.  This is particularly true for
shotgun slugs vs. sheetrock interior residential walls.  A human
body has a lot more "stopping power" but you have to hit it solidly
and consistantly.

described by mostly everybody else.  I\'ve tried to include both the
name of the language, its origins, its common users, how common it
is, and possibly afew short words.  (NOTE:  The names are somewhat
changed for the same reason its \'Anglic\' as opposed to \'English\')


TERRAN LANGUAGES:
	The Terrans used to have countless languages, but ever since
their contact with the Vilani the number has been slowly going down.
In time, they\'ll probally find themselves with one or two languages.
Currently, Anglic seems the most likly canidate due to its support
amoung the Third Imperium.

Anglic:
	This language evolved from old Terran English, though it has
undergone so many changes that it\'s only barely recognizable.  It has
been heavily influenced by many human languages, particularly the old
Vilani high tounge.  It is the official language of the Third Imperium,
and is also well known in neighboring empires.

Espaneol:
	This language evolved from old Terran Spanish, with some
influence from other prominate european languages of the time.  It
is still very much a Terran language, and is still very simliar to
old Terran Spanish.  It is spoken primarily in the Solomani Rim and
the Solomani Sphere;  about half of the people of that area have
Espaneol as a native tounge, the other half having Anglic instead.

Oriental:
	The Asian presence in space was fairly large, and a number of
them were resistant to the adoption of English as a native language.
None the less, the many languages that existed were somewhat ineffective
at communication.  Oriental is the responce that the need for both a
distinctive language all of their own, and the need to communicatate.
It has its roots primarily in Chinese, but has strong influences from
most other Asian languages.  It is the third most popular language in
the Solomani regions and the Third Imperium.

Russian:
	 This language has stayed remarkably simliar to its old
Terran ancestor, the Russian language.  It\'s been influenced, somewhat,
by other languages, but a goodly percentage of the words would still
be recognizable by a speaker of Old Terran Russian.  The language
is somewhat rare, but it has managed to survive long enough to be
considered one of the Old Terran languages.

(OTHER TERRAN LANGAGES:  There are afew other Old Terran languages, but
their use is exceptionally rare.  Generally, anyone who speaks them is
either a native of the planet where they are spoken, or has lived there
so long that he might as well be such.)


VILANI LANGUAGES
	The Vilani used to have more than one language, though they
never had many of them.  In the days of the Ziru Sirka, the number of
languages dwindled as the Vilani realized that it was more efficient
to have only one language.  By the time the Terrans encountered the
Vilani, they all spoken the language that has come to be known as
Old High Vlandi.  It is now mostly known as simply Vlandi.

VARGR LANGUAGES
	The Vargr have several dozen, if not several hundred, languages.
Each planet on which the Vargr were seeded ended up with several various
languages, and those languages never died out like many of the \'old
languages\' of other Major Races.  Instead, they just changed abit over
the years.  The only change in their pattern of communication came
about around 1000 years ago, when an unsuccessful attempt at a Vargr
empire left behind one thing:  Gveh.  Gveh is a very simple language,
and can only be used to communicate very simple concepts.  However,
a great enough percentage of Vargr in the Vargr extents speak the
language such that it is a suitable method of inter-race communication.
Vargr generally either known Anglic as their native language, or they
known *two* native languages (give them the second for free).  The
first language being their native language, and only usuable to
communicate with a small percentage of the Vargr population.  The
second one is Gveh, which can be used to communicate with a much
greater percentage;  but only very simply.

I finally played my first game of Imperium on Sunday, which was an
interesting experience. I got to play the Vilani, and my friend the Terrans.

It was interesting - his initial expansion was out towards Barnards\' Star
and the World at the end of that arm, with a blocking maneuver at Proycon
past the tanker tertiary hex at Sirius.

I hit that then followed up with a second phase movement where I
neutralised his colony with a landing. I suspect that was a mistake and I
should have hit Sol and Alpha instead.

Anyway, it see-sawed and the end result was a gain of three outposts by the
Vilani (all connected) with two worlds (the Tau Ceti Group). Terra ended
the first 8 years of war and 12 of peace with the cluster rimward of
Barnards Star (basically three new connected worlds plus a fourth war up
the Proycon Arm, unprotected or connected.

The Vilani won the war with a breakthrough at the 2nd battle of Proycon,
and the destruction of all Terran outposts and the neutralisation of the
Terran world on that arm.

I feel that I won the war, but lost the peace. The Terrans have a
significantly higher RU generation (40 something) to the Vilani budget 13,
with others 26, plus plenty more stars to expand to.

I find myself facing an enemy I can crush at any one battle (unless the
missile boats are out in force) which  is spread thinly across the map. But
a hammer blow isn\'t effective as any follow up ends the game with a Vilani
win. I feel I need to hit the Terran\'s hard but loose the war to win the
campaign by gaining in RU sufficient to develop my outposts.

Have any ex-Vilani commanders from Imperium got tips? At the moment I feel
as if I really am the Vilani, not a player. My enemy is starting to out
innovate me, and spreading like wildfire - how do I crush him without
stopping the war and allowing him to consolidate?

  A potential JumpExpress Model D Provincial Courier as indicated could be
the type of ship used by an early courier company, and perhaps reflects the
perceived unsettled times after the Civil War; fuel is for one month, both
pilot and gunner have full staterooms, and both offensive and defensive
capabilities are maintained. At J-4, frequency of one per week along the
shortest route from the Marches to Core would require about 100 vessels to
cover both directions and ~10% slop; an equivalent investment to two 10 Kt
provincial freighters, and thus well within the capabilities of many Third
Empire corporations.

  Model Db - eventually some bean-counter will notice that the ship refuels
every 8-9 days anyway, and maybe cut powerplant fuel back to 14-days for a
savings of 4 Dt. Odds are that the gunner will be lost first (4 Dt), and if
the pilots union likes the benefits trade-offs, maybe half of the remaining
stateroom can go too, totalling 6 Dt, or 5.5 if a low berth is added.

  Seeings as the need for the weapons load will decrease, and the pilots
aren\'t likely going to be trained as ex-fighter jocks, the guns will go
too, for a grand total of a 11.5 Dt extra cargo capacity.

  In any case, the business opportunity lies not in providing daily launches,
but in providing regular, _fast_ service between distant centers. At TL D the
designers have it easy, as the maximum capability will fit into the minimum
hull, even if at somewhat ludicrous cost.

  BTW, the above is about the least cost-efficient XBoat that can be built
under HG - the S:7 ship is an LBB:2 artifact.

That\'s a prety major change in meaning you have there.

In all previous versions of Traveller "bays" were internal to the
ship.That\'s what "bay" means after all,  a concavity in the coast.
What you are calling a bay is more correctly called a nacelle.

>The bay works the same way.

The bay doesn\'t work the same way, it takes up space inside the ship
and merely represents the necessary hardpoints, power routing and C3
gear required to connect weapons and other equipment.

The torpedo room of an attack sub is the T7 equivalent of a missile
bay. The gun decks of a ship of the line are the T5 equivalent, and
the forward phaser banks of the Enterprise A (mounted on the edge of
the disc ) are the TF equivalent.

  Here\'s a JumpExpress Model E5 Klingon Frigate ^^^, er... Provincial
Courier:

                XP-1651551-000000-00000-0       MCr 110.8       100 tons

        Cargo=2. Fuel=52.5. EP=5. Agility=1. Low=1.

  At TL E J-5 models will eventually be adopted, but only slowly at first
due to the capital outlay (less in ships than facilities). Essentially a
redesign of the Db this unit gives the sole crewman a half-stateroom (plus
the contract mandated low berth to compensate for the half fuel load). The
ship can barely achieve this performance envelope, and unless bigger ships
are economic then the cost of express parcels will skyrocket (and even data
charges will increase) although the 25% or greater increase in speed on the
new routes will mitigate this.

  If a Model/5 could fly without a pilot, the company would try it :)

  The type no longer has the combat capability of a small fighter, either.

  In addition to capital costs, the operating expenses of this version would
actually be higher on a per launch basis, and _much_ higher on a per kg of
cargo basis (which ultimately may impact data charges directly). The design
staff probably lynched some accounting or operations staff during the change.

  Here\'s a genuinely economical J-5 unit:

        Cargo=7. Fuel=52.5. EP=5. Agility=1. Low=1.

  At TL F the J-5 E5 model is quickly upgraded as new fusion plants are
installed on refitted vessels. Smaller and cheaper, these provide long
term maintenance savings and options for expanded performance.

  Cost per ship is down almost 15%, and cost per ton of cargo by ~75%.

  The F5b loses the low berth, but now regains a months fuel and a
new 2G drive, reducing time to link up with refuellers on bad jumps,
although cargo remains at 2 Dt. Cost is MCr 96.25.

  Compared to the F5 this looks badly uneconomic:

        F6      XP-1661661-000000-00000-0       MCr 135.8      140 tons

        Cargo=1.3. Fuel=63. EP=8.4. Agility=1. Low=1.

  Looking at this design compared to the putative F5, there\'s a good chance
that bright-eyed optimism may finally be replaced by the "what was good
enough for Gramps Eneri is good enough for me" attitude. This design will
not only involve essentially recapitalizing the entire company just like the
E5 required, but this time at a _much_ greater cost and a simultaneous risk
of losing huge portions of their customer base.

  Cost per ship is up over 40%, and cost per ton of cargo by ~_700_%.

  In addition to the cost and rates issues, the new design would require
not only new routes and facilities but also new equipment - redeployed
tenders or refuellers may not be efficient with the new larger hull.

  Even ignoring specific TU political sanctions, Operations may simply
appoint a middle-manager to arrange for an elite squad of dingo dogs to
destroy the threat R&D now presents to the well-being of the company.

  Forgive me for failing to consider that more than a single piece of
mail might go on any given ship. In fact, let\'s assume that long range
couriers focus on speed (capability greater than J-4, and courses
between sector capitals or the like rationalized for much greater
performance than J-2.6 average), and let launch frequency be determined
by demand and their ability to supply hulls; FWIW, let\'s assume a working
value of one launch from one center (capital/hi-pop, etc.) to Capital
per week, with intervening stops optimized to hit other such centers.

  If such a service exists, and a strong case can likely be made that 
such a commercial* service should, then long-range transit of important
info (Imperial, commercial, or anything someone pays the premium for)
will occur by such a system, with local dissemination by the X-Boat
network where appropriate.

 * let alone any for Imperial non-Navy functions

  I don\'t suppose that you could indicate that a "system" of the sort
you describe above would be a superior business at high-speed, long-
range commercial data carriage?

...
>Well, we are talking smuggling here. /...

  If the INI handles much of the anti-piracy effort (and it\'s more than
slightly ridiculous if they don\'t) then anti-smuggling data also travels
long-distance on fleet couriers; i.e., once data gets to a regional admin
center it then goes between sectors and ~J-6/week.

  OTOH, smuggling is both harder to detect and lower priority, IMHO.

  Of course it will be of limited use, but it will allow them to
focus assets on perceived threats - in this case the tiny proportion
of ships that are potentially deliberately outrunning their oversight.

  I was thinking that detaining ships would be restricted to cases

  Ah, I\'ve foolishly failed to realize that while merchants won\'t send
messages ahead (by even two days) to their _announced destination_ (for
their freight contracts and passengers) by other tramp traders it would
make eminent sense for the Imperium to send documents vital to internal
security issues via this method.

  Which doesn\'t imply that i) the Imperium doesn\'t care about internal
security matters, and that ii) slow communications means lost messages.
If the Imperium can\'t track ships using delayed collation of shipping
reports then they\'re either simply too stupid to be believed or they
must not give a damn at all.

  FWIW, I doubt that a smuggler in the small package trade runs too
much risk either, as long as they\'re not playing the sort of games
that gets them involved in sting operations, etc.

OK. The first thing is to remember that you have to capture the Terran
worlds. Outposts can be flattened or captured, but the critical factor for
the Terrans is their ability to actually keep their tax revenue from worlds.

The second thing to remember is if you lose too many wars, you (the
Provincial Governor) lose your job, and get to do the Vilani equivalent of
running a hydroelectric plant in Siberia.

Tactically, think about building up a force of fighters and carriers, to
use as pin forces against his missile boats, allowing your Strike Cruisers
to crush him with impunity.

Jump troops are vital offensively. Make sure you have some on hand.

If you can crush the Terrans in one battle, go for the throat. Set up an
invasion of Terra.

Think of it this way ... if you do a good enough job on Terra, then win or
lose the war, the Solomani are going to remember the Ziru Sirkaa for
another 5000 years ...

	Taking into account the amount of planets named after spanish

encountered in the whole Imperium, maybe once per each 50

	IIRC, there are some references to Delphi being initially settled by

widespread there.

Since Languages are on-topic, I think the following illustrates how I

The languages of the Federation
Office KT-47 Internal Document 004

An enormous variety of languages is spoken in the Federation, to an
extent unheard of in other interstellar polities. Citizens of more
"uniform" interstellar nations may be surprised when they realize that
speaking three different languages is often not enough. 

There are seven "official" languages in the Federation, and at least
twenty others are spoken by sizable minorities. Citizens are obliged
to speak at least one of the official languages, but most speak two or
three. Experienced travellers are usually fluent in four languages,
and high-level diplomats are proud to speak at least the seven
official ones. Professional interprets speak between 10 and 20
languages. News tabloids, holorecordings, holoprograms, etc., are
routinely recorded with eight language bands, seven recorded in origin
with the official languages, and one kept empty to be used by local
distributors. Although automatic translators for personal use do
exist, they are not extremely reliable and their use is not
widespread. Many planetary societies consider their use to be "bad
manners".

The official languages are:

1. Anglic. Derived from the same Terran language that formed the basis
for the imperial Galanglic, and still quite close to it. Spoken in
Nawarth and many worlds of the New Cluster. Official language of the
Greenway corporation.

 2. Hispanic. Derived from another Terran
language, called "Spanish". Spoken in Nawarth and a number of other
worlds, as Infierno or Mundomar. Also favored in the Federation Navy.

3. Germanic. Also derived from a Terran language, called "German".
Spoken in parts of Nawarth and widespread in Darthel, it is the
official language of the Maler corporation.

 4. Retani, also known as "Reftaden". This is the most widespread 
Retani language, spoken throughout the Retani Cluster. Official 
language of the Tanayani and Lerani corporations.

 5. Likarden, another Retani language, favored by upper classes in 
Retani worlds. Defended by the Retani Historical Society, an 
organizationwith broad economic interests.

 6. Irkonee, the main Geonee language, spoken in Ardashee, Darthel, 
and Brawanee, and also by the Geonee minorities in other worlds. 
Official language of the Tardeeva corporation.

 7. Adzuk, a Vargr language originated from a mixture of Suedzuk and 
Urzaeng languages, spoken in the Zargar Cluster, but also widespread 
outside the Federation. Main language in the Star Legion.

Other important languages include:

Terran languages.
 Spoken by racial minorities, mainly in Nawarth. Two
interesting examples are Japachinese and Swahili, apparently unrelated
to the three official Terran languages. 

Retani languages. Dozens of
them are spoken in certain regions of Retan, as the Tarden or the
Graden. Others have evolved in other Retani worlds, as the Darden of
Lutan, also known as Lutani.

 Vargr languages.
 The Adzuk is a widespread "lingua franca" among the Vargr of the 
sector, but many Suedzuk speak also Sogzarrg, and many Urzaeng speak 
Urz.

 Other races.
A variant of Modern Vilani is spoken in Mishugi and Khanaashi. The
Danak minority of the Federation speaks mainly Katkon

 Artificial languages.
 A number of artificial languages have been 
created over the centuries for specific purposes. Some of them have 
survived. The most successful are the Tech, spoken by almost all 
Engineers and Technicians in the Federation and beyond (and used 
extensively by Futuretech), and the Interlingua, an extremely rigid 
but rich language, seldom spoken but extensively used in scientific 
and medical publications (which tend to be bilingual, 
Interlingua/local language).

        Hi, Ian!
        Oh, great.  Thanks very much, Ian.   Now I am going to *have* to do
a frieghter design at TL 9 - 15 and build a TL vs PPT table.  Like I don\'t
have enough to do for my game already. =)

        Its only the Frontier and Beyond that is a problem.  In fact, in the
Core, armed Merchantmen are unofficially frowned on by the UN-DSN.  However,
PC\'s seem to gravitate towards the Frontier no matter where I start them.... ;)

>The other design of interest is the open-frame carrier design, with a

        <Adds another design to put together onto list>  <Notices list seems

        BTW, Striker Book 3 has information on single-man re-entry
jump-attack capsules;  the most expensive one (ECM, Decoys, Chaff) was only
~50000Cr.  So, I\'d say that a previous musing about re-entry capable cargo
contianers probably isn\'t all that obnoxiously priced.
        Your suggestion, then, is really a frieght-hauling battle-rider.  I
suspect it\'ll have to be a monster to make up for all the extra hull cost
that don\'t actually hold cargo.

        Well, right now, given that there are only three Class A starports
IMTU (Terra, Alpha Centari, Sirius) which can barely keep up with demand
now...  quite a stir.  Potentially out-right panic in Naval circles.
Disbelief amongst shareholders ("No one\'s ever build anything that big
before!").
        100-years of game time later, it\'d be a big deal for so large a
merchant, but it\'d be acceptable.

But nobody in his right mind would put the highport in LEO. GEO is a
much better location except at really low tech levels. So that makes
them:  GEOLEOs.

That\'d be one *hell* of a "crack the whip" effect as they hit the hull.
:-)

BTW, you can\'t really get a "3-axis spin" on a dead ship. You\'ll get a
single axis, which may shift as cargo shifts, and possibly some
precession (ie the axis will wander a bit, possibly periodically).

Right. And did they stop to consider what will happen to the guy in the
cargo bay once gravity comes back? They *have* to tie down that cargo
before they can restore power. *Especially* since they don\'t know
what\'s in there. 

Would *you* want a container of (say) nitric acid to "fall" on a corner
and break open?

It should require some sort of extra override to open the hatch with a
pressure differential. And the character should have sent for a
portable lock (basicly a plastic tent that seals over the lock, and has
two "chambers" so you can go into the first, seal the plastic (think of
a *big* zipper with a rubber "flap" seal behind it) then open another
seal to get to the lock. Then seal that behind you and open the lock
(or punch a hole thru the bulkhead). This way you don\'t de-pressurize a
compartment with survivors in it. 

These "portable locks" should be standard emergency gear on ships.
Anybody want a write-up?

> Suspicious, the doctor checks the berth log.  The occupant is 21 years old,

170 lbs = ~77 kg (divide lbs by 2.2 to get kilos)

The actual *definition* is 1 ounce = 28.35 grams. Which gives 1 lb =
.4536 kilo. So the "right" answer is 77.112 kg. (1/.4536 = 2.2045...
2.2 is close enough).

I\'ve got an old-fashioned chart-and-table system available at my web site. 
It\'s not too detailed, but it works pretty well and gives you a good starting place.

Howdy Bob,
I\'ve dug up an Alien Generator Flowchart quite similar to the Animal
Encounter Tables in a World Builders\' style.
Since Idon\'t know whether I still have the file or merely a hardcopy I\'ll
look it up - at least I should be able to figure out the author.
Could take a day or so.

Munchkins are present in every system. I don\'t think either the game or
game company encourages it. The system\'s loopholes are some things not
well-explained in the books, but these are esaily corrected by the
gamemaster. And as others pointed out, the combat system can be pretty
deadly, specially if the characters can\'t get prompt medical attention.
Even though my players were succesful in combat they are making note to
avoid it. Two almost got killed, and would have died if they didn\'t have
the funds to get immediate surgery.

Don\'t want to begin a flame war, but have you actually seen the system?
Unless you\'re handing out restricted weapons at every corner the best
weapons in Alternity *are* slug-firing, and I\'ve found that melee
weapons do pretty well too.
 
> All in my own experience, of course;  YMMV

My experience is limited to my group and the Alternity mailing list.
What I have seen is that alternity players usually are the soft sci-fi,
without much gearheading. I have to agree that the system *is* soft
sci-fi. The spaceships and ship design pretty much attest to this. This
is my only gripe, they should have payed more attention to the hard
sci-fi crowd too. Of course we\'re probably a minority, if a little
vocal. None of my players care much about this.

Unfortunately the TL15 facilities limitation does not work.

Imagine A chain of 25 worlds A, B, C...X, Y, Z

A and Z are TL 15.

Each of the other systems just has low tech refuelling/supply x-boat tenders.

Your new/overhaulled X-boat Jumps A to B.

At B its messages are passed on electronically and it is fuelled and supplied.
After 1 week it is ready to take its next messages.

This time it jumps B to C.
(Carrying messages that your next new ship brought from A)

Continue until it reaches Z (after 50 weeks)
It is then overhaulled.
Its next jump is Z to Y

And back down the chain.

This system uses no more ships than if all the trips are of the A-B return
type.

If you space the jumps at J6 then one TL15 planet every 150 parsecs is enough.
This forms your communication backbone and information to and from it can be
with cheaper ships.

On the subject of cost:
A straight J6 network (averaging J4+ because planets aren\'t in the right
place)
is going to need fewer ships than a rambling J4 network.
Your feeder links might even be J2 and saving you money.
Don\'t forget that you can use ships with lots of spare fuel to perform a jump
and return (2 x J-4) to a system with no tender - all it needs is a comms link
to swap data with.

Just because Supp7 only showed one type of X-boat - why can\'t there be others?

My conclusion is that the official routes aren\'t logical and any attempts to
fix them or argue their validity becomes an IMTU/IYTU arguement.

This doen\'t mean that the arguement can\'t be interesting :-)

IMTU - This is an academic question for me:

 I\'d never considered having an adventuring party Travelling at J-4+
 for long in M1100 so they rarely outrun news except to backwater planets.
 (The multi-week adventures on backwater planets mean that everyone has
 heard about their previous exploits when they return to civilisation.)
 Thus the X-boat route being J-4 and can the players build J-6 ships
 were never really problems.
 However in M0, my party has J-3 and there are no X-boats.
 So they will always be ahead of the news...especially once they leave the
3I :-)

I\'m sorry, but I happen to know it is not a typo. I vey clearly remember a

actually, this is not true, but the misconception is likely the result of a
poor wording in the ship construction rules. When applying armor to the
hull it says to use "hull area"; it really should say "total surface area".
if you use total surface area, you do wind up paying for the armor on your
bays.

I\'m not sure how you figured this; it may be correct, I don\'t know. I would
think that the same could be said for turrets, since the actual external
volume of the turret is not included in the volume of the ship for purposes
of computing size of jump drive needed.

I have the GURPS Traveller ship construction system right here with me as I
type, and nowhere in it do I find any mention of a minimum hull size for
bays. Admittedly, there probably should BE a minimum. Then again, since a
bay takes the place of 10 turrets, this by definition would seem to limit
bays to ships of more than 1,000 tons, since lesser ships don\'t have enough
turret spaces to allow installation of a bay. This amounts to a de facto
limitation; it should be more explicitly stated.

I do believe that bays should have been internal; had I been able to be in
on the playtest, I would have commented on this. Perhaps those who are
working on the Starships book might want to correct this by including
Internal Bays as an option and noting that this is what bays originally
were in High Guard. In the meantime, the suggestion offered for Internal
bays seems to work fairly well.

I believe it was Anthony Jackson who pointed this out (credit where credit

That\'s a prety major change in meaning you have there.

In all previous versions of Traveller "bays" were internal to the

What you are calling a bay is more correctly called a nacelle.

The bay doesn\'t work the same way, it takes up space inside the ship
and merely represents the necessary hardpoints, power routing and C3
gear required to connect weapons and other equipment.

The torpedo room of an attack sub is the T7 equivalent of a missile
bay. The gun decks of a ship of the line are the T5 equivalent, and
the forward phaser banks of the Enterprise A (mounted on the edge of
the disc ) are the TF equivalent.

The main gun turrets on a TL 6 battleship are also examples of bay 
weapons. They probably take up almost as much space internally 
(mechanisms and ammo stores) as they do externally.

Check out the bay weapons on the Azhanti High Lightning class
Frontier Cruiser/Fleet Intruder. Lots of internal space operating some
honking big turrets.

It would be a problem if your ship design sequence had strict rules on
surface area and final volume - Bay Weapons were introduced in
High Guard, and didn\'t worry much about the details.

Also, what about the possibility of a race that reproduces by cloning

In these instances, there are at least several individuals with the 
same genetic code.  (In the case of a racial cloning process as part 
of the life cycle, this could stretch into hundreds or more).  
Certainly genetic code is a part of the process, but what else can be

Imperium, and Jump-4 vs Jump-6 networks, mostly in relation to 
interstellar communication for trade, law enforcement, and 
communication.  In a somewhat related thread, we\'ve discussed 
Languages in Traveller.  IMTU, the vastness of space enforces several 
situations regarding communication gaps.  Because of the travel time 
between worlds, I imagine starports and the worlds they represent in 
a similar situation to the cities of the United States\' Wild West era 
of the last century.  Often these cities had to rely on old news and 
independent local agencies to deal with issues, due to the 
communication lag.  Messages, etc were carried by Pony Express from 
town to town (like the Xboat network) or by passers-through 
(merchants or travellers).  The Imperium has to handle communication 
problems such as these, and it serves as a great model for the 
concept.

Due to the separation of areas, each world develops a lot more 
independently, culturally, the further it is from frequent contact 
with the rest of the Imperium.  Major stops along the Xboat route 
have very mainstream cultures, similar to the phenomenon observed in 
the eastern seaboard of the USA during the last century.  The farther 
from the cultural centers, the more diverse the culture becomes.  Add 
in a slew of minor races, and the effect is exaggerated.  The 
Imperial Encyclopedia re-inforces the concept that many worlds have 
their own language, which may or may not be related to Galanglic.  
However, Galanglic is the official language of 3I, and many cultures 
must deal with multi-lingual interfaces, similar to the Cajuns of the 
Louisiana bayous speaking with outsiders, or the French/English 
multi-lingual labels of Canada.  These just give a few of the 
examples that can be used from the Real World (tm) to cover similar 
situations in the 3I.

In my personal opinion, and this does not necessarily reflect the 
opinion of others on this list, there is a basic Imperial culture 
practiced at starports and major cultural world, which loses some of 
its footing on lower tech worlds and in the backwaters of frontier 
worlds.  Languages vary here, and the average Imperial tourist is 
hard-kept to keep up with the accented speech of a local guide.  And 
as for news and other communication problems, while technology can 
give time-stamped flags so that the latest data to arrive 
in-system is filtered to insure the most up-to-date information in 
the starport databanks, worlds are almost always a little behind 
within a few parsecs of the source.  But this is just IMTU.

I think that German is more likely to take the place of French.  No

German is more widespread than French and is likely to stay so.

There will be a difference between the 3i and the American Wild West.
The locals, except on the most marginal or isolationist of planets, will
have regular access to recorded audio and audio-enabled video from
more mainstream planets. Audio records should exist of every
Emperor\'s coronation address from Cleon I forward, and will be just
one example of speech patterns frozen in time.

I\'m not saying there won\'t be linguistic drift or local accents and
dialects, I\'m saying that the continuous presence of recorded speech
will damp the drift and development. That dirt farmer needs to understand
the "common" galanglic dialect, or he won\'t be able to listen to the
audio reference chip on how to maintain his harvester unit - which was
probably recorded on the hi-pop high-industry world four parsecs
away where the harvester was made.

An aside, though: you may find people stressing an almost
incomprehensible accent for cultural or planetary pride reasons.
I\'ve heard that the Pavel Checkov and Montgomery Scott characters
on Star Trek were speaking with such heavy accents for just such
reasons, and Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler) of the X-Men spoke
perfect English - the German accent and phrases were literally
done (by this natural swashbuckler character) for effect.

Well, thrust has been optionally based on mass since FF&S v1 ;).  5t per dton
is probably reasonable for loosely packed cargo -- things in boxes, etc.  If
anything, it might be high -- typical boxes used for transport of stuff to
stores and the like are probably about a third of a cubic meter, and probably
don\'t weight over 50 kilos.  However, material that can be packed solidly
(grain, ore, liquids) is much denser.

Hm?  Why specifically do we want to encourage that?  Streamlining is cheaper
than carrying a shuttle until your ship is quite large, and ports which are
likely to have a decent shuttle force of their own most likely also have a
highport, so streamlining is sort of irrelevant.

Ah...long term dispute.  To be honest, _any_ ship in traveller, streamlined or
not, is probably capable of planetfall, provided it has enough thrust to exceed
local gravity.

Why do you want a heavily armored ship?  Are you a warship?  You can accomplish
the same goal with sandcasters for less weight and money.  To be honest, 20-30
turrets is sufficient to scare off most ethically challenged individuals (ten
triple sand, ten triple laser, ten triple missile, for example).  Remember,
merchants are usually fond of lowering their costs, and anything that cuts down
on the ability to carry more cargo hurts.

AHL treats bays as enormous pop up turrets (those are the 12 dorsal triple

FT is a starship minatures combat system written by Ground Zero Games in
the UK (published by Geohex in the US). It is reasonably generic but does
have its own universe. It\'s quite fast, fun and cheap.

Yeah, the exhachange rate from Hi Pop Low tech (TL8) Starport X worlds for

You are right - I kept breaking the motion up into three components so that
I could explain it to my players, but fundementally all you have is the ship
rolling along the thrust axis and rotating around the center of gravity.

Once they restored power, they did secure the cargo.  One of the really good
breaks they got that night (i.e. the dice favored them) was that the cargo
handling controls were intact and accessible.

IMTU, to vent a compartment using a sphincter hatch you must have the
override codes.  That, however,  assumes that the hatch has power.  There is
a manual \'handwheel\' (a fitting that can be turned by hand or serves as an
attachment point for a crank or powered door opener) that is only operable
when there is no power.  Explosive decompression was not an issue, as once
the seal was broken, the existing atmosphere leaked out through the seal.

Admittedly, if there were survivors on the far side, it would not have been
a good thing - but during their run in to the planet (the wreck was in
orbit), sensors showed that the ship was at environmental temperatures (i.e.
power not being used to keep the ship at habitable temperatures), and that
it was surrounded by a \'halo\' of H2 (from leaking tanks).  The ship was also
\'fuzzy\' on the sensors (from debris surrounding the ship).

Basically, they were pretty sure going onto the ship that the only possible
survivors would be in low berth.

By Milieu free I mean it contains design sequences from TL0 through to
TL17+ and background on the Traveller Universe overall, plus library data
and equipment in the same TL range. It also includes starship design (maybe
simplified).

Then a milieu book could contain caps (in the same way that TNE originally
sold the generic \'technical architecture") for TLs plus special rules. Ie
ship design notes like the old Alien Modules (GDW ones).

Yes, a full set which could be used as a \'Milieu-lite\' version of Traveller
- - rules inside with generic background material for the whole timeline.
Conversely, the Milieu books would be \'rules-lite\' with a cut down
Traveller rule set (eg no QSDS equivalent). This means that you maintain an
SAEP tailored to the Milieu but avoid irritating the players who own Basic
Traveller and bought the Milieu book as background.

The rules set (\'Basic Traveller\') should differ from the Milieu rules by
having all the useful little extra rules - stuff like the nice to haves
about special combat situations and so on. This also gives someone who
starts from an SAEP an incentive to buy Basic if they like the rules. At
the same time, basic supports the homespun campaign anywhere (either
outside the Imperium setting or anywhere in the timeline). It also provides
basic details for Milieu 0 (200 Imperial) which won\'t make a buyer of the
M0 (M200?) book feel ripped off. It is also a hook to fish existing
Traveller players into the new system.

Although I can see an attraction for the Civil War period instead of M0 -
Wars with the Zhodani, a partial developed Marches, a functioning Imperial
bureaucracy iognoring or making do with the squabbling admirals.

Logically, this is a great book to have the kind of details found in
Cyberpunk\'s _Deep Space_, the details of lower tech life in space. Plus a
low tech QSDS for ion drives etc.

Not meant as criticism....

independent types a-la Han Solo. such independents would no doubt dispense
with formal salaries - relying purely on the profit margin.
  * Class discount of 20%...this hearkens back to the CT days, but I like
it, so I still use it IMTU.

a ship.

lowering power plant cost.

the individual merchant in mind, the Khushdakaa (Vilani for 
"Opportunity") is a small design capable of being operated by a 
single individual (the normal crew complement, a pilot and a 
navigator, can be replaced with an indivudal handling both jobs). 
This makes it perfect for the enterprising captain wishing to ply 
the space lanes in search of profit and adventure. The small size 
also makes the Khushdakaa extremely affordable: with standard 20% 
discounts (normal for mass produced designs) the ship costs less 
than 18MCr.

Even though it is small and inexpensive, the Khushdakaa performs 
admirably. Nearly forty-five percent of its volume is devoted to 
cargo space (in the form of four 11 ton cargo bays and a single 1 
ton luggage bay), allowing plenty of room for speculative trading. 
The craft has four staterooms - two on the command deck, and two 
on the cargo deck. The freighter is designed to allow two passengers 
in meager comfort on the cargo deck, while the upper staterooms 
are used for the crew. If the ship is operated by a single individual,
the twin crew staterooms can be combined into a larger room/office 
suite. The ship has complete life support and personnel facilities 
on each deck, allowing passengers to be completely separated from the 
crew. This ensures in-flight security, a serious concern for 
independent merchants. If no passengers are desired, the passenger 
cabins can be taken out, freeing up an additional 4 tons of cargo 
space (separate from the main hold).

The Khushdakaa is powered by a single GRN-95 fusion reactor, 
producing 42MW of power nominally. The GRN-95 is a low maintenance, 
sturdy design that has proven to be quite reliable. The ship carries 
enough fuel for an entire year of power plant operation. The design 
is such that no user intervention, for maintenance or fueling, should 
be required until the ship\'s annual maintenance period. The ship has 
a power shortfall of 3.91 megawatts. This causes no serious problems, 
however, as the turret and fuel purification plant use 1.48 megawatts, 
and can be taken off line. In addition, the craft powers down its grav 
compensators during atmospheric operations. Should the turret (and any 
weapon mounted in it) or the purification plant be needed, the 
contra-grav systems can be powered down, freeing as much as 10 
megawatts. For emergencies, the ship has a bank of batteries capable 
of providing life support (minus grav plates) radios, and sensors for 
nearly two weeks.

Jumpspace operation is provided by a TM-71 jump drive, mounted 
alongside the fusion plant. The TM-71 is a zero-maintenance unit, 
capable of operating within its operational guidelines for over a year 
with no maintenance. The operational range of the Khushdakka is 1.08 
parsecs per week, nominal. Fuel storage is provided for 140 cubic meters 
of hydrogen, enough for a single jump at maximum range. 

The ship is equipped with exterior fuel rams and a complete purification 
system for allow for frontier refueling from gas giants or planetary 
surfaces. The single purification unit can purify the entire fuel supply 
in under 5 hours. As stated above, the Khushdakaa has enough baffled 
fuel tanks to allow one Jump-1. However, internal fuel hookups in the 
cargo bays can facilitate additional fuel storage tanks, at the expense 
of cargo space. Thus, the ship can make multiple jumps to reach 
distant destinations (each 11 ton cargo bay can be refitted as a 
10 ton fuel pod using collapsable fuel tanks available at any class A, 
B, or C starport).

For normal propulsion, the ship is equipped with twin U-9 thruster pods 
and a contra-grav system. The contra grav system can offset upto .5Gs 
of gravitational force when the ship is loaded, allowing the Khushdakaa\'s 
thrusters to achieve orbit. The design of the thrusters is unique - they 
are mounted on two pods on either side of the ship, on each on an 
independently rotatable axis.Thus, the drives can be swiveled downward 
for VTOL flight during takeoff and landing, and then rotated into a 
forward position for normal flight. In addition, since the drives are 
mounted independent of each other, they can be positioned at different 
angles. This makes the Khushdakaa an extremely nimble ship, able to 
perform in flight maneuvers that are impressive for a mere 1G craft. 
While the drives themselves are reliable, the translation equipment 
needs to be monitored and to ensure proper operation.

For dirtside operation, the Khushdakaa has room for a single 2-ton 
air/raft in a cramped docking slip. If the air/raft is not needed, 
the slip can be used for an additional 2 tons of cargo.

For self defence, the Khushdakaa has an empty standard 42m3 turret, 
capable of mounting a variety of light weaponry. The turret is slaved 
to the cockpit for control.

The Khushdakaa is a poor performer when operating only with freight 
and passengers - it is able to turn a modest profit only if it operates 
at 100% efficiency, which is a rare occurance for all but the most 
skilled traders. However, the enterprising captain should be able to 
turn a tidy profit by engaging in spectulative trading. Its admirable 
performance, ease of use, and low cost make it the perfect choice for 
the independent free trader. It should also be noted that for an
independent trader, the salaries can be dispensed with, improving
annual income by over 150,000Cr. 

Variations: It has already been noted that fuel tanks can be mounted
in the cargo pods. In addition, many captains customize the pods,
installing low berths, staterooms, or even weapons within. All of
these changes are custom performed by the owners, and are not
available from the maneufacturer. It should be noted that the cargo
pods are not pods in the truest sense - they cannot be detatched 
without severe structural work in a drydock.

PRESS RELEASE

Udararuukin is pleased to announce the launching of its newest
freighter, the Khushdakaa class light freighter. Designed for 
the individual merchant in mind, the Khushdakaa (Vilani for 
"Opportunity") is a small design capable of being operated by a 
single individual (the normal crew complement, a pilot and a 
navigator, can be replaced with an indivudal handling both jobs). 
This makes it perfect for the enterprising captain wishing to ply 
the space lanes in search of profit and adventure. The small size 
also makes the Khushdakaa extremely affordable: with standard 20% 
discounts (normal for mass produced designs) the ship costs less 
than 18MCr.

Even though it is small and inexpensive, the Khushdakaa performs 
admirably. Nearly forty-five percent of its volume is devoted to 
cargo space (in the form of four 11 ton cargo bays and a single 1 
ton luggage bay), allowing plenty of room for speculative trading. 
The craft has four staterooms - two on the command deck, and two 
on the cargo deck. The freighter is designed to allow two passengers 
in meager comfort on the cargo deck, while the upper staterooms 
are used for the crew. If the ship is operated by a single individual,
the twin crew staterooms can be combined into a larger room/office 
suite. The ship has complete life support and personnel facilities 
on each deck, allowing passengers to be completely separated from the 
crew. This ensures in-flight security, a serious concern for 
independent merchants. If no passengers are desired, the passenger 
cabins can be taken out, freeing up an additional 4 tons of cargo

That\'s the right answer, Dom, but I didn\'t ask the question.  I\'m
the one that used the acronym in the first place.  Heck, some of
my best friends are LEOs... and HRTs, CERTs, TOUs, DOCs, ERTs, CSOs,

  Just for reference, it looks like the termini of JumpExpress services in the
Marches could be Trin, with two Jumps (via a tanker) getting you to Mora and
thence off the map through Sabine sub-sector. Rhylanor would be linked up via
JE F5\'s - two week service requiring 5-6 dedicated vessels for the link (at an
absolute maximum)*.

  If the Imperium suggested better corporate citizenship as a proviso for the
LIC, then Regina could be added the same as Rhylanor, and Glisten could be
linked
to Trin using a handful of JE F6\'s making two jumps/run.

  If the 3I wants Glisten linked directly to Mora, then they can $#@%& well do
it themselves - three connections for a lousy billion-odd customers?

 * Please check drop-box pick-up dates; the next delivery may not be for a week.

  Logically, "The Courier Company" (fka JumpExpress) also has a bump policy
for parcels that won\'t fit on weekly runs (assuming that data files are more
important to overall customer satisfaction), and maybe sends a 200-tonner per
month to clean up such accumulations.

  IAC, a J-5 link (running weekly) between Regina and Mora would require less
than BCr 1 to establish, and run in four jumps, compared to the possible dozen
or more for the little green lines of worm castings on the maps.

> "Microwaving half-baked ideas from across the Galaxy"

  Don\'t you think that the delays might be a bit unreasonable? :)

  Hey, you know that if those contract-required low berths are mobile
that we could ship a popsicle from Trin to Capital at J-5+ (with a 
bonus for the pilots and some heavy liability limitations)? Cool.

        Yours truly,
                Steven Hudson

I would have thought you were wrong, but according to
http://www.sil.org/ethnologue/top100.html, the Ethnologue, you\'re right.
German has 98M versus French\'s 72M. Note the positions of Bengali and
Hindi however (4th and 5th behind Chinese, English & Spanish). They seem
somehow absent on all the lists posted so far...

Marc, 

German happens to be the thrid largest language base in use....

The German language

German is one of the large group of Indo-Germanic languages, and within that
one of the Germanic languages. It is thus related to Danish, Norwegian,
Swedish, Dutch and Flemish, but also to English. The emergence of a common
High German language is attributed to Martin Luther\'s translation of the
Bible.

Germany has a wealth of dialects. It is usually possible to determine a
German\'s native region from his or her dialect and pronunciation. If a Frisian
or a Mecklenburger and a Bavarian were to carry on a conversation in their
respective pure dialects, they would have great difficulty understanding each
other.

Moreover, while the country was divided the two German states developed a
different political vocabulary. New words were coined which were not
necessarily understood in the other parts of the country. Nevertheless, the
common language was one of the links which held the divided nation together.

German is also spoken as the native language in Austria, Liechtenstein, most
of Switzerland, South Tirol (northern Italy) and in small areas of Belgium,
France (Alsace) and Luxembourg along the German border. The German minorities
in Poland, Romania and the countries of the former Soviet Union have partly
retained the German language as well.

German is the native language of more than 200 million people. About one in
every ten books published throughout the world has been written in German. As
regards translations into foreign languages, German is third after English and
French, and more works have been translated into German than into any other
language.

 I dealt with this by assuming some of the (quite considerable) expense
for the turret itself goes into some form of stabilizer equipment based on
normal jump drive technology. (This would take up some of the 1 D.TON
inside the ship.) The 3% (stabilized) volume in excess of ship tonnage
would then be the limit the jump governor can handle without serious
reworking.

 Of course an unstabilized object latched on to the hull would be torn to
shreds at jump initiation, quite possibly causing a catastrophic collapse
in the jump bubble. (This would of course mean, that insystem ships have
no theoretical limit for the amount of turrets.)   

 BTW can anybody tell me what components go into the actual turret weapons
in G:T. I\'ve been trying to recreate these with GURPS Vehicles, and the
numbers just don\'t seem to add up.
 The main problems (so far) are:

 1) What type of power bank was used? The only way I can get the (G)TL-12
values right is to use the "power slug" option from UTT (multiply volume
and mass by 40). Or am I just forgetting some vital component?

 2) What makes the (G)TL-10 version so much heavier, the only component I
can see that would be heavier at lower TL are power banks, which make up
only a tiny fraction of total mass (even if the "power slug" option _is_
in use).

 Any people here who had something to do with designing these? I could
really use some help!

Even though I\'m not a big fan of the French (esp. in 2300AD ;-) ), French
is one of the languages of diplomacy.  If for that reason alone, I could
see it retaining widespread use, if only among the diplomats.

Like Richard spake (I mean, said) <G>...

Citing the site that Ethan looked at, though, Germany has 121 million
including second language speakers, and French 124 million, for what
that is worth.  

I think German has more in the way of the science community (completely
unfounded but its my impression) and is the common language in many of
the former Warsaw Pact countries....before Russian.  Many (most?)
Russians speak German and English as their "second" language.  Millions
in South America too.

French was the language of state, but is it still?  English is the
language of money and perhaps state now.  The areas you cite as being
French speakers I don\'t see as being so influential in the development
of the stars, as I would see the German speakers.  I\'d say it has
something to do with the drive of the individual people groups...  

I could be wrong there, as you are the author of this official future
history. <G>

signature (about the same as a 100-dTon ship - DS-1 doesn\'t have a black 
or chamelon coating.  Range is about 12. DS-1 was effectively a 
previously-detected target (+1.5) since they have a good radar position; 
Palomar is on an atmosphere-6 world (-0.5); and they\'re scanning a single hex
(+1), so the total signature is 13 - 1 -
12 + 1.5 - 0.5 +1 = 2, an automatic detection (which it pretty much was - 
it stands out very clearly in the image.)

There is the story of when Lord Palmerston saw the first British steam
powered warship among the wooden walls of the RN, he described it as
\'Looking like a black snake among the rabbits\'.

Remember, a National is a close structure, which means it could be built in
modules, which are then connected in orbit.

Streamlining in G:T costs 20% of your internal volume, which means you
could put in a 20 dton craft in a vehicle bay for 21 dtons, compared to the
40 dtons needed to streamline a 200 dton ship. OK, you will have to
transfer the cargo in zero gee, but it\'s doable and saves 19 dtons of cargo
capacity.

I want to encourage it, because I want PCs to be able to park their
economically viable trading ship on planet occasionally, so they dont have
to leave the Engineer in orbit with the ship.

I used my words carefully ... \'too many bits sticking out\' is a euphemism

vicious.

Sandcasters take up volume, at 1 dton per 3. Under the G:T rules, armour
does not take up volume.

D starport, thanks. You can buy unrefined LHyd, and we have a number of

It\'s hugely ethno-centric of you to think that any European language 
(except English) rates in the top 10 in the world. Although German
just squeaks in (below Russian, Portugese and Spanish though), there
are vast, vast numbers of people in India and the general Indian 
subcontinent region that speak Hindu, Bengali, Telgu, Tamil, Urdu,
Gujarati, Malayalam, Kannada, Oriya, Panjabi, etc etc. Although they
may, on average, not be as affluent as the average westerner, there
are a lot of them and they are by no means backward - India has some
mightly fine research facilities and they hide a pretty mean nuclear
device to boot. Given a chance to get out of a fairly harsh climate
(both as a result of natural disasters and overpopulation), I think
"Indians" (for lack of a better name) would get the heck out and start
settling some new worlds pretty fast. By the time the Solomani Rim
has a place on the interstellar maps, I imagine you hear a heck of a lot
more Hindi than either French or German. Heck, Hindi is probably already
as old as the Third Imperium is in 1120. :)

And that 20 dt shuttle costs a couple of megacredits, and adds 30-40 tons of
weight (thus requiring more manuever drives), and without having a second
shuttle you can\'t do fuel scooping (in fact, you can\'t obtain fuel at all
unless there\'s some at the highport), and significantly increases loading and
unloading time.  These are not negligible effects, particularly at low-grade
starports -- and the simple truth is, PC starships (_regardless_ of design) are
only viable at low-grade starports.  Multi-kiloton bulk freighters can undercut
them every time as long as there\'s sufficient cargo transit and facilities on
the route to support the larger freighters.

Not to something with the size and density of a traveller starship, at the
pressures in the upper atmosphere.  A ship with the average aerodynamic
streamlining of your average modern surface ship (which is to say, functionally
none) will be fine.  Obviously, you can design a ship which wouldn\'t withstand
low velocity atmospheric entry (large folding sensor arrays, for example), but
that\'s because it has components which are incapable of entering atmosphere
(regardless of actual streamlining of the hull) -- the hull itself will be
_fine_ for any ship capable of withstanding one G.

Well, sort of.  The armor doesn\'t take up volume, but the manuever drives
required to support the armor do.  For a 170,000 sf ship, +100 DR is 850 tons. 
Manuever drives to move this weight at 1 G are 21+ spaces and 3.4 MCr.  One
extra sandcaster is 1 space (plus 1/8 space manuever) and costs .27 MCr
including the extra manuever.  Unless you\'re expecting to defend against 10+
ships at once, the sandcasters are a better bargain.

centuries, there is still a significant Francophone population.  Quebec

Interesting thing about Stargrunt:

There are Miniatures!

I can\'t remember if they are 25mm or 20mm, but they\'re nice, and don\'t have
Warhammer style inflato-weapons.  Just right for Striker II (or Striker I,
if you tweak the base sizes).  They\'ve got vehicles, too, which are quite
FF&Sable.

Another thought:  do any of you gearheads design stuff other than ships?

Hang on.  Get a map of the Ziru Sirka.  Turn it ninety degrees, so Terra is

Hmm..  My problem with churning out lots of alien races is that they need a
fair amount of work if they aren\'t to start suffering from "human in a dog
suit" syndrome, or need to become more than bugs to shoot.

While a skeleton model of some kind is a good idea, it needs to be stressed
that a lot of description is need.

Oh, and the "human in a dog suit" crack isn\'t really a gripe about the
Vargr - they\'re OK, but most other (non-uplifted) species shouldn\'t really
be like that.

A few years ago I was living in Papua New Guinea.  PNG has the highest
density of languages in the world.  When I was there I met
illiterate/barely literate people who could speak multiple languages.

One was a classic case:  a Grade One dropout, effectively totally
illiterate - Edu 2-3?? Int about average, I guess.

She spoke 7 languages:  English, Motu and Pidgin ( the three common
languages of PNG)
Her parents\' two languages (they were from different sides of the country)
Two languages she had learnt from friends.

Her English, while hardly grammatically correct, was right up there with a
native speaker.
Her Motu, according to another friend, who was a native Motu speaker, was
"Polis Motu" (Police Motu) - a pidginised dialect originally established
for the convenience of lazy colonial administrators.  Pure Motu has sounds
that aren\'t in English.  She used Motu as a daily language - ie was fluent.
Her Pidgin was also a daily language - ie was fluent.
I don\'t know about her grasp of her parents\' languages.
She admitted that her grasp of the other two languages she spoke was weaker
than that of the five above...

Granted, she was an exceptional case:  her parents were from different
groups, and she lived in the city, rather than in a village in the boonies.
 Further, there would be no chance of her being able to talk meaningfully
about quantum mechanics, or anything that would require a higher education.

A more typical example would be: one native language, plus one of the
common languages, plus English for anyone who attended school (PNG schools
use an Australian curriculum).

The point of my example above is that it is possible to have multiple
"native languages".  The woman I described learnt all her languages in
childhood, and uses several of them on a daily basis.  I\'ve even heard here
use three of them in a single conversation...

There are canon references to clones, particularly in Regency Sourcebook. 
Apparently Strephon\'s duplicates were clones, and Norris of Regina\'s
"daughter" Seldrian was apparently a modified clone (with another X
chromosome instead of a Y, apparently - sounds "easy" enough).

RSB says, in fact, that it was customary in the 3I for noble heirs to be
cloned at birth.  Norris wasn\'t, as he was a second son.  Presumably clones
can\'t inherit noble positions.  

Then again, CT Adventure 1 (Kinunir) has a noble locked up in a prison
hulk, for unspecified reasons.  Is this a clone of Norris\' elder brother -
a "Man In The Iron Mask"?  (Of course, it could also be Norris himself, if
this bit of the Adventure is assumed to occur during the FFW, shortly
before the expedition to find the (ahem)...  Oops, I nearly gave away the
plot of Kinunir - has anyone run it recently, or are they thinking about
it?  I am, actually.)

These are clones in the Imperium.  The Solomani, of course, are the
"specialist" genetic engineers.

Yes, clones happen.  Have fun!

Actually, I see First Contact as the story of a revolution.  Terra starts
out balkanised, without the jump drive, and confined to a single star
system (ESA long range colonisation aside), and ends up united, with the
jump drive, and with several colonies/outposts.  If you start around 2077,
say, and end around 2120, a single PC could have been involved in it all!

Of course, this would include the First Interstellar War, and thus encroach
on the Interstellar Wars milieu, but the 1st IW would differ from the
others in that the Terrans are using TL 9/10, rather than TL10/11, would
have less developed colonies, less information, less coordination between
fleets, and generally be making it up as they go along.

This could really rock.  You could start off with sub-light "torch" ships,
kind of like the "clipper" sailing ships of last century - the highest
development of a technology about to be superceded.  Then you graduate to
J-0.1 turkeys, with the resulting race to build J-0.2, J-0.3 and better
ships (the race could be to improve navigational and manufacturing
techniques, rather than the actual drives themselves).  Then there is First
Contact, exploration of nearby systems (developing the required techniques
on the fly!), contact with the Vegans and other minor races, colonisation,
political and other conflicts between the not-in-the-slightest-bit-united
nations of Earth, arms buildups (but for use against who, exactly??), and
of course the Interstellar War...

This IS Traveller, and it all happens in a single lifetime....

Obviously they didn\'t own any robots!  I wouldn\'t have gone in there for
quids, if I could have sent in some cheap, dumb and nasty droid.  

Actually, there is a fun/reality mismatch here.  For fun, the PCs should go
in.  In reality, you would, IF you had one available ( & could afford it),
send in some cheap dumbot instead - something like one of the gadgets they
use at Chernobyl, IIRC.  Let\'s face it, why take the risk of any EVA work,
if you can do it with a droid.  Even today, EVA mainly happens when
equipment fails.

Such a bot wouldn\'t be that expensive: a propulsion system, a
shortish-duration power source, a rudimentary brain, some sensors, and a
command/communications suite.  It could save your crew\'s life...

This one is important.  The common language of Indonesia is Bahasa
Indonesia, not Javanese.  Bahasa Indonesia is a close relative of Bahasa
Malaysia, and was adopted as a national language when Indonesia became
independent.  (Javanese is a big language in its own right)

IMTU, Indonesia and to a lesser extent Malaysia, Singapore etc were closely
associated with the Australian space program.  Actually they provided most
of its industrial base...

In the real world, these countries were until recently industrialising
quite nicely.

They will be out there!

Having lived in central Pennsylvania for the past 25 years, this is only
true with the Amish, a minor percentage of the population.  More prevelent
though, is the idiom that is used with english.  A lot of the older, and
the less educated among the younger, residents use German sentance
structure for a fair bit of their english grammer.  For ex:  "Throw me down
the stairs my hat" would be used instead of  "Throw my hat down the stairs
to me."  

With this, I think even the same language could have different meanings,
even though it sounds the same.

My family is from backwater Pennsylvania... I wish this were 
the case, as I\'d love to speak more German.  

The Pennsylvania communities which held onto their non-English 
languages were doing so only through and because of "late coming" 
immigrants.  After the flow of Europeans stopped the pocket 
communities of Pennsylvania rapidly disappeared.  There are
some areas where German is still spoken, but they are
not as prevalent as the French communities in other parts 
of North America.

Then again... 
   a space colony of Amish would be an interesting thing. ;-)

20dtons of cargo space earns KCr 40 revenue per month. This will support a
couple of megacredits in extra sticker cost. Plus you can have express
cargo already in the ship\'s boat, ready for the first trip down.

Smaller ships can and have competed with bigger ones on the same route,
*provided* they are prepared to load, up and go immediatly. None of this
one week stuffing around waiting for a cargo ... when the cargo shows up,
you *go*.

Personally, I believe that you should be able to load the LHyd equivalent
of 44 gallon drums of AvGas onto your gig at the downport, and then
transfer them back off the gig and into the tanks. It\'s a bitch of a job,
but it strikes me as doable (the airport at Currie on King Island used 44
gallon drums of avgas to refuel the light planes that landed on the island).

Now, according to p119 of G:T it takes 18 minutes to escape Earth\'s
gravitational field at 2 gees, so I\'d say that a one hour round trip is
reasonable.

I am perfectly happy with the level of streamlining on a modern surface
ship (ie it\'s a cow ... dont expect to play with grav fighters in the
atmosphere) being available, just as long as it costs less than 20% of the
volume of the ship.

Make \'partial streamlining\' cost 10% of ship volume, maximum 10 dtons, and
I\'ll come to the party. Stubby wings, minimal lift, blobs of plastic over
the sensor arrays ...

The other consideration is that armour doesnt need crew.

The Decafreighter massed a lot to start with, so it only pulled 0.6 gees.

Lots of light fighters are a viable method of conducting piracy ... but at
the end of the day, it\'s a design decision. If purchasers want a 10kt
heavily-armoured ship, they buy a FS Decafreighter. If they want a 10kt
ship with lots of sandcasters, they buy something else.

Assuming an even representation of Solomani in Space, I would agree.

However, my view of history suggest to me that as Terrans move
to space, the populations (and their languages) will not be proportionally
represented.

IMHO, the languages of the technologically advanced contries will
dominate.  (English, Mandarin, Japanese, German, Russian,

Additionally, the French as a whole, have been so adamant about
maintaining the integrity of its language, I doubt very strongly that
the Rule of Man will wipe it out entirely, just minimize it proliferation.

Also New Braunfels, Texas.  You can still find some non-English
speakers out there, though most have had English as a Second language
now.

In Minnesota and Wisconsin, most Scandanavian tongues are still
represented out in the boonies.

This seems to be based _solely_ on population.
Thats where it fails.  It is completely erroneous to
assume that all in the UK and US speak English as their
native language.

The prevalence of French, German, Spanish, and other
languages is much higher when you consider them as
second languages.  Many of the the African populations
have an African native language but learn French _and/or_
English as a second language.

A huge percentage of allegedy native English speakers
speak Spanish both as a native and second languages.

I don\'t think there is any accurate way to quantify these.
I think that list cannot be relied upon for any degree of
accuracy.

I\'m a long time lurker, first time writer (well at least for a long time
anyway) and have a question regarding densitometers. What do they measure?

Ones first reaction would be (duh) density, but this is not a force unto
itself. The MT ImpEncyc (sorry but I live in the Dark Ages) states that it
is a spin off of gravitic technology that uses an objects natural gravity
to measure its density. The problem with this is that often, if you are
doing a search of space for an object, you don\'t know exactly the size of
the object (hence its gravity signature).

From first principles, not knowing the distance, volume or size of an
object makes a scan near useless. However, once an object has been located
(either by passive or active EMS), a lock by LADAR (or similar means) can
be used to determine range, which (plugging into the formula) gives and
accurate mass.

IMTU I\'m using the formula - gravity = mass x constant / distance squared.
Is this a fair assumption? I\'m not sure of the constant (I\'m at work) but
6.667 x 10-11 seems to ring a bell.  Anyway, I\'m interested as to how
densitometers are worked IYTU.

Intresting.  Pick one of those concepts, and flesh it out abit more.
No stats, not yet, just abit of background.  :)  To help you out, i\'ll
tell you what kinda game i\'m planning on running....



        The game starts off on a small planet named \'Seran\', but mostly
known as \'Dirtball\' to its inhabitants.  It\'s mostly a desert planet,
which is home to one indigenous reptilian minor race (details will be
provided, if needed.)  There is only one large body of water, though
smaller bodies are more common.  The planet has been under Imperial
Martial Law for several years now, a condition that shows no signs
of showing down;  most people have gotten used to it, though afew
people still oppose the situation.

        The population of the planet is 6 (around 7 million, most of
them in the single large city), with a class III starport.

        The campaign is going to start off with the players acting
individually, and will gradually get togther.  We\'re going to start
on the planet, and hopefully move off into space together.  :)

Remember that the colonization of space in Trav is not a "conquer the
natives" scenario as most of Terran colonization, and therefore
language spread, has been.  They find a superior and, in their minds,
hostile universe out there.  It takes centuries to conquer.  In that
time I see multiple languages as a problem that will need to be
overcome.  Certainly, many cultural enclaves will maintain their
native tongues, but the starfaring peoples willlargely be the techical
a combat trained types who will need to use a common language.  That
common language will be the first to reach most worlds.  It will be
the language of communication.  It will be the language of reports
related back to Terra and it\'s colonies.

What language will it be?  Who cares.  It will be a fairly easy to
learn, simple to conjugate core language.  Added to it will be nearly
every important word from every Terran language still spoken and
several that aren\'t.  The core will contain all that is important for
technical and military interaction.  It will be the language of
instruction, warning and merchandising.  It will be born of necessity
to facilitate the rapid growth of technology, colonization and
military capability.  Consider "Starship Troopers".  How much time was
spent arguing over what language would be best to use?

Like I said, sorry to butt in.  I\'ll shut up, now.

My take is that Cleon himself began its ruin as a
megacorporation. Since he expected his family to control the
throne, he concentrated on growing the Imperium with less
attention to the business portion of ZE. When Cleon II abdicated, 
ZE was partitioned between public and private holdings. The
portion that remained in the Zhunatsu family lost its
technological advantage and increasingly lost favored status as
prime contractor for the Imperium.  Cleon II was no better a
businessman than a ruler, and his absentee managers far less
competent than Artemsus was as emperor.  Hence ZE never expanded
much beyond Core sector, though it remained an important second-
rank company during the early centuries of the Imperium. I\'d
attribute its final decline to Cleon the Mad.

I\'ve been looking into this myself and happen to have a 1996
Astrophysics textbook checked out from the local university
library. Although the spectral type, luminosity, and temperature
of star are correlated with its mass and composition, the
relationship is not simple and it\'s best to use a table.
Masses are estimated from observation of binary systems.

However, Stellar radii (and thus diameters) are usually
calculated from the luminosity (based on observable magnitude and
estimated distance) and estimated temperature (derived from the
spectrum).

Reading Vilani&Vargr p15 you see that in ancient times was one language.
this evolved in many dialects and languages, but before the space travels
one was prevalent, Old High Vilani, the scholastic form is Clasical Written
Vilani, the evolution of the Old High Vilani is the modern Vilani and its
sub-languages, the use of the correct sub-language is detrmined by the
social circustances.

The principal Vargr Languages are Gvegh (used in the Zhodani
Marches),Logaksu(in Lair),Aekhu (in Deneb), Gvegh-Aekhu(overlap in
gvurrdon), Urzaeng(Coreward Windhorn), Ovaghoun(Provence,Windhorn, and

An old Dragon magazine published some pretty good rules (at least covering

If I recall correctly, late model densitometers can actually use the
objects gravity to map the interior of the object, since open spaces
produce less gravity (gas having less mass than the bulkheads). Older
models are basically a gravitic force measuring device, giving a direction
to the object exerting the most gravitic force on you at a given range.

Your formula above looks as if it uses an objects apparent volume to
compute mass, which if the density of the object is known, will work.
However, in a typical encounter in space, there would be to many other
unknowns for this to work. It would still give a rough idea, but don\'t put
away that densitometer yet.

 And neither is gravity BTW.

  IMO a densitometer based on measuring the actual gravitational
attraction of the target object is not too plausible. (I assume this is
what you are talking about, correct me if I\'m wrong.) The attraction of
even a starship sized object would be lost in the interference caused by
the surrounding solar system even if you tried to measure it just a few
thousand klicks away. Some other principle (probably one modern physics
knows nothing about) must be at work here.
 
 Essentially you\'re right, howewer, to get density from gravity (whichever
way you measured the latter) you definitely need volume, and even some
rough idea of shape.

  IMTU densitometers have two distinct uses:
 1) Long range scan: This uses a network of laser interferometers on the
ship\'s hull (yes, that would mean densitometers consume hull area) to
detect nanometer scale fluctuations in the hull\'s dimensions caused by
gravitational waves put out by other massive objects.
  This is good for finding planets and other bodies in a star system you
just jumped into, as well as detecting any jump emergence signatures and
active reactionless drives within a few AU of you.    
 
 2) Short range scan: At much closer (visual) ranges the info from the
interferometer network can be combined with PEMS/AEMS scan of the object
in question to produce at least an educated guess of the object\'s internal
structure (lots of computing power involved here). What this is good for
is left to each individual\'s own sick imagination. 

 (BTW any _real_ scientists on the list, don\'t crucify me for this. I
know very well G-Waves are a subject of heated debate in the real world.)

He (or someone else) has changed his mind about that, then. The G:T errata

That is an excellent explanation! It\'s going into MTU straight away. I hadn\'t
considered that with the abdication of Cleon II, ZE isn\'t the Emperor\'s

Great discussions everybody.  I particularly like the distinction
between spoken language and written language, and the further
distinction of technical language (which goes towards education).  

While living in Cyprus, many friends spoke several of Greek, Turkish,
English, Armenian, French, Arabic.  All spoke English, many both Greek
and Turkish (the country was interspersed with both at that time rather
than divided).  But could they write them?  Doubtful.  English (mostly
yes as it was taught in the schools), and their native tongue (Greek or
Turk) but probably not any others.

I\'d expect in the 3I that mots everyone would be bi-lingual, probably
multi-lingual.  Everyone will have their native tongue.  That might be
Anglic, but would probably be some local language or derivative of
Anglic.  I\'d say that the "official" language (money language) of the 3I
is Anglic.  The "diplomatic" language of the 3I is Vilani.  In the
Terran Sphere, the diplomatic language might be a language of oriental
derivation.  Could be French, but I doubt it.  Probably something that
we don\'t recognize today.  Could be "Terran", in fact, probably would
be.  A close relative of Anglic.

Guess there should be a "IMTU" in there somewhere.... followed by "YMMV"
;-)

The money language is be Anglic throughout the 3I, and most sophonts you
run into would be able to "speak" it to some degree (at least around
starports).  Merchants would speak several of the major tongues,
depending on in which sectors they had operations.  Military would have
no special need to speak several, though they may have a home world
language.  Nobles would all have to learn Vilani, as well as Anglic. 
Scouts?  Well I think they would be the most well rounded linguists of
all.  First contact missions, lots of time in jump space, communications
roles, all would lead to study of languages.  I\'d expect that travellers
(crew etc.) would spend some of the time in jump learning languages.  

My characters do.

Ah, I see! No, you misunderstood me. If you don\'t need to put the fuel inside
the hull, you can make a jump-6 100 T ship with the Book 2 rules. So the way
I read the newsbrief, the Imperium was looking into building true jump-6
X-boats, externally the same as the other X-boats, but with drop tanks to
provide the 60% of fuel from the outside.

But it\'s a control system that IMO dosen\'t work. His subordinate nobles are
precisely the people who would have the means to set up alternate systems of
their own. And even if they don\'t, what are the odds that with 15 rival
systems, most powerful nobles will be able to buy what he wants from one of
them. Worse than that, the control system makes the problem of governing
the Imperium a lot worse. Again I\'d like to point out that we\'re told that
the Imperium is groaning under the strain of the communication lag. 

>I\'m sure Arballatra might have agreed, after the First Civil War.  Otherwise,

At the time the X-boat system was begun (and IIRC also when it was finished),
jump-4 was the best available.

I guess we\'ll just have to disagree here. The examples of subordinates doing
things that their superiors didn\'t know they were doing are legio.

Nor do I, or I would have trotted them out. I just don\'t see the Imperium as
being so controlling that they\'d do something that would seriously hamstring
itself for a gain that I consider dubious at best and a flawed plot device
at worst.

But if they are not, the concept of keeping an information advantage over the
powerful people in the Imperium is difficult to accept.

Why not? We\'re told that the Imperium is straining under the long
communication times between the core and the borders. This is supposed
to be a big problem. So why not relieve that strain. Especially since
a jump-6 backbone with jump-1 to jump-4 feeder lines wouldn\'t be all that
much more expensive than a pure jump-4 network.

Not to mention that the Imperium DO shell out the bucks for jump-6. It is
canonical that the Imperial Navy have jump-6 couriers. Why not use them,
at least for official business?

Keven R. Pittsinger writes:

Quite right. And that is a good reason why most of the X-boat network is
still jump-4. But it dosen\'t explain why, at the very least, the routes
between sector capitals haven\'t been updated. And there are places in the
net where one jump-6 link can replace two jump-3 links.

There\'s a better web page that someone has put up (that I can\'t find at
the moment). It calculates language importance by calculating a product
of the number of speakers of a language times their contribution to
their national GNP. I think it works something like this - take Canada\'s
GNP, divide by total population, multiply by the number of people that
speak English (be it their primary, secondary, tertiary, etc language).
Repeat for every country & language in the world. Don\'t ask me how
accurate the numbers were.

The numbers there boiled down to two major winners: English and
Japanese. First of all, the countries where English and Japanese are
spoken as the primary language are pretty much the richest countries in
the world, based on GNP (USA & Japan). Second of all, there a lots and
lots of people (nearly the entire population of the Earth) who speak
either English or Japanese as a second/third/whatever language. The
trend tends to be self-reinforcing, causing more and more people to pick
up one of these two languages. For example, there are so many languages
in India that many government transaction take place in English (good
ol\' English colonialism plays no small part in this either). Lots of
Asian people learn Japanese as a second language because there\'s a good
bet it will be spoken whereever they end up in the pacific rim.

I imagine that this wil shift as the Chinese become more affluent over
time - Mandarin is quickly becoming at least as important as Japanese in
Asian business circles (from my perspective as a white guy who lives in
Toronto :)

As for languages hanging on in odd places - sure, it happens. All my
in-laws speak German - they\'re from Kitchener/Waterloo, the largest
concentration of German speakers outside of Germany (apparently). K/W
has the largest German newspaper in North America, the biggest
Oktoberfest outside of Germany and my father-in-law sells a lot of VWs
(yes, he\'s a Volkswagen dealer) to people who come in speaking German.
While this is an interesting cultural phenomenon, it doesn\'t mean much
from a commercial/tourist/visitor/government standpoint. No matter how
many German speakers there are in K/W, you\'ll still only be able to get
government service in English and French.

[Though wouldn\'t it be sweet to see the federal governmment only offer
service in English & German in Quebec? bwa ha ha ha]

Anyway, to sum up a long, rambling message - Westerners have skewed
views of what languages are spoken by the most amount of people. There
will be planets, nay, dozens of planets in the Solomani Rim where each
and every inhabitant will be "brown" (for lack of a better term) and the
main language will be Hindi, Punjabi, or something like that. There
_may_ be one planet of blond, blue-eyed German speakers. [Special bonus
conclusion: guess which one is full of Aryans?]

Fair enough. That explains the X-boats. IMTU it is the X-boat manufacturers\'
lobby that excerts the pressure, but it could be the Imperium itself for all
I care. What I can\'t understand is that if an alternative  --  like the navy
couriers  --  exists, why don\'t the Imperial bureaucracy use that for official
messages?

A properly designed jump-6 network would propably be cheaper than the
present network. It certainly would be a lot more efficient.

Oh, man.  Time to see how muh cash I can spare.
Even though IG has screwed a lot of people, several of the books
particularly Pocket Empires, Imperial Squadrons, Alien Archive,
Psionic Institutes and Milieu 0 are good products.

And after hearing the horror stories from when they closed down
GDW, I just couldn\'t bear it if IG disposed of the material.

I don\'t know much about the languages of the Asian subcontinent,
but I wonder, given the length of some words and the nature of
the syllables (there is a moe accurate word for that which escapes
me at the moment - moneme?), how similar would some of these
languages be to Vilani?  IMO, they seem closer than Romance and
other Western languages, such as German and English.

Well, answering "both" wouldn\'t be wrong.  But if you\'re speaking
about the original Aryans, I don\'t think anyone on this list will miss
that question, i.e., Aryans are from the Asian subcontinent.

But does this reflect the languages that would be used on colony worlds in
a hundred/3 thousand years time?  It would in the short term, of course. 
If a jump drive were invented tomorrow, it\'s a safe bet that the first
"Terran" colonies would be established by the "best and brightest" (most
loyal and brainwashed) citizens of the USA.  This would only be broken down
by time.

Actually, my "problem" with putting Indonesia/Indonesian squarely into the
future history comes partly from this.  It\'s a case of attaching my country
(Australia) to a suitable rising trade partner who won\'t overshadow the
identity with which most of my players would identify.  I\'ve written about
PNG, which is a country where English is the language in which government
business is carried out, but have fudged the issue, IMTU, by attaching it
to Australia.  If any Papua New Guineans are on the list, I hereby,
publicly and officially apologise.

Actually, if I was working in a perfect world, I would attach Australia to
Japan (it\'s present day largest trade partner), or perhaps to China (a
rising power).  The main reason why I don\'t is that I don\'t speak either
language, and would foul up anything I tried to name.  As a result, I\'ve
built an Australian  colonial empire, which is objectionable on several
points, but at least is phrased in terms of the most progressive and
democratic elements of the countries of South-East Asia voluntarily allying
to Australia.

It\'s late.
About the French and German thing:

OK:  What are the criteria for language survival?
Does the use of a language by a high population world count?

It\'s possible that the original "native" languages of the Hi-Pop worlds
could have
died out, but, if such a world existed, isn\'t it likely that their language
is still around somewhere?

My guess leans towards these languages surviving.

The original Solomani Rim supplement gives lots of world names.  Some of
these are indicators of who settled them, originally.  Basically, if it can
be demonstrated that a particular world name in the Sollie Rim is derived
from a particular language, and no others, then it was probably settled by
people who spoke that language.  If it is a high pop world, the original
language still survives...

This is not a fool-proof algorithm, but it will give us a clue. 

Umm.  This doesn\'t quite make sense, but it\'s about 3am, so I demand to be
excused!

There is some kind of rational point in here.

The 2TFU container is approximately equal to a 4 displacement ton container in Traveller according to conversion calculations I just made:  (40ft)(1ft/12in)(39in/1m)(1.5m/CT deck plan square)(2 CT d.p.s./disp.ton)=4.1 rounded to 4.   The length, height, and width of a 2TFU container are not metric, and are not designed with CT displacement tonnage in mind, but the conversion is close enough that comparing RealWorld(tm) container traffic to Traveller container traffic is not especially stretching to my "suspension of disbelief" capabilities.

Does MM know about this. Last i heard they were forbidden to sell
any more product because of the license problems.

One question though, are some of the latter books (after TLWH) worth buying?
I never saw them here in Germany, so maybe this is the last chance to get
any stock on the 
European mainland...

	You\'ll note above that it says this is my view of languages, and
thus i\'m not trying to pass this off as canonical.  Similarly, what the
game books say isn\'t really going to change my mind about my views;
no culture, except perhaps the Dryone, should have only one language.
The Vilani adapted that way, conciously, in my view;  they didn\'t start
off with only one language.

Anyways, thank you for the names of the Vargr languages.  That will
help me give names to afew of the many many Vargr \'tounges\' in existance
in MTU.  ::smiles::

Worlds are often named by whomever discovered or first surveyed them,
which may happen long before anyone colonizes them - and the colonists
may not change the name. Many colonists do change the name
(i.e., Garda-Vilis (1118 Vilis/Spinward Marches) was once Tanoose),
but IMO just as many would leave all but the most annoying names alone.

In the Terran sphere, many worlds will have been named by the UN space
administration, the Terran navy, or any one of the Terran government 
bureaus that handled colonization projects.  Aristotle 
(1740 Gemini/Solomani Rim) wasn\'t necessarily settled by greeks,
philosophers, or academicians - that was the name on the star charts
when the colonization project began, that\'s the name on all the
colonization project paperwork and shipping manifests, that\'s what
the colonists called it for months (years?) before they even saw the
place, that\'s the name that stuck.

"P. 151. 

In the Turret and Bay Tables, change the last two headings to ``Cost
(MCr)\'\' and ``Internal Spaces\'\'. A Bay has 50 Internal Spaces. " (from the
GURPS Traveller Errata)

Well, I guess that settles that, then :) This is good actually, although it
will require me to change a couple of designs :)

  Subject: Re: From the Friday night game

  BTW, you can\'t really get a "3-axis spin" on a dead ship. You\'ll get a
  single axis, which may shift as cargo shifts, and possibly some
  precession (ie the axis will wander a bit, possibly periodically).

Common misconception.

Yes you can.
Any object with three different moments of inertia will do really
funky things when rotating around the middle moment of inertia.

Take a book rubber-banded closed, or a videotape, toss it in the air
spinning about its middle moment of inertia.  If the spine begins on
the left side, it\'ll sometimes flip to the other (depends on how high
you toss the object and how rapidly it rotates).

In zero-G, it will continue flipping from side to side as it spins.
Guaranteed to transfer some rotational energy into loose objects, but
as long as it is rotating about that middle axis it will keep being
annoying.

	- Robert Ringrose
	  ringrose@ascent.com

More specific instructions:

Take a book with three different dimensions.  Hold the book flat, like
it would be if it were face up on a table, with the spine in your left
hand and the other side in your right hand.  Toss it in the air,
spinning so that the top of the page comes toward you.  Catch it
again.  Look at where the book\'s spine is.

If there were only one axis, or precession, you would expect the spine
to come down in your left hand.  If you\'re throwing it high enough
(and it doesn\'t have to be very high) and rotating it fast enough
(doesn\'t have to be very fast) as it spins top-to-bottom it will
occasionally flip left-to-right.

Realistically?  Can\'t be done.  There are significantly different object shapes
which generate identical patterns -- for a simple example, solid and hollow
spheres have identical gravitational fields (and in turn identical to a
point-like object), regardless of size, as long as you aren\'t actually inside
of the object.

In MegaTraveller supplement source material explains that normal citizens and
smaller corporations are limited to the X-boat system.  The Imperium and many
megacorps use jump-6 couriers to carry their information thus giving a
substantial advantage to them, ie Norris using the delay to declare himself
Archduke before the X-boat network spreads the news of the death of the death
of the Emperor generally.  The TNS also shows this on Terra where the military
starts taking defensive measures before the news reaches the Confederation. 
The American government did this for some time with the GPS system and allowed
full accuracy to civilian use only after technology allowed more accurate use

In MegaTraveller supplement source material explains that normal citizens
and smaller corporations are limited to the X-boat system.&nbsp; The
Imperium and many megacorps use jump-6 couriers to carry their
information thus giving a substantial advantage to them, ie Norris using
the delay to declare himself Archduke before the X-boat network spreads
the news of the death of the death of the Emperor generally.&nbsp; The
TNS also shows this on Terra where the military starts taking defensive
measures before the news reaches the Confederation.&nbsp; The American
government did this for some time with the GPS system and allowed full
accuracy to civilian use only after technology allowed more accurate use
by comparing the signals from a number of GPS satellites.<br>

The problem is that typically this capability is limited to _big_ ships (more
accurately, it\'s limited to interstellar corporations) -- in order to
practically do this \'load and go immediately\' you need to have cargo factors
already insystem, who prepare cargo for you before you arrive, and know with a
high degree of certainty _when_ you\'ll arrive.  In addition, the cost per ton
of transported material is flat-out lower for larger ships.

Nah, it\'s more like two hours due to intercept issues (you need to be there at
the right time).

That level of streamlining is free (i.e. true by default).  However, such a
ship will disintegrate if it attempts to do gas-giant skimming (traveller rules
notwithstanding, that\'s harder than atmospheric entry) unless it has enough
manuever capability to handle the surface gravity of a gas giant (usually 2-3).

That manuever drive does.  3 sandcasters need 1 crew.  60 spaces of maneuver
drive (for the armor replaced by the sandcaster) need one crew.

Hm.  Note that in that case the ship _cannot_ enter atmosphere.  If you allow
ships under a G, this gives a serious edge to unstreamlined ships.

Mostly they\'ll buy something else, because fighting is in fact a low priority
for most merchants, and damn few pirates are going to go after something in the
multi-kiloton range anyway, 20 turrets probably outguns any likely pirates.

Excuse me but doesn\'t 4 laser turrets plus 4 plasma turrets plus 4 missile
turrets plus 4 sandcaster turrets equal 16, not 12?

If importance is being based on ecomonic factors I\'d say that Cantonese
would be the Chinese language that becomes common, not Mandarin. This is
based on a comment by a Chinese friend that while Mandarin might be the
official language commercial operations tend to be conducted in Cantonese,
and if our schools were to offer \'useful\' languages such as Japanese rather
than \'useless\' classical or traditional languages such as French and Latin
they should ignore what the Chinese government says and teach Cantonese.

thoughts on the subject.  Richard seems to be running a Traveller campaign set

German civilization in space), so therefore I can see why he takes his
position.  However, I ran a Trav adventure that had a very American-oriented
slant...I don\'t believe that means that the dominant language of the galaxy is
American English.

	It seems to me that the most likely "Common" language would be that of the
dominant space- and star-faring cultures...if you extrapolate this from today
(almost 2000), then I would have to say the major language would be English in
some form (The US is the one building the space station...the Russians are
contributing a small share;  they still can\'t deliver there modules on time)
I am not aware of any major European assistance to the construction of the
station (I realize I could be wrong here)  NASA is the one with a planned
mission to Mars...they are also the ones w/ a planned Lunar mission/colony,
now that water is considered extremely likely to be present there.  Let\'s face
it:  The United States is still the only nation to have walked on the
moon...and no other country has the means or will to do it.  IMO, most if not
all future missions will be done by the US...perhaps as joint ventures with
other countries, but still using NASA\'s know-how and technology.

They might have a problem getting there.  There is a rule (if
I understand them correctly) against anything that requires a
man to work on the Sabath  (this is one reason they don\'t go
in for municipal electricity).  The could only travel to
their colony if ships didn\'t require any tending during jump.

OK. My long-dormant memories of High Guard are waking up.

It\'s Armour Factor zero, so why not make it an open frame design ? This
will save a little money, and any volume you might have committed to launch
tubes.

Ooops, there are no launch tubes. How long does the wing of 30 fighters
take to get out of the County class anyway ?

Does it have a Battlecruiser equivalent, with jump-2 and some bay weaponary ?

Well, it\'s interesting - Hong Kong, the undisputed commercial and
economic hub of China (as of last year) is primarily Cantonese speaking,
while the Chinese government\'s official language is Mandarin. While I
agree that Cantonese is probably more relevant right now, as it\'s the
language of Chinese people involved in commerce, it\'s not necessarily
the language of people involved in commerce in China. :) In a few years
the opening Chinese market will make Hong Kong look like what it really
it - a tiny dot on the map. At the risk of being trite, might makes
right and when it comes to might, the Chinese government has it in
spades. Mandarin will prevail, IMO. (That is, taking into account that
there are still half a dozen different dialects of Chinese and there
have been for a few thousand years, Mandarin will remain the "official"
Chinese. Not to mention that the ROC speaks Mandarin, making it the
official language of both, er, either, er, any Chinese government)

As for French and Latin being useless - well, French is hardly usless in
Canada. Unless you mean "The French". (kidding!) As for Latin, to quote
my English-as-a-Second-Langauge teaching wife, "You can\'t teach English
until you understand Latin". For pidgin languages like English it really
helps to have a good understanding of the base languages(s). Which is
why you have High Vilani and Low/Standard/whatever Vilani.

ObTrav: How damn big would the ancient/dead language depatment of an
Imperial university be? Way bigger than Latin and Greek I\'ll bet.

Are we told that the Imperium recognizes this strain?  (The Romans
didn\'t recognize many of the strains on their Empire).  Would a
33% increase in time be enough to make a significant difference
in this strain (compared to the costs involved)?  Is the strain
related to X-boat speeds at all?  (What method do governmental
directives, orders, etc. get sent?)

Because they have solved the problem for themselves but don\'t want
to spend the money that it would take to make them generally
available for all messages?

Well, Rob, I\'d wanted to avoid this, but first thing you gotta do is
find the real copy of this book, called the Necronomicron... ;-)

Of course, the _other_ way to do it is to invent reactionless thrusters,
get a lifeboat, stick it waaaay out in the Oort cloud, point the thing
at Redmond and turn the thrusters on...

Doug, mate.

We know Imperium *spit* Games are prepared to commit wire fraud.

We know they are prepared to engage in breach of contract as their normal
mode of business.

Given this, I think Marc\'s notice could only be enforced by a couple of
blokes going to the IG warehouse with a shotgun.

The problem is people retailing information. If you, as Sector
Vice-President of Operations for SuSAG, have access to a small, important
bit of information (say, the fact that General Shipyards just lost a big
navy contract), then it starts to get very tempting to retail it to people
who the Powers That Be have forgotten to tell it to.

Once you mesh in planetary governments, subsector nobility, naval types and
so on, then it gets a lot harder to keep secrets secret.

By \'load up and go\' I mean the Arguvid Dancer, a 200 dton jump-2 freighter,
arrives on planet. It will take four hours to refuel and so on, once it
makes planetfall.

There is a time-sensitive cargo that is waiting, and the next scheduled
Decafreighter is leaving in 20 hours.

If the Arguvid Dancer is willing to load and go, then it may make sense to
get that single carton of spare parts onto the Arguvid Dancer, so it can
get the MCr 2-per-day factory producing again (I am reminded of the story
from the 6 Day War, when some of the Egyptian Air Staff went to Moscow just
before hostilities ... the Soviets declined to give them some critical
spare parts, which they were planning to take back in their hand luggage).
Sure, you could save about KCr 450 sending it on the Decafreighter, but on
average that would put the factory out of commission for another 12 hours,
costing you a megacredit.

Gas giant skimming is an issue only for exploratory traders, and captains
who do not understand that time is money.
 
It makes even less sense under G:T, now they have used the sane and
reasonable number of Cr 350 a dton for LHyd.

I can see absolutely no reason to disallow ships under a gee. Can someone

 I read the newsbrief, the Imperium was looking into building true jump-6

 provide the 60% of fuel from the outside. >>

HG also allows you to do this. I did a quick little J6 X boat, using one 15
ton drop tank. The boat is Jump 4 without the tank, Jump 5 with the tank, and
Jump 6 (once) with the  tank dropped. It was only 105-107 MC, and 55 of this
was for the computer model 6. I saved 5 MC going to a dispersed hull, but this
can be changed easy. This is a ship that is only 50% more expensive than a
standard boat, and it can fit in the tender (with no tanks). This boat also
has a power plant so she has 4 weeks power instead of 10 days. I still used
the other X boat parameters (no manuever drive, 2 single staterooms, 1 ton of
cargo). The Jump 6 network is quite doable canonically; the puzzle is why not?
My personal spin is that Marc, Loren and Frank, et al. didn\'t think of Jump 6
X boats until the gearheads started screwing around with HG (remember there
were no drop tank rules in CT book 2). By then, Supplement 3 and 5FFW were
already published. Ce Le Guerre...

PS: can FF+S and FF+S2 duplicate this X boat design (I don\'t have them)?

Yup.  The Furies (Eumenidies) are for the "real bad" crimes

Hmmm... It must have been a difficult trip from Europe to 
the American Colonies in the 1730s-1770s. Actually, the 
rules are more of an effort to keep their lives simple and 
maintain a separation from the outside world. If an 
idea or invention does not help to keep there lives 
as simple as possible it is rejected.  As the technology 
on Earth advances they may see Jump Technology 
as a means to a simpler life. There are currently 
about 134K adult Amish.  Some Amish communities
are quite wealthy, and could perhaps afford the passage 
fees involved in a colony effort better than most
non-government organizations.

After my comments from the other day my S.O. began
working on a Traveller world settled by Amish colonists.  
Eventually she\'ll post details on our Traveller page.

Liquidation announced.
This is probably their attempt to satisfy creditors.

But, since there is no discount from them, yet every LGS I see
IG stuff in has it marked down 30-50%, I think I\'m going to stay
away.

If they had a clue, they\'d discount the stock and announce
how much they have on hand.

"Going Fast" my eye.

What do you want to be that there are virtualy no liquidation
sales and instead of discounting the stock, they chuck it all?
Really a shame for the half-dozen or so really good supplements.

BTW, who is IG\'s main creditor? Sweet Pea?  Anyone know
if Sweet Pea is going to get and/or retain the copyrights in the
already published and paid for stuff?  (Unpaid for stuff probably
had no transfer of copyright in the firstplace).  I could live with
the loss of the stock if I knew that someone Trav-friendly and
generous had the copyrights so that the stuff could be preserved
for future revision/re-release.

I seem to recall that when Marc Miller yanked IG\'s license, he
explicitly prohibited them from selling anything that wasn\'t
already in the distribution channel (or at least that\'s how I
understood Marc\'s comments from that time).  This stuff isn\'t and
wasn\'t in the distribution channel.  I\'d not touch it with a
9.144m pole, given IG\'s poor record of handling orders - and
given that Marc\'s lawyers may stomp HARD on this at any moment,
unless there\'s explicit permission.

High Guard Abstract Resolution
(apologies to Mercenary for theft of concept)
By Donald McKinney


The abstract mission resolution system is valuable in resolving 
starship or squadron missions involving large numbers of starships
on one or both sides and in which PCs are not primary participants.

The abstract system is conducted in two parts: preparation and 
resolution.

Preparation
	Preparation consists of determining the most important
characteristics of the two opposing forces.  These characteristics
consist of mission, TL, size and efficiency.
	1.	Mission
		Roll once on the mission table below to determine 
		what mission the players\' unit is on:

		1	Battle
		2	Strike
		3	Seige
		4-6	Patrol

		Roll again to determine the mission of the
		opposing unit.	

	2.	TL

		Imperial Regular Units:	TL 15.
		Zhodani Regular Units: TL 14.
		Solomani Regular Units: TL 14.

		Imperial Colonial Units: Roll a die:
			1	TL 12
			2-3	TL 13
			4-5	TL 14
			6	TL 15

		Vargr Units:  Roll a die:
			1	TL 11
			2-3	TL 12
			4-5	TL 13
			6	TL 14

	3.	Size
		Size is calculated by determining the firepower strength
		available.  For turrets, this equals their USP factor
		times the number of batteries bearing.  Bays each add
		their USP factor times batteries bearing, and then spinal
		mounts add their USP factor (10 - 27) * 100.

		So, the Unicorn CE on HG p. 50 has a firepower strength
		of 10.  The Kinunir on HG p. 52 has a FS of 18.

		The Tigress on p. 38 of Sup #9, Fighting Ships, would
		have an FS of 3362, plus 300 heavy fighters, each (from
		p. 26 of Sup #9) having an FS of 7.

		For random opposition, roll one die and consult the unit
		size table:

		1	small ship with no spinal mount/ftr squadron (10)
		2	large ship with no spinal mount/ftr squadrons (25)
		3	Auxilaries (transports/tankers) with escorts (50)
		4	Cruiser or escorts (200)
		5	Battleship/battlerider and escorts (800)
		6	Cruron or equivalent (3200)
		7	Batron or equivalent (24000)
		8 	Numbered Fleet (120000)	
		9	Named Fleet (200000)

		Apply the following cumulative DMs:
		Regular unit, +1
		Strike mission, +1
		Battle mission, +2
		
		The result on the unit size table will indicate the unit
		employed by each force. The number in parenthesis
		following the unit type is the number of combat effectives
		in the unit. This number is used for mission resolution.

		After determining size, the referee should record each
		unit\'s preservation level. The preservation level is 40%
		of unit strength.  For example, a Batron has a combat 
		effectiveness of 452; it will withdraw from action or 
		surrender after sustaining 181 losses.

	4.	Efficiency
		To determine a unit\'s efficiency, roll one die and add
		three for elite units (psionics), add two for regular 
		units and add one for all other experienced units.

Resolution
	Mission resolution is conducted in a series of combats, each
between part or all of the two opposing forces. Each such action will 
result in casualties to one or both forces. When one force suffers 
casualties equal to or exceeding its preservation level, it surrenders
or withdraws, allowing the other side to complete its mission. Each 
combat is resolved in four steps.
	1.	Element engaged
		Determine the element engaged in the combat from each
		force by rolling a six sided die and applying the
		following DMs: Battle mission, +2, not regular units,
		-2.  The result will read out as either "full",
		indicating that the entire force is engaged, or "down N",
		with "N\' being the number of levels lower than the size
		of the force the committed element represents.

		1-2	down 3
		3-4	down 2
		5-6	down 1
		7+	full

		Thus, a "cruiser or escorts" which receives a "down 2"
		result commits a single large, non-spinal ship.

	2.	Encounter type
		Roll a die to determine the encounter type:

		-3	Enemy Surprised
		-2 to 1	Own Attacking
		2-5	Skirmish
		6-9	Enemy Attacking
		10+	Own Surprised

		Apply the following DMs:
		if own committed element smaller, +1
		if enemy committed element smaller, -1
		if enemy on strike mission, +1
		if own on battle mission, -2
		if enemy on battle mission, +2

		The type of encounter will have a great effect on
		the resolution of combat.
	3.	Combat Resolution
		Combat Resolution consists of rolling once on the fire
		results table to determine casualties.  In a skirmish
		or attack encounter, both sides roll once to inflict 
		casualties on the opposing force. In a surprise
		encounter the surprised side ill not fire.

		-2	no casualties
		-1 to 0	1%
		1-2	5%
		3-4	10%
		5-6	20%
		7	30%
		8	40%
		9+	50%

		A die is rolled once to determine casualties, subject
		to DMs:

		Relative size difference from unit size table,
		+to larger force, -to smaller force
		unit attacking, -2
		TL difference, +/-

		Casualties read out as percentage losses by the engaged
		element. Fractional losses of 0.5 or more round up.
		For example, the Kinunir (FS 18) receives 10% casualties,
		amounting to 1.8 FS, rounded to 2.  A turret was probably
		damaged.
	4.	Personal Casualties
		If the force a PC is in suffers 5% or greater casualties
		in combat, there is a chance the PC will be wounded,
		or worse. The personal casualty table gives the number
		on two dice which must be rolled to avoid a wound.
		If the number immediately below the specified number
		is rolled, the PC is seriously wounded and out of action.
		If any number below that is rolled, the PC has been
		wounded.

		5%	3+
		10%	4+
		20%	5+
		30%	6+
		40%	7+
		50%	8+

Using these concepts, it becomes easy to play out the events of the
FFW as layed out in the Spinward Marches Campaign book.  How that would
compare to FFW the boardgame, I don\'t know, as I don\'t own that particular
collectible.

A comparison of the abstract resolution in Mercenary to Invasion Terra
might also produce some interesting corrections to the system.

As this is derived from the abstract resolution system in Mercenary (book 4),
it should be possible to produce the "one true abstract resolution system"
that would work for both land and space warfare in Traveller.

This is a common misconception. I live in Pennsylvania and have met quite a
few Amish people, as well as mennonites.

I moved here a couple years ago from California, and was quite curious about
them and their culture, and I held a lot of the common misconceptions about
them. So being a west coaster, I just walked up to a woman about my age, who
had her children with her, and politely asked about their beliefs. She was
very happy to share them with me, as has everyone since her been. I have
spoken to numerous people about their culture and life style, and many of
them are from different groups.

Their basic ideas of keeping life simple do not keep them from taking the
train on occasion to a special occasion (like 4th of July in Washington DC),
or even taking the train to go to a new settlement. Every Sunday in many
amish communities after church they fire up the bench tractor to move the
benches from the persons home who had services held, to store elsewhere
until the next meeting. If you don\'t believe me, come on over and I will
take you to see.

 They believe so strongly in keeping the "outside world" out of their life,
that it is very believable to have them want to leave our planet with so
many "worldly temptaions". It is their strong beliefs in meidug (avoiding
the outside world). The other most striking thing about them is their
ability to turn the other cheek, no matter the cost. They do all these
things to be closer to God. Because they believe through simplicity and
focus on the scripture they can have a better relationship with God.

They do not avoid things out of stupidity or desire to live a hundred years
ago, or even blind faith in their elders (there are converts). They dress
and do as they do so that they can have time for what they think is
important, and live the way they spiritually believe gives them a better
relationship with God. It may seem like some hard strict life of nothing but
rules and work, but when you talk to the people you realize that is not what
it is at all, and they seem to be happy in their lives.

From the Amish I have met, it is very believable that many communities would
consider moving to a new planet strongly, to achieve that simpler life, on
an unpolluted world (they cherish nature as strongly as any people I have
ever met, including my tree hugging friends back home in California).  I
could see them paying to take the ship if promised a life without the
temptations of the outside world, as long as they were not required to fly
the ship, for a chance at the life every Good Amish man woman or child
dreams of finding, a life of the basics, no complications.

Oh, look - it\'s errata; the "-3 Enemy Surprised" should be "-3 Own Surprised",
and the "10+ Own Surprised" should be "10+ Enemy Surprised".

I couldn\'t even copy the table without putting an error in.

Unfortunately, the shipping factor for the cargo handler has a contract with
the Decafreighter corporation, and has guarantees that there _will_ be an
outgoing transit at a particular time; thus, by the time the Arguvid Dancer is
insystem, the transit has already been contracted, and has been for the past
couple of days (in fact, most likely Decafreighter, Inc, gives discounts on
transit costs if you make your shipping arrangements in advance).

For situations where bulk transit isn\'t sufficient, if it isn\'t going to minor
worlds (which I agree is free trader bait) this will most likely involve
contracted dedicated trade ships, which again doesn\'t particularly resemble the
standard free trader theory of operation.

I like minimal capabilities for that to handle misjumps, but agree that it

Heh.  Sure.  3.5 tons, 1 space, 5,000 tons CG lift, 0.6 MCr at TL 10, 0.5 MCr
at TL 12.  Adding CG to ships is incredibly efficient.

You know, the Imperium could simply pull in its borders rather than pour cash on

I have, but you won\'t like it (portions of the description quoted from
GURPS Vehicles, 2d Ed., p. 41, (c) 1996 by SJ Games):

"Contragravity Module (TL 10, 0.5 dtons, 2.1 stons, MCr 0.33)

Provides 3,000 stons of contra-gravity lift; in order to fly, the lift
should exceed the vehicle\'s expected final weight (in all anticipated
gravities).  Note that contra-gravity does not propel the vehicle, it only
lifts it."

Yes, I *do* mean stons (short tons, 2,000lbs each), not pounds: 
contra-gravity is extremely cheap in VE2.

    'body' => 'I think I see the problem with Jump 6 X-boat routes.
If you look at CT designs (book 2 or 5) then the cost of giving jump 6 to
a small (100std) ship is high because of the Model 6 computer (55MCr) and
the 20std bridge (boosting the size to 135std).

So yes, the ships do end up costing 155MCr or more.

But with T4 and FFS2, things are very different. The jump 6 100std courier
is easily possible at 40MCr.

I don\'t know FFS1 (TNE) or MT that well, but I would assume that FFS1
would be similar in price and MT someway between the two.

So what follows is a design for a X-boat built to FFS2.

Based upon my thoughts about a jump-6 core network with lower jump feeder
networks, the following design is for a TL12 jump-2 ship with enough fuel
for jump-6 (the HEPlaR fuel tank can extend this to jump-7 and still have
5-Ghour left).

Despite the provision of manoeuvre at up to 2-G, a crew of 2 (required by
the HEPlaR drive although in traditional X-boat mode with pickup by
tender, one should suffice) and an air/raft (or lifeboat) bay, there is
plenty of spare space in the drive bay.

The reason for the space is that the TL12 jump drive and power plant can
be replaced with a TL13 jump-4 + 108MW fusion plant or a TL15 jump-6 +
158MW fusion plant. The rest of the ship reamins at TL12.

At TL12 the cost is 25MCr, rising to 34MCr for jump-4 and 40MCr for jump-6.
Discounts for tech level and mass production have not been included.

The three computers are model 6 (although this does not appear to be
necessary for the jump) since there will be a large amount of electronic
data to store. To transfer this data there is a radio and six laser comms.

Also, the 4std for the vehicle could include small, valuable, parcels in
the cargo space of the carried vehicle.

The X-boat is streamlined and has 1G of contra grav if manoeuvring around
planets is required.

With wider availability of TL15 manufacture, replacing the computers and
G-Comp with TL15 would save 4MCr and 3MW. A purely TL15 design could have
fuel for jump-8 and 5-G HePlaR but there seems little point.

Slow communications means big headaches in trying to correlate
differing reports coming at different times by different routes.
Delayed collation of shipping reports over as little as a
subsector will take weeks just to collect and longer to verify.
Offenses have to be fairly recent and notorious to get much
attention from those who have to do the arresting and detaining.

Average temperature of earth without an atmosphere would be about

He did (the post was dated 17th July BTW). I can see 3 basic possibilities:

1 - Marc and IG have come to some arrangement allowing IG to sell
2 - IG has got legal advice that its allowed to sell despite Marc
3 - IG is acting illegally

I really hope its 1, but given IG\'s past actions I strongly suspect it\'s 3. 
Whatever the case may be, I won\'t touch IG without some further information 
and even then (given their track record with orders) I probably still wouldn\'t.

        "The Traveller Book", pp 61, "Weaponry"
        Missile Racks .....  "Indivudual missiles weigh about 50kg and cost
Cr5000 each"
        Sandcasters   .....  "...replacement canisters of this special sand
weigh about 50kg and cost Cr400".

        So, you should really get 20 to a ton.  However, I find, given what
I know about RealWorld(tm) Harpoons, Styx and similar systems, this is too
small a size of weapon.  AS has been discussed to death on this list, direct
impact-kill weapons are either improbable or totally devastating, with very
little happy medium.  So, I reality adjuset the missile sizes up 100% for MTU.
        Incidentally, "Special Supplement 3: Missiles in Traveller"
(appeared in JTAS #21 as a pullout) comments that you can build missiles as
big as you like, but weapons bigger than 50kg will not fit in standard
racks.  They can only be fired from bays under the HG system.  SS3 allows
you to build custom designed missiles of various sizes that produce all
kinds of interesting effects;  for example, a nuclear warhead optimized for
radiation effects instead of the fireball.  They also cover thermonuclear
weapons (eeeeeeek!) and high-speed impact effects of missiles.
        Obviously, for MTU, that 50kg rack limit is 100kg;  however, I
haven\'t done any real missile design with the system.  I should, and find
out what the implications of that 100kg missile are.  I note that "a typical
missile is a 5G5 limited burn, radio sensing, proximity detonating,
high-explosive warhead (all at default TL) costing Cr16,200 and massing 50kg."
        They also comment that the sophisticated guidance systems in the
sensor tips would be able to allow intercepts by discretionary burn missiles
on thier targets within several hundred meters.  Which is somewhat different
than we had been hashing about on the list.

        2097 - County-Class Strike Carrier   Type CS
        TL 11.  1550 tons. 
        Using a 1550-ton conical hull, the County-Class Strike Carrier is
the newest tool for the projection of UN Naval power into a star system.
        It is performance-rated at jump-1, 2-G acceleration and 46.5EP
        Fuel tankage for 356.5 tons supports the power plant and 2 jump-1.
The ship is fitted with fuel scoops and a purification plant.
        Adjacent to the bridge is a computer Model/5fib computer and a
redundant Model/2fib.
        There are 61 staterooms, no standard low berths and no emergency low
berths and.
        The ship has 15 turrets. There are 15 beam lasers mounted in 5
turrets organized in 1 battery.  There are 8 plasma guns mounted in 4
turrets organized in 2 batteries.  There are 12 missile racks mounted in 4
turrets organized into 2 batteries.  For defense it has 6 sand-casters
mounted in 2 turrets organized into 2 batteries and an agility of 1.  There
is a 45-ton magazine and are 20% of missiles normally carried are nuclear
weapons.
        There are 30 ship\'s vehicles.  The ship carries three squadrons of
Typhoon-class "Standard-III" multi-role fighters.  Two squadrons of Typhoons
are armed with single pulse lasers, while the third is armed with triple
missile racks.
        Cargo capacity is 0 tons.
        The hull is fully streamlined.
        There is 0 tons of waste space.
        The County-Class Strike Carrier requires a crew of 91.  10 Command
section, 2 Engineers, 7 Gunners and 72 Flight section are required.
        The fighter crews operates the fighter compliment.
        The ship costs MCr778.36, including architects fees, less class
discounts and takes 48 months to build.  The first was built in 2097, with a
production run of 24 of these ships scheduled between 2097 and 2105.  The

        Trying to keep the size down, so it needs to be streamlined to allow
planetary landing.  Can\'t land an open structure.

        ..."Duh, gee. knuckles....  about 7 and a half hours..."
        Thanks, I haven\'t done a carrier design in about 5 years...  BIG
oversight.  I\'ll post the corrected version... the only way to make a launch
tube work with a ten-ton fighter and keep the range I want is to go to a
1550 dton hull.  Which alters the price surprisingly little.  However, it
allows me to correct another mistake, which was turret numbers.  I\'ve
re-arranged the turret allocations a bit, too....  PGST technology is still
too young at TL 11 to make it easy to get mean with them;  so I\'ve shifted
the emphasis for primary weapons onto the beam lasers.

>Does it have a Battlecruiser equivalent, with jump-2 and some bay weaponary ?

        It really should...  It\'d get the snot kicked out of it without
escorts, even if I use the optional fighter rules.  The problem is that in a
~1000 dton hull, you get one bay and no turrets....  which means no engaging
of multiple targets, all eggs in one basket.  Of course, whatever your one
bay fires at is dead-dead-dead, given that 90% of everything else is smaller
than 900 tons.
        Hmmm...  so, I guess I\'ll go design 1dKton battlecruiser...  I
really didn\'t need to be in bed before midnight tonight anyway...

A credible job. Without playtesting, I have no idea how \'reasonable\' it is
in terms of modelling FFW and/or HG combat, but it looks possible.

My complaint would be the same one that I have about the abstract system
in Mercenary: too dull. 

It\'s basically see if you fight, see if you die.  What I\'d rather see is a
system that gave a sense of the flow of battle. Whether this could be done
with cards, or with a flowchart, or what, I don\'t know, but I\'d like
something that provides some \'colour\' as well as raw stats.

(This is personal preference, mind you, and possibly not at all what _you_
want out of the syste,)

My explanation is that the teleporter _swaps_ with the contents of the
destination. Thus, if you teleport into solid rock, a solid rock
\'sculpture\' appears where you were, and you suffocate to death (unless, of
course, the rock was under pressure, in which case you might be crushed).

This neatly solves the air problem, without greatly changing teleporters\'
abilities.

Try 500 kg/kL, which is half that of water and the same as used by CSC.
The original Striker used 1 tonne per cubic metre, or the density of
water, which sounds to me more reasonable when designing a ship.

I have no idea what this works out to in tons per cubic yard, but as so
many of you pointed out, there are many conversion utilities available so
no one should have problems... :-)

Show your dedication to the greater good and lose the war!

Seriously, petition the Emperor _every_ turn for a budget increase. Sure,
this rapidly lowers your glory, but it will (on average) raise your
budget. Invest the money in new colonies and smaller vessels - the kind
that don\'t get recalled during peaces.  Go in for material damage: after
all, all your loses are eventually replaced for free, while the Terrans
have to pay for their replacements.

If you are careful, you can balance your glory loses (because of
petitions) with glory gains (from destroying his/her colonies) until the
victory conditions condense too much.

The French has a lot of colonies, many of which still use French as a
second language. To my Indochinese friends, English is their third
language (after French, which they learned in school). Large parts of
Africa use French as well.

According to my Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language, French looks more
widespread than German.

Thanks for the info... I don\'t have SS3. I quess that that is the most
workable solution for CT (ten or twenty missiles per ton of magazine; take
your pick...). The problem is that the missile data is talking weight
(kilograms), and the magazine size is talking volume (displacement tons). I
have the seeker games SDB deckplans and the missile magazines show two
missiles taking up two 1.5m squares on the plans. I would interpret this
(asuming the artist got the dimensions right, and this is a big if...) that
TWO (2) missiles take up a displacement ton. This is because the plans don\'t
show the "second" row of missiles (remember that the plans asume a 3 meter
high deck, so these two "deck squares are really four cubes in two rows of
two. Thus there is four missiles in two rows of two taking up the space of the
four cubes. Thus one missile per half ton displacement (two squares to the ton
displacement). I now see why Striker (and then FFS, FFS2, etc.) went with
having to compute both weight and volume in their design sequences. The down
side is that HG is SO much faster and easier to work with than the other
systems (I can design 4-5 HG ships in the time it takes to do 1 Striker Grav
tank) as I am NOT a gearhead....

Not an uncommon tactic, historically, for empires with unstable borders.

The history supplement in the _Imperium_ game gave me the idea that
the Ziru Sirka was doing just that on the Terran border for a while -
the local governor was trading marginal systems for periods of peace.

  I\'m not sure that this is a given, as the work I\'ve done isn\'t really
similar enough for me to say. We do know that these problems have been
handled before without computer technologies, however.

  Granted, although I\'m unsure where "verify" comes into it unless the
info is being double-checked for a prosecution - otherwise it would be
enough to simply repeat the reports at an interval (say, when a IMoJ
auditor pops by) and have the second occurrence be the confirmation.

>Offenses have to be fairly recent and notorious to get much

  I\'ve forgotten the Latin (from an economics course - go figure),
but "it does not follow". Unless the authorities are terribly over-
worked (e.g., our city police here) they should enact those warrants
they are told to (otherwise, you\'ve got a fairly remarkable obedience
problem, right?) - and if navy/COACC/army etc. elements are that busy
arresting smugglers and pirates then the glut should be over before
too long.

My explanation is that the teleporter _swaps_ with the contents of the
destination. Thus, if you teleport into solid rock, a solid rock
\'sculpture\' appears where you were, and you suffocate to death (unless, of
course, the rock was under pressure, in which case you might be crushed).

This neatly solves the air problem, without greatly changing teleporters\'
abilities.

It also lets a teleporter pop into the middle of a crowd of people, taking
big fatal chunks out of anyone his arm or leg happens to be
superimposed on. It also allows a teleporter who can jump twice
to take out a starship (port into the computer - not the computer room,
the _computer_ - wrecking it just by popping in). It allows a teleporter
to create a man-sized hole in a door so all his buddies can get
through.

I have memories of a Hero Games Champions player who bought
a mondo big killing attack, linked to his teleportation power - he\'d
teleport into something, blowing it up in the process. That got old
pretty quick...I hope he didn\'t hold the eventual story-concealed
play balance adjustment against me. ;)

I don\'t like the idea of allowing a teleporter to pop into a place already
inhabited by anything substantial - what qualifies as "substantial"
is debatable, of course.

actually i have thought of this as well.  i could see the Amish comeing to an
agreement with say..  the Terran Confedertion.  The Confederation would
protect their world(s) and establish tradeing ports tha twould keep trade
routes open (the amish might shun us, but they love our money)...

or possibly they would actually have another group of colonist with them on
the planet that are not Amish...  and not "turn-the-other-cheek" to boot.
they would trade with the Amish for food and other agriculturial needs...

protection and favor, and Whereas both Houses of Congress
have by their joint Committee requested me "to recommend to
the People of the United States a day of public thanks-
giving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with
grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God,
especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to
establish a form of government for their safety and

Now therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th
day of November next to be devoted by the People of these
States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who
is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is,
or that will be. That we may then all unite in rendering
unto him our sincere and humble thanks, for his kind care
and protection of the People of this country previous to
their becoming a Nation, for the signal and manifold
mercies, and the favorable interpositions of his
providence, which we experienced in the course and
conclusion of the late war, for the great degree of
tranquillity, union, and plenty, which we have since
enjoyed, for the peaceable and rational manner in which we
have been enabled to establish constitutions of government
for our safety and happiness, and particularly the national
One now lately instituted, for the civil and religious
liberty with which we are blessed, and the means we have of

all the great and various favors which he hath been pleased
to confer upon us.

And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our
prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of
Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other
transgressions, to enable us all, whether in public or
private stations, to perform our several and relative
duties properly and punctually, to render our national
government a blessing to all the People, by constantly
being a government of wise, just and constitutional laws,
discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed, to protect
and guide all Sovereigns and Nations (especially such as
have shown kindness unto us) and to bless them with good
government, peace, and concord. To promote the knowledge
and practice of true religion and virtue, and the encrease
of science among them and Us, and generally to grant unto
all Mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he
alone knows to be best.

$30?!? Sounds like it\'s your gaming shop that fleecing you.  Full Thrust

I kinda liked the last episode, except they didn\'t tie up all the loose ends, 
like, whatever *did* happen to Lennier after he left the Rangers, and what 
happened to Lyta.  But as a last episode, it didn\'t have too many surprises.  
I liked it anyways.

> Kinda, blah, hasn\'t it been?  It\'s lost its greatness.

Gotta keep in mind, the 1000 year history episode was originally intended to 
be the last B5 episode, when they weren\'t sure they were going to be able to 
do the entire 5 year arc.  It blew a couple story lines ahead of its time.  
And so did the 2 movies they did.  River of Souls sucked bigtime.

Contragravity is cheap under all versions of Traveller.

This C:G unit will allow very cheap streamlined atmosphere shuttles ... one
maneuver unit for actual thrust, then a couple of CG units to stop you
doing a good imitation of a brick.

Makes unstreamlined ships look better and better, really.

It was touching in parts, but it was so slow...and definitely not what I
expected.  Remember in season one when Garibaldi is flashed forward in time to a
big fight on the station.  This happens in that episode where B4 pops up.  He
yells, to Sinclair, "I was born for this!".

That never happened--and they\'ve been so good about details like that in other
episodes.

Also, what about all those flash forwards to Centauri Prime, with Londo on the
throne, Sheridan and Dlenn in Londo\'s jail, with G\'Kar coming out to kill Londo?

That should have happened some time in the series.

And...I was so damn disappointed in the resolution to the Shadow War.  Almost four
years of build up, then boom, "We\'re not children anymore", "go off and play by
yourselves in the space between the galaxies."

They set it up like it was going to be this massive, quasi-religious fight.  You
know--the Shadows are Evil;  the Vorlons are Angels of Battle.

And, then it was nothing.

Disappointment.

Yes it did.  I know that.  But, the last episode was filmed in the middle of
season four before they knew TNT was going to pick them up.  The last episode we
saw tonight was always going to be the last episode--whether it showed on regular
broadcast or TNT.  JMS just moved it to the end of season 5.

Still, I didn\'t find much in season 5 to get that excited about.  How can season\'s
2, 3, and 4 be some of the most incredible TV I\'ve ever watched, and season 5 be
so boring?


> And so did the 2 movies they did.  River of Souls sucked bigtime.

No kidding.  I liked "In the Beginning".  "Thirdspace" was OK--kind of an "Event
Horizon" rip-off, and I was kinda bored with it.  "River of Souls" stunk the high
heavens.  It was an effort to sit through it.

Personally I don\'t think learning European or Classical languages is
pointless, but round here it is fashionable to encourage children to learn
Maori (Ok, there\'s some point to this seeing as it\'s the traditional
language of a good chunk of New Zealand) and Asian languages. IMO more
emphasis on English would be a much better idea, given the state of
illiteracy a lot of people in this country seem to inhabit.

If we have to get that factory on line, then we pay the nice people at
Decafreighter their money, and we put the carton on the Arguvid Dancer.

Incidentally, in 1616 the Venetian Ambassador to Spain chose to take a
2-masted Provencal felucca (described in a 1632 account as \'the smallest of
all oarships\') from Genoa to his post in Spain, and have his family go
later via a bigger ship (ref is Braudel, Meditteranean, p296).

so far, same as MTU.

Here we differ immensely. Based upon the tables in MT Ref\'s, the system is
a penetrating sensor at all but the lowest TL\'s. IMTU, it maps the density
of the targeted object (in 3d) to a depth of the penetration rating
(Assuming that the up down axis is the axis of scan). I assume accuracy to
the depths shown of about far orbit... then it drops by x0.5 per band
beyond that.

IMTU, this works by measuring the separate gravitational inlfuences to
10^(-20) G\'s or more...

Then again, IMTU, to use a densitometer, you need to turn off your
T-plates, Inertial compensators, and artificial (except spin-derived)
gravity. That big a source so close overwhelms the poor sensor....

Also, a densitometer can, IMTU, be used for detection of a black-body, and,
given time for multiple location sampling, provide a bearing. (Fly three
legs at right angles to each other... for ex, 1 hour on axis Z, one hour on
axis Y, and one on axis X... this will define a spherical object \'s
direction, and if the length of each leg is long enough, give it\'s rough
distance (as you measure curve shape and strength change). A densitomiter
has saved my PC\'s from death in  "Empty" hexes on the map more than once.

BTW, there is a "RealWorld Densitometer"... careful tracing of an orbital
body\'s orbital perterbations can reveal a very rough density map of the
body being orbited. IIRC, mars is being so mapped... again IIRC, resolution
is measured in kilometers, and pen is incredible... (fairly deep. IIRC,
they are attempting to figure out the rough core-mantle-crust ratios of
Mars by observing the satellites.) Earth is already being mapped this way.
More time and more objects to be observed is allowing a somewhat better
mapping, from what I\'ve heard.

IMTU, you can measure the "Ivy-Factor" of a major Imperial Institution by
how many professors teach language courses other than Galanglic and the
local tongue(s).... IMTU, Uni of Regina at Regni has a staff of about 1000
professors, including the 30 at the JumpSpace Institute, and over 150
teaching "Dead or Dying" languages, including Geonee, Old High Vilani,
Greek, Latin, English (Olde, Middle, Victorian, Informational[our modern],
Stellar], Klingon, Spanish, a half dozen vargr archaics, Archaic aslan,
pre-terran Tl\'Zedl (Sp? AKA Daryan), Norwegian, Sweedish, German, Russian,
Nederlander, Old Sylean, Middle Sylean (aka Cleon\'s sylean], Oinprynth.
Most of the Languages dept are fluent in 2 or 3 archaics, and 2 or so
moderns,, and teach 4 courses at a time, most teaching one in each language
and making the difference up with general ed histories and galanglic &
local language courses.

Still IMTU, U of Mora has but twenty, teaching only the most direct
descendant toungues of those spoken in the marches, and many prefer the URR
to UM, since the "Educational CHoice is better", even if UM has better
instructors (Average instuctor skill level is higher). This include most
PC\'s who\'ve heard the bit.

One of the wonderful things about living in alaska is the nearly total mix
of americana in Anchorage... people from everywhere in the country... and
many from beyond. While I\'ve not personally met any practicing menonnites,
almish, or quakers, I\'ve met many who\'ve left for various reasons.... Even
ex-___ of most of the above groups are more than wiling to share their
experiences. They all seem to have a profound sense of "God will provide"
combined with "Let others do as they wish, we\'ll follow our way to god,
just please don\'t try to make us follow their ways." I met one lad, who,
until his 15th year, had never owned a shirt with buttons. Another had been
raised in a mixed environment, and while not barred from watching TV, never
had had access to one except through school chums. The one thing they all
seem to share is that each community\'s ordinum (or equivalent) sets its own
policies, approaches, and tech-levels.

Then again, I\'ve also met a number of Russian Orthodox Old Believers...
(Alaska, as a US state for 50 years, and having been a Russian Colony until
the mid 19th C, has a lot more orthodox than one might think.) There are
towns where the whole of the town or village is labelled in Russian. It was
1987 before the state required english to be taught in the schools (Russian
Village, it would seem, was up til then conducting ALL courses in russian).

Languages survive encroachment in enclaves much better when they are linked
to strongly held religous beliefs or practices. So many of the (From what
I\'ve read, Germanic Derived) communities of Amish & Mennonite by religious
isolation also continued to use the old language along with the old ways.
Alaskan Russian Orthodox who aren\'t OCA affiliated (And there are quite a
number who aren\'t, but it is dropping fast) often maintained russian as the
laguage of the faithful, as well as needing it to understand the edicts of
the muscovite synod.

And also as a strong second language across much of Eastern Europe as I
discovered to my relief whilst travelling there.  For fairly obvious
reasons older folk spoke it better than the younger ones, but it wasn\'t
hard to find a German speaker on the streets of Gdansk for example.  (This

        You are one of the only people I have ever met who understands this.
Being a part-time Violence Professional myself, it can be fustrating at
times to listen to folks who are non-violent and figure I/ my job is the
root of all thier problems...  As I say, I keep wishing for the day when
someone puts my whole job description outta buisness.  Until then.....

        The Roman Empire, for example.  The local Governor was the Power,
and as long as the tax money kept flowing back to Rome with yearly reports,
then the Emperor didn\'t send a Legion in to find out why.  The local
Governor was backed by a local Garrison, usually a Cadre of Romans with the
infantry drawn from the local populace in exchange for Citizenship.  So, if
you wanted to oust the Governor, you had to beat the local Garrison in late
fall, and get organized to deal with the Legion sent to restore power in
late spring.
        To over-simplify, Masada is an example of what happens when you are
able to beat the Garrison and the Legion shows up.  I have always thought
that this would be more or less the way the 3i worked.  It\'s the model I use
for the UN administered Terran Sphere.

It seems very likely to me. YMMV.

You\'ve put your finger With unerring precision on the point I\'ve been trying
to make for the last three or four posts. We ARE told that all messages goes
through the X-boat system (with the in MT introduced Emperor\'s secret network
being an exeption). I\'m not disputing that. What I am questioning is the
sense of letting the strings of government go at the average rate of 2.6
parsecs/week when an alternative system with an average speed of 5 parsecs
or more exists? _Already_ exists?

What money? 5 credits for a message chip? If the IN is sending regular
couriers back and forth between the Admiralty and the various fleet HQs,
you don\'t need anything else to expand it to carry important government
messages. You could maybe convince me that the amount of sheer bumpf
produced by the colonial administrations would overload the memory banks
of a standard fleet courier, but only if the amount of information they
passed along to each other was truly staggering  --  the kind of information
you so vehemently deny that they would bother to pass along  --  I doubt it
myself, because you can get a lot of information into vary little space
even today, and goodness knows what they will be able to do at TL 15, but,
assuming for purposes of argument that that really was the case, a simple
priority scheme would see all the important orders and reports go by naval
courier and the rest following after by X-boat.

Basically, it select three GUPRP titles at random, and the would-be

automatically open any linked doc into Wordpad, allowing you

This scheme works equally well with Notepad; simply change
"wordpad" above to "notepad". Of course, Notepad doesn\'t have
all the fancy formatting functions of Wordpad but it easier
to use in some ways than Gal2.4\'s "vi" editor.

Thanks to Jeff Zeitlin for suggesting how to do this.

I\'ve confirmed (so far, at least) that Gal2.4\'s menuing
calls Note/Wordpad editors with no problems. Jim V., you\'ve
done one *incredible* job!!!

A couple of caveats about Windows\' editors are in order, though.
1) Obviously, if you\'re going to use Word pad and want to share
your files, recipients must also use Wordpad. Notepad files are
still .txt format and easily opened by Gal2.4\'s default editor.

2) It has been my experience that Wordpad under Win95 will always
ask you if you want to convert the file to Wordpad format every
time a non-Wordpad txt file is opened, requiring you to select
"No" if you don\'t want the file converted. This can get pretty
annoying. Wordpad under Win98 *doesn\'t* do this; I don\'t know
if NT has this issue or not.

I was just telling somebody else that communication and regulatory fees go
up with the square of the planets while taxation is directly proportional.
Eventually, you\'ll hit a boundary where regulating a planet costs more than
you can collect in taxes.  At that point it is economically unfeasible.  The
collapses are examples of involuntary border reductions.

I suppose with all the imperial clones running around, the best method would
be to expand in one direction until you reach that boundary.  Then send your
clone out there and undergo imperial mitosis, creating two empires run by
the same (cloned) emperor. I suppose that is the de facto Imperial model
with the Archdukes controlling their domains.

Even here in the US the Amish won\'t appear in court. There are Organizations
of non amish who decide to go to court and protect their rights. This is
obviously necessary for them to maintain their culture anywhere in the
universe, and often these groups outside of what we know as the US may have
to act more aggressively. There are always people willing to press their own
rules upon those who do not believe the same but "turn the other cheek". In
a situation like this there would definately be such a group to look after
them, there are enough groups out there just looking for a way to represent
the meek, oppressed or downtrodden.

That\'s very nice and all, but really doesn\'t apply to those of us not in your
country. For instance, here in Canada we celebrate Thanksgiving in October.

So, since this has no relevance to Traveller, or to non-American subscribers of
the TML, why is it here?

It never happened because it was an alternate history that Sinclair
avoided by taking B4 back in time to assist the Minbari in their
shadow war.

It happened in War Without End. Why show it yet again? Besides, we saw
the aftermath; a happy Emperor Vir cavorting with his wives, without
any Drakh influence to be seen anywhere.

If you had that attitude, I guess then you could be disappointed. It
wasn\'t "evil vs good". That was clearly pointed out before the war\'s
resolution. More like "order vs chaos" instead.

Perhaps because you didn\'t get to see huge fleets of ships blowing up
each other?

For a unique TV series, I think JMS did an absolutely fantastic job of
piecing together a five year long program with a beginning, a middle
and a conclusion.

In the beginning broke too much, IMO. The whole blackstar thing
makes no sense at all put in the context that the Minbari drive
around killing mission-killed ships. Using a distress call was made
(in the real episodes) to sound like what it sounds like--you\'re
killing people coming to save you. Using it to get the enemy to come
finish you off, then killing them shouldn\'t have lost Sheridan any
sleep at all. Made no sense at all.

ObTrav: What happens to disabled ships in traveller? In our games we
always played that disabled ships became non-combatants. The winning
side would pick up survivors, and they were typically well treated.
(Imperial/Zho anyway). A distress call made from a damaged ship
would basically disqualify it from combat--using it as a lure would

Well, Sleeping in Light was meant to tie up the threads of the
Sheridan/Delenn storyline.  "Crusade" debuts in January, and we\'ll probably
see characters like Lennier and Lyta at various points in that series.

That was a timeline where B4 *didn\'t* go back to fight the Shadows 1000
years ago.

Londo becomes Emperor in 2262.  In 2281, Vir Cotto is Emperor.  "In the
Beginning" shows Londo on the throne with Sheridan and Delenn as his
prisoners, talking about how their son is safe.  Since the Keeper that
Londo presented to Sheridan and Delenn was suppossed to be presented to
David when he turns sixteen, we can assume that the Londo/G\'Kar Celebrity
Deathmatch takes place around 2271.

But they\'re not!  The Vorlons and Shadow weren\'t good or evil, they were
two obsessed races that had lost sight of their goals in favor of
advocating their views.

Remember that Delenn had ordered "no mercy" at the beginning of the war..
so the Black star was just following orders coming back to kill Sheridan\'s
cruiser.

Part of the reason the Minbari were so upset about Sheridan being appointed
to command B5 was his reputation as the Starkiller.

Depends on the opponent.  The Zhodani are honorable about respecting ships
that broadcast "disabled in distress" and will pickup lifepods.  Many Vargr
raiders will not.  Sword Worlders have a nasty habit of finishing off
crippled ships.

Where\'d you get that?  I have the whole B5 series, in its entirety, on tape, watched it
more than once, and I didn\'t get that out of it.

If you can name the episode, I\'ll go back and check it out.  You\'re probably referring
to either the B4 episode in the first season, or the B4 two-parter in the third season.

Right, and they never explained what Sheridan was doing there in prison.  We never saw
exactly what was happening between G\'Kar and Londo.

There\'s too much set up there for it to be guess work.

Yes, I got the Law and Chaos thing--the resolution still was a big let down.

First season sucked.  Seasons 2, 3, and 4 are the best viewing experience I\'ve ever had
with a televison program.  Season 5 was a snoozer.

MT has sizes for Missiles. I use them for HG as it is similar.

Each displaced 0.1kL - with a 13.5kL scale to the dT. So you get 135
missiles per dT. Or 2.7 battery rounds for a 50dT bay. ;-)

Anyone got a viable clone technology so half of me can concentrate on the

that or I could win the lottery so I didn\'t have to design detergent

Chris - Rob\'s in Canada so that\'s $CAN.

$18 = 11 GBP approximately. Ouch!

There again, we pay pound for dollar prices here (eg an iMac costs the

I know.  That\'s what I\'m bitching about.  If they were Law and Chaos all along,
then why all the quasi-religious stuff along the way.

Shadows were always demonized.  Lorian has goat eyes and looks like somebody\'s
interpretation of the devil.  The Vorlons look like religious creatures to all
who view them.

These are just three of the religious references that saturate the Shadow
storyline all through seasons 2,3, and 4.

Before you know a lot, they lead you to believe that this Shadow war thing was
going to be Armageddon--an all out blood bath between good and evil.

Then, oops, let\'s correct that.  It\'s really just law and chaos.

Then, oops again, lets have some stupid resolution to the conflict, with Sheridan
and Dlenn in some sort of stasis, their minds whisked away elsewhere to someplace
the Shadows and Vorlons can talk to them.  Let\'s slap the older races on the hand
for screwing with us all these millenniums and send them packing to the space
between the galaxies.

Corn-ball!

I waited 4 years for that?  All that build up?  All that fantastic TV, and that\'s
how they end it?

Jeeezzz.

For myself, I\'m a Babylon 5 junkie. Heck, I even liked "Infection", as bad
as it was. And I _did_ like "Sleeping in Light"...a good ending, IMHO.

And I liked the Shadow War, and how it ended. I liked the fact that the
Shadows and Vorlons were neither good nor bad...that simply _were_.

Good stuff...I\'m going to miss it. Thank god for reruns...

YMMV, of course.

 To which I had replied:
  The problem is that in a 2-D environment (northern India, southern Africa,
the Solomani Autonomous Region) the defense budget decreases close to the
square of the area enclosed (with a relation to the similar capacity of nearby
empires if they overbuild), and the fleet will be vastly more expensive than
commo issues under most tech regimes (RW, Trav, not quite in FASA\'s Renegade
Legion, IIRC).

  This assumes that the interior doesn\'t need available defense strength at
the same establishment as the frontier, although given Trav Jump drives it
is strategically reasonable to store reserves even a couple of sectors back.

  Given Trav weapons ranges (long) any realistic combat system will give
fire control results that make immobilized ships (at least) dead meat.
I\'m not sure what else would count as a mission kill - depends on the
battlefield repair rules in use.

I presume you mean $18US?  That works out to about $30 Canadian. However,
6 is only about $15 Canadian ($10US).

So, my thesis appears to stand - that the North American price is much
higher than the exchange rate would indicate.

It wasn\'t explicitly described, but since Sinclair had the vision
while on B4 and it involved him escaping while the station exploded,
it was assumed that this was an alternative history caused by the
action/nonaction of the participants.

"B squared" is the episode that had Sinclair and Garibaldi on B4 the
first time. "War without End Part One" was where Sinclair returned
from Minbar and warned that he too had had a vision where the base was
destroyed if B4 wasn\'t returned to the past.

Different strokes for different folks, then. Everyone else I\'ve spoken
to who saw the whole five years lauded JMS for having the vision and
capability to carry it out successfully.

Again, in your opinion. Many, many others appreciated what JMS did.

        It is performance-rated at jump-2, 2-G acceleration and 36EP
        Fuel tankage for 396 tons supports the power plant and 1 jump-2 plus
an additional 1 jump-1.  The ship is fitted with fuel scoops and a
purification plant.
        Adjacent to the bridge is a computer Model/5 fib and a redundant
Model/5 fib.  There is an auxiliary bridge.
        There are 25 staterooms, 0 standard low berths and 0 emergency low
berths and.
        The ship has 1 bay and 2 turrets. There is a 100-ton missile bay,
plus 6 beam lasers mounted on 2 turrets organized into 2 batteries.  For
defense it has an armor belt of 6 and an agility of 2.  There is a 64-ton
magazine and are 100% nuclear weapons normally carried.
        There are no ship\'s vehicles.  
        Cargo capacity is 0 tons.
        The hull is fully streamlined.
        There are 0.1 tons of waste space.

Section, 2 Engineers and 4 Gunners are required.  21 Marines (1/2 UN-CMC
Platoon) is carried as ship\'s troops.
        The ship costs MCr1560.54, including architects fees, less class
discounts and takes 48 months to build.  The first ship was launched in
2098, with a total of 100 of these ships anticipated to be delivered over
the next 20 years.  The lead ship is the UN-DSN Rome, and is stationed with
UN-DSN Dover Battle group in the Spinward areas of the established Terran
Sphere.

        Well, another option is that the weapons carried aboard those SDB\'s
are *mean* by comparrison...  500kg weapons vs 50kg....  1-shot-ship-wreckers.

        Here is the "canon" blurb on the first page.  Reproduced without
permission, all standard disclaimers apply.  Material from "Special
Supplement 3 - Missiles in TRAVELLER", which originally appeared in JTAS 21.

        O/____________________________________________
        O\\

        Standard missiles must be able to fit into a standardized
shipping/launch container. The launch container is fitted directly to the
launch rack and the missile is fired from it. The container includes
integral test circuitry, provides protection from extremes of temperature
and weather, and is isolated from the corrosive effects of atmosphere and
moisture.
        The standard container is a cylinder with interior dimensions of one
meter long and 15 centimeters in diameter. Sealed for safety and security,
the containers can be opened and the contents examined, removed or exchanged
- -- an important feature when components are to be custom assembled for
specific missile types.
Missile mass varies with the specific type of missile and is the sum of the
masses of the missile\'s components.         For convenience, missile mass is
used to determine space limitations on missiles. A standard container will
hold any missile of 50 kilograms or less; missiles in excess of 50 kilograms
are unable to fit in standard missile containers, and thus in standard
missile launch racks.
        Missile containers each mass 5 kilograms, and are disposed of when
the missile is expended.
        Missiles which exceed 50 kilograms must be handled in launch bays
available under the High Guard construction system; they cannot be launched
from ordinary turret missile launch racks.

        That\'s a Very Small Weapon, for a ship-killer.  Given that the
12nm-range (~21km) Styx system is about 2m long and ~30cm diameter.  The
Harpoon boxes are ~5m x ~60cm;  that\'s 500kg HE to 80nm (~140km).  Against
light cruisers or lower, a Harpoon could be argued to be a
1-shot-ship-wrecker.  The Styx is less effective, but cheaper too.

Your feedback, fellow sophonts?

Yes, I know. That wasn\'t my point. A point is made of the fact that
Sheridan feels bad about his ruse--that while a necessary act, it
was somehow dishonorable. Given what you add above, and the
fact that all Earth ships knew that a distress call would bring an
*attacker*, not an offer of aid, there is no reason to feel bad
about the ruse. Nor should the Minbari since their ship was simply
killed in combat, not through any act of treachery (it would only be
treachery if the Minbari expected to *aid* not destroy the ship in
distress).

The fact that the Blackstar\'s destruction was a dark spot in
Sheridan\'s mind was a good story point, IMO. The ItB movie trashed
that (retroactively).

True enough. Since your sensors won\'t show much other than lack of
maneuver, or dropped power sig (both could be faked) the only answer
would be "ships that send distress calls" on open frequencies.

I\'d expect that treaties might have some standard way of announcing
that a given combatant is out of the fray. This would be good since
otherwise combat is too deadly for crews, IMO. The idea that you
fight until you can\'t fight, then you are ignored til after the
battle is a good idea, I think. Obviously missiles in flight, etc.
would keep going.

I seem to remember finding an actual price for xmail messages somewhere. I don\'t
remember what it was, or where the reference was. I\'ll have to search when I\'m
at home. From what I remember, the price was high enough that you wouldn\'t get
spam like we do with email; you would, though, get bulk junk xmail like we get
with snail mail.

War Without End part I.  When the White Star is enroute to B4.  Bout the time
when Delenn is showing them the old Grey Council footage of the last war.
This is w/o going through my "B5 archives" and watching... 

> Yes, I got the Law and Chaos thing--the resolution still was a big let down.

I kind of thought so, too.  It seemed too much of a deux ex machina for me.  I
think a much better solution would have been for the Shadows and Vorlons to
stay and continue much as they had been, though the minor races would now be
wary of them and their manipulations.  Better yet, I think the Vorlons
could\'ve seen how they\'d strayed from the purpose (and that their theory had
been validated amongst the younger races).  Would\'ve allowed for a much better
feel than the creation of the Interstellar Alliance (which I find kind of
corny).  The Battle at Corrianis (sp?) 6 could\'ve been handled much better.
Had the Vorlon and Shadow fleets decimated, the Army of Light/other First Ones
could\'ve concentrated on destroying the Planet Killers and protecting the
planet, while the Vorlons and Shadows trashed each other.  It would\'ve allowed
much better politics, post-Shadow War.  

Course, i\'m still a Vorlon fan and generally favor their philosophy (which did
end up winning against the Shadow one, though also worked against the Vorlons
themselves).  The First Ones (Vorlons and Shadows included) just leaving to
never return is not a Good Thing IMO.

I liked Season 1.  Almost all of the large story arcs were (quite well IMO)
set up in season 1.  The Mantis Guy, etc.  The whole developing mystery of the
Shadows.  The special effects did improve alot once they moved off the Amigas,
though.  It peaks in Season 2 & 3 and starts going downhill in 4 IMO.   I like
the character of Sinclair better than Sheridan too.  Too much was obviously
converted from JMS\' original conception, too, IMO.  Ana Sheridan was obviously
substituted for Catherine Sakai, etc etc.  I\'m still curious on how the whole
Valen thing was to have worked out originally...  Valen/Sinclair "returning"
to the present (and "mysteriously disappearing" in the past?)

He did put USA in his subject header and by the nature of the subject, and the

I can see the entire 3I getting buried under the weight of the Make Money Fast 
scam.  Especially in areas where the law level is low enough to where the 
government isn\'t Big Brother enough to protect a sucker\'s money.

Of course, some planet\'s law levels will bounce even innocent messages back to the sender.  And the way the X-boat network works, I don\'t see them refunding anybody any money.  Take a good look at the small print on the back of a telegram form sometime.  Interesting stuff.  All they guarantee is the *attempt* to deliver the message.  I can see this as a way to keep the 3I from frivolous lawsuits ("Yer Honor, my client\'s latest Xmail scam was stopped by the government\'s cruel and heineous spam filters, thus depriving him and his planet of billions of credits.  Therefore, we\'re suing the Imperium for 99 trillion credits in speculative and punitive damages."  "Did you read the Xboat contract??").

Cause all we saw was the Vorlon side and propaganda until Sheridan went to
Zha\'ha\'dum.

That was just the Vorlon "programming."  What the Vorlons wanted the younger
races to believe, told while the Shadows were hiding & sleeping off the last
war.  I\'m a Vorlon fan/partisan and even I saw that.  

> Before you know a lot, they lead you to believe that this Shadow war thing

I never got the "Ragnarok/Armageddon" feeling out of it.  The perception I got
was that the Shadows were supposed to have been so powerful and building their
strength for so many years that they might be too much for the young races.
It all comes down to the Shadow goals and how weird their strategy seemed.
Neither the Shadows nor Vorlons had any intention of fighting the other before
Kosh dies and Sheridan "opens the unexpected door."

Kind of.   The communication thing was due to the influence of Lorien and the
Shadows/Vorlons trying to persuade them to choose their "way."  That was all
handled good IMO.  The part I just don\'t like was the old races flying off
never to return.

As for the last episode, it was both good and a bit of a let down.  Most of
season 4 and 5 were like that (though season 5 was worse), excepting the
battles for Earth and the bits bout the Drahk interplay on the Centauri.   All
IMO.  (Carefully leaving out any more spoilers on the last episode).

As for the Blackstar/Starkiller issue and ItB, I agree w/ Merrick.  It was
made to seem that Sheridan did something dishonorable, but I find no dishonor
in the way it was presented in ItB, nor should the Minbari warrior caste.
Especially considering how genocidal the Minbari were made in ItB.

Why? At least they\'re Science Fiction related, and the discussion on the
_In the Beginning_ distres call is relevant?

If you like I could post summaries of why the UK has various holidays when
they occur. They have as much relevance to this list. And before you cite
Armistice Day as previously being quoted remember that goes beyond national
boundaries.

Anyway - have a good holiday ;-)

I realize that Traveller doesn\'t have to be "Yanks in Space", and that
the Imperial legal system doesn\'t necessarily resemble that of the
United States in the late 20th century.  However, I wouldn\'t want to be
the attorney for the X-boat network, attempting to claim that a
deliberate refusal to deliver a message could be construed as an attempt
to deliver that message.  Of course, you could contractually limit
liability for failure to deliver a message to the amount of the postal
fee.  Alternately, you could have the Spam filters set up as an instant
check, performed before the postage is paid, thus preventing a potential
sender from paying for a message that won\'t pass muster.

Well, if we accept Andrew Moffatt-Vallance\'s "Prometheus Rising" posts
as representative of the Solomani attitude concerning war, we can
conclude that the Solomani are more likely to acknowledge that a ship
has "struck its colors" than the Vilani (see "Prometheus Rising", #4 of
6).  Besides, as a Pre-Contact Solomani familiar with current
intelligence doctrine, I believe that there\'s just too much good intel
to be gained from enemy prisoners to waste by destroying crippled ships.

  If you assume that the normal X-Boat (2.6 parsec/week) system does bill
for usage (it would be quite abuse-prone if it didn\'t) then they may very
well have local middle-managers who do nothing but concoct culturally
appropriate spam chain-mail (AC 5?) to maximize revenues. Naturally these
people would reincarnate as telemarketers...

  Data on paid spam replication could also be then forwarded to census
people as a useful indicator of how low local IQ is :)

It is interesting that you choose this topic to gripe about with all of the
other off topic posts from the past few months.  Instead, you choose to
gripe about a post about a holiday that some people celebrate and respect.

ObTrav:  I remember a post not too long ago about what holidays would be
celebrated in the 3I.  The declaration by General Washington would be a
good example of how and why a local/regional holiday would be delared and
started.

Well yes and no. I\'d say its a fairly safe bet that the Terrans (Solomani) went 
into the IW\'s respecting the Geneva and Hague conventions; but when the 
Vilani start killing prisoners and otherwise flaunting "established conventions" 
attitudes might well become less charitable. Plus to the Vilani, the Terrans 
habit of sparing a crippled enemy would present a tactical opportunity too good 
to miss. A few "tricks" and the Terrans would likely become very warry of any 
supposedly crippled Vilani ship. IMTU (IW variety) the Terrans respect 
prisoners and hold to the "conventions of War", but they are very careful of 
dead Vilani ships.

You could always do what Rolemaster does, if you teleport into any solid
object you don\'t actually teleport, instead you get stunned. Make it a
massive headache or something which will stop them from being able to try

It was a small post and a brief plea for people to remember why a holiday is
celebrated.  Have the respect for the spirit it was given in.  I m\'self posted
a month back a request to remember why some members had the day off for
Remembrance/Veterans Day (if I have missed how it is referred to in a
respective country it was of no slight, just this old Para can only remember
so much) because I felt that everyone needs a reminder once in awhile as to
why we take the time of for remembrance.  If it is of no interest to you then
pass on, but there is no need to gripe.  With everything passing on the list
between bay sizes, pirating, J-6 couriers, amount of Beenie Babies in a S-
class merchant, how many Zhondani commandos can dance on the bridge of a
Broadsword-class, ad naseum I think we can deal with a post or three wishing
the best on a national holiday on this multinational list.  I know I for one
and probably most others would not be put out by a wish by you for your own
country\'s observances; and would perhaps even learn something in the process.
So please give the respect that is do, take it in the spirit it was given, and
move on.

Off topic posts get posted here on this list all of the time.  In fact,
right now there are alot more that are about something that I have even less
interest in (Babylon 5).

I\'ve said this before to other complainers: If you have a problem with
off-topic posts, go after all off-topic posts. Why is the Thanksgiving post
any more offensive than the Babylon 5 posts? What relevance does Babylon 5
have to Traveller?

I have seen posts that are far more off-topic than the Thanksgiving post,
and no one raises an eyebrow.  "Starship Troopers" discussions raged for
weeks before anyone said "off-topic". I have seen "stupid criminals"
discussions that went back and forth for days with no complaints...

So why is this one post bad?

Why is Babylon 5 good and this post bad?

 A good way to strike your colors would be to emergency vent the core
plasma of your main fusion plant to space. (If you\'re hurt bad enough this
might happen anyway.) This would be pretty easy to detect even from far
off, and leaves little doubt of your further ability to fight. (Of course
all that radioactive muck now floating around you is a pretty nifty sensor
cover, so if you have a cool running auxiliary power source such as a fuel
cell and some missiles, you can do some nasty things to anyone coming too
close... probably suicidal but potentially effective.)

 I think this sounds good, now if we could only get pirates and vampires
to play fair too...

 Even fully independent missiles would have recievers for in-flight course
corrections plus an option for safe self destruct.

This doesn\'t affect me because I\'ve recently setup a mail account just to
receive TML messages, but before I received the TML in digest form.

I\'m not going to shout loudly, so:

in DIGEST form YOU read EVERY message. SPOILER spaces DON\'T work.

(considered that my attempt to be firm but without shouting :-)

There is a fair amount of "imperial mitosis" in the 3I.  That\'s why you
have subsector and sector governments, as well as the domains.  Each level
is a bit of an Imperium itself, with enough local authority and resources
to fix "little" problems like Vargr raiding and minor rebellions.

I won\'t argue about this point if anyone disagrees.  My next point is more
important:

Imperial clones:  Yes, they exist, but...

There is a depressingly common misconception about cloning that seems to be
appearing again here.  A biological clone is not a psychological duplicate
of its donor.  To achieve that, you would need a second technology - one of
memory recording and impression.

This technology doesn\'t really appear in canon material.  The closest it
gets, AFAIK, is in one of the CT adventures "Expedition to Zhodane", where
an Impie spy has his memory/personality fiddled with to circumvent Joe
telepaths.

Alternatively, RSB mentions simulacra - clones brought up in deliberately
identical circumstances to their donor.  Such clones would be similar to
their donor, but they would still not necessarily be "identical" in terms
of experiences and personality.

In either case, why should the donor regard them as copies of himself, and
vice versa?

A simpler exercise, and a very traditional one in the RW, is to simply pack
the most powerful noble positions with your relatives.  A easy way of doing
this, that doesn\'t necessarily tick off the other powerful noble families,
is through diplomatic marriages.  The problem with this, of course, is it
creates rival claimants to the imperial throne, each with their own power
base...

A quick look at the history of most ruling dynasties on Earth show plenty
of civil wars between members of the same family.  For sheer density of
fratricide, try the Ptolemy dynasty in about 1st-2nd century BC...

Cloning doesn\'t really solve the problem

I, altho\' a fan (Nigh on the japanese term Otaku) of B5 through season 4,
found ALL of season 5 had lost it\'s touch... I stopped watching after about
5 episodes of season 5. Was it worse than the start of season 5?

I limit it IMTU to 0 Cr. The X-mail contract does not guarantee delivery,
period. Only that the message will get as far as the x-mail station in the
target system. The local station, if practical, will attempt to use (in
order of precedence from first to last) local e-mail delivery, local
telecomm notice, local e-mail notice, local snail-mail delivery,
notification by "detatched Duty scout in person" (Gotta earn those 3 hots
and a cot...), posting of incoming message to the starport\'s ship-to-shore
register, lookup on local WWW equivalent of "Pending Incoming X-Mail",
holding for not more than a year in local terminal. Which is why, in my
campaigns, ship-board personell often call the scout base/office/rep upon
arrival. Old mail can be a really fun plot hook.

Not practical... while (IMTU, at least) long-range X-mails are rare, even
the fairly common 4-12 parsec range resulits in far too many worlds and
local governments to run the spam check at the origination end. And I
charge extra for multiple recipients... 10% extra per each, assuming same
destination world. No multiple mailing discout for different worlds.

IMTU, The average speed of X-mail is 3.6 Parsecs per 9 days along Routes,
and 1.4 parsecs per 10 days to outlying systems. Almost every world that is
not red zoned has a scout "Site"... in many cases this is a small (1 to 4
sophont) generic unit, which is manned by scouts, and handles the routine
traffic. IMTU, there are about 2.5 scout couriers per world on Commo
duty... and all x-mail runs from local world, to X-mail route world via
courier, along route to nearest route world to desination, then back to
courier for the jump(s) to the destination world. There are X-boats every 3
days on average along the routes, each way.

IMTU, the disclaimer for X-Mail reads something like as follows:

The party of the first part, specifically known as ____, also known as the
Sender, does hereby request the party of the second part, spcifically known
as the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service Communications Office, and also
known as the IISS-CO , to transmit from one site to another the message
submitted by the Sender, specifically the IISS-CO site at _____ (aka
Originating site) shall cause to arrive at the IISS-CO site at _____ (aka
Destination site)an electronically stored document, addressed to the party
of the Third part, Specifically known as _____, also known as the
Recipient. The Sender assumes sole and total responsibility for the content
of the  document. The IISS-CO shall make any reasonable and proper attempts
to notify the Recipient that said message is waiting at the destination
site, in accordance with IISS-CO Procedural Manual X-2 (X-mail handling
Manual). The IISS-CO shall bear no liability for the notification or lack
thereof of the recipient, nor the content or use of the document by the
Recipient. The IISS-CO may delay, re-route, or stop any message for any
reason, without notification of the sender, reciever, or any third parties.
Messages that are not immediately deliverable shall be held for not less
than 7 days, and not more than 365 days from arrival at the destination.
All documents shall be in a non-executable form, or during transfer,
re-encoded into such form. The IISS-CO may, if a message is unable to
arrive at the destination site, choose to issue a refund on the customary
conveyance fees, in whole or in part, at the sole discretion of the
commanding sophont of the Originating Site, without recourse by the Sender
or Recipient. The IISS-CO, may, at any site where the message may be
transimitted to, though, or by, release the document to the recipient, at
the discretion of the agents/employees/members of the IISS-CO upon
establishing that the individual is indeed the intended recipient to the
best of their knowledge (Imperial Citizen ID usually being the standard of
proof, if said ID\'s registry number is included in the Recipient
Information). In SUch cases, the IISS-CO shall not further transmit said

unauthorized modification to this release shall be deemed valid or binding.
Authorized modifications shall be found in IISS-CO Procedural Manual X-3

How does it deal with partial cases (ie what is defined as solid)?

Hmm, what about if teleporting meant that the atoms that were blocked
got left behind?
But I would think that anything short of a good vacuum would then kill
the teleporter.

I would particularly like to know if people think that you can teleport
to or from a pool of water.

would be (approximately) the population in 600 years?

2) What size of population is required to assure (hopefully) that genetic

3) Is there any canon reference to which animals the Solomani were working

4) Assuming there was an outside culture assisting (by information and

Catholic Church to be one - why? Normally, a colony would _have_ to enforce
as a matter of policy the notion of birth control - especially at the
begining (you need to be working on the infrastructure of the colony for a
year or two...not having babies). The Catholic _Church_\'s stance on birth
control would preclude them from endorsing this (note, I\'m talking about
the Church, not Catholics in general. I\'m refering to Dogma, not people
themselves). I\'m more interested in religions I\'m not familiar with:
Judism, Islam, Buddhism, Mormon, Scientology (hey, some people consider it
a religion - others a cult - I have no idea), Hindu....does anyone know
what these religions would think of "leaving the womb" (would they consider
it abandoning God\'s (Allah, etc...) plan, etc...), the neccessary practices
of colonization, etc...

Hmmm... IMNSHO, the Solomani Navy woukld adhere to the laws of warfare, and

However, SolSec ship are probably a little bit more.. enthusiastic about

Traveller-relevant, or a discussion of how a small group (IIRC mainly one
woman) got a parochial holiday adopted nationwide) I suspect no one would
have minded. I suspect people would even have tolerated it if the poster
had indicated that it was a greeting to Americans (and yes, I saw the USA
in the title).

FWIW, I would have liked to see some spoiler warning on the B5 posts
(we\'ve had most of S5 here, but not everything), and I definately wanted
to see some ObTravs. I\'m a B5 fan, but I discuss that on the B5 list, not
the TML.

annual \'suspension-of-disbelief\' rant/ 

The key thing to remember here is that canon densitometers (as well as nuke
dampers) are offshoots of gravitics technology. If we can make you feel like
you\'re sitting on your arse on your front porch as your ship pulls 3 G
acceleration without explaining it, I think trying to define _how_ and _why_
densitometers work is an major excercise in futility, much as Lord Kelvin
attempting to explain the internal workings of an Intel 4004 processor to his
peers back in the 19th Century. A better analogy would be Francis Bacon
attempting to explain the internal workings of an Intel 4004 processor to
_his_ peers.

William Roentgen, staring at the ghostly outlines of his hand in the phosphor
screen, would have said it\'s not possible to use these X-rays to create  a
three dimensional map of soft tissues of the human body.

Because _WE_ don\'t know how to do something does not rule it out nor is our
technological prowness anything to crow about compared to the 57th century.

	Yes, it doesn\'t (Unless you play G:T. Then, it is in UltraTech, so, 
Poof! Instant New Canon ;->). But still, keeping it as 
an experimental tech (meaning: it only works when the Ref wants), it 
allows for interesting one-shot scenarios. For instance, I recall an 
old Gurps: Cyberpunk adventure whose premises could apply to a 
Traveller adventure:

	"Yesterday you were in a party. Today, you awake, naked, in some 
sort of hospital room, tied up in a stretcher..."

	The PC is, unknowingly, a clone with a memory download of the donor 
up to the party. The donor makes regular memory recordings, in the 
hope of achieving immortality through the clones....

	Of course the original adventure had two big problems:
	1) We could argue for years whether a clone with a memory record is 
the same being or not, and whether there is any justification to the 
"immortality" claim. I believe there is not, but the donor *might* 
believe so. A reason for high-ranked nobles in the impeirum to have 
clones with regular memory downloads.
	2) The memory download would include the fact that you have clones, 
and you make regular memory recordings... No way around this. May be 
dealt with, I imagine.

Sounds fine, except \'hull\'  cost  should  be  based  on  asteroid
tunnelling  costs  to  simulate  mining  (FF&S2  Table  3).  Also
remember to add some  access  shafts  from  the  surface  to  the

for a utilities and communications trunk.  If the meson  site  is
very deep consider a modified air/raft as lift capsule.

Assuming the Male + Female = 10000 and all are 20 years old, and that
agressive breading is each female has one child a year, and that each
female starts breading at 20 and ends at 40. Population in 20 years is
110,000, asume that an equal amount of males and females exist.

We then start to go huge  as the old generation stop producing and the new
generation begin, +2500 in the first, +5000 in the second, +7500 in
the third, +10000 in the fourth, +12500 in the fith etc

After the next 20 years the population is 545,000 and this is only the
end of production of the first year of the second generation.

My head starts to seek other things to do at this point, because you start
to lose breading females cumalativly, while adding around 50,000 to
the population (this figire grows slowly over the next 20 years) and the
death rate hasn\'t come into it if we assum that everyone lives until
80.

So going on 1 woman producing 10 women, which is half the population,
every twenty years multiply the population by 5.

I\'d guess at 10,000,000 in the first 100 years, 31,250,000,000 in the
second hundred.

The answer is probably as many as you want in 600 years ....

Lowest breading population, assuming male = female, to be an
effective breeding population, (using the best breading techniques) is 26.

Someone posted a realy good artical about this a while ago, and this is
the figure that I havn\'t forgoted, the gental person who posted the
artical is the one you want to speak to about population growth.

For a canon answer see Pocket Empires, but off the top of my head its
around 10 years a TL, by this time, so say around 30 to 40 years.

Well, in the UK, until recently the Civil Service & a lot of other
Government institutions had `Crown Immunity\' - i.e. as servants of the
Crown, they were not liable to be sued - either as bodies or as
individuals.

Perhaps *this* is how the Imperial Beaurocrats & other such critters
avoid this problem.

32 years for technological uplift, assuming the following:

1.  The Resource Unit (RU) costs can be met in the standard amount of
time (20 RU/2 years for TL 9 to TL 10, 40 RU/10 years for TL 10 to TL
11, and 400 RU/20 years for TL 11 to TL 12) (1 RU=5,000 MCrImp in M:0);

2.  No failures occur in tech uplift tasks (nor are there any
spectacular successes);

3.  The society isn\'t doubling RU expenditure to halve time required;

4.  The world has a sufficient-quality starport to support the tech
uplift (D-class starport through TL 11, and C-class starport to get to
TL 12);

5.  The world has sufficient infrastructure to support the tech uplift
(infrastructure of 5 through TL 11, and infrastructure of 6 to reach TL
12).

Contrast this with 320 years, and 2300 RU, to advance from TL 9 to TL 12
without outside help....

	Both of the above assumes afew things.  First, it assumes that
it wouldn\'t be possible to illegally get an anonymous account and
avoid payment.  Admittingly, big advertisers wouldn\'t use this to
advertise;  but how much spam is from Kellogs or Wal-Mart?  No, its
get-rich quick scams and chain letters.  I can see hackers doing that
kind of stuff, just for laughs.

	Second, it assumes that the Imperial Government doesn\'t allow
advertising through the messages.  They have to pay for the system
SOMEHOW, and afew advertisements can really rake in the money;  it\'s
how we pay for our TV broadcasts afterall...

*thinks for a bit* fuck it. None of you will dob me in to work, right ?

This became an issue at my work, becuase my supervisor and me nearly did
something fairly illegal - an unlawful exchange of personal data with
another department.

I say nearly, because we thought we had all the permissions, and the disk
full of data nearly got back to us (our contact at the other end took a day
off, and to be blunt, that saved our asses).

We then found out it was illegal, and all sorts of fun things happened.

The short version is we got a crash course in your legal defenses as a
public servant in Australia. The short version is if you were doing your
job, and incurred civil liability, the Department will back you up, cover
costs etc. If you were going outside what you should have understood as
your job, the department will probably back you up.

If you brutally and wantonly go outside your job, you are on your own.

Why are long range x-mails rare ? I would expect a fair amount of

The Maximum sustainable rate of growth (for Humans) is around 3% per

I don\'t know about canon, but IMTU they start tinkering during the TC era, 
however they really didn\'t start in earnest until the RoM.

According to PE 32 years, but this can be halved by spending extra (and

in practice.

My bet would be one of the evangelical protestant sects (Brethern, Baptists,

Actually, you\'re making an assumption (or maybe I wasn\'t that clear). I do
_not_ equate the IISS xboat messages (xmail) to Internet email. On some
worlds you have to walk down to the IISS office and type your message
there. On others the IISS might be connected to the local datanet, but
they won\'t send anything until _after_ the funds are transfered into their
account. 

So there are no "anonymous accounts". The IISS will have your banking
information, or a securicam record of a physical visit. 

And hacking into the IISS computer net? That\'s an Imperial crime, and
Imperial justice is swift and hard (IMTU, at least).  Ditto for banks.
Part of the problem in the real world is that hacking is considered as
mischief by many people, in spite of the damage done, and part is that our
computer networks were not designed with security in mind.  

Chain letters and pyramid schemes? Sure, these go on, but tracing the
senders is a lot easier.

You\'re comparing apples and oranges. TV is a broadcasting medium, xmail is
pojnt-to-point. Think of telegraph and telephone and you have a better
analogy.

Now, you _could_ pay for lots of advertising letters. IMTU, the IISS would
take your money and deliver the messages - but they wouldn\'t give you a
bulk discount, and they would require firm destination addresses.

Well, if you assume by aggressive breeding that the males are kept as sperm donors
only and everything is run by the matriarchs (40+ years old), then you can use a
350 to 1 female to male population (assuming 1 coupling a day with about 2 weeks
off for rest).  Then, assuming they can predict the sex of the foetus, you can
abort the males in favor of the female as well as any genetically defective
offspring.

With THAT aggressive breeding you would start with breeding population of about 30
male donors and 9970 baby factories.  After 20 years the initial breeding
population would retire but would be replaced by the first of the new generation,
every year after that another Initial breeding population adds to the current
breeding population.  By year 40 the breeding population would be 20 times the
initial and I believe would increase by the same factor every 20 years as the
older breeding population gives way to the new generations.  The total population
is a different matter.

However, suffice it to say that a 10000 breeding population could expand to
10000x20^30.

However, this is not anywhere near the realistic growth rates.

	This would be a hard call...there is documented proof that both the Japanese
Navy and the United States Navy killed survivors of ship sinkings during WW2
(at the Battle of Midway, a Dauntless crew was picked up, interrogated, and
tossed overboard with filled water cans tied to them.  I cannot remember the
details of the US incident, but it was a submarine crew who machine-gunned
Japanese survivors.  I remember not being able to believe it, but it
apparently was confirmed.  The Navy discharged the captain of the sub quietly)
There was also a German U-boat captain tried and convicted of killing sinking
survivors, but I seem to recall there was no definate proof it actually
happened.  Everyone knows that the war-crimes trials had nothing to do with
justice.

The other poster that answered this question assumed each woman could
produce 20 offspring in her lifetime -- that would be the *most* any normal
woman could produce, not the average, and you can ask the women on the list
what their opinion of any such scheme would be.

Historically, frontier societies seem to grow at about 4% per annum --
about 4.7 offspring per woman, on average.  Even at this rate, your society
would reach 166 trillion population in 600 years.  The question would be,
how long can you really maintain the "frontier" society and its forces for
growth? A more reasonable estimate might be per GURPS Space:  figure up the
habitable land area of your world, divide by 175 million km^2 (Earth\'s
approximate land area), multiply by 10 billion people, and multiply again
by a fudge factor representing how habitable your world is, relative to
Earth.

> 

Species survival plans use a minimum breeding population of 500 (male and
female combined) as a rule of thumb for survival over 10 generations
without excessive drop in fertility from inbreeding.  This assumes that the
population remains steady, that each breeding pair produces the same number
of offspring, and that breeding is essentially random.  For each of these
assumptions that is not true, double the effective population size
required, although some controlled breeding schemes (half-sibling mating,
etc.) can actually reduce the numbers.

Note that this is breeding population. In a typical human society, the
breeding adults represent at most 60% of the total, so you\'d really need
about 800-850 of all ages, minimum. Note also that this does *not* avoid
inbreeding, it only keeps the level of inbreeding below the threshold that
stock breeders have found empirically leads to loss of fertility.

Finally, this is based on a 10-generation population bottleneck (like a
generation ship).  If the bottleneck is only one generation, and the
population is allowed to grow exponentially thereafter, the minimum
population in the bottleneck can be as low as 50 wholly unrelated breeding
individuals (25 male and 25 female).  

By the way, your 10,000 population will not show *any* significant
inbreeding (< 1%) even if held constant over a period of as much as 2,500
years.  I did the math for the ESA Long Range Colony Mission, and it is
simply too large a sample to matter.

 Battery round for a triple missile turret is 9 missiles.  3 per rack.  Then 
 you get to reload.
  >>

	This turns out not to be correct...
	Battery-Round (n):  The amount of fire from one weapon per one fire round.
Hence, a triple missile rack (with 3 launchers) can fire 1 missile from each
weapon in the turret per combat round, thus equalling 3 missiles per turret
per round.  Therefore, one battery-round is 3 missiles, with a turret holding
3 battery-rounds of ready ammo.  Works the same for the bays.

Me again:
IMTU, based upon SMC, SotI (Sup _), and a handful of other stuff: Yes, the
navy runs a semi-separated system. But it\'s nodes are J5-6, and couriers
stand-by. Each fleet also carries a J-6 courier. Typical procedure would be
Fleet GOing to system x, with plans to go to Y. Courrier goes to Z, and
picks up orders and goes to Y. Jump 6, aerodyne Fuel-Skimming enabled
couriers can jump more rapidly than no M-drive X-boats, especially if they
have a good accell, and T-Plates.

Then again, Since I use Mega, it is possible to build a 2J6 design with
2G\'s... I\'ve done it.

My understanding also comes form visiting Amish (in this case in
Ohio).  They did indeed not simply want to live a hundred years
ago.  They wanted to keep a simple, religious life style.

One aspect of this is observing the Sabbath.  I was told they would
use electricity (one example was a carpenter that had a generator
so you could run a table saw) but wouldn\'t hook up to the municipal
electrical supply because that would mean they were requiring a
man to work on the Sabbath.

Yes, you do.  You can come up with routes for such couriers that
leave out most systems (even compared to X-boat routes).  Also,
I doubt the Imperium is going to be sending a jump-6 courier
every few days for routine traffic.  Instead, I can see them
being around to be used for the occaison high priority message.

Such a system will be in no way sufficient to carry messages on
an X-boat kind of level.

        Here\'s a few I just whipped off with my spreadsheet.  IMTU, I

        TL 9 Foxhound   (More effective, Carried Commercially)
        6G13 Limited Burning Motor, Radio Guidance, Proximity Fused, Force
Focussed Explosive Warhead, 48kg Cr6210
        The TL 9 Foxhound does a minimum of 8 Hits on detonation.

        TL 9 TigerStar  (Fighter-launched "Torpedo"...  two or three of

        7G21 Discretionary Burning Motor, Radio Guidance, \'Smart\' Fused ,
30kg Force Focussed Explosive Warhead, 64.8kg Cr25890
        The TL 9 TigerStar does a minimum of 12 Hits on detonation.

        TL 10 Arrow-12  (Bay launched, military-only.  Diety help you if it
actually *hits* you, since its speed piles another *12* hits of kinetic
energy, plus the 15 hits for being at ground zero)
        12G49 Discretionary Burning Motor, Neutrino Homing Guidance, \'Smart\'
Fused , 0.3Kton yeild Enhanced Radiation Warhead, 103kg Cr2,782,900

Because the *last B5* for me (and the rest of the UK) was midway through
series 5....

As to not reading anything with B5 in it; that precludes discussions
involving the Earthforce Sourcebook combat system re Battlerider etc,
discussions on the previous 80+ episodes and films and so on, all of which
could be relevant to the topics covered on this list....

Actually, all but the last episode (and even it to some extent), seem to be
leading into another set of movies (Drahk war/Centauri Liberation, Telepath
War, Pak Morah cooking show).

Notice, we still haven\'t met David, and Lenir (Lancelot?) is still out
there (yes, he\'s implied to be dead in the last episode, but how?). Calling
this the "last" episode of Babylon 5 simply is a misnomer, it\'s only the
last of the series.

I loved the last episode, it did exactly what it was ment to, bring the
series to a close. People expecting a space opera type "go out with a bang"
show may be missing the whole vision that Michael intended. I was
disappointed at not seeing a Vorlon ship with Valen/Sinclair waiting for
Sheradon, but Lorien worked for me :)

(On Topic) How many have used snipits from B5 as inspiration/plot devices
in your campaigns.

Wondered who would miss the point, your likely not the only one... B4\'s
transit back in time stopped that from happening. Notice it was Sinclair,
not Sheradon that was with Garibaldi in that flashback, but right after
that, Sinclair was sent to Mimbar.

Question is, will it happen at all. The last episode and the "In the
Beginning" movie imply it will, and in a sense, they don\'t need to show an
episode with that except to tell how Delen and Sheradon get there in the
first place (and of course, get out).

I have a fealing that it was cut short by the fact that JMS and Babylonian
production\'s fear that they didn\'t have enough time for a long, drawn out
space opera fight, they thought they had to resolving the series sooner
than they wanted. Your dissapointment probably came from the suddenness of
the end. If JMS had time to feed us more info before the end, it wouldn\'t
have been such a shocker.

I need to lower the number of colonists then...I\'m trying to create a
situation where the colonists would be worrying about breeding and such.
The basis is that the mission originally had enough breeding adults, but
that an accident in transit killed a significant portion of them. Thus the
survivors need to do some clever stuff to survive. But I assumed that the
numbers would be higher...so I need to change things a bit. Not a problem,
and I\'m glad I asked before finishing up.

The scenario is this:
  The colonization mission consists of C adult colonists (age 20 to 40) and
E embryos, all frozen. During the mission, a significant percentage of the
adult colonists (say 80-90%) die in hibernation due to an accident.

  Eventually, the colonists arrive and are awoken to learn that the
majority of their numbers have not made it. In order to bolster the
population, the majority of the women that can carry children are
_required_ to bear many children. In order to keep jealousy down, each
woman is not required to bear the children of any colonist except her
husband/lover - however, for every child that is "natural", they also carry
one of the embryos to term. This encourages diversity. A problem that
occurs is that of workforce - a lot of people died, so some labor is lost.
The colony picks up the slack by relying on robotics. Indeed, many of the
children are raised by primitive nanny-bots (under supervision, of
course...the bots are rather stupid).

  Comments? Any idea what kind of numbers I\'m looking at? And what kind of
population this world might have in 600 years?

You are referring to Eck of U-852, but Donitz\' instruction 154, written in
November 1939, ordered crews to \'Rescue no one and take no-one with you.

The *Imperium* probably wont. Imperial corporations, on the other hand ...

Let us take one route ... Efate to Regina. 6 parsecs. Maintainence may be
have to be done at Rhylanor, which will add about 15% inefficiency to the
system.

Efate is the economically dominant world in Regina subsector, while Regina
is the subsector capital. Thus, most important corporations will have
offices on both worlds, which will need to keep in touch.

Now, it is going to take Xboat messages, what, 3 weeks to get from Efate to
Regina.

A jump-3 express packet can do it in 2 and a bit weeks, stopping briefly at
Knorbes to either refuel or jumping through, if it is carrying 2 jump-3s
worth of fuel.

The question is therefore, what is being one to two weeks ahead of the
competition in news worth ?

>Such a system will be in no way sufficient to carry messages on

That depends on your level of investment.

Don\'t forget that the British machine gunned the crew of U-110 after they
surrendered. The British searched her and found the naval codes (somehow the
German crew forgot to throw them overboard in the confusion). The British
realized the gold mine they had and drew the obvious conclusion about dead men
not talking....This is a blatant war crime (and one condoned by senior
officers), but I\'m glad they did it, as this really crushed the Kriegsmarine
(besides, I still hold a grudge). The British could now evesdrop when the
Admiralty ordered U boats to a specific location. The convoys wouldn\'t be
there, but the B-24\'s and Sunderlands would... Between this and Enigma, we
knew more about the Kriegsmarine than they did...:-)

Ob traveller: Any thing like this happen cannonically? I would think that the
Imperium would kill any Zhodani that found out about the Black Globes, and the
Imperial Psionics research projects...

        So, if you keep your warhead yeild down (cost MCr3 per 0.1Kton

most of the cost of the Star Lance is the warhead.  However, you have
million-credit missiles....  given that you pretty much need USP 5+ to
guarantee a hit, that is awful pricey munitons to have then enemy frying
with beam weapons.  Again, if *one* Star Lance gets through, its "Bedtime

The Hasidic and Orthodox Jews use this same routine. I remember that when I

electricity and/or gas switchs that were forgotten. Once the Sabbath candles

They have gotten very clever with long cooking crock pots (turn on before
Sabbath). The interesting thing is that they only got offended if they found
out I was Jewish (when you work for the PD you work their hours...). They
didn\'t mind a Gentile doing this for them, but they didn\'t want a Jew to sin

It should be remembered that UltraTech is a list of equipment,
grouped by appropriate TL, that a GM _can_ put into his/her
campaign.  It is by no means required, esp for Traveller.
IMO, any tech that is listed in a GURPS suppliment (that is
net explicity allowed or disallowed in GT) is up to the GM.

Another problem with clones is the time it takes to grow them.
I haven\'t heard anything explicitly mentioned in canon, but I
guess it is assumed that the Imperium has technology that can allow
you to grow a clone to adulthood w/out having to wait 18 years.

Go to this page to learn more about the Laconia incident: 
                   http://uboat.net/ops/laconia.htm

On Sept 12, 1942 at 2207 hours U-156 under the command of Kptlt. Werner
Hartenstein torpedoed a large target in the South Atlantic in position 05.05S,
11.38W. The large vessel was the British liner Laconia (19,695 tons) which
sank at 2323 hours. The liner was carrying a 136-man crew, some 80 civilians,
military material and personnel (268 men) and approx. 1800 Italian prisoners
of war with 160 Polish soldiers on guard. 

Radio message from Laconia (sent on Sept 12, 2222 hours on 600 meters-
frequency) 
SSS SSS 0434 South / 1125 West Laconia torpeded

Shortly after the sinking the crew of U-156 was amazed to hear Italian voices
in the sea amongst the people both in lifeboats and also struggling in the
water itself. Hartenstein immediately began rescue operations and radioed for
assistance, both from nearby U-boats and also sent out uncoded messages to
every vessel around to assist, promising to cease hostilities. 

Radio message from U-156 to BdU (sent on Sept 13, 0125 hours ): 

Versenkt von Hartenstein Brite "Laconia". Marinequadrat FF 7721 310 Grad.
Leider mit 1500 italienischen Kriegsgefangenen. Bisher 90 gefischt. 157 cbm.
19 Aale, Passat 3, erbitte Befehle.Sunk by Hartenstein British "Laconia". Grid
FF 7721 310 degrees. 

Unfortunately with 1,500 Italian POW\'s. Till now 90 fished. 157 cubic meters (oil). 19 
eels, trade wind 3, ask for orders.

Uncoded message     (sent on Sept 13, 0600 hours on 25 meters-frequency ): 

If any ship will assist the ship-wrecked \'Laconia\'-crew, I will not attack
providing I am not being attacked by ship or air forces. I picked up 193 men.
4, 53 South, 11, 26 West. - German submarine. 

In the next days U-156 saved some 400 survivors, hold 200 on board and the
other 200 in lifeboats. On Sept 15, at 1130 hours U-506 under Kptlt Erich
Wrdemann arrived at the scene and continued to rescue the survivors. A few
hours later U-507 under Korvkpt. Harro Schacht and the Italian submarine
Cappellini also arrived. The boats headed for shore, towing the lifeboats
behind them and hundreds of survivors were both in and inside the U-boats
themselves. 

On Sept 16, at 1125 hours an American B-24 Liberator bomber operating from the
Ascension Island arrived at the scene where its pilot spotted the boats (which
at that time flew the Red Cross flag and were clearly not hostile to anyone).
The pilot radioed back to his base asking for instructions and was told to
attack at once which he did at 1232 hours, forcing the U-boats to cut the
lines to the life boats and submerge immediately, leaving hundreds of people
again struggling in the water. 

Thankfully this US intervention caused not as much loss of life as it could
have as shortly afterwards some neutral French warships from Dakar arrived at
the scene and started picking up survivors. Also many had been taken into the
U-boats themselves and were safe there (only because the bomber failed to sink
them though). Roughly 1500 survived the sinking. 

This incident prompted one of the most controversial order Dnitz ever issued,
usually known as the Laconia order today, it made it absolutely clear that no
U-boats were to take part in any rescue operations from that date and leave
any survivors in the sea. Up until that time U-boats had on very many
occasions helped the survivors of their victims with supplies, water,
directions to nearest land and so on. 

Laconia-Befehl (Laconia order)

1) Jegliche Rettungsversuche von Angehrigen versenkter Schiffe, also auch das
Auffischen Schwimmender und Anbordgabe auf Rettungs- boote, Aufrichten
gekenterter Rettungsboote, Abgabe von Nahrungsmitteln und Wasser haben zu
unterbleiben. Rettung widerspricht den primitivsten Forderungen der
Kriegsfhrung nach Vernichtung feindlicher Schiffe und deren Besatzungen. 

2) Die Befehle ber das Mitbringen von Kapitnen und Chefingenieuren bleiben
bestehen.

3) Schiffbrchige nur dann retten, wenn ihre Aussagen fr das Boot von
Wichtigkeit sind.

4) Bleibt hart. Denkt daran, das der Gegner bei seinen Bombenangriffen auf
deutsche Stdte keine Rcksicht auf Frauen und Kinder nimmt!

1) Every attempt to save survivors of sunken ships, also the fishing up of
swimming men and putting them on board lifeboats, the setup right of
overturned lifeboats, the handing over of food and water have be discontinued.
These rescues contradict the primary demands of warfare esp. the destruction
of enemy ships and their crews.

2) The orders concerning the bringing in of skippers and chief engineers stay
in effect.
 
3) Survivors are only to rescue, if their statements are important for the
boat.

4) Stay hard. Don\'t forget, that the enemy didn\'t take any regard for woman
and children when bombarding German towns.

This order was used as an excuse for the controversial conviction of Dnitz
for war crimes at Nremberg in 1946. Most sensible people agree that the
German U-boats fought hard but fair considering the situation and the US
submarine force fought with the same aggressiveness against japanese shipping
(and if anything the US subs were more unforgiving). Thus many say that Dnitz
was simply punished for being too efficient at his job and his U-boats having
been to much of a threat to allied shipping and the outcome of the war. Dnitz
served 11 years and 6 months in prison.

Other then the tech bit, sounds good.
On the tech, it sounds like you my have some big holes in trained pers. Sure
you have info on all the things to be done, but who knows what it means
(I.e. car engines, who know how to fix when broken or understand in detail
the info on how to fix them). So I can see a tech drop at first then a slow
rebuild. For a good example read C.J.Cnerryh\'s "Forty Thousand in Gehenna".

I\'ve been trying to avoid responding to this thread, but...

Actually there are lots of documented allied war crimes.  

Apparently there was lots of "not taking prisoners" happening in the
Pacific theatre, particularly after rumours about what was happening in the
Japanese POW camps started leaking out.  The "suicidal desperation" of
Japanese troops was PARTLY a result of this.  Both US and particularly
Australian troops were involved in this.

There were TWO Sandakan "death marches".  The second was a payback for the
first.

After news/rumours of the Malmedy massacre, and other SS atrocities in the
Ardennes, spread, US troops engaged in a number of paybacks.

Not pretty, but apparently true.

Relevance to Traveller:  Atrocities and war crimes breed atrocities and war
crimes.  Mercenary (CT) differentiated between "good wars" and "bad wars". 
This is the difference.

Look, I\'m quite OK about people having the odd rant.  It means that I can
expect a bit of slack when I go off the deep end.

A deal:  If people promise not to do Christmas rants, I won\'t do one on
"Late Roman Paganism and Standard Religious Holidays".

As for Thanksgiving:  a good way to approach it would have been to outline
the true (not sanitised) history of the Mayflower landing, and draw
analogies to Terran settlement of Vilani worlds at the end of the
Interstellar Wars.  There\'s a scenario there:  Plagues, slavery,
hi-jacking, new foodstuffs....

I don\'t see any basis for this assumption.  The various nobles are cloned

Having a large number of embryos will greatly reduce any danger from
inbreeding.  If one woman brings an embryo and her own natural child
to term, those two can later reproduce without any problem at all.

Since you\'re dealing with what I gather is TL9, genetic manipulation
should be available to further minimize dangers of inbreeding, though
you could easily have the genetic experts die in the accident.

Is there some kind of persistent danger from the environment
that requires such a large and continuous population growth?
IMHO, if women are required to birth more than two children,
you need some pressing extermal reason to do so.  Else, the
colony would grow at whatever level is appropriate/natural.

FWIW, fertility rates tend to be high in the face of bad times.
High infant mortality presses cultures to have more babies so
that enough will survive to keep the society viable.  When
the source of that mortality is removed, fertility rates tend to
go down, albeit slowly.  Also, when a society is experiencing
relatively good times (good economy, lots of food, life expectancy
good, etc.), they tend to marry later and don\'t give birth until
later in life, and birth much fewer children.  When times are
rough, people marry younger and have more children earlier.

Given the numbers that some have already posted, I think you
can shoose your population size.  In that amount of time,
I think its reasonable to say that all habitable land might be
occupied to some extent (with population density being centered
upon the initial colony placement and radiating along lines
easy travel and trade - coastlines, rivers, valleys, etc.-- secondary
population centers at geographical desirable locations).

I think the real question is why does the population need to grow
so much for so long?  Especially given the tech level?  Cultural
drive?  Environmental dangers?  Predators?  I think in the absence
of a long-term danger to the population (A Malthusian Death Check),
there is no need to grow the population is such a manner.  Even
religious reasons for doing so would doubtlessly change over the
time period you\'ve outlined.  600 years is a long time.

Fortunately for Admiral Doenitz, Admiral Nimitz (Commander-in-Chief, US
Pacific Fleet) "probably saved the life of Grand-Admiral Karl Doenitz at
the Nuremberg trials by sending a statement to the court confirming that
the Pacific Fleet had waged unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan
from day one of hostilities...."  [van der Vat, _The Pacific Campaign: 
The U.S.-Japanese Naval War 1941-1945_, Simon & Schuster, 1991, pg. 150]

ObTrav:  What impact do any interstellar Conventions Regarding Conduct
of Armed Forces During Time of War have on a commerce raiding strategy? 
After all, in fleet actions, one has an incentive to avoid obliterating
crippled enemy ships.  If one holds the field of battle, the enemy
cripples are valuable both intrinsically and as inteligence sources.  If
one appears unlikely to hold the field, destroying enemy cripples is
more likely to result in atrocities against the ships _you\'ll_ have to
leave behind.  OTOH, commerce raiders have the following limitations:

	1.  They operate behind enemy lines, and thus have less to gain from
sparing enemy cripples.

	2.  Because they are operating behind enemy lines, commerce raiders
must strike and scoot, to avoid being knocked out by enemy escort and
patrol ships.

	3.  They can only succeed in their mission if they prevent cargoes from
reaching their destination.  Unless they have the time to board and loot
their victims, this can only be achieved by destruction of their
targets.

	4.  Since space is even more inhospitable than the ocean (at least the
South Pacific, where survivors were routinely found days after a
sinking), destruction of a ship generally means the death of most, if
not all, of its crew and passengers.

	5.  Commerce raiders may well be privateers, whose status under the Law
of War would have to be clarified.  Regular Navy vessels used as
commerce raiders may have problems if the status of privateers is
different from their own.

Your input is appreciated.

Hmmm...  Actually the true and the sanitized versions of the Mayflower
landing aren\'t extremely different. It\'s what began to happen afterwards
that was the problem, especially around about the time the U.S. government
got all crazy with the "manifest destiny" stuff, well over a century later.

How about you think about what you\'re saying before you presume to tell
those of us in America "what really happened" when you\'re on the other side
of the globe?

Has your government always been kind and beneficial to the aboriginal
peoples of your country? I\'m assuming from your address that you\'re from
Australia, if not I apologize.

What\'s past is past. I don\'t know if anyone else on this list is descended
from American Indian folks, but I know that I chowed down hardcore on turkey
and had a fantastic Thanksgiving here in the U.S., and I read the
Thanksgiving post and found it interesting. However, I\'m not a fan of
Babylon 5, I ignored those posts and moved on. I\'m sure I\'m not the only one
on this list that doesn\'t watch the show. In all reality, B5 has about as
much to do with Traveller as the Thanksgiving post had. You can say, "it\'s
sci-fi" or "well, it\'s kind of like Traveller", but it\'s not Traveller...
NOT TRAVELLER. That\'s it. Period.

So do either one of two things:

1.) Go after all off-topic posts with the same gusto (that is, everything
that is not directly Traveller related; musings on muses, WWII atrocities,
etc.)

2.) Shut up. I rarely say this so bluntly, but I\'m very agitated. Many of
you out there have contributed to off-topic discussions, or started them
yourselves (or turned a legit Traveller discussion "off-course" in another
non-Traveller related direction). Cut others the same slack that they will
(or have already) cut you on the past.

Basically, what I\'m getting at is: if someone is going to express their
silly American holiday greetings in an interesting way, I have no problem
with that. If any of you folks out there from other countries want to post
silly Holiday greetings for any of your holidays that\'s fine too...

When Princess Diana passed away, and some thoughtful American folks
expressed their sympathy to the British folks on the list, there wasn\'t a
string of "that\'s off-topic and doesn\'t belong here" posts following it.

    'topic' => 'SS3 Missiles in HG....  Thoughts (LONG) ',
    'body' => '        So, here is our problem....  If you take a look at the most extreme
example of a missile under the SS3 rules, we see a few things fairly readily:

        O/______________________
        O\\
        TL 11 Star Lance        (Planet-based, Silo-lauched SSTH ("Single
Stage To Hell") 1-shot-ship-wrecker.  When you absolutely, positively gotta
annhiliate the captial ship of that invasion fleet before asking them to
surrender....)
        20G68 Discretionary Burning Motor, Neutrino Homing Guidance, \'Smart\'
Fused , 10Kton yeild Fusion Warhead, 738kg Cr98,247,700
        The TL 11 Star Lance does a minimum of 1000 Hits plus 200 Radiation
Hits on detonation.
        O/______________________
        O\\

        1)  If the Star Lance hits, 1000 hits is extremely overkill vs even
a capital ship.  Even at USP 1.  If you presume that 50% of the 2d+6-6 rolls
will be 7: Fuel -3, you\'ve got a ship that is now Fuel:-1500.  That\'s a kill.
        2)  A fighter *can* carry the Star Lance.  Picture a squadron of 30
fighters each firing these at your TCS.
        3)  Each weapon is USP 1.  Horribly, Horribly Frightening USP 1, but
USP 1, nonetheless.  So, that means that vs a captial ship, with beam
weapons, sand, repulsors and dampners, you\'ve just wasted 30 x MCr90 =
MCr2700, or, say, the purchase price to buy a "Midu Agashaam"-class
destroyer from Supp9.

        4)  That means that you don\'t shoot down fighters with your DD\'s
secondary weapons, you shoot down missiles.  However, that relegates
fighters to the "annoyance" category in warfare, where in RealWorld(tm), a
fighter launching an Exocet (or clone thereof) is a major concern to folks
on things like aircraft carriers.  Even heavy cruisers.  I believe the USS
Iowa is exempt from the effects of anything smaller than Harpoons.

        5)  If you use the optional fighter-salvo rules, that means that you
get a MCr2700 USP 9 salvo from the fighters.  So, that means, vs a fully
stacked and scared-stiff DD (USP 9 everything), we need a 2+ to hit, a 5+ to
pen beam, a 5+ to pen sand, 15+ to pen repulsor, and a 10+ to pen Nuclear
Dampners....  still no threat to the capital ship.
        Remove the repulsors (for whatever reason) and the stat odds of a
hit are ~4%, so 1 shot will hit  out of every 25 salvoes and obliterate the
capital ship, unless they have Armor-20.  Our 25 salvoes cost us about
BCr67.50, or about 20% the cost of a "Tigress" class DD from Supp9;  the
Tigress has Armor-15, meaning our 1000 hits will scour the hull of all
weapons and gut her fuel tanks - a kill.

        6)  On a buck vs buck exchange, how about we attack a "Midu
Agashaam" with our figher squadron...  USP 4 Lasers, USP 3 Sand, USP 4
Dampers.   That is a 2+, 0+, 0+, 5+, giving ~69% hit rate, so it will cost
us MCr3510, on average to obliterate our MCr2700 destroyer.  (BTW, I will
make a point here in a sec, bear with me ;)

        7) So, for *extreme* missile systems, the odds of return on
investment aren\'t great.  Even more "reasonable" weapons like the TL 9
TigerStar (12 hits) I posted @ KCr26 aren\'t all that great.  Vs our Tigress,
best possible damage roll is 2+6+15=23, no effect.  Every less than DD-sized
vessel is going to be panicking about the missile salvo, but your kill ratio
won\'t be hot.
        It will whale the crap out of our "Midu A"; better odds of hitting
since not affected by dampers, but best damage result is 2+6=8, weapon-3.
So, by bell curve, we\'d most likely roll 5 Wpn-2 and 7 Fuel-1;  scour the
weapons off the hull and prevent her from jumping to escape.  Of course,
it\'d only cost us less than MCr1 to disable the "Midu A".

        Conclusions (I told you I\'d get to them ;):
        If you use the SS3 rules for missiles, IMHO you have to do one of
three things:
                1)  Forget you ever thought about using SS3 with HG.
                2)  Accept that nuclear weapons are only cost effective if
fired en-masse against mid-sized targets where the cost of (salvo * inverse
prob of kill) is less than the value of the target.  Non-nuclear weapons are
for trashing small stuff (less than light cruiser) to get it out of the way
quickly, but fighters can deliver these kills *cheaply*.
                3)  Mod the hell out of the missile combat rules as follows:
                        a)  Square root the number of hits delievered, round
normally.  1- = 1.
                                Star Lance is SQRT(1000)=31.6 = 32.
                                TigerStar is SQRT(12)=3.46 = 4.
                        b)  "Top Off" the USP of a single missle.
                                1 Star Lance becomes USP 9, with 24 points
left over.
                                1 TigerStar becomes USP 5, with 0 points
left over.
                        c)  Square root the number of points left over,
round normally.  This is the -DM on the damage effects table.  The missile
will always score one hit on a successful to-hit.
                                1 Star Lance, then would score 1 hit, with a
DM of -5 on the table.  So, best possible roll for this Nuke vs Tigeress
would be 2-6-5+15=6, which is a resounding Manuever-2, and only 1 point
higer than an Internal Explosion result.  Scaaaary stuff for our DD Captain.
                                1 TigerStar would score a total of 1 hit,
with no DM.
                        d)  The net result is that smaller missiles are more
accurate, but no more dangerous, and monster nukes are very accurate and
still fairly damaging but not 1-shot-ship-wreckers normally.  This is in
keeping with the List\'s concensus that direct hits are Bad News while a big
enough pile of TNT even far away will cause anybody grief.  
                        When you add the SS3 rules governing impact speed (1
hit per 30,000km of vector, or each 3G\'s of V) and double-damage for actual
"gosh I hit the hull" results, then I think it works nicely.  It puts bite
back into fighters, validating the idea of Carriers at all.  One fighter
carrying a very affordable TigerStar can take a piece out of a "Mid A"
without flaring it; a 1/2 dozen fighters and our destroyer captain is going
to have to decide how many of his precious beam lasers does he want to use
verses the fighters and how many in reserve vs the missiles they may get to
fire.
                        One fighter or planet-based silo firing a Star Lance
is going to get the attention of every ship driver in the OpFor fleet.  A
carrier launching every fighter it has, armed with Star Lances, is now the
most dangerous ship in the system.  Which means the OpFor DD\'s will need to
have thier own fighter screen to intercept the attacking fighters while they
work the Carrier over.  I.e.:  It will resemble RealWorld(tm) naval
doctrine.  And planetary domination is now not so much a given, with a Star
Lance able to haul out to ~2/3 of a light second in *one* round and can burn
for a total of three rounds.  The planet\'s deep meson sites are still
warming up waiting for the OpFor to get within 50,000km while the Star Lance
silos are vaporizing every support ship and light cruiser in the OpFor fleet.

        Sorry about the length of this post.  I was working it out as I was
typing, so 1/2 that is litterally what I was doing with my LBL\'s and
calculator as I went along.  Comments and "pointing out the obvious that I
missed" remarks are always welcome.  I *think* I\'ll be using option #3 IMTU,
because it gives the "feel" I want;  B5/ Star Wars/ BSG "Fighters Are An Issue".

I\'m well aware of Australian history.  A lot of the massacres weren\'t
actually carried out by the government.  There are no known descendants of
the original owners of the area where my "home town" is located.  It\'s not

        From SS3 (Pullout from JTAS #21):

        "MISSILE STORAGE
     "Each standard missile rack can hold one missile ready to fire and two
additional missiles
    ready for future game turns. The role of the gunner in the turret is to
aim and fire the
    weaponry in the turret; once the missile racks and ready missiles are
exhausted, the gunner
    must reload them with new missiles. A gunner can load new missiles into
the racks and still
    operate the weaponry in a game turn.
     "The standard turret has room to store an additional 12 missiles in it.
Once these missiles
    have been used, the turret must be restocked with missiles carried
elsewhere in the ship
    (usually in the cargo hold).
     "Restocking a turret with missiles is accomplished during the game turn
interphase. If the
    gunner participates in restocking, he may not operate weaponry in the
turret in the next game
    turn. It is possible for non-gunner crewmembers who are not otherwise
engaged to perform
    restocking instead. One person can restock a turret in one game turn."

        Ever wonder what the Marines on board are doing in combat when a
ship is not being boarded?  Humping missiles via cargo dolleys to bays and
turrets to ensure nobody "runs dry"....
        This paragraph has big implications... The gunner fires and slots
the next tube onto the rack... still three tubes on the rack...  Marine
hauls another missile up from the mag....  still 12 missile in the "Ready
Use" hopper....  Missle rack *never* gets caught with a "reload" phase where
it cannot fire.

        This is a point I am trying to work out in my TNEC game...  Remember
that great scene at the end of "The Three Musketeers" where D\'Artagnan gives
Richelu the note saying "The bearer of this note has acted on my behalf for
the good of France -- Richeleu" (or some such)?
        I figure that is *exactly* what commerce raiding is written up like.
Check out the "Serpent" class Attack/Raider on my web page... 0 cargo...  it
*kills* frieghters and escorts...  the crews are operating on behalf of the
Corporate benefactor who is paying them by the ton of flared hull.  When the
crew gets caught (presuming survivors), they are repatirated and the CORP
that hired them is on the hook.  So long as thier actions were within the
contracted orders.
        Now, the Navy views a Privateer as a Pirate with good lawyers...
and treat them appropriately (not many Serpent crews seem to survive loosing
a bad scrap with a UN-DSN/ NSN ship, for some reason).  Now, when things
change in the next year or two of game time and all of a sudden the Terran
Sphere is at war, Privateers going after OpFor shipping are going to be
*helping* the DSN a lot...  And they\'ll be treated appropriately.  
        To the OpFor...  a commerce raider is a commerce raider.  He his
affecting thier strategic ability to conduct warfare, and has to be handled
like a real threat.  Regardless if he is DSN or Terran Merc.

air-to-surface missile), small ships just didnt fight big ships. In
Napoleonic naval warfare, frigates did their thing, and stayed the hell
away from the line of battle.

Now, once the torpedo got invented, you got torpdeo boats, torpedo boat
destroyers to kill them, light cruisers to kill the destroyers,
battlecruisers to kill the light cruisers, and so on.

We are seeing a similar process in modern warfare, except that \'capital\'
ships are using helicopters with small ASMs to deal with gunboats with big
ASMs.

Now, if we invent a torpedo in Traveller, then a similar process will happen.

You will get ships mounting more laser turrets, and you will get more
anti-missile missiles. Rapid-fire laser turrets would also come into vogue
- - check Striker out for a set of rules on rapid-fire lasers.

You will get fighter-destroyers - probably other fighters, carrying small
anti-fighter and anti-missile missiles. Talk to a SFB player who plays
Klingons, and ask them about counter-drone work (SFB missiles arent
ship-killers per se, but big missiles come close).

Cutting EW into the mix probably disadvatages the fighters - a big EW array
on a ship could probably overwhelm the EW resources on a small fighter
(High Guard extroplates EW and sensors into the Computer package).

In short, while I think that missiles are useful for use by and against
auxilaries and civilians, they arent terrifically useful as weapons in the
main line of battle.

Now, if a 1500 dtn ship is a battlewagon, and you are at TL11 and thus dont
have nuke dampers, then a wing of 30 fighters is something to fear. But as
the arms race escalates, and technology refines, then I believe missiles
will become more and more a secondary weapon, no matter how much they hurt
when they hit.

I would class this as slander against Commander Baker-Cresswell, who had
ordered the guns of HMS Bulldog to cease fire. A junior officer continued
to fire a light machinegun, and some of the men followed suit.

But it was in the confusion of a night engagement, and against orders.

The British searched her and found the naval codes (somehow the

>(besides, I still hold a grudge). 

Survivors from U-110 were also taken aboard the Aubrieta and the Broadway.

Again, the story that the British ordered prisoners killed to conceal the
fact the RN had captured a submarine intact is pure slander. Hell, if I
remember reading Churchill\'s letters correctly, he was planning to
commission U-110 into the RN with as much publicity as possible !

The British had been cracking Enigma for a while (the Poles started it, and
had passed a reconstructed machine along in \'39). The codes helped, but it
was the techniques and machines developed at Bletchley Park and elsewhere
that were the real key - the keys captured on the weather ship Munchen and
the U-110 degraded over time, but the techniques developed allowed the
later 4-rotor Enigma machine to be cracked.

In short, I would recommed Kahn\'s book \'Seizing the Enigma\' (Arrow, 1991).

[An example of a specific route, chosen to exagerate the
difference between jump-6 and jump-4, deleted.  Effate is
exactly jump-6 from Regina and the Xboat isn\'t efficiently
routed between them.  If you are going to postule a general
jump-6 system of courier that shadows the X-boats, you are
going to have to make the same compromises about crossing
distance, vs hitting intermediate stops, etc.]

On average, jump-6 will save 33% over jump 4.  It will this mean
basically duplicating the cost of the X-boat network and more
(the cost of J6 boats vs J4).  I don\'t think any corp is going
to want messages a bit faster that bad.  Instead, I can see
that the corps that are big enough, have a few jump-6 courier
in key places to take the really important messages, and little
more.

Actually in MT there was definite info about cloning times.  This was
discussed in detail by Digest Group in TD #12 & 14and in less detail in
GDW\'s MT Referee\'s Companion. 

Cloning a person (or animal) is TL 9
10x Growth Quickening (ie 0-18 in 1.8 years) is TL 10
x50 Growth Quickening is TL 12
x100 Growth quickening is TL 13
Cloning individual body parts (a new eye, arm, leg, spleen) 
is also TL 13, and growth quickening can be used on them too.
(the adult parts are then surgically attached).

On a related note:

Regrowing body parts by stimulating the body to regrow a new arm, eye...
is TL 9, but it takes months to years (depending on the size of the new
part).  10x growth quickening speeds this (3 weeks for a eye to 3 months
for a new leg, but using any of the more rapid forms of growth quickening
requires that the patient be on full life support for the duration (then
again they can grow you a new leg in a week at TL 13).

  Interestingly, the British legal system came fairly close to formulating
a doctrine this past week that may have meant that Doenitz (as Hitlers
successor as head of state) wouldn\'t have been liable to be held responsible
for any of his actions (well, responsible, but not answerable to any foreign
legal sanction).

  Wouldn\'t that tick off your typical Trav gang of terrorists, er, PC\'s,
sent to off some ex-dictator enjoying his ill-gotten gains, only to find
that the Imperial authorities consider him to be an all-round swell guy
and deserving of wall to wall security?

  The above is probably an over-simplification specific to the last
century or two. In typical pre-industrial agricultural societies
"good times" leads to population growth, and this trend seems to 
carry over into early industrial societies. In subsistence or small-
holding agriculture (e.g. early modern France) it\'s due to lack of
economic opportunity that marriage (and thus child-bearing*) is delayed.

 * well, except in places like Brittany, or so I understand :)

  High mortality necessitates high fertility, but the rest gets
awfully complicated.

Turkeys, being bipedal, would use bipedal walkers, whouldn\'t they?  Not 
tripods, right?

Kinda reminds me about that post earlier this summer about a planetary Navy

out the skipped boats as star mercs to support the Government in Exile, who

Well, not neccessarily on topic,

I\'m using the whole concept of Babylon 5, "the last great hope for
mankind"  for the Mage game I\'m running.

The players have started a Covenant where Fae, Garou, Nunnehi,
Tradition Mages, Void Engineers,  Templars, and Orphans and normal
humans are all welcomed, and where they are standing against the
rest of the Technocracy, the Inquisitiion, and the Kindred

They were all  united by a particulalry nasty Progenitor experiment
they discovered
in a research base on Io, which finally swung the VE onto the
Tradition side.

The end of the Shadow War. Let\'s talk about it and realise how bad we\'ve been.

At least they didn\'t reboot the universe afterwards to remove the new
technology / paradox / canon-shattering scenario, like they do in virtually
every Trek episode.

I didn\'t see that at all.  What I saw was, everybody getting together & saying 
\'We ain\'t gonna play your little reindeer games no more, so get out.\'   They 
didn\'t sit down and talk it out and realise how bad they\'d been, they flat out 
refused to be part of the First Ones\' politico-religious arguments anymore.  
The Shadow Wars were all about ideology:  order vs evolution.  The Vorlons 
were like our parents, in that they laid down a bunch of rules & demanded 
everybody follow them without question, without knowing why.  The Shadows were 
the ultimate Darwinians, in that they knew evolution would happen no matter 
what, and that it ain\'t a kindness to hang a man slowly.  They knew that some 
would live and some would die, and the best and fastest way to get the needed 
result was to stir up the anthill and let the chips fall where they may.

Now I still don\'t see where they ripped off a Trek episode to make this one.  
But if you CAN figger it out, clue me in on which one they ripped off.

That\'s cause B5 ain\'t Trek.  And thank Alla\'h it ain\'t!  When somebody gets
hurt, they carry the bruises around for a couple days or weeks  (hell, Ivanova
had to walk with a cane for 2 episodes cause of an accident in shooting once
that cracked her ankle.  They wrote it into the script.).  No instant medical
cures.  No \'physics as wishful thinking particle of the week\'.  Just good story
lines.  Definitely a refreshing change from the \'nail it with the latest
particle of the week\' routine in the current Trek series.  Methinks Gene is
spinning at Warp 9 in his grave...

I\'d have a simple *mechanical* interlock on that handwheel. If there\'s
a substantial pressure difference, the wheel won\'t turn until you open
up the panel and flip a lever to disengage the interlock. That keeps
idiot passengers from killing themselves and others.

Hell, last month I was with a couple of friends at a gun shop. One of
my friends wanted to buy a pistol. One clerk was futzing around with
*something* on a pistol and in the process, waving the brreal thru an
arc in a plane that intersect our heads and those of other patrons. One
of us finaly commented *loudly* "Would you watch where you point the

That\'s because they *set up* those religions! That was obvious in the

It was in one of the CT supplements. And there were even message forms
and a "grid" you filled in to send images. The prices *were* a bit out
of line, though. The price for the "image" was higher than for the
message, but the message would have taken *more* storage, even assuming
that they were both stored uncompressed.

Nope. You see, e-mail is essentially *free*. So these things keep
going. But increase the price to that of *postal* mail, and the number
of such things drops greatly. And in the case of chain letters and
other "pass it along" schemes, the chain breaks far more often.

I think that electronically stored data sent via the X-boat service is
probably cheap. But not *execessively* cheap. Again consider it to be
equivalent to *international* postal rates.

More to the point, it\'s *highly* impractical to get accurate address
lists via the x-boat network. Thus you *can\'t* do random "mail bombing"
runs. 

Mail sent to a non-existent destination address may get bounced back.
But being e-text, there\'s no need to return the whole message. A simple
identifier will do.

Two possibilities. That\'s what would have happened if Sheridan *hadn\'t*
gone forward. 

Or, also quite possibly, it *did* happen (I haven\'t seen all of season
5, so forgive me if something makes this impossible). That\'s *when*
Londo and G\'Kar die and Vir winds up as Emperor. There was no need to
show it again. Remember, that was around *18* years in the future. Thus
it may have happened between the second to the last episode and the
last one.

But the two listings posted so far show that Spanish is right up there
with English. Latin America contains a lot of people. And Brazil
*alone* contains a huge number of Portugese speakers. And then there\'s
Russian... 

Europe *did* conquer a lot of the world. 

But I agree that *if* it\'s cheap to establish colonies, a lot of the
third world countries *will* create colonies. Just realize that such
colonies will *not* have any appreciable effect on the population of
the country. 

The one *possible* way of having an effect is to have draconian birth
control *and* "export" the folks who won\'t go along with it (or at
least the most vocal ones). 

BTW, given the tendency for groups who are "different", especially
idealistic or religious groups, to want their own "place", I expect
some *strange* colonies out there.

A couple of examples:

A colony founded by over the top Star Trek Fans. They\'ve decided to
"recreate" Kilingon society. Klingon was the language they started out
with. And it\'s grown since then. 

A colony founded by some idealists off one sort or another, most likely
"low tech"/"appropriate tech" folks. They decided to make Tolkien\'s
Sindarin (Elvish) their language.

Other "artifical" languages may wind up as living languages on some
colony. 

Those first two ought to make for some *surprised* players.

If we extrapolate this to TL 15, we get:

x500 Growth Quickening at TL 14 (0-18 years in 13.14 days)
x1000 Growth Quickening at TL 15 (0-18 years in 6.57 days)

Therefore:

Frank N. Furter was using TL 15 technology ("In just seven days, I can
make you a man!").

QED.

Damn.  I forgot about them.  They\'d be handy to have around in case you got 
boarded.  Even better than tribbles.  <grin>  Just throw the packet down the

HIWG.

The HIWG files have the advantage that all the worlds are named, which allows
me to save my energy for something else. The HIWG files have also been modified
in other ways, one of which makes me wonder...

As a footnote in the file says:

"Clayton R. Bush

     Size VI stars changed to size V, per TNE errata."

This is also exactly what has happened. However, as I don\'t have the TNE
errata, I\'m wondering what the rationale for this is? What\'s wrong with size
VI stars? They can be found in CT and MT \'canon\' - are they suddenly not a part
of the Traveller universe anymore?

Could someone please enlighten me?

I think the zhos know about the Black Globe in much the same way the Iraqi
army has data on the effectiveness of the US Military.. they\'ve seen it in
battle.  I wouldn\'t be surprised if the Zhos have a few generators of their
own and are working to replicate them for themselves.

IMTU, Naval Intellegence is a shadowy and very deadly organization.  They
will kill to protect the Emperor\'s secrets.

Size VI stars aren\'t really part of the *universe* anymore.. Seems they got
reclassified out of existance.. Bruce could probably tell you more.

Andy cut the numbers of the women down to 15-20 (fertile ones, others lost
their fertility?) and then using your embryo solution would make sense when
they first start repopulating.  Might make a good lead off.

Gas powered air-raft (TL10)
Designed by Bruce Johnson

This vehicle was designed using the rules in the Central Supply Catalog.

Summary:
     1.00 displacement ton open-topped slab streamlined;  4.01 tonnes;  kCr 34.9
Chassis:
     14.0 kL open-topped slab streamlined (8.2 m long x 2.4 m wide x 74 cm
high);

Well, the planet it colonizes is located in an area of space that is in the
middle of interstellar conflict - the K\'Kree are invading (This sector is
immediately next to the 2000 worlds). The numerous pocket empires of the
area are holding off the centaurs - in fact, they\'ve banded together in a
pseudo-alliance called the Community. And dropped into the middle of this
mix is a small band of TL9 humans. Not good for the humans.

They ally themselves with a nearby alien government which assists the
humans with a technological uplift program. But if war is going to be
coming to them, they need to be ready - and that means warm bodies are
needed, unfortunately.

This is the rough outline - there are many more details. Eventually, the
humans come to colonize four worlds (five, actually, but the fifth world is
inhabited by people exiled from the original colonies) and are one of the
major pocket empires trying to stem the K\'Kree advance.

More details to follow, once the writeup is finished. Again, feel free to
slam/comment away.

A general point about canon dogmatism that I was going to make anyway: 
Just because a technology hasn\'t been mentioned doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t
exist!

IMTU, I\'m very conservative about the technologies I allow.  I\'m a Little
Black Book player at heart.  I\'ve got a lot of stuff from later editions,
which is why I can quote them, but I\'m usually doing it from memory, and
can be wrong.  Most of my books are in storage at my parents\' place in
Toowoomba, 80 miles from Brisbane, where I live.  I don\'t have everything
from any edition, let alone from all of them.

John\'s points are probably correct.

And then again, they may not. I know which possibility I consider the most

Of course you\'re not. If you were, I don\'t suppose you\'d be arguing about

Sure you can. And it won\'t make more than a week or two\'s difference at the
most. Because there are one set of systems that a Naval courier network
would automatically touch: those containing a fleet HQ. And as there are
at least one fleet HQ in each subsector, and since most, if not all, of
those would be located in the system with the subsector capital, an IN
courier network automatically mirror the needs of the Imperial Bureaucracy.
So you get priority mail delivered from Core to Mora at somewhere between
5 and 6 parsecs per week instead of the X-boat rate of 2.6 parsecs per week
(which, incidentally is an improvement of over 100% and not the 33% you\'ve
been claiming).

Now, any world without a naval base will need to get its messages forwarded
by X-boat for the single leg (possibly two legs) that the IN couriers don\'t
cover (assuming for purposes of argument that the IN isn\'t required by the
Emperor to provide the last leg after all). This will delay the messages
another week or two. But the real time loss lies in the stretch from the
core to the frontier, and that has been handled by the couriers.

Information lag is one of the biggest problems any navy has in a Traveller
universe. An Imperium where each fleet does not have sufficient couriers
to keep in regular touch with each component part and all its neighboring
fleets is IMO far more implausible than... well, I can\'t really come up
with an example that is sufficiently implausible to make my point. I\'d
willingly accept a fleet that has daily couriers and would scorn any that
didn\'t have at least a weekly courier (I\'d consider something in between
those two figure to be the most likely).
 
>Such a system will be in no way sufficient to carry messages on
>an X-boat kind of level.

Yes it would. And even if it wouldn\'t, a simple priority scheme would allow
the important messages to go by Navy courier and the bumpf to go by X-boat.

The crucial point in this discussion appears to be just how much contact
there is between individual fleets and between the Admiralty and sector
HQs. How many couriers do you think each fleet would have? I\'m not asking
you for a definitive canon answer, just what _you_ think is plausible.
How often does fleet admirals in YTU hear from the Admiralty and vice versa?

Interestingly (not wanting to get into the morals of the situation): I can
recall several incidents when British troops serving in Northern Ireland
have been convicted of murder or manslaughter in UK civil courts but have
not been dishonourably discharged. This is usually when the rules of
engagement were being followed by the troops; however, following them isn\'t
a defence in civil law. In the cases I recall, on release (which was
usually in a few years) the soldiers involved returned to the Army and
we\'ren\'t looked down/punished for their actions.

I also seem to recall that US troops in the UK were subject to different
rules and effectively exempt from UK civil law. The US could ship them
straight back home instead because of treaty agreements. I can remember
this happening after an assault of some sort.

ObTrav: Would there be incidents when Imperial troops were convicted by
system courts but the Imperium could ignore the situation?

Obvious case would be when the troops were tried and convicted of blasphemy or
other religious crime on a religious dictatorship world.  Since freedom of (and
*FROM*) religion is an Imperial \'gimme\', expect the Impies to pull their guys
out of hock before they serve more than a night in jail.

Of course that last "if" is a big one.  If you are likely to

there is an issue that in many cases you will be more

But for many messages going jump -6 (and the basis for intermediate
stops), a few weeks difference is exactly all you are saving.  If
it is important enough to set up a jump-6 system, then it will
important in routing....

I\'ve been claiming 33% because that is what setting up a jump-6 system
with the same kind of service the X-boats provide, will give you.

Dedicated couriers (if you have enough of them so that you can
pass messages on rather than have to go into the port to refuel)
will beat and X-boat kind of system (a jump-4 courier can beat
the X-boat system).  But this is expensive (you have to have
courier ships sitting around at each world on an optimum path
between the two systems involved and not pick up mail at
intermediate stops.)  (You can mitigate the is if you swallow
the lost in time it take to refuel and send one ship, but you
still have to take the optimum route and if you are going to
use this for routine traffic, then you still need to have them
go frequently and you still need a lot of them).  Since you are only
make stops at the world that happen to lie along the optimum path, it
isn\'t that useful for messages from the important worlds the
lie along the path.

There may be J-6 couriers between the Capital and Mora.  However,
the routine traffic of the Navy (assignments, standard orders, etc.)
are going to go at X-boat speeds just fine.  My guess is they
probably have one or two sitting around for emergency transmitions.
I don\'t think they are sending every smuggling advisory out
on a jump-6 courier.

I can see this happening, since to a merc commander, his \'business\' is his men 
and their equipment.  Both represent a considerable investment in time and 
money, so the commander is going to want to get back to full strength as soon 
as possible after a ticket is done.  And if recruiting from his recently 
defeated enemy just happens, well, so be it.  <grin>

I can see this too.  And IIRC, the bond *is* made out to \'bearer\'.  But, also, 
IIRC, if the mercs *win*, they don\'t *NEED* the repatriation bond, since their 
employers pay their way out again.  Repatriation bonds are used by the 
*losing* merc unit.

Email requires *storage*.  This isn\'t free.  It\'s paid for.  My account here, 
for instance, lets me use up to a megabyte in disc quota, *including* email, 
so I\'ve been making sure I can keep my web space down to allow for more email.

You still have to *store* the messages.  This takes up space in some data 
storage device.  No matter how cheap the storage devices are, they\'re still 
not free.  And they\'re finite, as well.  On a high traffic world, I\'d expect 
to see 2 or 3 xboats working out of there just to handle the governmental 
xmail & diplomatic stuff.

Even the header & identifier still take up space in the storage device.  Not as
much as the message itself, mind you, but it *will* take up *some* room...

 You are referring to Eck of U-852, but Donitz\' instruction 154, written in
 November 1939, ordered crews to \'Rescue no one and take no-one with you.
 Have no care for the ships boats\'.  >>

	I believe the "official" reason he was tried and executed was that he did
actually surface and machine-gun the survivors...simply leaving them to fend
for themselves would have been hard to prosecute as a war crime, even though
they would likely have died (on the Russian convoys, orders were routinely
issued that no one was to attempt to pick up thier OWN survivors...too
dangerous to the rescue ships).

	The point I actually intended to make related to the original post, which was
about disabled warships and survivors, is that the attitudes of the forces
involved make a large difference.  The war between Japan and the US was a
bitter one...one in which no quarter was asked or given.  The US Navy and the
RN did not show the same hatred to the Nazis, who also (in general) did not go
out of thier way to exterminate people on the high seas.

	In Trav terms...in a war (5FFW, for instance) the general professionalism of
both sides would prevail (the stars are the common foe of all men), but in a
very vicious war (the Rebellion, forex)  I could see no mercy at all given (if
this isn\'t canonical, maybe it should be...esp. for Lucan\'s faction)

Yes, it was an oversimplification.  Its been years since I\'ve dabbled in
Malthus, empirical analysis of historical population growth trends, etc.,
etc., I was just trying to give the highlights.  I should have stressed that
_sustained_ good times, i.e., over several generations, _seem_ to lead
to higher marrying age, fewer children later in life, etc.  This is observed
in the industrialized countries.  Certainly there are a great many other
factors and we only have one place to examine data from, but the trend
is increasingly evident.

>  * well, except in places like Brittany, or so I understand :)

I think you last point here about economic opportunity is correct,
now that I think about it.  IIRC, it was life expectancy that was
the most important among several factors (although not dramatically
more important) that pointed to younger marrying ages and younger
child bearing.

Well, if you weave the dental floss into a sturdy belt from the motor to

Internal Combustion Petrol Engines CAN be used to (just barely) power a
very very marginal grav vehicle by at least some of the design sequences.

        Hi, Dusty!
        Actually, there is direct cannon ref in SS3 that missiles of >50kg
can only be fired from High Guard bays.  I believe I posted the quote in a
previous message.  The point of my entire post was that *if* you run HG for
space combat, then these are issues to deal with if you want to encorporate
SS3.  I am aware that the original concept of SS3 was for Book2/CT only.

Depends what your tech level and infrastructure is. I would estimate the
number of cloning tanks you have * how many clones/year one can make * 600
years. In the billions, easily. Frankly, I think the limiting factor is how
quickly you can educate, support, and provide livelihoods for new citizens.

At high tech levels, I\'d say zero population; you can geneer as many
genetically distinct individuals you want from a single sample.

David, I picked Regina subsector becuase it is one of the traditional and
best known places in the Imperium. Trin to Robin to Glisten is two jump-6s,
then we pass the baton onto a jump-5 craft who does the Glisten-Tirem leg,
and then a jump-6 boat to Persephone, and then another jump-6 boat to Lunion.

Now, we need to link up Trin to Mora (Trin-Katarulu by jump-5, then to
Maitz by jump-6, then it\'s either a jump-4 hop to Mora, or swing across to
Strouden at jump-6, then a jump-4 hop to Lunion). The Mora-Lunion Express
goes at jump-5 via Mercury, while the Mora-Glisten route goes
Mora-Maitz-Tussinian-Ffudn-Glisten.

We have now connected the biggest and most important worlds in the Spinward
Marches, at speeds that make the Xboat system look like the obsolete
jury-rig that it is.

I\'d put jump-6 at more like 50-100% more than jump-4, and worth every penny.

As an example, as a thought-example, let us assume that we are stockbroking
firms about the size of JP Morgan is at the moment. You have three week old
data, while I shelled out my hundred million a year for a share in Xpress
Routing, and thus have two week old data.

What customer in their right mind would come to you for advice ? What scams
couldnt my firm run on your firm ?

Now, under FFS2, a 200 dton jump-6 Fast Courier costs about MCr 150, and
pulls 5 gees (you have to use all that power for *something*).


>Instead, I can see
>that the corps that are big enough, have a few jump-6 courier

As far as I can see, economics will not limit traffic to jump-4, and there
is always the Vargr option is the Imperial government tries to ban jump-6
vessels (route your jump-6 Fast Couriers thru the Vargr Extents).

Now, jumpspace physics might, if we assume misjump chances rise to about 3%
per jump for jump-5, and 5% per jump for jump-6.

This will make military use of jump-6 for raids still possible, but will
pretty much knock out the commercial market.

IMTU, most of it!  You see, if you read all the canon material with a
careful and very very cynical eye, you start to see the blind spots and
biases where scenarios lurk.

Non Imperial example:
If you take a look at the various library data entries on the Terran
Confederation, you will see a little passing comment that the UN becomes a
true world government in the three decades after First Contact.  Now think
about that.  Sure, the Vilani are a unifying threat, but putting every
single stupid little country on Earth into any kind of coherent government
in a mere three decades isn\'t something that would have just happened.

What\'s hiding in here?  Could there have been a Bismarck figure, pulling
some kind of "blood and iron" stunt during this period?  Maybe, maybe not. 
Whatever is interesting.  It\'s a safe bet some kind of intrigues were going
on, and it\'s things like this that get PCs killed...  Would the Imperium
have an interest in "ignoring" the details of how one of its heroic and
noble predecessors was formed?  Maybe.

The whole Imperial History we have is painted with a very broad brush, with
very little detail.  That is often a good way of producing propoganda - you
don\'t dispute the facts, you merely gloss over the ones that are
inconvenient.

        Well, Ian....  I don\'t think it flies on (250Cr + 500Cr/parsec) /
ton.  If the FrieghtRon is going to be able to defend itself (its a massive
convoy, really, complete with own escorts) there is too much money tied up
in hull costs that doesn\'t actually haul cargo.
        It\'s *damn* impressive, mind you.  You can virtually guarantee that
nothing short of an actual Naval fleet is going to prevent you from
delievering your cargo...  The Megalodon\'s own armaments would scare the
crap out of most destroyers, let alone those evil little Barracudas (can you
imagine being the Pirate captain seeing 20 of those heading his way?).
        Maybe that is where the money is.  The "risk" premiums thing
again.... You can charge 3 - 5 times the Cr for a given range, just because
it WILL get there.  In one haul, maximum load, the FreightRon can move 2500
times the cargo of a 20th Century "Panamax" G3 Cargo carrier....  or say,
the GNP of the US in one load.
        Of course, that makes the FrieghtRon a "Core" area vessel only.  At
a plodding jump one, you need lots of Hi-Pop Ind worlds packed close
together that need megatons of material per year moved safely.  Also, given
the total value of the cargo she\'d be carrying, the Zho might be willing to
send a CruRon after one near the border...  Bankrupt planet, anyone?
        I dunno.  I am not convinced its viable.  Even if you strip her
protection.  Your thoughts?

a.k.a. the Professional Soldier\'s Code of Conduct.  One can get
an idea of some of what the MC/PSCC says from the references to
it; for example, one article prohibits the killing of POWs or
innocent civilians, another allows summary execution of soldiers
who fail to obey orders, and so on.  It also appears to grant
certain rights, such as for the line troops to vote on and demand
that the officers lead them in a certain action.

Would such a PSCC actually exist IaTU?  If so, can we work up the

Regardless why you picked it, the question of its representativeness

Well, the question is why?  Because you think there will be some
sort of extra efficiency in how intermediate stops will be placed?
There is no reason why jump-6 routes would be more efficient.
If the X-boat network has a route which isn\'t efficient for
jump-4, why is that and why would it not apply to a jump-6
network.  (if politics prevented
optimal X-boat routing, the same forces would be at work
on jump-6 routes).

Repatriation bonds are a common part of any off-world contract, there
to provide an assurance that the bearer will have transportation to some
destination at the end of a work contract - this to keep some ethically
challenged employer from marooning workers at a job site when they\'ve
completed their assignments. Without such bonds, it would be very
difficult to get off-world talent to help out on all manner of projects,
from suppressing a rebellion to building a new hydroelectric plant.

A colony world might willingly pay to have dangerous mercenaries
go away - but think how much a qualified engineer is worth to a new
colony. It might be very tempting to "encourage" him to stay, say
with a carefully arranged criminal entrapment + fine to make him too
poor to afford a ticket home. "So sorry chap, guess you\'re stuck here
until you can earn another KCr20. Tell you what, I\'ve got this pumping
station that needs designing, I\'ll give you Cr50 for the work..."

In the case I was talking about, the merc company in question doesn\'t
have their own interstellar transport and so are cashing in their bonds
to get off-planet. They are leaving as a group, new recruits and all,
and basically challenging the local government to complain about it.

I\'m not so sure.  That could allow Imperial personnel to skirt nearly *any*
law on any planet w/ a theocratic type govt (which can fit w/ a whole lot of
UWP govts... not just D and E).  I like the idea that any crime against a
memberworld led to a trial in an Imperial court (or magistrate, whatever).  If
that Imperial judiciary judges the crime frivolous or some such (or due to
corruption/bribery/etc), then the suspect is freed, possibly damaging
relations w/ the memberworld.  If the Imperial judiciary judges the crime to
be w/ merit (also possibly due to corrpution/bribery/etc), then the suspect
might well experience a gulag or burning at the stake (if a capital crime),
whatever.

I also like the idea that the local Imperial noble is the representative and
judge of law... (A duke saying something like... "In the name of the Emperor,
and the Archduke and the (Sector) Duke, I give you the power to dispense
justice and the right to bear nukes..." etc). Gives them barons and baronets
(and maybe knights) something... fuedal\'esque... to do (and something to do
period).

I read the digest too.  I used to read the www pages when they existed... any
chance of these coming back Mr. Miracle?  

I skip over lots of off-topic garbage (and alot of on-topic info, too), if the

that in there.  The response to the original just seemed like so much
trolling... Traveller is a game written primarily by Americans, primarily for
American consumers.  Give a note on some holiday in your country and you\'re
not likely to be the recipient of such a troll, if there\'s any mention of it
at all.  If anything, I might be interested in inserting it somewhere in the
New Era.

Ob Trav, Pre-collapse, of course, did the Solomani ever strenuously object to
the presence of the mention of the root of Imperial holidays?  Would SolSec
have arranged a flaming of the mention as irrelevant to the Confederation?
How bout the Vilani to Terran/Solomani holidays in the 3I?

 IMTU, both Christianity and Judaism rejoin with their brothers in Islam. (The

this was the more I studied the more I leaned toward Islam, and/or Orthodox
Chistianity). I have the more extreme sects making up some of the more vocal

Most of it.  It would be almost foolish to believe otherwise.  I\'m sure that
the Office of Calender Compliance goes over all of the historical media in
order to make sure it\'s in line with certain standards.  The Calendar
Compliance guys are extremely scary if you take a good, long look at them...

Anyway, I\'m sure that Imperial children are taught how Cleon built an empire
from chaos through feats of heroism...  While in reality, the 3I was built
for purely economic reasons. The 3I actually tried to start wars on many
planets in order to make them better customers.  They stepped in with
military force when planets couldn\'t be swayed by other means...

I\'m sure that\'s not the way it\'s printed in "The History of the Third
Imperium, 223rd ed. revised".

In "The Kinunir" we have Imperial forces who take political prisoners and
routinely torture them. Ine Giver died after being tortured in Imperial
custody.

I\'m sure that the Imperium has looked the other way a number of times for
the megacorps, for profitable member worlds...

"What, that Droyne colony refuses to move from that ore-rich mountain
range?"

The 3I are not a bunch of nice guys. At times, some leaders might do good
things. It doesn\'t mean that the Imperium won\'t rewrite history to cover its
own ass.

    'body' => 'I have been thinking about the discrepancy between the possibility of
J-6 information dissemination and the Imperiums\'s use of the J-4 (and
inefficently laid out) X boat network.

It occured to me that at some point in the past the Imperium was not
capable of J-6 and at some point farther in the past was not capable of
J-5.  Therefore at some time in the past Imperial officials were getting
their urgent information by J-4 fast courier while the "commoners" were
getting their information by the (also Jump 4) X boat network.  Let\'s
take a look at what happened then.

"The express boat (abreviated Xboat) system, established origionally in
624 and expanded to cover the entire Imperium by 718". (MT ImpEnc p 24)

"Tech Level Notes	The Third Imperium

	Year	TL	Jump Capability (added for clarity)
	300	13	4
	700	14	5
       1000	15	6
(MT RefComp p34)

Therefore we know that when the establishment of the Xboat network began
in 624 the Imperium was not capable of anything better than Jump 4, they
apparently built the Xboat network to as high a capability as they
could. (I note that it\'s construction was ordered by Arbellatra who
certainally would have experienced problems with communication lags when
she was leading Imperial forces in the Second Frontier War and later as
she ended the Civil War).

The Imperium progressed to TL 14 (and Jump 5) around 700, before the
Xboat network was complete in 718.  Therefore at the time of its
completion the Xboat network was already "obsolete".  Let us take a look
at what happened in the Imperium between 718 and 1000 (when TL 15 and
Jump 6 were developed and the elite could now use J6 communications).

We know that during this period the Imperium was turning inward. "With
the end of the antebellum [ending 604] period the Imperium turned more
attention inward and devoted resources to internal development
[including x boat netwoks] and consolidation." (MT ImpEnc p 18).  We
know that the Imperium averted (or at least theat they believe they
averted) a war with the Zhodani that was to take place circa 810 or 820
by suppressing the Psionics Institutes who were (purportedly) heavily
Zhodhani influenced. (MT ImpEnc pg 50).  We know that the Psionics
Suppressions went far farther than the Imperium thought they would and
created such a strong public distaste for Psionics that Imperial use of
Psionics for Intelligence purposes was hindered (op cit).  We know that
the Psionics Suppressions were the result of a (overly successful)
Psychohistory project. (op cit)

We know that the Third Frontier War (979 to 986) occured during this
period.  We know that the Imperium did so poorly in this war that the
Emperor Styryx _resigned_ [or possibly "resigned"].  Stryx was the first
Emperor to resign in 900 years [Since Cleon II in 54.]  While Emperor\'s
had been killed since then none had resigned.  What does it say about
the Imperium then that an Emperor resigned?  This war tired the Imperium
out & made the Solomani War more difficult  "Exhausted, however, by the
Third Frontier War the Imperium was unable to complete the process." [CT
Sup 8 p 39]


 We know that during this period a large chunk of the Imperium, The
Solomani Autonomous Region, was given control a great deal of freedom
"...broad powers of authority.  For two hundred years the Imperium
effectively ignored the region and concentrated instead on its coreward
frontiers."  (MT ImpEnc p 37).  We know that this did not turn out well
and that the regions charter was revoked.  We know that the Sphere
resisted reintegration into the Imperium and that the Solomani Rim War
(990 - 1002) began.  At the very end of this war the Imperium reached Tl
15 (and Jump 6).  We know that this war was eventually "won" by the
Imperium at a high cost and with their origional goal of reintegrating
the entire sphere into the Imperimum not attained.  In fact only 25% of
the Sphere was reintegrated. [CT Sup8 p39]

All this evidence suggests that the period 700 to 1,000 was a bad time
for the Imperium.  It suggests that the Imperial government had a hard
time controlling the Imperial people.  During this period the Imperium
lost whole Sectors to the Solomani, was exhausted by a war with the
(technologically inferior) Zhodani, and lost control over its own anti
Psionics campaigns.

Is it possible that some of the reason why the Imperium was so shaky
during this period the fact that the elite (with Jump5 communications)
did not have enough lead time on the Jump4 communications the
"commoners" enjoyed to be able to control their society.

Is it possible that maybe the invention of the Jump6 drive was greated
with a "Thank [insert dieties name here] now we will have twice as much
advance notice of the "news" and can finally _do_ something?

Is it possible that in the next 100 years or so the efforts of the
elites to "do something" are what created the social climate in which
the Rebellion could occur?

Comments are welcomed.  The title for this post was, of course, lifted
from Gibbon.

The Law Lords ruled he is liable to extradition. However, the final
decision rests with the Home Secretary (a politician) who is taking
submissions at the moment until Monday and will decide whether Pinochet

If you land an Outpost in a primary system, am I correct in thinking that
it only becomes a full \'world\' counter after 5 turns of peace? The rules
don\'t seem to state this implicitly, but hint at it in the \'peace time\'
rules.

(It\'s strange - having been played Imperium recently, I started to re-read
FFW (partly because I was looking at IS the other day) and started to think
\'how complicated\' compared to Imperium. I don\'t think it is really, but :-(
How long does the average game of FFW take? I\'m curious as I thought
Imperium would be faster than it was (it took most of an afternoon to fight
4 turns + 6 peace turns) and it involves getting the other players over
here to have a go.)

Well Chaucer is still readable (just), now if you had said Beowulf.
Anyway I believe languages are not evolving so fast because there
are books, radio and even TV reinforcing and spreading current
usage.  What I believe we will see is a lot of pidgin languages.

Looking at the european languages we have a very interesting picture.
We have English, Spanish, French, Portugese and German as important
languages.  Can all these survive as major world languages, considering
that the EU will tend to pull closer together over the next 50 years,
maybe resulting in a United States of Europe.

Some points to note 
Even in some Francophone African countries, English is used for large 
scale commerce as well as for diplomacy.
French is the main foreign language that is taught in British schools.

This means a very precarious position for French.  Which will seem to
indicate that it will drop out of being a major language.  I believe
a Spanish/Portugese hybrid may result over the long run.  English will
obviously survive as it is the language of two of the G5 nations, plus
spoken widely in the Commonwealth.  German is in even worse shape than
French, apart from the native speakers (which being in Northern Europe
are in countries with stable population) I cannot see the language
increasing its share of the world\'s total.

If I had to pick 4 languages at the moment it would have to be English,
Spanish, Arabic and Cantonese.  Yes I do know about the languages spoken
on the subcontinent, and have worked with many Indians.  They have
indicated that for high tech ventures (they were computer programmers)
English is at least as prevalent as Hindi, Urdu and Bengali.

I hope I haven\'t beaten up too much on your language, all of the above
should be read as IMHO and YMMV.

Actually, you also have to look at the difference between urban and rural
birth rates. On the farm kids are and economic asset, in town (especially
with child labour laws) they are an economic burden. Historically, urban
population growth is driven by immigration from the country.  

Was just reading (in either the Manchester Guardian or Scientific
American) that Bangladesh has seen a really significant drop in birth
rate, which seems attributable directly to teaching women that they don\'t
_have_ to have babies. At least, there haven\'t been significant economic
changes during the 15 years that the rate has dropped.

A really good source for population modelling is "How to Build a Future"

A while back my players formed a mercenary team. They only did it with
the purpose of getting exotic weaponry, but I gave them a copy of a
document I cobbled together called "So You\'re Running A Mercenary
Outfit". IMTU, it\'s published by the Imperial Association of
Professional Combatants", a.k.a. the Merc Guild.

I put it together out of a few posts I\'d seen on the TML regarding
mercenary conduct.

If anyone wants a copy, let me know. It\'s in Word format.

It\'s not that hard to visualize. Take four worlds, each connected with two
others but not all the same number of jumps apart. Send a message from one,
have it rebroadcast to all neighbors (except the originating world) and
watch the duplicates appear. Add another world connected to any two of the
first four, and let one of the worlds modify the message, and now watch
overlapping duplicates of the original and modified message appear.

   You aren\'t going to add a ship to a watch list the first time you see a
discrepancy between what it was carrying and what it should have been
carrying appears, are you? If you do that, before long every ship in space
is going to be on somebody\'s watch list from human error alone.
   If you have to wait until you have responses to requests for 
information from other worlds, the delay stretches by at least 2 weeks per
jump assuming immediate responses and no waits for couriers. That adds up
to months fast.

with that name: we only get one in every other week or so and
most of those are our regulars. I don\'t ever expect to see her if
she\'s been operating over there. We could use a cheap grav module or three
bad enough that we might not ask where they came from, either.

There\'s actually a potential third alternative to this:  The
Imperial Magistrate trying the case can find that there is a
violation of local law, but that, inasmuch as the offender is an
Imperial citizen and offworlder, not fully cognizant of local
mores, it is deemed inappropriate to submit the accused to local
justice, and that therefore the accused is to be deported from
planetary jurisdiction as /persona non grata/ for a period of at
least x and not more than y, and that such local conviction be
entered on the accused\'s permanent Imperial records.

The accused doesn\'t "skate", as there is now a record that will
follow him, but does not necessarily suffer penalties from a
system where the punishment far exceeds what is warranted.
Further, once PNGed, even after the deportation period has
expired, the planet can keep its own records, and refuse entry
even beyond that.

Because in any trading culture advance knowledge of trends and events is
valuable. You know, worth money. The company who routinely gets its news
a day earlier than its rivals is the one that will do the best in the

The most efficient would of course be a network that used X-boats of the
appropiate jump capacity for whatever leg it was used on. You don\'t need
to replace the whole network to improve the performance considerably.
Simply adding a few core to border jump-6 runs and maybe a few crosslinks
too will do wonders for a very modest price.

Because the X-boats links were fixed by random die-rolls without any
subsequent reality checks and are exactly as plausible as you\'d expect
from such a procedure.

OTOH, if a jump-6 network was based on linking all subsector capitals in
the most efficient way then it would be both plausible and much more
efficient than the present X-boat network. And whaddya know, such a system
must exist, given the assumption that the Imperial Admiralty and the
sector admirals are actually interested in exerting the greatest possible
control over the Navy. Of course, you\'re free to assume that the Admiralty
and the sector admirals don\'t give a damn, but I\'m free to think what I
like about that notion.

The trouble with the X-boat network is not that it still exists, but that
MT claims that (with the exception of the Emperor himself) the elite still
uses it, thus NOT getting the advantage you\'re talking about.

Not if you believe that the elite uses the same communication system as

  If the original message (content & identifier) is unchanged then 
duplicates are ignored as they accumulate; modified messages are new
messages for such a filing system, otherwise the system is a nightmare.

  The main point a confirming info stream is to eventually be able to either
corroborate claimed activities and/or to identify anomalies - ships that were
not where they claimed they were, were ID\'d in two places simultaneoously (?),
or claimed at different times to be in different places (which may or may not
be practical depending on how logs, etc., work). Thus, adding ships to watch
lists for minor errors is not the point, IMHO.

  You shouldn\'t be sending requests for specific information unless
you have real suspicions, which would presumably be handled by the
appropriate investigators (OC, a big port may have such staff in their
security department merely for thei own protection).

  i) the IN (/INI) isn\'t that parochial, ii) the above is the worst
case of short-sighted administration, and is likely relatively rare
in most TU\'s. Most people agree that utter dumps like your example
(1 ship/week - bet it ain\'t big, either) are where such activities
would have a good chance of long-term viability.

  I guess it would be simpler to assume that everyone charged is
guilty, but some people might run campaigns where legal errors do
occur - remember, it\'s only in real life that lawyers are perfect :)

  I\'d go with #1, but the Imperium provides support for enforcement
as it makes its\' own security work much more efficient - and of course
a ship that makes serious trouble with a world can then be flagged for
the In to have a chat with.

  I\'d have thought that a (largely computerized) shipping data collation
system would be the most cost-effective way of indicating a variety of
internal and external security threats. What alternatives do you feel 
provide superior effectiveness or efficiency? Also, what\'s the practical
and legal difference between "petty" piracy and the run of the mill "we
maybe kill some people and steal a MCr 60 [$US 1990? 120 million?] ship"
sort of piracy?

  I have to wonder if some people simply have too much invested in being

doesn\'t it?

  BTW, if the IN has "one or two" couriers available for when news of the
start of hostilities reaches them, then they are _f$%ked_. A sector HQ
that can\'t deploy J-6 couriers to all it\'s constituent fleets in one push
is not being run by sapient life forms.

How many duplicates of this messages did you get? I know that sometimes the
Internet breaks down and we do get multiple messages, but mostly we don\'t.
Why should an network based on a couple of thousand years of maturing that
sort of technology be any less efficient?

That\'s not the way it has to work. IMO it would be much more likely that
someone would collect all these reports at the subsector level and analyse
it. I think it would be an IN intelligence analyst, but it could also be
someone working for an insurance company (actually, it would be both...
and a slew of colleagues). After a while he\'d be convinced that the
Lutalin Countess was a wrong un\', and if he is any good at his work, he\'ll
be right. He may not be able to prove it, but he\'ll know. If he is able
to prove it (and sometimes he will be) he passes the info along to the
appropiate agency and a warrant is issued. If he can\'t, the LC is placed
on the watch list and gets special attention for a while. Maybe then
requests for extra documentation is sent out and if it takes a few months
to get the replies back, so what? It\'s not like any government bureau I\'ve
ever heard about has ever destroyed any records... ;-)

Well, assuming the Imperium has the same standards of justice as the USA
of the 20th Century, they wouldn\'t issue a warrant until they thought they
had proof. But who says the Imperium\'s standard of proof is as rigorous as
that of the US? maybe Imperial justice don\'t work that way. Maybe you don\'t
need to prove anything 100% but merely convince an Imperial noble to sign
a warrant?

>What happens to respect for the MoJ when a substantial percentage of

I think you can be pretty sure that a substantial percentage of MoJ warrants
will be upheld in court. What we can\'t be sure is that they would have been
upheld in an American court.

1) and 4). Mostly 1), but there will be some items that the Imperium bans.

Any crime that requires a multi-megacredit tool to perform is more than
petty.

  I\'m not sure about that. When I was looking at the Marches map for
hypothetical JumpExpress routes it became evident that while not all
links were most economic as J-6 (at least for message carriers) that
the higher jump numbers not only cover greater distances and are less
likely to have to waste a week making a short jump, but that the higher
jump values can mitigate the above failings by zig-zagging to use their
excess legs on a given run to ensure that as many segments as possible
include a relatively profitable system to stop in.

  IAC, the X-boat routes on the SM map (forEx) are massively useless,
and can pretty much provably be all but replaced by private couriers,
which would leave the Xboats as the spine of a "postal service" type
system ignored by almost all high priority traffic.

That simply is not the case. Going from the core to any of the frontiers

But i\'m not talking about setting up a jump-6 system with the same kind of
service that the X-boats provide. I\'m talking about setting up a system
that gives a vastly better service to sector and subsector capitals.

Except for picking up from intermediate stops I agree with you. A courier
should be able to pick up messages just as fast as an X-boat.

The delays can be reduced in exactly the same way the X-boat system reduces
delays.

How frequently? Any more frequently than the X-boat network? No? That\'s
what I thought.

So you pick up the messages the X-boat from the important world dropped off
a few days ago. They will still get almost anywhere faster than by X-boat
alone.

Why should they? Is there any reason why the Admiralty would deliberately
send their messages by the slower alternative? I can\'t for the life of me
think why.

I always thought Traveller was a game written by science fiction gamers,
primarily for science fiction gamers.

I\'ll grant that a majority of authors have been American, and probably a
majority of readers as well, but there\'s a difference between a book being
read by a nationality and a book being written for a nationality.

After all, just look at the number of translations there are. Look at the
excellent work coming out of England, Norway, Finland, and Australia to
name a few countries with active Traveller writers. What about BITS, which
for a while was the _only_ active licensed Traveller publisher.

I\'m probably reading too much into your phrasing. I just keep remembering
the IEEE convention when the chairman led everyone in the Pledge of
Allegiance before each session- at an international conference - when a
majority of participants weren\'t American...


ObTrav: Harvest holidays predate the Pilgrims - check out the seventeenth
century Book of Common Prayer, for example. Two questions for the
Traveller universe:

1) What purely local events get celebrated over larger areas, and why? Did
some Sylean patriot/bigot (depending on your viewpoint) in the Office of
Calendar Compliance seed the Imperial calendar with Sylean holidays?

2) Does anyone else keep track of local years as well as Imperial years?

Here are my notes about Efate:

Size: Medium (8800-10400 km)
Atmosphere: Thin
Hydrographics: 60% water

Planetoid Belts: 1
Gas Giants: 0

Efate\'s sun is a K4 V with a habitable zone around orbit 1 (the 2nd orbit).
The system diagram in TZC shows two worlds closer to the sun than Efate. I
don\'t know if it\'s possible, but if it is, perhaps some rogue world got 
captured by the sun. The planetoid belt is not shown on the diagram.

If one assumes a stellar luminosity factor of 0.611, then Efate has a base
temperature of 7.76 degree Celcius.

Efate is settled before 300 and is a member of the Imperium by then. In
300 the neighbouring Ukaye and not Efate is the end of the trade link
to Regina Subsector. [TA:15]

An Ancient site consisting of a gridwork of thousands of walls spaced
about two meters apart and punctuated by extremely massive bulwarks
at random intervals is found in 354. [SA:37]

On 274-1105 the Traveller\'s Aid Society, following a recent firefight in 
the administrative capital that guts its class A facility there, closes
that facility and posts the planet as an Amber Zone. [JTAS4:4]

The main planetside starport on Efate is called Down-Franklin Starport.

Efate\'s northern continent is named Kormoran. [JTAS6:5]

General Shipyards has a yard here. It is capable of building starships of up

There is a desert close to the Efate starport. [SOM:46]

The major cities on Efate in 1110 is named Anlisha, Makish, Kheker, Arden,

Not AFAIK. Cynthia Higginbotham posted her version of Efate to the lest a long
time ago; you may be able to find it by digging through the archives. IIRC it
was pretty good, but not, of course, canonical.

You can do this with current tech. Invite someone with the desired security
access to a diplomatic function, gather some DNA from loose skin cells or a
drinking glass rim, and culture these cells. Put on a space suit, douse
yourself with some solvent to destroy any incriminating DNA, then
infiltrate the secure site and use the cultured cells for genetic ID.

The assassin dart was portrayed as remotely-controlled in both the book and
movie. Automation is illegal in the Dune universe, and even the sort of AI
we have today would be blasphemous.

It was remotely-piloted but used a capacitive sensor that detected motion;
to avoid being detected it did not transmit visual signals. I don\'t know
why the Atreides couldn\'t dectect the controlling signal, but they
couldn\'t. The scene in the movie was taken from the dart\'s vantage point,
but it did not have a small TV camera any more than the arrows in Robin
Hood: Prince of Thieves did.

I can be worth money, but is it worth the money to routinely get
info 33% quicker?  And how much traffic will that generate.
Remember, we have a culture built around instant communications.
A day makes a big difference when everyone gets info overnight,
but few people will pay that much more to get info at 8 AM
instead of 11 AM.  (Sure some will, most won\'t).

Similarly, were there networks of horse couriers and fast
ships just to carry messages in Renaissance?  Sure some
traders had such ships, but there weren\'t ships at every
port for just such messages (later the US had the pony
express, but that is actually noted because it was unusual
and it didn\'t try and be a system for general communications).

Yes, there are a number of things you could do if you were willing
skip intermediate stops even with jump-4.  And  doesn\'t involve

I you say so.  But then this really is an arguement for redoing
the X-boat network at Jump-4 rather than going to jump-6.

I have to wonder if others aren\'t so enamoured of their idea
that they can\'t see that their arguements for it aren\'t as
definative as they thing.  It is always easy to think that the
other side of an arguement doesn\'t see things as well as you

That the point.  If you are putting up a network with the kind of
service that the Xboats show with the same kind of coverage you
are talking about a non-trivial cost.

The delay will be a week or two, that will mean that will be no

Why send their routine messages by a slow alternative?  Because
it\'s cheaper...

What is really important here is the reproductive life span, i.e. how
many off-spring/lifetime, and child mortality rate. If you double the length
of time that a person can reproduce, then the total # of off-spring/lifetime 
could double (neglecting social impact). This number then grows geometrically,
like compounded interest.

You can look in a basic ode (ordinary differential equation) book for
predator-prey models.

Where P, the total population as a function of time t evolves as

P(t)= P(0) exp( [b-d]t )

where P(0) is the starting population, b is the birth rate, and d is the 
death rate. Make certain you use consistent units for both rates and the 
time. Notice that if b > d the population keeps growing with 
time, while if d > b everyone eventually dies off. Obviously this is 
a very simple model. It assumes off-spring are produced up until death.

So lets make things really simple with round numbers. If you were to choose 
a maximum life span to be 100 years. Call that one average lifetime. And
for a quarter of that time, say 25 years, you have one child every other year. 
Then the average birth rate is 12.5 children over a lifetime. Now over that 
same life time, 100% of the people alive at the beginning of that time
interval are dead. Then b=25, d=1 and t increments in leaps of 100 years.

Now say you want to think about the population change over a number of 
"lifetimes." Here is a quick and dirty calculation.

lifetime  starting pop    children      deaths   ending pop

   0          1             12.5          1        12.5
   1         12.5        12.5*(12.5)     12.5      156.25
   2         156.25         (12.5)^3     156.25   1953.125

Notice that by the end of 3(100) years, the death rates quickly become 
inconsequential to the births in this case.

Now it looks like what you really want is an age structured model,
which is a bit more involved, but hopefully the above will give you a general
idea.

Marks\' Standard Handbook for Mewchanical Engineers states that the size
of these containers are 12.2m x 2.5m x 2.5m which is 76.25m^3 or 5.65
disp.tons (13.5m^3 /dT) or 5.44 dT (14m^3/dT)

In English units it is listed as 40ft x 8ft x 8ft 8in (outside
dimensions), which converts to 78.5m^3

A while back my players formed a mercenary team. They only did it with
the purpose of getting exotic weaponry, but I gave them a copy of a
document I cobbled together called "So You\'re Running A Mercenary
Outfit". IMTU, it\'s published by the Imperial Association of
Professional Combatants", a.k.a. the Merc Guild.

I put it together out of a few posts I\'d seen on the TML regarding
mercenary conduct.

If anyone wants a copy, let me know. It\'s in Word format.

One of the problems is that the cost of jump-6 X-boats has come down since CT.

In CT the cost is 155MCr

In T4 the cost is about 40MCr, G:T aboudt 35MCr. With discounts about 30MCr.

Now at 155MCr the person who thought that converting over from J4 to J6
would be betting the company was wrong (producing and maintaining S and X
ships is a BIG business).

At 30MCr it is clearly a non-issue.

And this only considers J-6 along major routes - the rest of the worlds
can be connected using J1-J4 ships depending on their distance from an
information centre.

The number of TL15 worlds required to maintain this is about one per sector.

So is anyone going to pay for X-boats averaging J5+ and messages averaging J4
between most worlds?

Well one group dear to our PC\'s hearts: THE BANKS.

1) Free traders tend to have J1 or J2 ships.
2) Those ships are on a bank loan.
3) The rate of return barely covers losses due to mishap.
4) The banks cannot afford to have ship owners outrun their debts.
5) The (honest) ship owners don\'t want to outrun the records of their
   having paid.
6) The banks require the PCs to make their regular (monthly) payments,
   and to be able to make them at almost any starport.
   (At least at A and B, probably at C as well).
7) Free Traders want to trade with the lesser worlds where the Megacorps
   don\'t rule.

The current X-boat routes are a disaster for this.

Most PCs would probably be paying the banks quarterly (or worse) because
there are not enough X-boat stops. (If you can pay elsewhere then there
must be communication links to avoid the PCs being chased for non-payment
of debts).

J3+ ships would be almost impossible to finance, since they can outrun
the bank records if they do continual jumps.

Well, to be absolutely fair, the IN can\'t use its standby couriers for
routine messages. If, for example, the IN operates with weekly messages
between fleet HQs and their detatched fleets and an emergency message
arrives the day after the weekly courier jumped out, the Admiral has to
have sufficient couriers standing by to send to all his fleets. similarily
the detatched forces need a courier standing by for emergency notification
of the Admiral. Ideally each fleet should have enough couriers to reach
every other fleet within jump-6 standing by, though this may not be deemed
necessary if there is a shortage of couriers.

Still, I agree that a navy that dosen\'t put a high priority on communication
is a navy that is run by idiots.

Also, you need to consider the "surface" gravity of the star. 

When skimming from any body that has a sufrace gravity greater than
your drive\'s thrust, you\'ll have to be in an *orbit* that kims the
surface at the near end, and has the far end at a level where your
ship\'s thrust *does* exceed the gravity at that level. 

This sort of thing quickly leadsto *very* high speeds. Also, the time
it takes to go from the high point to the low point and back can be
calculated. And it gets to be impractically long. 

If it\'s gonna take a *week* to "fall" to the star, skim, and "fall"
back out to a point where you can "break orbit", you are better off
doing something else. With most stars, it\'s more likely to take a month
or more. And the skim velocity is apt to be so high you\'ll fry the ship.

The \'Scientific Language\' by now is English. German scientists do talk to
another in their home language, but most of the written papers now are
available only in English (although still much of it is translated)

If you study archaeology, it\'s quite different. I know (from my sister)
that most literature had been published in german, english and french,
along with some italian. You will at least have to be able to read it.
And as there also are lots of dead languages, imagining Indiana Jones
speaking a large number of languages is not far away ...

But now for something completely different ...

German speakers have gone to adapt much notions from other languages. Most
of them now come from hi-tech areas, such as computer and entertainment
technology, in which often the english notions are used. It seems as if
the translators got bored or didn\'t even know how to name it in german ...

The commercials on their side even invent \'englishe\' translations for
german products, i.e. the cover it with an english-like name, although the
real language there is no such word.

Some examples:

Videorekorder 
Hi-Fi-Stereoanlage mit CD-Player (guess what?)
Minidisc-Player
Airbag
Handys (i.e. portable telephones)

The top of it in my eyes takes a german telecommunications company, which
advertises with the literal slogan (no translation here):
 \'For a better understanding.\' 
Most (but not all) of the people do.

As you probably know better than I, Steve, as a stockholder, Sweetpea comes
after all other creditors (as do I).

First in line are people like printers and, theoretically, authors or
customers due refunds.

My understanding though is that Sweetpea was loaning IG money to keep it
operating for some time.  I bet that repayment of those loans comes before
stockholder rights, but after other creditors.

The answer would depend on computer technology IYTU. If computers continue
to decrease in size and increase in performance, it\'s reasonable to expect
that advanced actuarial systems can be built into disposable computers
smaller and cheaper than rice grains. Such actuarial computers could be
built into consumer goods, labels, or stuck onto each pool-ball fruit en
mass. They could handle things like repair and warranty records, maintain
stock and shipment schedules, and include transponders, accelerometers, and
memory to track time and position.

All the data would be recorded on non-volatile memory and downloaded
remotely. Scrambled radios and accountants would not be necessary, all the
logic and sensory circuits would be burned into the machines. The cost
would be negligible and would not require any support staff.

How canon is this? Not very; computers in FF&S2 reach a minimum size of
0.005 cubic m at TL 12 and never get smaller. Also, canon shipments like
the anti-rad drugs in Twilight\'s Peak show no evidence of this.

However, if your TU has computers smaller than bread loaves you are already
breaking canon, and this kind of technology would be very useful for
handling strategic, automated, and/or expensive materials in any TU.

While the information provides a lot of good ideas, I notice that he has
the IAPC as an office of the Imperial government. I think this gives us
some problems with canon.

From Traveller Library Data on Imperial Rules of War:

"To mitigate the potentially most disastrous aspects of armed conflict,
the "rules of war" have evolved as an accumulation of unwritten
concepts on a case-by-case basis. The rules of war have never been
officially codified, both to prevent them being seen as an Imperial
endorsement of war and to prevent formal precedent from preventing
Imperial intervention whenever the Imperium deems it necessary. "

So, Erwin\'s document both has an Imperial agency writing down the
"unwritten" rules, and endorsing warfare by creating an office of the
Imperium dedicated to licensing, providing five star ratings, and
otherwise aiding and abetting mercenary companies.

IMTU, I\'d see a group like Erwin\'s Imperial Association of Professional
Combatants existing as a private organization, perhaps with unofficial
Imperial approval. The Imperium should have some mechanism for
licensing mercenary companies - otherwise anyone with a couple MCr
could travel Imperial space with a yacht full of combat troops - but I think
Erwin\'s vision goes a little too far.

About repatriation bonds:

In a previous post I was treating repatriation bonds as a kind of 
free passage off planet paper - things start looking bad, you surrender
and wave your repatriation bond, away you go. This is probably not
the canonical case.

In a JTAS scenario ("Close and Destroy"?), the PC\'s are members of
one of several mercenary units employed by the rebels in a local
civil war. The rebellion collapses, the locals make nice, and several
atrocities committed during the war are conveniently blamed on the
mercenaries. Since the mercenaries are scattered in small contingents,
they are quickly overwhelmed - and apparently lynched. The PC\'s must
make a run for the starport, where they can activate their repatriation
bonds and bug out. This was an extreme situation, but it may show
the limits of a repatriation bond.

I can see some mercenary companies excercising professional courtesy
with each other, as seen in Pournelle\'s _Mercenary_ story - 
IIRC he showed a merc unit surrendering,  both sides assuming
they would be released to leave the planet, and the captured CO
dickering ransom price with the victors for the captured equipment.
Some unsavory merc groups may not act this way, and I can see
some planetary governments being a little less forgiving to captured
employees of a rebellion movement.

A mercenary has a tough job, even if his employer wins. He is an outsider
to a situation locals were willing to kill over. He may have been the one
ordered to do what locals were too squeamish to do, and will be a 
reminder that there were people not too squeamish to order it done.
I have a feeling that the battlefield may be less dangerous to the
mercenary than politics or relations with his employer.

As usual, I\'m inspired to comment on one random element in a thread that I
haven\'t followed in detail.  Apologies to the list if this has been said
before.

In attempting to reconstruct the logic behind the existing X-boat network
in the Spinward Marches, I thought to overlay the Spinward Main and the
X-boat network on the same map.  Behold!   A pattern emerges:

The X-boat network runs *only* where the Jump-1 mains (principally the
Spinward Main itself) do not. 

I infer from this that similar, high-speed communications run along the
mains, skipping worlds as necessary for efficiency but hitting just about
all the Class A and B starports.  A further inference is that this
"network" is probably commercial in nature (since the Imperial network is
clearly depicted).  It may not be a monolithic entity but composed of many
overlapping and incidentally connected networks, each run by a different
corporation for it\'s own use and carrying other commercial and official
Imperial traffic as a sideline (albeit a very profitable one).

Consider:  Say each ship in a given large merchant line (Delgado, Tukera)
carried a large storage bank connected to her communications array. Just as
she is about to jump out, she receives a data burst from her sistership
that just arrived insystem. She carries it to her destination, transmitting
it as soon after breakout as possible to her outbound sistership and to the
lines offices onplanet. Given scheduled merchant lines and frequent-enough
arrivals and departures (and that jump-point masking makes the average
transit time 36 hours rather than 6, for a larger "window"), such a system
would be only slightly less efficient than a dedicated x-boat network, and
considerably cheaper. Multiply by all the lines on the same route, and it
becomes evident that the Imperial X-boats run where they do because the
(low jump capacity) commercial traffic does not.

This doesn\'t solve the Jump-4 versus Jump-6 debate, of course (for that I
favor Peter Newman\'s Decline and Fall scenario), but it should save having
to worry about why the X-boat routes aren\'t commercially viable. 

[No slam to Mr. Kitching is either intended or implied; his was just the
post that caught my attention.]

You could always do what Rolemaster does, if you teleport into any solid
object you don\'t actually teleport, instead you get stunned. Make it a
massive headache or something which will stop them from being able to try

***********************

      Seems pretty simple to me how you stop someone from teleporting into
      an area, just screen it from there view either normally or via
      psionics.  Tlelportation requires that you have either previous
      knowledge of the area you are transporting to or the ability to see
      it.  If they have never been there physically and can not see it,
      then they will be unable to teleport to that location.

The latter part isn\'t particularly true; you can reach escape velocities
using thrusts much lower than local gravity. It just requires more complex
trajectories than an easy-to-visualize high-acceleration trajectory. 

What is true is that the total drag due to skimming has to be less than the
thrust of the engine (but that\'s fairly easy to arrange...)

    'body' => 'Fellow Travellers,

I am about to start running my First Contact campaign, Project: 
StarRise, and ran into a few questions while trying to iron out the 
essentials for the background of the game.

1)  I have an extended system generated for Barnard\'s Star/Ikugi at 
the point of First Contact, but wanted to know if a canonical version 
had been published, in any era.  If so, could someone help me get a 
copy of that information, and I can "reverse engineer" it to the 
First Contact time period?  Otherwise, would anyone be interested in 
my version of the system?

2)  The Vilani are present as miners in the system when the USS 
Starleaper I arrives in system.  I want to make Ikugi the site of a 
Vilani megacorporation, but do not know enough about the megacorps to 
know which one would have been active in that area at that time.  
Does anyone have any relavent information on the mercantile 
affiliation of the belters in Ikugi at First Contact?

Andrew Vallence\'s Prometheus Rising data of the Solomani Rim at First 
Contact gives Ikugi/Barnard\'s Star a population of roughly 7000, 
which indicates a small refining plant or similar operation to me.  
UWP: E200312-A indicates a recently developed site, probably less 
than ten years old or so.  The starport is in the progress of being 
upgraded, but the development of the site will be interrupted by the 
arrival of the Terrans.

3)  How was contact initially established?  I assume the surveyors 
onboard the Starleaper I noticed the radio traffic.  Either that, or 
the SDBs that approached the Terran vessel.  Either one would have 
eventually led to actual attempts to contact.  The formatting of 
visual images can be distinctly varied enough that sending/recieving 
video images might not be viable (at least until official technical 
specifics had been exchanged), but is there anything preventing audio 
contact (via radio, of course)?  How was communication established 
during this important meeting?

[Important note:  In the campaign that I am running, there has been 
prior contact between Vilani and Terrans, which will facillitate the 
language learning curve.  Telepathy was used in this undocumented 
encounter.  However, the Terran agencies that made contact did not 
make the discovery known back home, and are setting up the official 
First Contact to appear as though no previous contact was ever made.  
The psionic  society hidden within the Vilani megacorp is playing 
along, in search of bigger profits, etc., as well as some conquest 
schemes of their own.  The problem is how do the two secret societies 
overcome the immediate problems without being obvious.]

4)  Shortly thereafter, Vilani and Terrans joined in several 
joint-exploration missions, and this is where the Terrans learned of 
the overwhelming size of the Vilani Imperium.  Was that common 
practice?  How was such established?  Did a representative of the 
provincial governor meet with Terran diplomats, or did the Terrans 
travel to the governor\'s seat to make these arrangements?  What type 
of vessels were used in these missions?  What kind of crew compliment 
was used?

Ultimately, the goal of the campaign is to take the PCs through First 
Contact, introduce them to the Vilani, do some explorations with 
Vilani forces, learn about the secret societies manipulating Terrans 
and Vilani toward undisclosed goals, and deal with the situation.  
The scenarios eventually lead to the First Interstellar War, and 
explain why the upper levels of the Solomani forces develop a 
fear/hatred of psionics.  It is this fear/hatred that serves as the 
basis for the current 3I opinion regarding psionics, as it was 
handed down over the generations from the Rule of Man.

The conspiratorial background of the campaign derives in flavor from 
X-Files, Space Above And Beyond, B5, and similar sci-fi plots where 
all is not quite as it seems.  While the conspiracy eventually 
becomes the campaign focus, the governments and other 
political/social organizations involved keep the matter suppressed 
in regards to the media and the general populace, and thus it never 
becomes a part of the "official" history.

More contemporary campaign ideas may be PCs who discover part of the 
picture in M:0 or M:1115ish, and must deal with a group that wants to 
resurrect the directions of one of the two original secret societies, 
and a group that demands that the information be suppressed.  ("We\'ve 
guarded this secret for 3000 years.  We\'re not going to let the 
truth/this embarrassment come out now, after generations of work.  
Kill them.")  This is the direction of the campaign idea I will 
pursue after the StarRise campaign runs its course.

I would welcome any comments and criticisms that anyone has to offer, 
the more constructive the better.

All information obtained and utilized will be documented on the 
Project: StarRise website, which will be announced soon.  (Got half 
the Traveller HERO rules conversion complete, and gotta get that 
finished so I can actually game first.)

Thanks for your time.

In most situations, the GM isn\'t going to kill a whole party over a bad dice
roll.  The failed rolls could mean multiple things like you didn\'t jump to
begin with (See Empire Strikes Back when they are trying to escape the Empire)
to a jump that lasts longer or shorter than normal but you still come out where
you are supposed to.  Maybe you end up on the wrong side of a system to who
knows what.

Its also a time for the GM to have a little bit of fun.  I jumped a mis-jump
from the Solomani Rim to the Spinward Marches once.  I was getting tired of all
the TL-F worlds in the Rim, so I sent them Spinward.  You can do some screwy
time travel things, they of course would be able to refuel and "follow their
vector backwards", switch to alternate dimensions, and a host of other GM
evilties.

I don\'t think that this is correct.

When our Sun expands to fill Earth\'s orbit, its gravitational pull
will be exactly the same as it is now at any given distance from its
centre. IE not very significant at its surface.

As you entered the red giant Sun, the gravity would be lower at any
given orbit than it is now, (although it would increase as you got
closer because the material on the surface is not very dense)

OTOH unless you use one of the variant gravitational tidal limit
theories, the 100D limt is going to be a very long way off :-)

The other point is that the temperature is less important than the
energy density.

In theory you should be able to survive in the Sun\'s corona at 1,000,000K
because there is almost nothing there but not at the surface (6,000K?).

So if you could arrange the fuel scoops to work in a low density region
it should be possible.

But I still think that you would need lots of high speed swoops and
a very reflective surface or the internal temperature would rise too much.

  Eventually Al Morai for one will have additional cash available to expand
(either that or the business has ceased to allow for expansion); while one
of its\' 3-kt space-cows runs ~MCr 1300+, they can get the thirteen TL F J-5 
couriers needed to connect Head Office: Mora to Rhylanor, Regina, and corp 
Ops Center: Shirene (with a ship for overhaul d/t).

  This would at least halve the time to communicate between outlying portions
of the companies AOO, and is much more efficient than using the "route
protectors"
for courier services. It would seem odd if no other business could be acquired
for such a route.

Close on the heels of the joint announcement by General Shipyards and
Tukera Lines that L-Hyd drop tanks would soon be
manufactured in the Regina subsector, came word by express boat from the
Imperial core that a decision has been made to deploy
Jump-6 L-Hyd drop tank express boats on all major express routes. Initial
feasibility studies indicate that such a system could average
jump-5.5 per week by executing maximum jumps, and leaving current xboats
to disseminate information between the new major relay
points. The system is expected to cut communication time to the Imperial
hub to under 25 weeks. The Initial System Deployment
Schedule indicates that the Regina subsector can expect to be fully
integrated into the network within a decade. [JTAS #2, FFW]

They\'re bonds put up by the hiring party, to ensure that mercenaries on
the losing side can get out of there, either passage off planet, or
ransom. Most mercenary companies will readily honor them, any goverment
that doesn\'t will soon find itself in a world of hurt.

basic idea, your\'e a merc, you fight a war. You lose. If you\'re
captured, you don\'t hang around in a POW camp, but get shipped out, paid
for by repat bond. Depending on the particulars of the contract, most
likely, you get out with your personal possessions. The winners may get
to keep captured equipment, etc.

I can totally accept this situation for spreading info at J1/J2 to
planets not on the X-boat/j6 courier lines.

Now my PCs can pay the bank at almost anywhere (either on a J1 main or
an X-boat station).

It also reduces the cost of setting up a dedicated network.
It might even be cheaper (paying carriage vs buying ships).
So now the J6 network should be more likely (IMHO).

Without a regular, efficient, network, your sector admiral has the problem
of how urgent is urgent.

They can\'t use their own J6 couriers for regular dispatchses.
So they have (say) 16, one for each subsector.
But what if another urgent meaasge comes in... since some of the couriers
take months to return even at J6, then your sector admiral is going to need
hundreds or risk not sending a message whilst waiting for a more important
one.

IMO you\'ll end up with so many couriers sitting around that its cheaper
to have J6 X-boats doing the job (and faster since the message can go on
without refuelling).

Hmmm,
back when Nelson sent messages around by frigate, what sort of messages
were sent, did they include commercial messages.
Did the Captains and Admirals sent messages by trusted commercial vessel.

  Good point. So let\'s address the belief that faster commo is unlikely
because it costs more money. Problem: it\'s _cheaper_. Oops?

  At TL F (i.e., since 1025 at the latest) a barebones express courier
service using J-5 100 Dt HG ships costs less to start or maintain than
any system using lower J-#\'s, assuming weekly service. It\'s possible
(though not proven) that a J-6 system is even more efficient, cost-wise.

  In fact, it\'s fairly likely that at least basic J-5 corp courier
networks have been around since 800 or so, and TL F is a bit better
for upgrading J-5 100 Dt boats than building a new network at ~140 Dt.

>For their routine traffic, not at all.

  What\'s routine then, pink slips? They\'re a financial services company
in most respects; the vast majority of their info wants to go as fast as
possible, which means J-5 or 6 by 1100, depending on their willingness
to pay for the last increments. That one corp could probably run their
own sector capital to Capital J-5+ system and make a profit on it.

  Corporations (not even "Mega-") can easily justify and _build_ J-5
routes from their own sectors to Capital; it likely wouldn\'t take a
group of these too long to form a "postal union" covering the vast
majority of the Imperiums major worlds.

  YMMV.

One night I was thinking about the old ISBA (Imperial Ship Builders
Association, a collection of ship building \'companies\' created for T4,
unofficially) and what it would become in 1100 years.
Also I noticed that there is quite a G:T following, and many G:T ship
designers out there.
Some IRC denizens had also indicated their desire for this as well.
So putting 2 and 2 together I decided it was about time to implement a
similar system in G:T.

Introducing the Imperial Starship Architects Guild! (version 0.5alpha)

This is pretty much the same thing we did with the ISBA, but for G:T.
Ships would be designed from the G:T rules and Vehicles can be used for
special components.
Every month we would have a designers contest, like the THUDDD.  Winning
ships would be posted monthly as a sort of  "Ship of the Month" format
like "Vehicle of the Week" currently on GURPSnet.  Postings would be sent
to both GURPSnet and TML alike.

In ISBA most of the shipwrights were CEO\'s of Imperial corporations. By
1120 however most of those companies would have either been merged into
the megacorps, disappeared entirely, or (as in the case of X-TEK) moved
their base of operations from Core to the Domain of Deneb and otherwise
kept their status as a sector-wide company.

ISAG will not necessarily require the creation of a \'company\', but it\'s a
fun idea.  If you wish to remain an \'independent contractor\' that is fine,
and actually quite playable.

Well then, what say you fellow shipwrights?  Should we "make it so" in the
name of the Imperium?

It might be clearer if you look at it from the shipmaster\'s point of view: 
these grungy characters with lots of military hardware show up at your
loading ramp, claiming to be defeated mercenaries and looking for passage
off-planet.  In payment for low passage, they offer you these "repatriation
bonds". You examine the bonds, and see that they were issued by Hortalez et
Cie (in some suitably hard-to-forge format).  

Of course you\'ll take the contract (just as soon as they let you lock up
all those guns).  Those bonds are in essence a bank draft drawn on the
account of Hortalez et Cie, and as such as good as currency. They may be
better than the local currency, in fact, if what these guys say about the
fate of the government is true...

In GURPS Traveller, 200-yr internal fuel supplies for fusion reactors,
reactionless thrusters and "total" lifesupport combine to mean you can
"walk home" -- constant acceleration to the nearest star system, flip at
the halfway point and decelerate, just like an interplanetary trip in
normal space.  This was also possible in the Imperium boardgame: crossing
gaps that were too wide to jump at 1 pc every 4 years (.8-.9c).  One
advantage of this approach is that time dilation will cut your subjective
trip length in half at .866c; repeated doses of Fast drug would cut it
still further.

In versions of Traveller that aren\'t so conveniently equipped, I\'d say
misjumps are a good reason for having all those low berths on board...

The answer would depend on computer technology IYTU. If computers continue
to decrease in size and increase in performance, it\'s reasonable to expect
that advanced actuarial systems can be built into disposable computers
smaller and cheaper than rice grains. Such actuarial computers could be
built into consumer goods, labels, or stuck onto each pool-ball fruit en
mass. They could handle things like repair and warranty records, maintain
stock and shipment schedules, and include transponders, accelerometers, and
memory to track time and position.

All the data would be recorded on non-volatile memory and downloaded
remotely. Scrambled radios and accountants would not be necessary, all the
logic and sensory circuits would be burned into the machines. The cost
would be negligible and would not require any support staff.

How canon is this? Not very; computers in FF&S2 reach a minimum size of
0.005 cubic m at TL 12 and never get smaller. Also, canon shipments like
the anti-rad drugs in Twilight\'s Peak show no evidence of this.

However, if your TU has computers smaller than bread loaves you are already
breaking canon, and this kind of technology would be very useful for
handling strategic, automated, and/or expensive materials in any TU.

****************

      I know it is not thought of well by most Traveller players ( I have
      yet to make a determination since while I have the books I have not
      played) but in T4 basic book there is a great section on life at
      TL-12.  One of the descriptions mentions that computers are in
      everything, from the house and car to the holo display on the box of
      space crunch.  They mention that the computers are imprinted into the
      fibre\'s of the cereal box itself and have a battery life that matches
      the shelf life of the cereal itself.  What you do in your Traveller
      Universe is up to you, but it seems that the computers designed in
      FF&S (either version) are for vehicles and starcraft, and therefor
      much larger and powerful than the ones in the containers you
      describe.

subsidiary planned as a new division of Al Morai.

  There are two sets of routes that make immediate sense; the first is Mora-
Rhylanor-Regina, & Shirene, and the second is Mora-Trin-Glisten. Each costs
about as much as another Type MK 3 Kt freighter (with 13x F-5 and 9x F-6,
respectively); clearly a company with capitalization over _BCr_ 100 can get
cheap financing, or simply pay from cash flow. Worst case they can reduce
dividends for a year or two (nominal outflow of BCr 2/a.) - given their
corporate structure they can realistically expect to capitalize by simply
issuing a couple million new shares for each route.

  The company will need to install way stations at the 100-D limits of Echiste,
Vanejen, and Mercury, plus a cache at 3130; the costs of these will need to be
explored, but demountable/drop tanks tethered to ancient hulks or rocks feature
heavily in the plan. All of the other sites should already have easily available
commercial docking facilities. Overhauls are performed at corp Head Office: Mora,
at the corp facilities already existing there.

  Other admin and overhead costs are largely covered - in fact, this will
greatly speed up company internal commo, and the extra ships needed to cover
overhauls have already been included. The fiscal and admin load added to a 
company with 53 (SMC p. 30 is a typo) 3000 Dt ships is trivial; the issue
becomes whether 4-week service (plus up to one weeks delay) from Regina to
Mora is worth paying for to enough customers for it to be profitable?

  It seems unquestionable that the connecting of Glisten-Trin-Mora-Rhylanor
using J-6 must be profitable; at TL F, population 8-10 billion each (SMC)
these are the economies that are genuinely significant in the Marches (which
doesn\'t say much for the rest of the Imperial sector). If these 34 billion
customers can provide gross revenue of less than MCr 400 p.a. then the new
system runs at a significant profit, and that\'s assuming TCS maintenance costs
of _10%_ of ship cost annually (try that with a normal merchant!), or a mere
Cr 400,000 in carried data charges per launch (halved if using B:2 annuals).

  Thus, JumpExpress would provide six-week data service from Trin to Regina,
requiring from one to four years to implement, and representing only a 2-3%
increase in capitalization over that period. The only aspect in which this
is significant would be the addition of a new type of customer & service. 

  In each case each two-jump segment represents a savings of at least a
week over even enhanced use of the X-Boat routes (i.e., skipping short
legs), with the exception of Mora-Shirene which is meant for company
internal use mainly and largely unnecessary given the availability of
the four Gazelles for this task.

  In summation, this project would be highly compatible with existing
company operations and infrastructure, profitable, and could run under
0.5% of capitalization for a minimum installation over two years.

Funnily enough, yes there were such systems, and people quite happily paid
through the nose to use them. Especially people like Jakob Fugger and
Philip II, and their people.

Large chunks of most books by Braudel are about communication times, and
their effects on commerce and diplomacy, which were pretty severe.

How many jump-6 200 dton Fleet Couriers can we buy for the cost of one 20

No. It\'s pretty trivial. At least for the Imperium or a Megacorporation.

Under any design system, you can build a jump-6 200 dton Express Courier
for within an order of magnitude of the cost of a jump-2 200 dton Far Trader.

MCr 155 per unit is quite doable for a megacorp or a big bank.

Assuming four per stop, thats an investment of about MCr 600 per stop ...
amortise it over 20 years, or when we have advance news of something

I\'d phrase that \'almost impossible to secure with a mortgage on the ship\'.

Actually, not entirely true. The T4 rulebook gives a good deal of
information on very small computers that are "in" just about everything.

If this is a breach of canon (and I don\'t think that it is) then this is one
point where canon is a breech of common sense.

Some basic rules for the mercenary are:

find useful in the near future. It\'s called the "Rocket eBook" and it\'s put
out by NuvoMedia.

Basically, it can store up to about 4,000 pages worth of material. It looks
like it\'s about the size of a stack of 3 or so LBBs. It weighs a little over
a pound (22 ounces). Right now, it doesn\'t look too useful. It\'s pricey (a
whopping $500 dollars), and it looks like it uses a proprietary format for
storage. However, they promise that a software upgrade will allow it to use
various word processor formats, as well as HTML.

It\'s small enough that it can be brought to a gaming table, and it appears
easy enough to use that it would be relatively unobtrusive for a GM to use
to store various materials and access them during a game. It may or may not
be useful to players though.

Apparently, you can do all of the things that you could do with a book, and
then some. You can highlight certain passages, do a comprehensive search,
bookmark frequently referenced pages, and cross reference information. They
even say that you can add notes "in the margin". Furthermore, you can adjust
font size if the text is too small. It has a backlit screen (black & white)
that can run for 20 hours or so on a charge with the light on, up to 40
hours with the light off. It connects to your computer in a special cradle.
Apparently, the books use some sort of encryption to ensure honesty when
buying books.

It would surely save me time and money (in printer paper and cartridges) if
the price comes down substantially. Right now, it\'s only available through
one company\'s catalog, but in early 1999 it\'s going to go national.

Right now, there\'s only potential. If they can make it work with many file
formats, and the price comes down to around a hundred dollars it\'ll probably
replace my Traveller binder.

the computers in FFS2, are descriptions of starship and vehicle
navigation systems, NOT embedded systems like what we are talking about.
After all, even though FFSn specifies a minimum size, the players have
handcomps readily available to them.

There are NO canon design references, AFAIK, regarding personal computer
systems design in any Trav incarnation.

I agree. I\'ve always thought of the Imperium as a hands-off government. I don\'t
know what I was thinking when I typed that bit up. 

I\'ve changed the relevant paragraph to:

The Imperial Association of Professional Combatants is a private organization
whose responsibility includes licensing of corporations to sell repatriation
bonds. The IAPC observes the operations of licensed bonding agencies to ensure
that their patrons pay proper obeisance to the Imperial Rules of Warfare. The
IAPC is funded partly by the fees it collects and partly by the various bonding
agencies who subscribe to its Rating system.

How\'s that?

Some versions of Traveller have had high misjump chances - as high as 1-in-36 -
but sensible versions have the misjump (in the sense of "jump into a random hex"
being essentially zero for a well-maintained competently crewed ship past the
100-diameter limit. If G:T doesn\'t achieve this, it\'ll need some tweaking.
Not that less catastrophic misjumps - "jump to starting point", "jump takes
12 days", "jump comes out a million km out of position" aren\'t possible for
even good ships, but "jump into a random hex" should be rare.

Yeah, they would be nice..but they gotta get cheaper (a vicious cycle of
they won\'t get cheaper until they sell a lot, and they won\'t sell a lot
until they get cheaper...) lighter, and higher resolution. There are LCD
and other technologies heading to market that will put stuff that makes
these devices look like clay cunieform tablets. Those technologies
_will_ revolutionize printing.

Sigh...of course you gotta have a Microsloth PeeCee to use one of these
Nuovo things, too. There\'s also a competing electronic book company with
a very similar device coming out now, too. One or the other of these has
got the backing of companies like Barnes and Noble, so there\'s a fair
amount of push behind these devices.

OTOH, my Newton (circa 1994 nya nya) can accomplish pretty much the same
thing, albeit with a smaller screen. Apple\'s made the NewtonBook
Publisher software available for free, and similar things exist for
PalmPilots, as well.

I am up to 32 orders at present - my thanks to all who have ordered in the

Tomorrow I am sending FedEx\'ing the covers to be autographed to Bill and

want your set autographed, please get your orders in pronto. Once those 50
sets are sold then that\'s it as far as autographed sets go.

And, a last reminder - 2 weeks left to place your pre-order... in other

Delivery - might be delayed until Jan. 15th or so - not sure yet. Thought I
was going to get to devote the entire Christmas holiday season towards

Cogs & Dogs says that this area was under the control of Sharurshid.  It
doesn\'t necessarily say that the prospectors themselves were affiliated to
Sharurshid, but that\'s the way to bet.

The Vilani would have had better sensors than the Terran ship.  Chances are
they saw them first.  This is, of course, only true if they were looking. 
Cogs & Dogs has a rather "poetic" account, that might not bear too much
scrutiny.

EMS sensors would pick up radio signals pretty well.

IYTU, of course.  Loren clearly expressed a different opinion in GT, which

Dunno.  I would tend to interpret the Vilani as being a bit reticent about
this kind of thing, but they might do it to check out the Terrans.  IYTU
decision.

Mmmm.  IYTU, IYTU, IYTU.  "The secret societies manipulating Terrans and
Vilani toward undisclosed goals" bit isn\'t usually how Traveller works
IMHO.  That doesn\'t mean that secret societies don\'t exist, and are trying
to do this, but big Illuminati stuff tends not to happen.  Again IYTU.

Cogs & Dogs suggests that it was the Vilani with the longstanding thing
against psionics.  My reading of the Terrans is that they were pretty much
opportunists who would use anything, at this period.  M0 might have a bit
more on this.  IYTU.

RW conspiracies tend to leak after a while.  Or at last the ones we find
out about are the ones that leaked...

There was a thing towards the end of the French Revolution called the
"Conspiracy of Equals".  It failed, and was broken up.  By some accounts,
it was a precursor of the later Communist movement.  This is in the history
books, but few people know about it.  Why don\'t people know about it? 
Because it was a long time ago, and who cares, anyway?  Maybe "official"
history is the history known to non-historians.

A campaign where all is quite what it seems is pretty dull.  Personally, I
wouldn\'t go as far as you are giving the impression you are in conspiracy
building.  I\'d maybe have a future version of Hubble/SETI spot that there
is something odd happening around Barnard\'s Star, inspiring the US mission
there.  Obviously, that\'s IMTU.

Canonically, there were "scientific reasons" for the expedition going to
Barnard\'s Star, rather than to Alpha Centauri.  It\'s up to you what those
reasons were IYTU.

Or, they could handle transfers of ownership, and act as seals on the

Or, "why does it say that this fruit belongs to Tukera Lines?"
Of course they can be forged.  That\'s what forgery skill is for.  They also

You can\'t run Battle Dress with these chips!  Obviously this is an IYTU
thing, but it\'s still chalk and cheese with the computers in FF&S, IMHO.

Personally I like this section.  Unfortunately I only use the bits I
remember when I ref, since I don\'t carry 12 armfuls of books around....

I don\'t have a problem with computers below the capacity of the ones in
FF&S being all over the place.  Personally, I regard them as furniture and
background, and would only attempt to regulate them if PCs tried to abuse
them.  From my experience, players (from a TL8 background) simply don\'t
realise exactly how much such stuff is around them in a TL12-15 setting. 
If they\'ve been playing D&D or similar recently, half of them are likely to
forget TELEPHONES exist!   (I did this once - very embarrasing).

	Hmm.  That could end up getting expensive.  What caused these
repartition bonds to come into fashion??  I mean, it seems that paying
for getting off the planet of any captured mercs *in addition* to the
money the merc company gets just for fighting the war seems just abit
too much.  Hmmm.

	Intresting though.

	Alright!  That makes even more sense.  As I said in the other

guess that\'s just the cost of war, though.

Even better.   I get info that is six weeks old and you get info
that is only four weeks old, but you also have to pay and twice
the commission that I pay.  I would take that one.

Not when those who are already on planet have already scooped up
the sitations.  The fact is that the invetible delay means that
some of the approaches we are used to in modern society won\'t
work.  Now I\'m not saying there won\'t be some situations where
timely info won\'t be useful, but is there enough volume to
support an X=boat level jump-6 service?  That is debatable.

There were dedicated messengers.  There were not such systems for
routine communications.  If you had to pay off to a bank in florence
you didn\'t use the equivalent of a jump-6 courier.  You used the
equivalent of regular mail.

I don\'t know.  It really doesn\'t matter.  Large organizations don\'t
waste money on things because something else cost a lot more.  The
US government doesn\'t waste money on cars it can\'t justify a need
for because a tank costs so much.

And how does this show the cost of the entire network would be "trivial"?

In my original Traveller game, For an actual misjump to occure (sp) The
players had to 
A. roll a misjump.
	Which would put them on my 100 item misjump chart
B. Roll on the misjump chart.
	Which contained everthing from a really bad misjump accident to just the
engine (and rear portion of the ship) jumping to feul venting to circuts
popping. 
	At face value yes the odds are not in favor of the ship jumping since you
have to successfully roll three skills to jump. I think a combined skill
roll of all three areas averaged and one player rolls for the three players
involved would be apporpirate (sp) (Pardon my spelling I just woke up and
am heading to work.)
What I mean is if you have three players with 16, 17, 16 skill in the three
areas you need to make the jump then average them together and let one
player ( a different player each time) make the roll for the group, that
way the odds of failing are a little lower (the more times you roll the
greater your odds of failing) for the group.
otherwise as it stands now the failure rate for jumps is three times as
high as intended.
opps gotta get to work.

On the horizon is Apple\'s P1 consumer portable.  Priced in the sub $1000
range, it is slated to have an 11" or so color screen, 100BT Ethernet, USB,
and a host of other goodies.  And, it will run the MacOS. 

A bit expensive for the GM\'s assistant, but, at least it can do a lot more
than the M$ WinCE toys on the market.

Didn\'t you forget the little note about how David Pulver already has
Minor Races for all the Alien Races books all written up, and you\'d have
to use them in the Alien Races II, III, and IV;  and thus share
co-author credit with him.  Or has that changed?

    I\'m holding out until I can get a display that I can fold up and put in my

On a more general note, would space travel promote or detract the power of
religeon?

In space, science rules (generally... just ask John Glenn how much luck
helps). However, most religeons are based on a "mythology" (term used
loosely to describe Genesis as well as Olympus, no slant on their validity)
which is brought into question by the existance of space.

However, if you read the journals of many of the early and mid 20th century
physisists, you\'ll find their highly religeos, they do their reaserch to
"figure out how God really did it".

So, how will the existance of God and the "truiths" of Science co-exist in
space, will the two enhance each other, or will one quench the other?

<pun!>
(And God forbid that we would actually find a race in space with another
religeon)

It\'s called a Status of Forces Agreement, a standard treaty with US forward
deployed countries. I believe the precident for the agreement is similar to
the aggreement regarding diplomats and local laws. I\'ll guarantee the
soldiers in question didn\'t get away with what they did once the Uniform
Code of Military Justice got hold of them, especially if there was a
significant breach of conduct to conciter (significant property damage, etc).

This same SoFA does allow for turning the soldiers over to civilian
authorities in cases of Capital offenses. We were warned sternly about this
in Japan.

On topic: Imperial forces on member worlds/client states would or would not
be subject to local civil/criminal law?

Pointer...

Make sure you have two motors, one set to rotate in the OPPOSITE direction
to negate the torque...

Otherwise, you\'ll need some good internal compensators, but concitering
your needing to use a petrol engine, you\'ll likely not have them.

I would suggest that the chances listed are the odds of doing it all in a
20 minute time frame - if you use the \'Trading Energy for Skill\' rules out
of Gurps Basic as \'Trading Time for Skill\', then you can (by taking things
nice and easy) have an average crew (skill 12-14) safely jump, barring crit
failures.

Of course, you need a crack crew to do the much more difficult task of
managing a jump out in combat.

Just out of curiousity, what passage of scripture
(Koran/Talmud/Bible)contradicts current scientific facts with
reference to space travel?

Not trolling, here.  Certainly there is much in the history of the OTU
that would do so, but no scientific fact invalidates the Abrahamic
covenant or those built on it.  As a matter of fact, I think that a
very interesting universe could be built using prophesy.

Man is a religious being, can\'t help it.  Always looking for something
to serve: a king, a flag, a god, pleasure, drugs, money, science,
knowledge, nature.  You name it, man will find a way to idolize it.  I
dare say that if an emperor proclaimed himself a god, many would
follow him (many examples here).  Relics would be worshipped,
technology would be.  Charms and tokens and idols would abound.  A
Mule, the odd psycic, kings, the galactic core... You name it.  The
more populated the universe, the more shades or religion, cultism and
idolatry there would be.  There is no period of human history, no
matter how "enlightened" the culture, that is free of idol worship. 
Every new culture encountered just adds another pantheon to the list.

I haven\'t really gotten a chance to look at the resolution, but if the
various pictures I\'ve seen can be believed, it doesn\'t look all too bad. If
they can bring the price down, I\'d love it. At 22 ounces, I\'m not sure I\'d
want them to make it any lighter, I\'d be afraid it would blow away :-)

It\'s the Rocket eBook that has the support of Barnes & Noble. Also, they
claim that a Macintosh compatible Rocket eBook will be out sometime in 1999.
I had glanced at this and must have forgotten to put it into the write up,
since I know that many of you are Macintosh folks.

There are two other competitors coming out, both of which will be heavier (3
pounds and 4 pounds respectively), and both will be aimed towards corporate
buyers. I\'m willing to bet that\'ll come with a corporate price tag.

The relatively high cost of various handheld units has put me off to them in
the past... That, and none of them had a simple enough interface for me to
think of using in the middle of running a game. I hope that the current
price (for the eBook) is for the technophiles that _must_ be the first to
have a new toy.

At any rate, just thought I\'d mention it. I\'ll be looking out for a price
drop :-)

        IMTU, since Jump seems to be influenced by gravity wells, the
"random direction, random distance" misjump always winds up coming out near
*some* gravity well....  wether or not it is a *useful* gravity well is a
different story.

Sometimes, all you need is a toy. Why would I want an 11" color screen, 100
BT Ethernet, USB and a host of other goodies when all I\'ll really need is
something I can use to store and retrieve information really quickly? :-)

On the other hand, as I stated to Bruce Johnson, the eBook will have a
Macintosh compatible unit out sometime during 1999. If they\'re to be
believed, it\'ll hopefully be useful for everyone.

I remember there being talk of doing this, but was it actually done?

From what I read about the eBook, it is currently for published works only.
Sometime later in the next release it will be able to store other types of
media.

I would choose something like a Newton or P1 for the simple reason I can
use it as something other than a glorified viewscreen, I can actually do
things with it and automate the flow of the game.  I guess it is just that
I prefer an active device where I can create information to something that
just displays previously developed information.  

I think it would be interesting if some sort of wireless network could be
developed so that something like a P1 could have the eBook as display
terminals...

        It was done, but not by Shuttle.  Independant company in Europe has
developed an air-launched SSTO vehicle with a very small payload capacity.
Its first flight was to conduct the "Burial In Space" of "The Great Bird"
and a few others.  I believe the vehicle itself stayed in orbit for several
weeks and then re-entered and burned up.

On the opposite side of the coin; my friend was a US Army Laison Officer in
Germany in the 70\'s. He told me that when the Germans arrested US personel for
capitol crimes (I guess they grabbed them before the MP\'s/CID did...); they
would refuse to extradite if there was a chance of the death penalty being

Nothing contradicts the ability to travel in space, the very concept is
foreign to most ancient writings. The concepts of the universe presented in
most mythohistorical belief systems give a definate shape to the universe.
Most people who called the earth round in the middle ages were killed or
worse just for professing such heracy.

You sure it was Gene, I seem to recall the A&E Biography having footage of
Gene\'s burial.

I could be wrong, I\'ll see what I can find.

I\'ve always tended to think of the bonds as being something along the lines
of a ransom. You get captured and at the end of the contract period your
bond is cashed in by your captor and you get released with passage
off-world. The bond is also a guarantee that you\'ll be able to get
off-world if your employer fails to pay you, or your company gets wasted.

Of course some bonds are better than others, depending on who is holding
them and the exact details of the bond. Also sometimes the captors take the
bonds and just throw the captured mercs on the first Free Trader that comes
along (Low Passage, naturally). This could lead to some \'interesting\'
adventures trying to raise the cash to get off were ever you end up (see
the Dumarest stories for details).

Apparently,  putting information on is handled by your computer. Their own
website says that a _software_ upgrade will allow users to put HTML
documents and various other file formats (not specified) onto the unit.

Differing game master styles. I prefer to plan out adventures in advance,
with little or no random deviation (too much stuff to process in my tiny
mind). As a result, anything I would need a nearly $1000 dollar machine for
I could do at home.

A "glorified viewscreen" would be much more handy to me if I could at the
very least cross-reference flavor text with world data and random encounter
tables... As it stands, I have a huge binder with hundreds of pages, and a
ton of books.

Given the shape of their muzzles and tongues, that seems to be a natural..
The only other method I could see easily working would be a "baby bottle"
type arrangement that has a nipple that can be grasped by the teeth.

Since the Vargr lack humaniti\'s highly mobile lips, they have an entirely
different dynamic when it comes to eating.

To be honest, Gene reenterened long ago.  The private company that launched
Gene (along with several dozen other folks) doesn\'t have the tech to launch
you at escape velocity, so your remains get a few orbits then a second,
very thorough cremation.

One of the jokes among California fans last year that the horrible El Nino
storms were caused by Robert Heinlein (cremated and scattered at sea)
"spinning in his grave" over the Starship Troopers movie.

In the US Army, the very first class you take at the Infantry school is on
the standards expected of an American Soldier.

We don\'t shoot prisoners, and make every effort to keep them safe, don\'t
attack civilians, and refuse to obey illegal orders.

"Vote on orders"?  Fergettit.  The point of an order is that you obey it,
unless it is clearly illegal.  You are ordered to take the point charging
the enemy strongpoint?  Too bad and I got dibs on your boots.

Actually _many_ scientific facts contradict this stuff, such as the
actual age of the universe, the actual age of the planet, just about
all facts about genetics, etc, etc.
But that\'s only if you\'re stupid enought to take such books
literally.
Unfortunately it\'s the nature of those who are religious to tend
toward stupidity

>Man is a religious being, can\'t help it.

Crap. _Some_ people are religious. Hopefully less and less as we
mature.

Speak for yourself. I "serve" no-one and idolize nothing.

That\'s largely because we\'re such a young species and have only
recently started generating people able to function without the
crutch of religion.

Doesn\'t mean there won\'t be religions, but we can hope.

Note that in GT, not all misjumps are disasterous.  They can
result in things like no jump or a fail jump (it takes a week
but you end up back where you started).

that the current Gazelle stats are dubious at best (too many hardpoints,
questionable performance). The combat ineffectiveness is mission based,
but the TL E basis is clearly obsolete and unlikely to be produced in
future.

  However, the 5FW lasted long enough that needed escorts could be 
manufactured in the Marches (at the Big Four) and on their way to the
active zone within a year. Thus, what follows is a suicide sled closely
based on the Type CE, with the exceptions being TL F and rules compliance.

                LE-4455562-300000-40200-0       MCr 293.03      400 tons

        batteries bearing         2 2                           Crew=11.
        Fuel=221. EP=21. Agility=0.

  Includes purifier and scoops. One full and ten half staterooms. No drop
tanks on this model (thus, four hardpoints are legal) so it can fight and
run with full tanks and without the logistics hassles. Price is before
discounts (TL F power plants abeing much cheaper than TL E), but 45 week
construction normally requires that the series have been started.

  The only obvious variant to this is the standard CE of grouping the lasers
into a single factor 5 battery, and using the space from the missing gunner
for either cargo or increased living space. It also appears that one deck
officer could be dropped if necessary for low-risk missions.


                IE-44555E2-340000-50003-0       MCr 303.03      400 tons

        Cargo=1. Fuel=221. EP=21. Agility=3.

  For more aggressive missions we finally have a (light) combat version;
fibre-optic back-up computer, a sandcaster to limit risks from enemy
freighters or escorts, a rack for nuclear missiles, a bigger main battery,
and actual combat maneuver capability. Command crew is not reduced; the
vacant gunners quarters are retained - otherwise as Type LE, above.

 Of the four sectors you are looking for only one (Foreven) has a canon dotmap,
and none have canon world listings.
 What does exist is a more recent version of Vanguard Reaches redone by its
original author (Chuck Kallenbach III), a mishmash writeup of Far Frontiers
done across a decade by three different people (I\'m one of them), an official
dotmap and permission to make free otherwise for Foreven, and a dotmap and
political boundaries of questionable pedigree for Beyond.
 I have dotmaps for three of the four (not Vanguard) on my website, along with
spotty data for Foreven. At least two other people on the Web have data on Foreven
of their own devising. My work on Far Frontiers is not on the Web, but check EBay
for bundles of back issues of "The Traveller Chronicle" magazine being sold by their
publisher Kevin Knight. If you know someone with a good collection of old Ares mags
you can find the rimward half of Far Frontiers (the half I didn\'t do) in one issue
(I don\'t know which offhand...). Someone on this list recently mentioned that they
were working on fleshing out the Beyond for their campaign. Having access to DGPs
writeup of the Trojan Reach (from Megatraveller Journal) would likely help that
effort due to the spillover of political boundaries between the sectors.

That help?

Lets see. Braudel, Meditteranean in the time of Philip II.

Page 356 \'I am waiting for the regular Flanders mail to go past at any
hour\' (Chantonnay to Phillip II, 21 December 1561)

page 357 \'During the 1550s the King of Portugal\'s ambassadors at Rome often
sent their letters by way of Antwerp. This was because the length of the
journey depended less on the distance travelled than on the quality and
frequency of the mails\'

Page 359. \'The fastest speeds in Europe <in the 1520s> were probably
reached by the couriers working for the postal services organised by
Gabriel de Tassis on the Italy-Brussels route, via the Tyrol; this was a
route carefully planned, halts were kept to a minimum\'

page 365 : \'At the beginning of the sixteenth century the tariff between
Venice and Nuremburg varied according to the time taken : four days, 58
florins ; four days and six hours, 50 ; five days, 48 ; six days, 25\'
(cross reference to p458 ... a civil law professor at the University of
Padua earned 600 florins a year in 1506)

Venice. Nuremburg. Brussels. Flanders.

Sounds like pretty decent coverage of the commercial centers of Europe by
regular (albeit expensive) postal services to me ... 

But I think the last word in this debate belongs to the Prudent King  ...
\'It is more important that the letters should travel by a safe route than
that four or five days be gained, except on occasions where speed is
essential.\' (margin note by Phillip II on letter from B. de Mendoza, 28
November 1587).

Let us assume that our PCs in the Express Courier charge Cr 100 000 per
cubic meter to ship stuff at jump-6, and we can put 1000 such disks in a
cubic meter.

If the report is worth Cr 1000 (easy to do with a private news summary for
an important person), then we need to fit 100 into a cubic meter to pay the
tariff of a megacredit a dton.

\'Need\' is relative. The question the Vice-Admirals in charge of Procurement
Policy Planning will be asking is \'Will a Fleet of 7 main units, supporting
units and 6 Fleet Couriers be more effective than a Fleet of 6 main units,
supporting units and 6 + n Fleet Couriers\', where n is the relative cost of
a main unit and a Fleet Courier. It\'s a lot less painful if your Fleet
Couriers replace frigates, for example.

Remember, a major reason the Consolidation Wars and the Nth Interstellar
War went the way they did was the relative ability of each fleet to stay in
touch with HQ and each other.

Lets toss some reasonable numbers around. The first number is the size of
Mora\'s economy. 10 billion citizens at TL15, so we should have a GDP of
around lets call it 150 trillion credits.

Now, Ling Standard Products set up Mora as a commercial enterprise, so I\'ll
assume they run 2% of Mora\'s economy, so LSP (Spinward Marches) Ltd turns
over at least 3 trillion credits a year.

Now, Mora is probably the biggest single LSP profit center, but there are a
couple of other decent worlds in the Marches, so I\'ll assume the rest of
LSP (Spinward Marches) adds up to a trillion credits. We\'re up to a 4
trillion credit a year budget for LSP.

Now, Famile Spofulam has got at LSP\'s board and has convinced them for a
need of a series of Fast, jump-6 couriers connecting Mora, Trin, Glisten,
Rhylanor and Efate. The courier is the TL15 version of the Moonshine class
drug drug runner runner ^k^k^k^k^k^k^k^k^k^k Fast Extraction Vessel,
dropped to 5 gees using T-plates and taken up to jump-6 (FFS2 worksheet
available on application).

LSP(Spinward Marches) has therefore decides to commit 0.5% of annual
revenues to their Internal Communications Improvement project.

The ICI project thus has a projected budget of 20 billion credits. Per
annum. Plus anything they can earn by selling space on the side (one day
delay unless on the Emperor\'s Business, of course).

I think that you should be very careful about using Europe for
an example in thsi case. Distances in Europe is short. I guess
that a decicated rider could traverse most of central Europe
(Italy, Austria, Germany, France, Spain) in not much more than
a week. The distances in Traveller is more like the distances
you have in Europe-America in the 1700\'s or maybe Europe- Asia
a couple of centuries earlier. Here you see no regular mail 
services (I could be wrong :-), because the effort to make
one is to great. There was also the feeling that things that 
happened that far away did not concern them.

Yes but then you buy a ship to travel between to systems. If you have interests 
in 200 systems, then you need 200 ships to pull this example of. Now even 
with a jump-6 system you can only compete with the systems that are close
by you, so all systems between you and the system where the news originated
and is outside your subsector has the information before you and can act
accordingly. This indicate to me that it must be better to dispate a 
trusted aid to the system instead than run things from the HQ. 

I really think that buisness in the Imperium will be very different from
how it is on Earth today, I from what I\'ve read so far here, nobody (including
me :-) has taken the time to sit down and go through every aspect of trade
and business in the Imperium, given the canon setting. I mean, how do
one do business when info takes a month to get to you. Or two months. Why do
people risk their money on such endevors, when it is safer to do buisness
on you home world? Is interstellar trade, (except for the free trader model)
even possible?

Is the debate on military couriors or a freely avaible J6 mail network?
Has anybody really done any extencive work on have fleet warfare in the
Imperium will work? How do you defend your borders, when the enemy has the
ability to jump 5 hexes behind your border hex?

Say you have a Zho battleship standing on the hex outside the Imperial
Border. This is not known to the Imperials. It is a J6, maximum suicide
battleship, designed to do as much havoc as possible before it is killed.
It jumps 6 hexes into the Imperium. How big a chance is it that this
system has a standing force? Say it enters the system close to a gas giant
and skims fuel. The defender of the system is unable to destroy the attacker
and prepares to dispatch couriers. Where does it send these? If the Zho now
jumps another 5-6 hexes into the imperium, he might actually get there 
before any couriers. He can then refuel and jump again. How do you track him 
done? How do you prevent this from happening in the first place?

Which is a GDP of 15.000 credits per head. I think this is increadibly high.
Where does this number come from? (I guess this is a canon number)

Budget is the operative word here. We have no way of determining how much

Agreed, I consider it like a mid passage (or low passage - depends on
how well you bargain) but it also covers group\'s cargo needs.

Plus it tends to have a future date.

Plus ships other than standard merchants might accept it, eg an orbiting
Broadsword Merc Cruiser (if there is space) or even an Imperial battlewaggon.

Of course you have to have a very good rep before the admiral of a Tigress 
Batron offers you a lift...or a very bad one; it all depends on where the
admiral wants to take you :-)

A week is appallingly optimistic, even on fast horses. The best time for a
letter to get from Lisbon to Venice was 42 days, while the best time for
Venice to Vienna was 6 days.

I would argue that the Spinward Marches are potentially as \'large\' as
Europe was in the 17th century.

What is being proposed is that a massive incentive exists to compress these
distances through use of the best available technology.

A good start is to look at how business took place before the telegraph.

You know what ? It\'s pretty similar.

Bond issues. Stock exchanges. Financial crises. Trusted lieutenants going
rogue. It\'s all there.

I have gone through a lot of the issues, and interstellar trade is not
merely possible, but it\'s at least an order of magnitude bigger than most
people think. You can move almost anything at Cr 750 per parsec. Especially
when you have commodities (such as starship sensor arrays) worth
megacredits a dton.

Europe-America in the 1700\'s. Hmmm...

The problem is that the costs of transport are probably about the same
relative to income as in Trav (if not more).

Unfortunately the Colonies at this point in time don\'t have 10 billion people.

Come to that, neither did Europe.

Take the ships that you do have sailing back and forth
and multiply by 100 or 1000 for the population difference.

Granted you wouldn\'t need that many, its just how many you should be able
to afford.

One of the Chinese empires would seem a better match.

Or perhaps the British Empire (transport costs by ship are quite high).

Or the Mongol Empire (but transport costs by horse are quite low).

The Mongol should be the best match - the low infrastructure costs should
balance the much lower information density (a few scrolls or a book) that
could be carried.

True, but if you want me to invest in your company, you\'re going to have
to prove that your trusted aide is actually making some money.

If a private J-6 courier arrives to tell me that your aide has skipped
with the money, then I can sell your shares whilst they are still high.

If I as Joe Public don\'t have the resources to get the reports, then
I\'m either taking a big risk or putting my money with an investment
company that does.

The point is that the investment is local, but the value depends on
distant factors.

If enough Megacorp, sector corp and subsector corp operations exist,
then soon enough the sum total of their private networks will exceed the
cost of a high speed courier network.

The sort of rationalisation that is going on now will mean that corps
start to subcontract these services from a dedicates telecoms company
that can do stuff cheaper and faster (because they carry more stuff
and have regular services).

The Megacorps will still have their own networks which can save hours
or days at most (for example, put 10 couriers on each step of the route
and on average you win on the random jump duration or those just off the J6
main) but only the the really important routes (eg Core to Rhylandor).

Well you certainly don\'t track him using J2.6. You would have to send
requests for help at J6 direct to Depot/Corridor, since the fleet that
you assemble will only be J3/J4.

You could put Tigress batrons at every possible refeulling point within
12 parsecs of the border.

You could equip most worlds with enough 20kt SDBs to stop the Zho before
it can refuel (and incidently vapourise all pirates on sight. :-)

IIRC in FFW, your best hope is that the Zho runs into one of your reserve
units. You just keep them moving to the front using different routes and
since the Zho is running well ahead of any possible intelligence, 
sooner or later they meet and the Zho finds out just what compromises
were required to make a J6 battleship at TL14.

The points lost are normally balanced by what your CruRons are doing
in Zho territory.

In actual Trav, a J6 X-boat network will easily outrun the Zho
because it doesn\'t have to waste time refuelling before the next jump.

Of course, if (like the canon J4 X-boat) it has no manoeuvre drive,
then you might not get to use it a second time :-(

I thing they had to change that due to a potentially conflicting scientific
problem, Alpha Centari is a hot, trinary star system with little
possibility of hapitable systems, let alone an indegionous human population.

As far as First Contact, I believe they did have functional Fusion power
sorces in that era, although the booster would have been solid rocket
(looked like a Titan II).

My question is, how did they land???

Ok, here\'s a bonus question... define young in your above context.

From what I understand, young is a relative term, so who are you comparing
us to in refering to the human species as young? If your comparing us to
our more primitive ancestors, many people would prefer to refer to our
species as "more evolved" (is this evolutionary political correctness?).

Secondly, if there are people capable of functioning without the crutch of
religeon, what is replacing the crutch? Are they capable of functioning
with the absense of any such "support"?

Even if everything defining the universe in everytext of every religeon
that believes in higher beings is disproved, most likely the existance of
the higher beings cannot be disproved. Therefore, even if the
Bible/Torah/Koran are wrong about creation and the other (mostly
observational references) discriptions of the universe, that does not
disprove Gods hand in   creating all this. The biggest question is, how
much impact will this have on the followers of religeons when people start
infering that since their creation stories are wrong, their deitys do not
exist?

(For those who would slam this for being off topic, this is very on topic.
Most TL9- societies would have some creation myth that will be challenged
by some scientific truith. Notice most of my references are general in
nature, with some sitings of earth religeon as a baseline.)

You are wrong. Regular mail services by ship were common long before the
Napoleonic Wars (I can\'t say how much before because I don\'t know the
exact details) and fortunes were made by people who got advance notice of
commercial developments.

European merchants took a keen interest in events in India and China.

A good start would be to have a look at how things were done in previous

Because the potential profits outweigh the risks.

>Is the debate on military couriers or a freely avaible J6 mail network?

As often happens, the debate has shot off in various unforseen directions
and the various sub-threads have become confused.

My original point (which was itself an aside to a different issue) was not
that I considered the X-boat network impausible in itself. I admit that my
belief is a bit strained, but not past breaking point. Basically I explain
it away by saying that it was concieved as a jump-4 network because that 
was the state of the art at the time and it remains a jump-4 network
because there is a powerful lobby of X-boat manufacturers with a vested
interest in keeping it the way it is. What I don\'t believe is that all
message traffic (except for the Emperor\'s own secret network) goes by the
same X-boat network (which is what we are told is the case). For one thing
I\'m convinced that the Imperial Navy will insist on keeping in close and
frequent touch with its component fleets. That creates an alternative way
to get messages back and forth between Capital and each subsector capital,
and I find it exceedingly unlikely that _given that the couriers are going
to fly anyway_ the Imperial Bureaucracy does not avail themselves of the
opportunity to \'piggyback\' on the navy system.

Whether \'Navy-net\' mail would be available to private and commercial traffic
too is another matter. I could believe it either way. Certainly the Royal
Mail packets of the Napoleonic era took private mail too. And OTOH I don\'t
believe that military networks are generally available to private concerns
nowadays. But I also believe that if it is not, then some sort of commercial
network will also grow up. Maybe (almost certainly) not as extensive as the
X-boat network, but some form of commercial network would exist. It is simply
too costly to be too much behindhand in your commercial information.

>Has anybody really done any extencive work on have fleet warfare in the

You spend a large percentage of your military budget on defending your
industrial planets and the rest on offensive armaments. You then play
cat and mouse with the invaders until one side makes a mistake.

That depends on the size of the population and the TL and infrastructure of
the system. If the Imperium is smart it also has a few CruRons and BatRons
doing random visits to outlying systems.

>Say it enters the system close to a gas giant and skims fuel. The defender

At a minimum one to the subsector fleet HQ. Ideally to all navy forces
within range, though that would require a lot of couriers.

>If the Zho now jumps another 5-6 hexes into the imperium, he might actually
>get there before any couriers.

That depends on how soon the courier was dispatched. It\'s a moot point,
though, because any navy that is willing to pay the high cost of setting it
up can get a ship any depth inside any neighboring empire. It\'s just a
matter of laying down a sufficient number of deep space fuel dumps. So
even interior systems need to be ready to defend themselves.

You need to outguess him.

You don\'t. However, don\'t forget that you can do the same thing to him.

Not incredible. I\'ve been trying to promote the idea from _Pocket Empires_ 
that the GDP of a planet (in local credits) is per definition Cr10,000 and
that the difference between the value of credits from different worlds (the
exchange rate) depends on the difference in productivity. But if you go by
_Striker (I)_, worlds have GDPs based primarily on their TL, modified by some
of their trade classifications. IIRC a planet with a TL of 15 has a GDP of
22,000 per citizen. If it is Rich or Industrial that goes up by another 20%.

Presumably around 3-5% of capital investment.

Thank you very much for your input.  I appreciate the  response.  As 
I do not have much info on the Vilani culture, I have gone to the 
most knowledgable source I know: the TML.

Here\'s the current version, adding in your input:

Ikugi/Barnard\'s Star is under the control of Sharurshid.  They\'ve
recently established a processing plant, probably starting around 
2087AD.  In 2093AD, the Hubble or its equivalent detects unusual 
activity in the direction of Barnard\'s Star, after the EM 
emissions from the increased traffic there have travelled the six 
years to Earth.  President Inch is informed in private sessions, and 
she initiates the Starleaper project.  The US NSA of the time period 
sends a secret mission to Barnard\'s Star, with a telepath on board to 
help facilitate First Contact communications.  Sharushid 
representatives were thus contacted, and the US NSA officers had to 
deal with the Vilani fears of psionics.  Arrangements were made 
between the two for an official First Contact two years hence.  
Sharushid\'s reason may center around a local executive\'s interests in 
monopolizing the access to Terra\'s advanced engineering and medical 
technology.  (Or maybe some executive has a secret interest in this 
"psionic technology", and sees this as an opportunity to advance 
himself.  Who knows.)  The US NSA is, of course, interested in 
learning as much about the Vilani technology as possible, to advance 
themselves within their particular niche as an intelligence agency.

[This interpretation of Trav History is based on the fact that 
the MT ImpEnc reports Terrans travelled to Barnard\'s Star in 2094, 
but First Contact happens at 2096.  Other canon sources claim that 
the first trip to Barnard\'s Star also included First Contact, and 
most often sites the 2096 date.  I saw the abnormality, and this was 
my first thought on an explanation for it.  Fortunately, it has a lot 
of "Conspiracy Theory" flavor, which my gamers seem to love, and 
sounds like it would be fun to develop.]

>IYTU, of course.  Loren clearly expressed a different opinion in GT,
>which suggests that canon will ultimately go against you.  Tough. 
>There ain\'t no canon police.

I know that official canon is against me, but it sounded like an 
interesting variant worth exploring.  However, I am trying to stay 
within official canon for the "official historical account of the 
Traveller Timeline."  My campaign simply explores some potential 
motivations behind the official events surrounding First Contact, the 
First Interstellar War, and the formation of the Terran 
Confederation.

While I agree that this situation does not fit the rest of the 
Vilani\'s standard practices, canonical references do state that the 
Terrans did join the Vilani on joint exploration missions.  Several 
of the sources state that this is where the Terrans learn the full 
scale of the First Imperium.  So my question to myself was "Why?"  I 
again fall back to my initial Conspiracy Theory premise, and assume 
that there are forces on both sides of the Terran and Vilani that 
want to pursue a higher level of interaction with the other.  So much 
so that they go against their normal operating procedures.  For 
whatever reason, though, it happened, according to the OTU history.

Usually, the Traveller Universe keeps the role of grand conspiracies 
as part of its background.  Examples include:  The Shattered Imperium 
(the assassination of "Strephon" in MT), the AI Virus (Lucan\'s 
folly), the Psionic Suppressions (an experiment in psychohistory gone 
awry), the Hiver fascination with psychohistory/cultural 
manipulation, and (admittedly a little weaker, but still a lot of 
potential) the secret manipulations of Cleon in the founding of the 
Third Imperium (including the secret meetings he had with the Vilani 
in order to bring them in).  I sure others on this list could provide 
more examples.

> RW conspiracies tend to leak after a while.  Or at last the ones we
> find out about are the ones that leaked...

As the differences in various timeline references might indicate to a 
historian paranoid enough to notice it and start asking himself 
"Why?"  Basically, though, it\'s an excuse to turn some rifts in 
canonical references into a good game.  I hope it works.  After all, 
enjoying a good game is what it\'s all about, to me anyway.

Thanks, again, for your input.  Every little bit helps make my game 
more enjoyable for both me and the gamers that grace my table.  I 
still welcome any other input you or others might have regarding 
either this post or the original one.

The chance will depend on whether Imperial Navy Intelligence knows
the TL-14 Zhodani have obtained jump-6 technology or not (Zho\'s are
max TL 14, which limits them to jump-5).

The Imperium will have standing forces in every system the Zho\'s can
reach in one jump from known possible start positions. The farther
from the Zho border, the less impressive these forces will necessarily
have to be - it takes a smaller system monitor to whack a jump-6
battleship than it takes to whack a jump-4 battleship, the latter has
at least 22% more hull space to mount armor and weapons on.

Note that the systems jump-5, jump-6 and so on from the Zho border
will also have in-place reinforcements for the more forward systems.

If you allow easy set-up of deep space refueling platforms, it doesn\'t
matter whether you are jump-5 or jump-6. You can set up a chain
of refueling stops in the deeps between the stars and send your
battleship ten, fifteen, even twenty parsecs into enemy territory.
Of course, chance discovery of such a chain of refueling depots
would be immediate cause for war, whether you were ready for it
or not.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The role of high-jump vessels in disrupting the enemy rear is a worthwhile
reason to build them. They\'ll probably die when caught by equivalent
or even slightly inferior tonnage regular units (due to the hull space
they spent on strategically vital, but tactically useless jump capability),
but that\'s the opportunity cost of long legs.

I would say the known presence of such deep penetration vessels
would have a serious effect on politics. If you know your frontier is
going to be "leaky", that enemy raiders will (at least for a time) strike
throughout your interior in time of war, you may be less likely to want
a war. Since you\'ll be less sure you can seal your borders through force
of arms, you may be more likely to attempt border security through
diplomacy and compromise.

I think he meant (I and I think he\'s right, BTW) that people invent
religion everywhere. Individual MMV, but cultures all around the
world invent religion. It obviously fills a human need, certainly at
some point in development. It may not make any sense to many of us
at a later age of development (it doesn\'t to me :-), but face it,
it\'s true.

Neither do a lot of people, again, that wasn\'t his point. Like it or

Heheh. I would think that the more inflexible ones extant now would
either: become flexible, or fall apart. The ones that were flexible
to begin with might well move on into the future. What (if any) new
ones get invented to keep up with "current" facts (Grabdfather,
aliens species as clever as us, etc.) might be interesting flavor
for a campaign.

Hell, keeping a bunch of yahoos that still argue that the universe

That depends on what you mean by routinely. It won\'t give you a fixed dayly
profit, if that\'s what you mean. But every so often it will allow you to
make a large profit or avoid a large loss.

Apart from the examples that Steven and Ian has provided, history shows us
one more situation where a few hours can mean a huge difference: When you
are buying and selling luxury goods. Take the annual tea races in the
previous century for example. The clipper that got into harbor (or
harbour ;-) first each year got the best prices. That was so valuable that
they built huge ships dedicated specifically to this one purpose. Not to
fetch tea from China, but to fetch tea and get home first. The other way
can also mean a huge difference. You learn that a particular planet has
a particular need or a particular surplus. The ship that gets there first,
get the profit. The second may not even break even.

Nor do any of us propose that there would be a network that connected all
Imperial planets. Just the 3-400 most important ones...

Well, the Danish postal service was set up during the 1600s. I can\'t say

Better yet, why not do both? Have some boats that skip intermediate stops
and some that don\'t? Why should it be either or?

How do you figure that? The messages go by X-boat until it reach a courier
node where it is picked up. So you don\'t lose any time there. After that it
goes faster than the X-boats for a while until it is dumped into another
X-boat at another courier node. No time loss there either. Then it proceeds
the rest of the way by X-boat. No time loss there either.

>After that the savings will be modest until some distance.

Even if that was true the Imperium does have the distences to make the
savings more than modest. That\'s sort of the point of claiming that the
Imperium is training under the communication lag.

>>>There may be J-6 couriers between the Capital and Mora.

Not according to canon, which state that all message traffic goes by X-boat.
Which is the problem I have in the first place, not with the existence of
the X-boats per se.

Not if they send priority messages by jump-6 courier. As Ian pointed out,
information is VERY dense (It\'ll BLOW you densitometer!!! ;-). Sending
100,000 Terabytes is no more expensive than sending 1.

It\'s reasonable.  The estimates made by list members using various rules 
(TCS and Striker from CT, WTH from TNE, and so on) suggest an Imperium of
15 to 16 trillion citizens and a total GDP of PCr 220 to PCr 450; that\'s
a GDP per capita of somewhere from kCr 13.75 to kCr 30.  I\'d say most of
the estimates of GDP per capita actually cluster close to kCr 15.

In the real world, for comparison, recently US GDP per capita was estimated
at $28600 -- for the UK and Germany about $20400 per capita, and Norway 
was about $26200 per capita.

for all those out there that are so blantantly anti-religious with your
bashing of those who subscribe to a god, or a supernatural realm of belief...

you have replaced the one true god with your own god. That God is a cold hard
science. and that is the most harsh religion of all to bare. for there is no
compassion, no hope offered in it.  just dispassionate logic when ever it
works correctly, or at least until hte latest theory governing that area of
science comes out.

It is even more short sighted than any of the religions practiced by humanity.
it can not explain such things as the miricles that have occured (total
spontanious remision of cancer or 80% of medical cases that completely turn
around when the paitent is preyed for, or even ESP...)

i personnally believe in god for several reasons.  

one of them is that during the Gulf war on several sperate occassions i should
have been cut down in a hail of gun fire.  but none of those angry bullets
found me.  even when one of those iraqi soldiers was less than 10 feet away
form me.  he fired off his machinegun and destroyed the wall behind me, but
didn\'t touch any part of my body.

second reason...  i have always had the ability to promote healing in others,
or to lessen their pain when i touch them.  but i feel their pain when i do
this. to me its not a gift. its a curse. 

third reason.  i have Faith.  this is the most important reason.  no matter
what happens you must retain faith in something.  be it god, gods, nature or
science.  and as much as my life has totally sucked i have not been abandoned
by my faith.

call me a fool all you wish, and i will just ignore your short sightedness and
pety arrogance.  for through out human history you can see where faith has
held a people together against overwhelming odds (malta in ww2 for an
instance)...  battles of less importance where lost when everyone\'s faith was
no more.  but mankind has endured and survied.  grown stronger in both their
faith and their abilty to weather the storms of civilization and technological
improvements.  

when something comes along questioning or disproving some minor part of
religious texts we have been able to reinterpret said text to gain a better
understanding of it.  when it was discovered that the world was just bigger
than they thought it was mankinds understanding and faith grew with this new
knowlege.  i see no diffrence when we reach out to the stars and find another
race waiting for us since i dont see god wasting all his time with just us
(hell if i was a god with that much power i would fill the universe with so
much stuff i would have to make a bunch of pocket univereses to hold the
spillage).  that is where our combined arrogance sits (both those who beleive
in god and thsoe that beleive in science) when we disbelieve in the possiblity
of something being "Out There"..

how many times science has come up short with out the \'right\' answers... how
many times has science had to be \'rewritten\' to fit what is real and what is
not?  how many scientific theories have had to thrown away or completely
rewritten?  at one time sceinctific community said evolution was the way man
came about until proof that modern man and dinosaurs where around at the same
time when foot prints in sandstone was found down in Texas, or that bones of
several \'prehistoric man\' where located along with those of modern man as
well.  

the theory of evolution was completely re-written due to these findings.
they where not our predissors they say now.. but kissing cousins in the big
old family tree of primates.  

sceince like religion has to grown and evolue just as religion must.  for if
either becomes stagnate both they and humanity die.

but most inportnatly we must allow each and every individual to seek out their
own path. to establish their own belief system, and enure that others do not
put down or oppose the choices made by others.  

for some one who dispises religion so much, we can only feel so much pity for
them..  for they are not as enlighted as they would like to think. they are
nothing more than another pety and arrogant person no better than the extreme
religious zealots who cause so much sufforing for every one when they promote
terrorism in the name of their god.

Ps- so far i have been lucky, i have only met one person in my life i would

In fact, one of the technologies I was thinking about is able to do
that, the so-called \'smart paper\'. It\'s the one with tiny latex beads,
black on one side, white on the other, that respond to electrical
signals by flipping. They have flexible examples in the lab now, at
something like 300-350 pixels per inch. (Saw it in Scientific American
sometime in the last few months.) Really cools stuff, and of course,
this is another one of those things that Xerox Parc developed back in
the 80\'s, and they never capitalized on...(IIRC)

I\'ve heard this before, but without significant description.
Is it the fact that the system is a trinary one that makes life 
improbable, or is it the primary itself?

In looking at a catalogue of stars within 50ly I noticed most (all?) had 
stars with luminosities that seemed too bright or too dim to support 
human-like life.  I THOUGHT Alpha Centauri might be OK, but then I read 
in a couple of places that binary (or trinary) systems were unsuitable - 
but I am afraid I still don\'t understand why.

MTU had hundreds of breathable, habitable planets, but I am starting to 
question the accuracy of their frequency.

Does anyone know if there is a "rule of thumb" scientists use when 
looking for stars that might support habitable planets?

Is the CT/MT universe more generous in handing out habitable life 
systems than current scientific theory dictates?

One other question, I\'ve watched one episode of B5 (I have no idea what 
it is about), but I noticed they have characters they refer to as 
"Centauris".  Are these supposed to be bipedal life forms from the 
Centauri system, or descendents of earth colonists?

All opinions welcome,

Religion CAN be an interesting discussion.  It CAN be on-topic cause
there is a BITS book on the subject, and there have been other
"official" articles published as well.

However, tying the game\'s religions to real world religions is moot.  In
the official Traveller universe, Marc Miller has determined that there
is a "Grandfather" and other "Ancients" who genetically changed
creatures and placed them around the universe.  There are also other
aliens that were not "uplifted" by them apparently.  As far as I know,
he didn\'t say that there is a truth out there that has a religion tied
to it.  Is there one, Marc?  Is there a religion in the Traveller
Universe that worships "Grandfather"?  Or were the ancients created?  Is
there a power behind them?  Are there Millerites?

This rules out any of the "Terran" religions as we know them today,
because all are false, in the Traveller Universe. 

Therefore, in the spirit of the game, either put them in or leave them
out, cause in the game, it doesn\'t matter.  In real life, this is not
the forum for a serious discussion about religions.  That should be
off-line.

IMTU, I don\'t have a Grandfather (like Marc created).  And I also have a
True religion.

  Stands to reason this must be so.(I have also assumed this IMTU.) There
are numerous canonical references to misjumped ships being found floating
in this or that solar system. If the direction and distance of the misjump
were totally random, the odds of this happening would be essentially zero
(even considering _every_ misjump made during Imperial history).

Discription:

The Ararat class corvette is a Solomani fast patrol and fleet screen vessel
prevailant In the Solomani Confederation High Guard Fleet. The ship is seen
in two basic configurations, the PAW spinal mount version and the Meson
spinal mount version. Both utilize the punch of a light spinal mount, and 4
heavy laser turrets to screen larger Fleet vessels during major engagements.

The Ararat class also sees  a great deal of use as a boarder patrol vessel.
In this role the spinal weapons present a "quick kill" effectiveness against
commerce raiders. The Jump 4 (or conbination thereof) and 3 gee performance
of the Ararat class provides rapid movement between, as well as in, boarder
systems. This allows a "fight or run" tactic while on boarder patrol duties.
The Ararat class if , rarely, facing an enemy with greater fire power, can
typically jump out system and act as a fast courier sounding the alarm.

The inclusion of a 20 man Confederation Fleet Marine unit also allows the
Ararat class on patrol to act as a quick interdiction vessel for planetary
actions. The Marines, who act as support and damage control during space
borne actions, are supported by the inclusion of a 50 sdt modular cutter.
There is cargo space available in the design to store 2 modules (3 if one is
"mounted", however this dictates the use of external module changes).

The S.C.S.S. Katoomba, detailed above, is typical of this class of vessels.

Notes:

The Ararat class Corvette is one of the more commonly encountered vessels
found along the Solomani boarder (IMTU). Most often it is on patrol in a
commerce protection role and in a "show the flag" capacity among Solomani
colonies. The cutter and Marine compliment, along with the random but
frequent appearances of these small ships in a young colony\'s sky tend to
discourage "anti-party" activities.

The Ararat is a military vessel and it\'s accomodations reflect this. With
the exception of a large state room which doubles as an infirmary for the
ship\'s medic, and 6 small staterooms for the Naval and Marine officers, the
crew is housed in 2 bunk rooms, one for Naval and one for Marine personnel.
A gym is gym is provided to keep the troops in trim, and it is equipt with
holographic target practice facilities. THere is also an armory which houses
the personnel weapons.

Two modules for the cutter can be stored independantly, taking up 60 tons of
cargo space. If only 2 modules are carried there is, barely enough room to
switch them internally. A third can be carried mounted and the modules can
be changed using the rules found in Adventure 7 Broadsword (CT).  Typical
modules carried include an ATV, Personnel, and open cargofor patrol duty.
During Fleet action one or more Fighter module(s) can be used to supply
further screening capability.

good scan coverage of the space around a planet.  It is capable of
detecting unstealthed ships out to 10,000,000 miles away (Free Trader, -9
to skill)


Manned Orbital Sensor Platform (TL 10)

Crew: Commander(Leadership), 6 Sensor Techs (Electronics
Operation[Sensors]), 3 Commo Techs (Electronics Operation[Commo]).

20 Space Hull, 100DR, Basic Bridge, Engineering, Manuver, 3 Staterooms,
Utility, 0.5 cargo.

Statistics:  EMass 98.86, LMass 98.86, Cost 11.9675MCr(Without Discount),
HP 6,000.

Performance: Accel 0.40Gs, Jump 0, Air Speed USL, Size Modifier +7.




Note: while the sensors can detect a ship out to 1,000 hexes, its not
*likely*. no mods to detect on a free trader gives a range of 30 hexes. A
more stringent application (no mods vs standard scout) gives an effective
range of 3 hexes (15 hexes with a handoff or prior detection) and a max
possible range of 100 hexes (450 hexes with a handoff).

A Rampart Fighter would be -2 to detect in the same hex (+2 with a handoff
or prior detection), with a max possible range of 7 hexes (30 hexes. with a
handoff)


If you want to relate this to the piracy debate, a 400 dton TL 10 ship with
Basic stealth and EM:
no mods at 4 hexes, with a max detection possible at 150 hexes.

the jump limit for a standard planet is 80 hexes, at this range the
hypotheical pirate is -8 to detect.

if we assume an operator skill of 12 that is a 4 or less to detect. or
1.85% per turn this give a 49% chance of detection after 36 hours. not real
good for the pirate, but not impossible odds either.

a ship of the same size with military stealth would be impossible to detect
at this range. (unless you switch to higer TL sensors)

On of these, a pair of launches to service it and 16 light fighters cost
less than 100MCr.  If a world has any resonable population (say 10,000,000
cits with taxes of 1Cr year to maintain this) it should have at least this
much in the way of defenses.

It\'s a change in canon I dont like. The G:T rules as they stand make
planetfall-capable merchants too inefficient, and we want to encourage
ships that can make planetfall themselves, rather than stay in orbit and
have big interface shuttles come up to meet them.
****************
These are encuraged by the number of low tech, small starport woulds in the
Imperium.  IMO the interface suttles are only available at A, B and some C
starports. if you don\'t stick to those ports, the benifit you gain buy not
chosing streamlined is countered by having to carry your own shuttles.




Anyway, a mostly smooth sphere or cylinder should be capable of making
planetfall with contragravity, as long as you didnt leave too many bits
sticking out.

They can, but have no landing gear, so you would have to land on water

Considered, and filed under \'Famile Spofulam Built Me\'. It is FS, so it has

No you cant. Not charging Cr 8000 a passage you cant - the economics rules
are broken enough to start with, doubling the density of middle passenger
biofreight makes them into even more of a sick joke than they are (and I\'m
referring to the Traveller trade and freight rules, not the half page job
in G:T).

Well hopefully this will be fixed in GT trade and commerce.  My suggestion
for it is 4,000 for a middle passage and two per stateroom.

Well, sort of.  The armor doesn\'t take up volume, but the manuever drives
required to support the armor do.  For a 170,000 sf ship, +100 DR is 850 tons.
Manuever drives to move this weight at 1 G are 21+ spaces and 3.4 MCr.  One
extra sandcaster is 1 space (plus 1/8 space manuever) and costs .27 MCr
including the extra manuever.  Unless you\'re expecting to defend against 10+
ships at once, the sandcasters are a better bargain.

if you put the bay inside the ship is works as you discribe, but if you
want mor choice in your targets, you need to have it be able to rotate and

No, it\'s a typo.
Otherwise, we have to assume that
1) very heavily armoured ships magically get armour over their bays for
free, and
*****************
They don\'t, each bay has a surface area of 6,500 sf. it gets armored
seperatly.



2) all jump ships with bays magically get more efficient jump drives (or
that jump ships without bays install bigger jump drives than they need)
***************
We already assume that with turrets.



If you like you can make the bays internal, remember to restrict their arcs
of fire.  You can also make the turrets pop turrets, they will take up 4
internal spaces, but mass and cost remain the same.


While we are fixing up typos, you missed explicity stating the minimum hull
size needed to install bays (otherwise FS is building a 40 dton Heavy
Fighter with a PAW bay bigger than it is).

Each bay takes the place of 10 turrets, you have a minimum size or 1,000

Here\'s the newest (and perhaps final) version of my Kushdakaa class light
freighter. The goal here was to design a ship that with very little
creative trading (read, speculative) this thing can perhaps turn a profit.
It does this by:
  * Being small enough to be operated by one or two individuals -
independent types a-la Han Solo. such independents would no doubt dispense
with formal salaries - relying purely on the profit margin.
  * Class discount of 20%...this hearkens back to the CT days, but I like
it, so I still use it IMTU.
  * Smallest possible drives - drives are by far the most expensive item on
a ship.
  * A small power shortfall - requiring creative power management but
lowering power plant cost.
  * Fuel purification so unrefined can be bought. Scooping allowed for teh
adventurous captain.

Some small changes to the advert:  (only changes included)
The small size
also makes the Khushdakaa extremely affordable: with standard 20%
discounts (normal for mass produced designs) the ship costs less
than 14MCr.
Even though it is small and inexpensive, the Khushdakaa performs
admirably. Nearly forty-five percent of its volume is devoted to
cargo space (in the form of four 10.5 ton cargo bays and a single 0.5
ton luggage bay),

The single purification unit can purify the entire fuel supply
in under 2 hours.

        County-Class Strike Carrier   Type CS
        TL 11.  1200 tons.

        The ship has 12 turrets. There are 12 beam lasers mounted in 4
turrets organized in 2 batteries.  There are 8 plasma guns mounted in 4
turrets organized in 2 batteries.  There are 12 missile racks mounted in 4
turrets organized into 1 battery.  For defense it has 12 sand-casters

is a 40-ton magazine and are 20% of missiles normally carried are nuclear
weapons.
**************
12 or 16 turrets?

        There are 30 ship\'s vehicles.  The ship carries three squadrons of
Typhoon-class "Standard-III" multi-role fighters.  Two squadrons of
Typhoons
are armed with single pulse lasers, while the third is armed with triple
missile racks.
**********
10 dton fighters?



        The County-Class Strike Carrier requires a crew of 80.  10 Command
section, 2 Engineers, 7 Gunners and 61 Flight section are required.
        The fighter crews operates the fighter compliment.
        The ship costs MCr709.20, including architects fees and takes 48
months to build.  The first was built in 2097, with a production run of 24
of these ships scheduled between 2097 and 2105.  The lead ship was the
UN-DSN Dover, and has been assigned to the Spinward areas of the

********
for conversion purpouses I assumed that the fighters are 10 dtons and mass
50 tons each.

This kind of ship is also whre the GT ships come out cheaper compared to
others. the undiscounted price is less than 25% of the HG _Discounted_
price.  For small civilian designs the systems match well

with the extra savings you could buy Total Compartmentalisation, Radical
Stealth and Radical EM the accel stays the same and the price is bumped up
to _only_ 264MCr.

The crew is a close match,  three of the six engineers are for the small
craft.

20dtons of cargo space earns KCr 40 revenue per month. This will support a
couple of megacredits in extra sticker cost. Plus you can have express
cargo already in the ship\'s boat, ready for the first trip down.
***************

Hrm
40 - 21 (Boat Bay for a gig) + 6 (Cargo in the Gig) - 3 (thrusters for the
gig and extra cargo) = 22 dtons = 44KCr month if running full.

the gig and thrusters run 5.97 MCr with a payment of 25KCr / month

Looks viable to me.





Smaller ships can and have competed with bigger ones on the same route,
*provided* they are prepared to load, up and go immediatly. None of this
one week stuffing around waiting for a cargo ... when the cargo shows up,
you *go*.
**************
Agreed




Personally, I believe that you should be able to load the LHyd equivalent
of 44 gallon drums of AvGas onto your gig at the downport, and then
transfer them back off the gig and into the tanks. It\'s a bitch of a job,
but it strikes me as doable (the airport at Currie on King Island used 44
gallon drums of avgas to refuel the light planes that landed on the
island).
************
But do they do that for the tramp freighters that dock at the port?  or a
better example, does the freighter send a launch in to pick up the drums
and take them out to refuel the freighter?



Now, according to p119 of G:T it takes 18 minutes to escape Earth\'s
gravitational field at 2 gees, so I\'d say that a one hour round trip is
reasonable.
***********
and an unstreamlined free trader with a gig will take 19 hours to do a full
load (it can unload at the same time though). it will either take a full
day or it wil  need 3 pilots for the shuttle.....hrm have to take another
crewman or two wages out of the profits

I am perfectly happy with the level of streamlining on a modern surface
ship (ie it\'s a cow ... dont expect to play with grav fighters in the
atmosphere) being available, just as long as it costs less than 20% of the
volume of the ship.
Make \'partial streamlining\' cost 10% of ship volume, maximum 10 dtons, and
I\'ll come to the party. Stubby wings, minimal lift, blobs of plastic over
the sensor arrays ...

************
the unstreamlined ships have this already. what they don\'t have is landing
gear and they can not do a balistic reentry. so where another ship would
have a half hor or so trip it would have several hours and would have to
worry much more about atmospheric conditions.  When it reached the surface,
it would have to find some water to land in (most ships can float).

Even for non-fatal misjumps, GT\'s figures are an order of magnitude higher
than any other version of Traveller.  Loren is considering an erratum,
amidst the other thousand things occupying his attention.

Sidenote:  anyone else notice that, contrary to every other version, the
*direction* of misjumps in GT isn\'t random? It has a strong negative
correlation with the intended direction of jump (average: 3.25 hexsides
away from jump direction).  Until that gets fixed, just fire up your
Suleiman\'s jump drive within 10 diameters, aim in the direction opposite
where you want to go, and hello, Jump-10 Courier!

  Remember, the Imperium has most of its\' mobile fleet assets kept back
from the border to minimze the risk of the enemy defeating it in detail
after achieving strategic surprise. But the principle does hold.

  This is a heck of a good point, and may be the underpinning of Zho

No less so than the British East India Company, which routinely did
business in this fashion. Or ANY international corporation in the 18th
and 19th centuries, including, at a guess, _most_ of the Dutch
nation...the Netherlands got very very rich trading in that fashion.
Closer to your home, look at the Hanseatic League...travel times were
easily a week or two between most ports, were they not?

The Asian Silk Caravan route rediscovered by Marco Polo took months or
years to complete a round trip, yet there were a lot of traders willing
to make the trips, and it formed one of the bases of the Renaissance
economic boom of Italy.

If you can\'t get , for instance, tea on your home world, what you\'ll
risk to get it becomes much greater.

No, competing against locally produced goods is rarely profitable, but
when there is no local supply...

Yes and No? I tend to base my image of traveller on the Age of exploration. So you
could have it both ways. From the wild eyed Fanatical Atheist preaching
that science is the one true god, to the coldly mercenary missionary "converting"
the heathen to the orthodoxy of the state, the potential for great rivalry is
there.

We can argue and get twisted up over our own personal belief systems.

OR.

Why don\'t we look at what kind of beliefs can exist within our common
frame of reference ( i.e. Traveller ).

Now that is said, lets get to work.

In history we have many various forms of religion and beliefs.
IMTU, the Church exists as a reformed conglomeration religions
that descended from the followers of Abraham ( i.e. Christian, Judaism, and
Islam ). The church is strongest in the Solomani rim and the Marches.
Most players get involved by doing things like rescue the missionary, or 
we don\'t have any money to pay you, but this medicine is desperately needed
but is illegal, etc. etc.

Other flavors of religions I haven\'t worked out in quite the same amount of
detail.

Anyone have any ideas what the main or dominant religions of the other
Major races would look like?

	Worst table I have seen in years, and probably the only problem 
which I have found with G:S so far (otherwise, I recommend to have 
it around). In this table, almost all Radii are "0.0," because data 
is with only one digit precision. Totally useless for Traveller

fine for me. I know that a lot more realism can be added, but it\'s 
Quick&Dirty enough. I wonder why it can only be found there...

There is a general feeling that the presence of multiple stars in a system
might disrupt the planet-formation process, unless the stars are very close
or very distant - but this is a vague theoretical idea; observationally, 
binary systems seem to have more protoplanetary disks and close gas-giant
planets (the only kind we can detect) than one might expect.

Secondly, (again depending on the orbits of the stars) you\'ll get variations
in temperature due to being nearer or farther from each star with time - 
probably only a few percent variations for most cases, but that might make
climates unstable.

>Does anyone know if there is a "rule of thumb" scientists use when 
>looking for stars that might support habitable planets?

Generally one expects habitable planets around sunlike single stars, but
that might just be our prejudice showing. Very massive stars are probably
too short-lived to develop life (which you need for a breathable atmosphere)
and too bright to have a habitable zone at the radii where most planets might
form; very low-mass stars would require habitable planets to be so close they
get tidally locked; but overall, we really don\'t understand star and planet
formation very well.

  Both :) Lots of 5FW/TCS players could give you their opinions on stuff
from the way the OTU-based games play out, although TCS strategic results
are highly dependent on how the ref handles things. A discussion on fleet

  Ouch (IAC, the Zho\'s only make J5 stuff, but J-6 capital ships are

Wrong, wrong, very wrong, and wrong again.  Don\'t confuse your
religiousity about your god Science with facts.  We have no reason to
believe that modern science isn\'t at least 90% quackery, just as it
has always been.  I was very careful to ask for facts.  You can
obviously offer none.

The nature of truth is that it is a literal thing.  IQ 136, how about
you?

> Speak for yourself. I "serve" no-one and idolize nothing.

So deep in your pet beliefs that you leave no room for any opinion but
your own.  A true fanatic about your religion.

Young species?  As compared to what?  You\'ve been watching too much
Star Trek.  Perhaps you should try that quaint little "crutch" analogy
on the kiddies.  The grown-ups know that it is analogous to a
stretcher or ambulance, carrying people to where they cannot get to on
their own.

If regurgitating humanistic rhetoric is all you can offer, don\'t
bother entering a serious discussion.

The problem is that Alpha Centauri A/B combuine to make life unlikely.  To
much light, not much of a chance of a habital planet for us.

Figure the habitle zone.  This is the distance where a star would provide a
similar amount of energy to a planet as we get from ol\'Sol at 1 AU.

Exceedingly generous.

Neither.  The Centauri are indeed humanlike (when we first meet them they
claimed *we* were a lost Centauri colony!) but have significant physical
differences.

You\'re right, you\'re reading too much into my phrasing.  That\'s not what I
said (or believe).  Just that the US was the primary consumer base for
Traveller.  This is true w/ G:T (any metric translations yet?) and will
probably do so for T5.

Err...  Haven\'t seen much of it.  Maybe BtC & some of T4 (though i haven\'t
looked at more than 4 of its titles).  Haven\'t seen a BITS 101 book or
anything (and I am quite interested in a couple of them... please get US
distribution...).

The Solomani were still on the Gregorian calendar to the Collapse, it seems.
The Vilani might\'ve gone to the Sylean (Imperial) calendar, though Vilani
supremacists would maintain the Ziru Sirka\'s.  And of course, NE looks to
replace Imperial Year in the New Era, though it\'s just a take off from the
Imperial calendar in year 1201.

Yup.  For my part, I didn\'t bite that trolling.  IMO, DGP handled it pretty
good in the WBH (though i notice all the world profiles in the alien modules
don\'t have religious profiles).  Religion is something pretty fundamental to
man, though.  That said, in the most religious societies, there have been
skeptics and in the most secular, there have been the pious, but religion has
always been there, so far.  Man has a need to believe in *something*, even if
that\'s only himself (or science, etc).

Err...  Yaskoydray didn\'t seed Earth.  That wouldn\'t change anything regarding
the validity or no of any human religion in the OTU.  We don\'t have any
lizard-man gods, do we? ; )  The Ancients don\'t seem the type to play Vorlon,
either, IMO.

The OTU, like many RPGs, doesn\'t touch on religion because it\'s impossible not
to get someones panties tied in a knot.  Religious people will be antagonized
if their religion is put in a negative light (much less have their beliefs
mocked) and the anti-religious will be antagonized if any religion is put in a
good (or validating) light, therefore, it\'s mute on the subject.  There will
be alot of people (including the purely areligious) in between, somewhere in
the middle.

We don\'t even need to go back really all too far. In the late 80s or so,
with the advent of cheap and efficient competition the mail service (at
least here in America) changed considerably.

Currently we have the federal run mail service, cheap, relatively efficient
and good if you don\'t need your delivery to get there in time. We also have
two independent companies, UPS and Federal Express that send mail and
packages much faster.

There is no reason to believe that the Xboat network is the only option.
People would pay for faster service, and they would pay whatever the market
could bear.

The way I envision it (and my beliefs are usually at least slightly
non-canon) there are other alternatives on a subsector-wide basis, a
sector-wide basis, and possibly a domain-wide basis as well.

Just because canon doesn\'t mention it doesn\'t mean that it can\'t happen.

(Hans, this isn\'t really directed to you, these are just general comments on
the whole thread up to now)

Yes.  Even worse is the way in which the table ignores sub-classes
completely (that is, there\'s an entry for G-v class stars, but no clue
as to how the various parameters scale from G0v down to G9v).  Ouch.

Well, commisions in the US are higher.  Now even that may not
phase you and that is typical of the reaction one gets.
The usual response from those who hear all these tales of
making killings in the stock market is that you can make
a lot of money by trading fast and often on the latest news.
The reality is that very few people make a lot of money at
this.  Most long term  investors know that the commisions
add up in this approach and buy and hold is the best strategy.

The guy who is wondering if he should set up an X-boat network
cares.  What you describe is a justification for the guy
paying the fastest ship you can find to carry a message.
Not for having an entire network of ships
running around in case such a message comes along.

Neither of these have any indication of speed.

A good route without wasting too much time.  Not having the
fastest ships available making calls to every port on a routine
basis.  The former is much like the X-boat network as described.
The later would be more like a jump-6 network.

I agree.  It shows that in a society not set up on fast communications
(such as ours is) that saving every last bit of time is not essential
for most communications.

I still don\'t see the point.  Nobody has ever argues that the
cost of putting data on a ship would make any differnce in
anything.  The questions is whether their is so much info
that can\'t stand an extra 33% to shipping time that it warrants
having jump-6 ships leaving every few days, to a week, from
every significant port.

Exactly, and very few communications are going to make much a difference
to most naval communications if they take a little longer to get there.
Now there are almost certainly jump-6 couriers attached to fleets and
headquarters, but that is a long way from any network of jump-6
communications.

Well, aside from the fact that various assumptions could just a

Why are they willing to commit 0.5% of annual revenues.  This
the mistake that people make on this list over and over, assume
that some small fraction of a large organizations budget is
available for anything that sounds useful.

If LSP makes a 10% return on revenue, you are talking about
loosing 5% of their net profit for the year.  You better
believe they are going to do this only if they can justify
it as providing increased returns.

But even if it was only 0.005% of annual revenue, they won\'t
do it unless the returns justify it.

Or if the mercs are ex-Imperial Marines.

A general thought on mercs, though.  A lot of RW mercenaries are actually
in regular regiments, like the French Foreign Legion, the Papal Swiss
Guard, or the British Gurkhas.  No doubt there will be TU equivalents of
this.  If you want a non-faceless/generic Army regiment, make them
something like this.

Of course, there was a charming practice back in the 17th/18th century,
where minor states, particularly in Germany, would actually hire out units
from their regular army as mercenaries.  I\'m not sure if the Hessians in
the American Revolution were in this category or not.  Anyway, you could
quite easily find bits of a planet\'s regular forces on some other world in
the TU.

Of course, the Imperium might not be too impressed, but such "regular"
mercs would potentially be better  disciplined and more controllable than
the riff-raff of freelance warlords.

The Zhodani are done in great detail from race creation (or kidnapping) to
present, the vargr also. I REALLY liked the write up, the history, the epic
grandure.

However. The three minor races (which were preveously presented in ICE\'s
Aliens and artifacts) are a one eye combative lizard race (a kind of green
popeye dude) and multi armed web speaking spider race and gas giant bunnies
(just kidding) gas giant race. (Hmm they could start charging for skimming!!)

I was disappointed in the fact that instead of new races we were given
converted races from another gaming source (Not even from traveller GASP). 


Personnally I seem to have expected more. They were well written. I did
enjoy seeing them. but...

Don\'t get me too wrong, but for $20 I expect to see at least one new race.

No, not really. Only the really wealthy can afford even a small priority
network. Thnik about this: more than half of all US buisinesses rely on the
US mail (average delivery time, 3 days local, a week for inter
town/interstate).

FedEx is 20 times more expensive to use, as is overnight US post.

Priority mail is about 7 times mroe expensive, and is US post for "2-3 days"

A private network must generate enough long-distance high value or time
critical material to support the lowest cargo:drive ratio available. few
organizations will be able to afford the dedicated J-5 and J-6 nets
discussed. A few might conglomerate to create a "publically available" net
for special purposes, something like FedEx. IMTU, most "Crucial trade
information" is going to be within J-4 from point of origin to point of
use. Something a single courrier can handle for "Emergent" info....

Think on this, too: Jump-6 couriers, arriving daily... Well, by the
mechanics of Jump Exit, you could wind up with as much as 3 days with no
arrivals, and then have 3 arrive. Daily arrivals example:
1,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,2,0,1,0,3,0,1,1.... Assuming a single linkage, to
have one in and one out, you need 10 (3 days recovery time and thus a 10
day schedule... leaving 6-8 in jump at any given time, each way) Each way,
plus spares, per link! A "Daily" x-mail system needs about 10 per link each
direction. A twice weekly needs about 4. IMTU, it\'s 6 per link, 3 each
way... roughly every 3 days. J-6 X-boats will also be significantly more
expensive than J4.

I would think that anything Vilani would be based around food/ancients/their

I would think the Aslan religion(s) would be bi-theistic (male and female

Vargr is anything goes... (though canon mentions a church...I can\'t remember
it)

K\'kree is nicely covered in GT...

Droyne...Hmm... Ancestor worship (especially grandfather)?

Hiver...I don\'t know; maybe god as the great six armed manipulator?

Zhodani... hmm...god is the great Psionisist, or the other extreme, would the
thought police condone religion, or maybe only the "proper" one (ie the nobles
find a safe religion for the proles while they are either non religious or
maybe are involved in something honoring Droyne)?

Lastly; as pertains to the great pro-anti religion flamewar....how about
Atheism and/or rationalism evolving into a religion. I have seen theories that
modern Psychology is being treated as a psuedo-religion by some shrinks (it\'s
concepts becoming dogma...)

Yeah, but the occaison chance to make a big killing won\'t support
and X-boat kind of system.  It will support hiring a ship on
a one time basis to carry the message.

Again, they had a fast ship dedicated to that one need.  They
didn\'t build those ships in a such numbers that they were
visiting all significant ports on a routine basis (if they did,
those ships wouldt be special).

Connecting the 3-400 most important worlds is the same as connecting
all signifcant ports.  Connecting every world would be like
connecting every city, town, villiage, and hamlet.

Well, if you want to say the X-boat network should have been set
up with different routes, I will not gainsay you (I make no
commitment either way).  But the idea that there _must_ be system
of jump-6 ships parralelling the x-boat network I don\'t buy at all.

And who long does it have to wait at that node?  The point is
that any scheme has to have service that is frequent otherwise
a lot of the time savings is lost.

Well, I will agree that _all_ messages going by X-boats is
a bit much.  There will always be a specialized market that
a few jump-6 ships can tap into (for example, hang out
at Regina and jump to Mora as soon as the results of the
the bid on naval contracts is announced).  I can see
this being a side activity that doesn\'t much impact the
general distribution of news.

That assumes there is a jump-6 courier that just happens to be
going your way.  That means frequent jump-6 service on all the
places where you are saying it will replace jump-4 service.
Furthermore, if a more expensive ship it going to take the
message, they will either have to charge _everyone_ more to
take the message, or find some way of singling out only those
who wouldn\'t pay more and giving them a discount (a tricky
proposition at best).

Will all the traffic along that route be willing to pay more for a
33% decrease in transit time?  Are messages that need the
increased speed freqent enough to justify the service?
That is debatable.
