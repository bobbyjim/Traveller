I thought that was presented as a "what if" type thing and not anything that
was supposed to be taken as "official."  It\'s clear that in the official
timeline, they were bogus, as Strephon claims to have never heard of them in
Survival Margin and pondered that Lucan just didn\'t want to admit his
ignorance and/or undercut his claim to the Iridium Throne by playing along
with them at all.

While the cloak and dagger type campaign (or rather occassional
adventure/mission to my preference) is fun, spy work is really rather
unglamorous with most intelligence being done at terminals, gathering data,
analysists, etc.  Not much James Bond stuff, but what the hey.  All of that
aside, anything with any amount of people involved shows that conspiracies,
especially by a governmental agency, always has incompetants, boobs, dorks and
morons who spill the beans on some unsavory operation or incident that brings
that \'burueau\' to a close. 

In a govt like that of the late 3I, one ruled by men and not by laws, let
someone powerful (sector duke up, definately) get wind of IRIS and become
opposed somehow  and they\'d go the way of the dodo.  At the very least,
they\'ll get caught in subtle gears of manipulation, if not falling to direct
interference.  Read up on the Bavarian Illuminati, Knights Templar, and the
government/intelligence agency of your choice.   The Nazi\'s Odessa might go in
here, too.

In general, I consider anything done by GDW to be "canon."  Now Traveller and
the 3I evolved, of course, and the general consensus on the Imperium in G:T
(c1999, Real Life) is far far different than that when the first few LBBs were
all that there were (c1977-80).  

DGP was the most successful 3rd party producer for Traveller, it seems, and
their stuff was well done, even if it wasn\'t always exactly consistent w/ GDW
and/or MMs Traveller Universe.  IG, and T4/M:0, I lump in w/ the other 3rd
party stuff like Judges Guild, Paranoia Press, and FASA (etc).  It looks like
Traveller and is interesting for data mining, but is very poor at sometimes
even internal consistency, much less with anything by GDW and/or the official
universe/timeline.  I guess I lump G:T in here, too.

M:0 is very suspect to me.  I bought it w/ the intention (like G:T) of finding
some use for it with my TNE campaigns.  Neither seems to be working well (M:0
for various reasons, G:T because my budding Regency campaigns always get put
on the backburner).  I am going to probably be waiting to see if the "G:T
mysteries" are going to be explored at all.  My intention is to review Far
Trader and First In and w/o seeing them am probably at bout 40/60 against on
getting them, w/o the results of a first impression from holding one in my
hand.  ;-)

I doubt that will ever happen.  Unless he sets up some sort of publishing
thing for himself and/or reserves such a clause for himself.  Even if MM\'s not
busy w/o other ventures of "Far Futures Enterprises" or his personal endeavors
(assuming these are seperate), micromanaging like that can doubtfully lead to
anything good, as it\'s likely going to piss someone off regardless, so it\'s
probably more prudent to ignore it.  Many issues, like jump torps as one
example, can be explained by many factors.  3 out of 4 versions of Traveller,
J-torps are permissible or explicitly allowed (and i\'ll bet there\'s an MT one
lurking somewhere).  The reasons they\'re not used can be handwaved by many
possiblities.  Hmm...  are J-torps doable w/ G:Vehicles?  4 of 5?  ;-)  I
would tend to doubt they are w/ the G:T system, but I can\'t say, as I\'ve done
more than glance at it.

Of course, the consistency of Previously Published Material (AKA "canon") is
relative to the beholder, and the debate over "canon" is almost always in grey
areas. There are stark instances, though, that are obviously against the grain
of PPM, though.  These usually occur when there\'s ignorance (or an extreme
dislike and deliberate ignoring) of PPM.  Both are ok if unknowing (especially
if it\'s over some minutia), but are rather distasteful (if not disgusting) if
deliberate and/or obvious.  The value of canon is a universe/background that\'s
consistent with previously published material.  To me, this is the "historical
facts" and events of "Imperial Space" and nothing to do with rules specific
minutia.  The evolving and dynamic background/setting of Traveller through
it\'s editions (including M:0, but *not* G:T IMO only, as if it needs to be
said) is a plus, to me.  If GDW went belly-up in 87 instead of 95, Traveller
would be much less known IMO, even if only to attrition (though a loss of wide
appeal IMO).  The copyright holder/current publisher doesn\'t mean squat to me.
If I can make it useful, I\'m better disposed to buy it.  

Some people seem to see it as someone elses vision/capaign/universe being
forced on them.  None of the publishers, to my knowledge anyways, sent their
thugs out to make sure the "proper" version was being played.  It\'s just not
possible to please all the people, all the time.  We have many here (or at
least did) who don\'t even like the Fifth Frontier War, for good Ghul\'s sake!
All they want is the 3I of 1105 to be further fleshed out, from all the
corners with library data and UWP for the whole nine yards, which just ain\'t
gonna happen (Officially, anyways).  Others like a small timeframe with
variation and expansion possible.  Alot of MT\'ers and G:T\'ers probably go in
here.  1105-1120 w/ or w/o the Rebellion.  Those who just don\'t like the
Imperium setting (like me), but who stay in the OTU/timeline and go up to
where MT was heading (even w/o the apparent exact methods) w/ alot of smaller
powers and polities interacting in former Imperial Space.  Besides, the PPM
(aka "canon") can still be usable (though it doesn\'t have to be).  Course, I
can easily imagine the use of every TNE product as supportive for a Imperial
campaign, too...

conversion job using CT-LBB6 (Scouts), GT and G:Lensman.

Anyway, the nearest I could get for Trenco is X-5A000A-0, with a Navy

feet and five inches\' of liquid precipitate overnight, only to evapourate
within minutes of dawn.  There are other effects but I won\'t list \'em unless
someone asks...

Zabriska (aka A-Zabriskae II) approximates to X-300000-0 with nothing to
recommend it other than a complete lack of... well, everything really.

Unfortunately (and bearing in mind someone else\'s post - sorry, I cannot
remember whose it was!), a lot of what seperates these from any other
planets with the same UPP is in the text descriptions of these planets -
which means I might run afoul of Copyright if I put it all on the net...  On
the other hand, if anyone wants to email me
(jeff.rowse@farnhome.freeserve.co.uk) then I might be able to \'paraphrase\'
enough of the G:L text for their purposes...

IG the company had problems.  But some of the products were first rate.
And long overdue additions to the Traveller universes.  If it weren\'t for
T4, I probably would never have gotten back into Traveller at all.

Aw, don\'t say that.  I\'ve got a copy of Far Trader in my hands right now.
And its absolutely beautiful.  Especially that part with my name on the cover.
:-)  Sorry, but I can\'t be objective about the contents.  The art however,
I had nothing to do with and its excellent!  Far Trader is IMHO adaptable
to any Traveller settings.

There are three opinions:

#1
one point defence turret is so effective against missiles (and cheap,
low power, low tech, etc) that you fit one and then the rest of your
lasers are free to shoot at the enemy ship without worry.

#2
one point defence turret is so effective against missiles (and cheap,
low power, low tech, etc) that no one in their right minds would ever
fit missiles to a ship, all the missile companies have gone bankrupt
and you don\'t need a point defence turret.

#3
as long as everyone else believes in #2, your missiles will either get
through or tie up the enemy main batteries.

:-)

Also note that under FFS2, the number of hardpoints restriction seems to
have gone, to be replaced by area restrictions. Even under High Guard,
A PD weapon could be one turret versus an anti-ship array which could
be ten triple turrets. In High guard, you cannot have both but in T4
you can, so a couple of PD turrets will probably fit into the rounding
errors on a T4 design.

Dedicated ships work in theory but don\'t be sidetracked by modern
naval fleets. If the Earth was flat and guns and missiles had the
same range, then my gun ships could shoot your anti-missile ships
leaving you defenceless against my missile ships.

However, using something small (like fighters) against missiles does
seem to make sense because it gives the defender two layers of missile
defence.

IMHO the combining weapons into batteries rules are broken.

With a 10 weapon battery, you have three choices:

	(a) all fire at the same time and same spot.
 	(b) fire at different times at the same spot.
	(c) fire at the same time but at small distance offsets.

clearly:

	(a) increases penetration (and damage a bit) equal to one larger laser
	(b) increases damage (since it won\'t be exactly the same target cm2)
	(c) increases the chance to hit

My guess would be that 10x75Mj leaser firing in mode (a) would be
equivalent to 1x750Mj laser. But, apparently no:

	 1x75Mj    USP: 1    (USP:  2 if rof 100+)
	 1x750Mj   USP: 2    (USP:  4 if rof 200+)
	10x75Mj    USP: 6    (USP: 10 if rof 800+)

(assuming inside effective range.)

Also, improving the USP by increasing the ROF (instead of increasing the
to hit bonus) seems a bit wrong.

(btw, I think that the change in factor to 12-4-4-3 is a bug in the
 spreadsheet: the formula only includes the number of weapons at short
 range. If each turret has one laser and you have a 10 turret battery
 the USP is something like 12-12-12-11)

If instead you use the CUSP stats:

	 1x75Mj    CUSP: 13/ 7    (penetration/damage)
	 1x750Mj   CUSP: 16/10
	10x75Mj    CUSP: 13/13

so CUSP is clearly using mode(b) and ROF only affects the "to hit" roll.

(btw CUSP is Bruce Alan Macintosh\'s combat system for T4. I\'m not sure
 the T4 actually has an official starship combat system that works.)

If someone could post CUSP or a webpage where it is to be found, please?

IMHO the combining weapons into batteries rules are broken.

With a 10 weapon battery, you have three choices:

	(a) all fire at the same time and same spot.
 	(b) fire at different times at the same spot.
	(c) fire at the same time but at small distance offsets.

clearly:

	(a) increases penetration (and damage a bit) equal to one larger laser
	(b) increases damage (since it won\'t be exactly the same target cm2)
	(c) increases the chance to hit

Laser batteries in High Guard seem to use (c), for the most part. The main
effect of increased laser weapon factor (which you get from having more
turrets per battery) is an improved chance to hit, and an improved chance
to get through sandcasters. It\'s only with very small ships (under 900tns)
that you do any additional damage, and even that is often negated by
armor.

Well, it _could_ be the first clues that the US is becoming an empire in
name, as well as in fact :-)  

I was tempted, when I first got GT, to make all the units in "GT Shipyard"
truly Imperial instead of the wierd mixture used in the book. Laser output
in BTU, anyone?  Mass in slugs, volume in Imperial gallons...

In the end, I decided to stick with what was in the book, with the
addition of metric for myself.

My upcoming programs for GT (a Metator rewrite to fit the GT rules) will
also do this.

IRIS was officially a variant, that got written into almost all the
products that Chuck Gannon (the author) did for GDW.  I never liked it,
and always ignored references to it. After all, that\'s what variants are
for :-)

If I was going to use it, I would probably use something like Richard\'s

Besides, what he\'s talking about is *Even Better*.  A Metator rewrite at
last!!! (Sounds of great rejoicing in the background).

Rob, Metator is the single most useful program I\'ve had the pleasure of
using for Traveller.  Want to know if there\'s a planetoid belt?  How about
a ring on that Gas Giant?  How far is the jump point...30 minuites or 30
hours?

I hope you will, in the spirit of the original program, leave a few spaces
open for user input (as the starship encounter tables were).  And if you
want to discuss possible trade table scenarios, let me know (I do not have
the T:G version of any such tables, I think they would be in the
to-be-published Far TRader supplement anyway).  I have thought a lot about
such things and have some large tables in process.

I\'m working on/plan to release a freeware Striker vehicle
design application for Win95/NT/98 later this summer.  I\'ve
got to finish some upgrades for the Fire on the Suns Battle
Engine and V_MAP before I devote most of my free time to it.

It?  Gee, I have a basic design laid out and I haven\'t even
bothered to name it.  I guess I can call it the SDF for now.  :-)

Well, your asking for a lot of text, but I\'ll post somewhat and paraphrase
where possible;

Basic Mainworld Generation;

System Presence - based on sector density
Density       Roll
Rift         12+ on 2D
Sparse       6+ on 1D
Scattered    5+ on 1D
Standard     4+ on 1D
Dense        3+ on 1D

Starport  Roll 2d on this table;

Die    Backwater   Standard   Mature   Cluster
2        A           A          A         A
3        A           A          A         A
4        B           A          A         A
5        B           B          B         A
6        C           B          B         B
7        C           C          C         B
8        C           C          C         C
9        D           D          D         C
10       E           E          E         D
11       E           E          E         E
12       X           X          E         X
Backwater - out of mainstream interstellar culture and communication
Standard - is the expected norm
Mature - an older established system
Cluster - Many worlds close together.

Size 2D-2  Size = thousands of miles diameter (yes, miles)

Atmosphere 2D-7+size; basically 0 is vacuum, 1=trace, 2-3 are very thin,
4-5 is thin, 6-7 is standard, 8-9 is dense, A+ is Exotic in various ways.
2,4,7, and 9 are tainted.

Hydrographics; 2D-7+Size, if Size 1- Hyd=0, if atm is 1- or A+, apply -4
DM.  The number is the percent water of the surface area.

Population 2D-2 (No modifiers!).  Result is an "order of magnitude" for
pop.  i.e. 0 is 0-9 people, 1 is 10-99 people, etc.

Government 2D-7+pop.  I\'m not going to go over all the possible results.  4
is representative democracy, 7 is balkanized, 0 is no government, A is
charismatic dictator.

Law Level; 2D-7+gov.  0 is no law, 1-3 is "low" law, 4-7 is "moderate" and
8-9 is "High.  A+ is "extreme" and the table goes to L which reads "Totally
Oppressive and Restrictive".  Big Brother time.

Tech Level; Roll 1D and add all possible modifiers from Tl Mod table.  No
I\'m not reproducing that table (I\'ve come close enough to copyright
infringement as it is).  Basically, A,B,and C starports get +6, +4, and +2
respectively, X gets -4, small worlds get bonuses, unbreathable atmospheres
get +1 (but not tainted ones), A+ Hydrographics get +1, populations other
than 0 or 6-8 get plusses, and certain gov\'ts get +1 or -2.

Navy and Scouts are determined based on starport and a 2D roll.

Trade Classsifications are too complicated for this forum.

Supplemental remarks (such as Research Station of Subsector Capital) are
determined by the referee.

Pop Multiplier is simply a random 0-9 roll (using 1D6...interesting).

Gas Giants are present on a 5+ on 2D.

Planetoids belts are present on 8+ on 2D

Travel zones are generally determined by thereferee, but certain high
law/high government codes will trigger and automatic amber or red
classification.

Allegiance is determined by context and referee.

That\'s about it.  The extended system generation starts with this and adds
a bunch of other details, pretty much along the lines of the WBH.  I don\'t
have T4 here to compare with, but I remember it being pretty close to MT.

Actually, the crewstation is in the body (and the \'real\' volume of a GT missile
is about 4.3 cf, the remaining space requirement is for streamlining).  As it
happens, the missile launcher is quite small (which is not actually
unreasonable, missile launchers _are_ small) so while one could argue that the
feed mechanism should be a bit larger, it isn\'t really all that unreasonable.

Of course, there\'s no requirement that you fill a missile rack anyway -- I
probably wouldn\'t give your average merchant more than 10-20 missiles per
launcher, missiles are expensive and its not like you\'re very likely to be able
to use up that many.

Hm...while its unclear what sort of material \'sand\' is in any case, most of the
obvious candidates have significantly lower density than that.  Certainly sand
is less dense than this.

Sand is probably assumed to fill 1 cf/50 lb in GT, which is the \'default\'
density for any unknown material.  That means that, including packing, it\'s
less dense than water (note that the missiles are too).

This will give you a good idea of the ratio of open, common spaces to

Well, I didn\'t say it was EXACTLY Traveller.  It just captures the feel I
go for in many of my games.  It was much more Traveller than, say, The
Fifth Element.

The rules are mainly for  pre-G:Traveller systems

I\'m looking for a simple (and fast) mechanic for use in specials cases, so
hypercomplex systems are out.


2d6    Area    Damage    To Hit
roll    Hit    Mod       mod.

 12+    Head    x2        -5
10-11  Vitals   x2        -5
 8-9    Arms    x1/2      -4 (opt. hands:-6)
 5-7   Torso    x1        -2
  4    Thighs   x1        -3
  3-    Legs    x1/2      -5 (opt. feet:-6)

After having determined if a hit lands, roll 2d6 and consult the table.
Area hit: Torso includes abdomen and shoulders. Arms include hands, and
legs include feet.

Damage modifier is optional, but multipliers should be applied *after*
having counted armor effects. Remember that if you apply both these
rules and any other "critical" system (like the -5 for double damage
rule in T4) fights could be much bloodier.

To hit mod is used when someone wants to target a specific body part.

In some instances you may apply small modifiers to this roll, for
example, using short melee weapons (fists, clubs, broken bottles or
knives) you should roll 2d6+1. A small animal would probably use a 2d6-1,
unless, it dropped from the above...

BITS originally supported this but don\'t anymore. However, last time I
checked, the author, Jo Grant, had the source code on his site, and may
have had the program. I can\'t remember the direct URL, but it is linked via
BITS (http://www.bits.org.uk) on the Products page, under discontinued
products.

\'Honour\' ;-)

I thought that one of our Canadian Comrades would jump in and claim calling
\'American\' units \'Imperial\' was proof of the true intent of the capitalist
military-industrial complex?

Anyay, it can\'t be in *my* honour - I was born post decimalisation (which
kind of coincides with creeping metrication).

Actually, I used to reference weight against a 1lb bag of sugar, but now
it\'s mass against a 500g bag... I know what you mean about the less
intuitive dimensions, but a metre is kind of a stretched yard...

Me? I started with Basic (the blue covered book pre-red box) D&D, CoC 2nd
Edition and Traveller Starter Edition; what\'s more, as a kid I couldn\'t
afford to buy loads of source material which was why Traveller with Books 1
through 5 was so good. I do occasionally get cravings for a dungeon crawl,
or a tomb to explore, but it\'s not that common now.

I thought the true heretic would be grey?

Okay, I\'ll admit it. As a kid, back in 77/78 when we used to play Star Wars
in the playground and I was 7 or 8, I used to always get to play Darth
Vader, as I was the tallest. My friend always played Skywalker because he
was called Luke. We drastically reshaped Lucas\' plot as the Dark side won
and tried to throttle Luke until a teacher pointed out it wasn\'t a good
idea. But we stayed friends.

Obtrav? Well, without Star Wars I wouldn\'t be playing this game, that and
the Foundation Series and Andre Norton some three or four years later.

The general UWP is the same with AXXXXXX-TL PBG as the format. Some trade
classifications have changed. The actual method of calculating is unchanged.

However, the UWP data in the First Survey and MO books was generated by
regressing the old Imperial Atlas (CT) data (IIRC) using a computer
program. This has never been released to my knowledge, and was flawed
(witness the Law Level = Gov error), and not checked against canon. Carlos,
Volker and some others have corrected M0 data on websites. The Missouri
Archive, linked off BITS (Jumpsite) had the complete First Survey Data as a
download file.

Hope this helps,

Dom

Email Marc Miller at FarFuture@aol.com and ask him (nicely ;-) ) to send
you a copy of the T4.1/T5 playtest draft. If you want the new task levels
quickly, they\'re given on the combat cribsheet on the BITS site, on the
archive page.

T4.1/T5 has an improved character generation system and task system. The
combat you basically use as is T4 at the moment (a more detailed system is
coming though). I would recommend finding High Guard for Classic Traveller
to use for starships.

Basically; multiple lasers in a battery are firing at (nearly) the same
time at (nearly) the same spot; they don\'t hit within a cm of each other - 
so each hit as to penetrate the armour by itself, multiple weapons don\'t
help penetration - but they do generally hit the same system and so their
damage gets added together. In fact, as you can see, this is a more efficient
way to damage a target than one big laser, as long as you can penetrate
the armour (which makes sense; lots of little hits are a good way to damage
an unarmoured target.)

ROF does primarily affect the "to hit" roll - which indirectly affects
damage; for each two points you make the to-hit roll by, damage is increased
by one point up to a maximum of your ROF.

>(btw CUSP is Bruce Alan Macintosh\'s combat system for T4.
>If someone could post CUSP or a webpage where it is to be found, please?

It\'s not on the web yet. I\'m still in-between drafts (trying to tweak point
defence so it works and adding damage control rules and some general
cleaning up.) I can email copies of the work-in-progress to anyone who is
heavily interested...if I ever have a couple of weekends with not much to do
(ha!) I hope to finish it and post it here.

I actually call the thing "MCS", for "Military Combat System" - or, if I\'m
feeling grandiose, "Fusion Guard".

Anyway, it was a long time ago and I\'ve forgotten most of the plot, so I\'ll
try to sum it up as best I can (I think it was a short story).  A group of
IISS scout types land on a planet for repairs and proceed to go about their
business.  A few hours later one of their party is found dead-- she had
been shot.  Not a sound was heard and the group quickly set up a perimeter
to protect against the "sniper".  Another scout goes down and the group
opens fire in all directions, oblivious to the actual direction of the
attack.

Finally, a loud metallic bang is heard and the group finds a hefty dent on
the outside of a whatever they were using for ground transport.  On the
ground they find the badly mangled remains of some sort of flying insect.
High speed footage later proved that the planet was host to a strange form
of flying insect possessing an extremely hard armoured carapace, which
could fly at extremely high-- yet still subsonic-- velocities.

So, a PD turret is a good thing to have around :)  Thanks to Swordworlder, I
now have a copy of BL in my hot little hands, yet I\'ve run into a bit more
confusion.  There seems to be no specific reference to PD weapons.  Are they
allowed to engage multiple targets?  Specifically, how are PD turrets
handled? To be effective, I would think that a single turret would be firing
on a number of incoming missiles each turn.  (I know the answers should be
obvious, but without a reference I must ask :)

I had noticed that the hardpoint restriction was no longer in effect, but I
had generally enforced it in my designs so that I could easily compare my
designs to others.  (And to keep the torch-wielding villagers at bay)  I
hadn\'t thought of taking advantage of a bit of rounding.  That will solve a
bit of my dilemma.

Excellent point.  I was wrestling with with where to draw the line on
dedicated ships.  Also, I thought of using ships equipped entirely with beam
weapons in a two-fold role; Fleet defense and long range operations.

In fleet operations they would concentrate on shooting down enemy fighters
and missiles.  They would have the added benifit of being able to operate on
long range missions with a minimum of supply.  Needing only rations and
other consumables, they could conceivably carry everything they would need
in their own cargo holds.  Thus needing fewer support vessels.

I hadn\'t thought of that either.  I like the idea of fighters, and anything
that justifies their existance and helps define their role is helpful.

<<Lots of great info snipped>>

Thanks for the breakdown, and the very specific examples.  Defining A,B, and
C above helps tremendously.
Also, I had thought that there were some problems in the calculations, but
being a bit mathematically challenged I couldn\'t quite figure out the
answer(s) with any confidence.

What makes an encountered "monster" the most terrifying?
</rogerbarr@hotmail.com>

Well, I\'m personally a big fan of teleportation, though it can be
overused.  A teleporting baddy can pop in on you when you least expect it
and can disappear before you take him out.  Very unerving and frustrating
to PCs.

Another bugger is mental domination.  Someone else mentioned the ability
to make people "sleepy", that\'s a good one.  Another is total control,
forcing one PC to attack another.  I faced this a couple of weeks ago as a
player in a fantasy RPG campaign (Talislanta, FYI, it\'s really cool) and
it just really has the effect of making everyone stop and say "what the
hell do we do now?"  The usual combat rythm of "shoot/slice/beat it until
it stops shooting/slicing/beating us" just goes right out the window.  

The danger with mental domination is it can really piss some players off. 
I used it on some newbies a couple of months ago (the evil
mind-controlling flowers mentioned in a previous "Nastiest monster" post)
and one of my new-to-RPGs players just couldn\'t handle it!  She got all
flipped out!  Some people just can\'t draw a line between fantasy and
reality!  (God bless them :-)

One last one I\'ll mention is insanity.  This is especially relevant to
sophont baddies, of course, but can apply to animals and such as well.  It
basically means that the PCs can\'t predict the behavior of their opponent.
Now, combine this with teleportation and mental domination (yes, I have
:-) and you get a really NASTY adversary!

Charles.

like High Guard. One side would put a ship forward, the other would match
one ship against it, then the side with more ships got to start doubling
and tripling up attackers. You\'d bring lots of light ships with you if you
could...your best option would be for a cheapie scout to match every one
of his ships, so you could decide exactly where your battlewagons would
shoot and be shot at instead of him getting to choose. This was very
important, since the Terrans had energy weapons and the Imperium had
missile weapons - it was very good for you to keep your important ships
out of harms way while the engagement range was right for his weapons
and wrong for yours.  Also, you could only have a High Guardish "reserve"
(ships that could not be attacked) if you had more ships than the enemy
fleet - otherwise you\'d have to put forward your tankers and transports for
him to match ships against.

This ability of war scouts, destroyers and such to screen heavier units
is one of my favorite bits about Imperium - it can add a lot of technique
to space-combat slugfests. It tended to be hard on the light units, though.

In Imperium, Fighter Squadrons could match against an enemy ship, 
serving the same screening (and occaisonal effective attack) role as a
scout or destroyer. I assumed that each Imperium squadron counter
represented a good number of fighters, as the carrier could only carry
three of them.

Now, imagine this concept mated to High Guard. If you don\'t have enough
combat units to engage every enemy combat asset, the unengaged ones
get to go play hell with your support units. A fighter screen, even if it
can\'t do ship-killing attacks, can engage an enemy unit enough to keep
it away from the support units...but the enemy could always bring a bigger
fighter screen.

In this case, the main purpose of the fighter screen - considering how hard
it is for a fighter to affect a warship - is to delay the enemy force until the
big friendly ship can deal with it - maintain contact, force the enemy to
maintain combat readiness and combat evasion maneuvers, divert and
delay the enemy so he doesn\'t escape or get a clear shot at some target
the task force is attempting to defend.

I haven\'t worked out optional rules for this yet, but wanted to present the 
idea to the lists for comment.

A few years ago, there was a ballot measure for a new ballpark for the SF
Giants.  The proposed park (now under construction) had it\'s right-field
fence backed by the bay.  Any homeruns to right would land in the water.

One of the better ads for the campaign was "vote for a ballpark where
homeruns aren\'t measured in feet, but fathoms!"  After these ads began
running, and outraged letter showed up in the Chronicle, decrying the
introduction of *metric* measurements to the Grand Old Game of Baseball!

<GRIN> One of Carl Hiaasen\'s novels (Double Whammy IIRC, though if you

time ;-) is centered around a professional bass fisherman. He describes
how one of his buddies died...barreling across a lake at 65-70 mph he

The thing is, you gotta wonder _why_ that little bug evolved such a high

Sure messes with the PC\'s minds, though (until they find out what they\'re
up against).  Imagine the wasted ammo trying vainly to shoot at a target
that is unknowingly no larger than the bullets being fired... the first
image that comes to mind is the scene from Predator (you know the one).

I wasn\'t referring to IGs notorious production values and editing, but rather
to it\'s consistency with (GDW\'s) previously published material.  I don\'t have
enough of T4 to judge on its internal consistency.  I\'d definately have to
rate it behind DGP, but think it\'s about as \'canonical\' as anything from any
of the other 3rd party Traveller producers.  Has to be taken with a grain of
salt, but should be usable in some way.

Well, like i said, i haven\'t held one yet.  :-)  I\'m also interested in system

Sure there is, it just isn\'t chiseled in stone.  There are no enforcers,
either. ;-)

Noone would appreciate it much if it one supplement/adventure Norris was Duke
of Regina and then in a later one, he\'s a Duke of Antares w/ no mention of
Regina, even though such would probably barely affect the players beyond
making their suspension of disbelief more difficult (at least if they don\'t
know where Antares and Regina are and who the Duke of Antares is supposed to
be, etc).  If it\'s something that isn\'t mutually exclusive, like saying he\'s
Baron Yori, then it\'s another matter.  Even something like that might be
described as a quibble.  But having one source say Norris employs and enjoys
the association with a psionic aide and then having another say that he hates
all psionics would be very distasteful, to say the least.
Now exand this to cover other "historical events" of the timeline and
technological assumptions, etc etc.

Of course, noone is bound to follow anything that official support would
assume, be it technological assumptions, "historical events," and
personalities.  Norris could simply have stayed an operative of INI and his
older brother doesn\'t bite the big one.  Hows that for an Alternate Universe?
;-)  The FFW goes alot worse, since Norris\' big bro might not remove
Santanocheev, and/or believe a similar philosophy, etc.  Noone is bound to
follow what "officially" follows, but there should be an eye to previously
published material.  If it\'s disliked, it doesn\'t have to be followed, after
all.  We\'re not slaves to whatever is "official," though some of us might
enjoy following the developments of an official campaign setting, adapting
them to our own games.

Three possible answers:

1.  It failed in its designed purpose:  to make the galaxy safe for
Lucan\'s Imperium.

2.  It failed to "breed true", as evidenced by the many "flavors" of
Virus documented in _Survival Margin_.

3.  Its...creators werrrre...imperfect.  Therefore,
_it_...iiis...imperfect.  (From the course material of "Computer Logic
101", Jim Kirk School of Programming.)

According to WCBS 880AM NYC, "Eyes Wide Shut" is in the can, and
will be released this summer.

Also off topic, but baseball fans will want to know that the line
from "Mrs Robinson" has, regrettably, come true:

"...Joltin\' Joe has left and gone away..."

The announcement was made at a bit after 08:00 Eastern Standard

is complications related to his illness earlier this year.

BL does not handle PD turrets as such.

The PD design adopted on Andy\'s FFS2 spreadsheet uses the overpowering
rule on p18 to improve the rate of fire and thus the "to hit" roll.
In BL terms the number of diff mods ignored. Base ROF is 50, so
ROF 250 is equivalent to -1, ROF 500 is -2 (I\'d suggest 200 and 800
in T4 terms.) The trick is to use batteries to overpower the weapon
to smooth out the peak power demand.

The PD lasers of T4/FFS2/MCS are not quite so significant in TNE/FFS/BL.
The reason for this is the missiles.
TNE does not have thruster plates, so the missiles are big.

A missile turret in High Guard was 1 std, could fire 3 missiles/turn
and had a total 12 missiles. Each missile could pull 6G for 6 turns.

A missile turret in BL is 3std, can fire 20 missiles/turn and has
a total of 2 missiles (or 6std and 5 missiles). Each missile
can pull 6G for 1 turn.

T4 is somewhere between the two. Thruster plate missiles are big but
run forever. HEPlaR missiles can be small and pull 40G for 1 turn.

So you don\'t get the large waves of missiles in TNE/FFS/BL.

Another problem is that the lasers are too powerful to be PD weapons.
Something much smaller would still kill any missile that it hit.

Finally, the warships presented in BL pull 3-6G and the standard
missiles just aren\'t going to get near them.

After all death is just roll 14d6.

My vote for the nastiest monster - don\'t overlook the tribe of
stone age teady bears. After all, the PCs are probably equipped
like Imperial Stormtroopers - and we all know what happened to them.

I\'ll need a URL, in that case; the only reason I can think of for
you to get that message is that my ISP thinks your ISP (ihc.com)
is a spamhaus.  I\'ll check with them tonight.  Before going
through the hassle of webifying it, try sending it to
jeff.zeitlin@mail.execnet.com; that account forwards to my

I like it.

Could you work out a way of including 2D maneuver (or a good imitation)? 
Some way of gaming out "then de Leon\'s Cruiser Squadron broke through the
enemy line and attacked the rear"?  

Better yet, could you simplify High Guard to Imperium levels? Or even
better, reduce Trillion Credit Squadron to War at Sea complexity?  (Not
joking - I\'d like a fast playable Traveller game.)

Agreed... I\'d like to dedicate more space to common
areas but the stateroom size requirements would
make that hard to accomplish.  I\'ve toyed with the
idea of making some percentage of the passenger
staterooms into double occupancy rooms to free up
some space for public areas...  Anyone have any
ideas?

Recall, that, at least in FFS2, stateroom volumes _include_ common
space. Look at some of the shots of those staterooms..not enough room to
swing a kitten, much less a cat. ;-)

Plus luxury ships, vs. free trader tramps will have considerable extra
space given over to commons. It\'s just hard to make a 1000 t ship into a
luxury liner...that\'s closer in size to a luxury yacht...

Liners, IMHO _start_ at 10,000t and go up...they\'re BIG ships! Ever see
a cruise ship up close?

Of course, under the rules that 1000t ship will never make a dime of
profit...:-(

The only issue is that this doesn\'t appear to be allowed under a strict rule

Now you see why even my warships (at least the larger ones) include
individual small staterooms for crew and junior officers, large
individual staterooms for senior personnel, and a fair amount of space
for crew lounges.  I believe that improving the habitability of ships
improves their combat effectiveness, in the long run.

Of course, the dedication of space on warships to "luxuries" such as
crew lounges and individual staterooms for all crewmwmbers is yet
another way in which AuricTech earns its name.... ;-)

WEEELLLL, I\'ve always disagreed with the stateroom size. So, I, way deep
down in the undistributed deck plans, simply assume that those numbers
in HG, FFS, FFS2 etc. are MINIMUMS. My assumption is that these numbers
are the minimum size for Medium and High passage, as well as crew
staterooms. As long as the cubic area and tonnage is accounted for
staterooms can be any size you want, that\'s why I typically leave quite
a bit of "empty space" when I design a ship, then just allocate that
space to common areas, over size staterooms etc. Personaly I think these
should be flexible in size anyway, and common araeas accounted for as a
seperate item. THat way a yaught cna be designed with oversized bed
rooms, large dinning rooms, and even dance floors. Not to mention
"luxury" liners.

If a passenger is Jumping from one world to the next on business they\'ll
put up with cramped quarters in a free trader. If, however, they\'re
taking a multi-world Grand Tour, for say 2-3 months, they\'re going to
want elbo room! 

Then there are the "family" ships or nomads that are part of Traveller
mythos in some areas. For these you really need to be able to build
appartments, as opposed to just sleeping quarters.

They are published by Holistic Design Inc. and are actually for use with
their own game systems, Noble Armada and Fadin Suns. However, they carry
an approved for Traveller tag.

Included in the package are 5 seperate ships. A "League Sentury escort",
a "Decados Mantis frigate", an "al-Malik Odyssey explorer, a "Hawkwood
Hornet frigate" and a "Luxury Liner". The only stats included are for
the Luxury Liner and these are for the Holistic games, no Traveller
conversions are included.

Overall the deck plans are of decent quality, printed on semi-gloss
paper, black on white. The deck plan artwork is passable, if basic,
quality. The interesting thing about it is that the symbols used
indecate the location of crew personnel, not only the "duty stations"
are marked but staterooms are designated as well. This could prove a
plus for boarding actiosn, and I assume that is why this was done.

The two biggest complaints I have are the lack of grid or hex lines,
requireing the need to measure movement when using these plans. Second
is the lack of statistics. I have to assume that the 4 sets of stats not
included are in the \'parent\' game books. However, since they are labled
as Approved for Traveller, amention on convestion would have been nice.

Over all, at a price of $14.95 (US) they probably aren\'t for MOST
Traveller players. Still it\'s nice to see some company making an effort
to bring back this type of game aid.

I have come up with a bit of kludge that works for me.  When designing a
liner, determine the total amount of space you will dedicate to passenger
areas.  (Public and private)  Allocate this space entirely to standard size
staterooms on the design sheet. (28m^3 and 56m^3)  This allows you to
calculate profit loss information.

Now, when designing the deckplans, you divide the number of staterooms in
half.   So if you had 1000 small staterooms on the design sheet, you will
now place only 500 on the deckplans.  The remaining space is allocated to
shops, clubs, lounges, etc.

In effect you have doubled the price on the remaining staterooms using a
handwave to the \'half of the space is dedicated to common areas\' rule.  This
keeps staterooms at a reasonable size, and reflects the fact that luxury
liner tickets would cost more than a simple commuter ticket.  (And in game
play allows characters to purchase a ticket at the standard prices, thus

Using this system you can design profitable ships, which have all the
amenities of actual cruise liners.
(I came up with this by using stats from the QE2 I found in a magazine, it
listed passenger capacities and number of shops, clubs, etc.)

The nastiest NPC(monster) was a lone Aslan Hunter armed with a large bore 
hunting rifle, in his own turf so to speak. He almost did my all players 
in, I thought he would get killed pretty quick, but it was a case of right 
time, place and most importantly skill(s).

These same players had survived major starship battles, Aslan planetary 
invasion, and hired assassins. But a lone hunter random encounter almost 
succeeded. Is that not right Jimmy?!

When the first shot was fired by the Aslan Hunter one PC went down, almost 
dead, every shot he fired meant one more PC was ready for the trauma unit.

Talk about the a scene from the Three Stooges or the Keystone Cops. The 
PC\'s were better armed and armored too.

They were to scared to expose themselves lest they join the trauma unit 
comrades. So he got to move around and do some "shopping" for the "right" 
target. If only I had read "White Feather" before that encounter the Aslan 
would have gotten them all.<G>

Why would a battleship captain stop and engage a squadron of fighters,

unapproved activity in any of these areas.

44.  An ancient civilization left remains that appear to surpass

progress in understanding and translating them has been very
slow, and only a few isolated words are known. The known
documents do not appear to contain technical information, and the
pace of archaeological research is glacial.

45. There is a rigid caste system, composed of Managers,
philosophers, warriors, merchants, technicians, and serfs.

46. The dominant religion is highly intellectual.  People offer
to have their lives evaluated by the priests who apply complex
systems of evaluation, and offer their counsel and advice for
improvement. Careful inquiry, logical debate, and even research
are important parts of priestly duties.  The best priests are
excellent theoretical and practical psychologists.

47. The society is based on small, tightly knit villages. Even
larger cities are composed of distinct neighborhoods. Villages
interact only through designated spokesmen, and inquiries about
the inner workings of another village are regarded as intrusive.

48. An intelligent and able ruler who rose to power through
rebellion and bloody warfare was appalled by the carnage and

In the case of a RPG such as Traveller, canonicity is moot (not the senate).
There have been so many versions and stages of it that one has the choice of
picking a version and sticking with those rules only, or actually trying to
grab what they concider the best from the various versions to make their own
"house rules."  Jesse hates when I do that but he\'s a smeg head anyway.    ;-P

This is a huge ask, I know, but would you be willing to either convert
your code to Java, or provide the source code so that someone else
(possibly me) can convert it to Java ?

That way, we can all use it and ignore these silly machine
dependencies

algorithm re-use !

Grendels on speed ?

Love that as a way of building up the nasty though. Give the players
trouble with what turns out to be the _prey_ creature, and let them
speculate for a while on what the _predator_ looks like.

Did this once too well, the players were so spooked at the idea of
something eating the creature they had so much trouble with, they
lifted off and tried to have the planet declared a Red Zone. But of
course, "the Company" didn\'t agree ("What dangerous predator ? Show me
a picture of one. You can\'t ? You have no evidence of one other than
that the herbivore was dangerous ? Incompetent fools !!" ) and sent
settlers.....

BTW, my vote for nastiest nasty is Christopher Rowley\'s "Vang"
Especially the Battlemaster form.

IIRC, the "heroes" _never_ beat this nasty, they just finally found it
after it had committed suicide once it had determined the rest of it\'s
race had been destroyed, having chased it all over the universe,
always being two steps behind.

The "Nuke it from orbit, it\'s the only way to be sure" phrase is even
more appropriate for Vang than for Aliens. In the first Vang novel
 "The Vang", which was not their first appearance, but if I start
talking about all the wonderful idea\'s in "Starhammer" I won\'t stop,
just read it ! )  the only reason human civilization survived first
contact is that the Military form of the Vang made one fundamental
mistake, it assumed the population was native and therefore did not
look for, and immediately seize, the starport.

Even so, it was a close run thing, with the Vang almost making it to
the next jump-capable ship that  entered system.

Of course my second nastiest baddy would be a toss up between Niven\'s
Slavers and Tnuctpin (sp?)
as shown in "The Sea Statue" and one of the Man-Kzin war books, and
"World of Ptavs", or perhaps getting on the wrong side of a Pak
Protector from a different clan/race ( "Protector" )

Add in Saberhagen\'s Berserkers, along with the little machines
designed to _hunt_ berserkers.....

If you really want to be mean though, the absolute worst creature is a
nano-machine culture taken to the extremes described in Greg Bear\'s
"Blood Music" .

It can\'t really be fought, it isn\'t evil or implacably hostile to
other life-forms like the Vang, it\'s just different....

Imagine, a culture of such creatures (or even a less inimicable Vang
culture ) requesting an Imperial ambassador as a host.....

Well, that\'s part of the fun. The players might have to locate
something hidden on the planet. Or hide it in such a way that they can

Sorry I couldn\'t help myself there.  Reduce cost??  They must be joking. 
Anyone who could take a prototype spacecraft, call it a line model, and
then use it to loft satellites and space station parts while lugging
along a crew of several along with associated life support gear, run by a
government agency, is nuts if they think they can get costs that low
without subsidy, which is false cost reduction anyway.  Lofting sats and
SS parts with the shuttle is like moving your couch with a Rolls Royce. 
I am so darn sick and tired of being told what a great job NASA is doing
cutting costs and making space access a reality.  It won\'t really happen
until we engineers and other real folk get off our collective @$$#$ and
do it privately!!!!  GRRRRRR!!!!!!  Huh?!  What!?  No, not the needle,

Why would a battleship captain stop and engage a squadron of fighters,
which can\'t hurt him and may not even be able to catch up with him, and
ignore more high-value targets?
>>>>>>>>>>>>
Well, remember that the 6G, Agility-6 battleship is something you didn\'t
see during the First through Nth interstellar wars. You simply can\'t pack
that much drives and power plant onto a hull with any appreciable armor
belt at those tech levels*. The fighters will be able to catch the battleship.

Why not just ignore them? These rules (if they turn out interesting and
workable) would assume some penalty for ignoring an enemy ship.
Some possibilities that come to mind:

1) Time and Distance. These fights take place over the span of a solar
system (or a chunk thereof). The Battleship captain isn\'t stopping, he\'s
hunting. Fighters found him, and warned targets away while they lead
him astray. The Battleship captain can choose not to shoot at the fighters,
but it will take him twenty minutes (a High Guard turn) at least to find
another target - while that fighter squadron dogs him, warning better
targets away. This is submarines in space, not X-wing dogfights...these
fights take time and distance.

2) Sensor limitations. You are 90% sure that you\'re being painted by
a squadron of fightercraft. It\'s also possible that you\'re being lined up on
by a cruiser\'s spinal mount. It will take you 20 minutes (one HG turn)
to be sure, and that\'s time you have to spend maneuvering to or away
from contact. Next turn you can break off from the surviving fighters
and probe again for a break in the enemy line.

2) "Battle Stations": ships behave differently when prosecuting (or being 
prosecuted by) a contact. They maneuver, evade, don\'t use their full
acceleration for straight-line, distance-eating movement. They concentrate
more of their sensor assets on contermeasures and jamming, less on
acquiring leads on new contacts. If a Battleship doesn\'t want to tangle
with a fighter squadron, it must disengage in time-consuming combat
mode - because if it points its nose towards the retreating transports
and thrusts straight-line and flat out, you could hit it with a dumb
missile and a pocket calculator. 

This makes me think of a High Guard battle taking place over massive
areas of the solar system, with each match-up being a few minutes of the
twenty-minute turn. Your light units - scouts and destroyers and such - 
find the enemy, fix his location. If you have more units, your light screening
units will allow you to meet him on your terms, allow you to have units
"reveal" themselves so your noncombat units can slip away (for a while).
If you have fewer units, your lack of sensor platforms puts you at a
disadvantage - he will locate your ships with his scouts, and choose where
his battleship strikes.

Walt Smith

*At TL12, Maneuver-6, Power-6 and Armor-12 take up 66% of the hull. If you
need to boost the power plant up to Power-9 to juice the weapons *and*
get an agility of 6, we\'re talking 79% of the hull, before bridge or jump
drives and fuel.
At TL15, a Maneuver-6, Power-9, Armor-15 ship has only used 51% of
its hull before bridge and jump. That\'s a massive difference...especially
considering how much bigger a TL15 battleship can be than its TL12
ancestor.

Remember that stateroom volume includes a share of common space, so the
volume of the actual stateroom would be less than the 4 dtons specified.
Also include some extra modules (theatres and the like).

humans into space using re-usable vehicles that only require a handful of

they claim will fly in about 18 months.  IMHO, in the area of manned flight,
NASA seems to be too focused on large, heavy lift vehicles.  They turned
down the Delta Clipper and went with the Lockheed design which was totally
unproven and would require large developent costs.  Granted, the Delta
Clipper may not have been suitable for lifting large ISS components, but it
would have provided much cheaper access to space, which I feel should be
NASA\'s current goal.  I love the idea of the ISS, but it may be the hammer

Yup.

Did that with a group of high school boys a few years ago, when running a
T2k adventure ("Castle by the Sea"). There these rough tough mercenaries
were, sneaking through the caves, when the lead chap feels a tug on his
pant leg. He _nearly_ opens up, then stops and checks: it\'s a two-year-old
boy. 

It was fun, watching them try to sneak a pack of kids out. Also brought
out some really good role-playing, as opposed to just dice-rolling
fighting, which is why I did it. Years later the chaps still talk about
that game; I think it\'s one of my best. :-)

How about cicadas...they fly on a string pretty well... until the

ships, two 1000tn ships, twenty 400tn ships and about 100 small craft.
The defenders are built to TL12, use nuclear weapons, and the only

3. Landing an invasion/occupation force on Colchis II (a size 7, atmosphere

the troops cannot travel in low berths. If landing is to be performed by
carried craft or part of the fleet, it must be completed in ten trips or less

We will be using the same fighter squadron rules as the current Island

For a good read on Travelleresque space combat, read the first story (IIRC)
in the second WarWorld book by Jerry Pournelle.  It details the Sauron raid
on Tanith that eventually turned into the "Last Big Battle" of the war the
shattered the First Empire.

The story details differing command theory and strategies.

The Saurons would be an interesting encounter in Traveller.

If they are anything like the edition Old Earth did for H. Beam Piper\'s
"Murder in the Gunroom", then they will be pretty much exact reprints of
the original publication with the dustjacket being the cover of the trade
paperback, both inside and out.  The only difference in the original
"Murder" was the inclusion of a biography and very good bibliography of
Piper\'s works.  The quality of the book was very good and to me well worth
the price.

Or something far darker.  See the CT adventure \'Murder on Actures station\'.
A situation that can lead to a very brutal aslan foe that acts very un-aslan.

How did the cook end up in robes and a mask?



I\'ve taken part in games like this.  Any group with enough players and an
agile enough GM or two should try it.  It\'s a totally different dynamic!
The one I liked best involve several groups exploring the same monster
filled abandoned castle.  We did this a few times in coledge.  There is a
bumper sticker that reads, "Forget the dog, beware of the owner!"  This fit
this game perfectly, \'Forget the NPCs!, beware the PCs!\'  Some of the
monsters were the smart ones and bolted to safety when the fireballs started
flying!

I have also run small groups as mutual advisaries either knowingly or
secretly.  This only really works with very mature players but if the
players are up for it...  

The \'royal scavenger hunt\' is a good \'device\' to let PCs that normally
cooperate compete for royal favor or a cash prize without coming into direct
physical comfrontation.  Having the very prudish and gentlemanly knight try
to secure a \'nubile and noble virgin\'s undergarment\' for 200 points can be
very bizzar especially when he succeeds honorablly only to have the item
disquallified in court because the \'nubile and noble virgin\' did not
quality!!!  Major political/social problems soon follow with accompaning
adventures.


One of the best games I ever played in, my character was the \'traiter\' in
the group working for \'them\'.  We completed the mission but sadly the item
we were sent after by our patron was never located...(Yeah, right!  28, 29,
30 pieces of fine silver!)  It was one of my best games because the other 4
players never caught on.  The GM and I told them AFTER we completed the
entire campain.  My character double crossed the bad guys in the end because
it was more profitable.  He got the reward and all the loot he could palm as
well as his \'fair\' share of the loot captured by the group.


As a side note for GT, beware of taking greed as a disadvantage if you are
not up to a little inter party fraud, imbesselment, treachery, and/or other
skull duggery.  Slight of hand, holdout, and merchant(gems/jewlery) skills
is VERY handly in case you do!

In the first "Vang" book they nuked the planet down to the bedrock, and the
battle master was even nastier.  If the \'Vang shows up MY PC is going to
just forget fighting and work on running off planet and distroying all other
space craft.  Those things can survive the long trip by sublight.  They
don\'t care if they win in a few years or centuries.  The "Vang" are more a
force than a monster, totally implacable.  Battle dress troops would just
give the "Vang" better armor and weapons.  YIKES!  "Vang" combat forms IN
Battle dress.  I\'m outa\' here!!!

How could you use this in a campian?  They unstasis and control everybody in
sight or everyboby in the system if they have an amplifier helmet.  Now an
unstasised member of the race they stole their tech from would be
interesting especially if it knew that the Slavers had a \'sleeper\' base
designed to survive the \'galatic life killer\' weapon they used when their
slaves broke free and began to exterminate them.  If the \'sleeper agent\'
also had enough of the gaggets that blocks the slavers mental control for
the party...

I did something like this in a game.  A small berserker probes\' brain was
dug up by an arcialogical group.  It quickly stared to adapt local equipment
for its\' remotes.  To give the PCs a chance the original \'CPU\' core was the
only part that could think and I set a period of time and parts list that it
would need to build more core units.  And the race is on...

The topic of fighter screens in Bruce\'s MCS 
(Military Combat System AKA Fudion Guard) was 
mentioned briefly in passing on the trav-tech 
mailing list this time last year (27th Feb - 4th 
March, roughly).  The conclusion was basicly 
that under the MCS system, using FFS2 rules to 
build the ships, it is possible to design a 
squadron of fighters that can severly damage or 
destroy light military ships (~1000 - 3000 tons) 
and inflict performance degrading damage on even 
quite large ships (~30,000 tons).

A battleship captain wouldn\'t care about them at 
all, but his screen of cruisers and destroyers 
might, leaving the enemy cruisers and destroyers 
free to attack _his_ support ships.

As for a fighter screen not being able to catch 
up with a capital ship - under FFS/FFS2, it 
would be quite unusual to see a fighter that 
can\'t keep up - especially as under the MCS the 
fighter\'s superior acceleration is just about 
all that keeps it from instant destruction at 
the hands of those capital ship weapons.

I\'m assuming here you mean the format larger than a standard paperback.  If

Ah, finally a good thing.  Based on this point I\'ll actually have to find
them and check them out.  Having put together a set a couple years ago used,
I really doubt I\'ll bother spending the $150 though.  I\'d rather spend that

Pak Protectors are another creation of Larry Niven.  IIRC, the most
detailed work is called Protector or Pak Protector.  You DONT want to
mess with a Protector.  They are absolutely, totally, unequivocally
devoted to their clan, which consists of juvenile Protectors (which are
also, BTW, the ancestors of humans).  When a Pak reaches a certain age,
IIRC, they begin to alter their form, I wont try to go into details, read
Niven, and the Protectors will do ANYTHING to protect their clan.  They
often die if their clan is wiped out.  They are also very long lived
(centuries IIRC) and extremely intelligent and cunning.  They could build
a nuke out of a Van De Graf generator and a pile of dirty socks.  They
are also totally ruthless regarding any opposing clan (or anything else
they consider an enemy).  If you get away, they\'ll travel the length of
the galaxy to get you if necessary.  In a slow boat.  Alone.  


Two PCs in a bar.

PC1:  Whats that funny lookin critter with no hair and a beak?
PC2:  I dunno, those Aslan said it was a Pak, and left in a big hurry.
PC1 (who\'s heard about Pak):  OH @#!++!!!!!!!!!  UHH, BARKEEP, TAB

A serious reply: Even if you kept the old style designs a lot of starports
and other maps had been drawn on the basis of a Millennium Falcon Style
Drive, not a Plasma Torch. This is a problem if you use old material.

A Silly Reply: Fusion Guns are Space Weapons (3 systems to 2 vote)... cf
High Guard.  - " There is no game but Traveller and High Guard is its
product"- Virus is flawed because it broke the Imperium badly.

Anyway, I\'m not looking to start a flamefest on this (we\'ve done it
before). Lets play our own versions and enjoy ourselves; like it or not CT,
MT, T4 and GT bear more resemblance to each other than TNE. Is this a bad
thing? Depends on your point of view. TNE at its best was thought
provoking, and combined feelings of pathos and hope. At its worst it was
clunky and revisionist. I\'m sad the storyline ended but aren\'t really
bothered by the death of the rules system. My two favourite products where
Battle Rider and FFS1, and the Regency Sourcebook. Sorry my three favourite
TNE products were....

*I like HG but I like the way FFS1 explained the technology too.

Much could the same could be said about the other periods and games systems
in Traveller. They all have strong points.

There\'s a boardgame by Wasteland Games which looks like it does this. It\'s
called Ad Astra. If you read it it is heavily influenced by TCS/HG. I
talked to one of the designers and he said this was the inspiration and
they wanted a faster version than having to handle the Esperanzan Fighter
Horde.

I\'m developing a ship design system (yes, yet another one) 
that works at roughly the same detail as High Guard. What I 
did about accommodations was to define a base cost (tonnage
and money) per person, plus a per-comfortable-day cost. The
total accommodation expenditure is assumed to consist of 
cabins, common spaces, stores, luxuries, laundries, etc., 
all at the architect\'s (not the designer\'s) discretion.

Ship crews can stay aboard ship for longer than the comfort 
time, but morale rolls are involved to maintain skill levels. 
After double the comfort time, crew is on short rations and 
morale roll failures tend to have serious consequences.

High passage passengers won\'t go over the comfort time. If 
there\'s a reason they must, they\'ll demand refunds. 
Middle passage passengers will go to 1.5 times the comfort 
time for a discount.

This has several nice effects. It unifies small craft couches,
small craft staterooms, and single and double-occupancy cabins;
the only difference is the comfort time (one of my goals for the
whole design system was to avoid arbitrary rules like small craft
versus ships). It also covers storage for provisions.

I\'m considering rolling off the cost somewhat after a certain
number of days to simulate closed-cycle recycling and allow
really long range ships; with my current design sequence it\'s 
hard to make a really really long range ship. 

The values I used were 0.5t per person base, plus 0.1t per
person per day. A one-day couch (first class airline seat?)
would be 0.6t; the traditional 4t stateroom gets you over a 
month of comfort. Tweak the values if you want different 
answers.

are some of the rules I use for that.

Eris


Tasks:

FUDGE uses descriptive adjectives to describe skill/attribute levels,
task difficulties, and ranges that are associated with numbers
centered around 0. This is the standard FUDGE scale and descriptors...

	+3 Superb
	+2 Great
	+1 Good
	 0 Fair
	-1 Mediocre
	-2 Poor
	-3 Terrible

...a character would be described as having Great Skill, and a task
would require Fair effort to accomplish. Unopposed Task resolution
involves comparing the difference between the skill the character has
and the skill needed to succeed, then rolling that sum or greater on
several dice. The dice are also normalized around 0. You can use
specialty Fudge dice (df) numbered -1/0/+1, the suggested number of
them is four, but using more or less is up to the GM.  You can also
use regular d6\'s where you subtract one from another 1d6-1d6, but the
curve is flatter with the d6\'s than the df\'s.

Example: Joe has Good skill at Intrusion and he is attempting a
Mediocre task. Put your finger on Good and run it down (negative) to
Mediocre for a -2, Joe must roll -2 or better to succeed.  Joe rolls
1d6 (5) then another 1d6 (3) and subtracts (5-3) giving him a +2, or
Joe rolls 4df and compares/sums finding he has a +2...Joe succeeds in
his attempted Intrusion.

Personally, I prefer to use the 1d6-1d6 method and the Traveller
adjectives for tasks and ranges, so I use three columns of
descriptors. I had to modify them a little, but they should be easily
understood for folks use to the Traveller task systems.

Die		     Descriptors
Roll 	Range		Skill		Difficulty	
====================================================
 5      Extreme+2	Legendary	Impossible  
 4      Extreme+1       Awesome 	Hopeless

 2      V Long          Great           Formidable  
 1      Long            Good            Difficult

Notes: Many people (including me) also give descriptive names to
Terrible-1, -2, but you certainly don\'t have to. 
I don\'t like Impossible as a descriptor...impossible should be
impossible. I normally would call that level Hopeless+1. 
Ranges beyond Extreme are generally "out of range" but are included
for completeness.

Example1:  Lou is going to calculate a Difficult Astrogation plot. She
has Good skill at Astrogation, but she also has a +1 Astrogation
program to help her so she gets an effective skill of Good+1, or
Great. Putting our finger on Great and comparing its position to
Difficult we see she needs a -1 or better to succeed. Pretty easy.

Example2:  There is a ship at Extreme range for the sensors on Bob\'s
ship that he *might* be able to detect. Bob has Good Sensor Ops skill,
but there is a -1 because he isn\'t really focused on the task, so
Bob\'s effective skill is Good-1, or Fair.  Putting our finger on Fair
and comparing to Extreme we see he needs a +3 or better to succeed.
That\'s tough!

Example3: Same ship as in Example2, but this time it isn\'t trying to
cloak its signature so it gets one level easier to detect, giving it
an effective range of V Long, and Bob is not only concentrating, but
is focusing the sensor sweeps on this particular area of space rather
than doing a 360 sweep, giving him an effective skill of Good+1, or
Great. Now comparing Great to V Long, we see that Bob\'s chances of
succeeding have greatly improved as he needs only a 0 or better to
succeed.

Attribute Levels:

1. When I have a completed Traveller character to convert, I use a
formula and a table for this:
		((Traveller Stat)-7) / 2

Trav.   FUDGE    Skill
Level   Level   Descriptor
==========================
15	+4.0	Awesome	
14	+3.5	Superb+
13	+3.0	Superb
12	+2.5	Great+
11	+2.0	Great
10	+1.5	Good+
 9	+1.0	Good
 8	+0.5	Fair+
 7	 0.0	Fair
 6	-0.5	Mediocre+
 5	-1.0	Mediocre
 4	-1.5	Poor+
 3	-2.0	Poor
 2	-2.5	Terrible+
 1	-3.0	Terrible

2. When the player is developing the character using this system they
can either...

a. Random: Roll (1d6-1d6)/2 and go to the table.

b. Distribute: Everything starts at Fair, they have 4 levels to
distribute as they see fit, and they can reduce an attribute to
increase another. I strongly suggest putting a limit on the number of
Attributes that start at Superb or better!

Note:  The +\'s have no effect on play, but I have attributes increase
though character improvement by half level steps, so they represent a
someone halfway up to the next level. Skills also improve at half
level steps at Great and above.

Skills:

1. When converting a Traveller character you can....

a. Base the beginning level of the skill on a Controlling Attribute\'s
level - 1.

b. Base the beginning skill on a controlling level of Poor.

Then use the following table as the Skill levels increase.

Skill	Skill
Level	Description
====================
 0	Poor
 1 	Mediocre
 2	Fair
 3	Good
 4	Great
 5	Great+
 6	Superb
 7	Superb+
 8	Awesome
 9	Awesome+
10	Legendary

Note: increases go to half levels at Great!

2. When creating a character with these rules you can...

a. Use a Traveller career method of your choice and then convert as
above.

b.  Subjectively choose the skills and levels the character would
have, subject to GM approval

c.  Distribute some number of points, given you by the GM, among
skills at your option. Again, I suggest limiting the number of skills
at Superb or greater.

***Skill Difficulties***
GURPS and FUDGE rate skills as being EASY, AVERAGE, HARD & VERY HARD.
Traveller does not. It does make sense that some skills are harder to
learn than others, and if you want to include this you can by using
the following table, but you will have to decide on each skill\'s
difficulty from non-Traveller sources.

  Skill\'s Diff.    Level One starts at      or starts at
  =======================================================
  Easy		Controlling Attribute		Mediocre
  Average	Controlling Attribute - 1	Poor
  Hard		Controlling Attribute - 2	Terrible
  Very Hard	Controlling Attribute - 3	Terrible-1

  Imperium is meant to be a much simpler game, and its battles need to play
much faster as the campaign is the actual point of the game. High Guard is
intended for use in resolving individual engagements, and thus allows itself
the luxuries of dozens (if not hundreds) of dice rolls by major combatants 
each turn and detailed damage resolution.

  High Guard would be drastically changed in play-balance were such to be
adopted. Further, it would needlessly hamper attempts to improve the fit
of the current (HG2) rules to reality. As it stands the rules do a tolerably
decent job of modelling a fleet formation in one dimension, by having the
line of battle for each side assumed to be within effective ranges of each
other even while each sides reserve is placed sufficiently far back as to
be out of range of the others line.

The fighters can strip off the surface fixtures like turrets and sensors,
and damage the engines/T-Plates. The bits you can\'t really armour. No
Traveller rules system does this that well.

  Quite possibly, except that the degraded screening elements will still
have their heavy anti-ship batteries available (spinal mounts and whatever
else a given design system allows). Further, said ships have to keep far
enough away from any battleships that they\'re trying to bypass - firing
solutions with beam weapons (esp. in MCS) clearly assume that ranges are
well beyond the "automatic hit per ROF" range for lasers, which means that
there is a closer range band within which the tempo of combat increases
dramatically (i.e., roughly about where Det-Lasers deploy & terminate).

  IIRC, MCS allows G\'s to be assigned to either evasion or maneuver*; 
exploiting an enemy reserve line is going to require _lots_ of G\'s
to go "around" the battleline, at which point you would likely only
meet a reserve screen (if available) anyway.

 * I could be thinking of the aiming spinal mount step, but the principle
is fairly sound even if the rules syste, doesn\'t support it.

  The obvious solution is to go to a hex-based display.

I\'m recalling the last half-dozen BCS rounds I\'ve run, and the hundreds of
die rolls involved for fewer than a dozen craft per side. That\'s some luxury.

Note that my idea wouldn\'t change the die rolling much at all, just give
better defined roles to things like Destroyers and Fighter Squadrons.
It might also speed up the game a bit, as there will be a lot of massive
overmatching going on. Destroyer screening against a battleship better
have some emergency agility in the pipes...

I need to work on a computer-based HG combat resolution aid. Ship
data input might be time consuming...

<weg>
Seriously, I assume you mean the "reality" of some published SF books
involving fleet combat, right?

I don\'t think play balance would change so much as fleet construction
and deployment. The victory might go to more than the biggest guns
and the best ship designs.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Much as I like the simplicity of it, what sensible reality is modelled by
having fleets line up like age of sail men-of-war? Space is so big that
lines of battle will only meet by mutual agreement. Modifying the Imperium
line of battle system adds an entire new dimension of squadron construction
and battle tactics to what HG essentially leaves as a number-crunching
slugfest.

I\'m working on the order Admirals present their ships for matchup, based
on Agility, with possible modifiers for Fleet Tactics skills and computer
rating (sensors, you know). Side that loses initiative presents a ship
first to be matched by the side that won is how Imperium does it, I\'d
like a level of detail beyond that...however, I want to find a level that
doesn\'t give too much power to either Initiative or Agility, some happy
medium.

   Having won a whole bundle of 2300AD items in a tournament a short 
while ago.  Impressed with quality of Traveller younger brother, I 
started me to think how to integrate this host of material into my 
pre-existing Traveller campaign.  There are a good number of reasons to 
do this, least of all that a future history ought to be consistent with 
the future that is in the making (as any good science fiction writer 
knows) otherwise, suffer the fate of being dismissed.
    The first is that two game systems share the same basic goals and 
commitments to preserving a "Hard SF" presence (notwithstanding, the 
occasional lapses that each Milieu possesses) against the realms of 
Techno-Fantasy or Space Opera of say a Star Wars or Star Trek campaign 
and do not excessively delve into a Dark Future campaign.  
Notwithstanding, the somewhat naive underlying assumption that we are 
either going to have the means to conquer the galaxy and meet with our 
Vilani cousins in a short 100 years (Traveller) without even picking up 
the equivalent of Much Music or any other signals from our interstellar 
brethren; nor is it credible that after nearly blowing the planet into a 
radioactive cinder (T2000) in 300 years mankind will be firmly implanted 
among the Stars (2300AD) with the same nations that are today jockeying 
for supremacy still exist.  In addition, it is uncanny to note how 
certain key dates remain the same across both systems.  Lastly, no 
matter how technically adept the Terrans were it is hard to believe that 
they were able to conquer the territorially vast expanse and the more 
technologically advanced Ziru Sirka in a mere 200 years (without any 
sort of prior armament build-up)!
    Sensing the interest of building a Milieu 21.  Thus, it is only 
fitting that 2300AD be joined with Traveller.  To do would require 
definite changes to the existing Traveller timeline.  Without, further 
ado here is my suggestion for the changed timeline (naturally borrowing 
heavily from Traveller and 2300AD lore) - used in my campaign in the 
period prior to the outbreak of the Interstellar Wars.  I welcome 
critical comments and suggestions.

Antiquity (The Time of Ancients -- Milieu -300 000)

Circa -400 000:		 The Universe is thriving with life with a diverse 
range of alien species inhabiting Chartered Space and beyond. The most 
prominent of these are the Ancients - predominately Grandfather 
(Yaskoydray) and his Children and Grandchildren (clones of himself) who 
have spread rapidly throughout the Stars.  Sharing the region of 
Chartered Space are the variety of proto-Major Races who exist in Stone 
Age or pre-Stone Age conditions (notwithstanding, those selected for an 
uplift programme for certain sections of Humanity and the Vargr) who 
were regarded little more novel animals by the Ancients.  There also 
exists a wide range of other spacefaring Races who while not as 
technologically advanced as the Ancients made there home among the 
Stars.  These include:  Ebers, Pentapods (in reality, an Ancient 
geneered organism), Gn\'aak, Jgd-Il-Jagd, and countless others.  There 
are also civilizations that even further advanced than the Ancients 
themselves.  These include:  the Primordials, Gallifreynocchii, 
inhabitants of X9C4000-0 R, and other of the Great Old Ones whose traces 
are few and lost in the sands of time.  Civilizations rise...and 
civilizations fall.  Also, in this time there were many civilizations 
whose embers flickered in the vast cold interstellar void.  This is 
especially true for the Ancients who never sought to build an 
interstellar empire or assert their sovereignty over space in a 
meaningful way other scattered bases or worlds throughout charted space 
with installations numbering only one or two per standard Imperial 
Sector with a population of one to three Ancients per installation 
(notwithstanding, perhaps of millions of Droyne and secondary life 
forms).  The Ancients preferred to concentrate their vast energies on  
pure research delving into the realms of science to gain insight into 
the of secrets of the known universe (all that comprises time and space) 
rather than empire building.
   
Circa -300 000: 		The Ancients Final War.  Grandfather having failed to 
convince his
Children and Grandchildren to return to the homeworld for an unspecified 
reason (a threat unimaginable proportions was looming from the Coreward 
regions of the Ancients\' sphere).  To protect the Droyne homeworld 
Grandfather unleashes the Final War culminating the virtual destruction 
of most of his children.

More about this Milieu will be known to us if a Milieu -400 000 
Sourcebook ever becomes published.  I am looking for collaboration and 
official recognition for such a project. <hint, hint>

Milieu Pax Vilani or the Grand Empire of Stars

From -300 000 forward the timeline fundamentally remains unaltered 
except the reach of the Ziru Sirka never has it is Rimward frontier 
neighbouring Terra.  Instead, there exists a smattering of alien client 
states (knowledge of the Vilani exists but more in the form of obscure 
trade agreements and long lost dealings with emissaries through which 
that trade is conducted), frontier installations, prison planets 
containing Cultural Dissents and hardened criminals, surrounding yet not 
within 62 light years of Terra.  Being the wild frontier, the Vilani do 
not allow technological leakage to occur.  Therefore, no Jump Drive 
technology has been allowed to enter this area.  The main concentration 
of Vilani power is centred Coreward deep in the Diaspora sector with a 
petty Provincial Governor presides over a large swath of this frontier 
nominally reporting to Sharurshid Governor located further Coreward.

Circa -2528:		On this year a planetary governor of an insignificant 
world called Zeraris
 Cassilldani begin broadcasting "strange" programmes over the planetary 
communications net.  Being intractable collectors of kitsch, the 
Cassilldans over the last decade or so began to build radio collection 
dishes to collect old segments of Vilani soap operas that had long lost 
in the cosmic ocean of the cosmos.  Hundreds of amateur enthusiasts 
began collaborating in the collection of lost data.  The Vilani 
overlords had no problem with the project as it did not interfere with 
the business of running the planet and, in fact, aided the process of 
cultural assimilation of this minor human race in the Rimward frontier 
reaches.  The AAB even became involved in the project as a way of 
retrieving and verifying archival sources (also the screen out any 
potentially subversive data).
   Collectors of the "strange" new programs claimed such programmes had 
been on the public access channel for at least seven years.  However, 
what was most disconcerting for the Vilani and the AAB was these signals 
were not of any known Vilani origin and seemed to be emanating from the 
galactic rim.  Speculation at the AAB hinged on the programmes were the 
signals originated from a Lost Colony or some minor Human race that was 
yet undiscovered by the Empire.  Some even on suggest that the "Uradane" 
were merely a cosmic reflection or space echo of some minor race that 
existed before absorption into the Ziru Sirka.

- -2527:		A report was duly filed with Sharurshid district governor who 
reluctantly agreed (as
exploration of new worlds in an "empty" sector of space was no way 
conducive for career advancement) to appropriation of funds for a Class 
I survey searching for the lost world of Uradanid.  This region of space 
was little explored by the Vilani and not settled by any Vilani colonies 
in historical memory.  Consequently, rumours of a lost colony started by 
a ship that had misjumped from a more Coreward locale was the working 
assumption of the explorers.  The expedition was also required that the 
Vilani bring a fully outfitted jump-capable ship into potentially 
hostile alien territory.  The business castes were reluctant to lose 
potentially more assets in unknown space but, used the rationale that it 
was necessary to shore up support among the alien client-state which 
existed Rimward.  The military castes enthusiastically sanctioned and 
justified the mission in terms of the assertion of Vilani sovereignty 
over an unruly frontier.  With the backing of the academic, 
political/economic and military castes the researchers were granted 
final permission to undertake the expedition.

Late -2523:		1995AD, Uradanid or Terra (Earth) was discovered by the 
Vilani expedition.  After even 
preliminary observation, it was clear that this was no lost colony of 
Vilani origin.  There were too many cultural factions and no trace of a 
prior Vilani presence this far Rimward.  (Prior reports on Terra of the 
"Fires in the Sky" or UFOs ought to be discounted as non-Vilani in 
origin.  And, the proverbial cosmic battle between the "Whites" and 
"Grays" descent from a racial memory dating backing the Ancients\' 
intervention.)  The Vilani were shocked by the proliferation of cultural 
factions (215 plus at least 500 distinct subcultural groupings) and the 
Uradane proclivity toward stockpiling fission weapons.  The 
balkanisation of Uradanid combined with the fission weapons meant that 
if First Contact was to be performed great care and circumspect study of 
the world would have to be undertaken before absorption into the Ziru 
Sirka could be accomplished (with the hope that the natives do not 
discover "Jump Drive" by chance).  Notwithstanding and contrary to the 
mission objectives and the First Contact Specialist Team, a small band 
of Vilani descended to the surface of Terra (in a sufficiently remote 
area) to undertake first hand in-depth observation.  With the remainder 
of the mission returning to Vilani-controlled space and duly filing a 
report with the Sharurshid regional governor and promptly begins to 
gather dust.
   Terra enters the "Years of Twilight" or the "Years of Madness"--the 
21st century as Terra grapples with wreckage left from the Age of 
Extremities.  How many of the events of these years can be directly 
attributed to the Contact Team cannot be ascertained with any certainty.  
This epoch is marked economic stagnation, ethnic strife, return of 
vigilante terrorism, frequent warfare (including limited use of nuclear 
weapons), and near ecological collapse engendered by irrational use of 
planetary resources.   The devastation was global in scope, and did not 
end with the tossing of the last bomb.  The slide through pestilence, 
famine, and anarchy continued for much of the century.  The physical 
destruction was to be found on every continent.  A disaster of equal 
magnitude, however, was the destruction of the world\'s transportation 
network.  Vulnerable ocean shipping fell victim to naval actions by 
rival blocs and increasing, independent private corsair/raider 
operations (with safe harbours guaranteed by rival nations and 
increasingly transnational corporations-who sought to "protect" their 
investments or from deep-ocean bases maintained by rival military 
alliances).  Only Japan retained a large and viable merchant fleet with 
often armed escorts provided by the Nizhny-Novogorod--Magellan Alliance 
and sought to consolidate its position in world trade.  The "Years of 
Twilight" were not necessary an age of unrelieved famine and despair.  
During the recovery populations worked hard, building for themselves and 
their children.  The 21st century was also marked by three important 
movements:  the end of dependence on fossil fuels, the emergence of 
Europe, and the Melbourne Accords.
The Fuel Crisis:  An increase in tensions between the hawks in various 
South West Asian (read:  Middle Eastern) nations led to a re-igniting 
spark of war in the region and the inevitable flame of revolution that 
comes afterwards.  The combination of wars and revolutions caused the 
Americans to forsake the Gulf and concentrate on oil reserves that were 
closer to home.  When the euphoria of revolution, evaporated the almost 
equally inevitable slime of bureaucracy and reaction re-emerged griped 
the polities of the region.  Sparking another round of proportionately 
destructive Jihads, civil wars, "police actions" by outside powers 
trying to gain influence in the region.  The greatest outcome from this 
period was the destruction of a significant proportion of the world\'s 
oil refineries and oil fields with the a good proportion of the oil 
distribution lost as well.  Without the price stabilisation mechanisms 
of OPEC caused wild fluctuations in the price of crude but the trend was 
ever downward as new oil barons sought to oversupply the market 
dominated by an industrialising Third World and a First World which 
hadn\'t forsaken its dependence on hydrocarbons.  This in turn led to a 
rapid depletion of oil reserves elsewhere with the corresponding 
catastrophic ecological effects.  By 2050AD, rising need for energy and 
decreased petroleum supplies had reached the point were true energy 
alternatives were necessary.  The wars had also given impetus for the 
research effort toward utilising energy alternatives most notably in 
France where in 2039AD a workable fusion reactor had been brought 
online.  Rationing of oil and restrictions on its use were hotly debated 
in international forums such as the United Nations.  However, 2090AD 
most of the world\'s industrialised nations had established their own 
hydrogen distribution networks, and a major proportion of the world\'s 
energy needs were met by solar power satellites orbiting the Earth.
Emergence of Pax Europa:  In the power vacuum that followed the partial 
collapse of American hegemony.  In stepped the European Union to assert 
its dominance on the world stage in the early parts of the 21st century.  
The first steps were marked by excessive timidity, undue caution, and 
frequent free-rider and defections by the constituent member-states as 
each of the member-state never yielded full sovereignty to the 
supra-European body.  If anything deepening economic integration 
heightened the fragmentation of the nation-states which resulted in a 
strange mixture of pan-European networks and local semi-autonomous 
clusters fashioning a melange of local networks or production nodes 
linked to the global informational economy which cut across 
nation-states.  These zonal clusters encompassed the local state 
(regional and/or municipal governments with their regional hinterland 
intact) forming mini-economies or economic powerhouses producing highly 
specialised niche goods and services sold on the emerging global 
economy.  Each cluster was self-contained, possessing a decree of 
autarky (in terms of, possessing a self-reproducing level of services 
and industry) but, because of specialisation was interdependent with the 
world economy in which each competed to sell their products.  The old 
representation of an autonomous city-state was reborn in the 21st 
century.  These megacities of the 21st century were thus confederated 
together in a variety of means either in the form of one continuous 
urban sprawl or sometimes in decentralized arcologies with production 
linked together by advanced telecommunications.
    The nation-state, as it was made until this moment in time, was 
effectively "hollowed out" much in the way transnational corporation in 
the 1970s were christened as a hollow corporate entity.  This does not 
mean that the nation-state had lost all importance:  far from it.  
Indeed it remained the institutional site and discursive framework for 
political struggles; and even kept much of its sovereignty albeit as a 
judicial fiction reproduced through mutual recognition in the 
international community.  At the same time its capacities to project 
structural power even within its borders was becoming more limited due 
to a complex triple displacement of powers upward, downward, and to some 
extent outward.  Thus some state capacities were transferred to 
pan-regional, pluri-national, or international bodies or to the local 
level inside the nation-state; others were assumed by emerging 
horizontal networks of power - regional and/or local -which by-passed 
central states and linked regions and localities in several societies.  
These shifts associated with the blurring of a state\'s boundaries and 
growing involvement in decentralised societal guidance rather than 
centralised imperative co-ordination.
    The structural impact on national governments of this global 
centralisation can be called the internationalization of the state.  In 
its most common form is to convert to state in an agency for adjusting 
national economic practices and policies to the perceived exigencies of 
the global economy.  The state becomes a transmission belt from the 
global to the national economy, where heretofore it had acted as a 
bulwark defending domestic welfare from external disturbances.  Power 
within the states becomes concentrated in those agencies in closest 
tough with the global economy - the offices of presidents and prime 
ministers, treasuries, central banks.  Those agencies that are more 
identified with domestic clients - ministries of industries and labour 
ministries become subordinated.
    The new synthesis of globalizing economic relations and the polity 
could be found in the discourse under the rubric of the "new 
constitutionism",  In which, one observed a move toward the construction 
of legal or constitutional devices to remove or insulate the new 
economic institutions from popular scrutiny  or democratic 
accountability. 
    Consequently, the world became divided between the powerful Princes 
and the omnipotent Merchants.  A once vibrant civil society was 
curtailed by increasing austerity which led to an increase by the 
wealthy few for greater "law and order".  Whose agendas felt that much 
of the world\'s population was superfluous and not needed by the global 
economy.  Which seemed  to have been recognised implicitly (through it 
was never openly) by the principle world institutions.  Policies to 
promote economic development had been largely displaced in favour of 
what can global poor relief and riot control.  As the many struggled for 
"to get by", some in the streets and slums turned to revolutionary, 
religious, nationalist, racist, and other demagogic redemption 
ideologies but the majority turned inward to "Do one\'s own thing" 
seeking personal salvation which included becoming a "company-man" or, 
legally and illegally feeding off the circuits of power (e.g. cyberspace 
jockeys or mercenaries) or the most common retreat into a wide variety 
of artificial stimulants (be it old fashioned chemical or the emerging 
cyber-drugs which utilised brain implants to stimulate a wide variety 
neural centres of the cerebellum).  
    For many outside observers christened it a "new medievalism" 
(although, the model that may be more appropriate would be the 
Renaissance city-state of Italian peninsula united through a uniform 
ideology of commerce but fragmented sovereignty).  This pattern of 
fragmentation and integration was also to be found elsewhere in the 
world notably on the North American and African continents including, 
the nation-state of China who sought a reunification of greater Chinese 
empire of prior centuries encompassing all Chinese populations of South 
East Asia and lay claim to parts of Oceania.  Notwithstanding, no area 
other than the European continent possessed a sufficient institutional 
framework (or perhaps History) to make it all work.  The Europeans 
sought through a variety of multilateral forums such as the United 
Nations to establish normalised commercial relations through increasing 
intra-bloc trade and calm international relations.  Many regions balked 
and resisted these proposals fearing perhaps a return to colonialism or 
white dominance (although, the racial composition of Europe was rapidly 
changing thanks to the enlargement of the European Union to East 
swallowing the Baltic states and several oblasts of the Russian 
Federation and to South absorbing many of the nations of the Mahib).
The Melbourne Accords:  The world returned to space in the 2040s with a 
vengeance with a desire of every nation and transnational corporation 
wishing to stake a claim to the last frontier.  By the 50s manned 
missions to Luna with preparations being made for Mars were commonplace.  
By the end of the century, Earth orbit was cluttered with solar power 
satellites and orbital factories.  The conquest of space naturally 
produced disputes concerning territoriality, access to orbits, and the 
appropriateness of specific targets in conflicts.  A continuing 
international discussion (transnational corporations were assumed to 
respect the protocols of the agreements - the fact that many did not 
resulted in further tensions) culminated in a series of treaties and 
agreements collectively known as the Melbourne Accords.
    The Melbourne Accords had three major provisions:  Certain orbits 
around were demilitarised and placed under the aegis of an obscure UN 
bureau the United Nations Space Co-ordinating Agency (UNSCA), power 
satellites properly operated and certified were classified as civilian 
targets (rather than military targets), and other worlds (at that time 
Mars, Mercury, and the Jovian satellites) were open to colonisation by 
all nations after a probationary period under the control UNSCA.  The 
UNSCA also required that all new technological developments in the area 
of space sciences have their patents be duly registered with 
organisation which after a 2 year period would be make the technology 
available to all nations and corporations hoping the ensuring 
competition released by the energies of creative destruction would 
result in building the better mousetrap.  Through the leasing of patents 
the UNSCA was able to support itself and commission the building of 
navigation beacons, standardising astrographic maps, regulating space 
traffic, taking responsibility maintaining the Orbital Quarantine 
Command and Control (located on Gateway Station tethered to the 
Beanstalk) and Traffic Control for the inner worlds of the Solar System, 
and act as a platform for less-developed nations to enter the 
colonisation game.  This gradually eased tensions between various 
nations and ethnic groups who could work in a common endeavour under the 
aegis of the United Nations.  
    By the time, Terrans were participating in the full-scale 
colonisation of Mars in 2080AD, they were overtaxing the planet\'s 
ecology through widespread carelessness from previous long dure of 
industrialisation.  Drastic global warming resulted - a result of 
atmospheric pollution - caused sweeping changes in weather patterns.  In 
turn, these shifts prompted some states to seek food and water by force.  
Through, the initiative of the Europeans, the peace keeping forces of 
the United Nations grew steadily to counter these "food wars," and in 
time propelled the UN into a tool of global governance.
    While Terrans fought each other, Terra\'s wildlife fought against the 
changing environment.  Widespread climate changes, along with the 
shrinkage of natural habitats, took a toll on Terra\'s animal and plant 
populations.  Several species died out, unable to adjust to the 
environmental disruption.
    Physical geographical changes were likewise significant.  Unusually 
heavy storms wracked coastlines.  The Arctic icecap all but vanished, 
and the western half of its Antarctic counterpart unsupported by land, 
melted and fell into the sea.

Circa -2438:		In  2086AD, the theoretical basis for a practical star 
drive was established, and by 2100AD (-2418), several research were on 
their way to demonstrating a prototype.  This however was not the Jump 
Drive of Traveller fame but rather a slower more inefficient drive - the 
Shutterwarp Drive which skimmed and skirted the edges of Jump Space 
rather  than fully entering into the dimensions of  Jump Space (akin, 
the idea developed in Asimov\'s novel Nemesis).  The race for a star 
drive occupied the technological abilities of the major world powers for 
the first half of the century.  In the meantime, many nations were 
actively establishing themselves on the various worlds and worldlets of 
the Solar Systems.
    The first working Starship was produced by the European Space Agency 
in 2136AD, its members shared in the technology and jointly operated the 
ship and its successors.  The first exhibition to Alpha Centauri 
discovered a garden world which was promptly claimed by the nations of 
the ESA (effectively, nilling one of the treaties of the Melbourne 
Accords citing that treaty had validity in Terra\'s system).  Within 
short order, the Argentine Alliance, Manchuria, Canton and Texas built 
and launched their own Starships to Alpha Centauri, Barnard\'s Star (btw, 
no Vilani settlement there), and Wolf 359.  Explorations over the rest 
of the century explored to about 20 light-years from Terra, and 
settlements were established on about 10 extrasolar  worlds.  Worlds 
close to Sol sprouted many national colonies (a policy decided by the 
Alpha Centauri War in which the UNSCA reasserted its jurisdiction by 
arbitrating and dictating the terms of the peace between combatants); 
the diversity enabled colonies to concentrate on specific industries and 
trade with others for their needs thereby lessening dependence on the 
founding nation on Terra.  Notwithstanding as nations explored farther 
from Earth, each was able to colonise whole worlds and exploit them 
without competition from other nations.  By 2199AD, the Second Age of 
Exploration was drawing to a close.  Earth had explored parts of a 
sphere out to 20 light years and established colonies dedicated to 
exploiting the resources of many virgin worlds.   And, nowhere had found 
intelligent life or other spacefaring civilisations.  As for the Vilani 
after the return of the survey vessels the "Uradane Heresy" was quickly 
forgotten as the Cassilldani interest the off-beat soap operas waned 
were replaced by superior  Makhidkarun 3D productions.

Circa -2338:		Exploration breeds commerce; territorial discoveries 
naturally reveal products that can be marketed.  Even with the high cost 
of interstellar travel, there are always some products, services, 
metals, and information that can still can be carried at a profit.  With 
the discovery and settlement of star systems beyond Earth, the 23rd 
century was an era of trade.  Thus, the star faring nations built fleets 
to service their colonies.  Even a self-sufficient colony is useless if 
it cannot provide feedback, products, and information.  Hulls carrying 
colonists to the stars are best used when they carry products and 
services on their return voyages.
   Developments on Earth, however, did not come to a standstill because 
of interstellar exploration.  International rivalries, population 
pressures, crime, class conflict, and ideological disputes continued 
unabated.  
    If anything the Stars provided an escape valve diverting conflict 
away from Earth allowing dissidents the chance to band together into 
so-called "Foundations" to build the New Jerusalem among the Stars.  
Naturally, these societies were often authoritarian or  at the very 
least patriarchal in the early phases of colonisation that prompted the 
formation of more Foundations. 
   Easy travel on and off Earth enabled many people to maintain mobile  
lifestyles without a permanent residence.  Some people (explorers, 
Starship crew, orbital industrial workers) found themselves taxed on the 
basis of a geography that had little in common with one\'s life ladder.  
For that reason, a sense of belonging was being forged out around a 
common humanity rather than what was seen as tribal allegiance to a 
particular nation-state.
    Likewise, a sense of identity was burgeoning among the Spacers and 
Settlers around different Stars that they began to regard as home 
irrespective of the colony\'s "national" point of origin.
   The United Nations and transnational (who were on their way to being 
trans-planetary corporations) worked hard to standardise networks of 
economic, social, political, and human rights be respected irrespective 
national sovereignty.  The problem, as always, was financing despite the 
introduction of an interstellar currency each nation, colony, and 
sometimes company could still issue its own bank note which was then 
valued against the interstellar currency.  Although, values were, in 
theory, pegged and not allowed to fluctuate beyond certain band widths.  
Currency speculators and debtor governments would cause devaluation so 
as to better the terms of trade and lessen national debt known as 
competitive austerity.  Largely, as in the late 21st century the minor 
currencies revolved around the dominant currencies:  ECU, NAFTA Dollar, 
Yen, and the Rand.
    Another significant impetus for the decline of nationalism was the 
advancement of genetic engineering that permitted primitive cloning 
techniques.  The technology was developed for large generation ships 
which were sent to the Stars from the mid-21st century onward as a cost 
saving venture when Shutterwarp  was too expensive or in its infancy.  
These seedbed colonists spread as if dandelions from the Solar System 
possessed no ties to any national government as they grew "in-virto" on 
the journey or sometimes maintained in Chill Berths for the duration of 
the journey as computers would search out for candidate Garden worlds.  
Upon "landing" colonists were educated by computers in rudimentary Earth 
history and institutions but allowed to develop their own path.  
    Other generation ships were also developed which placed the 
passengers in Cold Berths for the entire duration of the voyage.  These 
individuals did however possess national allegiances and ties to the 
ideas and ideals of their own time.  Sometimes, some national 
governments solved their problem with crime by placing criminals also on 
these generational ships with their memories "wiped" or altered to 
forget their previous life.  Nevertheless, a small number of criminals (

previous life.  Nevertheless, a small number of criminals (with memories 
intact) also actively bought placement on these ships (on the assumption 
that it was:  "Better to rule in Hell...than to serve in Heaven.").  
When "awakened" these colonists were disorientated as everything they 
knew and cherished lay light years away with no chance of recovery.  
Therefore, it was time to begin afresh albeit with national 
particularities.
    Finally, the other key impetus behind the decline of nationalism was 
the discovery of alien sentient intelligences.
First Contacts:  That humanity would meet other cultures among the stars 
was enviable.  During the second half of the 23rd century, human 
explorers encountered at least six intelligent species 
(Sung/Xiang{2218AD}, Ebers{2256AD}, Pentapods{2251AD}, Vegans{2280AD}, 
Klaxun{2300AD} and the Kafers{2295AD-which represent a special case}), 
three of them space-faring (Pentapods, Sung, Vegans) within the 50 light 
years area centred around Terra.  With these first contacts came 
cultural diversity and alternate paradigms of knowledge.  With academic 
investigation of alien cultures cane new insights into Earth\'s cultures.  
Products and processes from these in demand on Earth.  And, basic 
information exchange however rudimentary was itself a profitable 
endeavour.
    Further contact with the Sung revealed that their society was based 
upon slavery over the less developed Xiang from a neighbouring star 
system.  This led many Foundations and the tacit consent of some nations 
which leased Starships and crew to the Foundations to lead a moral 
crusade against the Sung.  The Sung who maintained their position was 
non-negotiable resulted in the first interstellar war between Earthlings 
and the Sung in 2241-2243AD.  The Sung surrendered early believing the 
Terrans were in fact the Vilani which following the Sung defiance 
doctrine of Sos-Soon-Atkacharr (the less must give way to the mighty in 
order to learn from them).  Had that not been the case, it is likely 
that the Terrans would have lost unless a xenocidial war would have been 
undertaken against the Sung  and as the war supposedly revolved around 
certain "moral convictions" (excluding, the motive of vast mineral 
wealth of the Xiang homeworld and the unscrupulous nature of certain 
arms manufactures who sought lucrative government contracts) .  Xenocide 
was not an option.  The Sung accepted the conditions of the peace that 
the Terrans had imposed:  planetary sovereignty (Home Rule) for the 
Xiang homeworld, granting of a number of commercial enclaves on each 
world, and binding commercial relations between the Terrans to the Sung 
through forced participation in joint-ventures with Terran 
companies/foundations.  Following, their defeat the Sung following 
custom sent an emissary Coreward into Vilani space believing that 
Cassilldani was the Vilani and consequently the Terrans homeworld the 
informing them of their acceptance of the terms of surrender.  In the 
intervening years, the Vilani regional governor began to dispatch 
heavily cloaked jump capable Starships to monitor the swelling Uradanid.  
No longer content to passively observe the Terrans, the regional Vilani 
High Command formulated a plan involving a pair of alien races to test 
resolve, military strength, and technological capacity of Terrans.  This 
alien race was known as the Kafers.
    The Kafers were a barbaric race that inhabited the far Rimward and 
Trailing edge of the Ziru Sirka.  As barbaric, as they were, they were 
inherently stupid relaying upon certain biochemical processes to 
stimulate intelligence.  The Vilani during First Contact understood this 
and developed synthetic biochemical blocking agents which would return 
the Kafers to a state of passivity.  In the course of time, they also 
learnt the Kafers were dependent upon another alien race - the Yili for 
much of their spacefaring technology.  The Vilani used the Kafers as 
mercenaries but increasingly as prison guards for the prison planets 
maintained Rimward.   The Vilani granted considerable leeway to Kafer 
guards even allowing them to maintain their own sphere of space linked 
together with a primitive jump drive (read again:  Shutterwarp) as long 
as they kept their distance from more Vilani populated space.  In 2250AD 
the Vilani regional High Command (in a highly secret and black project) 
began inculcating and preparing the Kafers for war with the Terrans.  
The Kafers were the perfect tools for the Vilani, the Kafers could be 
relied upon to carry out orders without hesitation, they were expendable 
in the interests of preserving State, and as both the Kafers and the 
Uradane were perfect adversaries for each other As both seemed to have a 
natural proclivity toward unrelenting aggression (without sober 
contemplation), form fractured societies, and seem to have the same 
level of technological development.
    In the meantime, the Terrans felt moderately confident, if not 
downright cocky in their area of space.  Exploration, in spite of that, 
was slowing down due to the natural limitations of Shutterwarp 
technology and astrographic hindrances.  It was felt that perhaps some 
of the alien races may have something to offer to break the 7.7 light 
years barrier.  In the meantime, the search for alternatives has 
commenced.  Namely, the search for dark matter phenomena, such as brown 
dwarfs or rouge planets/proto-stars, artificial wormholes, improved 
Shutterwarp efficiencies, and Shutterwarp tugs.  It was also a period, 
in which Terrans seek to consolidate their gains (as some in the 
Military-Industrial complex realised their victory over the Sung was 
little more than chance) rather than expand with military forces 
sparsely spread on thin tendrils of inhabited worlds called Arms.

- -2232: 		The Kafers strike.  In 2295AD, a research station orbiting 
Arcturus at the far edges of 
Terran space reported contact  with the Starships of an unknown race.  
Attempts at communication were unsuccessful, and the alien vessels left 
the system.  Within three years they returned and swept past the system 
to Eta Bootis system.  The aliens attacked and defeated the fleets there 
and land troops on the colony world of Aurore.  Terrans had its first 
close-up look at the Kafers.
    Reinforcements for the Terrans began to flow further up the line of 
worlds thus far colonised, and eventually, Kafer fleets were driven back 
to Arcturus, leaving ground troops on Aurore to harass the colonists.  
The fighting between the races has continued ever since.  It has become 
obvious that the Kafers do not want peace.  Co-ordinating the Invasion 
is "Triumphant Destiny" none other the regional Vilani senior military 
commander.  Soon the war bogs down into a stalemate with each side 
moving the front back and forward.  In late -2227 (2304AD), "Triumphant 
Destiny" feels enough supply bases have been established and with an 
ample buffer zone allowing a retreat into Kafer space (thus, ultimately 
Vilani space) to mount a full scale assault on Terra itself.  It was at 
this critical conjuncture that dissension breaks out in the Kafer 
command whereby rival factions of the Kafer Associate broke away from 
"Triumphant Destiny" fleet and try to consolidate power in Kafer space.  
Left critically understaffed "Triumphant Destiny" leads the remainder of 
the Kafer fleet into battle around the proximity of Queen Alice\'s Star 
(in the Battle of Beowulf (after beating back an abortive mutiny attempt 
by his Kafer First Officer - "Pain Giver" that occurred en route).   
Fortunate for the Terrans, a shattering strike against "Triumphant 
Destiny\'s cruiser causes the power plant to go critical and overload.  
With the loss of the tactical genius of  "Triumphant Destiny", the 
remaining Kafers are confused.  Some fight mercilessly to the end, some 
fight each other, some retreat to safer systems including back into 
Kafer Space.  From -2227 to -2224 (2304-2307AD), the Kafers continue 
engage in sporadic fighting and providing occasional support for ground 
support left over from the Invasion and striking from cleverly hidden 
bases protecting their flank (Kafer space).  The Terrans note the 
decrease in the ferocity of the conflict but continue to push the Kafers 
back to Arcturus where the front would vie back and forth sporadically 
with the Kafers making inroads as much as three systems before Terrans 
could assembly a force strong enough halting the advance.  The High 
Commands of the assembled nations fighting the Kafers, sensed a second 
Invasion force may be assembling beyond "Human Space" therefore, the 
best strategy was to hold the line and leave colonial units to "mop-up" 
remaining Kafer units secluded in Human space.  The lack of a unified 
command and relative success in holding the line beyond which 7.7 light 
years barrier meant that Terrans could do little more than hold 
defensive positions against the intermittent Kafer incursion.
    In the aftermath of the Battle of Beowulf -2227 (2304AD), while 
giving pursuit to the Kafer space fleet back to Kimanjano.  The 
International space task force found hostile ground fire from the 
planetside that allowed the majority of the Kafer fleet to escape 
further up the arm into safe haven of Kafer space.  Realising that a 
"mopping up" dirtside was needed, if efforts to flush out the enemy  the 
international efforts commenced orbital assault against the Kafer ground 
encampments (the first by the Terrans which had traditionally relied 
upon either orbital or ground assault operating independently of each 
other).  In the course of fighting, the victorious Terrans came an 
incinerated remains of a Kafer Crawler ("Shah shuch*").  Not uncommon, 
in a battlefield.  However, inside they found the charred remains of a 
human being in an environmental suit of no known design.  Naturally, 
believing it was a "friendly"  who had been taken prisoner by the 
Kafers.  The autopsy (to aid in determining the identity of the victim) 
revealed that "Kimanjano Man" contained a slightly different DNA 
structure than the human norm.  All this was kept a secret and for only 
the top echelons of the military and political establishment.  Theories 
presented ranged that it was human who was in deed caught in the 
cross-fire and was trying to escape using Kafer equipment (discounted 
because of the sophistication of the design of the environment suit) 
others maintained that it was the product of a rogue Foundation, such as 
the Provolutionists (who were known to "improve" the human condition 
through genetic or cybernetic means) to that this was Rousseau who 
represented a human abducted by aliens centuries ago who had woken from 
a Cold Sleep.  The" Mystery of Kimanjano Man" would remain that until, 
the Terrans would meet the Vilani and until that time, "Kimanjano Man" 
would remain on an isolated Australian biological research station on 
Luna frozen in a cold berth.
    The real story behind "Kimanjano Man" is as following:  There 
existed an isolated Vilani quasi-religious sect known as the Aiag cult 
which existed from the time that the Vilani took to the Stars.  It was a 
monotheistic religion that held that great warm, loving, Mother-God, lay 
somewhere Rimward of Vland among the Stars.  Furthermore, it maintained 
that Vland was not true homeworld of all humanity (a somewhat heretical 
idea in any epoch prior to confirmation of the Solomani Hypothesis) and 
that all Vilani ought to strive to the embrace of the Mother to live in  
a condition of everlasting love.  At various conjunctures of the history 
of the Vilani, this religion provided a useful outlet for a number of 
people to embrace the explorer ethic ("questing for Mother")...it is 
even said that some of the faith adherents included a number of Vilani 
Igsiirdi prior to it being declared a heresy, whereby the disciples were 
banished to Rimward frontier of the Empire.  Banishment caused it to 
become a secret society throughout Ziru Sirka when a young 
impressionable Vilani (and devout adherent to Aiag) navy officer had 
heard the discussion of using the Kafers, he became convinced that the 
Terrans were emissary angels from the Mother.  Unfortunately, for him he 
was captured by the Kafers before receiving communion with the angels 
and he did not bother to learn Kafer.

- -2224:		On September 23, 2307AD famed Czechoslovak astronomer Elena 
Asweathova discovered 
evidence of a brown dwarf in a fairly barren region of space just beyond 
the American Arm.  However, the strategic initiative made possible by 
her find sent a shock wave through command staff of America, Germany, 
and Australia.  BD-111 094307\'s astrographic location offered units from 
the American arm a path enabling them tend-run  the current French Arm 
salient of the Kafer conflict.  Instead, units the route that passed 
through BD 111 094307 could enter the rear flank of suspected Kafer 
space by emerging at system SS-27 6854.  This attack from the rear 
option helped to give BD-111 094307 its lasting nickname - it was indeed 
the back door into Kafer space.
     It was also noted in the various national intelligence and forensic 
agencies that signs of a non-Kafer species had been discovered on the 
wreckage of Improved Alpha-class battleship that had been battered into 
non- functioning junk at the Battle of Beowulf.  The clues recovered 
were fairly sparse, mostly food and body tissue that had virtually been 
discorporated by explosions and drilled into nearby plastic components.  
Speculation immediately centred on the existence of a mystery race that 
served the Kafers in some technical capacity.  The nations of the 
Alliance fighting in the French Arm immediately made their combined 
discoveries of Back Door and the mystery race known to heads of other 
nations.  The rest of the other nations tended to agree with the 
analysis of the Alliance but counselled not to open a second front using 
the Back Door not without a global consensus.  However, it was felt that 
more information  was needed regarding the mystery race and the Back 
Door offered the ideal way to attempt to scout it out.  In the hopes of 
brokering a coalition against the Kafers, or at the very least a 
separate peace.  Thus, Operation Backdoor was conceived.  Which would 
form the basis for extended reconnaissance of Kafer space for a possible 
counter-Invasion.
In -2222 (2309AD) the scoutship, Cat\'s Feet, comes across the garden 
homeworld of the Yili on SS-27 6854  (Ssuushni\'a).  Yili cannot agree 
that the complete destruction of the Kafer race is necessary or even 
desirable.  A number of Yili delegates, agree to accompany the Cat\'s 
Feet back to Terran space.  The Yili have no knowledge of the larger 
Vilani Imperium looming further Coreward.  Following the success of  
Operation Backdoor, further reconnaissance missions are commissioned 
through the Backdoor as a way to break the stalemate on the French Arm.
    An Invasion plan -2221 (2310AD) is drawn up in which a pre-emptive 
strike with a tailored biogenetic weapon would be made against the Kafer 
homeworld using Backdoor then sending reinforcements arcing across the 
Arcturus gap.  A bloodlust and an appetite for revenge on the part of 
colonial fleet, arm their ships with Thermonuclear missiles (H-bombs) to 
blast the Kafers out of existence.  Late 2310AD, the Kafer homeworld is 
struck with the full intensity of a human counter-Invasion lacking 
strategic leadership from either the Vilani or their own kind, the Kafer 
palisade falls to pieces.  Ground forces bring together the remaining 
Kafers into large reservations.  What\'s more, a fervour and zeal 
spearheaded by colonial forces lead to attacking the concentration camps 
with nukes.  It was estimated that 85% of the Kafer population died in 
the onslaught.  The reaction of the Yili to the holocaust of the Kafers 
and knowing many of their own kind would have exterminated in the 
strikes, the Yili begin to commit mass suicide.  Finding that their Yili 
allies are literally dying on them, the attacks subside and culling the 
Kafers into reservations dispossessed of technology of any kind; the 
Terrans stopped their nuclear campaign.  Work commenced on biogenetic 
approach as a means of limiting the Kafer population and rendering them 
"stupid".  The Yili population also declined to 85% of its previous 
number stabilised in part to a large infusion of antidepressant drugs 
supplied by the Terrans.  The Yili are left disoriented and with an odd 
assortment of castes left.  The Terrans now the effective masters of 
Kafer space went on to incorporate this vast swath of territory into 
their own domain.  Still lacking an effective means to cross the 7.7 
light years barrier, the Terrans seek alternatives.  During the course 
of the war, the United Nations steadily grew in power and responsibility 
as it promoted itself as a sort of International High Command under 
whose aegis co-ordination of battle fleets and troops could be 
undertaken.

- -2211:		In - 2211 (2320AD), a Beta Yili affectionately nicknamed "Bert"  
and a research station
(whose acronym was ERIN) together with decoding the Eber dance, in Alpha 
Centuri system succeeds in building a prototype Jump Drive.  Finally, 
the Stars beyond the local neighbourhood are open to Humanity.  At 
first, it was thought that they stumbled upon an inefficient Shutterwarp 
but when it is demonstrated that a gravity well need not be present to 
discharge its engines the Jump Drive becomes more widespread.  
Similarly, the discoveries lead to harnessing of the graviton thereby 
laying the basis for artificial gravity and reactionless thrusters.  It 
is not long before the Terrans turn the sights to further Coreward 
expansion.  In -2201 (2330AD) in an isolated system in the Diaspora 
sector, an American expedition comes across an isolated Vilani mining 
station...  The Americans understanding the significance of their 
discovery bypassed United States Space Command and went on to United 
Nations Organisation.  Terrans found themselves sharing the cosmos with 
a vast ancient empire of alien humans - the Vilani.  Their empire 
spanned hundreds of light years.  Terrans were awe inspired, bewildered, 
and frightened.  When reports began to drift back to the regional Vilani 
governor, she never conceded Vlani role (nor, was it widely known) in 
Kafer war and viewed Terrans with paternalistic intentions.  As she 
sought to co-opt the Terrans, so as to gain greater favour in the 
Imperial household who had knowledge of the existence of the Terrans 
(dealing with minor races was a local concern after all).
 
- -2191:		In 2350AD, a combination of Manifest Destiny, unreasoning zeal, 
war fever, and racism (why 
 should "alien" humans govern the cosmos) reached a critical mass 
initiated the First Interstellar War with an almost religious fervour 
and crusade to wrest the Stars from the Vilani.  It was sheer chance, 
once again, that the Terrans won as the Technological level of the 
Terrans never exceeded TL10.5 (albeit TL10.9 in some areas) and was very 
heterogeneous spread amongst the different nations/blocs and colonies 
whilst the Vilani Imperium was a uniform TL11.9 encroaching TL12 in some 
areas.  What follows is Traveller cannon...the UN begins to organise 
itself into a true world government in response to the need to central 
resources for the protracted war effort against the Vilani.
 
- -2018:		2500AD Nth Interstellar War ends thanks to the Terran 
development of Jump-3 Drive, Terrans swarm across Ziru Sirka.

 -976:		3542AD  End of the Rule of Man.

AND, THE REST AS THEY SAY IS HISTORY.

1210:  A long forgotten minor race emerges returns back to space after 
centuries of Solomani and Imperial oppression to  wreak havoc.   The 
emerging Children of Earth face an old foe whose destiny they believe 
lies in retaking the Stars.   Against the backdrop  the confusion of the 
virus, the petty feuds, etc ...the Kafers are back.

You remember correctly; ships split their acceleration between evasion,
maneuver, and aiming their spinal mount. 

THere is a high-guard-like "reserve" - 2 range bands farther away than the main
bodies - but no rules for bypassing, etc. As you say, by the time you\'re
getting into sneaking past enemy fleets you probably need a hexgrid.

You are quite welcome. Being a Gnarly Old Fart(tm)
wannabe, I\'ve noticed that alot of Traveller is
starting to/has come true in the Real World(tm).

A world-wide communications net, cybernetic tongues,
hand-sized communicators, battledress, exploring planetary
surfaces with probes from orbit, computer chips that can
link to a human brain, ground-based laser/particle beams
that can take out orbital satellites..kinda neat to
actually be living it.

BTW, Clif, apologies for not providing the location of
the spaceport. I didn\'t remember seeing it in the article.
ABC.com should still be carrying the story in their
archives, though.

  The suggested fighter rules from JTAS #14 would now be largely obsolete.
Arguably, escorts and fighters have defined roles in HG, it\'s just not meant
to be truly significant in determining the result of the exchange of the 
main fleet elements (although apparently really sick escort designs are key
to scrubbing off enemy spinal factors).

>It might also speed up the game a bit, as there will be a lot of massive

  The problem (asides from distaste at the prospect of yet more attempts
to return fighters to their dominant role evidenced in SW :| ) is that
the "overmatching" copied from _Imperium_ (a game wherein a fleet action
is meant to take 5-15 minutes) implies very short weapons ranges and a
movement mechanism that involves near-teleportation (compared to weapons
ranges) by the ships of the initiative advantaged fleet. It might work
tolerably well for an age-of-sail game, though.

...
>Seriously, I assume you mean the "reality" of some published SF books
>involving fleet combat, right?

  Of course not. Real world physics as modified by whatever
Traveller-specific technologies; i.e. Newtonian physics apply to combat
operations if a given
rules set goes to that level of detail.

>I don\'t think play balance would change so much as fleet construction
>and deployment. The victory might go to more than the biggest guns

  Which, as per the long-running "Fighters & Carriers vs Battleships" thread
on SF-CONSIM, is slightly absurd. Given Traveller hardware and simple geometry
fighters can not threaten a battle line directly, and the attempt to change
that requires a weapon system analogous to real world torpedoes or anti-shipping
missiles, which simply do not exist in (OTU) Traveller.

...
>Much as I like the simplicity of it, what sensible reality is modelled by
>having fleets line up like age of sail men-of-war? Space is so big that

  Which is precisely what _Imperium_ does; _High Guard_ appears to assume
that an entire fleet can be deployed with in a volume that would fit within
effective range of an enemy also deployed throughout a similar volume. As
such, any ship can engage any other target(s), and the entire thing could
be moved to a hex-based system with a minimum of trouble. _Imperium_ could
not be meaningfully played as a mini\'s game because the assumptions in its
combat system are meant to be simple for playing speed rather than realism.

  Roughly speaking, Jutland was a number-crunching slugfest, and strategic
necessity dictates that a battle must occur at some point.

  How about "aim own spinal mount at cruiser*" and "vaporize insolent little
bugs with turret mounts"? It\'s pretty safe to assume that the enemy can detect
me from his own platform, at least under HG2 and in most Traveller games.

 * IIRC, MCS actually allows for this to be a use of maneuver-G\'s, and it\'s
about time that someone covered it.

  An exploration of how the BB you describe would "maneuver away from contact"
might also be enlightening, as high maneuver and low opportunity cost of
employment are supposed to be the only things fighters really have going for
them.

  Why not just plow right past them? Both sides will score a higher proportion
of hits than the standard HG2 tables would indicate (witness the close attack

while the rather expensive fighters will be scrap. At closer ranges agility
would also count for less.

  Actually, at a sufficiently close range the potential number of hits that
could be scored would approach ROF, which is tolerably well covered in the
2300 AD space combat module _Star Cruiser_ - a bigger ship may choose to
eliminate a smaller element by simply over-running it and taking an additional
fire phase with available weapons.

  Interesting. What happens if only one side deconcentrates its battle
squadrons (which is what they\'re for, of course) in the above example?

should prove fun, if a little costly.  Ron is a computer professional and
has hired a dedicated server to devote to his favorite SFRPG.  At the same
time he will have a chance to practice some development skills that he is
hoping to perfect.  For my part, I am just a fan who wants to see this
project blossom.  Here\'s the idea:

This new place is www.downport.com , a domain (name) and server (at a large
hosting company) dedicated to Traveller.  The project belongs to all players
/ fans who want to enjoy and/or contribute to it.  If you have developed
some good web content for the game and are tired of having it lost at the
end of a forty character URL in a corner of the Internet, check out
Downport.com as a possible new host for it.

Or perhaps you know of some good stuff that someone publish back along, but
it\'s languishing unattended on a university server somewhere.  We\'d like to
track that person down and get permission to transfer it over, maybe
updating it in the process.

Some of us have our own pages on the web, many on "free" hosting services.
It\'s good to have our material close by while we\'re developing it.  But
there may be a day in the future, when we are working on other projects,
that the time comes to enshrine the finished project at a permenent address.

Then again, maybe you just don\'t want to bother with all that is involved in
having your own site and would like to have Downport.com set it to HTML from
the get go.

All of these are valid scenarios that meet our idea of what a Traveller
domain should be.  Perhaps it will become a hub from which much of the
Traveller content on the web spokes out.  Or maybe a museum, or even the
"Encyclopedia Galactica" of Traveller (that\'s our dream).

Today it\'s an infant.  Please take a look and give us your opinion on how we
should raise this baby.  You can forward comments to me, to Ron\'s webmaster
link on the pages, or to the TML for discussion if appropriate for this foru
m.

Even better, there\'s a guy (who happens to be paralysed) whose using _thought_
to control a computer.
He has electrodes taped to his head, and he can move a mouse pointer around
the screen and select things with it.

 More precisely, he\'s consciously regulating the current flow in a small part
of his brain by "thinking" in a way that causes the electrode to activate and
more the pointer.

Quite apart from it\'s implications for control circuitry, think what this
means for "training" brain usage. It\'s an extension on the old bio-feedback
techniques, but one that could allow people to practice "thinking" in a
particular way.

  How about "aim own spinal mount at cruiser*" and "vaporize insolent

bugs with turret mounts"? It\'s pretty safe to assume that the enemy can 
detect

I think my idea works if the rules allow some kind of difference between
"suspected contact" and "fully realized firing solution". Remember,
first spinal mount hit wins. Several possible contacts get passed up to
CIC from sensor ops, which ones are real, and which ones have spinal
mounts on them? Which ones can you safely ignore?

The failure to break contact would (eventually) clue the BB commander
in to what he was up against. The BB commander then starts treating
the contacts as fighters - and dies as one of the suspected contacts turns
into another capital ship with a spinal mount, just arrived into engagement
range while the fighters were keeping the BB busy.

  Why not just plow right past them? Both sides will score a higher 
proportion
of hits than the standard HG2 tables would indicate (witness the close 
attack
rules suggested in JTAS #14) but the battleship (or cruiser...) will 
survive

My idea makes the assumption that the standard HG2 hit and
damage tables apply to ships that are defending themselves, and that
some kind of bad things happen to ships that don\'t - thus forcing warships
to engage, rather than ignore. Another sub combat inspired idea - if
two subs are sneaking around each other, the one that goes to full power
to get away or catch a different target is usually the one that dies.

Good question. I\'m thinking something along the lines of expensive
ships, meat grinders, and a reluctance to dump all your ships into a pot
with all the enemy ships and gamble it all at one go.

Evenly matched fleets should be a rarity. No sane admiral is going to
dump an outmatched fleet into the middle of a toe-to-toe slugging match
if he has any alternatives. If the smaller fleet can\'t jump away, or can\'t 
entirely give up the system, it might disperse for Space Denial duties.
(Space denial: I don\'t control it, but I can still make you
pay dearly for using it.). The bigger fleet goes a-hunting, but doesn\'t
have the ability to send everyone after each enemy detachment.
The smaller fleet might be able (with good fleet tactics) to arrange some
locally superior firepower.

Well, "The Ransom of Red Chief" is always a wonderful model. For those
not familiar with it, some would-be gangsters kidnap a kid from a
moderately well off family, figuring to hold him for ransom.

Alas, the kid is a sort of cross between Calvin (of Calvin & Hobbes)
and Dennis the Menace. The response from the parents is pretty much
"*You*\'ve got him, *you* keep him!" In the end, the bad guys wind up
paying the parents to take the kid back!

You forgot to mention that a Protector is *fanatically* devoted to
his/her bloodline. If they are wiped out, he/she may be able to
transfer the protector instinct to his *race*. Childless protectors (ie
racially devoted) have been known to decide that a race restricted to
its own planet but that has killed people who have landed there, is
enough of a danger to the Protector\'s race to arrange for an asteroid
impact the wipe out the planet-bound race.

Paranoia is a normal state of being for a Protector. But a sort of
modified paranoia. They assume that all creatures not of their
bloodline/species are a danger to their bloodline/species until
*proven* otherwise.

I will mention *one* of the many changes that occur when a hominid
makes the transition from breeder to Protector. A Pak breeder is about
as bright as a chimp. Maybe. A Pak protector is more intelligent than
any normal human. 

One description put it this way. For any given task, and set of tools,
there\'s an optimal answer. A Protector will see this answer as soon as
it considers the problem. 

This means that for a protector, "free will" is a rather inapplicable
concept.

In standard Traveller Universes, I\'d expect that the Protectors would
have learned that trying to wipe out star faring species was
counter-productive. On the other hand, they\'d have also taught the
other star-faring species that messing with Pak is a *bad* idea. 

Hmmm. In a Traveller universe that contains Pak & Protectors, that
could be why Grandfather left. He found out about them and wasn\'t
willing to see how they\'d react to his messing with their relatives
(humaniti).

That reminds me of one of Eric Frank Russell\'s short stories. The super
aliens grab a human, hook him up to some sort of "truth detector", and
start pumping him for info about his race\'s capabilities. 

He realizes that they think that humans are native to the system they
picked him up in. So he starts feeding them statements that are
absolutely true, but that mislead them greatly. For example, they ask
about population. He tells them the approximate population of his
homeworld. And then goes on to so say that he\'s not sure of the total
population of his species, but that it\'s around 100,000 times the
population of "this planet". 

When they ask about his age (or was it lifespan), he mentions that when
he was born his homeworld had significant icecaps. The colony planet
rather obviously hasn\'t had such for at least 20 or 30 thousand years.
:-)

I forget *how* he convinced them that he didn\'t need a starship to move
between systems. Probably the fact that the colony planet had no
starships combined with more fast talking.

Anyway, by the time they were done interrogating him, *they* were
sweating bullets and apologizing...

I haven\'t read the Vang books, just the cover blurbs. Still, I can

Psi shielding should work ok. And they likely have a range limit. Also,
as we learned in "World of Ptavvs" that was that they first appeared in,
Slavers are *dumb*.

Tnictipun(sp) are sneaky bastards.

Hey, how many of *you* are aware that our presence in Lebanon (when the
Marine Barracks got blown up) was the *second* time we\'d been doing
"peacekeeping" in Lebanon IN THIS HALF OF THE CENTURY!

Or that we fought with Korea late in the 1800s (it may have even been
the early 1900s, I don\'t have my references handy)

Under MCS, surface hits (all that a fighter can really do against 
large opponents) can degrade spinal mounts by damaging the 
aperture, reduce power available to the ship by damaging radiators 
and most crucially can destroy sensors - thus eliminating the ships 
ability to fire any weapons.

[Pause to look at the MCS tables]

A good sized TL15 fighter laser system when used by a squadron 
will (on an average roll) inflict a surface hit on a ship of up to 2 
million tons. On smaller ships the squadron will inflict multiple 
and/or heavy/critical surface hits. And providing they are sensible 
enough to stay out of point blank range, the capital ship will 
(barring gunnery skills of 6 or more) be quite literally unable to hit 
them.

In my book, that makes fighters a useful asset in a military action.
Of course, this only applies when using Bruce\'s MCS, and YMMV

As long as we\'re debating physics, _none_ of the existing Traveller rules
really model the effects of strategic in-system maneuvering. All of them
have fleets on essentially matched courses, slugging it out.  If you
expand to a strategic level, battles become a series of passes at
relatively high speeds, as squadrons maneuver to pass close to the enemy,
then return for another pass (or keep going).

The exceptions will be battles for a \'stationary\' location, like a planet
or asteroid mine. 


<start non-canon>
Suppose that fighters, instead of being small and hard-to-spot, are
deliberately very visible, meant to imitate the signature of larger
warships. Then when the squadron closes, the enemy has only a brief time
to decide which ship to shoot at, so many shots will hit fighters rather
than more important warships, which lets teh warships escape for another
pass.

This _does_ reduce fighter pilots from \'trained killers\' to \'fancy
targets\', of course :-)

AFAIK, progress was made on the development of the link between silicon and
human neurons. At the time of the story, which I\'m kicking myself for not
keeping, the chip was able to recognize a signal from the neuron. It
couldn\'t
*do* anything with that signal nor could it differentiate aspects of the
signal.

It\'s got a long way to go before it\'s good for something. BTW, I\'m finding
all these stories in the Tech sections of at the sites of ABC, MSNBC, and
CNN. Another good site is: http://www.cmpnet.com/

Exactly! This one just blew me away! I knew the U.S. Air Force had
researched the use of brainwaves to control fighter aircraft some years
back (anybody remember Clint Eastwood in the movie "FireFox?)
but I thought it didn\'t pan out.

By the way, there\'s also been some progress in the development
of "memory plastic". Of course, I didn\'t keep the story.

I\'ll start keeping these stories and emailing them to those of you who want
the info.

Another development that has some incredible ramifications is the 
development of a "dry" polymer-based battery. It\'s a composite material can
be
made any size or shape; the larger the size, the larger its capacity.

Imagine a house with walls made of this stuff. I\'ve seen another story in
which the material is under consideration as material for car bodies.

Again, lots of research and testing is still necessary for all these
advancements but they\'re pretty wild nonetheless and even more so because
they\'re *real*!

The UTP (Universal Task Profile) was published in the first issue of the
Travellers\' Digest as a full article, near the back,  "Using Skills
Effectively".  A condensed version was republished in each issue following,
ending when it was incorporated into the MT rules (announced in Digest 9).
So, if you have a copy of any of the first eight Travellers\' Digest, then
you have a copy of the "approved" CT task system.

Fighters in Mayday and the T4 basic ship combat system are able to make
surface hits against large ships, but I felt this was implausible because
these systems destroy entire subsystems, regardless of weapon or target
size. A fighter with a 130 Mj laser does far more surface damage to a
battleship that the battleship does with its 750 Mj laser to the fighter.

Of course, the fighter has less armor and will probably get blown out like
a candle flame. However, a surface hit has the same probability of taking
out a 50 dton missile bay as a 2 dton laser lance, regardless of how
powerful the weapon is.

I use the Role-Playing Space Combat System, where you have to exceed the
target\'s armor rating to get even a surface hit. I felt this was more
realistic, and the sensor rules are better too.

Walter\'s suggestions that fighters are useful for pickets or sensor
platforms, and that ignoring them leaves support ships vulnerable are good,
but I didn\'t think any ship combat system went into this kind of detail. If
fighters are to play this kind of role there should be rules for it, and
not simply declare that battleships have to stop when engaged by an enemy
of any size or capability.

What I don\'t want to see is fighter squadrons and battleships having no
different strategic value.

I haven\'t used the "Military Combat System", does it deal with combat
between ships of different scales plausibly? If "Bruce" is Bruce Allen
Macintosh it sounds interesting. Is it available on the web?

There\'s actually a whole thread going on in sf-consim (parallel thread
evolution at work) about deployment in (hex-based) sf games. A main 
subject is to try and find a good reason in any quasi-realistic game not
to just stack your whole fleet in a single hex. On the balance, we\'re 
failing to do that. (I suggest anyone interested in joining in *not* post
here on TML but join sf-consim, at onelist.com.) 

I\'m considering adding to my MCS (high-guard-like, but with four range
bands) a "vanguard" in addition to the main body and the reserve.
The vanguard would be one range band closer to the enemy than the 
main fleet. Since light rapid-fire weapons can be painful even against armoured
ships at short ranges (scrubbing off surface fixtures) a fleet might 
deploy its own lightly-armoured fast ships into the vanguard to attack
the enemy vanguard before the whole fleets close to short ranges.

I was going to require the vanguard to spend more G\'s on maneuver than the
main fleet (which helps keep capital ships out of it, since they need 
some maneuver margin to aim their spinal mounts.)

There is a "spread fire" rule that lets ships with big weapons batteries
reduce the damage in exchange for a bonus to-hit (firing multiple turrets
at different points instead of concentrated.) This gives capital ships some
chance of hitting tiny evasive fighters. I\'m also tweaking the hit probabilities
a little. Still, the goal was that fighters that can stand off are hard to 
hit. If I do put in a "vanguard" rule that gives another reason to use it - 
screening/anti-fighter elements would be close enough to have some chance of
hitting the little vermin.

Extremely plausible (if I may say so.) Borrowing from Battle Rider, 
damage is resolved by subtracting the target size from the weapon damage
(and adding a d6), so a damage=7 fighter laser firing at a size=13
strike cruiser will be unable to have any effect, while the same laser
firing at a size=4 fighter will get lots of critical hits. 
Weapon damage values and target sizes etc. are all on a log scale (so the
math works better than Battle Rider.) As an added advantage this makes
dealing with fleets or squadrons pretty easy (a squadron of ten fighters
just adds 3 to the damage of its weapons no matter what those are, etc.) 
Penetration is tracked seperately from damage (so a battery of wimpy lasers
can do lots of damage to unarmoured targets but only surface hits on big
ships.)

It isn\'t on the web yet because it\'s a work in progress, but I\'m willing to
email drafts to people who want one.

Ahh, yes, I\'ve not read those in quite a while.  Seems in one book a
human turned Protector found out about those Martians living under the
surface of Mars.  Free water is poisonous to them, so he arranged to have
a large cometary body whack the surface, poisoned the entire species.

Absolutely.  The human turned Pak in another story moved to an outworld
colony, when he found out the original Pak were coming, and that they\'d
consider these \'smart breeders\' a threat, breeders that had failed to
breed true, so to speak, and took over the colony and started to create
more of our kind of Protectors, building starships and weapons, and went
out to meet the original Pak.  Lots of humans died when he took over the
colony, but there was no other way to deal with the threat.  No remorse,
from his point of view, it simply had to be done.

  _High Guard_ & _TCS_ ignore in-system maneuvering; TCS pretty much assumes
that it\'s not relevant as the Intruder always wants something in the inner
system (target, L-Hyd, engagement) - if they didn\'t they would have jumped to
deep space to conceal their movements.

  As the most important targets are not (for socio-political reasons?) subject
to annihilative bombardment a high speed pass (allowing for only a round or
two of combat (and deployment of _lots_ of BB\'s :> ) between fleets might not
be acceptable, but it\'s a very poor way to interdict enemy access to most
locations; loitering and keeping V low enough to offer protracted combat will
allow the choice of inflicting much greater damage.

>The exceptions will be battles for a \'stationary\' location, like a planet

  This may very well be a good enough justification for the simplification to
be "correct" in 80%+ of the cases.

  There certainly should be a range where smaller units can use high DV to
avoid any reasonable response (except against Det-Lasers, by definition),
and given Trav weapon ranges (grav focussing?) they could be effective
themselves at that range. Close enough and a targets effective Agility is,
IIRC, halved under MCS?

  To be able to damage an armoured capital ship I assume that these fighters
are high-G units armed with maximum output laser "spinal mounts"? While I
don\'t have a problem with it, some people might also be surprised by their
being allowed to group batteries for enhanced effect.

>In my book, that makes fighters a useful asset in a military action.
>Of course, this only applies when using Bruce\'s MCS, and YMMV

  I\'ve never denied that fighters have a role; it\'s just that at this time
I can only consider the somewhat mysterious manner in which they "pin" an
enemy to be more than faintly ridiculous.

  Frankly, the HG approach to ECM/ECCM really bothers me - the "compare
relative computer levels and apply as a mod" bit; I much prefer the mod being
a firers advantage only - thus a model/8fib comp firing on a cutter with a
model/1 foes receive a +7 bonus, but the cutter would not receive a -7 hit
DM in return - what, it\'s a stealth proto-PacMan? How\'s that for heresy?

  There are probably a lot fo better ways to model that stuff than the
_Imperium_ system. It might be hard to do worse, IMHO.

  Annoyingly, HG gives an advantageous inititative mod to the _larger_ fleet
(counting only ships of 100 Dt and up); _Imperium_ favours the _smaller_
fleet, although again (IIRC) ignoring fighters. OC, the _Imperium_ combat
system already massively rewards having more ships so it\'s quite probably
simply a game balance issue.

  Wouldn\'t this suggest a mechanism of effectively random match-ups
between pre-determined ship groupings? What would be the eventual
effects of capital ships being designed with integral float-plane, er,
I mean fighter, scouting squadrons (or sensor drones, for that matter).
Weapon ranges are obviously longer than any effective telescope can
recover useful EMS data; drives must be reactionless, too.

  How do you deliberately match up units per Imperium when you apparently
can\'t ID target class? How the heck can you have any hope of firing at a
unit if you can\'t guess it\'s tonnage to within 2-3 orders of magnitude?

  A ship that isn\'t evading is _very_ easy to hit - in fact, at shorter
ranges an Agility-0 target should take hits roughly equal to ROF; sadly
the rules don\'t quite reflect this (although arguably a HG2 fan can assume
that the loss of all power fuel isn\'t a mission kill to power plant energy
output termination, but a surrender or disengagement (!) due to the lack of
any ability to evade (and thus utterly helpless in mist battles).

  It is far from clear that a ship that isn\'t evading but whose armour is
proof against pin-pricks would take more damage from said pin-pricks (the
rules in question should allow surface hits - HG2 doesn\'t).

  Traveller space combat is sub combat? Cool - where are the sonar rules?

...

  So concentrating your battlefleet (i.e., Jutland, Trafalgar, etc.) is
to be defined as wrong? The strategic rules will reflect this?

Well, reactionless drives are part of original CT. Is effective long-range

Considering how many Canon capital ship designs include fighter
squadrons, I\'d say they\'re intended to have some positive effect on fleet 
combat. The more useful fighters are, the more capital ships will have
"float planes".

As for this mechanism creating effectively random match-ups between
ship groupings, that was what I referred to in my mention of Commit
Order and how crucial it was. I don\'t have that mechanism worked out,
and I think it\'s the heart of this variant system. My idea is that more
maneuverable units can gain a contact advantage over less maneuverable
ones, and then guide their own units to the contacts - providing the
more maneuverable (or better organized/better led) fleet with more choices 
on what tactical contacts occur within the overall operational-level fleet 
contact.

Remember, I\'m not talking about an ID failure that lasts all day - just

Twenty minutes isn\'t a very long time at all when your battlefield is

It isn\'t Star Wars X-Wing dogfights. It isn\'t WW1-WW2 surface ships.

mine it for ideas.

  So concentrating your battlefleet (i.e., Jutland, Trafalgar, etc.) is
to be defined as wrong? The strategic rules will reflect this?

Trafalgar was wrong for the French. Find me something to trap a Traveller 
starfleet against so you can form up a line of battle and defeat it in detail.
(Wasn\'t Jutland an indecisive engagement in itself? I thought the German
fleet used their lack of a clear victory there as an excuse not to sortie
against the Royal Navy again, but losses on either side were equivalent.)

If I can see your fleet well enough (as the basic HG2 rules allow) to
know what you have, some simple number runs (TCS percentage
based combat) will give me an idea of what I\'ll have left after I stand
in line and trade shots with you. Note that the most efficient way of
dealing damage (loitering at low V and engaging en masse) is also
the most efficient way of taking damage. Since this isn\'t wet navy
surface combat, there may be other ways of doing this.

I have, and many times. Although now that I think of it, most have been of
freezing temperatures and lots of snow. (That\'s what you get for living
near the polar circle. (In Finland that is.) I remember one tie when a
time/dimensiontravelling adventurer group using jury rigged GURPS tl8 space
shuttle made an emergency landing into Switzerland during the coldest part
of the winter. At first they got the ship buried under several meters of
snow in an avalanche. Because they were in the 1000\'s there was really no
technological way to get it out. After some snow-digging/diving in
spacesuits, they decided to timejump... Into the 1980\'s. After some time of
playing UFO, they had to hide their ship under ice in a deep lake by
melting the ice with their rockets. And while the main part of the group
were trying to get some rocket fuel (an adventure in itself...) the hole in
the ice re-froze. With no other way of getting on the surface than by
walking on the bottom in spacesuits and laser-cutting the ice, the part of
the crew left to guard the ship was stuck. 

And because of the effectivity of snow in blocking IR, there have been more
than one time when high-tech guerillas have used snow and snowing as a
cover for their operations, and for hiding from pursuers.

what I have done is a variant MT Space Combat is to give the small units the own 
Target Size DM as a to hit bonus on their tasks, while using direct fire weapons. 
Missiles get no such bonus.

From this it is extrem simple to HIT a large craft with a small craft and extremly 
more difficult vice versa. This means although that they can shoot from longer 
ranges.

If you put fighters 10displ with a single Size DM of 3 into a fighter sqdr of 
example 30 fighters the dm is reduced to 2 but the fighters can now put their 
weapons together to push the ucp of the weapons up.

My players have fought some battles and it really looked like starwars small 
fighters running around the big ships ones.

Further I have changed the combat steps:

COMBAT PHASES
Detection Scan Phase
Movement Phase
The unit with the lowest of (Computer + Thrust + Crew + Size) begins.
Ramming must be declared during the end of a units movement.
Fire Control Scan Phase
Fire Phase
Declare Defensive Batterys
Fire all offensive weapons in range from the highest UCP to the lowest. Use Range 
zero against ramming crafts.
Collision with declared and unavoided rammings.
Damage Phase
Apply all Damages
Launch/Docking Phase
Damage Control Phase
Repair Tasks. Possible up to Major Damages.

I am applaying the DSR and a lot of other changes too. Example no hardpoints. 
Tractors and Repulsors are the same unit. If the Ship is big enough and has enough 
energy, you can put into a 200 displ. ball with a fusion-50 ton bay and 100 
missile launchers. Computers get really small at tl11 fighter has the same 
computer as a battleship, but the crew has a lower quality. The Crew Quility is 
added to every OFF DM and DEF DM. Agility is canceled too, because i can\'t explain 
it to me how it works. Insted I\'m using Accelerations.

Example:

to hit task with direct fire:

Difficult, OFF=Computer, Crew, Acceleration, SizeDM, to Hit DM, DEF=Computer, 
Crew, Acceleration, SizeDM, Range

to pen

Difficult, OFF=Computer, Crew, to pen DM, DEF=Computer, Crew

Last is the using of the excellant alternate MT damage tables from Jospeh R. 
Dietrich.

    'body' => '**WARNING : The note below contains a high level of gearheadedness!**


Fusion reactions can (theoretically) be initiated at low temperatures
(less than 5000K) through muon catalysis.

Introduction of negatively charged muons, which are 207 times as massive
as electrons, into a low temperature, relatively dense (on the order of
0.014g/cc, 0.2 X LH2) mixture of deuterium and tritium, leads to the
formation of muonic atoms.

DT-mu intermediates form rapidly and fusion ensues.

Muons have a lifetime of 2.2 X 10^(-6) seconds under normal conditions,
decaying into electrons and muon and electron neutrinos.
The number of fusions catalysable per muon is in the order of 120-150.

This all sounds very good, but a muon source must be available.

The obvious source for muons is the annihilation of protons with
antiprotons :-

p + anti-p -> 2 neutral pions, 1.5 positive pions and 1.5 negative pions

The neutral pions decay into gamma rays within 8 X 10^(-15) seconds.
However, the charged pions decay into muons and neutrinos within 2.6 X
10^(-8) seconds :-

pion(+) -> muon(+) + muon neutrino
pion(-) -> muon(-) + muon antineutrino

The overall energy gain is about 12% (annihilation as input energy vs.
fusions generated).

Ob Trav : So a handwave exists for The Abomination Known As Fusion Plus.
Heavy water is \'doped\' with tritium and simultaneously heated by
antiproton annihilation, with some muon catalysed fusion on the side....

This enables antimatter to \'sneak\' into the game on a limited basis at
average Imperial Tech Levels ; one of Cleon\'s many \'dirty little
secrets\'???

Well, not many details, but I saw a documentary on one of the first humans
they experimented on. He was/is a total paraplegic, basically couldn\'t move
a thing. So, they connected a computer to some suitable part of his brain
(don\'t remember if surgery was involved or if it was just electrodes), and
he learned to control a cursor moving over a computer screen so that he
could \'write\' by pausing at a letter displayed on the screen. Basically, he
did this by \'thinking\' at it (biofeedback), it took a bit of training, but
he did it. (He had a *completely* neutral face (obviously, not many facial
muscles worked), but they focused the camera on his face when he \'wrote\' his
name for the first time. I can\'t describe his smile (it barely existed) but
it was *very* obvious he was one happy camper. Suddenly he could
*communicate*. The doctor wasn\'t all that unhappy either. ;-)

Hmm. So he killed off his children out of fear their antics would draw Pak
interest. Dang. I like this idea.

How \'bout the other races? (That is, how to bring them in without messing
too much with traveller.)

The Puppeteers are easy, they\'re fleeing the galaxy (using Mover Of Worlds)
because they *know* what the Empress Wave is. They just have some things
that must be taken care of to make sure the Pak do what they\'re supposed to
do while the Puppeteers are moving slowly towards the next galaxy.

The Outsiders, well, they just haven\'t contacted anyone that hasn\'t kept
quiet about it. Or maybe they just haven\'t visited any Imperial worlds? Yet.

The Kzin. Either (boring) just let the Aslan *be* the Kzin, or have a fleet
of Kzin come barrelling into the Solomani. (Think First War-era Kzin.)

The Trinocs. Could fit in in any reasonably unexplored part of space.

The Slavers. All dead. Except for the one found in a stasis box that is
currently being explored at Imperial Research Station Theta...

The Bandersnatchi. Just have someone realize these big critters exist on
several planets.

The Pak. Live on a currently unexplored world somewhere inside Imperial
space. Either nobody knows this, or the system is *very* Red-zoned. (The
last Imperial Fleet that was sent there kind of, um, disappeared...) One of
their slowboats are about to land on an Imperial planet in a rather short
time, with a good supply of Tree-Of-Life... (They do not yet have Jump as
they were a bit *too* thorough in destroying the Fleet.))

Um...as described, this more suggests that nuclei are held _together_ by such
bonds than that bonds between separate atoms work in this way.  As such, it has
no macroscopic relevance.

Shrug.  Sufficient manipulation might allow creation of artificial neutronium,
with a density of at least 10^14 (hint: assume a neutronium hull has zero
volume).  That isn\'t nanotech per se.

Actually, whhile the PC groups was attempting to knock down the locked
door, the assisn slugged her, then switched clothes. "he" then threw a
shaw over his head. As the door crashed in he pushed the semi-concious
woman toward it. One of the fighters was fist in the room, saw the black
robed figure coming at him and procedted to hack and slash. The others
followed, completely ignoreing the cowering "cook" in a corner near the
door!

Another nasty, of our own making came while exploring a cavern under a
monestary. We located a fountain, in the center was a large jade
elephant. We spent turns and turns trying to figure out how to 1) break
the elephant statue free, the 2) carry it away (as I said, it was
large... and heavy). We stood in the water filled fountain for quite a
long time pondering, then heard a noise behind us. We turned to find a
large, fire breathing reptile. Can you say toast? Afterward we
complained to the ref that it wasn\'t fair to place a treasure we
couldn\'t recover, then hit us with the grandfather of DnD Monsters. He
calmly told us that the statue wasn\'t the treasure! The water was, it
conferred increased strenth and damage resistance (enough to kill the
draon if used wisely). The problen was that the site of the massive jade
statue brought out so much greed thatn NONE of us even thought to check
anything else in the lair. After a such a long time he felt he just had
to let the dragon return!

In reference to the fighting in Korea in the late 1800s, Robert Heinlein
makes a passing mention in _Expanded Universe_ as follows:

<<begin quote>>

My training in history was so spotty that it was not until I went to the
Naval Academy and saw captured battle flags that I learned that we
fought Korea some _eighty years_ [emphasis original] earlier than the
mess we are still trying to clean up.

<<end quote>>

Eighty from 1950 leaves circa 1870.


ObTrav:  Given the appalling lack of historical knowledge (not to
mention the decline in knowledge of other academic subjects) prevalent
among American students, what would be the average Edu stat for an
American public high school graduate?  Would an Edu stat of 5 be too
high, or too low?

        I have run "weather themes" as part of the game...  Very much the
Trek/ Star Wars vien of "Forest World", "Ice Planet", "Dust Ball", etc.  The
justifications I use is that the primary facilites of a colony will be in
the most habitable area of the planet...  so, for the "Ice World" I ran, the
facility was on the equator with a "summer" day-time high of  +5c/ 42F....
        The players *hated* that scenario...  They were part of a Ranger
unit;  they got rotated from star system to star system every 18 months.  So
they get posted to this petroleum-rich ice cube on the back side of hell....
The biggest worry they had when out on a sector patrol was thier PLSS units
kicking out on them, or getting thier thermal suits torn in a scrap...  they
actually lost a team-mate to hypothermia when the whole team was KO\'d by an
explosion...  her suit got torn and she froze to death before they regained
conciousness.
        Another time was when they got posted to a desert world;  the "artic
circle" regions were fairly lush, like the area around the Nile River in
Eygpt.  The rest of it was sand and uranium-laden rock....  They got thier
"Glide Box" shot down by smugglers and wound up having to tough it out in a
brutal desert environment for three days while rescuers tried to reach them.
No one died, but one character was critically wounded from dehydration.

        I tend to treat things like "ice storms" or the like as part of the
encounter tables for a particular terrain type...  Just the same as
interesting natural geographic features or flora/fauna....

        By and large, I don\'t resort to encounter tables much....  So, if
weather figures into a game, it is because it is part of the "script" for
the adventure.

        Nice to see you back on the list, Les....

This is one complaint I have about Traveller.  So much of its very far in
the future technology lacks imagination.  Carl Sagan once said something to
the effect of, "If an alien race capable of interstellar travel were to live
amongst humankind for so much time, their technology would appear to us to
be magic."

Remember that movie in the 80\'s where the kids make a spherical force-field
spaceship?  I thought that was "visionary" and probably possible one day, if
we don\'t kill ourselves off, first.

I\'m not terribly familiar with Korean history, but I can\'t think of an
armed intervention -- let alone "invasion" -- of Korea by the USA during
this period.  

Technically, anyway, it would have been impossible.  There was no
sovereign Korea -- it was a vassal of the Qing dynasty in China back then.
;)  Hence the significance of the Sino-Japanese war for the peninsula...

We\'re aware of the system but we can\'t use certain types of DGP material
for legal reasons.

	Perhaps the US made some incursion into Korea during the Boxer rebellion

Well, there\'s transparent and there\'s invisible.  Then you\'ve got the question
of invisible to what?  The visual spectrum is miniscule compared to the
detectable spectrum.  They\'re working on the more important "radar invisibility"
already.  Then there\'s the "warp light around" attempt at invisibility, which
works fine in a directional invisibility.  But if you look at the "cloaked"
object from the side, it will stick out like a sore thumb.  I think the only
"true invisiblity" would be converting the refractive properties of the object
to match that of the local medium.  That\'s probably tinkering with atomic
properties and would have some weird effects on perception.  Note that even a
slight difference in refraction is very noticeable, like a layer of fresh water
under a layer of salt water producing a reflective surface.

Normally, a starport has:

1. a landing area/volume
2. a parking bay/orbit
3. a beacon
4. a tower
5. warehouses
6. a plant maintenance center
7. a concourse
8. a fuel depot, with fuel shuttles or a refinery (or both)
9. a ship maintenance/construction yard

The public or external transportation system is usually
connected to the concourse and the warehouses, while
the starport transportation system is usually connected
to all areas except perhaps the concourse.

The concourse contains all retail stores, agencies,
non-starport-related offices, and services.

Warehouses may be just bare spaces, or may have
specialized environmental controls.

The article didn\'t say but I believe it\'s not getting to
the satellite that\'s the problem. It\'s replenishing by
hand, while in vacuum and a micro-gravity environment,
the frozen hydrogen supply on a satellite never built
to allow such a procedure. Then there\'s repairing the
telescope itself of any damage cause by exposure to
unshielded solar energy in space (the hydrogen was
supposed to keep the \'scope cool). Again, the telescope
wasn\'t designed to be repaired and no pre-built tools
exist.

The Hubble was specifically designed for access in
an orbital environment and had special tools made for
such endeavors. Even then, the repairs/upgrades of
the Hubble are very delicate and dangerous procedures
just because of the environment. Touching one of the
Hubble\'s shiny metal external panels could have burned
through one of astronaut\'s EVA suits.

Nope, the $71 million+ satellite is unrecoverable,
barring a miracle. Some of its science goals will be
picked up by future probes, though.

  It\'s far from clear that B:2 or HG2 drives are reactionless; HG1, Mayday,
and TNE of course are quite explicit in their use of reaction drives. So is
Triplanetary, FWIW :)  I\'m afraid that I\'m not qualified to answer the sensor
question in RL, but in Traveller the answer is assumed to be yes at Stellar TLs.

  Of course, if the drives in a particular Traveller campaign aren\'t
reactionless then they\'re signature is truly, um, astronomical? This 
makes ID\'ing enemy units much simpler in the run up to an engagement.

  Although most (AFAIK) such ships _don\'t_ have fighters, I would suggest that
most major ships should have fighters aboard simply for the added flexibility
in many missions. They can be faster than the main ship, they can go to many
different locations, they can be customized by varying models loaded, and
they are low maintenance attrition units. The absence of such is not, IMHO,
genuinely explicable; perhaps they wanted to avoid all major Trav ships
resembling something from bad SF TV?

  It sounds interesting, but it\'s not what Imperium uses (which is good, IMO,
as Imperium is too simple), however, it also presupposes various things about
ranges that I\'ve already expressed concerns about.

...

  And twenty minutes at 5G\'s is almost nothing compared to Traveller combat
ranges. Given that ship movements (unless extreme DV\'s have been accumulated)
will be very small compared to "normal" ranges the initiative system will have
to conceal all those aspects to make sense, won\'t it? If the ID issue is a
really important one, then all ships would have sensor drones a la 2300 AD to
deploy; the fact that they don\'t is either a simplification, an error, or a
statement that CT sensors don\'t require them (TNE uses drones sometimes?).

...

  An engagement can be forced in Traveller by the not-too-simple expedients of
finding an enemy that needs to refuel, or a site that the enemy will choose to
defend. The simplest method is to jump in yourself; an opponent who believes
that you can\'r jump out will be encouraged to attack.

  Trafalgar was wrong for the French & Spanish because they lost; if they\'d
been unwilling to fight they could have stayed in port for another year. As
for Jutland, the point is that a battle was fought; the strategic issues that
arguably prevented either side from making it decisive are not very relevant.
And the Brits got spanked badly on tonnage sunk*.  (* statistics, lies, etc.)

I don\'t drink coffee. :-)   That would be a strawman because obviously there
is no such thing that is carved in stone and enforced, nor does anyone want
that (i hope!).   Even the most diehard proponets of canon think it\'s
obviously only applicable to the official universe, and even then most likely
only to historical events and not extrapolations on chargen, ship design,
combat rules etc etc.

Noone, least of all I, would have any desire to "stop you."  My point was that
the value of \'canon\' is for a single official universe that many branch off\'ve
and nothing to do with anyones own universe (who have their own "canon:"  that
which is dictated/ written/ thought up by the Ref).  There can be a million
Fred, Eneri, or Norris out there, but if one just says "Norris", everyone will
probably think about Norris Aella Aledon (First Regent, Archduke of the Domain
of Deneb, Duke of Regina, Marquis Aledon, Baron Yori, etc etc), in the
official universe.  What happens in anyone\'s own universe is their own
beezwax, but should probably be prefaced w/ IMTU to avoid confusion, at least.

;-P

Whenever I refer to canon, it\'s only in reference to the "historical" events
of the official timeline/universe and possibly alternates such as G:T\'s M:1120
and nothing at all to do in relation to various game rules.  It\'s been one
evolving setting until (and possibly) T4.  Try telling your ref that there is
no \'canonicity\' and <insert name> is not the bigwig in charge of the area or
that the big warship off the starboard bow cannot hurt your ship cause you
have an "anti-canon thingamajig."  ;-)

I see absolutely nothing that says the \'plasma torch\' has to be a gigantic
plume, in an atmosphere.  I\'m not a vehement anti T-plate person, though I do
prefer HEPLaR, if just for aesthetics (it is NOT a big deal to keep track of
G-turns) and personal suspension of disbelief.   Again, T-plates (amongst
other manuever drives) were provided for those who had an attachment for the
old style designs and starports, etc.  Nothing stopping anyone from fudging
the equations or introducing grav focusing for high energy weapons, as
provided.  TNE wasn\'t about one universe, but the possibilities of many,
though there was no support given, though 2300AD would\'ve probably been first
out the gate, had GDW not bitten the big one.  FF&S, as another pointed out,
is practically a universe design kit.

LOL.  hmm...  CT, MT.  But my GT lacks all mention of them (Yes, i\'ve actually
cracked the cover on it.  Arent\' they in Star Mercs?  What was the handwave

Only a flaw if you don\'t want the Imperium broke. If you don\'t like the
Imperium, on the other hand (or rather, don\'t like it intact, but think it can
be an inspirational vision of past grandeur (and folly) ala Rome in medieval
Europe)... ;-)

Debatable.  Some of GT (especially if you\'re going to use G:V and/or the many
personal combat options) and T4 (FFS2) are alot more reminiscent of TNE than
the older ones.  Only CT and GT lack a true task system.  MT is just
recompiled CT w/ DGPs task system.  T4 is a hybrid, if anything.  Aside from
an irrational dislike of any dice unique to role playing, there\'s only the
stat/skill balance that draws credible criticism.  Most of the personal combat
is highly modular and ignorable (recoil, knockdown, hit location, etc).
Lethality is easily modified (double damage for short range, T2k Quick Kill,
etc). Things can be organized and interpreted many ways, no?  lol.  

Not looking to start a flamefest, either, nor do I think we\'re headed for one.
And of course no minds are going to be changed and we\'ll keep playing enjoying
the versions we like, despite all the posturing.  :-)

LOL.  That is funny.  That\'s exactly what I said of MT & T4 when i held an MT
boxed set, TNE Deluxe (mk 1 mod 1), and T4 and compared them, when deciding
which one I\'d get.  Didn\'t see nor acquire any CT until after then (and I
still have as much T4 as I do CT), though i went back and got the MT box
(didn\'t have an Imperial Encyclopedia seperately).

My POV much prefers Path of Tears to Solomani Rim, Regency Sourcebook to the
Spinward Marches, BL/BR to Book2/HG, etc etc on the rules side.  On the
setting side, everything is possible in the RC.  Exploration/scout stuff.
Corp missions/intrigue.  Political stuff/faction fighting.  Merchants,
Belting, Merc stuff.  Military campaigning.  Even the Regency never actually
got me running more than a few odd adventures there, though I\'ve done numerous
attempts at an actual campaign.  In fact, I\'ve been developign a near future,
3D alternate universe campaign, though that\'ll probably replace the Regency on
teh sidelines, as I still find I have alot of stuff that can be done in the
RC.  1203 is going to be very fun IMTU.

None?  Brilliant Lances and the mapless version in the main TNE book do...

Also in large numbers (task forces or "squadrons") they can put an impressive
number of missiles out, which can make even a capital ship notice.  If I used
T-plates, I could make some darned effective fighters.  As is, with HEPlaR
drives, my Ithklur and Imperial fighter designs
(http://members.aol.com/travelrtne/ffs.htm) have made a significant difference
in the BL/BR scenarios they\'ve taken part in.

I\'ve seen this several times, now, so I\'ll tell you what I know
about it.

In 1871, a small US Expedition was despatched to Korea to
"investigate" the disappearance (or death) of various US citizens
(sailors) over the last few years.  The US forces captured a couple
of coastal forts and negotiations ensued.  Nothing was resolved and
the Americans withdrew.  Simple "Gunboat Diplomacy", that didn\'t
really work, and dwarfed by the escapades of the British and French
throughout the same period.

[Off Topic, but enough people seem to be interested]

Here\'s the blow by blow of what happened:

It all started in the mid-to late 1860s. Korea was amazingly insular during
this period. European merchants were knocking down the door to trade with
Korea. In an attempt to drive off Western influence, the Koreans had
massacred over 8,000 Catholic converts and missionaries. In response, the
French invaded and were repulsed.

An American vessel, the "General Sherman" attempted to open up trade with
Korea in 1866. It\'s unclear precisely what happened. Some claim that the
crew decided it was high time to raid tombs. Others claim they tried to
strongarm a trade agreement. On the other hand, it\'s also entirely possible
given Korea\'s mindset at the time that they were just outright hostile
toward the American vessel from the get go. At any rate, the crew was
murdered and the ship was burned.

In 1871 an American naval vessel with a contingent of marines showed up.
They asked the Koreans what had happened to the "General Sherman." Whatever
answer the Koreans gave wasn\'t terribly unpleasant, so the U.S. forces asked
for permission to send a small boat to chart the Salee river. The Koreans
agreed. The boat went about its work and was fired upon by a garrison in a
Korean fort. The boat managed to make it back.

The American forces were baffled. They had asked permission and were fired
upon. He wanted to know why. The Koreans were silent. He delivered an
ultimatum: explain why the boat had been attacked or suffer the
consequences. The Koreans didn\'t respond so the Americans landed marines.
They attacked and took a number of forts. In the course of the action, the
Americans had taken some Korean prisoners. They attempted to use these
prisoners to negotiate with the Koreans and figure out why a boat charting
the river was attacked. The Koreans responded that any prisoners that were
sent back to them would be killed.

The American forces were utterly confused and frightened when faced with
such an alien mindset. They packed up, got in their ship and went back home.

That\'s pretty much the core of it. What precisely happened is a matter of
conjecture. The official histories of both countries have wildly different
accounts of exactly what happened.

  Right off, I favour something at HG/MCS level for most ship combats; I\'m
coming to the conclusion that an engine like 5FW works best for campaigns
with lots of heavy iron (and that assumes that the 5FW OB\'s are scaled way
down, as any TCS player will admit).

  That then begs the question of whether to play individual battles on hexes
or not. If they\'re really big then I suggest that the answer is no unless you
are really well-equipped comp-assist-wise. But something up to 10-20 maneuver
elements (ship, or squadron of fighters) per player could be played out on a
hex map, as BL/BR amply indicates.

  Given Trav tech it becomes apparent that a non-hex display mechanism will
still require (or at least very much profit from) a range band system a la
High Guard,
MCS, or even Book 1. This is not an argument that only a one-dimensional system
is sufficient; in fact, a system where limited mil-intel is a greater issue
would
make flanking maneuvers at range more of a threat to the reserve (or potentially
battleline units).

  The importance of layered PD against massive deployment of Det-Lasers simply
begs for resolution on a hex map, if the number of elements involved is low
enough for it to be practical. Matters are somewhat simplified by the fact that
you can rig things fairly easily such that many ships (esp. gunline units of
identical function and/or performance) can simply pack into the same hex -
even Nu-Det-Lasers can\'t throw that many beams...

  Vector-based movement also effects munitions deployment; if two battlelines
are slugging it out at long range (not rapidly converging) then slow (small,
cheapish) munitions can be deployed at higher efficiency by faster warships
operating independent of the BB\'s by running up to speed and lobbing the rounds
into the enemy fleets future position (and thus relying on the cheap bus to
merely correct for any target maneuver and to supply fine target selection).

  If you\'re not going to use hexes (and when that many ships are involved I
likely wouldn\'t use detailed resolution for the battle anyway) then the
abstract system in HG is a chunk of the way there; if I were intent on trying
to reinvent the wheel I would end up with something like MCS with its 4-5
range bands, 2-3 position groupings, and BR hex equivalencies. With the latter
it becomes simple to calculate just how awkward (and time and/or fuel-consuming)
maneuvering past an enemy unit will be using standard Traveller maneuver drives.

  In any case there\'s been a lively debate on SF-CONSIM-L as to whether hexes
are needed for space combat systems, whether Newtonian physics are too dull or
the alternatives too intellectually barren, and whether an abstract system
would need more than one position option, etc. Join the Dark Side...

Don\'t forget though that, once you\'ve sandpapered all that armor away,
there\'s an awfully large amount of interior that is open to vacuum - which
also makes for ideal target practice.
Alternatively, replace all those \'dirty\' nukes with gelled acid warheads and
eat away the armor, then use your "wimpy lasers".

Firstly, the hydrogen was not there to protect the systems as such but to
cool the infrared seeker head to prevent the satellite\'s own heat radiation
blinding it (sort of like trying to look at the stars at night whilst
standing under a street light).
Secondly, whilst NASA probably will not do very much for a while, there is
nothing that says someone could not transport the sat to Freedom/ISS at a
later date.
Thirdly, the only thing that can really stop a shuttle mission fixing WIRE
is if NASA decide *not to* - where there\'s a will, there\'s a way.  One of
the (often forgotten) Shuttle mission specs from way back when was that it
should be able to retreive satellites for fixing - and not just those
designed to be easily maintained in open space.

BTW, fixing the leak and refilling the tank would be difficult *at this
moment in time*.  Barring a miracle?  Remember, 19th Cetury scientists said
man would suffocate if he travelled above 25mph, and (very early) 20th
Century scientists said man would never fly.  Leonardo da Vinci proposed
that man would be able to send pictures around the globe but the scientists
of the time said "no way, semaphore would take too long"...
"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in
*your* philosophies."

I\'m sorry if this sounds a little like a rant (it does when I reread it to
myself out loud), but I get *a little angry* when people say that \'we\'
should stop spending money on space progams and spend it elsewhere - like
finding better ways to kill each other.

These still don\'t make any sense from a celestial mechanics point of view.
To be of any use, you\'d have to measure and calculate its orbit somehow --
you can\'t just fly to it, like a ground-based navaid. Assuming that its
orbital elements are given as part of its transponder code, you\'d still
have to measure your own orbit in 3D by the same system -- with only two
data points, the satellite and the planet. Unless you physically dock with
the thing, you\'re not in the same orbit and you will spend a fair amount of
time and effort keeping station with it. Docking with a transponder
satellite will disturb its orbit, which pretty much defeats the purpose as
well.

Better to invest in a constellation of GPS satellites in LPO that allow you
to precisely measure and adjust your own orbit. For this, you\'d probably
need at least 6, and 36 would be better. They could each consist simply of
a standard transponder and power supply -- say, Cr20,000-30,000 apiece, not
including on-orbit launch costs -- but you\'d have to replace them every two
years or so as their orbits decay. This could then also form part of your
approach and landing system, and incidently provide a valuable service
on-planet. More expensive versions could provide additional services:
communications relay, packet switching networks, etc.

No, humans are descended from Pak breeders who lost their Protectors. 
But that was quite a while ago. Say 5 million years or so.

As I understand it, after Perry "opened Japan", they tried to open
trade relations with Korea. The US fleet involved anchored near some
Korean fortress that covered the river mouth. 

The Koreans foolishly tried to pull a sneak attack on the fleet while
negotiations were going on. The Marines stormed the fortress and took
it and several others. When the Koreans *still* showed no signs of
being willing to negotiate in good faith, it was decided to leave. I
don\'t recall if they left the fortifications intact or not. Knowing the
Marines, unless they had *specific* orders to the contrary, they at
least would have burned them.

A T-6 can cope with 1 air/raft per month?
100MCr to cope with two free traders per month?
Maximum capacity 5 mega freighters per year?

Unless I am missing something, you need to multiply the
tonnage capacity by 1,000 or more.

At the very least, the repayments on the control tower
should be less than those on the merchants.

Anyway these can be brought over into Traveller in some sort of a system?

I understand the recent Computer RPG "Baldur\'s Gate" enforces the rule of
exhaustion and hunger (and maybe weather).  It\'s funny to read some of the
screen captions when this happens.  It looks like the characters become
downright unmanageable when they get tired enough.

NPC Artificial Intelligence seems to be pretty realistic (if not that, then
humorous).  An evil mage NPC grabs the good druid chick\'s rear end.
Eventually she gets pissed off, they exchange magical blows, and she kills
him.

That\'s one expensive jolly.

Not quite. Exhaustion yes, but hunger no. Weather doesn\'t have much of an
effect beyond looking impressive and adding atmosphere, which it does
nicely.

That\'s not quite what happens. ;^)

They get into an argument over one of his nasty comments. The evil wizard
and the neutral cleric each have a companion that they bring with them (the
druid has a husband while the mage has a twisted little bodyguard). They all
start bickering and then it comes down to blows.

There is no fixed winner though. Each side has the potential to win.

Sorry, my bad.  IBM PC, low end Pentium, under Win95.  I have the

How bout this.  IIRC, Niven put the Pak homeworld somewhere towards the
core.  Heres whats happened.  The Zhodani core expeditions ran into the
Pak world.  The Protectors decided they didnt like the Zho nobles for
some reason.  Perhaps they saw them as breeders who failed to breed true
(ie. mutations, not something the Pak would like)  Realizing where they
came from, the Pak start out this way, in (relativistic) slow boats.  The
empress wave is really a psionic wavefront intended to scramble psions,
and is maintained by a set of special slowboats carrying psionic jammers,
while the Pak troop ships come along behind.  Brings to mind a new
campaign

Traveller:  The Pak Wars

Never mind the rebellion, Virus, etc.  the Imperium best get ready.  The
Pak will see these smart breeders as mutations, not of the true blood
line, and will most certainly try to exterminate them.  You want to see
the 3I fall?  Now heres a good way to do it.  The other races?  Hmmm, not
sure on that one.

Lot\'s of good reasons depending on your starting assumtions.  The enemy can
spread out and bypass you.  Area effect weapons can hit all of your ships.
Like a honking big Antimatter bomb. (T-bomb in SFB.)   LOS blocking.  One
moon blocks all the fire from all ships.  Colateral damage from our own
ships exploding.  Interferience with each others sensors.  Not being able to
tell what seeking weapon is seeking who.  Difficulty covering week spots in
each others defenses.

Most of the "keep together" ideas seem to assume some defined points
in a star system that ships will automatically act to attack or defend -
refuelling points, mainworlds, etc. Thus you can mass where the enemy
must come, and he must mass to fight you there. The assumptions
involved with this are the most critical to creating a game universe where
ships have a reason to spread out.

That would be one ungodly size area of effect weapon. "One hex" is much 
bigger than most planets (for the weapon and movement scales we\'re talking
about here).

If the game universe includes such weapons, you\'ll also need a reason
they\'re not used by the losing side against the biggest solo enemy ship
they get a shot at. Better to get something for your limited-use, frightfully
expensive doomsday weapon than to die with it unfired.

Unless the *threat* of such weapons, though they are actually very rare,
is sufficient to cause fleet dispersal as SOP.

Again, big hexes. Though the idea of sensor interference may be worth
exploring. Current ideas on sensors seem to say a bunch of ships close
together can help each other, make their sensors work better instead
of worse. If sensors have a different effect on each other then we need to
explain why, and our game tech will be somewhat different than the
directions FF&S and BL/BR have taken.

If the ships are covering each other, then being closer together should
be better. As for seeking weapons, if you are being shot at by so many
of them that you have to prioritize PD fire against ones coming at you,
then your situation could only get worse by being far away from other
friendly PD assets.

Most interesting game mechanic I\'ve ever seen for limiting the number
of ships in a hex was from Metagaming\'s _Godsfire_. The FTL drives
used in that wargame\'s universe caused a temporary weakening of
the dimensional fabric. Too many drives at once in too small an area,
and you ripped a hole in the universe. The last time it happened, the
"Godsfire" disaster pretty much caused a short civilization collapse
(much like the Darrian Maghiz) in the game area.

Nice thing was, the game designers included rules for setting off
another Godsfire during the game. Every time you massed a fleet
above a certain level, or attacked an enemy fleet such that your
fleet + his fleet were above a certain level, you risked losing both fleets
and wrecking the economy of all the systems around where you were
fighting. I\'ve yet to play the game, but the idea seems to have 
interesting possibile effects on a game universe.

\'Fraid I don\'t remember. 

The compressed air vehicle and and the fact that Microsoft now has a deal
with
China for some cheap Internet boxes makes me wonder why such technology
isn\'t being offered in the U.S. Makes me go "Hmmm". Just a thought for you
conspiracy-theory fans. Regardless, they\'re an excellent way for other
countries
to leapfrog the U.S. because of the potential economic efficiencies.

BTW, the ion drive onboard the Deep Space One probe is going to be
fired up again on March 15th.

The latest news with the probe is the success of the onboard "AutoNav"
software which allows the probe to figure out its location in the universe
by looking at benchmark stars and asteroids. The big deal about this
(and it\'s BIG) is the fact that the software did it *without* any processing
help from Earth-based engineers..and did it twice. First time in the 
history of the human species, folks, and the sucker figured out its
position on its own within 1000 miles (2000 km) while over 180 million
kilometers or 110 million miles from the Sun and almost 46 million km or
about 28.5 million miles from Earth.

moment.  If the protectors bumped into the 3I, I think there would be
wonderful potential for mayhem.  First of all, they would exterminate all
non-human races as a matter of course, Phssthpok says as much near the
beginning of the book.  Protectors eliminate other sophonts "just to be
sure".  As for the humans of the 3I and the Zhos, I\'m not sure.  They
would "smell funny" to the Pak, so would probably not qualify for
protection.  By default they would qualify for extermination. 

	Now the interesting debate starts:  Who would win?  The 3I and the
Zhos start off with a huge advantage in numbers, industrial capacity, and
technology, but the Pak are ultimately resourceful.  As someone else said,
they could make a fusion plant out of a vaccuum cleaner and a pile of
dirty socks.  They would rapidly co-opt technology and expand their
numbers with cloning and the like.  They wouldn\'t hesitate to use
bio-warfare (they use it on each other, after all) or planetary
sterilization by nuke.  It would basically be a matter of the 3I scoring a
quick and decisive victory or the Pak destroying everything at an
inexorable and rapidly accelerating pace. 

	I have a feeling the Solomani might come out ahead in all this. 
After all, in some sense they _are_ the Pak and the extermination of all
other sophonts would leave the way clear for them to "fulfill their
galactic destiny" and all that rot. But wait, you say!  Wouldn\'t they get
exterminated too?  Maybe not.  The Solomani would have some time to get
ready, and are masters of genetic engineering.  What I would do if I were
them is I would make sure I "smelled right".  I would therefore qualify
for protection as a breeder and then things get funky... (excuse the
pun :-).

of random encounters: An air-raft breakdown forced us to camp and then a
prairie fire came along and I convinced my captors they needed my help

It is a rant and an undeserved one, Jeffrey.

I wasn\'t aware I said *anything* about stopping space program
expenditures. In fact, looking at my original post, I didn\'t.
And being an active member of the Planetary Society and the
National Space Society for the last 10 years, I\'m proud to
have my name on the Carl Sagan Memorial Station on Mars, not
because it\'s "cool" but because of the knowledge gained by
the mission. I firmly believe that the sooner humanity gets
its collective butt off this planet, the better but it had
darn well get *something* for any money spent on any space
program in the meantime.

The WIRE satellite\'s mission is considered a total loss by NASA
representatives. According to the story on MSNBC, "We are very
disappointed at the loss of WIRE\'s science program," Ed
Weiler, NASA\'s associate administrator for space science, said
in a statement Monday.

The satellite *can* be used for engineering tests, which were
not part of the satellite\'s primary mission and definitely *not*
worth the amount of money put into the mission, *if_that_had_
been_the_satellite\'s_sole_reason_for_being_launched*. 

The fact the satellite can and will be used for something useful
despite the loss says something about the dedication of NASA
engineers to make their missions provide a return of some kind
and I take my hat off to them. I have personally seen the
results of their efforts with the Independent Space Station
and am stunned at the capabilities of humanity when such
capabilities are focused properly.

War is an incredibly stupid focus, caused by the selfishness
and greed of the shortsighted. The problem is until those
shortsighted morons grow up, the rest of us are forced to
waste resources keeping them at arm\'s length so that we can
live long enough to get into space.

The inadvertent loss of $79 million *scientific* mission truly
is a pity; the scientific knowledge of the human species could
really have been expanded in some areas and *that* goal is
*always* worth attempting.

I can think of one system in which weather plays a big factor: Vincennes in
Deneb sector.

Vincennes is a trinary system in which a companion star orbits the system\'s
primary star (the tertiary star is in far orbit). Anyway, Vincennes is over
90 percent water and when the companion star is at the point in its orbit
at which it is closest to Vincennes (IOW, in the summer), the world suffers
huge storms and other adverse effects . The storms and heat release sulphur
compounds from the planet\'s crust that bubble up from the oceans and make
the atmosphere unbreathable. 

At other times of year, the weather varies, but only in the spring, I
believe, can anyone actually go outside and breath the atmosphere without
any kind of breathing apparatus. Good thing the world is TL 16, eh?

I ran some adventures there and it was pretty fun to expose the characters
to the seasonal shifts of the planet. The planet has a pretty fast orbit,
so each season is only 50 days long. They had some fairly long-term
assignments and in some cases they were up against the wall to complete
certain tasks because they knew the bad weather was going to make travel
difficult.

Part of the \'limit\' on the T-bombs is that they did not work well against
planets and that they were just powerfull enough to chew up a cruisers
shields or cripple a friget but would wipe out a drone cloud (Missles)
within a hex or the adjacent hexes.  They were \'dropped ordence\' and not
mobile.  A space mine.  They came in two sizes.  A ten point small mine to
kill drones and fighters and carriable by most ships and a 35 point large
mine that could crush a cruiser\'s thickess shield but was carriable only by
specially equiped ships. (In SFB shields are directional and some ships have
week sheilds in curtain directions.) 

Ship battles in SFB tend to be fire and manuver.  Ships do not normally have
enough weapons to kill a fighter squadron in a single turn.  Fighter weapons
other than missles are very short ranged.  At short range (0 or 1 hex) a
single direct fire fighter can down a cruiser shield and three such fighters
will blow up the crusier.  At range 4+ most fighters are toast.  At ranges
over 10 a fighter can only really be effective with missles.  Missle
fighters rarely carry much direct fire weapons and direct fire fighters
rarely carry many missles.  Ships at range 10 kill fighters fairly easily.

Not if their weekness was directional.  Say thin rear armor/shields.  Then
an forward attacker and a wing man or two would be a better formation.  Also
massing only aids point defense weapons.  If other anti missle systems are
available like decoys, ECM, exc. massing of ships might interfer with those
operations.  In SFB use of weapons negates decoys.  Again it depends on your
assumptions.  I have always thought it odd the rather short list of weapons
and defences avaiable in traveller.  What about active jamming and decoys?
What about loading a sandcaster with steel ball bearing to punch holes in
incoming missles?  VHROF gauss weapons for missle defence.  Gravity bombs,
atificial gravity devices that produce a short pulse of very strong gravity
to crush incoming missiles.  Multi-warhead anti missile missiles.  Unmaned
laser armed anti missle drone fighters the size of large missles.  Very
small very fast short range intercepter missles.  Gravity guns firing
steerable shells for missle defence.

The game StarFire has the interesting mechanic that only one ship at a time
can transit through the \'worm holes\' that are the only form of FTL.  The
reactionless drives the ships use also produce a shielding effect arround
the ships except to the rear where the ship is both blind and vunerable.

Um...surface hits don\'t sandpaper away armor, they destroy things which are on
the surface.  Killing a target by ablating its armor is a ridiculously
inefficient way of killing something.

Laugh.  Unless it\'s some sort of magic acid (replicating nanotech disassemblers
or something) the destructive ability of a volume of acid is so much lower than
the destructive ability of a contact missile for delivering the acid that they
would probably never detect the acid, unless after the battle they were doing
forensic work to try and find out who shot the missile.

In essence, this is fitting a series of transponders to the fighter to
have the opposite effect to an EM Masking package - it\'s making the ship
have a bigger signature.

If you\'re going to do this, consider making the fighter either remote
controlled or autonomous.

It\'s in a polar orbit. The shuttle can\'t reach a polar orbit from Florida,
and the polar-shuttle launch facility at Vandenberg was never completed.
(And, anyway, even from Vandenberg shuttles have very little payload into
polar orbit.)

The good part is that it\'s only a $70 million mission including launch
costs. Since a shuttle flight costs $100-500 million depending on how your
accountant thinks, it\'s cheaper to launch a whole new one. That\'s the good
part of faster-cheaper missions like this; you can contemplate reflying them.

There were a few native flora that were very tough skinned and tended to to

these roots to filter out a lot of the chemicals and to get some tolerable water.

Except for the laws of physics; shuttles launched from Florida can\'t reach
WIRE\'s orbit without overflying the whole east coast (generally frowned upon.)
And the laws of economics; shuttle flights cost $100-500 million, WIRE
including launch costs was $71 million. (A replacement WIRE without launch
costs would probably be $10 million.)

As a counterargument, I suggest and include as reference the
body of Weber\'s "Honor Harrington" novels, wherein strategic
maneuvering is aptly demonstrated to often have more significant
effects than the pure balance of forces would indicate.
The combination of limited intelligence / knowledge / sensor
capabilities and strategic maneuvering are portrayed very
well, with both competent and incompetent fleet commanders,
and the effects demonstrated repeatedly (plus, he may be

I have Pen-Latol\'s World and Lomodo IV as well as
Group One\'s Theta Borealis sector. Group One\'s
material is, IMO, of extremely low quality (on the
order of Judges Guild material)in comparison to
Traveller publications by FASA and BITS.

The sectors are usable but very light in detail. Unless
desperate for ideas or a hard-core collector, I wouldn\'t
pay more than $5.00 US each. YMMV.

  Operationally, not strategically. The difference if the engaged British

My gut feel is that it would be a problem, if only in the same way that
afterburners are (cracked runway anyone?). YMMV. It is possibly a problem
for space stations, but you could use a shuttle OMS type system instead.

LOL! Thats exactly my feeling, but vice versa! I like HEPLaR for lower tech
units, and as afterburners for T-Plate ships.

That is what I liked about TNE - the technical architecture. I would love
to have seen it done properly for T5.

Yes, there\'re in Star Mercs, and are pretty much close range weapons. (8000

I would have prefered to have seen the Hard Times background continue - the
light of the Imperium going out, with a collection of Pocket Empires and
the Wilds between. Virus is brilliantly audacious, but I would have
prefered the slow slide to Collapse, and a few systems/polities holding
candles against the darkness. The Regency handwave does bug me a little -
the RC is in some ways more interesting, in others tedious. The Regency is
interesting in the sense it continues the story.

I have a problem with the GDW house system; it seemed over complex (much as

Hmm. Possibly the two best non-system specific supplements Imp Encyclopedia
and Survival Margin.

I bought TNE pre-mod 1.... it may have flavoured my views (but I do have
most supplements except Hivers and Personalities).

My favourite Trav setting is Hard Times, followed by Spinward Marches 1105
to 1120 on a par with M0.

Sadly, this is a big turn off for me. YMMV but I like the big slow fleet

That should have been interpreted more as "I am apologising \'cos it sounds

anyone on this list.  It should really have had an \'IMO\' in there somewhere,
as it was aimed at the narrow-minded people who make a lot of noise without

Well said.  MT is also vague until u get to the SoM/DGP.  So whenever I hear
the claim that reactionless drive T-plates are CT, I can\'t help but chuckle.
The power plants can\'t be that fuel inefficient!  ;-)

Yes.  Drones are very important, but ignored alot of the time.  Can use active
sensors and area jammes if need be from there, getting good range and info w/o
giving away yourself.  Also can keep an enemy from actually spotting your
ships/task forces.  Have enough drones and dummy task forces running around
and whenever they get a lock on something, detonate a missile and cause a
white out that probably loses any locks they have.  Merge and intertwine the
dummies and drones and if you\'re skilled enough, you\'ll get to sneak in some
real combatants damned close into very deadly range while the enemy chases and
attempts to engage red herrings.

One question I do have for the resident sensors expert (Bruce M) and anyone
else knowledgable in such matters (Shadow, I would presume) is on the dummy
task forces.  Are these "realistic" assuming the use of decoys, EMS Jammers,
etc or just a game construct?  I\'m doing a more thorough and consistent merger
of BL & BR for my upcoming campaigns and need to know.  :-)

It\'s not submarine combat, though.  For one, DSR basically proves it\'s nearly
impossible to actually hide the location of a ship w/ huge power outputs (all
the radiator stuff aside).  "Bogey" detection is practically guaranteed for
quite a ways out unless extreme measures are taken (powering down, etc).  It\'s
the actual \'hard\' sensors and weapons locks that are the trick (and I stick w/
BL/BR for them).  

It\'s much better than sub combat IMO.  :-)

I don\'t think there\'s anything in the 3I, aside from references to regulations
requiring annual maintenance and certification, etc.  The Solomani
Confederation requires various licences to certain worlds, which deliberately
encourages traffic to and from worlds with significant party support.  The 3I
is supposed to be all bout free trade, or at least that\'s been my take on it.
Memberworlds have to recognize Imperial territory: the starport and the space
"between the stars."  Some worlds probably don\'t extend influence beyond
what\'s covered by their COACC.  Others control portions of their own system
with their own forces.  As long as trade isn\'t hampered and Imperial hegemony
challenged, they can pretty much do what they want, which could include
extradition of PCs.  :-)

As far as crossing the Imperiums borders?  Hmm...  I don\'t know of anything
specifically referencing this (or I don\'t recall), but this brings to mind the
Interface & Terminus worlds of the Regency.  I imagine a scaled down version
of these (along w/ something similar to the Regency Frontier) would be in
place near the larger polities (Solomani Confederation, especially).   

I don\'t think the Imperium is in the habit of seizing vessels as long as they
don\'t break rules on slavery, nuclear weapons, etc, which would probably going
to get them destroyed along w/ their owners, assuming they don\'t surrender.

Well, actually, Pak protectors don\'t have penises.  Not even the ones that
used to be male.

I don\'t think we breeders would want to tangle with them anyway.

  Operationally, not strategically. The difference if the engaged British

IMO, I\'ve been talking about operational-level combat (or at least

This is what come.to does; there\'s actually a slight flaw in the
concept - you can\'t specify a sub-URL (e.g.,
http://come.to/FreelanceTraveller/features/stories/Default.htm).
However, I\'ve been thinking about this kind of thing, and I\'m
pretty sure that you could get the additional capability by using
a CGI.  SwordWorlder, I\'d be willing to discuss this in more
detail with you and Ron privately if Downport is interested in
this idea.

Although having ships that can accelerate at hundreds (or missiles at

I think the short answer is no in general; I assume in BR that they\'re a way
of having limited intelligence (=uncertainty about where the enemy is)
without having hidden movement - a good game compromise, but not anything
specific or "real" any more than a stack of hidden blank counters in 
"Squad Leader" is really a bunch of cardboard soldier cutouts propped up
with sticks.

One could imagine making IR/visible blip enhancers, though - it\'s an

	What does the size of the ship have to do with whether you can give
it landing direction or not? It should be how MANY ships, regardless
of size. To the LAX tower, they don\'t care much if it\'s a 747, or a
Cessna  ... 

(Yeah, I know the Cessna\'s gotta stay a lot further behind big birds
to avoid wingtip vortices rolling it over, and you gotta keep the big
guys further away from the Cessna so they don\'t catch up and plow
through it ... you get my meaning.)

    'body' => 'Good God yes! You mean you never have before? Try this - its one of my
previous (CT) games.

Outline - Players are from Efate (feel free to change it). Conditions there
are pretty good - thin, but tainted atmosphere (high methane concentration
(in my game). that makes for a world with no heavy trade winds, high
greenhouse gas levels and so a steady temperature. It does have the problem
of the occasional hurricane, but apart from that no-one takes much notice of
the weather - they can all get indoors fairly easily anyway, given the tech
and population. Put it another way, its deeply, irretrievably, civilised -
and so are the players.

You are asked to go find a bloke on Whanga, pick him up and bring him home
to Efate. Simple, especially since the world is stunningly similar to
Efate - check the stats.

Options:
    1.    No problem at all. Your pickup is waiting for you.
    2.    Slight problem - he\'s on the run and your patron is a bounty
hunter. He will NOT be happy to see you!
    3.    He has upset the locals (what there are of them) and is in hiding.
He has a tracer you can track - but the locals might track you.
    4.    Spoilt rich brat - waiting for you alright, but he expects a
luxury trip back home.
    5.    Major problem - he\'s a mercenary under siege by the locals.
Extract him - and his team.
    6.    Disaster - he has a seriously contagious disease and Efate needs
him for their bioweapons research. Dead or alive.

Simple seeds, I know - I\'ll skip the NPCs I set up - I\'m sure you can find
your own easily enough. The crunch is the difference in the planets (note
that Whanga is off the main lanes - the planetary stats are probably all the
players will ask for anyway, but that\'s about all you should give them even
if they ask for more). If the players have their own ship, let them go with
it - otherwise, they can get a charter ship out, and it will wait for no
more than the 2 weeks standard turnaround for cargo and so on. Everything
else, they need to buy before they go.

Now, the difference - Whanga has a standard tainted atmosphere (also
methane). This makes a major difference - with 60% hydrographics, what we
have here is a greenhouse-hot, humid hell-hole of a planet. Constant driving
winds, regular and torrential rainstorms, hurricanes all the time (try
reading \'Mother of Storms\' first), staggering electrical thunderstorms, and
even regular tornadoes. Any bets that the players don\'t even take a tent?
Bit stupid on a planet with barely a hundred people on it (why do you think
its so underpopulated?). Chances are the storms will kill them, especially
if they don\'t have an ATV and a survival shelter at the very least. Mine
died quickly, and never even found the pick-up.

Eris is a self-confessed heretic.  One would conclude that he should
receive _all_ of the punishments stipulated, but they wouldn\'t do any
good.  Besides, where would the Party be without an Emmanuel Goldstein?

Some of Rob\'s material is still at my own site-

http://www.cybergoths.u-net.com/

Real life has intervened on my rebuild of the site, so the page is somewhat
out of date. The links to IGS, QSDS, Infini-V on that page should be
disregarded as (a) the link will 404 as the files aren\'t there, and (b) the
versions of the software at http://www.bits.org.uk/ are better (more
recent).

The old Metator (which will only work up until end-97) is on the Cybergoths
page, as is MegaCharacter (Rob\'s MT Character Generator for Hypercard).
These pages will be rationalised when I get a free weekend; this weekend is
right out because I\'m at Towercon (along with Andy Lilly) for BITS.

        Well, one anti-missile system currently in use by some ships is a
big foil bag that you throw over the side and steer away from...  it
inflates rapidly and begins "sqeualing" all over the EM band.  To a missile,
it looks like another "ship" has just appeared.  Most missiles work on the
"Burger King Theory" (first come, first served), so you deploy the decoy up
threat and the missile picks it off instead.
        Add 7 TLs and the GDP of a planet, and I am fairly sure you could
create something along the lines of the SFB "Wild Weasel"...  a
shuttle-sized or smaller craft that is designed to make every EMCON mistake
in the book, and thereby appear to be a much larger vessel.

information in a way the user can understand, in a planetary latitude and
longitude scale or by map grid.
The same kind of device in an orbiting spacecraft should be able to tell a
shuttle, air boat, or explorer planetside where they are.  By launching a
satellite or two while in orbit a ship could quickly set up a planet wide
communication network. This will allow a scout team to remain in touch with
their ship, even when on the far side of the planet, even on an airless
world, which has no ionosphere.

  ISTR your referring to ops "across significant portions of a system",

_Earth and Other Planets: Geology and Space Research_
  Peter Cattermole
  ISBN 0-19-521138-3

Both volumes are clear in the fundamentals and include interesting details.
They should provide non-specialists with lots of inspiration and assistance
in colouring the worlds of their gaming universes. Since they have lots of
pictures, they might be in the children\'s section of your local library.

Before the specialists jump on me, i know there are consequent errors of
simplifictation (such as the use of \'mammals\' where it should read
\'animals\') and a slightly disturbing politically correct slant with all
theories granted equal weight. (Of course, pseudo-science is not included.)

Unfortunately, they have not yet done a volume on weather. I\'m combing my
personal library for a similarly accessible volume on that subject.


Would anyone be interested in detailed worlds not specifically for Traveller?

I\'ve started working on some Traveller ship deckplans in VRML.

It\'s a rough start but I have half of a type S Scout done out
as a frame.  More is coming:  fittings, control panels, better
lighting, hatches, etc..

Any positive feedback or comments would be appreciated.

Has anyone heard a status on the "lost"
Keith Brothers\' Traveller supplements
which was supposed to have been published
awhile back?

It\'s now March and I haven\'t received
a thing for my $100. Regardless of the
desirability for quality, I am now
becoming rather irritated.

Has anyone received these items

|Will you host links to other Traveller sites?
==


This is a labor of love in which we hope many Traveller gamers will
participate.  We don\'t want to have "just another links page", we want to
have the linked site give us a whole page of info about what their site has
to offer.  If you have just a few pages on a site with lots of other stuff,
maybe publishing that stuff (if it has wide appeal) on Downport.com would
give it better exposure.  We want to serve the desires of the gamers.  Much
like a spaceport serves as a gateway to the stars and central receiving for
the world it is built on, Downport.com wants to help organize web traffic
for Traveller.  We can dock and warehouse content, route travelers, post
schedules and offer street frontage for the starport offices, Scout Depot,
Waystation, merchant lines and taverns.

The ideas sound ambitious, and perhaps they are.  But we don\'t mind being
accused of a having ambition.  This is not a commercial site, however.  It\'s
a fan site.  It costs money to set it up and maintain it, but any hobby does
that.  Big space users will be asked to help out with that expense,
naturally.  Most will not.  We\'d like to attract a sponsor at some point,
but that won\'t be soon.  To be honest, we don\'t know how big or popular the
site is going to get.  We\'re flexible.  It is already eating up a lot of
time, but it\'s enjoyable time.  For now we want to hear the voice of the
gamers and stay as flexible as possible.  We want to build content and
traffic.  We want to be useful and interesting.  We believe that there is a
big enough fan base to support a project like this.  Even though there is no
company out there to back a fan site right now, we still believe that
Traveller deserves one.

Use sub-craft who go active. G:T has things ass-backwards anyway - passive
sensors have much better range than active (a classic example is the Mk 1
Eyeball can see Venus, while you need a powerful radar to pick it up).

Mines are basically impossible at Traveller ranges - space is too big.

GT does sort of cover drones, with gunnery programs and so on. I guess you
could build a fairly dumb uncrewed starship.

broadcasting a signal the Vilani can \'identify\'.

Now, whether this means that neighbouring states regularly send updated
lists of new Transponder codes to each other (pop down your nearest large
bookshop - you may well find a book in the aviation section that lists
owners for Civilian-registered aircraft), or if they send each new id when
the Transponder is first fitted to a new ship is best left to \'you\' to
decide.
IMTU, I use the \'batch update\' method.

Of course, this does not apply to Military vessels - although it would be
easy for, say, the 3I to tell Zhodant that ship registration XYZ is a
1000-ton trader when it is actually a 1000-ton Intelligence gatherer...

Oddly enough, KISS played on the field just before the last Super Bowl.

Unless there are factors you didn\'t mention, the above is mostly a case
of the Pakistani consul in Mexico (and later in the US) *not* doing his
job. So it\'s mostly a case of the perils of being from a small,
unimportant country.

If they\'d been from a more important country, or had a better
consul/ambassador, they\'d have been helped with duplicate documents
*and* tickets home.

The fun thing is being outside your country and not being able to
convince your ambassador that you are a citizen... Imperial citizens
going to backwater places in the Solomani Confederation had best beware
if they don\'t have a ship, and get their ID stolen.

I think you mistake the purpose. The key is the phrase "parking orbit".
Think of them as being like the deep water mooring bouys at some
shallow water ports. The ship is assigned a parking spot, which is
marked by the transponder. It matches orbit with it and is then parked.

And btw, contrary to what you state above, you can be in the same orbit
as something *without* being physically docked to it. Easiest is to
assume a position slightly ahead or behind it (in terms of its orbit).
once you match velocities you will *stay* at that seperation.

If you try for "along side" you\'ll be in an orbit with a different
inclination, which will cross the transponder\'s orbit twice each orbit.
At which points you\'ll collide with it. Oops. 

But "leading" and "trailing" by any amount are perfectly possible. For
this sort of thing, I assume it\'d be by a 100 meters or so.

GPS satelites are in orbits high enough that they don\'t appreciably
decay over their expected service life. And to work, they need atomic
clocks onboard.

Hell, just dig up figures on the mpg and performance of the old Stanley
Steamer from back in the late 30s. And check out some sources that
explain the truth behind the scare stories. 

Oddly, one of the factors that may have helped kill the Steamer was the
fact that after a bad accident in the early days, the Stanley brothers
*refused* to participate in auto racing, much less build any sort of
racer. And I believe someone managed to get steam cars banned from the
racing circuit much like the way they used the failure of some
non-engine related component to ban turbines from the Indy 500 in the
late 60s. 

External combustion *is* practical. And doesn\'t have near the pollution
problems. But other than overly exotic cars in "alternative technology"
races, nobody is really following up on it. 

One of the early races for alternative tech cars had an actual Stanley
Steamer entered in it. While the other cars were driving all night and
the like, the folks in the Steamer were able to check into a motel, get
a good night\'s sleep, and *still* be in the lead... :-)

Heck, when you get right down to it, it *is* a conspiracy of sorts. The
auto companies are fighting tooth and nail to avoid having a situation
where their experience is worthless and they have to do massive
re-tooling. Good grief! In that sort of situation some unknown company
might take over the market!

The K\'kree are only a threat to the extent that the clan is
meat-eating. That far back, our ancestors were pretty much herbiverous.
And Pak Protectors eat *only* Tree-of-Life root. So they won\'t trip the
"meat-eater" reactions. 

It\'ll be interesting watching the Hivers come up with a manipulation.

Sooner or later a crew the right age will be able to capture a Pak ship
intact. Capturing the pilot alive is a bonus, but not needed. 

Now you\'ve got Solomani/Vilani/Zhodani/Whatever Protectors. And the
whole equation changes. Once humaniti has tree-of-life, the Pak are
doomed unless the human Protectors have a reason to keep them alive.

For a special nightmare have the capture involve a ship crewed by
members of Famile Spofulam. Given their attitudes, I can easily see
them deciding to let whatever is going on with the affected crew
members run its course.

Halflife has a much better Traveller look and feel.  I just got it
and while Quake is the mother of al 3D shooters, Halflife blows me away.

No offense to the Fenris Wolf people, I\'ve never seen their
products.  But I dearly wish that Marc had licensed Traveller to one
of the major players making these great looking and great playing
computer games.

Or like we had a case here in Norway, were the country in question confirmed
that the persons were citizens of said country, but the Norwegian police

No mistake at all -- that is precisely the model to which I object:

(1) Again, this is not 2D surface navigation: you cannot simply "fly to" a
satellite and park behind it. If you have to calculate your orbit anyway,
what it the value of the satellite?

(2) The ship herself already has a transponder, and thus acts as her own
hazard marker.

(3) Orbits are not static: you can\'t simply put them on a "chart" and
expect them to remain fixed. In fact, it is mathematically impossible to
arrive at a deterministic solution to an orbital mechanics problem
involving three or more bodies (planet, ship, and star). Rather than have
to adjust the orbits of two objects (satellite and ship), why not simply
worry about the ship?

(4) How many of these things should one expect to see in orbit? Hundreds?
At what point do they become a hazard to navigation all out of proportion
to their usefulness? Plan a large enough margin of error (10 km? 100 km?)
between on-orbit parking assignments and there is no need for the
additional clutter.

You do not "stay" at that separation over any appreciable length of time,
unless you expend time and effort on station-keeping (as I said, in so many
words). Orbits are never perfect in the real world -- perturbations from
irregularities in the planet\'s gravitational field and from other celestial
objects act differently on the satellite and the ship, accumulate, and
cause the separation (and the orbit, for that matter) to change. This is
especially true of very low or resonant orbits (planetary synchronous, etc.).

The encounters would only be uncontrolled and semi-random if the

"random" in favor of the opposition. <G>

Which fleet is more coherent - the one that develops the enemy position
by picket ship obervation and contact and maneuvers battle assets to
local firepower superiority, or the one that piles into the enemy fleet
like an avalanche?

I\'m looking for limited intelligence on both sides, with the ability to
improve that intelligence by sending light units into harm\'s way. If you
don\'t have light units (or have used them up), your battleships get to
play scout. Maybe they get a shot at a nice juicy cruiser for you, maybe 
they find a dreadnaught. I\'m thinking that a variation on Imperium\'s one-for-
one matching would emulate the results of this, even if the "real" chain of
events were not precisely the same. Abstraction to the result rather than
precise simulation to the result.

Right now I have to look at Bruce\'s MCS. He mentioned multiple range
bands and squadron groupings, I\'d like to see what his ideas are. I think
I want something simpler, though.

HalfLife is QuakeII with other textures, levels, char anims and most of all
AI. They licensed the QuakeII engine from ID for doing Half Life. I don\'t
think the Half Life guys are allowed to license their engine as it derives
from the QuakeII one in the first place. (the same goes with the awful SIN
game as well).

Quark (Quake Army Knife) is a easy to use editor for Q2 levels.
And, I recommend it for anyone wanting to jump in with a minimum
of hassle.

Nope, what killed turbines was the  air intake and (iirc) fuel tank size
restrictions slapped on them after Parnelli Jones\' heartbreaking loss in \'69.
(for those of you who are not racing fans, Jones had a turbine that ran like a
charm, and he was waaaay in the lead, when, on one of the last laps he ran out
of fuel. 1st place to DNF in a second.) This downpowered turbines so much it
made them uncompetitive with IC engines.

The turbine was just too powerful compared to the (then) IC engine technology
used by the major sponsors of the races. There\'s also the problem that
turbines are very difficult to translate into consumer vehicles, whereas the
developments done in racing can be used in advertising the car manufacturers
current lines. 

In fact, I think Honda still actually uses their F1 program as a testbed for
technologies that eventually make it into their \'street\' cars. Of course so
does Ferrari, but that\'s a much shorter route from track to street (at a much
higher speed ;-)

Of course, there was also a move to ban rear engines after Jim Clark won in
\'65 or so, but that didn\'t get very far. That\'s a race to catch footage
of...all these huge old front-engined Offy\'s rumbling around the track getting
whipped by that sleek little Lotus.

I used to have detailed models of both of those cars...wish I knew where they
all went.

Another technology I wish I knew what happened to was the Wankel...I know
Mazda had huge problems with their first generation, but they cleared the bugs
out, because IIRC the RX-7 still uses it. (I saw a hot-rod project a while
back...dropping a RX-7 engine into a Miata. Sort of like that old Sunbeam
Tiger with the 289 Ford V8...a serious pocket rocket)

Of course, there have been astonishing advances in the efficiency and design
of IC engines in the last 30 years, too, from aluminum blocks to superchargers
that _don\'t_ burn an engine out after a few tens of hours of running. We get
more horses out of four cyclinders now than we used to out of most V-8\'s.

The rate of cooling after star-set depends on atmospheric 
density and hydrographic percentage. Add the temperature 
modifier for each to the temperature rolled above. (e.g. 
for Regina (atm = 8, hyd = 8) I rolled 8 on 2D: average 
daytime temperature at the equator is 30 C, at night this 
drops to 28 C (-1 for atm, -1 for hyd), at the poles the 
average daytime temperature is 0 C (-15 for atm, -15 for 
hyd) dropping to -2 C at night (you get the idea). Thus, 
though Regina does get cool near the poles it does not 
have ice caps. Rather constant temperature, moist, a
pleasant world if you don\'t mind the rain.

Comments are welcome.

I have thought about seasonal changes, but this can be
complex and requires keeping track of seasonal changes
at different latitudes on various worlds with different 
\'year\' lengths. If anyone has KISS type season rules,
let me know.

Ooohh, NOW I remember that case...I don\'t think the ship was Pakistani, but
someplace in the baltics, like Albania. Their government didn\'t _have_ a
consul/ambassador, couldn\'t afford to buy tickets for the crew. 

Besides, the crew _didn\'t_ want to leave, because then they wouldn\'t get paid
for the something like six months (and growing) back pay they were owed.  It
was a freighter full of sugar, btw, and the crew ended up trading off sugar
for other supplies with the Mexicans in the port they were in, as well as
fishing. The bulk of the cargo was also cauight up in some complicated,
stalled deal, as well.

G:T uses sensors in 2 ways (at least IMTU).  First there is detection. Then
there is targeting. PESA can detect another ship at longer ranges, but
generally sucks on targeting except at shorter ranges.  AESA can target at
longer ranges.
That\'s fairly consistent with RL.

targets for their target).

2. Anti-missile (or anti-anything that tries to pysically intercept

ships have crossing targets and don\'t get any AM attack bonuses.

3. Ships can be designated as "screening." In this case they must be
in the same task force (using old BR terms)--that is the same hex
moving along with the ship that they screen. In this case all ships
grouped like this can group attacks vs. missiles, and get any

This ends up as a rationale for stacking units. The rationale for

It is not mathematically impossible, it has simply(?) not yet been done
mathematically (if we consider numerical solutions no- mathematical).
Also, a three body problem (planet, ship, and star) where the range to the
star is MUCH longer than the orbit in question is basically a two body
problem which is easily calculateable. Orbital mechanics is simple stuff
today and will be MUCCH simpler in the future.

In traveller I guess that most systemdata files contain 3D density plots of
all major bodies so that orbits can be simulated even when the bodies do
not behave like pointmasses (the moon for instance has lots of high density
points on the surface which make orbvits irregular requiring lots of
corrections).

This is true at short ranges but not at long. Active sensors need 16x
antenna area or 16x power output to double the range. Passives need only 4x
antenna area to double the range. GURPS sensor rules have all kinds of
sensors going more or less linearly with range. This is RealLife(tm).

That\'s a good idea.  I always pictured Traveller starship walls as
flat and smooth but I will add some raised control panels and things
like that.  Good idea!

The next thing I\'d like to do is add some bridge viewers that loop
a short space combat movie from Star Wars or Star Trek.  Does anyone

Well, active sensors need 4x antenna area and 4x power, passives need 4x area.
These actually scale pretty similarly.  The problem with astronomy is detection
range for large objects is order 1/2 in area for passive sensors (assuming
constant illumination), order 1/4 in area for active sensors.  GT sensor rules
have a lot of problems (with GURPS Vehicles rules, Venus is invisible to the
naked eye).

If you happen to have Quake 2 and wish to use an editor for this kind of
stuff, I\'d advise Qoole, especially if you\'re a beginner. It has an
intuitive interface and is plenty easy to do.

If you\'re more than slightly interested in this stuff hit the Rust game
design site at:

http://www.gamedesign.net

They take the stuff seriously and have a ton of good tutorials on all
aspects of creating levels for most of the 1st person "true" 3D shooters.

Oh, and you have to go buy Quake...not being a fan of twitch games, I
don\'t own any of them. I suppose I should look at one, but I saw a demo
of Quake, and while the so-called VR is better than, say Doom, it still
bites, IMHO. Oh, yes, and it won\'t install on my hardware <whine whine
;->

More to the point:

Maybe it\'s me, but the perspective view in these games is _wrong_
somehow. (relating directly to my \'it bites\' comment) It gets to me like
my glasses are knocked out of whack. The one time I played Doom, I got
motion-sick for a day; not an experience I\'ll likely want to
repeat...all the misery of drinking too much and having the spins
without any of the fun alcoholic bits beforehand... (and I don\'t get
motion sick in moving things...I think it was the disjoint beween what
my eyes are telling my brain and what my inner ear is telling it...)

No, IMHO he just expanded the space scale appropriately.
Whereas Traveller will have planetary actions where the
battle tends to come in from the 100 diameter limit and be
fought close to the planet, Weber establishes a conceptually
similar Hyper Limit around whole solar systems, with transit
times in the many-hours to days to get from there to insystem
(roughly comperable to the timescales involved in moving from
100 diam to planetary surfaces, etc).

This doesn\'t really help us understand Traveller system-scale
strategic maneuvering... but does provide useful analogies
for single "battles" near single target points/planets and
the potential maneuvering involved.

Cheating. You\'d need an almighty big eye to see Venus from it\'s
emissions in the visual band. The `Mk.1 Eyeball\' is in fact one half of
a bistatic active system, with the other half in this case being Sol.

>Mines are basically impossible at Traveller ranges - space is too big.

Modern wet navies use `CAPTOR\' (CAPtive TORpedo) mines -  a passive
sensor which, when triggered, fires a lightweight torpedo at the target.
Perhaps some whizz would like to gen. a similar effort up (using a big
missile or whatever) for Traveller?

In WWI, the British Fleet was divided (There was at least one Battle Squadron
attached to the Channel fleet).

During the Napoleonic Wars, the British Fleet was divided (with squadrons all
around the World).

Operational/tactical, yep. Note that the `Run to the South\' at Jutland was an
intentional division of the Fleet to bring the enemy to battle; and Trafalgar
is famous for the British forces forming two divisions and not a `line of
battle.\'

This doesnt\' seem to be the way the rules are written; the only difference
is that an active detection gets you a +2 to hit. Active sensors have 
significantly longer ranges (long enough that there\'s no big penalty to beign
active most of the time.)

>That\'s fairly consistent with RL.
Not especially (depending on what an AESA includes.) Radar is a terrible sensor
to aim a laser with; it just doesn\'t have the angular resolution you need for
a fine targeting solution. Passive visible-light or near-IR sensors are much
much better. The only significant problem they have is determining range (which
is important for long-range laser fire), but any pair of ships, or ship+drone
can measure range perfectly with passive sensors, or one can build up a 
submarine-like targeting solution through maneuver and fire. 

The perfect fire control sensor is of course a LIDAR, but LIDARs are useless
for search.

minutes, and Half-Life seems to be no better.  Rainbow Six did not affect me
in that way, because the movement was correct.  What makes you and me both
motion sick is more-than-likely the bobbing up and down of the movement.
The tweaked perspective may have something to do with it as well, though I
have no problem with it in Rainbow Six.  Unfortunately, R6 doesn\'t have the
same level-creation support that the Quake / Half-Life communtiy has :(

Bruce, how do react to QTVR or Real Picture panoramas?  I\'ve plans to do
some of those as well.

What I\'m looking for is vectored thrust (for spacecombat),
possibly tilting the whole engine, and high-tech propulsion
systems. It really hurts my suspension of disbelife that a TL-15
must use a jet engine for extra thrust.

I remember a discusion some time back about the notion that heplear
used a airbreathing mode in the atmosphere. Anyone got stats for a 
purely atmosphereic version? For electric turboprops or fans/propellers 
(fision powered)? Arcjets?

Yeah, spending money is a problem.

On the plus side, the 3D environment of the current generation of first
person shooters is quite good. Jedi Knight, particularly, did a good job of
portraying huge panoramas and breathtaking heights. Games like Unreal,
Quake 2, and Half-Life are significant improvements over the 1st and 2nd
generation 3d games. Effects like fog, water, and the like are handled
*very* well.

Hardware support is a problem, though. Unreal almost *requires* 3dfx. Quake
2 is an OpenGL game. Jedi Knight uses Direct3D (I think). All of them ran
on my PC at home without such support, but very poorly and at low
resolution. But when I got a video card (with and ATI RagePro chipset) ...
wow! Well, except for Unreal, that is.

The only one of these I can think of that is currently out on the Mac side
is Unreal.

Do you have the same difficulty with VRML? Perhaps it wouldn\'t be so bad
for just a simple "walk through" experience. No running, no jumping, no
bang bang, just a nice, slow tour of a ship\'s interior.

"WALDPORT, Oregon (AP) -- Three hundred miles offshore, the wreck of the
New Carissa finally sank Thursday after a Navy destroyer fired 70 shells
into the oil-laden hulk and a submarine drilled it with a torpedo.

"First, remote-controlled explosive charges blew holes in the hull of the
wreck that has plagued the Oregon coast for more than a month, fouling
miles of beaches.

"When that failed to sink the ship, the destroyer USS David R. Ray opened
up a barrage of artillery fire from its 5-inch guns, and then the nuclear
sub USS Bremerton fired a torpedo shot into the hulk.

"Finally, two hours after demolition experts began their efforts, the
stubborn wreck slipped under the water back-end first and began its descent
two miles to the sea floor.

"It had nine lives and it was not willing to cooperate with us," said Navy
Cmdr. Cliff Perkins, the destroyer\'s commanding officer. \'This thing seems
to have a life of its own.\'"

If that *is* the problem, you can turn off the bobbing movement on the
Options menu in Q2. Dunno about Half-Life.

The reason I brought it up is because I thought it\'d be easiest to make
deckplan walkthroughs with Quake-engine tools because they are so widely
supported, including prefabs. And since the setting is a sci fi one, it
seems that a  lot of the prefabs would be appropriate. ...

Mere popguns! While I wouldn\'t want to be under fire from one, a 5"
naval gun is about the _smallest_ in use on large ships. They\'re useful
against small craft, but for something the sze of a tanker you\'ll need
something bigger to actually sink it. I\'d like to have seen what the

Probably make about 3x as large a hole (3x as large in every dimension). 
Probably only around a dozen shots to sink the ship then.  Also, while 5" guns
are pretty small, torpedos aren\'t...

It might be small by WW2\'s standards, but unless I\'m mistaken it\'s about the
largest currently in service.  A FFG-7 Class mounts a 76mm gun for example.

I hate to intrude reality, but according to a quick check, the 127mm gun is
superseded only by the CIS 130mm gun (several versions).  IIRC, once the
Iowas were moored,the largest guns afloat belonged to, of all people, the
Chileans, who still maintain the O\'Higgins, the ex-USS Brooklyn, a US CL
launched in 1936, with 15 152mm guns, and Peru, with two ex-De Ruyters, also
armed with "puny" 152mm guns.  Note that this is from a source from 1992.
It is possible that even these behomeths are no longer in commision, I\'d
have to go to the library to find out.  A final note, the "small" 127mm 54
calibre gun fires fixed ammo with a higher velocity than most ground-mounted
sytems.  Even naval 76mm guns are quite deadly, typically being fully
automatic and having very high velocities for CPR guns.  And of course, they
typically have excellent fire control, being fully stabilized and having
range finders, ballistic computers, etc.  All in all, not quite ineffective.

Oh, Jesse!  When I think about a Half-Life level thats the internal of, say
an Empress Marava, with your textures similar to the ones on your

I stay away from VRML.  But I\'d download a HL Marava level.

Thats probably from the angular compression these types of games
normally do to squeeze 90 degrees into your monitor.

At least in QII, that is totally configurable/customizable.

And they\'ve come a looong way since Quake.  QIII demos are out
but I haven\'t tried them yet. Halflife is the most gorgeous thing I\'ve seen
and I\'ll bet QIII is even better.

That also is totally configurable in Quake II.  You just need to

OK, how about Sirius? In GURPS sensor terms, you can\'t see Sirius with a 
passive sensor either. (And calling the reflected sunlight from Venus "active"
is a quibble - GURPS still models it badly, because most combat occurs in
regions close to stars and hence reflected sunlight is important.)

Quark supports Q1, Q2, HalfLife, Heretic 2, Hexen 2, Sin, 
and can easily be extended to support others. 

I and my coworkers have used Quark to develop a Quake
modification professionally in \'97; I give it two thumbs up.

The developer, Armin Rigo, was at the time very responsive
to our requests and problem reports; most every apparent-bug
and deficiency we spotted was already being fixed by the 
time we reported it. I think he\'s spending less time on it
now, but it\'s still a very solid program.

There should probably be the same net effect as for T-plates, methinks.  The
art still shows a "thrust-like" plume of... something, even if it\'s just an
ambiguous glow of some kind.

The way HEPlaR/T-plates are presented in FF&S and Challenge wouldn\'t affect
any of the source material, adventures, or campaigning in any way.  The
assumptions of refueling at gas giants would still hold true (though less fuel
would be required), for the jump drives, etc.  Only difference is in
particular designs, etc.  I contemplated having T-plates be what used pre-
collapse and that the particulars of the technology would require that they be
integrated with the computer and AG/G-comp in such a way that Virus would
require that be replaced in the New Era, for a complete protection against
infection.  But then I decided it didn\'t matter for me.  YMMV.  :-)

Was there any handwave given for how the ship they\'re fired at is still there

Note that I said B*R* or Battle Rider.  BL is IMO only appropriate for the PCs
vessel, and that wasn\'t too cumbersome for all the PCs to manage their own
ship (and they\'re hardly \'serious gamers\').  That level of detail, for the
players ship anyways, is required and desired, IMO anyways.

After the RC, I\'d have to say maybe the Regency, though I have plans on
running an near future Alternate Universe w/ 3D astrography (granted by Jim
V\'s equally excellent Starmap v. 1.0) and Alternate Tech from FF&S.  It\'s
looking very 2300AD, but I\'m mostly gonna continue running the RC in the 1203
for my upcoming set of campaigns.   Next, would have to follow the early
Rebellion (Solomani Confederation), though I\'ve never run anything outside of
the RC or Regency except a one timer set *during* the Collapse (Virus hits,
the sh*t hits the fan and find a way to survive/escape doom).

The players in my game ended up grounded on a primitive planet, and wanted
to refuel, but for reasons I won\'t go into, they could not lift off and go
to skim the oceans. So the engineer built a drilling rig and sunk a well,
then used a pump to bring groundwater up and send it into the tanks.

He joked that he\'d just built a Class D Starport  ;)

Atom Laser Invented
Opens Possibilities for Atom Construction 

By Paul Recer
The Associated Press

W A S H I N G T O N,  March 11 - Scientists have invented a
device that shoots streams of atoms in any direction the
same way that a laser sends out beams of light. 

The breakthrough, made possible by nudging super-cold,
super-slow atoms into a beam, could lead to a revolutionary new
tool for making extremely small computer chips, said William D.
Phillips, who led a federal team that developed the device. 

A report on the work appears Friday in the journal Science.

    'body' => 'An early easter present for ECM designers: 
- ----

IR and visible enhancers allow a ship to simulate another, larger ship class.

The designer first selects the signature level being simulated. This must
be greater than the signature of the ship carrying the enhancer (and,
ideally, one whole point greater.) 

An "all-aspect" IR enhancer requires considerable power, with the
exact power requirements depending on the type of ship being simulated:

IR Signature	Power required
- -2		0.005 MW
- -1.5		0.05 MW
- -1.0		0.5 MW
- -0.5		5 MW
0		50 MW
0.5		500 MW
1.0		5000 MW
1.5		50000 MW
2.0		500000 MW


A "single-arc" enhancer only appears as an enhanced target in one
thirty-degree arc (chosen at time of design, although some ships may
have multiple single-arc enhancers installed and only one powered
at a given time.)

Enhancers have a volume of 0.2 m3 per MW of power used and an
area of 1 m2 per MW. They cost [MCr 0.01 per m2] and mass 1 tonne per m3. 
For ships or drones with limited surface area they
may be designed as folding arrays; these reduce surface area requirements
by a factor of ten and increase cost by a factor of two.
[Cost is a guess - 
I don\'t have FFS2 handy - could someone tell me how much radiator area and
price you need per MW at TL12?]



Visible-light enhancers are large areas of specialized chamelon skin, 
requiring little power but considerable surface area:


Vis. signature		Area
- -1.5			5 m2
- -1.0			50 m2
- -0.5			500 m2
0.0			5000 m2
0.5			50000 m2
1.0			500000 m2

Visible-light enhancers have a volume of 0.05 m3 per m2 of area. They cost
MCr 0.05 per m2. For ships or drones with limited surface area they
may be designed as folding arrays; these reduce surface area requirements
by a factor of ten and increase cost by a factor of two.

An IR or visible enhancer may only
appear as a ship of equal or lower tech level. Enhancers normally
are configured to simulate one particular ship class. "Adaptable" enhancers
capable of simulating multiple classes have twice the area, volume, and cost
but the same power requirement. Configuring an adaptable enhancer to 
simulate a particular ship type is a Difficult ECM roll, Staggering if 
the class is a military ship belonging to a rival government (or in other
cases in technical data from the manufacturer is not available.) 

Enhancers may be switched off at will. Operating an enhancer is an Easy
ECM roll, +1 DM (harder) if the enemy ships have not yet been detected.
When activated, the ship
will appear to have a higher signature to all affected hostile targets, 
and will initially appear to be of the selected simulated class.  
Determining that a detected ship is using an enhancer is normally an
Impossible sensor roll. This is modified by as follows:

Signal: -1 DM for each point of (sensitivity-range+signature) the ship
	has been detected by
Tech level: -1 DM for each tech level the sensor exceeds the enhancer by
Signature: +1 DM (harder) if the ship carrying the enhancer has a signature
	1 point or more less than the signature being simulated

If the roll is more difficult than Impossible it may not be attempted. 
In general, at tactical combat ranges enhancers will be quickly detected
(typical signals at combat ranges on previously-detected targets are
around +3 or more.)

normal procedure is to ask for permission to ocean refuel, and they dont

being the players were on the run from subsector authorities for a couple
of reasons and really didnt
want to announce their presence. 

So they decided to refuel without permission. they were in an A2 
Far Trader, and set down in the ocean for a drink. The Locals picked the
ship up on traffic control radars, but due to it being local night, didnt want
to send aircraft out to investigate. a little while later the guy on sensor
watch
screams at the captain "High Speed Screws in the Water!!!!1"
there was a group of submarines in the area that went to investigate. and a
couple 
of local equivilants to the Guppy class fired a spread of torpedoes. the
guy on sensors
must have been asleep or something.  they were in the water but had the cg
on standby
so the pilot took her straight up. she avoided the torps, but almost caught
a couple of 8" shells 
from the wolf pack leader, a rough equivilant of the French Surcouf class
Cruiser Sub
at this point, the captain decided it was time to find out why the locals
were so pissed.
whoops.

I was wondering how to handle damage if the torpedoes had actually hit.

One of the locals came up and offered to refuel the ship, which the party
agreed to - then they went off for a day of business and carousing.

When they came back, they found a canvass hose fitting into a starship fuel
nozzle, leading back to a primitive mule-powered (mule attached to the pump,
walks around in a circle to move the fluid) pump.

Took three days (and 4 mules) to refuel the starship.

They may be playing free demos.  Usually you have to have a registered
version of Quake to play in multiplayer, which means that it was paid
for somewhere in the line.  Its possible to crack those codes, but I doubt
that is what is going on.  There are a great many multiplayer modifications
for Quake that are totally free.  They\'re created by volunteers and there
is no restrictions on their use.  These are also the most creative and
interesting variants to play.  So I think your kids are ok, legally speaking.

If I recall the stories, protectors perceive their bloodlines fairly
narrowly ... only their _own_ offspring (and maybe close relatives)
"smell" right. That\'s why most protectors simply stop living if their
bloodlines are destroyed. No revenge, no struggle, they just ...
stop. And it\'s not conscious choice, it\'s wired in. Only a *very* few
ever "adopt" the entire race.

Now take someone as deranged ... I mean as creative as
Ditzieeeeeeeeeeee, triple her already astronomical IQ, make her
almost as physically durable as a battle-dressed Marine, and wait for
someone to threaten her family ...

Guess what ... most of us will be COMPETING with Ditzieeeeeeeeeee\'s
bloodline ... and therefore a threat.

Will the rest of FS unite to save humaniti from one of their own ...
or join her?

Me, I\'m heading for the next galaxy over.

Depends on you target. Newer tankers are built like bricks.

Way back when I was young. I was ordered to board a tanker that was
hit by a mine in the Persian Gulf. a small gash in the outer hull, a hairline
crack in the inner, and a couple of stuck below decks hatches.

Damn. The IT department would move on a legal issue, but ignores the fact
that kids playing Quake mean that other kids can\'t do their work.  My team
leader is proud that 40% of the computers are used for school work - I
think that 60% being used to play games is a shocking waste of taxpayers\'
money.  (And also impossible to stop, given the current configuration and
lack of staff to supervise every screen.)

Oh well, March Break has officially started here. Just got to shop for a

What they fail to mention is that this was just the bow section. The
stern (with all the heavy machinery) is still stuck on the beach near
Coos Bay. And "failed to sink" means that the bow was still sticking up
out of the water.

It establishes that *this* is where *you* are supposed to be parked,
and over *there* is where some other ship is supposed to be parked. And
you *don\'t* have to calculate an orbit. You merely have to match
velocities and move around the satellite until the docking light is
centered (the light points in the ahead or behind direction, or there
may even be different colored lights one pointing in each direction)

That later config would allow two ships per "bouy" if necessary.

That\'s not the purpose.

Sorry, but you have been reading overly simplified descriptions. The
*general* three body solution (ie you start with any three bodies, of
any masses, in any position, with any velocities) is what is generally
called "insoluble". There *is* a solution. But it involves a converging
series that converges too slowly to be *practical*. 

There are *lots* of solutions to *specific* three body problems. For
example, the so-called "trojan points" are a solution. There are just
limits on the positions velocities and masses for which the solution
applies. 

Heck, they assign orbital "slots" to geosynchronous satellites right
now, to avoid problems with collisions, and interference. 

For objects of insignificant mass orbiting a *massive* object such as a
planet, you can get solutions that are good for *years* using fairly
simple programs.

Heck, by your logic commsats don\'t work!

Get real. You aren\'t grasping the *scale* involved. To become hazards
you\'d not only need *millions* of them, you\'d have to have them in all
sorts of orbits.

So? The variation in distance will be pretty minor. Remember, the
*same* forces will be acting on both the satellite and the ship. True,
they\'ll be happening at slightly different times, but that shouldn\'t be
that big a factor.

So what if the distance between them varies from 10 to 1000 meters.
Given that (for example) geosynch orbit has a length of over 230,000
km, you could park ships 10 km apart and have 23,000 of them parked. 

Obviously, all parking orbits need to be at the same inclination (and
probably circular), but if you get really strapped for space, you start
assigning with differing radii. 

To hold a million ships, you only need 40 orbits with 25,000 slots each
or 50 with 20,000 slots each. Assume the radii are set every 100 km or
so, that has the ships spread out in an annulus 5000 km "across". But
there\'s still *plenty* of space for traffic.

I don\'t beleive that Protector would still be the appropriate name for a
Ditzieee Pak. Something more along the line of Destructor might be more
appropriate!

For what it\'s worth, I think tripling Ditzie\'s IQ would shunt her well
beyond the limits of sanity.

Unfortunatly for DitziePak, FS competes against itself. She\'ll be so busy
keeping the other tykes in line she wont have the time and energy to deal
with the rest of the galaxy.

I mean, would any Pak allow it\'s bloodline to play with the sort of R+D FS
comes out with ?

Probably a plan whenever FS is involved, yes.

Not so.  One Exocet hit the destroyer Sheffield, which burned quickly and
was abandoned.  However, she didn\'t sink for a couple of days.  there was
even hope that she might be salvaged, and they were trying to tow her out
when the weather turned bad, I think.

The Argentines lost Belgrano, an ex-US Navy cruiser, to a torpedo spread (2
hits, IIRC).  She did sink in a matter of minutes, largely due to the
complete lack of warning and lack of preparation by the crew.  

Both were effective kills, but the speed of sinking depends on whether the
holes you make  let in air or water.  Missiles will kill, but not
necessarily sink.  Torpedoes will do both.

ObTrav: standard Traveller space combat missiles don\'t have nearly as
impressive an effect on their target as contemporary anti-ship missiles and
torpedoes do, unless you use nukes.  One or two missile hits aren\'t going
to kill any but the smallest Traveller warship.

You can also do it "in browser" using a Java redirector. It\'s what we did with
our "help pages " at work, we wanted people to be able to hit F1 and go to the
right (context-sensitive) page, we also wanted a menu and title frame always
there with the help page in a sub frame.

As you say, you can\'t directly do this in HTML, but you can specify a Java
applet in the frame that takes the "paramter" part of the URL to redirect the
frame to the apporpiate page..

You may have 2 separate surface actions mingled.  The Brits didn\'t lose a
cruiser, the Arger\'s lost one to a torp. The Brits lost the HMS Sheffield,
a guided missile frigate to an Exocet.  (BTW as an interesting tid-bit of
information the cruiser, the name escapes me, was the last major ship still
on active service that was at Pearl when the Jap\'s attacked.  We sold it
the Argentina in the late 60\'s it think.)

Well the sinking can be attributed to cost savings measures by the British
navy.  The ship was a frigate and some years back the Brits started making
their guided missile FG\'s out of high-tech aluminum alloy.  It was lighter,
very hard, resistant to the corrosion of saltwater and to barnacles so it
saved tons of money on maintenance.  As an added plus when decommissioned
it brought top dollars as scrap.  The drawback became painfully clear when
the missile hit.  The Exocet has a shaped charge so it penetrated the hull
like hot butter then exploded inside to cause max damage.  The fires were
so intense that the aluminum hull began to melt and burn at a much lower
temp then a steel alloy hull would, the fumes were toxic which hampered
fire fighting efforts.  Now I can\'t remember exactly but I don\'t think the
Exocet sank the Sheffield but instead it was abandoned and the Royal navy
scuttled her either with torps or surface fire, though I\'m pretty sure it
was a torp below the waterline, quick and clean with less moral problems
then associated with watching the ship get torn apart by surface guns.

We also once made a water landing on a 97C water surface by a floating
port/raft, with clouds of steam obscuring everything and the requirement to
be towed by boat into a floating berth. In high sea conditions.

Common misconception. Because large shells do so much damage to
large amoured targets, people assume that they will do similar damage
to small unarmoured vessels. However the truth is that, unless they hit
something with significant resistance (like an engine), the Mo\'s guns
would only make two neat 40.6cm holes in the hull.

following data of use :-

Power Output, Watts	Duration	Comments
1119			5 seconds	Trained cyclist
373			5 seconds	Average cyclist
283			15 seconds
142			30 seconds
71			1-2 minutes
37			\'indefinite\'

Muscle efficiency estimates range from 21-27% (overall thermal ->
mechanical) for the following activities.

Activity	Peak Velocity	Duration
Swimming	6.5		~1min
Walking		12.9		~10min
Rowing		17.7		~5 min
Running		36		~10 sec
Roller skating	35		~2 min
Ice skating	48		~2 min
Cycling		60		~10 sec

peak velocities are in km/h, without external assistance.

Ob Trav :-
(a rethink of an earlier post) :-
Power Output, W/kg	Duration	Comments
0.5			\'indefinite\'	Basal
1			1-2 mins	X 2
2			30 seconds	X 4
4			15 seconds	X 8
5			5 seconds	X 10

This is for an average human (STR 7, END 7).

For strength values above 7 :-
X1.2 per point above 7 to basal power output.
STR   8    9    10   11   12   13   14   15
Bonus 1.2  1.4  1.7  2.1  2.5  3.0  3.6  4.3

So a character with STR 12 has a base power output of 1.25W/kg.

Athletics skill should factor in here too. +10% per skill level (+5%
per T5 skill level)?

The role of the endurance stat is set an upper limit to task duration :-

e.g.
To maintain power output at a given level :-
(End + skill*) > Difficulty

Multiple of basal power output	Difficulty
2				Average
4				Difficult
8				Formidable
10				Staggering
16+				Impossible

* Use Athletics skill or Strength, whichever is higher.
Time increment is as per \'Duration\' column of the power output table
e.g. if working at 2X basal power, check every minute. 

Relating this to other quantities :-

ST X 1 : load that can be carried for more than 5 minutes = basal power
ST X 2 : encumbrance, -1 to physical chars
ST X 3 : military heavy load, -2 to chars
ST X 5 : load that can be carried for less than 5 mins = X 2 basal
ST X 10 : maximum liftable for a minute or less = X 4 basal
ST X 15 : maximum draggable for five mins or less = X 8 basal
ST X 20 : maximum liftable for fifteen seconds or less = X 10 basal
ST X 30 : maximum liftable for five seconds or less (symmetrical e.g.
weight bar) 
ST X 60 : maximum draggable for fifteen seconds or less
ST X 90 : maximum draggable for five seconds or less

\'Liftable\' implies lifting the weight above one\'s head. 
Dragging things for the sake of convenience is 3X easier than lifting
them, and is equivalent to lifting something to knee height at best.

Comments and constructive criticism welcome.

leisure....

Over on the HIWG list, David Golden wrote (a little while ago) that he
wanted some input from Marc about an FF&S type book for (the eagerly
awaited) T5.

Activity on that list has slowed to an all-time low.

Assuming that Marc doesn\'t farm out the game entirely to Steve Jackson
(sadly, this seems increasingly likely, given the excellent quality of
\'Far Trader\' and \'First In\') and a software company, what would the
folks of the TML like to see in the book?

Examples :-

* One design \'meta-sequence\' for all vehicle types
(ground/water/air/space-grav).
* Quick design sequences a la \'High Guard\' for each vehicle type.
* Massaging the rules a little ; if you can\'t \'build\' an RW vehicle with
the system, the system is broken!
* Expand scope of book to cover robots, cybernetics, personal armour,
buildings and infrastructure as well as weapons.
* Provide example designs and standard weapon tables (like MT, 101
Vehicles, etc.).
* Provide conversion tables (Striker/MT/TNE armour ratings ; guidelines
to convert designs to and from GURPS?).
* Include a vehicle combat system (if there isn\'t one in the core
rules). Bruce Mac\'s MCS could provide a useful basis for this.
* Incorporate the \'Reliability\', \'Ease of Use\' and \'Hazard\' indices [or
some similar secondary attributes] tentatively introduced in \'Emperor\'s
Vehicles\' to make a pilot/driver\'s job a little more interesting. ("The
P-15 is an unforgiving piece of machinery, but it\'s the fastest fighter
around!")

Anyone out there want to constructively add to the wishlist?

Or shall we all go out and buy VDS (which is a great bit of work ; many
thanks to Greg Porter and Phil McGregor!*) and wait for Bruce Mac to
present the \'DDSR\' (cheaper sensors, please)?

* check out www.hyperbooks.com for details

Mass is in kg, volume m3, HE and HEAP penetration/damage.
Penetration is in FF&S2 armour points ; divide by 1.43 to get FF&S1
penetration ; divide by 2.86 to get cm steel for conversion to
MT/Striker (IIRC, AV 40 = 33 cm steel = FF&S1 66, FF&S2 94)

Looking at the table above, a standard Free Trader would suffer a hull
breach only with the heavier ordnance - which your attack subs sound
like they would be packing.

Alternatively, resolve as a 300kg shaped charge slapped against the
hull.

Effects range from a sinking spaceship to an exploding one (as all that
liquid hydrogen quickly exits the fuel tank and smells the air...)

Fusion plants need 0.01 m2/MW, fuel cells and Fusion+ 1m2/MW. Price

An optimised CT scanner/X-ray for spaceflight. Dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA, natch) is used to assess bone mineral density
(femoral and humeral neck) in the management of osteoporosis.

Intriguing.
Determinants of cardiac output are heart rate (autonomic nervous system
tone key controller) and stroke volume (preload [filling pressure],
afterload [peripheral vascular resistance], myocardial contractility
[measurement of which is of ongoing controversy in physiological circles
currently] ).

ECG/EKG + ultrasound (Doppler and B-mode) to measure aortic size and
flows ; blood pressure measurement, probably with a DINAMAP (TM) or
similar device.

>(c) a miniature portable mass spectrometer to identify the

Cool device, much more flexible than antibody based \'noses\' currently
under development.

More robust than a Geiger counter.

ObTrav <g> : do you take a californium slug along to calibrate the
neutron spectrometer?

	I would really, really want to see a Quick Vehicle Design system and a set of

order.  
	

	As to a vehicle combat system, I want to repeat my fondest wish:  A seamless
way to integrate Starships and Starship weaponry into planetary actions.
Think it is only fitting that if I need to know how a combat between
atmospheric fighters and a laser-armed Free Trader turns out, it should be
clearly set up in the rules, without a struggle.

	Armor conversions for Striker. MT would be a nice bonus, since there are so
many vehicle designs already out there, a quick conversion system would be a
great time-saver for actual game play.

How do you know that your velocities match, if you didn\'t calculate the
orbits? Orbital velocity is a non-linear function of time in three
dimensions. What you suggest requires calculating the orbit of the
satellite, and your own orbit, and making the appropriate corrections to
bring them into alignment.

Fundamentals of Astrodynamics, Bate, Mueller, and White -- which is still
the standard introductory text on celestial mechanics, even at the graduate
level -- p. 9:

"[The n-body equation] is a second order, nonlinear, vector, differential
equation of motion _which_has_defied_solution_ in its present form."
[emphasis mine]

Solving an n-body problem requires 6n integrals: 3 each of position and
motion for every body. But only 10 integrals can be obtained from the
general equation of motion. Thus 2-body problems can be solved
analytically, but 3-body solutions require restrictions (co-planar, etc.)
before they become solvable.

The "solutions" to which you refer are numerical integrations,
approximations run by iteration on fast computers. I grant you the better
the computer, the better the approximation.

"Resonant effects can be significant. For a satellite of 800 km altitude,
over a 2-10 day period, resonant effects can alter the along track position
of the satellite by 500 meters. In general, about 80% of a resonant effect
is along track, about 5% radially, and 15% across track." Introduction to
Satellite Geodesy and Orbital Analysis, Alexander and Schanzle, p. 99.

In point of fact, gravitational anomolies on the order exhibited by the
earth cause geosynchronous satellites to librate 180 degrees through their
orbit over a fairly short period of time -- up to 10 km per day! These
satellites have to *maneuver* constantly to maintain their position:

"Current [geosynchronous] satellites are provided with enough fuel to last
7 years. This will probably be extended to 10 years, since the electronics
of the satellites are lasting that long. When fuel becomes low, inclination
corrections are abandoned and the inclination of the satellites drifts
about 0.8 degrees/year. Use of these satellites is then sold at a cheaper
rate. Earlier on, satellites, when they ran out of fuel, were left to
librate, but now, if possible, they are kicked into a higher orbit to
decrease the probability of collision." Ibid., p. 105.

I am quite serious. By definition, these objects inhabit the very orbits
and tracks where most of your commercial space traffic takes place. How
much time, computationally, is required to _ensure_ that any particular
ship\'s orbit will not intersect one of them? Remember, the orbits are not
deterministic and they change with time. The pilot may not care ("big sky,
little bullet"), but I assure you his insurance underwriter does. Notice
the reference to "the probability of collision" in the quotation above?

It is certainly possible, but it is wasteful and an unnecessary risk.

Thank you, you\'ve just made my point very nicely: if there is so much room,
who needs the additional clutter and expense of "parking" satellites? Just
assign my unique orbital elements (which you would have to do anyway, to
tell me where to find my "parking" satellite) and let me obtain that orbit
and sit there, without having to worry about my position relative to some
satellite. My orbit may be slightly perturbed by gravitational anomolies
and n-body effects, but there is (now) nothing within the magnitude of that
error to hit.

Lastly, consider that someone has to place, maintain, and recover the
things; someone also has to pay for this activity. A significant fraction
of the time and manpower of US Coast Guard and Federal Aviation
Administration are devoted to the maintenance of navigational markers.

To summarize: "parking" satellites would be an unnecessary, redundant and
expensive source of information better obtained elsewhere, and a potential
hazard to navigation. Hence, I find them unlikely.

Explore the question of what happens in the face of certain doom,

There\'s also the bit at the end when The Master gets The Doctor.
Or vice versa, depending on your point of view.

Yep, I don\'t think that gives the plot away:-)

HMS Sheffield was a Type 42 Destroyer.

The ARA General Belgrano was the ex-USS Phoenix. There\'s a pretty good

No no no. HMS Sheffield was a Type 42 Destroyer, with a steel hull and
superstructure. The hull did not melt when the exocet hit - the damage
was extensive because:

(a) The hit ignited the oil fries in the galley.
(b) The detonation knocked out both DC firemains - no water to put the
fire out
(c) The detonation knocked out one of the DC control rooms.

The toxic fumes you mention were from PVC-insulated electrical systems,
not burning metal. We now use non-toxic insulation.

HMS Sheffield was taken under tow, but the tow parted at night in foul
weather and she sank.

ObTrav: Any cases of *old* historical warships being given to colonial
fleets, and then destroyed years later by an ally of the donating power?

When they hit an unarmored target, they go boom IMMEDIATELY (when really
almost immediately, as momentum of 2700\'/second is enough to insure that the
shell is INSIDE the hull when it goes boom). No doubt the physicists on the

This confirms a hunch I had that SJ wouldn\'t want to publish T5 as it might

The new (a couple of years old) class of Swedish submarine uses the 
Wankel engine. IIRC a Swedish company built the engine but I can\'t 
remember which one. It was supposed to be _really silent_ compered with 
a Diesel as the Wankel design doesn\'t vibrate much. So the Wankel is

That gibes with what I heard. I still sense some design flaws in the ship. By
this description, it sounds like the design didn\'t have enough combat
redundancy in her DC equipment, though the hit location sounds like bad luck
as well. I also vaguely read somplace that she lacked a close in weapon system
and ECM suite, so the missile couldn\'t by shot down/jammed. Lastly I heard
that the missile was picked up very late on radar (last 30-40 seconds of
flight?), which if true makes me wonder about her sensor suite.

To be fair; I also heard that these flaws were redressed after the war. The
vessels gained ECM, and a close in weapon system (either CIWS or Goalkeeper; I
can\'t remember...), and the RN adopted an AEW helo, and better fighter
director and control precedures, so they wouldn\'t have to leave lone ships on
radar picket. It\'s a pity that the RN got rid of the first Ark Royal. Her
Phantoms and AEW craft would have NEVER let the Argentinians got close enough
for an Exocet shot in the first place...

I am concerned that the new supersonic seaskimming missiles can not be shot
down by rotary cannon anymore. I hope that a new system in the works to
replace CIWS and Goalkeeper...

Absolutely.  The RN has radically redesigned fire-fighting arrangements in
later designs, going to two isolated fire mains that remain wet at all
times and making lots of other changes in hardware and training.

Her radar was not working for reasons that have never been made clear,
possibly to do with operating her satellite com system, but probably not.. 
There\'s also a sense that her combat information center (I forget the RN
term) was not very alert.  For some reason, Sheffield did not react to the
alert call from another ship in the picket screen which would have given
then enough warning to at least fire chaff.

The

Goalkeeper; I can\'t remember...),

Just a nit: CIWS is a generic term for a close-in weapon system, the US
system is Phalanx, and that\'s that the Type 42s got.

For the RN, SeaWolf  is close to being a point-defense weapon and a
missile-based system has been considered for future ships.  For the US
Navy, Rolling Airframe Missile is replacing Phalanx .  It pushes engagement
ranges out significantly, which should help a lot with the supersonic
sea-skimmer threat.  

 
> Ob Trav: HG and TCS maybe?

In GT at least, some folks have been talking about developing ship-killing 
bomb-pumped x-ray laser missiles.  Classical laser/sandcaster point defense
won\'t cut it against these monsters, so you might need anti-missile
missiles.

Does anyone else remember the LaserQuest game?  The one where you run around
a CO2 and flashing-light filled \'arena\' with a pack strapped on chest and

Loren, didn\'t indicate that was being considered during the recent
online chat he held.  He did indicate that he thought Marc was using
the strong sales of GT material to take time to tweek, doublecheck
and playtest T5.

All IMO...

>Examples :-

This has always been an important goal.

A la QDSS and the GT modules.  I\'ve never understood the reverance
some of you have for HG, either tactically or as a design system.

You\'ll never get a usable system that handles *all* RW vehicles, but
I think we could do better.

OT: So, why is it armour and not robouts? ;p 

Probably should, for space reasons either won\'t or compromises will
be made. You are getting into two or three book content here.

Certainly.

Yes, but while you\'re at it, why not G^3 as well?

Could it?  Ok, all you wargame grognards, those of us that
*roleplay* want a *roleplaying* vehicle combat system.  You can have
yours only if we get ours. ;p

Introduced in G^3, VDS, and G:V2.  I wouldn\'t bring "Emperor\'s
Vehicles" up if I were you.

>Anyone out there want to constructively add to the wishlist?

Alternative Technologies!!!

I\'m still waiting for Ether Propellers, Stutterwarp, Tachyon Drives
and weapons, etc.  I want technology effects that affect technology
choices, ie. if a society choses X, it degrades it\'s ability to use
Y; (ex:  you can have anti-grav, but it creates fields that shorten
the MTBF for electronics making all electronic tech more expensive,
larger, and heavier); or if it discovers A, it becomes unlikely it
will discover Z ( ex:  at TL3 a society discovers how to make
something like "cold fusion" actually work, so what technologies are
*not* researched and developed and which ones are).

>Or shall we all go out and buy VDS (which is a great bit of work ;
>many thanks to Greg Porter and Phil McGregor!*) and wait for Bruce
>Mac to present the \'DDSR\' (cheaper sensors, please)?

Ok, VDS is good and so is G:V2, but neither "get\'s there" for me.
Either of the FFS\'s come closer.

Remember that for Tree of Life Virus to work on you, you have to be the
right age, which is about 42 (coincidence?).  It was my impression that
Ditzie was somewhat younger than this.  If you are too young the smell
does not compel you too eat it as you are supposed to be breeding.  If
you are too old it will not work, although it will probably kill you. 
If your system has lots of drugs in it (and I suspect that most FS
members systems do) the tree of life will not work.  Remember that tree
of life did nothing for Louis Wu because he was 300 years old and had
been on anagathics for centuries.

I was thinking, as this thread was slipping by, that these Pak critters
sound a lot like the Sayat already.  Of course, the Sayat don\'t make that
inefficient and antisocial distinction that the Pak do between
"protectors" and "breeders", nor are they slaves to the knee-jerk
biological determinism of these unfortunate semipeople.  Proper education
and gene therapy should allow them to become exciting & rewarding new
members of the Concourse, I suppose.  

I still get giggles every once in a while thinking what an Alien raised by
Sayat would be like.

It\'s also good to include any pertinant "rules of thumb" for design

level might be.  Anything to point a neophyte in the right direction.)  I
guess I\'m trying to point out that some of the readers, such as myself,

I don\'t believe that\'s right.  IIRC, in Ringworld Engineers he describes
ignoring the smell of Tree of Life as one of the hardest things he\'s ever

Other than everything you\'ve already listed, I\'d like to see
a design system which supports a single, scalable combat
system covering everything from a knife fight to fleet
combat. Example: Assuming 15th century steel plate armor
has a defensive of 12, any ship with a hull rating of 12
is made of the equivalent of 15th century steel plate armor.

I\'m *really* tired of separate damage/armor ratings for melee,
vehicle combat, and space combat. The only version of Traveller
that does this is G:T.

As much as I\'d *like* to take credit for VDS, all I did was to point out some
areas of inconsistency in the first (PDF) version of the rules to Greg ... so he
kindly listed me as one of the playtesters.

*GREG* should receive all the kudos, as he did a *top rate* job ... a Vehicle
Design system that, as far as I can tell (I haven\'t designed esoterica such as
Attack Helos, where there are, evidently, some minor problems according to the
CORPS Player List) gives as close to 100% accuracy when designing real world
vehicles as is humanly possible ... and which gives results for extrapolated
vehicles of the present, near future, and far future, that are at least as
believable!

I agree.  I wouldn\'t have a real problem *with* the GURPS scale.
Hard steel armor in GURPS is *roughly* 10 times the equal thickness
of Traveller-FFS hard steel armor, and the weapons end up doing
proportionally more damage.  (Actually, I think it\'s closer to 12
times, but it\'s close to 10. ;)

If we are going to have a successful line of GT books *and* a line
of T5 books out there.  Wouldn\'t it make sense for the two sets to
be as interchangable as possible?

I think it would make sense to rescale Traveller materials and
weapons to either match or to be exactly 1/10th those in GURPS for
ease of conversion.

I read an news article today that the US Air Force is planning on keeping the
B52 fleet going for another 40 years...thatsa\' one tough airplane!

- ----

WASHINGTON (AP) - The granddaddy of America\'s bombers, the Vietnam
War-era B-52, is going to have to fly four decades into the new century, the Air
Force says. 

By the time it gives way to a new generation, it will be 80-plus years old. 

Most pilots who fly B-52s today were not yet born when their planes entered
service in the early 1960s. And those same planes will be flying well into the 21st
century with pilots of a generation yet to come. 

That certainly speaks highly of an airplane that already has more than tripled its
original life expectancy. 

``Structurally, they are in great shape,\'\' Lt. Gen. Ron Marcotte said
yesterday. As
commander of the 8th Air Force at Barksdale Air Force Base, La. - home to 47
B-52s - Marcotte flies the bombers regularly and says that thanks to exceptional
maintenance, the planes are ``doing extremely well.\'\' 

The first B-52s began their Air Force duty in June 1955; the B-52s now flying
were built in 1961. 

``It\'s amazing,\'\' said Glenn Buchan, a Rand Corp. expert on strategic bombers.
``The B-52 is one of the most remarkably successful airplanes ever built.\'\' 

In fact, Buchan said, the B-52 might be the best model on which to develop the
next generation of long-range bombers - a large plane capable of carrying many
different weapons and firing them from a great distance. 

The Air Force is not ready to invest in a new generation of bombers, however.
Over the next decade or so, the Air Force will devote most of its aircraft
development dollars to the F-22 stealth fighter to replace the F-15 Strike Eagle
and the so-called Joint Strike Fighter to replace the F-16 Fighting Falcon. 

``Preserve what we have\'\' in bombers, is the way Air Force Secretary F. Whitten
Peters described the strategy yesterday. He and Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air
Force chief of staff, briefed reporters on a congressionally mandated ``white
paper\'\' on the future of the long-range bomber fleet. 

The upshot is that the B-52, along with the younger B-1B Lancer and the new
stealthy B-2 Spirit, will be kept around until approximately 2037, by which time
the Air Force calculates that attrition will have reduced the fleet below the
minimum 170 aircraft. The B-52s may fly to 2045. Planning for a replacement
bomber might start in 2013. 

There currently are 190 long-range bombers in the active fleet: 93 B-1s, 76 B-52s
and 21 B-2s. Only 130 of those planes are fully combat ready, however. The rest
are in various states of back-up readiness. 

Known officially as the Stratofortress, the B-52\'s crews affectionately call
it the
BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fellow). Its wingspan of 185 feet makes it wider than it is long
(159 feet), and it stands 40 feet high. With eight turbofan jet engines, it
can carry
70,000 pounds of bombs, missiles and other weapons and fly 8,800 miles before
refueling. 

The H model of the B-52 rolled off the Boeing Co. assembly lines at a cost of $9
million per plane, and the first one entered service May 9, 1961, with the 379th
Bomb Wing at Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Mich. Even taking decades of inflation
into account, that is a far cry from the $2 billion it cost to field the B-2.

We\'ve got the Famile Spofulam TL9 150 mm gun built, and she\'s reasonably
happy with it.

However, what is getting her really pissed off is the FS 120 mm Rapid Fire
Mass Driver, specifically the fact that the 120 mm HEAP warhead appears to
have a pentration value of about 500.

Can someone please calculate the DV of a 120 mm and a 150 mm HEAP round at
TL9 ?

OK. The FS 150 mm HVAP Smoothbore Gun. 

Consisting of a 9m long barrel, an autloader for the 50kg SEFOP
electro-thermal shells, an imaging radar for fire control and full
stabilisation, the FS 150mm is able to throw a shell every 70 seconds for a
power demand of 50 kilowatts.

The shells have a short range of 690 meters, for a DV of 202. The
penetration drops off with range, to 187 at Medium, 159 at Long and 103 at
Extreme range (I guess Medium is 1.4km, Long 2.8km and Extreme 5.6 km).

6.3 tons in mass all up and costing KCr 878, a loadout of 20 shells will
result in a total unit of 7.3t and KCr 898.

Note the weapon can be constructed at any TL9 world, so the cost in
Imperial Credits should be substantially lower.

It looks like a decent gun, but I think we need to do some thinking about
point defense - specifically, firing at incoming rounds.


****************************************************************************
******

The first effective point defense systems come in at TL7/8 for defense
against slow missiles. Too big for ground vehicles, they see service on wet
navy vessels.

At about TL9, point defense systems on ground vehicles usher in the end of
the Missile Era, although experiments are conducted with small fusion guns
mounted on drone grav missiles.

At TL10, point defense systems become effective enough to enable
counterfire against solid projectiles.

I think I see the problem.  For small arms, the penetration value of
HEAP rounds against armored targets is "the sum of muzzle energy and
explosive energy." [FF&Sv2, pp. 39-40]  However, this does not seem to
apply to large-caliber weapons.  For large- caliber HEAP rounds, the
penetration value is based on the diameter of the round, multiplied by a
TL-dependent modifier [Table 79, pg. 93].  (This constant penetration
value matches the premise in GDW games such as Twilight: 2000 and
Command Decision.  As I am not involved in the design and production of
shaped-charge rounds, I will assume that shaped-charge do, indeed,
display this trait.)  Assuming that the FS 120mm Rapid-Fire Mass Driver
and the FS 150mm CPR gun are both TL9, we get the following penetration
values:

120mm RFMD:	12 x 17.1 = 205.2
150mm CPR:	15 x 17.1 = 256.5

Skimming FF&Sv2, I don\'t find any stated rounding conventions, so you
may round as you see fit.

I hope that this helps reduce Ditzie\'s confusion.

See above.   (BTW, based on the fact that HEAP-type rounds hit a ceiling
of effectiveness at TL9, I would assume that all TL9 HEAP-type rounds
are actually SeFoP.)

I (sort of) disagree a little. There\'s a good case to be made,
especially for spacecraft and maybe aircraft, for skipping the low TLs,
at least in the "simplified" sequences. It\'s enormously hard to get
low TL stuff right (especially spacecraft), because they have razor-
thin performance margins and their capabilities are a strong function
of such things as life support mass or interior structure cost.
The amount of effort that would be spent letting you have a rules set
that can design the space shuttle - which few referees are likely to 
do - could much better be spent playtesting and tweaking the rules
for "real" spaceships.


(And I write that as a man who loves to do TL8-9 spaceship designs - 
but I\'m aware that my TL8 aerospaceplane bears no resemblence to
what we can really build, and I\'m not too heartbroken about it.)

I mean - yes, get the basics (rocket engine T/W and fuel consumption)
right but don\'t sweat the fine details.

I can\'t understand all of this Doom blasphemy.  : )  What 3-D games had you
played already (other than Wolfenstein 3-D) that satisfied your craving for
first-person shoot \'em up.  The only OTHER one I know of is "Seal Team",
which was based on an idea I submitted to Microprose back in the late 80\'s
when I had a C128.

(Speaking of which, I need to finish 2 1/2 more years of Vietnam in that
game...)

I\'d actually multiply the values for humans by 1.5 (four legged critters
usually can work harder because diaphragmatic work is reduced - dogs can
run for longer than men because of a sort of \'piston effect\' on their
ventilation).

Hamsters, rats , etc. are on the order of 250 to 500g (a morbidly obese
rat weighs just over a kg).

Go for it, Kenji ; I\'m keen to see a hamster driven walking starship!
Or is the PGMP-RP (rodent power variant) in the wings?

Ahh, Ian : you\'ve found the \'maintain compatibility with Striker\' bits.
And a pen value of 500 is pretty reasonable for a 12cm diameter armour
piercing round of FS type muzzle energies...

120mm HEAP :- Damage = (calibre)^2 X TL ammo fudge / warhead type fudge
= 144 X 0.29 / 1.5 = 27.84 -> 28

Burst radius = sqrt(damage) X weapon fudge/warhead type fudge

= sqrt(28)X 7/2.4 = ~15m

150mm HEAP :- 225 X 0.29/1.5 = 43.5
Burst radius = ~20m

I thought that the muzzle energy of the gun determined penetration and
the warhead type determined damage.

The formula :-

effective energy = muzzle energy + ([calibre/2] + TL - 7)^3

is a fudge to enhance penetration for HEAP over \'plain vanilla\' KEAP
rounds.

Ian, I assume that in the following quote :-

the initial DV is actually the penetration rating at short range.

Excuse me if I was unclear.  I meant "did nothing for" as he knew that
it would not have the proper effect on him because of his
age/boosterspice use; not "did nothing for" as did not tempt him.

	In at least some cases, the reason the table skips intermediate
levels is there ARE no intermediate values ... for example (IIRC)
jump drives took an extra TL to make one increase.  Generally, where
there\'s a smooth by-TL progression, all the TLs are represented in
the tables.

	Yep. Working on it.

Those images are owned by the current owner of 2300AD, Tantalus I believe.

I stand corrected.  Looking back at the tables, there weren\'t many that were
\'missing\' values, and those that were fit your explanation.  (I guess I
shouldn\'t stay up past my bedtime designing ships ;)

Okay, and does that mean that I can\'t duplicate them electronically for the

of having something attractive on my site for visitors?  (The robots.txt

Dave,

Mothballed ships WOULD suffer from things like vacuum welding, circuitry
degradation form free radiation, etc, oover the length of the Long
Night, so a general refit would probably be a good idea. However, I
would also assume that preservation techniques would also have advanced
by that time. ( to for stall others arguing the above points)

Most of the legacy ships IMTU have been in constant occupation, if not
actual use as ships. They have had repair crews in contiuous operation,
using stockpiled or recovered parts. Most of the ships DON\'T LOOK like
they did when the started, having had bits and peices grafted on as
needed. 

The Nomads still operation functioning ships are REALLY proud (almost
arrogant) types, with centuries of "racial" pride and a very deep
distrust of governments, stemming from the betrayal by the RoM that left
them to fend for themselves. But I digress form the subject.

I agree with you that there is no reason a ship, or rather it\'s hull and
frame can\'t last a LONG time. Upgrading internal systems would be where
a parent to child operations money and loans would come in.

Heck, in the Refinery I work in we\'re using a fair number of machines
(pumps, compressors, etc.) built in the \'30\'s. Every time we talk about
replaceing them the cost vs gain numbers just don\'t make it. They do
their job and the incremental increases in effecency aren\'t cost
effective when up-grades to the existing equipment is factored in.

        <leaping into evolving gun fight>
        Hi, Cliff...  Take a look at my website (see URL below)...  I am
doing the exact same thing you are talking about.  I just have the standard
"legalese" disclaimer on the pages containing "copyright-questionable"
stuff, a plain-english explanation of *why* I have the images there and that
I am *not* trying to piss anyone off and I sent Marc a courtesy e-mail
inviting him to drop by the site.
        No grief.
        Another good idea is to put a *link* back to the (in your case)
Tantalus website on the pages containing the cool artwork or quoted
information...  that\'s free advertising for Tantalus, and they\'d be idiots
to jump up and down on you for it.
        The biggest rules of thumb are "give credit where credit is due" and
"don\'t make a buck".  If you know where it comes from, then say so.  If you
are putting it up for "hobby" and not charging people to play in your PBEM,
then you are most times safe.

>  Not for the purpose
>of having something attractive on my site for visitors?  (The robots.txt
>file was supposed to tip you off that there would be NO visitors to the
>site.)  

        I didn\'t even bother with that...  my site, including "borrowed"
images and text, is fully indexed by every engine I could find.  =)  Again,
what most folks care about is wether or not you are claiming the work is
yours, and if you are making a buck off of it and not giving them thier fair
cut.

>Are you saying that I am supposed to tell each of my players to buy
>2300AD just so they can see what it is their character would be buying?

        Nope...  OTOH, you could *e-mail* the images to folks and not have
it on the site at all.  Or, make a "gear pics" page that is not linked
directly to other of the pages on your site and only pass the URL out to
your players.   It avoids the issue entirely that way...  just be sure your
players know it is for "private" consumption only.

That\'s OK if you know or can control what browser your visitors
are using.  Not everyone uses Nutscrape or Infernal Exploder,
yet; there\'s still quite a bit of Lynx out there, believe it or
not - not to mention the less-capable browsers, like Opera and
Mosaic.  A server-side solution can work for all browsers.

   I agree with your sediment that 2300AD is a great game in itself.  
However wouldn\'t you want to open up the game to a wider audience?  My 
earlier modest contrabution is hoping that an independent company would 
pick up the gauntlet and run with it.  I admit my timeline borrows too 
heavily but the net benefit to both games would be to make a realistic 
game history for a lot of Traveller and 2300AD players who have become 
"collectors".  With the rights to each Traveller and 2300AD owned by 
others it is unlikely a fusion will occur unless fans start to push.

They have communicated with the 2300 list and the future for 2300 is not as
dark as it once seemed.
While the game may not be republished, they may create an official web
presence for it in the near future.
At this point, it is wise to let the 2300 owners set their own pace and

We even have a mailing list to discuss the future of 2300 and such if anyone

(and I HAVE to get it finished today and get a few dozen pictures cranked
out).  My question is this:  Given the fact that as shown on those plans
that the thickness of the ship is correct, does have a problem with the
landing gear set up so that the ground level is closer to parallel with the
outline of the ship\'s hull when landed?  This would require the ship to come
in for a landing and rotate a little past parallel to the ground to get all
the landing pads down.  I tried it with keeping the centerline of the ship
parallel to the ground and it just looks HORRIBLE!!!  Not to mention the
fact that the struts have to be really close to the centerline....

Unfortunately, after looking at the Sulieman in G:T it isn\'t the scouts
of old. In fact it is quite a bit "thicker" than the original design
from CT days. My advice would be to have it sit in a "nose down" config
and assume that internal gravity makes it seem level once your inside.
That or shave a deck off of it and make it the sleek little ship it used
to be.

While the first person part is optional (multiple camera views),
Blue Byte\'s Incubation wins hands down.  Turn based, 3D, science
fiction squad level combat.  It\'s only down side is that it isn\'t
as configurable as Quake2.  (Otherwise, it would make a damn
nifty graphical component to most PBEM gaming.  [Yes, it has a
play by e-mail mode.])

One of my pet projects is to convert Shogo into a customizable
turn based battle engine.

I got a copy of HG1 this weekend, which has some interesting bits on
targeting and manuevering.

- - you can try and break through a line of battle (to break a blockade). If
you can maintain close range for 4 consecutive turns you succeed. Infering
from the rules, the reserves (the screened ships) would then be the Line of
Battle...

- - there are targeting limits at short range - you can only fire on ships
that fire at you. If you aren\'t fired on you can pick your target.

Finally, some hints to HGs link back to Imperium.

- - High Intensity Missile fire may be performed - +4 DM, may only be
performed once and expends all missiles.

I prefer a submarine like model (or dreadnaught type model) to the Star

The shot was a golden BB - if you planted the warhead on board by hand,
you\'d be pressed to do more damage. Then again, the Type 42 wasn\'t
equipped with a close-in weapon system (CIWS), although it did have an
ECM suite.

At the time, SHEFFIELD was operating her SCOT satellite communications
gear, which interfered with her ECM and ESM gear. The Exocet was picked
up by other ships; and later in the conflict one of SHEFFIELD\'s sister
ships (EXETER) got clear warning of an exocet attack from her ESM gear.

Yep.

Gun-based CIWS isn\'t that effective against supersonic seaskimmers;
which is why the USN is moving towards RAM (Rolling-airframe missile)
for point defence. IMHO, the best deals out there are the Russian CADS-
N-1 combined rotary cannon and missile point-defence mounts.

Sounds counter-intuitive, since KE rounds will penetrate more armour

Well you could try it with a LONG nose gear strut and very short main gear

Well, if one accepts the premise that the TL of the RoM was over TL12
(I\'m not trying to reopen that debate; just bear with me a minute), that
can lead to some very entertaining pirate encounters.  After all, the
idea that a pirate ship may have a TL 2 or 3 levels higher than anything
to which the PCs have access can really up the pucker factor....

Right now Rob Miracle who works for the current Copyright holder, Tantalus,
is working to creat a domain name for an on-line 3rd edition of 2300ad, i.e
2300AD.com, that members of the 2300ad mailing list are currently debating
format and extent of the coming revision. Currently there is a move to
revise the Near Star list with current Hipparcos data which will
significantly change the stellar geography and as a result the future
history leading up to the game or merely tweaking with the NSL and 23AD
future history as we know it. Join the mailing list at www.onelist.com,
you\'d be surprised how much work we have done. There will be a 3rd edition
either hosted by Tantalus, or us, on a web-site moderated and created by
us, the list members and their guests,  or one  hosted at one of the many
personal websites. Your input is needed for this great project. Most of us
will run either the very revised 2300ad and the slighty tweaked 2300ad
concurrently. At lot of work has gone into revising and repairing the
existing game: Star Cruiser Lite, Star Cruiser2, stellar cartagraphy comp
programs, character gen programs, discrepancy corrections between canon
(genuflect) products i.e. rudell units, population, stutterwarp discharge
rates, throwing distance, chronology discrepancies, etc. Just posting the
errata has taken years to compile.  There are hundreds of weapons, dozens
of starhips, equipment beyond counting, military, social, and
political/economic histories of just about every major player in 23AD and
our coming Great GameII, corporationss, Orders of Battles, there is just
too much to list here, afterall, the Equipment List 2 on one site has over
100 pieces of equipment ranging from space naval  mines to portacomps.
There are also people\'s own campaign milieu, for example "2100AD", "2087",
"Earthspace", set in the E21. Many of these people don\'t participate in the
TML or in other Traveller venues, so may be unaware of those of us on the
TML who have 21st century campaigns in the Traveller Universe. I shouldn\'t
say reinventing the wheel, as your efforts are not in vain, but may be
operating in a partial vacuum. There is much to be learned and
\'borrowed/stolen\' from both lists!

No, that\'s either the Ares FMG or the H&K MP-5 briefcase adaptation.

The P90 was designed to be issued to all those troops who *aren\'t* direct
combat infantry.. tankers, artillery, support types.  It\'s a compact,
effective weapon that doesn\'t encumber the soldier as much as a long rifle
would.

The real masterpiece of design was the 50 round magazine that is place
along the top of the barrel.  Really cuts down on weapon bulk, and allows
the weapon to be carried in an oversized holster.

Interesting idea. I\'m using GURPS Vehicles and G:T to design some non-
standard missiles at GURPS TL 12.  Basically I\'m working on a fire and
forget missile that will allow a gunner to program the missile to reach a
specific area (hex) then the targeting computer in the missile will take
over and lock-on a target using a radscanner or radar receiver (like an ARM
missile).  I intended to limit them to Imperial Navy, (and perhaps the other
major interstellar TL 12 governments).

I\'m trying to find a good defense against fighters, since I don\'t like\'em.
Also I believe that the Imperial Navy wouldn\'t have gone with battle-riders
over fighter unless there existed a weapon that made large squadrons of
fighters less of a threat. This would relegate the fighter to a planetary
support and escort roll.

You may have been thinking of the USS Stark, an American frigate which had

Book 6 Scouts, pages 47-50 give some guidence in deveploing detail in an
atmosphere, but leave a lot of how to present that in play.

World Builders Handbook, pages 64-71 again give guidence, again with lots
of scope for personalisation. A significant note is in section 9, page 71.
Weather Control : May be introduced at TL8, in short there\'s permission to
fudge (till the virus).

If you want anything beyond general info i.e. length and average intensity
of seasons, planetary averages of temprature and atmospheric interacction.
For localised weather both systems (IMHO) require extra work by :
        inventive hand waving,
        indepth study of meterology, or
        resort to additional tables and data.

On the concept of \'a habital world\' as I\'m unaware of how \'habital a world\'
you are trying to generate, please accept (again IMHO) that a randomly
generated world with weather and topography akin to Long Beach with
occasional Tahiatian islands for variety, is uncommon. Most of worlds I\'ve
detailed while in planetary systems habital zones have less than friendly
environments. These have helped to provide (usualy ignored) background for
story telling and scene setting.

Anyone with other info to add?

OK. Unless we\'re reading something wrong, a 120 mm Gauss Gun round will
mass 30 kilos.

Accelerating it to 4000 meters per second (a nice round number for a TL9
peaceful magnetic device) demands 0.216 MJ according to FFS2 p45  (30
kg*4000 ms^-2/2 000 000, *3.6 tech efficiency).

Now, if k=1/2*m*v^2, then the rounds kinetic energy is about 15 * 16
million joules, or call it a rough 240 million joules.

Now, unless Accounting have been let loose on the Law of Conservation of
Energy (a possibility Ditzie is not, at this point, prepared to discount),
something is very badly wrong.

There\'s a picture of a scoutship on the cover of a MT manual (Referee\'s

at the rear tends to displace things oddly and dorsal ridge becomes the level

NOTE: for all of you who do not know what it is, POV-Ray is an extremely
capable 3-D raytracing program, but it does NOT include a modeller. for
that you\'ll need other programs.

Two nice 3-D programs that do do raytracing (for the Mac) are:

StrataVision 3D 4.0 ($10 s/h from Stata www.strata3d.com) a gimme to
entice you to upgrade to their current version.

Pixels 3D 2.1.4, a free download from www.pixels3d.com, plus a 6mb PDF
download of the manual. You have to register it to keep a nag notice
away, but the registration\'s free (except for the telemarketing to get
you to upgrade to _their_ current product)

I would probably argue against this. This means that if artificial gravity
goes off - for example, if you have to take it off-line for repairs - the
deck now slants.

I would actually try to go back to the older, thinner Sulieman if you can...

However, just because it\'s stupid, doesn\'t mean a contractor wouldn\'t

Ex-coast guard friend of mine pointed out a major reason why that freighter was

Cinema4D GO is fairly cheap and comes with a CD full of spaceships,

Okay, but what I want to know is what makes this weapon LESS effective than
a non-bullpup assault rifle?  Why wouldn\'t standard infantry carry it?  The
barrel seems to almost go all of the way back to the butt, so it has
considerable length.

The H&K G-11 did that, first.  It just didn\'t put its main action far enough
back in the stock.  Whoever designed this thing REALLY made use of all good
ideas and even improved them, finally coming up with some ideas of their
own, like making the foregrip the same as the handguard.

[snip]

SEFOP rounds should have a constant penetration and DV across their range.
They are a SElf FOrging Projectile, which means, essentially, that the
shell is just the "bus" that delivers the warhead to the vicinity of the
target.  Once nearby, a sensor in the shell triggers a shaped charge
(usually pointing "down" onto the top of the target vehicle) which, in
turn, has a copper (or other) "disk" in front of it.  The force of the
explosion, the nature of the disk material, and some handy laws of physics
turn the disk into a projectile similar to a long rod penetrator capable of
doing significant damage.

It\'s a good armor-defeating round, as long as it isn\'t shot at by active
defenses.  The U.S. Army is delivering the XM-943 STAFF (Smart Target
Activated Fire and Forget) top-attack round which actually has some target
seeking capability and uses a SEFOP penetrator once it reaches the target.
Of course, the usual budget issues cause the STAFF round to face possible
cancellation.

See what you learn by playing computer games (i.e.M1 Tank Platoon II).

The advantage to an ever-expanding document is that ships can be added

(eg. into civilian and ,military books) at a future date.

The advantage of releasing a series of documents is that those who print
the book won\'t have to reprint the whole thing every time there\'s a change.

I think that submarines are too stealthy to serve as a model for
Traveller space combat. Skimmers, on the other hand, are probably about
right.

I would personally prefer the single document, with periodic updates.

Definitely!

I think so.  With so many rulesets in use, and die-hard users in each,
making more versions available can only increase the audience for such a
document.  Unless you can get large percentages of conversions for other
versions, it might be easier to simply include them in a single book.

Some people have mailed in using html mode, which generates the
multi-part messages.

In Netscape (which I use) these are handled in the Preferences -> Mail
and Groups section. (both Mac and PC) Go to Edit > Preferences, and
click on the plus next to Mail and Groups to expand it. Both of these
features are set in the Messages option.

Un-check \'Send HTML Mail by default\'. This is checked on a default
installation.

Right underneath that is an option to set your message line lengths. It
defaults to checked and 72 characters in my setup (netscape communicator
4.06)

Quake 1 is out for the Mac, and I believe some new version is due soon.
Unreal is out but is sick on its system resources. The port from Windows
shows to an extent. For Mac Software to ask for 90+ Mb RAM *or* 32Mb RAM
and 90 Mb Virtual Memory is something unheard of...

I \'sort of\' run it on a PowerMac 6400 (200MHz 603e) with 56Mb RAM and 90 Mb
Virtual on, Basic 1Mb VRAM and no hardware acceleration. Slows down really
badly in combat, and update rate is slow.

Marathon screams in comparison, but that\'s not surprising.

You mean a glow, kind of like the Millenium Falcon or the Starship Troopers

example, the Sulieman has a hatch between the two drives).

No, it would. Plasma is *hot*. The implications are nasty in an atmosphere
or a confined space. Plasma arc cutters can be in excess of 15,000 deg C
IIRC (certainly hotter than the surface of Sol). Dump a lot of this in an
atmosphere and you get instant drying of the air, and effects with water
vapour. Loads of clouds of condensation, and I would suspect a heat
generated shock wave. Think of a localised, directed nuke... perhaps Shadow
or one of the others could provide a better description... You don\'t need a
giant plume to cause problems with source material. The output from a
shuttle SRB is probably cooler, and throws out more combustion byproducts,
but look at the clouds of water vapour and heat it generates.

Thats a fair point. I don\'t mind HEPLaR, but my problems are with the
official killing of T-plates. I mean, you could just have easily handwaved
that T-plates are limited to 6G max, and keep HEPLaR unlimited. The cost
and solidity of HEPLaR would make it ideal for the RC - indeed, it could be
a distinction of Virus and the Regency.

Scenario idea - an RCES team encounters a T-Plate Sulieman, and destroys
it. Unknown to them, it is a deep contact Regency Scout....

There is a slight difference in scale between any of the military ships the

ISTR that you could get a shareware version of Quake much the same way that

RN Ships Lost
- ----

1) HMS Sheffield	Type 42 Guided Missile Destroyer - 4 May 1982
Cause - Exocet Hit, warhead did not detonate but started fire. Sheffield\'s
fire main was ruptured, and pumps out. Abandoned when fire became
uncontrolable. Fire burned out 5 May. Taken under tow, but capsized in bad
weather and sank.

2) HMS Ardent 	Type 21 ASW Frigate -  21 May 1982
Cause - Hit by at least 4 (detonating)  500lb bombs, plus rockets, and sank.

3) HMS Antelope	Type 21 ASW Frigate - 23 May 1982
Cause - hit by multiple 500lb bombs, sinks 24 May when unexploded bomb
being defused detonated exploding magazine.

4) HMS Coventry	Type 42 Guided Missile Destroyer - 25 May 1982
Cause - 3 500lb bombs hit port side of ship and exploded, mortally wounding
the ship. HMS Broadsword also damaged.

5) RFA Sir Tristram and RFA Sir Galahad - 7 June 1982
Cause - Multiple bomb hits.

Other British ships lost -

a) Atlantic Conveyor - Exocet

Other ships Damaged

b) HMS Antrim
c) HMS Broadsword
d) HMS Plymouth

The ship was a destroyer, not a frigate. Primary role is AA, but has a

She sank under tow in bad weather when they wanted to refit her in the UK.

The big Sheffield and Coventry had steel Hulls (the superstructure could
have been part aluminium). They were Type 42\'s, which were basically cut
down Type 81s (HMS Bristol). The aluminium problem was found with the Type
21 frigates (Ardent and Antelope), which were predominantly aluminium.
Sheffield\'s fire systems where down after the hit.

IIRC her air search radar was off at the time, and she was discussing with
Coventry (another Type 42 in the screen) how to handle ghost images. She
was watching radar images relayed from the carrier HMS Hermes some twenty
nautical miles away from the direction of the attack. ISTR this gave them
something like 10-20 seconds warning?

There wasn\'t a CIWS, but I believe there was an ECM suite and a chaff
dispenser. But because the air search radar was off they didn\'t see the
Exocet.

Additionally, thanks to political inspired cuts, ISTR the 42\'s only have
one fore-aft corridor (IIRC) and are quite cramped. These were the same
cuts that lead to the RN sneaking the Invincible through as a \'through-deck
ASW Cruiser\', not a carrier.

I know the CIWS/Goalkeeper was installed.

The AEW helo took the axed Nimrod AEW (Searchwater?) Radar and mounted it
on a Sea King. One of my friends (ex Type 42) told me that they managed to
get these up in weather which precluded launches from one of the US
carriers in a NATO exercise.

> It\'s a pity that the RN got rid of the first Ark Royal.

Ahem. There have been a number of Ark Royals. I can think of three this
century off the top of my head.

Carrier Sunk in WWII.
Carrier Scrapped late 70s
Carrier in service now

I seem to recall that there have been a number before this.

Also, I saw a programme a while ago which mentioned that they were
developing the equivalent of MIRVs for normal missiles.

Inspiration for the desert part was from Dune, the \'Harkonnens\'
reference nails it. The Harkonnen\'s were the Atriedes great enemy, who
got them exiled to Dune in the first place.

Actually, the web will do the trick, if you know where to look;

from http://www.uss-salem.org/navhist/cruisers/ca-cl1.htm, Andrew Toppan\'s
excellent Naval History web site (and of course, web site to the neat-o and
nearby [to me] U.S.S. Salem museum);


CL 40   Brooklyn
        Built by New York Navy.  Laid down 12 March 1935, launched
        30 Nov 1936, commissioned 30 Sept 1937.  Decommissioned 30 Jan 1946,
        to Chile as O\'Higgins 9 Jan 1951, stricken 22 Jan 1951.
        Damaged by grounding 12 Aug 1975, used as stationary accomodations
        ship, refitted 1977-1978, recommissioned.  Decomissioned 14 Jan 1992,
        sunk 3 Nov 1992 under tow to India for scrapping.


Peru seems to have kept one of theirs;


Aguirre (De Ruyter class) helicopter cruiser

Displacement: 12,250 tons full load
[snip for space]
Armament:... 1 dual 152mm/52, 3 dual 57mm/80 DP...[snip]
CH 84   Aguirre    1953/76        Ex-De Zeven Provincien


Which means that Peru has the biggest "big guns" afloat to this day, unless
they\'ve decommissioned her by now (Andrew Toppan is well known for keeping
up with such things).

Note that Iowa and New Jersey are currently in "reserve" status.  They are
unlikely to ever be recommissioned, however, and are on the reserve list
for political reasons, not practical ones.  I think this may be because, if
they are donated for museum use, the Navy will then be "allowed" to tow the
ship to its final destination (New Jersey->New Jersey, Iowa to ???
(certainly not Iowa - unless contragrav is invented)).

OBTRAV: I bet the predecessor to the Tigress is in "permanent orbit"
somewhere as a museum ship.  What would it take to recommission such a
ship?  Would it be worth it?  Current experience says absolutely not, but
then again maybe space is a less harsh mistress than the sea to the vessels
which sail her.

On the other hand, how about just a plot to seize her and activate her main
weaponry just once at a major population center?  Sounds like a good use
for those AHL deckplans...

There is also a big difference between a five inch shell and an Exocet.

This reminds me of another good point that I was to busy to bring up
earlier.  Missiles, like the Exocet are frightningly fast and deadly, much
like some of the little units that have been discussed on this list, lately.
But I saw some footage of the Falklands battles, and in one of them I
watched a Phalanx system shred an incoming missile just seconds before it
would have hit the ship.  Most of the missile debris landed in the water
close to the ship, with some smaller shrapnel actually hitting it.

ObTrav: Is there a Phalanx system available for my little prirate buddies?
Wouldn\'t the SDBs be surprised!

I kinda like the single document, but maybe an "update document" could be
made that includes only the altered pages. Adobe Acrobat can print out
single pages, and those could then be substituted for the pages in a binder
or something.

I would like to see more modules, especially for TL 9 ships :) I know
STARSHIPS is going to have that, but if it\'s "unofficial" anyway, why not?

If you\'re going to do 101 Starships for other systems (CT, MT etc.) I
reccomend separate documents; then those who have no use for the GT stats
don\'t have to print them out too.

Extra material is ok, especially optional rules.

The usefulness of the ships is vastly improved, if the stats in different
formats are published at the same time.

Nope. What we don\'t want is a QSDS which is basically a list of FFS tables.
Make it abstract and approximate the values (if necessary). Let FFS3 be the
design system where you can tweak and shave. I can design a HG ship in less
than 30 min. QSDS took twice that *until* I got Rob Prior\'s Mac Software
Version which takes 5 minutes...

Be careful with those comments on HG, oh heretic!

IMO

G:T encourages people to buy Gurps Basic, Compendium, Space, Ultra Tech,
Vehicles...

Once you have all the Gurps stuff, you might want to use Gurps for
Fantasy, Cyberpunk and lots of other stuff (ie more book sales).

Selling T5 would separate the G:T stuff from the rest of Gurps
and reduce the number of Gurps converts it makes.

Has anyone on this list ever follishly try to render the known universe
in 3d as opposed to 2D?
</Foy Family>

There have been a couple of attempts to take the official Traveller
universe maps and make them 3D.  IIRC, someone tried it with the stars
surrounding Terra, trying to get them to match real distances and
canonical distance as closely as possible.  Anyone remember who that was?
It\'s possible my description of the attempt is way off...

<Foy Family>
I posted on the TML years ago my theory ( "which is my theory, is mine"
Mizzz Anne Elk) that space is three dimensional but the 2d universe of
Travller is what the Universe looks to our primitive monkey-minds while
interpreting JUMPSPACE. Going sub-light or near super-luminal would get
you somewhere else if you left one hex/ star system to go to another. In
Jumpspace a J-1 gets you to Prometheus  on the subsector map, but if you
left in a daedelus-type ship you\'d be going the wrong direction and
destination  if you followed Jump navigation exit vertices.
</Foy Family>

Ya, I\'ve always liked that one.  The only problem is that it doesn\'t jibe
with some canonical references (assuming you care about such stuff) to
sublight ships travelling, for example, from earth to the Marches.  Of
course, if you assume that there is a relatively close relation between
the 3d "real" universe and the 2d "jump"  universe, this is largely
alleviated.  

For my own part, what I\'ve toyed with (though never actually used in
Traveller itself) is the idea of keeping the standard 8 x 10 subsector map
and then giving each star a Z-coordinate from 1 to 8, thus making it
8x8x10. The Z value is just listed in the middle of the star\'s little
circular symbol.  

Figuring out a travel distance is simple: You just count the number of
hexes from departure to destination on the map and then subtract their
Z-coordinates to get the vertical separation.  These numbers are either
plugged into the pythagorean formula (D=sqrt(A^2+B^2)), or you can make up
a little 6x6 table with all the appropriate values in it, like so: 

	1          2          3          4          5          6

1	1.4142     2.2361     3.1623     4.1231     5.0990     6.0828
2	2.2361     2.8284     3.6056     4.4721     5.3852     6.3246
3	3.1623     3.6056     4.2426          5      5.831     6.7082
4	4.1231     4.4721          5     5.6569     6.4031     7.2111
5	5.0990     5.3852     5.8310     6.4031     7.0711     7.8102
6	6.0828     6.3246     6.7082     7.2111     7.8102     8.4853

You can either round the values up to determine what rating of jump drive
you need to reach a given destination, reasoning that the jump number is
the absolute upper limit of a jump drive\'s range (and it\'s going to take a
long time to travel even .0828 parsecs through normal space) in which case
travel distances are:

    1  2  3  4  5  6

1   2  3  4  5  6  7
2   3  3  4  5  6  7
3   4  4  5  5  6  7
4   5  5  5  6  7  8
5   6  6  6  7  8  8
6   7  7  7  8  8  9

or you can round off, reasoning that jump drives can actually go up to .5
parsecs further than listed.  Travel distances are then:

    1  2  3  4  5  6

1   1  2  3  4  5  6
2   2  3  4  4  5  6
3   3  4  4  5  6  7
4   4  4  5  6  6  7
5   5  5  6  6  7  8
6   6  6  7  7  8  8

If multiple stars share the same hex (i.e., are "on top" of each other),
you have to split it up to list them, but this isn\'t a big problem.  I did
this for one of my own SFRPG systems and it worked very well. 

This system is much easier (IMHO) for most players and refs to visualize
and use than many systems which either don\'t use any sort of grid or which
use decimal values of X, Y and Z coordinates.  

BTW, in case you don\'t know, there\'s _alot_ of stuff on the web about 3D
star mapping.  Some of it is very beautiful, though I have doubts about
its utility for (non-computerized) RPGs.

Time to expand your starport modules!

According to MSNBC, the US Govt has approved
the initial launch by Sea Launch. For those
of you unfamiliar with the story, Sea Launch,
an international consortium that includes the
Seattle-based Boeing Co. as a 40 percent partner,
will use a Ukrainian-built booster rocket and
a Russian-built upper stage for an unmanned
demonstration launch in the Pacific Ocean. 
Liftoff is scheduled for 5:18 p.m. ET March 26.

The launch platform is a converted self-propelled
oil-drilling platform. The rockets are to be
transported to the launch site, about 1,400 miles
south of Hawaii, and controlled afterward from a
separate assembly and command ship.

who are attempting to land on any world with
a Hydro rating of 9+. Imagine trying to land a

This is also a good reason to separate a crew
from their ship; their pilot simply may not be
good enough to meet local Traffic Control 
regulations covering at-sea starport landings.
They can either pay cargo shipment costs to/from
orbit or pay for an interface shuttle.

Or force them to use the equivalent of a harbor
pilot, allowing for additional costs or even
a way to board a hijack/terrorist/repo team.

You make it _extremely_ reflective, and guide it with a magnetic field. 
Incidentally, plasma guns are probably actually kinetic penetrators, not
thermal penetrators.

Ark Royal (1) - Served in Elizabeth I\'s navy during the Armarda.
Ark Royal (2) - The first dedicated RN seaplane carrier. Originally a collier
     purchased on the stocks in 1912, the modifications amounted a rebuild
     from the keel up. Served during the 1st WW. Renamed Pegasus in 1934
     to free up the name for a new carrier. Served as a convoy escort in the
     2nd WW. Sold 1949, broken up 1950.
Ark Royal (3) - First purpose built RN carrier since the experimental Hermes.
     Commissioned 1938, sunk bu U 41 1941
Ark Royal (4) - Laid down in 1942 as a followup to the Indomitable\'s. Her
     completion was delayed by the end of the 2nd WW. Commissioned in
     1955 to a heavily modified design. Scheduled for decommissioning in 1975
     but kept in service by cannibalising Eagle (her semi sister). Finally
     decommisioned in 1979 and broken up in 1980
Ark Royal (5) - An Invincible class CVAS (attack antisubmarine carrier).
     Commissioned in 1983(?). Currently laid up pending refit due to lack of
     funds

And now from my IW notes

Ark Royal (6) - Last RN carrier. Built during the 21st Century.
Ark Royal (7) - One of the first Terran Confederation Missile Boat Tenders.
     Built by the European Union after first contact. Served during the 1st and
     2nd Interstellar Wars.
Ark Royal (8) - Missile Boat Tender. Served during the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th
     Interstellar Wars. Lost at Apishal in 2239.
Ark Royal (9) - Meson gun armed Battlecruiser. Served in the 9th and Nth
     Interstellar Wars. Lost during the RoM.

I hadn\'t noticed that come.to was down that often; I check it
sporadically, and I\'ve never been disappointed.

Certainly, subdomains of the form *.downport.com are highly
desirable; in fact, I think when I was invited aboard, I
mentioned that as a suggestion for a future possibility.  The
benefit of a come.to-type redirecting URL is in many ways similar
to having an email address at HotMail, iName, Juno, Deja News,
and so on - if, for some reason, your physical location is
subject to disappearance at any moment (such as has happened
several times to Freelance Traveller - but hopefully no more),
one does not have to chase down everyone that has one\'s URL and
tell them to change it.  Instead, give out the redirector URL,
and if the real URL changes, just have come.to re-point the URL,
and you\'re fine - nobody needs to know that you\'re elsewhere.
Now that I\'m with Downport, I give out both URLs, and intend to
continue doing so, for those reasons, and because the come.to
URLs are so memorable.  I\'m not ashamed (far from it!) of being
associated with Downport; but I do recognize the value of
memorable names and URLs.  If I was willing to spend more cash on
Freelance Traveller, I\'d be buying FreelanceTraveller.com, and
looking for someone to host it.  But, in my estimation, domain
hosting services cost more than I am currently willing to spend,
so the dream remains a dream for the time being.  The URL itself
(i.e., the interNIC registration) is a trivial cost; if I could
get a free permanent T1 or better, and a powerful enough machine,
also for free, I\'d set up FreelanceTraveller.com before you could
say it - because it\'s "marketing".  Were I not beaten to the
punch, and had the same resources as Downport, I\'d probably have
tried for Traveller.com, or perhaps TravellerRPG.com, as the host
domain for Traveller sites (of course, subject to approval from
Marc; those are domain names that I think he has a legitimate
moral first claim on).  Marketing is also why I chose the name
"Freelance Traveller" for the site; it identifies the entire
mindset nearly perfectly, preserves the association with
Traveller while not asserting officialness, and has that "feel"
of adventure that is suggested by the term "freelance" (from
"free lance", a medieval knight not bound to a lord - one who
could sell his services).  And the same kind of logic is followed
with respect to some of the section names - and to the V3 URL.
Think of your domain name and website URL as advertising, both
for your site and for the topic that your site is about.  \'Cause
it _is_.

Hey Rob,

Where is the Beanstalk? I\'dthink that there would be a lot of medium and
high tech worlds, in particular the high-pop ones that would use some
type of beanstalk rather than have multi-mega-ton star ships flying over
their heads.

 The rear struts ARE pretty close to centerline as I recall, but since the
Sulieman is THREE stories tall at the rear (not the FIVE story monster
depicted in G:T), there is plenty of room in the ventral spaces. The front
jack also has a fair amount of room to originate from.
 As for the ship being level when parked, I suspect that the jacks in later
models (True Trav TL of 12+) are probably adaptable to local conditions,
so the ship can have whatever level it needs to have relative to the ground.

 The only grounded Scouts that I found in my first look is the aft view
on page 34 of JTAS#5, and page 87 in the MT Imperial Encyclopedia (a top
down shot). I\'m sure there was at least one such picture in the
DGP stuff, but I\'ll have to dig.
 The pic on page 93 of the MT Rebellion Sourcebook is actually a Gazelle\'s
Gig, but the basic lines are similar.

Is there something wrong with liking GURPS? I\'ve played it since it first
came out, and enjoy it a lot. You might not; that\'s your choice. Steve
Jackson Games is a COMPANY. They have to make money, or they go under. So
yes, they want to sell books. Lots of books. So did GDW and every other game
company that has ever existed.

This comment also presupposes that a person would a.) suddenly get
interested in playing other genres just because of GURPS and b.) decide to
drop whatever system they\'re using in favor of GURPS. This does not
neccesarily follow, although I\'m sure SJG wouldn\'t complain if it did.
I, for instance, as much as I like GURPS, will not use it for superheroes
(because I think Champions is superior in that genre), or Star Trek (the
Last Unicorn game works well for that). I do use it for Traveller because,
frankly, it does what I want to do for Traveller better than any version of
the game I have yet seen. Note I said what I want to do; this might not
apply to others.

GURPS Traveller is doing the Traveller community a service, even those who
do not choose to buy it; it is demonstrating that there is still commercial
viability in Traveller, a fact that may have been in doubt in a lot of minds
after the IG fiasco. It is very likely that if GT failed, there would be no
T5. It\'s existence and success means there very likely will be.

I always liked the idea of redoin HG, but with all the components
built under a common system (so you could add on new stuff). HG+
would abstract anything that can be expressed in terms of total ship
tonnage.

For example we know the fuel and jump can be ballparked this way.
You can also set abstract standards for crew quarters, control, etc.
HG still deals with weapons on a weapon by weapon bvasis, so that
and defenses are tables of completed FFS systems. There might be
other simplifications.

Dear Sir:

It has come to our attention that you have a custom order for our
starport construction division. We thank you for your interest in our
module starport product, and eagerly await your catalog picks.  As
you know, our company eschews discrimination against any sapient
aliens, especially Terrans, and we are happy to work with all manner
of government and military advisors, as our product specifications
have machinings fine enough to satisfy even most hidebound of our
own Zirkuurum quantum meson protractor crew.

However, we regret to inform you that that particular item does not
appear in our catalog; sadly, we do not consider such a device
feasible or marketable, though it has shown promise in the past and
has many supporters among various research agencies.  Should we
deem it necessary in the future, you can be assured that we will
include such a device in our product list.  Until then you may have
to find a special order contractor with which to build your custom
components.

Sincerely,
IIguraaskaan Raab

The Ares FMG is a SMG designed to fold into a compact, smooth shape for use

The weapon is *very* short.  So it isn\'t very accurate beyond about 50m.
You really need about 100cm of barrel (using current technology) to get any
real accuracy at the ranges you need.

The G-11 had a conventional magazine just to the rear of the trigger
assembly, loaded from the bottom of the rifle.  What made the G-11
revolutionary was that it used caseless ammo.

If you\'re referring to the font that was used for the cover/title
page (the word TRAVELLER), look for anything with one of the
following names:

Optima
Optim
Opta
Zapf Humanist

If you\'re referring to the body text font, it\'s a close match
for:

Arial
Helvetica

but a better one for

Aksidenz Grotesk
Sage
Standard

Alternatively, email me a GIF with a closeup, and I\'ll see if I
can find a match.

No, sir.  Maybe there was an earlier design that did that, but everyone G-11
I\'ve ever seen pictures of, the magazine inserts by sliding it rearward
along the top of the barrel, bullet noses down.  They are then in position
to slide nose down into a cartwheel sort of chamber, which then turns 90
degrees so that the round is now pointing down the barrel.  The next 1/4
turn of the cartwheel accepts the next round in the opposite direction that
it accepted the first round.  This, as far as I know, novel design is one
reason the G-11 has such a high rate of fire and can put 3 rounds out of the
barrel before the muzzle flips.  (I\'m not sure, but the cartwheeling action
may actually work against muzzle flip.)

The solid propellant surrounding the rounds is a square cross-section, so
that the rounds are stacked Tetris-style and in a single file along the
stick magazine.  The designers believed that, despite the flat surfaces
against the walls of the magazine, the squarish design of the rounds would
reduce the friction working on a casing from multiple directions, as with a
staggered magazine of cylindrical cases.  The magazine is a 50 rounder.  I
don\'t know where that is supposed to be behind the trigger assembly, as
nothing is showing.

I\'ve devoured anything I could find on the gun ever since I read about it in
the Q Manual for the JB 007 RPG (in which Q relates that one of the double
O\'s likes to hang upside down from a helicopter nailing targets, since he
doesn\'t have to worry about casings in his face).  I\'m not sure, but the
manual might have said that the thing could float.

It was one of the four in the Army ACR testing, which was conducted while I
was in, around \'88 or \'89.

Something I read later seemed to say that it looked like the Army was going
to go with the Colt-based flechette spitter.  Political wisdom but selection
idiocy, in my opinion.  If the G-11 actually works (I say this because I
heard that they have a problem with the ammo when it gets wet) then I can\'t
understand why they wouldn\'t use it.  Face it, the Germans know how to make
some good guns.  Americans seem more concerned with sticking to Cowboy
companies...

articles and reports that appeared in various magazines and such, the

replacement for the presently fielded M16A2. This "experiment" was just
that, a test of the latest weapon and ammunition technologies that might
increase the soldier\'s ability to hit more targets on the modern battlefield
while under combat stress. The most promising technologies could then be
incorporated into the specifications for the U.S. military\'s replacement for
the M16A2, slated to be issued no earlier than 1995. So, while the HK-ACR
rifle may not be issued in the exact form that it was tested at Fort
Benning, it is quite possible that some of the features of the rifle, or
possibly its caseless ammunition, could be included in the individual weapon
that our troops will carry into the 21st century.

If the OICW is to be that replacement, it sounds like somebody didn\'t learn
much from the G-11, because the OICW uses a bullpup design and looks like it
is going to be pretty frickin\' long (it looks like a gussied up Colt--just

You don\'t.

Plasmas are contained, accelerated,  and directed using magnetic or other
non-materiel,  fields. The "barrel" merely acts as a support for the
field-generation and control equipment.

Of course, the barrel still needs to be built tough to withstand battllefield
conditions.

Seriously COOL!  Those are the best pics of a H&K G11 I\'ve ever seen!

I\'ve got stats for one of these in a OLD RPG supplement from about 1982
that is in Hero Games and a couple other formats.  The really amazing thing
about the older prototypes is that not only did they have a 50 round clip,
but they could hold something like 24 clips in the stock!!!  Of course I
would imagine that the gun got pretty heavy at that point.

4.7mm is roughly 4-5 dime widths.  That\'s a lot bigger than a needle hole.

That\'s the opposite of my experience.  I could knock out a simple
ship with QSDS in 15 minutes, and *use* it in a roleplaying game.
HG took longer and was so abstracted as to be next to *useless* for
roleplaying.  If I want a wargame I\'ll go play something like
"Slag!," Traveller is for roleplaying.

>Be careful with those comments on HG, oh heretic!

Bah!  IMO, the first third of HG is a fine addition to the game,
Naval character generation, the last two thirds had very little
utility for me.  The sort of ships I want aren\'t size N with a pair
of P this and S that powered by an M and driven by a T and an O!
Geeze!  That\'s not abstraction, that\'s insanity!

But if *that* is what floats your boat, then more power to you.

You\'d better get cracking, pinkie.  The Vargr finished a beanstalk on Lair
in c. 1120, so you\'re way behind.  

It\'s in G:T Alien Races 1.  This is probably another reason for people to
pick on G:T, but when I challenged it in playtest, some cannon examples of
beanstalks from CT were presented as justification.  It appears to be
feasible, but not common.

Coincidentally, I\'m just finishing a detailed drawing of a Scout/Courier\'s
undercarriage for _First In_; the ship is sitting on the tarmac of a
starport, on it\'s rather complicated-looking landing gear. In my version,
the foreward gear do extend from the centerline, and are taller than the
aft gear, thus putting the decks level with the ground.

But I must admit that I draw what I think looks good, and pay only slight
attention to the deckplans -- even my own! (See my previous post re: my
Vargr Corsair illo and deckplans in BTC.)

Yeah, but these are, in Ditzie\'s words \'Kinetic-winetic energy-wenergy

The 150 mm SEFOP round has been subcontracted to Auric Shipyards, and would
have a basic penetration of 256.

At TL9 point defenses are becoming a lot more common, including reactive

GURPS already has rules for this in GURPS Callahan\'s Crosstime Saloon
(based on the Spider Robinson books of the same name).  Callahans would
make a good crossover for G:Trav.  Gurps Callahans is a good supplement
on a very surreal subject & it has nice Donna Barr art.  I think it is
OP, though.

Obviously Harmonian = Ancient

To properly crossover Callahans we will have to move it from Long
Island, unless your campaign is set on Terra.

and the projectile\'s length-to-width ratio is about 5:1.

Also, the G-11 has a fairly thick barrel, about 3cm across at the muzzle,
which makes the actual opening look smaller.

I stand corrected.

Then what was it I saw fired by GSG9 during a demo at Ft. Benning?  It
looked exactly like a G-11, but was obviously loaded in a conventional (for

Sorry if I gave that impression. I was reponding to the theme of
why (IMO) Steve Jackson wouldn\'t want to produce T5.

Gurps and Traveller promoting each other\'s sales via G:T is a good thing.

I just think that if SJG published T5 and FFS3, they would be missing
the point of Gurps and thus it is not likely.

As long as the concept of a USP stays dead.
They mean nothing to me, so I just read the test descriptions instead.
The worst offender is everyone\'s favourite pacman: Batteries Z
Since Z just means "more than Y", we\'re back to "some, many, lots" counting.

Personally I\'d just take full FFS3 and a computer program (or several).

If you do want a simplified system, I would suggest that each system
(drives weapons, etc) includes in its cost and volume the fuel, power plant
and crew space plus the crew count. This would make calculating ships easier
as weapons = a std, drives + armour + fuel = b% of total, thus ship is
100 a / (100 - b) std.

I believe Joe Heck did some work in 3D, taking some near earth data and

In the limitted extend of space we used (20 ly around sol), it made little

A jump one ship does not cut it around sol, but jump 3 can get just about
anyplace.  Since the worlds accessable with distance increases with d^3 instead
of d^2, the economic situation for trade oriented players might change.

Anyway, if you can get past the mapping issue, I recommend the 3 D.  I think it

	Grin. The first time I used a P90, the gun was fitted with a 
	silencer and I wore hearing protection (there were other 
	shooters who didn\'t use silencers). After I pressed the trigger 
	I began to wonde whether the gun fired or not; the recoil was

I believe the one referred to as \'scrapped late 70s\' was the fourth HMS Ark
Royal.  I learnt this back in the 70s when I was fortunate enough to actually
visit it - my father served on her for two years just before she was scrapped
(he *thinks* that might have been 1978).  He also had the following information:

1587 bought from Sir Walter Raleigh, fought in the Armada (against the Spanish)
1914 Merchant ship converted to sea-plane carrier for RN
1937 specifically built to carry 32 aircraft, sunk 14 Nov 1941 off Gibraltar
1943 keel laid down at Cammell Laird Yard (Birkenhead), launched 1950, featured
on a UK TV series (an early docu-soap), scrapped 1978???
1985 current Ark Royal entered service


for those who require more info on the current ship and a photo, try:

http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/today/index.htm

and look under surface flotilla and then aircraft carriers.

	An interesting way of dealing this issue was handled by National
Geographic in a starmap they published some time ago.  They had a series
of "this cylinfaer of space fits into this cyclinder of space" diagrams
showing the relative position/ size of Terra/Sol against the known
Universe.
	It had occured to me some time ago that using the bottom three
scales for this type of representation would be perfect...  A map showing
local groups of stars and the relative positions of the clusters....  The
a map for each group in greater detail, and if desired a map of each
system.

	I agree entirely, and that was what I wanted to do with my TNEC
maps, but decided I wan\'t about to write a program to render it the way I
wanted to see it on paper...  =)

Uncieeee ....

We\'ve finished it. Weeeee reckon-weckon it\'s a pretty-weety neato caaaaan
opener, an an an the weaaaapon itself is pretty-weety small (not really
weaallly Barbie-sized PAAAAAAAAAAWWWW size, but small for tankie-wankies).
But the battery-wattery an an an the accumulator-wumulator bankie is
preeeety big.

But but but accuuuumulators an batterwies are cheap, an an an the Total
Cost of Oooooowwwwnership should be pretty deeeecent.

An an an some of our customer-wustomers are worried about that.

The gun itself is one-twenny miiiiilimeters an an an it masses two point
eiiight eiiight tons an an an costs one forty four kilo-wilo cwedits. The
raaaapid blammie-blammie blam blam action maaaases one point fiiiiive tons,
an an an costs about fiiiiiifteeen kilocwedits.

The auuuutoloader maaaases nine hunnerd kiiiilos, an an an costs nine
kilocwedits.

The theeeeoretical wate of fire is fifty roundie-woundie-woundies per
minute (although they\'re actually more like riiiilllly rillly biiiiig
neeeeeeedles).

Power-wower demand (an an an I wanna make sure I have this right) 

muzzle energy = (warhead mass in kg/2000000) X (muzzle velocity in
m/sec)^2

The waaaarhead masses 30 kiiilos, an an an the muzzle velocity is 4000 m/s,
so the energy-wenergy demand is 30/2000000* (4000)^2 =
30/2000000*16000000=30*8=240 megajoules.

Now, techie-wechie 9 maaassss driver-wivers have efficiency of of of 3.6,
so the actual-wactual amount of energy-wenergy neeeded is eight hunnerd an
sixty four megajoules.

Thats thats thats eiiighty-six point four cuuuubic meters of accuuumulators
at techie-wechie niiine, which should massie-wassie 172.8 tons, an an an
cost eight hunnerd an sixty-four kilocwedits.

Incideeeentally, two hunnerd an forty megajoules of output-woutput is
enough for a penetration factor of three hunnerd an twelve, which should be
enoughie-wuffie to go thruuuuuuu most light crwuiser-bwusers.

The shellsie-wellsies should go for one hunnerd an five kilometer-wometers
an indiwect fiiiiire, an an an should go for one thousand meeeeters or so
before they start to run out of weeeeeeet-bix ... but they hurtie-wurtie
sooooo much that that that it shouldnt matter.

Miiiichael tells me I hafta-wafta do this riiiight, so so so damage at
meeeeedium range is two hunnerd an eighty, an at long it\'s call it two
hunnerd an sixty-five, an an an at extweme wange it\'s call it a hunnerd an
sixty.

The imaging raaaaadar an an an the balliiiiistic computer-wuter an an an
the full stabaaaaaalization cost another one hunnerd an twenny fiiive
kilocwedits an an an mass another two hunnerd an eight kiiiilos.

A set of indiwect fire sites costs another one hunnerd kilocwedits an an an
masses two hunnerd kiiiilos.

Eaaach shottie-wottie will take 864 megajoules, an an an 86.4 cuuubic
meter-weters of battery-watteries will be able to pwovide this for
thiiirty-six seconds, which shouldie-wouldie allow at least twenny shots in
that time. The battery-wattery pack will will will will mass 172.8 tons an
an an cost seven hunnerd kilocwedits.

The total weapon maaaases three hunnerd and fifty one point threeeeeeee
tons, an an an it costie-wosties one million nine hunnerd an fifty seven
kilocwedits.

Plus ammunition, which costie-wosties forty-fiiive cwedits a neeeedle.

Now, it is pweeeety heavy, but weeeeee reckon that contwa-gwavity should be
able to liftie-wiftie it.

Your loving cousin,

Ditzie

That rapid-fire capability ... ewwwww. You\'d hate to be caught in enfilade
by one of these beasts poking it\'s turret over the hill.

It would be a bit of a curiousity, becuase you can build a much better can
opener at TL10 with big fusion guns. I dare say some of them would see
service as artillery in TL10 and up militaries - that 100 km indirect fire
range is pretty nice, especially if it\'s launching individually
redirectable missiles.

Beanstalks should be pretty uncommon, due to the massive expense of
building one. A Beanstalk is a great idea if you don\'t have cheap contragrav,
and once you\'ve built it it will be very cheap to run, but the capital cost of
putting it up means you won\'t see them if there is any alternative.

You will see a beanstalk in a society where materials technology has
far surpassed gravitics technology - where the society discovers how to
make impossibly strong fibers before they learn (or buy, or steal) the secret
of cheap contra-grav. Earth, for example (noted in Canon as being 
chronically behind in gravitics tech).

Beanstalks may not be 100% safe, either. 
A White Dwarf magazine had a scenario called "Tower Trouble" in it, based
around the beanstalk on Terra. One possible (though unlikely) outcome
of the scenario had the beanstalk being cut, with the devastation of a major
urban area following as miles of superdense cable fell on it from near-orbit.

	Actually, that is the only complaint I have about the weapon...
Why *aren\'t* the rounds laser-seeking fin-directed (a la copperhead)?  One
infanteer could slaughter a tank battaltion with a painting laser (flight
time for the round from 100km is ~25 secs, which is nothing).  Each round
is hitting with the equiv of between a quarter-ton and an eighth of a ton
of TNT, so shrapnel damage will shred any APC\'s travelling with the tanks,
and God (Allah -> Zeus,inclusive, you pick) help any infantry caught out
in the open when that tank goes up.....  Waaaaaaaay up.... =)
	I am rather surprised that Ditzie didn\'t see this as a major use
of the weapon...  its wasted in the direct-fire role;  unless you are
trashing parked light-cruisers at a starport...  =)

Solomani game, here is a table that I am using to determine NPC Ethnic
Origins.  My game is set 2099, non-canon, so the table is stited a bit...
Terra has been a star-faring planet for 85 years.

        1d Gender 
                1-4 ... Male, 
                5-6 ... Female

        2d Ethnic Origins

                3       ...  Japanese/ Korean
                4       ...  Pacific Islander

                11      ..  Hispanic American
                12      ..  Central/ South American

        *Pre-Emptive Anti-Flame Strike:  Please *do* *not* *bother* pointing
racist fingers at me about the distribution on this table....  2d gives a
bell-curve, no matter how flat reality is.  
        Further, tragcally enough, if you evaluate the currently existing
space programmes and their ethnic coverage, I am not far off, as far as I
can see.
        The African group are given a higher than "right now" probability of
space-farers since I like the idea that Kilamanjaro will be Terra\'s first
mass-driver (See R.Talsorian\'s "Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0" and "Near Orbit/ Deep
Space" books)...  logically the workers would be local and then they move
into space to follow construction jobs....

        Other Notes:  The gender table is tilted towards males.  I do this,
because most characters in my games are male...  even those played by
ladies.  So, to have the NPC population not be completely at variance to the
PC population, there is 1/6 odds better of and NPC being male.
        The "Family Generation in Space" is more for interest...  since
space-faring is reasonably new, it is entirely possible that the NPC is the
*first* generation of thier family to leave Earth...  Generations of 2+ mean
that they are almost assuredly the children of a colony world.

        Comment, questions and critiques are, as always, welcome....

4.7mm rounds. Since all the world\'s infantry already use one of three
calibres (7.62, 5.56 and the newish Russian one - 5.45, I think), it\'s a
nightmare to integrate into your supply chain.

I\'m wondering how reliable that complicated feed mechanism is going to
be under real conditions.

R: Beanstalks

Dear Sir:

we recently intercepted a letter from our competitor, Standard Products,
discussing their lack of willingness to construct a vertical connected
transport tube (colloquially "Beanstalk") to allow fast transportation of
products and people from surface to orbit.

A system like Terra should not be without such a structure, and my company
is prepared to build you one...well actually, our economic analysts believe
that three beanstalks should be constructed over the next four decades to
enable a sustained period of economic renaissance to sweep the Terran
system.

There are many considerations that must be taken into account, but cost is
not one of them.  For the favor of an exclusive construction contract for
three beanstalks over 40 years we will take in compensation all revenues
generated by the devices, up to the limits of the attached fee schedules,
and provide a tax revenue stream amounting to 1.2% of the net revenue
collected after amortized costs of construction and annual costs of
operation.  You will be expected to provide the touchdown location
(generally a tall mountain peak and surrounding area is best) and an
asteroid massing approximately 20 million tonnes.

Our strategy as outlined in the attached brochure is simple.  We bring the
asteroid into a circular, stable, orbit around the planet and begin
manufacturing cable from the raw materials in the asteroid.  Our advanced
manufacturing methods leave very little waste material when constucting the
multiple-strand carbon fiber "cage" that will, in the end, be the tether
for your new Class A starport facility.

As the cable winds its way toward the ground, a tether station, built from
the material in the aforementioned mountain peak, reaches up and down to
anchor the tether in place, as well as to provide an embarking and
debarking station at the foot of the tether.

Eventually (estimated time for Earth; nine years) the cable will reach
nearly to the ground.  By this time, the last of the tiny adjustments
needed to match the perfectly circular orbit to its ground station will be
complete, and most of the mass of the asteroid will have been converted to
either cable or station parts.  A significant mass must remain, of course,
to act as the high anchor for the tether.

Or current plan is for a four rail tether.  That is, on the outside of the
cable will run four rails, each of which can handle one of the twelve story
"elevator cars" that require two hours to transit from ground to orbit.
The rails are both the adherent and propellent for the rail cars which will
be lifted electromagnetically into orbit, along with as much as 1000
displacement tons of material and over 100 passengers each.  This will
amount to capacity for 24,000 displacement tons and 2,400 passengers
travelling up *and* down each day.  Cost will be in the range of 2 to 12
credits per ton and 20 to 60 credits per passenger, depending on final
traffic.

Once the Terra Tether is well underway, and depending on market factors and
other considerations, we will begin construction on the Mars tether to
bring the significant raw materials and manufacturing capabilities of that
gem of the system into space.  If conditions warrant, a Venus Tether will
follow within the decades thereafter.

Thank you for your consideration.

Hytherlyn Freth, GSbAG
Starport Construction Division,
Beanstalk Office.

P.S. Remember that if the Tether is ever broken by natural forces or
sabotage at the high anchor, the massive cable will wrap itself three times
around the earth before the end hits.  That would be Bad.

Close. The Sea King AEW.2 takes the radar from the Nimrod MR.2
(Searchwater). The radar from the Nimrod AEW.3 never worked.

And yes, it is possible to perform flight ops from a STOVL carrier when
a CTOL carrier can\'t.

Captain Sam Salt RN, then Captain of HMS Sheffield, says that it
exploded. Until a better source comes along, I\'m taking his word for it.

Uncertainty as to whether one or two Exocets hit the MV Atlantic
Conveyor. She sank pretty quickly.

The ASW fit on a Type 42 DDG is minimal.

See above.

The superstructure on a T42 is steel, too. There are some aluminium
fittings, but none significant enough to be a factor in the fire.

HMS Bristol was a Type 82, designed as the lead ship in a class of heavy
destroyers to escort CVA-01. When CVA-01 was cancelled, so were the rest
of the Type 82s.

The `aluminium problem\' on the Type 21s never really occurred as a
flammability issue. The Type 21s *did* suffer from hull cracking (they
were never intended for South Atlantic service). The real `aluminium
problem\' was USS Belknap (IIRC), which suffered severe flame damage
after a collision with a carrier.

Well, he\'s got a while to go before he outlasts either Avalon Hill or
GDW...remember GDW was around for 20 years...Avalon Hill was around
longer than that. (Didn\'t they start up in the 60\'s?)

batteries has led the Sayat Board for the Optimization and Organization of
Munitions to develop a line of fully biodegradable, nature-friendly
portable power sources.  We are pleased to offer to the Imperial public
our first adaptation of this new technology to the personal energy weapons
line, with the Weasel-Human Interface Pistol, or WHIP.

The WHIP is a direct energy input laser pistol (3.2 kilojoule output), of
normal Sayat quality -- far superior to anything you barking little
animals can muster.  A WHIP with a normal complement of weasel assistants
can fire once every five seconds, with individual shots easily capable of
kills against humanoid-sized targets.

The innovation may be seen in the backpack: rather than heavy,
environment-unfriendly batteries, a pair of frisky, adventuresome weasels
run at your command in two separate spinwheels, generating about two watts
of power at normal speeds.  Weasels obtained from SayBOOM are fully
trained and respond to verbal requests for increased output -- up to 10
watts for brief bursts, allowing one shot per second.  At their normal
speed, the weasels can provide up to an hour of uninterrupted power
output.  (Please note that the two wheels spin in opposite directions,
thus cancelling any awkward torque that might be imparted to backpack
wearers in zero-gravity conditions.)

As an added benefit, SayBOOM weasels are also independent attack animals,
able to stalk, chase, and bring down prey much larger than themselves,
particularly when working in tandem.  SayBOOM wish to take this
opportunity to wholeheartedly deny rumors that said weasels are in fact
psionic spies and saboteurs bent on destroying Imperial civilization.

Three times around the earth?  You mean that the tether extends to a

_Arrival Vengeance_ had some history of the ship, including the evolution
of its Ship\'s Badge (stylized AH-class coming toward viewer, tail number,

I seem to remember Battle Honours are mentioned in Adv. 1 _Kinunir_,

This might explain some of the confusion. I think that the USN (among other
navies) defines ship types by function. Destroyers are ASW ships and cruisers
are AA ships. Frigates are slower cheaper DD\'s. These are only generalizations
but can cause some confusion. By this reasoning, I could see a type 42 called
a cruiser and a Broadsword as a DD or a frigate...How does the RN classify

It\'s entirely possible that you don\'t have full height decks on the top and
bottom.  The upper deck may have a pitched ceiling while the lower deck may have
sloping floors and be reminiscient of a bomb bay.  If you put your lifesupport
to the sides of these decks rather than in the ceiling or floor you can free  up
more  headroom.  This might also explain the circulatory problems the scouts
suffer.

The barrel is *very* short.  According to the article, it has a barrel
length of 10.35in.  If you are looking for a \'rear-area\' or vehicle crew
weapon, you can get a 6in barreled AR that is about the same size and weight
- - and it fires the standard 5.56mmN round, uses most of the same parts as
the AR15/M16 family (infact, everything is the same except fot the
barrel,/gas tube/hadguards) - including the same magazines.

Also, much of the US is adopting the M4
(http://shoga.wwa.com/~dvelleux/m16rifle.html) due to its more compact size
and weight.

This was one of the biggest problems with the G11.  They also ran into heat
problems with the caseless ammo.  A brass case does a lot to remove the heat
from the action.

This implies revenues of about a hundred million credits per year, or
construction costs (for a 5% annual ROI) in the 1-2 billion credit range.

For 1-2 billion credits you can buy a couple of hundred hundred-ton shuttles,
each capable of carrying a maybe 60 tons of cargo and 10-20 passengers. 
They can reach orbit in less than an hour. If they make even two flights per
day they\'ll match the beanstalk, and at 5-10 flights per day they\'ll
completely surpass it.

Traveller magic reactionless drives are so good that Beanstalks really don\'t
make a whole lot of sense. (Kind of like arguments about mass transit - only
you\'re comparing flying cars with a railroad that has to be built straight
up.)

Fair point. None of the references I have to hand quotes him on that (GDW
South Atlantic War for Harpoon, Brian Hanrahan\'s book), but they aren\'t the
most exhaustive (my others are at home). I\'m happy to accept his word.

Couple of torpedo tubes, plus a helicopter? HMS Sheffield didn\'t have the
TTs IIRC.

I thought that was the case - I remember the PVC wire insulation being
attributed as part of the problem, but the Al issue being a type 21 thing.

Oops, the 1 from 21 jumped in place of the 2 in 82...

I suspect the Al build means that the ship wouldn\'t be as easily
recoverable from battle damage (unlike the initial plans to repair HMS
Sheffield).

Are you \'imagination chalenged\'?   That was BORING!

The bar is the \'Dunken Dwarf\' run by an ex-dunk dwarf with the human use
name of Ralf.  He wares his beard parted and braided into a pair of
\'Princess Laya\' earmuffs.  The bouncer by the door is a bald ogre wearing
just a loin cloth make from a blacksmith\'s apron and uses half of a wagon
axle as a billy club.  A preteen vampire girl trades her charms for blood
and money in a room upstairs.  The fence that specializes in cutting up and
selling very hot jewlery that you came here to find is played \'darts\' with
daggers with a one eyed hobbit in the back corner of the bar.  The fence is
not happy.  He\'s losing.  You swere and order a strong drink as you worry
over the price you will get for princess\' treassures.  The crown would have
been worth a great deal more without the sword cut and the dried blood will
have to be cleaned form the rudy neckless.  Pity she knew how to fight.
That princess would have brought a tidy profit in ransom or perhaps a
smaller price from the slavers across the border if \'daddy\' was not to
bright.  That was the original plan after all but you will still make out
ok.  The others did not see you pocket the girl\'s baubles in their panic
over having killed their kidnap victim. The payout would have been fair
split 12 ways but rich indeed when not devided at all.  You make a mental
note to leave a anonimous note for the magistrate to insure that your
\'partners\' do not cause you any problem.  You set your glass down to cheer,
for very personal reasons, the fence\'s last minute victory over the one eyed
hobbit.  Your bussiness should soon be finished here and the ship you have
booked passage on leaves at dawn.  Things are definately looking up.

Sorry, Bruce.

Did we mention that the weasels are highly absorbent and suitable for use
as nasal spray guards?

There was a slight problem with how I calculated that pesky little input
power demand thingy, and -- to borrow Comrade Ditzie\'s phrase -- it needs
a lot more weet-bix.

Two weasels = 1 shot per half hour.

~720 weasels = 1 shot/5 second combat round.

We apologize for this slight oversight.  We take it as demonstrated that
the flaws are merely basic and fundamental, while the design is perfect in
its details.  Orders will be accepted for wholesale and retail lots
immediately.

I tried some time ago, and i downloaded a list of HTMLized near stars, and with some
software (Starmap, i\'ve got the file to unzip it on a win95 system, 1,73 Mb. long if
you don\'t find it) i was able to represent them.

I needed to make some conversions so that the alt-dec and paralax astronomical
position coordinates gets to be a tree dimensional point cartesian coordinates, but
again i found some help in a web site.

Tell me if you\'re interested, and i\'ll remove all electronic dust over all these to
send to you the files, or the URL.

I would increase the chance of \'mixed\' parents, and furthermore allow for
more than two ethnic backgrounds.  Judging by both my friends and my kids,
I anticipate a lot more people having mixed ethnic backgrounds in the next
century.

For example, one of my neighbour\'s has Greek, Cypriot, and Pakistani
grandparents, her husband\'s grandparents are Italian -- so how would you
classify her kids, other than Canadian (which is how the whole family
views themselves)?

Thinking about it, the majority of my married friends are in \'mixed\'
marriages, and none of my girlfriends have been Caucasian (let alone
English). I don\'t think I\'m _that_ unusual...

Generally speaking you get out of something what you are willing to put into
it.  If you are unwilling to invest the time and creativity to make your
adventures interesting they will be boring regardless of the system you are
using.  Some of the most boring gaming I have taken part in were run by GMs
that just blindly followed a published adventure.  Some without ever reading
it before hand.  The adventures where good but the presentation was terible.

Not a problem.  I send waste time thinking up such things.  I can also run
most situations off the cuff with little slow down in the game.  I\'ve been
playing RPG and GMing for almost 20 years.  I\'ve got lots of material I can
reuse.  The dwarf becomes a Feringi, the ogre a Wookie, the jewels a data
disk...  You just need a little imagination.  A few \'prepared\' stock gaffs
and muguffins help also.

Have you considered installing some sort of battery/capacitor, 
so the weasels can run their little weasel hearts out during 
those tedious weeks in jumpspace, and store up enough juice to 
actually allow this to be used in combat? I know it detracts
from the purity of the concept, but I might order one with

First, I should like to apologize for my absence from this
forum; the duties of my position and a mild illness conspired to
absorb the vast majority of my time of late. Nevertheless, I
have done my best to keep abreast of the discussion, and feel
that I as an individual and we as a community have so far
profited from its having taken place.

That said, I reenter this forum at this time because I have
strong feeling about the way it has gone, and of some of the
sentiments expressed here. I believe that we have lost sight of
the purpose of this debate, and I would address that, as well as
responding to specific points that have been brought forward.

To all appearances, much of the protest in favor of the status
quo are due to the use of ill-defined - or perhaps it would be
more accurate to say \'undefined\' - terms, such as \'oppressive\'
governments.  I must point out that I brought up this very point
in my initial response to Gallatin\'s opening statement in this
debate. Certainly, I have seen none of the participants take up
the issue; doubtless there are good and proper reasons for this,
though they may not be visible to one of my limited perception.
Even so, this may legitimately be classed as a detail of
implementation, while the debate here is, or at least should be,
about whether change is necessary, and if so, to what purpose.
Gallatin sets out a compelling case for change; I have noticed
many of the same stresses of which he speaks.

To the question of the practicality of a representative
structure, I answer thus: there is no necessary connection
between size and practicality. It is the responsibility of the
higher levels of government to take the higher and longer views;
local issues must in general be managed at the local level. This
might seem to be an endorsement of the status-quo; I hold that
it is not, as the activism comes into play when it is seen that
the lower levels have proven unequal to the task, whether from
inability or unwillingness to deal properly with the issue.
Until that is shown, it would be inappropriate for the higher
levels to get involved, save at the explicit request of the
lower levels. Activism, in this case, is simply the policy of
responding to requests for help (as opposed to saying "it\'s your
local problem; take care of it yourself"), and of not waiting
for the request for help, if it is apparent that a situation is
getting out of control. This is not that much different from
the present reality; perhaps we merely seek to lower the
threshold for intervention.

But, under the restructuring, it becomes the responsibility of
the higher levels of government to also be aware of the
situations at lower levels, and to direct the attention of those
lower levels to those situations, so that they do not come to
the point where it is necessary for the higher levels to
actively intervene. At this stage, advice and recommendations
are available, but not proffered without request; here, the
activist Imperium merely says, "You have the potential for a
problem; it would be a good idea to prevent the potential from
becoming an actuality". Regardless of how the higher levels are
structured, it is intuitively obvious to the most casual
observer that there cannot be a single level of government
between the people and the Emperor, any more than that situation
obtains at present with our hereditary nobility; it is this
hierarchicalization that both enables oversight and prevents
meddling.

To the question of beholdenness of nobles versus elected
officials: Do those who claim that the one is more - or less -
beholden than the other know truly whereof they speak? A large
portion of our nobility is not enfeoffed of inherently
productive lands, but instead in a manner that their estates and
incomes are tied to the fortunes of locally dominant
corporations. Look to the lists of the directorates of the
largest corporations; see just how often "Sir", "von", "hault",
"His/Her Excellency", "His/Her Grace", or their equivalents in
High Vilani or High Sylean appear. To argue in favor of or
against a hereditary nobility on this basis is a false argument;
economic power and political power are but two sides of the same
coin, and will invariably attract each other as a magnet
attracts iron. Elective office is clearly no different; the
elected official is no less beholden to those who provide the
lion\'s share of campaign funding - which will be the same
corporations that the present nobility is equally beholden - or
not - to.

To the question of "joining the Hivers" in manipulation of the
people, as contrasted with joining the Solomani and Zhodani in
fear of change: I propose no such thing. Hiver manipulations are
active, true, but they seek to create social patterns of the
choosing of the manipulator. I propose instead that the people
should be permitted to choose, and the Imperium to respond -
rather than being the manipulator, the Imperium would be in
truth more like the manipulatee. Even this comparison is
inappropriate; in our mutual humanity, we have more in common
with the Solomani or even the Zhodani than we do with the
Hivers; our physiology and psychology are similar enough that
mutual comprehension is possible, even if agreement is not. With
the alien in physiology as well as psychology, mutual
comprehension can be no more than superficial; and agreement is
possible only on those issues where common comprehension occurs;
thus, unification with the Two Thousand Worlds, the Hive
Federation, or the Aslan Hierate is far more unlikely than
unification with the Zhodani Consulate or reabsorption of the
Solomani Sphere. This is not belied by the existence of
non-Human worlds within our dominion; these worlds are either
far less integrated into our Imperium than Human worlds (as
with, for example, the Jgd-Il-Jagd or the Githiaskio), or their
inhabitants have shown a psychology that is surprisingly similar
to and/or compatible with that of Imperial Humanity (as with the
Vargr or the Bawapakerwa-a-a-awapawab).

To the issue of granting more power to the Imperium than it
already has: It is clear from the text of the Warrant of
Restoration that the Imperium already has all the powers under
discussion: the Warrant explicitly reserves to the Imperium the
right to unilaterally change the relationship between itself and
its Member Worlds. Rather, then, than this being a debate over
the granting of power, it becomes clear that it should instead
be considered in the nature of an open discussion and offering
of advice to the Emperor, that he or his heirs or descendants
may benefit from the Imperial Power and use it wisely, rather
than exercising it imprudently, without preparation or counsel.
That the power has not in the recent past been indiscriminately
exercised is irrelevant; the possibility remains always, and
none in this debate have proposed such indiscriminate use of the
power. Is it not better that this should be discussed in the
open, now, before a crisis requires action without due
reflection, than that we wait, only to discover at the moment of
crisis that we are in the hands of another Cleon III, with
results more disastrous in the future than in the past?

To the question of abolishing the Nobility and infeudation in
favor of a Federal Republic, with a written Charter of Rights:
It has been offered as justification that the hereditary
nobility has devolved into mediocrity and incompetence; how
farther from the truth could this be? Our enfeoffed nobility is
by no means perfect, and there are wastrels among them, but by
and large, the evidence is that the vast majority are
responsible individuals, exercising their powers and meeting
their responsibilities in a competent manner. These in general
also have the support of higher level nobles, some of whom are
more than merely competent; I name no examples, as the readers
of this debate will surely recognize those to whom I allude. No,
I see no widespread incompetence or mediocrity that needs to be
\'repaired\' through the mechanism of a Federal Republic with
elective administration, for such would be no less prone to
mediocrity and incompetence than the present noble structure is,
and would in addition be most skilled not at administration and
the discharge of obligation, but at the projecting of charisma
and the artful evasion of responsibility, through the
manipulation of language and emotion. The elective obligation is
no obligation at all, as an examination of experience throughout
our Imperium and of the past of prominent cultures thereof will
reveal; the feudal obligation extends both above and below, as
it is the noble\'s responsibility to collect taxes and supply
levies as demanded by his lord, from whose fief his own derives,
and also to protect those on whom he depends for the production
of those revenues and those levies, and who look to him for that
protection, and for justice, and for mercy. This extends from
the local barons, who must needs directly deal with the people,
all the way up to the Emperor, who is answerable to none, save
the ultimate power of the Moot to dissolve the Imperium, and
with it the Imperial Power, but who is also the fount of all
honor and privilege, and is ultimately responsible for and to
the entire Imperium. It is true that the obligations downward
may be neglected; it is this, among other things, that a
restructuring and revitalization of the Imperium would address.
Where the higher levels of government take interest in the
happenings on lower levels, the lower levels cannot fail to do
so as well, lest they themselves be perceived as the problem,
and thus become the target of measures to be taken.

Yet the voice of the people must be heard, and representative
councils appear to be a powerful method to ensure this.  With
the ultimate power and responsibility for setting policy in the
hands of the nobility, the representative councils could perhaps
be given a consultative role in the implementation of that
policy, and an advisory role in the creation of it, providing a
channel not answerable to either the planetary government nor to
the nobility, but to the people themselves, for expressing the
concerns and needs thereof.

To abolish the nobility would be to destroy the Imperium;
interstellar communication is simply too slow to permit the
formation of a Federal Republic on an Imperial scale - although
there is no reason that polities - even multi-world polities -
subordinate to the Imperium could not be so organized, if they
so choose.

To the question of similarity of proposals aired here to
government structures emplaced elsewhere: It is distressing to
see proposals attacked on what is best characterized as an ad
hominem basis; that governments with distasteful practices
maintain structure with meritous characteristics does not render
those structures contaminated: were it otherwise, one would have
to argue similarly against even the present structure of the
Imperium, as it is virtually certain that one could find _in_
the Imperium governments that are structured identically, but
which maintain distasteful practices.  Similarly, one can
equally likely find governments both within and without the
Imperium that are quite successful and desirable, yet which
maintain structures similar to those of governments we find
distasteful. Would this be a reason to intervene in these
successful governments, and force a change in their operation?
Nay, the mere structure of a government should cause neither
preference nor dispreference; different societies, even within
our Imperium, will have differing needs, and it is up to the
Imperium to respect those differences, and to cherish the
diversity - but not to tolerate that which is inherently
oppressive. Even there, circumspection is indicated, as it is
ultimately the responsibility of the Imperium to deal with
problems that affect the Imperium as a whole, even if those
problems are expressed locally, and not to get involved in every
petty local dispute. The multi-level structure is inherently a
filter, to ensure that no problem rises too far beyond its
appropriate level.

To the question of a decentralized Federal Republic: This
proposal is even more unworkable than the strong Federal
Republic; the "States\' Rights" model preserves the policy of
non-interventionism of the present Imperium, while abolishing
one of the few ties that still hold the Imperium together, that
of feudal obligation. This is a recipe for disaster; it would
result in allowing regions and even worlds to pursue their own
interests in differing directions, without regards for Imperial
interests. Do we really wish to see the Imperium shattered into
dozens or even hundreds of small, ineffective polities, unable
to even coordinate defense well enough to prevent domination by
extant governments which we know are hostile? No, we must
restructure the Imperium to _strengthen_ the ties, and bind the
Member Worlds more tightly to the Imperium, rather than loosen
the ties that exist.

To the question of the goals of the restructuring: It has
perhaps not been made clear, but the goals have been implicitly
stated. Nevertheless, I shall state them more explicitly: The
Imperium no longer has a unifying vision. There is the function
of defense, and the protection of commerce, but there is little
or nothing that makes our people desirous of saying proudly, "I
am an Imperial citizen", or that inspires them to pull together
to a common purpose. Emotionally, our people are disunited;
there is nothing that they can look to beyond their own local
and regional interests. The happenings of the Antares region are
of little interest to the inhabitants of the region \'behind the
claw\' or on the rimward frontier; events in those places are of
little interest to the peoples of the Imperial core or Ilelish.
The Imperium needs a common goal, one that can bring our people
together and benefit us all. There are many goals that can
provide this function: war, natural disasters, and visionary
achievement have all been used to this purpose in the past;
which is ultimately selected is a matter for due consideration
by the policy-making bodies of the Imperium: but I propose that
this should be the pursuit of knowledge for the betterment of
the people. By addressing our internal problems at all levels,
by marshaling the resources of the Imperium to our purpose, we
can see to it that none of our worlds or our people need suffer
involuntarily from the conditions of unenlightenment,
uneducation, undevelopment. We can encourage and assist in
technological development, and the accompanying educational
development; we can put our educated people to work exploring
new frontiers of knowledge, and exploring the application of
what we do know to our productivity. With an increase in
production will come greater demands and new uses for that
production; what we can accomplish in the future is
unimaginable, as many of our accomplishments today would have
been unimaginable to the leaders of the Ziru Sirka or the Terran
Confederation.

Looking damn good there.  With the people present, I get a much 
better perspective of the relative size of the craft.

I prefer the appearance, by far, of the #2, nose-down view.

The decks can still be assumed to be parallel to the landing pad,
and thus not in line with the wedge configuration.  Grav plates and
inertial compensators can explain why the deck arrangement doesn\'t
cause problems during flight.  Not very efficient (and definitely
another option besides deck alignment that\'s parallel and 
perpendicular to thrust), but it works.

Just my opinion.  YMMV.

Keep up the great work,

You check them with doppler radar. And I think you\'ve overlooked the
delta-v available to a standard trader in Traveller. You really
*could* "fly" into a parking slot "dodging" other ships along the way. 
It\'d be wasteful as all hell, but it wouldn\'t be *impractical*. 

Yes, it\'d be more efficient to calculate an orbit, and do a minimum
burn rendezvous. It\'d also consume far more time than many skippers
would feel like taking. 

Assuming you\'ve got a simulator program that will let you, try plugging
in a max accel of a g or two, and enough fuel for *weeks* of max accel.
(yes, the specific impulse will be totaslly unreasonable. Welcome to
Traveller :-)

Now try doing a "brute force" rendezvous of the type I just described.
It\'ll *work*. And be *time* efficienct. 

Yes, some of the "flying" is counter-intuitive TO US. Someone who has
been doing this sort of manuever weekly (or even daily for ground to
orbit shuttles), it\'ll be old hat.

I don\'t have the references handy, but there does indeed exist a
*theoretical* solution. As I stated, it involves a converging series.
One that converges at an infinitesmal rate. As I recall, said solution
was discovered something like 50-100 years ago. It *predated*
computers. 

As far as the math types are concerned, the problem is "solved". The
fact that their solution is useless doesn\'t bother them. :-(

We just have to give you the transponder code for the satellite. 

One detail that you\'ve overlooked is that as ship that has just jumped
into the system doesn\'t *have* data that is required to *use* those
orbital elements. He knows his distance from the planet, and his 3-axis
velocity relative to it. 

He does *not* know his *orientation* with respect to the co-ordinate
system. 

As I recall, the elements of an orbit are:

1. semi-major axis
2. eccentricity
3. inclination
4. longitude of the periapsis
5. longitude of the ascending node
6. time of periapsis passage

(I think I forgot one, but the above will do).

Numbers 3, 4, & 5 all depend on a *local* co-ordinate system.
Establishing his relation to that co-ordinate system is going to be
messy. 

I submit that it\'s actually *easier* to assign a satellite as a
reference point, and to assign others as "channel markers". 

So rather than having to spend a lot of time establishing his
co-ordinates, the pilot gets a list of trasponder squawks and what his
relative position and velocity should be. Three satellites define a
triangle, and he\'s to pass between them at a given time and velocity.
That restricts his path and position sufficiently for most purposes.

In actuality, I expect that there will be some elements of steering by
reference to markers, and some elements of having traffic control tell
you where you are.

It\'ll be similar with any likely system of handling things. just keep
in mind that any practical system is going to need lots of satellites.
Either as "markers", or as navigational references.

And I find at leasst *some* use of them quite likely. *Especially*
farther out ("park by bouy 789 until the customs lighter has checked
you over...").

As I point out above, *somehow* a ship needs to determine its relation
to the planetary co-ordinate system *or* it needs to have a series of
"markers" it can navigate with reference to. 

It\'s *way* too expensive to have traffic control sensors that can
quickly determine the ship\'s position and velocity to the required
accuracy for navigation solely by orbital elements. So you *have* to
have a *large* constellation of satellites to make something akin to
GPS workable (given the space to be covered, you\'ll need many, *many*
thousands of them). Or you need "markers" to navigate by. Probably some
combo of each.

The computer would handle most of it, but any smart navigator will be
checking along by hand, at least enough to be sure that the answers are
reasonable.

"Ok, marker 0000 is a statite above *north* pole, marker 9000 is
 statite above *south* pole. Check. *That* way is planetary north."

I figure they\'d have two, both for redunancy and so that *no* possible
approach would be unable to spot at least *one* of them.

"Marker 5000 defines leading, 5900 defines trailing. Check."

(probably another pair of statites, riding in planetary orbit a couple
hundred diameters ahead and behind it)

"Time hacks from the primary 4 markers give local time as...."

At this point, you know at least *roughly* how you fit into the local
co-ordinate system. Reference to an ephemeris and a lot of calculations
will refine the position, as will further observations of other
satellites. 

But for smaller ports, just homing on an assigned beacon may be *much*
cheaper for the port.

As I recall, part of the problem was that Exocets, being a NATO weapon,
were default classified as *friendly* by the sensor suite. That led to
a lot of software changes by *everyone* as it sunk in that you had to
assume that someday you just might be fighting "allies".

Another month, and the website has been updated again. If you go to
http://www.bits.org.uk/ you\'ll be able to find the following:

- - Info on GenCon UK (1 to 5 Sept 99) linked to the RPGA site.
- - Reduced size menu buttons, to help those of you running less than 800 x 600.
- - A reorganised Travelling page (faster load with most photos no longer
inline). New Con details.
- - A few words on TowerCon, from last weekend.
- - Corrected links to Vision Forge Graphics (Jesse\'s site)

The changes are mainly administrative, but let me know what you think (off
list would be fine).

Marc Miller posted something on this a while ago - I can\'t remember if it
was here or on the TWG list.

Anyway, you can get an idea of Omni if you look at the BITS site
(http://www.bits.org.uk/) - the menu buttons, and the Vertical Text are
generated from Omni in Adobe Illustrator. It\'s very close to the MT font.
Rob has used it in 101 Starships for GT and 102 vehicles, too. Both of
these are on the download page.

That, sir, is a "poni."  The poni is a riding beast found on certain
Imperial worlds.  When the Communications Branch was devising a
distinctive patch, they wanted to invoke the legends of the Pony Express
from pre-starflight Terra.  As the riding beast with which the artist
was most familiar was the poni, said artist assumed that this was the
animal ridden by the ancient Terran dispatch riders.

Lots of confusion; the Arleigh Burke DDG has no helicopter - and hence is 
almost useless for ASW - but has a full Aegis armament for AAW.
The USN classification is mostly by size/price these days.

That\'s a pretty good match for "Peignot".  Some knockoffs of it

Very, very nice.  Naturally these aren\'t quite identical to the pictures I had
in my head when I wrote the verbal descriptions -- but they\'re pretty damn
close considering you and I have never communicated.  Kudos.

Front jack?  I haven\'t seen so many pictures of grounded Scout/Couriers,
but I\'ve got a third gear configuration.  There are only two gear, and
they\'re farther forward as indicated on the old floorplan.  The third
landing point is the hull itself -- reinforce the aftermost part of the
ventral ridge and allow it to touch the ground.  (See Jesse\'s illo 1 to
help visualize this.)  This makes the gear the *forward* struts.  :)

The engines are going to be fairly massive, and most of the Scout\'s
volume is to the aft.  Even if the Scout were of constant density, I
figure the center of mass will be *aft* of the traditional landing gear
location!  (On the plan, this is about seventy percent of the ship\'s
length from the nose; but unless I\'m way off I figure over sixty percent 
of the ship\'s volume is aft of that, including the Air/Raft, turret, and
all of the engineering compartment.)

Complicated?  If anything, it is far more simplistic in its design than an
M-16 action.


It actually has LESS moving parts than most weapons.  And I\'ve never heard
anything about the weapon\'s function being the problem.  Just the ammo.  H&K
claims that it worked all of that out and that during tests, the solid
propellant was subjected to crushing, dropping a magazine from an aircraft,
etc.

Loyalty to Colt seems to be the main obstacle in adoption.

I doubt  loyalty to Colt is the problem, or we would be stuck with the .45
for a sidearm.
The main reason is probably that the US wants to test designs and work out
all problems. The original M-16 when used with the original ammo was a
devastating weapon, but once the Army got ahold of it, assigned guidelines
to its performance, etc, the finished product was very faulty and the wrong
ammo had been purchased (incorrect type of powder I should say). I would
rather them test guns to death before settling on a replacement.
From what I have heard about the G-11, it is a good gun, pretty grunt proof
and the ammo can even be submerged for hours without being useless. I have
also heard that it is SO grunt proof, there are problems.  IF a round can
jam, I am not sure if there is a way to remove it in the field. I don\'t
think the G-11 can be field stripped.
I also shy away from the rotating chamber that the gun has/had.  The
original design had a magazine parallel to the barrel which utilized a
rotating chamber mechism.
As good as the G-11 sounds, it also sounds like something I wouldn\'t want.
Of course I did hear that they float!!!

That\'s kind of spooky, since O\'HIGGINS\' [ex-BROOKLYN] half-sister, the
Brazilian cruiser TAMANDARE [ex-ST. LOUIS] sank in late 1980 or early
1981, while being towed to (IIRC) Taiwan for scrapping.

ObTrav:  In our campaign, I designed two TL13 cruiser classes, the
BROOKLYN and ST. LOUIS, on basically identical hulls.  The primary
difference between them is that the BROOKLYN class has spinal meson
guns, and the ST. LOUIS class has spinal NPAWs.  <shameless plug> You

Perhaps if you reduced the power by about a factor of 4 (it\'d still do 
3d TNE damage at short range) and doubled the number of carried weasels? 

Alternatively - though less green - you could use "sprint weasels". The 
two weasels in the generator wheels, instead of running at their sustainable
power level, are each run at about 5-10 watts through the administration of
electric shocks and/or powerful drugs. When they burn out after a minute, 
new weasels are released from a weasel storage chamber. (After all, the 
weight of the generator wheels probably exceeds the weight of the weasels.)
My mental picture the storage chamber is an underbarrel tube magazine 
(prefably transparent) like a shotgun, packed full-o-weasels; I imagine a 
sort of pump shotgun action...(kching-squeel-zap-squeel!-ZAP!)
(kching is the pump mechanism, squeel is the used weasels being ejected,
zap is the electric shock, squeel! is the new weasels getting up to speed,
ZAP! is the laser shot.)

Yes, but, from what I\'ve been told since moving here, IOWA would never
make it past the US 190 bridge over the Mississippi in north Baton
Rouge.  Supposedly, Gov. Huey P. Long decreed that the bridge should be
built too low to allow ocean-going vessels to pass under, in order to
ensure that no river city north of Baton Rouge could become a seaport.

New York City and New Jersey are fighting for the New Jersey. New York wants
to add her to the Intrepid Air and Space Museum, while New Jersey wants to
moor her at the pier (the old ferry piers near the train shed/museum) in the
Liberty State Park to make her a museum exhibit. My money is on New Jersey
getting her, though as an ex-New Yorker, I would love to see her moored next
to the Intrepid... I don\'t know what will happen to the Iowa or the Wisconsin,
though as the Iowa was built in New York (at either the Brooklyn Navy yard or
NY shipyards? I don\'t have my reference in front of me...); it\'s possible New
York MAY get her for the Intrepid museum (especially if the New Jersey goes to
Liberty State Park...), though I think these two will probably go to the
breakers...:-(

A modified X-Y/X-Z map pair would be quite workable. A standard 8x10
hex map, with an 8x8 rectangular map joined to it at the top or bottom.
The rectangular map would have the horizontal axis representing X, just
like the hex map. So each colum on it would have the same X co-ordinate
as the colum of hexes it was "attached" to. Each row would be a
different Z co-ordinate. 1 being closest to the join, 8 being farthest
away. 

They look a bit funny, but by have two views, they are quite usable.
Doing it for a whole sector would be a nightmare. Then again, you\'ve
got 640 "hexes" in an 8x10x8 "subsector" as opposed to 1280 in a 32x40
"sector". 

Hmmm. Split the difference. Make the subsectors only *four* high (8x10x4), and the
"sector" 2x2x2 (16x20x8). Which winds up with the same number of
"hexes", just in a more compact version.

Beanstalks on an Earthlike world require unreasonably strong materials.
On a smaller planet, with the same day length (Mars for example) we
could almost build a beanstalk now. 

And there are *lots* of other concepts that are usuable on various
types of worlds. For instance, I\'d expect to see a Loftstrom "Launch
Loop" in use on at least *some* vacuum worlds.

        Hi, Jon...  ok...  maybe put them at the "5 Chinese/ South East
Asian" and push everything down one?  I was aware they had a programme, but
didn\'t think they were any closer to manned space flight than the Chinese
were...

        Hi, Rob!
        I couldn\'t agree with you more...  hmmm...  Ok, where abouts on the
table would you suggest it...  a typical 2d bell curve looks like:

        Roll        of 10k        %
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        2             257           2.57
        3             583           5.83
        4             872           8.72
        5             1159          11.59
        6             1349          13.49
        7             1644          16.44
        8             1373          13.73
        9             1111          11.11
        10            893           8.93
        11            485           4.85
        12            274           2.74

        So, 2.5% is too low...  

>For example, one of my neighbour\'s has Greek, Cypriot, and Pakistani

        There is most likely Mic Mac Amerindian blood in my viens somewhere
along the lines, but I am one of the *whitest* guys other than David Bowie
you are apt to meet...  So, at what point do you figure dilution?
Obviously, I want a *quick* system, but not one that routinely visits left
field....

>Thinking about it, the majority of my married friends are in \'mixed\'

>
        Let me guess... you are in Toronto, right?
        Here in Halifax, two friends of mine had a lot of grief from those
around them while they were dating...  he is black and she is white.  Grief
that including physical violence from strangers.
        They are also the only "mixed couple" that I know of...  unless you
count French/ English.  Actually, correction, another couple I know of is
WASP/ Indonesian (man, is she *cute*)....  but I think that\'s it...

        Thanks for your comments...

Well, at TL 15 (and just throwing these numbers together) I came up with:

Quark Class Jump Courier
1 ton displacement
Jump 2
1.5 G Manuever Drive (8 hrs)
6 MW Power Plant
Extended Life Support
8 wks Food
1 500 Km Radio
1 Roomy Seat
2x Std Computer

Now, the poor sap...er...sophant who \'volunteers\' to take this puppy into
J-space will be stuck in his Mk I Crazy-Boy Reclining pilot\'s chair for the
duration, but you did ask for the smallest design.

H&K says it can, and more quickly and more easily with less moving parts.

It still does.  You can shy away from it all you like, but it obviously

I think I\'ve seen some jump pods that could fit into a turret socket.  I
myself made a 4dT jump-capable communications buoy in the same configuration
as a standard cargo module.  Both designs make some assumptions about not
actually needing somebody to sit in the pilot seat during jump.

At this point you should just make it into a hardened environment suit with a

I suspct the Japanese are closer on all counts than are the Chinese.
Actually,
if I remember right the Japanese program is heavy on the robotic probes, but
there\'s a school of thought that says that in the long term this is just as
productive -- you do a lot of exploration and setting up of advance bases with
robots, then send the men later.  In theory, anyway.

Heh, you\'re prolly right.  I really don\'t see any role the Quark could fill,
except as a jump-capable lifeboat...of course it might be just the thing for
some genetically enhanced weasels to cruise the galaxy in.  <g>

Excellant product, well worth it

Do not touch with a 3.048m barge pole

Good if you\'re a gearhead, but get the errata (its
online, but I can\'t remember exactly were).

My suggestions (in order) would be:
1st - Psionic Institutes (excellant info on the psi
      institues)
2nd - Pocket Empires (good for grand multiplanet econmic
      games)

I recommend that you do NOT buy Starships.

What you should buy depends on what you want to do with Traveller.
For example, if you don\'t intend to create detailed ships and
weapons and don\'t consider yourself a "gearhead" you probably don\'t
want FFSv2.

Based on how much utility I got from the books my suggestions, in
descending order, are:

1.  FFSv2 -- create ships, aircraft and weapons, very detailed, for
             gearheads of all ages

2.  Pocket Empires -- adds economics rules, empire building and
                      dynastic play, has some problems but is very
                      innovative

3.  Milieu 0 Campaign -- get the hardback, not the original
                         paperback..it\'s got more material,
                         corrections and the best parts of First
                         Survey included, an interesting milieu to
                         play in (not that I haven\'t complained that
                         I would have done things differently)

4.  Naval Architect\'s Manual -- lots and lots of deckplan pieces to
                                copy and piece together for the
                                ships you create with or without
                                FFSv2, a few weird things and
                                inconsistent scales, but could still
                                be pretty useful with a scanner and
                                a lot of cut and pasting
                                
5.  Central Supply Catalog -- lots of equipment, computer rules, and
                              a vehicle design system of moderate
                              complexity that is pretty good, but
                              mostly incompatible with FFS (and
                              every other Traveller system)
                              
6.  Emperor\'s Arsenal -- lot\'s of weapons and combat rules
                         extensions, I wanted a design system for
                         weapons in here and didn\'t get one, ;-< but
                         it\'s not too bad
                         
...I just can\'t recommend any of the other books.

All IMO, of course, and make sure you get the errata from whatever
web site currently is up and has it.  Dave Golden? Joe Heck? ???

That would have to be worlds that never have been contacted by the Imperium
or any other gravtech capable culture. Building a beanstalk can NEVER be
cheaper than importing antigrav from TL 8+ worlds (IMHO and IMTU gravtech
doesn\'t arrive until TL 10+ and then pretty weak)

They could be ... oh, and Ditzie notes that the rounds are actually 144mm
rather than 120. She still had the propellent in the CPR gun cases.

This means the gun itself has to be a bit bigger, but the system is so
dominated by the power systems that this doesnt really matter.

I\'ll post the corrected version tonight.

The problem is that at TL9, the tanks will have individual point-defense
systems (at least if FS is anywhere near the contract), allowing them to
shred a lot of incoming artillery fire. 

Against TL7 or 8, sure.

Funnily enough, thats one of her favorite hobbies.

Seriously, it was designed as a weapon capable of rapid, semi-sustainable
fire. I was pissed off at the one-shot-per-20 seconds standard, and a gauss
gun seemed to fit the bill.

Unfortunatly, the cost and size seem to make it untenable in the planned
role of a MBT weapon.

1) "current uniforms" means current for G:T, so 1120 or something?

2) I want an IGS patch!  I\'ve played variants of the same ex-IGS
character in a few campaigns (a 5FW vet with a little post-traumatic
stress disorder and two ex-wives to look for or maybe hide from), and I
have just the hat for it (black cotton North Face baseball cap ... or
maybe the black BDU combat cap ... hmm).  

Anyway, nice work on the IISS heraldry.

Into the enemy tank :-)

The heat theoretically doesn\'t get transferred thru the magnetic "bottle"
 the one with a hole in it pointing at the enemy tank every second or so) very
much, especially if the space containing the field is evacuated so the barrel
doesn\'t  get too hot, except perhaps round the contact point for the vacuum

That\'s laid out in Book 6: Scouts, I think.  The 8-legged beast is in

Weeee reckon-weckon that if youuuu put a biggie-wiggie probe-wobe into the
uuuuuuser, then then then you could take advantage of the heat
differential-wifferential between the inteeeeerior of the uuuuser an an an

uuuuuser by threeeee degweees, then you could get the power-wower to help
out the weeeeeeasels.

But but but accuuuumulators an batterwies are cheap, an an an the Total

An an an some of our customer-wustomers are worried about that.

an an an costs about fiiiiiifteeen kilocwedits.

The auuuutoloader maaaases nine hunnerd kiiiilos, an an an costs nine

The theeeeoretical wate of fire is fifty roundie-woundie-woundies per

neeeeeeedles).

Power-wower demand (an an an I wanna make sure I have this right) 

muzzle energy = (warhead mass in kg/2000000) X (muzzle velocity in
m/sec)^2

The waaaarhead masses 30 kiiilos, an an an the muzzle velocity is 4000 m/s,
so the energy-wenergy demand is 30/2000000* (4000)^2 =
30/2000000*16000000=30*8=240 megajoules.

Now, techie-wechie 9 maaassss driver-wivers have efficiency of of of 3.6,

sooooo much that that that it shouldnt matter.

Miiiichael tells me I hafta-wafta do this riiiight, so so so damage at

Wow. So much for Gauss being a low-cost alternative to CPR guns.

Mind you, it\'s a monster.

That rapid-fire capability ... ewwwww. You\'d hate to be caught in enfilade
by one of these beasts poking it\'s turret over the hill.

It would be a bit of a curiousity, becuase you can build a much better can
opener at TL10 with big fusion guns. I dare say some of them would see
service as artillery in TL10 and up militaries - that 100 km indirect fire
range is pretty nice, especially if it\'s launching individually
redirectable missiles.

It also has applications in starport defense, being able to overwhelm many
vessels\' point defense with a huge wave of very hard-hitting shells.

Dont even think about what it could do to an army without point-defense.

We\'ve got the Famile Spofulam TL9 150 mm gun built, and she\'s reasonably
happy with it.

However, what is getting her really pissed off is the FS 120 mm Rapid Fire
Mass Driver, specifically the fact that the 120 mm HEAP warhead appears to
have a pentration value of about 500.

Can someone please calculate the DV of a 120 mm and a 150 mm HEAP round at
TL9 ?

OK. The FS 150 mm HVAP Smoothbore Gun. 

Consisting of a 9m long barrel, an autloader for the 50kg SEFOP
electro-thermal shells, an imaging radar for fire control and full
stabilisation, the FS 150mm is able to throw a shell every 70 seconds for a
power demand of 50 kilowatts.

The shells have a short range of 690 meters, for a DV of 202. The
penetration drops off with range, to 187 at Medium, 159 at Long and 103 at
Extreme range (I guess Medium is 1.4km, Long 2.8km and Extreme 5.6 km).

6.3 tons in mass all up and costing KCr 878, a loadout of 20 shells will
result in a total unit of 7.3t and KCr 898.

Note the weapon can be constructed at any TL9 world, so the cost in
Imperial Credits should be substantially lower.

It looks like a decent gun, but I think we need to do some thinking about
point defense - specifically, firing at incoming rounds.


****************************************************************************
******

The first effective point defense systems come in at TL7/8 for defense
against slow missiles. Too big for ground vehicles, they see service on wet
navy vessels.

At about TL9, point defense systems on ground vehicles usher in the end of
the Missile Era, although experiments are conducted with small fusion guns
mounted on drone grav missiles.

At TL10, point defense systems become effective enough to enable
counterfire against solid projectiles.

Well, I\'m going into a local badge manufacturer tomoorrow to see how much
they\'ll charge to produce the Exploration Branch badges.

I\'m gonna shove velcro on the back, so that I can wear my old flight jacket,
place the branch patch where my squadron patch used to go, and the office
patch where the aerobatic team patch goes, and wear my normal name patch.  I
wonder how long it will take people to notice the badges are different and the
text is in Bilandin ?

Hadn\'t thought of the cap, largely because caps aren\'t particularly common on
a flight line, but that would be another place to put one. Now, all we need is
the T-shirt design for the Spinward Marches Exploration Branch Grav-Ball team
or some other T-Shirt design suitable for a scout

( why does a Led Zeppelin or Harley Davidson t-shirt, or that black one with
the words "Shit Happens" in large friendly letters seem appropriate ? )

And what brand of flight boots does an Imperial Scout wear ?
Do they have Nomex flight suits in the IISS ?

I already have the unkempt beard, the Pilot sunglasses, the jeans, and the
insanity .

Do not buy this.

Go on to the net and head for 

	http://www.truserve.com/~igor/traveller/index.htm

The website of St Akins. :-)

From there you can get a spreadsheet to make FFS2 so much easier to use.
Also there are links to the Gearhead webring and deckplans webring.

The deckplans on the net have a good chance of having the right volume
for the equipment and not putting 400std in a 200std ship or the
ship\'s captain in a shoebox and other such "artistic features"

>FFSv2

must have erata from the net.

>and a fourth book.

To go forth and meet creatures, Aliens Archive.

For equipment, consider either Central Supply Catalog
or Emperor\'s Arsenal. It depends if your group needs more variety
in "stuff" or just weapons.

For the only decent adventure - The Long Way Home + Gateway.

For plot stuff, just buy all the 101 books from BITS

	http://www.bits.org.uk/

I would stronly recommend looking around the web.

There is apparently a very good links website with ratings
and descriptions and stuff.

Unfortunately I don\'t have it bookmarked. :-(

Nope, these beasts were called a poni and the (Solomani?) guy that was to
name the X-Boat network had heard of some kind of relay riding scheme were
the riding beasts bore a similar name. Language confusion.
They might be from Sylea but it was their names not their use that got them
famous.

I remember the Valmet.  It made a good appearance in some movie about two
survivalists back in the 80\'s.  I forgot the name of it.

Oh!  The James Bond book "IceBreaker" is set in Finland quite a bit.  It is
written by John Gardner.

As an older Old Traveller Fart than Charles, I feel qualified to comment
on this :-)

The following is my opinion only, and subject to change without notice.

Most good refs can manage a few off-the-cuff situations, but the best refs
I\'ve seen have combined good improv skills with _lots_ of preparation for
the routine stuff. This has several advantages:

i) Saves improv for when the players deviate from the prepared path.

ii) Helps ensure consistency, and helps the ref remember everything
(important when running a ten-year, once-a-month campaign with players
more intelligent than oneself).

iii) Helps ensure truly creative encounters--my players, at least, are
good at spotting filed-off serial numbers :-)


Different referees have different styles, but I prefer to have as much as
possible prepared ahead of time. I use computers to do the bulk
generation, leaving me free to concentrate on plot, character, and
atmosphere. As I never throw anything away, I also have almost two cubic
metres of Traveller material to draw on, as well.

That said, my best games have been ones where the players deviated from
the \'script\' almost immediately. I was improvising like hades, but because
I had a large stock of preprepared locations and NPCs I was free to
concentrate on adding to the fun, rather than remembering what colour the
bartender\'s hair was (my NPC descriptions include physical details). The
players didn\'t notice that they were venturing into \'unexplored
territory\', and even found \'clues\' in some chance remarks. (Which I worked
into the plot post-facto, because their reasoning made sense.)

I can understand your loyalty to the big apple, but let\'s all hope that the
Intrepid doesn\'t get her.  Unless something has changed recently, the
behaviour of the Intrepid\'s management is shameful.  In the early 90\'s
Intrepid started to host various sorts of corporate parties and events.
They found that acting as a disco is much more profitable than being a
museum.  But all those airplanes got in the way of dancing. So they\'ve got
rid of them.  Intrepid used to have a very fine collection of aircraft, but
no more.  his has irritated lots of people and many of the other contributed
displays (small artifacts, scale models, etc.) on Intrepid have been removed
by the respective owners. And lest civilian accountant-bean counter types be
blamed for this sacrilege, the person in charge of Intrepid at this time
(and the chief culprit) was a retired marine general.  I remember reading
newpaper article at the time (a few years ago) where the general brushed
aside criticism of an Air and Space Museum dismantling its aircraft
collection by remarking that Intrepid is a private organization and must
watch it\'s bottom line.  

Now this information is a few years old, an Intrepid\'s management and
behaviour may have changed, but I\'ve not heard any news to that effect.  

So let\'s all hope that NJ goes to Jersey City.  Somehow, the New Jersey
being preserved as a museum in New Jersey seems appropriate.  And from NYC,
you would still be able to see her (in fact, she may hide some of Jersey
City!), and the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Ferries will be able to take
you there from the Battery.   

Traveller connection:  what happens to old naval ships in the imperium after
the imperial, reserve, and mothball fleets are through with them?  I imagine
that most are either sold for scrap or to other political
entities/megacorps.  Are any particularly famous ships preserved as museums?
And how does one display a 100K ton non streamlined vessel?  Just
permamently moored at a major High Port?

IIRC.  The Nemisis?-Class cruiser or destroyer or something from CT possessed
Jump-Torpedo\'s.  Personally I think that a lot of the "rules" for starship creation
are just plain silly.

Why only one turret per 100 tons?  Imperial Law perhaps, but if you can cram 3
turrets into a 100 ton design why not, you\'re obviously not designing a cargo ship
or civillian transport, it\'s a purely military vessel.  As long as you take the
additional mass into account in your thrust to weight ratio, go nuts.

Why can ships over 100 ton\'s possess a Jump Drive.  Again rediculous but probably
tied to Imperial Law.  Smaller vessels are harder to see so if 10 10ton jump
capable fighters precipitated in your system they\'d be harder to find than a single
100 dt ship.  But seeing as the minimum volume for a JD is way under the minimum
volume required for a 100dt ship it must be possible.

Perhaps the "Smoking Man" is involved in this conpsiracy to hide the truth from
loyal Travellers.

It\'s Hyphen\'s Jump Points, from his excellent website:

http://www.tip.net.au/~davidjw/

His site is a wonderful resource for any Traveller fan, referee or 
player.  I give it Five Sunbursts, or a Jump-6 rating, if he goes to 
Jump ratings as he\'s mentioned in the past.

Hope this helps.

I realise that now.  Dead pan humor and sarcasim does not come across email
very well.

\'The bar\'/inn has been a fixture of all to many games I\'ve played in.
Everyone uses it in pick up games or to fast start a new group.  I\'ve always
done my best in campains to make \'the bar\' an interesting place.  Sometimes
a very scary place.  If it is to be the \'gangs\' hangout it should have some
personality.  If it is just an inn on the road to somewhere more interesting
then I just say, \'You find lodging for the night.  The night passes without
incident and you continue your journey at dawn.\'

The discription I gave was intended to be part of a climactic scene, not an
everyday occurence. The main character in that scene was leaving the game
(due to real life intruding) and deserved a proper send off.  He rejoined
the group a few months later with a difference character.

Yes, the auther pointed out that it was suppose to be parody.  Parody and
sarcassim do not come accross well on email.  The y depend on exageration
and/or tone of voice to \'que\' the lissener in most cases.  These ques do not
come accross well in email.

To me, the first time I read it and now that I reread it, the post seems to
be a serious attempt to say the GURPS lacked originality.  My responce was a
serious one intent to show that originallity cames from the GM and his
efforts to entertain and chalenge the players not from a game system.
Perhaps I am being unusually dense today or it could be because I have
played under GMs that treat NPC like they were discribed in this parody.  I
never liked GMs that blow off detail and personality in favor of hack and
slash style gaming and I have seen it all to often for my taste.

How many GMs have you played under that made you fell like you knew the NPC
in the same way that you know the people you deal with in the real world?
Almost any GM can run combat.  It take a special person to make a world come
alive.

Or maybe "Property of Rhylanor Jump Institute Athletic Department" in

Or even "I made First Contact at (insert world/subsector here) and

Sounds cool.  You might also consider something from the "Laser 
Dancer" nugget posted a few months back.  A concert T-shirt from a 
futuristic group or entertainment style would be cool, but probably 
too expensive.

Remember the tailored IISS vacc suit/uniforms from GS/GC and MT.

Now, that conjures a better image for an Exploration Scout.  Cool!

How about a separate table or dice-roll, that tells you how many times to
roll on the ethnic table?  If all your rolls happen to hit the same
ethnicity, then you\'re one of those boring monocultural people who only
get to celebrate one set of holidays a year :-)

Seriously, that depends on whether your future history has nationalities
being preserved or not. _My_ Traveller universe doesn\'t, but that reflects
my personal experiences (and bias).

This _is_ something I think about every time I consider moving outside
Toronto. Vancouver seems fairly reasonable, and there\'s always Trinidad...
(Judging by my friends and their relatives here, Trinidadians seem like
singularly tolerant people--and the women are all drop-dead gorgeous! Not
a representative sample, I\'ll admit.)

Among the many things I have to thank my grandparents for is the way they
raised my parents _without_ the casual racism that was common in Britain.
Life alone among the anglos would be so frigging _boring_!

Yep. I don\'t subscribe to the view that everything in the OTU is on a
planet...IMTU, probably as many people live in orbital or LaGrange habs
as do on the ground...after all the main world is this toxic, cold,
nearly airless and waterless dumpsite of a world with just some mines to
recommend it...where are YOU gonna live? Down _there_ or up in the nice
clean, warm, well conditioned air of the orbital cities? (and this
doesn\'t _count_ the belts...look at Glisten...)

The OTU has had over 6000 years of experience with space travel...I
would _think_ they\'ve gotten the hard bits figured out about keeping
cities alive in orbit.

Communication is no longer when the next ship shows up - you can
simply have a orbital base popping off jump torpedoes. Every important 
starship would have one (or more), set to automatically launch - no more
lost treasure ships or vanished task forces.

Why only one turret per 100 tons?  Imperial Law perhaps, but if you can cram 3

Something of a handwave here - perhaps a combination of standardized

can handle the waste heat from - and when one gets damaged, it takes

Physics of jumspace, probably. It takes a volume of 100 dtns to be able to

a big enough hole to be stable, causing no jump or catastrophic misjump?

Make that devastation of the equator of the planet.  That beanstalk is

Seeing as TSR just released the AD&D CD-ROM, ver. 2.0, I think this is a
good time to say that I\'d love to see FFS3 come with a CD-ROM with
spreadshhets for the various design sequences.

Hell, I\'d love to see a Traveller CD-ROM that contained .pdfs of the rules,
had Referee-aid software, and all the spreadsheets.  You could put in
pregenerated forms like those found in Supplement 12.. all sorts of stuff.

And the nice thing is that most of us on the list would contribute work
just to make Traveller better.

Pictures.  Right.  We got a lecture on what we could not do.  No pictures.
No sketches.  We were searched before being allowed into the demo area.
GSG9 is as paranoid as SEAL Team 6 or the SAS.

We did get a chance to mingle, and one of their snipers joked that if they
had been operational during WWII, their first mission would have been to
elminate Patton.

Even further, Callahans exists as a newsgroup and IRC channel.  I\'m the

Perhaps such vessels could be converted by lower-tech worlds and serve as
orbiting stations/habitats. A 100k ship has a lot of space (especially if 
you take out the jump drive as unneeded), and as long as the frame is
intact, it\'s still pretty useful.

Be careful here, Frank.  If it were just up to me, I\'d say, "Go for it!"
However, this material is all officially copyright 1999, Steve Jackson
Games, Inc.  That means no part or component may copied without express
prior consent of a qualified representative of SJG.  Further, Loren
indicated to me that, while the art in the "First In" supplement would
all be grey scale, the color versions were required in case SJG decided
to do patches for commercial release.  Given the interest on this list,
perhaps a flood of letters demanding patches would be a better idea.
If SJG has them produced en-mass, they can almost certainly do it for
less than if you have it done as a one-off.

Now *this* sounds like a kick-ass idea!  I\'ll get right on it.  BTW,

I agree, This is the best method.  I did not mean to say that a secion
should be run off-the-cuff.  Most times I have a prepared storyline and a
few dozen near by locations plus all the other locations that have been
created before IF the player are on their on home ground.

Very true.

Yes.  It is hard keeping consistance with a long running game with long
breaks.  Besides the material created for each adventure a GM diary is
usefull.  That way if you have to create a personallity off the cuff you can
make note of him and his location JIC the PC need to look him up later.

Sounds like my \'gaming room\'.  I have most of the CT adventures.  The
original publishes advantures, autherized adventures, magazine adventure,
and fan created stuff.

Sound like something that happened to me.  I ran a hostage rescue type
adventure using the floor plans and location from research station gamma as
the \'secret bad guy abandoned military base\'.  They took a totally diferent
approach than I planned for.  They researched the place thoughly including
securing the aid of and civilian once employed as a maintence worker at the
base before it closed.  They blew the power plant and stole the air rafts
and then froze the bad guys out after arranging to prevent the arrival of
their excape ship (Seased due to (planted) contraband and an anonomous tip).
The PCs never fired a shot.

Taking this as a jumping point, can I ask that folks name their traveller
pages something other than simply "Traveller"?

I went to update my links page, and the vast majority of these pages were
named in this manner, and it makes it very hard to set up interesting
links, or even keep track of which page I\'m jumping to.  At the least, name
it "<your name>\'s Traveller Page.

Thank you.

I think that we could probably get a pretty good order up.  Find out what

When I was but a lad, I would get a custom t-shirt for my birthday.  Soon
after Alien Book 4 came out, we went to Dale\'s Shirt Wheel, and I got a t
that declared Tavrchsedle\' in big black letters.  Confused the clerk.  To

Actually, if you design the ship paying attention to surface area, you
find the 1 turret per 100 dtons is a reasonable approximation to what you
can actually install. 

TNE did away with the 1/100 limit, but added surface area, so that you had
another constraint on your design. Add more weapons, but then you have
less surface area for drives and sensors. Made for interesting trade-offs.

They are in reserve status because of money and manpower issues.  Because
the Navy failed to update the engineering and firecontrol systems when they
modernized the ships in the eighties it requires a disproportional number of
sailors to man these ships.  The enginerooms and firerooms could have been
updated with the same technology that allows power companies to keep seventy
year old steam power plants in operation today with a fraction of the people
it took to operate them when they were built.
In the face of declining manpower and money the Navy could not continue to
operate these ships.

	Thanks very much, Cliff...  I have a lot of fun doing this stuff,
so its my favorite hobby from both a gaming and web-work POV.

The cost to cut through the armor belt to access engineering would have been
prohibitive - not to mention that the skill set needed to weld that armor
has been lost.  From what I understood, anything less than a full conversion
to BBN was not practical.

The fire control suite was upgraded, what was not was the ammunition
handling systems.  After the IOWA turret incident, I saw some documentation
about converting the main guns from bagged powder to a injected 2-component
plastic explosive propellent, but the decision to decommission the four BBs
was made instead.

It is a sad truth that the BBs are TL5 relics in a TL8 world.  I\'ve always
regretted that I did not tour the IOWA when we were moored across from her.

Plus there\'s always the old faithful prison hulk. Imagine trying to escape
from something like that! Tough enough to swim the freezing San Francisco
Bay from Alcatraz, but how the heck are you gonna escape from a block of
metal in space? I don\'t imagine personal reentry kits are found by the
dozen on an orbital prison facility.

Make that devastation of the equator of the planet.  That beanstalk is

Depends where the cable breaks. Also, recall that the cable is moving at
orbital speed (it\'s connected to a geosynchronous anchor) - it\'s not going
to "stay still" while the planet turns under it, it\'s going to maintain some
of it\'s orbital velocity as it falls. Still, that many tons of stuff at fall-from
- -orbit velocity...

How long is this beanstalk cable, anyway? If you broke it at the base,
would the geosynch anchor pull it away "safely"?

Loren.



The deadline\'s the 29th of this month or sooner.



This one\'s for a cover.



This one\'s going to have LIVE people on the cover (HOPEFULLY).



This one I REALLY need YOUR help with if you\'re up to it.  Here\'s the deal.
This is for the G:T "Starports" book (yeah, this is the first I\'ve heard of
it too as far as I can remember).  I\'ll have more specifics a little later,
but what I\'m looking for is people that have or can improvise reasonable
costumes of any race, culture, etc.  Special bonus points :) for
non-humanoid, non-Star Trek foam-on-nose, aliens.  Then I\'d need you to take
some pictures following specific directions as to where you place the
camera, how many degrees angled off from centerline, how many degrees the
camera is tilted, height of the camera, preferred lighting conditions, etc.
And I\'d need the pictures as soon as humanly (alienly? :) possible.  What
will happen then is that I\'ll photocomposite those pictures over 3d
renderings of whatever environment we create for the shot.  The basic
environment will already be created when I send out the specifications of
angles to the individual participants.  Ideally, the pictures that you take
should be from a tripod and against a brightly lit (i.e. fully sunlit)
light-colored seamless background, such as a large bedsheet.  REALLY ideally
you\'d be able to take the pictures against a blue or green screen ala
Industrial Light and Magic, but I shan\'t hold my breath on that score :)

About the only credit I can guarentee you is "Thank you to ......" in the
upcoming biliography section of my webpage and my undying thanks.  Maybe a
"thanks to the TML\'ers" message in the inside cover, but no gurantees on
that one as I\'d have to get Loren to do it.  No pay is involved.  Sorry, I
don\'t make THAT much off of the artwork :)  You\'d be doing it for the
greater good of Traveller (and the kick of having your picture [from
whatever angle] on the cover for all posterity :)


The environment is going to be along the flightline and terminal area of a
starport.  Specifics beyond that I don\'t have yet as I\'m still doing
pre-production sketches.  What I\'m mainly looking for is people who can look
like ground personnel, mechanics, security, etc.  Alas, I\'m nowhere near
production of vac-formed combat armor so I can\'t have any heavy security
prescense.  Damn! :)  Depending on how the "movie set" ends up, I may need
some pedestrian images as well (Roger\'s got a VERY cool one for that, but
I\'d need more as well).

If you\'re interested and think (better yet KNOW) you can contribute, please
drop me a line at fenris@slip.net.  If you\'ve got a brainstorm idea, you may
want to post it to the list as well to get other\'s creative juices flowing.
While I\'m posting the novel here, let me take the time to give everyone on
the TML a hearty "THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT"!!!!!  Everyone\'s
been a tremendous help over the past few months with comments and scans
support for reference material that I didn\'t have.  Your comments keep me
going full-tilt-boogie on this stuff and I\'m having a grand ol\' time!!!

IMTU (one of \'em, anyway, very non-canon, with no Imperium in 
sight), the first jump-capable exploration ship built by humans, 
_Pathfinder_, was a museum piece. As it was only a couple of 
hundred years old, it turned out that most of the important parts 
still worked. One of the PCs took a job as curator and maintainer, 
and over a period of months, did whatever midnight requisitioning 
and "restoration work" was needed to get the ship flyable. The 
PC party wound up fleeing an alien invasion in it. 

> And how does one display a 100K ton non streamlined vessel?  Just
> permamently moored at a major High Port?  

I imagine so. Maybe you bring it down to the surface in a 500Kt 
streamlined cargo ship (!), unload it in the water, and moor it next 
to its namesake, a TL6 wet navy carrier.

About the size of it. Without a towed array, you\'re stuffed for ASW.

Right. The insulation gives off a toxic, obscuring smoke (and is hard to

I think, realistically, that SHEFFIELD would have been scrapped after
examination to work out what happened. Mind you, SOUTHAMPTON was
repaired after a serious knock in the Gulf.

ObTrav: Rules for fixing battle damage? What proportion of battle damage
is temporary (thrown breakers, minor glitches, power brownout induced
crashes et al) and how much is serious (Star-trek style exploding
panels?)

because with a ski-jump the aircraft never gets fired into the water by
a poorly timed catapult stroke; and it\'s far, far easier to stop then
land on a pitching deck than to land and then try to stop.

20,000 tons for an Invincible class CVS.

ObTrav: Carriers in space don\'t have this problem. But can they launch
fighters (and can a Battle Tender launch it\'s Battle Riders) when it\'s
using fuel scoops in a GG?

I think you have that backwards. The USN classifies ship by size and
capability. Small and cheap is a frigate; medium is a destroyer, large
and expensive is a cruiser.

The RN classifies by role - Frigates do ASW, Destroyers do Area AAW. You
can also look to the Type numbers - Type 2x is an ASW escort (thus a
Frigate); Type 4x is an AAW Escort (thus a destroyer).

>Ob Trav: How does the major interstellar navies classify their ships?

By size and role.

I was thinking more along the lines of `heavy steel\' - probably a mash
of 1914, before the submarine could be relied on in fleet actions (they
tended to attack, and be attacked by, their own sides), and before the
aircraft was a serious threat; - but with the sensors and communications
of 1942-era ships.

Not true. The UAA-1 system was perfectly capable of detecting both the
Argave radar on the Super Entendard and the Exocet terminal seeker.
Classification as friend or foe is done by the operator.

Patton was given much more credit by the German General Staff than
the Allied General Staff did.

It is arguable that his greated foe in WWII wasn\'t Rommel but,
Montgomery.

There was a Pyramid article on Time Travel missions that had the heros
trying to shorten WWII by trying to get more theatre command to Patton,
and less to Monty.

And if you feel \'imaginationally challenged\', you could get hold of 101
Travellers and 101 Rendezvous, part of the BITS 101 series. Travellers has
101 npcs, actually designed for shipboard use, but also ideal for a
Starport encounter. Rendezvous has 101 different locations to meet - bars,
hotels and so on. Great for a Ref in a hurry, and available now from SJG in
North America, and all good games shops in the UK.

I\'m sure British Aerospace will happily let Colt make some of the weapons
under licence, and just have H&K make a proportion.

Ok, Sister. Or, at the risk of snaking off somewhere else, should that be
Sibling? ;-)

Giving Ground to your Logic, I\'d better do Something Fast to avoid being
caught between A Rock and A Hard Place. Hopefully, having admitted I Was
Wrong, there will be some way to Fix The Damage Done before my reputation
is torn to Ribbons. When You Don\'t See Me commenting on this thread any
More, you\'ll know I\'ve struck my Colours, becoming Some Kind of Stranger to

Yes - don\'t buy MO and First Survey Separately.

No - it\'s very poor - SSDS is broken and a fixed version of it (and QSDS)

much better deck plans.

If you like that sort of thing. Make sure you get the errata.

I would buy Central Supply Catalog (Equipment, Computers and Vehicles) and
Emperor\'s Arsenal. Next I would buy Psionic Institutes. Following that I
would buy Aliens Archive and Pocket Empires.

I would not buy: First Survey, Starships, The Annililik Run, Missions of
State, Emperor\'s Vehicles or Anomalies.

I\'d also buy 101 Travellers, 101 Rendezvous, 101 Cargos and 101 Lifeforms
as a starter. But as I write for BITS I\'d take this bit with a pinch of
salt.

If you want more info, contact me off list.

I actually pictured Ditzie as a twelve to thirteen year old child 
genius/idot savant with intense conceptual understanding of 
weapon-based engineering, a speech impediment (her brain works faster 
than her mouth, and is usually thinking about her next "toy"), and 
extremely limited people skills.

Kinda like a preteen Elmyra with a fixation for weapons instead of 
animals.  :)

I can just imagine this little girl in a white mini-dress with purple 
polka dots, and purple tights underneath, picking up this massive 
gun almost half her size in the middle of her excited lecture to 
potential buyers, and blowing away some nearby building at an 
obstacle course/shooting range, narrowly missing the cluster of 
technicians in front of the small tower.  She doesn\'t even notice in 
her excitement, but keeps on going with her discussions of the 
weapon\'s capacities.  The crew around her, knowing her 
predispositions, runs to help the technician hit by flying shrapnel 
- -after she puts the weapon down-, all while the buyers are watching 
on in either shock or amusement.

That\'s kinda how I picture Ditzie.  YMMV.

        Hi, again, Rob!  This sounds like a good way to do it....  So, how about

        4-5 ...  Each parent from different ethnic backgrounds (roll twice

        ...Given that we\'re only talking about little more than a century
from now, having 50% of parents from the same background seems to make
sense, with the other 50% being poly-cultural.

        Given that nationalism has been entrenched in people\'s mindsets
(take the Balkans... they are fighting about countries which haven\'t existed
for half a century), I figure it will take more than a century (3-4
generations) to beat it out of Terran collective conciousness.  Heck, IMTU,
they\'ve even fought a war over the issue...

        The problem with this statement is that while *I* am willing to surf
the Net and dig up a real name for someone from Tahiti (NPC in my TNEC PBEM
game is named Te-\'ura), most folks aren\'t.  When the ref adds "Ethnic"
flavour to the game, people work from the minds eye...  Skin colour, typical
hair-color, body-frame, etc.  So, to some degree, while my table does not
say "You are from a Black North American Heritage, therefore you are
ebony-skinned", I am sure some folks will read it that way...  Because that
is their experience.

        Here\'s an example...  another NPC from TNEC PBEM:

        This is actually one reason I might be moving *to* Toronto/ GTA.  I

Cool idea, but it seems kind of pricey just for keeping prisoners on, what
with life support, supply delivery, etc. Unless it was some kind of
self-sustaining biosphere and the prisoners had to keep *themselves*

I hear you.  Thankfully FF&S got rid of most of em.  J-torps are mentioned
somewhere else, too IIRC.

Another one that you\'ve hit on the head.  It\'s an obviously artificial limit.
Course, pre FF&S, designs didn\'t detail surface area or anything, so this
could be an abstraction of that (though I don\'t think that\'s the case).  If
you can get it to fit, there\'s no reason it shouldn\'t be on there.

Again, an obviously artificial limit and one that\'s hardly been religiously
kept.  3 of 4 versions of Traveller have exceptions to the 100dt rule (FF&S is
explicit in allowing jump ships of less than 100dt).  As far as G:T... anyone
want to try a Jump Torp w/ G:V?  The key to J-torps is to have them not be as
reliable (or desired) as the X-boat network.  Course, the Imperium is ashes is
IMC, so it\'s all ancient history...   Perhaps the Imp bureacracy and/or
Emperor are favorable to a powerful X-boat lobby.

It doesn\'t *have to* have any adverse effect when T-plates don\'t.  You might
want to introduce such effects, but it isn\'t necessary (or desirable).  HEPLaR
isn\'t a fusion drive, after all.

Yeah.  It\'s easy to handwave either way.  *Nothing* in any TNE material would
change if T-plates from FF&S are used instead of HEPlaR.

Well if Virus infection was a problem w/ T-plates, the Regency would probably
retrofit, too.

For MTU, I\'ve put T-plates (FF&S vintage) as TL17.  R&D is going on at
Vincennes.  Course, my Regency campaigns have never fully materialized, so the
possiblities have been left unexplored...

The map is easily dispensed w/ too (though it never is, because we all like
it).  The map was always out on the table (usually only 1 when there wasn\'t a
combat situation).  I would tell them the range and approximate vectors of any
bogeys and if they decided to do something bout it, then some others would get
unfolded.

Ah ok.  lol.  Much more clear.  MMDV.  ;-)   All of the complexity is fairly
easily modular.  The task system is about as easy as they come.  Recoil, etc
etc isn\'t necessary, though was desirable for me and my group coming off\'ve
Star Wars.  If we wanted simple, we\'d have stayed w/ SW.

  Ive done a whole pile of ships with FF&S1 (for a guy who does them with
pencil paper & calculator) from a 5 D.ton assault boat to several thousand
D.ton liner (that was for 2300AD, though), and Ive never come even close
to running out of hull surface.

  As far as surface area goes its pretty easy to cram a dozen or more
turrets into a 100 D.ton design, finding power for the weapons is another
matter entirely. Even if you mount missile turrets, there comes a point
where they eat up so much internal volume, that you no longer have room
for drives, fuel etc. (Which might be a bit of a drag.)

But how do roles vary? There are no specialized "submarines" to attack.
In non-capital ships (<=10,000 tons) I suppose a distinction can be made
between ships optimized for attacking fighters, or other non-capital ships,
or capital ships, with armament varying accordingly. Imperial naval doctrine
in the canon sources seems to be that only capital ships fight other capital
ships; smaller ships are "escorts" of one kind or another, optimized for
engaging their smaller brethren. This is fair enough (and a legitimate
consequence of most Traveller combat systems, especially High Guard) but
implies that other navies don\'t work that way - the Solomani or Zhodani or
Vargr must have small ships designed for attacks against capital ships
(mostly missiles.) If I were a ship designer I would reserve the
"destroyer" name for ships with some anti-capital-ship punch, "escort" 
or "frigate" for others.

Kim Stanley Robinson Mars trilogy (Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars) has a
falling beanstalk in it. It shows just how much damage it coud really
cause. Simply because a beanstalk has to reach a geostationary orbit makes
it unbelievably long, and if it is cut near it\'s upper end, it\'s far end
will reach _very_ high velocity before impacting with the surface.

It _has to_ as long as its a simple reaction drive, because the power output of
a reaction drive has a lower limit of (jet velocity) * (thrust).  As a HEPLaR
thruster has an exhaust velocity of between .05 and .1 c (I don\'t recall
exactly, its equal to <thrust in newtons> / <fuel usage in kilograms per
second>) this works out to around 10 megawatts per newton.  Your minimal HEPLaR
thruster is 100,000 newtons, which works out to one terawatt of power output --
the equivalent of a 0.2 kiloton micronuke, every second.  This will have nasty
effects on the environment...

This is the first time I have had a moment to sit down and compose any sort of missive to the TML. Apologies for being off the air - I haven\'t even had time to read any of the TML (from #266 to #291 !!) so I don\'t know if the Debate has been cancelled or not. Too bad, even if it has, I am still working on chiselling "Stephen Alkell" into something resembling order before I post his reply. Was this Strephon\'s problem - too many things going on to cover every one adequately? The old J-O-T dilemma?

Anyway, on to the announcement (and reason for my delayed reply):
	"David and Leanne are pleased to announce the arrival of their
	second child, James Alan. Weighing in at 8 lb 3 oz*, he came
	into the world at 8.12 am on Saturday 6 March 1999. Mother
	pleased with the 5-hour labour (beats the previous 22hr ordeal)."

And yes, pics WILL be posted to the webpage shortly, just as soon as I
finish my complete revamp of my site. Gee, I may even get around to

As such, it mostly, IMO, pointed up the biggest misconception
about GURPS.  GURPS is about generic "rules" not generic background.
That is the point that many miss when they read the rules.

Unless arty improves significantly it isn\'t a serious threat to armor, much
less grav armor, and point defense isn\'t needed for a line MBT, though
possibly specialized support units might maintain some.  

Arty needs fire direction.  Odds are incredibly against a ranging shot (much
less a blind barrage) landing on a tank.  You seen one round plop in front of
you, then another plop behind you, you\'re in deep do-do.  lol.  When you see
those ranging shots, you button up and notify on the net that arty has been
observed, and it location by coordinates (NOT "someones shooting at us!",
which will only get a full barrage put on you when the enemy commanders tell
their arty to keep doing whatever their doing) and then you go to high speed
and spread out, having manuever/recon elements search obvious locations for
the forward observer/ fire director and ruin his whole day.  Meanwhile Air
looks for a puff of smoke or something indicative of where the arty shots are
coming from and either delivers their own ordnance or tells friendly arty
where to put their ranging shots.

This brings to mind grav armor tactics.  In general, in today\'s TL8 military
realities, if you hit an aircraft, it goes down.  Aircraft survive by speed
and manueverability, not their ability to take punishment.  Of course, there
are exceptions (A-10 comes to mind), but it\'s gotta be alot different for
Traveller.  Grav tanks can take a pounding and dish it out too, and seem
likely to render conventional artillery ineffective.  For that matter,
infantry would have to become more specialized, too, in favor of urban combat
and other specialized roles.  Grav armor tactics are probably a blend of
aircraft and armor tactics.  Combine flight, high speed, and massive armor and
firepower and you have something unlike anything we know of.  Heavily armed
and armored lift vehicles seem destined to be the queen of battle...

Does anyone familiar w/ OGRE or the Renegade Legion stuff by FASA have
anything relevant or any light to shed here?

Heh.  With radar detection, at the agility of a grav tank, you can just dodge
incoming artillery -- if it has a flight time of more than 2-3 seconds and
isn\'t self-guided, just forget about hitting.  Similar problem in the modern
day with naval cannons -- a 16" gun might be able to shoot twenty miles, but if
it takes 40 seconds to arrive that\'s enough time for a battleship to dodge. 
This basically suggests that \'artillery\' at traveller levels will either be
simple infantry support stuff with fairly short ranges (mortars are still
perfectly useful), have pretty smart terminal guidance systems, or be capable
of covering huge areas.

Sounds like a reasonable description of a helicopter gunship, except it\'s
tougher.  Tactically probably very similar, however.

I believe that the HIWG/Traveller CD mailing list is currently doing 
some of that very thing, putting together a new Traveller CD with all 
the old GDW stuff.  Don\'t know for certain, but their list traffic, 
while very low compared to the TML, does seem to indicate that.

Slight problem with the MT/DGP stuff.  Due to copyright legalese, 
etc, the MT/DGP stuff cannot be used verbatim.  The names and 
concepts can be used, but the material would have to be re-written, 
as the person who owns the rights to that material cannot be found 
to give his permission to do so.  Several people have posted about it 
here on the TML in the past.  That\'s the only thing I think that 
stands in the way.

At any rate, if you\'re really interested in seeing a Traveller 
Products CD happen, get on the Traveller CD mailing list and offer to 
help them out.  I\'m sure Brian would love the extra help on this 
project.

I would tend to disagree.  Extrapolating some of our current technologies, I
can see fin stabilized artillery munitions incorporating terminal guidence
and a variety of warhead packages to fit the shell to the job.  For example,
how about warheads incorporating chemical-powered lasers for stand-off
kills?  EW shells to provide jamming and deception services to the warhead
shells following?  Carrier shells that \'seed\' minefields with munitions
designed to damage/destroy the underside grav plates.  Carrier shells that
\'seed\' sensors over a large area.

These shells would not be cheap, but I think that many of the same
principles that we apply to ship-to-ship missiles are perfectly adaptable to
an environment where MBTs cost as much as a small starship.

Again, this assumes dumb shells.  Smart shells with internal guidence, or an
external targeting device feeding information to the shell would change the
whole concept of a \'ranging shot\'.  More likely, the first shot would be a
killing one.

Admitably, this is an environment where a FO would not have a long
lifespan - but then again, this is where the deployment of robotic FO\'s
armed with targeting lasers would be *very* cost effective.  Properly timed,
the first warning a MBT would have that it is being painted by a targeting
laser would be when the shell is already in the air and requiring terminal
guidence.  The shell would only need enough time with the laser to identify
the target, and lock on.  Still, I don\'t believe any given FO would be able
to paint many targets before being destroyed themselves.

With smartshells, harrassment fire could be considerably more deadly.  A
anti-armor shell is fired blind into any given area with several criteria to
search for - AFV, APC, bunker, etc...  It continues along it\'s ballistic
path until it finds a target that matches it\'s search criteria, then goes
into terminal mode.  Otherwise, it impacts at the end of it\'s flight - still
makes a boom and keeps people reminded that the Imperium loves them.

The other side of this, obviously, will be counters to the tactics I
described here.

Ditzie, what sort of clubs have you and your crechemates been going to?
Obviously things have moved beyond the placid days of the Fusion+ raves.

(This sounds sick and disgusting and highly appropriate for the late Third
Imperium.)

(And for what it\'s worth, I\'ve been picturing Ditzie all along as a
late-teenage shaven-headed creature of male sex if not gender, dressed out

In OGRE, the ground effect vehicle (GEV) is a high mobility unit
that inflicts a bit of damage and then scurries away.  Running in
wolf packs, they are deadly.  Careful tactics can even nit pick
an OGRE to death.

The ultimate expression of mobile death are the Mark XXXIII Bolos.
They combine the mobility of the grav tank and the durability of an
OGRE with the reflexes/accuracy of the best AIs known to man.
[Later Bolos used contra-gravity that allowed them to zip around
 the battle field at 500 kph.]

   "Joe Generio" was character used by one of the RPG trade rags a while back.
He was the "average character" used to test system rules.  In CT terms he had
stats of 777777.

- -- quote from MSNBC --

First compact \'fuel-cell\' car unveiled

March 17 -  DaimlerChrysler on Wednesday unveiled a
breakthrough on the road towards replacing gasoline and
the internal combustion engine with a power source that
emits only water vapor. For the first time, "fuel-cell"
technology has been made small enough to fit into a
compact car. The NECAR 4 concept car seats five, goes
280 miles before refueling, travels as fast as 90 mph and,
yes, emits only water vapor as an exhaust.

- -- end quote --

The NECAR 4 uses liquid hydrogen for fuel but production
models will probably use methanol due to cost and safety
issues. I mean, come on, can you really see trying to
skim a gas giant in a Chrysler? :-P

I\'d ignore the money aspect. Toronto is also a lot more expensive to live
in. Eg. my house cost almost $200k -- the same money in Ottawa would by me
an acreage, and still be closer to downtown.  Steve and Richard can give
you a better idea about Vancouver (which is a nicer place to live, too --
I\'m trying to move there).  But this is straying off-Traveller (unless

I\'m pretty late to this thread, so if this has already been mentioned,
forgive me. David Drake\'s "Hammer\'s Slammers" has a pretty excellent story
or two on using hovertanks. Now, these are more like hovercraft than grav
tanks. They don\'t fly like planes or anything. But they do go over just
about anything and they\'re quick. In particular, the short story,
"Hangman," from the first Slammers book comes to mind when visualizing grav
tank combat.

        The problem with this, Gary, is you missed the original gun\'s
spec...  4000m/sec flight speed with a hail range of 100km, with the shells
massing 30kgs and landing every 1.5 secs.  If the rounds were
laser-designated fin-steered (a la copperhead), your tank unit gets wiped
out in 30 seconds as 20 rounds each find targets with the destructive force
of a quarter ton of TNT per.
        The air force?  No puffs, because its a gauss weapon 100kms away
surrounded by SAM sites and interceptors.  
        Speed up and spread out?  Nope.  Those rounds are rolling in at
4000m/sec every 1.5 seconds.  The guy with the painter is under camo with
his designator a 1/2km away and can just keep painting you until he hits
you.  With each shell doing KEAP damage like a quarter-ton of TNT, even a
close miss is going to be giving your crews the heebee-geebees.  In an open
field, yeah, maybe you\'d get a few of your guys behind enough smoke screen
that the guy with the painter would call off the hail storm until the smoke
cleared a little...  a restricted killing zone, he\'ll fill with shells just
to break your morale.
        Against conventional arty, you are 100% correct.  Against the FS
Longtom, uh-uh.
        JMHO, YMMV, YAAA, BYE.

Well when she was in the LBNSY(Long Beach Naval Ship Yard), they used 
"plasma arcs\' to cut thru the armor belt, they had no problem putting back 
the armor. Essentially they "cut" out section, then lifted it out, when 
finished inside, put back the section and welded it back.

Part of why the projected costs were high was number of heavily armored 
bulkheads along "Broadway".

As for losing the skills, they just reactivated some "extremely" old 
retired sailors and a few yard workers of even older retirement status.<G> 
Talk about some surprised and pissed off individuals.

At that time I was serving on a US ship in the "yards" and employed by the 
shipyard to work on the New Jersey.

For changing out the ammo handling for the main guns, none was needed. 
Using "properly" trained, and supervised sailors, using the properly stored 
and handled powder. The reason for the turret incident was twofold some of 
the powder was improperly stored on shore, ie not temperature controlled 
becoming less stable than it should have been, and a "senior" handling 
person was experimenting using nonstandard loading procedures.

As for going to binary plastic explosives for propellant, I would have 
liked to have seen the method/plans for the that. The breach was/is big 
enough for me to lay down in, I did just that too. Talk about drilling 
holes in some tough metal, and the pressures that the "plumbing" fixtures 
would have to withstand.

If you get chance go on a tour, do it, "impressive" is an understatement.

        My CP2020 players tried that.  All that happened is that the head
hitman for the Bad Guys walked in, sat down with them, and explained to them
that if they didn\'t come quietly, his 30-man Ops team out side in three vans
was going kill every last innocent civvie in the place in a hail of bullets
and RPG-A fire that would make the screamsheets for months.
        The team went quietly.

Dom,

Dealing the pieces that the 16 in would make of the bridge would be minor 
problem, just don\'t miss by too much.<G> But I know some of the Cajun river 
fishermen would not mind a few misses to increase their "catch of the day".

Hmm how many catfish will a 2000 pound high explosive round stun/kill and

They are if rumors abound that the ammo won\'t make it in the field.  Also,
the rounds have no brass to protect their propellant, so this SOLID
PROPELLANT is what can survive the shock.  Ever played with Model Rockets?
Try dropping a D-size engine (with a cardboard somewhat protective tubing)
from an aircraft and see how the solid propellant IN it fares!

Supplement 5: Lightning Class Cruisers, pp. 42-43, says that (for an AHL\'s
400-dton fuel shuttles) one pass through a gas giant takes 3 hours per
load, refueling in an ocean 6 hours per load, and refueling from an ice cap
9-10 hours per load. Times are for complete round trips, including
transfer. It\'s not clear from context whether these are absolute or related
to the size of the tanks (350 dtons each); however, see below.

Adventure 5: Trillion Credit Squadron, p. 39, says:

"One pass through the gas giant\'s atmosphere is sufficient to fill all
tanks and takes 7 turns [2 hours 20 minutes]. Fuel may be transferred
between ships in two turns [40 minutes]."

This suggests that the times in AHL are meant to be absolute: 2:20 + 0:40 =
3:00 for one complete load.

I\'d imagine the 40 minutes to transfer fuel applies betweens ports and
ships as well.

I was in Norfolk when the IOWA came in, and in Louisville going through
their Phalanx Block 1 upgrade school when the restored turret equipment was
shipped out.  Skill loss was a big topic of conversation at the time- and
one of the reasons that the turret almost didn\'t get repaired.  There was a
lot of discussion about refitting a missile launcher in place of the
turret - but the cranes needed to pull the turrets out of the BBs no longer
existed, and there was some interesting discussions about what exactly
removing one of the turrets would do to the stability of the ship.  They
ended up rebuilding the turret using the parts in place, and parts that had
been in \'storage\' at the Ordinance Center in Louisville.

As I recall, the article was in the \'Surface Warfare\' magazine - had to have
been around \'88 or \'89 because I was still stationed on the East Coast.  The
method was to insert the projectile, then close, but not seal the breech.
At this point, the injection harware would still have access to the ingition
chamber and they would pump in the plastique.  Once the desired amount was
injected, the breach would close the rest of  the way, locking the gun and
also isolating the injection hardware from the ignition chamber.

Applying the Burrito Principle (80% of the meat is in 20% of the burrito),
I then deduce that picking the most commonly encountered people,

Traveller Burrito File is created.

Phase II (the harder phase): build up the Burrito File with a plethora
of each item in each list.

The Most Commonly Encountered NPCs
* bartenders
* business/corporate factors

Note that the cable is only moving at orbital velocity at the normal 
geosynch orbit.  Below that point, the cable is moving below orbital 
velocity.

The beanstalk is usually tethered to a small planetoid above the 
geosynch orbit.  The planetoid is moving faster than orbital velocity 
at it\'s altitude, so holds the beanstalk taut.  Also, anything 
released from the beanstalk above geosynch gets a "free" energy boost 
for getting out of the planet\'s gravity well.  The cable would be 
pulled away if broken at the base.  The total length depends on how 
much the planetoid masses vs the cable\'s mass (below geosynch) vs 
required tension, but it must be taller than geosynch.

Note that the cable is only moving at orbital velocity at the normal

Below orbital velocity, that\'s why it\'s falling - but recall that the orbital
radius drops as you get closer to the surface. The cable is moving
slower as you get closer to the planet, but should still be keeping up
with the planet\'s rotation. Thus the cable should impact close to the

away "close" would be.

Hmm... reminds me of the time the players went up against a Virus infected
Hiver Bruiser.  Wasn\'t pretty at all (thing blew up their APC and gunned down
more than a couple characters) before they had the Victrix ship strafe the
thing w/ its 76-Mj plasma guns.

Small fries.  :-P   When doing Hiver capital ships (39k dt) J4 G5, I ran out
of surface area quite quickly.  CG, Manuever drive and J-drive gobbled it all
up. I couldn\'t get in 7 or 8 hex PEMS.  Had to stick w/ 6.  Given the missions
of the ships (a carrier and light cruiser), and the complement of escorts and
other sensors capabilities (Numerous 16hex AEMS, 6 hex PEMS and 8hex LADARs),
it was enough to swallow.

It\'s proving VERY difficult for a 90k dt ship of similar specs.  It gets alot
worse in FFS2 because of their radiators (but we won\'t even go there!).  LOL.

Unfortunately, it does appear to.  FF&S (and FFS2 IIRC) allow u to put the
percentage of the hull as fuel scoops.  Based on hull size, percentage of
surface area that\'s fuel scoops, and a simple calculation you figure out how
quickly it can take to fill the tanks.  10% is around average, though I\'ve
gone up to 15% to get it as low as possible, to minimize the time one needs to
refuel. 

MT is 1 hour to skim a gas giant.  30 min for a Ocean refueling.  Supp 5:
Lightning Class Cruisers has the fuel shuttles able to skim 350 tons in 3
hours.  Twice as long for ocean.  9-10 hours for ice cap.

Maybe a little.  Still seems more than a little different from something that

Thats starting to sound more like tac missiles than arty, but ok. :-)  Grav
vehicles are of such speed and maneuverability (comparably to ground tanks,
even at the lower tech levels) that you\'re going to need to add a much better
guidance system for it be effective.  Doesn\'t sound much like indirect fire
anymore...

Nearly every grav tank would already have pd capability, even if just from an
advanced fire control and stabalization system, though they wouldn\'t be
capable of area effect due to the main weaponry that\'s common.  I doubt this
would be a dedicated weapon, though.  It starts to muddle the actual identity
of what the grav tank actually is.  A grav tank w/ a dedicated pd weapon has
that much less space to be useful against a grav tank w/ that space dedicated
to killing another grav tank, be that ammunition, fuel or a slightly larger
main weapon or armor.  The complement of decoys, etc should work just as well
in here, as well.  And teh platform that launches these probably hideously
expensive (at least on a per capita basis) weapons is going to have a big
bullseye on it, should it be found.

There would be pd vehicles in teh support role to take care of special smart
weapons like that, whose cost might well prove prohibitive in comparison to
the relative effect against countermeasures.  RCVG has a TL15 Imperial Point
Defense APC w/ a 18.5-Mj rapid pulse fusion gun.  It\'s stated to have
antiaircraft, antimissile, antiartillery roles in a single platform.  They\'re
only deployed to guard high value batallion and regimental headquarters,
though, as most all of the vehicles in that book are capable of self defense
pd.

Yeah.  Remember that ship-to-ship missiles tend to need to be specialized (det
lasers or big monstrosities like "Bubba" or whatever it was called).  \'Simple\'
KKMs have a hard time cutting the mustard.  You\'re also gonna need to the
delivery platform for these shells.  Given the speed, manueverability,
firepower, and armor of grav tanks, arty is going to have to be more than arty
is today.

Once you have shells w/ internal guidance, you\'re not talking bout artillery
anymore, but effectively have the makings of tac missiles, which are
counterable by the main fire control (and thus weapons) systems of anything
worthy of the title "grav tank."

This is where the appropriate countermeasures devices (MCD,etc) take their
role.  Also, detection systems to detect these at range become more
commonplace.  Radar/EMS envelope around the unit, possibly by dedicated EW
platform, possibly put into each MBT to find these and where they came from
(best situation probably a combination).  Plus, there\'s always orbital
surveillance and ortillery to deal with.  Arty probably goes the way of the
dodo, to have it\'s role replaced by ortillery w/ laser weapons.  Harder to
counter (need PDMs, deepsites, or the ability to dispute space control) &
practically instant effect.

Very nice work, as usual, Jesse.

I guess you\'re among those who see Ditzie as a teenager. I think this is
missing the gag, though; as Ditzie\'s inability to pwonounce her R\'s
indicates that she\'s barely of grade school age.

But I suppose you weren\'t on the list when the topic of the infamous
Famille Spofulam creche first surfaced. Roderick Darroch Elliot and Ian
Whitchurch were bouncing memos back and forth which made reference to the
various psychochemicals made available to the little kids in the family
creche, which also happens to be the design department of the FS High
Energy Solutions Division...

I wasn\'t saying it would be pretty to sit behind that HEPLaR ignition chamber
when it\'s active.  :-)  Or even for the vegetation nearby.  My point was that
it doesn\'t have to have any adverse effects *when compared to T-plates.*  eg
blasting off from a starport, the actual conduct of any adventure, etc.  

As far as the lightspeed exhaust, I\'ve seen handwaves as good as anything for
T-plates (actually better, but i\'m biased).  ;-)  Blacklight Zero-Point-Energy
or something like that.  Jon Goff brought it up on the TNE list. This is out
of my element, though.  I\'m not a physics major, and I don\'t even play one on
tv.  :-)

There just isn\'t any reason that T-plates should be good on the environment
when HEPLaR is bad and vice versa.  Or in other words, the handwave of my
choice is as good as anyones.  lol.

I looked over SJG\'s latest reprint of their Cardboard Heroes just last
week. They are on good quality card stock and, while a little cartoonish
(what else would you expect?) they would be useful. These are reprints
however, and since SJG has already printed one set of Traveller C.H.\'s
back in the late \'70\'s early \'80\'s I\'d expect to see them if the sales
warrent.

In the meantime, I have a couple of .pdf files up on my site
(mercenaries and combat armor) at 

http://members.home.net/travelleri/index

Look under Paper Armies.

I\'ve about finished another page of adventurers that I need to post
soon.

If you print them out on index paper stock and use a washer or a penny,
etc. as a base weight they work for those times when you need a quick
set of fills for NPCs to throw against your players.

Since the original Traveller miniatures, like the ones from Martian

Damn that means that "Herman The German" the LBNSY floating crane(a 
captured WWII German Made Piece Crane Ware)is no more;-(. That is what 
LBNSY used to remove the 5" dual mounts for its refit. I still remember the 
"Herman" lifting out a 5" dual turret and then cruising across the harbor 
to put on the shore. It could also do all of the main turret barrel 
replacements.

"Herman" had IIRC four 750 hp diesel power plants just for the four 
maneuvering thrusters ie one diesel for each thruster. The thrusters were 
it\'s main water propulsion. It\'s main lifting point had cables that were 
greater than 12 inches in diameter and in block and pulley of 12 loops. It 
did no use the main lifting point to remove the 5" dual turrets. It quite 
literally could have removed any one of the main turrets of the NJ class 
sans barrels with out any assistance from other cranes.

The crane operator had to be certified heavy lift crane and harbor 
certified boat operator.

Was that the Iowa 16" turret that took the hit during the Korean War, I 
believe it was a 8-10" shell that hit it.

The "Mighty Mo" had "rippled" bottom from running aground at too high a 
speed. Rather than fix her they decommissioned her.

Ok that sounds better than I was imagining it being done. So then they were

And thus, a Traveller legend was born...

How about Ditzie for Empress?  She must have quite a cult following amongst
the Merc community.  Surely it couldn\'t be too difficult, with a combined
effort to put her on the throne.  That would make for a great campaign
poster...  The slogan could read, "A Gauss Rifle cradled in every bosom."

Bartenders

Osric Farland, age 47
Though average height, his blonde-white hair singles him out in a crowd.
Osric has been in the Marines.  He\'s also been a criminal.  He still has
contacts from both careers, but uses them sparingly.  He often gives out
drinks to Marine veterans with stories to trade.  It\'s also whispered
that he\'s been the middleman in an interstellar smuggling ring, but of
course that\'s all nonsense.

Polos Kallisto, age 35
Polos\' fair skin still has remnants of a hard solar tan.  He looks more like
a librarian than a bartender, but he is obviosuly not a wimp.
Polos retired from freelance freight running when his father passed away.
From the moment Polos returned to his homeworld he knew he was
there to stay.  He found running a bar much easier than plying the lanes
between neglected and dangerous systems.  He\'s still part owner/investor
in his Free Trader, the _Lady of the Rift_, which he sold to his pilot.
Polos named his trader after a legendary lady who locals claim to have
visions of from time to time.

Johan Tanner, age 63
This man is a bit shorter than most, is well-muscled, and sports an
eye patch.  Johan eschews technology as it affects the body; the
Imperial cyborg rules has him worried about physical tampering,
to the point that he is somewhat bigoted against augmentation,
transplantation, and prosthetics.
A retired engineer, Johan worked for Arkesh Spacers, a rather
predatory company.  He did some choice sabotage for Arkesh,
and made a bundle.  The bar is his hobby; he doesn\'t have to
worry about retirement income.

Jakob Giness, age 42
The first thing you notice when you enter the Orion bar and grill is
Jakob\'s voice.  His loud baritone carries over the most noisy conditions
- -- perfect for his tavern.  The bar is a large affair, with very good
acoustic qualities.  In fact, in some places one can hear a conversation
clear on the other side of the room.  But usually all one hears is
a rowdy cacophany from all points of the building.
Jakob himself is a very ordinary man.  He is left-handed, but beyond
that his brown hair, brown eyes, and plain face makes him forgettable;
at least until you hear his voice.  He used to be a political science
lecturer, and flew from one major star system to another to give
speeches for universities, clubs, political rallies, what-have-you.
After making one too many enemies, he called it quits and took out
a loan on the bar.

\'Benji\' Saligbotha, age 60
A sharp-featured man with a scar on his cheek, Benji has never told
anyone his real first name.  He is happy with paying customers but
never volunteers information.  His friends are few and close-knit;
most people he knows are merely acquaintences.  Benji is an avid
secret supporter of a well-known people\'s army of freedom
fighters, which is labelled by the Imperium as a subversive terrorist
group (due to its economic disruption).

NO!  BAD idea!  We _need_ that bridge!  The Interstate-10 bridge in
south-central Baton Rouge is too prone to traffic jams as it is; imagine
losing the only alternate route over the Mississippi for quite a few
miles....

ObTrav:  What could a subsector government do to prevent worlds in a
neighboring subsector from competing on an equal footing with the first
subsector\'s trade routes?  More importantly, what would the Imperial
government _permit_ the first subsector to do to achieve the goal
mentioned above?

TL-C ETC Machine Gun  (FF&S1)

Ammo:  7x30mm necked ETC   
       Mass 6.16g, Cr0.12 ea.  
       Avg Energy 2561.5 joules   
       Required Input Energy 153.7 joules (from CPR gun design sequence).
Cassette:  8000 rounds (66.6 minutes firing)
       Mass 2kg empty, 51.3kg loaded
       Cost Cr514 empty, Cr1498 loaded.

Barrel:   Heavy rifled ETC, 50cm long, 1.5kg, actual muzzle energy 3730.8
joules.
Receiver: Heavy, 20.2cm long, 2.86kg
Options:  Shock absorbing rifle stock, gyrocompensator, bipod, optical
sight, laser sight

ROF:          10   Required power: 307.4 watts
Damage:       4                          (HE/HEAP damage: 5)
Short Range:  200 meters (using bipod)   (HE/HEAP short range: 150 meters)
Recoil:       3.72
Weight:       8.03 / 10.03 / 59.29 kg (stripped / empty cassette / full
cassette)
Length:       95cm    
Cost:         Cr2,239   

Power Source:  Blond(e)s-and-a-Trampoline plant, basic model (2 75kg units
exercising at net 4x base energy rate), yielding 300 watts.  (Please note
that more than simply muscular and cardiovascular stamina is necessary to
empty a magazine.)  20kg, 1m3 (disassembled), 14m3 (assembled and
functioning), Cr500.  Complimentary 10 meter power cable included.  
Blond(e)s _not_ included.

We at SayBOOM observe that, given sexual dimorphism in mutant hominid
species, two blonds will (statistically) provide more energy than two
blondes, though marketing surveys suggest the latter will appeal more to
the present customer base.  Power figures given above are averages.  For
more robust needs, we have a four-blond multiple-barrel rotary tool
version, available upon request.

"Joe Genero" is a reference to (IIRC) SHADIS magazine.  The premise of
the series of cartoon-articles was that, given an absolutely average
character in a game system, how would that character interact with the
game setting, within the game rules.  For instance, just how many times
would one have to shoot Joe Genero with [fill-in-the-blank weapon] to
incapacitate/kill him?  Or, how difficult is it in a given rules set for
Joe Genero to drive from his house to the supermarket five kilometers
away, without having a serious accident?

    'body' => 'The Burrito File
Business/Corporate Factors

Andrei Contescu, age 70
A tall, lean man, Andrei has that \'stretched\' look that shows he has
been taking anagathics for some time.  A deliberate man, Andrei
speaks clearly and precisely, without using a "noble" accent.  He
seems down-to-earth in his manners, though he seems a bit too
polished to be totally sincere.  He is also very careful who he talks
with, and will quickly zero in on a leader when interacting with a
group.

Eneri Khaashir, age 55
This man has no fashion sense.  He wears outfits cobbled together
from a mix of eras, from the 1060\'s to the 1100\'s.  The fact is
made worse when one realizes that his suits are his best attempts
at textile coordination.
Eneri is a low-rank worker, and as such seldom realizes the inner
workings of his company.  He merely goes about his job --
regardless of whatever suspicions he might harbor -- and manages
his assignments as well as he can.

Liisha Kinushid, age 35
Liisha has long, brown hair and piercing eyes.  At times she wears
glasses -- for effect only.
She is a young, upwardly mobile female in a man-centered company
in a man-centered galaxy.  She is bold, confident, and very competent.
She can bargain with the best of them, and can drink people twice
her weight under the table.  She knows things about the company
that some chief administrators don\'t know.

Dalia Solado, age 48
Dalia is a tall woman, with yellow hair that has one lock of red-brown
twisting through it.  She is a calm, efficient woman who is currently
double-crossing her company by feeding information to a direct
rival (for cash, of course).  Any assignments she gives out are
almost immediately reported to the rival company -- especially if
the assignment is important to her company.

Arden Backus, age 52
Arden has jet-black hair and olive-toned skin.  He\'s given a lot of
latitude with his choices of assignments and people to do them:
in the past he has gotten excellent results by his methods.  In
exchange for such a wide latitude, his company does everything
it can to divorce itself from any involvement with his \'assignments\'.
As a result, Arden looks more like a freelancer than a factor; in
reality, all his creditors can be traced back to one company only:
in effect, his employer.

Or we could start lobbying Jesse? :-)

Actually, I think this could be a serious suggestion. 

Jesse, what about doing a line of Cardboard Starships?  How hard would it
be to create (a) top-down views for counters (usable with, say, Full
Thrust), or (b) double-sided cardboard models (like those old \'slide
fuselage over wings\' airplanes)?

I know you\'ve got the models already created. Would this be a lot of extra
work?

I\'d missed her being _that_ young, but I can see it. Even easier to

 Well, maybe. Remember Tarantino\'s First Rule, however:

 "Never make a trip to the restroom while on-camera. The karmic punishment
for doing so far outweigh the benefits of an empty bladder."

 Anyone who doubts need only watch a few of his movies and keep count...

ZPE and blacklight are different things.

Personally, I thought the Plasma Focus drive was a much better Heplar explanation than the ZPE or Blacklight stuff. Something about plasma arcs between two tubes collapsing in to from a high energy pressure point causing a fusion ignition..or something, I\'m not a physics major either so I\'ll let someone else explain how it all works.

  I may have missed something in Ditzie\'s original specs (and just why is

Patton was one of those few American commanders in the 2nd WW that
had a clear grasp of the weaknesses (and strengths) the American military
machine. Patton realised that his troops had to advance (their morale would
have collapsed in relatively short order if they did not).

Montgomery  is one of the most maligned commanders of the 2nd WW
(especially by American commentators). Montgomery was a master of the
set piece battle (thats why Eisenhower put him in overall command of the
Normandy battles). Montgomery had a particular eye for minute detail and
was a brillant planner. Montgomery won by ensuring that he had sufficent
superiority to avoid defeat.

Renegade Legion just shows that grav tanks are huge targets when flying,
They\'re only useful when
dug in and their enemy doesn\'t have Interceptors or a Thor satellite.

The point is that armour never quite matches the penetrating power of the
weaponry, if this is violated, the Renegade Legion lessons don\'t apply.

Even if your armour can withstand a Thor\'s shot, the impact is going to ground
your tank deep into the earth and probably overload or destroy whatever
generates your lift.

When facing other armour alone, the tanks that are hull down and hidden are
the ones that will survive, flying in to a combat zone gets you dead real
quick.

The attack helicopter example is accurate, but unlike the turkey-shoot in
Iraq, in grav-tank on grav-tank combat _both_ sides are the attack
helicopters, and both sides are eqully vulnerable (asssuming main battle tanks
on each side).

And the reason Monty didn\'t like Patton is because he was a cowboy bigot who
didn\'t follow orders, who was more interested in grand-standing and making
himself look good than actually winning the war

I\'m surprised even Americans consider Patton any good at warfare.

Though he _was_ great at public relations, it wasn\'t until many years later
that his nasty habits and cruel treatment of his own troops was effectively
publicized.

Yes, it\'s being made down here in New Zealand by Peter Jackson. ( Heavenly
Creatures, Bad Taste, The Frighteners, etc )

 My brother-in-law\'s doing the sound, a guy up the road is training the
ravens, and my son\'s piano teacher\'s son is doing CG work for it. Shows how
big New Zealand is, huh ?
<grin>

There\'s been regular stuff in our media about it, from our large female
prime-minister visiting Jackson\'s soundstage and being presented wuith a
preproduction sketch, to the announcement that Orodruin would be White Island,
to that he was using full size actors to play hobbits, and electronically
shrinking  them.

I\'ve been told several ads for extras have appeared at odd times in local

Jesse, the picture is wonderful. She\'s a bit older than I usually imagine

a 7 year old doing as a weapons designer and PR flack ? Working for Famile
Spofulam, of course.

Jason, thats pretty close, except I imagine her a bit younger.

Kenji, wrong gender, and much younger. You\'re right about the pupils though.

Glen, yeah.

Clif, she\'s 7 years old. Although given the relationship between FS and
Mothers Against Grav Bike Carnage, I doubt you would have many problems
with the Imperial moralists if you did get her to pose on a FS CPR gun.

Dave, well, Ditzie has never been heavily into ideology. I\'d advise telling
her you hate Leeeegals and leave it at that.

OK. Now the important bit.

The gun.

Clearly, it\'s about 1.6 meters by about 0.3 meters, and it doesnt seem to
have any recoil dampening, so it obviously (cues drum roll from FS Gauss
Gun) ... the Famile Spofulam Squad Support Laser. It\'s got fumes coming out
of it, so I think it\'s a chemical laser.

On the other hand, it may also be a Circular PAW, and I am not ready (at
this point in time) to deny rumours that it is in fact a Fusion Gun of some
sort.

I\'ll work up some designs and get back to you all.

Huh?  You are talking about the guy who turned Third Army around, and
marched on Bastonge in a blizzard to relieve the 101st.  Patton was a
genius at Armored Warfare.  He was also nuts, which got him in constant
trouble.

>I\'m surprised even Americans consider Patton any good at warfare.

Something about him winning every battle he ever fought.

He was almost relieved for slapping a soldier suffering from battle
fatigue.  The story was covered extensively at the time, and Patton
received hundreds of letters telling him he had done the right thing.
Patton was an idiot at public relations.  So much so that Eisenhower
threatened to relive him if he so much as spoke to a reporter without a
script approved by SHAEF.

I\'d love to here in private email how you arrived at these conclusions.

I trust you have socked away two complete sets of traveller books (all
versions) for your two future gamers...

One bit of advice, don\'t let them play with that Ditzy girl with the speach

Yes, self steering smart shells with armor seeking heads.  These already
exist as specialised rounds for mortors.  It\'s only a matter of time before
the long toms get something similar.  A plunging 105 shell does not make a
good target and it is bid enough to be hard to kill.  It\'s mass/energy alone
would kill most MBTs.

As for renagade legion, don\'t forget the THOR systems.

Try having a bad guy or group of bad guys attack the PCs in a crowded
bar/club with no regard to bystanders.  It will curtainly wake up the PCs as
the partiers panic and stanpeed or die in droves.  Like the bar scene from
the Terminater.  She though she would be safe in such a public place.  Prove
them wrong and scare them shitless.  Killer robots that become confused and
shoot at everyone believing them to be theats would be a cute trick too.
The robot were originally designed for perimeter patrol and were badly
reprogramed when they were sent after the PCs.

    It was probably because Patton was better at winning battles with less 
material than Monty was.  While Patton certainly was flamboyant, at least
he knew it.  Monty strutted about and then tried to assume modesty.

The Steve Jackson Games web site www.sjgames.com has some
Ogre/GEV fiction on it. One story is of the closing days of the war,
when the Ogre revolt occurred.

Ogres forcing humans into fatally radioactive areas to salvage spare parts
was a scene the heroes were witness to, for example.

By the way, GEV is an acronym (Ground Effect Vehicle), it ought to be
all caps. "Ogre" is a nickname. Not that I\'d argue the point with an Ogre...

IIRC, one of the rule books noted that humans serving with the cybertanks
were always a bit scared of them. They never called them She or He...
cybertanks were called It.

Commander X?

Since the commander is my creation, I can help on that end.  I always
pictured him as a tall barrel chested middle aged man.  With greying hair
and Salt-n-Peper breard.  His usual attire is a custom made black dress
tunic made in Imperial Navy style, with a gold "X" crisscrossing it.
Pants are Imperial Navy standard and dark black boots.  An impressive
figure if you ever met him for the first time.

as far as I remember (and I haven\'t lived in the NY metro area since \'93)
some of the aircraft were still owned by the original users and merely on
load to Intrepid. These had been removed and most, I believe, were then lent
to other museums.  Other aircreaft were sold or donated.  I don\'t remember
the exact numbers, but I seem to recall that Intrepid went from a collection
of about 30 aircraft to something under a dozen.  Keep in mind that all of
this is based on memories that are several years old.  I would be very
pleased to find that the situation there has changed.

Sorry, a couple of nit picky points from an old OGRE hand.  Ogre was the
name of the Mk I cybertank first built by the North American Combine in
2060.  The name stuck with the cybertanks as being rather appropriate.

Enemy OGREs are called It, friendly OGREs are called He (very
respectfully, of course)

How many OGREs does it take to change a light bulb?  Just one, but he
just uses a tac nuke to light up the landscape.

Most common phrase used on first sighting an OGRE?  OH
SHI......BOOOOMMMMMM!!!!!!!

OGRE terms for other units;

friendly OGRE; Bro\'
enemy OGRE; Cuz\' (why?  Cuz I don\'t like you)
standard armor units; LIGHT BULBS!!!!
Infantry;  munchies
Arty; target practice
Militia;  a target rich environment

This was the guy who as a junior officer took on most of the establishment
to get a decent cavalry sword, terrorised Mexican bandits by actually
fighting them, and generally got the job done, to hell with the
consequences. When you\'re that good, I suppose you get arrogant, and results
get you forgiven for being an arrogant sod, or even disobeying orders (Ask
Rommel).

Patton knew how to fight, and he was willing to fight. Friction with others
was a problem, but he knew what he was about. That\'s how he ended up in
charge... you need these men in war.

SPLURRRTT!!

ROFLMAO! Oh m\'gawd, I can see it now!

SWAT Officer: "Sir, here\'s the list of the hostages."

Police Commander: "What the..?!? Oh, those poor, poor bastards."

SWAT Officer: "Sir, we\'ll get the hostages out alive."

Police Commander (looking annoyed): "I\'m not talking about *them*!"


The Baycon adventure would be:

A group of heavily armed, fanatic terrorists have
captured a number of megacorp executives, which
include Ditzie and Cassandra.

The PCs are hired to resolve the situation by a secret
patron; their mission:  save the terrorists!

The current range on the NECAR 4 is 450km, or 280 mile.  That\'s not bad, I\'ve got
about a 50 litre tank, the most gas I\'ve ever put in is 44 litre\'s and I\'m getting
between 450-550 km a tank.  So a hydrogen car getting 450 isn\'t all that bad,
considering the lower boom ratio of H2 to HC.

It\'s odd that whole H2 explosiveness myth, ever since the whole Hindenburg thing
everyone\'s been terrified of Hydrogen, most people don\'t realize, careful marketing
here, that the tank of gas in their car is about 3 times more volitile than a
smiliarly sized tank of Hydrogen.

As for Methanol.  Some of you may remember the 72? 74?  Indy race.  That was
Methanol...

Terminal guidance is almost a certainty, though; TL10+ artillery should
have considerable self-maneuvering capability (possibly tiny grav thrusters).

There were Traveller Cardboard Heroes for Classic in 15mm.  There were
also some generic Sci-Fi ones in 25mm.  Next Week is the GAMA trade show
and SJ is going to be there.  I have gotten my FLGS owner to promise to
bring up the subject with SJ.  I think if we push for them hard enough,
SJG will repring them.

I would suggest:

Battleship - back to the `old\' definition as `a ship capable of standing
in the line of battle\' - in other words, the biggest and fightyest ship
you can build...

Dreadnought - except for this one. Uncompromising on firepower and
armour; expensive as it gets.

Cruiser - A ship capable of independent action. Really, it\'s going to be
the `light\' wing of a battle fleet; with missions including patrol,
recce by force, and fleet scouting. It needs to be the analogue of
German Battlecruisers - able to outfight anything it can\'t outrun; and
outrun anything it can\'t outfight.

Destroyer - Although it goes against cannon, this is probably synonymous
with escort. Not designed for action independent of a fleet, they exist
to screen the heavy ships from other light ships; freeing the heavy
forces to engage and destroy enemy heavy forces.

Frigate - Back to the age of sail here, too - it becomes the smallest
ship capable of independent action. It\'s going to look like a lighter,
cheaper cruiser.

supper Ogres with more brain power that a pack of Pak Protecters.  It\'s a
little frightening when they are armed with \'planetary bombardment units\' as
SECONDARY weapons!  They are tanks the size of the Nimitz.

Great stories though.  Most are about model XX or so units.  Their AI Have
lots of personallity.

One of the defining short stories of the \'Dynachrome Brigade\' was one of the
first, "For the Honor of the Regiment".  It delt with the first fully
sentient Bolo.  Unit DNE or Denny was ordered into it\'s first battle.  His
programers had filled his AI with military history.  In combat he refused to
retreat regardless of the damage he was taking.  Near the \'end\' he charged
out of the nuclear crater he was dug into by enemy fire directly into the
thickess part of the enemies lines.  The enemy broke and ran at the sight of
the \'unstopable\' super tank.  DNE was a total.  When asked by his designer
why did you do something so tactically stupid, unit DNE said simply, \'For
the honor of the regiment.\'

The stories are very well written.

OB traveller:  How would a group of PC deal with an altrusitic and dedicated
to the cause AI?  What type of patron enemy would it make even without a
tank body?  What if a Brusser processor core unit carrried as cargo on the
PC\'s ship were damaged in shipment and came to like as a senteient?  It
would want to keep on existing.  Perhaps it just want to like peacfully but
the athorities do not want it running arround loose and the PCs get roped
into hunting it down.  Your standarn run amock AI story but with the AI as
the hounded good guy.  The Bolo stories meet \'Mean Dog Blues\'?

Interesting.

Bolos are a bit different though.  They like people and conversation.  Only
maned Bolo fought other bolos normally.  Later Bolos were designed to defend
mankind.  Two Bolos fighting would be very odd as they were built and used
by only one \'side\' in the books but the enemy did build similar but
individually inferior unit.  Good old human know-how don\'t\'ch know.

The later Bolos can like people, fall in love, hate, dislike, distrust, ect.
They have a safety curcuit that keeps them under control but in at least one
story a Bolo \'goes rogue\' when it learns that is orders where given by a
traitor.  The safety curcuit launches a self distruct virus that in time
kills the Bolo but the Bolo defenses it\'s mind long enough to \'save the day\'
and avenge the murder of it\'s human commander.

Oops, sorry, unclear...

I was referring to trying to do gas giant skimming with a 280 km range.

I get the idea that a CT Dreadnaught differs from a CT Battleship in
specialization. A Battleship carries the honkingest big spinal mount, 
extensive secondary weapons, and all the armor you can get. A 
Dreadnaught carries all that plus fighter wings, Marine assault brigades (or 
battalions), etc. Makes the Dreadnaughts lots bigger.

Matt again:

Cruiser - A ship capable of independent action. Really, it\'s going to be
the `light\' wing of a battle fleet; with missions including patrol,
recce by force, and fleet scouting. It needs to be the analogue of
German Battlecruisers - able to outfight anything it can\'t outrun; and
outrun anything it can\'t outfight.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Agreed. Myself, I distinguish Battlecruisers from Cruisers by armament - 
the Battlecruiser has the same spinal mount the Battleships use, the
Cruiser has a smaller spinal but more secondary weapons, armor, 
agility, whatever fits in the space not given to the bigger spinal. This
makes the Cruiser more multi-role than the Battlecruiser, but I often
mix the two in independent squadrons - a BC flagship with a couple
of CA/CS wingmen.

I like to make cruisers lighter and faster, and give a small fighter
compliment (like AHL carries) to the longer-ranging types that may have
to pretend to be a fleet all by their lonesome.

Matt again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>
Destroyer - Although it goes against cannon, this is probably synonymous
with escort. Not designed for action independent of a fleet, they exist
to screen the heavy ships from other light ships; freeing the heavy
forces to engage and destroy enemy heavy forces.
>>>>>>>>>>>>
I base my Destroyers on the idea that a TL 6 wet navy Destroyer could,
if lucky, take out a Battleship in one shot. Get in close, open up with
your torpedo tubes and hope you didn\'t get torn to scrap in the process.
Thus my Destroyers are lightly armored, agile ships with the smallest
available spinal mount. Since I like to work at TL12, this is an HG Meson
C spinal. Ton for ton, a pack of these might make short work of an
enemy dreadnaught in a turn or two - which might be their lifespan against
such a foe.

Matt again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Frigate - Back to the age of sail here, too - it becomes the smallest
ship capable of independent action. It\'s going to look like a lighter,
cheaper cruiser.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
My Frigates and Corvettes are light patrol/escort craft. I often make Frigates 
in the 2000-5000 ton range so I can give them a missile bay or two,
Covettes are anything smaller.

I also make Escorts - ships up to Destroyer size, with high agility and
a lot of turret weapon batteries for work against fighters and 1500tn
missile boats.

Oh, yeah, I also make 1500 ton missile boats...<G>

Oh, yes, gotta love those Bolos.  I do.  They are a LOT different from
Ogres.  Don\'t forget the story about the Mk XXXIII that wakes up in an
enemies laboratory, and proceeds to take over, and in the end frees its
comrades and they basically take over the planet.  Then they find that
the war has been over for decades (IIRC), so the lead Bolo relaxes, sets
up a pattern of stellar observations, and puts on his favorite music,
while waiting for the relief column which will take 40+ years to get
there.  The Mk XXXIII is called a planetary siege unit, weighs in at
somewhere over 30,000 tons, and uses CG to land itself on a target world.
 Its weapons are starship class, and is capable of using them to defend
itself as it comes down.  Wicked weapon, gotta love em.

like some input.

First off, let me describe the artwork.  There is a single floating
player in a short-sleeved blue jumpsuit, wearing protective eyeware,
leaping directly towards you, the viewer.  The glowing golden grav-ball
is floating in the foreground (between you and him) just out of his
reach.  This is all surrounded by a white nimbus and is pictured against
the red Imperial Sunburst, which is the standard for the IISS.

I\'ll be posting the artwork on a website by this weekend for everyone
to view and critique.  BTW, I will accept any and all recommendations
for changes, but reserve the right to implement any of them as I see
fit.  However, if anyone else on the list would like to offer alternate
designs to mine, I\'ll be glad to display them on the same website, so
as to give the assembled TML more than one choice.

What I\'m really interested in getting from the list is *TEXT*.  What
should the t-shirt say?  I\'m considering phrases like:

    IISS 114th Exploration Branch
        Efate Grav-Ball Team      (above artwork)

    "Taking ACM to a new level"   (below artwork)

What I want is input from the entire TML.  I\'d like to take a couple
weeks to collect what folks want printed *ABOVE* and *BELOW* the art-
work.  Let\'s set the end of the month as the cutoff date for submissions.
Then, I\'ll put all the entries on the the web-site with the artwork and
we\'ll give everyone a week to vote.  There will be separate votes for
the TEXT ABOVE and the TEXT BELOW.  Majority votes win.  BTW, TML
members can vote multiple times, but only the last vote counts.  (That
way,if you change your mind, you can vote again.)

Hmmm, well you need a vacuum in the chamber anyway where the fusion/plasma
is created.  Once made it can be propelled outwards.  Making a vacuum in
the barrel implies all sorts of other problems; how do you keep the vacuum
under battlefield conditions?  you know that you\'re going to take a hit or
two in the course of things - if the vacuum is lost after a near miss or
two you\'re just riding around inside 100 tons of paperweight.

In addition, the temperatures required to "make" fusion (and plasma, but
not in the barrel) are quite significant, but that can be shielded from the
barrel and the materials that are close can be made now (molybdenum is
typically used in experimental reactors).  This can be further helped by
"temporarily" making a vacuum in the barrel via the use of an initial burst
of energy through the tubeway.  Or perhaps some extreme "barrel evacuator"
at the business end around the opening.

What I\'m actually worried about is the magnetics in the barrel which are
propelling the plasma/fusion and keeping it away from the surface of the
barrel.    This stuff has to be all along the barrel in coils, and at
operating power electromagnets can get very hot.  My only benchmark, the
Experimental Fusion device over my left shoulder, goes through about
$220,000 worth of liquid nitrogen (at $0.23 per 100 cubic feet) for cooling
the reactor vessel a year.  I\'m told that the majority of the heat is from
the magnets, not the reaction itself, which has a molecular density so low
it doesn\'t make much transmitted heat at all.

Those barrels, especially at low tech levels, are going to be massive,
stubby things with lots of projections and such - overengineered to resist
damage and increase tolerances.

Navy Sea Duty At Home

I am speaking today on behalf of those of us who have family members
that think we live a "TOP GUN" existence. You know, those family members

that have watched one too many episodes of JAG, and think that Navy life
is
glamorous.
I have a few suggestions for these people on how they can experience
Navy
life, right in the comfort of their own homes.

1. Buy a dumpster, paint it gray and live in it for 6 months straight.
2. Run all of the piping and wires inside your house on the outside of
the walls.
3. Pump 10 inches of nasty, crappy water into your basement, then pump
    it out, clean up, and paint the basement "deck gray"
4. Every couple of weeks, dress up in your best clothes and go the
scummiest
    part of town, find the most run down, trashy bar you can, pay $10
per beer
    until you\'re hammered, then walk home in the freezing cold.
5. Perform a weekly disassembly and inspection of your lawnmower.
6. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays turn your water temperature up
    to 200 degrees, then on Tuesday and Thursday turn it down to 10
degrees.  On
    Saturdays, and Sundays declare to your entire family that they used
too much
    water during the week, so all showering is secured.
7. Raise your bed to within 6 inches of the ceiling.
8. Have your next door neighbor come over each day at 5am, and blow a
    whistle so loud that Helen Keller could hear it and shout "Reveille,
Reveille,
    all hands heave out and trice up"
9. Have your mother-in-law write down everything she\'s going to do the
    following day, then have her make you stand in the back yard at 6am
and read
    it to you.
10. Eat the raunchiest Mexican food you can find for three days
      straight, then lock the bathroom door for 12 hours, and hang a
sign on it that reads
      "Secured contact OA DIV at ext..-3053"
11. Submit a request form to your father-in-law, asking if it\'s OK for
      you to leave your house before 3pm.
12. Invite 200 of your not-so-closest friends to come over, then board
      up all the windows and doors to your house for 6 months.  After
the 6 months
      is up, take down the boards, and since you\'re on duty, wave at
your friends
      and family through the front window of your home...you can\'t leave
until
      the next day.
13. Shower with above-mentioned friends.
14. Make your family qualify to operate all the appliances in your home
      (i.e.Dishwasher operator, blender technician,etc)
15. Walk around your car for 4 hours checking the tire pressure every
      15 minutes.
16. Sit in your car and let it run for 4 hours before going anywhere.
      This is to ensure your engine is properly "lit off".
17. Empty all the garbage bins in your house, and sweep your driveway 3
      times a day, whether they need it or not.
18. Repaint your entire house once a month.
19. Cook all of your food blindfolded, groping for any spice and
      seasoning you can get your hands on.
20. Have your neighbor collect all your mail for a month, randomly
      losing every 5th item.
21. Spend $20,000 on a satellite system for your TV, but only watch CNN
      and the Weather Channel.
22. Have your 5-year-old cousin give you a haircut with goat shears.
23. Sew back pockets to the front of your pants.
24. Spend 2 weeks in the red-light districts of Europe, and call it
"world travel"
25. Attempt to spend 5 years working at McDonalds, and NOT get promoted.

26. Ensure that any promotions you do get are from stepping on the dead
      bodies of your co-workers.
27. Needle gun the aluminum siding on your house after your neighbors
have gone to bed.
28. When your children have been in bed for 3 hours, run into their room
with a
      megaphone, and shout at the top of your lungs that your home is
under
      attack, and order them to man their battle stations.
29. Post a menu on the refrigerator door informing your family that you
      are having steak for dinner. Then make them wait in line for at
least an
      hour, when they finally get to the kitchen, tell them that you are
out of
      steak, but you have dried ham or hot dogs. Repeat daily until they
don\'t pay
      attention to the menu any more they just ask for hot dogs.
30. In the middle of January, place a podium at the end of your
      driveway. Have you family stand watches at the podium, rotating at
4-hour intervals.
31. Lock yourself and your family in your house for 6 weeks. Then tell
      them that at the end of the 6th week you\'re going to take them to
Disneyland
      for "weekend liberty". When the end of the 6th week rolls around,
inform
      them that Disneyland has been canceled due to the fact that they
need to get
      ready for E-cert, and that it will be another week before they can
leave the
      house.

Put your family through these, and then let them tell you how glamorous
Navy life is.

Now this is a cool idea, especially if you combined it with the TNE handles

If you can, have a play on an Atari Jaguar, with the game \'Hoverstrike\'. It
looks dated now, and isn\'t the best, but gives you an idea of the challenge
of piloting a hovertank. If there are two of you, one can be the gunner,
the other the pilot!

Dear Folks -

>Weighing in at 8 lb 3 oz*

* I forgot to add my comment about using Imperial units in a metric =
country! *Officially*, James is 3740 grams, but NO-ONE uses metric when =
talking baby weights. I guess it\'s a case where the inability to compare =
pre-metric-conversion numbers to post-, combined with inability to =
_visualise_ that many grams, means that the old measurements win out.

ObTrav: Each planet has to use the Imperial Calendar when dealing with =
Imperial business, but each world has its own revolution period ("year") =
around its central star. How often do the lines get blurred when dealing =
with the local and Imperial calendars?

I just skimmed them when they came around the first time.   Was that the one
in "Ditzie speak" or the one after it?  

I remember the one after had a (presumably FFS2) \'pen factor\' (is this the
same as TNE pen value?) that was only 2 hundred something.  That wouldn\'t
penetrate a Trepida.  

As you describe it, it would indeed be a nightmare, but somehow I didn\'t get
that from the Ditzie and FS described weapons...  My only question would be on
the ability to really hide the platform from detection (EMS especially).  If
it\'s mobile, it should be visible.  If it\'s fortified/hidden, if it\'s found,
it\'s dead.  Arty, in today\'s TL-8 world anyways, relies on the ability to
move.  They fire (the whole process from ranging to full barrage) then boogey
out to somewhere else so they don\'t get themselves dead.

I think Supp 9 would bear that out.  My interpretation of the whole thing was
that DNs are BB\'s (look at the ship profiles in Supp 9... all BBs, even the
"dreadnaughts"), though not all BBs are DNs.  That DN was more of a
designation that something was "first line" rather than secondary/colonial. 

Cruisers I\'ve always thought of as BBs w/o the armor or secondary weaponry.
BB style spinal mounts, but less secondary weaponry and armor.  I don\'t think
we have any models of BCs.  I would imagine this would be like a BB, but
lacking the secondary weaponry or armor, but having the other.  So just one up
on a cruiser and one down from a true BB.  YMMV

I don\'t think that goes against canon.  The Midu is supposed to be a fleet
ship.

Don\'t forget the "big" escorts of Rapier/ED-15 fame.  Something intermediate
between cruisers and DDs.

Pretty good, Jesse.  If it wasn\'t for that pocket knife she was
trying to hide, and if I didn\'t know what she did for a living
(and under what conditions), I\'d consider flirting with her.
However, I\'m quite fond of living, thank you.

Naah, Blondes don\'t usually have that sadistic streak that Ditzie
has.  Ditzie is definitely a redhead.  I mean, bright, coppery
RED-head.  Don\'t let her stand in the sun; you\'ll be blinded.

Naah, the psychochemicals have stunted her mental development.
Besides, Barbara Walters can\'t even pronounce her own name, and
she\'s older than Jesse\'s Ditzie.

Of course, you could always change the interpretations - the top
one is what she\'ll look like in 10-15 years (if FS lets her
live); the bottom one is what she looks like now...

Arameth is tall (over 2m) and thin to the point of being skeletal.  He
obviously is the product of a zero-g enviroment, and when forced to exist
in a normal g-field, travels in a grav chair.  He has thin white hair
(sholuder length, bald on top.) His face is best described as severe.

Arameth wears loose fitting ship jumpsuits for the most part.

We must have date very different Blondes then. Mine was

Pelvic Mounted Plasma Pistol...a particularly twisted design that
SAYBOOM introduced just after a TML discussion of From Dusk Till Dawn
movie with Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney. One of the bad guys
wears a pistol that is strapped to his crotch in a pop-up holster. 

(This weapon also makes an brief appearance in Desperado, and is
allegedly one of the scarier things in the guitar case in El Mariachi)

Scary thing is...the PMPP being a plasma weapon, has a recoil like the
kick of a mule.

Its not really fair to compare Montgomery and Patton. Its an apples and
oranges situation. Both were excellant commanders, but they were the
products of totally different systems, using completely dissimilar tools.
Montgomery was a meticulous planner and paid attention to minute
detail. But Montgomery was acutely aware of Britians manpower crisis
(out of a population 1/3rd the size Britian produced an airface and navy
as large as the US and an army half the size). He knew that there was
no manpower pool to replace losses. If Montgomery lost a division it was
not comming back. Montgomery could not afford to lose.

Also Montgomery (like all 2nd WW British commanders) had lived
through the 1st WW and had seen nearly 1,000,000 British dead.
Compare this with the US losses of only 50,000. As a result of this
British commanders were a lot more careful than US commanders.
The British looked for an alternative to the direct assault and were far
more miserly with resources. Plus the British military establishment
was based on an "indirect approach" born of centuries of what was
essentially a naval strategy.

Patton on the other hand was a product of a classical Clauswitzian
establishement. The US military believed in "march to the enemies
main force and defeat them in battle". He was backed by lavish reserves
and knew that if he stuffed up totally, it was not the end, another army
could be built. He was in the position of being able to take risks and
could afford bold strokes that might end in disaster.Patton was also
deeply aware of the fragility of his troops morale. He knew that if his
troops were not going forwards their morale would collapse in short order.
He also knew that his troops were relatively "unsophisticated" and were
not really capable of subtle maneuvers. Therefore he adopted simplistic
plans and ignored such "unneccessaries" as flank guards or latteral
maneuver. Of course this was risky, but he could afford those risks.

Actually if it were not for the fact that they were both arrogent buggers
with ego\'s the size of a small planet; Patton and Montgomery would have
made a good team. Montgomery to break open the line and Patton to
exploit the breakthrough. Of course this was Eisenhower\'s basic plan at
Normandy, however he did not factor their egos into the equation.

ObTrav. Just how would the various strengths and weakness of the "great
powers" in Traveller (the Imperium, the Zhodani, Solomani Confederation,
Aslan etc) be reflected in their military doctrine?

Ok, so be it. Apropos undies are on...

Andrew, much as I love your other traveller work, here, I must
respectfully disagree. On his good days, Montie was a boy screwing
(literally, alas) ass. 

Patton, I will happily agree, was not a whole hell of a lot better by
any description; so?

If I had to argue for the best general of WWII it would come down to
Guderian or Bradley. Either was so much better than their more famous
companions that I don\'t know where to begin. (Yep, I\'ll  also argue that
Ike was the best of _all_ of them. Sure, he had his fallings, but will
you really dare tell me that Noris Aledon wasn\'t as human as you and I?)

You won\'t convince me - I won\'t convince you; shall we drop this bomb
here and now?

No, the Auroras are the one pictured on the front of Brilliant Lances.  They
have modules all along the sides.  Look kinda like the ships in the movie
Starship Troopers.  The one u\'re talking bout is the Coventry (i think) class
ship that was put together by the Covenant of Sufren.

And if the difference is that military grade solid propellants can survive
the shock of a drop from an aircraft while model rocket engine solid
propellants protected by a tube of cardboard CANNOT, then THAT explains why
"insensitive munitions ARE a big deal, especially when people are saying
that Dynamit Nobel\'s ammo won\'t make it in the field.  Follow the thread,

Agreed Patton was not made for peace but only for war, but the military 
needs persons like him even in peace time.

Now for the US Marine members of the list, lets us not forget General 
Patton\'s first cousin, General "Chesty" Puller. Can we have an Urahh for that.

I want something that at least gives the viewer a clue as to what they are
seeing, like this one, above.  Then, with the straightest face I can muster,
I can tell them how the Air Force sends up a big bird to do zero G descents
complete with an indoor Grav-ball court and how I\'m one of the highest-paid
players (In zero G, you don\'t have to be buff.) in the world.  Then I\'ll see
how long I can pull that off.  I\'ll say, you\'ve heard of Generation X games?
This is a Generation Z game (for the axis?).  I\'ll end with, "Look for us at
the next olympics".

The kinds of modifications that I\'m talking about do not require cutting
through the armor belt. Pneumatic boiler control systems are replaced with
computer controls. Manual valve wheels are replaced with motor operated
valve actuators.  Temperature sensor wells are welded into piping. Gauges
are replaced by either Linear Variable Differential Transmitters or
capacitive effect pressure sensors.
At the present time the U.S. Navy has installed a computer monitoring system
called ICAS (I forget what ICAS stands for) on several of it\'s ships.

        IMTU, the UN has opened the stars to individual exploration and
colonization, largely on the concept that greedy private sector is more
efficient than the beuacratized UN Deep Space Rangers (Scouts, MTU).  So,
basically, you build a ship, get a charter and GO!
        So here is my question....  what would the charter *say*?  In my FTF
game, the players are raising enough cash to build an explorer...  they want
to go find some garden world and stake a claim on it.  I am somewhat stumped
as to what rational limits to put on thier activities and rewards there-from.
        I presume that finding a planet isn\'t enough.  Doing a full
geographic analysis is a minimum;  where are the fault lines and "ring of
fire" that we *don\'t* want to build the Colony on.  A resource survey would
probably be required, too.  Maybe even having a Nav becon set up and a bare
piece of bedrock (Class E) to land on.
        So, after the explorers jump through hoops, what\'s the payback?
1/100 of a percent of the GSP (Gross Stellar Product) of the system every
year?  A BCr per fully surveyed world?  A round of applause and the primary
named after them?

        I am looking for suggestions and "how I did it"\'s from YTU....
neither Book 6 or Book 7 have any guidelines at all.

        Thanks in advance!

I don\'t think so -- the Sayat website\'s been down for a while now and it
hasn\'t been a big, bulging, topic on the list really.

Work started on a mockup of a PMPP last summer, but I gave it up -- I just
don\'t have the knack or patience for model-building.  The earlier recoil
testing was as far as I got, which was at least _practical_, damn it.

I don\'t remember that being the inspiration for it, actually, but it\'s all
a blur at this point.  Having made a point of avoiding that movie, I can
lay all blame for my knowledge of it upon the TML with a clear conscience.

I think 6, on the TNE scale.  But as my simulated recoil experiments
demonstrated (duct tape + plexiglass + foam rubber + dildo harness +
boxer), pelvic mounts are much better firing platforms than arm/shoulder
locations.  At least for ~50% of the current human population.

According to T4 central supply catalog, it is a form-fitting flexible armor
that can be worn under formal or light clothing.  It masses 1kg, provides a
flexible armor rating of 3, and imposes a -1 DM on End-based rolls, since
it has no air-circulation and is thus hot and uncomfortable.  It costs 500Cr.

A heavier version is available, which has reflective plates attached. It
gives armor 5 (flexible) vs. most stuff, 8 vs. lasers.  It gives -1 DM to
End- and Dex-based rolls.  It masses 2kg, and costs 1000Cr.

Both versions are TTL-11

I think that the Empress Wave from TNE must be Ditzies attempt to be
Empress.  If you look at the TNE rulebook front cover middle left
illustration you will see the Milieu 1100 Ditzie.  1100 years later &
she only looks 20 or 30 years older.  That is some serious use of
anagathics. [OTOH the Empress Wave is Psionic so perhaps Ditzie learned
Awareness-15 & developed the same immortality power that Grandfather is
descibed as having in Secret of the Ancients.  Somehow I find the idea
of a psionic Ditzie makes me somewhat nervous.]

I think that we have finally discovered the "true" answer to one of
TNE\'s mysteries.

My divorce from my gaming-hating ex was final on Friday, and I am happily

   Both were arrogant, egotisical, brilliant, and extremely charismatic.
Both used these traits to their advantage for the most part...

   Perhaps, but do you care to explain Operation Market Garden?  Many lives
in the British First Airborne Division (among many others) were sacrificed
in a scheme that simply relied too much on timing and luck.  Had it even
succeeded, it would not have been the knockout blow that Monty always
thought it would have been.

   Caution was a British military command trait prior to WW I.  Let the
situation develop in front of you, then picking the precise moment and
place of enemy weakness to strike.

   Montgomery took large amounts of resources to implement Market Garden,
resources that were taken away from Patton and forced him to stop his
offensive operations elsewhere along the front around Nancy.

   Eisenhower spent much of campaign weighing competing demands for
resources from both Patton and Montgomery as each attempted to become the
one to get to Germany first.

   IMHO, Montgomery in summary: a product of British military training, the
hero of El Alamein, a more than competant commander and superior organizer
who earned his field marshal rank but who at times allowed his ego to rule
him too much.

>Patton on the other hand was a product of a classical Clauswitzian
>establishement. The US military believed in "march to the enemies
>main force and defeat them in battle".

   Patton is the product of a military establishment that believed in using
the tactics that work.  While Clausewitz is definately an influence, one
should first look to Sherman and Grant and the American Civil War before
going back to Clausewitz.  Both Sherman and Grant were students of
Clausewitz, but implemented his philosophies in different ways.

   Patton did not waste resources or men.  Indeed, when you compare the
quality of the tanks and equipment the Germans were using in relation to
that being produced for the U.S. Army, he simply had no choice but to order
his men into an extremely aggressive strategy of engaging the enemy
frequently and often, pressing and overwhelming the enemy when necessary.
Men die in such circumstances, but in fewer quantities than if a long
campaign of atrition had been carried out.

   This explains the stand of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne...I could go
on but why...

   A rather simplistic opinion of the Third Army and U.S. Army in general.

>He also knew that his troops were relatively "unsophisticated" and were
>not really capable of subtle maneuvers.

   At the height of the Battle of the Bulge, Patton turned his army north
from their positions in the vicinity of Nancy and thrust into the southern
flank of the German offensive, relieving Bastogne and helping to bring the
situation under control.  It was a manuever with few prescendents in
military history.

   BTW, subtle manuevers in the vicinity of a Pzkw V "Panther" (or worse
yet a Pzkw VIb "King Tiger") while driving a Sherman tank are a sure way to
end up dead...

>Therefore he adopted simplistic plans and ignored such "unneccessaries"

   When you are implementing a tactic of pressing the enemy in the manner
that Patton did, forward thrust prevents the enemy from reorganizing,
resupplying, or having the time to do things like staging flank attacks.
This is one of the reasons that Patton was always railing for more
supplies, particularly gasoline--his tactics required a steady stream of it
in order to work.

   IMHO, Patton in summary: Understood the German Army proably better than
most German generals.  Understood his men and their capabilities better
than anyone but Omar Bradley.  Well thought of, would have been better
thought of were it not for his massive ego and his cannon mouth--then again
he might not have been the general he was without them.

   That Eisenhower was able to utilize both men to their maximum potential
is a tribute to his own leadership capabilties.

   The basic plan at Normandy was to use the threat of Patton performing a
flanking manuever crossing at Calais to keep the Germans from committing
all their reserves to stopping the real invasion.  The Allies went to great
lengths to make it look like Patton has a sizeable force ready to cross at
Calais, when it reality it was nothing more than a bunch of guys with
radios pretending to be an army.  The British under Montgomery held the
eastern flank of the Normandy invasion force, and though they did not
achieve all their objectives, they nevertheless locked up considerable
German forces which allowed the Americans to eventually execute a breakout
that forced the Germans to retreat rapidly eastward.

Here\'s the straight dope:

"The xboat service emblem (above) was taken from a history of Terra by
Professor Dinimbue of the University of Sylea.  The professor found
records of an organization called the Pony Express, but her knowledge of
old anglic was not complete enough to equate the word pony with the
Terran horse.  The professor translated the word as poni, a beast of
burden used on several worlds of the Sylean Federation.  When the xboat
service was organized, the emblem was designed, even though by then the
professor\'s mistake had been discovered."

Montgomery was a very good defensive strategist.  He had a solid
staff and he listened to them.  However, like many defensive
oriented generals he wasn\'t given to bold offensive strokes,
preferring slow methodical advances.  Montgomery gave the
appearance, to most Americans anyway, of being a conceited snob, but
he was undeniably an excellent political general.

Patton was a very good offensive tactician.  He probably understood
the concepts of the armored offensive better than any Allied
general.  However, he wasn\'t patient enough to run defensive actions
and slow methodical actions chaffed him so much he would routinely
blow up, saying and doing half-crazy things.  Patton was an unstable,
unpolitic, loose cannon, and a real SOB...and yes, a conceited
megalomaniac, who would have probably blown his brain\'s out if he
had survived the war and couldn\'t draw the US into another one.

I suspect, Ike putting Montgomery in overall command of the Normandy
offensive was mostly a political move.  Having a "Brit" in the
forefront of the invasion was considered a public relations coup in
the UK, among the non-US allies, and in occupied Europe.  Having a
defensive specialist in charge of securing the expanded beachhead
against the expected German couter-offensive wasn\'t a bad idea.  As
it turned out, I\'m sure there were better choices from a purely
military point of view, but no one knew that before the invasion
began.  I don\'t think George Patton would have been the right choice
either.

You know Santanocheev wasn\'t supposed to be a *bad* Admiral.  He was
just the wrong man at the wrong time fighting the wrong war..

If you mean the government that the shattered remnants of the Regency

Well G: Callahans is OP & the others are up on your site so logically

GURPS Traveller
Random Alcohol Establishment Encounter House Table 

Roll on the Reaction Table (pg 204-5) with the following modifiers:
All normal applicable Social modifiers

1)	Critical Success at a Carousing Roll +4
	Success at a Carousing Roll +2
	Failure at a Carousing Roll -1
	Critical Failure at a Carousing Roll -4 and Roll on the 		Potential
Combat section of the reaction table OR roll on the 	Fright Check Table
using the ammount the roll failed by as a 	modifier OR pull out your old
Travellers Digests & consult the 	Scout Brew Tables

2)	Bar Social Status Modifiers

Apply the average social status of the bars other patrons (including the
other PC\'s if they are more than 1/3 of the people in hte bar) as a
bonus of penalty to the charecters Carousing skill [Example - The Hub
Bar is a lowlife dive that serves to alchoholic street people with an
average socail status of -2, all Reaction rolls in The Hub are at -2,
Darwins Theory is an upscale bar that caters to yuppies & lawyers with
an averge Social status of +1, all reaction Rolls in Darwins Theory are
at +1  Note that some rowdy bars, especially those in startowns should
have other modifiers.  Example - Chilkoot Charlies is a middle class
bar, most of whose patrons are Soc 0 but it is big and loud and rowdy so
all reaction rolls at Koot\'s are subject to a -1penalty]

Apply the difference between the charecters social status and that of
the bars other patrons as a negative modifier to the charecters
Reaction. [Example Baron Trier dehah Tarlineal is Soc 3.  If he enters
the Hub Bar he will have a -5 to his Reaction Roll in addition to the -2
that anyone in the Hub Bar would suffer.  He will still get the +3 from
his social status as a bonus to the roll but will suffer a -5 penalty
because that staus is so different from that of the other patrons]

If charecters are simply trying to have a quiet time all positive
modifiers from Appearance become Negative modifiers as the charecter is
hassled by unwanted pickups.

4)	This Reaction Roll represent the charecters first hour or two 
of Bar Activity, roll again - making sure to apply all applicable 
drunkeness modifiers.

5) 	At the referees discression other skills may be used to modify the
Reaction Roll: Area Knowledge, Bard, Savoir Faire, & Sex Appeal are
often appropriate

For purposes of Reputation Bonus most Bars regular Clientele count as
small groups. [Example at Norms favorite bar "everyone knows his name
and they are always glad he came."  Norm has a +4 Reaction from a small
group of people, which costs (20/3 round down) 6 points

Has a good ear for finding cargo shipments.
Knows how to pilot a ship\'s boat.

Owns _The Shrieking Eel Bar and Grill_, a ramshackle dive on the
outskirts of startown.  He doesn\'t want it anymore because protection
fees are skyrocketing, but he also can\'t dig himself out of debt.  Most
likely he will just disappear on the next ship bound to leave the system.

2. Campaign Blues

Perhaps I\'m overtired today, but tonight\'s meeting was depressing.
I decided we should try GURPS rules, and the night was spent
tinkering with GURPS character generation software.  We created
charactes immensely slowly -- we should have used the templates
in the GURPS Traveller book -- and the whole major point of
generating characters (to conduct interviews, on the assumption that
only half of the interviewees would be hired) we didn\'t have the time
or patience for.  As a result, character development was stunted,
no interviewing took place at all, and half the group was bored at
any one time.

To make matters worse, one of us isn\'t into role-playing at all;
rather, he just wants something to shoot.  He\'s not a munchkin
really; he just doesn\'t care at all for PC personality.  He is a
wet blanket in my opinion.  My campaigns are boring enough
as it is -- whenever I get my nerve up to run some combat I
either plan it badly or else they somehow circumvent it.  I want
to see character development and wheels within wheels.

I guess I\'m just frustrated because I don\'t know how to make this
campaign *work*, no matter how much I do, try, and read.

3. GURPS CharGen

...is not Traveller.  I can\'t say anything bad about it, because I
think it is well thought out and does what it sets out to do.  But
it is not Traveller, and for that reason I don\'t like it.  I suspect
GURPS combat is good -- Dave Smart likes it, so I believe him --
but the characters look yucky; they remind me of D&D, and I
don\'t prefer D&D.  This is my personal preference.  When T5
comes out, I will be there to buy it.

Marc, take as much time as you need, but no longer.

  In a more general sense (i.e., not just WW II in the west) the above is
only true if flank security is available on demand - as late as mid-`44 the
Soviets were discovering that the (rare) effective panzer counter-attack
was a very efficient way for the Germans to neutralize spearhead armour
regiments. The advances in the west would have been much slower if the
defenders ability to resist weren\'t already effectively eliminated. AFAIK
that also applied to Fantasian motor rifles...

The FS Gauss Gun is built to TL 9 specs.

As far as I remember, the Trepida was TL 15.

Also, look at the top armour of the Trepida. I suspect that a hit would do
some harm to it.

Me, I reckon thats pretty good when spotting the opposition six tech levels.

The Gauss Gun was just the weapon system. I would imagine it would be on
some sort of mobile \'grav sled\', plus a point-defense turret.

how would we feel if someone invaded earth? Wouldn\'t we be mad and
scary? BTW, she loves "Mars Attacks", right on her level. She can\'t wait
to be old enough to play in either my Traveller or 2300AD campaigns. She
just adores Kafers. Weird kid!

ObTraveller: Has any one seriously had children npc or characters that
weren\'t brats or Dr. Z super geniouses (shameless BG: 1980  referencee).
Someone like Newt or Anakin so to speak.
Also has anyone had younger players is their campaigns?. When I was in
my twenties playing MT, I had a ten year old player who explained the
starship construction rules to me. And he had never played a roleplaying
game before this! I still have some of his ships somewhere in my stuff.
{He now works for Sierra Online} Sometimes an intellegent (pre-)
teenager has more vigour in roleplaying his character than a soon to be
middle aged adult. Adults seem to morph into GearHeads, History Buff\'s
(What was Cleon III\'s middle name? ), or GameoGraphers (Let\'s see if  I
don\'t sleep before I go to work  I can finish all the subsectors in that
new Rimward Sector {That\'s without convenient softwar}).  At a certain
age or lethargy, you don\'t (your loss) need players, just interested
nostaligists. "Whippersnapper, I was there when the second Library Data
book came out. We waited a long time, too. Yup, thems were th\' days".

Also amusing, when the Army Chief of Staff phone teh Commandant of the Marine
Corps requesting the return of some of the abandoned equipment and vehicles
(of which everything operable was brought out, wounded and dead evacuated, and
tactical integrity maintained by the Marines), which had all been cannibalized
and the hulks put up on gunnery and target ranges, the Commandant replied
"What equipment is that?"

Ob trav.  NPC of the Imperial Marines with a comparable combat record and
noted 
decorations and proven leadership ability.

Touche.  :-)  

I didn\'t say it wasn\'t.  Just FTR, an Oriflamme TL9 grav tank and grav tank
destroyer could both take it and/or come out reasonably well on the frontal
arcs (AV 204 for both).  Side armor is going to be some bad damage and rear
and belly hits is going to be really bad juju.  Maybe I should do a TL9 tank
that would result in response to teh FS design...  ;-)

Plus, Striker II (the source) indicates both have point defense capable Fire
Control (-2 diff mods).

That\'s what i was thinking.  If the grav tanks should find out where this
beasty is, much less ortillery, they\'re going to rush it and see if the grav
sled has armor to withstand grav tank level main weaponry or friendly killer
gauss guns.

Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s a hideously dangerous weapon system...which is what I
expect from FS.  ;-)

Despite the risk of Market Garden, relatively little was risked (basically just
three divisions, only one of which was British and therefore irreplacable). It
was uncharacteristic of Montgomery to take such risks. I guess all generals
can have bad days.

Largely the result of a history of adopting a maritime strategy. It goes with
the British foundness for attacking the perpheries rather than the direct
drive.

US strategy was classic Clausewitz, march into the enemy heartland and
force the mainforce to battle. British strategy owed far more to Mahan,
attack the enemy at the perpheries and weaken them so they can fall to a
well placed offensive.

Most certainly not. However Patton also knew that if total disaster struck
the 3rd Army and every single man was killed or captured, they could be
replaced. Montgomery knew that if the 21st Army Group was lost it could
not be replaced.

The relative strengths of the US and German tanks had little to do with it. 
Armour was the only area of German superiority (albeit a biggie). Most
Allied equipment (artillery, transport, etc) was at least equal and much of
it was superior (the US had the best standard issue side arm) and Allied 
superiority in airpower paralysed the German ability to respond.

The 101st (one of the elite US formations) was invested on the 20th (by a
single division, the 26th Volksgrenadier), the allied counteroffensive began
on the 21st (the garrision could actually hear the artillery), aerial resupply
and extensive airsupport began on the 23rd and the garrison was relieved on
the 26th. Even Singapore took 8 days to fall. And with all that, most writers
comment on the fact that the garrisons morale held. Not to underestimate
the importance or stuborness of the stand of 101st, but just to keep it in
perspective. Yes US units could perform excellantly, but their morale was
still brittle.

>   A rather simplstic opinion of the Third Army and U.S. Army in general.

However an unfortunately accurate one. While the US army in the 2nd WW
was made up of excellent raw material (first class manpower, competant
leadership, lavish supplies, superb equipment etc) and should have
performed accordingly. Yet its overall performance was only adequate. The
problem was mostly with the way the army was managed (especially with
regard to manpower). The individual US soldier was treated as just another
item of materiale. No attempt was made to keep units intact. If a soldier
was wounded, he would be treated (very well) but when he recovered he
would be shipped to a replacement depot and assigned to a new unit as
required. The US high command regarded war as just another management
problem rather than a clash of wills. Consequently US units tended to lack
cohesion and their morale was somewhat brittle.

Subtle maneuvers (or the "ambush and gang-up", a British speciality) were
the only way an M4 could take out a Panther or Tiger :*>. But mostly the
Panthers and Tigers never reached the front. They were blown up by P41s
and Typhoons.

Patton relied on the fact that allied airpower had removed the German\'s
ability to maneuver and would pummel anything that moved.

ObTrav. Just how does the Imperium regard war. Does it follow Clausewitz
and concentrate on the drive on the enemy capital? or does it follow Mahan
and pick away at the edges, slowly weakening their opponent? What about
the Solomani? the Vargr (classic candidates for Mahan IMHO)? the Aslan?
Do any of the great powers have any unique approaches?

If you are using GURPS Traveller, a reasonable facsimile can be found in
GURPS Ultra-Tech 2, pp. 73-74, under "Tailored Flexible Armor". These rules
(too long to reproduce here, unfortunately) allow you to design flexible
armor as clothing, with protection proportional to thickness and stiffness.

Subdued colors ? From Famile Spofulam weapons ? Are you sure ?

Ummm, it hurts more than 204. A lot more. More like damage 300 when firing
KEAP, in fact.

Like I said earlier, I\'d expect most TL9 and up AFVs to have integral point
defense.

The question is is TL9 fire control good enough to stop KEAP projectiles
going at kilometers per second, or is it designed to stop ATGMs going at a
fraction of this ?

The thing that makes it obscenely dangerous, in my view, is the rate of fire.

The original concept was to operate from a hull-down direct fire role,
protected by anti-laser aeosols, and to pour fire into targets of opportunity.

Most hi-tech weapon systems fire at or about a shot every 20 seconds.

The FS gauss gun is designed to put about 16 rounds out in that period.

With a good gunner, it isnt impossible you could tag 3 or 4 enemy tanks in
that period. You could certainly miss on the first shot, and have a second
inbound while the enemy is reacting to it.

After that, things slow down a lot - what makes it so big is the obscene
amount of power it takes to accelerate 30 kilo slugs to that speed.

The same investment in accumulators for a TL10 fusion gun is truly scary to
think about. 

Finally, I think ortillery is over-rated. The atmosphere, cloud cover and
sheer distance will strongly limit the effectivness of orbital fire support
in my opinion.

The other issue that has to be regarded in \'good wars\' is the Imperial
guidelines against making war in space.

That was quick !

>The more feedback I get, the better I can make it! :^)

I actually didn\'t expect that much colour & complexity, I was originally
thinking of something like athelete\'s wear during training & warm-ups, on a
sweat shirt type material with probably a monotone logo and maybe a name or
number, like all those colllege football team sweatshirts.

That one  looks more like the shirt they\'d sell to the crowd at the gate than
one the players would wear !
:-)

It\'s a good design for a publicity shirt,  though as someone else said you
might need to work on the people\'s posture. I\'ll see if I can dig out some old
2000AD\'s, there were some good-looking shots from that sort of angle in the
grav-ball series in there.

What did  you use to make the people ?

Yep, in RL at least, grav-tanks are largely sitting ducks for fighters and
space weaponry.
That is, if you can get Command to release them for ground attack ...

That\'s a litle harsh. There was quite a bit of backstory and at least three

Interceptor is also a cute boardgame.

Yes to Leviatghan, never owned the Battletech stuff though
The _best_ way to do it is to have all four Centurion, Interceptor, Leviathan,

I have also used Centurion for Traveller skirmishes.

Yep, something like that that sounds good., though tying them to just Efate
sounds a little small for the ISS,
you sort of expect them to range woder somehow. And 114th Exp _Branch_ doesn\'t
quite ring true. maybe :

114th Sqdn, Exploration Branch

The weapons (main and secondary) were similar.

In CT, at TL 15, you can expect the battleships to pull 6G whilst
firing all weapons. At lower tech, the trade off between armour

A better comparison would be to have the battleships at J3 or 4 and
the battlecruisers at J5 or 6.

Besides, shouldn\'t all 200kt+ battleships be buffered planetoids
to get that factor 21 armour?

I agree with the idea of dreanoughts being multi-role battleships,
so a dreadnought battlecruiser should be J6, 6G, meson T, lots of
lasers and missiles, fully streamlined, fuel scoops, fighters,
assault battalions, cargo. Oh, and some armour if it fits.

The lead players nose is still straight...he\'s either a rank newbie or has 
had lots of cosmetic surgery. Grav-ball\'s gonna be a contact sport, and if
they\'re not wearinh helmets and masks they\'re gonna look like the average
hockey or rugby player.

There\'s a logo for ya!

SJG\'s online magazine, Pyramid, includes a GT adventure, complete 
with stats on two NPCs, a cold sleep-related disorder Cryogenic 
Narcosis, a cargo-bot, a star system (and all it\'s associated 
planetary bodies) and a minor race.  Although I have some minor 
problems with certain little details, the adventure overall seems 
quite sound, and the level of rules related detail is great.

The name of the adventure is "The Theta-Nine Sleepers", by Rick 
LaRue.

While it may or may not be useful to you, I\'d still recommend looking 
it over and rating it.  That will help support further GT adventures, 
by demonstrating an interest in them.

Thanks for your time.  I now return you to your regularly scheduled

I do see the Imps as having any particular war college.  They seem to rely
on the whim of the admiral at the front.  Each of their "big" wars were
fought differently.  About the only recurring theme is that they do not have
the initiative in any war.  Early losses, slow regrouping, reluctant
reinforcement and reliance on frontier admirals to "solve" the war.  They
seem to take it for granted rather than regard it in one way or another (at
least circa 1110).

Ditzie would probably go in for a guy who\'s 1) a gearhead 2) a crack shot
3) at least a little crazy.  Safe sex, however, takes on a whole new
meaning with Ditzie.  As in, at a minimum, a set of custom cloth,
possibly with headgear, and a first aid kit close by.  Probably the whole
thing would initiate with a discussion of plasma weapon design, followed
by demonstrations of individual prowess with said weapons.  Ditzie would
probably get rather excited by a guy who can really handle weapons well. 
Just dont let her blind side you, you might regret it.

I do have some comments, though:

On Postures, it might look better if the other team are trying to 
dive for the ball, too.  Or at least one of them.  While it looks 
like the main player had bowled the other two over, it doesn\'t carry 
that same zero-g feel to it.

On Taglines, Above, how about:

IISS 114th Explorers
Regina Raiders

...or something similar, based off of a subsector name.  Limiting 
oneself to a single system sounds like it\'s a little league set-up, 
and sectors are too big to sponsor anything more frequently than the 
occasional decade-based Imperial Grav-Ball Tournament.  Or if you\'re 
looking to put the Traveller name on it, try Trin\'s Travellers  :)

On Taglines, Below, how about:

the 1120 Imperial Grav-Ball Open

One last note:  How hard would it be to make one of the players be a

Subject: Grav-Ball T-Shirt Ideas


Great work!  Man, I can\'t wait until they\'re done!

I do have some comments, though:

On Postures, it might look better if the other team are trying to
dive for the ball, too.  Or at least one of them.  While it looks
like the main player had bowled the other two over, it doesn\'t carry
that same zero-g feel to it.

On Taglines, Above, how about:

IISS 114th Explorers
Regina Raiders

...or something similar, based off of a subsector name.  Limiting
oneself to a single system sounds like it\'s a little league set-up,
and sectors are too big to sponsor anything more frequently than the
occasional decade-based Imperial Grav-Ball Tournament.  Or if you\'re
looking to put the Traveller name on it, try Trin\'s Travellers  :)

On Taglines, Below, how about:

First Win!

>From AstroBurgers, a Proud Sponsor of the Spinward Marches team in
the 1120 Imperial Grav-Ball Open

We\'re Not Just First Contact Anymore...

If You Can\'t Take The Heat, Stay Out Of The Corona

The True "First Contact" Sport

Survey This, Buddy!

....

One last note:  How hard would it be to make one of the players be a
Vargr or an Aslan?

Thanks,

I\'d like to see that.  It\'d give me an alternate on which to work.

On, you know.  Amino acids, lightning, the usual stuff. :^)

Seriously, I used an application called Poser 3 by MetaCreations.
It\'s extemely powerful when it come to generating human figures.

Yeah, I agree with all of that, Frank.  It needs a little tweaking.

Now *THAT* is a great idea!  I\'d like to hear more suggestions along
this line.

Yup.  I\'m a firm believer in, "Buy the best; then you can\'t blame
poor results on poor tools."

Michel V. indicated the same thing.  I\'d love some alternate poses
or pose suggestions from any of you.  If you actually could provide
Poser (v2 or v3) files, it\'d be even better!

Oh, that\'s *easy* to fix!  I\'ll just break his nose! :^)

I really can do that.  Additionally, I\'d planned to put headgear
and shades on each player, make them a bit less personable.

Maybe that\'s what should be on the chest of the lead player. :^)

From a naval historian\'s standpoint, that\'s a coke-on-the-keyboard
line. "Oh, and some armour if it fits" is the best summary of the
Fisher school of battlecruiser design I\'ve ever heard...

Later variants that don\'t cap armour and handle it in the weird way HG 
does make a "battlecruiser" concept more viable, since large ships are
often trading armour and speed; I suspect that an evolved FFS1/FFS2 
battleship design would probably be about 4G rather than 6. This does leave
a battlecruiser niche (6G but less armour), but I\'m not sure the IN
would take it.
