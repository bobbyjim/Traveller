Actually, this is entirely untrue in Traveller.  Organ cloning exists and
is TL 13.  If you can grow and eye or a hand at TL 13 I\'d say growing a
generic mass-o-meat is more like TL 11 or 12.  Also, you can grow organ
clones (or any other kinds of clones) faster than normal if adequate
nutrients are provided.  At TL 10 the rate is x10, at TL 12 x50 and at TL
13 x 100.  That means you could grow a 100 kg human in 2 months (18
years/100) at TL 13. 

All this makes Real World sense because we are currently working on the
beginning of organ cloning.  They\'re close to skin and are doing good
initial work on livers.  In several thousand years this will be old and
easy tech and will likely be used in fast food joints the galaxy over. 

All of the above info from MegaTraveller (and I\'m fairly sure all this was
true for TNE as well).  If this is not true in T4, then this is yet
another problem with T4, because this is tech we are likely to have in a
couple of decades (though it will likely be a bit longer before we\'re
growing dinner this way :)

    'body' => '>        Has anyone tried to implement a Horror setting with Traveller?

My version of \'Horror Traveller\' was a kind of Poltergeist scenario. When
my group visited a character (PC who missed the session before) who took a
job as a nanny for a widower and his daughter, they encountered some VERY
strange phenomenons. Those were quite funny, like self-steering toy cars
and card houses being built alone, until one of the characters followed
the girl to the kitchen, where he encountered the complete knife
collection thrown at him - and the others only heard screaming through the
door. This ended with a \'ghost\' appearing on top of some stairs - which
threw the marine of the group down them (I wrote about this before).

I planned this adventure for halloween, but had to play it later - due to
a delay in playing with the group, the adventure still is not
accomplished. Figure out what caused the sightings above.

Another horror-like adventure has been published in the Travellers\'
Digest: \'The Possession Ball\'. The group has to fetch some goodies from an
abandoned and seemingly \'haunted\' house on a cliff, which was formerly a
psionics institute.

There are much other adventure containing horror elements. It depends on
if you want \'gothic horror\' or the splatter type. Creepy animals can be
interesting sometimes while investigating a cave or ancient complex (e.g.
\'Shadows\', \'Annic Nova\', \'Artifacts unearthed\') For an alien-like setting
refer to the Chamax-Plague classic adventure. 

Atmosphere is important. Don\'t let the crew figure out what\'s on too
early, it is best when they know *that* there is something, but they don\'t
know *what* it is or how it looks like.

Hmm, I may be wrong about you.  As parody this is *great* stuff. You truly
frighten me if you actually believe this, but if this is parody of the
ultra-right then I applaud you.  I\'m childless, I hate children and I\'m
*amazed* by these statements.  Someone should employ you to work for some
ultra-right political group. With speeches like this you have them
discredited in a matter of weeks.  If this is your goal, go for it.

Actually, there\'s not much Darwinian here, I see lots of Social Darwinism
(an discredited and fairly primitive late 19th century philosophy with no
scientific basic used by the rich to justify screwing the poor) and a bit
of Sociobiology (a discredited late 20th century philosophy used for the
same purposes).  There is 0 evidence that poverty is genetic and much that
is it not.

Maybe because a government is not a business?  Maybe because it has almost

A quick look through history will show this idea to be entirely false. 
Take a look at the early (mid 19th cen) industrial era in Britain.  All
boats weren\'t lifted there, in fact until reforms of the type which I\'m
sure you would object to were put in place the population was briefly
below replacement levels, especially in cities. 

One of any useful governments purposes (leaving considerations of social
justice aside) is to help a society continue to exist.  Laws like you are
proposing would cause huge numbers of people to flee or die.  Given that
free-market capitalism can only exist where there are notable
discrepancies in wealth (otherwise why would person X work for person Y. 
This problem would continue and eventually that society would no longer
exist.  History has proven this to be true (though in all cases I know of
these laws were changed before the collapse occurred).  All ethics and
moral problems aside,

In a hopeless quest to take this back to Traveller, it would be
interesting to have the PCs land on a world where some crazed regime had
instituted such a system.  A "PC\'s help the local Wooblies" campaign could
be a blast.  For info you could take a look at what happened in Paraguay
in the early-mid 80s.  They tried a system like you are proposing with aid
from academics at the University of Chicago who were effectively using the
nation as a testing ground fro political and economic theories.  There\'s
loads of fascinating Traveller scenarios in that stuff.  Amoral academics
come to experiment on a developing planet...

And always remember: Traveller is based on both Vilani and Solomani
Technology after a long night! The advancements we see now can be
explained away by this fact if they are not available in the Traverse.

Oh, I remember one of my players calling "What? they are using wood?" when
I described the house they were in (at TL 12). But he was quiet then when
he saw the looks of the other players. Another wondered why a newspaper
lied there - he did not realize that I never mentioned the material it
consisted of nor if it was printed by the home\'s network computer.
Everyone has a different view of what future brings.

If we await plastic for the future, how can we be sure not to find wood
again, even if it\'s from genetic grown trees? Looks the same, though ...

I checked the reference in MT. But, as many things in Traveller, they don\'t
explain how organ cloning is done.  Which is to say, the rules don\'t declare
which of us is right.  I personally believe that you clone a whole body, then
focus the growth on the parts you want.  This produces limbs and organs with
vestigial body parts attached.  Definitely not something for the feint of
heart.  I also believe that muscle tissue is an organ and thus your "generic
mass-o-meat" is still TL 13.

"Adequate nutrients".  Remember that this discussion is about long term, "zero"
input food construction.  Human waste products is by no means "adequate
nutrients".  If you need these "adequate nutrients" to grow your steak, you can
just bypass the middle man and take these nutrients directly.

Brian Mays pointed out what I had heard of; Ships can coordinate to arrive
(roughly) together.  The details of this are debatable, for example, a GM
could reasonably rule that any JDrive not in excellent health (past it\'s
annual maintanence deadline perhaps? understaffed for engineers?) will not
match consistently with its escort (or with the ships being escorted).

I hadn\'t thought of that, and I\'d bet the Imperium would frown on a
\'registered escort service\' ignoring the plight of a bystander being
attacked, too.

>Has anyone done an analysis of the logistics of piracy/raiding?

I did not with great intent.  First, the debates here convinced me to some
extent that its probably not possible, except in certain specific
instances, to run a successful piracy business in the Imperium proper.  It
is possible to profit from a tradewar situation where "rules of war" allow
taking prizes legally, or in a "cold" or "hot" war with another
interstellar government (Zhos, Vargr) where privateering is encouraged.
The problem as I see it is not so much the capture of vessels as their
disposal.  Starships are registered, tagged, tracked and inventoried to
within an inch of their lives usually, and only legitimate ownership
(assuming one doesn\'t export it to another realm completely) is useful.

I will point out here that the 100 diameter limit of a system\'s star is
sometimes much farther out than that of the system\'s mainworld.  Also, many
merchants save money by refueling at a gas giant, many hours away from the
mainworld.  The GG itself is probably patrolled, and random patrol boats
may move back and forth, but there is a good opportunity for a raider to
catch ships in transit.

Recently, I read here from Marc\'s hand that when jumping a ship emerges in
a predictable area of space (on a line from the point of jump initiation to
the destination planet) which makes life harder for pirates (since SDBs can
be posted where ships are expected to emerge, approximately).

Altogether, I agree that piracy is quite difficult to pull off.  To make it
a real risk there is usually something \'special\' happening (war, tradewar,
inside intelligence, sabateur/infiltrator/betrayal, etc.) which keeps the
local SDBs from helping and/or the victims from running and, often,
allowing disposal of the real \'booty\' (ships) legally.

I can see a couple of possibilities.

First, lets assume that the person is vacc suited.  I\'ll bet good money
that the "firing chamber" of any spinal mount (PAW, MG, Disintegrator
(TL17)) is held in a vacuum.

As another poster said, the magnetics will be pretty nasty.  This may or
may not have an effect.  I am not familiar with how humans react to
magnetics. Let\'s assume thought that the suit is specifically non-magnetic
for vars. reasons.

Next prefiring step for a PAW is probably to use a radiation source to
release a charged or neutral particle into the chamber and accellerate it
to near-C.  This should release a goodly amount of nasty EM radiation (all
up and down the scale I would guess) which would normally just bounce
around and emit out the barrel.  In this case there is a nice, watery
object there to absorb a significant fraction of the emitted energy; a
human body.

Ever put a frog in the microwave?  I would expect the body to splatter all
over the interior of the tunnel, with bone fragments and pieces of suit
striking out as well.  If you believe the inside of the tunnel is armored,
this is not really a problem (except for the poor engineer who has to clean
up).  If, on the other hand, the inside of your spinal weapon is lined with
delicate electronics, carefully aligned magnetic coils, and specialized
optics, there may be a problem.

The spinal weapon will probably fire once in even the worst case.

But the basic assumption was that the merchants involved believed that the
escort force was big enough to defend 10 ships against the potential
raider. It dosen\'t even matter if they are mistaken or not. That\'s what
they believe. If they don\'t know the extent of the threat, they\'d hire
as much as they could afford and still make a profit, wouldn\'t they?

Ah. That seems to be the sticking point. Why should it be diluted? The
weapon ranges are so large that you can pack your convoy many kilometers
apart and all of them would still be essentially as close to the escort
as any of the others. Why do you think that more ships will mean less
coverage?

I\'m having trouble with this concept because I find it hard enough to
believe in single pirates. Imagining pirate fleets are even harder. But
I\'ll have a try. How do these pirates coordinate their attack? They can\'t
know the size of the next convoy, can they? So if a big fleet capable of
dealing with the escort is assembled anyway, the escort would not be big
enough to protect a 10 ship convoy either, would it?

>Precisely, yet perhaps they are willing to pay more than that figure for
>protection.

Not if they think that the escort is big enough to deal with the potential
threat. You\'re ignoring the original premise. The merchants believe the
escort is big enough to deal with the threat. Why should they pay for more
protection than they need?

>If they can get *better* protection (meaning a higher ratio of escort
>tonnage to merchant tonnage) they will probably buy it (if available).

Only if they think they need it. A force capable of dealing with twice
the number of attackers is not twice as useful unless there twice as
many attackers -- in which case the original escort force wasn\'t good
enough in the first place!

The first half of that argument is well enough, but the second half
dosen\'t hold water. Assuming for purposes of argument that you have
assembled a pirate fleet in the first place, it is literally pissing
money away every day you lie idle. Capturing a couple of merchant
ships will be better than nothing. Plus, merchant ships are worth a
lot of money. Even a single one will give a good return, again
assuming that you can capture it in the first place and sell it in 
the second (which we have to assume in order to have the situation
in the first place (I happen to believe an ordinary, "civilian"
pirate would have a lot of trouble capturing one and even more trouble
selling it, but that\'s by the way)).

But they do have to get from their home port to the "hunting grounds",
which takes several jumps; then they have to hope they don\'t jump into
a system with a naval patrol present. Then they have to find an
unescorted ship in a system with no system defenses of its own.

I forget how much a Corsair costs. Is it about MCr200? If it is, the
raiding force is worth MCr2,000 and will, in order to give the same
rate of return as investing in merchant ships gives, have to earn
MCr125/per year over and about running expenses.

No, you\'re right.  We are in the experimental stage, but we have
successfully cloned organs such as the liver.  As long as it\'s the same
cell(s) over and over, and not a complex organ, it\'s do-able.

This is where the GURPS "meat factory" idea comes in.  You aren\'t cloning
exact cuts of meat, just a mass of muscle cells.  It will not look pretty,
but it\'s meat.

And it is MUCH to early to be discussing this.  I think I need a salad . . .

Don\'t laugh, now, but Biosphere II, while somewhat of a running joke
around here, _is_ still a self-contained, sealed environement that
people lived in for a year. One of the things they discovered was that
new concrete is a hell of a CO2 sink. a lot more than they thought.

They have a bunch of references on line, too.

Quoting from the Players\' Manual, p. 92:

"The number of rounds a weapon uses when fired on full automatic can be estimated from the autofire targets the weapon may hit. If the weapon may hit 2 additional autofire targets, assume the weapon fires four rounds per autofire burst; if 3 additional targets, assume 10 rounds per autofire burst; if 4 additional targets, assume 20 rounds per autofire burst. A weapon may always be fired on a semiautomatic setting, with only one round fired at a time."

I would suspect that a man sized object would result in electrical arcing
in the tunnel, certainly tripping circuit breakers.  I doubt any real

Oh, yes, this had occurred to me <evil grin>.  This is in fact one of
the most interesting features of the move - in year 0 I am assuming that
even Solars are far from universally accepted, even within the Imperium.
PE allows some simplification since RUs are *not* (neccessarily) money,
but even so it makes moving capital around challenging...  I have based
the rules I have on the PE "foreign investment" rule; range limited to
the "offensive range" for the source world TL and 1 RU at the target
world requires (1 + parsecs range/2) RU spent at the source world.  For
those with more time than money I allow a slower transfer at a better
rate - if folk are actually interested I will post what I have typed up
but it ain\'t short...

Hey it was the 1.0 version, what can I say...;-)

In fact, despite the circus-like nature of the \'first mission\', it is a
valuable research tool. They learned a heck of a lot about how little we
know, besides, I don\'t see anyone _else_ doing work with large isolated
environments, something we _have_ to know about, for instance, before we
even think of sustainable lunar bases or a Mars mission.

Now that Columbia University is running it instead of a flamboyant Texas
billionare (Hmmmm....anyone see \'Contact\'? Maybe I\'m dim, but I just
made the connection) it can fufill it\'s promise.

1) The listing says "cloned body part"

2) Using the medical digest in Traveller\'s Digest 12-14 (cloning, limb 
regeneration and prosthetics) ordinary cloning is TL 9 (which makes 
sense given Dolly the sheep).  Organ cloning is *4* TLs higher so I 
would expect it to be just the organ.  We are talking about a TL
which includes x 100 rate limb regeneration (just hop in the regen 
vat for a few weeks) and similar advances.

3) In the article on it in TD 14 there is no mention of medical rolls 
necessary to separate the cloned body part from the vestigial body.
From everything said in that article a "cloned body part" is just that.

4) As I said before, we are getting close to doing this now with a vat
and some tissue cultures, so I see no reason whatsoever to add in the
icky vestigial body. 

5) A mass of muscle is much less complex than an eye or an arm.  If you
can grow a fully functional arm in a vat at TL 13 (they use this example 
in TD 14) then growing a mass of muscle tissue sans nerves, and bones
should at least be one TL lower.  Note that we need not be talking about
an actual muscle which can then be transplanted, but merely a big hunk of
muscle tissue which would be useless for medical purposes.

Quite true.  Using meat cloning technology is a great way to have fresh
food, and gives you *limited* recycling capability, but I entirely agree
that it will not get you anything resembling a closed cycle w/o a *very*
large and extensive system.

Imperial calendar was 365 days as a holdover from the Rule of Man.  It\'s the 
\'standard\' Terran calendar.

According to one literary reviewer,

"One of Dunsany\'s favourite universal themes is that of time, both the
romance of the things from which it separates us and our frailty in the
face of its passing. In Sacnoth, describing the door of the Fortress
Unvanquishable, he compares its vastness to that of "the marble quarry,
Sacremona,
from which of old men cut enormous slabs to build the Abbey of the Holy
Tears." He speaks of Queens with jewels in their hair, "each jewel
having a historian all to itself, who wrote no other chronicles all his
days."

Specifics on the publication, if anyone is interested, are:

Lord Dunsany, "The Fortress Unvanquishable Save for Sacnoth," (London:
George Allen & Sons, 1910), in At the Edge of the World, (New York:

"The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save for Sacnoth" (1908) is one of the
great epic fantasy adventures of all time. In one 20-page short story,
Dunsany launched the "sword and sorcery" genre, sending his hero,
Leothric, on a quest against an evil sorcerer and all his minions: giant
spiders, vampires, succubi, hordes of armed guards, the sword-wielding
sorcerer himself, and not one, not two, but three guardian dragons. 

Best of all, however, is the preliminary adventure young Leothric
undertakes to gain the sword whereby the sorcerer\'s defenses can be
defeated. Unfortunately, the unhappy hero learns that the sword
currently forms the spine of the great dragon-crocodile Tharagaverug,
and that Tharagavergug is invulnerable except for one weakness: the only
way in which he can die is of starvation. Leothric must fight the dragon
for three days and nights until the beast finally starves to death,
keeping out of reach of its great maw the whole time. Once he has the
sword, the rest is easy - merely a matter of resisting temptation and
using his wits - but imagine the average PC\'s reaction at being told he
must fight a near-invulnerable dragon one-on-one until it starves!

That is a positive development of which I was previously unaware.

There\'s a Biomass Production Chamber (BPC) that they\'re testing (or
building).  Anyway, two chambers will support a crew of 4 indefinitely
for 95% of their food.  One chamber holds 90 sq. meters of growing
area.  Which translates to 45 sq. meters per person.  Another BPC that
has 20 sq. meters of growing space takes up 135 kL which used to be a
hypobaric chamber. Scaling that one up to one person\'s needs would put
it at about 300 kL.  Which is about twice my estimate, although my
surface area was much larger. But then again, I assumed one tier every
half meter.   I suppose the real question is surface area for growing
plants, which is 45 sq. meters per person.

Buyer will pay for the shipping of their choice and it will be added to
the sale price.  Payment is by pre-payment.

There are a few rare items in here so, please read it carefully.  The
initial post is going to all outlets, future updates will be at

Actually, I\'m borrowing more from the game than just the races. I am also
borrowing a little of the plot. Basically, my idea was to have a world that
was experimentally colonized by four races (human, veloxi, elowan and
thrynn) before it went into the long night. So, hundreds of years later,
they only have vague legends about being from other worlds. I was curious
if anyone had an idea on character creation rules for the three races. For
those of you who don\'t know Starflight here\'s a summary.

Veloxi - Insectoid race with two arms and four legs. In the game they excel
at engineering and science but are poor in medical and communications. I
plan on giving them a fairly group oriented mentality (in fact, in their
original form the Veloxi have a civil bur/hive government form in some ways
similar to the First Imperium). 

Elowan - A plant based life form with three tentacle like arms. Each
tentacle splits at the end to perform grabbing and manipulation functions.
They excel in communications and medicine. The Elowan are generous in
nature and highly empathic. I was planning on giving them a commune like
philosophy (okay, I\'ll admit it. I stole some ideas for their society from
the Pkunk in Starcontrol II :) ).

Thrynn - A reptillian/saurus race with powerful legs weak arms. Think
sentient raptors and you get the right ideas. They excel in communications,
but for different reasons than the Elowan. Where the Elowan are empathic,
the Thrynn are naturally adept at solving complex logic systems such as
language. Their society tends to be based on technology and strength. The
more tech and science a Thrynn has under their belt, the more highly
regarded they are.

Unfortunatly, SOK is folding and all their properties, including the
Shadowrun, Earthdawn and Traveller mags are in limbo. I know that both the
Shadowrun and ED editors are trying to buy the rights to put out the
magazine itself. I do not know the status of the Traveller Chronicle.

Here is what Harold Hale, editor of the Traveller Chornicle said at the time:


I had anticipated this coming out of the closet, so here is the official
press release.  I would be grateful if someone would also forward it to the
Traveller Mailing List:

April 14, 1998

   After 13 issues and a lot of blood, sweat and tears, Sword of the Knight
Publications has decided to discontinue publication of Traveller Chronicle
and its other RPG magazines.  The decision was based primarily upon Kevin\'s
desire to pursue other interests, not any pending financial disaster.

   Starjoy Publishing, a company new to the field of RPGs, is currently in
negotiations to take over the publication of Traveller Chronicle.  When
these negotiations are completed, publication will resume immediately with
Traveller Chronicle issue #14.  I will be continuing as editor of the
magazine.

   At this time I do not have any details regarding subscriptions, but rest
assured if you are still owned issues on a subscription, you will be
compensated in some fashion (either monetarily or through having your
subscription continued under the new publisher).

   I look forward to the new relationship with Starjoy, and hope you like
the changes it has in store for the magazine over the next year.  One thing
will not change however, and that is TTC\'s commitment to supporting
Traveller in all its forms.

   More news as the situation warrants.

Regards,

Harold D. Hale
Editor-in-Chief
Traveller Chronicle

So should I go on to explain how lifting arbitrary laws against adult
child sex would ensure that children had another source of income, as
prostitutes.  I could also explain that the sanctions against persons
who have not paid the head tax would be lethal and would be contracted
out to save money.  The rich would pay money equal to the head tax
ammount for hunting liscences giving them the right to hunt down and
kill the poor who had not paid the tax.  This would increase revenue,
cleanse the gene pool, and provide for great live action TV shows.

Well as long as we are ensureing that the poor die or are killed, which
is, of course, a positive social goal, there is no need to quible about
labels.

I don\'t have the faintest idea what you mean.  Ensureing that those who
have demonstrated their inferiority by their poverty do not breed
ensures against future suffering by their descendants.  After all if
they have no descendants the descendants can not lead lives of
suffering.  I am truly motivated only by compassion for these
untermenschen who would lead lives not worth living.

Two obvious questions. How did they get there undetected?  How do they
hope to get away before the SDBs / missiles can run them down? It\'s a
very long way to the jump point. 

The logistics are still stacked heavily against them. Moons of GGs are a
very long way apart, in differing orbital planes. Even at their closest
they would be tens of thousands of miles apart. 

Why would you plot an exit vector that took you anywhere near a large
body.  Standard caution would tell you to give it a wide berth.

>>Maneuvering at high speeds through 
>>the orbital masses of a gas giant is dangerous. 

Poetic imagery, but it\'s not really like that.

The orbital masses are not close together, but light seconds apart. In a
high TL systems there would even be navigation beacons on them. (If they
were close together they wouldn\'t stay in orbit for very long).

Starships make fuel scoop runs through the upper atmosphere of GGs and
so obviously have the software and sensors for maneuvering close to GGs.

You would never need to come close to a large body apart from your
target.  Though you might want to use the GG for orbital braking, or
acceleration, to speed up you entry/exit time.

At several diameters from the GG the gravitational forces at work are
tiny compared to even a 1G maneuver drive. 

>>If you come in too fast, you may not be able to escape the pull
>> of the gas giant.  Then you\'re really screwed.

The "surface" gravity of a large GG (e.g. Jupiter) is "only" 2.5G.
Smaller GGs (e.g. Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) have surface gravity around
the 1G mark. So even for a large GG you would only have to be cautious
within 1 or 2 diameters (e.g. when making fuel scoop runs).
Gravitational pull reduces with the square of the distance.

A 3G craft (an SDB perhaps) could actually hide within the atmosphere of
even a large GG. (Wasn\'t there a piranha class SDB designed to do just
that?).

With you on that. Though I am not convinced this is one of those places.

>... don\'t gas giants have brutal electromagnetic fields that
>make settlements on moons near them unlikely ?

And possibly make sensors less reliable or reduce range. So that\'s how
the pirates managed to sneak in! 

Also the Roche tidal stability limit means there wont be any permanent
moons inside about 2 diameters. You may want to mine the rings though -
these generally lie between 1 and 2 diameters out.

Jupiter\'s magnetosphere stretches out to somewhere between 25 and 50
diameters, and is 10,000 times as strong as the Earth\'s. Other GGs
proportionately less. It acts like a giant particle accelerator with
protons zipping around at near light speed.  Radiation levels inside the
stronger parts of it are likely to be hazardous at best. The large moon
IO at 3 diameters out is in the worst of it. You could probably
construct safe habitat at a high TL, though you wouldn\'t want to go
outside :-)

Note that the outermost moons of Jupiter are over 150 diameters out!

Er, No. Doesn\'t this make interstellar travel *without* jump drive
possible in a small ship?

I bet if you did 6Gs for a couple of years, probably less, you could
travel a parsec (ship time - relativistic effects set in after a few
months at 6G) . So when your jump drive fails or you can\'t refuel your
jump drive you just program the course in your computer, jump in your
emergency low berths and wait it out. If there was the possibility you
would design for it.

Wouldn\'t this change the basis of ship design, and alter "history"
somewhat?

I bet there are other interesting consequences of this too.

Don\'t forget that it\'s possible for the astrogators of a group of ships
to do *something* so that when the jump together the spread drops to an
hour or two. 

It\'s mentioned somewhere in regards to naval task forces. I submit that
merchants with an escort *can* do it, even though it\'s about as foreign
to them as keeping formation was to merchant ships in convoys during
WWI and WWII.

A *lot*. Check out the Biosphere II project. 

If all you want is air recycling and partial sewage and water recycling
you can use algae. But this is definitely "emergency rations" type
material. And you\'ll have a *lot* of waste products building up.

But I have to clear up some stuff about "growing" meat. It\'s *not*
cloning. It\'s "tissue culturing" which has been around for a long time.
There are several problems though. First, you have to provide nutrients
and carry away wastes in a manner that the cells you are culturing can
handle. This amounts to emulating the circulatory system, digestive
system, and the kidneys. This can be done.

Second, and not yet solved, you have to convince the growing tissue to
have *structure* rather than be a mass of undifferentiated cells. Think
of "meat" with *less* texture than ground beef. Note that this even
affects the *taste*. You need to control things like muscle fiber size,
fat marbling, etc.

Third, if you do get the stuff to match the structure of muscle tissue,
you have to "excercise" it. Veal is an example of what beef that gets
no exercise would be like. Too much exercise and the meat gets tough.
And this requires some connective tissues (sinews) to attach these
muscles to something so that they\'ll be working against resistance.

Most likely way of accomplishing this would be to go back to the
"cloning" idea. You need to get a way to cause the growth of an entire
*structure* (a muscle, or an organ like liver or kidney). Note that if
you can do this, you can also regenerate damage to people!

So "vat" meat isn\'t terribly likely until regeneration is. Using
"tissue culture" will get you something that needs a lot of processing,
and you\'ll wind up with stuff about as meat like as bologna, or some of
the soy protein products.

What *I* expect you\'ll have as you move up the scale is something like this:

1. algae
   This gives you air recycling and a food supplement. Water and sewage
   require processing. Air also requires treatment to remove "trace"
   impurities. 
2. algae and some small aquatic animals that eat it. This gives you
   some real meat (fish, or perhaps some sort of amphibian, such as
   newts or frogs). See Bujold\'s "Ethan of Athos" for a good
   description of a space habitat using essentially this method.
3. hydroponics or aeroponics. Hydroponics grows the plants with their
   roots in a liquid nutrient solution. Aeroponics avoids the large
   mass of solution by letting the roots growth onto a mesh substrate
   (think fine plastic netting) and using a combination of high
   humidity, drip irrigation, and possibily fine sprays to both keep
   the roots wet and transport nutrients. This has the advantage that
   rather than rows of tanks, you have sheets of netting with rows of
   plants growing up them. You get more plants in the same volume and
   less waste mass. You can even put netting on walls in otherwise
   unused space giving both decoration and extra air/food space.
   You can grow most plants that\'ll fit into the available space this
   way. Anything from wheat to watermelon.
4. hydropnics/aeroponics plus small animals. Likely animals are fish
   (if you can spare the mass for the tanks), "game hens", guinea pigs,
   rabbits, and chickens. And yes, guinea pigs *are* a food animal.
   They are commonly raised for food in South America, especially Peru.

All of the above require extensive processing of sewage into nutrients
for the plants. And likely moderate amounts of fertilizer. They also
still require disposing of waste materials and filtering the air.

At this point, we\'ve covered everything likely to be found in a ship.
From here on out, we are talking about what you\'d find in habitats, and
on airless worlds. 

5. Simple ecosystem. Based on current "natural" sewage treatment
   technology. You run the waste water through a series of artifical
   marshlands. The plants (not edible) are actually quite good at
   filtering out toxins and metals that the bacterial life in the
   marshes can\'t handle. I believe there are even a couple of species
   where you harvest the plants, burn them to relaese the CO2/H20 and
   process the ash to extract worthwhile amounts of metals. In the
   final stages of the marshes you have ponds where you raise fish
   (tilpia). This will handle most of your sewage and a lot of your
   air. You\'ll only need to filter the air and dispose of "toxic"
   wastes. 

6. multiple ecosystems. This is where the Biosphere II people are
   trying to work. Multiple land and water based ecosystems process
   different items in the air and water. All you have to get rid of are
   toxic wastes.

7. like 6, but with lots and lots of animals.

8. planetary ecosystems. Wide variety of ecologies, can handle
   reasonable amounts of almost anything except industrial wastes. And
   can handle small amounts of those.

Obviously, #8 is "we terraformed the planet" or "we can live in the
existing ecosystem". I\'d say Vland is about 7.5 on this scale.

If all else fails, try this:

That\'ll round to the nearest .5 with an ordinary round function.

Not necessarily. Once we figure out how genes get "switched off" so
that cells in the "arm" area grow into arm cells rather than intestines
or something, then we can do that to selectively grow tissues. The
trick will be that we\'ll have to hook in a circulatory system. Or else
grow a heart as well as whatever else we are growing.

But as I said in my other post, that\'ll happen at the same tech level
that allows *regenerating* body parts, because it\'s essentially the
same technology.

Almost true, but not quite. According to Solomani & Aslan, p. 23, the
Imperial calender is based upon the rotation of Capital, which has a 24
hour rotation period and a 364.97 day year.

The difference is slight - less than 7 hours per year, which means that the
calenders become a day out of synch every 2,000 years.

Off course, this information is presented as coming from the Solomani
themselves and may thus be biased; but if a bias was in effect, I would
have suspected the Solomani to claim that the Imperial Calender was lifted
from the Terran, not from Capital itself.

We\'ve had this debate at least twice since I joined the list.  Not all
members have access to newsgroups, and those that have access can\'t
necessarily get every newsgroup.  

(Most of my group aren\'t on the net at all, of those that are only one has
access to newsgroups. Two more have email/web access, and eight have no
net access.)

To briefly summarize, no one is stopping a newsgroup being formed, but
almost no one wants the list shut down either.

You\'re just missing the decimal parameter.  try;

     round(x*2,1)/2

The ",1" tells it to round to one decimal place.  Otherwise I get a "Too

Everything is fine. But consider the REAL SOLAR 100 DIAMETER is around 4.5 AU from Sol so it is a

I am simulateously comforted by the sure signs of (very dry) parody and
discomfited by the fact that I was so certain there was a person who
actually held these views around the list.  A sign that such veiws are not
so farfetched today as I might hope.

All of which is, of course, exactly the point of such dry parody.  Well done.

Happens here too.  In British Colombia the provincial government was
planning on spending more money to catch welfare fraud than they _highest_
estimate of welfare fraud. Meanwhile they were laying off the accountants
who went about collecting unpaid corporate taxes, when there were more
unpaid taxes from dividend-paying corporations than the highest estimates
of welfare fraud.  Somehow this was supposed to make sense.

At the same time they were trying to trick welfare recipients into signing
away not only their own civil rights but also those of their families, via
a \'waiver\' so general that it was basically a carte blanche and that was
condemmed by the government\'s own privacy commission.

ObTrav: Hunt through the papers for different laws, then use them against
the players. For example, the above waiver, if signed as part of, say,
docking procedures, would give the local government the right to inquire
about all financial transaction past present AND future, forever, or the
player and his/her family. Throw in an anti-conspiracy law that defines
any group of more than five people as an association and hold the group
responsible for the misconduct of a single member, and you can hassle the
whole party for a misfiled form from the past.

At that time, I recall calculating that a large TL15 power plant produced
more energy than would be available from fusion of the naturally occuring
deuterium at the specified rate of fuel flow, and that _some_ hydrogen fusion 
was necessary to achieve the power outputs necessary.

So, is a 200-year fuel supply actually reasonable?

mass of the ship in hydrogen, fused at 100% efficiency.

Regardless of whether or not you do pure hydrogen fusion, a fusion reactor has
a sealed fuel supply, so if it needs deuterium, it\'s pure deuterium in the
fuel.  At perfect efficiency, deuterium fusion is roughly 1e+5 kWh/gm, working
out to roughly .9 gram/year/kW.  As a GURPS fusion reactor only weighs .2 lb/kW
(91 grams) 200 years is twice its mass; pure protium fusion would be just
barely possible, if dubious.  Probably fair to give a fusion reactor a 20 year
lifespan, though.

Reactionless drives (in GURPS) and thruster plates (in Traveller) violate
conservation of energy at speeds of 100 meters/second or below.  A perfect
fusion thruster (unlikely) will generate about 4 million seconds of thrust, so
hitting 0.5C requires roughly 98% of the mass of your ship to be fusion
reaction mass, and it\'s only the 2% which remains which is actually going at
.5C.

Damm, should have thought of that.  Good point.

If there are accusasions of  corrupt  petty  officials  then  the
agrieved world can lodge a complaint to the MoJ, if corrupt naval
personal or scouts then the world can make a complaint  to  those
organisations,  and  if  a  corrupt  noble  then  the  world  can
_petition_ that noble\'s leige.

However, failure to pay will result ultimately  in  interdiction.
Before that stage is reached there could be  fines,  a  temporary
blockade, or the Imperium could covertly encourage  a  change  in
the world\'s government!

There _is_ a problem with this set up when the world\'s government
is being contested for a prolonged period of time ... such  as  a
long-running local civil war.  If the identity of the  legitimate
world government is in question then who gets  stiffed  with  the
tax bill?

The existence of a grievence, the appeals process, the  penalties
used, the compromises reached, ... this is the stuff of a nobles\'
campaign (heavy on the politiking).

In this case its the former ... the smuggling is _not_ contraband
items but merely to avoid tax.  Since planets pay the tax and not
traders you might think there is no  incentive.  But  imagine  if
the world\'s trade department gets  involved ... "There\'s  Mcr 2.5
in tax due on this cargo, Mr Solo, we\'ll pay you half that if you
pick the cargo up outside the  starport  and  avoid  the  customs
check."

It is mentioned in the manuscript that while power plants do not require
refuelling, they are touchy and require maintainence once  a year. They WILL
fail if they don\'t get this maintainence; thus the effect is the same. I
should have mentioned that but 1.) I don\'t know how much I\'m actually
allowed to mention and 2.) i didn\'t think about it at the time.

You can do that in T4, very likely, since reactionless drives exist and
power plants have fuel for a year. But many stars will just be too far apart
for that to be practical, and a lot of people would rather avoid the
relativistic effect. But it wouldn\'t surprise me if exploration ships were
designed with extra power plant fuel for that very reason.

And I don\'t think it will have much effect on ship design, because they
won\'t let it. The ships that are being built work just like Traveller ships.
People like me are simply going to gloss over details like that.

Ooooh, Ouch! Those are the kinds of actions that make the players come

Gah.. releasing the Moties on the Third Imperium?  You are a sick person..

Using Mote as a framework for a Droyne adventure might be nice.. perhaps a

Well, I\'m not sure that a scout ship, if you took out the
jump drive stuff, couldn\'t do a parsec STL.  However,
there is an issue about being able to just drive back
from a misjump (which has been raised regarding how
reliable plans to recover from a misjump in T4 are).
I have advocated that there should be something to
limit endurance....

I have some basic problems with the (insectoid) Velox and the
(plant-like) Elowan - they seem improbable from the biological
PoV.  The (saurian) Thrynn are plausible, the Gazurtoid less so,
but not totally out of the question.  The game (Starflight)
didn\'t really characterize any of them well enough to do an
adequate development for Traveller, however, and both biological
niches are already filled with better-developed races in
Traveller - the Githiaskio for the Gazurtoid niche, and the Newts
for the Thrynn niche.  I\'d consider this project a lost cause; it
might suffice for an evening of amusement - if the players know
about the game - but not much more.

Some more interesting possibilities, IMO:

The Sime/Gen symbiosis, from the series by Jaqueline Lichtenberg
and Jean Lorrah, set on a post-apocalyptic Earth [the "Zeor"
books]. (Minor Human Race [MHR])

The humanoid aliens of Star Trek, most notably the Vulcans and
Romulans as written up by Diane Duane (_The_Romulan_Way_ and
_Spock\'s_World_), and the Klingons as written up by John M. Ford
(_The_Final_Reflection_).  Note that Ford\'s Klingons are TOS, not
TNG. (MHR/MHR/MHR)

The Sivaoans from Janet Kagan\'s Star Trek book, _Uhura\'s_Song_.
(Minor Aslan offshoot [MAs])

The Kzinti from Niven\'s Known Space. (MAs)

The Puppeteers from Niven\'s Known Space. (Minor Alien [MAl])

H. Beam Piper\'s Fuzzies/Gashta, as expanded on by William Tuning
and Ardath Mayhar. (MAl)

Most of the other interesting societies were humans, or near
enough not to matter.  The trick is to find societies that are
both interesting and well-enough defined that you can use them
for more than just "local color" - If the locals are 2.5m tall
and have royal Tyrian purple skin, but otherwise act like humans
from Terra, Vland, or Sylea, then what\'s the use?

At its height, the Third Imperium encompassed 11,000 worlds.
That guarantees that you can legitimately create 11,000 unique
societies, and the number is probably closer to 1.1 million, or
maybe 11 million.  But 11 million societies full of humans in
rubber suits is just plain BORING.

Which brings to mind another question, how do you fire a PAW in 
atmosphere?  If the tunnel is in vacuum, there must be a "membrane" 
covering the end, and that will get damaged by the particle beam.

Do we assume that magnetic fields and some ionisation is enough to keep 
out the air?

Geneered off in the corner someplace, of course.  Would they be still 
genetically compatible with the rest of humaniti?

Eh.  Lose the Rommies & the Vulcans, but keep Ford\'s Klingons.  <grin>

The *REAL* Aslan, IMNSFBHO.  Great stuff.

I wouldn\'t call them a *minor* race, though.  The Puppeteers pretty much tried 
running things behind the scenes.  They\'d be a *worthy* adversary for the 
Hiver Shadow Nests, though...

Don\'t forget the Ullers.  Silicate-based, cold-blooded, with 2 major rifts in 
the culture:  the \'tamed\' wogs & the nomads.

Ever read R. M. Meluch\'s \'Sovereign\'?  Check it out sometime.  Same with a 
*LOT* of Poul Anderson\'s alien cultures in his Trader series.  Andy Slack even 
wrote up the Staurni as an NPC race.

Exactly.  But there\'s plenty of room for everything in there.

Well, this assumes they hide out there afterwards to, rather
than just skip out.  It also assumes there is someone in
the system for the victim to radio his distress to.

This assumes pirate "hang around" rather than just take targets of
opportunity as they pass through.  It also assumes FFS2 sensors.
There is also the question of who long it takes to rob, or whatever,
a ship (which also ended up depending on assumptions.)  It also assumes
that you raid ships jumping in.  There is also the question of
how much variation in when you exit throws you off you exit point
(by my calc you can be, assuming 30 km/s orbital velocity, 2.6 million
km from the 100 diam limit).  However, it would seem to be safer
to just concentrate on poorly guarded systems.  I also isn\'t clear
if, once you have the ship, you can use it for cover or take
the crew hostage....

This assumes that doesn\'t worry about his velocity (regarding the
destination system) until after he comes out of jump (ie always
does a running jump).  It also assumes that you don\'t spot
your target at the starport and then just pretend to be another
ship going the same spot at the same time....

I was curious about about the effect of thrusters on in system transit
times, as IMTU I use HEPLaR which has outer to innner transit times in the
weeks - months range, so I whipped up a spreadsheet to have a look. Then I
realised just how fast you could move, so I checked the velocity for a trip
from one side of Sol\'s 1000 Diameter Thruster limit to the other (it is
1000 Diameters, I hope). This is what I got:

Obviously as you can only use thrusters at each end you\'d need some sort of
mid-course correction drive, however as there\'ll be plenty of time I don\'t
imagine it need ne very big, as long as it is fuel efficient. The real
limitation would be that for red dwarfs (like Barnard\'s Star, IIRC) you are
limited to a velocity that you will have time to get rid of within it\'s
1000 Diameter limit. So STL travel is possible with 1000 diameter limited
thrusters, though slow.

This chart also disturbed me in it\'s implications for combat (ignoring
near-C rocks and ships, of course :) - IMO it encourages high-V passes
through the inner system by the attacker and defender, using KE attacks on
each other as they whizz past - not much like traditional Traveller combat.

Make GG refueling reasonably quick, though.

  Is it just me, or does this problem extend to the Imperium game
(the wargame of the Interstellar Wars)? There is in mechanism in
the game for jumping further than two parsecs between systems
under any circumstances (although STL travle is allowed...).

  Jump-3 isn\'t a problem, as that appears only after the period in
which the depicted area is the battlefield. It also signals the
collapse of effective Vilani resistance.

  Jump-1 may be a problem, as supposedly the Terrans start with it
(at least according to some versions of the RoM flamewar), which
means they can\'t actually fight the first war.

  Jump-2 _is_ a problem, if you allow jumps to deep space sites for
replenishment, regrouping, etc., _unless_ you decide that the ability
to do this either i) at all, or ii) accurately (vital for most military
and many civilian purposes) is a unique (i.e., TL independent) invention
similar to the way drop-tanks seem to be presented.

Except that it\'s canon that a ship can come out of jump 100 diameters from
a habitable planet like Earth.  Still, I might want to make the minimum
size 1,000 km.  Can anyone see any problems with that?

There\'s also the problem with radiation when you\'re doing close to C versus

It breaks with canon somewhat (Twilights peak for instance mentions
deepspace jumps) but I wouldn\'t worry too much about that. It gives however
a reason for why the "mains" are supposed to be so important. If you can
jump to deepspace then traders with J1 (due to low TL or whatever) can have
extra jumpfuel and go to juice systems J2 away. With the above ruling they
cannot cross gulfs bigger than their J performance. It also makes it
impossible to cross the great gulfs.

The greatest thing about this rule is (methinks) that deepspace is unknown.
Anything and everything could be lurking out there, especially if you pose
a minimum mass to jump from/to that is pretty big (say 1000 km asteroid or
something).

Well I originally did the claculations to see what effect thrusters would
have in intra-system travel. Having had a look I think I\'ll stay with
HEPLaR, as I\'m not happy with the very short transit times thrusters give.

This sort of thing is only if thruster plates don\'t have a cut off.  Even
if the cut-off is 2,000 AU (as in FFS2) Your\'e still only getting to
around 0.6 C with a 6 G drive.  This is very nice, but you\'ll still need
low berths, and a measly 2 parsec journey takes 11 years. 

Your either going in a ship big enough to do a full closed ecology (algae,
hydroponics for growing food...) which will be a *lot* larger than 100
tons, or you\'re going frozen and hoping that nothing breaks.  Also,
thruster plates are TL 11, so not that many folks are likely to be doing
this. 

Also, thruster plates are better than a Bussard Ramjet, but they aren\'t
incredibly better than one, especially since they have the 2,000 AU cut
off, so they\'re not changing the universe *that* much.

I rather like the idea of small ships being able to do moderate-time STL
travel. 

I would definitely keep the 2,000 AU (I\'d personally make it 1,000 AU for
simplicity) cut off for thruster drives though. 

I also *greatly* prefer the idea of 20-200 year fuel supplies for fusion
plants.  Anything smaller just seems silly.

Unless he\'s thinking of ring systems. *Those* can get messy. Especially

Not true. At .5 diameters (ie the upper atmosphere) jupiter is pulling
with 2.5 g. At 1 diameter, it\'s dropped to 2.5/4 = .625. At 2
diameters, it\'s .15625. That\'s almost as much gravity as the surface of
Luna! A 1g ship had better not get within .79 diameters (1.58 radii) of
Jupiter unless it\'s got *good* contragrav.

And if you figure things in terms of orbital and escape velocities, the
field near a gas giant is *really* nasty.

Don\'t forget that Jupiter is about as "large" as a gas giant can get.
But it\'s *far* from being as *massive* as they can get. When you add
more mass to a jupiter sized GG, the core starts going degenerate, and
that keeps the diameter from increasing. 

We have strong evidence for several GGs that are in the 10-50 jupiter
mass range. That means "surface" gravities in the 25 to 125 g range. 

Ships aren\'t going to go anywhere *near* one of those, except on a
ballistic trajectory that\'s aimed at making a major course change.

The Roche limit is 1.44 radii. And that\'s for materials with "zero"
strength (ie a liquid moon couldn\'t hold together under its own
gravity). Inside that limit the tidal forces get stronger, requiring
more tensile strength to hold together. Note that we have lots of
satellites inside our Roche limit. The tidal forces aren\'t strong
enough to pull them apart. But if you let go of something, it won\'t
hang around for long (but be warned! It\'ll come back an orbit later).

An AU is 1.496e11 meters. The radius of the sun is 6.96e8 meters.

limit = 200 * 6.96e8
limit = 1.392e11

1.392e11/1.496e11 = .93 AU

So the 100 diameter limit for Sol is less than 1 AU.

Slight problem there. Traffic Control is going to *insist* that you
maintain a lasrge interval between your ship and any others, even ones
heading to the same destination (think airliners nowadays). 

That means that you likely will be at least 15 minutes behind him, and
that the best jump point for *you* (if you were legit) is a fair
distance from the best jump point for *him* (because in 15 minutes, the
alignments will have changed by several degrees, and at 100 diameters,
several degrees is a *long* ways).

I think you are figuring *gamma*, not tau. tau=sqrt(1-v^2) (when v is
in units of c=1). Gamma is 1/tau.

Well, that\'s where you need to stick in *something* that requires the
energy input to the drive to be more realistic. After all, at 4.8% of
c, the ship has a KE of 2e14 Joules/kg. And to get that much energy
from fusion (which turns approx .1% of the fuel mass into energy) would
require 2.3 kg of fuel for every kg of the ship.

If I was the Imperial tax collector, I\'d present the bill to *both*

after they paid it, it might turn out to be a misunderstanding. Or
maybe the Imperium *would* decide to recognize them. :-)

If you mean for purposes of letting other people know what has happened then

Once again you ignore the _fact_ that a civilian ship that is conducting
legitimate business while waiting for a target of opportunity has to do
so in its proper identity or at the very least runs a grave risk of
leaving behind abundant clues to its identity (which makes for interesting
problems once they have committed a crime) while a civilian ship that isn\'t
conducting legitimate business is 1) losing money and 2) exibiting suspicious
behavior.

I haven\'t seen FF&S2 and I don\'t have the technical knowledge to judge,

Naturally. Ships jumping out can escape you by jumping.

Depends on the design, of course. But if you\'re talking about standard
50 kg Traveller missiles of the CT days, I seem to recall that they had
12 G-turns of acceleration, ie. they could accererate a total of 12 G
for 20 minutes.

He may prefer a running jump to being followed too closely by a mysterious
ship that just happened to leave the starport shortly after he did and
just happens to be trying to overtake him. That don\'t mean that he always
makes running jumps. Just when there are suspicious ships around.

>It also assumes that you don\'t spot your target at the starport and then

A lot of us find it logical that precisely because that is just about the
only way a pirate can "sneak" up on a victim, any such doings fall in the
"suspicious behavior" category.

Blow up or fail? 

You _have_ to be able to jump into empty space. Otherwise
the Solomani can\'t discover Jump Drive. Which would kind of
a) suck and b) destroy all of canonical Traveller history.

Eris, don\'t get me started. We all know that jump drive is
"discovered" like gold, not like gravity.

I\'ve played with a similar rule for years. I, basically, borrowed many jump
ideas from C.J.Cherryh. The way I see it is that when you fling yourself
into jump-space you end up on a fixed "ballistic" trajectory. If you
imagine space as a curved rubber sheet then you are skipping along below
the curvature. You exit jump-space when you intersect the rubber sheet
again. So, if a large section of curved space gets in the way you are
precipitated out.
My assumption is that the calculations for jump transitions are heniously
complex and take forever to calculate. They allow, in theory, the ability
to travel from any point in space to any other point in space in zero time
(macro quantum jumps). Unfortunately, you usually have to be a point mass
to do so. However, some bright spark came up with an approximation formula
which is much easier to calculate. The price you pay, though, is
uncertainty (6-8 day jump time), risk (chance of misjump), and entry/exit
limitations (100 diameter rule). The reason for the latter is that it is
easier to approximate your trajectory an rely on hitting the curved-space
wall to precipitate you out that to plot an exact course and fall out
naturally.
In general I interpret misjumps as times when either the equation didn\'t
apply perfectly, or drive fluctuations changed the input parameters beyond
the equations expectations. In those cases the target gravity well was
"missed" and your ballistic trajectory just continues on until the next
gravity well (possibly several parsecs distant) drops you out.

Michael Croft outlines some limitations:
>1:You couldn\'t travel 2 parsecs in a jump-1 ship by carrying enough fuel
>for two jump-1s.
Actually interstellar space is littered with loads of junk. There are
bunches of brown dwarfs, failed stars and cometary masses out there. Odds
are that _somewhere_ in every empty hex is a mass in the several 100km
range John specified to jump to. A hex is awfully large.

>2:What happens if they try to jump to an empty region of space?
By John\'s logic, they couldn\'t. Maybe the would just fail to enter.
My by logic, it is possible, but is a much more complicated calculation.
Or, the "miss" and cruise on to the next gravity well.

>3:What happens if they have a minor mishap and are stuck in jump for say,
>four weeks.
>Now, if you\'re three weeks late, Earth has moved
Extending John\'s logic, one might assume that these gravity wells have an
effect on the topology of jump space and, as they move, might affect the
course of the transitioning ship. For example, once in jump space, the ship
may not "travel" in any conventional sense, but exist simultaneously at all
points between the entry and exit point in a like projected in to the
n-dimensional manifold of jump-space. Thus a moving endpoint doesn\'t really
matter.
By my logic, they probably miss and hit the sun\'s gravity well.

>4: You\'re eliminating short jumps and rescue jumps
This is the same problem as jumping to empty space.

>5: Also makes it hard to discover jump drive when your homeworld is 2

Not really, since you can jump from one 100km mass to another in your own
system (Earth->Moon, for example).

No. I prefer the way Piper did things in "Fuzzies and Other People"
(yes, they *did* find the manuscript. It was published about 8? years
back). It still makes them good for use in games, but gets away from
the silly "descendants of marooned spacefarers" bit.

In any case, using the square/cube law as a rule of thumb, since
fuzzies are somewhere between 18 inches and two feet (1/3 and 1/4
meter), that means that they need somewhere between 1/27th and 1/64th
as much life support as humans. ditto for the tonnage required for
their quarters. They *will* need more food than this, because they lose
heat much faster and thus need to eat more. 

Even so, a Fuzzy crewed starship would be cheaper to run in a lot of
ways. They\'d have trouble dealing with the larger bits of equipment,
but I think they\'d make up for it in the reduced space needed for
"access" to equipment.

I think they were more radiation resistant, too. In any case, their
indifference to such a wide range of temperatures makes them well
suited to being engineering crew. Heck, if I recall correctly, you
could *freeze* one of them (say due to an accidental LH2 spill) and
he\'d be fine when he thawed out.

Actually, it pays to check out anthropology texts and ethology texts.
There are a lot of *human* cultures that your average Westerner would
consider far more alien than *anything* seen in TV or movie SF, and
stranger than a lot of stuff in *printed* SF. 

And a lot of ethological studies of animals give response patterns that
are quite plausible for aliens, and *utterly* inhuman. Gordon R.
Dickson used to write a lot of stories using that sort of trick. One
species was pretty much based on the way *bears* behave.

He also had a wonderful bit of interaction between humanity and a
species whose "morality" or "ethics" was based on "proper" (ie doing
the "proper" thing) rather than "right". I can\'t remember the title,
but it worked rather well. They responded just enough differently to
keep throwing you off. 

And of course, a lot of C. J. Cherryh\'s stuff is good for this. 

I\'d love to find a corner near the Imperium to stick the whole set of
cultures from the Chanur stories. Ssh\'to, Mahendosat, Kif, Hani, t\'caa,

I think the LBBs say it\'s planetary -- of course, back in
1978 one didn\'t have measurements for the stars in Traveller,
so of course it was planetary.

Should the 100 solar diameter limit be used also?

Jens Makus says such a rule would measure 4.5AU for our system.

This would make patrols more difficult (how much more?) and
would make piracy more do-able (how much more?).

100 diameters from a neutron star or a black hole could be entertaining
:-)

There are quite a lot of neutron stars (pulsars) about. 

Sticking to a 100 diameter limit (1 percent gravity gradient) no matter
what the gravitational field intensity has always been dubious IMO. I
assume the intention was to simplify for ease of game play. This works
reasonably well for planets, though the variance is large. For stars
though the distance should be much further, say 500 Diameters.

Diameters for same gravitational field intensity (Earth =100):

Mercury        61
Venus          96
Mars            62
Jupiter        160
Saturn        103
Uranus         95
Neptune     105
Pluto           27
Sun           530 (nearly to the orbit of Jupiter)

For other star types e.g. red giants, black holes and neutron stars
\'diameters\' cease to be a useful measure.

Perhaps each side would be assessed for the land/population it controls as
of the record date?  It might encourage more guerilla-like actions where
land is not actually occupied or claimed, only live off of.

In any case, I think either th Impies would support one or the other
side...and suspend taxes while they got their house in order...or assess
both in an equal manner.  Using the tax assessment as a tool to make one
side or the other become recognized does not seem to good an idea.  Then
again, there are a lot of stupid nobles out there, eh?

Say you clad a small icy asteroid in a military ultrablack hull, stuck a
large power plant and drive on it and set it off at half a G towards a
neighboring system. It would take a few years to get there and would be
going over 50% of  light speed when it got there. It makes final
maneuver adjustments and cuts all power while several hours from the
target world. It is now virtually impossible to detect. A quicker method
is to jump to the target systems oort cloud and fit a high G booster to
a comet. Then it only takes a few months.

The point is a material object traveling at close to the speed of light
would hit the target planet within seconds of it being detected, if it
was detected at all.  There would be little or no time for a planetary
defense installation to act. I can\'t think of anything useful they could
do anyway. A large antimatter weapon might deflect one, perhaps.

As the force of the impact would equal mass times velocity, even a
relatively small object moving at near light speed would sterilize a
planet.

Now take a step back. Your world is being hostile towards the Imperium.
I demonstrate to you that I have the capability to trash your planet,
say by totaling a small moon with a scaled down version. I mention that
there are a series of increasingly larger ones already on their way. You
are then open to my trade agreements and you let me set up bases and
observation posts (after all I don\'t want you building one). If you are
still hostile then I let a very small first one hit to convince you
(it\'s useful to have a reference site).

Of course with low TL planets even low speed objects will do.

Nasty, but history suggests this is a likely scenario.

Is there anything wrong with my logic?

The jump drive is affected by gravity.  With this premise, the star of a
system and all the planets must be considered.  Also, its the mass that
should be counted, not the diameter, but they are roughly proportional.

According to most who I trust for such things, there are actually not too
many systems where this is relevant (like, less than 20%?).  When the star
size goes up, the habitable zone tends to go outwards as well, so its the
large, cooler stars you need to worry about.

Sure would be easy to defend such a system. Just stack up every defense the
system has to offer at the jump points. Assumably, anything that comes
through is then dead upon arrival, if hostile.

Isn\'t the 6g limit due to gravitic compensation issues? What would prevent
one from creating a 25g+ STL ship equipped with low berths? Would popsicles
be adversely affected by high gs? If not, then triple-redundancy the
systems needed outbound to the 2000 AU limit and put the crew in the
berths. Then you fire the ship up robotically, and wake the crew at
intervals to do maintenance between acceleration and deceleration.

The problem I have with the 200-year supply in Gurps Vehicles is a quibble

The cutoff was actually supposed to be around a thousand diameters (or
20 AU) - to make refuelling in a system\'s Oort cloud or Kuiper belt impractical.
(Otherwise, a fleet can always "ice refuel" in any hostile system with
little chance of interception - outside 20AUs there are too many comets/
KBOs/misc iceballs for any defender to guard.)

It also makes deep space refuelling stations awkward but not impossible,
which is about right for "canon".

John, I\'m no fan of the "c" word. So, if it\'s me (IMTU), the body has to be
at least as large as a gas giant. ;->

The other thing that has always bothered me about the "100 diameters
from...Earth" is that a fleet could appear from out of nowhere right on the
planet\'s doorstep. A fleet jumping in a hundred diameters from Earth would
be able to launch an attack before a credible defense could be mounted.
This is a *bad* thing for gameplay, IMO, and in one of my games will not
routinely happen.  Ship\'s jumping in should have to spend several hours
travelling from the jump point to their destination, and IMTU 100 d from a
planet won\'t do it.

In reason I\'ve always liked the idea of fixed jump points was to get away
from the "fleet pops up" problem (at least, *I* see it as a problem), and
force long trips across systems by ships.

I think so. ;->

And make it a little harder, require a survey before they can jump back
out. So, the PC\'s misjump to an uncharted GG, now they have to find jump
points connecting it to other systems.

Any continuious acceleration drive is going to give you short
intra-system travel, well, if the acceleration is a respectible fraction of
a G. Mass carrying drives (like HEPLaR) and non-acceleration drives (like
Stutterwarp) are much more game-friendly, IMO.

I honestly find that the original is much better. There are patches out

Folks, I want to raise a GURPS <--> Traveller issue that hasn\'t been talked
about yet...sensor and weapon ranges.

I\'ve been tinkering with GURPS Vehicles and have noticed a serious
difference in ranges.  In GURPS, it looks like a ship with hundred million
dollar sensors won\'t be able to pick up other ships out past three or four
hundred thousand miles, and maximum weapon ranges for the big spinals are
even shorter than that.

Traveller, I think, has always had *much* longer ranges than that.  Book 2
talks about picking up ships 10 million miles out, although it does say
that a completely quiet ship can get to within 100,000 miles prior to
detection.  Bruce\'s DSR for FFS2 gives us sensor ranges in the tens of
millions..well OK, millions for ships, but *still* 10 times standard GURPS
ranges for less cost.

Then there is the issue of "grav focused" lasers.  The GURPS range for
lasers is probably about right...if they aren\'t "grav focused." However in
Traveller we\'ve grown use to them being extended by gravity to much longer
ranges.  This is a technology that doesn\'t appear anywhere in GURPS, as far
as I can tell.

I\'ll pretty much stand by my FFS2/DSR sensor ranges; one can tweak them a 
little, but basically, ships are big and bright and space is dark. 
(And I\'d be happy to consider having them included in GURPSTRAV.)

It\'s kind of amusing that all that simulation work just duplicated Book 2 :-)

I think Traveller combat needs long weapon ranges to match the high acceleration
of the ships; otherwise combat consists of 30 seconds of firing followed by 
hours of decellerating and turning around for the next pass, or combat
only occurs between consensting ships. Whether those long ranges should be
achieved through grav focus, handwaving, or just making x-ray lasers practical
earlier is a good question...

That only follows if "discovery" of Jump 1 must preceed "discovery" of Jump
2.  And it assumes that the Solomani really did invent jump...and I\'ve
always half suspected...;->

...like "planted" gold, perhaps?  We know what the Solomani *say* about
their discovery of jump drive, but we don\'t know what really happened.  I
could *discover* an unknown Aztec temple buried in the jungle, but that
doesn\'t mean I built it.

I won\'t allow jumping to empty space...IMTU...and I\'ll let "history" take
care of itself.

Yes, but I, for one, have problems with 100 diameters from small bodies. I
still think it should apply only to GG\'s and up...if you apply it at all.

I still want to know what he means by that. The 4.5AU figure Jens quoted
must be something other than 100 diameters of the sun.

Right, giving really big battles at the jump point, and the need for *huge*
ships operating within *huge* fleets on both sides of the battles. That
sounds about right.

The only requirement is that the fleet would have to be able to jump in
together...and we\'re told that *can* be done.

Since Jump 1 allows for jumps within the system, they may have always used it
to explore and colonize Sol system.  Then one day, somebody thinks "Hmm... what
if we..." and poof!  Jump 2 was invented.

here comes the exact figures for Stars out of my programm:

  Jumppoint = (sqrt(StarMass.ss*SolMass/(0.000025*EarthAcc/Gamma))/1000)/AU

0.0025 is the 10 DIA gravity froam earth
0.000025 is the 100 DIA gravity from earth.

i am following this rule with following arguments:

GDW has neglectect most simple physics. And GDW always talked of planetary diameters and starhsip 
have to bee out of the star gravity well too. Solomani discoverd Jumpdrive far out in there belt. 
Further is you take sol instead of earth nearly all small moons would have there jumplimits inside.

Maybe my numbers are off, but this is what I figured...

Sample from GURPS:

    Max Range           Weight     Volume      Cost     Power   Scan
    3,000,000 miles   150,000 lb  30,000 cf $120.3 mil   neg     49
    
Sample from FFS2:

    Max Range       Area    Vol   Mass   Power  Cost    Sensitivity
    5,000,000 km    1.0     1.0   1.0     neg  5Mcr       13.0
    
So, I guess you *can* build similarly ranged sensors, but look at the cost! 
Not to mention the mass and volume difference.  More
appropriately sized sensors are down in the 100 to 200 thousand mile range. 


You know, if the range quoted in Vehicles was the *effective* range and not
the maximum it might work out. Let me see...

A 100,000 mile sensor has a scan of 40.  A typical Scout has a Size Mod of
7, traveling at 100mps (29).  Let\'s try picking it up a 2,000,000 miles
(-54)...

    40+7+29-54 = 22 <---- automatic detection, recognition, & id!
    
...the book says *maximum* though, and says don\'t even bother checking past
max range.  Of course, the 100,000 mile sensor still masses 25 tons, takes
up 20dt volume and costs over $40 million!

>>Traveller, I think, has always had *much* longer ranges than that.  Book 2

I was using the GURPS design for x-ray lasers...

                     1/2D Range       Max Range    Damage
500MJ X-Ray laser   31,338 miles    94,013 miles  6dx110(2)

...about 1.5 hex at .5D range and 5 hexes max range.  This was with all the
tweeks, I could give it.  I prefer shorter ranged combat than most folks
here, but this is *too* short for me..I\'d multiply by 4, at least...maybe
6.

Bah, you make the mistake of assuming that the fact your sensor _can_ pick up a
ship means that you have a detectable chance of actually doing so -- while a
human with a 20cm telescope can reasonably see a visual magnitude +12-15 object
(corresponding to a signature-0 object at 10 light-seconds) the odds of
actually spotting any specific object of that type is vanishingly low -- new
comets can reasonably be visible for a couple months at AVM 12+ before being
spotted, and given the number of people trying to spot them we can figure the
odds of actually finding such an object are somewhere around 10^-6 per hour. 
Computers could help this somewhat, though with current technology they don\'t
really help all that much.  Looking through your DSR, to account for signal
processing issues I\'d probably replace all sensor ratings with (R/2+5), the
best T4 sensors should be worth a sensitivity of around +12.5

Note that GURPS Vehicles makes the same errors, however ;).

Well, with the exception of high-acceleration interplanetary trips ships
probably won\'t have more than few G-hours of velocity, and a laser range of .1
light-seconds (1 BL hex) is perfectly practical in GURPS.  Most likely, long
range or no, combat between ships will only occur either near a planet (at
which point speeds will probably be fairly low, figure ships pass through one
another\'s range in 10-20 minutes) or between consenting ships.
Also, something which brings thruster-plate endurance down to sane levels would
help here, otherwise a 1-G ship going from a world to a nearby gas giant tends
to reach speeds of around .5% of C, which cuts combat to 5 minutes or less even
with grav-focus lasers.

Well, GURPS allows X-lasers reasonably early, with a range of about 1 BL hex

However, keep in mind that any system considered critical by the Imperium
would have the best sensors credits can buy, backed up by deep meson
gun sites under the planet\'s surface and very likely under the surface of
any orbital moon. Combine the speed of HiStellar automation with
lightspeed notification and you have major planetary defenses which
can go on "War Alert" with minutes, if not seconds, of a command
decision being made. One example of a credible defense being mounted
in the teeth of the best the Zhos could mount was that of Jewell. It was
one of the initial targets and the sucker *never* fell, despite being
TL13
(one level _below_ the Zhos\' best).

Of course, having both a Scout base and an Imperial Naval base didn\'t
hurt.

Interstellar travel with jump is possible now. Where\'s Pioneer gonna
be in a couple hundred years?

Regardless of what you do with t-plates the best possible travel
time would approach the separation of the two systems in light
years--so a jump one even at 0.9999c would take over 3 years. And
however long it takes to get to that velocity, you need the same
amount of time to brake on the other end (and fuel for the PP).

We always had that in campaigns. Hell, that\'s what the low berth is
for when you misjump :-) (that or you starve to death or run out of
air)

However according to my analysis you can still get up to some god awefull
velocities. On the upside using thrusters makes GG refueling followed (or
preceeded by) a trip to/from the main world somewhat practical. With HEPLaR
the transit times are so long that, in our solar system anyway, it\'s just
not worth the bother.

I originally ran the figures because I was trying to see whether thrusters
would piracy easier or harder. That they make in system transits practical
might make piracy more possible because there\'s a bigger volume to patrol,
though mid-course intercepts will be _very_ hard, making patrols easier
because you only need to patrol the likely end-points. OTOH thrusters make
trips to and from jump points much faster, so in that respect they make
piracy harder. I\'m still undecided, blast it.

Yep, especially seeing as for some very tight designs dropping the

One answer would be to start using the gravity gradient as the criteria, or
the field strength. This means that in many systems the jump points will be
way out from the main worlds because they\'ll be determined by the star, not
the target planet.

Even in canon MT and TNE 100 diameters from Earth is way too close. In MT
it\'s about 50 range bands, and as extreme combat range goes out to 100 or
200 hundred bands (the books aren\'t clear, surprise, surprise) you can jump
in and start shooting. In TNE 100 diameters caomes to about 42 hexes, which
is just about the maximum range you can hit a really big ship. You can also
easily shoot stationary targets from that range.

This makes attack and defense a matter of who shoots first - no tactics,
etc needed. The defender would have about 4 - 8 defense squadrons spread
evenly around the 100 dia. sphere about 50 diameters out. The attacker
jumps in and then it\'s just a race to see who can aquire and hit the
opponent first.

I am in the midst of talks with Andrew Keith about the possible release of
his Classic Traveller book "Letter of Marque" (originally intended for
Gamelords, which went bust just prior to it\'s scheduled publication). We are
talking about the feasibility of (if Marc will allow it of course) making
100 (spiral-bound, with covers) copies of the original 80 page
(double-sided) manuscript and my selling it *at cost* to the members of the
TML (and the Usenet FRP newsgroup if there are any leftover copies).

Even if Marc is willing to wave any lic. fee for this one-time printing, to
cover my costs (fee to Andrew, possible fee to Marc, printing costs of 100
copies, postage) the price would be roughly $14-15.00 per book (that price
would include postage within North America, add an additional $1 for orders
outside that area).

*** My question to the list is this - How many of you would be interested in
buying this \'Classic Traveller\' era book? I would need to be reasonably
certain that I could sell at least 70 of the 100 copies before I am willing
to invest my time and effort (as well as money ;) in this project. ***

Before I\'m swamped with email requesting more detail of what\'s in  the
manuscript... 

"Letter of Marque" was to be  the first in a series of Traveller source
books  called "Rogues in Space" by Andrew Keith dealing with
Piracy/Merchants/Etc. in the Traveller universe (actually, LOM was to be
released as a boxed module). At 80 pages (well - actually 79 :) LOM covers
just about everything pertaining to space piracy... This is an outline from
the mauscript of what is covered:

> 16-page rules booklet

> One 4-page folio establishing a privateering campaign, set in the
Drexilthar    subsector (against the backdrop of the Ildrissarian Rebellion,
a logical 
  place for privateering actions to set set).

> Four 4-page folios containing descriptions of four specific ship types
that     might be encountered in the campaign, with deck plans, crew lists,
and other    information for staging specific encounters.

> One map providing the subsector (or parts of up to four subsectors) in
which    action takes place.

> One sheet containing, on one side, character creation data for Pirate
characters from "Citizens of the Imperium", and, on the other, a description
and key to deck plans for a 400-ton Corsair-type starship.

> One map holding deck plans of the 400-ton Corsair.

> One sheet containing a SYSTEM SEARCH DISPLAY, would would permit
maneuverings within a star system according to rules presented in the main
text. This could be used as part of almost any ship combat situation where
searches and stalking were integral to the situation.

> One sheet containing various templates for ships and small worlds for use 
  with the Traveller miniature rules for starship comat.

Whew..I think I\'ve covered everything.

What does GURPS define as a "typical" target? The ranges for FFS2 are
for detecting a scoutship-sized target (few hundred megawatts, few hundred
square meters of area.)

Good god! That buys you about a 4-m telescope at current prices, which 
should certainly be able to see a spaceship in space at ranges greater than
100,000 miles...

This is incorrect, the rules for moving objects in Vehicles are somewhat
broken, but the actual effect of travelling at 100 mps is to compute range as
if it were 1,999,900 miles instead of 2,000,000 miles ;).  Also, 100,000 miles
is a scan of 41, and for $40m it looks like you\'re talking 100,000 mile
atmospheric range, space range is x10(+6 scan).  The actual roll would be:
41 (scan)+6(space)+7(size)-54(range)+skill = skill.

From what I can tell, the game has been changed to make the plot the main
focus of the Genesis version. In the original version the plot was
important, but almost secondary to the exploration of the planet. Also, I
found interaction with the alien races not nearly as much fun because it
was a little too easy. They tended to tell me more without me chasing them
around. Of course, I\'m a bit wierd when it comes to computer games.

I\'ll admit that I didn\'t calculate the signal processing issues (on the
assumption that trying to predict future computer capability is silly)
I should note that no-one is trying to look for comets in any sort of 
systematic way. If one wanted to - and could spend tens of millions of dollars
(the price of a good scanner at TL-8) it\'s probably not impossible even at
current tech levels. A list of  all the stars in the sky down to 15th
magnitude (the HST guide star catalog) is less than a gigabyte; there\'s about 
10^7 - 10^8 stars in it. It\'ll fit in memory on a high-end computer. 
The sensor computer needs to identify every one of those stars every hour
or so and compare each object it\'s detected to that list - maybe ten operations
per star to measure its position and twenty to do a comparison to the indexed
list and decide if it needs to be flagged as discrepant => 10^9 operations
per hour, which is *easy* for current computer technology. Software 
development would be expensive but that\'s in the fixed costs. 
(An interesting comparison is LLNL\'s MACHO microlensing search, which 
analyzes the brightness of perhaps 20 million stars every night and compares
them to template brightnesses to detect brightening of stars that indicates
a lensing event; take a look at wwwmacho.mcmaster.ca for an overview.) 
Astronomers in general - and NASA in particular - have tended to be astonishingly
conservative about large-scale automated projects, though that\'s (thankfully)
changing. 

A couple of other notes: the volume that goes with each m2 of sensor in FFS2
includes computers (so bigger sensors have more computer power -this is 
part of why they\'re so expensive.) In addition, there are a couple of cues
that help one pick out starships from stars - they\'re distinctively much
brighter in the infrared and in the visible they match the spectrum of the
local star (though of course part of what a Military Black coating and 
Thermal Masking buys you is looking more like a star); and, of course, 
starships move relative to the background and can be picked out accordingly.
(The detection levels in the DSR don\'t represent marginal detections - in 
fact, they represent four 10-sigma detections over the course of half an
hour.) 

(The next edition of the DSR will, though, have a couple of rules in it to
model some of this. The first is the concept of "shadowing" - if you 
precisely match the velocity of a target it\'s harder for it to detect
you, because you no longer have relative motion and look like a star.
The second is "charting" - for the first few hours inside a never-before-
visited system effective sensor sensitivities are lower because you don\'t know
where all the local asteroids are (and haven\'t built up a precise star
database) and hence can\'t tell ships from stars as easily.)

Actually, I think it works out to several gigs, I\'d probably want about a
hundred bytes to account for the various false positives you will get for
things like variable brightness stars.

Actually, the computer effort for doing the index and compare is probably off
by an order of magnitude (a binary search on 10^8 objects is 27 comparisons,
and is probably at least 10 operations per compare), but that\'s not the real
problem, simply generating a 10 milliradian map (enough to detect objects in
the asteroid belt by their motion) is at least 10^12 operations (and requires
about that much memory if you want to save it all); 10 milliradians isn\'t
crucial, but get above 100 milliradians and you\'re going to predictably lose
objects against stars.  Still, if computers are sufficiently godly it can still
be done.  Of course, in addition to that you have to update your wandering
objects map (quite a lot of operations) and of course you want to separately
scan for transient events.  Still, detecting objects out to AVM +15 doesn\'t
bother me that much...but you make it reasonable to detect objects out to AVM
+25, which is easily another 5 orders of magnitude in effort.

Well, all the \'distinctive clues\' don\'t really affect the ability to generate

I already do that, Rupert. I don\'t know if I want to go as far out as Jens
has in mind, but somewhere in the 2.5 to 3 AU area for G2V stars would be
good. Or, like I posted earlier, in close to the star.

You\'ve got one sale right here! 

And I don\'t think you\'ll have any trouble selling out your print run.

Now, is there *any* chance Andrew Keith might be interested in working on
more titles in his proposed series?

Actually I also like the Pournelle version of jump. The Aldersen drive\'s
fixed points are dependant on gravities intersection with gravitationally
formed tram lines between stars. They are where ever the math works out
right, as in the case of the Mote, the exit point is wihtin the corona of
another star, which is why the Moties couldn\'t use it unitl intro duced the
"black globe" style sheilds.

However this breaks Trav Canon in several ways. First the Tram lines are
independant of distance so there is no J-1 through J-6 drive. Travel is
instantanious, with extended periods of stl travel fomr j-point to planet or
2nd j-point.

This would negates the Traveller ending to the Interstellar Wars. Earth
would not have the advantage of discovering J-3 to out manuver the Vilani.
Not to mention interstellar war in general becomes a matter of "owning" the
choke points. Fortresses (armed space stations) become a really viable
commodity.

Piracy becomes a much harder job in this situation, if there are jump point
defisive bases then how does a pirate escape? Customs can almost be shifted
to entry and exit of the SYSTEM, not just the world.

Interestingly I beleive this is a better situation for an Empire that
"controls the space, and trade routes between the stars" than the current
situation in Traveller. It\'s easier to control movement in a maze then in an
open feild. Mapping the J-points becomes really important.

I started to work up this type of universe a while back and the project just
kept escallating as I thought of more and more effects generated by this one
little change. Still working on it from time to time. So I wasn\'t trying to
say it wasn\'t a great hook for an adventure, just that it didn\'t fit very
well in the Canon Traveller universe.

I don\'t see that anywhere, what I *do* see is, "don\'t bother doing the
calculation if range exceeds maximum range", but I\'ll take your word for
it.  It *should* be that way.

You\'re right about the scan being 41, I messed up my calculation...

   scan = log(range^6*10^11)

...this does give 41.

Hum, that\'s not *at all* what is in the book.  The table on p.168 lists the
Speed Modifier for 100mps (miles per second) as -29, and that speed
subtracts from the Range Modifier..that\'s the same as adding to the scan
and size modifer..so I still get...

   41+7+29-54=23, and automatic detection

...assuming you are correct about PESA\'s range actually being the effective
range and not the maximum range.

OTOH, if I do it your way and subtract 100mps from 2,000,000 miles and
figure the modifer from that I get...

   41+7-54= -6

...,and as I read it you only apply this Sensor Modifer to the skill if the
number is between -10 and +10, below that is automatic failure and above is
automatic detection.  So, the -6 would be applied to the Sensor Ops skill
of, let\'s say 14, giving an 8 (or 26% chance of detection).

I know, I know!  ;-> GURPS doesn\'t define a typical target, as best I can
tell.  I was using a 100dt (~50,000cf) target.  I don\'t think radiated
energy is taken into account..not explictly anyway.  There is a modifier
for the installation of an IR or Emissions cloak, but PESA (the GURPS PEMS)
ignores that modifer.

Sorry, the 100,000 mile rig is only $4.2 million, that\'s more
reasonable.  It\'s a 1,000,000 mile PESA that costs $40 million. Anthony,
assures me that I\'m wrong about these being maximum ranges, too, so the
ranges might be closer to DSR.

Let\'s try a 10,000 mile (x10 in space) PESA on a 50,000cf target at some
ranges and see...

Sensor Stats:  Mass = 5,000 lb (2 tons);

No idea about wavelength, just X-Ray. The weight is 18,500 and cost is
$1,870,000.  The diameter of any focusing device must be abstracted,
because I can\'t find anything about it.  Nothing specific about the volume
of the weapon either, but it must be fit into a turret or bay which *would*
have volume.

Well, the premise of the case was that there was not fleet
present.  Additionally idea that the Imperium patrols each and
every system is an assumption based on what degree they will
go to prevent each and every incidence of piracy and also on
the question of how many ships it would take to patrol a
system and what, if any, costs should be associated with
those patrols.

That assumes that piracy occurs by ships dedicated to the task
operating out of havens.

Well, this assumes that sensors are unable to distinguish armed
and unarmed ships and that all unarmed ships have at least turrets
installed to look armed (which is contrary to canon).  It also
assumes that pirate never attack ships that are simply smaller
and so less armed.  It also assumes
that you can\'t fake or alter a ship ID.

>Raiding ships jumping out has the problem of them taking their chances with

The assumes both that the only way to get away from a patrol is
to jump early.  It also assumes that the patrol is present (see
above).

This assumes that if you find a system patrolled, you can\'t simply
not attack anything.

Convoy are probably effective.  They do, however, assume a willingness
to bear the cost of such convoys in order to stamp out every last
incidence of piracy.

Again, this assumes a willingness to bear the costs.

This only extends the time between finding targets.  It is only
a problem if you assume the piracy is their sole source of income.

They don\'t exist in the background.  Lots of assumptions about
reusability, costs, ease of counter fire, etc.

Well, you can assume that it happens all the time and they
won\'t react at all, or you can assume they will react to
anything the might smack of piracy be delaying ships from
when they want to leave.

Not meant to affend. My own game has diverged from written Canon by enough
that it bears only passing resemblance to the written Traveller history.
However I assumed that the gentleman that started this thread (can\'t seem to
find the original post) was speaking about "official conversions" for
Traveller.

While I believe that everyones game should reflect his/her own imagination,
I thry and keep anything I intend to try and publish, at least, passingly
close to the official storyline.

That\'s one of the reasons I moved my own campaign to a small cluster of
stars out on the rim, colonized before the fall of the RoM. Out there by the
1100 they reached TL 17 (18 in some areas). They were just starting to see
virus nearing their home territory (and attempting to capture a virus ship
in order to study and attempt to "convert" the thing to a human freindly
version) when we put that campaign on hold to play with the T4 rules and
M:0. Now there is a great deal of interest to pick it up again. My players
liked the high tech toys and want to get back to them

One of the most enduring designs to come out of the Interstellar Wars,
the Tracy class were a general purpose tramp freighter serving the
many colonies of the Terran Confederation. The design outlasted the
Confederation by a considerable margin, examples of the class were
being constructed in the Solomani Rim well into the Long Night. The
class contains most of the features that distingushed Terran merchant
ships of this period. The most noticable is the single large cargo
dual story cargo bay with its massive 12m x 5m cargo ramp. Other
features common to most Terran merchants were: the single 2 ton turret
mounting a triple 14.5Mj laser (this was the most common armarment
used on Terran merchants during the Interstellar Wars). The closed
loop extended life support system, giving the ship unlimited duration
excluding food. The use of a small fission reactor instead of the
large fusion reactors found in Vilani designs.

Only trouble is that the distance at which the gravitational
acceleration matches that 100 diameters from earth is nowhere *near*
100 diameters for other sized *normal* planets.

Since Traveller assumes that all non-gas giants have the same density,
then the 100 diameter rule can easily be shown to correlate with the
*mass* of the planet (thru an inverse cube law). This is the same sort
of rule that applies to tidal forces, or in other words to the *rate of
change* of gravity. 

BTW, this means that for objects *denser* than earth, the "100
diameter" limit is actually *farther* out, while for object less dense
(typical GG, typical stars) it\'s closer in. And of course for the
ridiculously dense object like white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black
holes, it\'s *way* out there. 

This is nice, because it lets you survive a jump that comes out near
such a body. At least for a bit.  Heck, come out near an old black hole
or neutron star (one that doesn\'t have an accretion disk anymore) and
it\'ll take quite a while to *find* the object that popped you out of
jump. :-)

100 diameters from earth is well beyond the moon. 6400 km *200 =
1,280,000 km. Mean Earth-moon distance is only 400,000 km. 

At 4.3 light seconds, there\'s time to get your defenses doing things.

Still closer to Sol than anything else. To the best of my knowledge
the fastest *any* of the probes leaving the solar system is under 200
km/sec. At that rate, it takes almost 9 days to cover an AU. And since
a parsec is slightly over 200,000 AU... I get about 4800 years to cover
a parsec.

You are essentially using r=100*sqrt(m) where m is in earth masses and
r is in earth diameters.

But try that with typical Traveller planets (size 1 thru A), which are
assumed to have the same density as Earth. Their masses are therefore
the cube of their diameter.

2	0.250	0.01563	 25.0	 12.50		 25.0
3	0.375	0.05257	 37.5	 22.96		 37.5
4	0.500	0.12500	 50.0	 35.36		 50.0
5	0.625	0.24414	 62.5	 49.41		 62.5
6	0.750	0.42188	 75.0	 64.95		 75.0
7	0.875	0.66992	 87.5	 81.85		 87.5
8	1.000	1.00000	100.0	100.00		100.0
9	1.125	1.42383	112.5	119.32		112.5
A	1.250	1.95313	125.0	139.75		125.0

Note that 100 times the *cube* root of the mass gives *exactly* the
figures used in Traveller. And *tidal forces* follow that sort of cubic
law. Since they are the rate at which the force of gravity changes,
that means that rather than how *deep* in a gravity well you are, jump
drive depends on the *slope* of the well. In other words, how "curved"
space is. It works better in "flatter" space. 

BTW, another argument would be that we are likely *way* inside the
galaxy\'s "100 diameter limit" calculated your way. :-)

Trouble is, your original aim has to be *very* close, as you can\'t make
*large* course corrections at those velocities.

OK, so 1200 years, close enough. The bottom line is that it\'ll get
there :-)

My point was just that a lot of this discussion seemed to sound like
it would be a seed change in the traveller canon to have sublight
interstellar travel. I don\'t know about about you, but my characters
didn\'t wanna roleplay 1200 years in a low berth :-)

I would expect lower TL cultures to do this (unless they had already
made contact), but everybody else whould just by jump drives from
the trade mission that would appear at some point.

There are a few more consequences in addition to the ones Michael Croft
mentioned:

6. Several adventures, including Twilight\'s Peak and The Traveller
Adventure, require ships to jump to empty hexes for the plot.

7. It makes deep space practically inaccessable, barring multi-decade trips
by HEPlaR. This rules out some interesting settings and plots.

8. Calibration points and deep space refuelling stations become near
impossible.

9. By inducing misjumps, one can now get up to jump 36 safely with no extra
fuel. Even though you can\'t choose the destination; trade, exploration, and
news will travel orders of magnitude faster. It will, at least, obsolete
the Xboat network. Mains become irrelevant, too. Moreover, rifts or sectors
where there are only a few systems will become veritable highways since you
have a high chance of predicting where you\'ll misjump to.

IIRC old-time sailing ships knew they would mess up their navigation on the
way across the Atlantic, so they deliberately aimed off to one side. At
least
that way they knew whether to turn left or right when they got to the next
coastline. Sounds kind of similar...

Did you really mean 10 milliradians? That\'s only 10^-4 steradians per pixel
or 10^5 operations for the whole sky. (And, for the uninitiated, 10 milliradians
is about half a degree per pixel.)

Perhaps you meant ten microradians (about two arcseconds per pixel), which
gives you 10^11 pixels around the whole sky. That\'s finer than you need - you
can measure the position of an object to a tenth or a hundredth of a pixel.
Processing 10^11 pixels per half-hour isn\'t terribly hard; a high-end adaptive
optics wavefront sensor runs 128x128 pixels at 2 kHz, which is 6x10^10 pixels,
and continuously centroids the equivalent of about a thousand stars per frame
(actually just a thousand images of the same star), or 4x10^9 stars per
half hour - less than our starship sensor needs.

Note that you don\'t record the whole few x 10^11 bytes of image data every
half hour - as each image comes in you just find the point sources in it and
record them.

To do a specific example: my numbers (for a standard-black scout, vis sig=-1) 
give it a visual magnitude of 15 at about 500,000 km (range 11.) Reliably
detecting it will take a scanner-13. At TL-8 that is 4m2 of area and MCr 16.
One could use that area for 16 half-meter telescopes (12 for overall scanning
and four for follow-up, so each telescope has to cover a steradian every half
hour.) Each gets a 4096x4096 pixel imager with a field of view about 6 degrees
on a side (5 arcseconds per pixel) and hence has to take a picture every twenty
seconds. A ten-second exposure easily reaches 15th magnitude with plenty of 
signal to noise (leaving ten seconds to slew over 6 degrees and take the next
picture while the CCD is reading out.) You then have twenty seconds to process
each image, which requires bias-subtracting it (16x10^6 operations),
thresholding to pick out the stars (a compare at every pixel, about 32x10^6
operations or so). Each frame will have around 10^5 stars in it - looking these
up and comparing these to the catalog will take at most 10^7 operations. We
have 5x10^7 operations per second in ten seconds. Allowing generous overheads -
you probably want two CCDs per telescope, for example, to measure colors and
rule out cosmic ray hits - one needs a few times 10^7 operations per second -
certainly within the reach of modern civilian computers; you\'d probably do it 
with a few digital signal processors per channel.

The best you can do at TL-8 is a scanner-14, which sees to about 20th
magnitude - and costs MCr 1600, which buys you a *lot* of computers and glass.
The systems that are seeing down to 25th magnitude don\'t come along until TL10,
at which point it\'s reasonable to assume they\'re getting much more sopisticated
(for example, the sensor is no longer a telescope with moving parts but a 
interferometric solid-state array.) The really big sensors also have several
tens billions of credits of computer equipment associated with them.
(I\'m not sure if you have a copy of FFS2 - if not, you might have been mislead
slightly by the FFS1 conversion rules in the DSR; FFS2 sensors are bulkier and
very expensive, to leave room for lots of computers.)

One minor footnote is that most targets are detected in the IR, where they\'re
proportionally much brighter; a scanner-13\'s easy detection threshold is around
a K magnitude of 12. 

Useful footnote for people who\'ve slogged this far: TL-12+ ships (since their
radiators run at 2000K) are actually typically slightly brighter due to radiator
glow than reflected sunlight - you can see the red glow from the radiators of
a sig-0 target with your naked eye at about 8000 km.

Well, the fact that you need a _proper_ identity and you can\'t
have fake ones (or it is too dangerous to do so) is an assumption,
regardless of wether transponders can be tampered with (which is
debatable in itself).  Even if that were true, there are ways of
getting a "proper transponder" with a fake identity.  It also
should be riterated that it isn\'t clear that transponders will
be checked at every system (some people seem to assume that
every system in the Imperium is like O\'Hare airport when I see
many systems being a lot more like a dirt refueling strip like
those used in WWII as being more Traveller like.  It seems
to me in the tendency to make everything work like our western
society, we are loosing the entire laisse faire feelig of the
setting).

Also, the assumption is that you are either conducting legitimate
business or not.  The non-piracy business could range from legitamite
trading to smuggling (to both at once).

Depends on who you ask.  It doesn\'t mean what we can do today

They\'d probably shield it pretty good.  A Faraday cage is easy enough to design.

No, but that shouldn\'t be an issue - consider the Geonee, who I

Actually, Duane really makes them come to life - you get to see
that they are real societies, not one-dimensional caricatures -
and you get to see how the "flat" stereotyping/characterizations
fit into that society - and how it doesn\'t.  Fascinating, to
steal a phrase.  No need to make them green in Traveller, though;
they\'re perfectly adequate as full-humans.

Good stuff, yes - but the Aslan as portrayed in AM1 and S&A are
the "real thing" by definition.  The main problem with the
Kzinti, and probably what relegates them to minor status as
contrasted with the mainstream Aslan, is that they are _too_
prone to reacting emotionally, especially in military offensives
and retaliation.  I could see them serving as Aslan Marines or
equivalent; I don\'t see them rising beyond that.  Also, remember
that if they _are_ similar to the Aslan, they have another
handicap - no females to manage them (Kzinti females were
sub-sentient).

Minor in the sense that they are not widely known, and don\'t have
any sort of major interstellar state.  Perhaps they\'re students
of the Hivers, working in areas away from Human Space; perhaps
they\'re the power behind the Hivers, and the Hivers are really
just fronting for them.

Well, yes and no - there\'s plenty of room, but just anything
won\'t do, at least in my book.  Traveller tends to have a
"harder" SF feel than other, popular SF publications such as Star
Wars, Star Trek, et alia.  That to me means that you\'ve got to
work harder to ensure a "realistic" feel to anything you create.
This was, in fact, my biggest problem with the Hivers and the
Ithklur - although they felt "better" than Niven\'s Kdatlyno or
Outsiders or even the Hhkar from Traveller, it still felt like
the writers were straining to make them work - they were marginal
at best.  The aliens I selected above were the ones that really
seemed like they could really exist.  I\'d rather have seen any of
them instead of the sentient trees, the Asym, the Gratch
(man-headed spiders), or the worm-colony things, in Aliens
Archive.

Incidentally, for those of you who read Harry Turtledove\'s stuff,
add The Race (the Lizards) from the Worldwar series to the list.

Yes. And it\'s my assertion that the assumptions that make piracy possible
do not hold within or near a stable Imperium. Outside, especially in the
Vargr Extents, sure. During the Civil Wars, the Collapse or the Long Night,
no problem. But during in 95% of Imperial territory during 95% of Imperial
history, no way.

Part of why I think the Imperium will take a very hard line against piracy
is that the Imperium rules the space between the stars, and thus piracy is
a crime against the State.

But ships that can pretend to be innocent civilians will by definition have
civilian maneuver drives, civilian sensors and civilian weaponary, making
their use in combat against other civilian ships a very chancy thing. Hell,
steal your own ship instead - it\'s much safer, you already have at least
one key crew member on side, and it\'s worth enough for you to retire on.

Lets see. A Sens 13.5 passive sensor has a resolution at 50 000 km of 2
meters. I\'d say that 50 kkm is well inside combat range (a 13.9m diameter 1
gee ship will get hit all the time at out to 100 000km - it doesnt have
enough maneuverability to dodge during light-lag at that distance). I\'d say
therefore you can probably pick a 3m diameter turret at those ranges, but
you cant tell what it\'s armed with.

Smaller ships can be very nasty if they are properly armed - a 600 mJ
spinal mount laser easily fits in a 200 dt trader, and this can be bad if
you are expecting only 250mJ or worse popguns. Military grade missiles (det
laser warheads, integral LIDAR, PEMS jammer bundles etc) are also a very
rapid force multiplier.

I was more thinking of the target jumping away from the raider, not the
raider jumping away from the Space Patrol. Raiders jumping away may also
have the problem of the Space Patrol putting out an APB - if the raider
gets unlucky and gets an 8 day jump where the APB arrives in 7.5 days, then
the raider may be faced with an uncomfortable welcome.

Patrolled by what ? Will half a dozen 20 ton fighters intimidate our
ethically-challenged civilian enough ? What is the minimum investment that

If piracy is rare, the Navy may will get excited if there is an incident -
gives some Admiral a chance to give his blue-eyed girl some experience of
command under fire, co-ordinating a multi-system action etc.

In any case, a once-a-day convoy will delay you, on average, by 12 hours.
And it\'s easy to enforce - the starport just doesnt let you leave.

What costs ? You need a launch anyway, and if you decide you dont, you just
build a cargo shell of the same size as your fighter, and pack it full of
freight.

There are also potentially major up-front costs to being a pirate, namely
the issue of finding someone reliable you fence the goods through (if any
s.o.b. can find out, then so can the cops, whoever they are). Catching
pirates through the back door is as effective as duking it out with them in
deep space.

Assumption is cost is in the couple of megacredits range (probably about
four), reusability is \'yes\', because you can just tell em to come back if
they dont detonate, counterfire is certainly possible, but while the
ethically challenged civilian is shooting at them they are buying the
target time to escape. Shooting up 12 gee missiles is also tough, if you
dont have a weapons suite designed for it. It\'s even worse if they have 50
000km long range det laser warheads (12 gees at 50 kkm means a zone of
uncertainty of 40 meters ... a lot bigger than most missiles. Personally, I
think you either need nuke dampers putting out big nodes, or properly
designed counter-missile missiles to stop these things).

Canon never was that precise on exactly what things were. In the same way
canon sources never really went into fun military toys before FFS1, we
could assume that t-plate missiles were the extra High Guard +1 factor you
got at TL13 or something. The cheap civilian ones in book 2 can be assumed
to be the Traveller equivalent of Saturday Night Specials.

I\'d say as soon as a ship gets jumped by a tailgater once, you are goanna
have a board of inquiry at the starport, some poor SOB is goanna get
cashiered, and every starport traffic controller is going to make sure
ships stay well away from each other.

Anyway, you dont have to delay the other traffic - just plot them a
different vector. Space is big.

OK. Lets try and drag this debate, kicking and screaming, into something
directly useful for a Traveller campaign.

David, lets pick a part of space where we both agree piracy could happen,
in or around the early 1100s. I\'d say Spinward Marches subsector E is it -
Querion. The Federation of Arden is next door, complete with a class B
starport at Quare/0915. There is a class B unaligned starport on
Thanber/0717, and (most importantly) there are political limits on IN
reactions, due to the Zhodhani just next door. You have a potential market
for stolen Imperial goods in the Sword Worlds - Entrope is close, and I
doubt the recipients of Imperial Occupation will ask too many questions
about the lack of paperwork with a slightly-damaged Far Trader.

OK. As a potential pirate, how do we operate. What sort of ship, what sort
of routes, etc. I want to do a \'how to\' manual for a pirate in the Spinward
Marches.

Once we get that, we can look at countermeasures. The plan is to get a
frameowrk together that a set of adventures can be based on.

   What are the weapon ranges like in T4?  In TNE, 4.3 light seconds starts you 
at maximum combat range (under ideal conditions) - the defenders have little 
time to concentrate their forces before the firing starts.  Balanced, I 
suppose, by how far apart in space/time the attacking fleet\'s ships exit from 
jump space.

Allowing that it *is* YTU, I\'m going to make a few comments applicable
to most TUs.

I suspect that in the general case, this is much like the Napoleonic
era (which Traveller emulates in a lot of ways). 

Sure, your fleet can appear from out of nowhere and be in weapons
range. Alas, that means that your fleet is in range of the shore
batteries. And as with Traveller, there are things a shore battery can
use that your ships can\'t.

Also, when you come out of jump, it takes time to orient yourself. Not
only do you have to determine where you are with respect to the planet,
you also have to co-ordinate with other elements of your fleet that
have come out earlier. 

I think that takes longer than it takes the planet to detect the first
few emergences.

BTW, we have an interesting "command & control" problem here. Does the
senior officer present have command, or is it handled some other way?
How do you hand over control when a more senior officer\'s ship comes
out of jump? On a multi-jump course to an attack, at what point do you
quit waiting for stragglers after the first jump and make the second?
What if one of the stragglers (or worse yet, misjumped!) is the force
commander? 

I suspect that the Imperial Navy has to consider situations we haven\'t
even thought off due to jump not being perfectly synchronized.

But you have to consider that the port type determines this. A & B are
*definitely* in the "international airport" category. C seems likely to
still have traffic control and the like. It\'s the D, E, and X ports
where you have the "small town airport"/"dirt strip" equivalent.

Farday cages are of limited use against strong *magnetic* fields. BVut
some shielding is possible.

And for what it\'s worth, it appears that magnetic fields strong enough
to *levitate* small animals aren\'t hazardous to be around. (Yes, at
high enough field strengths even normal tissue is magnetic enough to be
affected!)

If the fields in the PAW approach those levels, the PAW may be able to
fire a human at a significant velocity!

They\'re in for a *major* shock when frst contacted by a jump drive
using civilization. :-)

On the other hand, they\'d likely be willing to join the Imperium. After
all, that\'s the sort of government they are used to. They\'d get along
well with Vilani, but consider them somewhat rash, and nowhere near
conservative enough or cautious enough.

Oh yeah, I want the ginger contract... :-)

Ok, here\'s the details from my copy.

It\'s called Supplement 5 : Lightening Class Cruisers

The Lightning class were only 60,000 tons,
(nowhere near a Tigress class dreadnaught, at 500,000 tons)

Azhanti High Lightning also contained shipboard combat rules
that differed from both Traveller and Snapshot!,

Striker is a game for 15mm miniatures, plus an associated
design sequence for small (non-starship sized) vehicles
of all types.

It was not designed for large unit actions, more squad to
company level actions. It is unworkable at any larger size.

The design was for ground combat, but the rules do cover
aircraft and grav vehicles, and even the addition of
orbital suppport.

However, IMO, the Renegade Legion "set" Centurion, Interceptor
and Prefect, give a much better feel to Traveller-style
combat than Striker, which feels far too close to modern
warfare for some reason.

The best part of it (IMO) was it\'s rules for command and
control and unit morale.

It\'s named for the striker missions (see definition in Book 4)
it was written to simulate.

IMTU if the planetary defences have more than one sensor station they will
definately be able to because ships entering or leaving jump make
distinctive gravitational \'ripples\' as they enter or leave our universe.
With a couple of sensors a decent distance apart you can get a reasonable
fix on the position of an emerging ship. If lots of ships come out together
and don\'t immediately start squrking the right IFF signals you know you\'ve
got a fight on.

I\'d do four teams of players - the ethically challenged civilians, the

It also implies lo-tech worlds are going to have consistent and massive
balance of trade problems, as they buy all these hi tech goods with no
exports to pay for them.

The goods you are listing are what I\'d call goods with subjective value - a
handcrafted quilt is probably worse at keeping you warm at night than a
TL12 blanket, but people will buy it for reasons other than it\'s actual
usefulness. The vanilla trade system seems to be about goods with objective
value - goods from industrial systems sell well in non-industrial systems,
because industrial worlds build better widgets due to lower pollution
emmission standards or economies of scale, not becasue people like owning
widgets from Industrial worlds.

The other major complication is local currency value. For example, a TL12
Far Trader is functionally almost identical to the TL15 version - it\'s
sensors are a bit worse, it\'s power plant is a bit bigger, but nothing that
important to taking cargo from world A to world B. On the other hand, a
TL12 warship really cant compete with a TL15 warship of similar cost.
Therefore, a TL12 world could discount it\'s TL12 freighters in order to buy
a smaller number of TL15 warships with the TL15 currency so gained.

Similar goods include old, clunky TL8 fission plants vis a vis TL12 fusion
plants. According to Fire, Fusion and Steel (which you should get if you
are at all a gearhead) costs TL8 fission plants at KCr100 per megawatt,
plus Kcr 7.5 worth of fuel per megawatt per year. TL12 fusion plants also
cost KCr 100 per megawatt, with fuel (hydrogen) effectivly free. Purchasers
may be prepared to live with an old, clunky fission power plant (perhaps as
an emergency backup for an asteroid mining colony, to minimise ongoing fuel
costs) if the vendor is prepared to offer an appropriate discount - say,
50%. The TL8 world may be more than happy to sell fission plants for half
their \'value\', if it can get paid in TL12 credits that can buy things
(nuclear dampers, thruster plates, contragravity) that they just cant
produce domestically (think how many nuclear plants ripped out of Los
Angeles class submarines the US government would swap for one
slightly-used, only-one-owner Type S scout).

>Has anyone tossed around modifiers to the Cost and Price tables that take

My feeling is Trader skill is the way to go. If they have it, they have a
chance of finding a good that will let them ignore the TL modifier when it
gets to the export market, whether through being a cut-price
lo-tech-but-does-the-job export or something that people are buying due to
subjective value.

I dont know - maybe a base roll of 12 on 2 dice to find such a good, with a
+2 DM per level of trader skill (+1 per level if you are using the generous
T4 chargen system). Rolling doubles on a success lets the GM mandate a
target market, require special handling procedures or something similar.
Missing the roll by more than 4 means you buy it but get stuck with a cargo
that follows the standard trade rules. Needless to say, one person cant
both do this and be their own broker, and you dont get to find out if it
was a success or a bad failure until you try and sell that forty-ton batch
of genuine hand-made wood-fired pottery. Best way to record such goods is
probably with a * where the TL usually goes.

The other thing this means to me is a lo-tech world being a lot happier to
buy off you, if you will in effect take their exports in exchange (rather
than hard currency). If they are really lucky, you might even help them
create a viable long-term export industry.

Hmm, thinking about it, you might be able to use the same rules to avoid
the Starport Effects added costs on \'normal\' speculative cargoes. I dunno -
Admin or Bribery come to mind as better mechanisms to reflect convincing
the local authorities to let you land somewhat closer to the source of the
goods, and thus avoid the additional costs.

While we\'re about it, every level of broker and/or trader should be able to
cancel one TL difference on the Freight table, providing again our purser
isnt doing anything else in that week. Oh yeah, and after a positive 3 TL
difference between source and market the TL Trade Price Mods should drop by
10%,   per level exceeding three, including going negative - the goods are
just too high tech to articulate properly into the local economy and
society, or need too much in the way of imported maintainence - TL8 sonars
are just dandy to a TL5 navy facing another TL5 navy using submarines, but
very little use to a TL3 navy.

Hmmm, these rules seem to make it worth bringing two pursers along - an
assistant to try and line up freight while the boss is off looking into
good speculative cargos.

Finally, we need some discounting rules ... how about every Cr 1000 (Cr100
for Low) discount on passenger costs gets another 1d6 passengers, and every
Cr100 discount on freight charges gets double the amount of freight ?
Again, you sets your prices and then you takes your chances - discounting
probably wont make you money, but it might cause you to lose less on an
unprofitable route.

Hmmm, I\'m goanna play with these rules for a bit ... can other people
playtest them too ?

Not at all. Finding them would be dead simple. You just aim your jump for
the middle of the empty hex in question. If there is any dark world in the
hex you\'ll end up next to it. If there is more than one you might have
difficulty finding them all, but if there are any at all, you\'re guaranteed
to find at least one. And if you don\'t find any, then jumps to deep space
in that hex would be impossible now and forever.

How about making a jump-6 into an 11-parsec wide rift? You\'d either wind
up at a dark world in the middle of the rift or you\'d continue across to
the other side. In either case the rifts become highways rather than
obstacles.

Oh, I\'m perfectly willing to assume that you can do business using a fake
ID and certainly fake transponders are canonical enough. What I regard as
an assumption too unlikely to be valid is that you can do business
without risking leaving behind clues to the identity of the ship.

I do think that using a fake identity also runs the risk of getting you
in trouble just for that, but that\'s not the big problem. The big problem
is when you\'ve managed somehow to actually capture an opportune target
and the authorities begin looking for you in earnest. You\'ll then have
the option of getting caught or getting rid of your ship. Your multi-
million credit ship.

>It also should be reiterated that it isn\'t clear that transponders will
>be checked at every system

Since "checking" a transponder consists of beaming it a signal and recording
the response, I rather think you will be checked in most systems, though not
necessarily in all of those with class E starports. But that\'s not really
the point. The point is that our would-be pirate can\'t be certain that he
_won\'t _ be checked. It\'s like parking your getaway vehicle outside the
bank you\'re going to rob. There\'s no guarantee that someone will take down
your license number, but you can\'t be _sure_ that it won\'t happen. Now
imagine that your getaway car is a solid gold Caddilac worth considerably
more than you can expect to get in the heist. Does it make sense to rob the
bank in a car owned by you that\'s so expensive that ditching it will cost
you more than the robbery gave you? Yet that is essentially what a pirate
does when he tries to catch an rusted-up old Free Trader.

All it takes to check a transponder is a radio only slightly more
sophisticated than those used during WWII.

1) If you\'re doing legitimate trading you\'re either in a legitimate
merchant ship unfit to chase down and defeat your fellow merchants
or you\'re in a souped-up merchant ship that\'s completely unable to
make ends meet legitimately (and risks arousing suspicions when its
cargo manifests keep showing a lot of empty cargo space). Even if
you\'re smuggling you\'re leaving behind people who know who you are
and will be able to sell you out for the reward (And if you pirate
a multi-million credit ship there _will_ be a reward... And that\'s
no assumption...).

There are two small problems with doing that: 1) Even with the coordinated
fleet jump, ships arrive spread out plus/minus 20 minutes (bell curve).
That means the defenders get surprised by the first ship that arrives.
It acquires a target and kills it. Then it gets killed in turn as the
entire defense squadron concentrates on just that one target. After that
the attacker loses most of the first so-and-so-many ships to arrive until
enough of the fleet has arrived to engage all the defenders. Not an
appealing scenario for the attacker, IMO. 2) The attacker has no way of
knowing for sure the strength of the defenders. If a fleet just happens
to be visiting the defending system while the attacker arrives, he is
toast.

For these reasons I believe that any sane admiral would jump in outside
weapon range, preferably with something still left in his tanks, and
check out the opposition before engaging them. surprise attacks are all
very well, but not when you risk being the one surprised.

Phlebas).

A good read, but looks like it is a trilogy (the sequel to this first one
\'the Neutronium Alchemist\' leaves it all hanging).

The technology used is very Traveller in some ways - ships have jump nodes,
a certain number of which are needed to successfully jump, they use both
reaction drives (fusion, anti-matter and ion) and a thruster like drive.
Combat uses beam weapons along with \'combat wasps\' which are basically RPVs
with gamma detontation weapons, nukes and KKMs. Jump is limited by
gravitional fields - and misjumps will occur if within them.

It is almost a view of what Traveller could be with a degree of nano-tech
and a limited capabilty to grow \'self aware\' ships (Voidhawks and
Blackhawks, bio-tech ships) which co-exist with more traditional piloted
ships.

Anyway, to the point: In part of the novel, a ship avoids the gravitational
field limit by jumping at a Lagrange point. Do you think that this is
feasible in Traveller. I can\'t see anything that would stop this - in the
book it is described as a very risky manuever as there is only a small
region where it is safe.

Thoughts?

TNE, p. 222, reads identically, except cost is Cr1000 for the first 6
days.

GURPS Space, p. 38:

"Starport Docking Fees (per 1,000 cy per day)	$500"

If anyone has equivalent data from Traveller: 2300 (alias 2300 AD), please
post it or send it to me privately.  I have the basic set, but the only
starship expense discussed is crew salaries.


There are two candidate models for "starports" in the real world:
commercial seaports, and commercial airports.  I looked at both. The
rates quoted are current as of 15 May 1998.  One ton = 2,000 lb.


Colorado Springs International Airport is about a "Class C" facility;
it has full services but no significant repair or rebuild capability.
Charges for non-preferential (i.e., not previously contracted - charter
instead of scheduled airline) aircraft are:

Landing fee:  	$3.04 per 2,000 lb landed gross weight
Gate fee:		$55.50 per use (enplane or deplane operation)
Ground power:		$25.00 per use
Ticket counter:	$31.00 per use (less than 6 positions)
			$73.00 per use (6 or more positions)
Apron parking:	$100.00 per use (> 2 hours)

Presumably, scheduled airlines get a significant break on this, but I
didn\'t check.


Port of Houston Authority covers a collection of terminals best 
described as "Class A" - there are full shipbuilding facilities 
available.  Fees here are significantly more complicated, but divide
generally into two categories:  dockage and wharfage.

Dockage are those fees that pertain to the ships themselves. Many fees
are based on the size of the ship, measured in Length Over All (LOA):

Harbor fee:	$130.35 (vessels 100-249 ft LOA - ~ 229-311 dtons)
		$385.00 (vessels 250+ ft LOA - ~ 311+ dtons)

This covers "expense of administration, ... maintenance and operation
of fire prevention and suppression, personnel and equipment, with the
view of preventing fires, aiding vessels in distress, and aiding in 
the extinguishing of fire in vessels and equipment and in their cargoes
aboard such vessels, or upon wharves and in other facilities in the 
harbor."  I found no mention of "harbor pilots", as such.

Dockage:

LOA (ft)	$/ft/day (main)	$/ft/day (container)
0-199		1.62			1.80
200-299	1.85			2.16
300-349	1.96			2.16
350-399	2.13			2.42
400-449	2.94			3.19
450-499	3.06			3.30
500-549	4.07			4.39
550-599	4.17			4.48
600-649	4.86			5.10
650-699	4.92			5.20
700-799	6.28			6.64
800-899	7.30			7.98
900+		8.50			9.53

Notice that these are not linear - there are breakpoints, which 
correspond to the lengths of the various wharves.  The larger a ship
is, the fewer wharves it can actually use.

Rates are charged in 12-hour blocks, and go down over time:
3d day	90%
4th day	75%
5th day	60%
6th+ day	50%

Failing or refusing to vacate a berth when ordered:	
$1,500/hour (main terminal)
$700/hour (container terminal)

Note that you can be ordered to vacate for refusing to pay overtime to
unload your ship.  You then wait until all the ships that *are* willing
unload before you get your turn again.

Water:		$35.00 + $4.50/1,000 gal.

Electric Power:	no data (supplied by subcontractors)

Wharfage fees apply based on the cargo, rather than the ship.  All fees
have a $15-20 or one hour minimum.

Clearing Berth:	$187.00 (500 tons of cargo or less)
			$256.00 (more than 500 tons of cargo)

This charge does not apply to bulk, container, or vehicle cargo.

Terminal fee:		$2.65/vehicle
			$4.00/passenger

Cranes and handling equipment:	$200-400 per hour, no operator provided

Loading and Unloading:	$19.80/ton (main port)
				$23.00/ton (container port)
				$6.38/ton (container, net weight), or
				$63.50/container (loaded)
				$26.00/container (empty)

There are discounts for more than 3000 units or 500 hours per year.

Any single package (not container), 	5-20 tons:	+$3.18 
						20-35 tons:	+$5.02 
						35-100 tons:	+$9.60

Wharfage:	$2.20/ton
		$0.88/ton (bulk, delivered in pipeline)

Cargo can remain on the wharf for up to 30 days without charge
(\'free time\'). After that:

Demurrage:	$5.00/day (container)
		+$1.00/day (loaded, days 11-20)
		+$2.00/day (loaded, days 21-30), etc up to
		+$8.00/day (loaded, days 81+)

		$0.15/ton/day (days 31-37)
		$0.21/ton/day (days 38-50)
		$0.35/ton/day (days 51+)	

There are also a tremendous number of services available, from marking
crates to opening and resealing boxes for Customs inspection.

Hope this provides a reasonable basis for further discussion.

Personally, I\'d never allow someone to simply target a hex.  I assume that
jump coordinates specify an actual destination.  If the system I\'m
considering is being used, then the only legitimate destinations are those
which contain bodies large enough to materialize near.  If the coordinates
you specify do not contain such a place then you roll some type of jump
mishap.  At this point, I\'d say options are (assuming your not doing a
Hazardous jump) a chance of ending up anywhere within 36 parcecs of your
point of departure, ending up on a brown dwarf or something in the empty
hex, or ending up appearing a week or so later at your point of departure. 

OTOH, I can see saying that wildly inaccurate jump cooridinates (ie no
large mass within several dozen AUs of your destination) produces a
Hazardous misjump.

Roll for jump mishap as above.

Well, I see it more as a tatical challenge than a problem.  But one
could always just have a ship\'s energy signature preceed its exit
by one comat round so that if it tries to come out on top of
enemy forces, they will be ready....

IMTU ships coming out of jump make a distinctive gravitational pulse which
is fairly easy to pick up. By the time they have found any defending
ships/bases the defenders will know where they are. That means that even if
they pretend to be legitemate merchants until they shoot they\'ll only get
the one shot.

It took a huge piracy flameware to show that each side couldn\'t
"prove" their assumptions where the right ones :-)

I think these assumptions are highly questionable and based mostly
on projecting our western, 20th century, expectationas and
sensabilities onto a completely different society.  But then
I can\' prove that either.  :-)

Will it depends on what you mean by "risk".  Nobody is advocating
that piracy is risk free.  But the idea that you can\'t avoid leaving
behind enough clues as to make piracy too risky to try is, as we
established last time, based on how you see things as working.

Well, if you recall, I think this is a reason why you might indeed
just take the cargo.  Though the value of a ship (which you might
just sell as parts) make make some feel risking Imperial attention
worthwhile.  Now you can assume the Imperium tends to capture people
that it sees as having committed high profile crimes, but that is
another assumption.

So that leave E ports as a place where piracy is easier...

And, if you recall from the last flame war, some of us think that
a pirate doesn\'t come in committed to piracy.  If he gets checked
he can either simply give the identity he is doing and conduct
his normal trade.  Part of the problem I had in the last flame war
was the assumptions that piratacy would only occur a certain way
and if you stopped that, you stopped piracy.  This is at odds
with how I see crime as historically operating.  (If you stamp
out one method, a new one pops up).

It not the technology.  It the regulation, the record keeping,

find at odds with the feel of Traveller.

Yeah, which means it is Game truth for games that use FF&S2, not
for any others.

Yes.

From the point of view of the planet you are leaving from, the
mass of the ship increases (and time also changes on the ship,
and acceleration decreases as they approach the speed of light.

From the point of view of those on the ship (which is actually
not a valid physical reference frame because it is being
acclerated), they keep accelerating at a constant velocity but,
as the stars start moving toward/away from them at relativistic
speeds, the distances to them keep changing and they find that
can\'t get past the speed of light.
[This second one is IIRC, I haven\'t gone through this in
years....]

Hans, this depends on how you have jump work.  IMTU, I require that the
ship be locked onto a mass in order to jump.  If the ship\'s jump sensor
isn\'t good enough to pick up and lock onto a mass in the "empty hex" (or
even a non-empty hex) it isn\'t going to jump there...it isn\'t going to jump
*anywhere*...it\'s going to sit right where it is for a week and emerge from
jump space.  That\'s for a normal, non-mis, jump.  Misjumps are a different
thing entirely.

I have three kinds of misjumps, minor, major and catastrophic.  A minor
misjump extends time in jump or changes position *slightly* so as to
inconvinence the crew.  Major misjumps range from long delays, through
damaged systems, to emerging in some random system..including the *very*
rare chance of an "empty" hex.  Catastrophic misjumps are everything a
major misjump is, plus destroyed equipment all the way up to the "ship
destroyed" possibility.

But, back to finding rouge GG\'s in an "empty" hex.  IMTU, this is a GM
option.  If the GM decides there should be something to find in an "empty
hex", so as to allow calibration points and deep space refueling stations,
the GM puts something there.  Finding an unknown rouge is a very difficult
task (IMTU) that requires a big passive sensor, a high Astronomy *and*
Sensor Ops skill, many weeks of study, several "calibration jumps" and
because you don\'t know if you are failing to find something because you are
failing, or there is nothing there to find, it\'s really a "mug\'s" game.  Of
course, inside the settled Imperium the scouts would have found just about
all the rouges that can be found, but on the borders and beyond they are
still rouges to be found.  And because *all* jump points change over time,
breaks (like the short night) would allow these rouges to get lost.

IMTU:
    To find a small GG at 1 parsec with Passive Sensors.
    Formidable (4d) < Passive Reflective Target + Sensor_Fac +
                      avg(Astronomy,Sensor) + Mods - Range_Fac
    
    A small GG would have a PRT of 16  (round(log(Area),0)
    One parsec has a range factor of 50 (round(log(km^5),0)-17)
    Let\'s say the Skill averages out at 12
    And,let\'s say the Sensor Factor is 13
    Mods include:  Deep Space -2, Reduced search area +2, Long Scan (1
                   hour * Range_Fac) +5, Very Long Scan (1 day *
                   Range_Fac) +10, Extremely long Scan (1 week *
                   Range_Fac) +15
    
So, 16+13+12-2+2+15-50 = 6, and that gives you a 1% chance per 45 weeks,
and it can be done, but should take years!

If you have a much larger PEMS (16), you raise your odds to 10%, but this
sensor is going to be too big to deploy on a ship and cost 5,000GCr, and it
should still take years!

Once you\'ve *found* the object, you\'ll still want to perform one or more
"calibration jumps" to refine the location data before making an actual
jump.  A calibration jump is a regular jump up to, but not including, the
actual jump command and each one is going to require the expenditure of the
normal amount of jump mass/fuel and leave you stuck in j-space for a week. 
Of course, if you want to take your chances you can try the jump "cold" as
a Hopeless (6d) task against Astrogation Skill, and run the risk of a
catastrophic misjump if you fail.

I use a fixed 4d task, so I\'ve had to modify the range factor from Bruce\'s
DSR a little, but I put it on an easy to remember 5 @ 30Kkm, 10 @ 300Kkm,
15 @ 3Mkm, 20 @ 30Mkm, etc...scale.  The numbers work with the FFS sensor
scale pretty well.  

Active Sensors, I modified to work *much* better than passives at short
ranges, but fall off rapidly as range increases. Actives use

 4d6< (round(log(Area)*AEMS_Fac/(Range_Fac/5),0)+Skills+Mods-Range_Fac

This is IMTU, of course.  ;->

Is it planetary or solar?

Yes.

Either. So if you were on Mercury, you\'d have to drive out a ways
sublight to jump. There is a good way to make laces for pirates--a
system where there is a valuable place to go that takes several days
at a couple gs to get to the jump point.

As a fellow writer in the rpg industry, I sympathize with the difficulty in
getting paid for your work.  We freelancers are lucky if the damn game
companies can stay in business long enough to publish what they\'ve
contracted us for, and luckier still if they stay in business long enough
to pay us!

I consider it an extra $3 well spent, going to the creator and not some
bloodsucking corporation.  (Standard writer\'s compensation is 2-3% of
retail)

  Actually, it looked awfully as though the "anti-\'s" were simply

  As pointed out previously, our "Western, 20th century" society
is prone to remarkably under-regulating given its\' capability for
doing so, and that historically states and empires have typically
shown a vast concern for security and observation/regulation of
both their territory and their economic extensions.

  It might be helpful if you proposed your own guidelines for the
control, protection, and regulation within the circa 1100 Imperium
of civil traffic of all sorts, giving attention to the division
between high-traffic and low-traffic systems.

  So it\'s not at all unlikely (at least IYTU) that a ship can avoid
leaving any authentic ID info at a stop, or that any correlation of
accumulated data will occur?

  I believe the previous post refers to the threat of losing your own
ship if you get caught on a faked ID; Hans\' would know for sure.

  Specifically, that they make a serious effort to do so, at least.
Piracy (and probably hijacking, depending on context, I guess) does
seem to be a serious strike against a state of the nature of the
Imperium; this could also make such an act be deemed to be inherently
political, which it would in truth be if a polity were ofering a
strategic haven to an organized pirate band.

...
>So that leave E ports as a place where piracy is easier...

In addition to (IMHO) a lot of low-traffic/low-pop systems. I believe
that in certain backgrounds this is referred to as "chicken-stealing",
but even a 50-year old Free Trader is one awfully fat chicken, assuming
that you get more than single digit percentages of its\' value (which
I do; 15-50% of value for ship or cargo could be reasonable depending
on circumstances, IMO).

  Strangely enough, I don\'t recall seeing the assumption that piracy
would occur only one way. I did get the impression that some people
felt that the Imperium would be physically unable and/or unwilling
to do much of anything about its\' internal security situation. The
latter I concluded at least had some shred of believability.

  As it happens, I\'m a proponent of the possibility of casual, one-off
piracy being conducted by ethically challenged, desperate merchants.

  The implications of not doing so are so drastic that the

One interesting development in the Lunion projuect is a system where the
solar jump line is out beyond the mainworld by a large factor.  There is a
world reasonably close (a little frozen iceball), and I\'ve decided that the
starport is in orbit there, rather than at the system mainworld.

This gives me an excuse for a huge Babylon-type station and massive
in-system frieghters.  Also lets me get odd with the mainworld culture.

It would not work because almost as soon as you jump, you travel out of the
lagrange point and thus precipitate out of  jump.

Heh..you noticed that as well? :)

Actually, I\'ve had access to the "Letter of Marque" manuscript for about
three years - ever since the days I was contributing editor for The
Traveller Chronicle. In fact, one of the reasons Kevin and I parted paths
was over our differing views regarding the publication of LOM in the
Chronicle (in a serialized format of course). Considering the heavy activity
in the Piracy thread for the last nine months or so here on the TML, I
figured this might be a good time to try and make LOM available to the TML
as a whole.

I\'m sure there are facets of LOM that will not sit well with either factions
of the Piracy thread, as it does cover many aspects of the thread that have
been, in my opinion, debated to death. I hope however that everyone enjoys
Andrew Keiths\' spin on the topic, and finds it as useful as I have.

I played one using the Annic Nova, too. This was based on the then
popular *Alien* movie, the classic example of sci-fi horror. My players
found the abandoned ship, boarded, and found a number of mysteries and
spooky sounds. The room that had been flamed really concerned them, as
well as the banging on the hull. ;->

What made it really satisfying, though, after the game they commented on
how much it felt like *Alien*. (I didn\'t tell them where I got the ideas,
of course.)

Sensor fac 14 (MCr500 worth ... about a small destroyer) and crew fac 14
(stat 10 skill 4 in T4) gets you 9 on 4 dice.

If we have a Scout Task Force of 10 ships trying this (assume sensors are
50% of total ship cost ... task force therefore costs about 10
gigacredits), then we have 10 attempts per week. This puts the gas giants
on the wrong side of a probability curve (10 ships * 8 weeks = 80 attempts
at a 9 on 4 dice).

This is what essentially disposable 100 dton Scout/Couriers are for. Once
you\'ve found your rougue gas giant, we have a calibration point with
unlimited refueling capability - find one of those through a rift, and you
have repaid your 10 gigacredit investment.

AVAILABILITY - 

This is a limited edition print run, and is *only* being sold over the TML.
I appreciate the many suggestions for making LOM commercially available, but
I am off to Europe in 8 weeks, and haven\'t the time (or frankly, the
inclination) to make this available to a wider audiance. The total print run
is 100 copies - 80 of which will be available from me. The other 20 copies
go to Marc, and when I sale out (and judging from the response, I will),
then your only recourse will be to contact him and see if he might be
willing to part with any of his copies. 

If you like LOM and want to see more, then lobby Marc and Loren for more,
who knows, Andrew or Bill Keith just might be willing re-enter the Traveller
universe (well - one can always dream :)


TO RECAP - 

"Letter of Marque" was written in 1984 by Andrew Keith and was never
published (Gamelords went bust just as LOM was to be sent to GDW for
approval). It was to have been a \'boxed\' supplement for Traveller - similar
in size and scope to "Tarsus" or "Beltstrike" for example. 

This TML edition is a reproduction of the original 80 page typeset
*manuscript* (a total of 160 pages of material, in a spiral-bound, plastic
cover format). There are no illustrations folks - you have been warned ;)
There are however scads of background, rules, design tables, adventure
scenarios, several starship deckplans, and a stellar map of The Carrillian
Assembly from the Reavers\' Deep Sector. 

Note: The deckplans and map are hand-drawn and rather crude (this is a
manuscript afterall) - I am in the process of rendering these into a more
presentable format, and will include my efforts as an insert to the finished
product, so that they will in no way detract from the \'original\' nature of
this reproduction.


MISC - 

I am posting this announcement to the TML and each of the individuals who
responded to my initial post of last week, so please excuse the duplicate
copy many of you will recieve.


Ok...have I covered everything? I hope so, if not, email me :)

In a well-settled area, like the Imperium just about anything out there
should have been already found, that\'s true.  Which is why empty hexes are
empty.  ;->

It\'s on the fringes of settled areas, and beyond where rouge GG\'s are still
being looked for.  Finding one could make or break a scenario.

I\'m not completely tied to the modifiers, the penalty for being in deep
space should probably be higher, and I didn\'t take emitted IR into account. 
So, I\'ve still got some tinkering to do.  IAC, what I\'m trying to do is
combine things about both Bruce\'s system and the GURPS Sensor system with a
task system *similar* to T4\'s.

  Screw factions; I\'m familiar with enough of his previous works to be
satisfied that their material will make sense. I\'m certainly not going
to get bent out of shape if the fuel tankage for an ATV isn\'t listed

Well, to begin with, _most_ societies aren\'t regulated to their
capability (even the Soviet Union wasn\'t).  As far as societies
goes, the US may not be the most regulated in history, but
it is more regulated than a lot and certainly doesn\'t qualify
as the sort of laisse faire society that I see the Imperium as
being.  Secondly, the concern states show for their security is
to keep it within certain levels.  Very few states will go to
any length to stamp out a crime that is already rare.

Well, as I keep saying, you can come up with different ones
depending on your assumptions.  I can\'t prove that the Imperium
would be a certain way any more than other can prove that
it would regulated to the point that piracy wouldn\'t exist.

I personally would punt transponders.
I really don\'t see much interest in them.  If the Imperium
wants to know what ship you are, they ask.  (If you don\'t
answer, then they get suspisios).  They don\'t need
to have the kind of moment to moment tracking  that
O\'Hare airport has (except in places like Regina where you would
probably be required to link up your computer with air control
to get within maybe 50 miles of the port, maybe a bit more).

Inspections for, customs, smuggling, would be done by local
officials (they get the revenues) and would be based on
local law levels.  The Imperium doesn\'t pay a lot of intention
to individuals, simply not condsidering them worth bother
with on a routine basis.  They don\'t routinely inspect ships
for nukes, bioweapons, etc.  Instead they control these
things at the source (which makes a lot more sense).

Space patrols would be based on the amount of comercial activity,
how much a problem piracy has been, the odds of enemy activity,
etc.  Regina has a lot of patrols.  A class E starport off
of the main line might see a patrol vessel now and then.

Well, since I\'ve only ever contended that piracy depends on

be proven either way, I don\'t really have much a problem

I thought the pull would be rather large, but I wasn\'t prepared for the
figures I got when I did the sums. 

1    SM white dwarf  - earth size - gravity at 100 D around 8G
1.4 SM neutron star - 20 km D   - gravity at 100 D around 5 million G
3    SM black hole - 6 km D       - gravity at 100 D around 100 million

I like it. We are considering the underlying topology of jump space, as
well as the overlying topology of real space. This simple formula puts
the interface between jump space and real space on a pseudo scientific
level, and gives us a mathematical argument for the minimum jump.

>BTW, this means that for objects *denser* than earth, the "100

We could also keep the 100 diameter limits for less dense objects.
Arguing that the less well defined a point mass is, the further you want
to be from it before jumping. As another poster suggested, assume that
jump mathematics is based on point masses (the source & target masses
and the ship) - the less well defined the point, the worst the margin of
error.

Obtrav: If you base your jump mathematics on point masses, then well
defined point masses (white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes) would be
strategic  militarily. A well defined point at one or both ends of the
jump would reduce your margin of error and allow much more precise
jumps, or long jumps, or reduce time in jump, or reduce misjumps, or
perhaps allow you to jump closer than 100 diameters. You would also
expect leading edge jump research to be carried out in a system with one
of these objects. They would not be shown on civilian charts, though
maybe those with Navy or Research careers may have visited one.

This is only a relative measure of flatness (relative to the mass being
jumped from) not an absolute measure. But I can go with that.

I calculated *only* 35 light years for the same gravitational intensity,
and that only if all the galactic mass inside the sun was a point
source.

I\'d say that similar factors apply at ports. The bigger the ship, the
fewer berths there are that it\'s likely to fit. Though I also expect
that there will be a reluctance to place ships that are a *lot* smaller
than what the berth was intended for as well. 

I also expect that there will be differences between highport and
downport. And for downport, differences between the 4 "types" of ship:
HTHL (horizontal takeoff, horizontal landing) (like an airplane)
HTVL (unlikely to be at all common)
VTHL (like the Space Shuttle)
VTVL (Like the DC-X)

Frankly, I expect ships to be mostly VTVL and HTVL, with perhaps some
VTHL. HTVL has *no* advantages, and a lot of disadvantages. But I
wouldn\'t be surprised if some Vargr decided to build one just to be
different. And VTHL are likely to be military, as the prime reason for
VT is to use boosters and get up *fast*. 

HTHL will be restricted to smaller ships (above a certain size landing
gear gets ugly). So treat them more like airports. 

VTVL will have to be scaled by stern footprint or some such.

More to the point, the L4 and L5 points are *not* "flat" spacetime.
They are actually potential "wells". That\'s why things tend to stay
there. The L1, L2, and L3 points are "peaks" and thus things can only
stay there if they do a good job of balancing. Even so, they aren\'t
"flat" either.

IMTU the major use of Transponders is to track things that
are beyond your radar range. ID is useful, but if you show
up in a system with the same transponder code as someone
else in system, you just change your Transponder number. 
That way you don\'t need to have a empire wide system for 
assigning numbers and checking that they\'re never tampered 
with, and shifting the data around [1] so that everyone is up 
to date with which transponder numbers belong to whom[2].

What it also  means is that you don\'t need super-dooper
high tech Sensors to track people well enough to be Space
Traffic control. You just need enough to trigger the
transponders, which at least doubles your sensor range to
someone with a transponder, and usually tells you things
about their position, course and velocity, so that you 
don\'t need to maintain a skinpaint to figure that out.

In a military situation, transponders help the computers 
running your battle keep track of all the vessels, rather 
than needing to figure out all the reflected signatures, 
and talk to them to figure out who is who. This makes the 
fog of war considerably reduced. The admiral can figure out 
who is heading where, and what their status is - probably 
including missile load-outs and damage levels.

Usually your military transponders are programmed to only 
respond to an appropriate code, so they don\'t broadcast 
their position to everyone. They can be switched off, 
though this isn\'t necessarily a good idea in an automated 
environment which shoots at things that don\'t respond to a 
"Friend or Foe" query.
 
Does that sound unreasonable?

[1] One of the big problems that I think people have 
ignored in the Piracy debate (what little I have seen of 
it) is the information lag. just keeping track of which 
ships belong to which people seems to me to be a 
hideous problem, especially considering that 
you can\'t be sure which set of information is the most up 
to date.  "Here is an change of owner notice for Ship 
"Example", but the record we have for that ship doesn\'t list either 
party as the owner, so we are missing at least one other 
change of ownership notice."

Just thinking about synchonising data across a minimum 1 
week lag, when the record could have been altered at each 
end hurts my head. I imagine there may be a central record 
office for the ship (Its "Planet of registry" or PoR) which holds 
the master record, and change of ownership doesn\'t take 
legal effect until the PoR is informed. So you submit a 
change of ownership on one planet, and travel to another, 
where until the information travels to the PoR and then is 
rebroadcast to all the other planets that might be 
interested...
"No really, I bought it off the original owner a couple of 
weeks ago, I\'m sure the datawork will come through in a 
couple of months or so. Please don\'t hold me here - I gotta 
mortgage to pay![3]" 

I can\'t imagine the cops holding everyone 
whose details didn\'t match their records - their records
just can\'t be completely up to date, and bankrupting people
waiting for the information lag won\'t make you popular.


[2] Hey, I\'ve got transponder # 475 698 044 233
Does that mean there are 475 billion ships out there?

[3]Just keeping track of your mortgage payments could be
difficult, "No really mister Bounty hunter, here are our
receipts - we paid on this planet, and that planet and the
other planet, I can\'t understand why the records haven\'t got
to you yet..."

Why is it that everybody seem to assume that you actually travel the
distance while in j-space? As jumps take 1 week no matter the distance you
jump I\'d say that when the ship jumps it no longer interact with our
universe and could therefore very well jump from a to b going through a
star with no worries.

You jump, leave this universe, have a boring week, exits at a new place
hopefully your destination, done.

Steve\'s discussion considers the transponders to be roughly
equivalent to the transponders used in aviation today. Current
transponders have several operating modes, from simply squawking
a four digit code to full IFF. Civilian models offer three
modes (IIRC), code only (Mode A), code plus altitude (Mode C),
and code plus altitude plus some other information useful to ATC
(Mode S). Mode C is required when operating in certain controlled
airspace, usually in the vicinity of controlled airports.

When under Air Traffic Control, a discrete code is assigned to
allow the controllers to identify you. In addition, there is an
IDENT button, which causes extra crud to be returned. This causes
your blip on the controller\'s scope to be emphasized. Controllers
will use this to pick you out of traffic, or to quickly locate you
on a busy scope. Traffic operating under its own navigation without
using ATC services uses a common code (1200) that tags them as
"generic" traffic.

I can see a straightforward extension of this model to include
some additional the transponder can return. This could include a
serial number and other identifying information, some of which
could be difficult to tamper with. 

IMTU, I don\'t expect to get too wrapped up in these matters, unless
the players push me there. Certainly, I would expect attempts to
spoof one\'s identity through the transponder would be generally
frowned upon by the authorities that give a damn. Naturally, the
consequences of getting caught (and the probability of getting
caught) are likely to be wildly variable from system to system.

It just occurred to me that a useful fraction of the data on 
x-boats will be updates to ship registry and inter-bank reconciling.
Think of usenet with significant transmission lags between nodes.
Being two hops off the backbone becomes a lot more significant.

What I assume is that if some authority becomes aware that there is a multi-
million credit ship out there that they have a perfect excuse for seizing
and confiscating, then simple greed will make them willing to expend a lot
of man-hours tracking down said ship. Whether they just steal the cargo or
take the whole ship is not all that important, though I do agree that IMO
any pirate lucky enough to actually capture a ship would be daft to leave
it behind.

Some Class E starports. Maybe...

Part of my problem was that I consider \'piracy\' to be a word with a very
specific meaning, to wit, the act of capturing another ship using a ship
of your own.

>and if you stopped that, you stopped piracy.  This is at odds with how I

You still haven\'t provided me with an example of an act of piracy in recent
time when the pirates were using a ship of equal or greater value than the
prey to run down and capture its victim. Modern day piracy does exist, but
it is not analogous to the kind of piracy portrayed in various Traveller
modules.

Detection ranges in an empty hex for a "typical"

Small military sensors (PEMS-13.5) multiply ranges by x3; big military
or science sensors multiply range by x10. These imply that almost all
large gas giants will have been charted by the Imperium but that small
gas giants will often have escaped detection.

In more detail, natural object signatures:

Gas giants in empty hexes or Oort clouds use the following chart:

detect these objects using Passive/IR.

** gas giant planets and brown dwarfs have radar signature sufficiently
low that they have not yet been measured from the Earth, and I\'m not sure
how to calculate them; in all practical circumstances the target would be
detected visually or in the infra-red first. Some gas giants may have
moons or rings (active signature +0.5 to +4.0) that will be detectable
instead. (Roll 11+ on 2d6 to have reatined a moon, +1 for large gas
giants and +2 for very large; roll 1d6/2 for the moon\'s active signature.)

You\'d have to be going at highly relativisitic speeds before hydrogen   
starts looking like radiation rather than like gas. (Most interstellar 
hydrogen is atomic, btw, not molecular.) Density in interstellar space is
around an atom/cm^3, or 10^-19 kg/m3 of gas. Interstellar dust is in the denser
clouds, mostly, where the gas density is about 40 atoms/cm3 and the dust
density around 10^-10 particles per cm3, so at 10,000 km/s you\'re hitting a
dust grain per square centimeter of hull every 5 seconds (or about 2000
dust grains per square meter per second); average dust grains are about 0.3
microns in radius so each impact has 0.005 joules of energy.

Very little is known about the density of bigger dust grains in our
solar system, let alone in interstellar space - but (very roughly) I would
estimate that millimeter-sized grains are about 10^10 times rarer, so you 
hit one every six months per square meter of hull. They hit with an energy
of about 180 MJ - comparable to a laser hit. So travelling at 10000km/s 
you get the equivalent of a laser hit every six months per m2 of frontal 
area. 

The rate of hits at a given energy level goes up a ship\'s velocity to
the fifth power (roughly - because small grains are more common than big
ones) so at 100,000 km/s you get hit by a 180 MJ impact every three minutes
per m2 of area - and every six months per m2 of area you get hit by 
18,000 MJ, which is seriously bad news. 

Multiply numbers by x10 to x100 inside a solar system. In interstellar space
inbetween clouds, on the other hand, divide rates by a factor of 100 or 
more.

(And any of the above numbers could be wrong by x100 either way - these really
are very poorly studied numbers.)

  I would like to add that X-Boats would probably use this precision to keep
their schedule regular.  No more of this "Was the X-boat destroyed or is it just
late? We\'ll have to wait an extra two days to be certain...".  The X-Boat will
always arrive in a one hour window unless something bad has happened.  Which
would spawn immediate search missions.

I pretty recently posted the HR diagram

> http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/1056/HRdiag.jpg

Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram
The H-R diagram compares the brightness of a star with its temperature. The
diagonal line running from the upper left to the lower right is called the
Main Sequence. Stars lying on the Main Sequence are blue when they are bright
and red when they are dim. Stars in the upper right (called Red Giants) are
very bright, but still appear red. Stars near the bottom (known as White
Dwarfs) are white, but not very bright. This diagram was developed
independently by Ejnar Hertzsprung, a Danish astronomer, and Henry Norris
Russell, an American astronomer.

I don\'t see a need for space traffic control out past sensor
range.  Space just gets too big too fast as you move away
from a planet to need it.  If someone could show that a busy
system like Regina needs to track ships all the way in from
100 diam to prevent collisions, I would think that such
systems would require an active tracking signal (though
my guess one would just use a radio signal rather than have
a seperate box).  However, this would an _enourmous_ amount
of traffic.

I\'m not sure on this one.  It might be worth while.  However,
the defender already knows all the ships around him and can
simply have the computer not display civilian ships.  Whether
he wants an incoming enemy to know which ships are civilian
and which are military depends on whether he thinks that means
that the enemy won\'t attack them and wether wants to use
that to confuse the enemy.  (Which depends on how ruthless
one sees each side being.  I don\'t see the Imperium as
having our modern day sensibilities, witness the common
resort to comerce raiding, but it could go either way).

Well, at .03c hydrogen nuclei (probably not too many molecules out there) have
an energy of around .8 MeV, which qualifies as radiation; of course, protons
aren\'t exactly a huge radiation hazard, you can stop them with a sheet of paper
at those energy levels, and most traveller ships are pretty heavily armored. 
By .1c they have energies of over 9 MeV, and secondary gamma rays are a
significant worry, you probably want a hull several centimeters thick.  By .5c
those protons are hitting with energies of around 500 MeV, and you want a good
part of a meter of shielding.

As for dust grains, they can be a significant hazard, you want a specially
designed vehicle, schemes I\'ve seen involved using some form of regenerating
barrier in front of the vehicle, since the effect of hitting a dust grain is

BREAKOUT
	A ship may exit jump space in two ways: at or near the point planned for, or
at a point where the straight line course crosses a 100 diameter sphere.
	The Planned Breakout Point. The course plotted by the Astrogator may include
a predicted point for breakout. A successful jump will carry a ship to that
predicted breakout point within about 100,000 km. Breakout points are commonly
used in naval operations when maneuvers take ships to locations relatively
removed from astral bodies.

	Bands are 50,000 km space combat range bands. Km reflects actual distance
along the plotted course. T&T reflects variation for trained crews in ships
with finely tuned drives.
	Crossing The 100 Diameter Sphere. An astrogator may plot a course which
crosses the 100 diameter sphere. A ship in jump space automatically breaks out
at the point where that course crosses the 100-diameter sphere (with no
variation). This technique places the ship in the best possible position to
continue its voyage to a world.
	Natural Safeguards. The physics of jump space force a ship out of jump space
when it crosses the 100-Diameter Sphere. As a result, a ship cannot exit jump
space within a world, planetoid, star, or even another ship.

TIME TO BREAKOUT
	A typical jump takes about a week (168 hours). The actual time spent is
random. Military ships can take slightly less time on average.
	Squadron Maneuvers. Highly tuned drives in a squadron of ships, along with
highly trained crews, can make their emergence from jump very close to the
same time (within about a 5 hour window).

DETECTION
	Ships entering and leaving jump space can be detected.
	Entering Jump: A ship entering jump disappears from detector screens. There
is a pulse of energy which is detectable to PRadar (Passive Radar)
	Leaving Jump. A ship leaving jump emits a pulse of energy which is detectable
to PRadar.
	In Jump: A ship in jump cannot be detected. A ship in jump is incapable of
detecting anything also in jump, or outside of jump.

 FOR SIMPLICITY
	In most cases, a jump can be described as a successful movement from one star
system to another. It takes about a week. Travel from the StartWorld to the
Jump Point takes about a day; travel from the Jump Point to the
DestinationWorld also takes about a day.
	Only if circumstances require should the details of jump be implemented.

I was using number propotional to mass^-2, but that was based on memory 
(and a feeling that number proportional to mass puts too much mass in the 
high end.) Interstellar dust should certainly be more prejudiced to the low 
end of the mass function than solar-system dust/meteors, for obvious reasons...
but overall these are pretty poorly known numbers. My scaling from 
0.3 micron objects to 1-mm objects actually used (mass)^-1 (with the assumption
in the later scaling law that it flattens to mass^-2 around 1 mm, which 
was pretty arbitrary.) I think mass^-2 is more reasonable for interstellar
dust, but we\'re really talking about almost-unobserved numbers right now. 

(Clearly it can\'t be "number of objects inversely proportional to mass"
up to arbitrary masses, because you end up with an infinite amount of mass...
in fact, it can\'t even follow that relationship for interstellar material
up to a very high mass, or you end up with too low a hydrogen-to-carbon ratio.)

Hmm. In fact, my initial numbers may have been too high (I should have
stuck to mass^-2 at lower masses, or something like it), which could decrease
the 180 MJ hit rate even at 100,000 km/s to one every ten years or so.

That was what I thought - but does it say anywhere (excluding the T4.1
draft) that the gravitational J-space boundary corresponds to N-space? My
other potential objection would be that the Lagrange point is a point where
two gravitation fields cancel each other out...

At the moment I would be tempted to let players try this manuever, and let
it mitigate some of the bad effects. For example, a <10D jump at a Lagrange
point (!!!!) wiould be treated as <100D etc. Obviously, this isn\'t a
commercial manuever.....

The other thing I noticed about the book was the requirement for a ship to
align itself with its jump destination.

And for the pirates thread

- - each system has a designated emergence zone. If you miss it you are
targeted by the system and naval assets in the area. There is a pirate
attack described, on a non-jump insystem vessel far enough away from the
main planet to allow 20 minutes or so before a response could be expected.
The timings relate to the fact that jump is used in system, and is nowhere
near as long as a Traveller jump. However, the target had been identified
and only two specific external carried cargo canisters were hit....

It all depends on how many ships (which the Imperium buys new) it needs
to use (along with man hourse and other costs) vs. the revenue of
selling a ship used at auction....

You misunderstood.  I think it is quite possible that a pirate would
leave the ship behind if the difference in getting caught was
enough.  I also see the rewards as making taking the ship too
hard to pass up (though this kind of piracy would be less
frequent).  I guess I can see it going either way pretty
easily....

I didn\'t know I had been required.  The pirates in the south china
sea often used proper ships to stop and rob ships that hardly
worth anything.  But, as I said, I think getting caught up in
how thing operate in the late 20th century is a mistake and 
back in history examples of what you are talking about are not
hard to come by.

How do you get radiation from collision with neutral atoms (doesn\'t
bremsstrahlung only occur with charged particles?).  Or is it thought
that most of the interstellar hydrogen is charged?  Also, I think
Loren might want to know what you mean my "highly relativistic".

Regarding payment methods:

For those within the US - either a check or money order is fine.

For those OUTSIDE the US - Please send payment in the form of an
International Postal Money Order. NOT an International Check - my bank
charges me a considerable fee to cash them.

Several people outside the US have inquired about the possibility of sending
cash. I wouldn\'t advise it, but the choice is yours - I certainly take no
responsibility for its safe arrival.  

****

Others have had questions about when to send payment and scheduled mailing
dates:

Please send your payments nows - and remember to include the address where
you want your book mailed too along with the payment. Asking me to reserve a
copy via email is fine, but I will only be sending books to those who have
paid up by the time I take the manuscript to the printer.

I will stop taking orders on June 10th - that is the date the LOM manuscript
goes to the printer. Since I already have the \'proof\' copies ready for the
printer, it will not take them long to make and bind the copies (remember,
we are talking quality photocopies here rather than actually printing). I
expect to have all \'Regular\' (non-autographed copies) books in the mail by
June 15th, and all \'Autographed\' books in the mail by June 20th at the latest.

****

Shipping:

Within the US and Canada shipping will be via normal first-class post.

Outside the US and canada shipping will be via surface-mail. This is time
consuming - allow 4-8 weeks for the book to arrive (it\'s usually faster than
that - but you never know). 

To make my life easier (I\'ve answered nearly 200 emails this morning) - I
will NOT be sending any overseas orders via airmail. I know the wait sucks,
but airmail costs are prohibitive, and it\'s way to much of a hassle trying
to arrange the extra costs/details for those who are willing to pay the
additional postage no matter what. Please be forgiving on this point - I
*am* in the midst of closing up my home and setting my personal affairs in
order for my move to Europe in 8 weeks, and I just don\'t have the time to
coordinate individual mailings.

Lastly, I wanted to thank everyone who has expressed their appreciation to
me for getting this project off the ground. I would however myself like to
thank Marc Miller and Andrew Keith for making this project possible. They
were both very helpful and considerate - particularly in the area of
permission/lic. and authorship/copyright fees and financing - and I would
encourage those who, after having seen   "Letter of Marque" and like it to
thank them as well (complaints you can send my way - I\'ll be outta the
country after all :)

One of my players claimed to have seen something on TV 
(yeah, great reference) about a tanker going missing, 
believed pirated. Not a super-tanker, but none-the-less a 
significant dollar investment. He believes the report said 
it happened somewhere in South east asia.

Has anyone else seen reports of the same thing? [1]

Recently in New Zealand there was a yacht arrived from a
trip England-New Zealand, with bullet holes from pirates
machine guns (pictues on front page of local news paper),
They claimed to have only gotten away because the pirates
propeller got fouled in their fishing lines. The yacht 
wasn\'t a very big one, (though it did have a reasonable 
motor) - big enough for the family of 5, and stuff to get 
them to NZ. I got the impression, though it wasn\'t actually 
stated, that the pirates were using a speed boat of some 
description. This happened in the persian gulf, but I can\'t 
recollect which country it was closest to. Ive no idea what 
the relative values of the boats would have been.

I have also heard reports of a yacht owned by americans 
that showed up in a Nz harbour and handed a Barret light 50 
sniper rifle to harbour police - they had bought it for 
piracy defence. Unfortunately I can\'t remember the source 
for this.

sell Weapons grade plutonium, and selling it to an 
undercover cop, having been talked down in price from 22 
Million USD to 12 Million USD. I have since been unable to 
find any other references to this - it never appeared in 
our local news, and I couldn\'t find anything about it on 
the Web. I was rather interested in it, and wonder if 
anyone else saw any details. Happened about 2 months ago.

[reasonable arguments snipped]

Whatever you choose as a reasonable sensor range, you can 
get by with a sensor system half that powerful if you use 
transponders. That\'s a lot of the reason they\'re used 
nowdays. That and the fact that there is often a lot of 
noise/spurious returns (just how many silver foil wrappers 
of Imperial twinkie bars are their discarded in-system? How 
do they compare to Stealthed ships as far as a return goes?

Also I believe that if a system has a significant navy, 
there may well be reasons to at least keep track of the 
normal system traffic ("We are having a military exercise 
around this dead world, please stay away").

I also think space is big, so I don\'t really expect more 
than a smallish fraction of the space around a system to be 
continuously monitored, I guess mostly in the ecliptic, but 
then YTUMV.

If this doesn\'t work crank up Word 97 or Outlook as well. That should do

Is Sigmund also known as Sigurd? I think that he also used a sword called
Skofnung. Unfortunately I can\'t remember where I saw this.

Why not return to 30,000 km range bands/hexes?  It\'ll fit better w/ previously

Yes, I\'m *sure* they do. 

I\'m tinkering this up strictly for roleplaying, so operator skill is going
to be an important factor.  For passives, I figure skill and sensor
sensitivity are about 2/3 of the equation with the other 1/3 being divided
among target size and various modifiers.  For actives, the sensor\'s
sensitivity is more important at short ranges and the operator\'s skill is
more important at longer ranges.

Something I have considered, but haven\'t worked the numbers out on, is
doubling the Sensor Sensitivities from FFS2 (I don\'t use .5\'s anyway), so a
13 goes to 26 and a 13.5 goes to 27.  This weights the target number toward
the sensors over the PC\'s skill, and that\'s a good thing, but it means I\'d
have to rework ranges.  Try this...


Range_Factor (RF):                round(log(km^5),0)-2

Passive_Reflective_Target (PRT):  round(log(Area),0)+modifiers

Passive_Emittive_Target (PET):    round(log(kw),0)+modifiers

Active_Reflective_Target (ART):   round(log(Area),0)+modifiers (min 1)

These numbers assume a "IR-neutral" drive.  If the ship is maneuvering with
a reaction drive (or if T-plates put out high heat IYTU) add 2 to the
target numbers.  If the sensor platform goes active it raises its PET by 4
for everybody, and guarantees it will be detected by any ship that it
detects.

Is this better, or do I need to raise Sensitivity more?  And I\'m not really
happy with the way emitted signature is working out.  I\'d like the PET to
drop a little more for ships running quiet.  What I might do is just have a
standard -2 modifier for a ship running quiet..that would mean it was using
1% standard operating power.

That\'s what I\'m going to be using for tactical level space movement/combat.
Light seconds make sense, to me, for measurement of general space movement
and .1LS (30,000) for the tactical level, and I think it works as you go
lower too.

30,000 km
 3,000 km
   300 km
    30 km
     3 km
    300 m
     30 m
      3 m
     .3 m (1 foot)

Personally, I like this scale better than the T4/4.1 one.

Not a bad idea; I don\'t like the 0.5\'s much either. Still, even with this,
adding sensitivy and skill seems too much to me - remember that even a +1 (old
system) represents a hundred times as much hardware, a +2 is *ten thousand*
times as much hardware - it\'s kind of like saying that a skilled person with a
teaspoon can move as much water as an average person with a gallon bucket.

Something like Ander\'s approach (successful skill role adds +1 or +2 to 
sensor) or mine (a skilled individual can make a detection at signal=0 while
a poor operator needs signal=2) is probably more realistic - but of course
it\'s all a matter of choice...

Not true. If there are, for example, 100 large masses in misjump range
coreward and 500 rimward, and one can only misjump to a large mass, then
the chance of misjumping rimward is 5 times that of misjumping coreward.

First of all, the Imperium has thousands of X-boats available. And the
important thing about an X-boat is not that each one goes to a specific
destination, but that the entire Imperium is covered. This can be done much
faster if a typical X-boat travels at jump-14 or so than jump-4, even if
you can\'t choose the destination for each one.

Consider a few dozen X-boats at a single system near the center of the
Imperium. Now, you could send them to each neighboring system at jump-4,
using feeder or transport craft to ferry out information to systems not on
the X-boat route, taking a number of weeks roughly equal to the radius of
the Imperium in parsecs divided by 4. Or, you could initiate a jump-1,
using only 1/4 of the carried fuel, and deliberately misjump. Each ship
misjumps to a system from a few to dozens of parsecs away. Inside the
Imperium practically every system is populated, so you transmit the latest
news, get refuelled, and misjump again. If you don\'t happen to hit a
populated system you use some of the excess fuel to misjump again, or jump
to a specific destination if there is only enough fuel for 1 jump left. The
same transport or feeder ships send out the information from the misjump
point. While you can\'t say which of the original ships will get to the
Imperial border, you do know they will get there in a number of weeks
roughly equal to the Imperial radius divided by 7 (assuming an average
misjump of 14 parsecs, and that half the misjumps will be backwards in the
direction you jumped from). This is being really conservative, because you
can arrange for more than half of the misjumps to be in the direction you
want to go...

>explorers.

But we\'re not using blind chance anymore. Remember, in the proposed misjump
rules you always misjump to a large mass. The Imperium know where the large
masses are, and it can use this distribution to calculate the statistical
probability for misjump for any point. If the probability distribution is
not favorable to your final destination, you jump normally to a place where
it is favorable then misjump. Yes, you won\'t know *which* mass you\'ll
misjump to, but through repeated trials you will be able to control the
proportion of ships going to each point. Not so useful for individual
Travellers, perhaps, but a free lunch to fleets or large-scale transport.

There is nothing mysterious about using statistics to get a favorable
average outcome without knowing any specific outcome. Medicine and
economics already work this way.

>Also remember that you could come out of jump around a white dwarf with no
>planets or gas giants (ie no fuel) or in some similarly dubious position.

Well, since the only systems in Traveller that meet this criteria are those
without gas giants or hydrospheres, they are pretty rare. And most of them
are inhabited and have starports to buy fuel from.

Or do you mean millions of invisible masses distributed homogeniously in
all the "empty" stellar hexes that the Imperium doesn\'t know about? In this
case, true, you won\'t have the information to be able to calculate misjump
distributions, but then a misjump has practically the same effect as the
original rule so this would seem to destroy the entire reason for the jump
rules change.

So then don\'t make it random. If you adjust the misjump probabilities so
they can catastophically misjump *only* with severe negative modifiers, you
get death only when PCs do something really stupid. I know there are those
who will disagree with me, but IMHO you are not doing PCs any favor by
letting them survive gross stupidity. It takes less than a single session
to roll up new characters, but changing the laws of physics to let PCs
survive their own stupidity can destroy an entire campaign.

>Sure, I would happily allow a ship to deliberately induce a jump mishap,
>but betting that this mishap will result in an actual misjump, of the

>especially since you can end up dead.

No one suggested any such thing. You don\'t know the distance or direction
of any single misjump, just the probability distribution for misjump to
each system. And for repeated trials or large numbers of ships, that is
enough. You can send out sufficient ships to ensure whatever proportion of
ships you want at each destination. You won\'t know *which* ships go where,
but you will know the statistical proportion of ships at each destination.
And you will not likely end up dead, since the proposed misjump rules will
never jump you anyplace fatal, like the inside of a star or something.

>Travel through misjump sounds like something that simply wouldn\'t catch on
>except among the truly desperate or the truly stupid.

Now here *I* don\'t get you at all. Wasn\'t the point of this entire exercise
making misjump easier for players to survive? If it\'s easier for players to
survive won\'t it be easier for everyone to survive? Otherwise, the players
become multimillionaires by renting themselves as jump insurance.

If you make misjump safe to survive, then what you get is a form of jump
where you can travel dozens of parsecs using only fuel for a jump 1 which
is *safe to survive*.

Look, I have nothing against alternate jump rules; I don\'t use the
published T4 misjump rules myself. You asked for the logical consequences
of changing the misjump rules, so I told you. If you don\'t like the
consequences, change the rules again. For example, not allowing a ship to
misjump farther than its maximum jump rating would make the "deliberate
misjump" technique worthless, even if you could *guarantee* the jump
destination.

I was using radiation in the sense of "ionizing/harmful radiation"
rather than "electromagnetic radiation"; if a neutral wacks into you
at 99.9% of the speed of light, it\'ll damage the cell it hits, and/or
start a cascade of lesser particles which will each damage what they

To be honest, I don\'t know myself what I mean by "highly relativistic",
though one could look up the usual tables of how far particles 
penetrate.

I think I\'m somewhat inclined to back off my previous numbers on
interstellar dust density, though, and replace it with "I don\'t know";
my numbers make a good upper limit.

It was an Australian flagged tanker and went missing off the coast of China. 
There have been several similar incidents around that area. One ship they
found in the Philippines, but most just simply disappear.

I think the skills will balance out, for one thing I envision most target
ships having some sort of jamming equipment aboard, to which an ECM skill
will be added, pretty much offsetting the sensor ops skill where ships are
concerned.

My way might not match your or Ander\'s approach for realism, but for *me*
it is simple to apply and reasonably realistic.  It\'s also more in keeping
with the way I handle tasks.  For example, doing it my way allows me to use
4d for detection, 5d for recognition, and 6d for identification with the
same target numbers (roll 4d, if the object is detected add a 5th die, if
it is recognized add a 6th die). 

IAC, if it doesn\'t work out, I\'ll have other approaches to try. ;->

  Yep. It was also recovered in the region sans $3,000,000
net of cargo. Presumably this was the same vessel I read about
in either the May 5th or 12th Weekly Telegraph.

...
>the Web. I was rather interested in it, and wonder if 
>anyone else saw any details. Happened about 2 months ago.

  Well, another Weekly Telegraph (April?) item attributed
"verified" reports of Iran purchasing materiel and four
functional warheads from one of the Central Asian republics
to Israeli intel sources. Apparently happened several years
ago. It really makes you wonder how good the export controls
on nukes would be in the Imperium.

  I doubt they could stop the actual materials and warheads
from being sold. The more sophisticated det-laser components
would be a limiter, but the best defense would be occasional
close searches with radiation detectors and nuclear dampers.

My personal alternative is Imperial Pensions are paid, funnily enough, in
Imperial Credits. 20 years in the Navy for a pension of Cr4000 a year isnt
a good deal if you are an industrial worker on a hi-tech planet where
earnings are Cr10 000 a year and your local credit trades at parity with
the ICr. But it\'s a differenct story if you\'re from some TL8 dirtball where
average income is Cr 6000 a year and the local credit trades at three to
the Imperial.

Now, this also potentially gives you a set of nice class distinctions - the
officer classes will tend to be young nobles doing Their Bit for the
Imperium, while the NCOs and crew tend to be lifers from dirtballs in the
boondocks.

  They were, however, specifically limited by historical conditions.
You might note that under certain other conditions, _piracy did not
exist_ in any meaningful sense. It then follows that it might be
useful to compare the two sets of circumstances.

kilometer womemeters. It\'s forty-eight meters long, an an an about twenny
five centimeters in waaaadius.

An an an my brain hurts from doin all this on a sliiiide rule, so we
installed a couple of cee-peeee two computers in in in it. They took up
four cuuubic meters an an an cost point one fiiive megacwedits. Weeee took
out four months of fission fuel to fit them in so we have one two threeeee
four five six seven eight left. They do all the booooring analysis for
maintainence and stuff too, an an an they help you point the meson-weson
gunnie-wunnie too.

After this, the Tracey=wacey class Looooongship costs about forty-eight
point niiiiiine megacwedits an an an it has lost twenny four deeeetons of
cargo-wargo an so it now has sevenny four. Plus five spare staaaaate rooms.
Weeeeee reckon you should charge people extra to fire the meson-weson gun.
An an an you could think about taking out the liiiiitttle laser-wasers and
putting in one big one. Or a couple of fusie-wusie guns for use in
aaaaatmospheres an on planetary surfaces an stuff.

If you dont wanna put in a real jumpie-wumpie driiiive and a real
gunnie-wunnie you could just rip thirty cuuubic meters of power-wower
plant. You dont neeeeeed 116 megawatts ... you need fifty one for the jump
drives, an you need seventy for the t-plates an an an call it ten for
everything else. So you neeeeed eighty megawatts of powwwwwwwowowower at
any one time. You\'ve got one hunnerd and twelve, so you can put in a
fisssie-wissie power plant thirty-wirty cuuuubic meters smaller in an an an
save yourself three miiiiiillllion credits or so on sticker-wicker cost. An
you could lose the active-wactive sensor-wensor an save another million
cwedits. This should take the sticker-wicker price down to thirty-four an a
half megacwedits, aaaafter you install some reaaallly-real computer-wuters.

I\'m goannna go sleeeeeeep now. 

Nighty night Uncie.

Wow. Now I know why I havent channeled Cousin Ditzie in so long.

Andrew, it\'s essentially a nice ship. Ditzie is right though - it needs
more guns, and either a bigger jump drive or smaller power plant. There
also should be a freezer for food storage and at least a couple of toilets.

I also dont like the weapon suite. IMO 13.5 megajoule lasers are pretty
useless in space - you need to be able to punch armour, not scratch it.

The Meson Gun is probably excessive, but what the heck. It\'ll be an awful
shock for someone who closes to capture ... I dont know how much radiation
damage a 20 MJ meson gun puts out, but a hit to the bridge or power plant
probably wouldnt do you much good at all.

The AEMS is a spare wheel without an upgraded weapons suite as well -
either upgrade and keep it, or lose it. You might think about losing the CG
as well, seeing how you can pull a streamlined gee in any case. Whats the
hull - crystaliron ? And does it have wings ?

about the number of Escorts needed for a convoy fearful of raider attacks,
I started thinking about Nelson, Collingwood (the admiral, not the footy
club), buying commissions and then the idea popped into my head ... why not
turn buying commissions on it\'s head, and have the Imperial Navy lease it\'s
units out to traders who feel in need for security.

At one fell swoop, the Imperium gets to raise some revenue painlessly, the
Fleet gets some excersise, private navies have less of a need to exist (\'A
wolf is a dog that has missed three meals\') and traders get protection.

Now the negatives are the possibilities of institutionalised corruption,
international incidents and the fact that you might get into a war and have
all your small units off doing other things and that opposing navies could
arrange to bushwhack one of your small units to get examples of your
technology.

The first problem is pretty endemic in the Navy anyway ("I dont mind what
you do, Mr Bosun, as long as you leave the anchor on the ship\'s bow" ...
think what a 1% rakeoff on the Kinuir contract would have been worth).

The second problem isnt that much of a problem, as long as you dont venture
outside your own territory.

The third problem is balanced by the fact that when the War breaks out the
escorted freighters arent going to be able to argue too much about getting
drafted.

The fourth problem could be balanced by using your obsolete units for this
job.

If you can hit a point to +/- 200 000km in a system, then pirates are in
even more trouble. A world with any sort of defenses will notify
neighbouring worlds where the \'approved precipitation point\' will be at any
given date, and put a couple of units there. As the mainworld moves around
in orbit, the \'approved precipitation point\' moves with it, on a known course.

Ships therefore know where they have to aim for before they leave, and
since they will be arriving +/- 20 hours, you just need to aim at where the
APP will be in 168 or so hours.

I have an important announcement for all of my friends and well-wisheres
here on the TML.

I FINISHED THE FIRST DRAFT OF MY SCREENPLAY!!!

For those of you who are interested, the story has changed quite
dramatically.  The last time I posted an update to this list (some four
or five months ago), I was making a film about vampires.

That has changed, for a number of reasons, but in a nutshell, I met with
a guy that does special effects.  I saw his demo tape.  Although it was
competent work, it looked cheap to me--kinda like what you\'d see on Zena
or Hercules.  This is a low budget movie after all.

I didn\'t want my film to look like that, so I made a major decision at
the end of last January.  I went with one of the other script ideas I\'ve
been developing.

This one\'s a drama--a love story of sorts.  It\'s about a guy who knew a
special girl back in high school.  She was incredible, and she was the
one that he still talks about to this day.

So, one day, fate strikes, and his best friend tells him that he\'s seen
her.  She\'s in town.  It\'s some 15 years since high school, but our main
guy, Conner, can\'t help himself.  His heart falls.  He has to make
contact with her.

And he does...and it is incredible...she\'s the girl of his dreams...they
have lunch...and that\'s when he finds out she\'s about to get married...

But, that\'s all I can tell you about it at this point.  It gets pretty
hairy from there.

What the next step?

If you know anything about writing, you\'ll know that good writing is
re-writing.  So that\'s where I\'m at.  The first draft of a screenplay is
always crap--full of cliche\'s, boring scenes, plot holes, and things
that just don\'t make sense or do make for a crappy movie.

Most scripts go through several drafts before they are made
presentable.  This is not an easy task, and it is why there are so many
crappy movies out there.  Writing one of these things takes a lot of
time, effort, creativity, passion, blood, sweat, tears, emotional highs
and lows...and the list goes on.

Let\'s see.  I started writing this particular story in late
January/early February.  I\'ve been on it about 3 mos.  Not bad.  The
average length of time it takes to write a first draft of a screenplay
by most writers is 3 mos.  I\'m completely happy with what I\'ve turned
out in the last three mos.

In this next stage of making this movie, things will go faster.  I now
have a "spine" of a story to make better.  It\'s always easier to take a
crappy movie and fix it into a good movie than it is to fill a blank
page with interesting visions.

The hardest part of writing the screenplay is over, but I still have a
lot of work to do.  After I\'ve tooled the screenplay, fixing it up,
making it presentable and something that I won\'t be embarrassed to show
people, I\'ll pass it around to get feedback from family and
friends--people whose opinion I value.

How long will that take?

Well, not three months--but I don\'t know.  The script will be ready when
it is ready.  It\'s hard to rush the creative drive.  When you push too
hard, you don\'t tend to create--only slush out crap.

But, editing is always easier than creating, and that\'s what this next
step entails.

As always, I\'ll keep you posted.

Yes, I\'m on schedule for actually filmming this movie before the year is
out.

It is happening.

Converted from excess Sniper Class system defense boats (Missile Carriers) the
Twain Class Trader has proven to be a popular seller for those looking for
inexpensive cargo craft with long legs. Merlin Enterprises, in retro-fitting
the discontinued SDB\'s chose to leave the original Contra-Gravity drives
in place, while up-grading the original Heplar drives to Thrusters,
giving the Twain, not only exceptional inner-system manuverablitiy, but
system redundancy usually seen only on Mil-Spec vessels

The original fuel tankage was left intact but diverted to the retro-fitted Jump 1
generator. The tankage allows the Twain to perform 2, Jump 1\'s before refueling,
making it an excellent chose for Fringe area operations.

Merlin also chose to leave the twin light laser pop-up turrets in place. The unusual
system of a turret opeing to the upper surface and a second dropping down from the
lower surface gives the Twain a nearly globular fireing feild. They have also
proved their worth against unfreindly native "clients".

Both the 3 Large staterooms and the 5 smaller crew cabins (capable of double occupancy
with the 2 fold down bunks) feature fully retactable furnishings, a feature some owners
applaud as allowing the space to be used for carry-on cargo, when passengers are
unavailable.

As with all Merlin designs the twin cargo spaces (converted from the original missile
bays) are desigend to ustilize standard 3.85 ton cargo containers. The unusual tri-fold
hatches fold back in such a way as to expose the entire cargo compartmen on the top as
well as the sides, allowing cargo handling equipment easy access to the containers.

Replaceing the original life boat with a standard air-raft allows crews to operate easily
on lower tech level worlds, where modern transprotation is not normally available.

IMTU you can not "deliberately" misjump. You can increase the chance of a 
misjump (hit th go stud at 11 diameters is a good way), but that also increases 
your chances of going boom.

I just point out quite clearly that the passage of time in jump and the passage 
of time in real space are different. Thus one could spend 6 days in jump only to 
find that 6000 years have passed or viceversa. That usually is enough to 
discourage the players.

I think it\'d be best to explain the Elowan as "plant-like" rather than plants.
Still... it would be interesting to put them halfway between the K\'kree and
3I.  Have them ask the 3I for help from hte "vicious cannibals."  I always
thought their "head fruit" reproduction was interesting though.  That being
the main reason for the animosity w/ the Thrynn (who consider "head fruit" to
be a delicacy).  Of course, Virus will make them all toast anyways... ; )

I always liked Star Control better than Starflight, though.  The Yehats, the
Chenjesu, the Alliance of Free Stars.  I\'m contemplating doing a campaign
based on that background.  

A race that would be really cool for Traveller would be the Ur-Quan.
Subjugated by a psionic species and geneered into two varieties, one
philosopher and one warrior.  After overthrowing them (and driving them into a
fate worse than extinction),  the Kzer-za (the green ones) and the Kohr-ah
(black ones) decide they\'re never gonna be at the mercy of aliens again and
(the Kzer-za) proceed to subjugate other species (or put them behind a slave
shield if they won\'t become "Battle Thralls") or (the Kohr-ah) proceed to
"cleanse" the galaxy of life, destroying every race they come across,
spacefaring or no.

Ah, that\'s where we disagree.  I\'d roll 1D6 for direction, then the 1D6 &
1D6 for distance and look on the star chart.  The ship would then land on
the nearest object in that direction.  One consequence of this method is
that often near rifts the nearest destination is your starting point (ie
you pop out where you left a week later).  In any case, I\'d not use any
direction biasing based on mass.  Instead, if I rolled Spinward and 20
parsecs away and the nearest star to that point was Spinward and 16
parsecs away, the PCs would end up Spinward and 16 parsecs away.  I\'d also
always make the number of parsecs rolled a maximum (so if you rolls 36
parsecs and there was a star at 37 and one at 30 you\'d end up at 30)
mainly because I\'d like to keep the 36 parsec limit as an absolute
maximum.  Therefore, if you roll 8 parsecs and only star in that direction
is 9 parsecs away you end up back where you started from.  This method

I use the MT jump mishap rules.  On a non-hazardous (ie no unrefined fuel,
outside the 100 diameter limit) the rolls is 2-12

3-6: the ship is in jumpspace 1D6+4 days

7-10: the ship appears elsewhere in the system (which I\'d rule as around
another planet, or around the sun if there are no other planets)

11+: misjump

15+: Ship destroyed (only posible for hazardous jumps where
mishaps roll 3D6)

So, deliberately instituting a non-hazardous jump mishap only lets you
misjump 1/12 of the time.  I like that system.  In any case, 11/12s of the
X-boats you mentioned being used to misjump messages around the Imperium
make their jump-1 to some other system.  So, to get a message to it\'s
destination more rapidly than jump-4 you have a 1/12 chance of a misjump X
a 1/6 chance of the appropriate direction, X a 28/36 chance of jumping
further than 4 parsecs.  That\'s a 1/92 chance.  Even if you say that
anything going in the rough direction you want to go works (ie the
direction you want to go in, and the hex face on either side of it) you
only end up with a 1/31 chance.  That\'s sending out *31* ships to get one
to the destination faster than jump 4.  I can\'t imagine that doing this
could possibly be feasible for anything other than an incredibly dire
emergency.  In the case of a *dire* enough emergency, this idea makes an
interesting option, which I sort of like. 

As for misjumps being dangerous or lethal if you make a Hazardous misjump
(poor engine maintenance, unrefined fuel, or within 100 diameters..).  you
roll 3D6 and on a 15+ your ship is destroyed.  Now, I\'d never let that
roll apply to PCs making a desperate jump.  Instead, I\'d give them a
misjump and have them arrive with slag instead of a jump drive (or perhaps
merely an empty space and mirror smoother sheered metal where it used to
be) but that\'s still many *millions* of megacredits of repairs even with a
kind GM who lets you live.  Hazardous misjumps have a 10% chance (15+ on
3D6) of either killing you or being so expensive you\'ll likely have to
sell your ship (especially since if there is evidence of a deliberate
attempt to misjump your insurance (if you have it) will definitely not
pay.  So, while many of the X-boats making hazardous jumps would end up
making actual misjumps 1/10 of them would either be destroyed or have junk
for a jump drive, either alternative being an unacceptable loss. 

Thanks, I have the ideas for this type of jump system firmed up quite
a bit now.

    'body' => 'One issue seemingly overlooked is the 3i\'s stance on inter-member warfare:
No CBR and no massive civilian targeting, and it\'s legit, or at least
tolerated (see striker, The Traveller Adventure, many amber zone scenarios
from both JTAS and Challenge, Supplements 8 &/or 11, especially entry on
rules of warfare).

Essentially, at least in the late 3rd Imperium, inter member warfare is
seen as a safety valve, p[rovided it doesn\'t get out of hand. So are
limited trade-wars. Most "Pirates" are actually going to be privateers,
going from brushfire war to brushfire war, armed with letters of Marque,
and "Enforcing" blockades...

EG: Anthrax and Botulina go to war against each other. Only resources
allowed under the Rules of War are local system\'s fleets and armies, and
any mercs (ground or space) they hire and flag. The Navy of Anthrax is
going to be augmenting the local defense with starmercs (pirates under
direct contract) and offering letters of marque to allow other
pirates/corsairs/starmercs to harrass shipping to Botiulina... The
Botulinas will be doing the same... and corsairs in both systems will be
preying on anyone who\'s taking the increased risks.

The question becomes one of why allow them in YOUR system? Frees up you
warships, provides "popcorn" which can help rescue crews, and also allows
you to get the captured cargos, if you word the letter right. Plus the
natural tendancy to spend the loot on your world, if they show proof of
action, plus additional shipping, plus they will be busy rubbing out the
enemies\' pirates/starmercs in order to get back to base, especially if you
provide free unrefined fuel and really cheap refined fuel, plus constant
aids to getting your own shipping through the blockades.

ANd what do the sector and subsector and imperial fleets do? Keep
transponders up and radios listening... and eradicate anyone who breaks the
rules. Ruthlessly, mercilessly, and quickly.

The benefits to the imperial government are as follows: many more troops
subject to war mobilization have real combat experience, and little
infrastructure is actually destroyed, due to targeting limitations.
Violations result in MarDivs and AssaultRons taking over, and
"Re-adjusting" the local government. Pirates also provide a naval reserve
(see Hard Times), as they can be pulled in to naval service. Small, yes.
Noticeable? not really. Economic damage? Limited.

I envision the standard pirate matching up to a merchant, and saying "Gimme
your cargo and then GO AWAY! If you resist, we\'ll attack, if you cooperate,
all non-involveds get to move along, no hassles. Otherwise.... Charlie,
what\'s the status on the fusion barbette? Is it locked on yet? Well
Beowulf, what ya say?" Probably take the cargo, any weapons (or at least
key but inexpensive components for mounts), any mercs inbound to the
blockaded world, and any local military personell, then jump back to sell
the cargo and refuel. If most pirates don\'t "Prize out" the target vessel,
then most merchants are gonna simply back off til the war ends, and the
rest are running it for the increased value of a blockaded market.

If a war goes on too long (IMTU, 13 months), the navy will intervene. If
it\'s declared, but only limited privateering, it may be ignored. If major
civilian casualties occur, or neutrals are sacked, or CBR is invloved,
Imperial retribution is FAST, massive, and TOTAL. Remeber: all Imperial
Marine used MBT\'s lack the ability to do limited damage; RPY\'s are
unsubtle, and in a planetary well, are comparable to ramparts in firepower.
WhenGrav Tanks come at you, streaming fusing death, and troops drop off
with them, a MarDiv can be frightening... especially with a CruRon for
Ortillery. Not as effective as <author is ducking behind cover> 0.6C
asteroids, but far more intimidating. When intervention occurs, troops
surrender or die.

Piorates who lack a convinient conflict will alternate between Mechantile,
Starmerc, and actual "Piracy of Convinience"; the claiming as prize any
ship you happen to help, usually by the expedient of having a buddy jump
him, you "Render assistance", preferably after the poor schmoe is streaming
atmosphere, take everyone aboard your craft (in a guarded bay), and drop a
prize crew aboard... they rendevouz with your buddy, who helps repair, you
take it to a convinient world, and sell it at auction as salvage.

BTW, IMTU, it IS required to at least acknowledge a Signal
GK/SOS/MAYDAY/PAN call. (For the un-initiated, Pan-Pan-Pan means "Help, I\'m
lost, gime a fix on where I am." (or as has occured more than once in my
campaigns, When & Where....)

And, in the "Real World (tm)", it is not uncommon for japanese and american
factory vessels (FV\'s) to exchange small arms fire over who gets the
trawler catches just beyond US territorial waters, and in the "Disputed
Zone" (as many local commercial fisherman call it; that area beyond the
internationally standard limit but within US claimed limit...). Once to
twice a year. Coast Guard actually sunk a japanese FV a few years back...
the Japanese mistook a cutter for a US FV, and opened fire... and the
warning shot hit the FV. No lives lost, and only 4 paragraphs in the local
paper.

One big difference between air traffic and space traffic is that if you
lose power, you keep right on moving. And that can be *quite*
dangerous. Consider the damage even a small ship can cause at speeds as
low as 20 km/sec. 100 tons (mass) at 21 km/sec is roughly equvalent to
a 5 kiloton nuke.

You *want* to keep track of where ships are. And I rather suspect that
traffic regulations will forbid any course that intercepts the planet
or any space habitats (except during the last bit of a landing or
docking manuever). They\'ll also be unhappy about any course that would
intercept such if you suddenly cut power. Due to the way orbits work,
this last class is a *lot* more restrictive.

And I repeat: I _assume_ that if there is a ship out there worth at least a
few million credits (and if it\'s a functioning starship capable of capturing
a merchant, then it is worth quite a few million credits), then simple greed
will make tmen willing to spend a lot of resources on tracking it down. It
really makes little difference whether it is 10 or 20 million credits that\'s
involved. Your counter-assumption that people _wouldn\'t_ be interested in
tracking down such a million-credit bonanza is a perfect example of the
kind of assumption that I find... implausible, to say the least.

But the difference isn\'t enough. The value of the pirate\'s ship alone
would provide an incentive to track him down. And as has been pointed out
before, by restricting himself to the cargo, the pirate either has to
make a _lot_ of captures to make a living or he has to intercept
especially valuable cargoes. Both alternatives entail problems that are
close to insoluble. (And that\'s more than just an opinion (though
admittedly less than a fact), because the difficulties were brought up
in the previous round of the discussion and not refuted).

You know, I\'ve just realize the fallacy in your claim that it is all a
matter of assumptions and that while we, your opponents, can\'t prove our
assumptions are correct, you can\'t prove that yours are either. It is this:
You don\'t have to prove that your assumptions definitely apply. Pirates are
part of the Traveller background, so if a set of assumptions that makes
piracy plausible exists, those assumptions must be considered to apply,
as long as they make sense. You (or any other pro-piracy proponent) just
have to present us with a set of assumptions that 1) are reasonable,
2) don\'t create more conflict with established Traveller canon than they
solve, and 3) makes regular piracy possible. If you can do that, you have
proven that regular piracy in the Traveller Universe is possible.

Well, not you specifically, but I have several times asked the pro-piracy

From what I have heard, piracy nowadays use small speedboats to close with
their prey.

No argument there! My argument is that conditions in deep space, where there
are no convenient bays to hide in, is a lot closer to the conditions on the
high seas in the 20th Century than to conditions at sea in any previous
century. But you\'re right in saying that 20th Century wet sailing is not a
perfect analogy for space travel. That\'s why I don\'t believe that 20th
Century piracy is any proof that piracy is possible in deep space.

Yes, but did it say how it got captured? Did a privately owned destroyer
intercept it on the high seas and put a shot across its bows, demanding
that it surrender?

Nevertheless, I have to back down a little. Several people responded
with examples of yachts that had been attacked by other yachts. That
certainly corresponds to what I asked for. It was poorly phrased. IMO
pirates as they are portrayed in Traveller are using the equivalent of
navy gunboats at the very least, not the equivalent of pleasure yachts.

So when was the last time you heard of an armed ship chasing down a
merchant ship and capturing it?

Well I\'m going to try to take a stab at this one. 
First Piracy in the Traveller can only occur in areas that supply the political
and economic reality to make it happen.

For a pirate to be successful he must have a port that he can go to sell his goods
as well as repair any battle damage without any questions asked. Another words he 
needs a secure base of operations. In games terms this likely to be government 0
with a 3 or lower law level  and a C or above startport. This place is likely to 
have several systems within say within 2-3 parsecs of this base. Even meeting these 
requirements does not mean its a pirate den, Just that the local authorities are less 
likely to ask questions and be able to provide the repair, maintance and market for 
a pirates ill gotten goods.
Actually in the Spinward Marches only about 4 or 5 worlds even provide a likely haven for
would be long term pirates: Thanber, Tremous Dex,Trexalon,and Debarre.

As to ship types for Pirates,  to avoid undo attention, they most likely be armed merchant
craft, although it was mention once in A CT book that a Express Boat tender was used by 
pirates because of it 600 ton internal docking bay, that they used to swallow a ship. I myself 
remain a bit dubious of these since only unarmed vessels or disabled could be captured in this
way.

The last assumption one has to make is that one a few pirates operate any region, say one or two.
Any more than that, and the authorities would find it more than worth thier while to expend massive
amounts of energy to hunt down pirate that have disrupted the local trade too much and caused
merchants to avoid the area.


I for one believe that piracy is possible, but not any massive scale. (except maybe in Vargr space)
and certain not with anything that looks like an imperial warship.

[skip to the "Conclusion" at bottom if you do not care about my thought
processes.]

First, "Range Bands" *used to* refer to *geometrically increasing* range
bands, not units of measure which are consistent; So if you opened the
range by one band your ship moved from the 10,000km range "band" to the
100,000km range band (for example).  This termminology was used with the CT
"conceptual" combat system, where there was no physical manuvering (like on
a board, as in BL), only increasing or decreasing ranges.

I assume here we are using "range bands" to refer to a fixed distance, and
so are actually using them like "hexes" on a map-board.  They can still be
used like the CT conceptual combat system, but with fixed increments.

When we have used a vector based movement system, 1G allowed a change in
vector equivalent to altering the velocity of a ship one hex per turn in a
given direction.  With this system (which is the best compromise between
reality and game play I have seen), one hex needs to be the distance
travelled in one game turn at 1G.

So hex size (if that\'s what we\'re talking about) is, In my opinion, based
on the length of a combat turn.

20 minutes is an oft used duration;

10 m/s/s for 20 minutes (1200 sec)

d=1/2 at^2
(d=distance in meters, a = accelleration in meters/sec, t=time in sec)

(last time I tried to do this I got a lot of corrections; I hope you\'re all
checking this one too!)

d=1/2 * 10 * 1200^2

d=7.2 million meters = 7200 km.

Strange, I thought we were using 30,000km hexes...Let\'s try 1/2 hour and 1
hour rounds;

1/2 hour; d=1/2 * 10 * 1800^2

d=16,200 km

1 hour; d=1/2 * 10 * 3600^2

d=64,800 km

So where did my 30,000 km hexes come from?

using 50,000km hexes and solving for time (t);

50,000,000=1/2 * 10 * t^2 so;

50,000,000/(1/2)/10=t^2

10,000,000=t^2

Sqrt(10000000)=t

t=3,162 sec = ~53 minutes

Anyway, 50,000km \'bands\' works out to about 50 minute combat turns, if the
vector based movement system is used.  I would encourage using this system,
but that might fit better with either 16,000km range bands or 65,000 km
range bands (and corresponding length combat turns) rather than 50,000km
range bands.

Of course, it\'s pretty moot.  The system I was using worked just fine with
us believing we could move 30,000km in one combat turn, and weapons had
ranges in hexes anyway.  As long as the system is internally consistent.
Still, as a "hard" sci-fi game the travel time of a ship in combat is
important.

One could even argue for 1 hour combat turns with 50,000km range bands by
rationalizing that a starship is always evading, spinning to bring
batteries to bear, plenty of off-axis movement to burn that other 7 minutes
or so.

Conclusion; 50,000 km bands or hexes work for me, but only if they are
accompanied by 1 hour combat turns.

The problem with this house rule is microjumps. It is an established
military tactic to try and fool the enemy by doing a Jump-1 and going
somewhere else in the system (or in other words, on a long curve back to
where you started). 

If these have to be within 100 diameters they will be a bit predictable.
The whole nature of system defence and space combat would be changed.

An alternate scenario: Pirates have taken over a base intended for
long-term support of system SDB in the event of a major war.  This
base will provide them the majority of the supplies they need to keep
a ship running while they raid.  This is a very lucky find on their
part, and they can fill up the cargo holds with loot, and only take
the best of the lot when it\'s time to leave the area...

Yeah, this makes a lot more sense--a skilled operator is making
better use of _something_ rather than suggesting that a skilled user
can make something out of _nothing_.

Of course I\'m a heretic in the other direction :-)

This is interesting to me.  Does this mean that a person (maybe a person
who is "legally challenged") sit along the direct route from one busy port
to another and force ships out of jumpspace.

Now, I know space is big, and a ship would need to be very lucky to be
within a few hundred meters of where a ship in jump is passing by, but
perhaps there are ways of maximizing the chances of interception;  very
busy ports, for one.

I was also thinking that gravitic technology should be able to produce a
device that causes a big "gravity focus" which could, conveivably, serve
the same purpose.

Then there\'s the idea of strapping a manuver drove to a relatively large
object (asteroid or cometary body) and pushing it into the starlanes (time
consuming, but possible with reactionless thrust).

All relatively unusual, but good adventure possibilities.

I am curious where in the rules it states that a misjump, or regular jump
for that matter, has to terminate near some sort of massive object.

I always thought it was a d6 for direction, a d6 for the amount of dice,
and then the amount generated by those dice for distance.

NASA Announces Virtual Astrobiology Institute

Researchers from 11 universities and institutions will form the core of a new
"virtual institution" dedicated to study of the emerging field of astrobiology,
NASA announced Tuesday, May 19.

The Astrobiology Institute will bring together scientists from a wide range of
disciplines -- from geology and  astronomy to chemistry and biology -- to
study the formation of life in our solar system and the universe, a key
component of NASA\'s Origins Program.

"These initial members of NASA\'s Astrobiology Institute will be at the
forefront of the increasingly important link between astronomy and biology,"
said NASA administrator Dan Goldin.

Research conducted at this institute will range from the chemical and
biological issues regarding the formation of life to the formation and
characteristics of habitable worlds around other stars.

BTW, the Web sites for this relatively new scientific field are:

http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/ and
http://www2.astrobiology.com/astro/

Although the first (NASA\'s) is still heavily under construction, the
second
one actually has some "meat" to it.

[I\'ve always liked the idea of a "Hornblower-esque" Imperial Navy]

something confuses me a bit about this; isn\'t it the duty of the Imperial
Navy to protect merchant shipping?

I guess it depends on how things work in your traveller Universe, but I
would expect all those Navy owned destroyer escorts and close escorts to be
escorting merchants already, or hanging out at jump point in prime
territory.  Of course the navy is also patrolling the borders, conducting
exercises, refitting, training, shore-leaving, etc, etc, and is not always
available at the request of a merchant captain travelling in uncertain
areas in troubled times.

I certainly wouldn\'t expect it to be for sale.  At least not above the table.

	As we had everything some time ago - my argument :

	In a stable and secure area piracy is IMPOSSIBLE.  Most
	fortunate every mainstream traveller setting published,
	was a frontier condition. The only execption is perhaps
	the TNE-Regency. If pirates are operating on a frontier
	its easy to sell ship\'s on the other side. The sword world
	had been known as a pirate heaven in CT, the Wilds had
	been known to host more pirates than traders in MT. Virus
	and TED\'s often act as pirates in TNE, and the 3I had
	only a size of half a subsector in T4.

	So piracy is impossible, exept in those circumstances where
	roleplaying makes fun. Even if piracy is impossible in 99%
	of the 3I. Traveller picked the 1% of spacetime where it
	was possible, or even likely to encounter a pirate. And where
	is was easyer to make a living as a pirate, than as a trader.
	Perhaps this is related to the Burgess lesson :

	" The good is only good if the bad is possible. "

Ah, but so much more evil if you do it the other way around - they might

This sounds a lot like the Imperial "Interdictor" class starships from Star
Wars.  They generate a huge gravity well that drags ships out of hyperspace,
and prevents ships from entering hyperspace.

Not knowing FFS very well, would it be possible to design such a vessel in
Traveller?  Even a very small field could be enough to prevent a nearby ship
from escaping via jump.

Well, the question of regulated places to jump in and out system have
been discussed to death and I won\'t touch that.  One thing that was
not discussed in the last system is that, if an orbital world
is moving at 30 km/sec, coming out of jump a day early or late
can leave you further out from the world than intended, so you
also have to consider time variations.  This will be greater
if the stars at each end of the trip have a significant 
relative velocity....

Actually I was pondering the same thing earlier...If you throw out a "Gravity
Net" in line with a common trade route, the ship would pass into this artificial
100 diameter limit and precipitate out of jumpspace far enough away from
planetary defenses that pirates could seize it. The "Gravity Net" could also
slow down the ship, making for easier pickings.

According to the MT Referee\'s Companion, at TL21 you get the Jump Projector
and Jump Damper.  the first forces a ship into misjump by forming a jump
field around it.  The second comes in two flavors.  First is a defensive
screen to guard against a JP, the second a weapon to prevent ships from
jumping out.

It should be noted the j-drive is pretty passe by TL21, having been
replaced by starship sized portals for unlimited-range jumps.

Well, I\'m not sure how often Traveller ships simply loose power.  In my
campaign this is very rare.  In any case,  sensor range is ample for 
detecting such ships (and ships that loose power far our are actually going
to be likely to miss theplanet) or you could simply have ships check in every
hour (though a lot of this might easily be like prohibiting jets from flying
over populated areas in cast they suddenly fall out of the sky, sure it
happens, but the odds are just so low that it isn\'t worth a lot of bother).
(I don\'t know, additionally, how much a ship will decelerate in
rentry, they are lighter than asteroids).

Well, I don\'t see it as that likely a problem and I don\'t see the need
to track ships all the time to stop it.

"Pirates operating in Somalia waters have not hesitated to blast ships with

	-Excerpted from a 1996 story in The Wood Report

The above is quoted from the following link.

http://www.vantage-security.com/piracya.htm

It\'s the main page for Vantage Security\'s modern-day piracy section, listing
a dozen or so pirate attacks 1997-1998

As the company seems to want to sell security (as well as, among other
things "Foreign Military Assistance") I didn\'t feel like taking them at
their word, so I searched on.

Another site (that links to Vantage) is:

http://paladin-san-francisco.com/index.htm

which also seems to want to sell secure travel. Still, they probably don\'t
lie *too* outrageously. ;-)

For a more reputable (? ;-) source one can also take a look at Time
Magazine:

http://bubblemouth.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/1997/int/970818/high_seas.a_
plague_of_p.html

Or for an even more reputable source, consider looking to the World Maritime
News.

http://www.chamber-of-shipping.com/worldnews/news47b.html

This most recent issue lists an attempted pirate attack hospitalizing two
crewmembers of the Yin Chuan (15474-dwt) at Mombasa, Kenya.

A few quick web-searches turned up these and a few dozen more hits...

So, yes, IMTU, piracy exists.

Actualy, it isn\'t a fallacy.  It is a logical extension of the
fact that I claim that you can\'t prove piracy is, or isn\'t,
possible.  It rests on too many assumptions.  You, on the
other hand, seek to prove that your way of looking at the
problem is the only possible way.  That is a _much_ harder
thing to do.  

If all you were to do is claim that one can set up a
Traveller universe where piracy is impossible my only
response is a) I don\'t think any prediction can ever
really know if anything impossible unless you actually
get to that situation, so I would suggest that is should
be "near impossible" or "apparently impossible" and b)
I would not that that the assumptions involved almost
always paint a picture of an Imperium that is much
more highly regulated and involved in day to day affairs
of it\'s citizens than I see it as being.

Spending 20 million credits to have some chance of getting
3 million credits is loosing proposition.  Now we would
argue about the how much the Imperium would need to spend
to have a certain probabilility of catching pirates, and
how many there would be to catch, etc.  We could even
rebeat the "are military ships free for piracy prevention"
thread to death again.  However, it would come down to
the answer depending on the same sort of assumptions
we have already argued over before.

And I find the idea that someone will never consider the
costs to make sure they aren\'t more than the return to
be implausible.

I will state that I also think that piracy would not exist
at any level high than general irritant to society at large
(though it would more irritating to those individuals that
suffer from it :-).  If it got the point where it was, for
example, disrupting general trade, the Imperium would
definately be motivated to start exercising those resources
that others are so quick throw around.

I totally forgot about those!  Both of these technologies seem to operate on
advanced jump theory.  Would it be possible, at lower tech levels, to use
already understood gravitic technology to create a giant (albeit relatively
weak) gravity field, which could then be used to take advantage of said
field\'s effect on jump drives?  Instead of projecting or dampening jump
fields, you simply use gravity to prevent/abort jumps.  Not quite as
effective as directly manipulating j-space fields, but it would work.

So, my question is, is it possible to create such a gizmo using FFS?

IIRC in the designer\'s notes for Brilliant Lances it was explained that
they used 30,000 hexes because they matched 30 minutes of movement after
spending 1 G-turn of acceleration. This means it matches when you consider
movement at the volocity you get after accelerating, not the distance you
get while accelerating, which is half as much.

d = v * t
v = a * t

for 1 G-turn:

v = 10 * 1,800
  = 18000 m/s

d = 18,000 * 1,800
  = 32,400,000 m
  = 32,400 km

So 30,000 km per hex is about right for 30 minutes, 25,000 km is about
right for 25 minutes, and 50,000 km is about right for 45 minutes. Looking
at things the other way 20 minutes gives about 15,000 km and 60 minutes
gives 130,000 km.

If you wanted to be ultra realistic you\'d half the size of all the hexes
and have each g of acceleration move the ship 1 hex in the round it
happens, and 2 in the succeeding rounds.

Actually I thought that was one of the most interesting aspects of the
Elowan. As for their plantlike status, I was thinking that perhaps they,
the Veloxi and the Thrynn were actually experiments of the Ancients.

I loved Star Control dearly and considered races from there as well. In the
campaign setting I\'m designing there are actually six races in the
subsector: the Humans, the Thrynn, the Veloxi, the Elowan, the Shofixti and
the Androids (based on the Mrrmrhhm). I was also planning on bringing in my
personal favorite, the Ariloulaleelay.

Actually, I would find this an interesting alternative to the Virus as the
reason for the dark times. Imagine if the Imperium was in the middle of a
civil war when suddenly two incredibly powerful races appear, one from
coreward one from spinward. The Kohr-ah destroy any sentient they come
across as they sweep towards the middle of known space while the Kzer-za
enslave any sentient they come across in a similar journey.

IMTU, a ship is not going to produce a very large disturbance in the
gravity field; how big is 100 diameters, and how will you be able to position
yourself accurately on the line between systems? Neither will you be able
to create much of a greater disturbance via TL16- gravitic technology.
Perhaps the TL21 stuff is advanced gravitics? Really advanced...

If YTU uses gravitic focusing for lasers, you can use them to create a web
through which the target ship must pass on the way to a planet.  Since there
really isn\'t an accurate way of locking onto a planet from another system, I
figure that you lock onto the star and then do further calculations once you get
in-system.  To catch incoming vessels in the net, you\'d have to set it up at the
outer edge of the system, in line between the two stars.  To catch outgoing
ships, you\'d have to be relatively close the the departure planet, in line
between the destination star and the departure planet.  The 100 diameters will
form a cone of travel between departure planet and destination star.  You then
set up your web inside the cone at a "safe" distance.  In either case, the
intense gravity within the gravitic focused beam will shear any jump bubble that
passes through it. That should precipitate the ship out of J-space... or cause a
misjump.  In any case, by adjusting the distance between the strands, you can
seive out the smaller ships (like scouts sent out for SAR) while catching the
super freighters.

So, to figure out how big the net is, there\'s several factors that need to be
addressed.
1. How strong is the gravity created by a gravitic focussed laser?
2. How fast does it drop off?
3. What is the second smallest dimension of the ship you\'re trying to catch?
4. How far away is the destination star?
5. How large is the departure planet?
6. What is a "safe" distance?

I think that these calculations will produce an aweful lot of lasers to get the
desired effect. However, if you can narrow the options for a departing ship, you
can get by with a smaller web.  For example, if your buddy the pirate, chases the
merchant into a specific vector and then spooks him into jumping from 10
diameters, your web can be 1% of the calculated size.  Since it takes a while to
do your jump calculations, they\'ll be stuck for a good hour or more in realspace
while the main pirate force attacks.

   The problem with pushing a large object into a starlane is that the starlane 
is constantly accelerating, as the begin and end-points of the starlane 
orbit their respective stars.  That asteroid you are using would have to be 
under constant acceleration to remain on station, at perhaps too high an 
acceleration to be practical.

   If you do manage to precipitate ships out of jump, you want to do it near 
the destination of the jump, rather than the beginning (assuming you are a 
p-p-p.., p-p-p-i-r-r..., oh hell, Adventurer).  Otherwise, you float around 
twiddling your thumbs waiting a week for the ship to emerge from jump-space.

   The star-type is a letter designation indicating the surface temperature of 
the star, and, as a consequence, the colour.  The luminosity is the total 
energy output of the star.  If you plot the luminosity vs temperature, you get 
the H-R diagram Joe mentioned.

   Most stars are on the main sequence (size V), where the mass of the star is 
it\'s defining chracteristic.  The more massive it is, the brighter and hotter 
it is, and the faster it burns itself out.

   In the Traveller rules, the luminosity is used to determine what orbit(s) 
are in the habitable-planet zone.  There are no rules that use the colour; it\'s 
just used as, well, colour. :) The diameter is used to determine where it\'s 
safe to use a jump drive (which often extends out past the mainworld\'s own 
100-diameter limit).  And the mass (and planet\'s orbit) will tell you the 
planet\'s year length.

   If you are going for more realism, the vast majority of human-habitable
planets will be circling main sequence stars F, G, K, and some M.  Above F,
the stars put out too much ultraviolet, and they may not have been around long
enough for life to develop on thier planets (native life or terraforming is
required for a oxygen atmosphere).  Many M-stars will be too dim to have a
useful habitable zone.  The supergiants have the problem of ultraviolet and
short life-spans (magnitudes worse), and the habitable zone of a red giant has 
moved outwards as the star has expanded and increased in luminosity. 
Pre-existing habitable worlds become toasted, and the planets moving into the 
habitable zone have little time to develop a breathable atmosphere.

It depends on what you call a merchant vessel. Illegal fishing fleets are
detained all the time by armed vessels.  The top end of Australia gets about
1 per week at times and there have been a few ships detained in the southern
oceans over the last six months as well.  All for illegal fishing, but
they\'re merchants too =)

I just wanted to add a little pet project I had.  There\'s an awful lot of those M
class binary systems which, in theory, wouldn\'t be very suitable.  Now, lets say
you manage to generate a HUGE gravitational field that would draw the two stars
together. There\'s a theory that if you can crash two stars into each other such
that the close speed is less than their rotational speed, they\'ll just sorta merge
and form a single star with the combined mass. You\'d need to pull off the angular
momentum some how, but that\'s what inner system planets are for :-)

Anyway, combining a couple of suitable M-V stars could generate a nice K class with
a reasonable habitable zone.

It probably isn\'t feasible in a vanilla Traveller universe, but I was in a game
where hyperspace magnified gravity greatly, and that\'s where I came up with the
ploy.

Good for you, but *IMTU*, tactical movement will use 30Kkm hexes/bands.

I use Stutterwarp drives and 1 minute ship combat turns.  Movement of 5 to
15 hexes per minute are the norm, depending on tech level and ship type,
and everything works out nicely.  Each hex/turn is another 500km/s of
pseudo-velocity. 

As I\'ve been saying all along my comments relate to MTU, but it *would* be

David, mate, others of us think a similar process will happen with baby
naval bases (a PEMS, a LIDAR, a dozen t-plate missiles and half a dozen
fighters), that will suppress the incidence of ethically-challenged
civilians attacking other civilian shipping, thus reducing the inherent
risk of interstellar trade.

Yes. My feeling is that using drop tanks should increase the probability of
misjump by 2%. This way the Navy gets to go "OK. So we will take 2% misjump
including 1% outright casualties in our deep-penetration cruiser squadrons,
when we drop tank out and internal fuel back for a raid", but the Merchant
corporation accountant goes "Using external tanks on our freighters will
result in a fatal misjump on average every 100 jumps, or 1200 days given 48
hour turnaround. This will reduce the effective operating life of our
capital investment by approximatly 90%, leading to a sharply increased
required internal rate of return, and a sharp reduction in expected traffic
in non-replacable items, including persons. Increased crew turnover is also
expected as those individuals fail to seek re-employment unless internal
redeployment to less risky operational health and safety environments is
arranged".

Ditzie\'s still asleep, so I\'m going to answer this.

It\'s interesting looking at this and the Tracey class. Again, it\'s
overpowered for jump-1 - I\'d think about taking the power plant down to
about 65 megawatts, perhaps with a little boost capability from 1 hour
batteries, just in case you need to power the CG and the thrusters, or the
thrusters and the laser, or whatever. Again, the AEMS is a spare wheel -
I\'d have an AEMS/Lidar as part of an upgraded weaponary package, not a
standard option (1 megacredit of sticker cost is 4 kilocredits per monthly
payment, or the revenue from 4 dtons of cargo). You might even lose some of
the CG as well - my numbers show it being 100 m3 or so, and with a flat gee
from the thruster plates you might be better off with 30 m3 of CG and an
extra 5 dtons of revenue earning capacity.

If you take the power down to 64 MW and lose the AEMS, you get a sticker
price of MCr3 less. Lose 70% of the CG and install a dton of cargo space
for 21 megawatts of power from batteries for one hour (or use TAKAFP for
67.2 extra megawatts indefinitly) and the cargo bay goes up to 94 dtons,
and you can still do 1.3 gees with a full load (enough to get off most
anywhere).

Note that the economics rules are broken for small staterooms vis a vis
cargo and low berths - a mid passenger in a small stateroom creates net KCr
6 revenue from 2 dtons, as compared to net KCr 2 from freight or net KCr
1.8 from low berths. Allowing 2 middle passengers or a high passenger in a
small stateroom makes the differential even worse.

light-minutes (54million klicks, or about half an AU), propagated at 
lightspeed of course.  Kinda simular to Cherenkov radiation, which is the blue 
light reputedly the \'our-space\' track of a FTL particle.

  I wasn\'t aware of a faction for legalizing piracy. The pro-piracy
faction (of which I happen to be one on certain topics) typically
ignored analyses of the (canonical) 3I\'s capabilities. It\'s difficult
to meaningfully discuss uses if one side is unwilling to accept that
1 + 1 = 2 (stand-ins for established budgetary considerations :> ).

  As stated previously, the issue is relative to their capability,
not _up to_ their capability, which is absurd, unless you count
the achievements of the Khmer Rouge.

  The US most certainly is not highly regulated, although I realize
that various political or ideological viewpoints view it differently.
Less-regulated societies in the modern era simply lack the resources
(in almost all cases) to govern effectively, be it Somalia or Peru.

  As for laissez-faire, the 18th C. UK, supposed champion of said
doctrine, never took much of a hands-off approach to matters of either
internal or external security; certainly their internal order issues
were either exceedingly well-handled or simply fortunately limited.

  Luckily I don\'t have to prove too much, as I\'ve purchased some
wonderful little books that happen to cover the Traveller universe
and the Imperium in particular in some detail. OTOH, if I had to
guesstimate the range of possibilities for certain technologies
and given historical occurrences, I could try and assess the relative
likelihood (or improbability) of various outcomes. Personally I
wouldn\'t care to do so, but I understand that game developers often
have to resort to such improvisations.

  Why would the answer have any validity to the authorities? 
Is there a verification method? Remember, transponders are
potentially security aids as well as navigational devices,
and by dropping one you are perhaps coincidentally heaving
the other.

  OK. That\'s a judgement call, and I\'d be prepared to agree if
regulation of ships manifests prevented simply enslaving and/or
kidnapping passengers; this is the unaddressed slavery bit again.

  Funny, I recently tossed off an off-hand comment (TML?) that
controlling nukes at the source would be a real bitch in the 3I
given the number of TL 6+ worlds (let alone Seekers with the needed
kit). I suppose all related equipment would need to be controlled
too. Also the permeability of the border needs to be considered.

  I can see the latter. The former sounds like a disagreement over
degree, not existence. Who performs these patrols?

  Possibly me, which is why I\'m trying to work this out.

  If you could find the opportunity to formulate your own view

prior to this original post) then perhaps we could resume the
comparison of fleet intruder / raider operations against both
conventional Traveller shipping and the hypothetical Jump-tanker
model.

  "In an area with no trade, no trading ships will be converted".
If that\'s not a tautology (def\'n: "needless repetition of an idea

  I\'ll save you the dictionary definition of "arbitrary", but it\'s
close enough. So, the nature of politics in the Imperium is such that
the Imperium, which seems to exist solely to wage war (as the occasion
presents) IYTU, can effectively confiscate the profits from a huge
investment by the mega-corps in a more efficient technology? Even if
true, wouldn\'t that be a very serious barrier to investment?

  _If the savings are greater_ _and the risk is demonstrably low_
_relative to the investment_. I suspect that most economists or
CA\'s would agree with that; therefore, wouldn\'t implementation
be quite radically drawn out?

  You\'ve repeatedly stated that you don\'t believe that the Imperium
_will_ maintain serious (IMO) internal security. IIRC, you may have
stated during the Navy budget debat that it wasn\'t possible either.
Do you have a definitive opinion or analysis?

  So is it a given that ships built to address external threats
are unusable for internal security missions? Are there no linkages
or correlations between these missions? Are designated internal
security vessels unusable for external (or internal wartime) tasks?

  Given the absolute revenues and the number of designated taskings
within the Imperiums purview there will very likely be money left
over for internal security or the Navy. It may of course prove to be
desirable to reconsider theoretical Imperial Navy deployments at length.

  They\'ll have to land then, as any realistic combat model using

  I agree about the Rebellion, but if sufficient patrols (probably
including some of the small SDB\'s) are maintained in peacetime to
watch for enemy intelligence ships, or infiltration leading up to
an attack, then how can these patrols not serve any anti-piracy
function beyond the ~100 diameter limits (which latter would only
need a handful of dedicated vessels, and then only when local
resources are inadequate to supply the protection level desired)?

  You might try two novels by Mick Farren: "Protectorate" and "Their
Masters\' War". In the first a near-extinct humanity is freed from their
alien overlords by an underclass messiah with inhuman powers.

  In the latter humans have been removed from Earth by the telepath
galaxy conquerors behind the puppet messiah, and serve as battle
cattle for their masters eternal war against the other great race
of the galaxy. The humans are literally "farmed" from barbaric
colonies seeded throughout the rear areas of their masters space.

  I recommend them, FWIW.

  What if they just flamed each other with comm-masers? :) Seriously,
I think patrolling would be more economical for most of the more
marginal worlds. It would be interesting if the taxation carriage of
individual worlds (at least a range) could be determined to see if
most smaller worlds could cover defenses out of their own customs and
excise income or whether upper tiers of fleet commands would have to
cover the force liability (with mobile assets?).

  What about reduced pension liabilities? You also save on maintenance,
and the tax write-off should be enormous. OC, insurance is Right Out.
It still might be do-able with J-6 liners, especially if you found a

The problem isn\'t he math (even when it is more complex than
that :-).  It\'s the assumptions that lead one to come up
with 1+1 instead of 1+2 or 2+2....

We could argue about how regulated the US is today.  I feel
that it isn\'t as unregulated as many societies historically
(even relative to the degree it could be), or even
as it has been in the past.  I also see the Imperium as
being much less regulated than that US.  (Because of
slow communictations, large size, decentralized government,
feudal structure, etc)

>Less-regulated societies in the modern era simply lack the resources
>(in almost all cases) to govern effectively, be it Somalia or Peru.

This I don\'t agree with.  I also feel that even if it was true
that would only speak to general modern regulation which would
still contrast with many other historical societies.

Well, I am playing loose with the term "laissez-faire".  It
is technically an economic term which I am misapplying.  Nor
do I think that anything I said says that the Imperium is
ignoring it\'s internal or extrnal security.  Piracy at the
level of minor irritant is not a threat to security.

Unless you have some system of cross checking codes (which would
be hard with communications as hard as they are, as another poster
did a good job of elucidating), they aren\'t much more reliable
than the explinations of the ships captain.  If he can lie he
can alter the transponder.

Please thank Dizzie for her wonderful comments. Unfortunatly though a meson 
gun would be neat, the design is ment to be an old IW Terran ship and they 
didn\'t have them back then. However I\'ve redesigned the ship in light of her 
comments. I kept the armarment the same (but dumped the AEMS) since I 
can\'t seem to get the design to do anything better with a laser and I dont want 
to add in missiles, I\'ve dumped the CG and reduced the powerplant 
accordingly. Since its ment to be refuelled at annual maintaince (I\'d imagine 
you don\'t just go out buy a couple of enriched plutonium rods from a local store 
and slot them in), I\'ve added in a bit of a safety margin in the fission fuel. I\'ve 
added in some toilets (what the crew and passengers can\'t just cross their legs 
for six months). I reduced the tech level of the grav compensation to TL 10 to 
reflect the poor standard of Terrran gravitic technology.

One of the most enduring designs to come out of the Interstellar Wars, the
Tracy class were a general purpose tramp freighter serving the many colonies
of the Terran Confederation. The design outlasted the Confederation by a
considerable margin, examples of the class were being constructed in the
Solomani Rim well into the Long Night. The class contains most of the
features that distingushed Terran merchant ships of this period. The most
noticable is the single large cargo dual story cargo bay with its massive
12m x 5m cargo ramp. Other features common to most Terran merchants 
were: the single 2 ton turret mounting a triple 14.5Mj laser (this was the most 
common armarment used on Terran merchants during the Interstellar Wars). 
The closed loop extended life support system, giving the ship unlimited duration
excluding food. The use of a small fission reactor instead of the large fusion 
reactors found in Vilani designs.

If the RAN vessels werent enforcing rights recognised under international
law, this is what I\'d call \'state-sponsored piracy\'. The ships have
friendly bases, somewhere they can sell off the captured ships etc. Doing
state-sponsored piracy is historically a good way to get into wars with
your neighbours.

The pirates that are operating these days in the South China Sea, the Horn
of Africa, Straits of Malacca etc are what I would call \'seaborne mugging\'.
Their target seems not to be the cargo or the ship, but the cash, valuables
and sometimes crew (kidnap for ransom or rape appears to have happened).

Now, if Traveller merchant captains tend to carry large amounts of cash, it
might be viable to use the Traveller equivalent of a speedboat (a small 4G
launch) to match vectors with an unarmed merchant and board. The problem is
that at TL12, your minimum cost is about MCr 2.5 for the t-plates - at TL13
you can use a 1m3 fusion plant and Heplar, so you might be able to shave
that some. It\'s only at TL14 and up that really cheap spaceships become
viable.

Now, how interested in such a system of spaceborne muggings would the Navy
etc be, as long as trade isnt effected ... I\'m not sure. But I do know how
tempting it would be to steal the ship once you got aboard, and hope that
you could make it to a freeport.

At a high enough speed, the hydrogen atom acts like a beta particle and
a free proton flying in "close association". That\'s because the impact
energy is far higher than the energy required to seperate the proton
and electron.

No "reputedly" about it. But it\'s a bit more complicated. Cernkov
radiation is emitted by a particle moving faster than the speed of
light IN THE MEDIUM. You see, the higher the index of refraction, the
*lower* the speed of light. For example, diamond has an index of
refraction of 2.42, which means that the speed of light in diamond is
c/2.42. So any particle moving faster than c/2.42 in diamond will emit
Cerenkov radiation.

It\'s observed all the time in reactors, as they frequently generate
particles moving faster than the speed of light in the cooling water. 

Oh yeah, the energy in the Cerenkov radiation comes from the particle\'s
kinetic energy, so emitting Cerenkov radiation slows the particle. 

Thus, we can assume that ships *don\'t* emit Cerenkov radiation *and
*aren\'t* in "normal space" while FTL.

I\'d disagree with that assumption.

I believe that in the RW the principal mathod to prevent 
people making nuclear weapons in their high school physics 
lab is by preventing access to the raw materials, principly 
the refined uranium or plutonium. Once we have access to 
the ores of the average system (just go somewhere with an 
asteroid belt) then getting the raw materials isn\'t hard. 
I\'ve not sufficient tech knowledge to tell how difficult it 
is to refine into useable material, but if it\'s mostly a 
matter of energy requirements the average Seeker has enough 
spare power to run a small city. 

With a decent Computer operated system, and a good 
chemistry lab, I can\'t think of a good reason to stop 
someone from a tech 10+ society from building their 
own Nuke from raw materials. Perhaps not as neat and 
precise as a professionally built one, but sufficient to be 
worrying.

Sigh. Yet again I see that I\'ve been too vague. I apologize. While I\'m
perfectly willing to accept fishing ships as examples of merchant vessels,
I meant "privately owned gunboat" rather than "national warship" when I
wrote "armed ship". So Australian navy gunboats catching illegal fishermen
don\'t count for my purpose. The Somali pirates someone else mentioned
seems a lot more likely to qualify. If those Somali pirates actually used
real gunboats, then I will have to back down on that part of my claim.

Are you talking about real privateers (privately owned warships whose only
expense to the government issueing the letter of marque is a bit of paper)
or starmercs (private ships hired for the duration with full logistic
support (including repairs) supplied by the government that hires them)?
Because if you mean the latter, we\'ve been over that before. It has long
been admitted by us anti-piracy people that if somebody pays your expenses
and losses then private commerce raiding is feasible. What I still don\'t
believe is that privateering is a winning proposition except in very
exceptional circumstances.

Oh, and don\'t forget that we\'re talking about piracy _as portrayed in the
Traveller sources_.

There was story in the Boston Globe a couple of years ago of a fishing boat
from Gloucester (I think) crossing the line into Canadian territory (100
miles offshore) when a canadian submarine surfaced off it\'s bow and
arrested the whole lot, took the ship into port and impounded it.

Of course, if those Canucks have nothing better to do with their subs than
enforce fishing treaties, I\'d say we live in pretty peaceful times.

There seems to me to be a gap in logic here, perhaps Rupert or someone can
relieve these questions from my physics challenged mind (I was a Psych
major fer chrissakes);

Doesn\'t thirty minutes need to elapse while under constant 1G acceleration
to reach the velocity where 30k is covered in 30 minutes?

Isn\'t distance covered while accellerating?

So shouldn\'t the movement rate reflect this?

Inquiring minds want to know.

Its about all you can do with an O-boat these days.  While they\'re a very
nice sub, and awfully quiet, they are a little long in the tooth.  Our last
one gets decommed next month, I believe, leaving us with 4 new Collins boats,
none of which have their firecontrol software operating properly.

To keep this post on topic (almost), how many of you envision `space warfare\'
 to be rather like sub warfare, except whereas subs try to be silent,
spacecraft try to remain unseen and to keep their energy emissions low?  If
subs are the silent service, does this mean the Imperial Navy is the invisible
service? ;)

Standard physics textbooks will tell you that
(1) distance covered = 1/2 * acceleration * time^2

they will also tell you that
(2) distance covered = velocity * time
and that
(3) velocity = acceleration * time

Putting (3) into (2) will give you
(4) distance covered = acceleration * time * time = acceleration * time^2

Note the discrepancy between (4) and (1), the error stems from the wrong
assumtion that (2) can be used in situations when velocity changes.

For a vector movement gamesystem (4) should be used as the gamesystem is
actually a paper and pencil version of a numerical simulation sampled at
each gameturn. As the number of gameturns increases (4) approaches (1) as
it should:

Turns    (2)+(3)        (1)
============================
1       1               1/2
2       1+2=3           2
3       1+2+3=6         4.5
4       1+2+3+4=10      8
5       1+2+3+4+5=15    12.5
6       21              18
7       28              24.5
8       36              32

Thus if yoy plan to create a vector based game system with only ONE TURN
then use (1) but if you allow multiple gameturns you need to use (2) and
(3) instead. Handy formulae for calculating various parameters in space
combat are (replace 9.81 with 10 if you think FF&S2s acceleration fudge is
agreeable)

Hexscale(in meters) = 9.81 * turnlength^2(in seconds)
or
turnlength(in seconds = sqrt(Hexscale(in meters) / 9.81)

I\'ve answered this a couple of times now - perhaps it should be put on the FAQ?

There was a larry Niven stroy where this was pretty much the exact 
plot... ships have been disappearing and with the way that Niven works
his hyperdrives, this shouldn\'t be happening, piracy should be 
impossible - not to mention the fact that these very, VERY expensive 
ships haven\'t even turned up on the black market (or something
like that).

SPOILER WARNING!

It turns out that some smart guy has caught a quantum black hole and 
is using it\'s gravity well to cause ships to precipitate out of 
hyperspace unexpectedly. The cool part is that the ships fall out 
of hyperspace upon hitting a gravity well, but the hyperdrives don\'t.

Someone, anyone - what Niven story was that? It would make a pretty
decent adventure and could easily be fit into a "canon" universe.

I shure envisioned them that way. I had a neat 1000 km square scale space
combat system with non gravfocussed lasers and detection ranges on par with
shooting ranges. Then Bruce came along and set the record straight
regarding detection ranges which blew it to smithereens. Luckily my and
others calculations about when lasers would start to miss an evading ship
due to timelag came out to about the same ranges (100 000 km plus for
really cold, black ships) which fixed things again sort of.

Current thinking about quantum black holes is that there cannot be any as
they will evaporate more or less instantly through Hawking radiation. I
think there is a funny anecdote somewhere about Jerry Pournelle and Niven
racing to be the first to publish a story based on quantum black holes
where Niven beat JP but JP had the satisfaction of telling Niven after
publication that Quantum black holes wouldn\'t work.
(Time hasn\'t been kind to Niven now when it seems bussard Ramscoops won\'t
reach very high velocities due to drag. Bussard ships are a staple in
Nivens stories)

You\'re right, but you\'re missing a minor detail.  

Let\'s take the BEOWULF, at the start of turn one at rest relative to the
game board (speed zero). 

In turn one, it accelerates at two gees for the whole turn, changing its
speed from zero to two.  However, its average speed during the first turn
is only *one*, because it\'s building up speed continuously all turn.

In turn two, it doesn\'t accelerate.  Since its vector from the previous
turn is two, it moves *two* hexes this turn, and on all subsequent turns
until it accelerates again.

Let\'s say on turn five BEOWULF accelerates at two gees along the same
vector.  In turn five, she moves at speed three ( 2 from turn one + 1
from the average speed this turn ) and in turn six she moves at speed
four ( 2 from turn one + 2 from the final speed after turn five ).

Since this more realistic approach requires extra bookkeeping, the basic
rules usually assume all changes in velocity are applied instantly, not
over the course of the turn, to simplify matters.  Otherwise, you must
each turn:
  * apply the other half of last turn\'s acceleration vector (if any)
  * apply half of any new acceleration vector this turn
  * record the other half of new acceleration for application next turn

This can get a bit confusing for new players, especially when there are
course changes involved.

Nope, Meson Guns were one of the weapons that won the Terrans the Nth
Interstellar War. They are TL11 in any case - and as a Long Night retrofit,
they make perfect sense to me (great for intimidating helpless worlds with
no space defenses).

1 gee of grav comp is plenty for a freighter anyway. It still needs real
computers (CM 1.0 is no computer).

The lower sticker price and bigger cargo bay seems to have helped
profitibility - repayments look to be about KCr150 a month, and 100 dtons
of cargo should return around KCr180 a month. Any passenger revenue can
thus be dedicated to paying crew costs and life support, and saving up for
the fuel bill (by my numbers KCr600 a year ... better do some favours for
some mining colonies, and buy the stuff wholesale).

With armament, shouldnt a 100 MJ, 2m diameter laser have a range of 60
000km or so (about the range of your PEMS) be about 3.15m3 for the focusing
array. Chemical laser cartridges are 500kg apiece, or about 30 m3 of
accumulator plus power input of 500 MW over firing time - 25 m3 of
batteries will give you a shot every 20 seconds for an hour. Toss in a 1.6
m3 50kkm beam pointer and we have ourselves a civilian laser.

Now, thats about 60 m3 - call it 4 dtons. The laser, beam pointer and
accumulator fit in a 42m3 turret - I assume you can put batteries anywhere.
This weapon will have a DV of 25, as compared to about 10 for the 14.5 MJ
version. I interpret DV 25 to mean penetrating an AV of 25 ... which means
DV10 wont punch a spaceship hull, no matter how many pulses hit (blind the
sensors or disrupt the lanthanum grid, maybe).

Tell you what. I\'ll take a 100km patrol line of six Oberons backed up with
three Orions, and you see how many nuclear submarines get blown up crossing
it.

One problem with this is under FFS, ships are rather easily detected at
well outside weapons range. The reasoning came from Bruce Macintosh,
professional astronomer and all-around sensor guru, who pointed out that
space is dark and cold, and ships are bright and hot. Weapons start to
become ineffective at half a million km or so, as light lag takes hold, but
cheap sensors spot ships at millions of km.

Essentially, it gets to be like Age of Sail combat - ships either consent
to combat, or are trapped without fuel and forced to fight (the historical
analogy is trapped against a coastline eg Trafalger).

Distance covered = (median velocity) * time.  For a constantly accelerating
object, median velocity is V0 (initial velocity) + 1/2 acceleration*time, which
works out that distance = V0*T + AT^2.

For accurate vector movement with the standard turns and hexes, assume that
G-turn of acceleration adds 1 hex/turn to your vector, and that for your
position at the end of the turn only add _half_ the velocity from acceleration
to distance.  As this is likely to generate half-hexes of position, you might
want to halve the size of hexes (and thus generate a vector of 2/turn).

Finding 6 O-boats that are still combat ready will be somewhat difficult.  I
agree with you BTW, they\'re a good boat.  I think I\'ve said that already.

Haven\'t read FFS.  Play mostly MT and CT.  I would have thought that the
ships would have been shielded and there would have been found a way to
dissipate energy so that sensors would have a hard time picking it up. 
Unlikely (impossible?), given current physics, but then again so is FTL
travel, but it\'s a staple of Traveller and countless other SF text.

Plus I prefer reality to take a backseat to fun and playability. YMMV.

Me for one. If nothing else, it means there are a number of interesting sources
and gives me an excuse to watch all those old sub movies again.
Plus, the lightspeed lag for sensor returns means you have a similar set of
problems (and solutions) for tracking enemy starships as you do for finding
subs based on (say) airplane sightings.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Hubble Space Telescope has
captured the first actual image of a planet outside our own
solar system, NASA said Wednesday. 

The picture will be debuted at a press conference scheduled
for 1 p.m. EDT Thursday at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration headquarters in Washington. 

NASA says the image shows a planet that is 2-to-3 times the
mass of the Jupiter and is located near a newly-forming binary
star system. Such a systems consists of two stars very close
together and orbiting each other. 

NASA says the finding has to be further substantiated and
confirmed, but if it all holds up this will be the most important
discovery to date made by the Hubble Space Telescope.

ObTrav:  There\'s been a discussion on whether or ship crews 
can detect gas giants in an unexplored system. My take is
"yes" *if* they know what to look for (i.e. someone has the
Survey skill at least CT skill level 2 minimum.

What types of sensors would be necessary for this, though?

	this is similar in our campain. Our consense is that a jump
	explosion at 100 diameter can be seen even on a bright day. This
	gives the defender of a word a certain advantage, but a fleet
	that exits at 3000 diameter using the flash of each others jump
	explosion to accellerate unseen, and go silent soon after has a
	large advantage. This advantage is even increased by the light
	lag. To the time the defenders world know about the intruders,
	the fleet had time to collect sensors and moved.

	Back to the coordination of jump. High guard has a table for
	computers and sizes. Or formular is to add the displement of all
	vessels and multiply it with the square (not root!) of the
	number\'s of vessels. This gives the minimum computer size for
	the job. So a 1bis is able to cordinate 2 scouts, while a 6fib
	(TL:12) normaly sufficient for 100.000dt would allow to
	coordinate 10 vessels of around 1000 dt to jump.

	So perhaps the main reason for using an escord for a trade
	convoy is the better computer. Trader most times have the cheap
	1bis, which is ok for ship\'s below 600dt. An escord with a
	model/6 could make a large convoy possible, and the sheer number
	of armed vessels would distract pirates much more that the
	escord itself.

The reality is that there is going to be a fair amount of waste heat
to be radiated. A typical ship is going to be unusually bright in the IR
portion of the spectrum, under normal circumstances. A passive IR scan
should be able to spot ships without too much difficulty. Of course,
IYTU, the specific value of "too much" is rather up to you.

There are a lot of things which you can do to give you an advantage if you know
where the person trying to sense you is; being backlit by a star will swamp
your signature, requiring locating you by silhoutte -- which is generally going
to be impossible beyond a million kilometers or so (a ten meter lens has enough
resolution that in theory it could detect a thousand-ton craft at that range. 
In practice, it probably won\'t).

No Hans, you weren\'t too vague.  I posted a web page dedicated to modern

The problem is Hans, even when your confronted with overwhelming evidence

YOUR WRONG.  Go out on the web and do your own research, I\'ve done mine!

I will admit OPENLY that I agree with your statements when talking about a

On this topic, the horribly-delayed THUDDD 9 will *finally* get back under

Well, from where I sat, the point that is was pointless to
argue that trade was converted to a new system in areas where
trade was so massively disrupted wasn\'t being address.   It certainly
wasn\'t being repeation of a point made before (let along a "needless"
one).

However, I don\'t really remember the point well enough
to continue (and my intrest has wained anyway).  I\'ll
have to bow out after this.  Sorry.  I will finish
out the reply to this message.

Well, I never argued that they would "confiscate" _all_ their
profits.  I think it is quite reasonable they would tax them
(especially if those profits depend on the services that those
taxes provide).

I\'m sorry, I don\'t follow.  It seemed you were agreeing with
me that the savings just need to exceed risk and investment.
Then you threw in the is point about it being radically 
drawn out.  I don\'t see where it came from.

The point here is the "IMO".  What you consider "serious" I
consider unecessary.  I do agree that the Navy will have
maintain serious internal security, I just don\'t agree
with your view of what that is.

>  So is it a given that ships built to address external threats

I wouldt go that far.  But I wouldn\'t say they are free either.
There are some missions that could be done with small
decreases in readyness.  However, full time patrols of
all areas of the Imperium goes well beyond, IMO, this
point.

Why do people, when I say I don\'t agree with one extreme,
demand I defend the other extreme?   :-)

There is never "money left over" in large organizations.  If
one need doesn\'t get it, there is always something else that
wants it.  I do agree that the Navy will spend money on internal
security.  This program will have compete with all the other
needs that exist.

Well, in fact mesons can hit surface targets just as well as
orbital ones.  Also, don\'t planetary mesons have more
range than ship board?  However, in system where planetary
defenses are limited, they might use the surface to hide....

Well, I\'m not sure they _can_ detect every single intelligence
ships (many of which will just be merchant ships).  But these
patrols would be near the boarder and would only have to spot
and report, rather than intercept and defeat.

I was trying refere sources points that such things could be

or technical components.   It was not my intention to

  I can\'t speak for Mr. Rancke-Madsen, but ISTR that the original thread was
one about piracy occurring _with very expensive vessels capturing each other_,
and merely got shortened at some point. Taxing by speed-boats or break-ins
at the dock were both left out, although the former clearly has some
validity.

  However, given the relation of capital requirements, it would be much
more accurate to discuss piracy/commerce raiding in great waters, which
while not a current phenomenon is a well-documented one.

  Me Too! FWIW, I don\'t recall anyone claiming that piracy was impossible
(although the accusation gets made regularly); the debate oscillates
between what is the nature of piracy on the frontiers, and why it is/isn\'t
/should be impossible in core regions.

...a sad little world in the Marches.  Using the "Rob & Jon"
trade method (http://www.metronet.com/~washi/Tas/Starports/),
It looks like Treece gets approximately

	1000 passengers per week    = 50k passengers per year
	4000 tons of cargo per week = 200k tons cargo per year

At an average of, say, 5000 Cr per passenger, and 1kCr per ton
of cargo, the throughput of this trade route is

	weekly: 5000 x 1000   + 4000    x 1000 = MCr 9
	yearly: 5000 x 50,000 + 200,000 x 1000 = MCr 450

   Half a billion credits per year: about the price of one ship
   plus crew plus maintenance.

Perhaps Treece, then, has MCr 450 in permanent system defense.
In addition, a patrol ship wanders by once in awhile:

   Patrol Ship cost: MCr 400 (??)
   Weekly Revenue  : MCr 9
   Patrol ship frequency: 9 in 400, or 1 in 44

   One week for every 44 weeks on patrol, this ship will be in the
   Treece system.  I\'m sure this doesn\'t count time in jump, so
   a visit every 88 real weeks might be in order here.

Opinions?

I am soliciting your opinions about the system defense analysis
below, especially suggestions.  In an effort to make the rules
simpler, I fudge and approximate; any suggestions to further
fudge and approximate are welcome, with the restriction that
it holds to the system trade article already written on my webpage;
vis, that the "passengers per week" number is ultimately the hard 
data to base all modifications and extrapolations on.  How I go
about extrapolating depends on my thoughts and your suggestions.

Rob

I. Underlying Assumptions

The Imperium is interested in preserving trade between member worlds.
System defense, then, is in direct proportion to the volume of trade
on that world.  Interplanetary trade for a system can be computed using
the "Rob & Jon" starport trade system; therefore, a good idea of what
that system\'s worth can be taken directly from there.

Ok, since my script uses a reasonable trade variant of the
"Rob & Jon" starport trade system, I\'ll use it to do the numbers.  
The article and its accompanying script, by the way, is at

http://www.metronet.com/~washi/Tas/Starports/
http://www.metronet.com/~washi/Tas/Starports/starporttrade2.html

II. Example One - Treece

Treece Trade Volume

Treece        2311 D232866-8    Na Po              610 Im M1 V 
Yori          2110 C360757-A    Ri De              713 Im F1 V

Keanou        2411 C792348-7  S Lo Ni              213 Im M3 III M2 D  
Echiste       2313 C53A313-A    Lo Ni Wa           720 Im G4 V  

Passengers per week:  3000
Freight per week   : 12000
Revenue per week   : MCr27

Treece System Defense

Suppose the system defense fleet\'s yearly budget is equal to one week\'s 
revenue for the system.  This means Treece is probably making payments on 
a fleet of SDBs and fighters:

	SDB yearly payments : MCr20
	Fighter yearly paymt: Cr750,000

So Treece probably has one SDB (or two if they\'re used) that it\'s making
payments on, plus maybe 8 fighters, and they\'re using the class D starport
for their base of operations.  The remaining cash goes into sundries, such
as maintenance and salaries.

For a more conservative estimate, I would suggest this rule of thumb:
   Passengers per week / 10 = system defense tonnage

Treece Patrol Frequency

Revenue/Patrol Ship Value ratio:  MCr27 / MCr440 = 1 / 16
Treece will also have a patrol ship in system 1 week out of 16.  If 
patrols last 2 weeks, then that scales up to 2 weeks out of 32.

For an estimate directly from passenger volume, use
	Passengers per week / 50,000

III. Example Two - Jae Tellona

Jae Tellona System Defense

Jae Tellona probably buys a quality fleet for its money.  A billion
credits is nothing to sneeze at.  It would probably be making payments
on 100 system defense boats, plus a few hundred fighters.  It will
also be putting cash into establishing and maintaining depots and
bases of operations throughout the system, especially the gas giants.

Another way of looking at it: JT can make payments on roughly 56,000
tons of system defense ships, including boats, bases, troops, and
perhaps even a jump-0 carrier.

This really looks reasonable to me.  The numbers aren\'t as astronomical
as I\'ve seen posted in the past (using pocket empire naval stats from
Trillion Credit Squadron, or Striker, or Pocket Empires).  They really
seem... well, low in comparison, but I like them lower anyhow.  Because
I like the frontier feel that the Marches should have.

Using my conservative rule of thumb as an alternate method, we get:
	Passengers per week / 10 = 31,000 tons for system defense

Jae Tellona Patrol Frequency

Revenue/Patrol Ship Value ratio: BCr2.8 / MCr440 = 6 or 7
Due to its large volume, 6 or 7 patrol ships will be in system at
any given time.

Using my alternate rule of thumb, we get:
	Passengers per week / 50,000 = 6 patrol ships

IV. Example Three - Vland
 
Now for another sanity check.
Let\'s pick Vland.

Vland Trade Volume

Vland	1717 A967A9A-F
Enaa	1716 B300859-A
Shinla	1816 C1608A9-B
Tauri	1817 A130998-E
Kirma	1718 A797111-F

Passengers per week: from 800,000 to 1,200,000
Freight per week   : from 3.2 Mt  to 4.8 Mt
Revenue per week   : from BCr 7.2 to BCr 11

Vland System Defense

Assuming Vland has a budget of BCr10, it can afford just about anything
it wants.  It has about 4 times the strength of Jae Tellona.  Expect to
see big bad squadrons.

Using the conservative rule, we get:
	 1,000,000 / 10 = 100,000 tons for system defense

Vland Patrol Frequency

Revenue/Patrol Ship Value ratio: BCr10 / MCr440 = 22
Vland has about 8800 tons of patrol ships in its system at any given 
time (22 ships x 400 tons/ship = 8800 tons).

Using the alternate rule, we get:
	1,000,000 / 50,000 = 20 patrol ships

V. Summary

A few months ago, Jon Buller and I cooked up a relatively simple
way to calculate trade between two systems, and by implication a
way to calculate the total interstellar trade in one system.
From this, then, we have attached a revenue onto every system.
Since the 3I protects trade, then, the budget for this protection
can be tied into the commercial revenue of a system.  By making a
few major assumptions (i.e. one week of trade in a system equals
the system defense budget and determines the patrol schedule for 
that world), hard numbers have been derived as to how well-guarded
any given system is.  Moreover, the results appear to scale nicely,
allowing people to scale defense up or down based on how the 
Imperium operates in their Traveller Universe.

Being an old fashioned kinda guy, I believe that if you have good but old

If we assume a way around entropy, then a couple more things crop up -
surface area requirements for power plants will disappear. Some people want
this, to simplify FFS\' design sequences.

Secondly, how much is such a shielding system cost - if it\'s in the
megacredit range, most civilians wont have it, and it will only be a factor
for the military.

Nope. Take the naval budgets of Trin, Rhylanor and Mora - the three big, hi
tech, industrial worlds of the Spinward Marches. Allocate an
internal-security budget of Cr 5 per person per year. Some of this is paid
through the Subsector and Sector Navies, some is paid for via the Bank of
Regina etc supporting piracy suppression activitiesa (if a Free Trader with
a mortgage gets taken, the owner-captain loses his life. It is the bank
that takes the MCr 50 hit on it\'s bottom line).

Name me three ships on international shipping that have been taken by armed
force, and either been stripped of cargo or have been sold off in their
entirety in a freeport.

Now, look at Traveller sensor and combat ranges vis a vis the 100 diameter
limit.

Now, look at the cost of a ship that will defeat a civilian.

Now, look at jump lag and the time freighters spend in port, and give me
three reasons why your bank will not, as a requirement of your starship
mortgage, require you to notify your next port of call via the first
available ship going there.

The thing is I\'ve no idea what else you could tell, or how hard and/or time

Fuel and maintenance stations are what the orbital component of the Starports already includes,
most of the time.
Armed stations are only useful for the defence of such obital installations in my eyes. There
they can really use their adavantages.
Given the distances and space involved for defense of specific planets (SIZE!) or even systems,
they won´t be effective for othr duty. That stay the responsibility of the SDB´s!

  What do you think makes for a good accounting basis for Imperial
taxation of mega-corps? I realize it\'s a bit of an odd question,
but I\'m interested in ideas other than taxing trade (popular) or
just levying on member worlds (one of my favourites).

  Certainly the level of taxation needed to vastly enlarge the
Navy\'s tanker fleet is going to approach confiscatory levels in
terms more used to the concept than our societies.

  Correct. But cautious business practice, and _opportunity
costs_ will substantially reduce the priority or enthusiasm
for such a project. This is a known and current phenomenon;
accounting, unlike economics, can often function like an exact
science (with Acts of Dog, aka tax laws, thrown in).

  I try to avoid discussing meson weapons because their targetting
solutions are unbelievably screwy at long range (i.e., at ranges at
which other Trav weapons can engage, they effectively _can\'t_ hit
a Traveller type target. Yippee. Correct, Bruce?). Fire control
(/light lag) should be the limiter for both ship spinal and planetary
arms. The warship in question is moving, which gives it an envelope
independent of weapon size where it can\'t really be hit.

  Besides which, a spinal mount is the last weapon I\'d want for
hunting freighters, given a large capital-class raider.

  Again, I\'m sure they _can\'t_ detect every single intelligence
ship. It doesn\'t follow that the attempt won\'t be made. Enemy
/foreign operations are themselves a good source of intelligence.
Also, if the possibility of a surprise attack from peace-time
deployments is admitted (almost certain given Trav com-lags),
then a trip-wire or picket line must be deployed, probably two
sub-sectors deep. An actual sensor picket flight would likely
be mil-spec type S equivalent, but each system would need one
or more Fleet Couriers, which in CT/S:9 are adequate to cook
the goose of most conceivable pirate ships.

  So yes, these extra (passive) elements would be near the border
only, but that begs the question of what\'s deployed / extant
further back?

Except that Treece does _not_ have the starport capablity to build a
system defense spacecraft.  So, it will have to import one, either by
lease or outright sale, from a neighboring world.  Once the spacecraft
is insystem, Treece will not be able to maintain it (due to lack of
starport facilities and industrial capacity) - so it will either go
unmaintained and unrepaired (and anyone who has spent time shipboard
knows how much time is spent in maintenance) until/unless the ship is
ferried to a suitable starport or a tender comes to Treece.  Finally,
Treece does not have the technological background to educate and train a
crew to man the spaceship, so they will have to farm out that work as
well.

Then there is the issue of what TL to build the ship to.  If you build
the ship to TL9 standards, there is at least the hope that Treece will
elevate itself to the point of being able to man and maintain the ship
in the near future.  But what good is TL9 to a TL F corsair?  If you
build to TL F, then you are guarantee that you will be dependant on
foriegn mercenaries for your system defense for a long, long time.

Then there is the support for the crew.  Even if you put your locals
through intensive Hi-TL training, how do you keep them happy?  Treece is
a TL 8 world, anyone manning the spacecraft is going to be used to TL9+
equipment and amenities.  Oh joy, shore leave.

Seriously tho\', Treece obviously has a limited amount of hard capital to
spend - how do you equip your system defense forces?  Do you put modern
(i.e. up to the TL of the SDB) training equipment at their base so the
off-duty crews can maintain their skills?  How about living quarters,
are they built to the TL of the SDB or the TL of the world?  How do you
pay them - Imperial standard or in comparison to what the average worker
on Treece makes?  At some point, concessions are going to have to be
made, as these SDB crews will become aware of, or come from, much higher
standards of living than are available on Treece.  They will have to be
compensated for that - at which point you start having the citizens of
Treece (who are paying for all this) begin to notice that perhaps they
are not living nearly as well as the people who protect them.  People
tend not to like this...at least in my experience.  After a while, they
tend to get very...vocal, about this.

Finally, who are these mercenary SDB forces loyal too?  In Treece\'s
case, the government type is \'Captive\' - so most likely any SDB force is
going to have a dual purpose.  While this solves a lot of the problems
(who cares what the yokels think, shoot \'em if they protest), the issues
of crewing and maintenance become more pronounced - obviously we are not
going to want to man the garrison forces with potentially disgruntled
locals.  On other worlds, the SDB forces who are loyal to one faction or
another could easily be pulled into intergovernment, international, or
even interplanetary disputes.

  Yes, the "(IMO)" was key, which is why I included it. Is this
an issue (IYTU) of the assets not existing, not being allocated,
or being non-deployed for either specified or mysterious reasons?

  Free/unfree in what sense? Fiscal or deployment commitments?
Remember, sub-sector and colonial/planetary navies of systems
wealthy enough to possess significant assets will also require
escort vessels to meet wartime commitments (including the escort
and scouting functions for the heavy units).

  These units are both the most suitable for internal security
patrols and the least likely to be decommissioned in peacetime.
The planetary elements likely can\'t leave their home systems,
and the sub-sector units are probably patrolling within (or very
near?) their sub-sector of origin, but that covers those two levels
within proximity of a wealthy (pop 8+?) world.

  Those were questions. I would suggest that many of these mission
profiles are functionally indistinguishable, and the vessels and
crews thus extensively interchangeable. In fact, ships ostensibly
dedicated (i.e., budgeted) for either of these two tasks are the
most closely designed (and best trained) for each others performance
envelopes.

  In fact, the Navy almost appears to be the only organ of the
Imperium. The feudally based administration has its\' own revenues
from fiefs, the Imperial family owns major shares in the largest
economic engines in the 3I; that leaves very little but the Navy
to soak up the Imperial budget, and even a third rate ship of the
line costs as much as a thousand little couriers and x-boats for
the IISS.

  Assuming that the Navy gets its\' money, rather than it being 
wasted on subsidies for unwed fathers on Porozlo (say, Marine
recruiting?) then what will it buy and where will it put it?
That would be interesting to explore and compare with previous
analyses and source material.

In space, you can detect an object at ranges dramatically longer than you can
actually resolve it -- a 1 meter optical telescope at the theoretical limits of
resolution might be able to tell the configuration type of a thousand-ton ship
at 1 brilliant lances hex.  It isn\'t entirely clear how good resolution
traveller sensors actually have, grav-focus technology might apply here.  There
is some relationship between ability to resolve an object and the ability to
get a fire-control lock, figure that you can resolve an object at half a range
band closer than you can get a fire control lock (so about 1% of detection
range) -- at this point you will be able to determine the size and hull
configuration of the vehicle.  Another half-band closer and you should be able
to determine the general model of ship, yet another half-band and you can
determine the specific model, and recognize reasonably distinctive individual
ships.  Realistically, IR has dramatically lower resolution than visual light,
assume that you can only do this operation with the reflected signature of the
vessel (subtract a full range band if trying to do HRT resolution).  Lidar/AEMS
can image vehicles using the same procedure as PEMS.

Other things you can detect (some more useful than others):

Drive spectrum.  Depending on some assumptions about how thruster plates work,
this might or might not give you information about the drive -- it might be
that all drives from one shipyard have a specific spectrum, and drives from
other shipyards have slightly different spectra.  This might even be as
distinctive as a fingerprint.  This can be done at detection range, but
requires a separate roll.

Active sensors will tell you exact range (and velocity towards/away from the
scanning vessel), and do so automatically.  Passive sensors can tell you range
if two ships both focus on the same object and are in communication; one ship
can do this if it has a reasonable idea of the target object\'s acceleration (by
scanning, moving, and scanning again).  This is possible at detection range,
but requires a separate roll.  Observing an object for an extended period will
typically allow making a reasonable guess as to range.

If you know the range, you can determine signature (and thus, indirectly, power
output) and acceleration, which indirectly determines mass; however, I suspect
military ships are capable of some form of spilling of energy from thrusters
which allows them to change their apparent power output to appear larger (at a
minimum, ships with EMM can probably choose not to use it).  If thruster plates
have a distinctive signature, it will be possible to determine velocity by
checking the red/blue shift of the thruster plates.

The above was NOT the point that was being made. I don\'t necessarily
disagree with your scenario and in fact tend to agree with it.

What I took exception to was the "Sigh. You\'re not listening" passages
indicating 1) I\'m too stupid to understand; 2) Too lazy to do the research
to prove my point; or 3) Someone approaching me with a paternal attitude
like they\'re dealing with a small child.  Get a grip, I\'m 46 years old,
served in the Army for 20 years on four continents in three "conflicts", got
an IQ over a fricking egg plant and an attitude of kiss my @$$ whenever
ANYONE patronizes me.

What\'s the problem of having pirates in certain circumstances under certain
conditions.  Why is it any one here\'s job to have to justify anything in our
game to you or Hans.  The attitude that pervades the posts is what got to
me, I wasn\'t even going to post on the subject because it\'s so inflammatory.

Going back to the original posts (correct me if I\'m wrong), but I seem to
remember this started out that you (generic) wouldn\'t attack any ship who\'s
capitol value was less than yours.  In other words why are you risking a
400MCr Corsair against a 50 MCr (max value ship and cargo) merchant ship.
That was a fair question and I was pondering it and postulating a response
when the post hit "Show any pirate activities in recent history and I\'ll
retract" or something along those lines.  Several people responded with
insubstantial events even by my standards.  I then went out and did some
searching thru the web and came up with a number of documented acts of
piracy that met the criteria all on one web page.  I posted that web address
and right after that someone else posted another three or four web pages.
What kind of confirmation do YOU need when someone proves their point?  I
don\'t have a problem with piracy being all but non-existent (key words are
"all but"), that ain\'t the problem.  I just don\'t like other people\'s
beliefs and ATTITUDES shoved up my rearward dark spot without my permission.

With the proper PASSIVE sensors you could theoretically "finger print"
drives to ship.

  I agree with the latter, but I have to conclude that the former
opinion is inaccurate given the weight of evidence, particularly
for early modern (/proto-bureaucratic) states. It might be an
interesting experiment to do a model of the Imperium based on
one of these "less relatively regulated" states, carrying over
the policy intentions from the historical record.

  None of the conditions listed are any sort of bar to regulation;
rather, they are restrictions on the amount of control exercised
by or possible to the Imperial capital.

  OK. If you feel inclined to investigate further I can recommend
Clapham, Third World Politics (1985) as a primer. For historical 
material anything by Bosher on fiscal reform and administration
in France, Burkholder/Johnsom, Colonial Latin America (1998; an
excellent source for control of subordinate units in an empire,
and for administrative objectives and mechanisms.

  Oh. I thought you were using the technical economic term in a
context I might be familiar with; AFAIK, 3I economic policy is
often described in those terms, canonically (i.e., it\'s most
clearly not a centralised or command economy, although that might
be subject to change under a Jump-station transport regime).

  Clearly the IN exists at established levels to deal with external
threats; it remains to explore dedicated internal forces and any
cross-over between the two asset pools.

  Here\'s a potential problem with the "piracy at minor irritant levels"
thesis; under this regime any group of PC\'s/seedy characters/Vargr
could quite likely go into business for themselves quite successfully,
seamlessly switching back and forth between smuggling, piracy, slavery,
hijacking, organ-legging, and kidnapping with little chance of being caught
in the short run. When deliberately designing a background in which piracy
is _possible_ it\'s important to consider that you get an acceptable
likely equilibrium level of activity (given risk, reward, and ease of
market entry).

  I suppose there\'s no practical way of figuring out what ship is
supposed to be what? If no electronic device is reasonably tamper
resistant, then banks clear account info very slowly, and electronic
account carrying becomes impossible.

  I\'m not sure what you said. The Imperium is responsible for

  This has been covered by others; it seems vastly unlikely to

market for illegal nukes? How is nuke licensing handled, or is
civilian possession banned?

It is from a gamers point of view.  The money flowing through
the nobilty will be a big budget.  So will the Scout service
(including the Xboats).  You also have the Imperial Research
stations.  The cost of all those starports.  The Imperial
court system.  What ever passes for the FBI and CIA (the
political aspects, the military would be in the military).
There is also the Army (they not be as big, but if you 
are holding planets by preventing the landing of troops
they are significant.  What else is there?  Does the
Emperor get a cut?  (Just how damn rich is he?)
(I can\'t have come up with all them off the top of my head).
And then there are all those little things that you never
think of (weights and measures, diplomatic corp, etc.)
They may not be as big, but they certainly wouldn\'t mind more
money.  On top of that, there is the pressure to lower
taxes from economic interests.  There won\'t be any 
money "left over".  It doesn\'t happen.

In any case, the navy has it\'s own competing needs that
will make sure that no money is "left over".  There 
are the different forces to stop the Solomani, Zhodani,
etc.  There is internal piracy, smuggling piracy
patrols, there is stopping external raiding by the Vargr,
there is the cost of bases, the naval administration,
etc.  There is also the competition between spending money
on salaries and equipment.

> The feudally based administration has its\' own revenues

Yeah, it might come of the top rather than the bottom line,
it is still competing for money that might go to the
Imperium.

I think that sticks with the Imperial Family (rather than
going into the Imperium).

Well, I would guess (I don\'t think I can come up with a list
that doesn\'t forget something and any analysis is only
going to be "one possibility") most of it goes to fleets.
Then, in descreasing order, bases (this is where programs
for enlisted men get put), administration, military
intellegence, military R&D.

One of the nice things in _GURPS Vehicles_ is a discussion of three levels
of information from a sensor contact.  Detection means that "something is
out there" and your get a bearing, sometimes a range and speed, depending
on the type of sensor.  Recognition gives more information, generally the
category the object fits in, "400dt ship at 9 o\'clock, 807 kilo-klicks." 
Identification provides an even higher level of information, allowing you
to specify the vehicle and give details about it.

  Someone already did a very cute police commsat; any ship
that doesn\'t evade (e.g., matches courses with a ballistic
object) finds out just what the hit rate is for big lasers
at "maximum" <giggle> range.

  Augment with rocket boosters for evasion and it will handle
very small warships and pretty much any civvie.

  A station is (realistically; combat system may disagree) a
really bad idea if an eventual mission is fighting off a 
capital ship (aka "suicide").

  But even a small station can fit your profile (HG) by using
an asteroid (dirt-cheap, pun intended) hull and some sort of
power supply that won\'t cost an arm-and-a-leg; reverse "shore
pwer" hookup anyone?

Actually, Hans, I see starmerc vs pirate vs corsair as a sepctrum, based
upon the published sources. In Hard Times, it references that starmerc
without work sometimes turn pirate, and the difference between a corsair
and a pirate is one of paperwork. As with ground mercs (see Bk 4:
Mercenary), not all tickets will include full support.

A "Commerce Raider" of any flavor is a light warship with cargo capability,
as I understand the term. Whether the operator is a pirate, starmerc,
merchant, or corsair depends on what he\'s doing. Starmercs sell their
combat capability, cosairs and pirates use their combat capability to take
value from other merchant craft, and armed merchantmen (like many vargr
"Corsairs") turn to combat when they can\'t make enough to get by by
legitimate means. The legitamate means for commerce raiding are when world
or corporation A declares war on war or corp. B... since the rules of
warfare [MT Imp Encyc. p28] allow for armed conflict between members with
the rationale "a short war is deemed preferable to continuing tension,
sabotage, and political agitation." [ibid.]

Where there is warfare, there are privateers or pirates. Where there is the
potential to gain valuables without the time or expese of gaining them
through more legitamate trade, there will be those who snatch and grab.

Based upon the Traveller Adventure, piracy is not overly common, but is a
common enough threat where trade wars or local conflicts exist.

During the rebellion, the nature of piracy changes, but not the existance.

Also, the fact that the career exists indicates that it at least has a
large enough basis of operations to support some significant portion of the
population (ie, enough that is is worthy of being one of the 18 careers
under MT).

As to methods: Does every ship exit at 100 diameters? not IMTU. Does every
ship operate a transponder? IMTU, the transponder, at least the SDG chip
ones, screams bloody murder when turned back on.  So, until the late
10-hundreds, with the introduction of the SDG chip transponders, it\'s not a
bid deal. Two pirates operating together, can tweak the salvage rules. One
cripples the target, and the other "chases him off", claims the cargo, or
even the ship as slavage in exchange for providing aid, and splits the take
with the other ship(s) in the group. All it takes is being able to get
there and force them to give you value before the anti-piracy forces can
drive you off. IMTU, most piracy occurs on the way OUT from a world... and
almost all of the rest is sposored interdicts.

Just like the 3d6 for 18+ roll for hijacking, piracy is implied in the
rules. Therefore, it must exist, even if it is not directly akin to "Modern
Piracy". I figure most piracy is supported by normal merchant operations
with the occasional raid and occasional "merc op". Full time piracy is only
going to be a rare occasion. But when a pirate can show he\'s a "Legitimate
Merchant", he\'s going to be able to cover up his ops.

Now a question for the list:
From cannon sources, I have only found support for a handful of imperial
crimes: Murder, Treason, Hijacking, violation of the Rules of Warfare. Is
there a cannon referency to Piracy (as opposed to hijacking) being an
imperial crime? IMTU, Piracy is a crime if a letter of marque is not issued.

Adventure Idea: Ship picks up a passenger, leaves planet. On way out,
corsair pulls along, and asks if any citizens from planet X are aboard
(whete x is a planet in another sector). Said passenger just happens to be
"Inactive Reservist" (IE, out but still elligible for recall and still
officially a member) of Planet X\'s military. Pirate requests said
individual be turned over in accordance with his Letter of marque, from
planet Y (near planet X). The locals, in accordance with the rules of War,
refuse to intervene in a non-local matter (ie, they recognize the LoM, and
that the passenger may be intercepted a he\'s technically still a member of
the military).

Assume, given the D starport and TL8 you hire starmercs who go elsewhere
for maintainence at an obscene cost of 25% of unit sticker price per annum.
Treece is owned by Inthe (2410), which is TL9 and a B starport ... we will
assume this means it\'s limited to maintaining TL9 spacecraft itself.

Now, we use the TL12 Svennson Small Craft Katts class Light Fighter, which
costs MCr 22.5 each in rough numbers. We buy fifteen, probably based on
Treece itself, plus two modified Tracey class freighters to play Den Mommy
and shuttle them to and from Macene (2612) for maintainence (a 13dt fighter
needs a 52dtons for a spacious hangar, plus 14 dtons for a docking ring,
plus 15 dtons for an electronics and a mechanical shop), and it looks to be
about a months trip to Macene. Macene is TL E and has a B starport, so they
will have no problem doing work there that the Tracey class cant manage
themselves. If I was in a argumentative mood I\'d also argue that the Katts
class fighters should be cheaper as they are built (possibly on Regina)
with TL12 technology in a TL15 Imperium.

I\'d say that an escort of two Katts class fighters sounds about right for
escorting outgoing convoys, and if planned precipitation points are
allowed, we make sure that one fighter is on patrol near it at all times.
That puts ten on the ground, three on patrol and two going back and forth
to Macene for maintainence.

This all costs about MCr 100 a year, or 22% of trade revenue per annum.
This is a bit on the high side to pay for purely by trade revenue (I\'d
expect about 3% of trade revenue to be reasonable). Now, Treece has a
population of 800 million people, so I think we need a direct tax subsidy
of ummm 0.1 credits per person per year to support our flotilla. 

If we want to pay in kind, we need to sell call it 100 200 kiloton short
range det lasers, or 100 10 megawatt fission plants, suitable for use in
TL8-9 Belter colonies such as Shionthy(2306), Patinir(3207) or Gitosy
(2918). Not that much for a 800 million population world.

Now 4000 tons of cargo a week is about 40 Free Traders, or 8 traders with
500 dton cargo capacities. In either case, I would personally advise
traders that when the Daily Fighter Sweep is happening, and escort them out
that way.

For that matter, *historically* most pirates were the result of mutiny.
The Traveller equivalent of some of them would be a poorly paid crew
with an "owner aboard" hijacking the ship when it had a valuable cargo.

And for that matter, there\'s a story by (I think) Gordon R. Dickson
called "Hi-lifter" which describes the hijacking of a starship (done in
spite of a fair amount of paranoia!) It should be mandatory reading for
Traveller players and refs.

I especially like the way he gets the people holding him to supply him
with the means of escape!

It\'s like this. It\'s simpler to assume that you move the full distance
the first turn rather than the half distance. otherwise it gets messy
playing.

Consider, you\'d have to recall that if you did a 1 g burn you did 1 hex
that turn, but *two* hexes every turn after that. And so on for other
burns. And for multi-turn burns it gets kinda ugly. 

The difference has a big negative effect on playability, for only a
marginal increase in realism.

Not quite. There\'s no upper limit on the size of quantum black holes
formed during the Big Bang. So if they were big enough then, they\'d be
getting down to useful sizes now. And going out in a blaze of glory if
we didn\'t feed them soon. :-)

The Hubble is a bit large for a ship\'s telescope. But not by as much as
you might think. I think a one meter scope is quite plausible.
Especially since zero-g manufacturing would help reduce the cost of the
mirrors (heck, with decent zero-g facilities you could cast mirrors out
of something like Invar alloy and "spin-figure" them to a good
approximation of the right curvature).

Get well away from the planet you are leaving, and you ought to be able
to detect gas giants *easily* at ranges of a mere 6 parsecs (you don\'t
care about anything farther away, as you can\'t jump that far).

The hard part is caluculating the distance to the star, and the
planet\'s orbit. Assuming this is an exploration mission, then you "waste"
some fuel by jumping to "known" positions in the system you are leaving
and observing from there (to give you a longer baseline). And you\'d
want observations spaced over at least a couple of months, unless
you\'ve got the fuel to go clear across the target system if you goofed
on the position of the gas giant.

Sure. It\'s a tried and true tactic. Just remember that you *aren\'t*
between the star and his buddies a few hundred thousand km off to the

The "erenkov" is definite. The C/Ch depends on how you choose to
convert the Cyrillic letter to the Latin alphabet. Sort of like
Tsar/Czar. :-)

I can\'t really say. I don\'t have references handy that tell me how you
determine the *wavelength* of the radiation, and if it depends on the
velocity. If it does depend on the velocity (ie in the same medium,
faster particles emit shorter wavelength radiation) then it could get
dangerous given fast enough particles. As it is, I think it\'s just this
weird blue glow. 

Speaking of blue glows, don\'t confused the (possible) "blue glow" due
to Cerenkov radiation in, say, air with the "blue glow" due to an
intense source of ionizing radiation ionizing the air. 

Though I suspect that if you are close enough to see *either* you\'ll be
dead shortly. :-)

The trick *now* is *getting* "real gunboats". Even a PT boat requires
armament that\'s not easily obtained. And the ones sold surplus either
have the weapons removed or rendered inoperable.

And one of the reasons for this is to make it harder to play pirate.

I can\'t run the spreadsheets, so I can\'t say.

But one thing that I\'d like to see the plausibility of is the
"planetoid monitor". You basicly take a nickel-iron asteroid several km
in diameter, take a *long* time to move it into position, and build a
defense station into it. 

As long as the locations/layout of the interior facilities are secret,
it\'s a tough nut to crack. Are your meson guns hitting something vital?
Or just heating up more iron?

It might be possible to play games with a *huge* iceball. Cover the
outside with something to help prevent sublimation of the surface, and
your installations can *melt* their way into it. And use thrusters plus
heating coils to keep changing position. Make one hell of a fuel depot
too. 

The extreme example of this later idea would be mobile deep meson sites
in the oceans of Europa (or is it ganymede? I forget).

A calutron type seperator could easily be built outside the ship and
likely with spare parts from the fusion reactor! Heck, given the power
available, if *I* was doing it, I wouldn\'t bother with "chemistry". I\'d
just vaporize the ore, ionize the vapor, and "sort" by mass. 

Gravitics ought to be able to throw in some nice tricks too. And it\'s
already an open secret that you can use the right frequencies of laser
light to selectively excite different isotopes. Given a tunable,
weapons grade laser, I expect that approach could be quite promising
as well.

So obtaining fissionables is fairly simple. The hard part is getting
the required precision in the timing of the shaped charges if you go
for an implosion device. If you go for a simple "gun" type weapon, then
the ship\'s machine shop is quite adequate. You\'ll waste a lot of
fissionables, but it will go boom.

Make a ship accelerate for 10 turns in a straight line with your system and
see if it comes out right. A multigameturn system is an numerical
simulation that samples speed and position at each turn. If you use
integrated distances as basis for your samples you\'ll get errors which will
grow as the number of turns increase  while my system will get closer and
closer to reality as the number of turns increase.

Actually try both versions within a computer program to see the
differances. (check out http://www.teazle.com and the SpaceShuttle minigame
for my version of a thrusting ship in a gravity field)

It would but stars are pretty small on the sky sphere so it would be pretty
hard to simulate on the mapboard. In my system I use an entire sector to be
starward and reduce the Optics, radar and neutrino sensors a lot if the
scan in that direction unless they\'re in planetary shadow. This is
unrealistic (too big an arc) but adds a playable element of "terrain" in
spacecombat. Star direction, planetary shadows, LOS versus planets make
space combat with 2 combatants (the normal case for roleplaying fights IMO)
more interesting. Neutrino scanners can see through planets (unless they\'re
HEAVILY industrialized TL 10+) but suffer the star arc even if in planetary
shadow.

Everything got worse of course when I had to start using 10 000 km squares
but at least I can do interesting things with gasgiants.

Here I seem to be at fault. I must have missed both the references you

Ah. Back to the Traveller universe. The impossibility, or rather, extreme
difficulty that IMO will make pirates scarcer than hens\' teeth, is not one
single factor but a combination that stacks up one on top of the other
until it becomes too expensive to be a pirate. The discussion has gone
back and forth over specific factors, but no one has addressed the
overall picture. It\'s all very well to talk glibly about this or that
fringe system being unpatrolled, but if it is a fringe system, then the
pirate will have to spend time (and if you own a starship, time is money)
to get there, will have to be lucky enough to get there just as the
system is visited by a merchant ship, and will have to be able to capture
it. All this means that just saying: "Hey, it could happen in a fringe
system" is not a very cogent argument.

Yes, it is Traveller canon. But so are all the things I base my opinion on:
The cost of a merchant ship; the cost of a ship capable of chasing down and
defeating a merchant ship; the earning potential of a ship with a 1G
maneuver drive; the earning potential of a ship with a 1G maneuver drive;
the resources available to the Imperial navy; the attitude of the Imperial
navy to pirate havens; the resources available to a planetary navy; by
analogy the resources available to a merchant company; the existence of
transponders (though not their exact working); the amount of time a merchant
ship spend going from one destination to another and where it spends the
time in between.

You\'re reading too much into it. What I wanted to convey by the "Sigh. You\'re
not listening" passage was: "Sigh. You\'re not listening." If you check the
posting I was responding to (not yours, btw. so why you took offense is
unclear to me) it did use national ships as an example, which is not very
helpful, since my basic thesis is that under the conditions prevailing in
the CT Imperium, piracy is just not profitable. Ie. the expected expenses
outwheigh the expected return. Since this is of little concern to national
ships, they don\'t provide very good analogies.

Get a grip yourself. If expressing regret at people not listening when it

patronizing. Only, that\'s not my definition of being patronizing and I\'m not
going to apologize for it.

None at all. It\'s just that Steven, Ian, I et alii believe that those
conditions don\'t exist in and around the CT Imperium.

>Why is it any one here\'s job to have to justify anything in our game to you
>or Hans.

It\'s nobody\'s job to justify anything to anybody about their own game. FYI
I stated early in the original debate (lo, these many months ago...) that I
used pirates in my own campaign. I just bemoaned the fact that they don\'t
make a whole lot of sense given the other conditions of the _official_
Traveller universe. Others responded that they did make sense, and the
dispute was off.

No one is even _required_ to prove any claim he makes. But if you want to
convince anyone of the truth of your claim, providing proof (or at least
evidence) is a distinct bonus. That cuts both ways, of course, but IMO the
pro-piracy people are so infuriatingly vague about their claims. What I
would like was for someone to provide a complete analysis of one pirate
trip: Make whatever assumptions he wanted (that didn\'t contradict other
parts of canon) and then tell me what kind of ship he\'s using, how it is
financed, where it is based, where it goes to find its prey, what it does
while it is waiting, how it selects the prey, how it captures it, what he
does with it afterwards, and how he returns to his home port with a profit.

No, that wasn\'t quite it. It was a combination of two things: 1) Some of us
believe that starships are few enough and sufficiently impossible to disguise
against a determined examination that it is possible to track down a starship
if you have sufficient particulars about it; we also think that if you are
performing ordinary business at a starport, you (at the very least) risk
leaving behind sufficient particulars. Depending on just how hard it is to
fake transponders, you may even have to chose between doing any business at
all or leaving behind your true transponder code. 2) Therefore a pirate
who captures a ship will have to ditch the ship, much as a bank robber
will have to ditch his getaway car. So unless the "take" is worth more
than the pirate ship, the pirate is taking a net loss.

Yes, but only because we believe the risk is very great. If it was a
sufficiently small risk, it wouldn\'t matter that much.

Actually, the whole line is a major digression. Long ago I claimed that I
hadn\'t heard of any privately owned warships (or even armed merchants)
running down another merchant ship an capturing it or its cargo lately. I
still haven\'t heard of any such activity, but I understand that you have.

No more, and I regret that I have overlooked both postings. I hope we\'ve

Ah, but that "all but" is equally uncanonical. According to canon, piracy
is endemic all over the Traveller universe (check the random encounter
tables). There have been some ingenious suggestions made about very
special circumstances that would allow someone to turn pirate. But the
"Hey, it\'s a living" piracy portrayed in several canonical Traveller
products don\'t make economic sense.

Ian:  Thanks for this analogy.  I was missing this in my thinking, and
therefore didn\'t like it.  That makes perfect sense to me, particularly
after having just finished the Hornblower series again.  If you can
detect an enemy, and he is stronger, you can try to escape, or stay out
of range either until reinforcements arrive or until you can jump to
safety.

What would be the Traveller equivalent of staying to windward or would
there be such a thing?  Being outside the 100 diameter limit?  What are
the tactical advantage points?

This is not accurate.  (3) gives you the acceleration *after* time \'t\' has
elapsed.  The *average* velocity for the time you are accelerating is the
operative velocity to plug into d=v*t, not the velocity at the *end* of
that period.

And since, in Traveller with reactionless thrusters, velocity is always
changing, the formula is always wrong.

Perhaps it isn\'t because a few people disagree with you.  Please be clear

although it may very well be a good game system.

true, but you then need to know which way to avoid significant radiation.
This information will not always be available. Further, if you try to
monkey with the wavelength, you cut the radiation efficiency significantly.
The laws of thermodynamics are not always your friend. 

On the other hand, I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that the referee
can postulate away these troublesome items; she may just need to be
prepared to deal with the ramifications.

Can the Imperium directly tax private busniesses? I would think not. As I
see it, it is the individual worlds that set their own taxrate, while the
subsector duke sets his rate that this world has to pay, while the sector
duke sets his rate that the subsector has to pay, and the Imperium gets
their funds from taxing the sector dukes. 

This means that there probably will be very large differences in taxation
levels dependent on the political power of the worlds, and worlds owned by
mega-corps will be powerful enough to get a really low taxation from the
subsector duke. This again means that the subsector duke has to raise the
taxation of other less politically powerful worlds, so that he has the
money to run his subsector administration AND pay the sector duke the tax
he is asking for.

I like this idea too.  It seems that it would be very reasonable to have
ships carrying official bulletins in their computers to be downloaded to
the next StarPort Authority on the ship\'s arrival insystem.  (I\'m
thinking we had this discussion before).  In that package there would be
information on all ships with filed flight plans, announced next ports
of call, anticipated dignitaries\' itineraries, etc. for that port of

IIRC, the CT (HG and TCS) campaign rules allowed ships to hang out
in the "outer system" - far enough away from any defending fleets that
they could not be effectively engaged. They couldn\'t refuel, and any orders
you gave them were delayed, but at least they were safe until their
power plant fuel (or life support consumables?) ran out. This was the 
standard place to find the remnants of a defeated system defense fleet,
or the jump fuelless survivors of a failed invasion fleet - ticking away
on minimum power, hoping for rescue or reinforcement.

I don\'t know that word. What does it mean?

In the Traveller universe the difference between a corsair and a pirate is
what race the crew is, but I suppose you mean the difference between a
pirate and a privateer. The basic difference between the two is where it
can go for logistical support and fencing of the loot (and how the crew
is treated if caught), but I agree that for the purpose of my claim they
are pretty much alike: They both have to earn more than they spend. The
crusial difference from my POW is between pirates/privateers and commerce
raiders. The former\'s primary purpose is to earn money, the latter to
cause the enemy losses. In other words, the commerce raider is backed by
a war chest of some kind.

>As with ground mercs (see Bk 4:
>Mercenary), not all tickets will include full support.

OK, so there may be some hybrids. I guess at some point piracy becomes
feasible if they get some subsidy.

>A "Commerce Raider" of any flavor is a light warship with cargo capability,
>as I understand the term. 

Maybe. Not as I use it. What would you call the kind of ship I describe
above?

>Whether the operator is a pirate, starmerc,
>merchant, or corsair depends on what he\'s doing.

I repeat, because this is the crucial point, for the purposes of my argument
a pirate has to make a living while a national ship dosen\'t. As such,
privateers fall into the pirate category (economically, not leagally) and
starmercs and raiders fall into the national ship category. Perhaps I
should star talking about unbacked and backed ships instead.

>Starmercs sell their combat capability, cosairs and pirates use their
>combat capability to take value from other merchant craft,

Right, and my claim is that under most circumstances the economics of the
Traveller univers makes that a losing proposition.

If that potential exist. But does it? Consider the cost of defending a
merchant route against the typical pirate or corsair compared to the cost
of losing even one merchant ship and tell me if a merchant company wouldn\'t
be stupid to let it\'s ships go unescorted?

>Based upon the Traveller Adventure, piracy is not overly common, but is a
>common enough threat where trade wars or local conflicts exist.

But the pirates of various Traveller encounter tables and some adventures
are not tradewar privateers or raiders. If they were, a passing Free Trader
would not be at risk. Remember, in a tradewar only the ships of the
opponent are legitimate prey.

You don\'t have to prove to me that pirates are canonical. What you have to
prove (if you want to, of course) is that they make sense.
 
>As to methods: Does every ship exit at 100 diameters? not IMTU.

They do in the official Traveller universe. Check the description of a
typical jump. Especially in the MT rules.

>Does every ship operate a transponder?

They do in the official Traveller universe. Whether they can be turned on
and off and the legalities involved depends on just what bit of canon you
prefer to other bits. IMTU they can be turned off, but you better have a
damn good reason if the authorities catch you at it (Like: "I was being
chased by a pirate!" ;-)

Well, that\'s part of it (and one of the disputed parts; I\'m not at all
convinced that it is so easy to get a free shot at a merchant ship), but
it\'s not all. You also have to be able to do it often enough to pay the
expenses of all those ships. It\'s not that you can\'t pirate a ship if the
circumstances are just right; it\'s that IMO the circumstances won\'t be
just right often enough to allow anyone to make a living as a pirate.

If its sponsored, it\'s not piracy.

Sure, it must exist. But does it make sense? Not IMO.

In that case the pirate is using a normal merchant ship, which makes him
ill equipped to pirate ships.

>with the occasional raid and occasional "merc op".

In that case the ship is a semi-warship, which makes it _impossible_ for
him to make a living by normal merchant operations.

>Full time piracy is only going to be a rare occasion. But when a pirate can

If he is doing legitimate operations he is leaving a paper trail. Since a
ship is such a big investment, he can\'t change it as he\'d change his car.
Sooner or later (and IMO sooner than later) the authorities are going to
become interested in him.

Douglas raised an issue -- how can a D-starport, low-tech world
like Treece maintain a system defense boat?

* First off, Treece can only afford 1 or 2 SDBs and a small handful
  of fighters; therefore, there won\'t be scads of in-system support
  personnel.

* I assume it would have to be on a standard, 40-year rent-to-own
  plan, with monthly 1/240 payments.  Delivery would be by some
  ship carrier, corporate or Imperial.  $$$

* All maintenance would have to be done by off-worlders; i.e. a
  house-call-driven maintenance ship, either corporate or Imperial. $$$

* Defense personnel would be military, which resolves the standard-of-
  living issue.

* All of these issues are waived if the system (like Treece) is a
  Captive Government -- obviously, the owning system supplies all
  necessary resources.  Problem solved.

Now, the question in my mind is: are these local defenses Imperial
or really Local?  If Local, then Imperial forces will be protecting
the starport, and local forces protect the worlds and spaceports,
is that correct?

Pirate has to make more money at piracy than he would
be making at legitamate business - and that he needs to
take ships, not just cargo?

Many pirates of Earth history didn\'t buy their ships, they stole them.
Why should a pirate in Traveller be any different? And if the ship
is stolen, you aren\'t making bank payments on it - a massive 
financial advantage over "legitimate" merchants.

Once that bank payment pressure is missing, it becomes much
easier to make ends meet with just stolen cargos, even though
you\'re selling them at stolen goods markdowns.

Why not take the ship? Too much hassle. If the ship could jump,
it would have jumped to evade you already. If it can\'t jump, you
can\'t put a prize crew aboard and jump away from the approaching
system patrol craft. Put a shot across their bow, pick through their
cargo and valuables, maybe even take a wealthy passenger or two
for later ransom and scoot - the ship captain will take fewer risks to 
protect someone else\'s (probably insured) cargo than he will to 
protect his ship, and if he expects you to take cargo and send 
him on his way he\'ll be more likely to surrender.

Besides, it\'s far easier to disguise the origin of several tons of 
(most kinds of) cargo than it is to disguise a starship.

A pirate would need to sneak into a system and lurk, though. Those
ref\'s with TU\'s where incoming ships make big light blazes or
easily detectable grav pulses on jump exit - are there ways a single
ship can come in-system with less chance of detection? Perhaps a
fleet would be obvious, but a sub-1000tn vessel might be able to
pick a location or something that would somewhat mask the 
jump exit?

A pirate needs good sensors, good acceleration, enough weaponry
to defeat the average merchant it\'s designed to take (it simply runs
from stronger merchants), stealthing capabilities (either through
actual stealth or deception tactics), cargo capacity sufficient for
taking home a haul, and enough extra life support to take care
of boarding parties and prisoners. The best pirate ring will have
a secret base where prisoners can be held for ransom and stolen
cargos can be processed (either to remove or forge evidence of
origin) and moved to a free trader or other ship that would be less
conspicuous in a normal port.

How do you keep such a pirate base a secret? When YTU has every
ship arrival from jumpspace easy to detect, it\'s tough - you need an
unpatrolled or unoccupied system with a fuel source available. You
also have to be ready to abandon the base on very short notice - 
perhaps you keep a stolen type - S scout there to evacuate the
base personell and most valuable loot.

I imagine a Pirate Captain\'s worst nightmare - arriving at his clan\'s
base and finding Imperial Marines there.

So as a military tactic it may not be usefull, but from a roleplaying

Ok: to avoid fractions, we will use 2G acceleration.
1 turn: vector 0-2, we move 1 (i.e. 0(initial velocity)+1(half of vector gained
this turn)
2 turns: vector 2-4, we move 3 (total 4)
3 turns: vector 4-6, we move 5 (total 9)
4 turns: vector 6-8, we move 7 (total 16)
As it happens, figuring that 1 G-turn is 1 hex/turn is off by about 8%, but
that\'s a rounding error.  Other than that, my rules are correct, because they
are correct physics (technically, they are newtonian physics and won\'t work
over really extreme velocities, but that\'s a nonfactor in the combat system).

Thanks for your comments. That\'s one of the reasons I love the TML. People
can offer up ideas you may not have considered. Now, having said that, I\'ll
let you know why I disagree with you :)

AEMS: I could be talked into lowering the AEMS to a much lower sensitivity,
for sure. Maybe a rating 5, rather than 10 (what\'s the range of that,
Bruce?).
But I think that a ship needs one for local traffic avoidance and landings.
In particular, I would want a ship that has to land in poor visibility to
have one - it seems to me that PEMS may not be all that useful in such
situations.

CG: I have my CG at 1G for 2 reasons...
* This ship is not a airframe, thus it must direct its thrust in the lift
direction, raher than relying on airfoils for lift. Since the design is
based on the "standard" thrust-parallel-to-decks plan, the thruster plate
thrust is not completely available for takeoffs and landings. Thus, 1 G CG.
* I want the ship to be able to land on just about any planet, including
ones with gravities nearing 2 G.

I don\'t see the problem...you can\'t put 2 passengers in a small stateroom -
it isn\'t allowed. But you can put two in a large. So what\'s the difference,
two small state rooms and two passengers, or 1 large stateroom and 2
passengers. Or am I missing something?

You know, as much as I enjoy this mailing list (and I DO enjoy it), I agree
that there is WAY too much rudeness going on.  I\'ve noticed a lot of
insensitive postings, beginning with "Nope.  You\'re wrong.  That\'s not true.
That\'s not right. You don\'t get it.  BZZZT!  Wrong answer! Try again.  Sigh
. . ." ad nauseum.

Did your mothers teach you guys to be so rude, or did you learn it on your
own?  These little "geek pissing contests," to see who can yell louder than
everyone else and therefore be declared the winner, are juvenile.  The WORST
part about it is that I suspect it keeps some lurkers/semi-lurkers (such as
myself) from posting, for fear that we will be confronted by one of the
"socially challenged."  I know I\'ve kept my opinion to myself on many
subjects, after seeing them pointlessly spiral out of control into a flame
war.  It\'s not that I don\'t want to post, it\'s just that I don\'t need the
aggravation.  I avoid conversations with obnoxious people in the real world;
why would I seek them out behind the screen?

We\'re dealing with people here, not computers.  Just because you are safe
behind a terminal 1,000+ klicks from whomever you\'re debating doesn\'t give
you the right to be nasty to them.

Granted, it\'s not as bad as on some lists I\'ve made the mistake of joining
for a time, like Champions ("You are such a loooser, fart-face!"), but I
honestly expect a lot more from this list.  It\'s a (generally) older, well
educated crowd, with a passion for the greatest science fiction rpg universe
out there.  I don\'t think the passion is to blame for the insensitivity,
though.  I think it\'s just plain old thoughtlessness.

This is a game, and these are opinions.  It may not be canon, the equations
may be off, it might be a misquote, or a terrible interpretation of the
rules, but everyone on this list deserves courtesy, and to be treated with
civility.

Do you understand what we\'re talking about here? If not I\'ll fill you in:
If I have a certain hexscale and use past->present->future markers to
depict my ships location and speed what turnlength should I use if I want a
1 hex velocity change represent 1G of acceleration?

If you suggest that we should have separate markers depicting ships speed
and location please go ahead and post a system that works with that but I\'m
interested in the normal Mayday/BattleRider system and there unfortunately
distance = acceleration * time^2 has to be used because we\'re not
integrating over time as in distance = 1/2 * acceleration * time^2 but
sampling at regular intervals called gameturns.

Lets compare the two formulae and set acceleration(a) = 2.0, turnlength(t)
= 1.0 for convenience
(1) d = 1/2 * a * t^2
(2) d = a * t^2
Lets look at a ship that is constantly accelerating over a number of turns
and see:
Turn    (1)             (2)             Reality
===============================================
1       1               2               1
2       1+2=3           6               4
3       3+3=6           12              9
4       6+4=10          20              16
5       10+5=15         30              25
6       15+6=21         42              36 etc

Can you see that (2) approaches Reality as the number of simulated turns
increase and that (1)
approaces 1/2 * Reality. Thus my statement that if the game should only
play for 1 gameturns
use (1) if there are suppoesed to be more than 1 gameturn of maneuvering
use (2).

Hm...ok, I fail to understand what you\'re talking about with
past/present/future markers.  30 minute (really, 29 minute) turns are fine if
you want 1 turn of acceleration to give you a velocity of 1 hex/turn --
unfortunately, that turn of acceleration will only move you half a hex.  If you
want 1 turn of acceleration to move you one hex, use 41 minute turns, but after
accelerating for one turn you will _move_ one hex -- but if you then shut off
your drives the next (and subsequent) turns you will move 2 hexes.  This may
not be easy to represent on a mapboard.

I need to correct myself here - the bottom TL for a normal-space navy is

IMTU - The Imperium *does* supply system defense and anti-piracy patrols.
However, those patrols and SDB personnel are directly proportional to the
political clout of the Imperial nobility of that world.  A good measure of
it\'s political clout will be in what it supplies to the sector - a world
like Treece (Starport D, TL - 8 Trade Code of Po) will not have a lot of
clout.  It\'s population is somewhat ambigious - Pop 8 is a fairly high
concentration, and I must assume that the conditions that brought about
the Captive Government code may have contributed to it\'s rather mediocre
industrial development.  Because the system is not able to support and
maintain a permanently based SDB force, there will undoubtably be patrol
forces in the system.    Where those forces will be, what their readiness
status will be, and how effective they can be is a GM determination.   If
the patrol is going to be in the system for an extended period (several
months), they are seconded to the System Count (the System Count is the
nominal commander of System Defence Forces).

A system may also develop it\'s own System Defense, under the command of
the System Count (so I guess all SD forces are technically Imperial....)
These forces would be based on the local system\'s ability to produce and
maintain - or to purchase locally (i.e. subsector-wide).  The advantage to
a system building it\'s own SD force is that even if it is Imperialized
during emergencies, without J-Drives they probably are not going to go
anywhere.  The downside is that  the cost of this force is absorbed
totally by the world (although in some cases, especially in world with a
lot of clout, this can be negotiated), the world must still make it\'s
Imperial contribution.

However, remember that any forces that are developed will not be 100%
available.  Ships will be down for maintenance or crew leave; out on
patrols, resource development, search and rescue; on station in gas giants
and asteroid/planetoid belts on silent lurk duty, etc....

  What about disposal of excess Imperial craft? A century old TL13
gunboat with the J-drives removed might be adequate (or TL-any if
removed from a Colonial inventory).

  Opinion is still divided on whether the Imperium routinely owns/
controls mainworld starports. Unless it becomes important it may
be best left unaddressed.

  No, but the pro\'s and con\'s of each need to be considered.
Obviously, the pirates want to make a (good) living, and probably
retire before the odds catch up with them.

  It also becomes much easier to make a living with legitimate cargo,
_if you do it in a non-compliant jurisdiction_. Leave the Imperium.
Otherwise you risk both the ship and yourself every day.

  Well, this has been flogged a bit, but the issue comes down to
economics and game theory. It\'s much better for an individual pirate
to capture ships and quit the business than to play Russian roulette
indefinitely. Of course, individual encounters could quite easily go
down just that way.

There\'s a side issue as to the fenced value of an average Dt of cargo.

>Besides, it\'s far easier to disguise the origin of several tons of 
>(most kinds of) cargo than it is to disguise a starship.

  Yep.

  Well, yes. But how do you ID a better armed merchant before engaging?
Also, such a pseudo-warship will be pretty easily identified from its\'
performance envelope and operations profile. Unless it\'s an exceedingly
well documented yacht, any authorities are going to be very suspicious
upon encountering it.

  Pirate rings and bases (substantial ones, anyway) become very
questionable; economics again, and encounter probabilities. They\'ve
got one thing only (crime) to make money at, their mobility (_if_
needed) is sharply reduced, and a single patrol ship vs pirate
(or infiltrator/turncoat) can now plug the entire operation.

  IMO, the most survivable source of pirate activity is the casual;
a (canonically) armed trader, who comes across a great opportunity
when he\'s desperate (or frankly, he\'s a scumbag) and takes the easy
way out. Maybe he\'s sure he didn\'t leave a trail, maybe they run for
the border. Maybe something goes wrong.

Exactly :-) This is I think an often missed point. There is going to be
quite alot of old beaten up ships out there, that are in use by poor
worlds, merchants and pirates. Not every ship meet will be a state of the
art, newly buildt vessel IMO.

Well, not exactly.  Let\'s set up the playing surface, using the Sun 
as the star and Mercury for the pirate base, using 30 Mm hexes from 
Brilliant Lances.  The photosphere of the Sun (a G2V star) has a 
diameter of 1390 Mm (46 hexes); meson gun fire through the Sun would
be at extreme range, even if both ships were right above the surface
(and the mesons really could go through).  Mercury orbits 57900 Mm
(1930 hexes) fron the Sun, and fits in one hex.

It\'d be nice if you could jump in; Mercury\'s 100-diameter limit is
at 16 hexes, and a 6G ship dropping out of jump with a vector of 10
could be on the ground in about 60 minutes.  Unfortunately, the
Sun\'s 100-diameter limit is at 4630 hexes from Sol, 2700 hexes past
Mercury\'s orbit.  A 6G ship with unlimited fuel that exits jump 
there with a vector of *180* (0.01c) could brake all the way and 
land in about 15 hours.  (Obviously, this won\'t work for HEPlaR.)
Either way, your bright exhaust will be pointed at them for a long
time.

Basically, it\'s tricky to set up a scenario like this.  You might
get some benefit if you can put the star to your back, but that\'d
be interesting to arrange, too.  Using moons as cover, however, is
a lot more feasible....

I don\'t think anyone has ever complained about anyone\'s site.. although
loren did call the Silly Era "alleged" humor..  If you are going to take

Actually, Hans, the price of ships varies between editions; sometimes
drastically. Which pricing scheme you use sets value of starcraft. IE, cost
variance of Type S at TLs 12-15 via MT is 50-70 MCr by designing it, right
about 30 listed in MTIE, and varies again with every differing system for
designing craft. The ammounts of fress space also vary, as each different
system for design has different useage assumptions to one degree or
another. so, while pricing of ships may be Canon, it is not a single canon
at all.

Hans implied in a post that all ships exit jump ONLY AT the 100 diameter
limit. My interpretation of the rules is that a ship exits jump NO CLOSER
THAN 100 diameters. This is a major difference. My support for this comes
from the MT Misjhump rules, which include spatial errors in misjump, which
put you hours or even days from the target, but in the target system.

Similar exists under TNE. Especially the RSB\'s Calibration Points.

So, if an error can put you out  without forcing you against the edge of a
gravity well, why can you not choose to drop out beyond that limit?

Also, if normal jump exit requires exiting against the gravity well, the
canonical ability to jump to "Empty Hexes" becomes erroneous except via
misjump.

Similarly, unnder TNE, you can set jump coordinates so your vector will
allow you minimal burns to orbit (Bingo Jump). I can see cases where this
would require more than 100 diameters out.

The assumption being made is that a pirate has to make money (or at least
break even) -- not lose it. The anti-piracy view is that due to many
factors, piracy as a career would not be financially viable within the
bounds of a stable 3I setting, nor would it be conductive to the health of
the would-be pirate.

These factors have been disputed, and include (but are probably not limited to):

1) The effectiveness of sensors.
2) The range of starship weapons.
3) The actual volume of space where a potential target
   will be.
4) The ability of the Imperium to patrol this volume of
   space (i.e., the Imperium\'s industrial capacity).
5) The will of the Imperium to patrol this volume.
6) The ability of merchants to arm themselves.
7) The ability of merchants to hire armed escort.
8) The value of starships and the cost of starship
   maintenance (and repair) compared to the income
   gained by piracy (i.e., cargo or ships).

I am certain there are more.

I do not think there is an argument about the occurance of piracy in M0,
Rebellion, Hard Times, or post-Virus settings. Nor do I think there is an
argument against subsidized acts of piracy (i.e., privateers, star mercs,
and what have you).

An itemized list addressing such factors would be welcome, IMHO.
Personally, I think the "piracy-wouldn\'t-happen" camp has done a much
better job of doing this then "piracy-could-happen camp." Of course, this
may be due to bias (or my bias may be due to this). ;-)

You forgot Love Field and Alliance Airport.
But you might want to factor in that DFW is an American Airlines
hub, (and Love is a Southwest hub), which forces many people
there who don\'t actually want to go through the airport, since the
airlines route through Dallas because they want to, i.e., a direct
flight to where such passengers want to go isn\'t economically worth it.

Actually, I was referring to using the star at your back but you bring 
up some interesting points.  I would not expect to arrive undetected, 
but possibly surprise and reduce the amount of reaction time available.  
Scenarios would definitely be limited.

Some people would say that sensible people don\'t decide on a life

That\'s why you don\'t encounter the authorities with this ship - that\'s what
your pirate syndicate maintains cargo transfer points and legal-looking
free traders for. As I mentioned earlier, it\'s much harder if the way
jump exit works IYTU makes it impossible to jump into a system 
without being detected. 

As for IDing a better-armed merchant - if it looks like a 400-dtn 
Fat Trader, it probably is a 400-dtn Fat Trader. The vast majority
of these will have armament you can handle - if you run into an
upgunned version, you break off and try to break system patrol
detection - if you can\'t, you jump. If you can\'t jump, you make 
interesting copy for the local newsfaxes. The life of a pirate is 
short.

If you are detected coming in-system, you need the ability to look
harmless until your passive sensor arrays tell you the situation is
good: a merchanter within your interception envelope while it\'s
outside patrol ship interception envelopes. Of course there\'s a chance
an SDB lying doggo will surprise you, but many a terran merchantman
has been saved by the timely appearance of a friendly frigate over
the horizon in the age of sail - as I mentioned, pirates will be risk-takers.

Steve again:

  Pirate rings and bases (substantial ones, anyway) become very
questionable; economics again, and encounter probabilities. They\'ve

(or infiltrator/turncoat) can now plug the entire operation.

Several easily-abandoned bases instead of one big one, then - and many

Piracy + kidnap ransom + smuggling + extortion - you can make a pretty
good living if you\'r creative and ruthless enough.

Steve again

  IMO, the most survivable source of pirate activity is the casual;
a (canonically) armed trader, who comes across a great opportunity
when he\'s desperate (or frankly, he\'s a scumbag) and takes the easy

the border. Maybe something goes wrong.

These would exist anyway - Merchant Prince indicates that
anyone on a Free Trader will be an occaisional pirate/smuggler/etc.
I think that the "Pirate/Corsair" career in MT/TNE/CotI indicates

Of course, any pirate showing his ship at a type-A starport system
deserves what he gets.... :)

The point of piracy as a minor irritant is that chances
of getting caught will be enough to deter enough people
from the crime that is will not happen very often.  Thus
I would diagree with "little chance of getting caught".

No _sure_ way.  If a ship doesn\'t have a good explination,
or claims to be from Regina, but the patrol ships just
came from there and it is clear the captain has not
idea what just happened there, etc. they might get
caught, they make a mistake when they report the
ship\'s ID (ships made in 994 all had _9_ digit
IDs) and other forgery type mistakes.  I would just
treat is as a contest between the interrogator and
the interrogatee.

Make it stop?  A member world actually supporting piracy
is a pretty blatant act.  If there is a pirate base on

Yeah, I\'m guessing that ships transiting from outside
Imperium space are treated differently.  I haven\'t
thought much about boarder restrictions, but travelling
to a world within Jump-6 of the border might be different.
Anyway, I\'m not saying that stopping nukes at the source
is easy, it just that searching every ship in a way
that you can reasonably expect to find them is almost
impossible and still doesn\'t stop nukes from being
used on the worlds where they were made..

    'body' => 'Hi.

Has anybody got any suggestions on how I could make the following
scenario work?

Basically, I want a way to make a large explosion on a merchant ship
look like an accident. The plot goes as follows :
Two characters (brothers) run a freighter between them. One of the
brothers is involved with organised crime (possibly in debt, or stole
something from the crime boss, haven\'t worked that out yet). The crime
boss wants to kidnap the \'criminal\' brother, and use this as leverage
to force the other \'good\' brother to do various illegal runs in the
freighter. As an additional inducement, a bomb will be placed on the
ship, and it\'s presence will be revealed to the \'good\' brother as a
trump card if necessary. That\'s the plan. However, what is going to
happen is that the \'criminal\' brother will be kidnapped, but then the
bomb will explode while being placed on the ship. This takes place in
(on?) a highport, and security logs show someone going on to the ship,
using the \'criminal\' brothers ID (there will not be enough detail to
show exactly who the person is on the log, though). So, the \'good\'
brother (and the authorities) will think the \'criminal\' brother has
been killed in the explosion, whereas in fact the crime boss is now
desperately wondering what to do with him. Mucho hijinks follows as
the \'good\' brother finds out whats going on and rescues brother with
the help of a few friends, while the crime boss tries to recover the
stolen item.

So, how can a large explosion be produced, preferably destroying the
ship and a decent chunk of the highport, which will still look like an
accident? Can a fusion plant be made to explode somehow? Or is it
going to have be a dodgy cargo that\'s reposonsible? Possibly a \'small\'
explosion is more likely that triggers a volatile cargo?

Any help would be much appreciated : )

Rob.

Actually, I think you often no at least one direction where the enemy
is not likely to be.  But even if you didn\'t, if you beam is tight
enough the odds of an enemy picking you up can one in a thousand
(or worse).

Yeah, you have to put more out.  But if you are masked by, say, the
cosmic
background, or you are in the absorption band for hydrogen, you are way
ahead.

Because merchants don\'t like having to wait a week because
there isn\'t a ship going to where they want to go?  Or loose
out on a cargo that wants to be shipped today?  So they
just go to a competator and pay slightly higher insurance

this provision?

Urk.  For some reason, I read that the other way around.  (Maybe because
I\'ve heard the "what if we sneak up from behind the star?" question so
often!)  Anyway, most of that is still relevant.  :)

Well concidering all the jump fuel, a ship is virtually a bomb in itself.
Since it costs 2000 Cr per trip per person to restock a ship, that\'s going
to include lots of fresh oxygen in high pressure tanks, which are virtual
bombs in themselves.  Then  there are computer glitches, radiation shield
collapses, fusion core melt downs... Proving it to be something other than
an accident would be difficult at best.

Desires and expectations can often be out of whack with
reality.  I was watching a show that talked about the
lifesytle of pirates raiding shiping coming out of the
Spanish New World.  They looked at a record of what
they were capturing and there wasn\'t much gold and
silver in it.  It was a lot a routine stuff and they
were far from getting rich.

use the universal gravity law, I don\'t remember it off the top of my

If the rotational velocity of the star is larger than the impact
velocity, then the two will merge and after a few weeks form a new star
with a composite mass of the star and the gas giant.  If not, you\'re
looking at a big mess...

Respectfully, I must disagree.

I think a more accurate representation would be a seaport in the late
1800\'s or early 1900\'s, when commerce depended on ship traffic to flow.
This would more accurately simulate not only the cost of travel - High
or Mid passage on a starship represents a considerable sum as opposed to
an airline ticket which is fairly inexpensive.  It also relates to the
relative inconvience of travel, when such travel takes days or weeks,
not hours.

Using the US Military as a base.  Retirement after 20 years is 50% of
base pay.  In Traveller, that means that a senior military person earns
about cr 8,000 in base pay per year.  As an E-6, I pulled in about 30K,
but about 10K of that was benefits, not base pay.  To be generous, let\'s
figure about a 1:3 ratio.  That means in US dollars, Mid-Passage would
be about $24,000 and Hi-Passage would be about $30,000.  Cross Atlantic
passage on the new Titanic is being bandied from anywhere around $10,000
to $100,000 - so these figures may be a bit on the low side, but
workable.

A cross country (US) ticket, depending on the market, can range from $99
to $1,000.

What I\'m trying to point out is that you are comparing Apples to
Oranges.  Using air traffic, because it is the highest TL we have
available, is not an accurate representation.  Especially when you
consider that travel costs in a starship represent months or years of
income for the average individual, when air traffic represents weeks, or
even hours of income.

Vilis subsector has Vilis - 8 billion people at TL10.

Jewell subsector has Jewell - 6 billion people at TL12.

Lunion subsector has Strouden (9 billion people at TL14) and Lunion (8
billion people at TL13).

Assume a security budget of Cr 2 per head per annum and we have an annual
budget of 62 billion credits, split evenly between TL14 and TL10. This buys
a lot of piracy suppression, including paying Ihetai and/or Vargr to do a
job on any world outside the frontiers that is supporting piracy.

As far as I see it, the conditions are 

(1) No Navy around
(2) a freeport to sell cargos and repair at
(3) low variability in combat capability of similar looking ships
(4) small paper trail for legitimate merchants and cargoes.

Assuming a merchant ship is only worth MCr 50 with cargo is actually an
assumption that I\'m willing to drop. For example, imagine a Far Trader
packed to the gills with Fission plants - it\'s a cargo worth about MCr100,
so the unit is worth closer to MCr 130. \'Vanilla\' Traveller cargo values
are too low to fit with the things you can buy in Traveller.

If starship captains regularily carry around a megacredit in cash (not
impossible if they are buying specualtive cargoes in 100t lots), then
\'spaceborne mugging\' via small boats starts to look more reasonable. I
built a 2 dton hi-gee shuttle for around KCr 400 last night at TL14, and
about half of that was the AEMS system.

The other thing I should have dug up was the Sydney Morning Herald article
about the troubles inter-island shipping is going through in Indonesia
right now. One of the free trader captains interviews said that piracy had
become a real problem.

Now, this is more because a previously stable system had dropped into Hard
Times (his bigger complaint was actually extortion by the military on
anti-pirate duty), but it shows that where you have little attention being
paid by the authorities then things which are otherwise objectivly
impossible can happen.

Now, the conditions that normally make piracy unprofitable (being near a
sensor that sees out to the 100 diameter limit, being within the response
range of system defenses, having lots of paperwork around about who went
where and when etc) dont apply in asteroid belts. You have a bunch of
low-paperwork spaceships, many without Jump capability, spread over the
system. You have a reputation for lawlessness, and a possible tendency not
to ask questions if presented with the opportunity to buy a cheap, slightly
damaged Seeker.

I can imagine in these cases institutionilised laziness and (perhaps)
corruption in the Navy, that winks at this and has the attitide that it\'s
OK, if it doesnt spill outside the Belt.

I think the Traveller equivalent would be the intruder force jumping to a
gas giant to refuel, and then dealing with the system forces at the
mainworld. This maximises your chances of successfully retreating, but
gives the defense time to react.

The second equivalent would be jumping so that you still had fuel in your
tanks for an ememrgentcy jump - building jump-3 ships that carry a jump-3
plus a jump-1 \'emergency jump reserve\'. If forced to retreat, they jump to
a pre-arranged retreat point (possibly in deep space).

Jae Tellona has 900,000 inhabitants, and it\'s got 310,000 
passengers _per week_???? Even in and out, does that mean 
150,000 tourists land on the planet every week, and another 
150,000 leave? If the average stay is 6 weeks then there 
aren\'t any actual permanent inhabitants.

If the 900,000 is permanent inhabitants, then its trade 
revenue is 3111Cr per capita per week, or ~160,000 per year 
per person on the planet. I bet that 310,000 is immigration 
to a place with a higher standard of living.

I find your trade numbers implausible, despite having some 
large pop worlds nearby.

Part of the problem with this is Traveller sensors easily detect ships out
beyond the 100 diameter limits. Pirating outgoing ships has the problem of
their jumping within the 100 diameter limit rather than trust out pirate\'s
promise to let them live. Pirating incoming ships has the problem of
reactions from the world you are hanging around.

You can fit maybe 12 people and maybe 10 dtons of cargo into a type S. I\'d
use a Far Trader myself.

Yes. Especially as ships jumping in will be out of jump fuel.

Hmmm. On the other hand, imagine a group of PCs that have information on
the location of such a base. Rather than informing the Navy, they try and
scrape together a private military force to take it themselves, then
collect the pirate ships as they arrive ... even if you have to give the
captured ships back to their legitimate owners, any actual pirate ships
should be fair game.

Some designs have claimed you can put 2 mid passrengers in a small
stateroom. I think it should be possible, but you should have lower
passenger costs (1st, 2nd and 3rd class passengers - maybe even 4th class
hot bunking in bunks).

There is still the problem that you get net KCr 6 revenue from a small
stateroom, compared to KCr 2 net from freight.

  I would assume that only the absolutely largest corps would be worth 
the Imperiums notice (given the lack of a pervasive bureaucracy), and
that they may only be regulated, not taxed.

  I tend to assume that the Imperiums taxes are collected locally based
on a central (flat rate?) assessment; to do otherwise is to encourage
political tension with an anti-Imperium bias - a Bad Thing. What lower
echelons do to themselves is, naturally (literally in a feudal system),
their own concern.

  It does make things fun. It also implies interesting things about the
Colonial fleets, which raises the possibility that core worlds (with
fewer threats and reduced inclination to raise large colonial forces)
may be assessed at a higher weighting to the fringes, which latter are
the glacis of the state, after all.

  Sure. But very few pirates are going to stay illegal (or actually
wait for a safe hit) once they realize that the rest of the time
that means parking on jerk-water worlds roasting wild cattle on
iron grills. Unless of course they\'re really Space Vikings and are
into chicken stealing.

  Buccaneering sounds romantic, but unless it starts to pay they
might think about different career options.

  What if the authorities or fate disagree? If ID\'ing a ship is quite
hard (see current telescope resolution thread) then how do you know
that new arrival isn\'t heavily armed or a patrol boat? Such a ship
(expensive, purpose built?) can\'t function except as a hostile warship;
no conventional revenue stream is possible, nor is "swim with the fishes"
intrusion survivable.

  A pirate syndicate starts to imply massive capitalization and an
impressive organization. How this would establish itself without the
assistance of an outside party (thus leaving the definition of piracy
behind and becoming commerce raiders) is difficult to see.

  Such events may occur very rarely, but it lacks credibility as
the common model for piracy.

  My point would be that large organizations are ultimately less economic
and more vulnerable. In addition they\'re much more likely to trigger a
response that will almost guarantee their liquidation.

  Part of the problem is that the extremely burdensome cost of bases
is one of the main points against widespread use of SDB\'s, fighters,
or even patrol ships against piracy. Whether this is so is subject
to debate. Presumably these bases (disposable or not) are not huge
capital or operations outlays.

  Why not sell the first ship you capture and avoid the stress? I\'m
assuming rational/economic behaviour here; I frankly doubt that a 
band of psychopaths will last very long.

  As much fun as they might be, it gets very strange if rule system
artifacts start being assigned as background facts - whether the TCS
Cr 500 per capita naval budget or the suggestion that ~17% of the
population of the Imperium were ex-Scouts.

 i) That presumes a very low traffic pattern; as previously stated,
this is by defintion a low probability concern.
ii) So, you take the cargo and run. It happens. I guess you\'re getting
paid enough to make up for not being able to carry passengers.
iii) Again, if insurance rates are only slightly higher then it
effectively proves that the risk of loss is quite minimal.
iv) sending a letter (e-mail?) to the next system is expensive?

  My estimate of the potential gains compared to the minimal risks
presented by your hypothetical security regime is that the level
of piracy (etc.) it allows will be vastly above the "irritant"
level. This may work for some, but unless I\'ve fundamentally erred
in assessing what I\'ve read here, I couldn\'t apply this material to
my own game without serious credibility/realism problems. YMMV.

  The above sounds like an impossible situation for law enforcement
units to accomplish anything. No records are cross-checked, no black
boxes exist to be inspected occasionally, ship licensing is minimal,
personnel, manifests, and passenger registers are not maintained or
cross-checked. I\'m surprised that any bank would loan money to any
private individual(s) to throw away money on what is after all a 
getaway car.

  It\'s sort of worse than that, because an organization operating
from outside the Imperium (OK, not pirates per se, but a clear
threat to security) can simply pump the stuff through a sanitized
cordon by pre-positioning fuel dumps for couriers to run to while
hopping in a further stage; J-3 scouts being fed by Type A/A2 ships
could easily penetrate a sector, given the value of all the goodies
that can be packed into a couple of hundred cubic meters.

  The Imperium doesn\'t have the ability to stop you from nuking
yourself (in planetary terms). The winner/survivor will discover
that the Imperium does, however, specialize in _making you regret_
_having done so_.

  Finding nukes on ships crossing Imperial space is practical.
Nuclear dampers, rad counters, and (if allowed) deep radar all
have applications. Inspecting physically can lead to neat things
like finding missiles w/o warheads, at which point you strip the
ship down to the bulkheads or simply play musical chairs.

  Inspections (cursory/external or on-site) can be done at starports,
or when boarded for whatever reason. From the internal security POV,
it is not necessary to check all ships at all times. It is merely
needful to check (~) all ships once in a while - any ship whose
lifestyle is fundamentally illegal is thus subject to eventual serious
risk of detention/confiscation/really short exchange of fire.

I\'ve been thinking about this one, why are ships that use thrusters also 
equipped with CG? I think the answer is in how they work. A CG drive works by 
pushing against the local gravity well. Thus a 1g CG drive will always produce 1 
local g of thrust, if the local gravity is 2 standard g\'s then the 1g CG drive will 
produce 2g\'s of thrust, if the local gravity is 0.2g then the 1g CG will produce 
0.2g\'s of thrust. However a Thruster works against the underlying gravity of the 
universe; thus a 1g Thruster will always produce 1 standard g of thrust 
regardless of the local gravity. Therefore, ships which lack lifting surfaces (non-
airframes) have CG in order to ensure that they can land in any gravity well. An 
airframe hull OTOH generates lift in an atmosphere and therefore can go 
without the CG.

I\'ve always ruled that any paying passenger (high or middle) will only travel in a

That may be true, but consider, isn\'t it also true of bank 
robbers?  

Bank robbers get caught a lot, on average they don\'t make a 
lot of money, and a few of them end up dead. Rationally 
you\'d expect that they\'d give it up as a bad scheme, right? 
Then why are there still bank robbers?

Some theories-
i) Bad evaluation of risk. The Potential criminal doesn\'t 
believe it to be as dangerous as it is.

ii) Bad evaluation of reward, the potential criminal 
believes that there is more money to be made than there 
actually is.

iii) An inability to make money legally. Perhaps the 
potential criminal is incompetant, or can\'t make the 
payments and skips, and thus can\'t get legal cargos, and 
has to stop using highly documented worlds. Perhaps they 
have expensive habits, or they don\'t know how to get a job 
as anything else. Maybe they\'ve been working their butts 
off and are still broke paying a mortgage, three sets of 
alimony, and the repo man is trying to take back the car - 
they Need Money Now, and they don\'t have a legal way of 
getting it.

Hannibal Lector aside, there aren\'t a lot of smart 
criminals out there, and there are a _lot_ of dumb ones. 

Now consider that there is a lot of time and money put into 
catching or stopping bank robbers. Whole industries of Bank 
guards. The police put a lot of time into catching them. 
With modern forensics they can\'t afford to leave even the 
slightest clue. Yet they still try, they still get to take 
some money, and some of them do get away. Surely it is more 
than an irritation, otherwise there wouldn\'t be all that 
money paid to people to stand around banks looking like 
guards, yet it hasn\'t been completely shut down yet...

Ok, being higher in a gravity well is an advantage. Especially at TLs
where you are using reaction drives. Consider the case of two ships
equal in all ways, but one is in a far orbit, the other is in a close
orbit. The planet blocks more of your sensors, you have to fire
"uphill" (especially bad for missiles). And since your orbit moves you
around the planet faster, it\'s harder to keep distant objects under
observation. 

Velocity (or lack thereof) relative to the other ship, or some
important place (like the 100 diameter limit). A ship moving quickly
towards the 100 diameter limit (if trying to escape by jumping) or
towards the port, will have an advantage over a ship that\'s at rest. At
if the would-be attacker is moving in the opposite direction, it\'s even
worse. 

How close your vectors match is *far* more important than range, as
long as you are going to be in range at all. Heck, if you are heading
at the jump point fast enough, and the attacker is going in some other
direction, it\'s not at all unlikely that you can *coast* to it before
he can an intercept. 

If you don\'t have a copy of Mayday, get one. Or a copy of the CT rules.
Play with vector movement for a while and you\'ll begin to get the idea.
Intercepting somebody in space is *hard*. Best case for the attacker is
to be moving in the same general direction at a similar velocity (too
fast means you shoot past and have to backtrack).

Which is why pilots get *real* suspicious of folks on "matching"
courses, given how much space there is available. Even if you are both
going to jump to the same system, you can still do just fine from
points quite a ways apart. 

The thing that always surprises beginners is that it does you no good
to shoot up a ship if you can\'t rendevous with it to get the cargo off.
Whereas the defender merely has to keep you from rendevousing with him
until he gets under cover or can jump. And *he* doesn\'t care if he
blows you into little pieces. 

Obviously, in warfare, both sides can do the "blowing into little
pieces" bit so matching courses aren\'t quite as important. They\'re
still fairly important though, as otherwise combat turns into a series
of passes at high speed, followed by hours of manuevering to get on an
intercept course again.

It\'s a "simple" orbit calculation. Pretend for a moment that both the
star and the GG are dimensiomless points, but have all their mass.
Obviously they\'d fall towards each other along a straight line. And
since the star is so much more massive, it won\'t move much.

So from the point of view of the star , the GG would move
towards it in a straight line. But once it gets there it\'s moving
really fast (remember we are pretending that they are point masses).
So it whips around the point and winds up going back the way it came.
And it slows as it goes until it comes to a stop at the point it
strated. And the cycle repeats. 

Ok, So the "natural orbit" for the GG is a straight line from the
starting point to the center of the star. This is the limiting case of
an elliptical orbit. It\'s an "ellipse" with an eccentricity of 1
(IIRC). 

The rule for elliptical orbits is that the period is determined by the
length of the semimajor axis. In this case, that\'s half the distance
between the centers of the objects. And the GG only gets to complete
half an orbit (it falls in, but not back out). 

So the time to impact is a bit less than the time a planet at half the
distance takes to complete half an orbit. (really!). This depends on
the combined mass of the bodies, but the GG\'s mass is gonna be fairly
insignificant. 

T=pi/(Sqrt(8*G*M/r^3))

M= mass of star and GG in kg
G= 6.673e-11 N m^2/kg^2 (7e-11) -- Newton\'s Gravitational Constant
r= starting distance between centers in meters
T= time in seconds

The velocity at any point is the stellar escape velocity at the point
the GG started, minus the stellar escape velocity at the current
distance. 

 V = sqrt(2*M*G/r)-sqrt(2*M*G/d)

M= mass of star and GG in kg
G= 6.673e-11 N m^2/kg^2 (7e-11) -- Newton\'s Gravitational Constant
r= starting distance between centers in meters
d= current distance in meters

> b. what will happen when it does.

Interesting question. The answer would likely be worth a Nobel prize.

You are going to be adding the kinetic energy of the GG to the star.
That\'s a lot, stars are pretty energetic to start with.

Unless it\'s a very small star, you won\'t be adding a lot of mass to it.
Stars are *big*.

Long term, the star would be brighter. And it might even wind up a
periodic variable over the shorter term.

The really short term (say up to a century after the collision) is the
hard part. 

But the slug of plasma that used to be the GG is going to penetrate a
ways. How far depends on details of stellar interiors that I dobn\'t
know (and that I\'d be at least a bit surprised if *anyone* has more
than guesses about). It may result in a moderate amount of mixing of
layers that don\'t ordinarily mix (we aren\'t sure where convection
occurs inside stars and where it doesn\'t). 

It\'s possible that the mixing could temporaily shut down the fusion
reactions at the core of the star (no big deal, it takes the energy
decades to work its way out). They\'d resume after things settled down.

It\'s also possible (but I don\'t think it\'s likely) that if the star a
red giant sufficiently far along, you\'d trigger a supernova early. But
by the time a star is that old, it\'s already done a number on the
planets that might have been habitable when it was younger and the
expansion happens way to fast for life to develop on the newly warm
planets. So any casualties would have to be a base on a not very
habitable planet.

I\'d guess that we\'d get some *massive* flare activity, regardless of the
star type. But that\'s just a guess. And you *definitely* wouldn\'t want
to be anywhere near the star on the side that got hit.

On the other hand, if approaching system patrol craft are a problem,
then you aren\'t likely to be able to disable the merhant quickly enough
*anyway*. Not unless you\'ve got some way f getting *really* close
un-noticed. 

If an approaching patrol *isn\'t* a problem, then you are interested in
the ship if it\'s at all easy to repair. It gives you more ships to work
with.

Which leads to the *big* problem with being a pirate. Annual
maintenance. In the days of sail, the ship\'screw could do any
maintenance needed short of a major catastrophe. And they could do it
on their own. At worst they needed to lay in a supply of lumber at
their base.

But what\'s a pirate in the Imperium going to do? He not only needs to
be able to sell his cargoes, he needs to be able to buy ordinance, and
get battle damage repaired. And the annual maintenance is a killer.
Because as you note, he\'s likely to be *known* by then. So he needs a
Class B port that doesn\'t *care* that he\'s a pirate. 

That\'s why folks suggest privateers. They can just visit a port of the
government that commisioned them.

Actually, since we\'ve already established that it\'s best to avoid
systems with a decent patrol, it\'s time to start looking for places
that won\'t have a patrol, but might have good cargoes slipping thru. 

To use Norton\'s Solar Queen stories as an example, say a Free Trader
has a deal with the natives on a planet for some rare plant or maybe
some sort of gemstones. It doesn\'t do *you* any good to land there and
try to trade, they won\'t deal with you. And a raid only works if you
can find where they store the stuff between visits by the trader. You
can\'t try to find some yourself because you don\'t know where to find
it. So you lie in wait for the trader. Either you catch him on the
ground after the trade goods are out of hiding, or you try to catch him
soon after takeoff. So you find a good hiding place on the planet (or
maybe a moon) and wait with your emissions as low as you can manage.

There are other similar scenarios. The key to this kind of thing is
that you are operating in a system where the natives don\'t have much
(if any) space presence (low TL) and where there\'s a valuable
commodity, but there\'s also a reason for limited trade. So hijaacking a
ship is possible, and it\'s worthwhile. 

There ought to be a *lot* of planets like this on the fringes of an
expanding empire. Close enough to trade with, but still outside the
borders. And producing something exotic or *really* valuable.

Hell, you want to know what one of the most expensive *legal* materials
is? Saffron. Check the price at your store. It\'s sold by the *gram*. 

Picture somebody with a deal for some similar spice. It\'s something
that takes a lot of work to obtain or concentrate (saffron is the
*pollen* of a plant). And it\'s valuable. A shipload of it could let you
retire. Even just one cargo pod of it would be lots of money.

Or you need a port that doesn\'t care that you are a pirate (several
such existed during the height of piracy in the age of sail) or one
that considers you to be on "their" side (ie a privateer).

Heinlein\'s "Citizen of the Galaxy" has some good lessons on this buried
in it. He realized just what it\'d take to get piracy to work in a
starfaring civilization. And you find out as part of the story\'s
background unfolds.

Unless he\'s a privateer for the Imperium and they are just inspecting
to make sure that he hasn\'t violated the terms of his letters of marque
and reprisal. (Of course, that *could* be a nightmare too. :-)

For that matter, he\'s got to worry about his "friends" deciding that
he\'s an easier mark than a merchie.

Are you talking of space navigation or planetary navigation. I don\'t see
why you need active sensors for space navigation, and for planetary
navigation these sensors are included in the controls and
terrain-following equipment (if I remeber FF&S right :-)

Is this from FF&S or your take on CG. I guess this is something that
should be discussed, as I really see it different. But then again I like
CG to really be contra grav, not providing thrust at all, but cutting the
"gravitons" from interacting between the to masses, and therefor cutting
the gravitational pull. A 1G CG will therefor keep 1G of gravitons from
interacting, while a 2G CG will keep away 2Gs worth of gravitastion (all
well inside gravityweels that is.

This is something I have been thinking of. While an average citizen of the
Imperium makes about the same in a year as it cost for a ticket, how many
have considerable better income than the average. Using real world numbers
I think the average income on Earth is about 10000$, probably much lower,
and still there is certainly nearly a billion people that make much, much
more than that. Relating this to Traveller I really think that startravel
in the Imperium is like airtravel today for the people of relativly
wealthy and high-tech worlds.

But what is an average individual. In the world today an average income
person is very poor compared to most Europeans or Americans. On an average
the GDP per citizen in China is 2800$ which means that for one fifth of
the world an airline thicket is half their purchase power in a year.
For India the number is 1600$ per capita, which means that overall there
is at least half of the citizens on earth for whom you statement is
incorrect. Realate this to Traveller and there will be a large amount of
people that has incomes significantly over the 8.000Cr needed for
startravel.

I\'ve been sitting on my haunches while reading this discussion of the
commerce capabilities of these two worlds.  

I had some comments when the discussion of developing economics based upon
starport activities but I never wrote them down and I now find that I just
have to put my two credits worth in.

Robert Eaglestone guesstimated and listed the weekly passenger  (pax) flow
of DFW as 3.5E6 pax.  No, its closer to one tenth that . Based on FAA 1993
data, the annual enplanements, thats the number of people getting on an
aircraft, was 23,656,000  (
http://www.bts.gov/NTL/data/tables/chap04/tab4-11/)  This works out to be
approx 474,000 per week.  I think your pax flow for your commerce
calculations should be divided by a factor 50 to 100.  Just so you have a
rough idea of the enplanements in the US, there were 468 million for 1993,
giving DFW five percent of the overall enplanement activity.

While we are on the subject of flow, all freight listed for airports is in
pounds.  The 1993 US national annual for cargo is 6.4 million pounds and
the annual for mail is 1.8 million pounds.  This is not a lot of air cargo
since it is EXPENSIVE to move cargo.  And remember, aircrews calculate and
balance weight based upon pounds, therefore the consistency.  I\'d like to
see what the railroad moves in cargo and what the major freight carriers
move.  Any one a transportation expert or know a source?

Now let\'s talk about defense squadrons.  First, what milieu are we
developing?  If we look at M10 - M11, specifically the Fifth Frontier War
(FFW), JT does not have any assigned system defense squadrons.  TR has five
SDBs assigned.  Now these facts may be apocripahl and apply only to the FFW
game, but could it be that the Imperial Navy saw fit to reassign JT\'s SDB
squadrons?  Or could they have been eliminated by outside forces?  Or did
JT decide to sink its credits into its own colonial squadron?  If you look
at FFW, none of this seems apparent.  So it could be that JT\'s credits were
transferred to the IN and used there.  Hmm, more questions are sure to
surface.

A great discussion.  Thanks for leeting me drop my two credits in.

Yes. The old books *grossly* underestimate how well *current* sensors
work. If we had current real world sensor gear in use *above* the
atmosphere, we\'d be able to detect ships father than an AU away. 

The old books also grossly underestimate the range of radios. A 5 watt
CB rig is easily good for 20km, and if skip is acting up, can get clear
connections on another continent while not being heard at all 50 km
away.

Forget the fusion plant. All that hardware is required to keep the
"flame" from *going out*. 

Ships use enormous quantities of LH2. And hydrogen mixed with air in
the right proportions *will* explode. That\'s the simplest. Think coal
mine or grain elevator explosion or a gas main explosion. Of course
it\'s much easier to get proportions where the hydrogen just burns. But
the same goes for gas leaks.

On the downside, *because* of this, all ships and highports (and
downports where the port isn\'t "open air") will have sensors all over
the place monitoring for hydrogen leaks. And it is a *bitch* because
the gas can leak right *through* some metals, and makes many metals
brittle. The cold of LH2 also tend to be hard on materials. 

If the ship managed to fill with the right mix of oxygen and hydrogen,
it\'d definitely make a bang. Probably total the ship unless hulls are a
lot stronger than I think.

Heck, that could be how the "bomb" was intended to work in the first
place. So if the ship is somewhat behind on maintaining things, the
port might write it off as a alarm system failure on the ship (and try
to sue the socks off the captain!).

The blast would make a mess of the immediately adjacent portion of the
highport, and pieces of the ship would cause punctures all over the
place.  But without an atmosphere, you don\'t get the blast wave that
carried damage large distances. Details depend on how you lay out the
highport.


Gas explosions are powerful. When I was a kid, a gas leak destroyed a
Safeway store in Spokane. We lived *miles* away and though someone had
thrown something big at the house (being near Halloween, we thought it
might have been a pumpkin). Later we found out what had happened. We
were in the blast *shadow* of a hill. I can only imagine what it was
like below the hill. 

We went to look the next day. The store was a big hole in the ground.
And there were trucks from glass companies all over the place. It\'d
broken windows for something like a mile.

Unless they of course can\'t do that, because of earlier ventures.

This i really dependent on your man-power I think. You might not have the
men to spare for another crew, so you take the cargo and anything else on
the ship that is easily removed (computers, mainboards, vacc-suits, maybe
even the rescue pod or other small craft.)

All he needs is an engineer to fix that which dosn\'t work. I really don\'t
think that the pirate ship will be tip top shape, but it will run
(possibly) when needed. It will be patched up, parts replaced by stolen
goods, refits, refits and refits. A half way decent engineer and this is
definitly possible (at least IMTU).

  Ease of market entry, limited required skill set; you can be
poor, ignorant, and stupid. Those who don\'t fit this profile are
presumably the ones that show up at armoured cars with armfuls
of automatic weapons, steal millions of dollars _and are never
heard of again_.

  Shipowners/operators are going to know better. If they\'re unqualified
(professionally; self-delusion and overoptimism aside) to assess the
above they\'re very unlikely to survive or make money.

  I\'ll concede that some ship\'s masters will be incompetent, but it
is presumably a rare occurrence; it doesn\'t bode well for their
(brief?) career as a pirate. What about the crew? Getting paid late
is a lot less concern than being killed/executed/hunted to ground.

  I agree with the above. Desperate people do desperate things. But if
you luck out and take a ship worth MCr 40, why not try and sell it as
your cashing out maneuver? Once they\'ve mastered their cash problems,
why keep sticking the revolver to their own head?

  One part where the comparison is more valid is in deterrence;
the presence of those (seemingly needless?) forces is actually
serving to keep the rates as low as they are.

To quote a SFPG friend: "Bank robbers don\'t get caught, *repeat* bank
robbers get caught."  He expalined that if someone were smart enough to hit
a bank or armored car just once, and then retire, his chances of getting
away with the crime rise.  When you do it over and over, you establish a
pattern and leave more evidence behind.

The same could be apllied to piracy.  A pirate who strike once, takes the
ship and leaves, then doesn\'t do anything else for months is far less
likely to be hunted down than the guy who tries to hit every week.

Walker Jane Productions is looking for a musician to score its new film
"October".

This is a drama-love story.

Isabella was the one that never was.  She was beautiful, intelligent,
funny, and everything that Conner ever wanted.  She was the girl of his
dreams.

The problem was that Isabella hadn\'t realized that Conner existed--at
least that\'s the way it was back in high school.  But today, 15 years
later, Conner still talks about her.  When all of the guys are standing
around after a party or a poker game, doing the guy-talk thing, Conner
brings her up, wishing that somehow he would run into her again.

And then...he does.  A friend mentions that he\'s seen her.  Conner
orchestrates a lunch, and he falls for her all over again.

That\'s when he finds out that she\'s about to marry another man.
Conner\'s heart breaks, and he wonders if there is another person in the
world that will make him feel this way again.

Conner has no choice.  He can\'t eat.  He can\'t sleep.  He can\'t work or
even watch TV.  All he wants to do is be with Isabella.

And from what she said at lunch, she\'s interested in him too.

He has to do something about it.

Not being with her is too painful to think about....



The film is in pre-production now.  Production starts this fall.
Interested musicians should forward a demo tape to Kenneth Bearden at
Walker Jane Productions.

Contact me at:          dreamer@brokersys.com

I will forward the snail mail address to those interested.

Thanks,

Kenneth.

One argument that every one seems to be forgetting is that most pirates were
running not on common sense but instead on their EGO and quite often pure
ARRAGANCE.  So what might be unreasonable odds to you and I mean nothing to
someone who takes up the trade of Piracy.  They honestly feel that they can
get away with it until such time as they decide to quit.

In some cases this might be a one time deal where they find out about an
unusually valuable cargo and other times they might go on for years before
capture and/or death.  I think we both believe that if they continue as
pirates for very long they WILL be caught.  I never envisioned them doing it
for 30 years (or more) myself.  That brings us to their new career of
prisoner!

Okay, I missed that part of it and I\'m sorry.  But let us continue along the
lines you suggest.  Setting up different Transponder responses is CT canon
along with changing the physical look of the ship (see "Corsair" under
ships).  IIRC they also had a bay large enough to hold a 100 dton ship so
that they could just take the whole thing in and jump out of system
immediately.  So, they don\'t have to ditch their ship after all.  They can
sell the entire captured ship for a fairly large sum of money even at a
lower price for going thru a fence.  Why would there be a "determined"
examination in every subsector? They are disguised as whatever transmitting
a "legitimate" code (stolen from a similar ship somewhere else) and just
refueling on their way thru at the local GG.  Weren\'t we just recently
talking about the 100 d limit being set based  on the largest gravity well
in the system.  Couldn\'t that put them far enough out system to be fairly
tough to identify reasonably?  Do you believe that all SDB\'s, Navy ships,
etc. are all so dilligent or could not be bribed a bit that one ship passing
thru couldn\'t be a corsair?  I almost say that was naive.  Don\'t get me
wrong here, I still feel that Pirates are a weak sister to other careers
available in the game.  There seems to be enough possibilities that it could
become a viable career option if your Erol Flynn is all I\'m saying.  I also
believe, like you, that the encouters table is weighed much to heavily
toward having a pirate attack than seems justified.  How do we fix that in
CT, we don\'t, lets try for T4.1.  Aahhhh, wait a sec, that takes place back
in year 0 so pirates can operate there effectively.  Oh well, I guess we\'re
stuck with what we got.  I would add however, in CT it started a few years
before the fringes were stable.  In the ensuing years there were at least
two frontier wars with the Zho\'s.  Hhhmmm, that makes about three - six
years of a STABLE Empire so maybe, just maybe, CT\'s tables weren\'t off after
all.......

Actually given how many planets in Traveller have populations of 6 or
less, how frequent it it is for them to have only 1 center of
population, and the high levels of trade in the canonical universe, many
Traveller planets are probably much better modeled as cities than as
"planets".

Is the DFW airport actually running at capacity?  How many people
actually go through it per week.

In the case of Dallas/Fort Worth (or many large modern airports) many of
these people board other flights within an hour or three.  Given that
trips in Traveller take significantly longer than modern airline flights
do and are often scheduled farther apart most starports are going to
need much more logistical support (hotels, etc) than modern airports.

Therefore strarports will have more in the way of hotels, restraunts,
bars, dens of iniquity, etc. than modern airports do beause they will be
supporting their passengers for longer periods of time before those
passengers move on to their final destinations.  While for many [most ?]
travellers the first planet they reach will _be_ their final destination
enough people will be travelleing on that they will need to find places
to stay, eat, shop, and engage in disgusting vices [law level permitting
or not] for a day to a week while they await further transport.  Unless
they have already prebooked transport off the world before they arrive,
or the straport is busy enough that ships for planet Y are an hourly
occurance or so, they will neeed some plance to stay while the ship is
in port.  If they are continuing on the ship they arrived in they may or
may not [IMTU usually may not - unless te port has no accomadations or
they have chartered the ship] be permitted to stay on the ship while it
is in port.

This might be true in America, but here in Norway we have a 97% solve rate
for bank robbers, and most of these are people that do this only once.

I can see a few easy ways:

1) turn a bulkhead porous to H2 via a slow acting reaction (ie,
non-explosive) into a compartment with an electrical short.

2) pull a sneak-job and set their PP O2 to 10in Hg and arrange a small
short. The resultant fire flash, especially if in engineering, might be a
really impresive series of reactions. combine with #1 for really leathal
fire and explosive effect.

3) insert a computer virus which locks open the fuel to the PP to maximum
flow, while then droping the containment fields.

on the not so easy but very effective list:
2g of anti-matter in a containment field powered off a battery. place near
PP (or in PP works).

Ships are readily traceable unless you carefully work to create a
paper-trail allowing you a legal claim.

Cargo theft is hard to trace (comparative volumes of respective items).

Kidnapping is not easy to get ransoms from, as you have to reveal where the
money is going to change hands, and (unless you only plan on it once) you
have to maintain the hostages. You also have to escape with the money. And,
if you kill them, you run up against one of the Imperial Crimes: Murder.

Extortion is often a form of piracy. If a customs or patrol boat rolls up
and says "Gimme KCr5 or I look the other way while the Corsair over there
picks you off" is just about the same as saying "Gimme KCr5 or I blow you
up" and is only a minor step from "Gimme KCr5 or I\'ll see to it I find a
reason to sieze your cargo &/or ship". (this last isn\'t piracy, but is very
similar in effect.)

time is only money when time is useful. Since most ports have brokers
available, and most merchants will be on a route or in a regular
operational area, they will often be able to build a "credit of trust" with
local brokers, so a call with encoded manifest gets the wheels rolling.
some economic benefits:

	1) picking 110 diameters avoids violent precipitation from minor errors

	3) increased chance of not being detected upon immediate jump-exit.

	4) Convoy operations: pick a jump exit spot not more than a 2 days out

TNE\'s misjup rules allow for up to a huge distance in the correct system on
a jump spatial location error.

also, if exit point is ONLY AT 100 diameters, that is a finite area to be
enforced (yes, AREA, not volume); if AT LEAST 100 diameters, then the
volume is infinite, with a defineable volume where defenses can be
gathered. The distinction forces totally different

Skipping happens too. But were I an ethically-challenged citizen of the

As for the Sword Worlds, I\'m wondering about the political situation - are
they known as a haven for fugitives from the Imperium? I\'d heard of the

LBB CT adventure) being known to the average Imperial citizen as
a haunt for pirates and renegades, but who knows how much relationship
reality has with common knowledge in this case.

Part of the problem with this is Traveller sensors easily detect ships out
beyond the 100 diameter limits. Pirating outgoing ships has the problem of
their jumping within the 100 diameter limit rather than trust out pirate\'s
promise to let them live. Pirating incoming ships has the problem of
reactions from the world you are hanging around.

I\'m not talking Black Globes here, but there must be something
that can be done - especially if we\'re talking a sub-1000 (or even
sub-500) dtn craft.

I think a pirate would have to concentrate on incoming traffic (or
intra-system craft) for exactly the reason you mention above. I
also think the pirate is going to need a jump-3 or better ship and
do all her raiding with at least a jump-1\'s worth on board for the 
getaway.

Ian again:

How much would such a pirate base cost to construct and maintain ?

A few days with belter-grade mining gear, plus the LS and stores from
a military supply cache or two - I see many pirates as being mutineers
or otherwise ex-military. Or perhaps they park one of those X-boat
tenders (touted as a favorite target of pirates) on a lonely asteroid.

People keep asking "how much does it cost" - I put forth that the
average pirate won\'t care, as he stole it anyway. 

This gives me another idea - when pirates steal from a ship, do they
clean out the life support consumables as well? I\'d think they would
to support their ops and bases - but if it was common for the pirates
to empty your oxygen tanks before they left, their targets would start
fighting to the death. A smart pirate might take a lot, but not all.

Agreed - but for plot purposes, I can imagine a pirate chief keeping

Yes. Especially as ships jumping in will be out of jump fuel.

Hmmm. On the other hand, imagine a group of PCs that have information on
the location of such a base. Rather than informing the Navy, they try and
scrape together a private military force to take it themselves, then
collect the pirate ships as they arrive ... even if you have to give the
captured ships back to their legitimate owners, any actual pirate ships
should be fair game.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Interesting - you\'d need enough high guard to bag the pirates, as they\'re
sure to have a secret fuel cache or two in-system (I sure would). The
first "Private Military force" that comes to mind is a Broadsword
(or equivalent) with it\'s carried merc contingent, that should do for both
storming the base and having a reasonable shot at catching the armed
merchants, 400-tn Corsairs and such that seem to be the "average"
pirate ships. Pirate ship jumps in, doesn\'t get the code, tries to make
it to a fuel cache and refuel for jump before being intercepted.
Carrying a fighter frame module (if you have a Broadsword) could make 
this interception easier.

Of course, if your Marines manage to capture a knowledgable pirate or
two and make him cooperative (promises, threats, psi-powers, whatever),
you could give the right answer codes and get the pirates to dock - then
your only problem is hiding the captured ship when your next pigeon
stops by. :)

comes up, do we have a geologist on the list ?

If we dont, I\'ll have to fake it.

Veins of ore are fundamentally formed by volcanic activity, and the action
of wind and water - in other words, by \'live\' worlds, not by chunks of rock
in space.

Asteroids, therefore, are going to be of constant composition. This is
usually very bad - an entire asteroid of 99.5% nickle iron, 0.0045 percent
lead and 0.005 percent silver is unlikely to be exploitable, regardless of
the raw amount of silver 50 parts per million represents. On the other
hand, a 1% silver, 95% nickle iron, 4% lead asteroid may be worth exploiting.

I have absolutely no idea about carbonaceous asteroids.

Ice asteroids are valuable, because ice is hydrogen and water, and both of
those have lots of uses.

From what we know about our system, at least some moons have volcanic
activity. Volcanic activity can create seams of valuable minerals, and it
doesnt matter if as a whole the moon has the uranium content of your
average sandpit, if the bit you\'ve found is enough parts per million to be
exploitable.

Now, this seems to imply that in a system with moons, you are going to have
a chance of a number of small, vulnerable sub-colonies engaging in mining
and exploration activity. This is going to be happening a long way away
from the mainworld, and thus away from the mainworld\'s sensors, defenses
and so on.

These small colonies are unlikely to be self-supporting, and have to have
someone drop by to drop off supplies and pick up samples or product.

It is probable many of these colonies will be owned by off-world commercial
or government interests, and thus the possibility exists of smuggling - the
mine manager agrees to have a ton of gem-bearing ore drop off the back of a
truck, in return for a ton of spare parts off this list, which Head Office
is for some reason refusing to supply. This fits with the history of piracy
in the Caribbean on Earth - John Hawkins, for example, was as likely to
trade with a Spanish colony as to try and raid it (Spanish island colonies
tended to be resupplied by regular convoys, which didnt always turn up when
they should have, and charged high prices when they did).

One thing this implies is that the UPPs for a system need to be
multi-dimensional - the IISS surveys we know and love only record
mainworlds. I personally find it entirely reasonable that a world like Heya
(2402/Regina, B687745-5 Ag Ri 734) has a series of higher tech, lower pop
mining settlements in the Outsystem, or around it\'s companion star (a
corrolory to this, for me at least, is that worlds with asteroid belts in
their system should class as asteroid belts for Source trade purposes, but
not for Market purposes).

For the reasons Hans, Steve and myself have documented, piracy is very
unlikely to happen in or near mainworlds. I will have to check this with my
factional colleagues (guys, meet at 1040 GMT tonight on efnet\'s
#Piratesmustdiediedie to plot strategy), but I dont think we will have as
big a problem with piracy being solely an outsystem problem. There is still
the issue the Navy would have with pirates doubling as spies for Enemy
Powers (which is a big issue in the Marches, what with enemies on three
sides), but the fact that the space in and near the 100 diameter limit can
simply and cheaply be secured does not apply to the rest of the system.

Does this let us all have our cake, and eat it too ?

	Like a feature of certain states\' law I recently read about in a newspaper

Contrary to what other posters have said, my feeling is that a hydrogen
leak would not produce an explosion large enought to destroy the ship, let
alone a chunk of the highport. Hydrogen explosions are pretty impressive,
just look at the Challenger, but I don\'t think that enough hydrogen and
oxygen can be brought together quickly enought by "accident" inside a ship
to destroy it. A typical ship is broken into several small gas-tight
compartments, and any hydrogen leaking would progably react with the air or
ship contents slowly and without pyrotechnics, rather than building up to
fireball proportions before combusting. I would think that, after a few
millenia of space travel, engineers would have perfected ways of
eliminating sudden explosions.

IMTU, starships dock outside a highport or are serviced by port shuttles;
this reduces congestion around the highport and prevents smugglers or
terrorists gaining direct access to the port. Even if your ship is in a
hangar or some kind of internal drydock, the station armor may run inside
the hangar, so that the force of any explosion woiuld be directed outward.
Starport regulations may also require ships docking internally be unarmed.
In short, an explosion that destroys your ship would probably not affect
the port too much.

A better idea is an out-of control ship crashing into the highport; this
would probably destroy the ship and do considerable damage to the port.
Depending on local laws, a ship whose trajectory intersects the station\'s
may be blown out of space without a warning, but even a pile of debris
hitting the station at a few km/s should do a bit of damage.

If you really want to blow the highport up, how about "accidentally"
launching some nuke-det missiles at it? The combat rules for nukes assume
they detonate far away from the target, which is only hit by the
nuke-pumped lasers. Actually hitting a station would probably blow away a
huge chunk of it and make the rest unusable. Of course, TL12 and above
stations probably have nuclear dampers installed to prevent precisely this
kind of thing.

>Can a fusion plant be made to explode somehow? Or is it

>explosion is more likely that triggers a volatile cargo?

Again, unless your ship is inside an unarmored hangar, even detonating your
cargo load of dirty nukes probably won\'t do significant damage to the
station. Perhaps a better idea is a cargo of persistant biological or
chemical agent that gets out. It could corrode electronics, cause disease,
or just get the highport quarantined for a few weeks. Or you could download
a virus to the highport\'s computers that makes it go insane and start
attacking.... *slap!* owww.

I\'d say that the Sword Worlds are pretty hostile to the Imperium, given
their histories, so I\'d say they are the freeport of choice. Now, the Navy
knows this too, and I think the IN would be very interested in ships going
into and out of the Sword Worlds with inadequate paperwork, and I think the
Navy would be aggressivly patrolling all systems within about a jump-4 of
the border.

Stealthed ships are going to attract bureaucratic attention when they dock.
Essentially, I dont think you can be both stealthed+well armed and pass as
a legitimate merchant.

Lying doggo works, but has the problem of making it very hard to be in the
right spot to intercept a target.

I am 99% sure that intrasystem craft in the outsystem is your last, best

Attacking x-boat tenders is going to attract a lot of direct Imperial
attention. I dont think you can conduct meaningful amounts of maintainence
and repair at such a casual base.

This is a game theory problem. While it is interest of pirates in general
to let their prey live, it is in the interest of every specific pirate to
make sure there are no witnesses.

  What if the authorities or fate disagree? If ID\'ing a ship is quite
hard (see current telescope resolution thread) then how do you know
that new arrival isn\'t heavily armed or a patrol boat? Such a ship
(expensive, purpose built?) can\'t function except as a hostile warship;
no conventional revenue stream is possible, nor is "swim with the fishes"
intrusion survivable.

I keep wondering why people expect criminals to balance books,

So they can\'t create a conventional revenue stream - neither are they
paying taxes or doing a lot of things as they are expected to.
You LS costs are going to be pretty low when you\'re stealing all the
things that make it possible. 

As for "swimming with the fishes" - the original CT Corsair ship
(400 dtn, possibly the _Nishemani_ class as per DGP\'s SOM)
has fake modules, extensible fins, variable radio emissions and
variable transponders - obviously some deception effort was made.
How effective these efforts will be depends on how often the Imperium
boards ships in it\'s internal security patrols.

  A pirate syndicate starts to imply massive capitalization and an
impressive organization. How this would establish itself without the
assistance of an outside party (thus leaving the definition of piracy
behind and becoming commerce raiders) is difficult to see.

  Such events may occur very rarely, but it lacks credibility as
the common model for piracy.

Consider the chain of people it takes to get an ounce of cocaine

But seriously, the only organization I\'m talking about is a couple weeks\'
mining work with a Seeker model scout (hidden asteroid base),
a pile of supplies lifted from one of the hundreds of military caches,
and a Free/Far Trader crew of challenged enough ethics to take on
loads of cargo of questionable origin. If a couple pirate ships share
bases (and only the Navigator needs know where the bases actually
are, improving security), you\'ve got yourself a syndicate - it can grow
naturally, assuming a few pirates survive their entry into the business
long enough to start planning for the future.

Steve again:

  What sort of armament (well, general performance and load-out) are
you assuming for your pirate ship?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I\'m assuming (based entirely on the way the Gazelle was laid
out to discourage mutineers) that the performance and load-out
of a pirate ship will be whatever the pirates can keep working
from the small patrol vessel they stole in the first place.
3G to 4G, more lasers than missiles - missiles make a mess of the
vessel, and are hard to replace.

If you want to pick and choose your armament and load-out, you\'re
talking about a purpose-built commerce raider, not a pirate.

Steve again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>snip>>>>
My point would be that large organizations are ultimately less economic
and more vulnerable. In addition they\'re much more likely to trigger a
response that will almost guarantee their liquidation.

  Part of the problem is that the extremely burdensome cost of bases
is one of the main points against widespread use of SDB\'s, fighters,
or even patrol ships against piracy. Whether this is so is subject
to debate. Presumably these bases (disposable or not) are not huge
capital or operations outlays.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I see the pirate groups being small, even if they do have a base
of operations - as you are pointing out, overly large groups or
overly successful pirates get a visit from Light Cruisers.

Steve again:

  Why not sell the first ship you capture and avoid the stress? I\'m
assuming rational/economic behaviour here; I frankly doubt that a 
band of psychopaths will last very long.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
If you have a free port to sell ships in, enough spare crew aboard
to pilot them there, enough fuel in the target\'s tank to jump away
from the cavalry - this sounds like a pirate\'s dream haul, and 
perhaps enough to retire on. This will happen how often?

An I\'m wondering how much you\'d get on the black market for
a used, battle-damaged stolen starship anyway. 25% of the sticker
price may be optimistic, and that would be (for a Free Trader) 9.25MCr.
That\'s enough cash (assuming you aren\'t paying black market prices)
to replace two triple turrets full of beam lasers.


Steve again, on why the Corsair profession exists:

  As much fun as they might be, it gets very strange if rule system

startting to think.

Firstly, active sensors appear pretty useless. The way to go appears to be
using passive sensors to identify targets, and then use LIDARs to get a
fire control lock. AEMS may have uses in highlighting either missiles or
the individual beads of blossomed kinteic kill missiles, for point defense
lasers to pick off (how much energy does it take to boil away 1cm3 of
superdense, anyway ?).

LIDARS useful to sensible combat ranges (a million km or so) appear to be
small and cheap by military standards. The combat technique of trying to
\'scrub\' a hull of surface features by use of long distance lasers and/or
kinetic kill missiles has been suggested. I would think that it wouldnt be
that hard to make LIDARS and PEMS massivly redundant (I am thinking about
20 or so per warship), and have most of them behind blow-off or removable
armour plates - 10 cm of crystaliron will stop any laser, and as LIDARS get
damaged you just reveal new ones.

Do people think this is possible ?

Ah, the great D.B. Cooper.  He didn\'t rob a bank, but hijacked the plane
and demanded the money.  Then he parachuted from a maitenence hatch in the
cargo hold.

Since they couldn\'t find him, they decided he "must have" died in the jump.
 About twnety years later some of the money was found in an area creekbed.
Abbie Hoffman swore that D.B lived but then lost everything in a
real-estate deal.  Who knows.

Another good myth is that no-one ever escaped from Alcatraz Federal Prison.
 The story goes that nobody could survive the freezing water (46 F on
average), the strong currents, and the sharks which cruise the bay.  But
after one breakout the found one of the prisoners asleep under the North
tower of the Golden Gate Bridge.  He had survived the swim, but was too
tired to continue.

 CAN go without CG does not mean SHOULD go without. Designers who leave
CG off of their Airframe designs are denying easy access to all airless

multi megaCredit pile of hardware the owner calls home. I can see

	The simplest would be to fake a hydrogen leak from the refueling station
in the docking bay, and have the leak sensors fail. As the hydrogen vapor
concentration reaches the right point, a single spark would boom!

	From gut feeling, I don\'t think a fusion explosion would be believable.
Not only are there bound to be excessive "fail safe" measures, but I\'m not
sure there\'s going to be enough fusion going on at power-plant levels to
produces a major boom. The big trouble, at least today, with fusion is
keeping it GOING ... anything that interferes with containment would just
destroy the near-vacuum and snuff out the fusion reaction. Maybe the heat
released would cause some local concussion damage as the inrushing air is
flashheated and rushes outward ... Any of the physics experts out there
able to speculate what the maximum boom would be for a fusion reaction
putting out a megawatt (or a million joules per second ...) under control,
assuming ALL controls vanished instantaneously? At least the total amount
of energy that would be released?

	For that matter, I\'d expect pretty serious safety controls on LHyd too. In
fact, I personally wouldn\'t put a refueling hookup IN any of the docking
bays. Fueling would be done at a separate fueling station outside the
highport. Maybe a hydrogen leak from the ship\'s tanks; maybe make it look
like an outside party (unrelated terrorist attack?)... Yeah, that\'s it!
Make it look like bad brother just by sheer miserable luck got caught in a
terrorist bombing not even aimed at him ... when it was actually his
perfect luck to have been kidnapped before he could blow up!

I\'m curious where the 4.5 AU figure comes from, since that gives the sun a
diameter of 4.23 million miles.

Unless the sun has ballooned to amazing size while I was catching a nap,
it\'s diameter is around 850,000 miles.  This gives a rough jump limit of 85
million miles, or about .9 AU.

Canonicaly, the Earths did test their stolen Vilani artifacts.. errr..

They close dAlcatraz because it cost a fortune to run the place, was fairly
small, and the fed\'s had newer and better prisons.

After the last prisoner left, it sat empty and decaying for a few years,
until a group of Native Americans claimed it as tribal land.  That lead to
all sorts of court battles, and the amuseing image of the SFPD sailing in
little circles around The Rock since the Indians controled to only landing.
 They eventually left, and Alcatraz became a National Historical Site and
bird refuge.

Yes, I do work in the travel industry in San Francisco.

I agree. That\'s partly why I think piracy can be a going 
concern. Consider how difficult it would be for police if 
it took 2-3 weeks to get a confirmation of a ship 
ownership. Ok, so the Police carry copies of the local 
jurisdictions records, but the records can be many months 
out of date for some ships, especially for a system not on 
the main path, although storage is cheap, I\'m not sure how 
much of the records will be stored on the average patrol 
vessel. There\'s  probably an industry in inserting false 
information into the distribution network (because it can 
take months or years for anyone to confirm this data with 
the theoretical original site. Think of a version Usenet where it 
takes at least a week for each hop, and there is no 
deja-news to check what was sent. Can you be sure you\'ve 
got all the posts?

The merchants will get annoyed about being 
held for weeks while their ID is checked out, If the SDB 
needs to check with the home Starport, and it\'s around the 
Gas giant, then it might take a day just to get the 
information in-system. Perhaps each vessel carries a 
veri-signed digital signature, and the authorities rely on 
the unbreakability of the signature encryption for 
security. Given enough computer power and enough samples, 
anything is breakable, so it becomes a matter of how much 
trouble are the criminals prepared to go to, but then most 
security is a compromise like that.

I think they\'d only allow a certain limited number of 
planetfalls. (i.e. you\'re only allowed within 
subsector A" ) and spread the information outside that 
subsector to all the cops. If the ship shows up outside 
that subsector then it\'s skipped, and should be held 
pending verification. It\'s a bit sucky if you\'ve just paid 
off the ship and the bank hasn\'t got around to telling 
everyone (or they\'ve sent the messages, but they haven\'t 
arrived yet)

In the Real world (on the Piracy web pages that someone
was so kind to post) there was a ship hijacked and sailed
to a Chinese port, where they were unloading the cargo,
and a vigilant staff member of the shipping lines office
noticed the ship, and called in the cops. The Shipping
compant produced its papers to prove that they owned the
ship, and the "Pirates" produced theirs - the company
managed to prove that the pirates papers were forgeries.
So the Pirates produced a new set of better made papers,
which were proved to be forgeries, and the pirates
produced another even better set, and so on and so on.... 
Meanwhile the ship has been sitting at anchor with a leak 
so it started sinking, and got beached, the cargo is water 
logged and rotting, and the pirates have all been let out on
bail (and promptly disappeared). The Shipping company
still haven\'t got their ship back... 

Another problem is ships purporting to be chinese patrol 
boats that order shipping to port to be inspected, and 
unload all the cargo during inspection, and take it all 
away. The shipping company complain, and the Chinese 
government claims to have never heard of the incident. It\'s 
got so bad the Chinese Govt issued an official statement 
that those patrol boats aren\'t theirs.

Another ship with a load of Sugar was hijacked, and taken 
to a port in Africa, where it was discovered (but only 
because of instantaneous communications - not a factor 
IMTU) and the pirates were actually caught. Considered to 
have been very lucky.

Once they have the ships, apparently there is a business 
where the pirates contract to carry cargo from one place to 
another, and disappear en-route. The figure (IIRC) was 200 
Million Dollars a year in losses to this scam alone. 
 
(BTW, any idea how big you\'re ship has to be before the 
cargo is worth as much as the ship - consider Sugar, at ~$1 
per kilo, and (guessing at its density as being about 1.2) 
1200kg per m3, or 16800kg per dispT) - 400t Fat trader only 
has a cargo of 200dispT, or ~$3.36 Million. Better than a kick 
in the teeth for untraceable stuff. Now Steak at NZ$15 per 
Kg and a density of ~1 is 14000k per dispT or $210000 per 
dispT, a fat trader has $M42  (admittedly New Zealand 
doolars) of Steak on board. Even subtracting a lot for refridgeration 
and packing, that\'s a lot of money.

> Cargo theft is hard to trace (comparative volumes of respective items).

Apparently the sugar theft above was "done to order" 
someone had had a sugar order fall through, and the pirates 
offerered to get them some sugar, waited till a ship was 
being loaded with sugar, and hijacked it.
 
The Webpage was stunningly informative. I hadn\'t realised 
how prevalent piracy was in the modern world, with all the 
advantages of GPS, instant world wide communications, and a 
global market. Take away that instant communication

The reason the pirates use small boats in general is their 
speed, as bigger boats  aren\'t sufficiently faster than the 
targets to reliably catch them. Perhaps a 400t freighter 
with a load of fighters would be a better pirate vessel 
than a 400t corsair? (at least it would be better at 
pretending to be a merchant :-)

Well, this show would argue differently.  Perhaps because they
are people with few "normal" skills and hence few other options.

However, I would indeed see piracy as something you do occaisionally
in lieu of something else, rather than waiting around to do.

It presumes low traffic from the system you are at, to the system
you are going to, is low as some times.  It doesn\'t take that low
a traffic to have a gap of a few days.

There is also the issue of being willing to tell a competator your
plans.

Which can happen easily.

I presumes piracy is uncommon.  (I don\'t know aobut "quite
minimal")  I\'ve been saying that all along.

It requires a ship goes there.  That is the point.  There are no
other communications in Traveller.  There is no "e-mail".

  Uh-oh, it\'s deja vu all over again. From the KKM debate (IIRC) the
backed-up sensors made sense. Also, killing the bus (or encouraging it
to deploy) at long range makes them pretty harmless.

  A variant on the above is putting some LIDARs on high-evasion drones
and parking them a few tens of kilometers away; you get the best aspects
of the high-end KKM bus design without the vulnerability of such units
being closer to enemy PD than your actual fighting platform. Presumably
some hit penalty would accrue for the added complications/time-lag.

  The 4.5 AU value comes from using the Jump limit being the gravity
gradient equal to that of earth\'s at 100 of its\' diameters. Thus, most
planets close enough to their primary to be habitable will be well 
inside that limit.

  It makes for a radically different background; the one such I ran

  Keep in mind that the above was my assessment of a third party
suggested administration/enforcement scheme. I consider said
scheme to be too ineffective to be a credible alternative for my
own campaign.

  One possibility between nearby systems with a particular eye
to security is to require non-scheduled flights to file a flight
plan with local control (if any, obviously) and to receive a 
flight ID # and the origin systems portion of a pre-identified/
authenticated one-write code pad specific to that flight ID #
and target system.

  Upon arrival, you forward your ID pack, and it\'s compared to
the previously delivered other half of the code. If it doesn\'t
match or you don\'t have an ID then you get pulled over (plus
maybe a 1% chance of the officials being bored? :> )

  AFAIK, one-write codes are effectively unbreakable, and of
course non-reusable.

  Again, the ImperialLines (and intel services) question - there
must be either no overview of ship traffic records (IMO this is
unbelievable) or there is a sub-system which automatically allows
the interested parties to cover the tracks of their own covert
operations.

>The merchants will get annoyed about being

  Well, eight AU\'s is a couple hours round trip, but the source
of the verification is the more important step (i.e., is it
practical or not, which it might not be). Again, most traffic will
be near the administration centers.

  I\'d suggest that pre-emptive registration like the above would
be a basic element of any vessel surveillance that the Imperium
might maintain - it\'s cheap, effectively bypasses the time-lag
issue, and is damned near fool-proof.

  Well, the pirates need to make money, as the crew aren\'t going to be
keen on ponying up their savings to buy shares in an enterprise that\'s
losing money. Proper maintenance has a downside to avoidance; +1 to 
misjump - the Navy may not even have to chase you.

  FWIW, I consider the annual maintenance requirement to be avoidable
as long as the parts are purchased and skilled crew time is allocated.
The starport visitation detail is (IMO) unrealistic for our purposes.

  LS costs are broken, but the assumption of constant small hits on ships
(as opposed to facilities or worlds) is unworkable as near as I can tell.

  Any pirate that fails to _move_ like an honest (or average) merchant
is going to be waving a great big banner saying "put me on your hot
list". Again, said inspection will only be survivable if the ship itself
spends most of its\' time trading, and is itself a legal merchant vessel.
This does assume modest analysis of traffic patterns (as reported by
starports and security vessels) by someone (IN?), but I would have to
consider the lack of this feature unrealistic.

  I\'m more concerned with being able to match a merchants activity
profile, and physical characteristics. A near-warship flitting
about is going to bleed red ink, and still cannot survive a physical
inspection, nor can it conceal its\' long-term activity patterm (like
avoiding starports like the plague w/o generating legal income).

Remember, guns don\'t kill pirates; forensic accountants kill pirates.

  Capitalization is much lower. Besides, if that were a genuine
security concern it would be solved in short order (i.e., reduced
to a much lower equilibrium level). The comparison is not accurate.

  Replace missiles with sand - supplies cash and reduces repair bills
from low-intensity combat. Reduce tankage for cargo - it seems 
impractical to have a stable of starships available. A small warship
(however low-end) is going to attract a lot of attention when it goes
missing, though, and even more when its\' effects re-appear, yes?

  Agreed. Some debaters have tried that scam, though.

  OK. The same or smaller base also supports a perfectly adequate
planetary (_not_ system) defense squadron, though.

  It\'s the ideal haul - all others are stepping stones to suicide
(removal from job market by attrition). If an armed response is on
the way then any target is inopportune; in a backwater or out-system
against non-Jump targets, you may very well have time to fuel up the
target or strip it bare.

  MCr 9 even twelve ways lets some people retire; they can also sell
their own ship, which for a small warship is more like MCr 100.

  You\'ve mistaken me for someone else. My case is that several types
of piracy can easily exist in a reasonably well-policed Imperium (OC,
not all will be successful), but that for internal consistency I need
to explore which ones will be how rare or effectively impossible.

IMO the Imperium would be very concerned about using X-boats for non
imperial mail. Otherwise enemies of the Imperium could use the X-boat
system to their advantage against the Imperium (by sending coded
messages hidden in innocent looking documents, etc.). As the political
process would be slow to enact imperial edicts this would put the
enemies one jump ahead.

Robin/Trin\'s Veil

Cleanup details continue to work around the clock to repair the damage
taken by Robin Starport in a recent asteroid near-miss. The rogue asteroid,
intended for conversion to a guardship or monitor, was in transit to a
parking station, ready for conversion, when its thruster unit
malfunctioned. The asteroid was feared to be on a collision course with the
Port Asteroid.

Commander Wallace Ingai declared a State of Emergency when the civilian
Port Governor failed to act decisively, with Navy personnel and Marines
securing the installation while a team of experts comprising
Lieutenant-Commander Rodgar, IN (Retd), Dr Ernest Smit, Xaviiar Kaii
(ex-Scout Service) and Lieutenant Harris Smit (on furlough from the 112th
Lift Infantry) approached the asteroid to plant charges. 

A previous attempt to deflect the rock was made by the IN destroyer Gorrane
(Commander Eriise, MCUF and Bar), which launched its entire arsenal of
nuclear-tipped missiles at the rogue asteroid in a high-speed interception
from the destroyer\'s outsystem patrol zone. This brave attempt failed, and
served merely to complicate the experts\' task due to debris and radiation.

The team approached the asteroid in the station\'s Rescue Cutter and managed
to deploy two multi-megaton warheads in a crater on the asteroid\'s surface.
This location was chosen by Dr Smit, who was badly injured in a vacc suit
rupture soon afterward. The doctor is recovering in hospital.

Commendations were made for the extremely able piloting of Lt-Comdr Rodgar,
Dr Smit\'s excellent judgment and Lt. Smit\'s expertise in nuclear
demolitions. Scout Kaii was also commended for assembling the team and for
his timely intervention (and effective) in a hazardous riot control
situation.

The asteroid was broken into several diverging fragments by the charges.
All the larger fragments missed the Port Asteroid, though heavy damage was
sustained from smaller debris. A special posthumous Mention In Dispatches
was made of the entire crew of the SDB Havoc (Sublieutenant Andrea Ilviian,
IN), which positioned itself over the main habitation zone and attempted to
intercept the smaller rock fragments with laser fire. Several such
fragments were destroyed before the Havoc was herself struck. The gallant
SDB was lost with all hands, striving in the finest traditions of the
Imperial Navy to protect the citizens of the Imperium.

In the words of Commander Ingai \'This was a potential catastrophe, averted
only by the bravery and competence of a few individuals, not all of whom
had a sworn duty to act. We salute their courage and sacrifice. Without
them, this appalling situation would have been far worse.\'

Sure, if you don\'t have the manpower, you don\'t have the manpower.
Though even then I\'d be tempted to see if I could program the ship to

Sorry, but there are units on ships that you *can\'t* repair with the
tools on board. In fact, you\'d have the devil\'s own time just getting
the busted one out and the replacement in without access to shipyard
facilities. Otherwise, the annual maintenance rules go out the window. 

Those rules amount to saying that there are things on a ship that
*require* shipyard facilities to work on. Maybe they are things like
the main supports for the drive or powerplant (apt to be castings
weighing tons and meters across). Or some gizmo required for
"calibration" is too big to fit in a ship (modern example would be the
gear required to "balance" the props and propeller shafts on a ship). 

Ditto for the gear required to cut open the "hard patches" on the hull
to get at these assemblies. You can do it with ordinary gear, but
moving that large chunk of hull is hazardous to your health without a
shipyard crane. Also, you\'ll want the gear to "xray" the welds for
soundness when you replace the patch. You don\'t want to find out about
a flawed weld by having the patch come open at a critical moment.

Check back in the archives. I posted some stuff about this only six
months or so back. 

Here\'s the short version. 

Planetismals form from the ice/gas/dust of the nebula the system is
forming from. When they get big enough, the radioisotopes present
(remember, they tend to have a *much* higher proportion of shortlived
isotopes!) cause melting. The "dust" settles to the center leaving a
layer of "ice" over a layer of dusty material. If they are bigg enough
the dust ball in the center melts as well. This settles into a stony
layer, and a center that\'s composed mostly of nickel-iron and any other
metals that *don\'t* have an afinity for silicates (those wind up in the
stony part). 

Collisions will break off pieces giving you ice chuknks, ice/stone
chunks, stone chunks, stony/nickel-iron chunks, and nickel iron chunks.

> I have absolutely no idea about carbonaceous asteroids.

Once the star starts up, you get the ices melting on the nearer chunks,
and gases being driven off as well as reactions caused by the UV from
the star. That\'s what carbonaceous asteroids are. The result of
"baking" water/ammonia/methane ice while exposing it to UV. You get
tarry mess, consist of all sorts of CHON (carbon, Hydrogen, oxygen,
nitrogen) compounds.

So close to the star you get carbonaceous, stone and "iron" bodies.
Farther out, the carbonaceus become icy bodies. Note that this will
likely be *beyond* Jupiter, as small icy bodies aren\'t stable that
close in.

> Ice asteroids are valuable, because ice is hydrogen and water, and both of
> those have lots of uses.

The ice is a *mixture* of water, ammonia, and methane. It *isn\'t* just
water.

The hydrogen is valuable. But the nitrogen may be even more valuable,
as it\'s badly needed for thing like food production (can\'t have
protiens without nitrogen). 

So ice is valuable, and CHON is *very* valuable. Stony material is
so/so. Nickel iron is ok if you want them, or you want to build an
armored base.

Mind you, there are lots of *other* things in both stony and
nickel-iron bodies. Stony is *mostly* silicon, aluminum, magnesium,
titanium and oxygen. Just like the earth\'s crust. But there are
reasonable amounts of other stuff in there. 

But for both Stony and nickel-iron you are going to have to "refine"
the asteroid to get the other stuff. Because the processes that
concentrate them on earth just won\'t be there. On the other hand,
consider that 1 part per *billion* in a cubic kilometer of rock gives
you a one meter cube. And I don\'t know about you, but I\'d like a cubic
meter of gold, platinum, silver, etc just fine. :-)

Trouble is, with fusion power, it\'s not that hard to just process an
entire asteroid into it\'s component elements. And while volcanic
activity can create seams of minerals, it\'s *water* plus volcanic
activity that does so here on earth.

D.B. Cooper didn\'t rob a bank. He hijacked a plane and demanded the
money. He\'s something of a local legend. Alas, they *did* find portions
of a few bills about 10 years back. They found them in a spottwhere
dredging "spoil" had been dumped recently. This tends to confirm the
theory that he came down in the middle of the Columbia river. 

Other likely theories are that he came down in heavy woods and got hung
up in a tree and couldn\'t get down, or broke a leg or to in the
process. Given that we\'ve had folks stumble over 20 and 40 year oild
plane wrecks in the woods, it\'s not that unlikely that his corpse was
up in a tree till it fell apart. And the money is lining a rodent den
somewhere.

There\'s no need to bring the stuff together "quickly". if the ration of
hydrogen to oxygen is too low, nothing happens. Ditto for too high. And
once the mix is in the (fairly narrow) explosive range, you need an
ignition source.

You *can\'t* prevent explosions except by catching leaks early. As I
note above, once you get the right mixture it *will* explode given a
spark or heat source. The seperation of the ship into sections will
help limit things. Still, in port, and even in flight on passenger
carrying vessels, it won\'t be at all unusual to have the airtight doors
between sections *open*.

If sensors detect loss of pressure, or a hydrogen leak, the doors
would be closed automatically. That\'s why my scenario had the sensors
"fail" (actually get deliberately bypassed). And note that I had the
port wanting blood for letting the sensors system get into the state
were they *could* fail.

That\'s equivalent to requiring modern ships to be loaded by cargo
lighters rather than by autonmated loading gear at a loading wharf.
Ain\'t gonna happen. Ships with only a few containers to transfer may do
this. Anybody with a substantial cargo to transfer will dock to a
loading port on the station. 

And it\'s a lot more convenient to be docked to the station while you do
business. You can use station power (so your engineer can tinker with
the power plant). You can use *wired* comm links, thus cutting down the
chances of eavesdropping. You can get from the ship to the station (and
vice versa) a lot faster.

Internal hangars *aren\'t* all that likely except for small craft. Too
many things that can go wrong. Plus, if a ship exploded in one, the
atmosphere in it would help *cause* damage. If the "inner" side was
stronger, you\'d *probably* blow the outer hull. You\'d also damage the
hell out of any ships with hulls weaker than that. And then the pieces
from the exploding ship will do a number on that "inner hull".

And the station *won\'t* be "armored". No real point in it. Enough armor
to stop military weapons costs too damn much. There will be some
shielding against solar flares, and there will be proctection against
micrometeorites and "paint flake" type space junk.

But exploding ships aren\'t goinmg to be that common. And the station\'s
hull can be breached by the pieces of a ship that goes "boom".

> Starport regulations may also require ships docking internally be unarmed.

> the port too much.

Only if your ship isn\'t anywhere *near* the port. And even if it isn\'t,
there\'s still a chance that a chunk of your ship (possibly weighing
*tons*) will crash into it fast enough to penetrate. 

If you are docked to the port, then the nearby sections will get
bombarded with pieces of ship, but it shouldn\'t affect the inner layers
of the port much.

It probably helps to realize that the port is likely to be a sort of
"core" with spokes sticking out at various angles. The ships dock to
the spokes, which would merely be *strong* tubes with cargo and people
moving gear running through the inside. 

So the blast could go as far as "cutting" the spoke, and killing people
on the wrong side of the airtight doors when they close. Aside from the
casualties, you\'d *really* piss off anyone docked farther "out" on the
spoke, as they\'d have to move to another one, or use shuttles until the
spoke was repaired.

And of course, the pieces could puncture other sections of that spoke
or nearby spokes.

Another likely layout is for a station using spin gravity and having
ships dock to the outer surface of the cylinder. C.J. Cherryh\'s books
use this a lot. It has a lot of advantages, as you can\'t loose station
gravity short of breaking it into pieces. And the only power required
for gravity is that required to "trim" the station\'s rotation.

At 3 km/sec an object has a KE equivalent to the same mass in TNT. And
the energy goes up as the *square* of the velocity. In other words, you
are talking about subjecting the station to a small to medium yield
*nuke*. That\'s liable to *destroy* the station.

The nuke *can\'t* do blast damage unless it is in *contact* with the
station when it goes off. No shock waves in a vacuum. 

That\'s why a ship exploding is interesting. The blast itself can\'t do
much to the station. But the pieces of ship thrown out by the blast
*can*.

  MCr 9 even twelve ways lets some people retire; they can also sell

How much does a new identity cost? I\'ve heard MCr1 bandied about
for a dependable one - and remember you need enough to for a greedy,
irresponsible person to retire on, not just get a new start - I think 
we\'ve already established that if a pirate could function normally in
society, she would. :)

Here\'s an idea - how many people that the Imperium call Pirates call
themselves Pirates? How many are Geonee seperatists, Ine Givar
terrorists, Megacorp black ops anti-competitor teams, or whatever?
The first two might have to act as normal pirates (no support available),
but be willing to put up with the danger and low pay for "the cause".
The last one might pretend to be pirates, but have new identities and
fat retirement bonuses waiting for them at the end of their cruise.

Many historical pirates were escaped slaves or dirt-poor people from
undeveloped countries. If the average wage on your homeworld is
subsistence or less, and the average lifespan is 30-something, 
the dangerous and insanely risky pirate career might look very
attractive.

Relying on capturing a ship often enough to keep your air filters sounds
like a quick way to die to me, and most orginised criminals keep excellent
accounts.

This is a cost/benefit thing. I think the cost of inspecting a ship when it
is in port is fairly low, therefore this will happen at least occasionally.
Most definitly when a ship limps into a starport with battle damage.

Again, I dont think you could do annual maintainence at such a base. As a

source).

Sort of. Civilian-grade missiles can probably be bought over-the-counter by
our resupply crew.

I really, really think stealing a Navy ship would get you in trouble. I
think renegade Vargr would be a better chance, or a beefed-up Far Trader
(say, 20 dtons of TL12 batteries and 2G of HEPLAR, plus a 450 or so
megajoule spinal laser ... hmmmmm).

This is why I\'d take a Far Trader along with collapsible fuel tanks and
extra crew - refuel the captured ship from it, and then have it limp to
your freeport.

Depends if you can get it into another jurisdiction. Again, I think you\'d
get a better price in the Vargr Extents or the Sword Worlds.

This could also be a cool campaign hook for a group of players - they
unwittingly buy a Far Trader that got captured by pirates two owners back,
and the original owners trace it.

The main question for us anti-piracy people is \'what do we have to do to

Monsters sticks in my craw, given the Hard SF emphasis of the game.

The person at top is actually talking about what *I* was looking for.
Physics accurate modelling, as compared to the ease of use model that
Anders seems to be talking about (and apparently is used in Mayday and BL).
I want to *know* what\'s wrong with the more gameplay friendly model, and if
it doesn\'t add too much complexity, I\'ll look for the more physics correct
model.

Meanwhile, I was always under the impression that the vector based movement
system using past and future positions and 1 hex/turn acceleration = 1G
*was* a physics accurate system (I mean truly accurate, not "close enough").

Ok now I\'m really confused, and maybe this is why I\'ve had a hard time
absorbing some of Anders\' statements; I thought (still think) d= 1/2 * a *
t^2 *was* "Reality".  Now you show me a table with a new column labelled
"Reality" which does not match the column labelled "(1)".  Perhaps, Anders,
you are thinking of something other than what I am thinking of when you are
talking about method (1)?

In any case, I think there is a disconnect here somewhere.

But the annual maintenance is to insure that the ship is in *good* working
order. Many piratvessels will of course not be in this state as the annual
maintanence is skipped over and over again. The vessels will IMO be
patchworks of stolen and cheap bought equipment. Give the pirates a base
and time any good engineer could do most annual maintance *if needed*. It
will not be state of the art work, but it will propably work at least.

Going to todays example there is propably hundreds of vessels that don\'t
receive the maintance it need to be in *good* shape. Even Norwegian ships,
and we are a rather rich nation, has run ashore or gone down because of
the shape they were in.

To recap wath you said of the pirates on wood sail ships. They could
repair hull damage with wood and nails, but this work was propably not as
good as it would be if the damage was repaired at a shipyard in England.
This is the same, but I guess it comes down to how you see the ships built

This is what I\'d call \'State sponsored piracy\' - the local State, really
doesnt give a damn and is in effect a freeport. If the State did give a
damn, then the first failed attempt to use forged papers would have got you
arrested and in the slammer awaiting trial.

Again, this requires passive State support. But it\'s a neat scam.

That works just as well for ships about to engage in barratry - stock up on
a really high value cargo, then skip out.

A variant on this is the old \'fake broker\' trick. You contract to carry
cargoes from place to place, the redirect them en route to a third port,
where they are sold, with you pocketing the proceeds, quietly closing your
office and moving to another jurisdiction.

A second variant is the old \'we wuz robbed\' trick. You quietly drop off
somewhere, sell your cargo and claim it was taken by pirates.

A third variant is the old \'meet you at x\' trick. You pre-arrange a meeting
with the pirates, get paid up front, get shot up a little, surrender, lose
your cargo and then claim \'we wuz robbed\', but this time with evidence.

You\'re quoting retail rather than wholesale. I\'d say you\'d get 1/3 of those
prices.

I once had a flatmate who worked in an international freight company, and
he claimed by manipulating paperwork he could steal 2 000 tons of peanuts
overnight. Of course, they would be sitting in a warehouse in East Africa ...

The critical issue in stealing the cargo vs stealing the ship is what I
call \'cargo density\' - how valuable is the cargo per cubic meter. Vanilla
traveller cargos are very low density (circa KCr 10 per displacement ton)
compared to Traveller cargo ships (circa KCr 500 per displacement ton).

A major difference between RW and Traveller shipping is that in the real
world, ships spend much to almost all of their space outside the sensor
range of ports. Traveller sensors easily extend to the 100 diameter limit,
and there is no reason for any merchant ship to go far outside that limit
during normal operations. Needless to say, IMO hanging out just outside the
100 diameter visit gets you a couple of messages from the local
authorities, followed up by a visit from a patrol craft.

My view is that what piracy happens happens in the Outsystem, especially to
(and by) Belters, Moon Miners and other such lowlives. Any merchant ships
going to such places will go there armed for bear, and will be paid
appropriate risk premiums for their trouble (you can just forget about
Cr1000 per dton in an area of known pirate activity). Therefore in a very
real sense, merchant would be able to choose the riskiness of their
operations.

The global market is actually an advantage for piracy. I can think of five
ports off the top of my head where the authorities are either for rent or
dont care (Bombay, Karachi, Jakarta, Shanghai and Mombassa).

I\'m actually in final design on a Jump-3 500 dt freighter with 15 external
grapples for 15 dton subcraft. Fully loaded, it does a jump-2. Why 15 dtons
? Well, thats the size of Svennson Small Craft\'s *excellent* 15 dton Wasp

on 15 15 dton fuel or cargo shuttles, which will take the total cargo
capacity up to about 424 dtons (the ship costs about MCr170 without
sub-craft, including 214 dtons of internal cargo and 10 passengers in small
staterooms).

Nope. The plane had a rear boarding ramp. He\'d had them extend it and
fly slow. At *some* point he jumped from there. Jumping from a hatch is
a good way to get mangled in the tail assembly.

Well, he didn\'t lose the money in a real estate deal. Because they had
the serial numbers for all the bills and the only ones that *ever*
turned up were those mangled ones they found. So if he survived, he\'s
holding onto the money. If he spent *any* of it, it\'d be a red light as
soon as it hit a bank.

Heck, that happened *several* times. A more popular point to swim for

But would a pirate want a new identity, or does he want his name in the

And how many will stop after getting a 9MCr profit from a raid. They\'ll
feel invoulvnerable and go on and on until caught. I think this is the
way many succesful criminals are. Their intelligent, arrogant and feel
supirior.

Using current technology as a guide, a Fusion Power Plant is not likely to
explode.  If too much or too little fuel if fed to it, it will simply stop
fusing.  If magnetic containment is lost, there will be a little melting of
the physical container, but in general the *heat* energy of the plasma
(i.e. fusion no longer contained is no longer fusion, usually) is
relatively low since its of a very thin density.

If there is a problem with the hydrogen fuel feed, or if the Fusion reactor
shuts down, but the fuel flow continues (several safeties would need to be
disabled) you could eventually get a pretty good hydrogen explosion,
assuming the presence of sufficient oxygen.

The best method of causing a big explosion in my opinion would be a
gravitic drive failure on final approach.  A few thousand tons (wt.) of
starship with tanks full of hydrogen travelling at velocities of just a few
tens of meters per second would create quite a bit of havoc.

In My Probably Heretical But The Players Enjoyed It Traveller Universe:

"Pirate" encounters could actually be Pirates, Commerce Raiders,
or StarMercs on local war contracts. For purposes of this discussion,
we\'ll limit "Pirate" to mean independent or small groups of ships 
acting illegally and taking ships as their primary criminal activity.

It\'s hard to take someone else\'s ship with you after you board it.
Manpower problems (you can\'t make a ship jump without 
a navigator on board), frequent lack of fuel aboard the target vessel,
and the ability of many shipmasters to lock out all but the most
professional hackers from their computers tend to remove the ship
itself as a target. Also, selling a ship requires some pretty specialized
contacts due to the long paper trail involved - some pirate crews can
do it, most find it too involved and more dangerous than taking the ship
in the first place.

(Groups who _do_ have the manpower and expertise to crack into
ship\'s computers, kill the crew, fly off with the ship and sell it for
a profit don\'t risk their lives in space combat - they form hijacking
teams and ride as passengers. They usually have to take the ship
before it enters jumpspace (so they can pick the destination), but
they like to strike during jump preparations because that\'s when the
crew and the computer are busiest.)

The "average" pirate will be a small (100 to 400 ton) jump-capable
vessel. Type S Scout ships are minimally capable for this task,
but are popular because they are ubiquitous, often travel with no
flight plans, have oddball paper trails as a normal course of business
and (IMTU at least) can be kept barely functional without seeing a
class-B startport for years - though at a cost of steadily increasing
field maintenance efforts.

A variety of 400-ton range vessels are the more common pirate,
usually mutinied patrol cruisers or starmerc commerce raiders that
ran out of war or were otherwise cashiered - the StarMerc that can\'t
get contracts anymore because of incompetence or inability to follow
the rules is a popular image of the "Classic Pirate", and does exist
though is rare. Mutinied patrol vessels occur with some frequency 
because the officers of such vessels are the least competent or least
experienced in the Navy (experienced and competent ones get
to command Destroyers and up). Further, the crews of such vessels
tend to be people that aren\'t doing well in the big happy family of the
Navy. Note that "Navy" here means the Subsector & Sector Navies - 
the Imperial Navy does a better job at maintaining it\'s reputation as
professionals, even at the patrol vessel level.

Patrol Cruisers, BTW, aren\'t front-line combat vessels - they are
designed as long-duration multi-role ships, able to do everything
from search & rescue to boarding of suspected smugglers.
The enforcement of red-zones against ethically-challenged
free trader captains can be great training for a Patrol Cruiser
crew - the skills and actions needed are almost identical to what
they\'ll need after they mutiny and take up piracy. ;)

(Note that the average patrol vessel encountered is Subsector or Sector
Navy, colonial ships. Imperial patrols are only encountered around
Impie Navy bases and operational fleets, or the occaisional anti-piracy
sweep or patrol maneuvers. The fact that Impie patrol squadrons will
do anti-piracy sweeps through areas already at least nominally patrolled
by local forces shoould show you what the Impies think of local 
capabilities. The free trader is ambivalent about the situation - Impies
are good at clearing out pirates, but tend to perform board & inspect
more often, which can make the free trader a bit nervous.)

The Imperial Scout Service has lost a few X-Boat Tenders to pirates.
These ships often make long trips to outlying systems to pick up
misdirected X-Boats, and some of these systems turn out to be
more dangerous than expected. These ships would be used as
mobile bases of operations, rather than as attack ships in their
own right.

Pirates will usually try to create a base of operations to perform
repairs, stockpile supplies and store stolen cargos. Asteroids are
popular, due to the distance from gravity wells and how lonely the
average asteroid is. The asteroid will be hollowed out, chunks from
a captured ship will be welded into it (hatches, power plant,
life support, etc) and it will be ready for action.

This kind of jury-rigged building and maintenance are a hallmark of
all but the best-connected pirates. Annual maintenance, battle
damage repairs, even refits are performed under dangerous,
difficult and poorly-equipped conditions, kind of like a medic
performing field surgery on someone who ought to be in a hospital.
Burn-scarred, maimed pirates are not just the stuff of holovid shows - 
pulling a fusion plant with nothing but a chopped-down air-raft is
_dangerous_.

Mainly due to this kind of abuse, pirate vessels won\'t last the hundreds
of years one might get out a well-maintained ship. In a hard fight
with a Patrol Cruiser, it\'s likely to be a system that fails under the 
stress of relatively minor damage that kills the pirate ship. 

Note for the "must swim with the fishes" people out there: the
average pirate ship will _never_ call at a starport that has any kind
of legal controls or Imperial presence. It will never, except at long ranges
or in the most cursory manner, be able to play the role of honest
merchant - and it works within these limitations.

Pirates make arrangements with criminal groups or even individual
smugglers to buy cargos they have stolen. They keep what they
need for their jury-rigged ship repairs, and hope for the big haul - 
except that the mind-set that leads someone into being a pirate
often has the big haul make them overconfident, so they go for
a bigger one.

A ship hunted by a pirate can expect the following to happen:

1) Some deception may occur. A pirate may pretend to be
a customs or patrol vessel - a deception that will not last long,
but may allow the first stages of an intercept to occur. Stealth
capabilites, for those pirates lucky enough to have them,
are made use of.

2) Calling for help will probably do little good, unless they can delay
the pirate through unexpected thrust capabilities or good battle
tactics/weaponry - many of which will make the pirate give up anyway,
unless desperation or prospect of an unusually great haul perks up the
pirate\'s courage. The target was detected by the pirate too far from help,
either due to a minor misjump outside the usual traffic lanes or because
the target is in a place where patrols don\'t go. Or perhaps something
has already happened to the local patrol ship - if the planet Pinata
only has two Patrol Ships, and five or six pirates club together to
bushwhack the patrol, they\'ll have free rein of the system (away from
whatever planetary defenses there might be) for weeks.

3) The pirate will intercept. She may order the target to cut engines
pretty early - high-speed passes won\'t get you cargo, but they will
wreck your merchant ship. It\'s easier to intercept a target if you don\'t
care about relative velocities at intercept, but impossible to board
a ship unless you match velocities - the threat of a battle pass should
suffice to keep the target from evading, or even get the target to
maneuver to redezvous with you.

4) The merchant will be boarded. Some pirate vessels have
(or the merchant will think they have) too small a crew to force
a boarding - the loss of the boarding party might leave the pirate
ship too undermanned to keep the merchant from escaping, even
from right under it\'s guns. This will lead to merchant passengers 
or crew, in some situations, to resist the boarding party. Considering
how many interstellar travellers will be wealthy/noble (and have
bodyguards) or will be military/ex-military, this happens more often
than you might think. Considering how many pirate vessels have
severe manpower problems, this works more often than you might
think. A rare, though not unheard-of occurance is for a merchant to
come to port with a captured pirate ship right behind it.

5) The merchant will be looted. Damage (to the ship and people aboard)
will often depend on how much trouble they gave the pirate.
Depending on the time factor, varying amounts of looting will occur.
The ship\'s safe may be cleaned out, usually with the help of the
Shipmaster or Chief Purser (obtained at gunpoint). Personal weapons,
vacc suits, spare parts, even ship\'s vehicles or craft may be stolen.
Cargo will be a prime target, though the lack of starport loading
facilities will hamper this somewhat - you may see improvised cargo
transfer gear on a pirate ship. Passengers and crew may be molested,
robbed, even raped or kidnapped - the last depending on the pirate crew\'s
connections and capabilities. If a pirate finds the winner of the Miss
Regina Beauty Pageant on board, he might decide to kidnap her now
and figure out the multi-millon Credit ransom scheme later, even if he
doesn\'t currently have the capabilities to conduct ransom negotiatons.

6) The Pirates will go their merry way. Their target will need some
restocking and repairs, but won\'t be destroyed - unless they resist,
in which case as an object lesson their ship might be left a gutted
hulk, perhaps with them adrift in a life boat or vacc suit - perhaps not.

The objective of all but the most psychopathic (or fanatic) pirate is
taking ship\'s cargos (and the occaisional ship) for money, _not_ killing
people. Killing happens, but is usually bad for business - Impie attention
starts to come to bear much faster.

Note that IMTU Hijackers are seen as a more dangerous threat than
pirates, though piracy is more common - and Hijackers (if identified)
make it closer to the top of Imperial MoJ most wanted lists than pirates
do, because the average outcome of a successful Hijacking is a missing
ship and 100% mortality rate for it\'s passengers and crew. There is also
a cultural factor - someone who sneaks aboard your ship in port 
under a false name to murder you and steal your ship is seen as more
of a monster than the somewhat romanticized pirate who catched you
in open space and leaves you with your life, and your ship. IMTU there
is a cultural bias strongly against those who abuse people\'s trust to
this extreme (as any slow-communication feudalized society would have
such a bias). The pirate made you no promises, even implied ones - 
he caught you and robbed you "fair and square". Cold comfort for the
impoverished ship captain, to be sure, but the bias still exists.

Impie patrol cruisers, of course, have no patience for or romantic notions
about pirates, and no respect for them whatsoever - even to the point
of underestimating them on occaision. Their definition of "pirate"
can also be a bit fuzzy at times, so many independent merchants are
leery of "Imperial Entaglements". Subsector and even Sector patrol
cruisers are usually more respectful of the threat.

Being a pirate is dangerous, risky, and a bad idea. Many people find it
the best choice from a list of really bad ones, or are good at making
bad choices - or even good at making bad choices work out.

in the Spinward Marches. It makes the same points of
economics that have been made in recent TML posts.
However, it does list the systems in the Marches which could
provide a setting for piracy (as far as the author was
concerned). Although I don\'t have the JTAS with me at work, 
there were a total of 5 systems in which a low Law Level was
combined with a Class B starport. This, in the author\'s mind,
was enough to provide an area which would support piracy. I
believe the Wochiers system was one of them.

My take is that any such system would need to combine
either a low Law Level *or* the "proper" Govt. Type (such as
an impersonal bureaucracy) with at least a Class B starport
and a TL capable of processing the pirated goods. Finally,
there shouldn\'t be a space naval base in the system. The
Ilium system in the Darrian subsector would be my idea
of one possibility.

Personally, I belong in the "piracy is an occasional thing
outside of war" camp.

  MCr 1 might get you a shiny new Imperial ID; I strongly suspect that
a planetary ID could be a tenth that or less, particularly if they have
no reason to believe that the Imperium really wants to find you. If the
background is such that buying a new ID on Porozlo (for ex) costs MCr 1,
then the bribery and corruption bandied about as an aide to piracy will
simply be uneconomic.

  Politicals will have the problem of attracting a more vigorous
response if their agenda becomes known (usually part of the point).
But the source of dedicated personnel stands as useful and valid.

  It\'s good for providing boarding parties, but the minimum number
of crew is determined by the need to fill skilled positions.

Which would contribute to the pirates taking cargo instead of
ships - they have plenty of bully-boys, but only one guy who can
navigate a jump. And since that is a salable skill, this navigator
must have some compelling reason for hiding out with these
space scum.

Maybe he\'s already wanted for something else? Or did he get his
spacer\'s license (if YTU has such a thing) yanked?

Imagine a guy who would do anything to stay in space, gets his
license yanked - the only way he can work on a ship is in the
grey area of the law anyway. If he has it in for some of the 
merchant ships in the area (disgruntled employee of a local
shipping line?), he might be interested in taking it out on some
ships...and he might have some info that would make piracy easier,
at least against certain targets or in a certain area.

On the subject of intelligence, consider this: the Executive Officer
of a Patrol Cruiser mutinies and takes his crew with him. He\'ll have
some time before he is "posted as overdue and presumed lost", 
and he might have access to lots of information about patrol tactics,
communications, codes and deployments - info that won\'t be useful
forever, but might be the edge he and his crew will need to keep
them alive while they\'re learning. Add to that the list of secret 
resupply caches he liberates from the ship\'s papers, and his crew
might be in business.

I think there is some merit to the last sentence above.  I may
contribute to a flame war, but I think that there would be Class B ports
that would do his maintenance and welcome his cargoes.  A little graft
and greasing of palms, and you have the blind eye turned to the ship. 
Sure, you would have to have some people on the take at high levels, but
even then, I think it would (should?) be easier than we think.  If you
are concerned about the local system, then you need to have a way to
ensure that the powers that be won\'t be interested in you while you are
in port.  Maybe you buy a computer entry that says your "inspections"
are all up to date, have someone at the Port Authority authorize repairs
to "that ship", have the higher ups just approve the work...

Yeah, I pretty much agree.  I think that true pirate ships won\'t be the
best cared for ships, unless under state sponsorship.  Often times,
crews were slovenly, and only held in check by the meanness of the
leader, not real loyalty.  For NPC pirates, it\'s not as important where
the maintenance is done, but for PCs, then the rates of misjumps should
be quite a bit higher, and continue to get worse until they can bribe,
force, beg maintenance...

But how do you determine how many people can afford to spend
money on spaceflight?  Bell curves?  Estimates?

The average Earth Joe may spend 1% on total travel expenses
per year; significantly less, then, would go to star flight.
If I spent 0.1% of my salary on spaceflight, and travelled
my parsecs in High Passage, I\'d be making money like so:

Jumps/yr	Income
1/10		Cr 25,000
1/4		Cr 62,500
1		Cr 250,000
2		Cr 500,000
4		MCr 1

It looks like folks wouldn\'t be travelling the stars unless they 
had a need to -- it\'s expensive and slow.

I could really use a nice formula telling me how much money is
spent on star travel by a world\'s inhabitants... how about
0.1% of the GWP measured in Imperial Credits.  Divide that into
Cr6000 avg per traveller or whatever -- and you have total people 
travelling per year.
Treece would be: 
	Pop 600,000,000, D starport, TL 8
	GWP:          6,000,000,000,000 local
	              3,250,000,000,000 Imperial

                                540,000 Travellers per year
                                 10,000 Travellers per week

Also, these numbers won\'t make sense (IMHO) unless there\'s
another world nearby to compare to... which means this 10,000
people would divide out over all possible destinations.  If 
0.1% is reasonable, then the article Jon and I worked out still
seems to hold, for those 10,000 would spread out among all
possible destinations.

Improperly packed flour is explosive, especially in an oxygen-rich

  Speaking of hard SF, it looks like TSR\'s new Alternity game (while
a neat design) simply isn\'t competing for that market. Presumably this
is a marketing decision to provide an SF alternative to the gothic and
black clad supernatural superhero gamers. OTOH, it may simply be due to
the lack of designers willing to take on developing a self-consistent
hard SF universe (although the Star Frontiers background had its\' good
points).

  Their 20-page adventure in Dungeon (ab AD&D mag, BTW) has all the 
howlingly funny hallmarks that one expects from a TSR effort at a 
space good. Good space opera, but space opera nonetheless.

The Star*Drive setting for Alternity is intentionally space-operatic.
Theoretically, the rules can be used for any sci-fi setting you like.

While I think the rules system is pretty cool, I think the designers are
trying too hard to come up with nifty ways to say things so they don\'t sound
like the same thing in other games.  For example, what you and I know as
gravitics, they call "gravitonics."  Instead of good old-fashioned
anti-matter reactors, they\'ve come up with "mass reactors," which generate
energy through "dark matter."  (Don\'t get me started on what this means to
the MACHO vs. WIMPS debate. ;)  ) Instead of hyperspace/jumpspace, we have
"drivespace," ad infinitum.

Seriously, it wouldn\'t be TOO hard to create a hard sci-fi universe with
Alternity, but you\'d have to do some serious rules-weeding, and you would
never be happy if you were a real gearhead (starship "compartments,"
anyone?).  While reading the books, I kept getting the feeling that I was
reading "Advanced Star Wars."

I thought about starting a flame-war by suggesting Alternity:Traveller . . .

Add to that the complications of 2d vector aiming, and you can see why the

  The big problem I have with taking cargo over ships is that it seems
a wildly sub-optimal course of action (except for a casual who didn\'t
luck into the richer possibility). Why not go the extra distance (and
take an extra risk implied) get the big bucks, cash out, buy a new
identity and start a new life - maybe even buying your own ship?

  It\'s a one-time "I\'m outta here" sort of event compared to a plan
of repeated chicken stealing which is more likely to end in failure
than success; and each cargo-robbing (from a starship) has the potential
to become a career completing ship theft. I have a lot of trouble seeing
why such a rational course of action wouldn\'t be followed.

>On the subject of intelligence, consider this: the Executive Officer

  I\'d consider that (IMTU) to be an extremely rare recruiting incident
compared to casuals, psychos, hijackers, intruding Vargr, or just very
well organized criminals. It\'s a skill set that might easily be imported
by Vargr or ex-military (Sworld Worlders in the SM?); OC, many merchant
crew may be ex-military or serving reservists.

  All of this begs a question about the personnel structure of the various
navies; are the majority of crew short-timers (conscripts?) or is a large
proportion of the crew going to have lots of time in grade?

  By definition, the vast majority of traffic (at least by tonnage)
is to high-traffic systems whose mainworld security will be pirate
proof. Traffic being low at some time would require statistical
anomalies that are only really possible at truly backwater worlds
(not to say that it doesn\'t happen). This technique, _even in the
absence of another traffic security system_, simply reduces the
practical traffic horizon at which mainworld piracy can be believed
that much lower.

  How many days in advance do you have to announce your destination to
acquire passengers? From the 14 day trip, probably 4-5 days to get the
full #\'s indicated on the chart. Quite possibly the same for standard
uses of various cargo/freight charts.

  My suggestion is that your prescribed anti-piracy regime would be

patrol vessels.

  It requires a ship, yes. If one is not available, then no message
can be sent. If one is, the cost is probably trivial: a local mail
courier company could rent a Dt of cargo for KCr 1 on the next (at
least vaguely reputable) ship, send 10-14 m^3 of mail, massing 5
to 15 metric tons, and make a profit on Cr 0.20 to 0.25 /kg - have
you tried sending a pair of six-sided dice to Alaska via UPS? A Trav
starship with a blown J-drive on a real backwater could probably
undercut the local shipping industry by a huge margin.

  Unless one assumes that a Dt of cargo is 1000kg _maximum_ then
Trav cargo is cheap. For capital equipment, 2300 AD cargo density
gives 42,000 kg per Dt. (Hey, what\'s recyclable paper amd cardboard
worth these days?)

Active sensors generally have two major advantages over passive sensors:
1)  Active sensors are good at determining range and velocity to/away from the
sensor.  Passive sensors are at best very bad at it -- two high-grade (1
microradian resolution) sensors 30 meters apart can\'t determine range at all
beyond 1 BL hex, and at 1 hex have a margin of error of roughly a factor of 2. 
An active sensor of comparable quality can probably determine range to within
100 meters.
2)  Active sensors are good at noise reduction -- they know exactly what
frequency they\'re emitting, so they can restrict their scanning to receiving
within that frequency (or a reasonable doppler shift).  As a result, you don\'t
have to filter all the bright objects in the sky to figure out which ones are
ships -- bright objects are virtually guaranteed to be nearby objects, and thus
also pretty much by definition \'interesting\'.  This is really more of a factor
for sensors in atmosphere -- picking up aircraft against a blue sky (or, even
worse, trying to pick up items near atmospheric temperature with a thermograph)
is extremely difficult.

Neither is specifically a reason to use an AEMS -- a better reason is that if
you have annoying people hiding in various sorts of opaque atmospheres (such as
within a gas giant atmosphere), they\'re invisible to just about everything
except radar (they aren\'t visible to lidar).  In the DSR rules, it should be
noted at LIDARs generally use dust, atmospheric, and other obscurement-related
penalties appropriate to the visual signature (or IR signature, depending on
design), not the radar signature.

Redundant sensors make military sense -- however, it isn\'t necessarily
impractical to harden sensors either, flashing a sensor with a laser is likely
to only burn out one or two pixels (or none at all, if not focused in that
direction; also, most sensor mirrors don\'t reflect X-rays too well, so an X-ray
laser might need to be close enough to do damage) and you might well have
enough warning before being hit by a spray of KKMs sand (I\'d guess that\'s what
you\'re talking about for \'scrubbing\') to just cover your sensors.  Alternately,
the capabilities of deflectors are (to me, at least) somewhat unclear, so you
might be able to just focus a deflector to keep sand away from your sensor.

A couple of my friends have just got it. It looks like a good set of rules

Who says that a man (or woman) that chooses to go pirate is a rational
human being. You seem to implie that everybody thinks rationally all the
time, but the fact is that there is millions out there in the real world
today that propably never thought a rational thought their entire life. 

A pirate might have hundreds of reasons to do what they do, and for every
successful ship that goes pirate there is propably a lot that never make
it. I don\'t think that it is as easy as you implie. Take the ship, make
the profit (hopefully), buy new identity and start a new life. Just look
at the guy that molested two girls in Belgium. He got caught, and while in
prison he thought out a plan and escaped while reading his courtpaper,
which he had a right to do. He thought himself supirior to everybody, and
actually had intelligence enough to do something about it. Fourtunally he
got caught again, but the result of the escape was the resignation of two
high offical in the justice department or police department.

A "crazy" pirate with a goal and intelligence is going to be a real hazzel
for everybody, just because he thinks that he can make it. And he propably
will for a while, and with luck on his side he can go a far far way.

I really don\'t think that it is that unlikely. Every see that move with
Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. Nuclear sub at sea. Gets message that
something is going on. Communications broke. Fire or not? Take this a step
further because of the delay in orders. Captains on ships might beleave
that the Zhodani has gotten their HQ. No communication? Who is friend or
foe. Given the size of the fleet, there is bound to be some paranoid
captain that given enough stress will flip and see enemies everywhere. Not
many crews will diobey direct orders from their captain IMTU.

I would quess that small ships with small crews will have people tha have
been in the service for some while. While larger ships will have a larger
turnover in their ensigns. Just my opinion.

Well, ironically this is not worse than a policeman faced in
determining if a car was stolen before they all had access
to computer records (and before they had radios they couldn\'t
even check for cars that were wanted _right now_).  It
worked to provide a significant deterant for years providing
one situation in which stealing a car was not a sure thing.

We get caught up in the way we do things today and forget
that it isn\'t the only possible way.

That could be a complication.  You don\'t see military ship
doing this to bypass worlds.  In any case, you have a potential
for a lot more problems than people smuggling things into
the Imerium (and entire Vargr raiding fleet, or a Zhodani
invasion fleet, would be able to strick deep into the
Imperium without warning).  My guess it that the Imperium
does what the US does (since the US doesn\'t have boarders any
tighter and also isn\'t willing to stop and search every
vehicle that travels inside the US), it has agents outside
the boarders keeping an eye on those who would bring such
things in.

Well, I thing the threat of reprisals is generaly used more
than active prevention in the Imperium.  Which is why I
don\'t see them using inspections.  If they can prevent
people from using nukes on the plane they were made, stolen,
etc. then they can use the same method on nukes from
different planets without disrupting trade.

I don\'t agree.  You are talking about intrusive inspection
of every ship on every jump.  Nukes can be shield.

>  Inspections (cursory/external or on-site) can be done at starports

I don\'t beleive cursory inspections are even going to come
close to stoping the movement of nukes.

> From the internal security POV,

Well, first of all, the need not to inspect all ships, at
all times, to provide a deterent is something that I agree
with.  However, for nukes the Imperium appears to desire
to prevent any occurences by people (enemy agents, terrorists,
etc.) that are willing to take some significant risk.  
Random inspections won\'t work here.

However, I do agree that inspections of occasional
suspicous ships would be a deterant to piracy and could
be one part of the program that keeps it down to reasonable
levels.

There is a big gap between not having enough time to even
take cargo and being able to fix battle damage.  Also, if
you take cargo you just need to chase the crew into staterooms
and lock them in.  If you take the whole ship you have to
deal with taking the crew (in a way that they don\'t know
enough to testify against you later) or killing them
(upping the profile of the crime and the level of effort
that will be spend in catching you).  Probably not enough
to say that one will never take the ship, but, in my mind,
enough to say that a alot might not.

My guess is that you either find a corrupt maintenance facility
or you get a good fake ID.  My guess is that if you are
taking ships in piracy, you will actually sell them as
parts rather than as whole ships (like they do with stolen
cars).

Well, he only needs odinance if he uses missles.  He may
not get a lot of battle damage if he takes on unarmed
ships.  And in any case he can just say he was attacked
by pirate :-)

Well, not the whole port, only one repair facility, and then
only if he can\'t pass for a legit ship.

There is also the possibility of a "join or die!" option given to
certain members of the captured crew.  An astrogator, engineer or
technician wouldn\'t have much choice if given that option, and as long
as they were watched closely, and were badly outnumbered aboard the
ship that "shanghaied" them would have a tough time resisting. 
Sabotage would be a quick way to die..if the sabotage itself didn\'t
get you the pirates would..and trying to take the ship or escape
wouldn\'t be an easy thing to do.

After some time with the pirates it might be too late to escape or "go
straight" in any case.  Imagine pirates publishing the real id\'s of
their crews...now try convincing the authorities you were "forced" to
plot those courses, or repair that jump drive.

OR

He needs two or more ships that are essentially identical that he\'ll
swap systems in. He takes ship A in for annual maintenance at planet
Z--and then swaps subsystem Q to ship B.  Ship A with "suddenly out of
tune port floozit" now goes in for maintenace at planet Y.  By
choosing Z and Y to be in, for example, the Sword Worlds and the
Imperium, you lessen the likelihood of exchange of maintenace info and
attendant curiousity from authorities/manufacturers.

I am assuming that it is relatively easy to swap these
sub-systems--this would be an activity for the discussed pirate
bases, not for deep space. ("Joe, I *told* you not to pull the air
exchanger!  Blam, Blam." :-))

Um no.  by definition "more" traffic has to be to high traffic
worlds.  But this doesn\'t even require that the majority
of traffic be to such systems (let along the "vast majority")

Second of all, even from high traffic systems, certain
destinations can be uncommon and it is quite possible, even
along medium traffic routes, to have several ships
leave one day and then have none for the next week.

Debatable.  In CT you anounce you destination an then
passengers sign on, impling they wait for ships to show
up.  This is particularly likely to be true in systems
were ships are less common.  I don\'t see any reason why
you always have to wait for cargo, but even if you 
did, you aren\'t sure when you will fill up so you will
_still_ have the situation of not wanting to hang around
waiting for another ship to leave first once you get
that last bit of cargo.  (What you are requiring is
that you have some time you need to wait after you have
gotten your last passenger and cargo before you leave).

Well, you are not restricting yourself to only leaving after
a ship that is an X-boat or is carrying an agent or passenger
you can trust with the info.  More delays ensue.

Yes, we have established that we don\'t agree on this....

From what I recall of the article, they all had government type 0, and were 
outside the Imperium or other intersteller governments.

I suppose I can reach over and grab my JTAS:

   Thanber (Querion 0707)
   Tremous Dex (Vilis 0501)
   Debarre (Darrian 0810)
   Asteltine (District-268 0101)
   Trexalon (District-268 0509)

I wish I could find my Classic-era Spinward Marches book; according to DGP\'s 
Rebellion-era listings, all the above gained governments, with the exception 
Asteltine.

Agreed.  It probably takes a day in port to unload a cargo, load
another, take on passengers, fuel the ship and take on any supplies it
needs.  Ship\'s might spend another day or two in port, but I don\'t
think they\'d *normally* spend more time on the ground than that.

Merchant ships average about 1 jump every two weeks.  IMTU, it takes
slow ships a day or more to get to and from the jump point..and that\'s
*best* case.  Even fast merchant ships use about twelve hours getting
to and from a jump point.  Combining that with three or four days in
port and you\'re talking about a week between jumps, but only two or
three of those days are in port.

"balancing the books" is enforced by the *universe* my friend. We\'re
saying that *nobody* can keep one putting out more than they are taking
in.

For example, your comment about LS costs is a good example. If they are
stealing the LS from the ships they are hitting, then they *have* to
hit a ship every few weeks. Because ships generally don\'t carry a lot
of extra life support. Not "normal grade" life support anyway. And the
pirates would get *real* tired of emergency rations and and the
emergency air and water recycling measures. 

Yes, it\'s a good idea to steal things like life support materials and
anything you can use to help maintain your own ship. But it\'s a *bad*
idea to be *dependent* on such. Because there *will* come a day when
that dependence either forces you to go after a ship when you\'d really
rather not, or worse yet, you wind up in deep trouble because there\'s
no ship around when you *need* one.

It\'s why you don\'t see a lot of pirates using larger vessels in the
real world. Between fuel requirements, and maintenance requirements you
wind up limited to the size vessel that can be maintained with an
ordinary machine shop. 

It\'s easy to refuel a vessel that uses regular gas or diesel. A big
ship that uses something like bunker C is useless unless you\'ve got
port officials somewhere who will look the other way. Traveller is a
lot more friendly this way. 

But you still hit a snag on any vessel above some fairly small size, as
they *must* have components to big to work on in anything but a
shipyard. And I\'d say that\'s why there are annual maintenance visits
required. 

Sure, it makes things a lot harder for pirates IN THE CENTER OF THE
IMPERIUM. On the other hand, in Vargyr space nobody gives a damn unless
it\'s one of *their* ships you\'ve raided. Likewise in frontier areas.

So a pirate could operate in or from the Vargyr extents, just making
sure that he doesn\'t raid anybody from the (very) pocket empire that
he\'s using as a base.

Or in frontier areas, you may have some planet that\'s more interested
in the cargo you can bring in than in how you get it. This would
require a ship of a tech level that they can help you maintain, but
that just changes the odds a bit.

Now there is a possibility I\'ve discussed in the past. Find a lost
"calibration point" base from before the long night. Especially if it
has a repair & retrieval type ship (think of a battle rider\'s tender,
but intended to retrieve and do major repairs on ships that got their
jump drives damaged). Such wouldn\'t be enough to completely substitute
for a shipyard for "big" ships (10,000 and up) but for the type of
ships players or pirates are using it could, give a supply of parts.
Which the base would also have, albeit old-fashioned ones. 

Finding something like that could tempt someone.

It\'s pretty well established that the X-boat system *does* carry
non-government mail. Think of it as being the Imperial Postal Service.
Government stuff has *priority*. But carrying private and commercial
traffic helps keep the Imperium together.

Ever read Piper\'s \'Space Viking\'?  In it, the good guys (and the bad guys too) 
*built* their own spaceports & bases.  What\'s to stop a pirate from building 
his own B or C port in some out of the way place like an asteroid belt or in 
the Kuiper Belt of a fair to middlin tech system?  Such a base would be 
*perfect* for annual refits and maintanance.

Question is, how much would one of these bases *cost*?

A scenario for you, if you will.  A group of larcenous violent minded 
individuals (i.e., PC\'s) decide to go at piracy in a Big Way.  They set up a 
front trading company on some mid-tech world.  Law level is unimportant.  They 
use this front company to filter stolen goods back into the mainstream, after 
redoing paperwork on them.  They scam up enough front money to *BUY* the 
equipment to build their hideaway port, then ship it in their own hulls to the 
place they want to build.  Once it\'s built, they move the equipment to other 
out of the way places and build resupply caches, and finally sell the stuff 
off to recoup some of their investment.  They hire talent from the mainstream 
after thourough backround checks for their \'darkside\' operations, looking for 
technical competence and contempt of lawful authority.  Depending on what the 
strike teams swiped, sell Zhodani-taken cargoes in the Sword Worlds, SW stuff 
in the Imperium, etc.  Unless of course you can properly sanitise the serial 
numbers.  <grin>

You\'d need some place to sit the boat down.  But it doesn\'t have to be a state 
of the art TL15 A port.

Or, just \'jack (or *BUY*) an XBoat tender for use as a portable \'factory & maintanance\' ship.  Big enough to do the job, hell, it\'s *DESIGNED* to do the job.  Just cop spares for the offbeat boats you have from any Class A or B yard that\'ll sell \'em, which should be just about any when you show them the cash.

Personally, I\'d think that if the pirate fleet is flying boats over 10KDT, they\'re looking for trouble.  Think *SMALL*.  1000DT or smaller, with the occaisional 5000DT tender/container freighter.

Now if somebody could explain where all those corsair ships come from...  <grin>

  How is the amount of evidence/info gained much different if
you leave the ship as opposed to removing it? Wouldn\'t the ship
itself actually contain potentially lethal info after the encounter,
and leaving it behind thus be more compromising?

Except the docks were heavily patrolled, and in those days a good place to
be sucked into a frieghter\'s screws.  Easier to let the tide carry you
towards the Golden Gate and try for the Marin shore, which was still mostly
wilderness.

I recall an article in one of the popular gaming mags some years back
(doesn\'t matter which one) which was comparing characters from the various
space RPGs. Traveller got the quote (paraphrased) "a game where the average
PC is little better than a terrorist."

Now I don\'t typically make up characters who are outright evil, and this
quote came back to me as I was leafing through a copy of the old CT
supplement "76 Patrons" yesterday.  Strangely, a good number (not all, but
quite a few) of the adventure seeds are along the lines of: a patron asks
the players to perform a kidnapping, steal something, run arms to
terrorists, hijack a ship, or even outright assassination.

Now, with the suggested (implied: recommended) type of activity for typical
characters being criminal in nature, I guess it\'s no wonder that Traveller
picked up this kind of rep. It\'s just my opinion, but I don\'t think that
characters necessarily have to be criminals to have exciting adventures in
the Imperium (though I\'m not knocking it if it\'s your kind of game).

Then I noticed that the "design" credit for the book is by no other than
Loren Wiseman - one of our participants here.  Now don\'t get me wrong - I\'m
not attacking Loren\'s work or anything. But since he\'s working on the
GURPS:Traveller project, I wondered if he might be enticed to comment on
how the new game "slants" characters. Is there any effort being made to
address this issue (i.e. that most characters soon end up as wanted
criminals) in the new incarnation of Traveller?

Anyone else care to comment?

Probably.  So, your 1KDT \'catcher\' ship pulls the wreck close enough to jump 
away with it.  If it\'s small enough to close the bay doors on it, say, up to 
maybe 4, 500 DT, your techs get to spend the next week stripping it out and 
cutting up the hull for scrap metal.  If it\'s not big enough to work on in 
shirtsleeves, they peel everything away from the walls that will fit in the 
hold of the catcher, and when the catcher gets into normal space in a 
relatively save place, cuts the hull up for scrap metal & stores everything in 
the cargo bay, or offloads it to one of the flotilla\'s cargo hulls.  <grin>

If you *can\'t* tie it down to a \'catcher\' ship, either fire up the manuver 
drives enough to send it either into the local star or into deep space at best 
speed.  Or rig it to jump to your hideout.  Or make it deliberately misjump.  
(grin)

High Guard Ed 2, p20, para 6:  A planetary navy may procure ships at any 
shipyard within the borders of its subsector; alternatively, a planetary navy 
may construct ships on its planet, using local resources, even if a shipyard 
is not present.

How I\'d do it would be to procure the weapons, weapon control, computer, and 
advanced fusion gear offworld, then put them into a locally-produced hull.  
Since it\'s a nonstarship, the TL 8 facilities won\'t be too much of a hassle.

Or a Marshall Plan deal.  Or the boats could be bought surplus after a 20-40 
year history with another navy.  This would cut down on building costs.

Homegrown boats are DEFINITELY local.  Presumably, stuff picked up on Marshall Plan/lend-lease deals from the subsector navy would be locally commanded but part of the subsector navy\'s reserve.  In case of war, jump-capable stuff might conceivably be called up, while the non-jump stuff would stay behind.

  Sure. However, I\'m going to need to see some substantial clinical data
before I concede that an irrational/mentally deficient individual is better
suited to operating such an exceedingly complicated operation as even a
single small pirate ship, let alone a sub-sector spanning crime ring.

  For most potential pirates economic motives have to be assumed,
which implies economic actions.

  My point is that getting to the liquid asset pay-off is the hardest part.
If the Imperium pays as little attention to starship regulation as most of
the other pro-piracy people insist, then why would the Imperium pay more
attention to a random private citizen of some forlorn planet?

  How many "crazy" would-be pirates will have ships? Presumably out and out
crazies and sociopaths will be filtered out after 5-10 years in either the
military or a merchant line. Admittedly, they might not notice in the IISS.

  The dynamics of the ratings skill-sets and the job market may require
that many positions be long-term careers with commensurate compensation.
Many of those other ranks will have social ties that make mutinying and/
or going pirate an unacceptable choice. That would make such a mutiny
exceedingly rare, and equally messy.

If you take the whole ship, you either have to kill the crew
(which ups the importance of the crime) or you have to interact
with them (letting them get a good look at you).

  Umm, yes. Look at/imagine the volumes of trade between worlds, with
some consideration to the economic predominance of the pop 9+ worlds.
I happen to have some problems with those models, but those are the
ones being kicked around.

  According to canon, there are single planets out there whose economies
exceed those of the bottom half or two-thirds (at least) of the 11,000
worlds in the Imperium _combined_. High-pop planets, and any system in
close proximity to them, will not be low or even medium traffic in any
meaningful sense of the word. Mr. Eaglestone\'s post on Jae Tellona
comes to mind.

>Second of all, even from high traffic systems, certain

>along medium traffic routes, to have several ships

  Statistically and economically unlikely. Some of the cargo
volume on any but the least travelled routes will be regular
runs, and several small companies running such could mean a
departure every day or two. Some analysis of the trade volumes
in a pairing would be needed for more conclusive discussion.

  Presumably in CT ships spent those extra days on the world doing
something; it\'s reasonable to conclude that it was business related.
Obviously the tramp freighters for whom the basic charts are designed
take passengers who can\'t or won\'t use regularly scheduled runs (as
you pointed out, there may not be any).

  While not stated clearly (IIRC) in the CT rules, presumably you can\'t
just wait around until your ship fills up, as both passengers and freight
have expected deadlines. If you know from arrival (or before) where you
expect to go, you announce destination and departure time and start getting
a load put together. If a ship is heading to your destination, you, a 
passenger, or someone acting on behalf of someone could send a message ahead.

  There is no requirement to delay your announced departure.

  If the passengers and freight are just waiting for you, why is turnaround
not much closer to the order of 9-10 days for those tight-margin tramps?

  Send a letter? Presumably the crew are too busy to read all of 
the several thousand (10,000\'s?) of messages they might carry as
physical or electronic cargo?

  What about the minor fact that this provides a wondeful supply of

  No, I\'m talking about random inspections at a level which provides
a state of security that the Imperium finds acceptable. The other is
possible, but leads more to an Orwellian Imperium, which wouldn\'t be
much fun unless playing the Rebels from Star Wars.

  How do you plan to shield your nukes?

  If you have a 5% chance of being searched and illegal nukes being
found, what penalty will be enough to make you not even consider the
risk? The vast majority of smugglers can be deterred with some variant
of that calculation.

  Good point. By choosing not to attempt controlling the sources,
you\'ve postulated an Imperium which has no real defense against 
nuclear terrorism. I can only assume that was your objective.

  The Scouts obviously have a budget (some for defense tasks)
but they also have an income from the x-boat operations.

  You think the Imperium runs all the starports? Why do they
not use that opportunity to at least cover costs? This would
also radically simplify internal security issues by allowing
regular (random?) inspections.

  The Imperium appears to favour preventing the landing of troops
by nuking troop transports. The Army seems to be a local responsibility,
with the Marines being the relevant parasites on the Navy budget.

  I\'m pretty sure that standards will cost less to administer
than, say, controlling and inspecting for nuclear weapons.

  The diplomatic corp may very well (at least from the M:0 POV)
cost exceedingly little; if you use the pre-20th C. British model
of using aristocrats in political posts (i.e., Parliament) then
paying them is not an issue, as they\'ll happily pay for the privilege
of exercising power and influence.

  All money taken in will be allocated, of course. The pressure
to lower taxes would seem very weak from your proposal on how to
address the implementation of a possible Jump-station system.

  Sounds good. While the bulk of R&D goes on at Imperial Research

developments (particularly applications to testbeds) should go on 
at Naval Depots, for example.

  Presumably security regulations do in fact specify firing
in such hostage taking situations. Otherwise the system is
hopelessly easy to compromise. The station being sufficiently
undergunned not to waste a small freighter effortlessly is
ridiculous; such a fuel station would serve many of the functions
of a high port, certainly enough to justify/require many thousands
of tons of fittings.

  If the fuel station were that helpless, it also becomes difficult
to see how anyone could argue that they wouldn\'t be a massive
strategic liability in case of war.

  As an economic crime, how often in the future would you
suggest that counting economic losses becomes unfashionable?

  If the Imperium doesn\'t consider piracy and hijacking serious
crimes, then the Imperium is a farce and canon is meaningless.
The primary purpose of this state, and its claim to legitimacy,
is its ability to secure interstellar space for the peaceful and
unmolested use of its citizens.

  FWIW, hijacking very likely involves multiple murderm which effectively
all societies have had the most serious sanctions against (although what
acts upon whom count is another thing).

  Being insured means that (in addition to covering the insurers costs
and profits) that if Something Bad Happens, you\'re not bankrupt. There
are terms in the business world for people who don\'t insure when they
can\'t afford the potential loss that they\'re risking.

  What you\'re suggesting is virtually impossible in your suggested
regulatory regime. Once a ship gets stolen by any means the ship is
seemingly home free, AFAI can tell.

  Let\'s take this more slowly. _Some_ inspections and _some_
patrolling will go a long way towards controlling the problems.
We\'ve already established that laise-faire in this context is
meaningless, so let\'s try decentralized. The Imperium runs very
few institutions, mostly prescribing limited regulations, and
except for the Navy and IISS leaving implementation to local
authorities.

  Presumably the Navy actually carries out some missions that would
be relevant to both its\' and the Imperiums excuse for existing. If
local authorities choose to add to that minimum (_not_ minimal) level
then that _is_ decentralized decision making in action.

Absolutely nothing as long as he can pay for the necessary resources. Now
all you have to do is to demonstrate that he can capture enough ships and/
or cargo to make it worth while.

>Question is, how much would one of these bases *cost*?

Well, we could try to work something out, but I warn you that I have to
make several assumptions.

A starport capable of servicing one 600 T ship at a time (I chose 600 T
because I have a number of 600 T ship designs lying around) would be able
to perform annual maintenance on 26 ships/year. The cost of each refit
would depend on the exact nature of the ship. An average of 19 designs
ranging from jump-1 to jump-3 comes to a tad over MCr153. Perhaps I should
have weighted the jump-1 designs higher than the jump-2 than the jump-3,
but I haven\'t, so the figure is propably higher than what is realistic.
Anyway, let\'s say this shipyard can gross Cr150,000/two weeks or
Cr3,900,000/ year. How much of that money goes to cover expenses (salaries,
spare parts, etc.)? I have no idea, so I have to make a guess. Let\'s say
that Cr450,000 goes to salaries (6-10 people at some really good salaries)
and another Cr450,000 goes to spare parts. That gives a return of investment
of Cr3,000,000/year. Assume the same kind of return as a spaceship (6.25%)
and you get an investment of MCr48. Assume a lower rate of return (because
the investment is less risky than a ship) and you get a higher required
investment. A good figure would IMO be 5%. That would give you a required
investment of MCr60 or MCr10/100 T of ship to be serviced. Easy to work with.
So a pirate base able to service any number of corsairs (up to 26) would cost
you MCr40 _plus_ whatever extra costs you get because you have to transport
all the equipment from the world of manufacture to the pirate lair.

Oh, you\'re talking about digging equipment, etc.? OK, that would be in
addition to the MCr50 I\'m talking about (which only covers the buildings
and machinery for performing annual maintenance plus a 20% surcharge to
cover transportation. And it dosen\'t cover the life support equipment
needed either).

So we\'re talking inflated salaries here?

If you capture Zhodani stuff in (say) Chronor subsector, then you\'re
adding the transport costs for hauling it about 12-15 parsecs. Assuming
jump-3 shipping and a four-jump route you\'re adding more than Cr6000/dT
to your expenses (twice that if your ship can\'t get a return freight).
Same principle applies to hauling SW stuff to the Imperium etc. (though
the exact figures vary, of course).

Since the average random Traveller cargo is worth about Cr5,000/dT that
would mean that you have to deliberately go for specific ships with
high-value cargoes in order to make that work, and that entails a whole
slew of added problems ranging from how you intercept specific ships
to said ships being more likely to be better armed than a normal ship
(and/or escorted). It still seems like a losing proposition to me.

Not so minor detail. Piracy has been a capital crime as long as law has
existed. I doubt that it\'ll quit being one in the future. So there
*isn\'t* any extra risk in offing the crew.

This gets *much* harder when you start dealing with large vessels that
are *not* produced in the multiple millions per model. The parts are
both more identifiable, and harder to get rid of because they are
"model specific".

And then they ask why all the damage is on the *bow* of the ship rather
than the stern. (ie why was he heading *towards* the pirate, rather
than running away :-)

Pretty much the whole port *admin* structure, as any port is going to
check transponder ID, and then check ships "papers" when it
docks/lands. 

After all, he can\'t afford to get repairs all *that* far from his area
of operation. So eventually news of a pirate that matches his ship\'s
description is going to be common knowledge at the port he\'s getting
repaired at. And his damage is going to match the reports. So either
folks will get suspicious leading to problems, or they have to know
what he\'s up to from the start.

Mind you, I think that a *non*-Imperium setting could do a nice job of
having pirates. Say something like the setting of most of Andre
Norton\'s SF. The "Guild" (think of the Mafia/Yakuza as a megacorp) is
powerful enough to have it\'s own bases in areas that non-guild folks
stay away from. And to have agents in the most unlikely places. :-)

I\'ve read Space Viking. Many times. It *tells* you what it costs. The
equipment for building the base was a major investment for his country
(Duchy?). The value of it was apparently equal to or greater than the
value of the ship!

Also, they were using rather larger ships. Where cargo capacity was
*not* a serious limitation.

Which is a good enough example of the existence of "crooked" ports.
The equivalent in Traveller would make piracy a *lot* easier.
Especially if they have one feature in common with most of those modern
ports. Volume of traffic. With a lot of traffic through the port, the
port officials can recognize the transponder squawk they issued to a
ship whose bribes are up to date, and direct it to some portion of the
port where it won\'t be noticed by snoppy visitors, and at the same time
manage to have an unfortunate "glitch" in the official sensor records.

BTW, some of this sort of thing is cultural. We aren\'t used to a
culture where accepting money to do your job (or to not do it) is
*expected*. So in that sort of culture, you can\'t really call the
officials "crooked". They\'re just following a different set of rules.
The main thing the pirate has to understand is that he needs to keep
his payments up to date, and that he\'s got to do his part to keep
things denyable.

This is due to the physics of drag. For vessels too big to "plane" any
of the hull, drag goes *down* as the hull gets longer. Thus a bigger
ship can go faster than a smaller one for the same power/weight ratio.

See above. The physics involved in space are quite different than those
that apply to surface vessels. Fighter aren\'t *significantly* faster
than ships. If you can get a 6-g manuever drive in that pirate vessel,
it\'s just as "fast" as any fighter, and can both absorb more damage and
dish out more.

How valuable depends on what it\'d cost you to ship in the hydrogen,
carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen from someplace else. That\'s the upper
limit on what a miner could get for it.

In a system with no habitable planets the ice and CHON would be very
valuable, as they\'d be the *only* local source of life support
chemicals. In a system with an Earthlike planet, their value wouldf
depend entirely on the relative costs of shipping.

In the original planitesmals, it\'d be very constant. And when they
differentiate, it\'d vary pretty uniformly with depth. But not by very
much. 

The closer to the star you get, the lower in low melting point and low
boiling point elements things will get (ie even components of "stony"
meteors can get "baked out" if you get in close enough to the star).

But for most practical purposes, I\'d treat the stony material as being
uniform across the system. Use the average composition of the earth\'s
crust (given in many books) as the composition of the stone. And yes,
that means that they are essentially "country rock".

Well, with the nickel-iron asteroids, if you have enough water and
power available you could electrolyticly refine the metals. You\'d get
iron or nickel (I forget which) on the first pass, and a "sludge"
consisting of all the other metals as compounds. Reduce that (applying
heat and recyclable chemicals will work), and you get the other main
metal. 

Now that you\'ve got the nickel and iron out, the other metals will be
more interesting, but you can still use pretty much the same cycle. We
don\'t do it this way on earth, both because we don\'t have large slabs
of nickel-iron to work on, and because we have other ways of producing
the metals so we don\'t (usually) bother reclaiming the metals in iron
mill slag.

I think stony asteroids (again in a system with no earth-like planet)
could be processed to seperate the major oxides (silica, alumina,
magnesia, and titania) and the latter three processed to extract the
metals. The silica could be used as is for producing various types of
"glass". I\'ve mentioned before that I expect a light metal alloy (AL,
Mg, Ti or some combination) "sandwich" filled with "foamed" glass to be
the space colony equivalent of a sheet of plywood. 

Note that using current methods, the seperation of the oxides will
require large amounts of water. It can (and will!) be recycled, but you
still need a *lot* of it.

Oh yeah, this also will produce a fair amount of "sludge" that will
essentially be everything in the stony material that *wasn\'t* the 4
oxides listed above. And the processing will likely liberate all the
non-metals early on. At least the ones present. Oxygen will replace
phosporus, sulfur, chlorine, bromine and iodine. It won\'t replace
fluorine, but there won\'t be a lot of that, and it can be extracted by
giving a better metal for it to latch onto. So pretty much everything
will be oxides after the first stage or two of processing. We\'ve got
means of seperating out such a mishmash, we rarely use them outside the
lab.

Looks like we\'ve got a lot of materials to use for even a 2000 degree
radiator. Though a thousand degree one looks like a better bet. And
even a 3000 degree unit isn\'t out of the question (note that carbon, as
in graphite, can handle that easily).

With a bit of thought, I realized that the working fluid would almost
certainly be a liquid metal, as these have decent heat capacities,
can\'t decompose, and can be driven through the system by pumps having
no moving parts (as is done in sodium cooled reactors now).

After poring over the melting and boiling points, I found that there
are two main candidates for the "working fluid" in the radiators.
Gallium and Tin. Both have boiling points above 2000 by a comfortable
margin, and melting points well below 1000 (Gallium melts at 29.6C!).
If you want to go to 3000, Cerium and lathanum are the only elements
with melting points below 1000 and boiling points above 3000. I can see
them being used in some military ships. There\'d be quite an advantage
to being able to crank your radiators up that high.

Sodium (as is used in many nuclear reactors) boils at 892, so it\'s out
of the running except for really low temp radiators. It does melt at
97.8 though. It\'s also a major fire hazard around water, and chemical
hazard around people.

I expect most ships will use tin. It melts at 231.9C, and thus will
circulate ok even at *very* low power levels. Gallium would be even
better, but it\'s a lot scarcer (and thus, more expensive). But it would
seem almost ideal. It has a higher specific heat than tin, and could
actually be used in the *low* temp radiators for life support as well
as the high temp ones for the power plant. And it can be easily handled
as a liquid at only a few degrees above room temp (making it easy to
clean it out of piping. :-)

Still, tin looks like the all around best bet. I guess starships are in
no danger of running out of high quality solder. :-)

So, graphite radiators with liquid tin running through them at 1000
degrees nominal, with down to 300 and up to 2000 available. Seems like
a nice design once you add the heat pumps to pump the life system
waste heat uphill. :-)

Special military with liquid cerium or lathanum, still inside graphite.
I bet they\'d go with lathanum. That way the radiators can double as
part of the jump grid, and they can use spare lathanum from stores to
refill the radiators *or* to patch the jump grid!

And the "deluxe" civilian setup using gallium.

First of all, if you want pirates in YTU then bless you (not to imply

The pirates that appear as wandering monsters thanks to the encounter
tables are not commerce raiders or starmercs on local war contracts.
Such people would have the authority to prevent the PC\'s ship from (say)
landing on a blockaded planet, but they would not have the authority to
capture their ship. In fact, such ships would be more like patrol ships
than pirates.

Perfect. That\'s exactly the definition I use.

Ummm... unless the system has real customs or patrol vessels of its own,
that ploy won\'t last a second. And unlike 20th Century Chinese coast
guards, Traveller patrol vessels are in \'line of sight\' (actually, line of
radio messages) anywhere in the system.

Stealth capablilites are not Traveller technology (unfortunately; I\'d like

won\'t let me).

That has been debated at length. If the planet has a patrol vessel, the
pirate can\'t lurk anywhere close to where ships usually jump in because
you can\'t hide in space. Also, a good place for a patrol vessel to patrol
is close to where ships are expected to appear. But if the pirate is
lurking in a place so far away from the usual emergence point that the patrol
ship don\'t want to chase him down (it could be a ploy to lure him away from
his beat, after all), then the odds against a misjump placing the arriving
ship closer to the pirate than to the patrol vessel are litterally
astronomically (First a ship has to misjump. Then it has to arrive in a
relatively small slice of space).

>or because the target is in a place where patrols don\'t go.

Right. But those places tend to be places where merchant ships are few and
far between.

True, but where did you get your 5 compatriots from (by Traveller encounter
tables pirates are usually solitary, and by your assumptions they will be
rare (How often does a patrol ship mutiny?)). I suppose that if you are a
star-merc without a war, there could very well be other idle star-mercs too,
but still...

Secondly, if you _do_ get six pirates together, you have to catch six times
as many ships to make ends meet. But if the system have enough traffic to
net you enough ships in a forthnight to support six ships for several
months, wouldn\'t it have more than two patrol ships?

Thirdly, going up against patrol ships is a risky business. At three to
one odds there a chance that they will run from you, but military pride
is a tricky thing. There\'s always the chance that they will stay and
fight. You\'d win, but the repair bills will cost you millions of credits.
 
>3) The pirate will intercept.

I don\'t mind stipulating that if you have an armed, high G maneuver ship
and there are no patrol vessels in the system, any arriving merchant will
be easy prey.

>5) The merchant will be looted.

Right. If they are just capturing targets at random (and they are; otherwise
they wouldn\'t be trying to capture the PC\'s ship), the cargo will be worth
an average of Cr5,000/dT.

>6) The Pirates will go their merry way. 

OK. They jump to their hideout where they sell their loot to a legitimate
merchant with questionable morals. How big a percentage of the value does
he pay? Not only does he have to pay for two jumps  --  out to the secret
rendevouz and back again  --  but he is also in the catbird seat as far
as the pirates are concerned. Remember, they can\'t visit legitimate ports.
It\'s a buyer\'s market.

Not explicitly. Working backwards from the costs of long term subsistence
I reached an average of Cr10,000 (Cr9,600 actually, but I decided to round
up). I was very happy when that figure was included in _Pocket empires_,
but I wonder if future Traveller rules writers will actually pay any
attention to it. Ah well, time will tell. However, _Striker_ gave an
average income that depended on TL. I think TL 9 had an average of
Cr10,000, with higher TL going up Cr2000 per level and lower going down
by Cr1000 per level, but I may be misremembering.

In CT, yes. _Pocket Empires_ had a system that I like much better (except
that I\'d prefer a different way to apply the TL factor). More versatile.
But a tad more complicated, I have to admit.

I posted this only a few months ago, so apologies to everyone who has
seen it before. It is just my take on the subject.


ESTIMATING STARSHIP PASSENGER TRAFFIC

The following calculations are based on the assumption that it is possible to
get a mid passage on a regular passenger starship for Crimp5,000. This is a
price I\'ve arrived at after considerable calculations as a reasonable one for
a jump-1 fare (A jump-2 fare should cost 6,500, a jump-3 9,000, and a jump-4
13,500). They are also based on the assumption that the average yearly income
for a citizen is Cr10,000 (after taxes).

A round trip starship ticket costs Cr10,000, about a full year\'s income. At
that cost most people will at most make one off-world trip in a lifetime.
Propably a good part will not even do that. Just how many will depend, to a
large extent, on the cultural attitude to travel. I suggest that the number of
people per year that takes an off-world trip from a planet should be set to 1D
time 0.1% of the total population. In other words, if the die roll is 3, each
year 0.3% of the population takes an offworld trip. The die roll and the per-
centage was chosen with no real reason except that it sounds reasonable to me.

Example: A planet with a population of 30 million people. Die roll of 4. Each
year 4 * 0.001 * 30,000,000 = 120,000 people takes a trip. 

The less the local currency is worth, the less people can afford a starship
trip. So multiply the number above with the value of the local credit.

Example: Local credit is worth 0.6 Crimp. The number of passengers per year
in the example above would become 0.6 * 120,000 = 72,000.

Now it is time for a reality check. Ordinarily one would expect Class A star-
ports to have lots of traffic and Class E starports to have very little. To
some extent this has already been accounted for, since starport type usually
affects the value of the local currency, but there will still be cases where
the number of passengers and the starport class does not fit well together.
You will have to either a) adjust the starport class to the traffic, b) adjust
the traffic to the starport class, or c) find some creative explanation.

To figure out where the passengers go, find the starport type for the world and
for each of its neighbors. Consult the jump routes table. Four columns are
provided, corresponding to jump distances one through four. For each neighbor
determine the distance between the two worlds, and their starports. At the
intersection of the distance column and the world pair row, a number is stated.
If the one die roll is less than or equal to the number, a regular passenger
route between the two worlds exist. Note down the number you rolled; this
indicates the relative size of the route. (For those who recognize the table
from CT\'s Book 3, this is the reason for reversing the figures; the more
likely a connection, the bigger its relative size _may_ be).

Example: Checking for a route between two Class A starports two parsecs from
each other a 4 is rolled; there is a route between the two ports with a
relative size of 4. Checking for one between two Class C starports two
parsecs from each other another 4 is rolled; there is no regular route
between the two ports.

Before going on, reality check the figures again. If you get an unlikely
result, like a route sending hundreds of thousand of passengers to a
neighboring low-tech, low-population world, or a high-tech, high-population
world with a Class E starport generating hundreds of thousands of passengers
with no place to go, you should first try to think up an explanation for the
unlikely result (passengers to a low-tech planet may for instance be
tourists); but if you can\'t come up with a good explanation then you should
change something to eliminate the oddity.

Sum up the sizes of all the routes from the world and divide the total number
of passengers by it; the result is the basic number of passengers for a size 1
route. For each route multiply its size with the basic amount. This is the
final number of passengers if it is a jump-1 route. For a jump-2 route divide
the result by 1.3; for a jump-3 route divide by 1.8; and for a jump-4 route
divide by 2.7 (This reflects the greater cost of higher jump travel).

Example: Regina in 1117 has a population of 700 million people and its credit
is worth 0.85 Crimp (Imperial credit). If the die roll was 3, Regina would
turn out to have 3*700,000,000*0.85/1,000=1,785,000 locals as outgoing
passengers per year (and the same number of people returning). Regina is
within jump-1 of Ruie (starport type C), Jenghe (C), and Hefry (C), within
jump-2 of Forboldn (E), Yori (B), Extolay (B), Dinom (D) Dinomn (B),
Wypoc (C), and Djinni (X), within jump-3 of Knorbes (D), Roup (B),
Phlume (C), and Rech (D), and within jump-4 of Grant (X), Whanga (E),
Wochiers (E), Algine (X), Yurst (E), 871-438 (E), Tionale (C), and
KKirka (C). Rolling a die for each potential route we get the following
routes (and relative sizes): Ruie (4), Jenghe (2), Hefry (3), Yori (3),
Dinomn (2), and Roup (1). Reality-checking we lower the route to Ruie to 1
(it\'s outside Imperial borders and has an Amber Zone rating) and get a sum
total of 12. 1,785,000 divided by 12 gives a basic number of 148,750 (Which
must be adjusted for distance).

You now have the number of people going FROM the world to neighboring worlds
(and back) each year. But to determine the amount of passenger traffic a
system has one must remember to include all the people from neighboring
worlds that goes TO that system.

Example: The amount of passenger traffic between Regina and Roup is 82,640
Reginans PLUS an as yet undetermined number of Roupians.

Once you have the number of passengers you can decide the number of ships it
will take to carry them. There are two kinds of regular passenger liners. The
most usual one goes from the surface of one world to the surface of the other
world. Since they don\'t have to scrounge around for passengers the way tramp
ships do, they average one jump every 10 days or 35 jumps per year or 17.5
round trips per year. Each ship can therefore carry 17.5 times its passenger
capacity each year if it is always completely full. But since most ships
average 90% full each trip, you have to multiply by 0.9.

Example: A Type R Subsidized Liner carries 30 passengers. Such a ship will
carry 30*17.5*0.9=472.5 passengers per year. If the passenger traffic between
Regina and Roup were, say, 150,000, you could decide to have 150,000/472.5=
317 Type R liners handling it (More likely you\'d want some larger ships for a
route with that many passengers).

The second type of regular passenger liners are those that jump back and forth
between the jump limits of the two worlds (passengers travel to and from the
surface in passenger shuttles). Such a ship can manage a slightly faster turn-
around, doing a jump in 9 days on the average or 20 round trips per year.
However such ships can afford about 30% lower prices, so strictly speaking
you should multiply the passenger stream by 1.4 on such routes. Such ships are
found only on routes where both systems have space stations at the jump limit,
which usually means high-tech worlds with large populations and Class A or B
starports.

Example: A route between two high-tech worlds with Class A starports has been
calculated to have 1,000,000 passengers. Deciding that the traffic is from
jump limit to jump limit, the number is increased to 1,400,000.


LONG-DISTANCE TRAVEL AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS

This system assumes that almost all passenger traffic will consist of people
jumping to a neighboring system and returning some time later. It does not
account for people going farther afield. The number of Reginans, for example,
who can afford to go to Jewell or Aramis or Rhylanor is small, but there are
some who can. Nor does it account for one-way traffic (emigrants).

About 1% of all passengers embark on longer trips. The most usual ships to
cater to this traffic are ships like the Tukera Longliner with an average
passenger capacity around 40.

The best way to establish the number of long-distance passenger ships in a
sector is to calculate the number of passengers from high-population planets
in the sector (ignoring the effect of low- and medium-population planets).
Take 1% of this and divide by 40 to get the number.

The annual maintenance is to ensure that the jump drive works properly.
Anything else is secondary (well, except the life support system... ;-).
Have a look at the jump rules of any version of the Traveller rules. A
pirate that dose not have his annual maintenance will eliminate himself
as a problem within a few months of missing his annual maintenance.

What you do IYTU is your business. What I do IMTU is mine. Discussing the

One thing to keep firmly in mind before you draw too many analogies
between conditions off the Chinese coast and conditions around most
Imperial planets is that China don\'t have to worry about an Imperial
task force showing up and treating them the way they treated Tarkine
and that planet in Aramis subsector that got caught supporting or at
least condoning piracy (Move in, replace the government, put in a base).
Another is that the Chinese coast is a lot harder to patrol with wet
navy ships than the space around a planet is to patrol with spaceships.

It depends to some extent on what assumptions you make. In some cases
(see below for one) it is strongly implied. In others (pirates are
mutineers with a ship they can\'t sell), you get other restraints
that complicate their lives (they can\'t visit most starports and 
have to deal with middlemen who will want a cut for themselves).
In all cases they have to eat and breathe.

This assumes that they can capture ships often enough to steal enough
of all the things that make it possible.

This ship is specifically designed for one thing only: piracy. Who
built it? Don\'t you think he expected to be paid for it? This implies
that there are ways of making a living as a pirate while paying off
the loan on this sucker (or, more likely, writing off a lump sum big
enough to pay for the ship outright). Because if the builder didn\'t
have a market for this ship. why did he build it in the first place?

But this again depends on the reason that a pirate went pirate. Is doing
it because the Imperium killd his wife, made his firm go bankrupt. Is he
in it for the money, the thrill. Does he want to see if he can pull it
off, even though everybody says he can\'t :-) For each pirate out there
(and IMHO it won\'t be wandering monster amounts, but some still) there
will be a different set of motivations for him doing it. And killing crews
might easily go against this motivation.

But how many 20-40 years ships will still be using the original equipment.
Some part has been changed here, some there. Most ships will be patchworks
of repaired parts from dozen of yards and maintances shops. And add to
this the number off ships that is going to be refitted during their
lifetime, you actually have ships registered as free traders but look
nothing like it.

We\'ll since running straight from an opponent or head straight for it is
the two dumbest moves in space damage is going to be more evenly spaced
out along the hull as the ships evade to increase their propabilitycone
for their future position.

We\'ll he can\'t operate other places than he can operate, and since a
pirate has to do something with his lote, he definitivly needs someplace
that dosn\'t really care what he does, the question is how many places are
there in known space that has this attiutude, and this is again a result
of how you view the Imperium. Where Steven Hudson views it as a nation
with a strong need for internal security, I see it as a loose entity of
worlds, where the individual worlds are more interested in their own
security than that of their neighbours. "There was another pirate attack
on a vessel in the system three parsec rimwards. Blahh, thats just what
they deserve. They should learn from us, we never had that problem

I read it.

As far as I can find, all the instances given are of people using speed boats
and hand-carried weapons or similar low investment equipment (one article
mentioned trucks and .45 handguns ;-). If there is any one of them that
mentions an armed ship being used, could you let me know the title of the
article?

First off, no matter how arrogant a pirate is, he still needs to eat and
breathe, and he still needs to have his ship maintained. Secondly, I\'m
talking about pirates as they are protrayed in the Traveller rules and
adventures. You know, the people who have a whole career dedicated to
them.
 
>In some cases this might be a one time deal where they find out about an
>unusually valuable cargo

If they go for unusually valuable cargoes then they are not the same people
PCs encounter in remote star system, but leaving that aside, intercepting
unusually valuable cargoes have several problems associated: One is
intercepting it (how exactly do you propose to do that?); the other is
that unusually valuable cargoes are far more likely to go by unusually
armed ships or with a hired escort.

>...and other times they might go on for years before capture and/or death. 

Now, that\'s just what I don\'t believe they can. Even if they stole the
ship and can\'t sell it (by far the likeliest scenario, only in that case
we\'re certainly not talking about the canonical custom-built corsair),
they still have to eat, breathe, and maintain their ship.

But in the OTU some pirates do just that.

Well, some OTU pirates do that too! ;-)

Granted. The reference I\'m thinking of implies that you can\'t just use any
old transponder code any time you felt like it (IIRC the PCs got a special
transponder with three distinct settings), but fake transponders do exist
and propably can\'t cost all that much.

This is a purpose-built ship with the implication that it was built to be
a corsair with the implication that you _can_ make a living and pay off a
starship loan while pirating ships. Heck, anyone buying a corsair is either
paying a lot of money up front or taking out a 40 year loan...

Ah, just how big a percentage do you think they could get for a ship? That\'s
one of the crucial factors. A 400 T corsair costs, what, MCr200? That means
it has to capture at least MCr12.5 worth of ship per year just to cover the
investment. Add to that the running expenses and you wind up somewhere
above MCr15. A lot of things depends on assumptions. For example, how big a
cut does the crew expect? For another, can you buy a purpose-built pirate
ship on the same conditions that you can buy a merchant or will the bank
think there is a greater risk of the corsair being lost and demand a higher
rate of return? What assumptions would you think were reasonable?

>Why would there be a "determined" examination in every subsector?

Because if they are stealing whole ships then they are inflicting losses
that makes it worth while to expend a lot of man-hours to get the ship
back. Now, we agreed that you can get fake transponders. But do you also
think that a stolen ship can be disguised well enough to make it
impossible to identify again?

If there are no system defenses at all, yes. If there are even a few SDBs
then there will either be a designate jump-in area with a SDB in attention
or the pirate will have very bad odds on a ship just happening to jump in
close enough to intercept (we\'re talking about a shell several AUs in
radius, aren\'t we?)

>Do you believe that all SDB\'s, Navy ships, etc. are all so dilligent or

No, but if I was a corsair paying off a patrol ship I\'d be losing a lot of
sleep wondering if the bribee was honest (ie. would stay bought). After all,
the prize money on a MCr200 pirate ship must be quite a bit more than any
realistic bribe, wouldn\'t you say?

No Hans, I disagree.  A pirate that does not have his annual maintenance
will just move his operations elsewhere as a result of the misjump that
precipitates him out somewhere near a 100-diameter limit where he is
unknown, and he can then do his maintenance at the local starport!  :-) 

What a great system!  Be a pirate until misjump, then you know its time
to do maintenance!  And the locals would just know what you told them...
"under attack by pirates, made a jump to get away, but was inside the
100-diameter limit... etc, etc, etc.  Oh by the way, I need to do my
maintenance..."

This is really dependent on which set of rules you use :-) Take TNE and
miss your maintance and it will effect about everything. But lets look at
what your saying in view of the T4 rules. Read the rules and I agree.
Maintance has no other *rule* effect than on jump drives. But just as
piracy is perhaps (at least in your eyes) silly with the rules as is, this
is also silly if used as is. Although many like to beleave that the OTU is
a consistant piece of work, it is far from that. This means that one has
choose something that has to be changed to get consitancy. While your
saying stomp the pirates, I say loosen the grip the Imperium has on things
to allow for some pirate activities.

Hey, cool down a bit, will you. I\'m discussing the OTU also, but we might
view the rules somewhat differently. You see, I see the rules as
pertaining to effect the players and their actions, not the way the
universe works. The universe is goverened by the background. Misjump is
uncommon for regulare ships, pirates are out there, both require
maintance. One can get it, the other can\'t. OK, the maintance rule in the
book obviusly can\'t apply to both cases. It\'s a thumb rule for ease of
play when the players own a ship. Who wants to have rigours bookkeeping of
every filter, drive, part. Nobody, so we make a general rule to guide the
events.

If the cops decide that any bankrobber not found is dead then I can

say that unless you caught the guy or found his body he should be
considered a success.

Alliant Techsystems team to develop new US individual weapon 

A US/European team led by Defence Systems Group has been selected to
develop the Objective Individual Combat Weapon (OICW), the US military\'s
next-generation individual weapon. The OICW will replace the M16 rifle
and M203 grenade launcher used by US Forces.

The Alliant team (Alliant Techsystems, Contraves Brashear Systems, Inc.,
Heckler and Koch and Dynamit Nobel) is one of two industry groups that
have been competing on the OICW Advanced Technology Demonstration
programme, which is managed by the Joint Service Small Arms Programme
Office. Key system capabilities were defined as: a 500 percent increase
in probability of incapacitation; a capability to defeat targets in
defilade; an effective range to 1,000 meters; day/night fire control; a
wireless/weapon interface; substantial weight reduction; weapon recoil
mitigation and ergonomic design

Key system features of the Alliant team design include: 

A dual-munition capability combining NATO standard 5.56mm kinetic energy
ammunition for direct and suppressive fire and 20mm high-explosive (HE)
air-bursting ammunition for use against targets in defilade;

An over-under barrel design with a single trigger control for both
calibre\'s of ammunition; 

An electronic fire control system with a laser range finder that
pinpoints the precise target range at which the HE round will burst and
relays the information autonomously to the round\'s detonating fuse; 

Less weight than the fully equipped M16 Modular Weapon System;

A simple red dot day/night sighting system that uses uncooled infrared
sensor technology for night vision;

An ability to separate the 20mm and 5.56mm components of the weapon so
they can function as individual rifles depending on specific mission
requirements or the overall needs and budget resources of a particular
service.

The most recent phase of the programme culminated in January 1998 with
firing demonstrations of the complete prototype weapon system consisting
of rifle, fire control, and high-explosive air-burst ammunition.

Under an $8.5 million contract awarded for the next phase, Alliant will
build and deliver weapon systems and ammunition for testing and
evaluation by the joint services. The Engineering and Manufacturing
Development phase is planned to begin in 2000. In Service Date for the
first fully equipped unit is 2005.

Don L. Sticinski, group vice president, Defence Systems said , "The
Objective Individual Combat Weapon will revolutionise warfare much as
the introduction of the machine gun did early in this century,\'\' said
Sticinski. "Its unique capabilities will enable US combat troops to
virtually shoot around corners to defeat targets behind barriers or in
trenches.\'\' 

Alliant\'s OICW team consists of Contraves Brashear Systems, Inc.,
Pittsburgh, Pa. (fire control system); Heckler and Koch (HK) GmbH,
Oberndorf, Germany, and HK Inc., Sterling, Va. (weapon design and US
manufacture); and Dynamit Nobel AG, Cologne, Germany (5.56mm
ammunition product improvement and HE propulsion system). Alliant is the
prime contractor, with responsibility for total weapon system
integration and testing and HE ammunition.

Good Question.

Is the British Monarchy self-supporting today?  I was under the impression
that the royalty (including far-reaching cousins, etc) received some sort
of government subsidy (that\'s a nice house the Queen lives in, eh?).  Can
someone who knows more about the subject contribute their insight on this
matter?


This is the way I see it in my Traveller Universe - Barons and above
receive some sort of Imperial stipend. After all, you can\'t have the rank
and file people seeing the Nobilty doing the same things as the commoners! 
The nobility have to "keep up appearances," even if it means supporting the
lazy royal cousins.

Not terribly -- blackbody radiation is more or less constant, only modified by
albedo within the relevant range.  Graphite would probably make an excellent
radiator material, it has good thermal conductivity along its planes and has a
reasonably low albedo.  Plus, if you really badly overheat, it has a quite high
heat of vaporization per unit weight and can dispose of quite a bit of heat
that way ;).  Unfortunately, it is also flammable, so don\'t use it in
atmosphere -- use high-temperature oxides instead, some of which also have
extremely high melting points.

The first point is worth extra emphasis.  Go look at just how unbelievably
expensive Traveller starships are,compared to oceangoing vessels today.
For $50M today, I can lay my hands on a 1500TEU container ship, or at
least, I could were I COSCO.  (My rule of thumb is that 1Cr is roughly $3,
based on examination of cost of living, typical incomes, and cost of
various lifestyle goodies, so this massive real world vessel is on the
order 17MCr.)

In Traveller, we are looking at a vessel of roughly 4000 dt, and so on the
order 400MCr, give or take, and I would bet vastly more.  This means that
the ship is a substantial critter, and the loss of even one of these could
provide, in perpetuity, an investigation team of perhaps 200 at 5% interest
on the paid out money.  (1 senior investigator making the RW equivalent of
$100K, and needing perhaps $20K in support, so perhaps 40KCr per.  Assume
another 60 for three round trip jumps in a year, for 100KCr for each
investigator, plus a small staff.)

Clearly, they are not going to want to spend an amount equal to the cost of
the ship, but in the RW, insurance can come to 5% of the cost of the vessel
a year, and is often more.  Given that the insurance payments on even one
of these could support that staff, is it not reasonable that the actual
loss will cause a similar amount of scurrying?

So, the cost of the ship vs. the cargo goes way, way up.  Further, the
objects needed to threaten this ship are also pretty expensive.  Piracy
using a speedboat and a submachine gun is easy if the speedboat can get out
to international waters where it cannot be seen, and then return to the
shore.  I do not think anyone can argue that the 100d limit makes things a
bit different.  It seems likely that a pirate preying on civilian jump
ships would need a jump ship himself, else the "business as usual" idea
seems unlikely.

So, when looking at the Traveller piracy debate, do be aware that these
ships cost vastly, vastly more than equivalents do today, and that the
capital cost needed to become an effective pirate are also vastly higher.
Traveller piracy, if it exists, is far higher stakes than a couple folks in
a speedboat.

OK, first, for the record, you aren\'t argueing "by definition"
here.  But to address the curent point.

Two point.  You are assming that numbers of ships is proportional
to the size of the economy, in high volume routes a lot of this
will be via larger ships, rather than more small ships.  Second,
being in close proximity to a high traffic world does _not_
automatically mean you will get more traffic.

Wether they traffic is regularly scheduled or not makes
not difference.  If a world doesn\'t actract shipping, it
won\'t attrack all kind\'s of shippings.  Noone is going
to set up regular runs to worlds that normally can\'t
attrack that traffic.

Sure, they are looking for the best cargo.  I see nothing that
says that they are waiting for another ship so they can send
a "we are coming" message.

Yeah, but a message from a competator to his next port of call
might just get special attention?

Meandering Blockbuster\'s aisles last night I came across the movie
(unfortunately rented out) \'High Crusade\'. From the blurb on the back of
the box it seemd a relatively faithful rendition of the book. Anyone see
or hear of this yet?

Look at the first 3 adventures published. One\'s apparently about an insane
ship (don\'t have it, so I don\'t know), one is about ransacking a research
station (to rescue chirpers), and one is about exploring an Ancient\'s base.


The worst adventure I\'ve seen is in one of the High Passages from FASA. The

This ship is specifically designed for one thing only: piracy. Who
built it? Don\'t you think he expected to be paid for it? This implies
that there are ways of making a living as a pirate while paying off
the loan on this sucker (or, more likely, writing off a lump sum big
enough to pay for the ship outright). Because if the builder didn\'t
have a market for this ship. why did he build it in the first place?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
They mention that this ship is worth a lot more than you could sell
it for, due to uncertain paper trails and irregular origins. This ship
was probably _not_ a purpose-built pirate vessel, it\'s most likely
a stolen patrol or merchant craft that\'s been modified by a chain
of shady owners.

Looking at the profile, it might even be a standard 400-ton Patrol
Cruiser, with the 4G/Jump3 drives ripped out and replaced once
they failed due to poor maintenance and enough other patch and
weld work done that the ship isn\'t even streamlined anymore.
The jump fuel tanks were cut back and a cargo bay with 
clamshell doors was put together on the nose (the "capture bay").
These modifications were probably done at a variety of times, at
a variety of tech levels and with a variety of successes.

Once again: Pirates don\'t act like honest businessmen; they _can\'t_.
They don\'t place orders at law-abiding shipyards, they don\'t take out
loans to buy ships, they don\'t fly ships that can pass an Imperial
Safety Inspection. Their crews get paid depending on how well the
ship does on it\'s cruise, and a disgruntled crew that hasn\'t been paid
in a while may lead a Captain into deciding between a very dangerous
raid and a mutiny. Their retirement plan probably involves lot of exposure
to hard vacuum over a short time period, too.

I think the CT Corsair career should have had much more difficult
survival numbers, btw...

	IMTU Beck\'s or other nonindutrial/lowtech worlds buy their SDB\'s

Yep.  I looked it up some more on the net and found thta it was released

an English language German production. John-Rhys Davies is in it, among

surprised the Imperium had trouble with them in the Frontier Wars. ;-)

OffTrav: IMO, the most believable scene in the recent movie "Godzilla" was
the one where the French secret service agent -- armed with a SMG -- throws
up his hands and surrenders to the baby \'zillas, who then promptly jump on
him.

Well, I don\'t find your proposals the most cost-effecient.  I
see significant costs associated with most, if not all, of the
proposals I\'ve seen for enhancing security by restricting
or regulating trade (esp. if done in a way that would have
a real impact.)  (for reasons whe have debated).  I find
these debatable since I think that other less costly
methods would be sufficient to reduce piracy to an
acceptable level.

So would I.  Am saying that rather than draconian and
probably ineffective measures, they would use more
moderate internal measures along with external agents.

It doesn\'t.  I don\'t see how this addresses the point (perhaps
I am missing something).  To stop nukes by regulating trade
would require extreme measures and probably wouldn\'t work
anyway.  You would need to stop every, or almost every, ship
and do an intrusive search, but even that could be circumvented
by motivated agente (the kind that would be able to steal
a nuke in the first place).  Even that would only stop such
actions being carried out on planets other than where the nuke
was aquired.  Since you need a different security methods to
stop nukes anyway, it seems dumb to institute a policy
that disrupts trade and won\'t work.

The question about depots is a valid one, but the Imperium,
to exist as it does, must have some sort of border 
control.  In any case, the use of fuel depots to
get around border inspections could also be used to
get around ship inspections, so that wouldn\'t solve
the problem.  Nuke from domestic sources are easier
to control at the source.

The problem is that if you want to stop terrorists from
moving nukes, inspecting one in very 100 (or even one
in 10) ships isn\'t going to work.

>   How do you plan to shield your nukes?

Lead always work well (and they aren\'t so big they need
that much of it).  However, the fact is that starship
travel like in Traveller is dependant on the availability
of lightweight radiation shielding to protect ships from 
radiation.  Finally, even it you didn\'t have physical
shielding, you could use neuclear dampers to stop the
decay of radiactives until you are ready to use them.

None.  You are talking terrorists and enemy agents who are already
risking life and death.  If the Red Guard had only a 5% chance
of failure in nuking Washington it would be radioactive pit.

You must have missed something.  Control of the _sources_
of nukes, rather than catching them being moved through
interstellar space, is what I cam advocating.

I agree about the physics of it, though it seems to me to 
be a lot cheaper to move a fighter at 6g than a corsair. 
Fighters are harder to hit, especially for a freighter 
without the appropriate fire control.

Consider also that the carrier is still going to be able to 
jump away at the end of it even if the victim gets some 
lucky shots in, whereas one lucky shot can ruin a jump grid 
and make the pirate dead in the system.

One potential wildcard is the Ancients.  I seem to recall that they turned a

These systems would be where the Seeker-type prospector might concentrate his 
efforts, hoping for that strike he can exploit with sweat, explosives, and a

I always though the prices were a bit unreasonable.  One thing I never saw,
except for power plant efficiency, was economy of scale.  This goes not
only on prices, but performance as well.

I\'d want to give the new star a few millenia to settle down, though, before

In the Traveller universe, I think the existance of the jump drive makes major 
star and terraforming projects must less likely - why spend centuries creating 
a new world if you are likely only a few weeks travel from something liveable.  
Cultures that developed a moderate to high-tech civilization some time before 
jump drive reached them might have some impressive feats of terraforming.

I agree that HT oxides are the way to go.  I do not have the physical properties 
to hand, but a friend works in HT fuel cell research, and the "thermal oxide fuel 
cell" takes advantage of the good thermal conductivity combined with high melting 
point for some oxides.  I believe some of the oxides get quite interesting, as 
there are other desirable features to have in a fuel cell.

Many years ago the Monarchy handed loads of land back to Parliment in 
exchange for a future annual income (called "the Royal List", I believe).  If 
the Monarchy had kept the land, the current-day rental income would be (I am 
told) several times the current value of the List.

IMTU things work out in a similar way - member worlds of the Imperium can 
"buy" back their land from nobles/megacorps/other off-worlders in exchange 
for an annual payment.   The nobles/megacorps will often have come to own the 
land due to colonisation or mineral exploitation many generations in the 
past.  As the world pop has grown, it will want to become autonomous, and so 
Imperial law allows compulsory hire-purchase of the lands at a later stage.

The various laws are supposed to make this all equitable, but often low tech 
worlds cannot afford to pay the going price, leading to all sorts of tension.

Yes, it does.  IMTU, starships are dropping a lot in price, which makes it
feel more reasonable to me to have the fairly large and relatively
cosmopolitan traffic that the background seems to assume.  With the current
prices, those things are substantial investments - even a free trader is
like a small modern office building, with all of the intendant looking
around and curiosity that implies.   Further, a private yacht screams out
"Forbes 100 list member."

The argument I was making, albeit not well, was that the ships are so god
awful expensive in Traveller that the marginal benefit of taking a ship,
once disabled, is really, really high.  This also pushes up the cost of the
shipping part of the bill for a finished good, and should lead to much
higher cost per cubic meter cargoes.

It also justifies those amazingly high CT salaries - the pilot is being
paid something like seven times the average, and even a gunner is above the
average by likely a standard deviation.  Thus, space folk coming to a
planet look more like Asimov\'s spacers coming to visit than the typical
band of roughnecks.  This is not bad, mind, and might be a fun universe,
but it is a bit different than the typical traveller universe, where ships
lie in dock unguarded, and space folk are lowborn scum more often than not.

IMHO, yes (for civilian ships).  IMTU, I\'m toying with having civilian ships 
cost around 25% of the book price, but increase the cost of military hardware 
so that the costs of military ships do not drop.

Also, the typical cargo cost feels low.  Cr4000/ton is only Cr0.3/litre 
(images of ships emblazoned "The Real Thing(tm)" flash through my mind).  
And the standard cost of shipping goods is 25% of that value.  I like 
the Book 2 cargo table, where the base cost can go into the MCr per ton.  It 
becomes economically viable to transport a speculative cargo several jumps.  

Oh, and that rule that the sale of the cargo must go through once you roll the 
actual value table should disappear. This is in essence forcing traders to sell 
their goods at auction without minimum bids.

[Regarding whether the Imperium has any need for money
besides the Navy...]
You missed a few things (not all nobility own revenue
producing feifs, or even fiefs at all.  The cost of
a foreign service extends past the diplomats themselves
to include embassies, staff, ships to take secure
messages, etc.), some of your arguements are
more based on how things _could_ be (there is no
evidence to show that the X-boat network alone is
enough to support the scouts),  and some miss
the point (it doesn\'t matter if revenues for starports
are presented with the costs of running the starport
already subtracted, the fact remains that those costs
will detract from how much of the taxes and fees paid
at those ports will be available for other uses).
[I didn\'t go into all the arguements for breivity.]  

However, this is all irrelevant.  Even if we do sping things
so the Navy was the only Imperial agency they themselves
are going to have plenty of uses for any mony that comes
in.  They aren\'t going to have money lying around "left
over" that they spend because they have no other use
for it.  Whether it is the only department, or one of many,
the navy will have the same tension between needs and
revenues that any government agency has.  Wjether that
tension is based on budget allocations or closer to
the source on revenue collection, it exists.

No.  In my proposal the additional taxes produced a direct
savings that both help pay for the taxes and makes there
acceptance easier.

Regarding the more interesting question of the Emperor, I do
think he gets a cut.  That is why I didn\'t site the huge
cost of mainting the capitol or the money he spends doing
things like mainting networks for jump 6 ships extragovernmentally
for his private use.

Yeah, if they have the guts (a lot of people have had

the time came. Even Israel has sometime giveing in).
Of course that means that when they take the inspector
and ask him to pretend everything is alright he will
have more motive to comply since security is just going
to shot and let him die.

Actualy, if you extrapolate drop tanks, they don\'t have to
be that big.  The main working part would be a set
if hoses that could be rapidly pulled away.  In any
case, how says it must be a small freighter?

I don\'t.  I suggest that it will become unfashionable to
spend money to make a crime impossible that are disproporionate

Just because a crime is serious, doesn\'t mean that 
that society will try and wipe it out regardless of
the cost.

The US does almost
nothing to prevent serial murders from occuring.  This
is because they are rare.  It is a serious crime, but it
isn\'t seen as worth the kind of measures it would take
to make a significant impact in its occurance.

And the Imperium will _never_ eliminate all causes of criminal
loss of life and property.  So, just like all societies, it
will settle for reducing these to acceptable levels.

And people who have not spent every penny possible to prevent
something bad from happening can still get insurance by simply
paying a rate that covers the risks and profits. If that
bad thing is unlikely, it is very easy for the money spent
on preventing the bad thing to exceed the money saved in
cheaper rates.

Oh, I agree.  As I said in the other thread, I can see security
talking to a captain here or there, searching one now and then,
etc.  That could make hijackings uncommon.  What I don\'t agree
with is that hijacking would be impossible.

Well, if they did what I said, they might not have

definative that says they are temperproof.

I think that is entirely the point of the TravPiracy thread from the "it
doesn\'t make sense" perspective. That according to the rules and background
as published (in the CT setting, at least), piracy doesn\'t make sense. This
includes such variables as vastly inflated costs for spacecraft.

It is an not an argument against piracy in Alternate Traveller Universes

True about the harder to hit part, but not so much the cost. Try to
actually design a 6g fighter some time. It gets really hard--they
are so densly packed that they tend to break the "slop rule" that
lets you use displacement instead of mass. Once you\'re into a mass
based design it becomes an iterative process, and gets tough to do
(and expensive; oops, I need a bigger drive, so a bigger PP, etc).

Yeah, there are some really good points to pirates using small
craft.

Well, I doubt that.  I know that air piracy has often not
included a capital offense and most European countries have
no death penalty for _any_ offense.  But my point wasn\'t
that the penalty was worse.  It was that law enforcement are
going go after those who kill people first and apply the
most resources to them.

But as long a supply of used parts exists (and it will for
all the standard ship designs) it will be easier than selling
a specific ship.

He was between you and your jump point?  You turned to face

Well we have been over this.  I don\'t buy into the idea
 that you can just do a routine check and spot all the
ships that have engages in piracy for reasons that have
been hashed over in previous threads.

I noticed that too just recently.  I\'ve made an attempt to keep this 
group of players on the "right side of the law."  Of course, laws 
have been broken, and even a murder (hmmm  won\'t be going back there 
for a while).  However, they make their living trading and picking up 
cargo and reselling it, saving planets and the such.

I\'ve also just recently (today) picked up "Milieu 0 Campaign."  The 
few patrons and adventure hooks seem less slanted in the direction 
than "76 Patrons."

My research on the net pointed out this theory that just required a few weeks to calm
down.  Don\'t be near the star during those few weeks though.

Corporate ownership.  Habitable planets already have people on them that will have their
own laws.  If you claim an inhospitable planet for your corporation (and nobody fights
your claim) terraforming and stellarforming it into into a corporate playground gives you
clear title.  It also lets you stretch your technology to its limits.

Claim a system, test your stellarforming theory and record the results.  At best, you\'ve
got a nice new system.  At worst you\'ve got a super-weapon which could be sold to the
military.

I\'d also like to note that there are very large quantities of these inhospitable M class
systems out there, so the theory of settling elsewhere doesn\'t hold too much water.  Good
systems are few and far between.  Of course, you still have to find a binary system with
a planet in the right position, etc..

"Don\'t get me
wrong here, I still feel that Pirates are a weak sister to other careers
available in the game.  There seems to be enough possibilities that it could
become a viable career option if your Erol Flynn is all I\'m saying.  I also
believe, like you, that the encounters table is weighed much too heavily
toward having a pirate attack than seems justified.  How do we fix that in
CT, we don\'t, lets try for T4.1.  Aahhhh, wait a sec, that takes place back
in year 0 so pirates can operate there effectively.  Oh well, I guess we\'re
stuck with what we got.  I would add however, in CT it started a few years
before the fringes were stable.  In the ensuing years there were at least
two frontier wars with the Zho\'s.  Hhhmmm, that makes about three - six
years of a STABLE Empire so maybe, just maybe, CT\'s tables weren\'t off after
all......."

I think that the CT time line was roughly 1090 - 1016.  Not only were there
wars with the Zho\'s but also the Vagr incursions were taking place.  It\'s
starting to seem that for the time period that the OTU is set in there was a
great deal of strife and instability which would foment things like piracy,
terrorists, star mercs et all.  Its possible that YTU was stable but the
real one wasn\'t.  Hmmmmm, I think I\'ll take the official "canon" stand that
piracy was a problem when the CT time lines were drawn.

A technique that I\'ve been thinking about is having TL *strongly*
affect the price/quality of various components.  Components for
civilian ships would be generally built with older more mature
technology and receive a big discount with the tradeoff being the
components are of no-where near cutting edge capability (short range
sensors, weaker weapons, fuel hungry drives etc).  Military components
would be built at (or beyond) cutting edge TL and would be
exponentially more expensive, but also be more capable.

With lower priced civilian ships, I can see fairly standard *freight*
rates of 500-1000cr per ton per parsec being reasonable, especially in
either a competitive or strictly regulated environment.  Obviously, in
a free market rates will be whatever the market will bear.  If the
merchant has a contract at 4Kcr/ton to get a load of ring trout to a
market by a certain time, and there is only ship going that way that
wants 2Kcr/ton the merchant will pay it.  Will he pay it at 3Kcr/ton?
How about at 3.9Kcr/ton?  

For speculative *cargo* (and remember one man\'s freight can be another
man\'s cargo) I prefer something more like Book 2 or Rob Prior\'s
system. Some items should be millions of credits per ton (gems,
pharmacuticles, hi-tech equipment), and some should be bulk (flour,
cloth, ore) items running only a few credits per ton.  Profit or loss
is the difference between what was paid for the cargo and what you can
get for it, obviously.  What isn\'t so obvious is that most PC
speculators won\'t have the cash to buy 150,000,000cr cargos outright
and probably can\'t even get the credit to finance them.  Shoot, even
if they could finance such a deal the interest on it and the required
insurance would probably eat up most of the profit.

Another thing is market saturation.  Sure Bernitz will pay *big* bucks
for widgets *this* month...there\'s a widget shortage.  But now that
you\'ve brought in 300,000 widgets, and eased the widget shortage you
aren\'t likely to get those big bucks on your next run, maybe not for
years, maybe never again.  I don\'t really have *rules* for something
like this, but keeping it in mind, especially when players don\'t, can
be a good way to reduce a party\'s capital.  ;->

  The Civil List is voted by Parliament; IIRC it runs under 10-20 million

  Don\'t "real" (as opposed to PC) Barons, etc., have fiefs in the Trav
background? I suppose you could have "robe" nobility ennobled for service
(similar to Russian or French [vaguely] service nobility under the ancien
regime) without property or incomes separate from their service office and
maybe a pension.

On good and evil, well there once was a gentleman of
germanic extraction who wrote at length on that subject
but I digress. Traveller PC\'s are no more good or evil than
the GM  and party make them out to be. As far as the average
tasks or campaign "hooks" that are used to get the players
moving Traveller is fairly low key. Just review for a moment
such memorable (sic) RPG\'s as Mercenaries, Spies and Private
Eyes, MERC or Space Opera (for those numerically minded). These
are just a few of the technically inclined RPG\'s in my collection then
you have the entire melieu of fantastic gaming to explore.

My thought is simply this. RPG gaming involves people using PCs who
are exceptional individuals (even if artificial). This can be inherent or
due to some other circumstance. As my very first GM from way back in the
"Day" (you all remember the little 5.5 x 8.5 white books) said to me"Ok, it
may be
realistic but who wants to role-play a peasant planting the spring seeds?"

It\'s a game and I suspect that we\'ve all seen to many movies not have a bit
of
fun.

So there, (It my first pseudo rant. Wow, it was kind of fun)

I don\'t get it. The first time I heard of the idea of an asteroid hitting
the Earth or whatever, I thought the obvious thing to do was to land a
great honkin\' big rocket on it and perturb its trajectory enough so it
misses Earth. Yet every science-fiction movie, TV special, book, and game
that includes this scenario always has the Authorities try to blow up the
asteroid. I even seem to recall Ronnie Reagan justifying a ballistic
missile buildup so that they could be used for just this purpose.

Someone, please correct me if I\'m wrong, but even if you were somehow able
to blow an asteroid up (with lasers? What are they made of... nitro?) would
the centre of mass of the fragments not follow the same trajectory as the
original asteroid... that is, straight for Redmond, WA?

I think an earlier poster talking about this claimed the debris blown off
the asteroid would provide thrust or something. I don\'t buy it. I have seen
buildings demolished with explosives, and they do not undergo thrust. The
walls and such get stirred around a bit but end up in the same geographical
location as they started, I have never seen a demolished building lift off
and file a flight plan to the nearest sanitary landfill site.

Obviously these highly paid science fiction writers and directors know
something I don\'t because I have seen over a half-dozen "asteroid targets
Earth while protagonists fall in love" features and never never NEVER have
the Authorities tried to nudge the asteroid away from a direct collision.
Probably for good reason too, since the closing scene is usually our two
lovers kissing while the asteroid goes up like fireworks, leaving only a
tiny fraction of the original asteroid\'s mass to hit important tourist
sites.

  Actually I view it as a state institution (it certainly is not a nation)
whose raison d`etre is to provide a security umbrella (external and internal)
for the peaceful interaction of its member worlds. I\'d be interested in any
GDW text that contradicts that.

  My point is that while the obvious purpose of the IN is external security
(mainly enforced by strategic reserves, including colonial forces), that it
is impossible to divest the internal role from the external, unrealistic to
ignore the aspect of political legitimacy, and illogical to ignore the
peacetime deployments of the war readiness assets of the barious navies.

>here"-attitude.

  This may very well be an appropriate attitude for them to take, but as
the debates on the logistics of piracy clearly indicate, any world that
allows a nearby safe haven (or pirate unit) to exist when it could easily
affect that situation is clearly harming its\' own commercial and security
interests, even ignoring potential Imperial concern.

I\'m confused. Why not bring along a spare navigator, as well as a Far

The manpower requirement of the Space Navy is small vis a vis the cost of
building the same. I see space navies in general as having a social profile
far closer to the Air Force than the Army.

If pirate ships are exempted from annual maintainence at type B starports,
are merchant ships ?

If they have a radically higher misjump chance (say, 1 in 36), then they
are going to be a suicide trip.

Hanging out in places patrols dont go will elad to ships going there being
better-armed than usual. You can do a lot with 30 dtons of cargo bay
dedicated to missiles, sub-craft and battery-powered lasers.

Waiting for Godot, sorry, minor misjumps to happen where you happen to be
waiting sounds like a good recepie for many many boring months in space,
probably ended by a patrolling vessel.

If they can only afford 2 patrol craft, then they wont have much in
planetary defenses. Just loot the planet.

Hmmm, did you see the FS modified Tracey class - the one with the spinal
Meson Gun ?

One of those things at 10 000km could really wreck the pirate\'s day, and if
using purely passive sensors the pirate will never know what is about to
hit them ... apart perhaps from the manic giggling coming from Ditzie at
the Main Gunnery station.

This is part of why I like a secondary power capability from batteries -
you can show up as having zero power output, and still have enough juice
for an alpha strike.

I\'m inclined to think expendable gunsels are one of your lesser problems -

  So the Imperium runs the starports and gets a significant element of

  True. I\'ve yet to see an elaboration of why a Navy that seems to possess
such a vast (and immensely expensive) fleet, including (pardon the phrase)
presumed astronomical quantities of small escort/patrol/picket/raider ships
(not even counting local navies and non-starships) would be either unable or
unwilling to deploy them in any meaningful internal security effort.

  Try that again? I thought it was the presumed investment in the
jump-station/tanker system that produced the saving, and that the
taxes were what paid for the massive expansion of the Imperial Navy
tanker assets that your last suggestion seemed to require.

  Only true if the system in question is of no intrinsic interest and

to. There\'s going to be relatively few systems that fit those terms.

  We\'re not talking about backwaters here (except maybe compared to
high-pop worlds) - "medium traffic routes" is a very rough term, but 
I would suggest that the first step down from high traffic is going
to be a reduction in the truly large mega-corp freighters. Would you
accept that working definition?

  Luckily, I specified that. It\'s a heck of a jog for the cabin boy.
Remember, we\'re discussing (IIRC) "medium traffic routes", which is
presumably an intermediate step between high and low.

 i) what if a customer sends it?

  Even if you do (why?) have such a message hand delivered by the deck
officer of another vessel it seems deliberately ridiculous to assume that
sending ahead a message confirming your ETA, when you\'ve already announced
your departure time and destination (to get custom) will compromise your
business dealings in any meaningful way. Would you care to specify what
portion of the picture here I\'ve missed?

Hmm... if you off the crew, the next lot you intercept may as well fight to
the death. If you\'re known to be a rough but jolly pirate who just steals
the cargo (which doesn\'t belong to the crew) and leaves the crew alive
and their ship intact (which may well belong to them), you risk less
battle damage yourself.

IMTU, the eithically challenged free traders are by turns pirates,
smugglers,
legitimate traders and privateers, depending on circumstances. This
makes the above more important as the two crews may well know each
other - sort of like the condottieri in Renaissance Italy deciding the
outcome of a battle according to manoeuvring, without actually killing
each other.

It all depends on how big the asteroid is and how long you have before it
hits.  The closer and bigger the asteroid is the more powerful `force\' you
need to move it sufficiently to stop its orbital path from intersecting with
the planet.  Sometimes moving that much mass in a certain amount of time is
just impossible.

The `blowing it up\' option has two possible effects.  The blast can move the
asteroid sufficiently so that `misses\' (as above) and/or it can break it up
into pieces that will either burn up in the atmosphere, do less damage when it
hits, and/or spread the damage out over a larger area.

Given current tech there\'s little we can do unless we get something like a
30-50 year warning.  Even then, moving something 1km or larger will involve
leading edge technologies and likely mean sending humans further into
space than we have ever been in order give us enough time.  It will also
likely be a one way trip for those involved.  

Even finding something as large as a 1km asteroid that\'s orbit will cause it
to hit our planet with current tech is relatively difficult.  There are only a
small number of scientists working on it with very limited resources.  It
could take 30 years to plot all the 5km asteroids that might intersect us
given the current budget.  

I heard the other day that if the mapping project had the budget of the movie
Deep Impact (50 million US, I believe), it could be done within a few years. 
But its not sexy enough to get those sorts of funds.  Instead we get stuff
like Clementine 2 which has a budget of $120 million US that is designed to
test if we can in fact target and shoot an asteroid.  The info I have on it
suggests its going to be launched in mid 98, does anybody know if that\'s
still the case?

Basically, until we\'ve finished mapping we could be hit at any time without
warning but once the mapping is done we might just be able to shoot at it
with our sexy weapon systems. Whether that does any good we have yet to see. 

Six billion inquiring minds want to know.

- - Inspecting ships at ports is very expensive? 
- - Using already existing assets for patrols?
- - Registering ship specifics and ownership?

- - Using (non-tamperproof) transponders to track ship movements.

  IIRC, minimal combat vessel presence, or none in some cases, no
meaningfully useful ship registry data, no effort to track personnel
of any sort, including passenger manifests (again, forget piracy and
just go a-slavin\' - they even pay to board!), no effort to confirm
ship ID\'s (and no real way of doing so), and no interest in checking
the uncollected movement data for anomalies?

  I may not agree with too much of Mr. Smiths views on piracy, but
I might be interested to hear his views on the correct version of
your internal security system.

measures in greater detail. What level of inspections would you

  Yep. OC, we\'ve go the potential problem of pirates with Seekers
mining their own fissionable, and smugglers bringing them in from
non-compliant jurisdictions.

  Drop tanks (if allowed) and a single fuel depot can get a J-4
smuggler 8 parsecs across the border to a rendezvous with agents
operating a trader with collapsible tanks. At this point the lack
of a meaningful ship registry allows the vessel to move as it will.

  A ship tracking and port inspection (plus some random
inspections) system will detect regular aberrant traffic patterns,
allowing such designated vessels to be subjected to detailed
investigation. However, this is clearly well beyond the scope
of this thread. I\'d be happy to separate it out if you\'re interested.

  Correct. I don\'t think the transit of nukes can be reliably
stopped, except by physical inspection at starports (ships not
using the facility wouldn\'t be searched, unless randomly tagged
for such by a patrol vessel), IMTU.

  Nuclear dampers are neither cheap (TL 13+, MCr 1+ from Striker I)
nor easily available (after all, they make playing with nuclear
weapons much easier), presumably.

  AFAIK, neither of these is going to stop a geiger counter from
screaming when an inspection plays a damper across your ship and
the material starts shedding particles (I realize that someone
mentioned this a few months ago re: cargo/nuke inspections; I forget

  No, Mr. Summers, I\'m not talking about "terrorists and enemy agents

1997 Darwin Awards -- Part II

Earlier this year, the dazed crew of a Japanese trawler were plucked out
of the Sea of Japan clinging to the wreckage of their sunken ship. Their
rescue, however, was followed by immediate imprisonment once authorities
questioned the sailors on their ship\'s loss.  To a man they claimed that
a cow, falling out of a clear blue sky, had struck the trawler
amidships, shattering its hull and sinking the vessel within minutes. 
They remained in prison for several weeks,until the Russian Air Force
reluctantly informed Japanese authorities that the crew of one of its
cargo planes had apparently stolen a cow wandering at the edge of a
Siberian airfield, forced the cow into the plane\'s hold and hastily
taken off for home.  Unprepared for live cargo, the Russian crew was
ill-equipped to manage a now rampaging cow within its hold.  To save the
aircraft and themselves, they shoved the animal out of the cargohold as
they crossed the Sea of Japan at an altitude of 30,000 feet.

  Unfortunate that this thread wasn\'t about that, not when it started

difficult it would be under those conditions. It might be easier to

  I\'m conceding the possibility in lower trafficked systems.
However, given a 3-5 day stopover, I don\'t see yet that it\'s
at all likely in any system that would meaningfully be called
"medium", let alone "high" traffic. Obviously we need benchmarks
from one of the various traffic analyses out there.

  Aren\'t the security guys going to be suspicious when the inspector
decides to take some vacation time to leave on the ship he\'s inspecting,
or what? Mind you, once he gets back on board his own ship he might 
actually fink on those hardworking pirates and hijackers, unless he\'s

to go with the human inspector. I forgot to consider a helmet camera/video
feed/radio, maybe a recorder.

  OTOH, imagine being hauled over for being in Zhodani space illegally;
boarded by a telepathic Intendant accompanied by plasma and laser armed
Combat Robots. Being a pirate at that point would be a Bad Idea, unless
they\'ve got a use for you; "And the reprogramming will be minimal, too..."

  As pointed out previously on the list, a fuel station at the
100-D limit will naturally involve quite a bit of an establishment,
not the least being all the other ships that use the facility. OC, add
passenger and cargo facilities for trans-shipping, shuttle facilities,
ship service capacity, admin, duty-free stores, etc. If there\'s enough
traffic for a jump-fuel-station then the above seems almost inevitable,
barring a strange traffic pattern (small quantities of bulk freighters).

>case, how says it must be a small freighter?

  Which brings us back to several interesting points:
i) how big can a pirate vessel be expected to be?
ii) how enormous a crime can they expect to pull off before they become
someone\'s annual maneuvers? 
iii) weren\'t these jump stations last seen as Imperial Navy auxiliary tankers
in your latest case for why the systems implementation would have been so swift
that its\' lack of mention in MT would make the system itself uncanonical?
iv) if these non-TankerRon type stations couldn\'t beat up a little raider
(~500 Dt?) then how could they not be an immense strategic Achilles\' heel?

  IIRC, this started relating to carrying insurance, so the economic
concern is paramount. However, the point was that from the insurance
and shipping business POV, reducing their costs and risks (not least
of being shot) by having the authorities bill the entire Imperiums\'
tax base for a service they will be the primary bebeficiaries of is
going to be one of their main concerns year in and year out, until
they finally get something as close to what they want as possible.

  Good point. I\'ll keep that in mind. What about reasonable expense
and effort to reduce it to a very low level?

  IIRC, the (WA) Green River killings task force was at least several
dozen persons at its\' peak; this was clearly a serious effort to stop
the re-occurence of the event. Murder is notoriously difficult to deter
(given a specific culture), but it is one of the crimes that attracts
the greatest efforts to solve; we recently had a murder investigation
just up the valley that apparently involved ~60 officers at times, and 
likely cost well over half a million in real money ($US).

  Of course, that\'s only the US you\'re talking about. In aid of preventing
schoolyard massacres and the like most Western nations have very stringent
gun controls or are in the process of significantly tightening those rules
(Canada, UK; Australia?). If North Americans don\'t consider these incidents
to be worth the kind of measures it would take to make a significant impact
in its occurance, that would be a culturally based decision.

 < I believe at this point Anders should respond "Yanks in Space!" :) 

  FWIW, murder is one of the few crimes that has almost universally 
attracted serious sanctions - imprisonment or execution, outlawry,
volunteering as a human sacrifice (pre-Conquest America is so neat).
Both hijacking and piracy involve a very real risk of these charges
being tacked on, and the authorities aren\'t likely to care that you
consider that your victims resistance "forced" you to kill them.

  Sure. Don\'t you think that using already extant and crewed patrol vessels
for internal security deployments will be viewed as reasonable?

  Sure, the but if insurance is cheaply available then almost
everyone will have it, at which point it becomes elementary
for that business lobby to want inspections, not least to cut
down on self-assisted "piracy" losses.

  IIRC, ships IYTU don\'t have any reliable documentation of
owner, cargo, crew, or passengers. 

  Which of those sorts of records are considered relaible by law

We\'ll I don\'t really agree. How many on Earth today has a privat
multimillion dollar jet. In Norway I can think of 50 persons that can
easily afford this. (This number i horribly low, but I do this so I can
apply the number to the whole of earth) which means that 1e-5 of norways
population can afford it. On a world basis this means that you have 50000
people that can afford said jet (I still think this is a low number). Now
say that the average amount of citizens on worlds in the Imperium is 50
million (How is this figure?) times 11000 worlds (If I\'m not mistaken)
which gives 5.5e11 people in the imperium. Using the same number that can
afford said jet we get ~1e6 people. Add in yachts owned by companies,
state officals and so on you see that there will be an awful many of these
ships out there.

Well compared to the average income of ~10000Cr its expensive, but I think
that the average income on Sylea or any other industrial high tech world
is propably a lot higher. There is a lot of dirt balls out there which
will have incomes in the 10 to 100Cr range to keep the average down.

As long as their coming to som low-tech high-pop world, but when they come
to Sylea their propably viewed as misfits that couldn\'t get anything else
to do. I think it\'s then more like sailors today. They have an average
income, and its only the special few who wants the job, unless your from a
low-tech, low income nation like the Phillipines.

What is the cost of a twenty year old free trader in the OTU. I should be
around 10 to 25% of the original price if you ask me. And the way I see
the Imperium it is full of these old patched up traders plowing the
spacelanes.

Australia has recently tightened gun laws as well, restricting the types of
weapons that can be owned as well as a national gun register.  Whether this
will work is yet to be seen.

Marc has some very clear views on the manner in which future Traveller

This is the one with software, HWIG, TML and X-Boat archives and lots of other

correcting and proofing stuff) and is a _far_ more ambitious project.

Still, the TML CD has enough stuff on it to delight, amaze, and astound for

There\'s an objection to your idea. Our chemical rockets don\'t have
nearly enough endurance to do it. Asteroids are big, and massive.
Something like this would have to be done from far away (while the
asteroid is still many months from Earth) and with a high-efficiency
engine like a fusion engine.

The explosion would give thrust, yes. You don\'t see it much in building
demolition because of the conditions (you put the charges under the
building, there\'s gravity and air resistance etc.). But in an asteroid
in space if the remaining pieces had more momentum than their gravity
could fight off they would separate nicely.

Obviously here things get more complicated: blowing up big asteroids to
tiny little bits is really difficult, even with nuclear explosions. No
way it could be done even with the nukes we have today. Better chance
we have would to try to break it in two pieces and hope the asteroid
has any rotation (the momentum of the rotation plus the explosion would
eventually separate the two pieces enough). Would have to be done
really from afar, though.

Ok, let\'s slow down a bit here...First, unless the demolition crew is
unforgivably incompetent, buildings are not _ex_ploded, but _im_ploded. I just
watched a show on TLC about one family, reputedly the best in the business,
and tracked them through one project. They spend _months_ making sure that
that building stays put when the charges go off.

Yes, the debris flying off an asteroid will provide thrust, per good ol\'
Newton. Action-reaction, that sort of thing. The earlier we can track, id and
get to the asteroid, the less we actually have to nudge it to make it miss us.
The first time around, at least...depending on the period and what we do to
it\'s orbit, we might have to nudge it the next time it comes around, too.

Anyone know what the periods of the earth crossing bodies are? Are they
cometary type orbits oe what? Do we even have a clue?

Take a look at

http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/Dangerous.html

the Potentially-Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) list of the Minor Planetary
Center. From what I see they have a semi major axis of 0.8 to 2.7 AU which
indicates a periode of 0.7 to 4.4 years. Most of these have a low
inclination to so they are simple asteroids with orbits much like earths
although with a much higher eccentricity.

OK, first the explosion.
Hydrogen explosions have been done to death. I won\'t restate what everyone
else has.
But, there is another explosive substance that is frequently found moving
in and out of starports and is even on the trade tables: flour. All you
need to do is to create a particulate cloud of flour and an ignition
source. Ever make a flour cannon? Apparently silos go up in a most
dangerous way. The "bomb" would work best on a port where the outside
pressure is lower than, say, what the ship is normally pressurised at. A
small device just needs to rupture enough of the flour containers and the
airlock. The venting air carries it out into as large a cloud as necessary.
A secondary device then (possibly the local fly zapper) sets the whole
thing off.
People have commented on the safeties surrounding ship weaponry. True.
There are a lot of safeties on your computer to prevent the hard disk from
being scrubbed. But nasty evil people write viruses. The "bomb" could be a
targeted virus introduced to it over its comms links. The ship could "just
happened" not to have installed the local anti-virus update specific to
this world.

Now, the damage.
People have commented that a hydrogen explosion is unlikely to cause enough
direct damage to take out a ship. I suspect flour explosions are even
weaker. Consider, through, secondary damage. If the ship is in a large,
hanger like facility, the explosion is likely to blow the roof off, and,
well, it has to fall back down again.
On the other side, there area lot of high(ish)-pop, low surface area
worlds. I think that underground constructions is going to be very, very
common. If the ship is in a hanger (not the landing pad) on such a world,
it is likely that beneath it will be warehousing, storage bays, etc, etc.
If there is an explosion, the floor is not unlikely to be ruptured and
falling that distance is likely to take a ship out of action (at least for
a while).
If the ship is in an orbital facility, there is always the great fun of
uncontrolled re-entry. If an explosion just blows it out of its docking
gay, it may easily be thrown in a direction that is likely to result in an
immanently unstable orbit. Space stations are likely to be in as low an
orbit as possible...

I\'m confused. Why not bring along a spare navigator, as well as a Far
Trader with a full load of collapsible tankage to refuel captured ships.

IMTU Pirates seldom have competent Navigators to spare - or
competent Engineers, Medics, or even Pilots. Most people with 
such skills can get (and keep) less risky jobs that pay better.

Also, as I said a couple of times, the skillset and contacts needed to 
sell a stolen ship for profit was far rarer IMTU than what you needed
to sell stolen cargos. You could even have navigation computers
on your target ship that won\'t go anywhere _except_ the route
they\'ve been subsidized for, without some heavy-duty and time
consuming hacking. (Such computers, and locks on computers that
need to be reset by bank representatives, have been mentioned
in JTAS sources, so aren\'t only IMTU.)

As for bringing a spare Far Trader with you, if you had a spare Far Trader,
why not (by your thinking) just sell it and retire? :)

As I said, "minimally capable". Ships like this might specialize in

In order:

You don\'t carry a military load-out unless you\'re a licensed mercenary
(or a pirate). An honest merchant isn\'t getting 3 10-ton fighters into
his cargo bay unless he does some dishonest things.

Jump drive is precise on a Parsec scale, not a planetary one. Space is
big, traffic volume is high enough, there will soon be someone who jumps
in within your intercept cone but outside what you think are the intercept
cones of the local gendarmes. Your "hanging out" is probably you jumping
in to the outer system and slowly making your way sunward, like a 
low-G merchant on an incoming transit after a poor jump-exit. If a patrol
craft decides to light all candles and come storming out after every
sub-1000tn tramp that jumps short, they will be one out-of-position and
worn out patrol ship 90% of the time.

And I\'m sure that, barring planetary defenses, a Pirate would _love_ 
to loot a planet, even a low-tech one. It\'s just easier to defeat
a patrol cruiser in open space (you can see where it is, for example)
than it is to defeat that planetary missile base that keeps throwing
missiles at you from the other side of the planet - especially if your
loadout is laser-based.

Because the captain used the twenty minutes of interception time to

_anyone_ with the navigation coordinates of the Pirate base but himself.
Because you\'d need the cooperation of the crew for an entire week get the
ship safely in and out of jump, and have to give said crewman enough
computer access that she could activate all the anti-hijack stuff against
the two or three guards you could spare as a prize crew.

You jump your Corsair away. The Far Trader you took jumps away as
well, with all the valuable cargo aboard - and it never shows up at your
pirate base. Did your prize crew get greedy? Did the Far Trader do 
a Jump-Zero, and is sitting there in the original system surrounded
by patrol craft (with your prize crew aboard willing to trade their lives
for the location of your base)?

The resistance to taking the most valuable thing (the ship) is simple:
a PC crew can get taken by pirates without ending the campaign if
pirates are satisfied with cargo. If they steal ships as a matter of course,
the campaign ends as the PC\'s are all murdered. IMTU I see enough
logical underpinnings to allow "take the cargo not the ship" piracy
to exist, so there is a nice match between story construction and
game universe consistency.

>What is the cost of a twenty year old free trader in the OTU.

According to a Q&A in a _Travellers\' Digest_ a 40 year old starship is
worth about 20 or 25% of original price. That would be MT rules. TNE
assigns a \'wear value" to ships (and other equipment) and specifically
state that the value of an item with a wear value of X is 1/X of
original price. I _think_ ships start out with a wear value equal to
the number of decades it is old, but I may be remembering a house rule
of my own here.

Sure, but someone has to build them in the first place, right? So there
have to be ways a new ship can make a living, because otherwise there
wouldn\'t be built any new ones in the first place. Also, the number of
old ships must be related to the number of new ships and they must be
inferior to new ships in some way, because otherwise no one who has
bought a new ship in the first place will be stupid enough to sell it
(or if they did, it would not be at a lower price). As the rules are
now (TNE rules excepted), a 40 year old ship is a wonderful investment.
Bank payments are one quarter those of a new ship but incomes are the
same.

But you are missing one obvouis point. Apperance. It will be much easier
for New Trade Inc, with their reliable new Free Trader to haul important
cargo that needs to be at their destination on time, than for Joe Trader
with his 35 year old freighter which ofen has problems making him sit
dirtside or in orbit two, three days fixing it.

This is why companies today fase out their old cars/planes and buy new.
Apperance and PR are important factors in getting business.

Another point is of course that the economical rules in Traveller are
silly at best. But that isn\'t my floor :-)

But the question is how effective they really are at this. My view is that
it will be more propaganda and less action from a government like this.
"We do this and that for you, so pay you taxes", while most of the money

summerhouses, wintercastles. The navy needs the state of the art ships,
cermonial uniforms. Parades, shows, displays eat money like crazy, leaving
less for the actual security concerns.

But remember that the frontier and edges of the Imperium is only a
bufferzone to keep enemies away from the capitals. That the Zhodani,

Not if the pirates come to this world as traders of goods. Pirates will be
the poeple that see to trade to worlds that no one else wants to trade
with, because it really isn\'t worth it. Joe Portmaster isn\'t really going
to care who comes in when they supplie him with the Rolex gold watch he
wanted to give to his wife for her 40th birthday. Or that Dress-Her-Up
doll that his daughter has wanted for so long. And that last computer shut
down really messed up the dockingpapers, so "Sorry Imperial Inspectors,

Actually, business amortization rules, increased maintainence
costs/decreased reliability, and increasingly, operation efficiency are
the major reason that most companies phase out old vehicles, especially
since we\'re talking things on the order of 747\'s and suchlike.

Smaller vehicles often simply wear out.

A fresh coat of paint will fix the appearance problem.

I don\'t have a problem accepting that you can make it difficult to make
the victim jump out of the system (Not impossible; if you have time enough,
you can do it. There is at least one canonical example of two ships being
linked so that the computer of one can run the jump drive of the other).
The \'computer lock-out\' explanation works for me.

>As for bringing a spare Far Trader with you, if you had a spare Far Trader,
>why not (by your thinking) just sell it and retire? :)

Actually, if you (or any of the pro-piracy people) could demonstrate that
you can make more money by a pirate operation than by legitimate trading/
freighting, then I\'d cheerfully accept the use of an extra ship. It\'s not
the high cost of setting up a pirate operation in itself that I object to
(though it does mean that the usual gaggle of impromptu attempts we see
with a lot of other types of crime would not exist); it\'s that the high
cost makes it difficult to recoup the investment.
 
>Jump drive is precise on a Parsec scale, not a planetary one.

This is just not true if you are talking about the OTU. Jump drive IS
very precise. Re-read the descriptions of a typical jump. Check the
tables in _Imperial Encyclopedia_. Ships do jump in very close to the
jump limit.

>Space is big, traffic volume is high enough, there will soon be someone
>who jumps in within your intercept cone but outside what you think are
>the intercept cones of the local gendarmes.

This is a good example of the kind of argument that I regard as much too
vague. I happen to think you are wrong. But how can I argue against it,
except by just saying "Na-ah! Ain\'t so!", when you don\'t tell us how high
a traffic volume is high enough, what you mean by an intercept cone, and
how many SDBs you think a system with a high enough volume of traffic
would have? For example, a system that recieves, on an average, one ship
per day will have about 20 ships associated with it. If those are 400 T
merchants, then the systen is generating more than 70,000 dT of goods per
year. What population (or what economic strength) would you estimate the
system had? Said ships would have a value of... (I forget how much a 400 T
merchant costs from new; is it MCr100 or so?). Assuming a value of between
MCr25 and MCr100, you\'d get an average value of MCr62,5 or a total value of
20 ships of MCr1250. What percentage of this figure do you think is
reasonable to spend on defenses? I once calculated that Al Morai spends
3% of its income on their route protectors. Does that sound reasonable?
If so, the system (or the merchants visiting the system) could be spending
MCr37,5/year on defenses. By TCS rules that comes to ships worth MCr375 in
all. And that volume of traffic gives your pirate one chance per day that
a ship will misjump and wind up closer to him than to a patrol ship. First
a ship has to misjump, for which the odds are zero if the ship is properly
maintained. Then it has to wind up close to where the pirate is "lurking".

>Your "hanging out" is probably you jumping in to the outer system

Which marks you as an oddity to begin with, unless you have (or can
pretend to have) legitimate business in the outer system.

>and slowly making your way sunward, like a low-G merchant on an incoming
>transit after a poor jump-exit.

Just how common do you believe poor jump exits are? But say you did. How
long will it take you to get to where the well-maintained merchants appear
and how close will you be before you are likely to be closer than a
patrol vessel? When you are that close, how long would it take for a patrol
vessel to reach you?

>If a patrol craft decides to light all candles and come storming out after
>every sub-1000tn tramp that jumps short, they will be one out-of-position
>and worn out patrol ship 90% of the time.

I ask again, how common do you believe poor jump exits to be? And how many
ships per day do you imagine makes for a high enough traffic volume?
Let\'s have some figures.

Also, how many of these slow approaches do you think a pirate can make
in a year, how big a chance do you think they have of getting a shot at a
victim each time they try it, how big a chance do you think they have
of making a capture and getting away with the cargo, and how much do you
think the average random cargo will be worth to them?

>And I\'m sure that, barring planetary defenses, a Pirate would _love_

The bad thing about attacking a patrol cruiser from the pow of the
cost-concious pirate is that they have a tendency to fight back. That
means that even if you win, you\'ll propably wind up with some nasty
holes in your ship. So unless the prospective loot is worth more than
the expected damage, it\'s a losing proposition. And consider that a
single missile or shot can easily do millions of credits worth of
damage.

IMTU this works the same way as the UK MOT system (only more so!)

If by Eroll Flynning you mean ignoring logical ramifications and just winging
it, then I agree with you 100%. In fact, that\'s the way I run my TU. But
viable in the sense that it makes sense, that I\'d have to disagree with.

Actually, I\'m quite willing to give you an argument about that, only I\'m
not nearly as sure that I\'m right and even less sure that I could prove
it. But let me give you an example. Say that all merchant traffic goes
through one system that has, say, 5 gas giants. Say further that the
closest pirate haven is 50 parsecs away. Obviously the pirate has a very
short window of opportunity: he has to make 17 jumps to get to the
hunting ground and have only one or two weeks to catch his prey before
he has to go back to his home port. If only one or two merchants per
week goes through the system, the pirate\'s odds of choosing the right
gas giant to lurk by is so low that you may not even need _any_ patrol
ships to make piracy uneconomic. Or the authorities could patrol just
one of the gas giants and protect any number of ships with only a few
patrol ships. Or say that the pirate have is 4 jumps away but the pirate
cannot take the ship with him. That would mean that even if he was
absolutely sure of capturing a merchant when he reached the hunting
ground, he would have spent three months procuring one load of cargo
worth an average of Cr5000/dT, which wouldn\'t be enough to pay his
expenses. In that case enforcement wouldn\'t be necessary at all either.

Obviously things won\'t be quite that akward, but having gone over the
figures a lot of times, I feel that if pirates can steal ships, then
preventing even one loss is worth enough enforcement to deter them,
while if they can only take cargoes, they can\'t make money enough to
cover expenses. I\'m talking about random cargoes, of course. If they
could intercept specific exceptionally valuable cargoes there might
be scope for them. But how could they do that?

>Oh well, I guess we\'re stuck with what we got.  I would add however,

Instability would seem to be a requirement for viable piracy, but I\'m
not at all sure that it is sufficient. The main problem arise from the
fact that Traveller starships are expensive, but that armed ships are
not all that much more expensive than unarmed.

Ah. The Vargr have the same problem that other pirates have: They have to
steal more than they expend to steal it. And if that isn\'t enough, if they
grow too tiresome, the Imperium can treat their home ports the same way they
treat other systems that support pirates. The only power in that corner of
the universe that can provide a sanctuary is the Consulate. Besides, the
Vargr would at most be a problem in the coreward line of subsectors, not
the entire Spinward Marches.

Well, how about providing me with a description of a pirate foray? Decide
what kind of ship you have, how you got it and what financial conditions
you have it under. Then tell me where in the Spinward Marches you start,
how you find a victim, how you catch it, what you do with it afterwards
and show me that you\'ve made a profit.

Something has to give on this issue. That\'s like saying that an aircraft
built in 1958 is just as good as an aircraft built today.  Fact is that
nobody manufactures an aircaft like those built in 1958 anymore. If you had
an old one and tried to sell it, it would probably not sell AT ALL to a
real business interest (i.e. a company that wanted to use it to transport
passengers and cargo) - it might sell as an antique or curiosity.

This should be even worse in the Imperium\'s high-tech environment, where
one would think that 40 years would make an EVEN BIGGER difference in
technological development. Pilots trained on modern spacecraft in the Imp
Navy going down to 40 year old Traders would be like F-16 pilots trying to
fly old B-25s - they could do it probably, but it\'d be a *huge* step down
for them. They\'d notice the zillion pieces of missing technology (all the
bells and whistles). No infrared cameras, no laser targeting, no computer
navigation, no computer aided radar, no ground-avoidance system, and on and
on.  

Same deal for navigators and engineers. Could a U.S. Navy carrier\'s nuclear
power technician also function on a WW2 era ship with boilers? Maybe, but
he\'d have a LOT to learn.

Has Traveller ever addressed the idea that technology does not stand still
for 40 years while you pay off your ship?

There would have to be a corresponding increase in maintenence costs for
older ships. Perhaps a monthly chance of breakdown and a roll to determine
how much the repair costs. Also the annual maintenence cost should increase
with the age of the ship to some degree.  Certainly though, even with these
costs, an older ship, just like an older car today, is a much better buy
than a new one if all you need is transportation from point A to point B (
if you don\'t care about the cockpit having electric seat-warmers and
adjustable cup-holders).

Those new ships depriciate 10 MCr as soon as you fly them off the lot!  ;)

Of course old ships also have a lot of Role-Playing value, as you force the
crew to spend three days trying to figure out what is making that awful
"scrinch-scrinch-scrinch-skreeeeeee..." sound that reverberates through the
Navigator\'s cabin wall whenever the port side thruster assembly fires. Also
there\'s the fact that the food dispenser only works if the cockpit
environment controls are set below 40F... etc.

	do you mean : High Crusade - Frikasee im Weltraum

	  a starport of a distant planet. "

	If like to laugh, its recomended (after 1 gram mariuana,
	or 3 bottles of beer) As even Jump is traveller like,
	you can claim a minor race with a vilani vessel. I still

	The Airport and the Trainstation of our small home town now has
	some high tech, build by ZAIT (iirc). A neural network for
	detecting people. The current installation can detect about 400
	people, not only by face recocnisation, but also by movement
	pattern (arm&legs).  Some fusselige logic is collecting the
	answers of the different neural network. And test proved
	successfull.

	So to answer your question : This little TL:8 "artificial
	intelligence" can recocnise you at the next starport, if you
	are wearing a high tech jump/skin suite, by the pattern of
	your walking, handmovement and headmovement. I would advice
	to wear either a battle dress, or a TL:7 VacSuite, to cheat
	this system ;-)

	Back to piracy: I\'m sure any starport would have a recocnisation
	system. This wont be able to identify "jo average" when first
	seen. But it would have a large database of important nobles,
	terrorist, pirates, ...

This then raises another argument:  If the technology increases so fast,
then the Tech Levels are rather flawed.  The real question, as I see it, is
wheather the increase in technology that has been seen since WW2 and
especially since the advent of the modern computer, will continue at the
current pace or will it level out.

A recent article I read that discussed Moore\'s Law (The power of computers
doubling every 18 months) continuing as the defacto trend stated that
current predictions show that it will begin to level off after 2025 or so.

IMO, if technology does not plateau at some stage, the TL of the Imperium
should be far higher than it is currently.  Using Sylea as an example, in Y
0 it is TL12.  In 1200 years it is only able to gain three tech levels?  We
gained three levels in the past fifty years...

The distinction you make between a TL8 Nuclear Engineer or Combat Pilot
going back to a TL4 or 5 system was, IIRC, covered by the TL difficulty
modifiers in MT.  In real life, the two are seperated by several watershead
events and technology advances.  A sailor from 100AD would with some
training fit in perfectly with a crew from the 1840\'s.  Similarly, a pilot
who earned his wings in the late 50\'s will likely be comfortable in a
modern aircraft with the required amount of transition training that any
pilot new to the type would get.

As always, my $.02...

Well, the point I was making is that the Navy doesn\'t "have money
left over".  What you are getting to here is the issue that the
Navy has all those ship it owns for "free" in peace times.  The
issues of whether retasking those ships detracts from readyness and
wether their are enough to wipe out piracy (getting into the
sub issues of the number of ships it takes to patrol a system)
were all reacent covered in depth.

Well, dropping out your slipping in the term "massive" (and noteing
that tankers weren\'t the only alternative) both the investment and
the protection make them possible.  If the tankers weren\'t necessary
then we can just drop them.  If they are necessary, then those paying
for them will see them as necessary for the savings.

There is nothing in the defintion of "high-traffic systems" (or in any
of the words and terms used) that requires that the majority (or
the vast majority) of the traffic to be to high traffic systems.
The definition only requires the high traffic systems have more
traffic (per system) than low traffic systems.  It says nothing
about the share of Imperium wide traffic that they have.

Well, it doesn\'t have to be of _no_ interest, that is the
requirement for _no_ traffic.  It has to be a lesser interest,
but then that is the central characteristic of a low traffic
system.  Being in close proximity will gain _some_ systems
traffic they wouldn\'t otherwise have, if they are on the
way to someplace else.

No.  I depends on why they are medium traffic.  They might have
one big harvest of a cash crop and their traffic consists mostly
of  huge transports at harvest.  Or they could ship out modest amounts
of something all the time and rely on smaller for frequent transports.

But the point is that we _are_ considering backwater systems.
If you want a system of "I\'m coming" messages to work, it has
to work everywhere.  Otherwise you aren\'t eliminating piracy
or hijacking, you are just pushing it off to different system.

I don\'t think piracy will occur at high traffic systems and
so I don\'t think such a system be used there because there will
be no need for it.

[Though I have stated that I don\'t think this would be 100%
proof against hijacking and I don\'t see how someone expecting
you helps if you simply don\'t show up.]

Stepping away from "medium traffic".
Well, any system that has, on average, afew ships a day will have
enough traffic to be worth piracy, but not enough traffic to
guarantee that you have a ship leaving before you (random variation
will produce gaps).

What customer?  If you are hiring a courier, then you have to pay
his salary and his passage.  And yes, knowing when you are showing
up to trade _does_ give your competition a leg up on you.

You\'re analogy seems to me to be incorrect.  I think you would be better
served using the maritime cargo carrier as a model; I have no firsthand
knowledge of how well a 40 year old container ship would sell in today\'s
market, but my guess is that it sells better than 40 year old passenger
planes.

Now you\'re making a couple of errors in my opinion.  First, the Imperium
has moved *1* tech level in the last 20-40 years (say, 1070 to 1110),
before that the Tech level changed by *2* in over 900 years (TL12 in M:0,
TL14 by 1050 or before).  Our own Tech Level in 1998 has moved by some
(debateable) measures 4 levels in just 50 years (TL4 to TL8, estimated).  I
do not wish to debate the likelihood or reasons for such a slow tech
advance (I didn\'t want to discuss Pirates for the same reasons), but it is
part of the Imperium\'s history.

Another problem I have with the above arguments is the comparison of
Military Technology, which in our times of swift technological change,
requires a great deal of updating (and, presumably, would in the 3I setting
as well) with the situation being discussed, which I though was civilian.
To use a civilian example, Pilots trained on Boeing 727s would have no
problem (after a \'standard\' amount of retraining) flying a DC-3, of which
there are many still in service, despite the age of the design (and in some
cases, the airframe).

>Has Traveller ever addressed the idea that technology does not stand still
>for 40 years while you pay off your ship?

Here\'s my third (or is it fourth?) rub on this argument; Ships in the
Imperium are not all built at TL15.  There are many type A starports around
or on planets that are TL12 and Lower.  All of these Starports can build
ships.  Most of their host planets cannot build TL15 components or hulls.
There are two possibilities; they import all their components, or they
build ships at the local Tech Level.  I choose to believe both; a TL13
planet with a type A starport will probably build you a TL15 ship, for a
premium, or you can get a perfectly servicable, if somewhat less durable
and efficient, TL13 ship for less money.  The hull may be Crystaliron
instead of Superdense, the power plant might be a bit bigger, but the price
will be lower as well.

This is certainly a good option in your Traveller universe.  In mine, the
point of the price cut in older ships is to make it possible for the
players to purchase a ship when they have almost no money (relative to e
price of a new ship) and few prospects without one.  I do not need to be so
consistent that I then calculate the implications of such a measure
Imperium wide.

On the other hand, the Characters will get hit with some repair bills on
their old tramp freighter, corporate flunkies treat them with disdain for
flying an ancient \'bucket of bolts\' and Imperial Princesses will say things
like "you came in *that*?  You\'re braver than I thought!".  Perhaps even a
hit on the likelihood of passengers (although in backwaters, passengers
tend to be more desperate).  Oh, and an older ship will suffer worse and
sooner than a new one when they skip a maintanence cycle or two.

Yes. I find many of them more expensive than you do.  I find
others not possible.  Other things in this list I don\'t disagree
with, but I don\'t think come close to making piracy impossible.
But we have already discussed these and surely don\'t expect

"very" expensive since I never claimed they had to be "very"
expensive, I wish you wouldn\'t do it, I don\'t have time to

No.  I never said any of this.  They are all taking my points

not having fool proof ID isn\'t the same as having no ID).

What do we use today?  Probably a mixture of methods including

It doesn\'t have to "trivial" and I never claimed it was.  It just
has to be reasonably possible.  And yes, if you wanted to stop
terrorist from moving nukes you would have to stop and search
most, if not all, ships.

As a Ph. D. Chemist, I don\'t buy the assumption that all
you need is a seeker and a source of uranium ore.  This depends
on assumtions about the kind of equiment that exist that
I find quesitonable.  However, even if they can I think they
are better off keeping people from setting up unauthorized
mining operations.  In any case, this would mean that there
probably _isn\'t_ a way of stopping nukes.

Well, if you just want to keep drug, tax evading, etc. smuggling
down to acceptable levels, I agree the occaisional inspections
of suspicious ship, coupled with investigation back tracking
goods do their source, etc. will be in use and will be sufficient.

>>The problem is that if you want to stop terrorists from

If you spend a day searching a ship (you are going to have to
get into every small compartment and resesses) and do it at every stop,
I think you can stop "many" nukes.  The cost in lost trade and
inspectors would be huge.  It woudln\'t be certain (just like
searching people coming over the boarder isn\'t certain).

Well, both will stop a gieger counter.  The cost depends on
who is doing the smuggling.  There are possible groups who
woudl be willing to pay it.

What you did was take the thread on smuggling nukes and start
refering to those doing the smuggling as "smugglers".  I assumed
you meant this as anyone who was smuggling a nuke (which includes
agents and terrorist).  If you mean "common smugglers", sure you
can deter them, but you still haven\'t stopped the others.

>  OK. What about the porousity of the frontier? I\'ll grant your

I don\'t agree that the frontier is porous.  I agree that you
raised question about how it is guarded but...
a) The setting presumes some control of what enters the Imperium
or there are other problems that make this debate a sideshow.
b) The same proceedure you cite to bypass the frontier could
be used to bypass the inspections you are putting your faith in.

Fulacin has a small class A starport, corporate owned and operated.
Actually, the Imperium may have taken it over by now, I\'m not

the Zhodani.

If you really need 5,000,000 people to support a starport capable
of servicing 5000 tons for 14 days out of the year, then
you need 500,000 people to support a starport capable of servicing

That\'s a big pirate base.  I assume it\'s an incorrect application.

Actually, in Traveller technology does stand still for 40 years (sort-of).

The Tech Level jump from the 1950\'s to the 1990\'s happens MUCH faster than
in the later Imperium. Look at it this way, in year 0 they\'re TL 12, and
they\'re only TL 15 in 1100!.

If you grant that from 1950 to 1990 there is a TL increase of 1 (TL 7 to 8,
perhaps), then you would think that at 1100 the Imperium would be beating
the Ancients, hands down. But there appears to be a rapidly steepening
technology curve at the higher levels.

I see no problem with 40 year old ships plying the space lanes, and I don\'t
think they\'ll be as different as you think.

IMHO, of course.

Well, that counds like it, but there\'s no Alan Cox listed anywhere in

I think (hope) I understand what you mean.

Would a slight change in the frame of reference for the markers allow
realistic acceleration to be modeled?:

Past      = where I was at the start of the turn
Present = where I will be at the end of the turn

The difference being that we\'ve gone from TL 5 to TL 8 in a single century.
 That Imperial pilot may go from a shiny new TL 15 battleship, but his
rusty, forty year old Beowulf is still TL 15.  

For the average citizen of Glisten, TL 15 is the way things have always
been.  The modern experience of exploding technological ability can\'t be
used to model a society where siginificant technological advance occurs
every few centuries, as opposed to years.

Yet the Navy still has many vessels with those out-dated boilers.  As part
of my training with the US Army, I learned to use a bayonet.  This is a
weapon designed to turn a musket into a spear, and was last used to any
great effect in 1917.

Yes, in the idea that for the Imperium has plateaued technologicaly, and
advancement is slow.  Look at our history.  Between 1 AD and 1400, how many
TL\'s did we go up? Between 1400 and 1800? 1800 and the present day?  It\'s
entirely possible that there is a ceiling that requires a basic change in
how you think, and that slows overall technological advancement.  It could
be that fusion reactors reach TL 15 effciencies at TL 12, but materials
rech lags behind in making effcient enough radiators.

That\'s one thing I\'m sure would *not* be true.  In Traveller terms we\'ve
gone up several tech levels from 1948 (TL 6-TL 8).  Going up one TL in the
Imperium take several hundred years.  This is a society with a very slow
rather of technological progress, both because it is a conservative
society and because it seems that once you get above around TL 11/12 it is
much harder to keep improving.  Even the Darrians, the most rapidly
advancing civilization known, took around 450 years to go from TL 12 to TL
16, or around 110 years/TL.  The Imperium takes around 3x as long to
advance. 

In any case, a modern ship would have at best a few extremely 
minor refinements over a 40 year old ship.

None taken, and i\'m probably the most reactionary. ; )  It\'s true, mostly (and
was logical since T:2000 outsold MT).  Of course, I disagree bout the  "mainly
military means," and say more emphasis was on exploration than military (to
say nothing of the numerous non-military campaigns possible)...  

Of course, even the military means of TNE are a step up from repugnance of the
Rebellion and the callous disregard to authority that usually epitomises CT
(which lead to MT).  To say nothing of the pure nastiness of the Zhunastu
"School" and the early 3I as seen in M:0.

	well I see many problems with 40 year old ships. Perhaps you can

	wear value of 40 in their problem parts and around 20 (half)
	in most others.

	I see many problems with 40 year old ships plying the space lanes.
	If a powerplant has 40% wear, its likely to have some problems
	within a month of 40%. If a jump drive has a wear of 40% you
	should better ask for a tender. If a player deceides to buy a

	fuselwutz to repair the jump drive hpg" as a red herring. Of
	course fuzelwutz is build 8 parsecs away, and the ship can not
	jump without ;-)

	Nobody would sell a 40 year old ship, if anything is fine.

This is an interesting observation.  It would also explain why we were not
TL-15 when we met the Vilani. One possible reason is economic.  If you
advance too fast, you will have warehouses full of goods that are
unsellable.  Imagine the Military of today going from M-1 tanks, M-16\'s,
F-18\'s and seagoing ships to J-3 starships, Orbital fighters, laser and
gauss rifles, and grav tanks...  While the military could buy such
material, it would make the fighter purchases of the fifties and early
sixties look reasonable.

If this is the case, then other to keep the drives and power plant running,
why have a two week annual maintence?  IF the ship is maintained, there
should be no problem.  I would, however, advocate a SLIP every fifteen
years that might take two or three months.

I see your point. But, I personally have two problems with it.

1 (and this is the least important reason overall, but it works for me). Not
to start an argument, but I don\'t use TNE rules. You may. Thus, I don\'t use
any sort of concept like "wear value".

2. Even if I do support the idea of "wear value" (overall, its not a bad
idea), I\'m not sure the value would be as high as you stated, in a
non-post-rebellion setting. In TNE, the reason that ships had such lousy
wear values was not only because they were old, but they were old with no
real annual maintenance to speak of. In Hard Times it talks about how ships
just can\'t find parts or starports able to service them...thus they\'re
running on duct tape, spit, and luck. In a more stable setting, you would be
able to give a ship its full annual maintenance, and keep it in tip-top
shape. As good as new? Of course not. But IMHO it would be MUCH better than
your %40 failure rate.

Your milage may vary, of course :)

Part of the problem is the approach that you deterime
one way that piracy would be expected to work and then
figure out ways it would be stopped.  The real answer
is that it will be whatever does work.

You can\'t say this for sure and it depends on who "someone"
is.  If you are talking about detail x ships to find them,
then the loses to that pirate will have to be seen as being
worth those resources.

Transhipping may grow eventually.  But they aren\'t required
for such a system and supposing a situation in which
bases big enough to allow the services listed doesn\'t 
argue against a system for fuel only.

They were _one_ example out of a number of ways in
which they could be implimented.  But in any case, 
you would still just need a big ship with a lot
of fuel and hoses you could pull away fast.

Because they can be hidden on asteroids or moved under
planetary defenses, or maybe you have two are three of
them.  I see nothing in them that would even make them
all that expensive.

"Re-occurance".  Nothing was done until several people
were already dead and nothing was done to detect such a
crime before hand.  I have no objection to the Imperium
tasking ships to hunt a string if piracies...

Sure.  I never said it wasn\'t.  I think there will be a cost
associated with them and they will be used to the degree
that the need is seen to justify the cost.

One of the things that is interesting in 76 patrons is that most of the
"Criminal" actions are basically "I can\'t let/get the authorities to do
this, so would you please?" There are a few oddball ones. But most patron
type encounters in most games will be marginal on the legality scale.

the question is one of "Is Good the Same as Law?", to which I must say NO!,
but YMMV. Most of the criminal acts are for the greater good, even if they
are criminal.

above IMHO.

Hans, take another look at TNE. Annual maintenance affects ALL SYSTEMS, not
just the Jump Drive. (See Rebuilds) The Rebuild rules allow lowering the WV.

Also, many worlds will have MORE THAN ONE STARPORT (MT WBH, Invasion
Earth). Canon gives us at least two class A ports on terra (Phoenix and
AECO). Now, think about a balkanzied world with an A or B port listed. Most
will have a B or C port per country... and all you need is a nation with a
B port that will accept you. Balkanized worlds aren\'t that uncommon,
either. Preferably a cold war balkanized world with at least one B port,
and enough capability for MAD, and politicos willing to let fly for
"Interfereing with out free trade", and you have a pirate haven. Especially
if the pirates operate not in the system.

IMTU, Landed imperial Nobility recieve a portion of the imperial budget for
their world, and Feifs usually include the duty-free areas of the
starports. For a company to operate under a non-local charter, some landed
nobleman must allow it to do so under his charter, usually for 1% - 5% of
company, with no votes cast, or all votes proxied to the CEO. So, say you
want to operate a subsector line in and around Regina. You contact the
duke, buy him off with say., 2% of the line, for the subsector LLSSC
(Limited Liability Subsector Charter). No world under the Reginan SS
authority can refuse to let you operate, but they can tax operations under
their scope, and any property that is local. Later, you want a sector LLSC,
so you go see the Duchess at Mora, chunk her some 2%, and get the LLSC, and
Still have the LLSSC from Regina, and now 4% of your corp is noble owned,
and the CEO can use it to break ties in the BoD.

Also, IMTU, all nobles are required to pay their feudal superior 2-3% of
their own income. And they get 1% of the local imperial tax assessment.
They function as the clearinghouse for items to the imperial gov\'t; they
are the stationhead for all imperial facilities except IISS, SS, Sector,
and Imperial Military. The local IMOJ office "reports" to the noble, even
tho he has no direct authority. Most imperial offices will be located in
feifs, since the duty of the feif is to make it available for imperial
functions. Oh, BTW, IMTU, most feifs are extraterritorial to the world they
are on, just like imperial naval and scout bases.

Again IMTU, the function of nobles is to maintain lands which serve as the
locus of Imperial Activities for a world. They get no direct stipend, but
get a share of the imperial taxes for their world, get ownership in many
companies (after hundreds of years, this can create quite a base of
income), and get local use taxes for starport facilities. They keep the
ports running.

IMTU, the limits on the benefits they gain is also important. Any corporate
shares gained by granting charters are part of the fief. Any structures
bought from the profits of the fief or it\'s holdings are part of the fief.
The first two officers a noble hires are an accountant and a seneschale...
the seneschale to keep things running while the noble and the accountant
figure out what is part of the fief, and what is personal inheritance, and
what is Somebody Else\'s Problem. Run it by the MoJ, and get their approval,
and send it before the local moot. It can take up to 2 years for an
inheritance of Title, one approved, to have all the books in working order
and signed off by the moots....

Honor Nobles (aka Reward Nobles) often have no fief, no income, and just a
title. Hereditary nobles might get a stipend from Daddy, but not from the
Imp Gov\'t. Both, however, are likely to be "Shuffled" into the
administration if there is room, generally in supervisory positions
requireing little more than verifying timesheets and dealing with unhappy
folks. Plus, they will often get involved in local politics, and local
buisinesses.

    'body' => 'Here\'s my entry into the piracy debate:

IMO there is an unfortunate conflict between canon which states that in the
late 3rd Imperium there is piracy and the workings of the Traveller
universe reflected in the rules (any version). One of these problems is the
economic one (which I\'m not going to discuss as I know next to nothing
about economics), and another is that of whether the Imperial Navy conducts
anti-piracy patrols. IMO they do, as there is little else that a Patrol
Cruiser is good for and they are shown in many illustrations in Imperial
colours. Besides as far as I can tell using TCS the 3I has a rediculous
amount of Naval tonnage lying about, and until the various factions of the
Rebellion find a use for it there\'s nothing for the non-frontier sectors to
train on except pirates.

However what I want to talk about here is how the pirates are supposed to
actually catch their victims, take them over and get away before the Navy
arrives. The 100 diameter limit is about 0.5 LS (5 hexes) in radius per UWP
size rating, so even a size 8 planet\'s jump limit is at long range for a 16
hex AEMS, and it will be able to pick up targets out to 200 diameters given
time (note that thos makes the pirates job rather harder as they\'ll need to
outside 200 diameters, and can\'t use big AEMS sytems without advertising
themselves - they\'d better hope the universe in question is using Bruce\'s
sensor rules so they can get decent range from their PEMS). This means that
even if a ship\'s exit point fell a little short or long it will be seen,
especially given that any legitemate ship will have a transponder. This
means that any piracy attempt will be known about by the authorities 10
seconds of the victim becoming aware of the attempt. Now at some atage the
pirate will have to come alongside the victim and match vectors. This is
going to be impossible to disguise and is very unlikely to be in accordance
with local traffic control, let alone astrogation regulations. As soon as
the pirate refuses to alter course they have given their game away.

Now about intercept times. Here is the result of a spreadsheet showing the
time for a ship to arrive at a distance of 50 diameters from its current
location with no relative motion (which is not realistic, but IMO can be
taken as an average time to match vectors with a target and is generous
anyway, because it doesn\'t take into account the target fleeing), and the
time to intercept from 400 diameters (which doesn\'t take into account the
target running towards the patrol ship, and is thus also generous towards
the pirate).

10		9.13	6.45	5.27	4.56	4.08	3.73

These times are in hours and count an intercept as getting to within 20
hexes, which IMO is close enough to hit a non-evading ship often enough
that a pirate would have to either get shot up or evade thus forcing him to
break off his raid. Note that in no case are the burn times for the patrol
ship prohibitive for a HEPLaR ship, so these conclusions apply even if
thrusters aren\'t used.

The longest safe period for the pirate is 7 hours and 10 minutes, and
that\'s with a 6G pirate and a 1G patrol ship. IMO this isn\'t very long to
transfer cargo, so the pirates must take the whole ship. This being the
case they\'d better have a reputation for releasing victims alive, or
they\'ll have a hell of a job taking the ship in a functional state. If
pirates are known to kill their victims there is no percentage in not
fighting or sabotaging the ship. All it would take is a wrench being
applied to some sensitive part of the Jump Drive and the ship is utterly
worhtless to the pirates.

In the more reasonable case of a 4G Patrol Cruiser or SDB and a 4G (though
most corsairs and Vargr raiders are 3G, IIRC) even around a size 10 planet
the pirates have only 2 hours and 9 minutes to persuade the merchant to
stop maneuvering and then to capture the merchant. If the merchie runs
towards help the pirate would have only about an hour to do everything.

Now IMO the assumptions I have made are very generous as they assume that
there is only one patrol vessel around, and that it is on the other side of
the planet. I have also allowed that jumps miss the jump limit often enough
that the pirate doesn\'t have to go inside 100 diameters, and then back out
again before the Navy or local law arrives.

I also whipped up a drone with a 16 hex AEMS and a fusion recator to power
it and using FF&S1 it cost about MCR33 at TL12 (and that was treating it as
a vessel, not a missile). This means that very few planets with class C or
better ports won\'t have one, or something similar, and any class E starport
on a planet with any reasonable population (i.e. enough trade to make it a
target for piracy) will also have one.

By the late CT period there will be a lot of TL14 Naval tonnage from the
Solomani Rim War and the Third Frontier War that the IN would\'ve wanted to
replace. These ships would be availible to planetary defence forces at low
rates - certainly no more than 50% of its new price, and looking at TNE\'s
wear value system more like 20 - 25%. This menas that SDB\'s would be going
for MCr 35 - 40. This means that a planet with a population of 1 million
could afford 10 of them using 0.5% of its GDP for Naval spending (using
TCS). Even our (New Zealand) government would popably buy a couple at these
prices.

In conclusion to my ramble (rant) I just don\'t see how piracy is possible
at the levels that the cononical encounter tables, TNS articles, etc show
given the physics of the Travller universe. This is unfortunate as IMO
piracy is important to the feel of the Traveller universe. I think I\'ll
just stick with the New Era where at least there aren\'t enough patrols to
stop it, though even that may not survive economic analysis :(

From what I\'ve heard dust explosions are actually very powerful if
conditions are optimal (mainly having a even dust density). They are
certainly powerful enough to uttlerly destroy whole factories - that\'s why
there are major saftey precautions in milk powder factories.

According to the MT Referee\'s Companion, TL12 was reached in -150
(Imperial), TL14 in 700 and TL15 in 1000. This gives two TLs in 850 years,
and the next one in 300 years. This gives an average of 350 - 400 years per
TL for the 3I.

For comparison the Viliani took 1065 years to go from TL9 to TL10, and a
further 3470 years to get to TL11. The Terrans took 23 years (presumeably
with the help of captured Viliani equipment) for the 9 - 10 step, 10 years
to get to TL11 and 188 years to get from TL11 to TL12. The Syleans took
1126 years to go from 10 to 11 and 500 to get to TL12.

This suggests that aside from the Terrans, who had a lot of gear to learn
from and a recent tradition of rapid advancement (and even they took nearly
200 years for the 11 - 12 jump, which they had to make by themselves), TL
advancement past TL8 or TL9 is expensive and difficult. This allied to the
3I\'s Vilani heritage makes for a very slow TL advancement rate.

IMO this means that like the sailing ships of days bygone the value of a
Travller ship is dependent on who worn it is, not on its chronological age.
In TNE this is shown by the way wear value affects prices, though IMO the
number of rebuilds the ship has been through should also be relevant as a
ship can only be rebuilt so many times, and each one is a little less
effective.

But it does seem to stand still for whatever reason.  The only differences

It\'ll have all of those things if they are both the same tech level.  Also
during the forty years things will wear out and need to be replaced.  As
with cars today some hold their value better than others.  You might want to
by a 1953 Corvette which sold for $1200 new.  It will cost you almost
$100,000 today if properly maintained and any restoration that was needed
was complete.

I think you\'re making an assumption here based on 20th century Earththat is not
applicable to a traveller universe.  Significant changes in
technology, as reflected in Tech Levels, take a _long_ time to progess.
How old was the entire concept of practical aviation in 1958?  40years?
In 1998? Double that.  In 2098?  Solid.  How old will the routine practice
of interstellar flight be in a Traveller universe?  3 Millenia?  4?  A damn
long time.

Also consider the environment for starships.  They have to be tough.
I wouldn\'t get in one that I didn\'t think would last for 100 years with
proper maintenance.

Wow.  No offense, but that is a gross exaggeration.  Often, you\'d actuallybe
stepping up.  TL at Milieu 0 is 12.  What was it for the Rule of Man?
Estimates range from 15-18, IIRC.

Behind first-hand practical experience, if such an engineer had any lack
ofunderstanding of working with biolers, he wouldn\'t be an enginner in my Navy.

Ships is built to last a loooooonnnnnnggg time.  Ask the Vilani.

Why?  It might actually get easier with incremental improvements.And of course,
ship and parts manufacturers that want to make
money would make backwards compabtible products.

Ok, so 40 years of wear and tear on TL12-15 materials.  Big deal.If the stuff was
going to wear out at TL 8 speeds it wouldn\'t cost
so much.  How long have they been able to keep MIR up in space
with a bankrupt economy supporting it.
Wear and Tear on TL 12-15 materials should be measured in decades,
if not centuries, instead of years. Of course, sensitive things like Jump
Drives might require a good deal of maintenance to keep properly
calibrated.

> If a powerplant has 40% wear, its likely to have some problems

So, IYTU, everything wears down at 1%/year.  So after 100, its gone?
Hmm, I just saw a two century old ship sailing in Boston Harbor last
week.

>     Nobody would sell a 40 year old ship, if anything is fine.

Now you\'re making some sense!  ;-)

  OK. If you want the Imperial government to resemble the ancien regime
under Louis XVI as portrayed popularly, go for it. Hey, I sometimes read
GW products, although I draw the line at White Wolf stuff :)

  Seriously, though, given that the Spinward Marches probably has one of
the worst ratios of IN support to local tax revenues in the Imperium, why
doesn\'t the 3I let the Zho\'s have it and retreat to a narrower front? The
reduced defense outlays would give both a more secure front and more money
for anti-gravity palaces.

  If so, it\'s amazing that attempts to secede from the Imperium are so
rare. Do you have a reference for the OTU? This matters, because it
strongly implies that the 3I is largely a corrupt facade. You might be
thinking of the former Soviet Unions under Emperor Leonid :)

  I\'ll assume that such a backwater won\'t even have a noticeable port -
it couldn\'t if there weren\'t merchant traffic. OC, the world you\'ve 
described is ideal for pirates to raid, too. They might feel quite a
bit different after that happens. By definition, there are things on
planet worth stealing, otherwise trade would be impossible.

  This ignores what might happen if the authorities find out about the
locals quaint little pastime.

  So? "Make and model and state of wear" is only relevant if I\'m
face to face with the authorities, in which case I\'m screwed anyway.
Why not send over cannon-fodder rather than the skilled principals in
the operation? Use electronics to mask your voice? It\'s not like the
crew have cameras and recorders trainded on me - it\'s guns that are the
concern.

  The crew can be dumped in their launch, lifeboat, marooned, ransomed,
whatever. If this is impractical most hijackings are mass murders, yes?

  Gee, I wonder how badly screwed the computer/ship/owner are with up
to a few MCr in damages there. Even worse, what if there\'s a repeater
downloading sensor data to a recorder in engineering, or the captains
cabin, or hardwired into the back of the cookie cupboard?

  I wonder of the authorities (or insurance companies) provide rewards
for material evidence leading to the termination of a pirate operation.

  Sort of. To keep the Imperium\'s TL playable, it\'s pretty strongly implied
that TL (whatever it means) doesn\'t change very quickly at all; witness
the centuries to go from TL 12 (M:0) to 15 (1000-1100). In other words, in
the OTU, technology _does_ stand still.

  Try 0.1%, plus 0.1% per year of age; thus a ten year old ship is paying
~1$+% in maintenance annually, and this would increase to around 4% by the
time it was paid off. Add that a type R with 4 MCr of repairs annually could
start having some really interesting defects and selling the damn thing does
start to look attractive.

  Even better from a ref POV, manipulating the breakdown specifics is a Trav
favourite - trader busts its\' J-drive in a backwater; being stuck for months
you might as well do whatever the system does provide in the way of presumed
profitable activities.

  OTOH, a Jump/Power failure in Jump space might be a low order of probability
result that gets a lot of contemplation from both crew and owners - time to
refurbish components (MCr 32 replacement, and scrap covers little more than
the removal costs of the previous unit?) or get the heck off the ship?

Wait a minute, I conceded that CT was heavily weighted but we couldn\'t
change it, are you now saying that T4 M:0 is no longer a valid place to have
pirates?  There are practically NO borders on the Imperium, there isn\'t any
colonial navy, I doubt the existance of even SDB\'s in tons of systems and
you\'re telling me that you think that there is enough enforcement to keep
piracy away?  I don\'t think so. Obviously it would be random luck but think
of the money you could get for the capture of ANY jump ship thats being sold
to a TL7-8 planet.  More than likely it would be written off as "Lost In
Space".

The main problem with that reasoning is, most "War" ships have probably been
repositioned on the border to include armed merchants.  This leaves whole
HUGE areas that would be pretty much unprotected.  A few jumps and I\'m sure
our enterprizing pirate could find several choice targets, Would you not

Which Traveller do you want to use?  CT, I\'ll quote passages from printed
"canon" sources, same for MT and TNE.  The T4 Universe is available but what
time frame are we talking?  The problem you and I seem to be having is we
BOTH are reasonable people and we BOTH believe piracy (as a career field)
was over rated but, according to CT canon it did take place and was
considered to be more than just a nuisance.  Where does that leave us?  I\'m
not going to spend hours (already spent too many) trying to change your mind
and you aren\'t going to change mine.  So I would like to call a truce.  I
will continue to use as much Traveller canon material as fits into my
playing universe and change those things that make NO sense what so ever.
What those things happen to be will be between me and my players.  All I
have left to say is have a nice day.

The last officially documented successful bayonet charge (in the U.S. Army)
was in Korea in the 50\'s a young LT (battlefield commission) Muellett
(spelling ?) received the Medal Of Honor for it.  I met him as a young
Specialist/5 in 1972.  He was a full Colonel then and I believe he retired
in 1976 back to Chattanooga, Tennessee.

I think the point Ian was making is that in the Traveller rules skipping
your annual maintenance is a quick way to, depending on which misjump rules
you use, turn your ship into a multi-million Cr writeoff, or a coffin.

Unfortunately the "decreased operational life" will be measured in months,
and the price they pay (using T4 misjump rules) will be their lives.

Yes, but that was a case of not really having much else to work with.  As
an individual weapon when your rifle has malfed or you\'ve run out of ammo,
fine, but as a general, regular part of warfare?

I agree with Bill Maudlin\'s cartoon showing a WWII Army cook exclaiming in
surprise to his buddy "Hey, this can opener fits on the end of my rifle!"

	There is also part of one Judges Guild product on the disk too, and more will

	I also have permission for the Keith Brother\'s Marischel products.

hard too track down, and than of course I have to find the volunteers to scan

	If the CD proves popular enough, their should end up being yearly updates at
a cheaper cost. It\'ll be better organized and accessible hopefully, there will
be much more material. And a fair amount of the "Classic" material.

	And of course their\'s the ongoing GDW-CD project which is doing all the GDW
Traveller material. Which is going along slowly but surely (and volunteers are
always desired for both projects).

But see how much trouble it is in. Things failing right and left. In
Traveller there are no rules to cover this. The only effect is a chance of
drive failure if you miss your annual maintance. TNE wear values relly
makes this much more realistic.

This is a TNE rule. The wear value is a function of age, maintance and
use. A part only recieving maintance by the ship engineer and used
continously is going to have this wear value in 40 years. Annual
maintance, new parts or a new power plant of course counteracts this wear.

Cut down on the sarcasm will you, it really isn\'t polite to attack
someones opinions in this way. If you have a problem with his reasoning,
state where you think he is mistaken and tell us way. In a calm and polite
way.

  Covered in depth, yes. There\'s no evidence that partial tasking of
wartime light warships to internal security roles represents any real
reduction in their military readiness.

  As for the rest, obviously the issue of Imperial Navy preparations
and deployments needs to be discussed again. Perhaps a limited case
such as the Spinward Marches and Corridor will be sufficient.

  Of course, the "money left over" issue originally referred to whether
or not the Imperium would have the capacity for internal security patrols.
You agreed that the Navy will spend money on internal security. You seem
to feel that they will not or can not do this at a level sufficient to 
make piracy exceedingly rare.

  Given that we can probably ball-park the number of escorts (or at least
non-Battleships/Tankers/Assault transports, although the thought of even
a 3Kt DD let alone a CL running a sweep horrifies me) that the Imperium
keeps in peacetime service, how many of those ships do you feel would be
available for internal security tasks (or training operations indistinguishable
from same) during peacetime?

  Massive applies to the huge increase needed in tanker assets (IN to fit
the strategic requirements) that makes possible the failure to adopt the
system on the frontiers or in Ilelish in the period between development
and the Rebellion.

  Tankers were, however, your latest theory for implementing jump-stations
without the negative strategic implications that might have substantially
delayed deployment of said system in the frontier zones, such that the
lack of said system in MT wouldn\'t comprise a definitive statement as to
their impossibility.

  The tankers were your proposal to evade the huge strategic liability
that freighters relying om jump-stations represent. If necessary from
the POV of the Navy, then _why_ would shippers see the taxes as necessary
when they\'ll reap the savings of the technology regardless of the 
military repercussions?

Are you sure?  I thought the reason a lot of Vargr became Corsairs was
that being Corsairs was _charismatic_. 

[Alien Module 3 Vargr pg 16-17 indicates that Vargr gain Charisma both
by rolling on the skill table and by rolling on the sucess table.  Vargr
with stat minimums gain positive DM\'s to this roll, and willl therefore
roll higher, and will therefore gain more Charisma.  Since Corsair
requires lower stats [INT 8+ and CHR 5+ both give +1] to gain these
bonuses thatn most of the other careers more Vargr will be eligible for
these DM\'s.  Therefore Vargr _will_ gain charisma faster as Corsairs
than in most other careers. Only slightly faster but hey these are
_Vargr_ we are talking about]

So you are saying that the Imperium, which is canonically portrayed in
MT supplements, as being able to defend itself against Vargr incursions
is in fact strong enough to mount search & destroy missions into the
territories of Vargr states with about the same degree of difficulty
that, say, the USA had in taking Grenada?  

IMHU & IMTU the Imperial Navy does not want to create a causus beli
among the Vargr.  If the Imperial Navy mounts a big raid on a Vargr
world that supports "too much" piracy the Vargr may well use the
opportunity to preach a Jihad against the Vargr.  If this cry is taken
up by a charismatic Vargr it may well sucseed.  Remember that few Vargr
consider raiding to be a less than legitimate business endeavor and many
may well be incapable of _believing_ that this worlds pro pirate stance
is the reason for the raid.  They are more likely to believe that the
bizzare, faceless, despotic, coglike, alien hegemony has moved against
them because they can.  The Vargr obviously [to Vargr] can not let the
Imperials get away with this.  If you let the non Vargr [and therefore
very low charisma] Imperials dis you like this what does this say about
_your_ charisma.  After all Charisma is really what matters your chances
of sucess or profit are secondary.  Of course this does mean that
pirates who are loosing money will eventually loose money and wither up
but every year in the Vargr extents tens of billions of Vargr hit the
magic age of 18, get thrown out on their tails, and have to find
_something_ to do.

[Enter Vargr mode]

What shall _I_ do?  Being a Corsair is galmarous and charismatic. _I_
will strike them form out of the sun, render them helpless, grab their
posessions, and use them to create my own pirate band.  _I_ will be in
charge.  Everyone will have to do what _I_ say.  _I_ will have
_charisma_. _I_, _I_, _I_ will have _CHARISMA_. (laughs maniacally)

[Exit Vargr mode]

Every day this scenario repeats itself millions of times throughout the
Vargr extents.  If the smart Corsair bands take advantage of this they
will have lots of manpower [er Vargrpower ?].

Vargr do not do _anything_ for mere money.  The only reason money
matters is that it can buy things.  Money does not give status -
Charisma gives status.

Strephon may have prefered sailing to ruling but he, arguably unlike the

  OK. I think that was mentioned in a parallel post. Would you agree that
for most non-High-Pop (9+) worlds that would be the def\'n of medium traffic?

  That\'s interesting. By making hijacking _very_ difficult in some
systems, you allow the focussing of remaining resources on those
systems which still present a problem (should they choose). I don\'t
see how "has to work everywhere" follows.

  OK. OC, the outer systems of some such systems may still have possibilities.

  If you can\'t fake being the passengers and crew, then you\'ve got

  I\'d be interested to hear what any statisticians might have to say,
assuming an average of 3 ships/day, and the 2-3 days before departure
being tha maximum relevant. OC, this isn\'t about _guaranteed_ availability
of this service, merely that it radically reduces the field for hijackers

  Remember, there is a lot of scope for pirate actions where a rapid 
response isn\'t very practical - most of the system, for example. OC,
a career pirate waiting for a target may be uneconomic.

  My big worry (and largely only because of grav-focus lasers, I guess)
is that having matched vectors to actually acquire value from the target,
what prevents any responding vessel from opening fire at that point?
While there may be an issue of having a beam density capable of doing
non-sensor damage at a 4 LS range, a pure ballistic target (either disabled
or unwilling to evade) should be not much more difficult to hit than it
would be at 1 LS or even 10,000 km.

  Is that analysis correct from a physics/fire control POV?

It\'s got 100 people, and an A class starport -does that 
mean it can only build 50 tons of ship per year? (or is 
that it has 50t of dockspace available?  

How do they man the starport? TL-14? How do
they run the industry with only 100 people?

On a somewhat related question, it seems to me that part of 
the reason modern aeroplanes are expensive is the short 
runs of production. If I spend 2 billion designing and 
testing a new fighter, and they only order 200 of them, then 
I need to charge a lot to cover the research bill, not 
counting the actual cost of the craft. 

Take something like the venerable Scout/courier. If it\'s 
been around in more or less that configuration for a few 
hundred years with a production run of tens or hundreds 
of thousands, then I\'d expect it to get real cheap, even brand 
new.

Consider also the use of robots. If you\'re building that
many craft, it\'s probably worth building a robotic
production line. If I\'ve got the robots and I live in a
system with asteroids and a gas giant, then it seems to me
I should be able to get the raw materials for squat (not
even the life-support, since all the shuttles getting the
raw materials would be unmanned) and I can build more
robots with those materials if I have to. Once I have
enough robots, I can churn out my one design, or any
others compatible with the machinery in my new "factory"
for just about nothing - The energy requirements can
either be met with significant amounts of Solar energy, or
some cheap Fusion plants (I just build some more fusion
plants - I need to be able to do that to build the ships.)

Energy is cheap, information is the key. If I know what 
components are in a 20MCr sensor array and how to put them 
together, is there any reason I couldn\'t build it from raw 
materials given appropriate tools? For a total cost of 
$23-45?

At what TL do robots become useful enough to do this 
sort of work? I would expect that I could turn out ships 
reasonably cheaply using this method. Once you\'ve got rid 
of the majority of the skilled labour costs, and the raw 
material costs, whats the expensive bit in the manufacture? 
The robots? With an appropriate starter kit and a TL12 
CD-Rom of "Useful robot designs" I should be able to build 
more, and once I have enough, use them to build and work in 
the factory. I can\'t see it being horrifically expensive if 
the raw materials are there, just that it might take some 
time. 

Can anyone see any obvious flaws here?

(BTW how rare is Lanthanum? )

Because for the first year, everything is new, and nothing 
is likely to need replacing. That\'s probably true the 
second year as well. After five years, you might have to 
replace the things that weren\'t designed to last that long. 
After 20 years you\'ve probably replaced half the parts. In 
a 40 year cycle you\'re likely to have to spend a lot more 
in the last 10 years than the first 10 years.

And why would someone design something that had to be 
replaced every x years during the life of the ship? because 
it is probably cheaper that way, not to mention that the 
parts in question can be engineered to a lower spec, and 
thus be lighter, smaller, and easier to work with as well.
Thus short term benefits with longer term costs - swings 
and round abouts.

  Correct! Clearly it\'s absurd to proclaim that piracy will commonly

  Again, I use question marks for technical reasons. Further, I think
we\'ve gone over your curious insistence that proposals that you disagree

  Remember, while "high (internal) capacity" ships are economically
advantageous because they don\'t have to carry their own fuel, _any_
ship is better off with the improved turnaround from not having to
land that\'s obtained by using a facility at the 100-D limit.

  Oh, and there\'s the reference to odd traffic patterns.

  The explicit cost of the available resources will be very low,

There is a table in Twilights Peak (and I think Aliens Droyne) where is

have ni idea.

You get what you pay for.  The British monarchy haven\'t truly ruled for a
very long time (since John?), unlike Stephon, who was an absolute ruler.  What
you get from the Brits is tradition and history, but most of all figureheads
that are supposed to be examples of what it means to be truly British. 
Unfortunately, they have become examples of what it means to be a 19th
century Brit.  Currently they are more use to the British economy as a
tourist attraction than as a serious political force.  That\'s not to say they
are powerless, but they\'re still trained to be figureheads and not rulers. 

A few centuries of inbreeding might have something to do with the weakness in
their bloodline too ;)

Hmmm, starmercs caught on the wrong side of a losing contract, Free Traders

I actually think this sort of chicken stealing in the outsystem is the form
piracy is most likely to take.

This requires shrinking sensor ranges so the mainport cant keep track of
the outsystem or our hypothetical pirate will have to accelerate on a
course to the starport, which will do nasty things to their chances of
intercepting ships.

*grin* no, I\'m talking about a woeful experiment in civilian grade
weaponary ... it\'s only 20 megajoules fer chrissake. Uncle Hengabar would
probably cancel Ditzie\'s allowance if he heard about it. Heck, it can very
nearly make money hauling cargo.

But seriously, if piracy is a threat, then you will get an evolution in
traders towards bigger and better-armed ships, to force concentration
against concentration.

I believe there would also be heavily lobbying of the appropriate
authorities for more potent weapons to be made available to merchants ("Of
course we\'re a licenced StarMerc Orbital Support Element. The cargo
hauling\'s just a sideline")

Shooting captains who do that would discourage the others, I think. The
risk of the pirate intercept being an inside job is just too high to do a
non-owner/captain\'s career much good. An owner captain may well be
bankrupted by loss of an entire speculative cargo.

And if the cargo was owned or insured by a financial institution or
syndicate, then it isnt going to be Joe Trader lobbying the authorities,
it\'s going to be the Bank\'s Vice President in Charge of Underwriting the
Subsector Duke\'s Lifestyle.

Hell, offer the crew the chance to cooperate in stealing the ship, in
exchange for a hundred thousand each in cash.

Hmmmm. It doesnt strike me as being incredibly Travelleresque, but I
suppose if the Pilot and Navigator (and Engineer I guess) had to have had a
couple of months experience with the ship to jump it correctly, it would
stop pirates taking ships.

If we assume the Far Trader does make it back to base, then I think you
have your Big Score.

This is true, but I am assuming (quite possibly incorrectly) that most in
system transport is of high bulk low value items like ore and food. I very
much doubt that these would be worth the bother for a pirate. However as
targets of opportunity for a desperate pirate they wouldn\'t be impossible.
This gives us a group of pirates who will never make it big because they go
for these low value targets, which are at least \'safe\'.

In TNE even non-grav X-Ray lasers will reach that far, so if the target
isn\'t maneuvering they\'re dead meat. I was intentionally generous to the
pirate in my post with everything I wasn\'t sure about, and I still found
that piracy is going to very difficult to get away with in the Third Imperium.

I can imagine this thing being the soldiers ultimate nightmare when it gets

armourer for weeks and it\'s raining and the bad guys have decided to pay
you a visit. And just think - more stuff to carry and run out of -
wonderful batteries (don\'t batteries die really quickly in sub-zero

According to TCS they\'d have a yard capacity of about 0.1 DT per year.

That depends on just what you mean by \'a valid place\'. As I\'ve said before,
I use pirates in the CT era in my own campaign, so obviously I regard even
the CT era as a valid place. I just don\'t think they make sense if you go
into the logical ramifications of the other (equally canonical) facts we
know about the CT era. The obvious solution is not to think about them.
As far as I am concerned, any discussion about pirates I get involved in
is fairly academic. I\'m not, nor have I ever been, arguing that pirates
should be retroactively excised from canon (As I am about a few other of
my pet hates, such as the alledged Vargr and Aslan invasions of the
Domain of Deneb during the Rebellion) . All I\'m saying is that they
don\'t make sense. Others disagree and we have had some interesting
discussions over that. And some less valuable, but I for one have gotten
at least a few valuable ideas from these discussions (The next pirate I
use is going to be a patrol vessel that has mutinied and can\'t visit
regular starports on their own.)

>There are practically NO borders on the Imperium, there isn\'t any
>colonial navy, I doubt the existance of even SDB\'s in tons of systems and

>piracy away?

I\'m telling you that I haven\'t done the calculations, but that I wouldn\'t
be at all surprised if it turned out that it wouldn\'t be economically
sound even in the T4 era. The logic goes something like this: A merchant
ship is a valuable piece of equipment. Preventing the loss of even one
fairsized ship per year will pay for a lot of patrol ship. Combined with
the fact that jump ships move in a way that in seagoing vessels would
correspond to jumping from outside one harbour to outside another and
the corrolary that you need only one single task force per empty system
to protect any number of merchant ships, I wouldn\'t be surprised if it
was economically sound to patrol every empty system with a significant
amount of merchant traffic. BTW, if a world is big enough to recieve a lot
of merchant ships, it is big enough to have SDBs. If it dosen\'t recieve
a lot of traffic, pirates have the problem that they have to get lucky.
Still, if stealing the whole ship is a viable option then it _may_ be
doable.

>I don\'t think so. Obviously it would be random luck but think of the money

>planet.

Unless the pirate is willing to take a check, there is a distinct upper
limit to the amount of wealth a single ship can get out of a TL7-8 planet
(to wit: a shipload of the most expensive good the world produces). And
they could hardly get more than some fraction of what the planet could
buy a legitimate ship for, now could they? And you\'re ignoring the high
initial investment for the pirate.

The Vargr invasion of Corridor (which a previous discussion showed could have
happened, but not the way it is usually portrayed (the irresistible wave
of Vargr overrunning a defenseless sector)) is not an accurate portrayal of
the Vargr corsair acitivity prior to the Rebellion.

Since my original claim was that piracy as portrayed in CT sources does not
make sense, CT would seem to be the best bet, but if you want to use one of
the other sets... no, I am most familiar with CT rules, so if you give me a
choice, I\'d prefer CT rules.

>CT, I\'ll quote passages from printed "canon" sources,

Passages that mention pirates you don\'t need to quote. If they didn\'t exist
I could hardly talk about "piracy as portrayed in CT sources", now could I?

Same answer.

There is propably too little information available to make for any

It leaves me claiming that piracy as portrayed in the CT sources does not
make sense, and it seems to me that you\'re saying much the same.

Just what is it you think you\'d like to change my mind about? You seem to be

Thom, one of the things I\'m resigned to have to repeat every few months
(because there are always new people arriving -- no reflection on you
intended) is that what people do with their personal Traveller campaigns
is IMO their own business and that if I don\'t specify that I\'m talking
about a particular variant TU, then I\'m talking about the official TU.

I\'m working on Yet Another CT Noble Rework, something I used to use a LOT when 
I was an active GM with my CT group.  It was roughly based on on an article I 
read in Adventure Gamer Magazine ca. 1981 called \'Scepter & Starship\'.  It was 
a pretty nifty variant for *Imperial* nobles, but needed some work as soon as 
MT came out.  Since I\'m in the process of doing a PBEM, I was gonna dust it 
off and redo it anyways, so...  <grin>

oath of fealty is to the Emperor *through* their King/Queen.

Planetary Viscounts and Viceroys outrank Imperial Dukes *ONLY* when on their 
home planet, otherwise, they are considered to be Imperial Dukes/Duchesses.

An Imperial Archduke would outrank everybody *but* the Planetary Crown 
Prince/Princess or Planetary King/Queen when on a planet with a hereditary 
monarchy in theory, but in practice would be the King\'s leigelord\'s immediate 
henchman.  (I.E., the king would owe fealty *to* the Emperor *THROUGH* the 
Archduke).

Imperial Viceroy is a title given to one who is in effect Imperial governor of 
several systems in a subsector.  They\'d be directly answerable to the Archduke.

Benefits, such as ways of generating holdings, etc, will follow in a further 
post.

I\'m surprised there were no weapons skills whatsoever.  Yes, he *is* \'the

to defend himself (Can you say \'Dulinor\'?).  I\'m sure he rectified this

I posted the following to the list a couple of years ago. Most of the

In any case, I hope it will prove of interest to you.

I\'m doing a \'Secret of The Ancients\' adventure for my players at the moment.
It\'s a different secret than the official one for several reasons; one, that
I don\'t like the whole Grandfather business at all, and, two, that even if I
did like it most of my players know it too, and that tends to ruin their
sense of wonder. And IMO the secret of The Ancients ought to be full of
wonder.

I have, however, tried to make my version fit all the clues left behind. My
Ancients left the universe in much the same state than the GDW Ancients did,
they just went about it differently. So some of he things I work out should
be useful even to those who want to stick with Grandfather and the kids.

At the moment I\'m trying to work out how an Ancient set of coyns looks. We 
know the names of the coyns in the set of 36 used by modern Droyne, and 
we\'ve been told what some of them looks like. The Ancient set consisted of
38 coyns and some of the older coyns (Aslan, Hiver, K\'kree) cannot be part 
of the set.

I\'ve listed the facts I\'ve used (numbered) and the assumptions I\'ve made
(lettered). If anyone can come up with facts I have missed or have some 
good ideas, please let me know.

1) Coyn sets found in Ancient sites range in size from 6 to 38 pieces.
   [_Imperial Encyclopedia_ p. 21].

a) The lesser sets found are subsets of one standard 38-coyn set, not 
   alternate sets.

b) The Ancient coyn set is identical to a pre-Ancient coyn set used by 
   pre-Ancient Droyne in prediction ceremonies.

2) Grandfather introduced the coyns as a tool of casting to a number of
   Chirper worlds around -75,000. [_Droyne_ pp. 6 and 45]. On some worlds
   the Chirpers gained the ability to caste, on others it didn\'t work
   (Vanejen, described in _Research Station Gamma_, is an example of the
   latter).

3) Grandfather modified the coyns on later visits and introduced the Aslan,
   Hiver and K\'kree coyns (at least). [_Secret of The Ancients_ p 32].

b) The Ancient coyn set consisted of six groups of six plus two specials.
   The six castes was one group. Void, Soil, Air, Gas, Water, and Fire was
   aother (these were the Droyne concept of elements: Earth (Soil), Water,
   Fire, Good (breahable) Air (Air), Bad (unbreathable) Air (Gas), and the
   absence of any of the other five (Void). 18 of the other coyns mentioned
   in the modern set were also in the Ancient set, though any grouping of 
   them into sixes lacks common themes (the third group, Darkness, Cold,
   Noise, Signal, Heat, and Light are pairs of opposites  -  but so are
   Genesis & Death and Defeat & Achievement from another of the groups).
   Anyway, the abovementioned plus Aspiration, Sacrifice, Beast, Mercenary,
   Voyages, Justice, Change, and Phoenix (can\'t really be a phoenix, of
   course; it must be a legendary Droyne beast with the same characteristics 
   as the phoenix) were also part of the Ancient set. Humaniti, Vargr, 
   Aslan, Hiver, and K\'kree was not. Remains the Droyne, which was one of
   the two special coyns. The remaining special coyn disappeared from the
   set when Grandfather re-introduced it, presumably because it was no
   longer relevant to the new Droyne. I suggest Eskaloyt, the Droyne
   homeworld itself. We now have 30+2 coyns. We lack one group of six, all
   of them coyns that were subsequently removed. One solution supplies not
   only a group with a common theme, but also the explanation of why they
   became redundant: Six prey animals native to Eskaloyt. Used by primitive
   Droyne to perform hunt magic.

So I suggest that the Ancient coyn set consisted of:

Worker	   Warrior	Drone	    Technician	 Sport	  Leader
Void	   Soil		Air	    Gas		 Water	  Fire
Darkness   Cold		Noise	    Signal	 Heat	  Light
Genesis	   Aspiration	Sacrifice   Defeat	 Death	  Achievement
Beast	   Mercenary	Voyages	    Justice	 Chance	  Phoenix
Hissayt	   Emissyob	Ayvaylk	    Bestoy	 Nebbay	  Hayyarn
Droyne	   Eskaloyt

But I can\'t just hand a list like that to my players. I\'d much rather give
them a description of what the coyns look like. And that\'s where I need some
help. I\'ve come up wih a description of most of the coyns. Some I like, some
I\'m not thrilled about, and some I downright dislike, but can\'t come up with
a good alternative to. So if you think of something you think is better, let
me know.

c) The modern coyns that duplicates Ancient coyns duplicates their design 
   too.

4) The first Grandfather set (in -75,000) consisted of 38 coyns and included
   one with a human and one with a flame [RSG pp. 4 and 38].

d) The set of six fake coyns menioned on page 13 of _Twilight\'s Peak_ are
   copies of real coyns (albeit modern coyns); they depict an aslan leader,
   a flame, a human, a cloud, an ice crystal, and a sine wave.

e) The depictions of the six castes on page 64 of TP and pp. 12-13 of
   _Droyne_ are taken from the coyn depictions of those castes.

f) The coyn shown on the back of _Droyne_ (two flames and the lower third
   is obsured by a droyne) is not a variant of the coyn wih the single
   flame.

Now to match coyns to descriptions. The first six are easy, thanks to
assumption e):

A massive droyne with digging tools		Worker
A tall droyne with sword and shield		Warrior
A flying droyne with a bottle[1]		Drone		
A medium droyne with tools and detector		Technician
A slender droyne with ball and cupstick[2]	Sport
A big-headed droyne with a spear[3]		Leader

[1] A feeding bottle, perhaps?
[2] A cupstick (_feldoss_ in oynprith) is normally used by Droyne Sports
    to play a sort of team-gladiatorial game for the amusement of the oytrip,
    rather like jai-alai. In combat, the cupstick can throw a very heavy
    object with killing force, multiplying the strength of the droyne\'s
    spindly arms considerably via its added moment of inertia, and can also
    be used for delivering impact fuse grenades. It is usually only handled
    by Sports-- hence its appearance on the coyn.
			[Thanks to Mike Metlay for input on _feldoss_"]
[3] A ceremonial spear, of course. See later.

The rest are a bit more tricky. The ones we know about, apart from the
Aslan and the human, was a flame, an ice crystal, a cloud, a sine wave,
and two flames. The flame and the ice crystal can be Fire and Cold. The 
cloud could be Air, Gas, or Water (or any of the philosophical concepts, 
of course; a cloud could be the symbol of hope to an agrarian community
("I do so hope it will rain")). The sine wave I eventually assigned to
Signal, which gave me a jagged zig-zag line for it\'s opposite, Noise.

Now, going down the list here are the symbols I came up with for each coyn:

Void	    Nothing engraved. A blank disc.
Soil	    A massive cliff. 
Air	    A white cloud (ie. the outline of a cloud).
Gas	    A black cloud (ie. a filled-in outline of a cloud).
Water	    A foam-flecked wave.
Fire	    A flame.

(Except for the Void and the Fire I\'m pretty dissatisfied with these, but
they are the best I can come up with. Any suggestions?)

Darkness    Two different sized cresents (The moons of Eskaloyt)
Light	    A sun.
Cold	    An ice crystal.
Heat	    A campfire (Two flames arising from a tree log). 
Signal	    A sine wave.
Noise	    A zig-zag line.

Voyages	    A sailing ship.
Justice	    A ceremonial spear[4].
Chance	    Six sticks in a random pattern[5].
Beast	    A ferocious six-limbed carnivore in mid-jump[6].
Mercenary   A big-headed droyne with arms and armour[7].
Phoenix	    A six-limbed animal surrounded by flames.

[4] Used by primitive Droyne leaders to dispatch those judged guilty or
    supurfluous to the community (This must have been before krinaytsyu
    became common; when it did, the Leader kept the spear as his symbol
    of authority).
[5] The Droyne use such sticks to generate random numbers according to 
    the pattern they fall in; coyn drawing is not, of course, considered 
    a random procedure since theyare assumed to predict future events.
[6] The _Stomfelk_, the most feared predator on Eskaloyt.
[7] I reasoned that mercenaries must be krinaytsoyni, and the most common
    krinaytsoyni are leaders. Hence a leader with weapons for a mercenary.

Genesis	    An egg.
Death	    A droyne skull.
Achievement A brimful cup.
Defeat	    An empty, tipped-over cup.
Hope	    Six stars in a random pattern[8].
Sacrifice   A droyne sitting with eyes closed[9].


[8] Well, what can I say? If I could come up with good symbols for Air
    and Gas, I\'d use the (rain) cloud for hope. As it is I\'m falling back
    on a Droyne constellation symbolising hope.
[9] A droyne commiting krinaytsyui, of course.

The Hissayt, Emissyob, Ayvaylk, Bestoy, Nebbay, and Hayyarm are various
six-limbed herbivores and omnivores once important to Droyne hunters. I
had descriptions of them all worked out, but those notes seems to have
dissappeared.

Finally the two special coyns:

Droyne	   A group of three droyne, a leader, a drone, and a worker[10].
Eskaloyt   Some strange irregular outlines (diferent on the two sides)[11].

[10] In other words, an alpha-male, a female, and a beta-male.
[11] Polar projections of Eskaloyt. Since they don\'t have the lattitude
     and longitude lines common to human map projections they are unlikely 
     to be identified as such by humans.

    'body' => 'I want to address a couple of points.  Call it my $0.02 worth.

Pirates and Bases:

I presume, at least IMTU, that successful pirates have some type of hide
away, a base of some sort.  That is where they "live" and "play".  It is
usually a life of fun and sun, and maybe some legitimate pursuits..., at
least until the money runs out.  Then they have to go back to work to
support themselves and their life of debauchery.  That means they then
go out and do piracy...  They may even have a "legitimate" cover they
use when in the local proximity, and only turn pirate when they are so
many parsecs away...

Accordingly, it\'s a real bummer when the authorities finally track down
where they are based, or when the locals find out that they are really
pirates, or when the locals get tired of their living loud and they get
run out.  Then they have to find a new quiet out-of-the-way neighborhood
where they can move in and begin to live again.  Again, YMMV.  

Pirates and Maintenance:

Now, if that ship is sitting there idle for much of the time, i.e.,
powered down because they are living life, how much maintenance is going
to be needed?  Or rather, is the annual maintenance based on annual
usage?  The maintenance required for a regularly run merchant ship will
be greater because it has much more use.  Same might hold true for a
true yacht that doesn\'t see much use...

And if the pirates are model citizens on their homeworld, they probably
would have easy access to maintenance facilities.

Older Starships:

I think this may tie in to the discussion a little while back on the
taxation policies.  If the Megacorps are taxed and they have the ability
to depreciate the ships, equipment, etc. it becomes better for them to
sell the old assets off so they can continue to take deductions.  

Also, as some others mentioned, the appearance and age of the vessel may
make some difference.  There is something to be said for having the best
ships available, and no maintenance problems.  40 year old vessels of a
certain class may need to be "grounded" in order to check the tendency
of the grid working loose, or the CG mountings, or the "wiring through
the center line fuel tanks [like 747s(?) recently].  If you don\'t have
that class or that age (10 years maybe?) then you keep running. 
Otherwise you have to show proof of modification/check when coming into
class A/B starports in order to get clearance...

I think that a megacorp would only keep older starships around when they
were in financial difficulties and couldn\'t come up with the cash to
fund new ones.

I also like the idea of increasing the costs a bit as the ship ages.  I
haven\'t given it much thought yet, but since it is normal for people
mustering out to receive starships (some of which are older) it makes
sense to me that they have a long and useful life.  But it would become
more expensive.  And there may be the requirement to have whole systems
replaced...  new jump drive, new pp, new maneuver drive... etc. that
would require a loan/capital investment.

I can see it now in 1116 3I...

I think the point Ian was making is that in the Traveller rules skipping
your annual maintenance is a quick way to, depending on which misjump rules
you use, turn your ship into a multi-million Cr writeoff, or a coffin.


Unfortunately the "decreased operational life" will be measured in months,
and the price they pay (using T4 misjump rules) will be their lives.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I read the rules as being guidelines for the ref, especially the
maintenance rules. I allow more ways to perform annual maintenance
than lying up for two weeks every year in a class B+ starport.
These alternate methods are not faster, not cheaper (though the
price may be in time and hazard rather than credits), and not by
any stretch of the imagination as reliable or as effective - but a
ship that can\'t stay for two weeks in a starport (like a Corsair)
may have no choice. 

Honest merchants wouldn\'t dream of using these "alternate methods"
in lieu  of the maintenance recommended in their owner\'s manuals, any 
more than a law-abiding citizen would go to a black-market surgeon for
a gunshot wound. 

The most important rule I\'ve ever seen in any RPG manual is the one
that tells the GM to make it work as he sees fit. It helps that I\'ve got
some canon behind me (Zhodani Coreward expeditions penetrating
more than a year\'s travel from their bases, for example), but having
it work IMTU is enough. Of course, as always, YMMV.

module.

The reference states that one difference between TL15 and TL16
ships is: durability.  A top of the line TL15 military vessel
will last 100 years.  A TL16 vessel will last at least 1000
years.  This is probably due to a revolution in ship design.

Thus, things under TL16 will be more trouble than they\'re worth
after 100 years.  I\'m not sure if a 40-year-old starship is
worth having -- I think it should be useful for tramp traders;
however, no serious commercial venure would use them IMTU,
and after 80 years they are just old leaky buckets.  A corporation
would make money while making payments, then just trade in old
ships for new ones as they cross some wear or age boundary.
Old ships would be recycled, scrapped, or sold, depending on 
which is most convenient at the time.

By the way: is there some kind of \'curing\' process that goes on
with the construction of a ship hull?  Is there massive red
tape that can never be avoided in building a ship?  What takes
it so long?  Not that I mind: I rather think it should be that
way.  However, some theories might be nice as to WHY?

Perhaps a logarithmic curve mapping wear to reliability would
serve nicely.

Sure. Now jump the captured ship to your base with the same cutting

I was using that as an example of what would happen to an honest
merchant who tried some alternatives to regular annual maintenance
when he lands his ship in a legal starport. Honest merchants
use normal annual maintenance - it\'s cheaper, faster, safer and
better, and doesn\'t get you in trouble with the Safety Inspectors.
People who can\'t show their ships in a legal starport have to make
do with what they can.

They\'ll do it with nothing bigger than a turret-mount beam laser or

private military-grade flotillas than it does for Pirates - in fact, it
sees personal "defense forces" as more of a threat to the Imperium
than any pirate.

But seriously, if piracy is a threat, then you will get an evolution in
traders towards bigger and better-armed ships, to force concentration

These "authorities" have their orders from a bureacracy a year\'s time

With the exception of the occaisional maverick local commander,
the Navy\'s decisions are based on policies with a much bigger picture
than a few tramp freighters lost to pirates in a backwater subsector.

Megacorps might force a policy change. The 10kdtn+ ships megacorps
use would barely notice a pirate attack, so pirates leave them alone. 
To those in power (Navy fleets, megacorps, high-pop worlds) the
Piracy threat is something out of adventure holovids, something that
happens to other people - and the people in power make lots of decisions
about things like what an honest trader is allowed to arm his ship with.

Hmmmm. It doesnt strike me as being incredibly Travelleresque, but I
suppose if the Pilot and Navigator (and Engineer I guess) had to have had a
couple of months experience with the ship to jump it correctly, it would
stop pirates taking ships.

I was referring to how you can watch the ship you captured enter jump,
but (for a week, anyway) you can\'t see where it\'s going - or even if it
went anywhere at all. The captured navigator pops the clutch a second
early or late, the ship enters jumpspace for a week and goes nowhere - 
he figures that he has a better chance of survival, even with your thugs 
on board, if he\'s in a civilized system with no jump fuel aboard.

What, throw away a 14MCr lifeboat? Cap\'n, we can file the serial numbers
off it and toss it in the capture bay, no hacking through a scrambled

Doable, though - assuming the pirates can overcome all the other
difficulties and make off with the ship, such a thing would be a good
idea - the Captain, in fear for his life and the lives of his crew, may have
already taken the lifeboat and abandoned ship, hoping the pirates are
more interested in his vessel than they are in chasing him. A Sub Liner
(Lifeboat, passengers who can afford really big lawsuits aboard) might
especially see this happen - after all, it isn\'t like the Captain\'s abandoning
a ship he owns or anything.

  Probably correct for stuff going to the mainworld (wouldn\'t factories
be there?), but there\'s still distribution of finished goods from there

  Even a small craft has a power plant; 1 Dt of fusion reactor is 3 MCr (HG).
That presumes a thruster equipped vessel; a slug of ore sent ballistic is
unlikely to be worth the trouble.

  A good one would be to order a consignment of moderate value to be
delivered direct from another system (paying a premium, presumably)
and then seize the ship when it arrives at your "mining camp". OC,
at this stage you\'ll shortly be on the most wanted list (IMTU) but
if you get away or have/find a buyer for the ship then you\'ll be
very well paid for your efforts.

In considering the effects of time on spaceships, I think it is
constructive to look at aircraft for some parallels.

General Aviation aircraft (the little guys) often can be sold for
what you paid for them, if they have been adequately maintained.
It is not at all rare to find 20 and 30 year old airframes in
regular use today. Aircraft require an annual maintenance check,
along with operating time based inspections. Some are mandatory
for all uses, and others are only required (in a regulatory sense)
for craft in commercial service (including rental). 

Abstracting this for game purposes, I see well maintained ships
(at least those of a "standard" design) holding their value
pretty well, so long as they are properly maintained. Proper 
maintenance is a code phrase for "hole in space into which you
throw money". Looking at the GA example, it would appear that
the value actually tends to decline for "non-classic" birds 
when one factors out inflation.

If one considers the OTU economic model to be approximately 0%
inflation, then the value should hold well. If one takes the long
term inflation rate to be 1%, that would devalue a ship to 67%
over 40 years. .5% would get it down to 80%. 2% would drop it to 45%.

yours,
Michael

who had the brain capacity of a leprous wombat that\'s been rotting for the

A brief summary (from memory, that email has long since vanished in one of
the many Windows NT system crashes), is that:

1) file types weren\'t recorded properly, so that double-clicking on a
document doesn\'t open an application

2) many graphics documents appeared damaged (GIF files that couldn\'t be
read by GIF-Converter, for example)

3) The HTML pageswere all neamed using Microsoft three-letter extensions
(ie. ".htm") instead of their original four-letter extensions (ie.
".html"), whcih meant clicking on a hyperlink didn\'t work (because the
internal hyperlinks were still four-letter extensions).

I have been lurking for some time now and this is my first input to the 
mailing list, so bear with me. 

Seeing the discussions Piracy and the 100-diameter limitations. I have 
notice that everyone is limiting them selves to a 100-diameter limit.

There has to be more than traveling from a world surface/orbit to 
100-diameters out, through Jump, to 100-diameters out  to the world 
surface/orbit.  Granted the size of the world and starport will be a 
factor in the equation, but I am not going to worry about that.

For going after ship traveling the interstellar trade routes, some of 
captains will for go buying fuel at the starport and others will brave 
skimming a gasgaint.  Travel between the gasgaint and the port of call 
will take more that a few hours (you can do the math if you want).  The 
area between the port of call and the gasgaint would give ample time to 
strike and remove all the cargo and be able to jump out at the sign of a 
patrol ship.

I see the big prize as being the interplanetary ships.  They are going 
to be carrying supplies and good to and from the smaller bases / 
colonies/ outposts / whatever.  It would be easier to plan an attack on 
one of these ships because there would be a probably be a schedule for 
them to run on. There would even be the chance that there would only be 
a skeleton crew on board. Travel only being a day or two, why would they 
need more.

The 100 diameter limit is really only important if you\'re trying to raid
starships as opposed to space ships. You can raid an insystem freighter
nearly anywhere.

Only a foolish or desperate merchant would skim a gas giant.  You risk your
entire ship and in the case of HEPlar engines, you end up burning all the
fuel you skimmed when you try to leave orbit.  At a mere 100 Cr per dTon for
unrefined fuel, why would you risk the giant?  Now, if you\'re out in the
wilds with no starport and only a gas giant to refuel from, that\'s a
different story.  But no pirate would be able to sustain themselves
indefinitely while waiting for his prey to stumble into the system.

This is exactly why Merchants don\'t do that.

These are also the type of ships that have escorts.  Convoy duty etc.

I have been lurking for some time now and this is my first input to the 
mailing list, so bear with me. 

Seeing the discussions Piracy and the 100-diameter limitations. I have 
notice that everyone is limiting them selves to a 100-diameter limit.

There has to be more than traveling from a world surface/orbit to 
100-diameters out, through Jump, to 100-diameters out  to the world 
surface/orbit.  Granted the size of the world and starport will be a 
factor in the equation, but I am not going to worry about that.

For going after ship traveling the interstellar trade routes, some of 
captains will for go buying fuel at the starport and others will brave 
skimming a gasgaint.  Travel between the gasgaint and the port of call 
will take more that a few hours (you can do the math if you want).  The 
area between the port of call and the gasgaint would give ample time to 
strike and remove all the cargo and be able to jump out at the sign of a 
patrol ship.

I see the big prize as being the interplanetary ships.  They are going 
to be carrying supplies and good to and from the smaller bases / 
colonies/ outposts / whatever.  It would be easier to plan an attack on 
one of these ships because there would be a probably be a schedule for 
them to run on. There would even be the chance that there would only be 
a skeleton crew on board. Travel only being a day or two, why would they 
need more.

I felt your idea was a very good one. I would add this as well.
Let us assume the given solar system had the following orbits:

	1) molten lava surfaced planet
	
	2) Earth like world 
	
	3) Dry sandy covered world like Dune

	4) Large Asteroid field Rich in mineral ores

	5) Large Gas giant with moons like Jupiter

	6) Small gas giant with a small asteroid belt forming
		rings and etc.

Now lets assume that the main space port "A" is a orbital facility
above the 2nd planet. We can also assume that there are three type
"B" space ports on the planets surface.

Also lets say that there is a type "C" on the surface of the 3rd
planet . Then there could be a number of Corp only starports type
"D" located in the Asteroid belt. There may even be a type "E" on
one of the moons around the Large gas giant planet as well.

Ok now in this system lets call the 2nd world "Homeworld" and lets 
say that there are a number of Corps that running mining operations
in the asteroid belts. Also lets say that a number of the corps have
manufacturing colonies on the third desert planet. There might be a few 
other installations scattered throughout the system as well.

Now I\'d have to say that there would be a lot of system ships flying
around. Shuttles, cargo haulers, drone ships, and etc. I would also
say that there would be a lot of Space faring ship traffic coming 
into the system from the jump point to most likely the main system
start port in orbit above the "Homeworld".

So with all this going on, this would most likely make for a
Pirates dream and great hunting ground. There would be plenty
of places to hide and play.

Also throw in some fighting between the corps, and some civil
unrest between Homeworld and Dune planet you have a perfect place
for any group of players to do it all. Heck you could have many
adventures and plots in this system alone

What do you think?

This is a generic problem with foreign file systems on Macs. You need to
set up PC Exchange to recognize and associate certain DOS extensions
with specific applications. This _isn\'t_ a hybrid disk, so no file
type/creator information is there. Also, one thing I\'ve mentioned to
Bryan; none of the Mac files except the binhexed ones are ok. You can\'t
stick a Mac binary file, like a program or even a .sit file on a PC
disk. Ultimately, the solution to this is to burn this as a hybrid
HFS/9660 disk; this ensures that the data/resource forks are laid down
correctly. (It also fixes, for Macs at least, the .htm/.html problems,
since the filenames on the Mac side are preserved intact)

send me a list, and I\'ll look at \'em. part of the problem may lie with
Gif-Convertor, but there\'s a bunch of various GIFs and Jpegs over the
years I\'ve had problems with on the Mac but not on the PC. Usually the
problem is with a messed up EOF or file length marker...for some reason,
the PC program I use (LView and LView Pro) seems to be more forgiving
for that error than Mac programs.

This\'ll mess up _everyone_ not just Macs, and is a problem with the
format of the disk. It\'s an ISO 9660 level 1 which spec\'s a 8.3
filename. There are extensions to the ISO 9660 format, but they\'re not
universally compatible (IIRC, Apple\'s Foreign File Access extension,
which is needed to read an ISO 9660 disk, only recognizes level 1
filenames.) Apple\'s next system Rev , 8.5 is supposed to have greater
uspport for the Unicode character set, which allows for 256 character
filenames. I think that\'s also ione of the 9660 extensions, since
Unicode\'s pretty well used in the Un*x world, as well as Windows, and
IIRC OS/2 (right Eris?)

The only solution to this is to pre-massage all the html before burning
the cd to ensure that all the links are valid. 

This _also_ means going through the code and replacing _all_ absolute
local links with relative ones. This is simply good HTML hygiene,
anyway, since it makes your code portable.

This simply means that TML-CD II is going to require a fair bit of work,
and someone with a Mac and a CD-Rom burner, since no PC software I\'ve
yet found can write a HFS partition to a CD. (and if anyone knows any
differently, PLEEZE let me know!!) While we\'re at it, a html-ization of
the entire disk would be good...and I\'m sure Bryan can manage that in
his copious free time ;-)

Also, while we\'re on the CD subject..I went browsing through the old TML
bundles...in TML bundle #2 there\'s a list of the charter
members...Leonard Erikson was on that list...Congrats, Leonard, you are
officially the \'Eldest Fart\' on the list, because I don\'t think anyone
else on that list is still here.

Man, that was an eye opener too...I haven\'t seen so many bang paths in a
long time! And someone was asking about a coule of the .com addresses,
because their Arpanet DNS host list needed updating...BY HAND!!!!

Maybe: The vast majority of traffic is between high population systems.

I think population dominates the traffic statistic; TL, distance, 
  starport class, and some other traits figure significantly, but in the 
  end population is the key.

Implication: I think the population of both the source and destination 
  world are the greatest indicators of traffic between them.

	Nope I never got your message (else you would have recieved a reply and some

some more followup so I can fix what I can.
	On the Gif\'s, Bruce mentioned some problems there too, even on one he had
sent me. Unluckily I have no idea what the cause might be.
	I\'ve fixed at least some of the suffix problems by appending .txt to the TML

	On the HTML files, if I get a list, I\'ll see what I can do about fixing those

Downport

Ideas borrowed heavily from White Dwarf article:

I. Airstrip construction (5km long)				KCr50 +    ??
   A. quality/materials						up to MCr1 ??
   B. attached beacon/etc					MCr10      ??
   C. landing-pad-only version (1km diameter circle)		KCr10 +    ??

II. Parkbay construction
   A. # of single parkbays (11 bays, 1 VTOL launch area)	MCr100 ??
   B. # of six-parkbay sets (66 bays, 6 VTOL launch areas)	MCr700 ??

III. Shipyard
   A. Repair yard						BCr10  ??
   B. Construction yard						BCr100 ??
   C. Warehouses						MCr100 ??

IV. Bases
   A. Scout base (+ 1 parkbay)					MCr200 ??
   B. Naval base (+ 1 airstrip and a set of 6 parkbays)		BCr100 ??

V. Terminal
   A. enough building(s) to hold lounges, admin & shops		MCr1-MCr100 ??
   B. quick access to Startown					-
 
VI. Infrastructure
   A. Maglev for starships (airstrip(s) to parkbay(s))		MCr10-BCr1  ??
   B. Maglev for humans						MCr1-MCr100 ??
   C. Control tower						MCr100 +    ??
   D. Fuel station						MCr10-BCr10 ??

So, an \'E\' class starport might cost Cr10,000 to MCr10;
    a  \'D\' class starport might cost MCr110;
    a  \'C\' class starport might cost MCr220;
    a  \'B\' class starport might cost BCr11;
    an \'A\' class starport might cost BCr110.

I have NO IDEA if these numbers are even CLOSE to what they should be...
And this doesn\'t include surface-orbit shuttles...

see this info and i (and my wallet) really don´t feel like buying the rest again (even if that
were possible, as i never saw these books in any store in germany).

I did a quick analysis of TNE starship prices using wear value, and
compared them to the cost of a re-build. I found that ships with wear
values of more than 5 (out of 10) cost more to re-build than you would get
selling them after the re-build. That suggests to me that unless you can\'t
get a replacement it\'s a good idea to sell your ship when its wear value
reaches 5, which at +1 wear value per 10 years just happens to be when it\'s
40 years old. Of course with re-builds every 40 odd years a ship is good
for 100s of years, but after the first century it\'s going to get less and
less benefit from being rebuilt and break down more and more.

From Jupiter to Earth at 1G takes about a week, and at turn around you\'ll
be moving at about 1% of Light Speed (assuming thrusters), which will make
vector matching quite hard. Sensor range will also be a problem. If you\'re
using TNE or CT style sensors the pirate probably won\'t be able to see the
ship until it\'s almost on top of it (and will have to be right on the main
flight path making him vulnerable to patrols) and will ahve a hell of a job
catching up to the vistim before a patrol vessel does. If you use rules
that give longer sensor ranges the pirate will be able to see the victim a
good distance away, but will be seen early, too. I don\'t think many pirates
will have military grade sensors, because they\'ll be hard to explain. Those
that do will probably be privateers gone pirate, and IMO the IN will be
very interested in catching them so they can make examples of them.

IMO any system that has enough traffic to make piracy attractive will have
enough money to be able to patrol the area around any object that has a
significant number of people or amount of industry. This forces the pirates
to stay out in mid-system and play \'catchup\' as the merchants come past.
This is aninherently risky thing to do, because a pirate won\'t know a ship
is a patrol ship pretending to be a merchant until it gets reasonably
close, but the patrol ship knows that any ship just sitting in mid-system
is either up to no good or in trouble. The pirate can\'t afford to sit and
wait too long trying to get an ID, because every minute he waits the other
ship will be that much harder to catch before it gets inside the patrol
umbrella of its destination world.

With HEPLaR (or other reaction engines) in system travel takes a very long
time. IMO this means that any cargo of reasonable value will go by
in-system jump. Even going after ships moving in N-space between planets
will be difficult because they\'ll probably see you a long time before you
can intercept, and that means that any patrol boat with a decent number of
G-turns can probably get there about the same time the pirate does, and the
patrol ship doesn\'t have the match vectors or jump out afterwards only
intercept, and so it\'s got a much easier job.

I\'d object to Viscount being higher than a duke... as a viscount is a
powerful baron or a weak count... roughly equivalent to a marquis.

IMTU, Viscount is an alternate title for a Marquis. Read it as Vice Count.
(Bad pun, but reflective of the real relationship. Maybe use Grand Duke, or
push duke down one and add archcount/grand count (only a few historical
"archcounts", none were official, but were counts/Comtes with other
counts/comtes looking to them.

Also, again IMTU, based upon the Noble career from MT/CTSupp4, SS A is
Gentry (implied by being able to enter the Noble Career), not truly nobles,
but not truly commoners, either.

And, again imtu, but this time based upon Real World  heraldry, a
hereditary knighthood is a Bannerette, sometimes corrupted to baronette
(even tho real baronettes were titles sold to raise money for the corwn of
england). I put a Banerette/KnightCdr/Baronette as B + 1/2; any hereditary
knight (rolled SS of 11) as a Bannerette. Any non-bannerette promoted to
soc 12 outside the Noble Career generally gets a Knight Commander, rather
than baron, unless further promoted.

Viceroy as a title is also quizical; it was generally not a noble title,
but a title of naval governorship.

Also note that historically, grand duke usually meant a duke of the royal
family, or a royal lineage\'s Duke (such as Finland under Imperial Russia)
where the Duchy had a Royal Family, but were not Sovereigns.

"Disruption of kilometre-sized asteroids by energetic collisions 

Recent numerical studies suggest that \'rubble-pile\' asteroids
(gravitationally bound aggregates of collisional debris) are common in
the
Solar System, and that self-gravitation may equal or exceed material
cohesion for planetary bodies as small as several hundred metres.
Because
analytical scaling relations for impact cratering and disruption do not
extend to this size regime, where gravity and material strength are both
important, detailed simulations are needed to predict how small
asteroids
evolve through impact, and also to ascertain whether powerful explosions
offer a viable defence against bodies headed for a collision with Earth.
Here the authors present simulations, using a smooth-particle
hydrodynamics code, of energetic impacts into small planetary bodies
with internal structure ranging from solid rock to porous aggregate.
They
find that the outcome of a collision is very sensitive to the
configuration
of pre-existing fractures and voids in the target. A porous asteroid (or
one
with deep regolith) damps the propagation of the shock wave from the
impactor, sheltering the most distant regions, while greatly enhancing
the
local deposition of energy. Multiple-component asteroids (such as
contact
binaries) are also protected, because the shock wave cannot traverse the
discontinuity between the components. The authors conclude that the
first impact to significantly fragment an asteroid may determine its
subsequent collisional evolution, and that internal structure will
greatly
influence attempts to disrupt or deflect an asteroid or comet headed
towards Earth.

While this letter is specifically about deflecting asteroids on a earth
collision path, if this is true it would have considerable implications
regarding asteroid mining as well, not to mention asteroid hulls....

You can be spotted using your vac suit on any airless world.  It
is also fairly easy to simply ask to see someone\'s Vac suit.  But,
before we beat the idea of vac suits as a give away to death and
you run out with various disguising techniques, this was only one
example that I came up with off the top of my head.  They
will also beable to report the weapons they are carrying,  the
race of the crew.  The general size of the people.  Now there will
be things you can do to mitigate it, but person contact is going to
give away clues.  I\'m not saying it will be avoided at all costs,
but it will be a factor.

Well, if they don\'t have a launch, etc. then you either have to take

kill them.

Well, first of all, computers are only a few MCr in CT, in MT a
merchant would have a computer that cost in the hundreds of thousand
of credits.  Also, you are assuming that the only way to destroy
the data in it is to destroy the computer.  You probably just take
the memory modules.  As to a repeater, they won\'t work if they
get spotted and not everyone will have them (if piracy is uncommon)
for the same reason that most people don\'t have devices to stop
carjackings (though in Traveller there is less incentive because,
unlike the carjacking devices, the repeater won\'t stop them
taking your ship, it will only give you a bit of satisfaction
to know they have a better chance of getting caught).  In any
case, data from a computer doesn\'t make the value of eye witness
info useless, it only adds to it.

It would be a lot less than if you took the entire ship.

Pocket Empires (in the charts at the end) gives cost and time factors for

NOT to mention that in MTU ships have jump exit errors that increase the
distance from the home world.  It works like this...

A jump takes 6-8 days.  Right.
The planet and system is moving how fast?  Fast enough.  Some one else can
do the math...

With the random factor of exiting jump space and the distance involved there
are some ships that are popping out in at all distances from the target
planet.  A good pirate will wait, out from the planet, with all systems shut
down and wait for the "straggler" to fall into his area.

In a large system, with 1000\'s of ships entering all the time, some will end
up waaaaaayyyy out.  If the pirate has a FAST ship they can make it there,
bounce the ship, take the expensive items, (forget the cargo, grab  the
computers, passenger storage, vehicles, etc) and JUMP.

In the end, if you want it, it can happen.

can be presumed to be impossible.  I find this unrealistic.

The lesson I take from history is that the odds of people
finding a way around any such plan are high enough that
you are better off figuring it is going to happen.  This
has been true enough in law enforcement that most of
the careful officials never attempt to claim that a new
plan will eliminate a crime.  Those that do are usually
proven to optimistic.

After all, if we were to take someone from the 50\'s and
describe all the monitoring camera\'s, forensic techincis,
etc. that we have today, the approach described above would
lead him to conclude the the crime of breaking and enter
would be impossible.   After all, the cost of such a system
is minor compared the cost of the valuable in most houses.
Responses of how such approaches might not work would
degenerate in to ideas for having multiple cameras
so one can watch the others (or hiding them so they
can\'t be circumvented), motions detectors, etc, whether
they would be required by insurance, etc.

That is on reason I am so dubious of claims that any crime
would be "impossible" in Imperium.  Another is one that is 
encapsulated in the example above is that every system that 
can protect something will be used as long as the cost is only 
fraction of what it is protecting.  After all, the cost of the 
contents of a house is a lot more than the cost of a security 
system (and if you included the safety of the occupants, there 
is no comparison).  Yet home security systems are far from 
universal.  The reason is that this approach misses the fact 
that the odds of the crime also enter into the equation.  You 
don\'t spend hundreds on a security system if you thing that a
dead bolt lock will keep the odds of some breaking in acceptably 
low.  This is the same approach that keeps people from moving
their arms enough to fasten their seat belts in the face of
the death and horrible injury that they could prevent.

More seriously I\'ve seen nothing that would cast new light
on the issue.  You will have to get into it without me.

(Ironically, I recently posts on the "GURPS side" a comment
that nobody beats a dead horse like the TML beats a dead
horse. :-)

Depends on what you mean by exceedingly rare.  I think piracy
will be uncommon enough that the average starfarer will hear
about it happening but will probably not encounter it themselves.

I don\'t think they would be "massive".  The certainly wouldn\'t need

Actually the were my first example.  I later through of others.  To me,

Yeah, except that jump stations don\'t need to be static.

I\'m not sure what you mean.  _You_ claim they wouldn\'t exist for any
traffic because the would be taken out.  If that is true, then the
precauations mentions certainly _are_ necessary for shipping companies
to reap the savings.

I actually, I had meant the above to say how I didn\'t see how
being expected would stop piracy (getting back to an earlier 
point) since the effect at your destination of piracy is that 
you either simply don\'t show up or you do show up but you
have been robbed.  I just wrote
it too fast and forgot to insert a reference to piracy after
the reference to hijacking.

Hogwash.  I just insist that if someone has show something
based on their point of view, they have only proven this
it doesn\'t work in their point of view and that an 
economic analysis that is based on a set of assumptions
only holds when those assumption hold.

I would also caution you to not label any point of view
as "bizzare" or "ideological".  I don\'t think you posts
can be considered so much more perceptive than others as 
to justify that.

But again, you are not required to take one benefit to get
the other.  So if circumstance make it impossible to get
one (because the station are to big and stationary) that
does nothing to mean that one can\'t simple settle for
the other benefit.

I didn\'t abandon them.  You never realy responded to them.

No.  They come out when the ships that need them arrive.
The enemy ships have to show up at just that time and
if they can catch and defeat convoys so realiably, then it really
doesn\'t matter what system you are using.

That is the point I was making.  It seem that the worry is that there is 
very little time to raid a ship trying to make its way out to the 100-D 
limit. When you have nothing but time when traveling within the system.

When you are short on cash you do desperate things. As for burning up 
all your fuel trying to escape the gravity well, I dont buy that. A 
good case is the communication satellite that they flew around the moon 
to place it in a higher orbit. It did not have the fuel to boot it 
directly into the orbit, but it did have enough fuel to escape the 
gravity well of earth and be captured by the moon. Which promptly sent 
it back.  Also the Mars Global Surveyor, it has been skimming the 
Martian atmosphere. A ship would have to keep the orbit high enough so 
it will only take a little thrust to escape. After the last pass through 
the atmosphere of the gasgaint at the high point of the orbit fire the 
thrusters to raise the low point out of the atmosphere and the next 
flyby would (probably, with a little help if needed) slingshot you out 
of the GG gravity well.

Only Mega Corps and military supplies ships will have escorts worth a

big trick here is, dont go after the ones that will have the escorts.

    'index' => 'cm514',
    'month' => '06',
    'body' => 'A thought about raiding Intra-system vessels (supply shuttles, etc):

Orbital mechanics can be a pirate\'s best friend. If a pirate knows the
positions of two trade points in the system (for example, the mainworld
and a major mining station) and their orbits, he will be able to calculate
with Navigation skill what the most time (for thrust-plate vessels) or
fuel (for HEPlar vessels) efficient path is between the two for any time in
the future. Included in this path calculation will be the exact velocities
of craft at any point on this path - how fast they must be going at
point Z on the path at time T to make sure they match velocities with
their destination when they get there. Since cargo shuttles are usually
pretty standardized, you can make do with very few variables here.

If the path is at any point outside the 100-diameter limit of solar or
planetary bodies, you\'re in business. In a neighboring system, take a
course (allowing for relative velocities of the star systems and any
other numbers you can crunch) that will place you on a parallel vector
(direction _and_ velocity) to a supply shuttle in your target system
on the most efficient path. If you have intelligence that tells you when
the shuttle leaves, or if there is a shuttle every X hours, even better.
Once you\'ve matched the vector, jump.

When you reach the target system, you should be in a good target area
and at a vector that will be similar to that of every ship nearby that is
taking this path. Make the modest course change to match a nice
juicy shuttle, intimidate it into surrender, ditch the crew out the
hatch (be nice, give them vacc suits/rescue balls) and swallow that
95-ton shuttle in your 100dtn capture bay (as found on the classic
CT 400-tn Corsair ship). Jump away long before the gendarmes
(in orbit around the most valuable in-system targets rather than zipping
about with intercept vectors) can intercept.

You\'re not flying the stolen ship, so you don\'t need to spend time you
don\'t have getting control of it. It\'s not a starship, so the Imperials won\'t
be as interested. And even if you can\'t get anything for the cargo
(say you regularly use up all the supplies for life support and keeping
the crew happy) the shuttle, even at 80% markdown, is still worth
7 MCr or so.

This tactic will work in a Traveller universe where:
a> Ships don\'t have to exit jump only at the 100d limit, they
can exit farther out if they want.
b> Calculation of jump exit points is precise on a star system
scale, rather than on a parsec scale.
c> Ships maintain the same velocity on jump exit that they had
on jump entrance.

The several hour variance in jump exit times may or may not be
a problem - if you come out the same distance from the star you
planned on (and some explanations of jump space support that
you will even if you are a day early or late) then your vector should
still be appropriate for the position on the flight path you are jumping to.

What you will get is Piracy that is usually directed at intra-system craft
(using jump capabilites mainly for the getaway) but attacking starships
on the odd occaision when the opportunity presents itself. The Pirate
will appear out of nowhere, spend an hour or two overtaking the
nearest shuttle on the flight path, grab it and jump away while the
local patrols are still warming up their engines.

The local patrol will (once they\'ve lost some shuttles) start taking what
countermeasures they can - but unless they have the authority and
resources to either send a near-continuous stream of patrol ships 
along the best transit path, or force the supply shuttles to convoy,
there isn\'t much they can do.

One countermeasure is to have the supply shuttles take a less-efficient
path - the vector differences between the best path and the second-best
path can be radically different (path two might loop around an inner planet
or something). This will cost time and money, so like all countermeasures
there is an expense involved that will not be paid unless a need is seen.

The port authorities might also start taking a second or third hard look
at all those independent miners who jump in-system every couple of
weeks in their beat-up Seekers. Even if they are totally innocent, 
they might fall under suspicion as spies for the nearby pirates.

He could hold several titles.. As I recall, Duke (later Archduke) Norris
was also Baron Yori.

This provides a nice social out for the high-ranking.  They can go to a

Some day (when the DSR2 rewrite starts...) this will go into the rules. 
The first turn you fire at a target with a passive sensor, all fire
will be at -2 DM or so since you don\'t have an exact range, unless the sensor
operator makes a Impossible sensor roll, +1 DM for every point of signal.
Active sensors are immune. So, if you\'re stalking someone, you have to decide
to light him up with LIDAR just before firing or take the chance of missing.

Good point - although I think what I really need to do is just have a whole
new column for LIDAR (for example, visual signatures go up as the target 
gets closer to the sun, which LIDAR shouldn\'t...but you\'re right that LIDAR
should use the visual dust etc. modifiers (or, more precisely, half of the
modifiers.)

Maybe Coyns from 1130+ have a Virus Coyn? Replacing one of the "special"

Thanx for the help (both Hans and William).  This is very interesting and
should come in useful.  Hans, how did your "secret of the ancients" work out?
I\'m using the "official" secret and a couple others all mixed together.

For one, I am using an alien race like the Greys (to answer someone else\'s
question) as a race that became starfaring after the Ancients Final War, but
before the Vilani (and by some time... say c-20,000 Imperial)... Their
homeworld, etc is a great mystery, but they\'ve payed visits to Terra, Vland,
Sylea, Zhant but always stay just beyond the ability to detect them.  Maybe
they were an experiment of one of the draysaskin.  Whatever the case, they
have interest in humaniti. 

Further, there is at least one other "elder race" as well, maybe many.  (I
just like the idea of Babylon 5\'s First Ones too much to leave things solely
to the "younger" races).  Some have died, some have gone to other galaxies.
Many ruins are mixed among the ancients (in fact ancient sites were happily
inhabited by more than a couple).  Most have erased all evidence of their
existence (or been erased themselves).  Some have hung around and are watching
the younger races (and maybe even interfering now and then).  Most are gone.

The few that remain in the Charted Space are way above being affected (or even
noticed) by Virus.

Of course, this is way beyond my players (at least for now) and is mostly an
excercise in the abilities of (really) high tech levels. : )

This is probably because the LIDAR rules are _wrong_.  For the same sensor size
and power output, a lidar has dramatically lower range than a radar -- range
for an active sensor is generally proportional to fourth root (power output *
sensor area * wavelength) and inversely proportional to the square root of the
scan width.  As such, 10u IR lidar should have only 10% of the range of 10cm
radar.  The advantage of lidar is that you can focus it on a much smaller area
- -- if you focus as tight as you can go, the lidar has 10x the range (and is
scanning 1/10,000 the area) and with its higher resolution is a much better
targeting sensor.

If the issue is actually obscurement (such as atmosphere) rather than
glare/noise (dust), you would use the full modifier -- it subtracts both from
the signal which reaches the target, and the signal which is returned.

Not impossible, simply very difficult...aim it at the target, fire, and
look for the flash as the Mesons decay. If the flash obscures the ship,
you\'re firing short, if the ship abscures the flash, you\'re firing long.
\'walk\' the beam decay along the line of sight until you hit, sort of
like walking an artillery barrage into a target.

Of course if you have spotters on other ships, you can derive a firing
solution  without firing a shot, all you need is accurate locations on
your own ships. Voila! Accurate range info with passive sensors only.

I\'m not much into ship design, but think the idea is a good one,
especially for those using MT and those of us who like any version from
CT to T4+. I for one would like to see the CT Leviathan(all variations)
updated through to T4. I have been using Andrew A\'s design program to
try it in that format, but it still needs some tweeking to bring it into
line. At first I didn\'t think it would work when I looked at the deck
plans because there didn\'t seem to be enough fuel tankage alloted.
However, the basic ship as described seems to fit into a TL15 design.  
I can\'t see how the ship could be profitable though without major
subsidizing.

Possibly a rolling plain would depict soil better than a cliff. (Dirt as
opposed to rock)
Possibly a single droplet of water but I like the wave(s) idea as well
and the cloud types (air and gas).

Agreed, but not the walking shots method. Your meson gun fires ~100
"rounds" in a turn, you guestimate the range based on apparent
size/sig, then bracket it (still hard to do).

I don\'t follow this at all. I don\'t see where the wavelength term in
(power*sensor area*wavelength) comes from - photon statistics? Seems unlikely.
In any event, in FFS2/DSR LIDARs are only used to track-already detected
targets and hence can (as you say) narrow their scan area down (to 1/100,000,000
of an equivalent radar, not 10,000) and get greater range and/or (as the
rules imply) get away with being much, much smaller. FFS2 LIDARs run in the
UV, too, which helps still more. 

Note also that for fire control - as opposed to detection - LIDARs win big
time since they have vastly higher angular resolution; since they\'re mostly
used as fire control devices in the DSR this was pre-folded into their 
sensitivity numbers. A radar would need extremely high signal-to-noise to get
equivlanetly accurate positions. In real life, I think radar will actually
be nearly useless for laser fire control and LIDAR will be the only
practical approach (cf the YAL-1.)

I forgot to mention that - if two ships both have passive detections on a 
target and are in communication with each other they ignore the passive-FC-only
penalty.

Leviathan isn\'t intended to be profitable in and of itself on normal
cargo runs - it\'s an Exploratory Trader. It\'s job is to find and test
new raw material sources and new markets where No Man Has
Gone Before (tm). The megacorp footing the bill will then send
regular trade vessels to these worlds, and these regular traders
will make lots of profits.

Another megacorp would love the trade data this baby brings back - 
all the information needed for huge profits without the overhead and
risk of sending your own Exploratory Trader. The head of security
on a Leviathan must have his hands full when she comes back to base.

Of course, Leviathan could make a profit on it\'s own upon occaission - 
show up at a world that\'s willing to fill your holds with processed
Lanthanum in exchange for the blueprints to a working fusion reactor,
for example. Trading outside the Imperium for Fun and Profit!!  :)

Um, no -- it\'s scanning 1/10,000 the angle at 10 times the distance, which is a
million times the area I guess.
The wavelength term is due to energy per photon and background radiation
statistics, and is drawn from standard information on radars.

Incidentally, if all you use your AEMS for is targeting, there probably isn\'t
any benefit to using an AEMS over a LIDAR.  You only want radar for large-area
scans, or for penetrating atmospheric conditions which lidar won\'t penetrate.

Orbital Instalations are easy, I just make a HUGE ship w/o drives, save
for control thrusters or something to keep the thing in orbit.
They are going to need a number of things. First someplace for the ships
to dock.  Just instal a ship berth(s) in the design.  Accomidations are
simple, staterooms.  Then other stuff that a ship would need, Gravity
floor plates, life support, power, etc... Even weapons if this is a
military outpost.

Planet X was design in this way, I chose a 20Million ton sphere, put in
enough ship bays to accomidate ships and construction/repair and
staterooms for the people.  You can put in other \'room\' modules as you
see fit and as to what size they need to be.  Observation decks,
recration lounges, even a shopping mall!  Go nuts! Have fun with your
base.
The FF&S2 spreadsheet will work especialy well for this.

Count me in. One of the big reasons MT designs can make a profit is the
lower fuel consumption for JDrives.

I suggest we design a TL 12 Merchant. 200-600 tons, must show a profit with
cargo space rented out at KCr1 per ton, and the folloing limits on
passengers:
	HP:	1 per Lg SR
	MP:	2 per Lg SR or 1 per Sm SR
	LP:	1 per low berth
suggest requiring J2, 1+G. No crew shortening (IE, use the formulae, not
the shortcut of 2 men on a 200 tonner). Life support and fuel at "Book
Costs" when figuring profitability.

Suggest two winners: Most Profitable; and Cheapest profitable.

Note: I am NOT volunteering to run it... but I\'ll be happy to suggest a
good start point.... <EFG>

1)	1 roll for potential breakdown per week, rather than once per day
2)	real breakdown occurs on failure of engineer\'s check during
potential breakdown, as per TNE
3)	no roll during 2 weeks down time for annual maintenance
4)	values truncated by excell.
5)	Tables show years to reach the WV shown
6)	Rebuiding occurs upon reaching the line shown, and calculations for
	next WV are based upon the WV after rebuild.
7) rebuild occurs when Eff WV exceeds WV after next rebuild by 1, and before
	proceeding on course.
8) a rebuild costs 5% of new cost.
9) Decomissioning occurs when the ship can no longer be rebuilt to WV 10 or
	less, and is WV 11.

WV = Wear Value
EWV = Effective Wear Value (for calculations)
RbWV = Rebuilt Wear Value (used for calculation instead of EWV when a
rebuild is done)

my conclusions follow the data.

1st run:
local assumptions:
1) if WV is greater than 1, double maintenance time spent to reduce it by 1

Conclusions based on the above data
a 40 year lifespan for a ship requires a competent engineer, and at least
double the minimum maintenance. Also, any ship can, if at WV 1, extend its
lifespan indefinitely by double maintenance. Likewise for WV 2. So, figure
that "Routine Maintenance" is double the equipment\'s listed maintenance.

Since there is no viability canonically unless asset of the engineer
exceeds 16, it becomes obvious that only a weekly roll can approximate
reality, at least under TNE rules AS WRITTEN with the ASSUMPTION THAT THE
MAINTENANCE NUMBER IS THE NUMBER OF HOURS NORMALLY DEDICATED as implied in
the equipment wear value rules.

Also, lifespans of ships cannot be based upon the assumption of reducing
the WV to 0 by extra maintenance hours, since that gives a 0 probability of
breakdown and wear value increase, barring damage.

Figure a well maintained vessel, with a good engineer, should be able to
get around 150 to 200 years before WV 11 is permanently reached. Most ships
should be between WV 3 and 7 at 40 years. Extremely well maintained vessels
should be able to have WV\'s as low as 1 or 2.
=========================================================================
=========================================================================

Just for fun, I\'m going to do another run, based upon 25 jumps, assuming 7
days in jump, 2 days to the planet, and 2 days out from the planet, thus
eliminating 3 days of rolls, using the canonical 1 roll per day used. Thus
days used per year = 25 * 11, or 275 days per year.

Daily Rolls Run #1
No extra maintenance
time still in years.
as you can see, these numbers DO NOT WORK for paying off a ship.

Bruce that implies that they are passing info back to you which is active
transmission.  A possible solution for this is laser comms which would be of
such narrow beam width (and NO side lobes) that it might not be detected.

The Regency Sourcebook says that Norris titles were

The First Regent
Archduke of the Domain of Deneb, surrendered
Duke of Regina, ceremonio vita
Count Aledon, ceremonio perpetua
Marquis of Regina, ceremonio perpetua
Baron Yori, ceremonio perpetua
OEG, OC, ODM

The qualifiers (ceremonio vita, etc) indicate the nobles status in the New
Era, where the Representational Reforms have largely cut out the power of the
nobility (and maybe revoked the titles completely, depending on the individual
world).

Strephon was Emperor (duh).  The Emperor was also the Archduke of the Domain
of Sylea.  (Core, Fornast, Massilia, and Delphi).  Arrival Vengeance (at
least) tells us the Strephon was also the Marquis Usdiki.  I\'m sure the
Emperor probably has a few titles (maybe even doubles (duke, etc)).  

It\'s like Richard I was King of England, and he was the Count of Anjou too,
IIRC, and probably had a few other titles (and the fiefs that go w/ them), as
well.

Either /or. At the lower levels of nobility, it is possible that someone is a
Count, but not a Baron. For the most part, however, I assume that a holder of
a high title has several lower titles.

Canonically, yes, he can. Norris is shown in RSB as having multiple titles.
Achduke, Duke, Count, Marquis, Baron. He is also a Knight.

IMTU, secondary titles are often devolved upon children or other heirs, or
left in abeyance (without ruler), nominally still under the holder\'s
control, but really under the seneschale\'s control.

I, too, use a race older than the Anchients. They are known only as the
Precursors. TL 25-35, and long gone. They looked, but they found little...
but spread there bio-system on many worlds... a bacterium here, an amoeboid
there... thus justifying all the carbon-cycle oxygen breathing biospheres
we find as standard in traveller... 4 billion years of divergent evolution.

They left, some 2 billion years ago, to a pocket universe. They do not come
back, and no longer are even corporeal beings...
