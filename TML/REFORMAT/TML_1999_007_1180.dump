No, but if the "Domestic Engineer" are not doing these jobs themselves, they
now have to pay professional rates to get comparable results, that was the
point of the survey.

Actually, I know of no *practical* fusion technique that *needs* a
SCRAM capability. Other than gravitational confinement (ie a star :-),
you are having to use a lot of tricks to *keep* the reaction going.

Or just cut the containment field. The actual *mass* of plasma involved
is low enough that the reactor vessel won\'t do more than get warm.

Well, that one in the Upsilon system orbiting at .06 AU may have *lots*
of hydrogen. It\'ll also have weather that\'ll make a tornado look like a
dead calm. 

Also, at .06 AU, I doubt that any standard Traveller ship design could
handle the temperature.

WORMs can be forged trivially. You just copy the original to a new one,
changing data as needed. :-)

But for the particular situation you describe, there\'s ample precedent
from the age of sail. It wasn\'t unheard of for a captain on a regular
run to have a wife in each port!

So basicly, being married off-planet doesn\'t matter.

Leonard, you have just solved one of the Great Mysteries of Traveller for
me. I have never been able to figure out what the difference between
refined and unrefined fuel could be. Any idiot can set up an electrolysis
rig to process hydrogen from water or methane, and (since the density of
stored fuel is always the same) only LH2 is ever stored in the tanks. This
tidbit gives me reason to think that the catalyst process is the difference.

All IMTU, of course -- I don\'t think that canon would support it (but I\'ll
look).

Can you point me to a reference for the catalyst process, and/or any other
differences in the physical properties of the two types?

Not a good idea, I think.  Shipboard reactors have a *big* containment vessel, 
and the reaction itself is on the order of tens of *MILLIONS* of degrees.  It 
takes a lotta fuel to crank out that 250 *MEGAWATTS* of power you need just to 
move around a bit.  IN fact, IMTU, part of the yearly maintanance routine is 
relining the reactor so it can withstand another year of operation without 
burning through.  <CATN guys, you paying attention to this????>

I\'d rule that the GG was way too hot to safely scoopmine.  Or, since this *IS* a game (and some of us tend to forget that sometimes), just ignore reality in favor of massaged canon.  <grin>

You suspect correctly. :)

As a long-term GURPS player, I find the skill system to be one of the game\'s
advantages. You won\'t find a better, more comprehensive skill system in any
role-playing environment. Defaults are based on related skills or on physical
stats. Distinctions are made on the basis of difficulty level. It may seem
intimidating to a new user, but once you get the hang of it, it all comes
together. As for the sheer number of skills -- that\'s also a selling point,
IMHO -- it allows for more character development and differentiation.

Well, according to both T4 and GT, every person in the Imperium is issued a
universal ID card.  My take on this is that while it\'s not strictly
necessary to have one if you are on one planet the whole time, it is
necessary for travel.  IMTU, things like licences and certifications
(Starship Master\'s licence, etc..) get added to this card electronically.
The card is forgeable, but it\'s _hard_!  

I suppose it would make sense for things like marriage records to be on the
ID as well.

Just be careful when using it in the presence of Vargr, lest they
try to run after it and catch it in their teeth...  :)

Wednesday, April 21, 1999; Page A01
"The shooters who turned Columbine High School into an 
unspeakable landscape of carnage yesterday were members 
of a small clique of outcasts who always wore black 
trench coats and spent their entire adolescence deep 
inside the morose subculture of Gothic fantasy, their 
fellow students said.
<snipped>
Black trench coats are a consistent theme in the Gothic 
subculture that has attracted many teenagers to the 
poetry, music and costumes of a scene that ranges from 
benign fantasy to violent reality.

Inspired by fantasy games such as Dungeons and Dragons, 
Gothic has become a fascination of many American high 
schoolers, some of whom simply dress and paint their 
fingernails black while others immerse themselves in a 
pseudo-medieval world of dark images."

	Yep, people like variety.  This is one of the reasons for trade listed 
in Far Trader that hasn\'t really come up.  In some theoretical sense it is 
actually a subset of economies of scale, but I won\'t bore you with that.
	As an example of how an industrial economy might be _capable_ of being 
totally self-sufficient yet still be better off not being so, look at the US 
automobile market.  The US is clearly capable of meeting all of its domestic 
demand for autos, yet we still import them from all over the world.  We do 
this simply because people like the additional choices offered by foreign 
cars.  Variety also helps businesses because they may find that a foreign 
piece of equipment solves their particular problem better than a domestic 
one.

It\'ll not only turn into a RPG witch-hunt, but a gun witch-hunt, and an 
internet witch hunt, and a reinactors witch hunt. As I\'m a wargamer, RPGer, 
use the internet, own guns (and I lock them up!), and am a Civil War 
reinactor; it means dark times ahead, because two sets of wealthy parents 
decided they would rather spend time at the country club instead of 
supervising their children (admittedly a gross stereotype, but considering 
the reports of many students with cell phones and one of the perpetrators 
driving a BMW, not unreasonable...). What\'ll happen is that all of the 
"odd-non white bread" students will be more ostracised, and suspected of 
being psychopaths. I suspect that everybody on this list were considered part 
of the "not-in" crowd in high school, yet we turned out OK....Of course we\'ll 
be blamed instead of the parents....

Rant mode off; sorry I had to get this off my chest. I\'m a student teacher,

treat their pets better...

    The Learning Kingdom\'s Cool Fact of the Day for April 21, 1999
- ----

         What kind of shrimp can break glass with its claws?

- ----


The predatory mantis shrimp catches its prey by stunning it with a
sudden chop from its claws.  The striking force is so great that some
kinds of mantis shrimp can\'t be kept in ordinary aquariums, because
they easily break the glass with their powerful claws.

The claws of the mantis shrimp are among the fastest-moving animal
parts known.  The force of impact can be almost as large as a bullet
fired from a gun.  Divers call mantis shrimp "thumb splitters," and
there are divers who have lost fingers or thumbs to the shrimp\'s
ferocious chop.

Mantis shrimp are voracious predators.  If they are kept in a
community tank with fish, all the fish will eventually be eaten by the
shrimp.

Underwater photographers can lose their lenses if they get too close:

They were buried by that point.  The gold rush was 1849-51 (when California
became a state.  SF was a major port city by \'06.  We\'ve filled in about
40% of the Bay over the years.  As the city grew, many of these ships were

It was about a high tech society (namely us) that was exporting toys to a
low tech society (also us) through the marvels of time travel. Basically we
had ran out of petroleum and used time travel to pump it up before it was
gone thus making the Mozarts branch of the time-tree incapable of ever
having an industrial revolution - at least not one based on petroleum for
fuel.

Is it?  All your necessary legal records?  The drones we delt with wanted a
_copy_ of the original document for their files.  I went throught my
fileing cabinet last evening after I sent the post to see what documents I
had on record:  Birth certificate, high school diploma, college diploma,
selective service registration receipt, fifteen years of tax returns, copy
of my concealed carry permit, copies of my FFL and local FL, father\'s death
certificate, insurance for residence, insurance for car, life insurance,
shot records for my Welsh Terrier, AKC papers for the dog, etc.

"Yeah, so it\'s stamped.  Local regulations require a copy of the document
by the issuing authority before we can let George qualify as the ships
medic and you to take on passengers," says the clerk.

One of the requirements for entry into the Imperium, IMO, would be the
recognition of contracts made on other Imperial worlds.  While this is not
explicitly stated, it can be inferred that this is the case due to the
level of trade and other financial interests that not only span a few
worlds, but also the entire Imperium.

could indeed use h2o. Which proves this theory wrong for my part.

If the H2 would be burnt up during the week in jump ,there is no reason for a

to rely on LH2 for fuel.

They do, which implies they use it all up BEFORE jumping.

You\'ve never watched Vargr Ultimate Frisbee on the holovid?  It\'s like
soccer, in that the players can\'t touch the frisbee with their hands. 
So you have all these big-necked Vargr leaping into the hair and
snapping the frisbee with a shake of the head.  

Some Vargr even have a saying about human frisbee:  "Humans can\'t
bite."

You know that Admin/Legal  skill....

If local regulations are so strict, the they will quickly ostracise the entire
space going population (which really isn\'t very many, but they are a powerful
minority).

Recreating current tech is hard enough, even though it doesn\'t require any new 
theories to make it happen.  TL15 is dependent on gravitics and other 
technologies we haven\'t a clue how to do yet.  By the tiem we learn how to 
make the stuff, we\'ll already be a generation behind and fading fast.

The quote is without his context.

Leviticus 11:2 to 11:8 is about land animal. ("beasts that are on the
earth")
Leviticus 11:9 to 11:12 is about water animal. ("beasts that are in water")
Leviticus 11:13 to 11.23 is about flying animal. ("beasts that are in air")

So, "earth" can\'t be interpreted like meaning "Terra/Sol".

	In Far Trader we assumed that there must be some kind of rudimentary 
Imperial contract law to support interstellar trade and investment.  We made 
it the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce and the Imperial Legate to 
resolve disputes, but we left things purposefully vague so as not to 
unnecessarily constrain GMs.  The way we imagined it, for relatively 
straight-forward and common things like freight contracts, the Imperial 
machinery would be fairly efficient, but for unusual contracts and/or things 
not directly pertaining to trade the Imperial authorities would have less 
experience and incentive to intervene.
	In the end, the Imperium is "ruled by men, not laws" so everything is 
up to the discretion of Imperial authorities as long as they can justify it 
to their superiors if need be.

But this isn\'t always possible. In the example I gave (a planet that
allows polygamy and another that does not), there are contracts that can
be made on world A that could not be made (and would not be valid) on
world B. Such a case would be a polygamous marriage contract, which would
be impossible to recognize on a world where such marriages were not
permitted.

I have to say that I believe that trade is the only thing the Imperium
really regulates. If World A wants to tell you your marriage is invalid,
that\'s their perogative.

In the real world, is a marriage conducted in Iraq valid under US law?
Would it be permisable for a person married in Iraq to get married to a
woman in the US without divorcing his previous Iraqi wife? (I chose Iraq
because it seems unlikely that the US has any kind of reciprocal contract
recognition agreement with them).

Anyone know much about such issues?

Thank you, Anthony. Maybe you can answer a couple of other questions for me.

Does this mean that in a quick contest of ST (say to break a wrestling
hold), a fairly strong character can declare that he is spending a couple
of Fatigue and pretty much automatically break the grip of an NPC in
battledress? Since each point of Fatigue spent = 100% increase in ST
(unless there is a maximum amount that I am missing here) -- or is this for
lifting purposes only?

Also, the table on p.12 of CI is a little unclear to me. Is the "Extra
Effort Lift" in *addition* to the "Max Lift?"

If this is the case, then this means that a ST 15 football
tackle-equivalent can outlift a character in battledress, at least in the
short term. Is this correct?

If it is not the case, then why is the "Extra Effort Lift" for ST 15 less
than the "Max Lift" value?

As listed, its for lift only.  However, extra effort requires a ST roll, at -1
per 10% increase in ST.  This is one of the arguments used for what is called
\'Quad ST\' (argument for another forum; basically, Quad ST throws out extra
effort lifting and replaces ST with ST^2/10 for lifting formulae)

No.  Extra effort is really only particularly useful for ST above 16.

Because the extra effort lift table is \'amount you can lift with extra lift
while retaining a 16- ST roll\'.  As such, the table should really start at ST
17, since below that you can\'t reliably use extra effort anyway.

Thanks again Anthony. Some more questions:

In my copy of CI, it says "The following table shows the maximum weight a
character can lift normally (i.e., ST x 25) and the weight he can lift on a
roll of 16 or less by using Extra Effort (see p. B89), expending 1 Fatigue
for every 100% weight increase over his normal maximum."

Is this errata, or am I somehow misunderstanding the rule?

Perhaps I am being dense here, but could you explain to me this \'Quad ST\'
rule a little more in-depth? It doesn\'t seem to make sense with the above
explanation (example: battledress would have a lifting capability of
25^2/10=62.5 lbs.).

I just can\'t bear to sign onto the GURPSnet forum for this one question

You\'re reading an incomplete rule (read the original rule on page B89).  To use
Extra Effort, you must make a ST roll, at -1 per 10% increase in lifting
capability.  The table in CII indicates how much you can lift and still have
your ST roll succeed on 16-.

If using Quad ST, you recompute the ST of vehicles, so the above battledress
would have ST 16.  However, in the case of an actual ST 25, what this means is
that lifting ability would be computed in increments of 62.5 lb rather than 25
lb (thus, \'no\' encumbrance would be up to 125 lb, not up to 50 lb).

I would think that Imperial law would only require member states to
recognize and enforce private contracts relating to interstellar
commerce (and that Imperial law would define that concept narrowly).  Of
course, member states could agree to a broader level of comity, which
would improve their trade position.  I don\'t see the later (say
post-bellum) Imperium requiring it, because it doesn\'t want to be
interfere with local governance any more than it has to, and because it
wants its member states to be loyal members, not forced into the
Imperium by direct oppression.  

So if a world chooses to deny enforcement of off-world contracts, it
will become a trade backwater.  The Imperium accepts that, because it
needs the world primarily for security reasons.  The Imperium is more
secure with the world as a backwater than either an independent world or
a world chafing under perceived Imperial oppression.  Most worlds, or at
least enough, will want the benefits of interstellar trade and
development.  If a few don\'t, the Imperium is big enough to let them be
underdeveloped -- and to wait for them to change their minds.

It\'s avalible on my Traveller page.. just be careful that you are actually
saving it as a .ttf  some recent versions of Navigator insist on trying to
save it as a .htm file.  Right-click on the link and select "Save Link As"
to get around the problem.

Tough question.  I think one good measure might the length of time
and area in which a given navy has continuously operated in combat.
I think the Third Imperium is going to be the highest as a result of
the long history of naval operations against internal and external
threats.  (Among the Vilani and Solomani, I\'d give a slight edge to
the Solomani for creativity versus the Vilani\'s strong attachments to
tradition and procedure - I\'m assuming that creativity counts a great
deal for Fleet Tactics - - perhaps I\'m confusing Fleet Tactics and
Strategy here - I could easily see the Vilani excelling at precision
manuevering tactics, \'showy\' drill stuff, but in a dynamic combat
environment, thats not so helpful).

The Zhodani don\'t have much internal difficulty, so their need
to maintain tactical excellence is somewhat less pressing that
in the 3I.  Also, IMO, their dependence on their psionic
skills would make them generally less adept at fleet-vs.-fleet
battles.  Of humaniti fleets, I\'d rank them lowest.

There is a very good case for Sword Worlds excelling
at tactics, given the history of internecine conflicts in their
realm.  Also their encounters with Darrian, Arden, Zhodani,
Border Worlders, the 3I, and possibly Aslan, exposes them
to a myriad of different tactics that, with their relatively small
population base (compared to the 3I), they would be able to
disseminate widely among their command staff.  However, their
aggressiveness may be a hindrance against more subtle enemies
and those internal conflicts may also often leave them short of
highly trained staff, with each new Admiral having to start from
zero and learn tactics from scratch.

Aslan are tough for me to place.  Probably on par with the 3I
as a whole.  Hivers would be similar to Zhodani, IMO.  They
may be the worst at Fleet Tactics.  Vargr would be all over the
map, I think.  Darrians might well be overdependent on their
technology.  K\'Kree I have no idea, probably better than
Zhodani, but not as good as the Vilani.


So, I\'d rank them:

Swordworlders
Solomani
Aslan (Third Imperium)
Vilani
Darrian
Zhodani
Hiver

Coming up with an average skill level, I would begin by estimating
what is the lowest Fleet Tactics skill that an Admiral in a given
society would be able to earn the position (anyone can be assigned
the rank, earning it is a different matter).

Assuming that an Admiral is rank 08 (as in T4), thats
7 terms (with a commision and promotion in the first term).
28 years of naval career.

For the worse navies, the absolute worst Admiral would have
Fleet Tactics-1, IMO.  What would be the best? For the
absolute worst navy, I\'d say Fleet Tactics-3.  So I\'d make the
average 2.

A long way to say that I\'d set the averages at:
Swordworlders-4
Solomani-4
Aslan; Third Imperium-3
Vilani-3
Darrian-2
K\'Kree-2
Zhodani-2
Hiver-2 (maybe 1?)

No, unfortunately, this is not correct.  There is no state in the entire
United States that recognizes same-gender marriage.  A few localities
provide recognition of same-gender partnerships, but this is nothing like
marriage.
 
In the case of Hawai\'i, the state law regarding marriage as between people
of two different genders is being challenged in the courts.  It is
currently bing argued in front of the Hawai\'ian Supreme Court.  California
has _no_ recognition at the state level of any kind for same-gender
relationships (a legacy of Republican governors).
 
ObTrav: there is a lot of ground to cover around relationships in the
future, and how they will be recognized.  I would recomend Donald
Kingsbury\'s _Courtship_Rite_, and Samuel R. Delany\'s _Babel-17_ as two
interesting sources of inspiration and reflection.  And, of course, there
is Heinlein.  :)

However, you also have the possibility that because the 3I navy has been in
existence for such a long time, and the 3I usually is able to bring massive
support to the front line, that the naval tactic of the 3I has stagnated at
a fairly moderate level.

Except that the Zhos know how and why people make decisions under stress and
threat better than any other race.  Also, with the proliferation of psychers
in the upper ranks, it would be easier to tell your subordinates what you
wanted to do without as large a chance of miscommunication.  That may make
them better able to carry out fleet maneuvers.  However, their lacking of
practical warfare experience might hinder this.

Hiver are difficult.  Most fleet exercises are more theoretical than
hands-on.  Since Hiver have very little trouble with long-distance violence
(they have problems with up close and personal dirty work)  I don\'t think
that I would make it so low.

Therefore, I might rank them as such: (rank followed by range of most (say
66%) admirals)
Swordworlders - 5 
	With their smaller navies, they might be able to be more selective
wrt who gets into positions of fleet control.  Also, it might be more
difficult for anyone less skilled to rise to such a position.

Solomoni - 4
	The Solomoni are just incredible sneaky, and the diversity of
Humanitii comes through.

3I, Vilani - 3
	There are a lot of fair-to-middln\' fleet admirals in the 3I (lots of
people are Admirals due to other than military skill).  After restoration of
the Ziru Sirkaa, the Vilani kept most of their 3I Naval textbooks.

Aslan -4
	They are, after all, warriors.

Hiver - 4
	I kind of like having Hiver that are \'death on thruster plates\'.  Of
course, that they are this good would not be widely known at all outside of
the Hiver world.  These little guys give me the creeps :-).

Vargr - ?
	Each fleet should be determined randomly?

Zhodani - 3
	Easily on par with the 3I, but their lack of many outside enemies
(except the 3I)  limits their skill to the more theoretical.

Darrian - 2
	Again, most of their knowledge is theoretical.

K\'Kree - 2
	Since the K\'Kree ships are large ponderous beasts, fleet tactics
mostly consist of keeping out of the way of other fleets.  If a K\'kree fleet
does not have overwhelming superiority, they\'ll just go away and fight
another day.

So, a random table of Fleet Tactic skills might look like this:
- ----
Roll	Fleet Tactics Skill by Race/Government
(2d)	SW		Solo	3I		Vilani	Aslan	Zho
Darran	K\'Kree			
2	2		1		1		1		2
1		1		1
3	3		2		1		2		2
2		1		1

2		1		1

11	6		5		5		4		5
4		3		3
12	6		6		6		5		6

Vargr: roll 1d-1 for Fleet tactics skill.  Die roll is skill level.  Skill
level 0 represents no skill

Thanks Bloo, that provides a starting point at least. I\'m writing the Pursuit
and Interception rules for Fleet Ops to assume equal skills for admirals,
I\'ll use info like the above to provide "advanced rules" for racial modifiers
and PC skills.

IIRC, High Guard assumes skill level 2- for such things as Pilots and 
Gunners. Pilots get to add (Pilot Skill-1)/2 to their ship\'s agility, so you
need pilot skill 3+ to get an agility bonus. Some similar formula could be
used to normalize PC skill levels with "average" skill levels.

I\'d like to have "Grizzled Veteran Naval Depot Commander Hands Hotshot
Young Admiral His Head" as a viable Defender vs Intruder scenario for this, 
so a mechanism for major characters\' skill level is required. <G>

A nice thing about the ideas I\'m receiving - since it\'s just a number to be

as less than interested in actual combat (Fleet Tactics 2-).

I\'ve put the work so far on Fleet Ops on a web page, 
http://hartwick.edu/~smithw/fleet_ops.htm .

I\'ve completed (most of) the Definitions, the bits on intial deployment,

Good point.  I think though that the average will be in the area I\'ve
suggested but that the high and the low will be over a wider range,
which might be justified by the sheer size of the 3I..  So there will be
some FT-0\'s and some FT-8s.  I think smaller navies might not
have such a wide range of FT skill.

I would amend this to say that the Zhos know how and why other _Zhos_
behave.  YTUMV.

There is an issue about FT as a skill for accomplishing efficient
manuevers versus conducting combat.

Nope - rods. Although dumping water into the reactor is possible, in
case of a thermal runaway. If you ever need this, you are likely to be
presented with an immediate sequence of pressing problems.

The Goddess is new age?  Wiccan/paganism/druidism/et al has been around
since man started worshipping deities, the Goddess or Earth Mother was one
of the oldest deities, worshipped from Ireland, England, through to France,
Spain, and Germany, with reachings into Italy too (though these places were
not actually known by those names at the time, you had Briton and Gaul, and
the like).

Myself, I would find suspect any Celtic courses put forward by an institute
that didn\'t mention the religion, as it was a huge part of these barbarian
cultures.  I am not wiccan myself (paganism, druidism, etc. virtually all
mean the same if you search the web or go to your local library), but I know
many who are.  There is quite a bit about it on the net, often
misunderstood.  For example, the US military allows it (there is a web site
somewhere) as a recognised religion, yet filters such as NetNanny won\'t
allow you to access the site because of the words wiccan and paganism which
they assume to mean "Satanism"!  Misunderstood...

ObTrav: Anyone evr use Wicans/Witches in their Traveller games? It\'d be a
way cool planetary society to cook up for the players to visit a wiccan
dominated society, perhaps decended from wiccan colonists fleeing from the
society that so misunderstands their beliefs.

I\'d always assumed all of a traveller\'s legal standing\'s and documentation
would be part of their travel documents in an electronic media, like a
magnetic-like strip (adjust for YTU) on the back pages of their "passport."
Indeed, the whole thing (the travel docs) could be a smart card?  Every time
the traveller applies for passage off-world, part of the process is
up-grading the info in their personal documents.

It\'s a simple fix and others may like it to go deeper or become more
complicated, but it worked in my old games (where I used the smart card
passport).

I would imagine that you would still have to have records of such things for

Cross cultures tend to cross laws in a way (for want of a better term).  If
you are married on world A and never want to return there, fine, but if you
return and all your data is on your travel docs, it means you are in breach
of local laws as you are possibly still a citizen of world A and now have
2-wives!  And I\'m sure world A would look after your former wife with the
full strength of the law if she didn\'t like the idea of you having another
missus.  I\'m assuming that PC\'s and NPC\'s alike have to play by whatever
laws are local?

A whole nother ball game.  I would think it depended upon individual TU\'s.
One would possibly be a citizen of their birthworld by default I would
assume, while some worlds would demand you to become a citizen if you wanted
to marry a local, get a job, have voting rights, claim unemployment, and the
list goes on... either one of these criteria, all of them, or a combination.

Why would there be?

Leaving aside the religious aspects, marriage is a civil contract, and
would be dealt with as any other civil arrangement.

I would figure that everyone would also have a planetary citizenship (or at
least official residence). Think of it as being an American citizen: you
still have a state of residence. Some states have benefits (like easy
residence requirements and low taxes -- IIRC Texas is one like that) that
some can take advantage of.


Both the above are my opinion, of course. I would argue the marriage case a
lot more strongly, but then I\'m not convinced that murder in and of itself
is an Imperial crime (after all, the Imperium allows wars, tradewars, and
so forth).

Oddly enough, I\'ve been discussing this in class today. Many of my students
pointed out that far worse things happen in other countries, yet don\'t make
the news because it\'s not an American event. (An interesting discussion
about why Canadian news relies so heavily on American newswires resulted,
too.)

I pointed out that the individuals involved, according to the WP story as
printed in the Toronto Star, were actually former students who had returned
to the school. This may not be correct, but it was in the printed story.
Internal inconsistency there.

I would be _very_ curious as to the family background of the murderers. If
they were, as Seth deduced, given more money than parental attention that
wouldn\'t surprise me -- I see far too much of that. OTOH, the vast majority
of my parents are trying hard to do the best for their kids. Sadly, many
have been seduced by consumer culture into thinking that "best" means "most
toys and trips" instead of "attention".

Interesting to note that D&D and Gothic subculture were targetted in the
same sentence. No mention of Vampire: The Masquerade (which even had a TV
series). No mention of Anne Rice novels, films like "Devil\'s Advocate",...
I\'m planning on writing to the Star and protesting the shoddy research that
went into the story. Hell, opening up a D&D book would have shown that
inept reporter that there wasn\'t a direct link.

Like Seth, sorry for the rant. I\'ve been discussing it all day, same points
over and over. Tomorrow I take in my D&D books to show the students that
there isn\'t any "Gothic" stuff there. I still expect hassle from the admin
about the gaming club my kids want to start, though.

Something else to consider is the politically-oriented nature of high
command within the Imperium- Nobles will tend to dominate, and have a
substantial advantage in becoming officers in the Navy.  While some
societies (Great Britain, for example) have survived this sort of favoritism
in the past, this is clearly not uniformly beneficial.  Norris taking over
in FFW is an example of this habit being useful, Lucan micro-managing fleets
the opposite.  All things considered, it seems that Imperial officers are
given a little more lattitude than their competition, which would possibly
lead to greater effectiveness.

The Zhos have one HUGE advantage over the others- uniformity of purpose.
While not always a 100% good thing, I beleive that a Zho unit will, all
other things being equal, be much more likely to be effeectively cooperating
than any other race.  Also, given the fact that all the officers are
psionic, it seems fairly sure that there will be few, if any,
misunderstandings during a briefing.  The commander will KNOW that everyone
understands the plan and their place in it, and what their reservations are.
Any of you who have ever given an operations order will understand how
incredibly useful this would be.  OTOH, it does seem that according to
canon, they have less experience than the others.

As for the others:


Swordworlders:  I am somewhat surprised to see a coalition rated so highly.
If you pay attnetion, you will notice that the SWs will typically be placed
under the command of the leader of the largest contingent, not the best
leader.  This alone, IMHO, would serve to bring down their skill at least 1.
Also, considering their decidedly lackadaisical performance in FFW,  it
doesn\'t seem warranted.  On that thought, lets look at the leader counters
in FFW- AFAIK, the only canon source.  Now, I don\'t know how the tactical
modifier equates to fleet tactics, and the plotting number certainly doesn\'t
seem directly related, but lets look at the stats:

Imperial Navy (14 admirals)     Average Tactical Skill= .79    Average
plotting=2.57 -default is 5
    note that only two Imperial admirals associate high tactical skill with
a 0 or 1 plot- Mtume, #4, and Goolanzoon, #5.  Also only eight of them have
positive tactical mods- four of these are only +1.
Vargr (3 admirals, of which one will serve as Imperial #15, chosen at
random) ATS= 1.67    AP=3 -default is 5
    ALL of them have positive tactical skill, though Gvungughz, #3 is
clearly the top dog, a +3 to the others\' +1.
Swordworlders (Three admirals, one of which will serve as Zhodani #15)
ATS=1.67    AP=3.33 -default is 5
    Again, good tactical skills, but none are outstanding (2 +2s, no +3s).
Also, they are the worst strategically.
Zhodani (14 admirals)    ATS=.79 (hey, I think I see a trend)
   AP=1.9 -default is 4
    note only one negative and seven 0 tactical skills.  Also, again, only
two truly outstanding leaders, Benshatl #9 and Chienjstebr #10

So where does this lead us?  Overall, the Impies have a wider range of
tactical skills and decent plotting.  Subjectively, here\'s how I would rate
them:
        2 outstanding
        3 good
        2 fair
        4 useful
        3 useless
Overall, they posess no clear advantage.

The Sws aren\'t really that good, they have one decent admiral (Tryggvesson,
#3).  Tactically, they are higher than the Imperium, but there are two Imp
admirals better than any Sw.

The Vargr have two decent admirals and one useful one.  A trait shared with
the Sw is the low plot bonus and high tactical bonus, though they are in hot
water if the Imps pick Gvungughz as their mercenary.

The Zhodani are much more uniform, as I would rate them as
        2 outstanding
        4 good
        5 fair
        3 useful
The WORST Zho skipper (either 2 -1 or 3 0) is better to or equal to the
bottom 7 imperial admirals.  Overall, it looks like the Zhos are more
consistent.  They are less likely to have a tactical bonus OR penalty.  You
might not get an ace, but you won\'t get a fool either.

Admittedly, this is small sample, particularly the SW and Vargr, but it
seems to show that the smaller navies have a strategic disadvantage paired
with a tactical edge.

So, by these measures the Zhodani have the best operational planning and
initiative, followed by the Imperials, Vargr, and Sword Worlds; the Sworld
Worlds and Vargr have superior tactical ability (tied for first), while the
Zhodani and Imperials are tied for third. 

Unfortunately, neither FFW nor Imperial Squadrons give a conversion from
player-character skills to ratings, so you\'ll have to make your own
determination.

Yup, like I said, extreme emergency.... I got this info from one of the

I think I\'d place more weight on the Tactical bonus than I would on the
Plot bonus. I see Fleet Tactics as a combat skill, how to fight a fleet
(as Ship Tactics is how to effectively fight a ship) rather than how to
fight a Navy. I believe the grand strategy decisions - which star system to 
send the fleets to - would be more abstract. This grand strategy capability 
may make up a portion of the Admiral\'s Fleet Tactics skill, but I think what 
he can do inside a system would be the lion\'s share of the skill.

Bear in mind that each state of the United States has its own laws
regarding what makes a valid marriage, and its own laws regarding
conflicts of law.  I\'m going to discuss general principles of American
jurisprudence, without looking up any state\'s (or Iraq\'s) law.  

Normally, if any foreign (here meaning outside the United States, as
opposed to outside a particular state) government recognizes a marriage
made in its country as valid, any state of the United States will also
recognize that marriage, whether there is a treaty in place or not.  If
that is the case, then the second marriage, in the U.S. state, would be
bigamous in that state.

(An exception to my first sentence in the previous paragraph is that
U.S. states won\'t recognize marriages that conflict with important
public policies, like prohibitions on polygamy or marriage between close
relatives.)

The United States is not a good model for the Imperium, but I hope this
analysis is nevertheless helpful.

In Stand on Zanzibar, John Brunner writes of a phenomenon known as
"mucking", in which a mucker goes amok and starts killing everyone
around.  It happens all the time.  It\'s caused by becoming too stressed
out by the overcrowding and other tensions of life in his vision of the
late 20th century.  In the Littleton and other recent cases, the
shooters have been middle-class suburban kids, but life in suburbs,
cars, and shopping malls could contribute to someone\'s going round the
bend.

accurately mirror Traveller\'s "Early Stellar" tech levels (ie. TL9-11).

Assuming my calculations aren\'t totally out-of-whack, when I compared GTL9
to GTL 10, I discovered that at GTL9:

i) fusion power is 5 times heavier and 20 times more expensive
ii) thrusters are 4 time heavier and 40 times more expensive
iii) engineering crews are almost 10 times larger

There are other differences, but these are the most significant.

Now, this might apply for TL9, but there simply isn\'t that
order-of-magnitude difference between TL11 and TL12 (GTL10 = TL12, GTL9 =
TL9-11 according to the GT rulebook).

I think the best solution would be to split the GTL9 systems into three
catagories (early, middle, late) that gradually change, so that late GTL9
worlds (such as most of the Sword Worlds, which are TL11) aren\'t crippled
in space.

Any thoughts?

I love it and more importantly my player group is in love with it. I\'ve 
played Classic Traveller, MegaTraveller, and Traveller T4, all were good but 
none have got the player remarks about satisfaction that the GURPS Traveller 
has gotten from my group. Its simple to use rules harken back to Classic 
Traveller\'s earliest days, without sacrificing the rich detail that the later 
versions have. What can I say? We are also happy with the source books that

Good buy, what else can be said?

Actually, I\'d rate the "average" admiral as having a plotting factor of 5
(4 for Zhodani), with tactics 0. Ie. the default fleet includes an average
admiral. The counters represent the exceptional ones.

I\'d rate Fleet Tactics as wholly the tactical bonus. Strategy would be some
other skill (what, I don\'t know).


Looking at the above, I see that I haven\'t answered the question, just
stated that IMO Fifth Frontier War\'s basic system is normalized around the
average admiral, so that exceptional ones get bonuses (or penalties).

Now, I do dimly recall seeing a character writeup of Norris somewhere. If
it was a canon source you could compare his Fleet Tactics skill to his
counter in FFW and get an idea that way...

Alternately, you could look at how much benefit a +1 tactics gives in FFW,
and cost the Fleet Tactics skill accordingly.

We\'re talking about different kinds of law here. Some contracts are between
the individual and the government, like a concealed weapons permit. In that
case, the permit is valid only within the jurisdiction of that government.
Now, some other governments with concealed weapons permits MIGHT grant an
equivalent to someone as a courtesy, e.g. to law enforcement officials.

On the other hand, marriage is a contract between two people, the government
being simply the registrar in this case. So a marriage in jurisdiction A would
more often than not be recognized in jurisdiction B. If two people from Sweden
get married, then later emigrate to Canada, they\'re still married. Of only
one of the couple moves to Canada, and later marries a Canadian while having
not divorced the Swedish spouse, a case can be made for bigamy.

Back to the intent of the original question, regarding registration of vital
statistics such as marriage. I\'ve seen multiple references to a personal ID
card which is recognized throughout the Imperium. Not all Imperial citizens
have one -- Farmer Fred on a low-tech agricultural world who has never been
more than 50 miles from his farm would likely not have one. But anyone who
travels into space would have one, and it might even be a requirement to 
have one in order to clear Imperial customs. Such an ID card would be like
a contemporary Earth passport, except it would record a LOT more information
about the cardholder (marital status, occupation, retinal scans, DNA tags,
shoe size, etc.). So if a person is married and has a Universal ID Card, then
the marriage would be recorded on the card.

Now, in the case of Planet Polygamy allowing someone to have multiple spouses,
then the law of one\'s registered planet of residence would take precedence.
A man on Polygamy could have three wives, but if he moved to Planet Zorg
(which
does not recognize multiple-party marriages), they would likely recognize only
one of the marriages...  (Some Muslim states allow men to have up to four
wives
here and now today on Earth... if a guy with three wives moves to the US, what
does he do about the extra wives? Same situation as above...)

    'body' => 'Dear Folks -

Here is the text of an essay on extrality I wrote back in the late 80\'s.
Would anyone (especially our resident lawyers and economic experts) like to
comment?

Extraterritoriality

Starports within the Imperium are considered extraterritorial; that is,
they are considered part of Imperial territory and not part of their
homeworld. This allows standardisation of procedures, and allows the SPA to
function Imperium-wide. This different status of starports means that new
laws must be made regarding their control and operations.

Starport Acquisition

Most starports are originally built by their homeworld to facilitate
interstellar operations. There may even be multiple starports and
spaceports on a world. When applying for Imperial membership, one of the
standard allegiance clauses is to provide the Imperium with a starport.
When the world signs the allegiance document, it gives the selected
starport (and such adjacent lands as agreed upon) to the Imperium as an
indefinite lease, coupled with a declaration of extrality. The Imperium now
controls the starport\'s operations, personnel, regulations, finances, and
so forth, and the world no longer has jurisdiction over the area.

There is a chance for an Imperial world to retain ownership of one or more
ports. These will usually be of lower grade than the Imperial starport, and
the world may  be an Amber Travel Zone. One possibility is where a
Balkanised world has one or more countries as Imperial member-states, but
has others that are not.

High population worlds may even have more than one starport under Imperial
control. Terra, with three starports, is a prime example of this
arrangement.

Finally, private ports may be present, but only billionaires are generally
able to afford such things.

The Imperium may commandeer any and all ports in emergencies, whether
starport or spaceport, public or private.

Laws Within Starports

Imperial Law applies with Imperial starports. The Law Level is normally set
at 1, thus banning the less detectable, more destructive, and insidious
forms of weaponry. Naturally, such devices may still be stored aboard ship,
internal ship security being the prerogative of the ship\'s captain - at
least as far as the law goes. All starship-grade weaponry is allowed, up to
but not including nuclear missiles, which the Imperium alone retains the
right to possess.

Imperial Law is fairly general, as it must be to cover so many different
cultures. However, some basics are retained to prevent the breakdown of law
and order in society. Murder is a crime, as are most forms of violence upon
the person. Dangerous activities are also curtailed, such as dangerous
driving or flying, discharging weapons in public, and so on. The referee
should use common-sense in framing regulations that exists within
starports, often with the local culture and environment having major
effects.

Legal aid may be found at Type C starports and above, at least for local
matters. Interplanetary lawyers (Legal-4) will be rarer, but there will be
at least one at all Type A and B starports. Lower quality starports may
need to send away for legal aid, which may take quite a few weeks! Until
then, people will either be held in custody (criminal cases) or have exit
visas withheld (civil cases). The Port Director has final authority over
this. The referee should determine the actions taken by the authorities.

Financial Matters

Businesses located within the extrality line of the starport do not pay
planetary tax, even if this is their homeworld. Instead, they pay tax to
the Imperium, which sets the tax rate 5% higher than the homeworld to
prevent the starport from being a tax haven. In any case, the buildings and
land are operated as though owned by the Imperium. Firms must lease their
land and buildings from the starport, and pay for items such as water and
sewerage rates, power supply charges, and so on. Under a special agreement,
TAS hostels are exempt from paying a lease, but must still pay the other
costs.

Starport revenue comes from such things as land and building leases,
landing fees, fuel costs, consumables replacement fees, ship maintenance
charges, possible exit taxes, and so on. The revenue thus obtained is used
to pay SPA employees, maintain the existing starport, and upgrade the port
facilities. The Imperium pays 70% of the starport\'s excess revenue (if any)
to the homeworld to cover the lease. The remaining 30% profit is paid into
the Imperial Starport Fund, administered by the SPA with ties to the
Contact and Liaison Branch of the IISS. The SPA Executive and individual
starports may petition the fund for project monies. Additionally, the ISF
is used to build new starports, repair damaged ports, acquire new land, and
so on. The ISF is run on a sector-wide scale, with monies from the sector
channelled back into the sector.

My charecter with the Frisbee never could get the Vargr in the party
interested in playing.  Since he was an Imperial Marine officer with 
STR C [in TNE] and Infighting 5 or 6 [2 or 3 in other rules]  she did
not want to push the issue

Lines from that game to the player

Other players "Sid wake up, We are being attacked by the Zhodani.  There
is a teleport commando in the ductwork with you"

"I will Psionically Assault him."

GM: "Sorry you are out of Psi points."

"Then, I will shoot them."

GM: "Sorry you are out of bullets."

"I will claw him."

GM "Sid you are in the ductwork, you do not have enough room to claw
him."

"OK I will bite him."

GM "OK, he is fireing back with his PGMP."

Five rounds later the Zhodani is dead & Rukh (the Vargr) is still alive
and not even critically wounded after taking 3 or 4 PGMP shots from less
than 1 meter.

Rant: Charecters is TNE have way too many hit points, especially when
they are STR D and END A.  Even though the Ref was using d10\'s for
dammage instead of d6\'s Rukh was OK.  He needed 6 months to regrow the
burned off fur, but he was OK.

I\'ve always ran with 1 week\'s worth of clothes for my character, plus a vacc 
suit, weapons, and other misc gear they might need, depending on what they 
did.  The clothes, boots, etc were carried in a duffel as to be more easily 
stuffed in tight quarters like a starship barracks room.

Check out _Conflict of Honors_ by Steve Miller & Sharon Lee for a main
character serving on a merchant ship who is from a Wiccan-derived planet. 
The books has a *very* Traveller feel. 

It\'s also the 2nd in a series:

Agent of Change ISBN 0-345-34828-1
Conflict of Honors ISBN 0-345-35353-6
Carpe Diem ISBN 0-345-36310-8

All are much fun.

Also, there\'s a character from a Wiccan-like space colony in John Varley\'s
book _Wizard_ (sequel to _Titan_).  Not Varley\'s best by far, but
non-horrible.

The plasma inside a neon light tube may be at a million degrees. It\'s
just *thin* as all get out. The total *heat* content is virtually nil.

To generate 250 MW requires fusing a mere 2.7 *micrograms* of hydrogen
per second. At *one hundred* million degrees, that wouldn\'t have enough
heat energy to melt an ice cube. Not even if only 1 in a million atoms
fuses (ie there would be 2.7 grams of hydrogen in there).

That\'s what folks don\'t realize. Just *how* little fuel it takes to
generate a lot of power.

Check the description of a "cold water accident" in either "Red Storm
Rising" or "Hunt for Red October". Too much cold water in the reactor
at the wrong time can *cause* a runaway reaction.

Actually, as long as the fusion reactor uses a "hot fusion" type
reaction, you can "crack" water, methane or ammonia fairly easily. But
water and ammonia (NH3) would be preferred.

You see, at well *below* fusion temps, *all* of those compounds break
down into individual ions in a plasma. With a bit of extra electric and
magnetic field work, you can seperate out the hydrogen easily. 

Water and ammonia are preferred because you can just dump the oxygen or
nitrogen. With methane, you tend to get carbon deposits built up. BTW,
if the right type of "seed" crystal is available, it\'ll deposit as
diamond! 

And don\'t forget that nitrogen is *only* cheap on worlds with decent
atmospheres. Everywhere else, it\'s one of the more expensive life
support chemicals.

Actually, this situation exists in the US. We recognize polygamous
marraiges of *visitors*. If you are a Moslem with 4 wives (the maximum
allowed by the Koran), you can visit the US, and they *are* your wives.
But if you apply for citizenship you have to divorce all but one of
them. I\'m not sure what happens if you apply for "resident alien"
status. There\'s also the interesting question of what happens if a
vistor gets into some legal tangle that involves marital status.

So I wouldn\'t be so quick to say that a polygamous marriage can\'t be
recognized by a non-polygamous society.

True enough. Though I\'d expect that in the normal course of things,
it\'d take moderately weird circumstances for a world to try to enforce
something like that on non-residents.

As I said, I\'m certain that *pre-existing* marriages are recognized.
There have been far too many cases of various rich/important Arabs
visiting the US and other countries. 

Adding a new wife while here would be a different matter, as then *our*
laws get involved. But if the new wife went back to wherever and got
married *there*, then we\'d probably accept the situation. At least as
long as they were merely vistors. 

The bit about having to divorce all but one wife to become a citizen is
something I recall from some articles I read a long time back.

And Congresss had to pass a law specifically stating that such
marriages need not be recognized. If they hadn\'t, then the other states
would have had *no* choice in the matter.

There\'s also some arguments to the effect that Congress doesn\'t haver
the authority to pass such a law. That it\'d take a Constitutional
amendment. At some point, someone will get married in Hawaii and move
to another state and then file suit when their marriage isn\'t
recognized. And even then, we won\'t *really* know until and unless we
can get two *different* federal circuit courts to hand down conflicting
decisions (that\'s the *only* way to *force* the Supreme Court to make a
decision on something).

BTW, for what it\'s worth, there are a *lot* of laws in that position.
They are of questionable Constitutionality, but the Supreme Court wants
no part of the mess that would ensue from ruling *either* way. So we
struggle along, with advocates trying to find good test cases...

It\'s also been hypothesized that the hydrogen has been "filtered"
isotopically. For example, for some types of reaction you\'d want to
remove all the tritium, as it\'d cause *way* too many stray neutrons.
For others, you\'d want mostly deuterium and tritium, no "protium" (H1).

Well, I read it in an arcticle back in the 60s. "The Bugs That Live at
- -253 C" in an old Analog. It was about the troubles NASA had in
learning to store and use LH2 in large quantities. 

I don\'t recall the actual catalyst, except that it may have been
something as silly as jewler\'s rouge! I *think* they passed the LH2
thru a porous block of "whatever". 

And the *only* difference between an ortho-hydrogen molecule and a
parahydrogen molecule is the alignment of the spin of the individual
atoms. For various quantum mechanical reasons this results in the two
kinds having different energy states.

Frankly, I figure that the *fact* that they were ostracized played a
big part in their going psycho. I heard one TV commentator making some
comment about "Without guns we\'d just get a fist fight". He obviously
has never been one of the "outsiders". Because the "underclass" type
kids *don\'t* get into fights. For two reasons. First, they always
*lose*. Especially against "jocks". Second, *they* will be the ones who
get into trouble, not the "normal" kids. 

I *hate* that damned attitude that says that "fights" are ok, or that
they should be acceptable. The stresses that *used* to lead to fights
are *not* a symptom. They are part of the *problem*!

<sigh>

Never mind. I just keep thinking that if I\'d not decided *against*
suicide in High school, I might have been tempted to try taking a jerk
or two with me...

Funny, when I heard about it in the news, my first thought was sadness
for the two shooters. Anger and frustration born of powerlessness. In RL
I work with sexual offenders, most of whom were \'outsiders\' in their
youth. One thing I\'ve learnt is that most "monsters/psychos" are made
not born. But then again its so much easier to believe in monsters than
it is to face up to the reality that we create such people.

ObTrav: Its this impotence and frustration that are the prime motivation
of most terrorists and classic "bad guys".

manoeuvre 6) and would certainly benefit from carrying more fuel.

If you use the fuel up all in one go, then you have the whole week
in jump to refine the reserve tank into hydrogen

==

As an aside, the players in my current campaign are using a modular
ship (see deckplans).

They separated one of the modules before misjumping.
(The one with  their bosses and all the nobles and media crews on <sniff>)

I had set up a situation where they needed 2 jump-2 with only j-3 fuel
tankage. Their solution was to get a TL-9 world to make a fuel tank
to replace the missing module. It\'s not a proper fuel tank, just a
large bolt on cylinder of water. It can\'t be used directly but after
the first J-2, they will pump the water into a proper fuel tank and
refine it, before jumping again.

Hunt for Red October. An Alfa suffers a catastrophic loss of coolant
event under full power. The reactor goes dry in an instant, stopping 
the reaction (the water moderates the neutrons allowing them to do
their work). However, residual heat is sufficient to slag down the
core. The operator admits cold seawater, which moderates the heat.
However, it also moderates the neutrons so well that the nuclear
reaction begins again. Hobson\'s choice... Oh, they are unable to
sCRAM the reactor, as well. The remainder of the scenario is short
and exciting.

Overall it an excellant product. The line started off with a few _minor_
problems with production quality, but these seem to have been ironed
out (and they pale into insignificance when compared with IG\'s output)
and the 2nd printing should deal with them. I don\'t like the GURPS
system (just a matter of personal taste, I\'m a T4/T5 kind of guy), but
they are excellant source material for all flavours of Traveller. I\'d give
GT a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.

While discussing Skyron on Monday and Tuesday, I recited information 
from Andrew M-V\'s Prometheus Rising sector data for the Solomani Rim 
circa 2096.  Someone, I forget who, asked as to the canonicity of 
that data.  I was out from work yesterday, and now am able to answer 
that question.

According to Andrew\'s Galactic file on the Interstellar War period, 
from which this data is taken, the First Contact Data is taken from 
the Solomani Rim sector data, and the UWPs were regressed back to 
Milieu 0 by Harold Hale for his work on Unbroken Pride: the Solomani 
Rim at Milieu 0.  Then Andrew regressed the data one more time, back 
to the time period of the Interstellar Wars.  The physical and 
stellar data are, indeed, canon.  The social data has been regressed 
back, and works as well for me as anything else.

So far, out of the Interstellar Wars data released with Galactic 2.4, 
I\'ve only noticed one inconsistency with canon, and the presence of 
several minor race homeworlds besides the Vegans.  The only canon 
minor races listed in canon sources that are native to the Solomani 
Rim are the Vegans and the Chips.  The inclusion of the homeworlds 
does not violate canon, nor does it have support from canon.  They 
just haven\'t been discussed.

Oh, and the one inconsistency with canon is that, in the 2096AD data 
set, I believe Galactic displays that Prometheus is also part of the 
Terran Confederation (which actually doesn\'t start until 2120, per 
most sources, but he\'s using the allegiance code for consistency\'s 
sake for the rest of the IntWars data.)  Canon is rather specific
that Barnard\'s Star was the first site of Terran expansion beyond her 
own solar system.  Probably an oversite during the clean up of his 
personal campaign data, before exporting the galaxy he had created 
for inclusion in Galactic 2.4.

All in all, very well done, and good enough for me to use it as the 
basis for my own First Contact campaign.  (And it\'s finally underway! 
 First session last night went great, overall.  :)

Actually I\'ve read some theories that fighting among grade school kids is
an important part of the socialization process, and should be allowed.  It
allows the social order to be shaken up as kids grow, and gives the kids at
the bottom of the pecking order an outlet for their frustrations.  By high
school, most people have ceased needing this outlet, and can socialize on a
more mature level.

I, too, have noticed some problems.  Specifically, how can a GTL9 
world afford starships in the first place that are on par with another 
world of much greater TL (GTL10-11)?
 
> Any thoughts?

My solution, although more handwaving than anything else, has the 
benefit of being fast, easy to implement and stays in line with the 
rules presented in GT.  Keep in mind that these numbers are for 
worlds the produce the product ... not those who buy it from 
someone else:

GTL9 - Max Jump 2, Max Man 3
GTL10 - Max Jump 3, Max Man 6
GTL11 - Max Jump 4, Max Man 8
GTL12 - Max Jump 6, Max Man 10

I further break down GTL9 by saying if the world has a class A 
starport then they can produce Jump 2.  If they have a class B, then 
they can produce only Jump 1 (but only in limited quanitities and it 
takes a long time to produce them).  I know this breaks the rules 
somewhat on what starports can produce, but IMO, scrunching the 
TLs together (going from 15 to 12) breaks some of them anyway.

So, instead of saying, "This world is GTL9 so only produces GTL9 
stuff," we say, "This world is GTL9 and creates early GTL10 stuff."  
And early GTL10 would be the lower Jump and Man drives ratings.

As I am also running a GT:T4 campaign, this fits in nicely. The new 
Imperium is Jump 3 but most (dang near all) of the worlds they 
encounter have a maximum of Jump 2 (if they have jump at all).  
And, yes, some worlds will only have a maximum of Jump 1.

As I said ... lots of handwaving.  The players don\'t mind, though.  It 
makes it easy for them to figure out what a world\'s capabilities are 
without consulting me all the time.

For some reason, I\'m reminded of the RPG _Teenagers from Outer Space_.
Earth is discovered by aliens. They have the technology, we have the

Neon lights don\'t work on plasma principles.  All we do is ionise the gas a 
bit.  If the temperature of the gas exceeds 1000 degrees C, I\'d be surprised.

True, but constant heat in the reaction vessel, plus stray neutrons impacting on the containment vessel wall (neutrons aren\'t affected much by magnetic fields) means that the walls *will* tend to crystalise over time, which is why IMTU relining the reactor is part of the yearly maintanance routine.

Clancy spins an interesting tale, but his military theory is sometimes weak.  So\'s his scientific theory.  Now if you\'d referenced something like Scientific American or some longhaired math pulled from a theoretical physics publication, I\'d buy it.  But Clancy?  A nice read, but I wouldn\'t bet the ranch on his theories.

Depends on what kind of hydrogen the reactor was designed to use.  Joe\'s 
Missouri Archives has a paper on the CNO catalyst reactor, which is designed 
to use straight \'protium\', and thus is the mainstay of fusion reactors IMTU.  
IMTU, most reactors have a small bottle of deuterium on the side to help with 
cold starts and to act kind of like nitrous oxide in a normal internal 
combustion engine.

Well, a fair assessment is:

Clancy: Generally, accuracy is reasonable, but he gives too much
credence to `military urban legends\'. He also has no military
background, being an accountant of some sorts.

Dale Brown: Must have spent too much time on pure oxygen whilst in SAC.
A stealthy B-52? Only if you take the engines off, for starters.
Rearward firing missiles? Present technical problems that have not yet
been overcome in the West. And (to keep this vaguely on topic), thinking
that a `Polar orbit\' involves the satellite in question being stationary
over the North Pole?

DiMercutio: More unlike submarine Vs submarine ASW than anything else I
have ever read.
 

And, for the subject at hand:

A SCRAM involving the control rods is recoverable. Dumping seawater into
the reactor will wreck it permanently.

MSNBC has decided to go to war against German influences in pop-culture.
They cite an interest in the language as a warning sign that your kid might
in an orgy of violence. They attack "violent German industrial groups,"
hinting that their lyrics are racist. Yesterday, their big target was KMFDM.

Of course, it doesn\'t stop there. MSNBC has also claimed that an interests
in WWII history and wargames are warning signs as well. Fanning the flames,
now we\'re seeing that violent video-games (such as Doom) are indicators that
your child is going to go berzerk when you least expect it. Of course, every
news report on the tragedy points out that wearing black clothing is a sure
sign that there is something wrong with your child. Fortunately, I haven\'t
heard too much about Dungeons & Dragons or roleplaying games in general, but
I\'m gritting my teeth for the onslaught.

So, why am I worried? In high school my friends and I all wore black
trenches. Nearly all of my friends took German. My older brother was a
wargaming grognard, instilling in me a love of hex and counter wargames, as
well as WWII history. I visited Germany as part of a student-exchange
program.  When I was there, I went to the "Go Bang!" music festival. One of
the bands I saw there was KMFDM. In the years between, I\'ve met several of
the members of KMFDM and saw them play live many times. They are up there as
one of my favorite bands. Don\'t believe everything that you see or read,
their lyrics and ideology are anything *but* racist or Nazi. I can\'t deny
their lyrics are violent, but I\'d hardly say that their lyrics incite their
listeners to violence. In the past, I\'ve performed and produced some
"industrial" music of my own, which was released on an internationally
distributed compilation. Much of my wardrobe is nothing but a swath of
black. I play Doom, as well as a host of other videogames that the media is
on the verge of "discovering" to boost their ratings and take advantage of
this tragedy.

I am an adult now, and as a result I usually get to choose who I spend time
with. I\'m in college, but the dynamic of college is undeniably different
than that of high school. I feel badly for everyone involved in the tragedy,
and my thoughts are with them. However, I also feel badly for the victims
who will be caught in the fallout of this tragedy. The kids in high school
now who are like my friends and I were. They wear black, take German, have
an interest in wargames and history, play videogames and listen to types of
music that most of the other kids at their school don\'t listen to. They are
already teased, tormented and beat up in school for extremely irrational
reasons. It can only get worse over the next couple of weeks until the
schools across the U.S. let their students out for the summer. Now, in
addition to being hated by their classmates for being different they will be
despised for being threatening, dangerous and downright evil.

It\'s a really sad situation all around, but I only fear that the media\'s
irresponsible coverage is going to make it worse. I know that this is way
off topic, and I apologize for that. I know that the "signal to grognard"
level here is high. As "informed sources" tell reporters with perfect hair
about how interest in "WWII and wargames" can be dangerous, there\'s going to
be alot of blanching. If the roleplaying angle is "discovered" by the media
(and dollars to donuts they will find AD&D books and Vampire books among the
"evidence"), there will be even more disgust and outrage here.

What hurts the most is that the real reasons for this horrible tragedy will
go undiscussed, while pop-psychology will reveal hidden messages in songs
that turned good boys bad. Instead of trying to discover how life at home
and at school contributed to the tragedy, they\'re going to point the finger
everywhere and anywhere that there happen to be media-friendly sound bites
and pop-psychologists decrying the "filth" that these kids had foisted upon
them by musicians and publishers whose only interest is the bottom line. For
every two kids who get pushed to the breaking point by the cruelty of their
classmates, there are literally thousands who put up with after-school
beatings, threats made in the cafeteria, and taunts written in black
permanent marker on their lockers. Very few talking heads on the television
will cite lack of attention by school faculty as a possible reason, even
fewer will cite the brutal xenophobia in American high schools.  Sorry about
the rambling, but this is something that (for obvious reasons) hits very
close to home for me. I don\'t think that there\'s ever an excuse for such a
tragedy, but only in understanding the real reasons will we stop them from
happening in the future.

Rob, I think the problem here isn\'t the amount of gothic stuff in AD&D
books, the problem is the shoddy definition of "gothic" in the press. As an
example, the ABCNews website gave a blurb about gothic culture and stated
that it draws influences from medieval European barbarism. Anyone who\'s had
even a fringe involvement in the gothic subculture would laugh at the
statement. However, bull is going to be shovelled by both sides in the
coming weeks. The lead singer from a popular gothic band, "Black Tape for a
Blue Girl" was on CNN yesterday, and she made the statement that "goths
don\'t wear trench coats." I laughed so hard that my sides hurt and my eyes
teared up. I spent more nights than I would care to recount at goth clubs,
and this simply isn\'t true. Misinformation. What works in traditional wars
works in the media war. Everybody\'s going to point their fingers and try to
distance themselves from being at ground zero when the lawsuits hit.

I heard the same comment today, and I had the same reaction. To further
illustrate your second point, a high school friend of mine was frequently
harassed and threatened with beatings. He walked up to his locker one day
and saw a threat and several disparaging insults. Later on during the day,
he was called down to the disciplinarian who told him he better remove it by
the end of the day or he\'d get in trouble.

3 or 4 hits??  Even before Putting the Heat Back into Plasma, the 4.3cm TL-12 
plasma rifle has a DV of 9.  Using D6s you can get 108.  A quick kill (double 
damage version) is more than possible (almost certain, I\'d say).  A Str 11, 
CON 11 has 66 points in the chest.  22 in the head.  After the "upgrade" to 
high energy weapons, the DV is 23.  Max (D6s) is 276.  Can you say "hot dog?" 
 :-)  Either way, after a couple hits.

W/ D10s, pre-PtHBiP max damage is 180.  After, max is 560!!!  This is w/ the 
weakest PGMP in the book.

STR and CON (there is no END) are equally important to hit capacity in TNE 
(except for the head).

p.s.  There are no psi points in TNE.  Plus, firing a PGMP in ductwork w/o 
enough room to even use ones claws isn\'t going to be fun because of 
\'backwash\' from splatter.

They\'re in Megatraveller and TNE (FF&S), at least.  Not sure bout FFS2, nor 
where in CT.  

"The next step beyond the black globe, however, was the white globe, a 
unidirectional force field that allowed a ship to maneuver and fire while 
completely shielded from enemy fire.  Because the field is unidirectional, 
energy can pass freely out through the barrier, but this still poses 
difficulties for incoming communications and sensor data.  As a result, white 
globes are tuned to allowe certain narrow wavelengths of energy through.  
These are usually wavelengths which are not particularly useful for weaponry, 
particularly space based weaponry.  White globe-equipped ships thus tend to 
rely heavily on infared wavelength radiation for sensors and make extensive 
use of masers for tight beam commo."

"White globes have less problem with radiation energy, as the electron globe 
of the field can radiate energy outward as easily as it can absorb it (which 
is why it glows white while in use).  The energy is first cycled through the 
system\'s HPG bank, however and is then discharged back to an unengaged part 
of the electron cloud for transmission outward.  As a result, white globes 
are not limited in the total amount of energy they can absorb, but only in 
the volume of energy they can process in a given amount of time.  This is 
determined by the size of the HPG banks and engineers refer to this limit as 
the "traffic flow ceiling."

This is nice work.  I\'ve only commented on the few items with which I
disagreed. (I\'m a resident lawyer, but by no means an economics expert.)

I would think that the world would have to grant full title to the land
to the Imperium, not merely lease it.  A lease only makes sense if the
world and Imperium contemplate someday parting company.  Does the
Imperium allow secession?  I don\'t think so.  Permanent membership is
part of the political dynamic of the Imperium:  The world gets almost
total local control forever, as well as the benefits of interstellar
trade and Imperial defense.  The Imperium gets a starport, taxes, a
conscript pool, and another world that is never a security threat.

Well, Joe the Farmer or Geni the Miner on their undeveloped worlds -- or
even undeveloped countries -- might clear some land and pave it and set
up a taco stand and have their own private class E starports for only a
small capital investment.  ("OK Billy, your papers are in order and
would you like some of our new special Cipatwean hot sauce with that
enchilada?")

SPA has authority over private ports as well as public.  All starports
have to follow the same safety, customs, and other procedures applicable
to their class.

Any starport comes under naval jurisdiction in time of war.

I generally agree, except that starships are allowed to have nuclear
missiles.  The Imperial Rules of War only prohibit the use of nuclear
weapons on member states.  The rationale is economic:  nuclear weapons
destroy the infrastructure on a large scale and have persistent and wide
area effects (i.e., radiation and fallout).  These are not problems in
space -- at most, ships will destroy each other, which is not a loss to
the Imperium on the scale of losing a city.  Therefore, the Imperium
allows ships to possess nuclear missiles for self-defense.  

So how to deal with starport security issues around nuclear missiles? 
There is no blanket solution.  The Imperium has low-threat areas like
the center and high-threat areas like the borders, especially the
Spinward Marches and Solomani Rim.  Local officials, in coordination
with Naval Intelligence and sector governments, have a lot of
discretion.  A starport may go so far as to require nuclear warheads to
be off-loaded and taken into custody before the ship is allowed to enter
the port.  Indeed, a port may require that all ship-mounted weapons be
disabled, and may set up a weapons scanning station at the airlock of
every ship (this tends to be standard on high ports everywhere).  On the
other hand, many ports may be in such a low-threat context that they
have hardly any security requirements.

> cultures. 

Imperial law as you\'re discussing it here applies only on or in Imperial
civilian installations (including starports; naval, military, and Scout
installations and vessels have their own regulations).  It\'s general
because (1) its only purpose is as you stated:

> However, some basics are retained to prevent the breakdown of law
> and order in society. 

but I would say, "to prevent the breakdown of law and order on or in
Imperial installations."  Societies are the member states; they have
their own standards of law and order, and the Imperium keeps its hands
off.  Imperal law is also general because (2) as you stated, it applies
to an enormous variety of sophonts who may be on Imperial installations.

No, I don\'t think the local culture and environment have anything to do
with the laws governing Imperial installations.  This body of Imperial
law always prohibits unjustified violence, interference with private and
public property, conduct that is unsafe to the actor or to others,
actions against the interest of the Imperium (espionage, etc.), and
slavery.  The Imperial officer in charge of the installation has some
discretion in interpreting the law.  The Imperium recognizes that not
all its citizens would consider all of these laws necessary or
appropriate, but the consensus is that they allow Imperial installations
to function properly, and are therefore obeyed and respected.

In addition, the starport and the host world will cooperate on matters
of smuggling, pursuit, extradition, and so on.  Entering and leaving a
starport normally entails clearing two customs/passport control stations
- -- the port\'s and the world\'s.  These may be combined or separate.

> Legal aid may be found at Type C starports and above, at least for local
> matters. 

Common criminal defendants don\'t have a right to counsel (although
nobles do).  (For civil law matters, of course, no one has a right to
counsel -- just the right to the counsel one can afford.)  So the person
accused of a crime on an Imperial installation must go through the
Imperial judicial process.  That may mean custodial transfer to a
higher-level starport or more important world where an Imperial judge
can be found to hear the case.  (Of course, the accused will be more
likely to find a lawyer there, too, and, while the Imperium doesn\'t have
to provide counsel, the Imperial authorities won\'t normally deny an
accused access to counsel.)

The Zhodani should be dead from the backblast of his PGMP.  Isn\'t there

be dead after the first shot at that range -- so your rant is well

Like that famous guy said, energy equals mass multiplied by the velocity
of light squared.  The velocity of light is a very big number.  Squared
it\'s much bigger.  So even you multiply that number by a very very very
small number representing mass, you still get a very big number for
energy.  At least that\'s how a high-verbal, low-math type like me thinks
of it.

Funny, that\'s how Vargr parents describe their kids!  

The Diplomatic Elementary School on Jesedipere must be in a constant
state of riot; they probably only hire instructors who have Marine
Commando experience and Melee Combat-3.  By high school, things have
probably calmed down as the Vargr and human kids start focussing on the
important things:  Vargr and human kids of the opposite sex/appropriate
orientation.

And I\'m sure some kids are going to date across species lines, if only
to annoy their parents.

As Clancy does not have a military or physics background, I 
think we can assume that he got the description of the "cold 
water accident" from someone who knew better than he did. 
Ironically, the fact that Clancy doesn\'t know a damn thing
about nuclear reactors is what makes his description credible - 
he clearly does a lot of research, and gets a lot of it right.

to do it _again_ ... and _again_ ... all because the "EB-52" is

Here comes my Heresy on Tech Levels (I know I have pronounced it
before, but here we go again...).
Tech levels indicate an ability (physical capability, infrastructure,
trained workers, etc.) to produce an item primarily.  It has also to do
with knowing _how_ and _why_ to do it.  You could _build_ a Frisby at
TL1 (maybe even TL0, ex: boomerangs), but understanding _why_ it works
is TL 6/7.  The making of plastics is usually pegged at TL5/6 for early
stuff and you get fancier plastics at higher TLs.  We usually think of
frisbies as the plastic disks we usually throw around now, but the
originals were apparently metal pie tins (which work pretty well
actually).
Being _able_ to make something does not mean that you _will_ make it,
but if you do start making it when it is possible, it will get better
only in an evolutionary way until you understand the _whys_ of it.  Once
you understand why something works, you can make revolutionary changes
in the product.
Therefore (and here\'s the Heresy), if a planet is labeled TL7 in the
3I, it could have only an understanding of TL7 or it could have an
understanding of TL15 and on the capability of doing more than TL7
production.

That rings a bell for me. I had a high school incident that I\'m
actually still kind of bitter about. 

A very clean-cut kid who I had exchanged a lot of ill will with 
(well, okay, I flipped him off in the hall eariler) knocked me 
down in a classroom. I was willing to let it go (being used to 
a wide variety of abuse, not a fighter by nature, and, after all, 
having provoked him), but the instructor sent us off to the vice 
principal\'s office. Quoth the VP to me after I related my side 
of the story: "Are you sure you didn\'t just fall down by yourself?"

I was pretty much stunned. I can\'t even remember what I responded, 
or if I did at all. "Um, yeah, that\'s it, I fell down, and that\'s 
why Mr. G sent us to you." The guy who knocked me down was just a 
high school jerk - kids are like that - but I still have a simmering
ember of contempt for the VP.

ObTrav, possibly in poor taste, so sue me:
Disgruntled schoolkids with PGMPs.

Part of this is simply lack of information on the part of the
media.  D&D is, no question, the best-known product of the
industry, and the mass media likes short words with little
intellectual content.  Thus, "rôle-playing game", which has a
somewhat arcane and intellectual sound (maybe it\'s something that
psychologists use), is to be avoided; "Dungeons and Dragons" is
better, as everyone knows what dungeons are, and what dragons
are, and know that it\'s escapist fantasy (although they wouldn\'t
necessarily think of it consciously that way); "D&D" is still
better, since it\'s short, too.

On top of that, "Dungeons and Dragons" and "D&D" are a good way
to press one of the hot buttons of the so-called "religious
right".  One of the books had to be renamed - and practically
rewritten - to placate them; they were going on and on about
"devil worship" because of the title of the book and the names of
the demons whose stats were given.  The media remembers that, and
sensationalism sells.

yeah; these stories ring a bell. This country worships sports, and "jocks" 
are thus BM/WOC (big man/woman on campus). In my school district, (which is 
pretty consernative) teachers volunteering to coach is definitely a career 
enhancing move....A lot of the Administrators are into sports which doesn\'t 
help the non conformists. This is starting to change as more and more 
principals rise from the ranks of teachers, and are not ex-jocks/coaches 
themselves...When I teach; if I coach (will be tough as my sports are ice 
hockey and lacrosse; not in demand in Las Vegas, but I can coach the off/def 
lines in American Football in a pinch); I will try get my players to view 
themselves as protectors of the weak and outcast, and not their primary 
tormentors. Maybe I can get through to them that being on the top of the 
pecking order has responsibilities that go with the privileges, and it\'s 
"cool" to break up fights and prevent bullying, instead of perpetrating it. 
Heck the Medieval church tried this on the knights and it worked to a certain 
extent. It\'s a leadership problem that parents and schools have to address...

Not necessarily. Your Universal Identification Card (UIC) would have enough
information to identify you, but why would it necessarily include your
marriage? Would it include a record of all _other_ contracts you\'ve entered
into?

Given the lasse faire nature of the Imperium, at least by 1107, I\'d lean
towards the UIC including DNA, fingerprints and retinal scans, and all
other data necessary to _identify_ you, and only that. Your marital status
is no more a part of your identity than your political views, the overdue
fine for a library book when you were a child...

I just can\'t see the Imperium being bothered with all the trivial stuff.
IMTU, even your criminal record will only be on your UIC if the crimes were
Imperial crimes, judged in an Imperial court. (Also a good plot hook:
players might decide to risk planetary justice because that way their
interstellar ID stays clean.)

Trade papers would be a separate matter, and handled separately. Another
hard-to-forge card, maybe, that might include an encryption code so that it
will only display when inserted into the reader with your UIC.

Fighting isn\'t an outlet when everyone outweighs you by 15-20 pounds. One
learns other coping mechanisms then. Like passive aggression. (I didn\'t say
_good_ coping mechanisms!)

Probably the same way we deal with their children: with kid gloves, and a

watch their children closely. :-)

That works for capabilities, but to be strictly accurate (to GT rules) the
GTL9 worlds need to use different jump and maneuver modules. (GTL11 jump
and maneuver modules are identical to GTL12, according to VE2, so your
maximum values are a good handwave there.)

The heavier GTL9 power plant is a bit of a problem, but the thrusters make
even an unarmoured ship incredibly slow. I modified GT Shipyard to allow
GTL9 hulls, engineering modules, jump drives, and thrusters (as posted
here) and couldn\'t get a J1, 1G ship that worked. Part of the problem was
the massive crew requirements.

My solution would be to use the GTL9 values at TL9 values (ie. new
technology), and come up with hybrid values between GTL9 and GTL10 to
reflect Traveller TL10 and TL11. I just haven\'t had time to run some
numbers for these (nor the design experience to do a good job, I think).

You get them involved with a group of adults who treat them as an equal.

Ideally well-balanced adults.  "These are nice people, they like me, and
they listen to me" works wonders.

Mind you, in today\'s paranoid culture, any group of adults trying this with
troubled teens had better be able to afford a lawyer, if said troubled teen
decides to accuse one of the adults of improper behaviour.  I run this risk
every day at school, but I have a strong union that will defend me (unlike
my employer, who will try to avoid and trace of blame by throwing me to the
wolves).

Or, the "Harvard Lampoon" version:

Barbisol was Twodor\'s king
  Whose foes his mighty blade did sting,
Till one day it got all rusted
  And Sorhed\'s parry left it busted.

Thus gloried Twodor came to nothing,
  Out of the king was beat the stuffing.
And thus we live in fear of Fordor
  Till Krona\'s back in working order!

Against the True King Sorhed\'s workin\'
  So play your cards close to you jerkin,
For fortune strums a mournful tune
  For those whose campaigns peak too soon.

It\'s been awhile and I don\'t have a copy handy, But didn\'t canon originally
say that drop tanks were one time use devices, like aircraft drop tanks?
That would definitely tip the balance against drop tanks for all but
specialized uses IMHO.

That being said what might those uses be?  I would expect military uses. Not
on ships specially designed to use drop tanks instead of internal tankage,
but as well as internal tankage. Arrive in the target system with the
capability to jump back out if things get too hairy. Without having to fight
a SDB for the right to refuel at a GG.

IISS might find them useful to extend the range of exploration and survey
vessels. Not Xboats though. If they\'re expensive and hazardous it isn\'t
worth the risk. However high cost postal packet corps might feel
differently, if someone will pay them enough to make it worthwhile.

On a tanget:Ticket prices are too expensive, even using FT rules. I expect
not many people will travel to nearby same subsector tourist locations if
the only way that they can afford to go is to send themselves as cargo.  Is
there a way economically to explain why tickets on a Main coreward is more
affordable than out on the fringes? Even when travelling by Liner?

I have some more to say on this thread, but I won\'t be able to run the

fusion I think is pretty germain, from sources (instead out of my very 
fallible head).

Fusion is not total mass-energy conversion, helium is produced as 
well.  Also, the only current successful model of hot fusion (i.e. 
stars) involves enormous temperatures and pressures.  Finally, no 
power plant ever known has been 100% efficent, and thermodynamics puts 
theoretical limits on efficency.  

I will get out my modern physics textbook and run some numbers over 
the above points soon.  I\'ll also try to think of ways a fusion 
reactor would "run amock", thus requiring heroic PC intervention.

Not to disagree but, at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility

NASA even now.  As a matter of fact isn\'t LHY necessary for any ship in

You part Zho, Rob? ;-)

I was _just_ thinking about writing this very thing...

I was pondering _my_ school years and how a caring adult got me onto the
right track. A Young Adult librarian at my local public library branch
started a video club and a science fiction club...Sarajean saved a bunch
of people this way. We were all nerds and outcasts, and we finally found
someone who would take us seriously and taught us it _does_ get better.
I learned a _lot_ from and with those people.

She\'s one of those people in my life who could call at 3 AM "Help I\'m in
a turkish jail" and I\'d be on a plane flying east by 3:30...there\'s be a
bunch of us, too...

ObTrav...it\'d take a good roleplayer, but whatta hook to get PC\'s on a
quest.

>How do you convince a depressed kid in High School Hell that things *are*

You don\'t. I promise you that they won\'t believe you if you do. Remember,
teenagers really do know it all. Once most of us hit adulthood and realize
how little we really do know, we forget that we once felt that we knew it
all.

I\'ve tried to write a message explaining my point of view on what parents
and teachers can do to help outcast children (from my own experience), but
it\'s way to long and way off topic. Here\'s a short excerpt though:

When I was in high school, there was this one English teacher who I\'ll
always remember. At one school dance, she saw me with a "Jane\'s Addiction"
t-shirt and she called me over. We started talking about the group. During
the conversation, she said that she didn\'t like their music, but their
lyrics were absolutely fantastic. A year or two later I was in the art room
(Miss Christian was very good friends with Ms. Rogers, the art teacher), and
I was looking for some supplies in a closet. I came across some huge thick
binders. My curiosity got the best of me, and I started paging through them.
They were filled with mimeographed sheets containing song lyrics, and
explanations (from students) about what the lyrics meant to me. A friend of
mine who\'s older brother had gone to the same school a short time before
explained how she would give an assignment called "The Poetry of Rock."
Students would pick a song and analyze the lyrics as if it were the poetry
they had to analyze in class. It was only several years after I took her
class that I realized how brilliant that assignment was on so many levels.

On one hand, she was teaching in a manner that meant something to her
classes. While lots of kids might grumble at analyzing stuff written by
various dead poets, they always loved to analyze the lyrics to a song that
was vibrant and special *to them*. It worked in other ways, too. She was
deeply involved with her kids, and she was part of a cabal of teachers and
counselors that really cared about their students. She was able to read
about what these songs *meant* to the kids who listened to them year after
year. It helped her to understand where the kids were coming from and she
could share this type of thing with other teachers who felt they were having
problems with certain kids. It also made her "hip" to some extent. She could
converse with kids on their own level in a friendly fashion and earn their
trust.

As I\'ve met people from other areas, I\'ve never met anyone who had a
comparable assignment in high school, and that\'s a damned shame. That one
assignment had an effect on everybody I know who took it, and I know each
group of kids who take that assignment have their effects on Miss Christian
as well.

If anyone\'s interested in my opinions on the subject, I\'d love to share them
off list, where it\'s more appropriate. I\'m not an expert on the subject, but
I can tell you what worked with my friends and I, and what didn\'t. It\'s
still fresh on my mind. Eventually, I\'d like to end up teaching history and
I hope I\'ll still remember my experiences as a student when I do.

Something like the "Jocks Templar"? ;^)

Seriously though, this will work. I saw a few kids in my school who used
their popularity for good instead of evil. Some of the "jocks" were fans of
bands we liked and as such would be (at the very least) pleasant to us...
especially the day after a concert we had run into them at.

I couldn\'t agree more. Really. This comes from personal experience. Of
course, it helps to a great degree if they\'re not only well-balanced adults,
but *open minded* adults. The kind of people who remember that their parents
and teachers were on their backs because they listened to The Beatles and
The Rolling Stones, or Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, or Elvis, or
whatever\'s appropriate. I imagine that alot of teachers who are beginning to
enter the pool now were weaned on the same music I was...

Frightening thought. I\'d better get moving with my life.

You might want to write off to our government about that. The CBC is being
cut back (again), and the CRTC is reviewing its license. Some of the
commercial stations are arguing that, because they broadcast the same type
of program, the CBC has no right to do so. Thus, because City TV broadcasts
news*, they want CBC out of the news business.

ObTrav? Can\'t think of one. The Imperium has no equivalent to the CBC.

*City is notorious for using "videographers" instead of reporters, who are
(a) very young and ill-informed, and (b) more interested in artistic camera
angles than conveying information.

ObTrav: A challenge. Write a starter scenario for Traveller, suitable for
use by beginners to role-playing (let alone Traveller).  Something a high
school gaming club could use with a minimum of preparation. Include all the
explanatory material and notes so that new gamers could start right away,
and have a reasonable chance of success in the adventure.  Choose a theme

I\'m probably way behind with this but-- SCRAM--"Super-Critical Rapid Ax Man"
shutdown.
Fission reactors work in this way. Fuel, which is some kind of Uranium or
Plutonium isotope gives off neutrons which cause a chain reaction and
releases energy and more neutrons. A moderator-like carbon or hafnium is
used as a neutron moderator. It absorbs neutrons and stops the reaction.  To
produce energy you pull the moderator, which is typically fabricated into
rods out of the reactor and the chain reaction starts.
In the early days (at the University of Chicago among other places) the rods
were pulled up using pulleys and ropes. If the Reactor got out of control
and had to be shut down in an emergency the ropes could be cut with an ax
by----you guessed it---- the Super-Critical Rapid Ax Man!!
Modern commercial reactors use hydraulically operated control rods that are
typically magnetically latched. In an emergency they are forcefully inserted
by either mechanical (spring), hydraulic or pneumatic pressure either
automatically by an alarm system or manually (via a switch).  After use the
rods can typically be relatched and the reactor brought back to operation.
I expect that a fusion reactor will also have some kind of automatic
protective shutdown system, but in the strictest sense it will NOT SCRAM.

Sorry Falcon you have you\'re procedures confused. What you\'re describing is
an emergency cooling event.  The reactor is indeed SCRAM\'ed prior to
initiating emergency cooling, but a SCRAM is **not** a reactor damaging
event. Indeed since any one of several hundred alarm events can cause a
commercial or naval reactor to SCRAM IRL the owners of these power plants
have procedures in place that allow them to recover from a SCRAM event in a
relatively short time.
An emergency cooling event on the other hand is the result of a major loss
of reactor cooling or reactor containment integrity. Three Mile Island had a
major loss of reactor cooling followed by a failure of its emergency cooling
system.  The reactor SCRAM\'ed but that was a good thing under the
circumstances.

Universal Imperial ID, which contains in a very tamperproof, non-votile form
all relevant information on the person. This is how certified Astrogators,

Can it be spoofed by PC\'s with high skill levels in electronic forgery? Of

They have a primary burst radius of 5m, in TNE anyways.  It\'s possible to get 
hit by 6 fragments, each of which will do 2d6 (or 2d10) damage per *second* 
until removed.  TNE uses 5 second combat rounds.  5 attempts [Average AGL] 
may be made per round.  This applies to everything within the blast area 
(secondary blast area is 10m, which just gives a lesser chance of being hit, 
in the case of high energy weapons), including the firing character and 
target.  Armor has a delaying effect, but will eventually conduct through 
unless it\'s discarded or removed (and what are you going to "remove" a blob 
of plasma with?  ;-)

High Energy weapons were notoriously weak in TNE until GDW put out an 
official upgrade in Challenge Magazine and Striker II.

I disagree with this statement.

Sure, a _few_ of them may have such a motivation, but I\'d say _most_
terrorists and villians have the same motivations as player characters.

The search for the fast buck, an ideological reason, or "heroism",
they\'re just heroes for the other side.

The best villians are always relatively sane, moral, patient individuals
working for the betterment of their race or species, who are demonstrably
_right_. Someone like a Martin Luther King or Mahatma Ghandi.

But when they are Zhodani or Vargr, it doesn\'t matter how right they are for
the Zho\'s or the Vargr, your players just have to beat then anyway, don\'t
they ?

If you add just a touch of pride, and a bit of temper to them, you get good
comicbook villians like Magneto or Ras Al Ghul, or the Irish RL hero Michael
Collins.

They were indeed designed to make charecters for play - charecters that
reflect the society they are from.  It is no more  [and no less]
unreasonable to look at the average levels of Fleet Tactics Zhodani
Admirals will have when generated then it is to look at the Psionic
skills they have, or to look at the social atitudes they will have based
on their societies.  When the Alien charecter generation process was
done deliberate choices were made as to how to midify the Imperial human
charecter generation process.  It is by no means unreasonable to use
this _canonical_ data to look at the charecters they will generate.

For example when you compare the possible skills from the Naval
charecter generation sequence for the "Navy Life" skill table between
the Imperial Navy and the Solomani Confederation Navy you will note that
the Imperial Navy gives a chance of Carousing but the Confederation Navy
does not.  This reflects real differences between the two societies as
seen by Marc Miller and John Harshman when they wrote the charecter
generation.  The different frequency of Fleet Tactics skill is just as
reasonable an item to look at.

or example in the Imperial Navy you may learn Fleet Tactics _only_ while
serving as a staff officer of Rank O4+ [Fleet Tactics is not on the
Command Officer skill table - Ship Tactics is] and are twice as likely
to learn Fleet Tactics if you are O7+ and serve in a staff position, by
attending Command College, or attending Staff College.  In the Solomani
Navy you may gain Fleet Tactics while serving as Staff Officer of rank
O4+ [but are no more likely to learn it if you are O7+] or while serving
as a Command Officer of rank 07+, in Command College, or while
undergoing Officer Training as a former enlisted person,  Solomani going
to Staff College do not learn Fleet Tactics.

Therefore the _canonical_ data for the Imperial Navy show that staff
officers learn Fleet Tactics while Command officers do not.  In the
Solomani Nvay both Command and Staff officers can learn Fleet Tactics. 
This says something about the differences between the two institutions.

I was using the "historical" definition of Tech Levels from CT which
states that Tech Level 6 is approximated by the [US?] technology of
"circa 1940 and 1969" and tech level 7 is "circa 1970 to 1979" -  The
Traveller Bokk HC page 85. 

What I meant was that the particular plastic frisbee that Sigrid, the
charecter in question, was descibed by the Ref as made by the Frisbee
Company [still around] being basically the same as a modern Frisbee
despite the fact that when she bought it on a TL F [Terra/Solomani Rim
circa 1081] world.  Therefore this particular frisbee was modern.  I do
not know, nor much care, to what degree the Frisbee company has changed
the pladstic composition of their plastic Frisbees since they were
introduced.  I know that their introduction was post WW II which makes
modern Frisbees TL 6, possibly 7 or 8 if they now use higher tech
plastic [ I bet that they do not].

I run a very Heretic Space marine Campaign set in the 2300 AD universe using
the TNE system (I\'m an old Twilight 2000 fan, so it suits me :)

The characters get \'adventure points\' at the end of each mission. These
points can be used to raise a skill before or after a mission as follows.
The number of points needed to increase a skill are the level the skill is
going to eg. to go from level 3 to level 4 in a skill costs 4 points. That
is the standard TNE way of doing it. A new skill costs 1 point, but I have
added a stipulation that the character must find some way of getting
training in a new skill to learn it... Makes it interesting for skills like
Xenobiology.
I have also added in a system like in Runequest where a skill must have been
usefully used in an adventure to qualify for an increase, this means placing
a tick beside the skill when used and I deem it appropriate. Putting that in
made my players try to find ways to use their skills, which has made the
whole game a lot more fun for everyone. One character has gained a carousing
skill of 8! I must say they worked on it, many a hard earned credit has gone
across the spaceport bar :)
I have no level limit on skills, if you want to spend the points, go ahead.
As the system uses a D20 it\'s a linear increase anyway so big deal.

Well, that\'s my rant for now,

Cheers,
 Anson.

This list is very similar to what my STSK (Standard Traveller Starter Kit)
consisted of also...

Including suitable footwear, dress shoes, sport shoes, boots, etc., as
applicable, and jacket(s).  Not to mention underwear (D\'oh!  I wasn\'t going
to mention that!) and ship\'s uniform if part of a ship\'s crew... the
underwear thing was also like the dress from Aliens series that the marines
wore, etc.

And I would assign something individual to each player so they were not
clones of each other, like one may have a PC or equivalent, while another
might have a dedicated game device (like a Sega/Nintendo/or whatever),
another might have a sound system, hobby goods (stamps, trading cards
[electronic??], model starship kits, etc.), and so on.

Then comes the real hardware.  No PC could start the game with more than one
firearm of a nominated TL, and one normal blade weapon.  I never saw the
point in arming them to the teeth before play (I never made life that easy
for them, but never stopped them from acquiring things via roleplay).
Everything else they needed (ropes/cables, communicators, etc.) was
roleplayed for.

I think you will find that a wife is a wife is a wife, and the US government
will recognise it as such.  An English family recently had a hell of a time
getting their (I think) 16 year old daughter\'s marriage annulled to a
Turkish man(?) in his 20\'s... she had met him on holidays, wed under Turkish
law and England had to let the family sort it out as it was not under their
control (The couple *were* married!).

I disagree:

The TNS is funded by its members (who want to know the news) rather
than advertisers and sponsors (who want to influence it).

Its not under Imperial control either.

(Of course, its not perfect - there\'s a big entrance fee to become a
 member and lots of the members also run government and the corps but
 I always assume that non-members can use many of the facilities
 on a pay as you go basis - eg buying their TL15 "newspaper".)

My take is that planets can restrict the types of goods imported or exported
between Imperial territory and the the planet but cannot sieze or destroy
goods or ships leagally in transit through the system (up to and including
the Starport).

The automatic safety systems should have taken the sytem off line, but
assuming that they have been overridden...

Inertial confinement means that several powerful laser beams will
add the player\'s hand to the plasma.

Magnetic Confinement would almost certainly be broken by the player\'s
hand but the immediate effects should include radiation sickness.
I don\'t think that multi tessla magnetic fields would be very healthy
either.

Gravitic confinement - nothing that is visible from outside the Star.
If the player is an arm\'s length from a steller core, they are way
too close.

Damper catalysed reactions might be able to continue.

All guesses, of course

IIRC

The girl was under 16 (specifically, the marriage couldn\'t have been
conducted in England).

There is a much closer example of this in Britain.
Under English law, you need parental permission to marry upto 18
(and I don\'t think you can marry before 16)
Under Scottish Law, you don\'t need parental permission at 16 or 17.
So there are frequental references to couples heading across the
border to get married.

Its possible that these laws have been updated recently.

Well, what got *me* thru, was something like this:

If I was right, and nobody gave damn or everyone disliked me, then I\'d
be doing them a *favor* by committing suicide. 

If I was *wrong* and someone actually *did* care, then I\'d be hurting
them terribly by committing suicide.

It *sounds* awfully "logical", but there\'s a lot of emotional stuff in
there. And it *did* get me thru.

Huh? Since the kids at the bottom tend to be the ones least able to
fight, how does this give them an outlet?

I expect that Vargr children are both *worse* and *better*. Consider
the dynamics of a wolf pack. The cubs get a lot of attention, but they
also learn *quickly* that *any* adult has more "status" than they do,
so they know not to "bother" an adult who is busy. Nor to bother an
adult who says "no!". 

K\'kree are going to be more like herd animals. As such, I expect that
the males get kicked out of the herd at "puberty" and have to earn a
place in a herd later. 

Anybody know if K\'kree "herds" are of the "single male, lots of
females" model (horses), or the "dominant male, a few subordinate
males, lots of females" model? It\'ll make a difference in the social
structure. 

Aslan I\'m not going to get into. Though I *think* they follow the "lion
pride" model.

Hiver "children" *are* animals. Until they get big enough, and bright
enough to be "adopted", they don\'t count.

Back in 9th grade (last year of junior high), there was a jerk who\'d
been harassing me for years. One day I was walking with a friend to the
friend\'s house, instead of to my place. This meant I was walking south
instead of west, so I was walking in the same direction as the jerk.

He accosted me and proceeded to spray me with mace (this was *long*
before pepper spray). Unfortunately for him, I both wear glasses *and*
have suffered from extreme allergies all my life. So the spray didn\'t
get into my eyes, and the effects from the spray *near* my eyes and
nose wasn\'t much worse than a bad allergy attack. So I chased *him*. I
didn\'t catch him. 

My friend advised me to leave it at that. But I was *really* pissed. So
I walked back to school and told the whole story to a school counselor.
The jerk got suspended from school and in various other sorts of
trouble (he\'d shoplifted the mace sprayer). 

As my friend had warned, many folks at the school were mad at *me* for
dragging adults into a "private" affair. I didn\'t much care because my
few friends didn\'t, and I had given up on pleasing the majority of the
other kids *long* before. 

But that attitude is *exactly* the sort of thing that leads to these
problems. Another one is the old "it takes two to make a fight". Lord,
the number of times I heard that. If I\'d known then what I know now,
I\'d told the "responsible adults" saying that "So you\'d rather I just
stood there and let him beat the shit out of me? It\'s not as if I can
out run him, you know."

Another good response would be "Yeah, but it only takes *one* to
administer a beating."

More to the point, I can see the PGMP blast, in a duct at least

Actually, they do. Ionized gas *is* a plasma. And the temp in a plasma
of that sort is more determined by voltage versus atomic weight (ie in
terms of electron volts).

The temperature is determined by the average kinetic energy, but in a
plasma that gets *real* weird, real fast.

Well, it helps to remember that there\'s not a lot of heat *transfer*

But, if you aviod the conditions that cause a "cold water" accident,

Oops! You *do* have a point there. But a quick re-calculation shows
that 4H->1He converts approximately .7% of the maass to energy. So for
250 MW, that gives a fuel consumption rate of 383 micrograms per
second. That\'s *still* trivial.

Actually, we have *several* succesful models of "hot" fusion. The
various magnetic confinement reactors have been fusing hydrogen for
*years*. They just aren\'t producing more energy than it takes to run
them.

Ditto for inertial confinement. And with the IEC process I\'ve described
in previous posts, even a high school student can build a reactor that
demonstrate fusion occuring by the number of neutrons produced. 

Rather than high "temperatures" IEC relies on high *voltages*. Either
way you get the protons moving *fast*.

It\'s going to be pretty difficult since *all* the remotely usable
methods that involve continuous fusion require external electric or
magnetic fields to maintain the conditions that allow fusion. Cut the
fields and the plasma simply disperses. 

Inertial fusion fuses pellets, and if something goes wrong you either
cut the laser or particle beams, or you cut the pellet feed. Being
pulsed, nothing much can go wrong.

Not quite. The graphite or water in the reactor acts as a moderator.
That is, it slows the fast neutrons produced by fission down until they
are moving slowly enough to *initiate* fission. This bit about slowing
down the neutrons was the critical trick required to make fission work.

The control rods use elements such as boron or cadmium, which *absorb*
neutrons. They let you regulate the reaction. The more rod inside the
reactor, the more neutrons get absorbed, and the reaction slows down.

They also have provisions for flooding the reactor vessel with a borate
solution, which will absorb neutrons like crazy, but is going to make
re-start a royal *pain*, as you\'ll pretty much have to disassemble the
reactor, clean all the parts, and re-assemble it to get it running
reliably. The borate solution is *intended* to get into everywhere,
which is why cleaning it up so hard.

Fusion reactions that we can create are *not* self-sustaining. So it\'s
trivial to shut them down. Cut off the containment fields, or the fuel
feed and it\'ll stop dead.

It\'s rather like a particular type of furnace I\'ve heard about. The
fuel will *only* burn if the pressure in the combustion chamber is
several atmospheres. So it requires one *hell* of a "forced draft".
Kill that and the fire goes out immediately.

It\'s the sort of detail he gets *right*. I\'ve read about it elsewhere.
That was just the most accessible description of it I know of.

The M2134 Gauss sniper rifle was adopted by the Terran Confederation
during the Second Interstellar War and remained its standard issue sniper
rifle until it was replaced by the M2268. The M2134 was bascially a
standard vehicle mounted M2129 VRF Gauss machinegun fitted with a
bipod, electronic sights and recoil absorbing shoulder stock. The M2134
shared 87% commonality with the M2129, with the major difference being
that the M2134 used a small 15 round box magazine rather than the
M2129\'s 12000 round cassette. The M2134 was capable of firing either
single shots or a 3 round burst. The M2134 could be fitted with a tripod
and accept standard M2129 cassettes for use as a support weapon (with
a cyclic rate of 1200 rpm) and was fitted with an adaptor for an external
power source (339 Kw) on such ocassions.

I saw a news program where a reporter and an accountant analyzed a
"typical" two-income household. The added expenses caused by having
both parents work exceeded the extra income the wife was making.
She cried when she realized that she\'d given up so much time with her
children for zero financial gain, it was touchingly sad to see her reap the
bitter results of selfishly wanting a career of her own.

Oh, right, sarcasm: the bias of the article was more blatant than an
overturned sewage truck at a street fair. It seemed that if the family
did anything that made having two careers easier, the accountant charged
the whole amount against the wife\'s take-home income. A home computer
purchased to help with doing the bills. Every time they ate out or ordered
a pizza. Toys or trips purchased to "make up for not being home with
the kids". I can understand charging the extra travel expenses, professional
wardrobe and child care against the wife\'s take-home, but at *worst* the
family was breaking even - and that was with the wife at the beginning
or midpoint of her career, her earnings should increase with time.

So what average level will a Zhodani Admiral get from the Zhodani Navy

While inspection of the character generation sequences can be valuable

I can\'t think of a way to easily and usefully perform a statistical analysis.

Hmmm...look at each navy, determine the % chance an "average" officer
will have of gaining Fleet Tactics skill in any particular year, multiply it
out by some "average" time-in-service factor? That might have some
use...but I\'m limited to Vargr, Solomani, Zhodani, Aslan and Third Imperium

Imperium is basically a (huge) trade federation, it does anything and

Nope. They\'re still the same in Scotland. In fact, anyone in Scotland who
has stayed longer than 2 weeks in the country is considered a resident
(event of secondary residence) of the country, and is eligible to marry.
This is one of the things my (american) wife and I found out last year when
we got married which had the rather nice effect of expediting her UK visa.

Gretna Green is still used by a lot of people to elope to and get married,
although the queues are slightly longer than they used to be, and you now
have to book your wedding in advance instead of just turning up.

Sometimes. And sometimes he uses artistic license to fill the gaps. I\'m
not convinced by the description of the reactor in RSR (basically, a PWR
running at an absurdly high pressure). The description of the accident
makes me twitch, but since I\'m not a nuclear physicist I can\'t work out
exactly what is wrong.

Sounds counterintuitive - if you know what you\'re talking about, you
don\'t need to do as much research and you don\'t misinterpret things.

No, but western research hasn\'t addressed the problems of firing a
missile backwards. Having a missile turn hard after launch is one thing
(not a good thing, mind you, since it\'s going to burn energy); rearward
launch is another. And has Russia actually deployed their rearward
facing missile, or is it another vapourware product, like so much that
is spoken of these days?

Well, there\'s a loud hisssss as atmosphere rushes into the chamber (fusing
plasma will double as a reasonably good vaccuum) followed by repeated loud
smacking sounds as the chief engineer beats the PC silly for wrecking the
ship\'s power supply by putting a hole in the containment vessel big enough to
stick their hand through.

Plasma is very hot, but there\'s so little mass there that it ca\'t heat
anything sustantial up very much.

OTOH, other compnents of the fusion powerplant can be really dangerous to mess
with. Somewhere along the line a significant portion of the energy given off
by the fusion reaction does get turned into heat, which needs to be gotten rid
of. It just isn\'t stored in the plasma, but in the MHD coils or steam turbines
or whatever mechanism is used to turn energy from the fusion reaction into electricity.

I agree. I also pushed shotguns and carbines a lot, for two reasons. Players

Speaking as the kid who was always at the end of the line when we lined up

We have artwork for Scout service patches in-house, so they have a leg up
in getting done, but other possibilities include FT Beowulf crew patches,
Marine, Navy, &  Army units, mercenary outfits and just general "I\'m a
Traveller fan" type stuff. (The first patch will probably be something
along the linse of the "Eye in Pyramid" logo but if we decide to do
patches, Traveller is an obvious and early candidate for heavy
representation).

How many of you would be interested in Traveller-related patches?
What would you be willing to pay?
What types of patches would you like to see us do?

We can\'t do dozens of designs at once, so we need to limit ourselves to the
more popular ones, and we will need to charge enough so we don\'t lose money
selling them.

	I\'m not entirely sure what you\'re asking.  Do you want an explanation 
of FT rules or a handwave to justify cheaper travel in the Imperial core?

	The passenger ticket prices in FT are accurate reflections of the cost 
of moving people from one place to another.  If you look at the numbers, 
you\'ll see that they come straight out of the cargo figures.  High 
passengers take up a 4dton stateroom and get 1dton of baggage allowance.  
5dtons of freight cost 650*5=3250Cr.  Throw in a little extra for food, 
stewards, etc. and 3500Cr/parsec is perfectly reasonable.  Liners are a 
little more expensive, but if you can at all afford it it\'s worth it 
considering you may be spending several weeks aboard.
	As I said, I\'m not sure how to interpret your question about the 
fringes.  If you mean the +4 bonus on final ticket price when no trade route 
exists there\'s a very simple economic explanation.  Liners don\'t go to that 
destination and very few ships of any sort go there -- that\'s why we say 
there\'s no trade route.  Getting a full load of freight and passengers for 
such a destination can be difficult and once there it can be even harder to 
get a full ship for the trip out.  Not to mention the fact that Frontier 
worlds are poorly patrolled and are therefore much more dangerous.  Simply 
put, travelling to such worlds is risky and passengers must therefore pay a 
risk premium to the ship captain before he\'ll agree to make the trip.

I\'ve been doing sysadmin for too long...my first thought was:

"What are you patching and what version does it take it to? What OS and
version? What does it patch? Is mine broke? Do I really want to fix it?
What breaks when you add this patch?"

MEMEMEMEMEMEMEME!!! 

Pleeeeeeaaaaaasssssssseeeeeeee have a FT Beowulf patch out by May
19!!!!!!! 

I can go down to the surplus store and get some coveralls or a flight
suit and sew it on. That and a cap with the Scout Service patch would
make it perfect for camping out in line for tickets!!!

Ian...can you call Ditzie and have her pay them a visit if they dont?

 I\'d like to request that the OT: RPG Paranoia subject lines be

Well; I hate to start a flame; but look at the title: RPG Paranoia. Traveller 
is a RPG, and I for one, am rightly concerned about the backlash against 
RPG\'s in wake of the Colorado shooting. I think it is pertinent to talk about 
it, if for nothing else than to help figure out how to combat the 
game-banners. Where I live for example (Las Vegas); one high school (Green 
Valley High) has already resorted to confiscating black trenchcoats, and 
banning the wearing of black "Goth" clothing. It hits home and I DON\'T like 
it. It\'s only a small stretch for these people to extend this to the computer 
wargame Doom, and from there to all wargames, like Traveller.

I\'d like to see a black patch with a red border, bearing the classic red
"Traveller" logo, and with (and I know this is semi-heretical) the "GURPS"
logo placed such that it does not overpower the Traveller logo visually.
Actually, I\'d be keen on the patch not saying "GURPS" on it at all, as
that might increase it\'s appeal to non-GURPS Traveller fans, and increase
sales.

Next I\'d want to see a classic Imperial Sunburst patch, with no text on it
at all. That would be a great patch for fans to wear in any fashion, but
would also be usefull for creating Imperial Uniforms for any service.

After that, more specific patches, such as Scout and other services...

$10, but I wouldn\'t buy a poor quality patch, no matter how inexpensive it
was.

Any chance of a TML discount?   ;)

Chill, Chill Seth. Don\'t get to upset. Read the original mail again. He was not
saying that RPG Paranoia was a bas subject heading or that we shouldn\'t discuss
that. All he wanted was that subject heading be changed as the topic wandered of
form RPG Paranoia stuff to Varg Children or High School introduction games. 

I agree with the original poster that sometimes we should more often change the
subjectfield as the topics split and wander off as the discussion goes on. That
way it becomes easier to follow the threads. Nothing more nothing less. I forget
this my self a lot and it iritates me that I\'m not more careful before hitting
the send-button.

With high regards

Very true. Unfortunately none of the people in the debate, whichever side
of the argument they favor, are able to come up with a reason why it
shouldn\'t be possible to design drop tanks to be reusable. So we generally
interpret the comment that drop tanks are one use to mean that since the
ship can\'t carry them along with them, they are one use _for the ship_,
but can be reused back in the original system.

Larger ships are more economic to run.

There are canonical examples of Imperial worlds leaving (or being abandoned

I don\'t think he was saying it was off-topic and we shouldn\'t talk about it,
he was just asking us to change the subject header to better reflect the
content of the message. Rob Prior, for example, brought up the idea of a
beginner scenario. Others are talking about their own personal experiences.
Others are talking about the backlash against games of all sorts.

I know what you\'re saying. For reasons which I\'ve explained at great length,
it really hits home to me, specifically. Those kids and I share a *huge*
number of similarities which are quickly becoming "warning signs" according
to the pop-psychologists and media. Of course, the real problem which leads
kids to an ultraviolent response is not what they\'ve ingested in the way of
movies and games, but what they\'ve endured in the way of teasings and
beatings. The real reasons will not be addressed, and after all of the
bannings and all of the new rules and restrictions in high schools, there\'s
probably going to be another heartbreaking tragedy like this. That\'s
unnacceptable.

Darrian has always been the atypical example. The thing is, we do know
how big a _percentage_ of Darrian\'s population that survived the MAGHIZ
(20%). And we know how big the population is in 1100 (between 15 and 24
billion. So I wanted them to have a small a population as possible, in
order to give them some room for population expansion in the 2000 years
between the two dates.

A reissue of the Duke\'s Own Huscarles patch would be cool (4518th Lift 
Infantry \'Strike From Space\'), if possible...

It was my understanding that real-world, modern main battle 
tanks (M1A1, T-80, and the like) mount main guns in the 100mm 
and up range in order to get a good chance of penetrating the
armor of opposing tanks.

Does the A-10 use it\'s 30mm gun on MBTs successfully? How?
Hitting thinner deck armor? Blowing off reactive armor and 
then punching through a lighter layer underneath? Damaging 
external features and breaking treads to the point where
the target is mission-killed, without ever penetrating? 
Simply throwing enough projectiles at the target to give a 
fair chance of a Golden BB/critical hit? 

Or does the A-10 have to use missile ordnance on MBTs?

I can envision the 30mm shredding the armor of APCs, light
tanks, and other sub-MBT targets pretty easily, but I\'m
just having trouble reconciling things, here.

Hey, Seth, I\'m on your side.  I wrote the original post, and have 
included its content above, so that you can see that all I\'m asking 
for is a change in subject -LINES-, not subjects.  All of the topics 
are of interest to me, but they are getting harder to follow while 
they\'re under the same subject heading.  Just a personal preference 
on organization; keep that content coming.  I apologize that the 
topic of my message did not specify subject -LINES-, and have 
corrected that in my subject above.

I grew up in the buckle of the Bible belt, so I know where you are 
coming from.  Thanks, Seth, for standing up for what you believe in.  
Now, let\'s get back to the topics at hand.  :)

Your Friend,
Jason

You didn\'t specify which TL, so I\'m assuming 10 or 12, since it\'s for a CT
conversion.  If you need TL9, let me know...  (I also have this in Excel 97
format.  If anyone wants that, let me know.)

	Considering the power generation of a Traveller

	to heat up tender extremities such as human hands.
	I tend to assume that the plasma is highly

_micrograms_ of hydrogen fusing is enough to produce 250 MW) stops dead
the moment you bust the accuum in the containment chamber, since the air
instantly cools and dilutes the plasma, whcih turns back into ordinary
hydrogen.

Now, if the containment is such that the reactor \'core\' can be opened up
_without_ killing the reaction, then the PC gets blinded and burned by
the energy from the fusion reaction. Sort of like looking right at a
(very, VERY) small star.

PGMP-13\'s do their damage via magical handwavium plasma, or artifically
generated lightning.

They heat a great deal more matter to high temps than a fusion reactor
does; fusion guns do so AND start initiating fusion a little bit.

They are, in fact, much harder to swallow than fusion reactors...they\'re
there because we need \'blasters\'...

Think of a PGMP or FGMP as being somewhere between a controlled fusion
reaction (a power reactor) and an uncontrolled one (thermonuclear bomb),
big differences between the two extremes.

Mainly because it fires a shell which is depleted uranium.  Because the
round is so dense, it penetrates much more armor.

But there will be worlds in an adjacent subsector in the next sector?

Hmm.

Worlds like Vincennes are likely to have trade from at least a sector away

You can also kill th ereactor if the control rods fail by flooding it with
a material like boron which kills the reaction by inhibiting neutron
motion.

Gas cooled reactors like the AGR have loads of small pellets which are
blown in IIRC.

Not sure about those PWRs you Americans are so fond of ;-)

The Depleted Uranium 30mm rounds of the A-10\'s main gun ("GAU-8 Avenger")
are capable of penetrating the side and rear armor of almost any vehicle.
It (probably, under most circumstances) cannot penetrate the frontal or
turret front armor of MBTs which, as you point out, is made to face other
MBTs with their 120mm main guns.

The number of rounds fired and the high velocity of the round make
penetration over time more likely than if it were a one-shot weapon.

The length of the gun barrel is responsible for increased velocity over,
say, the 30mm gun on an AH-64 Apache helo.

see http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/equip/gau-8.htm for immense
amounts of detail.

>Or does the A-10 have to use missile ordnance on MBTs?

The Maverick missile delivers a 125lb shaped or 300lb delayed fuse warhead
(for use against ships, I think) up to (in theory) 17 miles.  It uses "TV
Guidance" which means a computer memorizes the shape of the target when the
pilot pulls a trigger with the target in the crosshairs, then the missile
follows that image down to the impact point.

In general, the gun is for softer targets while the missiles are used for
heavier targets, mostly because the tanks are generally protected by
anti-air assets, and the missiles allow "stand off" attacks.  Anyone who
ever played "A-10 Tank Buster" knows how hard it is to keep that gun
trained when someone is shooting at you.

Something to remember, however, in the "undefended" airspace like Iraq, is
that the Mavericks cost about $125,000 each while the GAU-8 rounds are
certainly much less for a comparable burst.

A-10s also often carry other weapons like cluster bombs and laser guided or
unguided "iron bombs".

Obtrav:  The Ramparts need pylons or weapon bays (small ones) if they are
going to carry cheap expendibles for the Close Air Support mission; or do
they just blast every target with lasers?

The 30mm gun fires DU ammo, and being above lets the pilot target the
thinner top armor of the tank (especially the armor over the engine).

A-10s also carry AGM-65 Maverick missiles for tank killing, and in the Gulf
the crews came up with a poor\'s man\'s FLIR by using the night sight on the
missile to route information to the pilot.

Having seen A-10s in action, my best guess is that they scare the targets
to death.

	Since such a small proportion of the population survived the Maghiz, 
we could make the pre-Maghiz population virtually anything we wanted.  I\'m 
not overly concerned with population growth in the intervening 2000 years 
because there\'s no need for it to have been particularly large.  
	Net of immigration, the populations of most of the developed world, 
including the US and Japan, are actually _declining_.  Or more accurately, 
if current trends continue they will begin to decline when kids being born 
today have reached their child-bearing years.  
	In any case, the Darrians could actually have had a bigger population 
pre-Maghiz than circa-1100.  After all, they had more colony worlds then, 
didn\'t they?

Also, the ROF of that 30 mm gun is a LOT higher than the 100 mm main gun of an MBT.  All else fails, the A10 can *CHEW* its way through.

Traveller character generation starts a lot of PCs out at ages 34, 38,
42, 46 -- I have to believe that some of them have families.  It\'s an
issue that I raise when I\'m having a player generate a character.  

So Jane Mercenary, ex-Marine Commando FcCmdr, 6 terms, has obtained some
heavy hardware. She doesn\'t carry it all with her while she\'s
gallivanting around the sector solving other people\'s problems, and her
very intelligent and technically astute children, who haven\'t seen her,
much less gotten any positive attention from her, in months, in two
years, have figured out how to unlock the weapons locker and power up
the PGMP-13.  The problem is, none of them can fit into mom\'s battle
dress -- so they decide to build a pintel mount for it on the family\'s
grav SUV.  Jesedipere Diplomatic High School, look out!

Striker provides a good discussion of the Imperial rules of war.  It
contains the often seen statement:

"[O]ne prohibition is clear and firm throughout the Imperium: use or
possession of nuclear weapons, if discovered, and regardless of their
size or type, will almost certainly trigger Imperial intervention.  The
Imperium alone retains the rights to such weapons, because of their
extreme destructive powers and the relatively low tech level at which
they can be manufactured."

Striker, Book 2, Rule 78, at 44; see Supplement 11, Library Data N-Z, at
30-31 (same).

That statement must be taken in context, however.  The Imperium allows
warfare among its members as a safety valve to release tensions that
cannot be resolved through mediation. It has developed certain rules to
govern such warfare so as to protect Imperial stability.  These rules
remain uncodified so that they will not develop any precedential value
that could limit Imperial power to intervene whenever it deems it
necessary.  

The sources of instability are long-term economic dislocation and
excessive extra-planetary influence.  Thus the rules of war prohibit
extensive destruction of the infrastructure and eradication of civilian
populations, as well as attempts by off-world governments or commercial
interests to seize control of worlds.  

This is the context of the prohibition on nuclear weapons:  The
regulation of warfare on member states, not in space.  They invariably
destroy infrastructure and civilian populations, and are easy to make,
so must be prohibited in war between Imperial member states.  

The Imperial rules of war don\'t address raiding of interstellar
commerce, because that\'s already prohibited as piracy.  Nor do the rules
address warfare in space between fleets of warring member states. 
That\'s already prohibited as contrary to naval security -- after all,
each member\'s naval forces are nominally part of the Imperial Navy.  So
member states\' warships may possess nuclear weapons (indeed, they must,
as part of the IN).  

Imperial member states are not prohibited from possessing nuclear
weapons -- they\'re just prohibited from using them in conflicts with
other member states.  If they\'re attacked by a foreigner, why would they
be prohibited from having or using nuclear weapons?  

Possession of nuclear missiles by civilian ships that get involved in
supporting a ground war will trigger Imperial intervention, obviously. 
In the absence of the context in which the rules of war apply, however,
the Imperium doesn\'t prohibit civilian ships -- or anyone else -- from
possessing nuclear missiles.  (Member states may have different rules,
of course -- it\'s unlikely that even a law level 1 world will allow
private possession of nuclear weapons.)

Come on, even a "hard" science fiction game like Traveller needs some
fiction.  This would just be role-playing real life.

Ob my high school experiences:  My friend Steve and I were once assigned
to move a bunch of videotapes from a classroom to the room in the
building that had the most even and cool temperature -- the principal\'s
bathroom.  He had a flare gun and a small caliber semi-auto rifle in
there, just in case we students got out of hand, I suppose.

Of course (Querion subsector has many examples), but settlements to
resolve a war do not constitute secession, which is the voluntary
withdrawal of one state from a group of states.

We had a discussion about this a few weeks ago.  I think it\'s a great
idea.  I love patches, and will buy a lot of them if they\'re well-done
(and SJG\'s quality control is very good) and not too expensive.  Can you
keep them under $3? under $5?

The Imperial sunburst would be my first choice of a patch, especially
the classic black-and-red color scheme.  

I\'d also buy:

4518th Lift Infantry
Free Trader Beowulf
Scout service patches, for example from World Builder\'s Handbook
(and probably anything else you put on the market)

A few travel patches would be cool, too.  You know what I mean, like the
ones you put on your luggage that say "San Francisco, California" and
have a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge -- but these should of course
be "Fulacin/Rhylanor: I visited the Octagon House" or something like
that.

Also, please make some of the patches small enough to put on hats --
like 2 to 2.5 inch heights.  Maybe you could do some in different sizes
(like the Imperial sunburst)?

Thanks,

*snide answer*: no quantity of water.  Water doesn\'t contain liquid hydrogen,
it contains hydrogen locked in a covalent bond with oxygen.
*more helpful answer*: by weight, water (H20) is 1 part hydrogen to 8 parts
water, and is 1 metric ton per cubic mere, which means there are 110 kilograms
of hydrogen.  One m^3 of LH2 is 70 kilograms, so you need 140 * (70/110) cubic
meters of water, or about 90 cubic meres.

All of the above, and then some.  First of all, it does throw a lot of
projectiles (1800/minute), ensuring multiple hits.  Next, since the rounds
come from an airplane, *hopefully* they will be arriving from above the
target, thus striking the more vulnerable top armor- and if the pilot is
doing his job, also probably hitting from the side/rear.

That is the usual practice, however the gun will kill most tanks- certainly
older T-72s and anything in the West without Chobham-type armor.

Well, even though the gun is only 30mm, it has several advantages.  First of
all, the REST muzzle velocity is 1067m/ second.  To this we can add the
A-10s velocity of around 150m/s.  Not bad, as the main gun (120mm) of the
Abrams is only putting out ~1600m/s, and has to (usually) go through the
front armor.  Also, the size differential isn\'t as large as it seems.  The
120mm actually fires a sub-calibre penetrator- actual diameter classified,
but of course, easily obtainable on the net.  As the 30mm doesn\'t use a
sabot, I suspect actual diameter at target is similar.  While I have reason
to believe that the 120mm penetrator weighs more, keep in mind it is
designed to, if necessary, penetrate any portion of the target\'s armor.
A final note, I saw training films several times that showed 30mm rounds
perforating the side turret armor of M-48A1s (therefor, around 3-4 of
case-hardened steel) and continueing through the other side in the thinner
regions.  Still photos from the Gulf showed multiple penetrations over every
facet of T-55 armor.  Also, the M-1 proved resistant to complete penetration
over the front and side aspects (can we say, "friendly fire?").  Note that
the above is only partially anecdotal, a friend brought back pictured from
his time with 1st Cav.

Hi, the A-10\'s cannon can fire at rates of up to 4200 rpm and the aircraft
can carry up to 16 000 lb of ordinance on one fuselage and ten wing pylons
(at least that\'s what Janes says).

I\'m in total agreement with Andrew here.  Frankly, I haven\'t seen
the cover binding problem that others have mentioned, and although
there has been some errata it hasn\'t been bad.

>I don\'t like the GURPS system (just a matter of personal taste, I\'m

There are things I don\'t like about the GURPS implementation of
Traveller.  Specifically, I want a Traveller style career system for
Character Generation, a Task Level system, TL\'s (not GTL\'s) and
UWP\'s.  GT doesn\'t give me that, but it doesn\'t make it hard for me
to graft them onto the rest of its system, either.

Good things.  The background and source material is good for any
Traveller campaign.  The integration of all the GURPS books gives
you a lot of flexibility.  Vehicles is good and includes weapon
construction rules, I\'m not sure I don\'t like FFS better, though.
The ship building rules in GT remind me of what we were going for
with QSDS and SDS, not perfect, but well done.  I haven\'t used the
Ship Combat rules yet (I prefer more roleplaying there), but they
look sound.  Far Trader may or may not be perfect (depending on who
you listen to here on the list ;), but either way it does contain a
huge amount of good information for any campaign where merchants and
trade will be involved.

Overall, I think the GT material has kept the "Traveller feel", has
been of good quality and excellent utility.

>I\'d give GT a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.

I think I\'d give GT a B+.  If First In is "first rate" I might boost
that grade up to an A-

however ...

The firing rate obtainable on a test stand is rarely
the rate that any weapon fires in the field.  Due to
the potential for jamming, the GAU-8 usually fires
at the lower rate of 300 rounds per minute.  And, more
often then not just fires a seven round burst.  (One
quick squeeze of the trigger.)

If the hog pilot has to chew through armor, he deserves
to be shot down.  The airplane is agile enough that he
can choose which side to attack.

Don\'t expect the rounds for the A-10 to bounce around
the interior.  Either the round will completely pass
through the vehicle or it will encounter enough mass to
vaporize the round.  [30mm DU is not explosive, but 
vaporized armor and depleted uranium is enough to flash
fry the crew and usually cook off the ammo stored inside.]
That\'s why most tanks seem to explode when shot by an
A-10.

30mm DU rounds are similar to sabot rounds in that they
have a penetrator and a sleeve.  The sleeve is a wide
band of common steel and the silvery tip is just an 
aluminum \'wind screen\' to make the round more aerodynamic.

    No, it isn\'t to be honest with you, they have not put in the annoying

Still, that\'s 5 rounds per *SECOND*.  A nice set of teeth to chew with.

True, but the option is still there.  *MANY* 30mm slugs hitting something will 
burst through when a 100mm shell won\'t.

I don\'t expect it to.  Cooking off the ammo is quite sufficient, thank you.  
Especially when that cooked ammo turns into shrapnel.

And they can *STILL* chew through armor.

Maybe subdued versions should be gray and black.  Green is a color of
the Terran landscape.  Gray and black will work in most urban, starport,
and shipboard environments.

Vargr entrepeneur to customer:  "But hunter\'s orange and electric blue
_is_ the subdued version."

(That\'s sort an in-joke for alumni of Boise State University, whose
colors until recently were almost neon hunter\'s orange and electric blue
(you should\'ve seen the stadium in the 1970s and \'80s).  The colors are
a little muted now.)

I also wanted to note that the recoil from that gun tends to stall the
plane.  Thus you don\'t really want to fire too many rounds at a time.

MST3K???

As to City\'s reporting, I\'ve been present at too many events that they\'ve

After a couple of hours, it just struck me.  Take a cue from another
part
of this thread:  Treat them like adults.

I\'ve introduced two of my nephew\'s (and some of their friends to
Traveller 
with 
"Across the Bright Face."  It does have a nice cinamagraphic (is that
a word?) intro, and dumps the players into a rather nasty situation.

As I side note, one of my nephews ran through a bit I hacked up from
memory out of an old issue of High Passage involving methane deposits,
mineral
rights and a deal which goes sour.  I\'ve run this thing about 4 or 5
times,
and his group was the only ones who was able to talk his way out of it.

The injection of high density cold water can indeed result in more neutrons
adding to the chain reaction. In a loss of coolant accident rods are first
inserted and then emergency cooling water is injected.  In some designs this
water is doped with a neutron absorbing rare earth. After this mixture is
injected the reactor is essentially unrepairable as the mixture coats
everything.

Clancy is describing the result of an uncontrolled introduction of cold
seawater into an operating reactor.

The ones I\'d be most interested in getting are:

- - The Imperial Sunburst, in the classic yellow-on-black
- - Imperial Navy
- - The Solomani Confederation -- some kind of "official" logo

That\'s good to hear. I ordered mine a month ago, knowing that they were

having them sell out first. :)

I\'ll be watching my mailbox...

About $5 or $6 is what most sci-fi patches go for.

I\'m just wondering what they consider "Goth" clothing. All black clothing,

I don\'t like it either, but after a period of time it will pass. I\'ve been 
gaming since my first year of university, 20 years ago, and I\'ve seen anti-
game hysteria come and go before. Those who believe the hysteria generally 
can\'t be swayed by reason. Their minds are already made up, and the events
just fit their facts. But eventually, their attention will divert to something
else.

I agree with you -- it would be nice to see new sectors published.
However, Trojan Reaches is right next door to the Spinward Marches. I\'d
prefer to see a sector in an area of the Imperium that hasn\'t been heavily
investigated before. I was thinking of the sectors on the trailing frontier
of the Imperium -- Delphi, or the Glimmerdrift Reaches.

I\'d also like to see the GT version of the Solomani Rim sector, perhaps
as part of a larger book on the Solomani Confederation.

The problem is that schools want to foster conformity. It\'s part of their
job. Homogeneous students are easier to teach. They do not get into trouble.
Jocks are treated better because they feed the needs of the parents in
regards to competition and winning for the old school. The "normal" kids are
the ones who adults see as copies of themselves.
Strangely enough this is a relatively recent occurrence. The creation of
peer groups among kids is a result of the American (and other western
patterned) school systems that lump children together by age.  This practice
is less than 150 years old. It results in what is in reality a separate
social system from the adult social groups.  These social groups are
completely independent, and no adult can really understand what happens in
them.  They tend to have certain characteristics that remain the same from
year to year. The jock phenomenon, for example, which is sustained because
jocks are rewarded with special privileges by adults. And the uncool kid
group, because the members of this group often are ignored by adults and
weaker than the jocks. Because the jocks have been taught that physical
prowess and winning is the most important thing it is alright to terrorize
the uncool kids.  Adults also give them short shift, because they cause
friction by their very existence, aren\'t athletic and make them feel
uncomfortable, due to their nonconformity.

Mystery Science Theater 3000. What I want to know is, if CITY is able
to play them, then why does the Space web site say they *can\'t*???

Note to those of you south of the border: CITY-TV is a Toronto independent
broadcast tv station which also owns two radio stations in Toronto (AM and
FM),
an independent tv station in Barrie (60 miles north of Toronto), and a few 
specialty cable networks, including Space (a SF channel) and MuchMusic (rock 
videos). Space\'s website (www.spacecast.com), the FAQ explains that they can\'t
get MST3K for broadcast because not only would they have to get the rights 
to the MST3K episodes themselves (easy to do), they\'d *also* have to get
the rights to broadcast the movies which the episode contain (much more
difficult to do)! At least there\'s some hope: several MST3K episodes are
available on video, and a video store not far from where I live carries
them.

And for those of you not familiar with MST3K to begin with: it\'s a show
on the Sci-Fi channel in the US which is essentially a vehicle for showing
really bad movies (mostly bad SF B-movies) -- this guy is imprisoned aboard
a space station with a few robots, and they\'re forced to watch bad movies.
They provide a running commentary on the movie as it screens (you can see
their silhouettes in the bottom corner of the screen), and sometimes it\'s
side-splittingly funny.

Apologies for the off-topic diversion.

The main reasons for aircraft drop tanks being single use are:
1) Early (WWII) ones were made of aluminised cardboard or plywood;
2) They don\'t tend to stay in one piece after falling c.20,000 ft and
bouncing <g>
3) they\'re often dropped over the sea or enemy territory, making
recovery...errr...*interesting* <g>

Err.  Wrong.  There is a T-80 (better suspension and fire control).  There\'s 
a T-90 now, too, though both of em, IMO, are yet more pieces of trash and the

LOL.  I doubt it\'s classified.  Any ol ammo tech type would be able to tell 
u.  I\'ve never measured one, but it\'s probably bout 3 or 4 inches thick.

A 120mm MPAT (or the foreign equivalent) will destroy an A10 or anything else 
in the air.  If the A10 is going against a modern MBT, he\'s going to want to 
use his mavericks.  That\'s what they\'re there for.  Anything else is starting 
to get risky.

At the moment, it\'s simply black clothing. After all, *good* people don\'t
wear black clothes... unless it\'s a tasteful black evening dress or tuxedo
(each on the appropriate sex of course).

It must really be dependent on your location. Besides, what people
*remember* and the hardcore anti-gamers are two different things. The
hardcore anti-gamers are almost always religious zealots who miss the point
all across the board. The people who half-remember the news reports and the
nasty rumors are usually just normal people. You happen across them when you
least expect to.

It will *pass* from public scrutiny, but (from my own experience) it will
not pass from public memory. Your own mileage may vary, of course.

 I also wanted to note that the recoil from that gun tends to stall the
 plane.  Thus you don\'t really want to fire too many rounds at a time.

Did you seriously mean to imply that an A-10 could maintain a sustained

an ex-grunt who use to watch A-10s from the ground. I always thought those

The Libertad is a unique weapon. It is produced in a variety of small
workshops on Jakob for the Ladian National Army (Ejercito Nacional de Ladia
or ENL) and is the closest this organisation comes to having a standard issue
weapon. Given the circumstances of it\'s manufacture, most examples show a
suprising degree of craftmanship and reliablity. The weapon itself is a
rather unusual design. Instead of using a convential magazine, it utilises
the same principle as handgun revolvers. The Libertad is a single action
revolver with a six chambered cylinder and a conventional wooden stock. The
Libertad normally uses a preloaded paper cartridge containing both the
conical lead bullet and blackpowder charge, but it can also be loaded with
loose powder if neccessary. The cylinder can be removed and replaced with a
preloaded one in a matter of seconds and most users will carry several such
cylinders. If neccessary, it takes a trained user about 2 to 4 seconds to
reload an individual chamber under combat conditions. Despite the
circumstances of its production, the Libertad has found a ready market with
collectors off Jakob and several companies now produce copies under licence
from the ENL (the ENL uses the licence fees to purchase more advanced
weapons to be smuggled on to Jakob).

    'body' => 'Gentlemen, 

You both responded to my plea for attention earlier so if you do not mind I 
though I would use your inquiry as a platform for launching yet another 
attempt to attract players. :) 

Would either of you be interested in playing the Sworld Worlders in GURPS 
Traveller pbem campaign set in the period featured in the alternate GURPS 
timeline where the Emperor is not assassinated rather than the T4 game? My 
story concept is focused on the feeling of the Sword Worlders that they need 
to expand toward unexplored space (spinward of the Marches) or be totally 
swallowed by the Third Imperium. I am cultivating a play environment where 
the Imperium is limited in what it can do militarily in the Sword Worlds 
region by the expansion of Aslan Hatei into District 268 and the Darrian 
Subsector. The campaign would be ripe for all sorts of military, economic, 
and political play. But I have honestly failed to get commentment from any of 
the online players to play. My two candidates for the Sword Worlds have not 
shown any interest since the initial contacts. 

One of the reasons I am pushing the use of GURPS TRAVELLER (GT) for this 
project is the awesome shareware support coming from Steve Jackson Games. 
There is a young man who is generating nice shareware for the system. He has 
created a character creator, starship builder, and astrogation (in the 
Traveller format) that will certainly enhance this campaign if I can get it 
organized. If I can get a cadre of committed quality players, with the use of 
this software I can provide a very enjoyable game. 

My concept of play is based on over 10 years of pbm experience. I am not 
trying to create a play situation of real-time interaction between the 
players and referee as found in "sims" or AOL chat rooms. Rather I am trying 
to create a near "wargaming" experience as discussed in T4\'s Pocket Empires, 
but using characters rather than militiary pieces! 

Play is done through the use of characters created my the players placed in 
strategic locations in the play environment. The characters then act as 
conduits of information fed to the player by the referee. The nature and 
accurracy of the information is based on the characters\' profile and 
attributes. Then the player acts through those characters as agents to 
influence the play environment.  

A friend of mine and I have used this format many times successfully playing 
Star Trek pbems over many years. For example, say a player controls a 
starship captain...it therefore follows that the referee will award that 
"character" a starship to use in the campaign. The referee then provides the 
player information based on the location and declared activities of the 
captain character. Say the player has placed the captain in his ship in orbit 
over a strategic planet. The player then receives information on the current 
situation of that planet based on the capabilities of the captain\'s ship. The 
player then acts on that information. Let\'s assume the player wants to 
establish a presence on the planet. So he orders his ship to land and to 
contact the native government or apparent power in charge. The referee then 
makes an assessment of the captain character\'s attributes and skills related 
to this task, and then considers any other aspects of the ship or crew that 
would modify the task in the favor of the character. Then based on these 
factors, determines the success or failure of the task and reports the 
results of the task attempt to the player. The player then uses this 
information to either ask further questions about that situation, deverts 
other resources from his network of characters, or abandons that task in 
favor of another. Combat (this is Traveller after all!) will be handled using 
existing campaign rules from the Gurps Compendium 2, and the new Gurps 
Traveller books coming out (specifically  
<A HREF="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/traveller/">GURPS Traveller</A> 
StarMercs). 

The reason at this point I would prefer using the 1120 milieu rather than the 
Milieu 0 is because of the online support offered  
<A HREF="http://members.nova.org/~sol/core/">CORE</A> ,  
<A HREF="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/traveller/links.html">GURPS Traveller: 
Links
</A>  <A HREF="http://www.bits.org.uk/">BITS (British Isles Traveller 
Support) Homepages
</A>. There is literally nothing for the T4 system on line unfortunately. And 
if the 1120 milieu does not pan out, I would love to do the T4 game setting 
but it will require tons more work on my part.  

So if you gentlemen would consider playing in the milieu 1120 era I would 
greatly appreciate it.

I am a military professional: I have more than 17 years experience in the
US Army at all levels from Infantry private to Chief of Plans, US
Forces-Haiti, including two command tours (one in combat). I make it a
point to study the effect of combat on soldiers as part of my professional
military reading.

One inescapable conclusion is that it is very difficult to get most (98%)
people to kill their fellow man, even when they or their loved ones are
directly threatened. Random, "suppressive" fire is much more common, as is
"shooting to wound". Getting them to kill on command, when there may not be
any threat present, is even more difficult and requires weeks of careful
indoctrination in a new recruit. 

The process (suggested by S.L.A. Marshall in his _Men_Against_Fire_, and
inplemented in all major armies since WWII) involves operant conditioning:
targets on a rifle range are presented in random order, at random ranges,
for a few seconds each. The object is to shoot the target while it is up; a
hit results in the target falling. Success at the range results in rewards
- -- marksmanship badges, praise, passes -- while failure results in
retraining and heavy social pressure. This is an extremely powerful and
successful technique. Soldiers who have been trained in this system report
that killing enemy soldiers in combat becomes "just like the range": a
target appears, they shoot, the target disappears.

One author (Grossman?, _On_Killing_ -- I\'ve lent my copy out) points out in
detail the similarities between first-person shooter video games (like
Doom) and the conditioning of soldiers. Targets appear at random, are shot
with a variety of weapons, and disappear in a shower of blood and gore (one
up on the rifle range!) -- over and over and over. Rewards are present in
the form of score-keeping and access to greater levels of difficulty;
failure results in "death". He suggests that we are, in some sense,
conditioning our children to kill.

I do not know whether the individuals who carried out the attack in
Littleton were avid Doom players, or whether they fell into the 2% of the
population that does not need indoctrination in order to kill (these are
not all bad, by any means -- many police officers and highly regarded
soldiers also fall into this group). But I submit that we should be very
careful as a group how we present ourselves, and consider carefully whether
we want pencil-and-paper roleplaying games associated with first-person
shooter video games in the public eye.

So the ban is on black clothing of any kind, then? Wow. I have neither a 
tuxedo nor a tasteful black evening dress. But a very large percentage of 
my clothing is black. For example, the only pants that I have that aren\'t 
black are blue jeans, which I can\'t wear at work (except on Fridays)... 
It was more or less the same when I was at school, to the point that when
I once showed up in a very colourful sweater (blues and reds and yellows),
I created a bit of a sensation. ("Hey, look! Glenn\'s wearing *colour*!")

I wear black (and grey) because I have no sense of fashion when it comes
to colour combination -- I would see nothing wrong with brown pants and
a blue shirt, for example. (Besides, grey is a good colour for me.) But
I have to wonder, in school I knew someone who wore black every day for
religious reasons (one of the conservative Christian sects related to 
the Amish and Mennonites). How would your school handle that? :)

Yes, but there are few enough of them that they can ususally be ignored.

Of course. But it will be pushed back into the back of public memory. There
was a similar feeding frenzy in the media many years ago when D&D was linked
to a suicide. (You may remember the incident, June 1992, Irving Lee Pulling.
His mother, the late Pat Pulling, made a career of anti-gaming hysteria.)
At the time, I was a university student and regular AD&D player... The
Littleton incident will be remembered, but the link between the killers and
gaming will fade over time.

        Hi, Brannon!  

        *WARNING* If you play in my TNEC PBEM, you might want to skip this
message....

        Yes, in fact the area to the "north" of the Terran Sphere in my TNEC
milieu is actually "owned" by a Wiccan-like group who fled Terra during the
Coalition War.  The left as a result of what was essentially religious
persecution.  In the confusion of the CW, the ships they stole and thier
destination were completely forgotten, so the Terrans have no idea that
thier nearest neighbours are, well, Terrans.  The Coven are *very* aware of
where Terra is, however, and are more than just a little suspect of it given
the reasons they left.

        Having spoken to a few a Wiccans who are good friends of mine, I
decided to arbitrarily make the Coven psionic...  They haven\'t figured out
teleportation yet, but TK, empathy, etc.

Didn\'t someone propose that drop tanks are still connected, and pumping
LHyd, whle the jump bubble is forming and actually hang outside the jump
field? In this case the explosive bolts are only used when the ship
actually jumps,and the tanks are discarded into jump space.

IMTU, this means the only way tanks are reusable are if you can wait at the
jump point for each proton in the tank to reappear a week later, one at a
time.

I can tell you, without a doubt, that you will soon be seeing the Solomani

	I didn\'t say "frontiers," I said "Frontier worlds," in GT there\'s a 
difference :-) BtC established traffic classifications (Main, Feeder, 
Backwater, Frontier) which I then assigned trade route definitions to in FT.  
They are used to indicate the level of starship traffic in a system.  The 
Frontier classification refers to any world that does not get regularly 
scheduled commercial ship traffic.  I realize this can be confusing, which 
is why I capitalized the word "Frontier" to distiniguish the official GT 
classification from the simple noun.

Huh?  What do you mean by that?  I\'m *wearing* a blue shirt with
brown pants right now!  ;-> No, seriously!

Now *really* seriously...no one is going to ban black pants, nor
black coats, nor black shirts, nor even black trenchcoats.  The

Until someone does a validated study we are only going to be
conjecturing about this.  Such a study might look at the range
training records of both heavy FPK-game playing soldiers and
soldiers that don\'t have a history of playing the First Person
Killer games.  Of course, a better (from a scientific pov) study
would compare these group\'s reactions post actual combat.  But,
let\'s hope that data doesn\'t become available anytime soon.

IAC, until such a study indicates differently, I think almost all of
the heavy "Doom" players will have the same difficulty in shooting
to kill as the non-"Doom" players.  I certainly *hope* that\'s true,
but it worries me.

As you know, several court cases are trying to tie violent
television and film content to the commission of violent crimes.
There certainly is more *graphic* violence in the media now than a
generation ago, and children *are* exposed to many more hours of
this media, but does it change behavior?  

Some people will point out that there was a lot of violence on TV
and movies years ago.  However, almost all that violence was
non-graphic and highly unrealistic.  Tom and Jerry were always
bashing each other, the Coyote regularly was crushed, burned, blown
up and fell hundreds of feet, and on non-cartoon shows cowboys and
detectives killed villains left and right, but all this violence was
patently unrealistic.  Tom, Jerry and Coyote always bounced back
immediately and with no lasting damage.  The villains (good people
and bystanders almost never got hurt seriously) fell down dead with
no blood or other signs of injury, just as unrealistically as the
cartoons.  In the original Psycho, a movie that *really* did horrify
audiences in the early 60\'s, Hitchcock used music and images that
created fear and horror in his audiences\' minds without ever showing
images of the actual attack.  Compare that to a modern shocker like
Scream.

Violence in media today isn\'t especially realistic, but it *is* more
graphic and much less selective.  Victims are shown burning,
screaming, gasping for breath, blood gushing and spurting, limbs
being ripped off, faces being blown away, and the results aren\'t
kept off camera, they are shown in gory detail.  Our children are
soaking up thousands of hours of this stuff every year.

But, does the graphic depiction of violence translate to a greater
propensity for violence in the viewer?  Does it contribute to a
desensitization of the viewer toward violence?  

I don\'t know, I don\'t think anyone really *knows* the answers to
this.  I can\'t help worrying that we have conditioned a generation
of people desensitized to violence.  I can\'t but wonder if all of
this conditioning doesn\'t have an effect on a rare, and already
disturbed, child here and there. I can\'t help, but worry...

Damn straight!  

For my part, I *don\'t* connect the two.  In my games combat/violence
tends to occur rarely, because of its rarity it really does stand
out, but has never been the primary focus.  The primary focus tends
to be character interaction...not something the FPK games do at
all....exploration and creative/building pursuits.

All, IMO, of course,

That\'s the way I intend to play it.  Drop Tanks get dropped into
Jump Space, outside the bubble, at the moment of jump, and are thus
one time use only.  This makes them too expensive for routine
commercial use, but still available for specialty applications.

I meant, generally, Danny.  

Now, if you want an old foggy opinion...  School children should be
wearing school uniforms, there should be hair length and style
restrictions, and serious restrictions placed on cosmetics, jewlery
and other accesseries.  School is the student\'s *job* and they
should be conducting themselves like they will be expected to once

If the media embraces the roleplaying angle, then they will be associated
with first-person shooting games in the public eye. The fact remains that
there are many people who play tabletop roleplaying games who also play
first-person shooters. I can name at least half a dozen that I know
personally, and that\'s statistically significant in my roleplaying group.

The whole *attitude* of finger pointing is one that is disgusting. So far,
I\'ve heard that a general trend towards violence in the media is the reason
for the killings. I\'ve heard specifically that movies are responsible (after
all, who can forget the scene in "Basketball Diaries" where Leonardo
DiCaprio strides into a classroom with a shotgun and trenchcoat, blasting
his teacher and classmates). One movie that seems a frequent target is
Oliver Stone\'s "Natural Born Killers," which is strange because the movie is
extremely critical of the media\'s cavalier and casual attitude towards
violence. I\'ve heard that music is at fault. Fingers point in kneejerk
fashion at bands like KMFDM, Rammstein and Marilyn Manson. MSNBC at one
point asked how these kids were allowed to pursue an interest in World War
II history with throwing up a red flag for their parents and teachers! I kid
you not. I\'m not tainting this with my own spin. My jaw actually dropped.
Others say guns are at fault, because after all, if they only had access to
hatchets and knives, they would not have been able to kill so many people.
Still others will call the internet into question. No one can deny that bomb
recipes exist on the world wide web. Should the tabletop roleplayers of the
world distance themselves from the internet? Should we disband the TML?

Every school shooter that has ripped apart communities across this country
hasn\'t played tabletop RPGs. All of them did not play Doom or Quake. Not all
of them dressed in black trenchcoats. They don\'t seem to share the same
taste in music or film. Not all of them are avid World War II buffs. What is
the common denominator here? In case after case, we hear *from other
students* that these children were teased and ostracized by their classmates
for a variety of reasons.

That alone does not indicate a cause-effect relationship, I agree. However,
it\'s a start, and to the best of my knowledge, it\'s the only *real* common
denominator in these high-school shootings. I\'ve seen too much finger
pointing and distancing already as a result of tragedy. Decide for yourself.
Does the buck stop here and now, or do we keep passing it around, smiling
uneasily all the while, hoping that our "special" hobby doesn\'t come under
heavy fire again? Or do we distance ourselves from the first person-shooter
genre of video games and *by association* the people involved?

Think about it. I\'ve seen a number of people on this list talk about their
interest in the popular Macintosh FPS Marathon. I\'ve heard folks mention
that they play Half-Life and Quake II.

Turn the situation around for a moment. Roleplaying is a powerful tool for
indoctrination. Church groups use it. Schools use it. Cults use it. Fast
food restaurants use it. Although I\'m unaware of any books written on the
subject, it\'s true. It was the connection with the  sort roleplaying that
psychologists use that helped to give roleplaying games such a bad name!

So, should we allow this event to fracture us as a group, and foster even
more distrust? Where does it stop? Do we distance ourselves from the hobby
of recreational shooting, which I suspect more than a few gamers indulge in?
C\'mon, some shooting competitions involve the exact same kind of thing that
you\'re talking about.

Where does it end? The WWII history buffs, with their talk of Shermans,
Panzerschrecks and amphibious landings might be next. Maybe fans of music
with fast, hard beats could be next...

I know what you mean - but it is an instance of the desire to \'do something

problems.  If it didn\'t involve people getting killed, it would be funny.

I dunno. I\'m a great fan of the computer game "Grand Theft Auto", which
I\'ve had almost since it became available for the PC. On the other hand,
in real life, I have nearly 20 years of driving experience, without so
much as a single traffic ticket in all that time.

It\'s been tried before, more than once -- and every time, that defence
gets shot down in flames. As it should be. The media has always been
a convenient scapegoat. Think back to the early days of rock-and-roll
music, over 40 years ago, and how that was going to destroy the minds
of the youth...

I know that it\'s amazingly off-topic, but I have a question about this and
I\'ve never gotten the opportunity to ask someone who was in your camp. What
is supposed to be accomplished by a dress code, exactly? I ask this mainly
because *all* of the schools I went to had a strict dress code which seemed
to accomplish absolutely nothing. Is there something I was missing about the
concept?

As far as restrictions on hair length and style... well, I\'m biased on that
one as I fought hard for three years against them at my high school.

Duh. Of course it does. Children learn by watching and imitating. Granted,
they do not see mom and dad shooting people, but if mom and dad watch the
same stuff along with them, and do not seem to think there is anything
wrong with what is presented...

Not mine. They watch zero TV at home, and ocassionally get to watch
children\'s cable shows at their grandma\'s hhouse (which I still don\'t
really like). They\'re perfectly well adjusted and happy kids, and their
lives don\'t revolve around worshipping the TV every afternoon.

My kids are two 8 year olds (twin girls) and one 4 year old boy.

YMMV.

Again, duh.

I don\'t absolutely *know* that a ball will drop to the floor when I
release it, but I can make a good guess based on common sense.

I worry that we\'re getting a much higher percentage of disturbed kids out
of a generation raised on television and videogames instead of parental
attention and real play. I don\'t think you can point your finger at DOOM
and say "That put him over the edge." It was just the last straw out of
the countless violent stimuli that the kid was exposed to over the course
of his life. You couldn\'t blame one out of the lot, but as a whole, they
certainly contributed.

Granted, some people are just nuts right out of the gate, and some people
will get cancer even if they never smoke. But you can lower your risk of
both by controling what you are exposed to.

I have really never enjoyed shooter-games much, and I\'ve been a gamer for
20 years. The two are not linked in my perception.

I completely agree. My focus is on character development also.

Now, I\'ll get down off my soapbox...

Congradulations! You re-invented the Colt revolving rifle. Seriously; nice 
design. I like the removable cylinder which the Colt didn\'t have (unlike 
their pistols...). How do you prevent flashfire (where the ignition sets off 
ALL the cylinders at the same time-ouch! say goodbye to your non firing 
hand)? This was so bad with the Colt that soldiers had to hold the weapon by 
the lowered loading lever....Or does FF+S not allow for this?

It\'s a good idea, but it\'s generally resisted in the US. We tend to be more 
individualistic and like conformity less than Europeans (though my personal 
observation is that we seem to be getting more conservative, and Europe more 
liberal. This, is of course a generalization...). We also have a little thing 
called the Bill of Rights (part of the US Constitution) to gum up the works. 
Children\'s clothing choices (and forced wearing of uniforms) tends to get 
challenged on 1st Ammedment "freedom of speech" issues...

Now, did I say suspicious?  I said "draw a lot of attention."  It
could be good attention.  ;-> OTOH, if *all* you dressed in, all the
time, was black I might have some concerns...it would qualify as a
quirk at the very least.

You really don\'t see a *qualitative* differences between now and
then?  Compare Bill Haley singing "Rock Around the Clock" or the
bad-boy Rolling Stones to Marilyn Mason...or Nirvana for that
matter.  Compare movies aimed at teens like, the somewhat
controversial for their time, "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Billy
Jack" with "Heathers" or "The Basketball Diaries."  Okay, maybe I\'m
getting old, but I can see large qualitative differences in then and
now.  I don\'t think *any* of the above will "mess up" a well
adjusted teen or adult, but not everyone is well adjusted.

I don\'t think exposure to graphic simulated violence is a primary
cause (or excuse) for actual violence.  I *do* think constant
exposure to *anything* tends to desensitize you to it.  And If what
you want is to shock and confound your peers, you have to pick
something that *still* shocks them.  What is shocking now days?

Teens are still discovering their identities. They need to know
where they fit, who they are.  They need attention from adults, but
even more from their peers, and they are still developing strategies
to get it.  Some strategies work, some are self destructive, and
others are just plain destructive.

Some teens have it easier than others, they are able to "fit in"
some established respectable group and can get their identity and
attention from that group.  We all know "the jocks", "the pretty
girls", "the brains", "the popular kids" "the band geeks", right?
It doesn\'t mean they don\'t feel disaffected, but they have a support
group with reference points to fall back on.

It\'s been a while since I was fifteen, but I remember it well.  I
was lucky enough to be in a school where I could be "a brain."  We
hung out together discussing science, science fiction, LOTR, playing
chess, and AH wargames when they came out, I predate rpgs or we
would have played them too.  ;) I was also lucky to have gone to a
school small enough for a below average physical specimen like me to
make the football squad, for the brainy valedictorian to be in the
chess club *and* and on the pep squad, for "band geeks" to be in the
Key Club or brains, or play sports, and for football players and
cheerleaders to be in the chorus and drama clubs.  Sure, we had
cliques, but there was a place for most of us and enough
cross-fertilization for the lines to blur allowing us to mix...most
of us.

But I remember a few poor souls that just never seemed to fit in
anywhere.  If the school had been different, larger, more
impersonal, I might have been that way myself.

So, what about the "lost souls?"  

They have to cast around until they can acquire an identity either
individually or in a group.  With all the conventional niches staked
out the more disaffected teens sometimes turn to shock and
confounding conventions in an effort to "be themselves."  They get a
mohawk, smoke in the bathrooms, dress in weird clothes...or in all
black, write graffiti on the walls, espouse an "out of style"
philosophy, shave their heads, play "chicken" or "mumblly peg",
pierce something, join a club, a cult a gang, take drugs, tear holes
in their "perfectly good jeans", shoplift, dabble in the occult,
retreat into fantasy worlds, commit sucide, and listen to "that
awful noise, you can\'t call *that* music...", and blame their
problems on the "cliques" they can\'t join.  And if the they are
lucky, or unlucky, they find others just as filled with angst as
them and form their own clique...

Didn\'t we *all* do some of that, even those of us who will admit to
have been in the "in crowd?"  Aren\'t we lucky that is all we did,
that we found a way to get through it and come out the other side?

But what if none of that seems to work?  What do you do when nothing
seems to be shocking anymore?  If what is considered conventional
includes everything that once was shocking, when you are pushed
further and further away from the middle, from normalcy, then what
do you do?

Okay, okay, don\'t mind me, I\'m just rambling, but all this does
worry me.  For 30 plus years I\'ve *seen* kids on the margin getting
pushed further and further away from the center as the norm expands.
Once I thought expanding the norm was all to the good, now I\'m not
so sure...that worries me too. ;-\\

More recent than that, actually. The emphasis on peer groups started during

Only if you have long delays between moves. I work 60-70 hours a week for
ten months of the year (then go offline while a recharge on the beach), so
I need lots of slack to allow for the Real World.

A boy in New Brunswick was sent home for refusing to change. He insists

	I don\'t know how well known this is, but DOOM was created by Sandy Petersen, a former rpg 
designer who wrote "Call of Cthulhu" and much "RuneQuest" material for Chaosium in the 1980s.  
I\'ve communicated with him online in the past, though not for several years, and as far as I 
know 
he\'s a really great, thoughtful, and intelligent guy.  The point of this is that any attempt to 
distance the "rpg community" from the "DOOM community" is compromised at the very heart, even 
without the \'statistically significant\' overlap.

as long as most of us remember the physical, emotional, and other abuse that
was suffered during the the 7 years of hell referred to as secondary
education. And as long as we remember the vengeance fantasies that I - and I
am willing to bet more that a few of you - held very deeply hidden in the
most secret places of our hearts and minds.

How many of us retreated into these games _because_ they were far safer,
physically and mentally,  than the "reality" that we dealt with daily?

Perhaps it was more because I grew up in northern Wisconsin where the idea
of responsible gun ownership hadn\'t been gutted by the NRA\'s insistence that
every home have an assault rifle, but the simple fact is that no matter how
badly I might have wanted to do something similar, I couldn\'t have.

The other thing to remember is that this is not confined to public schools.
Back in 1981, the local parochial high school was pipe bombed by a
disaffected student. But you won;t hear most of the "talking heads" mention
cases like that because they don\'t fit their narrow right/left dichotomy

(I managed to survive and graduated in \'82 and joined the Army. Ended up
spending 16 in with my reserve time counted till my knees and back gave up
and only joined originally because I expected Ronnie to start WWIII and
wanted to be able to shoot back - which is what the M-60A3 MBT was very good
at... (should say all I need to about _my_ politics...:\')   )

This is an incredibly OT thread and yet we keep going despite ourselves. May
I respectfully submit that we still need to express our own "damage done" in
a safe environment? I hope we can continue to do so.

One last comment - consider "Clif" in the light of all of this...

The day after  Denver, A boy was sent home from the school where I teach for
wearing a black trench coat.
I imagine that  trench  coats in general will join  the list of no-no\'s on
our dress code next year.
The concern is not the  symbolism, but the ability to conceal items in the
long coat. Same reason  why baggy jackets/coats are already banned here.

If most dress codes are like our school\'s, anything that "distracts" is
going to be banned.  That is the blanket statement to cover things that are
not spelled out.
There is also a great chance that we will finally get uniforms.    In
Houston (near where I teach)  70% of   the students in the district wear
uniforms.   I am sure our district will do something in response to  this
event due to the fact that one of our High School principals is in Denver
since he has specialized training in crisis intervention.

Seriously, get the G:T Far Trader and figure out the trade routes for the
subsectors. Draw them into the master map with red, yellow and blue lines.

It will let you assess civilian shipping requirements and the direct and
indirect impacts of blockades - it hurts to be blockaded, but it also hurts
the worlds who now cannot import from you.

The \'no economists or mathematicians\' line. You should have said
\'Post-Sraffites need not apply, as matrix theory is not supported under the

\'No Spofulams\' could have been a concept, as well.

I would have suspected that any world joing the 3I would not voluntarily
enter into the agreement if they thought they could not get out.  Few, if
any, people will do so, especially on a world-state level.  Most
non-conquered people would not enter into an agreement to have someone else
ultimately govern them unless they fewlt they could withdraw from the
arrangement.  I would see a withdrawal clause being in many agreements
between the 3I and member worlds.

Woah, slow down a minute there, Eris (and Mr. Thrash, and all others who
reply positively). You\'re making the *mistaken* assumption that everybody
who plays Doom and Quake style games plays RPGs the same way. That\'s not at
all the case. As I pointed out, the vast majority of my RPG companions play
first person shooters. Interestingly enough, there\'s no direct correlation
between how the games are *played*.

Here are some examples from my own Traveller games of what I mean:

1.) TNE: Party goes to free another player character from a partially
functioning 3rd Imperium prison. It has been converted to a work camp where
the descendents of the prisoners and slaves brought by the Guild mine
radioactive materials. The prisoners and slaves die in the process, as could
be expected. The party poses as a group of free traders looking to purchase
radioactive materials. They meet with the head of the work camp. When his
guard is down (thanks to Tetris... don\'t ask, it\'s a long story) they knock
him out. They free all of the prisoners. In the process, they kill one
guard. The angry slaves revolt once they are free. Although things get out
of hand during the "riot," they are extremely careful about wanton killing.

2.) circa 1105: The party is hired by a business person to kidnap a rival
for a few days to give her a chance to make a deal that will save her
company from going under. The group, as a whole, tries to minimize injury to
the victims. One of the characters gets trigger happy and murder\'s one of
the guy\'s bodyguards in cold blood. Most of the party members are outraged.
Several sessions later, the bloodthirsty character is spaced for a number of
reasons, mostly due to his extremely violent nature. Two members of the
party openly object to the spacing.

3.) circa 1105: The party is in the employ of a megacorporation. They are
ordered, under false pretenses, to assassinate the daughter of a lab head. A
huge bonus is offered to them. Along the way, they discover bits and pieces
of the truth. Piecing it together, they go against their orders and whisk
her off to the safety of a rival megacorp. In doing so, they end up hunted
by their own people.

The most popular series of sessions I ran contained nothing more violent
than a single fist fight! It was a subsector-wide scavenger hunt. The only
time a weapon was fired was during a shooting contest to protect the honor
of the ISS Dresden. They mostly tried to stay one step ahead of the other
ships in the hunt. They did this by guile (tricking the hunters from other
ships into picking up the wrong thing, giving wrong directions to certain
planetary landmarks), roleplaying and general wit. It was one of the more
interesting and entertaining campaigns I\'ve run for any game. From the
response of the players, they seemed to be getting a real challenge and a
real kick out of it.

Regardless, the issue isn\'t whether both are intertwined structurally. When
I play Quake, Doom or something similar, it\'s for an entirely different
reason than when I play Traveller, or AD&D, or GURPS. All I\'m saying is that
all of this talk of distancing groups of roleplayers makes me nervous. It\'s
not like roleplayers, as a group, aren\'t already fractured enough. It\'s bad
enough I have to keep track of the GURPS vs. AD&D camps, the CT vs. MT vs.
TNE camps, the G:T vs. traditional Trav camps and so on...

Well, for one thing, they are likely to get a *severe* case of "vac
bite" as the portion of the chamber outside the plasma will be a fairly
good *vacuum*. 

Second, assuming magnetic or electrostatic confinement, he\'s gonna get
zapped pretty badly by the charge diferences (can you say *big* spark?)

Third, the neutrons and EM radiation (UV, gamma, X-Ray, etc) will give
him a nice sunburn. 

4th, if he actually *contacts* the plasma, things should get
interesting. It is thin, but it also has a fair amount of energy. He\'ll
definitely screw up the fusion reaction, but say he only gets the
energy from the last 1/10th of a second of reaction. In a 250 MW
reactor, that\'d be 25 MJ. 

Given how *thin* the stuff is, I\'d say damage would be more like a PAW
strike than that from a flame or hot gases. Not just surface damage,
but damage all the way thru as the *very* high speed ions deposit
energy thru the entire thickness of the hand.


BTW, I *am* revising my previous stance a bit. If containment fails,
the chamber will have to deal with the energy of some fraction of a
second of the reactor\'s output.  For example, the 25 MJ above. Which is
the energy equivalent of about 6 kilos of TNT. So it *could* damage the
reactor. But it\'s nowhere near the "nuclear catastrophe" most folks
imagine.

It might injure someone near the reactor, and it\'d *definitely* make
the cheif engineer cuss a lot. But it\'s also the sort of thing that you
can design the chamber to handle. After all, that\'s 6 kg of TNT spread
over *how* many cubic meters?

As I noted, it\'ll be more like sticking his hand in the path of a
particle beam of similar power. Ooops.

That\'s why I like the Electrostatic confinement design. They think
they\'ll be able to get it to turn the fusion energy *directly* into
electricity with 85-90% efficiency!

Oh yeah, since the required "spherical grid" for breakeven looks like
it\'ll have to be able 5 meters across, you can just toss the whole
idiot in after his hand. :-)

Standard procedure is to have *big* tank of water saturated with some
boron compound placed such that when the proper values are opened,
*gravity* will let it flood the reactor, displacing the normal coolant.

As I noted elsewhere, this leaves one *hell* of a mess to clean up, as
the reactor is going to "run funny" until you get all that boron out of
it.

Although I would love to see a *new* sector source book, I think (like another previous poster) that it\'d be nice with a sector never detailed before...

Trojan Reach was detailed (not like the Spinward Marches, but enough to start playing) in the Travellers\' Digest, and, in fact, most of the area behind the claw has, IMO, been done to death.

It would be nice to see some other part of the Imperium (or Charted Space) covered - most of the trailing parts of the Imperium has never been done, especially those lying coreward. Antares sector could e.g. be a very interesting source book...

Sir you\'ve hit on the exact reason I am going with the multi-player 
"strategic" format rather than attempting a straight role-playing game on 
line. The multi-player network allows for the built-in time lags that are 
part of the Traveller Universe. By allowing players to manage a network, they 
will be able to balance their characters to have some in transit, while 
others are doing tasks on world. Thus no down time for actual play. Also the 
normal "month" to transit from one world to another is perfect for the pbem 
format aiming for one turn a month per player.  Based on my experience with 
past games in the Star Trek genre, players will probably settle on between 
three to six characters with which their personalized game will revolve 
(actually taking on the persona of the most powerful character in most 
cases).  Although I personally as a referee think the GURPS Traveller game 
should have tied the GT characters\' ages to the amount of starting character 
points to reflect that very important part of the original Traveller game, 
players I have interacted with all like having the standard 100 character 
points, up to 40 points in disadvantages, etc., as outlined in the GT rule 
book. To facilitate play, I am setting the starting points for all characters 
regardless of position held in the pbem game at 100 character points, 40 
points disadvantages, etc., as per the GT rulebook.  May I suggest for that 
you consider using one of the GURPS character creation programs featured on 
their computer aids site at Steve Jackson Games. I am using both the GURPS 
Character Assist (GCA) and the GURPS Character Maker (GCM) program. I prefer 
the GCM program for its usefulness. Combined with the Starship and Astrogator 
programs that Mr. Bont has written we have a wonderful framework for running 
this online game. 

If this campaign is successful, Mr. Bont will deserve the credit for his 
wonderful shareware programs that are making it possible.

If you can find copies, read E.E. Smith\'s "Skylark" series ("Skylark of

Marc C. "Blackie" DuQuesne is most definitely a villian. But he\'s

One suggestion. For the con market, you might consider drawing up
uniform descriptions good enough to let someone take the description
and the patches and create an "official" uniform. That\'d also help the
folks with miniatures.

An interesting (and *deadly*) variation on this is what happens if you
have the right sized sub-critical masses placed such that a person can
walk between them. The person\'s *body* acts as a moderator and you\'ll
get a *huge* jump in fissions. Usually just a bright blue flash and a
*more* than lethal neutron flux. The unfortunate sod basicly gets to
think "Oh Sh*t!" and report to the infirmary to die.

This sort of thing was learned the hard way back in the early days. And
it\'s why design of storage areas and labs is *real* tricky. You even
have to worry about it in figuring experiment setup if more than one
batch of fissionable material will be in the same room. 

You also have to worry about lots of other materials acting as
moderators *or* as neutron reflectors. 

I\'m tempted to try to find a way to set this up as some sort of booby
trap, but it\'d be *grossly* unfair in that it\'d be nearly impossible to
forsee.

Well fellow fans of the Traveller Universe, the Entropic Worlds Campaign is 
offically underway. 

You will notice a large number of addresses on this mailing list. Actually 
only four of you are actually being proactive at this point. But remember 
that this is supposed to be a monthy turn formated game. But feel free to 
adjust or modify your "turn" as often as you feel necessary. 

Remember the mechanism that is driving this campaign is the development and 
placement of characters within a network that you are running. I am assuming 
that each of you will actually assume the persona of one of those characters 
directing the other characters from within the play universe. But if that is 
too abstract feel free to run this simply as a wargame. You are able to shift 
from one mode of play to the other as is comfortable to you. 

Remember I can not start generating detailed referee responses to your turns 
until I have your characters in hand. You can query me with play environment 
research questions and rules rulings at your leisure.  I intend to remain as 
true to the Classic Traveller/GURPS Traveller mythos as possible under these 
unique conditions. Please do not assume that something that is not canon in 
the established Traveller universe is permitted until you have checked with 
me. For example: Black Globe generators on all your ships, or a piece of 
Ancients Technology for your own personal use.  I suggest pulling out and 
reviewing your older Traveller materials before beginning the GURPS character 
construction process. 

If you feel overwhelmed by the information within the Traveller lore, I 
suggest you start small, say a single ship or character, and we will build 
from there. For you crusty old Travellers like myself -- the Universe is ours 
to play in once again.  

It is important to remember the times it takes to go from one world to the 
next in Traveller! Generally speaking it takes a ship one month to transit 
from one star to the next regardless of how many actual parsecs actually 
being travelled. Thus the monthly turn sequence I selected for play. 

Ok, most of you have decided on your factions from which your network will 
draw your support. We have Imperial Navy, two megacorporations, the Darrians, 
the Imperial Scouts, and the Sworld Worlders so far. Hopefully I will pick up 
an Aslan player and  the Zhodani. Remember for those of you that played in 
last summer\'s Star Trek game...there will be no general narrative going out 
to all players this time. Each player will receive a specific response to 
their characters\' actions, information will not be shared to the general game 
public. 

Bob the Referee.

beams.  

The drop capsules are there because of the passing mention of orbital
assault capability for the troops.  Some of the other additions like low
berths are there both to fill out space and for realism (I figure low
berths would be used for some combat casualties, for instance)

I\'m assuming that the missile bays fire a larger ship-killing missile but
don\'t have a design for it yet.

As a kid, my mother placed very strict controls on what I could watch
and how much I could watch. This may have something to do with the
discrimininating habits I have today. 

This is not to say that all I got to watch was Sesame Street and its
ilk. I remember that Hawaii Five-O was on my "permitted" list. (Hey,
it shows the good guys winning over the criminals in the end...)

Thing is, when it comes to movies I like action/adventure pics, especially
with a dose of SF. But I don\'t like violence in real life -- just up
on the screen... or in the RPG session, like last night\'s inaugural 
session of my GURPS Traveller campaign, which included a major firefight
against a group of drug smugglers...

(It\'s not like the evil drug smugglers didn\'t *deserve* it...)

I suppose in GURPS terms, it would be a 1-point Quirk. Part of the
reason is aesthetic -- I look better in black than in primary colours.
Part of it is that black goes with everything when it comes to colour
co-ordination. But it also means that when I *do* wear something brightly
coloured, it creates a bit of a sensation with my co-workers... :)

Still, the image works for some people. Johnny Cash, for instance.

If someone is already well-adjusted, none of these will cause someone
to go over the edge. I rather like Manson\'s cover of the Eurythmics\'
"Sweet Dreams", for instance. (Can\'t stand Nirvana.)

On the other hand, if someone *isn\'t* well-adjusted, sooner or later
*something* is going to push them over the edge. It may be a violent
movie, but if that person is never exposed to violent movies to start
with, it will ultimately be something else.

In the meantime, should what you or I have available to watch be
restricted because it *might* set off someone who\'s not as sane as
we are?

I *was* that way myself. And I turned out okay.

True. In Classic Traveller, missiles were high explosive, and thus a
nuclear missile was a _very_dangerous_thing_ and treated with respect.

Then, once people started tinkering with designs for TNE, they noticed that
actually _hitting_ a ship with an HE missile (and making it explode) is a
lot harder than the original designers thought. So someone decided to use
detonation lasers for missiles. A great idea for ship combat, but
unfortunately it invalidated either the prohibition on nukes or the
carrying of missiles by civilians.

If you want both realistic missiles and the prohibition on nules in your
campaign, dig out the rules for kinetic kill missiles. These seem to be the
best compromise between canon and the real world. (INO, of course. Not
trying to reignite any flamewars here.)

Shouldn\'t planetoids be losing some available internal volume?  This is
more of an issue for jump-capable designs like your merchant ship but I
inadvertently deleted that so I thought I\'d mention it here.


>15 Staterooms

Shouldn\'t there be at least one single occupancy stateroom?  I\'d expect 
the CO to have his own cabin.

> Performance: Accel 0.1 G (0.1 G empty, 0.1 G overloaded),

With no significant acceleration, it\'s going to be very easy to simply
bypass this rock.   If it doesn\'t happen to be lying in the path of the
attacker, it will never get there.

I\'m not sure how the crew calculations are working here.  10 turret gunners
makes sense, but there should be only 8 bay crew, plus an unspecified
number of crew for the spinal mount, certainly more than 2.  I used 15
spinal mount crew for my Armored Cruiser conversion, which uses the same
spinal mount.

It will make things easier of you use a round number for DR.  DR 10,000 is
much easier to use than 10,111.

General Comments:
There\'s no sickbay, which would seem to be important in a warship, even one
this small.

Well this is obvious.  How do you keep kids from shooting each other?  Ban

	Don\'t be so sure.  At the school where I teach students wearing black

Superindendent banned all students from wearing coats of any kind inside any

I remember seeing a reference, but don\'t ask me where, that
efficiencies *might* get close to 95%.  It had to do with higher
temperture superconducting materials on the containment walls.

I\'ve been thinking about that too, for Traveller.  The advent of
gravitic control might mean that the central plasma could be made
much more dense and thus the grid\'s radius much smaller.  So, the
minimum reactor core diameter might drop from, say 700 cm...?  I
suppose this is where a function based on TL might come in handy.

One could argue that bays have a protruding part, and thus add a bit of

Having a screen requires one crewmember on the bridge (Screens Officer).

Likewise, a spinal mount requires a single gunner. (Yup, seems odd to me
too, but that\'s the ruling from David Pulver.)

Seeing as your changes (except for the bay armour) make your design exceed
GT requirements, this means you have a valid design.  Could I include it in
101 Starships?

I know it\'s not a Traveller tech, but has anyone tried to build a
det laser using the non-rechargeable power cell from GRUPS Vehicles?

If I haven\'t screwed up the math, a 20 kg GTL-11 power cell contains
2,000 MW-secs.  If the cell can flash discharge fast enough and FEL
efficiencies are good enough that should power a reasonable det
laser head shouldn\'t it?

I find the overall affect rather dramatic.  If I used the rules for bay
surface area  in GT, the total area to be armored would rise by more than
40 percent.  That\'s a big hit penalty.  With the errata ruling that bays
take 50 internal spaces, they are now effectively fixed-mounted weapons as
discussed on GT p.156.  Based on that rule, I\'d say they shouldn\'t add any
surface area at all.  I might accept a small increase, maybe as much as
1500 sf per bay, but even that imposes significant penalties (about 10
percent) to armor mass.

I was figuring some sort of maintenance requirements, both for screens and
spinal mounts, to account for the additional crew.  Perhaps I\'ll sit down
and work out the maintenance man-hours required using the Far Trader rules
and see how many that is.

Back when I was in High School, we got a new principal, who used to work in
one of the NYC inner city schools.  His first action as principal was to
issue these blue plastic passes to all teachers, one to a teacher.  The
idea was, you were not allowed to be outside of a classroom without one.
He seemed to be thinking that this would prevent people from
gathering/talking/smoking in the bathrooms.  

Two days after this was introduced, there were two blue passes left in the
school...  One guy I knew had over 40 of them...  So much for that attempt
at mindless disciplinarianism...

Our policy too and it reeks, except for the fact that we found a way to get
rid of the fights in general.
Throwing a punch, either in defense or as aggression gets you a ticket.  The
local judges are charging $150 per offense, sometimes they allow community
service instead.  You would be amazed how few kids  really want to fight
when money is on the line.

Part of the problem is that VE2 has armour as external, and that\'s the
system that GT is based on.  I designed this using Christopher Thrash\'s
second draft rules for planetoid hulls.

An easy way arround this would be to calculate the volume required by
armour, and just add that in., Of course, to be fair then we should be
doing that will _all_ jump-capable ships, not just planetoids.

Yeah. I\'m meant to retitle it "orbital defense station", but forgot.

Planetoids, in general, are either heavy and almost immobile, or lighter
and cheaper. Although as the hull rarely accounts for a lot of a ship\'s
cost, I suspect that the actual advantages to using a planetoid will prove
to be outweighed by the disadvantages.

I\'ll check for a glitch there. That should have been 8 for the bay crew.

Spinal crew is 1 bridge crewmember for the weapon, according to David
Pulver (and the GT rules). I suggest you start lobbying for an errata on
this...

I entered 10000 for DP, and took the DR calculation from the GT book. Maybe
I should work backwards?

You have to admit that it really fell apart in the last two seasons.. they

What I want is for SciFi to show all the MST3K Gamera episodes back to back.

The very same.  MM is a big fan of BOC, and has penned several sets of
lyrics for them.

He is also an isufferable megelomanic, and many UK fans have amazing tales
of dealing with the Ego That Walks Like A Man.  When the novel _Bimbos of
the Death Sun_ came out, it was a common joke that the murdered SF writer
was instantly identified as Harlan Ellison in the US, and as Michael
Moorcock in the UK.

Hardly a fair test.  After all, as an 11B1V, you _obviously_ have enough

The term "lighter" is an old one; it dates as far back as the age of sail
and refers to a small vessel used to move cargo over short distances,
usually within a harbor, but sometimes along coastal trade routes. 

The "Lighter Aboard Ship" concept is taken directly from contemporary
merchant shipping.  A LASH cargo vessel carries its cargo in self-propelled
barges stacked in a large cargo space.  On developed routes, they\'ve been
largely displaced by container ships, but LASH vessels are still used on
some routes that visit less developed ports where container loading
equipment isn\'t available.  I\'d expect a very similar pattern in Traveller,
so LASH ships could be quite common in Frontier areas like the Marches, but
rare in the interior of the Imperium.

It\'s a handwave for average temperature.  In GURPS Space, the book suggests
choosing an appropriate temperature range.

The Climates given are:

Climate   Average Temp (F)

Very Hot     120
Hot          110
Tropical     100
Warm          90
Normal        80
Cool          60
Chilly        40
Cold          20
Very Cold      0
Frozen       -20

The temps are for the 30th parallel.

>Also:  How old was Arbellatra during the Second Frontier War?  I seem to
>recall one source saying she was quite young.  If so, what does this mean
>about the Imperial Navy?

According to the MT Imperial Encyclopedia, Arbellatra was born in 587.  The
Second Frontier War lasted from 615 to 620, so she was 28-33 during the
war.  This *is* young for a Sector Admiral, but she was a genius.  It\'s
also noted that Cleon V (565 [615] 618) was the one who gave Arbellatra the
command.

hmmm..  Why does Cleon V take time from fighting the Civil War to appoint
what was probably a Lt. Commander at best to the highest ranking position
in the Marches?  Was Arbellatra given the job in return for a promise to
bring the Spinward Armada to Core to reinforce Cleon?  If so, was
Arbellatra\'s actions when she arrived premeditated, or did she act on impulse?

Let\'s take a look.. The 2FW breaks out in 615.  Assuming that the warning
signs were there to begin with, news reaches Capital within 18 months.
Cleon, needing some sort of hedge to his rule, provides an ambitious
(family member? ally?) with complete carte\' blanche (possibly through use
of an Imperial Warrant) with the requirement that once the war is won, the
fleet must be brought to Core.  Arbellatra complies, but somewhere along
the trip in she runs across the news that Cleon (and several successors) is
dead.  
Having the chance to view the situation from outside, she decides to end
the Civil War by setting herself up as Regent, and starting a search for a
legitimate heir.  Or does she?  A woman who will jump to the top of the
chain of command like Arbellatra did might easily use the cover of a search
to eliminate heirs, and take the throne for herself.

It is interesting to note that one Arbellatra\'s earliest acts as Regent was
to form the X-boat network.

and of course, the Templars were involved somehow.

A mixture of 3 and 4, with 3 being the biggest cut.

I\'d love to see some Imperial Sunbursts along with those mentioned above!
But if it comes about, pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaase make distributors outside the US
aware of their existence... I\'d proudly wear a sunburst on one shoulder, and
a unit.scout badge on the other (or on the chest) of my jacket.

All of the above to some degree Russell.  Plus they fire a DP round that has
some very heavy punch to it.  If you have ever seen footage of one of these
beasts in action (training vids, Discovery Channel, etc.), there is a 30-50
metre kill zone around the target also, so don\'t allow PC\'s to stand to
close to a target if attacked by something like this and expect to walk away
unscathed!  I\'d also assume that a VRF Gauss Gun might have a similar
effect?  This is my own observation -- any other Travellers care to set me
straight on that for my own records?

Thomas is entirely correct about the historical origins of the term. The
other answer is The Reformation Coalition Equipment Guide, p. 129:

"Lighter: Nonstarship greater than 100 tons displacement, with performance
3G or lower, designed to land cargo from orbit onto planetary surface."

modules as an appendix.

However, this is a busy week (report cards out, parents\' night, two field
trips, and three cricket practices).

It would greatly help if someone could design the following modules:

- - Basic Bridge, Command Bridge, and Cockpit/Systems modules for GTL9 and GTL11.

- - GTL9 and GTL11 versions of the weapons in GT.

- - GTL9 Stateroom (I can\'t retrodesign the GTL10 version, so I\'m obviously
missing something)

- - GTL9 and GTL turrets and bays (I can\'t figure out how they were designed,
but then I haven\'t had a lot of time to fiddle with them)


Please include all the design data when submitting them, so we can
double-check your numbers. (This will also help with the fission power
variant I\'m tinkering with.)


BTW, GTL9 military ships work a lot better with fusion rockets and fission
power plants.

A Lighter was a small boat used during the age of sail to transfer cargo,
especially to a beach or other area too shallow for an deep draft ocean
vessel to navigate. Lighters were used extensively in the New World along
the east coast in Colonial times.

The concept is "equallity" to a certain degree, everyone wearing the same
uniform at school doesn\'t single out those trendoids/well-to-do\'s with
Calvin Cline (spelling?) Jeans, Gucci, whatever, against those with <insert
cheap generic brand here>.  Although, unless this also includes footwear,
mobile phones, jewelry, etc., then the effect/reasoning is lost.  Basically,
everyone dressed the same do ing the same work suffer no class (as in
wealth) distinctions... in theory.

I believe that goes with uniformity as well as out moded health issues
(those with longer hair were morw suseptible to head lice, it was harder to
maintain [and don\'t argue with that one... after going from \'long-haired
lout\' to the army, I found short hair amazingly easy to maintain!  Then many
years later, I have reverted to long hair again, I have noticed the
difference of easy short to difficult long -- but it\'s a personal choice],
and many kids often "looked" shaggy/unkept).

In Victorian times, kids did what they liked if they weren\'t forced to help
mom and dad in the shop, on the farm, etc.  They ran roughshot over the
cities testing limits, they were regularly beaten (because they were so
suseptible to the influences of the devil, and the beatings drove the devil
from them).  They became a problem and one of the things noticed about the
industrial age, was that with adults working (often in uniforms), the day
was regimented, things had timelines or even deadlines.  It was decided
therefore to put kids into school and equate it with the current work
ethic... it was in fact "kids work" with uniforms and regimented days and
deadlines and so forth.

Hmmmm... I never thought that sitting through that boring 3-hour video about
children\'s rights and civil rights with my wife (part of her childcare
studies) would be of use to me at all... Well, we  live and learn don\'t we?

Great.... So only rich kids can afford to fight....  And their victims

Well, all LICs (License Imperial Corporations) have to give 5% of their

Ghostscript (the de fact standard Linux PS program) can output to a tiff
file.  Those are easily converted to gif by any number of programs.

Well, the GT to V2e design rules (GT p.157) imply that jump drives have a
fair amount of surplus capacity, so it may not be a big issue.  OTOH, the
volume of a planetoid\'s armor will take up a lot more space than the bonded
superdense in a conventional design.  Perhaps it would be worth calculating
in this case.

That\'s my suspicion too.  Planetoids should be used only for special
applications, and should always be unique.  After all, how often can one
find enough similar rocks to create a significant class of vessels?  Even
two similar rocks will have different internal structures, favoring at
least semi-custom design.

I think I will, as soon as I have some more refined figures.  Here\'s my
thinking so far.

Based on the maintenance requirement in Far Trader, I calculate that a MCr
1035 spinal PAW should require 4.8*1035/SQRT(1035) maintenance man-hours
per day assuming it\'s in like-new condition (a fair assumption for the IN,
I think).  That works out to 154 man-hours.  Assuming 12 working hours per
day (a high figure, but consistent with typical naval schedules), you need
13 personnel. (Operators can double as maintenance personnel, so there\'s no
need to add them.)  

The equivalent figure for the MCr. 939 spinal meson gun is 147 man-hours,
which also rounds to 13 crew.

The energy bay weapons have maintenance requirements of around 22-23 hours
each, which fits nicely within the 2-man crew.  Missile bays are vastly
overcrewed (they need only 4 hours a day), but they need operators for
other reasons, and the missiles themselves may require some routine
maintenance.  

Turrets require at most 8 hours per day (three TL10 lasers), so the
requirement of one crew per turret makes sense, even of you group them in
batteries with fewer operators.  Again, missile and sand turrets are
overcrewed, but this acceptable in the grand scheme of things. 

I\'m less sure how to work out crew size for screens.  GT has somehow
linearized the crew requirements for modules that should have a square-root
term, but I don\'t follow how it was done. I saw your discussion with Chris
Thrash on Pyramid, but I didn\'t understand it very well. Perhaps, one or
both of you would care to enlighten me.  

Thanks.

Did you take the weight/volume of the water for the Fusion Rocket into
account?  As far as I can tell, the reaction mass for a VE2 fusion rocket
at GTL9 is _huge_, many times greater than the mass of the ship.  The
rocket requires .02 Gallons of water per hour per pound  of thrust, which
works out to .17lbs of water per hour per lb of thrust.  

If you have enough reaction mass for 40-60 hours at 1G (that figure is from
FF&S2) that works out to 6.8-10.2 lbs of reaction mass per pound of ship!
so your ship will have to be nearly 90% reaction mass....  And that\'s for a
freighter.  FF&S2 says that a military ship should have more....

What\'s really needed is a drive that uses very little reaction mass that is
accelerated very fast (like the HePlar)... Unfortunately, there isn\'t one
in VE2 that is capable of 1G+ acceleration (Optimized Fusion uses much less
mass, but weighs 3000lbs per lb of thrust, limiting you to at most .0003G...)

Or I may have done my math incorrectly... :)

Chris, this one\'s all your\'s. Seeing as I defered to your judgement...

(Although, parenthetically, I\'ll note that with the current method of
having a fusion slice, and just adding modules, there\'s no way to do that
_but_ linearly. I suspect that an average value was picked that stayed
fairly close to Traveller canon, but it would have been nice to have the
guidelines listed in teh book for those of us designing stuff in more
detail.)

According to _Striker_, Imperial worlds have individually set defense budgets
averaging 3% of GWP in peacetime. The Imperium gets 30% of the defense budget,
which is split evenly between the subsector forces and the regular forces.

The Imperium may also tax interstellar trade, but AFAIK there are no
canonical figures fro that. However, the Imperial family owns a healthy
of the megacorporations and many corporations and thus gets a huge yearly
sum in dividends. While some of that undoubtedly goes into the personal
accounts of Imperial family members, it has always been my theory that
the emperor paid the Imperial bureaucracy out of this 


IMTU the Imperium gets a straight 1% of GWP (Also, the cost of getting an
interstellar charter is to give the emperor a 2% share in the company for
free). This is quite close to the canonical figure and avoids the strange
situation that the world that elects to spend less on its own defense (and
thus relies more heavily on Imperial protection) pays less than the world
that spends a lot. (Also, the subsector duke, sector duke, archduke or
emperor can declare a state of emergency; while it lasts, the Imperium can
demand 5% of GWP.)

You can reconcile _TCS_, _Striker_, and _Pocket Empires_ by making the
following assumptions:

1) The average TCS type pocket empire has an average peacetime budget of 10%
   of GWP, modified by government type.

2) A pocket empire world splits its budget evenly between its army and its
   navy.

3) Worlds belonging to large interstellar states like the imperium spends a
   lot less on their peacetime budgets (like the 3% mentioned above).

You\'ll have to use cr10,000 per citizen for GWP rather than the figures from
_Striker_ and then use the method in _PE_ to find the relative value of their
credits.

Obviously he wouldn\'t. That would IMO be a little too much of a promotion.
But who\'s to say that Arbellatra had followed the same career track that
the average Imperial officer does? I\'ve always assumed that Arbellatra was
from a high noble family, daughter of an Imperial duke at the least, maybe
even an archduke. So she had fast-tracked through the service. Propably she
was a commodore serving under Cleon and got promoted to Admiral on his way
to the throne. She was propably one of his most trusted followers.

>Was Arbellatra given the job in return for a promise to bring the Spinward

That\'s certainly possible, but I don\'t see why that would be necessary. Just
preventing someone disloyal to him from getting control of a big armada
would be worthwhile.

I\'d say that several interpretations of her personality and motives are
equally plausible and is best left to the writer of Milieu:600.

That\'s something I\'ve suggested before, but it\'s not canon. It\'s just that
with one exception all the Imperial companies for which we have stock
ownership information (which is the 13 megacorporations and three or four
lesser companies) have a minimum of 2% (not 5) owned by \'Imperial Family\'.
For some of them it is much more than 2%, but that would, of course,
represent genuine investments on the part of various Imperial family
members. 

The problem is that pesky exception (I can never remember which one it is,
but its one of the megacorporations). Either one would have to claim that
the information is in error and that the Emperor does own 2% of the company,
or there is some fascinating story why some emperor sold the "Emperor\'s
Share" (which would be something clear against policy) in that particular
company.

If you have high-population worlds, you have fleets equal to or greater

Especially if you let them use realistic military budgets...

If that was so, the _Trimkhana-Brilliance_ would have been in jump space
when the drop tank failed to detatch. Also, the description clearly states
that jump takes place AFTER the tanks are at a safe distance from the
jumping ship.

None of which applies to Traveller drop tanks (Well, #1 might, since
CT drop tanks are even cheaper than CT fuel tankage. However, there\'s
no apparent reason why you shouldn\'t be able to build a drop tanks that
was just as solid as an ordinary starship, and it would still be
cheaper. Indeed, even with GT fuel tank prices (which are way higher
than CT) drop tank service is still cheaper than regular service.

A drop tank is a container for liquid fuel with a system for detatching
it from the ship and getting it and the ship separated very quickly.
There\'s a limit to just how destructive said system can be, since it
wouldn\'t do to damage the ship, now would it?

>>as to Trav DT\'s, they would need checking for cracks after each drop,

>>(failed O-rings are nasty :( ...  ) etc.

That is the way I hope to go, but as I said, there\'s a limit to just how
much damage those explosive bolts can do, even with shaped charges. Come
to that, I find it hard to believe that explosive bolts are needed to
separate two objects in space. There must be other possibilities.

That said, even if a check of the tanks don\'t cost anything at all in
itself, just having to tow the tanks from the jump limit to a workshop
will make it more expensive because it limits the number of times per
year a drop tank can be reused.

Not quite, since we do have the information that it was reduced by 80%
rather than 99 or 99.9.

I didn\'t say there was a need, I said I wanted one. For one thing, I wanted
to balance the Darrian population with that of the Sword Worlds so that the
Sword Worlds caught up with the Darrians in strength not long before their
first land grab. That has ramifications for the size and growth of Sword
World populations over the years.

Its all interconnected and mostly based on a bunch of assumptions, which is
why I was interested to know if Rob had an actual canonical figure for the
pre-Maghiz population.

They had worlds on which they had outposts or colonies. My view is that the
off-world Darrian population was very limited (which is why the _Maghiz_
could not only destroy the infrastructure of all the worlds but also cause
them to actually lose much of their TL-16 knowledge  --  something I find
it difficult to accept would happen if any of the other worlds had had a
sizable population).

I doubt the Maghiz actually killed very many people on other worlds.

Somehow I suspect that nude schooling would be somewhat distracting to

True, but he asked where it came from, not what it was. :-)

There are several possible origins I\'ve read.

One is that the original use of a lighter was to allow a ship to get over
sand bars and similar obstructions that it couldn\'t with a full load on,
hence the term "lighter", as it makes the main ship  lighter.

The second is that the small craft was originally used to take soundings for
the same reason, and the name comes from saying "send out the lighter ship
first" which of course got contracted to "send out the lighter

The third is that it originally was "alighter" as in the word "alight"
meaning to "dismount"..

Another is that the small boat was also used for lighting the way of the
main ship when travelling up rivers and into ports at night.

I\'ve been trying to figure this out myself. The maintenance rules in FT
were a start, but I frankly didn\'t look at what was required on a
per-module basis until just recently. 

Working backwards from the crew requirements per module for maneuver drives
and jump drives, it appears that GT neglects to take the square root that
appears in VE2  (p. 75). This results in an Engineer (Mechanic, in GT
terms) requirement that is linear with power for a given TL -- necessary in
a modular design system like GT\'s -- and is an implied official rules
variant for the Traveller setting.

Maintenance man-hours are based on the total purchase price of the ship. If
you try to figure out the requirement component-by-component, you will get
a faulty answer (as I\'m sure you realize) because the results are not
linear. Moreover, VE2 (p. 75 again) doesn\'t directly require maintenance
personnel in the crew for anything other than propulsion and lift systems. 

I agree that one crewman (a Gunner) per spinal weapon isn\'t a very faithful
rendering of HG and others. Earlier I tried the same method you did, Tom,
with the same results. Requiring other large, power-using systems (like bay
and spinal weaponry) to have maintenance crews on the same basis as drives
might be a more reasonable extension of the rules for the Traveller
universe. For example, a TL10 spinal mount (p. GT157), which includes a
18983.3 MW power plant slice, would require 76 maintenance crew (about 1/20
spaces). The TL12 meson spinal mount would require 19 (~1/80).

This will clearly have to be a topic of discussion for GT: Starships.

ObTrav here: IIRC, while looking through Striker it had no mechanism fo allowing penetration of a round through multiple hits. Penetration was based on the value of an individual round even if you had a very high ROF autocannon. Easier to hit, more hits, but no penetration bonus. Did Striker II resolve this, or did anyone come up with a resolution IYTU?

Oops - my mistake. I thought Space played them. Brain fart there or something.

Anyways, there are two sides to the "news is entertainment" coin. While
it may seem low-brow to present the news as entertainment, CBC (as much as
I love it) too often makes entertainment into news. CBC thus becomes,
may times, the most boring TV station on the planet. Even more boring than
BBC4.

OBtrav:  How about a death cult of non conformists who see inteligent life
as an anathama.  They want to \'cure\' the milky way of the infestation of
inteligent life.  A \'good life\' cult if you read the bizerker novels.  Give
them a secret base or two, some powerfull conections in the way of some
second sons of nobles or \'geek\' nobles, some secret labs doing \'doom\'
research ect.  Perhaps one of their labs has an accident and the super
Chimax escapes... or perhaps the darrians \'loose\' a copy of the tech specs
for the star trigger...or the doom cult discover a different way to make a
star go super nova...or a long lost grandfather weapon so dangerious that it
could even take out grandfather and it\'s got him worried also...say a
\'dimentional detonater\' or planetary scale disintigrater!

Make the cultist real cultist.  Death is not something they fear but a
reward for a job well done in the service of the cause.  Now that is a
scrary enemy!

	Does anyone have a canonical reference for this?  We were arguing about it in the 
GT:Starports playtest.  It has always been my impression that #3 & #4 were correct, but the 
playtest draft has #2, income taxes.

These are OK.  Not absolutely necessary but
they have a lot of useful things.  I think Arsenal
is more useful, but then I treat vehicles rather
disposably. ;-)

I liked this as a starter adventure for a campaign,
but I had great difficulty keeping the players interested.

Good.  But get the errata.
And the correct formulas.  The ones in the book look crazy.

Some useful stuff.  My players like it a lot.

Nice pictures/plans, but not necessary.

Good.

In that case, IMHO, the best supplements for T4 are:
Aliens Archive
Pocket Empires
Psionic Institutes
Imperial Squadrons

In MT it\'s still Captive, in TNE it\'s either Captive (Non-Wilds) or TED =
(Technoligically Elevated Dictator) if it\'s a Wilds world.

Depends greatly upon the politic\'s of the homeworld.  If the homeworld =
is repressive then the colony is likely to follow suite.  It could also =
be owned by a corporation or something.

According to the TNE Regency Sourcebook as of 1120.

Pretoria    0406   B656967-C   N   Hi Cp Mr     720  DD  G5 IV

Okay, population over a billion, captive/colony government, moderate =
law.  The thing you want to look at here is the Trade codes.

Hi - Hi Population
Cp - Subsector Captial
Mr - Military Rule...   <--This is the important one.

Thus being a Subsector Capital and under Military Rule, we can assume =
that Pretoria is likely on giant Military camp under the direct control =
of Deneb.

Good.  If you really like designing equipment down to the last weld, this

Awful.  Gack, spit, vomit.  Possibily the worst waste of trees and ink ever

Good.  Very useful collection of gear for any Traveller game.  Includes
some interesting rules.  The vehicle design rules are a lot of fun, and if
you have access to a Mac, there is software avalible to speed the process.

>Naval Architect\'s Manual

Average.  A collection of deckplans, nothing more.  Useful for helping
players visualize where they are onboard ship, but filled with silly,
non-canon ideas like having laser turrets with windows so the gunner can
aim visually!!

>Imperial Squadrons

Good.  Raise this to very good if you plan on running a Navy Campaign.  One
complaint, my ship designs were ruined by IG, but them\'s the breaks.  Uses
a system based on Fifth Frontier War to run combat for Pocket Empires.

Not necessarily.. Look at the Law Level.  All Gov 6 means is that the
government is offworld.  It could be a situation like the early American
colonies, where people were enthusiastic supports of the Mother Country,
and just didn\'t have the resources to self-govern.

    'body' => 'The variables that led to the shooting in Columbine HS are probably
numerous, but a few of the more obvious ones are:

1) Killers were alienated youths, subject to ridicule by their peers during
a time in their lives that peer pressure is at it\'s strongest (at least for
most humans in modern American society).

2) Killers gained access to firearms and information necessary to construct
explosive devices.

3) Killers believed that violence was a suitable method to achieve a
motivational goal (the nature of this goal is, as of this writing, still a
subject of speculation).

There are, of course, other variables involved, since the above combination
of variables is not necessarily exclusive to the killers at Columbine, yet
the incidence of events similar to what recently occured there cannot be
referred to as "commonplace."

Where this subject affects this list most is in the third variable above.
It has been suggested that game-playing is an instrumental factor in
causing such incidents as that which occured at this unfortunate Colorado
high school.

How the killers in the Columbine incident came to the belief that violence
is a suitable method of problem-solving a subject of debate. It seems
obvious that exposure to the concept of "violence as a means of achieving
an end" was most likely through the various information media such as
movies, games, history classes, etc. However, it is equally obvious that
such exposure is not sufficient to cause otherwise normal individuals to
become murderous.

But still, it is a factor.

So what do we do?

ObTrav: If the incidence of individuals who will resort to actions that
result in massacres can be expressed as a percentage of the total
population, then such incidents will increase as population increases. Add
to this factors such as the capability of high tech weapons to kill large
numbers of people, and you have a recipe in the Imperium for numerous
Columbine-style incidents (or worse).

Science fiction is, in a lot of ways, about solving problems through
technological advance (or at least dealing with problems that technological
advance causes). An Imperial fleet with laser-detonation warheads can do
little to reduce the suffering alienated youths, nor deter them from taking
drastic and tragic actions. So what technology can the Imperium bring to
bear on this problem?

Perhaps in thinking on this, we might gain insight into what we can do in
the real world to prevent such events from occuring.

Yup, it is 2%, not 5%.  This is explicitly stated in GT Far Trader (p

Been there, done that, bought the school tie.  It doesn\'t work.

Because my parents moved when  I  was  young  I  experienced  two
different high schools.  The  first  had  a  school  uniform  and
routine corporal punishment (one of my better teachers often used
to slap a random kid up the side of the head as a way of  getting
the class\'s attention!).  This was a violent place with a  brutal
pecking order, and even though we all dressed the same  we  still
had social cliques (jocks/swots/etc).  Students cared little  for
their work (school was something to be endured) and we  all  felt
strongly motivated to rebel against the system ...  many  carried
knives to vandalise school property, public transport,  and  each
other.

The second high  school  was  a  mirror  image:  no  uniform,  no
corporal punishment.  There was little vandalism, few  fights  or
masocistic tendencies, and lessons seemed  important.  There  was
almost nothing to rebel against.  The students felt they had some
ownership of their lives and their futures.

Introducing school uniforms to improve student behavior may  work
in individual cases, but overall will fail.  Schools  are  micro-
societies, and every social problem is complex.  Simple quick-fix
solutions are the result of a poor  understanding  of  this.  I\'m
not against school uniforms as such, but this idea is in the same
class as banning black  clothing  because  of  what  happened  in
Denver.

ObTrav:  If more schools ban RPGs  as  a  result  of  the  Denver
tradgedy (and others)  then  in  time  there  will  be  less  RPG
players (schools being the largest source of new  players).  Less
RPG players means less RPG consumers.  Less RPG  consumers  means
more RPG companies will fail.  Thus the TML, as part of the wider
RPG community has a vested interest in the way in which our world
precieves and interprets these  events.  The  lack  of  sociology
skills in  the  general  public  ultimately  threaten  out  hobby
(amongst other things).  We need positive PR.

... Actually we need a better general public, what we have belong
in South Park!

I\'d like to add a bit here.

One thing about GURPS is it is more realistic than most RPGs as far as
combat and lethalness is concurned.  Most players learn real quick that
combat with modern or future weapons means death or very serious injury to
unarmored people in a hurry.  In the fantacy part of the system magic and
armor reduce the risk some but combat is still risky and charater death all
to easy.

I\'ve played RPGs for many years.  I played many systems.  I found it very
refreashing to see AD&D hack and slashers play the GURPS system for the
first time.  After ONE combat they start looking for other solutions (after
creating a few replacement characters, love those damage multipliers for
cutting and impailing attacks).  GURPS teaches the good players that combat
is the last option and if you must fight have every advantage you can manage.

I too, have played and GMed many hours of RPGs without any direct violence
(threats, intimadation, and dirty tricks yes combat no).  In a recent long
running game the only deadly combat the PC took part in was a battle with
some wild pigs that some very foolish and very hungry NPCs tried to eat.
There was a murder investigation earlier on but the bad guy was brought down
by grappling unharmed.  The \'what do we do with him now?\' was also great
role playing.  IE: fast talking a lench mob in one not so easy lesson. (Grin)

The PCs were part of a marroned group and food was running short when
someone discovered piglets.  Moma and daddy peckery came to see why baby was
squeeling.  Imagine a large crowd of unarmed tourists and a small herd, 6
adults, of very angery wild pigs.  Only a few pisols were available to a few
ships officers who had been issued them for the life boat boarding.  The
pistols were .32 caliber revolvers and the adult pig were 200+ pounds and
berserk!  It was a crisis management situation and very tense.  Great role
playing by the players.  The pigs also used up a large part of the very
limited ammo available and some of the even more limited medical supplies
had to be used as well.

Not all RPG situations have to be combat based and even the \'combat\' based
one can be, in effect, non violent.  The PCs did not want to the fight or
hurt the pigs but they did not want to get gored with only minimal first aid
available.

My one serious gripe, in the old days, with D&D (the only RPG I was aware of
at that time) was that it was set up for mostly hack and slash dundeon
crawling but one day, while looking for newly published D&D suplements,  I
came across those little black books....(Big Grin!)

Ps: I work with computers 8+ hours a day.  I generally am sick of looking at
a screen by quiting time so computer games are not high on my list of
recreational activities.  After a week in the office I want to be outside.
Thanks to some recent changes in my life (for the better) I\'m back into
gardening and some other long neglected hobbies and activities that get me
out into the fresh air and sunshine.  It\'s amazing how much it can improve
your outlook on life.

The irony is that I got into electronics because of the games.  Now I find
most video games boring and predictable.

Far Trader says (pg 47) its 2%.

From MT Ref\'s Companion, it looks like Instellarms doesn\'t have any shares 
belonging to the Imperial family, though "noble families" have 8 percent.  
The megacorps all are owned, at least in part, by each other and since the 
Emperor has a piece of the pie in every other megacorp, he would indirectly 
have it with Instellararms, too, wouldn\'t he?  

Course, MT is reknown for its editing difficulties and that could be one of 
em (and/or) whatever the source is, as IIRC, Ref\'s Companion is a compliation.

Um, other way around, actually.  BOC\'s lead singer is a huge MM fan, and Eric and MM have appeared together at a couple of conventions within the past several years.  But MM has been snarky about the band, beginning shortly after "Veteran" came out.  Something about no one telling MM that BOC was recording a song based on that poem.  

MM got along much better with Hawkwind.  He toured with them on several occasions, doing poetry readings at the shows.  I believe HW\'s live set "Space Ritual" has MM reading the poem that became "Veteran".  IIRC, he also did introductions on the Chronicle of the Black Sword tour.

What do kids crave more than anything?  Attention.  Issue each
child a cyber-desk.  This portable computer contains all the
books and resources most students need.  The most important
thing in it is a powerful mentor program that helps the student
overcome their weaknesses and is always there to listen and
give advice.  Linked into the mentor is psychological monitoring
software with routines that talk to the parents about issues
that are important to their children.

  "Mrs Taki?  This is Albert, Joey\'s mentor.  Joey scored
   93% on today\'s spelling exam.  I think it would be grand
   if you let him know that was a job well done."

Of course, the mentor is really Big Brother in a box.  Figure
built-in home signals, crisis reporting to authorities, and
building psyche profiles that stay with a child through their
adult life.  It would be hideously effective as a propaganda
vehicle and for shaping young minds into productive consumers.

Not at all.  Given that I finally got to see Matrix, the
technology of destruction is looking real sexy right now.
Of course, I\'m also a Hong Kong action, anime, SciFi kind
of guy.  I\'ve been meaning to do a game like that for years.
Maybe it will see the light of day.  Amber DRPG or Feng Shui
would be a perfect ruleset to do it with.

Unfortunately, Gov 6 is not, IMO, well thought-out.  It _should_
denote a government that is directly responsible (i.e., not
autonomous) to another (i.e., that must subordinate its own
interests in toto to the interests of another government, even
where such subordination would not be in the best interests of
the subordinate world) - but that provides no information about
the actual structure of that subordinate government.

It\'s also used as a \'best choice\' for a military dictatorship
(i.e., the government is captive to its own armed forces).

I think it would have been better if Gov 6 was used for "Armed
Forces in control of government (i.e., military dictatorship)",
with conquered or colony governments being indicated in the notes
(i.e., conquered and under military occupation would be Gov 6
with O:1208 in the notes, colony with a representative democracy
locally would be Gov 4 with O:1208 in the notes).

That, and the fact that they are all middle or upper middle class
suburban kids.  Maybe all that exposure to cars, single family homes,
and shopping malls is just too much for some people.

When I was in high scholl in Boise, Idaho (1973-76), there was a fair
amount of worried discussion about long hair and beards on male
students, but most of the real stressing out about it had ended early in
the decade.  Different things were tried, and I think my high school
(Capital) even had a hair length requirement (that I totally violated
until my senior year, when I decided, for fun more than anything, to get
a crew cut).  Boise High School did enact a fairly strict maximum hair
length rule.

Fast forward to about 1982.  I had graduated from college and was living
in Boise again. Crew cuts and even shaved heads were becoming popular
among the punk rockers.  Boise High School made the news by imposing a
_minimum_ hair length rule.  Parents, many of whom had fought the hair
wars in Boise\'s high schools in the 1960s, went berserk (in both
directions -- berserk support and berserk opposition).  It was an
interesting place and time.

I suppose that all children who might be targetted should learn aikido. 
"But, Mr. Principal, I didn\'t defend myself.  He attacked me and I got
out of the way.  Then he fell down because he wasn\'t controlling his
energy and direction.  Then he kept attacking and I kept getting out of
the way and he kept falling down until he was exhausted."  Not many
teenagers could get to that level of aikido quickly enough,
unfortunately.

It\'s an old term for a small boat used to carry cargo from a ship to the
dock.  The precise etymology I don\'t know -- maybe the Oxford English
Dictionary is on the web?  If I remember, I\'ll look it up in the
bookstore when I go out later today.

According to the OED:

A boat or vessel, usually a flat-bottomed barge, used in lightening or
unloading (sometimes loading) ships that cannot be discharged (or loaded)
at a wharf, etc., and for transporting goods of any kind, usually in a harbor.

The earliest usage given is AD 1489.

I have just finished last week a scenario like that. I was asked to start
(or really restart) a gaming club at a local high school. As I was one of
the people first involved in such a club when I was at that very same
school (not that many years ago (<10?)) I decided to try it. Because of the
concept of GM:ing for total beginners, and because I had been inspired by
the G:T, I decided to have a go at G:T. I made an adventure starring GTL 6
farmers in a remote village on a planet that gets visited by Varg ihatei
invaders. Because the characters were uneducated and backward, I didn\'t
have to explain a lot of the world before the game started.

Another potential complication from this side of the pond - London had it\'s
second nail bomb attack this weekend. The media (and police) have linked
the attacks to far right racial supremacy groups - namely Combat 18, and a
group called the White Wolves. I hope that the UK media (who have already
started to link the US killings to a similar type of group) don\'t make the
link ->

Vampire - Trenchcoat - White Wolf....

We had a teacher (Lyn Smith) who had an older brother who played RPGs. She
cleared the way for us to use her classroom, and run the club we set up
herself. I suspect that she cleared it with the management first, but we
never had any problems at the school (Catholic Church funded too..).

I\'m not sure how much she had to argue for the set up, but it became home
for 10 to 20 of us from the age of 11 to 17. Interesting group too (a wide
range of ability and backgrounds).

It\'s something that I really liked, and appreciated. Gave me a lot of
confidence (I ran the club). Recently, my wife Sarah (teaching maths 11-16
years) has allowed some of her kids to play RPGs in her room a lunch. She
doesn\'t play them herself, but appreciates these \'weirdy games\' her husband
plays.

I found that the bullying only stopped after two occasions - one where I
dropped the guy who attacked me by fighting in an \'ungentlemanly manner\' -
he\'d expected to trash the nerd pretty easily, and if I do fight i fight to
win. The second event was when someone had a go at me in the
playground/school yard and attacked me. Fortunately, I was over 6 foot, and
he was shorter so I held him off and he looked very stupid. The sad thing
is that it ended up in violence to solve the problem. But I suspect that
there are many things that happen which the teachers either don\'t know,
can\'t prove or can\'t act on.

I don\'t think there\'s an ObTrav to this.

BITS has a *limited* number of promotional patches left which we produced
for GenCon UK for use by the stall personnel. Contact Andy Lilly at
bits@bits.org.uk for more details. I will try and get some images on the

Strange - in the UK, when the Dunblane attack happened we *banned*
handguns, not the jeans or jacket the murderer was wearing.

     As one Aikidoist put it, "I hit him with the biggest thing I could
find, the ground."

Not all Aikido is "Hearts and Flowers."  Some ryu can be pretty darn rough
and tumble.
The trick is to spin the former to the school board, then teach the latter. :-)

I would say that this DOES NOT follow contemporary wet navy practices.
Engineering and hotel systems (potable water, waste systems, lights) require
a much higher level of regular maintenance than weapon systems.  This is
reflected in manning requirements for Navy ships.  Typically a ship requires
a large engineering crew, approximately 100-300 trained individuals on a
destroyer or cruiser. The same ship might have perhaps a dozen weapon
systems specialist. Most Combat Systems specialist work not on the weapons
themselves but on the sensor systems that the weapons require. Most
munitions, missiles, etc. require no shipboard maintenance at all. Indeed,
many weapons CAN NOT be worked on by ship\'s force, but must be offloaded to
a shore facility for repair.

If Imperial systems are in any way similar then the manpower requirements
are right in line.

According to Travellers\' Digest #1, "Pretoria is currently under Imperial 
Naval Rule as a result of the Rachelean Revolts of 1010 and 1011."

Of the Rachelean Revolts, TD#1 says, "(1010-1011) Major uprising on 
Pretoria/Pretoria, fomented by the Rachele Society, resulting in martial 
law under the Imperial Navy since that time.  The Imperium as a rule does 
not interfere with local politics, but their intervention was forced when a 
scout base on Saki/Pretoria (0306) was destroyed by nuclear weapons."

The Rachele Society was a secret Vilani supremecist group founded on 
Pretoria by Zid Rachele in 992.  In 1010, they attempted to takeover the 
Pretorian government, and in a failed attempt at nuclear blackmail, killed 
26,000 persons (including 1900 of their own commandos) on Saki.

I believe that Mike Jackson originally wrote most of the information on the 
Trojan Reaches in his fanzine "Third Imperium".  He published 11 issues, 
covering 1 subsector in each issue.  I believe that he went to work for 
DGP, so I don\'t know if he sold them the rights or what, but a lot of what 
was published in TD was based on his work.

You\'ve seen it here on the TML many times.  (It\'s a view that I espouse,
and I think several others also.)  Remember that canon doesn\'t address

Vargr ihatei!  That\'s a scary thought.  As if Aslan ihatei weren\'t bad
enough.  I can see it happening, however.  Some Vargr travelling through
the Spinward Marches meets or even learns about Aslan ihatei, and takes
the idea back to the Vargr Extents.  Land hunger becomes a great
motivator for expansion and the Vargr are on the warpath again!

That is also what the original Supplement 8: Library Data (A-M) says ,

I think income tax won´t be good. The imperium rules the stars, the worlds
rule themselves.
IMTU, this includes taxation. So I would also go for the percentage of GWP.
Perhaps some other tariffs could be imposed, like tariffs for trade outside
the imperium 
(Inter-World tariffs being the affair of the worlds again).

A bit like the EU, really. The EU is financed by it´s member states, not
directly by the population. They pay taxes to their individual countries,
while they pay the EU.

Yup, 1.66 dtons per module per hour.  However, I didn\'t provide enough fuel
for hours of acceleration at high-G.  Instead, I assumed that GTL9 space
tactics would call for leisurely transits with lots of high-G maneuvers at
the end.

Yeah, but the exhaust isn\'t nice to be around. I\'m currently assuming that
(a) only military ships use fusion rockets, and (b) almost all freighters
are low-G orbit-orbit ships. At GTL9 you can\'t make a decent jump freighter
with even 1G acceleration.

Well, HEPlar was a hand-wave to get away from reactionless thrusters. I
seem to remember that one of the physics blokes worked out that it is too
efficient for the discharge energy, or something like that.

The easiest solution is to decide that GTL9 reactionless thrusters are the
early models, and are superceded by the middle and late parts of the GTL
(corresponding to TL10 and 11).  As I\'ve said before, cramming three
Traveller tech levels into one GURPS tech level requires some changes to
GURPS, or to Traveller. As a chap who\'s played Traveller since it was frst
published, I know what I\'m changing...

xv will do it, too, but it only creates an image the size of your desktop, and if the resolution is too low to read the print, you\'re stuck with it.

Also agreed.  I would use FFW to determine regiments and divisions so

Just a question for those on the TML who care about such things:

Do jump troop units wear anything related to beret flashes, or the oval
flash worn by US Army paratroopers beneath their jump wings?

If so, then flashes pertaining to jump troop units would be welcomed (by
me, anyway).  Metal insignia for jump troops, and cloisanne pins as
distinctive unit insignia (a.k.a. unit crests), would also be welcome.

It would seem, sir, that you have arrived at the solution postulated in

that the USA is a gun culture and that they were into Nazism seems
irrelevant to the media.   If I\'ve gonna hit you and I\'ve got a gun
I\'ll shoot you, thats the attitude amongst people today.  Give a nazi
a gun and they\'ll shoot someone, hopefully themselves.

This can\'t be completely the case; large merchant ships of similar tonnage
to
naval ships get by with much smaller crews in spite of having presumably
similar
engineering systems. And if a large fraction of the crew\'s efforts go into
"hotel" systems
that\'s just plain weird - if 90% of your crew is maintaining your toilets,
and 90% of your
toilets are there becuase you have such a large crew, there\'s something
wrong. I know
Navy ships have large crews ("low automation", in Traveller terms) to
improve damage
control capabilities, but presumably a lot of the crew must somehow be
related to the
military mission - sensor maintenance, as you say, and maintenance of
systems related
to sensors and weapons, and helos, etc.

Of course, a modern warship doesn\'t spend much money on the actual weapons
either -
VL tubes are cheap, so are dinky little 5" guns. It\'s the sensors and the
ordinance that drive
up the price. My interpretation of the GT rules (which may be wrong) is that
ordinance doesn\'t
count in the price for maintenance, so maybe the GT rules would produce a
similar
result - most of the crew busy maintaining the engines and sensors - if used
to design a
late-TL-7 surface warship.

"Uniforms of the Terran Occupation Force", _Travellers Digest_ #14 mentions
jump wings but notes that Marines leave a blank spot where they should be
worn (except in dress uniforms), because all Marines are jump-qualified,
while only elite Army troops are so trained.  They also mention the
unofficial combat drop slash, worn at the back of the collar (a narrow
strip of black on field uniforms, scarlet on the maroon dress uniform.)  

It\'s a good article, although the illustrations must be of Miles Vorskogian
as a Marine.  The model is 5 foot nothing (150 cm for the metric crowd, the
Brits will have out work out "hands" on their own.)

Sadly, there\'s no description of the jump badge, although the Marine crest
is descried in detail.

Of course, these may be off limits due to the DGP situation.

The idea is that maintenance can be deferred at the risk of breakdowns. 
When that solo scout ship reaches port, he\'s going to need some time to put
things back in working order.  I\'d argue that maintenance doesn\'t accrue as
the ship sits on planet, so you can catch up in a week or so, or a few days
with help.

(Why, yes, now that you mention it, the air scrubber is always the first
thing to break. :-)

OTOH, the small ships are a bit more hard-pressed than large ones.  You
might halve the requirement at less than 200 tons or some such arbitrary
level.  You could also eliminate the cost of armor from that calculation;
this is a factor in military vessels where thick armor is expensive but
should not be maintenance intensive.

Oh, this one is a bit harder, I think.

Definition first: the wardroom (one word) is the cabin aboard a ship where
the officers eat and socialize.  By extension, the term can sometimes also
be applied to the junior officers aboard a ship.  

The origin is a bit more confused.  It dates back to at least the 1690s,
when it was used to refer to a room used by "volunteers and land officers
[marines]"  Later, it came to be used by the junior commissioned officers
(i.e. lieutenants) and senior warrant officers (surgeon, master, purser,
chaplain, etc.) My source suggests it probably comes from very early use as
a room for the watch officers, although it might also have been a
store-room for valuables taken from prize ships.

Who, pray tell, are the 1188th?  I ask mainly because my referee has
placed my character in command of the 1199th Infantry Regiment (Jump)
(Commando), and I would like to know whether the 1188th is a sister
regiment.

No, the nazi angle has been downplayed by the media quite a bit in the last
few days, for a few very good reasons. Klebold was of Jewish descent. Harris
had moved to Littleton from another town. In the old town his two best
friends were african and asian-American. One of the former members of the
Trenchcoat Mafia (Alejandra Marx) was hispanic.

My own personal suspicion is that they were fascinated by Hitler to a large
extent. Even some well-adjusted academics are fascinated by Hitler. However,
a being enamored by the nazi regime and being a nazi are two entirely
different things. Of course, I have no proof on that one.

I\'m the RPG coordinator for ShoreCon \'99, which will be held on
September 9-12 1999 at the Hilton in Cherry Hill, NJ. In that capacity,
I\'m looking for GMs (and players, too) for RPG events at the convention. 

The deadline for event submissions is June 1st, and by visiting our
website at <http://gameconventions.com/ShoreCon> you can find complete
information on hotel accomodations, online GM registration (now
guaranteed to work!), and even get on the mailing list to have our
pre-registration book sent directly to you. If you are interested in
GMing an event, the time to sign up is now! 

This year ShoreCon will will be having several special guests, including
Peter Adkison (President and CEO of WotC/TSR), Steve Jackson (President
of Steve Jackson Games) and Jolly Blackburn (creator of Knights of the
Dinner Table)! 

We\'ll also be boasting Target Games\' 1st Annual Games Expo, several
LARPs (Vampire, Star Wars, and Toon!), as well as a large selection of
RPGs, CCGs, Miniature events and Network Gaming!

Thanx for your time...

Not really: most of the engineers on a contemporary vessel work on the
power plant (fission or diesel) itself and its related systems; relatively
few are required to maintain the gears and screws. In the VE2 rule *not
one* of the required engineers is there for the power plant (per se). This
seems unreasonable to me on the face of it.

Since GT weapons modules by definition include a "slice" of power plant to
support them, it does not seems unlikely that they require an equal amount
of attention from the engineering crew as a similarly-constructed
reactionless thruster or jump drive. All are essentially solid-state
devices with just a few moving parts (so far as I can tell, anyway).

The 1188th Lift Infantry Regiment ceased to exist as a unit after a biowar attack on them by their \'allies\' on Malefolge (in the Foreven Sector??)  Its quarterly payroll, MCr 20 in *cash*, had just been deliverd to them the day before, and was not recovred when their position was overrun by local troops.

The question arises, how did the kids get access to those kinds of firearms?
Of course, you can practically get AK-47s out of coin-operated vending
machines
in most of the USA. My apologies in advance to the American members on this
mailing list, but if these kids of weapons were restricted to begin with,
the tragedy could have been averted. I saw a list of the weapons they had --
most of which are, in Canada, illegal for a private citizen to own.

	1188th was a mercenary unit featured (as no longer existing) in an
Amber Zone article. Their unit logo was a skeletal hand holding five
cards--two aces and two 8\'s showing, and the fifth card face down. If
I recall correctly, playing stud poker this particular hand is
supposedly bad luck (hence the skeletal hand ...).

	The (quickly dead) NPC in this nugget was actually carrying part of
a secret treasure map--five different cards were held by five
different former members of the unit. Only when all five were
overlaid would you have the complete map.

The logo derived from the \'Dead Man\'s Hand\' held by Hickock when he was killed 
in Deadwood -- a pair of aces and a pair of eights.

The description of the Trimkhana-Brilliance tragedy in JTAS #6 only says it
occurred "immediately prior to jump" and does not specify the time between
normal drop tank separation and jump. It does say one drop tank failed to
separate, so the ship was not necessarily in jump space under any
interpretation of how drop tanks work. Alternatively, the length of time
between the disaster and investigation, and the damage involved, is not
inconsistent with the ship being in jump space at the time of the capacitor
discharge. There is simply not enough information to tell.

It is true that JTAS #2 says the ship jumps after the tanks separate, but
it also clearly states the tanks are not reusable. All the current
hypotheses have some problems with canon. I am not totally satisfied with
the "drop tanks are discarded into jump space" interpretation myself. For
example, how can the last bit of fuel be drained from tanks sticking
outside the jump field? Also, I vaguely remember a published adventure
where someone collects old used drop tanks.

Looking over the old articles, a TNS release from 101-1105 states the
Imperium has decided to deploy jump-6 XBoats on "all major express routes".
It also states this express service should be implemented to Regina
subsector "within a decade". Considering SJG has advanced the timeline to
1116, the theories that drop tanks would invalidate the current Third
Imperium setting may not be so remote after all.

Yep, I still _have_ copies, including a 1962 second Pyramid printing, with

And this makes much more sense, not unlike an overlord collecting taxes from

That\'s only the pansy jump units, drop troops, OTOH, get a silver death\'s
head ear-ring for their first live drop, and add a single cross-bone
underneath it for each live drop thereafter. Sounds like it could get
uncomfortable, but you don\'t often see a vet with two full sets of
crossbones....

Oh, an\' a "live drop" means being in the tube over a hot LZ, none of this
"in country 24 hours", "arrived in the commodore\'s yacht" shit.

( Historian\'s Note : Difference between the names "drop troops" and "jump
troops" are now largely ignored, due to all assault units now being jump
capable. Earlier, though. the differentiation was impotant. "Jump" troops
are those equipped with gravitic lift devices, and can usually use those
same devices to extract themselves from an untenable beach-head. "Drop"
troops are not, making use of either extremely cheap "one shot" gravitic
braking units or atmospheric braking ( parachutes), and were thus unlikely
to be extractable if the beach-head was compromised )

BTW, I\'m trying to create the same differentiation here between what are now
known as paratroopers, and the concept of an "Air-mobile" unit with integral
ability to take off again, as they have somewhat different psychological
effects on those in them.

The Brit\'s use feet. But real feet, not the US impersonation.
"hands" are for horses.

We not long had the anniversary of a mass shooting in Tasmania (the island
south of and part of Oz).  Our government tried to ban many guns, but being
a strong farming culture (ha!), our farmers baulked at the idea because they
need those fully automatic assault rifles to kill foxes and rabbits (the
former eat small livestock like chickens and domesticated pet, the latter
quickly reach plague proportions) and didn\'t like the idea of being
restricted to bolt action rifles and shotguns.

The Aussie rifle association is now publishing on the net, photos of pollies
and their homes (but only those that oppose the shooters)... for no apparent
reason?????  I know guns don\'t kill people, but I\'m sure that most weirdos
that use them to kill people would be more at a loss!  No apparent reason?
That lost me.

ObTrav:  Notice how many PC\'s smuggle weapons for personal use onto worlds
where they are restricted.  How are they dealt with by the law when caught?

Frankly, I don\'t see the problem. The reference (reproduced below for
clarity ) does not state it is impossible to manufacture a re-usable
drop-tank. It states that this particular brand of drop-tanks are not
re-usable. Perhaps it\'s actuallly cheaper to discard them ?

> I am not totally satisfied with the "drop tanks are discarded into jump
space" interpretation myself.

Neither am I, it is completely against CT canon. CT actually has no problem
with drop tanks, the difficulty comes when you try and bolt MegaTraveller
(and later) explanations for jump-space onto CT. CT is quite happy with the
concept of all the energy from the hydrogen being extracted before jump,
it\'s only when you add the (IMO) silly requirement for the hydrogen to be
used to "maintain the jump bubble" that it starts getting difficult to
reconcile.

But then black globe energy usage for jump also breaks in this case.

>For example, how can the last bit of fuel be drained from tanks sticking
outside the jump field?
Also, I vaguely remember a published adventure where someone >collects old
used drop tanks.

The description of drop tank usage in the original reference states that the
fuel is used to charge the capacitors, the drop-tanks are dropped, and
_then_ jump is initiated. It states also that the technology for drop--tanks
is _not_ the limiting factor, it\'s actually the _capacitor_  technology,
which is currently_not_ reproducible in the Spinward Marches, though the
relatively low tech drop-tanks are.

Note also that this reference implies that the economic revolution some
people are complaining should happen, _is_ happening,
The refernce talks about Oberlindes Lines stock dropping with Tukera\'s
announcement.

>Looking over the old articles, a TNS release from 101-1105 states the
Imperium has decided to deploy jump-6 XBoats on "all major express routes".
>It also states this express service should be implemented to Regina
subsector "within a decade". Considering SJG has advanced the timeline to
>1116, the theories that drop tanks would invalidate the current Third
Imperium setting may not be so remote after all.

Actually , based on this, _removal_ of drop-tanks would invalidate the
setting.

Here\'s the original TNS article :

REGINA / REGINA (0310-A788899-A) Date. 097-1105

Officials of the General Shipyards on Regina today announced that they have
completed negotiations with Tukera Lines to locally manufacture L-Hyd drop
tanks for use on high-capacity commercial vessels. The first production
examples are expected to be available within six months, at which time
Tukera Lines will begin high capacity service from the interior. Component
assembly will be carried out at General\'s more modern facilities on Pixie
(0303-AlOO103-D).

 L-Hyd drop ships have only been in service for the last dozen years in the
interior, being made possible by recent advances in the field of capacitor
engineering, a joint press release explained. Commercial vessels equipped
with the new generation of long-storage jump capacitors carry jump fuel in
specially designed L-Hyd drop tanks in excess of their rated tonnage. Upon
conversion of the fuel to the massive energy required for jump, the drop
tanks are explosively jettisoned through the use of break-away connections
and explosive bolts. Jump is executed when the remains of the tanks are a
safe distance from the vessel.
A spokesman for General Shipyards explained that local yards are not yet
capable of manufacturing the long-storage capacitors required for the
process, but that production of the drop tanks is possible, thus allowing
the high capacity starships of the Tukera Lines to begin service to the
Regina subsector.

L-Hyd drop tanks are not reusable, and thus increase the absolute cost per
jump. However, experience has shown that the increase in cargo tonnage
resulting from the elimination of internal J-fuel storage more than makes up
for this, the press release explained.

The joint press release concluded by stating that local manufacture of L-Hyd
drop tanks marked the dawn of a newsera of commerce and prosperity in the
Regina subsector. Following the announcement, common stock in Oberlindes
Lines plummeted 27 points on the Regina exchange before trading was
suspended. Officials of Oberlindes Lines were not available for comment.

2 has the problem of getting little bits of money off a lot of people.

3 is easier to collect, because you are only invoicing one entity - the
planetary government.

1 and 4 have the disadvantage that doing it discourages interstellar trade,
which is the Imperium\'s reason to be.

There is also #6 - own a chunk of the megacorporations, and spend the
dividends.

Other possibilities include auctioning off rights to newly discovered
worlds and leasing out elements of the IN to interested parties.

The final option is to use debt rather than taxes to pay for short-term
spikes in expenditures - if you cant underwrite the Second Solomani Rim
War, you arent a megacorporation.

*** States compete for spaceports

FREEPORT, Texas (AP) - When Fred Welch surveys 1,000 acres of prairie
near the Texas coast, he thinks not of the land before him but of the
stars above. Welch has a vision for this stretch of soil about an
hour south of Houston. He sees a spaceport, with rocketships coming
and going as easily as 747s at an airport. It\'s a vision shared by
Andy Poole in Montana and William Dettmer in New Mexico, who both
have several thousand of acres available. They all are competitors in
a new space race, where the prize is a slice of a multibillion-dollar
industry - launching cargo into orbit - that could provide thousands
of jobs and create a new hub in the next era of space transportation.

So it\'s a benefit of TL16 jump drives?
Its a shame none of the design systems mention this.

It\'s a shame that whoever wrote this seems to be a bit confused about
what explosive bolts do. As others have mentioned, if you can wait
whilst the various bits of the drop tank drift away at a few m/s,
it should be possible to have a proper fuel tank pulling 10G or more
for a few seconds using HEPlaR or thrusters.
(drop tanks are very light, especially empty ones)

Alternatively, since your drop tank costs 1,000Cr/ton instead of
50,000Cr/ton, what you actually have is just a plastic bag impregnated
with an oxidiser - fire the explosive bolts and you are rapidly outside
the 100D limit of the smoke particles.

    According the the London Times, violent crime is on the rise in the UK.
Perhaps it has something to do with people rather than objects.

Data from the London Times:
More British Statistics 
1988-1993 Britain enacts strict new firearms laws.
1988 - 93: The number of violent crimes increased by 33.6 per cent.
1988 - 93: The number of robberies increased by 80.6 per cent.
1988 - 93: the number of robberies with a firearm increased by 117 per cent.

Australia 
One year after gun-owners were forced to surrender 640,381 personal firearms 
to be destroyed, including semi-automatic .22 rifles and shotguns, a program 
costing the government over 500 million dollars, the results are in...
OBSERVABLE FACT, AFTER 12 MONTHS OF DATA:
* Australia-wide, homicides are up 3.2%
* Australia-wide, assaults are up 8.6%
* Australia-wide, armed-robberies are up 44% (yes, FORTY-FOUR PERCENT)
* In the state of Victoria, homicides-with-firearms are up 300%
* Figures over the previous 25 years show a steady decrease in 
homicides-with-firearms (changed dramatically upward in the past 12 months)
* Figures over the previous 25 years show a steady decrease in 
armed-robbery-with-firearms (changed dramatically upward in the past 12 
months)
* There has been a dramatic increase in 
break-ins-and-assaults-of-the-elderly
* Australian politicians are on the spot and at a loss to explain how no 
improvement in "safety" has been observed after such monumental effort and 
expense was successfully expended in "ridding society of guns". Their 
response has been to "wait longer".

From the Brisbane Courier Mail 
Crime involving guns has soared despite tougher laws imposed after the 
Port Arthur massacre. The number of robberies involving guns leapt 39% 
to 2188 last year, an Australian Bureau of Statistics report reveals. 
Assault involving guns jumped 28% to 806.
In Queensland the use of guns in sexual assaults was also higher last 
years than the previous years.

CT isnt at all happy with that idea, once you plug High Guard into it.

In High Guard, an Energy Point is at or about 250 MW.

Now, if the hydrogren is having it\'s energy extracted before jump, then we
are dealing with e=mc^2.

A dton of hydrogen is therefore e=10^9*(3*10^9)^2, or 10^9*3*10^18, or
3*10^27 joules.

This becomes a slightly less insane 3*10^21 mejajoules, or a quite
reasonable 10^19 energy points at 250 MW an energy point - actually, call
it 3 orders of magnitude less, because you are extracting it over 1000
seconds or so. 10^16 is therefore our number.

Given therefore that a type R meson gun needs a mere 20 000 EP or so (a
measly 2*10^4), why cant we strap a Free Trader\'s jump drive to the back of
one and have power coming out of our ears ?

Ah. I\'ve got it. Two different sorts of power. Jump power and not-jump
power, and they dont mix.

Finally, the description of the Trikhama-Brilliance tragedy is a press
release, and a good read. But eschew Gloranthaism - dont regard old sources
as better, just because they are older (1).

Okay, now I can see the relevance of discussing the recent US school
tragedy in respect to how it relates to RPG\'s and the subsequent public
responses. But please can we keep gun control debates off the list. Not
only do they not belong here, but its sort of like pouring out kerosene
and then holding up a lighted match. This is just not a topic that can
possibly be solved here, and its almost guaranteed to start a nasty little
flame war.

A local talk-radio host pointed out that all of the kids involved in recent
school shootings had been Christians, and said that if we wanted to
scapegoat anybody, that was the only connection.  He was being sarcastic,
but was flooded with angry calls anyway.

I\'ll speak up as someone who is fascinated by the Nazi era, and studies it
closely.  This does mean I admire anything they did, it\'s just an amazing
period of world history.

When I was in High School, I wore an offcier\'s cap from the People\'d
Liberation Army, completes with red star on the brow.  I did this to piss
people off more than anything else, because it was the early 80s and
communism was still a legitamate hate target.  I think many of these kids
get into things like studying nazism and Marilyn Manson just to get a
reaction out of adults.

I\'m not sure I\'d use the phrase "all of the energy from the hydrogen being
extracted". It suggests a total conversion of mass to energy, which Ian
takes as a starting point for his reducto ad absurdum argument.

Personally, I favor the "run it real hard bt real rich to keep it from 
burning itself up like a dragster motor" approach with the precise energy
output undefined beyond "enough to do the jump". I can get up a real good
breeze with my hands waving like that. :)

One item mentioned in the TNS bulletin is the remark that the tanks are
not reusable. Perhaps that is the official story. I prefer to think that 
drop tanks are _not immediately_ reusable, requiring some level of inspection,
refit and repair. After all, you have to replace the attachment fittings at
the very least. 

Someone questioned the need for explosive bolts.

Given that the tanks are drained and then jettisoned, and given that the tanks
have to get clear before initiating jump, you need a highly reliable separation
mechanism. Ideally, that mechanism will provide the tanks with a sufficient
velocity vector such that further maneuvering by the ship will not be required
to achieve the necessary separation. Explosive bolts are a very reliable
mechanism; there are no latches to stick. *poof* I\'m not sure how well they will
impart delta-V. Another approach is, in effect, shotgun blanks to provide the
impulse for the delta-V. IIRC, this technique is used to achieve positive
separation of bombs from bomb racks today. One could use twice as many shells
as required for the minimum delta-V to ensure adequate separation.

yours,
Michael

IIRC, Rico\'s first unit (that was shredded at Bughouse I) used this system,

you were either a combat-proven Roughkneck, or you weren\'t. Everyone
who mattered (i.e., other Roughknecks) knew how good you were without

ObTrav: gotta love them unit-specific traditions.
I\'m thinking of the ritual in the US Navy where they do a kind of hazing
for new crewmen the first time they cross the equator on a Navy ship.
Would Marines in the 3I have a similar ritual for troopers on their first
jump? Something to pass the time in the hole.

A heavy sigh indeed.  I dont care how many laws anyone passes, if someone
wants to go psycho and start killing folks, all the darn laws in the
world wont stop em.  Its already against the law to kill people, and for
minors to purchase weapons.  Of course our nanny government will try
their best to pass new ones now, since its for our own good of course,
not that impending elections has anything to do with it.  I feel very
sorry for the people suffering in Colorado, but darn it, its time to stop
whining about guns and games and movies and start raising our kids right
and taking responsibility for them and teaching them to take
responsibility for themselves.  What next, do we start outlawing
chemistry classes??  I can go in my house and create at least four types
of weapons on hand right now.  I have two kids, and I damn well go
through their rooms covertly, and will confront them about ANYTHING that
is not right, ethical, proper, or simply out of character that I find.  I
also censor their TV viewing, book reading, and anything else that comes
along.  (their only 7 and 10, but it starts early)  It is MY
responsibility to raise them to be good and productive citizens, and I\'ll
be damned if the current government is going to tell me how to do it.  I
own weapons and my kids know it, and know not to bother them.  They know
what they\'ll do to a person.  And when they\'re old enough and strong
enough to handle them, I\'ll teach them how to use them as well.  It is a
fact that states here that have the most lax gun control laws also have
the lowest crime rates, by as much as 30 % in some cases.

Sorry, I had to let that fly.  I feel better now.

A couple of minor points.

1> AK-47s are banned in most of the US, as are the 30-round magazines they
use.

2> Every weapon purchase (expect private sales or at a gunshow) requires a
minimum five day waiting period and backround checks.

Hardly dispensing them from vending machines.

US Airborne tradition is to give a "cherry jumper" (new guy on his first
jump out of Airborne School) a special helmet for his jump.  This helmet is
heavily decorated, and covered with useful advice like "the ground is the
big green thing.. aim for it."  The best one I ever saw had a two foot
spike on top with "LAWN DART" written in orange reflective tape.

Why should that matter?  Hitler was of Jewish descent.  The media

IMTU fresh SDB crewmembers are ordered to do some mundane EVA job such as
checking the passive array for static buildup or somesuch. When the newbie
is out the lock they\'ll accelerate away from him making shure he didn\'t egt
a safety line and keep going until the ship is invisible to the poor
sucker. Then they\'ll wait for perhaps an hour before coming back to get the
poor sucker.

This tradition is illegal due to some unfortunate deaths happening now and
then. The official policy is to stop it but all officers turn the other eye
and pretend they don\'t see it as they secretly like it (as in all similar
abuses after being subject to one one tends to like to inflict it upon the
newbies).

I had an adventure spinning around this about a rookie cremember that was
dumped this way over Efate just prior to 5FFW. The SDB had to abandon their
comrade when the Zhos attacked and when they returned he was gone - picked
up as a prisoner of war by the Zhos.

After the war he was POW exchanged and started looking up his crewmembers
one by one and killing them. Sort of an Agatha Christie in space.

In the scoutship case, he\'d take two weeks to catch up by himself (at 8
hours per
day and assuming he was working 8 hours per day while in jumpspace.) Not
much
time left for adventuring. Even a
two-man crew is basically continually maintaining their scoutship with
little sleep;
a three man crew doesn\'t have much margin either. This makes it very hard
for
a Type S to operate independently - with 1-2 people in the crew they
absolutely
have to operate between ports where they can pay for (expensive) outside
maintenance,
and even a 3-person crew is fixing their ship all the time.

This is an artifact of GT having maintenance go as sqrt(price) - large ships
need almost
no maintenance in proportion to their crew, small ships get really really
shafted. It\'s
unfortunate that the single worst point is the canonical type S...I would
say GT should
consider changing the scaling somehow - either getting rid of the sqrt, or
putting in
options for "high automation" or "low maintenance" ships somehow.

	Twenty thousand years ago, a race of humans arose from the darkness of
their caves and looked out on the valley below them.  What they saw, they
desired.  And what they desired, they took.  As time passed, they took
the entire world, and shaped it to their wishes, making themselves
comfortable and prosperous.  And as time passed, they found themselves
looking for new lands, new frontiers, new challenges, and eventually,
they looked up, and realized how small their holdings were, and once
again, like that long forgotten valley, what they saw, they desired, and
what they desired, they took.

	Eight thousand years ago, these humans found a means of Travelling
between the stars, and Travel they did.  At first they found little more
than dark, cold, icy worlds, and for a time wondered if they were alone
among the stars.  Then, a century after leaving their home world, they
met another intelligence, and to their surprise, these were also humans,
much like themselves, living on a blue and green world full of life and
riches, and the Travellers desired what they saw, and again, what they
desired, they took.

	The discovery of the first garden world impelled the Travellers to even
greater efforts, and over the next five centuries they found more worlds
like the first, all with more humans, and took them all.  Now some of
those worlds they took were also able to travel between stars, and
carried word of the first Travellers outward, and a name became
associated with them, the Sivoloc, and the name became feared wherever it
was uttered.

	After a thousand years, the Sivoloc had stretched their iron fists out
over thousands of worlds, with trillions of subjects scattered across
light years of distance and time.  The Sivoloc still pushed outward,
taking what they wanted, and there was little they didn\'t want, till one
day, the unthinkable happened.  They met another race, this time an alien
race, the first ever, and this race was not about to be taken like so
many human occupied worlds.  They called themselves the Eexoneez, and
they had the will and the means to resist the Sivoloc.  And resist they
did, with a vengeance.  War was immediate, and total.  

	Over the next century, fire and blood spilled across the stars, no
quarter was asked or given, and billions of people along with hundreds of
worlds died varied and violent deaths.  In the end, the might Sivoloc
Empire lay in ruins, along with much of the Eexoneez worlds as well,
along with many worlds and civilizations who had been unfortunately in
the wrong place at the wrong time.  The great messenger ships stopped
crossing the gulfs, power plants grew cold, worlds returned to their
wildnerness state, and the ruins of towering cities disappeared under
carpets of green flora, or grey ash, or black flowing basaltic melt, and
the bones of uncounted billions were gnawed on by the fauna of hundreds
of worlds.  

	Thousands of years later, humans again are finding their way to the
stars, and finding old forgotten ruins, worlds long dead, and the
skeletons of great ships and cities that once teemed with civilizations. 
They are finding great wonders, and dark nightmares.  Join them, as they
Travel once again among....................

As a former US soldier, I suggest - red confetti and perfume (so ye\'
won\'t know if yer shot up and we won\'t know if ye\' lost control of yer
bladder!). 
 A tradition from US jump units is that, after qualification, the jump
trainers pound the jumpwings into your chect - with no backing on the
pins (yes, it hurts) and when a jumper becomes a master (x number of
jumps, in Traveller I\'d say 5 combat drops) he gets distinctive wings -
which are pounded in by the junior jumper in the unit. When my company
commander made master a private had just joined the unit. He snapped a
pin off in one of the captain\'s ribs (which was cracked, as well).
 There is also the tradition of \'prepping the stripes\'. When someone is
promoted to sergeant before the ceremony he is warmed up; usually 1-2
hours of push-ups, sit-ups, leg raises, etc; followed by the \'prep\'
where every existing sergeant in the unit punches him once on each arm
(where the stripes will be pinned). Every NCO in my company came to my
prep - my arms had bruises for a full 6 weeks.

 Military rituals, especially the unit-specific ones of the NCOs, will
be rather physical and probably barbaric to outsiders. In
well-disciplined, professional units the participants will be sore but
not injured - anything that injures harms morale and readiness, after
all.

I also found the GURPS maintenance rules flawed but decided to modify the a
bit. Maintenance interval goes as sqrt(price) in standard GURPS but I added
that the time for each maintenance job also goes as sqrt(price). The time
in man hours a vehicle would need is thus: time(man hours) = k *
sqrt(price) * sqrt(price) = k*price. I also hold that this doing the ships
maintenance as calculated simply reduces the number of breakdowns; doing
30% maintenance equals +3, 10% maintenance +6 etc. This fits the cliche of
old rustbuckets with next to no maintenace (the crew simply fixes
everything as it breaks down instead).

There is also graphics design, artistic talent, things military,
electronics, modeling, imageing technology, political science, history,
education, chemistry, movie trivia, literature, and statistics that I can
recall from the last few months discussions.

Hmm ... Marines will be wearing battle dress when they get into jump
capsules, I think, so no substance will really be unpleasant to them. 
Let\'s think on this for a while.

I\'m of course reminded of the drop in Aliens.  "How many combat drops
you done, sir?"  "Two.  One was in a simulator."  "What was the other
one?"  "This is the other one."

I\'m a little rushed just now, but remind me (via email if you\'d like)
and I\'ll write a press release from the University of Rhylanor\'s
Students for Academic Freedom setting forth their demand for academic
consideration of at least the cultural anthropology aspect of psionics
in society.  

On a related note, "My parents can read my mind" or "my boy/girlfriend
can read my mind" convey something more than exasperation or intimacy,
respectively, in the post-Psionics Suppression Imperium.

It\'s already there -- that\'s why the formula in FT is a ratio between
original (list) price and actual purchase price. If you pay less than list
for a ship (buy it used or something), the maintenance is higher than a new
vessel. If you pay more than list for a ship, the maintenance is lower.
GURPS Vehicles (p. 204?) calls these options "Cheap" and "Fine" (or "Very
Fine"), respectively. The implication is that the quality of the vehicle
should be set at the time of construction, but I extended the rule to cover
used vessels.

One simple fix for your Scout is to say that she has Fine construction, but
that the cost remains the same due to the huge volume the Imperium
contracts to buy (*wave hands as appropriate*). Then recalculate the
maintenance requirement as if the ship cost twice list price.

The maintenance system in GURPS Vehicles is extremely abstract, and covers
a multitude of TL\'s and types of vehicles in a single rule. Some grittiness
is a necessary result.

From reading my comments, you probably understand that I\'m not saying that
an interest in the nazi regime is bad. I am simply of the opinion that the
fascination was confused with the kids being "neo-nazis".

Personally, I was fond of West German army gear. It wasn\'t because I had a
desire to bother anyone though. It was simply because German army gear looks
nifty.

I do think that alot of these kids get into stuff to get a reaction out of
their parents. It makes me wonder though, \'cause my own parents were very
liberal with what I was listening to and doing, yet I listened to the

And at the same time, violent crime in many parts of the US (Including New
York City!) is at a record low....   The truth is, there are plenty of ways
to kill people, if you\'ve decided to kill.  People have been killed with
guns, knives, baseball (and, I suspect cricket ones, too) bats, cars, lead
pipes, shovels, and just about anything else you can imagine.  Guns do make
it a bit easier, but it\'s the decision to kill that is the problem, not the
tool you use that\'s at fault.

Hmm ... Marines will be wearing battle dress when they get into jump
capsules, I think, so no substance will really be unpleasant to them. 
Let\'s think on this for a while.
>>>>>>>>>>>>
I was imagining this ritual taking place during the rookie\'s first venture
into jump space, so he wouldn\'t be prepping for a real drop - unless
his squadmates were totally fed up with him already.

The few accounts I\'ve heard of the "cross the equator" party in the Navy
seemed to indicate great fun for everyone, with a little discomfort on the
part of the newbie. Popping him in a drop capsule and half-filling it with
ice-cold beer might fit the ticket, though the red confetti and perfume
idea had merit.

Imagine this: The Corporal takes the Recruit down to the Drop Bay right
after the transport goes to jumpspace. As a "Training Excercise", he
loads the Recruit into a "Special Capsule" and dogs him in tight. The
Recruit been told that this capsule is a Combat Drop Simulator.

A bunch of brawny Marines (with battle dress)? then come in, pick up
the capsule and roll it around the Drop Bay as violently as practical.
Meanwhile, the festive yet unpleasant substance the Corporal slipped
into the Recruit\'s capsule gets nicely shaken, not stirred.

When the Marines get tired of tossing the capsule around, they let the
Recruit out so he can join the post-hazing party.

FFS2 produces similar results to FFS1. IIRC you could use the COACC and
Hard Times MT design sequences to produce ships faster than 6g for a
limited time.

M Drives - In CT and MT starship M-Drives are limited to 6G. In T4 and TNE
this is not the case. Unsure of GT. There is an argument that you could
handwave T-Plates being limited to a max of 6G with a boost HEPlaR drive
for combat.

In all versions of Traveller\'s canon universes jumps beyong 6 parsecs are
not controllable - they may happen from misjump, but not otherwise.
Grandfather may have ways around this ;-)

IIRC if you use the pellets/powder on an AGR you\'ll never get it working
again because they are so dispersed. I\'m sure you could get it working, but
the cost is counter productive.

Of course, the UK prototype Fast breeder was run without any cooling
systems on and stabilised about 100 deg C (IIRC) hotter than normal, using
natural convection. Shame the Pu use makes it unpopular.

It\'s a cube shaped lake where fish are bred. As this post is about fusion,
they probably use some kind of heat exchange system which discharges low
grade heated water into the mere, encouraging growth of a fish and plant
population. Strange...

UK teachers are advised *not* to touch pupils, even if separating them in a
fight. This is because of the risk of the pupil\'s parent pressing an

BITS adventure module republished and messed up by IG in two parts, and
upaid for. Originally available as \'The Long Way Home\' - it is an adventure
which reminds me of ST Voyager. The IG printing messes up the ship
deckplans. The BITS version is now out of print.

Avoid like the plague. nothing like the original submission by CORE. Became

Another excellent basic book - equipment and vehicles.

Okay deckplans. Some are flawed and a little inconsistent with canon, but
that tends to be in the descriptive text.

Good naval background stuff, plus rules to integrate the FFW combat system
with Pocket Empires

I\'d recommend EA, CSC for the ref as resources. TLWH/GWY as a module set,
IS to mine for ideas for navy campaigns.

Get the vehicles from the BITS sites 102 vehicles download
http://www.bits.org.uk/

IMO the best T4 books are:

MO Campaign (hardback)
Aliens Archive
Pocket Empires
Psionic Institutes

Close seconds-
CSC
EA
Imperial Sqdns

Avoid-
Annililik Run
EV
about 75% of MoS.

101 Starships is a free acrobat file which may be downloaded from the

Rob Prior wrote the file, which is a great resource for GT.

The BITS website is now linked from the SJG Traveller Links pages.

The other common factor (pointed out on NPR) related to their middle-upper
middle class status is the availability of a private space in which to
stockpile materials out of sight of even the other residents of their home.

Kids in, say, a high rise apartment building would not have the luxury of
such space.

According to one Martial Artist I\'ve spoken to, the greatest melee weapon
of the 20th Century is a golf club with a strong/reinforced handle.... It\'s
light and has good reach, and is balanced in such a way that you can do a
great deal of damage with the head.  A low iron is probably best... :)

What\'s interesting is that Wild Bill refused to sit with his back to the
door.  The onlt seat avalible at the fatal game was one that gave him this
position, and his lust for gambling overcame his paranoia.

Um... No.  It was a desire to get away from as much magic-tech as possible 
and fundamental law breaking as possible.  There are some good 
handwaves/supposed technologies that can explain HEPlaRs extremely good 
efficiency.  Plasma Focus, Blacklight, and Zero point energy to name 3 and

It\'s a shame for Canadians, then.  And for all the disarmed proles of Europe.

You\'d have preferred if they hacked up a dozen schoolmates w/ knives or 
hatchets?  If i wanted to kill a dozen people, especially in a school, I 
*could* do so pretty effectively w/ just a good combat knife and the sick 
intentions to do so (which I thankfully lack).  Odds are I could chase down 
as many more, too, especially fat bodies or poor runners.  

Hell, I want California to relax its concealed weapons laws.  The credible 
studies show that responsible citizens w/ guns bring crime down.  The 
criminals get guns anyways.  There was just a good thread on this on USENET 
that cited many good references (rec.games.frp.misc, aside from the usual 
places).  If u want, I\'ll list em.

1988 - 93 (and several years preceding 1988) - major economic recession. By 
1993 the UK had 3.9m children living in poverty (worse than any other EU 
state) and by certain definitions 23% of the population living in poverty.

I don\'t think anyone with any sense thinks banning firearms is going to 
radically reduce crime, since the majority of firearms used in crimes are not 
legally held (before 1988 ownership required a license which had to be 
approved by the police, so it\'s unlikely that clampdowns on such ownership 
would make a serious dent in the statistics). On the other hand I don\'t think 
anyone with any sense believes that relaxing the gun laws is going to reduce 
crime either.

However the killing sprees by crazed loners which have triggered the various 
legislative acts (the latest being Dunblane, resulting in laws passed against 
handguns in 1996-7) were committed using legally held firearms, and the view 
(according to the opinion polls, which heavily supported these laws) has been 
that depriving everyone else is a price worth paying for the (statistically 
small) number of lives that are likely to be saved. Sure, crazed loners will 
still go on sprees, but hopefully they\'ll use knives instead of guns, and kill 
less people. Runs the argument.

A quote I found with the above statistics: 
"crime has grown least in those European countries where discrepancies of 
wealth and opportunity
are lowest, or where governments have worked to ameliorate the effects of 
globalisation and de-industrialisation upon the most vulnerable."

ObTrav - the general crime level is likely to be a function more of the 
economic/social structure of a system than of its law level.

I think that you should read the post carefully before assuming what I meant.

My post was commenting on an earlier poster\'s response describing how \'goth
clothing\' and \'trench coats\' were being banned in response to the shootings
in Colorado. A similar incident in the UK had prompted an entirely
different response. In both cases the cause (disaffected or mentally ill
people) is not being addressed. The US solution is to stamp on the
subculture which used the weapons to kill, the UK response being to reduce
the availability of weapons (specifically hand guns) which the
subculture/group used.

The initial UK response considered keeping handguns available for sport but
the banning lobby won, probably because the gun lobby argued against any
restrictions.

Mark Urbin <eclipse@ultranet.com> also writes:

>    According the the London Times, violent crime is on the rise in the UK.

Two points on that. The Times is almost a tabloid these days, nothing like
it\'s previous self. A sad effect of Murdoch\'s ownership. Violent crime in
certain areas is rising as a percentage, but IIRC overall, numbers of
incidents fell. Anyway we could argue statistics all week. The issue you
may wish to consider is that what we perceive as violent crime may differ
from what US citizen\'s consider violent. We certainly have significantly
lower levels of crimes involving fire arms.

The second point is true. People kill other people with guns. Guns in
themselves do not kill. They are an object.

However, if you cannot avoid people who are unstable, or disturbed, or who
have criminal intent obtaining weapons which are designed solely to deliver
enough Kinetic Energy to kill or maim and using them, you may need to
consider the rules under which society makes such weapons available. UK law
bans handguns and semi-autos / full autos on the basis that there is a need
for shotguns and hunting rifles, but no real need for pistols and assault
rifles/SMGs.

Now, my feeling is that effective enforcement of existing laws (may with a
slight extension to how weapons are stored) would be more effective than
passing new legisilation which would be to all intents bypassed.

I\'ll ignore the statistic for reasons I have said above, but otherwise I
agree with you. A sense of responsibility and duty is absent in today\'s
society. We can do things about it.

Agreed.

Some final thoughts:

My original post should have been reconsidered in the light of the
likelihood that someone would misread it and go off half cocked. The
thought behind it was to highlight a similar problem resolved in different
ways. Admittedly, I find the banning of the clothing etc sublimely
ridiculous (if it wasn\'t serious) compared to what I see as a more
practical approach. I don\'t necessarily think that the UK\'s approach will
work in the US. At best you could tighten how guns are held - they\'re too
widespread to remove the problem of nutters through a ban. I know some
would see this an invasion of their liberties (a true liberal position) but
is there a responsibility you owe society? That\'s something you have to
decide yourself.

From an outsider\'s perspective the argument appears to be based around a
very old document written in a period of war and its aftermath, combined
with a focus on the rights of the individual against the rights of society.
You may not like that, but that\'s how it comes across. And I believe that
the quote \'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one\'
is appropriate. But fundamentally, whatever solution arrives has to be your
own.

Now, on to the point assumed: Several respondants assumed that I wanted a
ban on handguns. I didn\'t, but I wanted a better control system to be
legally adopted (such as locked cabinets). Of course this may be almost as
bad in the eyes of some people, but at least it keeps pistols available for
use. If you still feel a need for a weapon to protect yourself, should you
not consider what it is that makes society such that you have this need,
and the ways to effectively prevent this (as opposed to curing it with the
use of prisons and fire against fire)?

No doubt I\'ll get a few flames for this, but feel free to send them to my
home address (dom@cybergoths.u-net.com) not the TML.

I\'ve always been fond of TNE\'s (duh!).  :-)   Based off\'ve mass and already 
takes tech level into account.  Different types of vehicles will have very 
different masses (tanks, warships mass much more than ground cars and 
transports and traders, etc).  

Couple w/ the wear value rules, I think this works for very well, though i 
have only the required MP to prevent all mishaps.  It\'s when that\'s not done 
that things start to go wrong... : )  Also decided that a m3 was needed for 
each maintenance point for a full year of maintenance supplies (lubrication, 
spare o-rings, etc).

I wouldn\'t go below a 2 Iron.  Its impossible to hit anything with

But what happens if you win the ship in a poker game (or floating in

You simply have the honoree in simulated power armor:  the armor is real
(with selected perforated joints to allow said substance to leak in),
the power pack is simulated (except for about a five-minute charge to
enable the honoree to get into the capsule).  The air supply is real,
and thus helps keep the cherry from choking.

Hotel systems consist of a lot more than toilets. But that\'s beside the
point, which is: Even on modern automated (U.S.) Navy ships the engineering
systems, Gas Turbines, generators, water purification systems, etc require a
lot more maintenance than weapons. The reason has to do with how they\'re
used. The main propulsion system is used 24/7. As is the power distribution
system, the potable water system, the waste system.  The weapons are used
for a couple of hours strait during training or combat. They just don\'t take
the abuse the rest of the systems do.
I would point out that this is not true for combat aircraft, which are
heavily maintenance intensive.
And by the way. The Supply department, which does nothing but see to the
needs of the crew (and procure repair parts for maintenance) outnumber the
guns and missile guys too.

Obtrav: I see no reason why spacecraft should be any different. Especially
commercial spacecraft. Man the weapons while on the way to the jump point.
Maybe a few days. Get attacked by a Corsair. Fight for a few hours. Kick
their butts. Jump. Spend a week in jumpspace. Man the weapons while on the
way from the jump point. Dock at Regina Highport.

Wear and tear on the systems: Power systems 12 days+ use, Life Support 12
days+ use. Sensor systems 5 days+ use. M drive 5 days use. J-drive
(depending on your idea of how it works) 7 days use. Weapons 3-4 hours use.
What systems do you think will need the most maintenance?

In FF&Sv2, they are discusswed on page 57, and included in Table 136
(page 99).  According to Table 136, they are available at TL 20.

I\'ve been avoiding this thread, too, as it is not germaine to Traveller, so
I\'ll be brief. The reason I even respond to this comment is that I hear
this argument all too often from gun proponents on this list. 

Here goes: If you (and I mean that in the generic sense; not just you,
Gary) really believe that two students with machetes and knives could have
done the damage that those two did in Littleton, you are too deluded to own
a firearm yourself. I won\'t even get into how ridiculous it is to compare
knives with firearms other than to say this assertion is just plain stupid.
If you must come up with an argument to justify your ownership and love of
firearms, find a better one than this. Let\'s get serious, folks.

\'Nuff said. I will cease wasting our collective bandwidth on such
non-Traveller nonsense.

Try calling my FLGS, Little Wars, at (225) 924-6304.  They have at least
some of what was on your list.  Tell them John Groth told you to call
(you won\'t get any special discount, but I want them to thank me next

	America had virtually unlimited firearm ownership for a very, very 
long time without kids going berserk.   The gun laws have recently gotten 
more restrictive in the last 40 years or so and the violence has increased 
(not assesrting any cause and effect!  far from it).   So, there must be some 
societal cause behind the change in violence,  heck 50 years ago riflery was 
taught in schools and hordes of children learned shooting at home, with 
little or no catastrophe attached.   So from a foreign perspective the guns 
seem obviously the whole explanantion, but from a historical American 
perspective, they clearly aren\'t "the cause", and we object to giving up our 
liberties  because of the evil of a minority.

Just because it was first invented around 1080-90 dosen\'t mean it has to be
TL 16. It just has to be an entirely new idea. THe reason that those
capacitors can\'t be built in the Spinward Marches could be the simple one
that the manufacture is still a secret, or at the very least still owned

Oh, I want it to be very canon. It is my hope that Loren will run the GT
universe as being identical to the OTU until one single event that
constitutes the divergence point. That way anything mentioned in GT 
would be useful background material for the OTU unless it was linked
to the special changes introduced by the divergence.

Yep, you are right there. Even I must admit, that the style (fashion and
public appearance)
of the nazi regime were the coolest looking. They were designed to impress
people.
It is no wonder that even today, Science Fiction Films model future regimes
dresses like the Nazis. Just look at "Verhoevens Starship Troopers".
This however does not mean one agrees with their politics/policies.

I think it´s sad that the media reaction to this incident was "Oh, they
were wearing black trenchcoats, so they must have been weirdoes!". 
Loads of people I know wear them, but none are prone to shoot people. It´s
just another quick solution/scapegoat born by the desire to see everything
black/white.

Exactly! I mean I´d like to own guns, but they are restricted in Germany
and I agree to this policy, because I know that if I had free access to
guns, everybody else would have, too. 
And there are elements of society which should not be able to get guns this
easily. But detecting them before they go on a rampage is nigh impossible.
So I agree, that while guns are not "The Problem" (Guns are never bad by
themselves, just the uses to which they are sometimes put), free access is
just to dangerous.

And, bringing this back to the Topic of this ML, this is why most worlds
IMTU, restrict weapons according to their law level, and sometimes (if i
feel the government or Pop-level warrant it) even more so.
How do you see these restrictions enforced in the Imperium?

This is a very dangerous argument.  At what point do we restrict something
as _potentially_ dangerous?  Many more people die in car accidents than
ever do from guns, but we don\'t ban cars.  After all "Sure people want
them, but free access is just too dangerous," sounds silly in that context
doesn\'t it?  

Note that I am not advocating totally free access to guns.  I think certain
safeguards and restrictions are needed, just like you need a license to
drive a car.  But I do feel that the restrictions we currently have in the
US, let alone the ones in most of Europe, are far too severe, and generally
poorly thought out.

It really is compared with needing a licence for gun possession (like a
driving license, but including a thourough background check), starting with
small caliber and needing more licenses which are harder to get as you move
up the line. At some point you need to proove that you need them (for
hunting, sport (only in approved clubs) etc.)
First time i held a gun in my hands was at age 19, during my tour of duty
in the german Air Force. Never had one since. 

Crime Rates:
Well you might say that the crime rate has risen everywhere gun possession
has been banned or restricted, but compare to the general level of crime /
population and the US of A still is in one of the top spots. So you might
say, violent, gun related crime has risen in response to legislation, but
it is still lower than in the most peaceful state of the US.

And about the percentage increases:
When in one year 10 people are killed and in the next 30, you have a 300%
increase. Sounds much, but this just might be unrelated to any legislation.
Maybe that year more people had it coming.

Well, I got out in late \'96, and at that point, tacking on a Crow was
basically nonexistent, and you only did it to friends, and then gently.
Which is a lot different from when I made 3rd, and had a softball sized
lump on my arm, and could barely move it (basically thanks to two people).
Of course my chest still hurts when I think about the CO pinning on my ESWS
pin (late 80\'s)!

The downside of all these changes are a less efficent, less behaved Navy.
On the last Ship I was on the junior personnel had no respect for senior
personnel, and were just as likely to mouth off as do what they were told.
It used to be, you were told what to do, and you did it.  Now they expect
to be told why you want them to do something.  If you can\'t get any backing

While not claiming to speak for the entire U.S. American population, let me
try to answer this for our overseas members.

Throughout our(U.S.) history Americans have felt that the less government
there is the better. We gain our independence from England because Colonist
took their personal firearms to war and beat the professional soldiers of
the British king.  As we moved west we used our guns to feed our families
and protect ourselves from the Mexicans in Texas, the Indians in the West,
and the bandits in the badlands.  Americans have always felt that by owning
their own guns they could overthrow a dictator if one should come to power,
or defend themselves and their family should a criminal attack their home.

The fact that almost everything that I just said is based on untruths has no
bearing on the subject. France provided real military weapons to
Washington\'s Army. U.S. citizens stole Texas from Mexico and most of the
Indian lands. Someone with a 38 cal. handgun could no more stop a platoon of
Army soldiers armed with M-16\'s and motor support than someone with sticks.
BUT many people think or feel all of what I said is true.  They want to
think that they can stop a hostile government or criminal if they have a
weapon. It\'s part of Americans\' need to be in control of their destiny.
They will always believe that they can take care of themselves rather than
trust someone else, like police officer of soldier, to do it for them.

Interesting. The option of paying more for a ship should certainly be
clarified in
some Traveller supplment, for people who don\'t own "Vehicles".

This helps a little, but because of the sqrt(purchase) scaling doubling the
price
would only reduce the maintenance to 16 hours or so, still not very good for
a
one-man crew...

Classic GURPS problem, I suppose. Still, putting in some kind of TL modifier
might
not have been a bad idea (for example, modern cars take much less
maintenance than
their primitive ancestors...)

   Blades don\'t jam nor do they need reloading.  They can get stuck between
ribs,
which why slicing to bone and lifting is taught in sabre.  Knife (and
machette) wounds
bleed a huge large amount.  This is very dangerous.  Shock sets in real fast.
   At distances under 3 meters, a foe with a blade (think Traveller blade
here, big end
of bowie knife, small end of machette) is at least, if nor more dangerous
than a firearm.
Just ask any LEO or serious MA who has done disarm drills with simulated
weapons 
(squirt guns & chalk covered practice knives).

  I aways like to tweak RPG melee rules to add damage with skill level.
You really,
really don\'t want a skilled Escrimador coming after with a knife.  Your
arms will be cut
to the bone multiple times before you blink twice. You\'re down on the
ground in shock
real soon after that.

  Oh ya, pipe bombs.  Way easy to make.  Triple that if you live in a state
or near 
the border of state where fireworks are legal.  A stop there, a hardware
store, and a
DoD manual released via the FOIA and you have some nasty, nasty AP weapons.

  When I play in modern era games at Cons (such as Merc:2000, Dark Con or
Torg),
I like to bring a US Cav catalog and a couple of DoD manuals.  I\'ve shocked
a couple
of GM with what is publically available and dangerous.  Of course the GMs that 
were ex-military were no suprised and generally had a few ideas of their own...

From your original list, I\'m pretty sure they have CSC and Starships
(though why you would want Starships is beyond me...).  They also have
some of the other T4 items.  They even still have some TNE items,
including at least two copies of FF&S.

For the other items, try Titan Games:

http://www.titan-games.com

They\'ve hooked me up in the past, and I expect them to do so in the
future.

Finally, try Sword Worlder\'s Web site (I don\'t have the URL off-hand,
but Sword Worlder is a regular poster to TML.)

Ok, just a question: What\'s wrong with the T4 Starships book?  (I don\'t
have it, and have only glanced through it briefly.  My impression was that
other than the art it was ok...)

While someone with a 38 cal. handgun could no more stop a platoon of
Army soldiers armed with M-16\'s - I\'d venture to say that several thousand
experienced hunters armed with 30-06\'s would do more against a platoon
than someone with a stick.  Check into the number of deer hunting licenses
purchased in the U.S. each year.  A number of states sell over a MILLION
deer licenses per year.  the count of U.S. Hunters with scoped rifles is
staggering.  While they may not be as effective as a soldier... they
vastly outnumber them.

It would also fit with older Traveller material, where crew were linear
with the size of the system. Maybe we could get this made official for GT?

As well, a single large system (like a spinal weapon) is added as a really
_big_ module, so you can use the sqrt formula without much problem.

IIRC, you\'ve already calculated that bays are reasonably covered with 2
crew, so it\'s only spinal mounts and screens that we need to calculate.
Spinals are a single big module, so no problem. Screens however grow as
many small modules. A formula?  Ignore?  A rule-of-thumb?

we like hear the leader of our country saying to the Serbians: \'We\'re going
to bomb you and kill you until you stop killing people.\'  But the
government can\'t admit that, because then they\'d have to blame themselves
instead of someone else."

Exactly why, IMTU, no one walks around a starport with much in the way of

There is violence among the urban poor, but it doesn\'t hit the news. Half a
dozen years ago I was talking to a chap who taught in Detroit. He told me
that high school sports in his earea take place without audiences or
advance notification of location, because of the drive-by shootings.

A friend in the police force here tells me that the cops have more problems
with upper-middle-class kids than poor kids, on a per capita basis. More
money, more access to drugs and other stuff, less parental supervision and
involvement, and better lawyers when they do get caught.

Purely anecdotal, and I can\'t vouch for the Detroit story. Still, food for
thought.

Hm. And according to the latest issue of Le Monde Diplomatique, while New
York was trumpting the success of its  "Zeo Tolerance Policy", violent
crime in other cities without such a policy was falling at the same rate.

Digging back deeper, in Roman history you can tell how widespread
corruption was by how many laws against corruption were enacted. The worse
the corruption, the more laws were passed against it. The laws were a
response to the situation, not the cause of it. (And tended not to work,
too, because the whole political system depended on patronage, but that\'s a
different issue.)

The lesson here is: correlation is not causation.

	I thought long and hard before answering this.  There is only semi OT in
my opinion since there are always going to be groups in a universe that are
blamed when something goes wrong.  Gun owners in this country care as much
( if not more) than anyone when something like this happens.  The only
difference is people have come to expect if an atrocity occurs more rights
will be lost.   It\'s already against the law to make/posess pipe bombs.
It\'s already against the law to have a shotgun with a barrell under 16".
(Assuming a lack of a proper FFL &/or permit ) The criminals don\'t obey the
law.  That is what makes them criminals.  Why should we penalize the law
abiding citizens for the actions of a very small minority of criminals?
You will never keep weapons out of the hands of a determined criminal.  A
better solution would be to find out what causes most of these people to
commit evil and either prevent them from trying or to stop them before they
can do any harm.  It might be best to either increase the number of armed
guards or allow responsible adults to carry as a preventive measure.  

									Andy

(BTW, gungeek is an offensive loaded term in my opinion.  If you want to
call the two killers evil I won\'t object.  Just don\'t try to put them in
with the vast majority of gun owners.  We don\'t want them any more than you
do!)

Hmmm, this harks back to the space- vs atmospheric fighter debate!

Maybe here is a reasonable example of how a multi-role TL 15 atmospheric
fighter could be more capable than a specialised TL 15 space fighter. And
probably shows how it would cost more.

On the list for GT: Starships. More discussion wasn\'t appropriate for FT,

I mis-spoke (VE2 not handy at work). VE2, p. 204:

"An entire vehicle may be defined as being "cheaply made" at one-half cost.
This gives a permanent -1 to HT, and means that /twice/ the vehicle\'s
unmodified cost is used when calculating maintenance interval.

"An entire vehicle may also be defined as being "finely made," for 4x cost.
This gives a permanent +1 to HT, and means that only /one-quarter/ the
unmodified cost of the vehicle is used when calculating maintenance interval.

"Finally, at 20x cost, an entire vehicle may be "very finely made," which
gives +2 HT and means that only 1/20 unmodified cost is used when
calculating maintenance interval!"

The rule in FT is an extension of this one at the low end: i.e., a used
vehicle at 50% price has the same effect as one "cheaply made" but brand
new. How does 12 hours of maintenance per day sound?

Presumably, one could buy a "finely made" scoutship used, and would cut the
resulting maintenance in half.

Check out the module tables in GT. The TL12 modules are cheaper *per unit
performance*. If you design a ship with the same statistics at TL10 and
TL12, the TL12 will be cheaper and therefore require less maintenance. It\'s
just that the difference is usually invested in greater performance
instead. Not perfect, but present.

You miss my point. I\'m not talking about trained hunters armed with
bolt-action hunting rifles, but about urban weenies, who purchase a handgun
at Guns-Are-us, and probably have shot two dozen rounds their whole life.
Their marksmanship ability is probably on a par with those kids in Colorado.
Thank goodness. The best thing about that mess is what bad shots they were.
A competent gunman could have killed a hundred people in the time they had.
Luckily they weren\'t. Too ban their shooting wasn\'t worse.

I hadn\'t thought about this... but what\'s stopping someone from stealing
another persons idea? The imperium is so large... it would be hard to keep
tabs on who\'s trying to sell what. Even if the manufacture of drop tanks is
a secret... it shouldn\'t be too hard to reverese engineer one and figure it
out. ...and even though the idea is owned by the inventor who lives, say on
capital. He wouldn\'t know that someone is the Spinward Marches was using his
idea. and even if he did find out... he wouldn\'t be able to do much about
it.

Just an interesting thought... could make an interesting adventure. Guy
hires the group to find out who\'s stealing his ideas and stop them...

So, you\'re planning to set up a series of "Gas Stations" along a set
corridor into this region of space.  My question is, just how effecient is
a "Jump Tanker"?  It could be a total logistical nightmare trying to set up
string of fueling stations if you have to go very far.  The cost of your
fuel for the run will be astronomical, and as a result it will cost a small
fortune to make the trip just one way.

Has anyone ever done any calculations as to what such a setup would take?
Be interesting.  I know the Imperium has a secret route through the "Claw",
that at least partially makes use of hidden fuel depots.

Thats the idea, as there will most likely be a wide area (10+ psc) that have 
no stars.
What I\'m thinking of is using something simular to the modules for the

Thing about it is, all the rewards for doing *anything* in CT in the published 
stuff is pretty lame.  5-10K a head is dirt cheap.  But to make the *serious* 
cash (we\'re talkin megacreds here), you either have to run a mercenary brigade 
or do spec trading.  No other choices.

I didn\'t care much for the vanilla system started in Merchant Princes &

A 5KT station is at *least* 500 MCr just for the *hull*.  Per HG, if it\'s a 
sphere, the hull price goes down to 350MCr.  You\'ll still need a basic bridge 
and some kind of power supply to run the life support system, so you get to 
add more cash to that.  This is hardly cheap.  50 triple laser turrets is 
another 150 MCr.  Figure a TL 15 power source and you can get by with a 50 ton 
reactor.  It\'ll run you 75MCr.  You\'ll need a Mod Mod 8 or *better* computer, 
which will set you back another 110MCr.  Bridge is another 100 tons for 50MCr. 
 You figure you\'ll need gunners, command crew, the whole sclemiel.  This means 
staterooms.  And of course you\'ll need small craft docking space and room for 
their crews, to scoop fuel out of the gas giant.  And purifiers.  You\'re 
already up to almost 750 MCr and you haven\'t even added life support costs.  
These are *throwaway* stations?????????  We\'re looking at a budget of about a 
*billion*, something a *government* would have problems justifying, let alone 
protecting.  System defense boats?  Last I looked, they were 350MCr or more 
*each*.

> The real benefit of the stations would be peace time trade.  And the
> occasional pre-emptive strike!

Only if the location of the station is a top secret.  First time the enemy 
gets ahold of a working nav computer from one of your starships, your secret 
is out.  They can either whack out your supply line *OR* take it over and 
choke you off.  Not tenable, either direction.

I always went with the 100 diameter rule even for ships.  A 40 meter long ship

For a billion to start with, and another billion or so for ancillary craft to

You just didn\'t think it all the way through.  Jump stations are sitting 
ducks.  *EXPENSIVE* sitting ducks.  Once you get its ephemeris, you\'ll be able 
to predict where it will be when.  This gives you an advantage.  The defenders 
will have to put up at least 6 times your availiable throwweight to defend it, 
and that\'s just on the most-likely approach vectors.  The attackers aren\'t 
limited to those vectors.

You see what I mean?  My American humor was completely lost on the
British reader.  Just two hundred or so years go by, and we really have
become one people divided by a common language.  

In all seriousness, please accept my apology for any offense.  It was

Or, for a twist, they can be hired by the rebels as training or

That\'s a good question.  I\'ve always assumed that the sector/subsector
system was a Vilani invention that\'s just been kept ever since by
subsequent Imperia.  The library data entries for "astrogation" and
"subsector" (Supplement 8:  Library Data: A-M) don\'t address this
question.  Names of both subsectors and sectors may have changed over
time.

I don\'t think they are (although the Vargr in Provence and Gvurrdon
probably are because (1) it\'s easier to swipe an existing system than to
come up with one on their own and (2) they tend to interact more with
Imperium than with their other neighbors).  Every major power probably
has its own model, but can translate its maps or the maps of the other
powers into the other models.  So when diplomats or military leaders are
discussing a region of space with their opposite numbers from other
powers, everyone can use the referents that make the most sense and are
the most familiar.

The local world is responsible for enforcing its own laws, so exiting
the starport means clearing the local world\'s customs -- which may
include metal detectors, x-ray machines, strip searches, interrogations,
or whatever law level, tech level, starport class, and all of the other
circumstances indicate.  

The Imperium is charged with enforcing law and order in the starport. 
Entering the starport involves clearing starport security.  What that
entails depends on the starport, its security needs, etc.

There are several applications. Most notably, law level (which has always 
been the Traveller default when mentioning guns).  Course, the Imperium nor 
Reformation Coalition nor any other interstellar govt (maybe the Zhos) have 
the means, the will, or the way to really enforce it.  This is much more 
appropriate than the musings on the causes of the incident in Littleton...  
IMO.  YMMV.  You hear the argument "all too often" because it\'s true.  :-)

Anyone w/ a knife could\'ve done much worse w/ just blades and perfectly legal 
and mundane chemicals, with knowledge gained from the internet (amongst other 
places).  The knee-jerk reflex is to put restrictions on guns, not that it 
would\'ve stopped this trajedy (or any others, really), but that\'ll make some 
people feel good, regardless of the actual effectiveness, but like most 
legislation and public thought on this topic (gun control), is very short 
sighted and is very aptly summed up as paranoia.

Indeed it would seem you\'re not acquainted with knives (and most likely guns, 
particularly handguns, too).  Do try to shed some light on how ridiculous it 
is. :-) 
This should be entertaining...  You do have some practical experience and 
knowledge on what you speak, perhaps?  What do you base your opinion on, 
Chris?

I knew how to do neat things w/ a knife long before I joined the Marines.  
I\'m kinda rusty, as I\'m in tanks, and if I ever get to the point where I need 
to use a knife, something is VERY wrong (even worse than if I\'d have to use 
the 9mm). 

> If you must come up with an argument to justify your ownership and love of
> firearms, find a better one than this. Let\'s get serious, folks.

I don\'t need to justify anything, much less here.  Those 2 wimps could\'ve 
easily killed 15 people with knives, homemade explosives with common 
materials, and any other number of methods that would\'ve been easily 
available to them.  Do you want me to list some?  It\'s very easy, actually.  
The thing I find surprising is that only 15 were killed, given all the bombs 
that were planted (especially the ones on the propane tanks), though it seems 
very few went off (did any?).

Of course, the reflex response from "leadership" like the President\'s is to 
restrict 18 year olds from gun ownership and to put a waiting period on 
explosives (not that I think that would\'ve affected the bombs these guys made 
anyways, especially if they had the girlfriends buy them, but i\'m not sure on 
the exact specifications of their explosives... has it been released yet?).  
Nor would any of the proposed weapons restrictions (short of the extreme 
left-wing ambititions to ban them entirely) have stopped Littleton from 
happening.  Yeah, you can be drafted for war, but let\'s not allow you to 
drink or own a handgun (not that anything will stop an 18 year old from doing 
either, anways, right?)...

Yeah, that\'s basically how it still is.  The officers and such used to know 
and would look the other way (especially Mustangs), but more and more 
commanders are being relieved and the whip is generally being cracked, 
driving it to much more discrete methods.  You have the fools who go too far, 
permanently injuring people, etc, too.  Then the really dim who videotape 
such things.  Most are pretty tame and good natured.

ob Trav.  Odds are such traditions are maintained and practiced by Solomani 
units, but what about the Vilani?  Doesn\'t seem to go w/ my conception of 
them, though they still practice jump dimming, etc.  It\'s more than possible. 
 Anyone have any ideas on Vilani "hazing?"

A lotta plots from some of the more popular Hollywierd flicks would make good adventures.

 Well, lessee.

 -"Rather" loose interpretations of the artwork when building most of the 
deckplans.
 -Scaling inconsistencies (ie. the Ship\'s Boat is portrayed inacurately (or 
not at all) in other designs where it appears as a subcraft).
 -Interesting ideas regarding living spaces, working spaces, and the passages 
between these. The Scout ship being a classic example: getting to the 
engineering spaces requires squeezing through a 0.5 meter gap between Cargo 
and some other item.
 -The three-story-tall walk-in closets the Subsidized Liner calls Cargo.
 -placement of several color plates dead in the center of the ship design 
rules.
 -questionable Traveller usefulness of those color plates.
 -questionable editing of the ship design rules.
 -the designs were done using QSDS (from the main rulebook), and as a result 
can\'t always be duplicated using the SSDS system in THIS book.
 -so little color text that this book makes MTs Fighting Ships of the 
Shattered Imperium look positively chatty by comparison (and Starships is 
about ADVENTURING ships!).
 -primitive/thoughtless layout and design (I mean, really now. BLACK pages?)
 -...

 I\'m sure others could come up with more, but my point is this: If you are a 
completist, and can find this book for <$5, pick it up. The two or three 
useable pages in this book do not warrant picking it up for more.

A noble takes a hunting party (including the PCs) to his/her private
game preserve.  While they\'re away, the commoners revolt.  A force of
commoners armed with weapons taken from the military heads for the game
preserve.  The noble party must defend the hunting lodge or a cave where
they\'re holed up, or something similar with hunting rifles and whatever
other weapons the PCs (being PCs) smuggled along for the trip -- and
their wits.  

Opportunities for role-playing abound as whoever has access to commo
tries to get help from the military (of dubious reliability), from other
world leaders (balkanized world, maybe? be creative), from the Imperium
("sorry, that\'s a matter of internal governance; we\'re obligated not to
interfere" or "we\'d like to help you, but all four Marines stationed
here are involved in guarding Imperial facilities (or the starport)"),
etc.

Suppose the inventor -- or at least the patent owner -- is a
megacorporation (which seems likely).  Megacorporations are very
vigilant about their intellectual property, and have lawyers and
investigators in every sector or even subsector who are in charge of
just that.  (See the feature article on SuSAG, LIC, in JTAS.)  The one
who stole the idea is probably also a good-sized company.  So the PCs
might be engaged as independent contractors to engage in some self-help
against the other company, or to gather evidence, as the lawyers
commence litigation.

eights that dealt with pokerhands etc. I think it was done by one or both
of the Keith brothers (a fairly safe bet, early they basically wrote the
entire journal themselves). After that adventure we started experimenting
with various poker rules for Traveller that I tend to rewrite every two
months or so. There is a slightly illegal poker championship held at a
secret location (to the public) every year. All interesting crooks and
criminals go there and declare "peace" during the event. Add a couple of
Imperial Revenue Service men, a couple of Naval Intelligence spooks and the
odd assortment of psions and you get a pretty interesting setting, all IMTU
of course.

Yes, in the future, muckracking journalism will take on an entirely new meaning.

I think you missed the point there. They were made to look like Nazis
because the film was shot to look like a fascist propaganda film. When
watching it (aside from getting totally mindboggled at the weird physics in
place - Verhoevens physics) I liked the intended similarities to Gulf war
propaganda as portrayed by the media.

Ah, but most people _need_ cars, whereas people usually do not _need_ guns!
Why allow potentially dangerous item possession to those who do not really

 Assuming total conversion, which may not be a corrrect.asumption.
But let\'s accept that for now, because that\'s a lot of energy.
Perhaps enough to warp space-time...

OK, here\'s where I sketch the solution.

For a start, it\'s not the jump drive that creates power from hydrogen.
because it\'s already been shown that the jump drive can take power from
_any_ ultra-high current source to power it, such as a black globe\'s
capacitors.

That large amount of  power must be discharged rapidly to warp spacetime and
kick the ship into jump space.
(I\'m assuming maintenance of the jump field via the lanthanum grid actually
takes relatively little power, and coming out is more a factor of the
gravity well you hit, as per the rules allowing a ship to exit J-space
before it\'s destination if it hots a rogue stellar mass on it\'s "path". )

This implies a very high current "switch" of some sort needs to be thrown
when you\'re ready to jump.

That switch, because of the amount of power involved, needs to go from open
circuit to closed in as short a time as possible, because for the duration
of the switching it will be soaking that entire potential diffference.
Taking that further, _unless_ you are going to discharge all that power in
one go, you need something capable of regulating the current equivalent of
your 3*10^21 MJ

So, the reason you can\'t power a 20,000 EP R Meson from the jump capacitors
is because the technology to regulate current at those power levels doesn\'t
exist, only the binary off/on switching technology exists.  And we can go
further, and state that the  binary switching is "once-only", like a
thyristor or SCR, i.e: we can\'t use pulse techniques to regulate it, because
we can\'t turn it off again.
without removing all the power from it or slagging the switch

So, yes, it _would_ be possible to power some (currently imaginary) factor
XXX meson gun from the single discharge of your jump capacitors, but trying
to power something as "small" as an R meson results only in a melted pile of
scrap metal where your meson gun used to be.

A nice GM might let you get one extra powerful shot out of your destructing
meson, like a detonation laser, or he might not, ruling that the meson
cooking also takes out other systems. (i.e, the rest of the ship)

Yes, this allows the possibility of super powerful single shot weapon
systems out there somewhere....

But even that could be eliminated merely by stating that no-one\'s been able
to build a weapon (so far) tthat can use all that power without slagging,
and the only reason the jump drive can handle the power is that it no longer
exists in real space at the instant it activates and takes all the
power.....

This suggests that "timing problems" of mere nano-seconds between activating
the power feed switch and the jump unit could cause a huge secondary
discharge into surrounding equipment resulting in catastrophic system
damage. (i.e: the ship blows up )

Obviously, the two switches need to be tightly ganged...

And yes, I now have this picture in my head of the ship\'s engineer throwing
one of those huge pole switches beloved of Frankenstien movies and such
(though nothing like that would be able to handle this sort of current )
<grin>

Frankly, one of the reasons I like this idea is that it emphaizes how
_dangerous_ jump drives are, because of the amount of energy  you\'re
throwing around.

And the presence of bombs in the latest incident puts the lie to that.
The news has made little mention of what *I* consider the scariest part
of the incident. The kids had placed a pair of 35 pound bombs in the
school kitchen, attached to the propane tanks used by the stoves. From
the one picture I saw, these look to be the type of tank that is ~18"
(.5m) in diameter and 3 ft (1 m) tall. 

Setting off a pair of bombs attached to such tanks would have done a
damn good job of *leveling* the school. Why they didn\'t go off, I don\'t
know. But the bomb count in the school keeps going up.

Actually, there are rituals for crossing the Equator, the Zero

may also be ones for the Arctic and Antarctic Circles.

I\'ve got it. Tradition says that for your first shore leave after
qualifying, you have to land using a personal re-entry kit. No fair
going down in the shuttle. It\'s also traditional to try to land
someplace difficult (requiring skill, say the top of a building or a
mountain peak) or annoying (say the Governor\'s swimming pool during a
party.) 

Extra status points if you can keep the Shore Patrol from proving it
was you. And even more if you can maintain your innocence *and* prove
to your buddies that you did it. :-)

Alas, free access to *information* is much harder to prevent. Much of
the stuff I know about the destructive uses that may be made of various
common chemicals came from *safety* manuals. 

So to get back to Traveller, consider the situation at higher TLs. High
school kids will be capable of making chemical and bio weapons (they
have that capability *now*). Nuclear weapons and other high tech
nasties will be possible. Ditto for genetic engineering to make even
nastier biohazards. 

Now have the characters get contacted by the local authorities to help
deal with a bunch of students who have smuggled in or recreated some
ancient weapon. Why contact them? Well, according to their service
records, they\'ve handled one of these things in the past.... :-)

There may be a 5 day waiting period for *handguns*. But not for long
arms. I was on a trip out of state, and one of the friends with me
bought a rifle during the trip. 

They can take several days for the background check, but usually you
clear during the same call that they submit the info. In my friend\'s
case, they didn\'t get an immediate response and we checked back just
before the store closed. When they called back, it turned out that
she\'d cleared in a couple of minutes, but nobody had bothered to call
the store back!

Heck, I wore USAF fatigues and flight boots, simply because we had
privileges at the local air base and they were both cheap and sturdy. 

So I expect that the kids of retired/deceased Army, Navy & Marine
personnel might be wearing fatigues both because they look cool and
because their parents can buy them cheap. 

I can see their friends wearing the Ine Givar stuff not caring, and an
impromtu game of football or the like getting reported as a "riot
between Ine Givar and Imperial supporters at a local high school".

Classic example was the columnist(?) in Washington DC a few years back.
He\'d been *loudly* anti-gun since forever. Then came the day he was
arrested for shooting a burglar. Even though gun ownership is illegal
in DC (in no small part due to his efforts and those of his allies),
*he* had one anyway, and used it.

As any witch can tell you, an object for "symbolically" cutting things
(like protective circles) isn\'t much good if it *isn\'t* sharp! The
symbolism doesn\'t work.

So an athame *will* be sharp, unless it\'s for use in a ritual that
requires a *dull* knife.

Since jump drives have been around for 10 millennia and it\'s only in
the late 1000s when the Imperium is just reaching TL16 that the
means to design jump drives that can use drop tanks becomes available,
surely assuming that the new jump drives are TL16 is more logical than
assuming that they aren\'t and no one noticed.

Even if it\'s just a TL16 widget that can be bolted onto a TL9 drive.

IMO, for the past millennia researchers have been improving jump drives,
adding an extra parsec every few hundred years when a new discovery
comes along. Finally, although controlled Jump-7 is not discovered,
high tech capacitors are invented, which will allow the use of drop tanks
and black globes. Presumably, further advances reduce the LHyd needed
(MT) and ultimately lead to antimatter and Annic Nova drives.

If "recent advances in the field of capacitor engineering" don\'t equate
to TL16 (or at least TL15), then what is the point of the TL system?

There is some canon on this about patents and such in the history of
the Vilani.  IIRC, there is rather weak patent protection, or its extremely
difficult to get one.  (I should really pay more attention to that stuff,
after all the Intellectual Property I studied in law school).  The upshot
is that there is extremely little economic incentive to innovate.  I think
that was one of the excuses given for the extremely slow technological
advancement rate of the Vilani when compared to the Solomani.
And since the 3I is still heavily Vilani in culture, much the same is true
for the 3I.

Sorry that I can\'t recall the canon references for this offhand.

As far as the scenario above goes, more likely IMO is outright
industrial espionage and sabotage.  Although, for a truly significant
item, worthy of an Imperial patent, and making a big step to the
next TL, the litigation may be allowed to proceed.

Yesterday, I was experimenting with CT chargen.  Something I haven\'t done
in a long time.  Discovered something interesting.  The Chargen rules in
Book 1 are heavily skewed towards the Army.

If you have a character that rolls only 7s (3s and 4s),
if he joins the Army, after 3 terms, he will have 9 skills.
If he joins any other career (including Navy and Marines
which can only be reached via the Draft), he gets substantially
less skills per term.

I actually went to the trouble of doing the same thing for
Mercenary and High Guard Chargen.  Dramatically better.
Only with these systems can you approach the 1.25 skills/year
average that Marc M. built into T4 and T5beta (although,
certain special schools generate lots of skills - the overall
average of all special schools was 1.8 skills per school).

If anyone is interested, I could post the results.

Its in V&V. However, I\'d actually say that the Vilani Patent system is a
lot *stronger* than Solomani (read Westminster). Firstly, patents are
held by the caste and are in perpetuity. Secondly, a Vilani patent not
only gives you perpetual rights to the innovation, but to all subsequent
developments of that innovation. It\'s this latter part that was the big
disincentive to innovation. If you came up with a bright idea based on
an already existing concept, not only could you not patent it, but you
would also be liable for a major fine and/or lengthy imprisionment for
patent violation. Thus only the caste that held a patent would try to
develop on it.

This is much less of a problem. As long as jump drives dont turn hydrogen
into energy, Ditzie wont whine about not being allowed to use them to power
Very Very Big Guns, and those people down at Maaaarketing wont ask why they
cant run Rhylanor\'s entire planetary power grid (for which 3*10^21 MW could

If this is true, then this technologies should be able to be applied to
capacitors for other high energy applications.

Please dont say that \'No-one\'s ever built a weapon that can use all that
power\' around Ditzie :) Do we still have that Lab Ship design floating
around ? Ditzie is wondering if Maaaarketing would think if there would be
a market for an armed version ...

I was thinking of this when I wrote it, but didn\'t really develop the idea.
I referred to what they put the recruit in as a "capsule" - it doesn\'t have
to be a full-fledged Drop Pod. It could be the empty shell of one of those 
throwaway decoy pods, or even a large enough garbage can. Get something
light enough so the Marines can toss it around without needing Battledress.

Your ideas need spacesuits/hardsuits, access to the Spinal tube, MMU\'s,

even simpler than you were thinking of.

Cars have a purpose other than killing: getting from point A to point B.
What purpose does a gun have other than to kill or inflict severe injury?

Take a look at the following book
The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps by
Marshall T. Savage 
Here\'s an Amazon link: 
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316771635/eclipsswebwarren/002-72260
92-9981402

He describes a rail gun built into the side of a mountain near the equator.
 The top of the mountain has lasers mounted.  You fling the capsule up via
the rail gun, then lase the chunk of ice on the bottom of the craft.
Tosses the craft into orbit rather nicely.

This a good gearhead book.

What if the fueling station is a small module, say 400dtns, floating on

The computer minimums (in HG) are an abstraction for military sensor
arrays IMO - a fueling station might want military-grade sensors if
it\'s supposed to double as an observation station, but they should be
optional - and certainly shouldn\'t be priced based on the displacement
of the fuel tanks.

Should a fuel station\'s power plant need to be big enough to provide
Power-1 to the fuel tanks? How much powered maintenance does LHyd
need in interstellar space? I don\'t know the answer to this question.

I think the computer requirements and bridge requirements for an immobile
space station should be lower than those for a warship, or even a 
commercial craft. Still, these things can get expensive.

Sorry to respond to two people in one post, but I\'m in a hurry.

Probably worth a try, when Starships comes up for playtest.  (Is someone

I lost a step in you calculation here; why do TL 10 power plants require so
much more maintenance than TL 12 plants?

We could just use the same guidelines as for maneuver drives of the same
TL.  That might be a fair rule of thumb, although there\'s no calculation to
back it up.

That was me.  I think that my calculation probably goes out the door if you
drop the square root without using some other divisor to reduce the end
result, a bay NPAW requires 110 hours per day.  That\'s bad, very bad.  The
fact that it isn\'t in constant use helps a lot, but I don\'t know how to
figure out how much.  What\'s the duty cycle for a ship\'s weapon systems (1
percent? 10 percent?)

Screens clearly need a linear figure like maneuver drives.  I picked 1/8
for dampers just to get a crew of 2-4 for the typical sized dampers(30-35
mile range is enough for almost any application) , bringing them sort of in
line with HG.  The crew of 1/100 for Meson screens was chosen to keep the
crew down to a reasonable level.  Most GT major warships need 1000+tons of
meson screen, much of it actually powerplant, so 1/1000 yielded "sensible"
crew sized in line with maneuver drives (which tend to eat up about half
the crew in warships I\'ve designed.

So will total crew size for large ships.  I just realized that my armored
cruiser design only needs about 760 maintenance man hours a day..  With a
crew of over 460, that works out to about 2 hours each, even if you
discount the officers entirely.  Recalculating the few key systems (mainly
the m-drive) using the Far Trader rule cuts the crew down significantly,
back down toward HG levels.  I\'m toying with doing this just for maneuver
drives and maybe jump drives (although the current system actually provides
fewer jump-drive techs than the Far Trader rule would imply.)

Volker, this is less a reply to your specific post
and more a reply to anyone who may try this tactic.

IMO, this is the *worst* tactic any world could
attempt. Such a world is invulnerable to *all*
effects, including _normal_solar_heat_. 

Anybody care to figure how long it takes an
Earth-like atmosphere to begin cooling without
*any* solar energy being received by the planet?
The thermal effects, I believe, are as if the planet
was instantly dropped into intergalactic space,
thermally speaking.

There\'s also the psychological effects of living
on a world which has a pitch black sky. Having alot of
lighting on the surface really won\'t help.

Worldwide BG protection = the worst of nuclear winter
effects. A small fleet can guarantee the destruction
of any world which tries this tactic simply by whatever
it takes to ensure the locals keep the field up at all
times.

Also keep in mind a BG absorbs all energy which contacts
it from inside the field as well, including all energy
radiated by the planet. I don\'t think any molten-core
world can build enough capacitors to hold the energy
(lots of ignorant assuming here). Even a white globe
can absorb the energy from near-c plus rocks
be overloaded by enough near-c rocks.

The reason why Yaskodray won the Ancients war is that
*any* static defense can eventually be overcome. Note
I said "overcome", not "destroyed".

As a referee, whenever players start coming up with
an idea like this, I simply throw physics at them and
ask them to identify and solve all the problems because
all *I* have to do as a referee is identify one problem,
based in physics, which they missed.

Of course, I\'ve lost players who didn\'t enjoy this
kind of realistic campaign but then I don\'t enjoy
refing/playing B-grade space opera. Too boring,
difficult to maintain, and leads to munchkinism.

I was talking High Guard 2nd Ed - I\'ve got to remember to identify the

Canon black globes don\'t radiate heat either so the temperature would be as
it was the black globe turn-on: in equilibrium.

The problem is that all life relies on entropy for its sustenance so the
plants cannot use IR to grow and thus in the long run the world might have
a problem.

   They don\'t *need* the cars.  They *need* better public transportation.
Cars in public hands are a actual (as oppossed to potentially) dangerous item.
Think of this way:
People really don\'t *need* fire extinguishers either...Most just sit around
and gather dust.
When you do need one, you need it right away.

Well, the deck can never be shiny enough for the First Sergeant...

As an aside; the NYCPD used to have these REALLY cool leather duty jackets. 
They switched to nylon (?) after numerous complaints that they looked like 
nazi\'s...The Mounted and Highway cops still have the high boots, jodpers, and

I still can\'t figure out why they changed shirt colors though (from sky blue

what color they used in the 60\'s...

The important word here is "skilled." It does not take as much skill to be
deadly with a firearm as it does to be deadly with a knife, however.

This is *not* to say that it doesn\'t take skill to be a good shooter. It
takes a lot of skill to be a good shooter.

What I am saying is that it is easier for an unskilled shooter to kill a
target than an unskilled knife fighter.

This is often reflected in roleplaying games. In melee combat, an attacker
usually gets only *one* attack during a round, sometimes more if the round
is particularly long (more than a few seconds) and/or the attacker is
considered to be highly skilled.

In fire combat, even an unskilled attacker usually gets several attacks in
a round, especially if the weapon is a semi- or full automatic. Add in the
fact that 1) you can attack at range and 2) most firearms are given damage
ratings equal to or higher than melee weapons, and it can be seen that
firearms are, for the most part, more deadly than melee weapons. Only in
cinematic games do you see people running around with swords in a world
with modern firearms and surviving for very long.

There *is* a reason firearms are the weapon of choice in the modern world.

This is all in my own only very slightly informed opinion (IMOOVSIO), of
course (my experience is limited to range shooting and kali practice).

When I was in the Army, we did an exercise where we deployed to a troop
ship; battalion of mechanized infantry with a platoon of airborne
intelligence troops (my team). We spent about 4 days in the Atlantic in
mild storms. There was weapon maint., some vehicle maint., review of
rules of engagement, guard duty on the vehicles, etc., etc., etc. We
spent a lot of time playing cards and reading. A *lot* of time.
 I think a troop ship in jumpspace would be a pretty boring place to be....

IMTU, which is true canon ( or true heresy, depending on your POV) (ie.
no Imperium, completely unique place, CT) 8^)  you cant get away from
Diasporan Systems adverts.  Heck, they make stuff used by almost everyone
every day.  From big stellar ore haulers, with DSI painted on the sides,
to ground vehicles, to home products.  Even one of their subsidiaries,
Gottlos Ordnance Division, provides many of the ground forces of the Gale
Confederation weapons.  Thus the Confederation Marines unofficial motto,
In GOD we trust!

There are some indications in Vilani & Vargr that sectors and subsectors originally were a Vilani invention (e.g. on p. 11 in that book, some borders between the Bureaux follow current sector borders).

Some sectors have other names in Vilani (e.g. Core is called Ukan), but we can\'t say for certain how old those names are - I would guess, though, that they originate with the Ziru Sirka.

There is at least one canon reference that subsectors change names: In TD #15, p. 31 we are told that Kerr subsector in Massilia was once called Ershur.

As a previous poster wrote, the other races probably do their astrography differently, but at least we must admit that sectors in alien realms have alien names (the sectors in Zhodani space have Zhodani names, etc.).

We know from AM4: Zhodani p. 10 that the Zhodani organize their space in something called "preqlianz", which is translated to provinces. There are subdivisions of these that seem to be very much like sectors and subsectors.

Taking into account that the Vilani system (if we accept that) of sectors and subsectors is not very logical (but it fits nicely on a page), one would suspect that other races are using other systems (personally, I would divide my maps into sqaures, or, if space was 3-dimensional, into cubes - but we all know that space is 2-dimensional). The Vilani patent of sectors and subsectors must have been pretty broad to stop someone from coming up with something better - but, hey, it worked, so why change it?

So the Third Imperium is stuck with a legacy from the Ziru Sirka, while I would suspect that most other races use squares, hexes or triangles (the Droyne seems to be pretty fond of hexes and the Zhos of triangles, if their jump grid patterns are anything to go by).

Not entirely true. Verhoeven was asked to make the a film of the book
"Starship Troopers." He absolutely despised the book though. He had grown up
in Nazi-occupied Holland and he saw the book as advocating the kind of
fascism he saw as a child. There was a distinct reason for it, and in this
case it\'s most likely not a matter of giving Hollywood too much credit.

Yes, but they are all things that can be done under the guise of routine
\'maintenance\' while a ship is in orbit.  While in game terms, maintenance is
not really covered (and from what I\'ve seen of civilian freighters, it may
indeed be restricted to a yearly overhaul), IRL maintenance is ongoing and
constant.  I can see military and paramilitary ships being surrounded by
crew going EVA while inport, not to mention the Zero G manuevers that the
ship\'s troops and assigned marines would be practicing.

Personally, I would prefer to be confronted by someone with a gun 
than with a knife.  The man with the gun knows he can kill you.  He 
knows what he possesses.  The guy with the knife doesn\'t know it 
and can therefore kill you just as easily with a good swipe, all the 
while thinking he is just wounding you.

But I am not arguing your point.  The man with the gun only has to 
pull the trigger.  But he knows what he is doing when he does so.

First rule of combat (real world) when confronting someone with a 
gun:  Stand very, very still.

First rule of combat (real world) when confronting someone with a 
knife:  Get away anyway you can.

They don\'t per se; they require more maintenance *crew*, per the rule on p.
VE75. That rule has a scaling factor which depends on TL. This is
inconsistent with the general maintenance rule on p. VE146, but I may be
comparing unlike things. [If that doesn\'t answer your question, I\'ll have
to wait until I get home to quote the relevant passages.]

That is essentially what I suggested, although I went one step further

The duty cycle arguement is a good one, and the Gunner templates in GT all

You also have to leave out medics, support personnel, etc., who aren\'t
really doing "maintenance", although it sounds like it won\'t be a problem.

Another question:

One of my Navy references contains the following:

"Sections are the basic units of the ship\'s company. Each division is
divided into three approximately equal sections (first, second, and third)
for liberty, watch standing, condition watches, messing, and berthing. Each
complete section is adequate to maneuver and fight the ship within the
limits of the personnel available. Each section, therefore, includes
adequate ratings, numbers, and qualifications to man all required stations
in emergencies, including getting under way and proceeding out to sea,
surprise hostile action, rescue and assistance, disaster ashore, etc."

Does this mean that the crew requirements in HG (say) are for full
complement, and that the ship can still function at 1/3 that number? Or are
the crew requirements minima, and a well-designed ship should include 3x
that number?

Well, my .02cr worth.

To get a certificate in FT you need a 12+ skill.  If a certified person has
to do the maintainence then a 12+ skill robotic system should be able to do
the work but for paperworks sake and responcibility someone would need to
\'sign off\' on the work.  On a scout you could have a general purpose robot
or two for the scutt work and let the captain or engineer do the sign off.
If they do not check the work it\'s their but in a sling when something goes
wrong.  On the avaerage I\'d say it would take 10% of the repair time for
elctronic eqipment to \'check behind\' another\'s repairs and 1% for mechanical
repairs (More grunt work like heavy lifting to make the repair)  This would
give the over sight person a basic skill role to deturmine if the repair was
sucessful and safe with failure meaning either that more checks mush be run
of a mistake is made either the tester thought something was wrong when it
wasn\'t or was that the device was in working order but it was not.

A crit. success would tell how to make the repair/maintainence
better/safer/faster in the future or give the reviewer a better
understanding or the repair persons nature/skill.

A crit. fail imparts very wrong information.

On the repair role itself a crit. sucess could reduce maintainence of that
system for a period of time or perminately due to fining that \'reoccuring
problem\'.  Perhaps a crit. sucess would raise the \'quality\' one level for
that system from cheap, to normal, to good, to fine, to very fine, to best
posible.  I would not alow a robotic repair system that was not sentient
this effect as they are \'expert systems\' and not capable of original thought
though they could be tought to duplicate a critical sucess on an identical
system by the person who had that insight.

Similerly a crit. fail could permanately lower the \'quality\' of a system of
induce a reocurring problem.  A robotic system probably could not cause this
type of crit. fail if it were working in it\'s area of expertese.  It would
simple \'call an operater\' rather that take a risk outside it\'s perameters.
I could have such a catastraphe if it were use to repair something it was
not designed to repair or perhaps a crit. fail could cause the robot damage.
(A power line shorted to the system case fries the robot because it was
never programed for that contingency.  Let\'s hope the crew will add that to
it\'s knowledge base after it is repaired or reset for a minor case.  If not
a \'reoccuring problem\' could go through a lot a maintence robots...

Also diferent versions of a \'electroinic maintainence level 12\' program will
aproach the problem differently and look for different things.  While unit
MRU-6 with the CRR-191 power plant software my have no problems fixing the
sticky governer valve that alway gives trouble on reentry the new THX-14
unit might halt and call operater because the valve should be replaced not
repaired because the problem will come back and the new unit requires an
operater overide to repair it instead of replace it.  The valve of course is
very expensive to replace...

Repair robot could become very interesing NPC or color back ground...

"Damn that new robot!, Meerrr, never gave us this much greaf over the
!@@#$%^^!@###ing H2 bypass valve.  He just fixed it and went on!  What is
the port athority going to say about all these maintainence overrides in the
log!"

I\'ve run a very similer senerio.  In the end I drove the PCs into a
desperate comando raid attack on the mercenaries to stop the carnage.  Their
very highly motivated civilians were dieing in droves and were perfectly
happy using suicide tactics.  I got one of the PC REALLY POed (fatherly
marine type, the player was real US army) when the group\'s long term
\'mascot\' (a 12 year old girl) got \'paitiotic fever\' and took out an enemy
baracks with a satchel charge pretenting to be a local \'joy girl\'.  She died
in the process of course.  Nothing the PC could do would stop the locals.
They had right on their side and a fanatical relious leader egging them on.
The PC could train the civys and watch them die in safety or risk it all.
They attacked the Merc\'s grounded ship with a human wave attack as a
distraction to get the PC\'s ship\'s engineer into the merc\'s ship.  He fired
the jump drives on the planet\'s surface.

For dramatic purposes I said that if he did it the right way he could cause
a power system overload that would blow up the ship (not nuclear explosion,
basicly the jump attemp tore the ship apart and threw the pieces outward).
The blast distroyed the merc base and most of their high tech. arsonal.  The
locals won soon after.

Somehow the relious leader came to a bad end during that last battle...

3 out of 5 PC died in the process.  The player replaced thier characters
with locals.  Made for some very interesting charater back grounds.

I have to admit that game was one of the best I\'ve GMed.  I was \'in the
zone\' that night and the PC were really into character.  Most of the players
were new to traveller.  Most were D&Der use to emotionless hack and slash
for fun a treasure.  I got them POed at the Mercs and the local\'s fanatic
religion and they took it from there.  It\'s rare to see a group of players
that mad at the NPCs.  Even our group\'s peace nick \'let\'s find a non combat
solution\' went postal.

I took the idea from the John Wayne movie \'The Green Berrets\' and really
played it up.  With the \'little kid\' always underfoot and trying desperately
to help the \'heros\' and \'saviors of the people\'.  I arranged for a long
seccion to finish up the senerio (to keep tention running high).  I open the
seccion with some bad battle news and desperate times for the locals, then
had the \'masscot\' overhear the PCs planing and take it on herself to
acomplish the mission they could not figure a way to do without excesive
loses.  That and the \'sermon\' the local religious leader who was rich and
would never risk himself gave afterward praising the \'sacrifice\' for the
cause, was all the PC could take.

My girlfriend was the \'peace nick\' (always is, and she is very good at it).
She figured out that the game was \'that John Wayne army movie\' just after
the mascot died.  Boy was she POed at me for blindsiding her but she took up
the part of \'Petter-son\' with a vengence.

If you can pull it off you can really get the players emotionally into this
senerio but it probably would not be wise to have prespective new gamers as
observers at the last session.  If the PCs are really into it, they can be a
bit intence and down right scary to those who have not played RPGs before.
You know you \'got them\' when they are hovering over the table, dice held
like weapons, and trying to out race each other to do violence to head bad guy.

One thing that may have contributed to the intensity of this particular game
was the the PCs were free traders that had only a bar room brawl or two in
the campain up till they were stranded on this world.  I personally think
that combat in traveller (outside mercinary campains) works best when used
like pepper.  A little dash every now and then so that when they bite into
the chile pepper it really makes an impression!

OT but anyhow...
In real world when "when [being] confronted [with] someone with a gun":
Get away anyway you can.

Statistics show that when mugged with a packing mugger they\'re far more
likely to fire at you AFTER they\'ve mugged you than before. No one knows
what goes on in your average muggers brain but my guess is something like
"If you didn\'t rob the guy why risking possible police investigation etc
with no cash reward, when the mugging is actually done you either have
something (cash...) and need to cover up a more serious crime or if the
victim had less cash than expected vent your frustration.

Also about statistics; Must gungeek morons use the argument that disarming
the citizens will only take away guns from noncriminals - not the
criminals. True - but if being robbed and the victim tries to defend
himself it is more likely that he/she will shoot himself/herself or get
shot by their own gun than being shot by the robbers gun. I\'d be more
afraid of the average gunpacking american than of your average criminal as
I\'d probably encounter one of those NRA morons a thousand times more often
than an actual criminal.

You mean before the Terrans kicked their butts in -2408 to -2219?  I\'ll
leave that to other historians on the list.

I don\'t know what happened during the Rule of Man, but the Third
Imperium\'s naval and military forces are as integrated as practicable
(especially after the Civil War and even more so after Emperor
Zhakirov\'s reign).  Aslan marines and soldiers, e.g.,  serve in their
own units because they have differently shaped hands and need
differently built weapons and other equipment from humans.  Other
Imperial races might also serve in their own units.  (The logistics of
equipping and feeding an Alien Legion -- that is, one composed of many
different species -- would be challenging, to say the least.)  

There is no objective reason (other than time-keeping; the Vilani don\'t
usually use a 24-hour clock) to separate Solomani and Vilani personnel,
so they are integrated into the same units, along with such other minor
human races as can use the same equipment as "standard" humans (Solomani
and Vilani being the standard as they are about the same size on average
and certainly constitute the majority of humans in the Imperium).  Vargr
may or may not be integrated into human units.  They can use much human
gear without penalty, but need vacc suits and battle dress designed for
their digitigrade legs (and don\'t forget their tails -- and don\'t let me
digress into personal stories about jerry-rigging tail protection on
human vacc suits) and long snouts.  

What does this mean for hazing in the forces of the Third Imperium?  I
would expect human units to engage in hazing that represents a blend of
the Solomani and Vilani traditions.  Any Vargr in the unit would just
have to deal with the culture clash -- that\'s part of being a member of
a cosmopolitan force.  Aslan would have their own hazing rituals, which
I would expect to be pretty severe and potentially dangerous.  Vargr
units would have rougher hazing, too.  

The official policy of the Imperium would be to condone hazing as long
as readiness is not affected.  Hazing is seen as boosting morale and
improving unit cohesion, as long as it is balanced against actually
injuring personnel.

Actually, I was thinking of Akira Kurosawa\'s 1954 samurai movie, not the
1960 western, but you\'re right about Hollywood providing some playable
ideas.

(Hmm... Chushingura, a movie that retells the story of the 47 ronin,
would also make an interesting campaign ....)

Why do "most people _need_ cars"?  Most people\'s transportation needs
could be served at present technological levels with publicly owned
light rail, busses, ferries, and helicopters, and privately owned
bicycles.  People want cars for a variety of good reasons --
convenience, independence, spontaneity -- but that doesn\'t rise to
"need".  

Ob Traveller:  It\'s a mark of good role-playing and immersion in the
milieu for players to ask when they arrive on a world, "what
transportation is available?" rather than, "we want to buy an
air/raft."

It\'s a great idea, but the cost of a personal re-entry kit indicates
that if you\'re caught you\'re heading for the stockade.  Also, hazing has
to apply to lots of people -- all the FNGs have to be hazed, so you
might have 50 people trying this stunt at once.

Guns have many of the same purposes as cars: intimidation (try crossing
the street in San Francisco\'s -- or Boston\'s -- financial district some
time), status/lifestyle display ("ooh, is that the new Glock/BMW?"),
giving a sense of security (the doors are locked and the stereo is on --

I\'ll answer that one.  I did not endend to post to this tread but the above
is just to much wrong head retoric.

A gun it\'s an equalizer.

It let\'s a 100 pound woman NOT be raped by a 200+ pound man.

or the cippled, sick, week, small, old

It let\'s a lone person defend his person or home or business again a gang of
criminals.

It is the object that makes wrong behavior have a real consiquence.  As long
as individual people have guns then no tyrant can be truely safe whether
that tyrant is a king or a wife beating husband.  There is always a way for
those that have been done wrong by that tyrant to make him pay the untimate
price even though it might be necessary for him to pay that price also.  As
long as this is true then those that rule will be limited by their own self
interest in the degree of atrocities they can inflict of those they rule.

All most all other weapons require strength, size, long hours of training,
or some other dificult to obtain precondition to use against a strong
dangerious oponnet.  

God made man, Sam Colt made them equal.

Only those that want to impose their will on others need to fear guns.  All
others fear those that want to impose their will on them.

That is why our founding fathers thought it had to be a protected right.
The posession of the means to protect ourselves against tyrrany is the
peoples veto power.  The last line of defense for the freedom our precessers
fought and died for.

"A person that trades some of his freedom for a little temporary safety,
deserves neither" B. Franklin.

No one is ever safe.  There is no time or place that death can not find you
but if the death that is coming your way is wearing a ski mask a gun CAN
save you.

Ask yourself this, if the teachers in that school all had guns (conceled
carry) and the will to use them how far would those two kid have gotten?  At
the very least they would have had a CHANCE to protect themselves and their
charges.  As it was they were cattle in a pin for the slauder.  They had no
chance...and that is what happens sooner or latter anywhere people a not
allowed the means to protect themselves.

Saddly, at the end of 1997 in  Myanmar  (formerly  Burma)  a  man
entered a school and killed 10 children and 2 adults.  He used  a
machete, and was alone.  Although this runs contrary to what  you
or I might expect, this demonstrates  that  the  2  in  Littleton
could have theoretically killed 20 kids and 4 adults without  the
use of firearms!  (And this is before we  consider  nasty  little
devices  made  from  gasoline  and  washing-up  liquid.)  Banning
firearms does not solve the underlying problem ... and thus  does
not prevent future occurances of tradgedies like these.

Try this:

A black-globe equipped vessel misjumps and is precipitated out of
jumpspace near a black hole. The vessel cannot escape the gravitational
pull of the object, and so instead rides the accelleration curve around
it, spiralling in, faster and faster, until at the last moment (when the
gravitational force becomes too great) they crank up the black globe and
go zipping off in a straight line away from the black hole! When they
figure they have moved far enough away, they drop the globe.

This would be a cool way for a research vessel to get close to a black
hole and then escape, too.

Also, if the volume within a black hole is immune to gravity, is it also
immune to time dilation from travelling near light speed?

Well, in the abstract you have a good point.
But, WRT Army, (sticking with the rolling only
3s and 4s metaphor - admittedly not scientific),
I\'ll take the results, even rolling on all available
skill tables (for EDU 7), doubling up on Advanced
Education Table:

Rifle  (Army enlistment)
+1 Endur (first term)
Gambling (first term)
Fwd. Obs. (commission)
SMG (Army Lieutenant)
Blade CBT (promotion)
Electronics (second term)
Tactics (promotion)
Electronics (third term)
Tactics (promotion)

Final result (after 5 muster rolls):
UPP  778797
Army Major
Electronics-2, Tactics-1, Rifle-1, SMG-1, Blade CBT-1,
Fwd. Obs.-1, Gambling-1
Gun
Cr20,000
(+2 Edu)
- ----
Same guy as Marine (via draft)
Cutlass (Marine enlistment)
+1 Endur (first term)
Blade CBT or Gambling (first term)
Electronics (second term)
Tactics (third term)

UPP  778787
Marine enlistee
Cutlass-2 (or) Cutlass-1 & Gambling-1, Electronics-1, Tactics-1

Blade
Cr15,000 (or Cr30,000 if Gambling instead of Blade CBT)
(+1 Edu)
- ----

Not hard to see the imbalance there.  FWIW, the only difference
in skill accessibility between the Marines and the Army is:
Vacc Suit (Marines) and Air/Raft, and +1 Edu (Army).

The way I\'ve formulated it, with rolls of 3s and 4s only (7s for 2D),
the Army character is superior for shipboard activity in almost
all respects.

As you pointed out earlier, an all-average person will seldom become

Incorrect; the BG absorbs all energy being radiated from 
the planet, so the planet will continually lose heat as
it radiates IR. If the BG were instead a perfect mirror,
then the planet would stay warm a while.

Designs are broken under SSDS and QSDS. Art is lousy (CT had better). SSDS
needs errata to work properly, and the colour plates in the middle of the
design sequence are really badly placed.

In its defense - it makes a good emergency mousemat.

IMTU, those big cheap fuel tanks wouldn\'t last for decades.  They\'re

day or two.

It wasn\'t power to the *fuel* under discussion, it was power to the 150 beam 
lasers that was mentioned.  And of course 50 tons dedicated to fire support, 1 
ton for each turret.

Not by HG rules.  The station qualifies as a non-starship, and is thus covered 
by, and must conform to, the rules.

Need cars?  Why not take a bus?  And if you really do _need_ a car, surely
you can apply to the government for a special permit, after demonstrating
acceptable need.  After all, it\'s a small price to pay for everyone feeling
safer...  

Many people feel that they _do_ need guns, for self defense, if nothing
else.  Personally, I\'d want to (and do) have a firearm at home to defend
myself against an intruder.

Not by HG rules.  The station qualifies as a non-starship, and is thus covered by, and must conform to, the rules.

The HG rules are specifically designed to create warships, and have
some abstractions in them. 

I think it\'s fine to have a 400dtn space station module keeping an eye
on a couple thousand tons of immobile fuel tanks. YMMV.

You are, of course right, in that the purpose of a gun is to kill.
However, it\'s proper purpose is to kill in self defense, not in murder.
Just like a car used as a murder weapon is an otherwise legal object being
used in an illegal fashion, so IMHO is a perfectly legitimate gun being
used in an illegal way.  It\'s that use of the gun that should (and is) be
illegal, not the gun itself.

When I took Kenpo Karate several years ago, part of the curriculum was
weapon disarms.  It\'s much, much easier to disarm a gunman than a knife
wielder.  Once I learned the techniques, I could take a gun away from
someone before they pulled the trigger about nine times out of ten.  With a
knife, you almost always get at least some cuts (usually to the forearm).
And this is against a _trained_ victim.

IMHO, Far Trader is the best GT book written so far, and one of the best
GURPS books in general that I\'ve seen.  Definitely worth getting, for any
genre.

What do you get in return? Well, besides the immortal fame of your name in
the credits, the adoration of your peers, and my undying gratitude, the top
twenty contributors (determined by me) will receive two complimentary
copies of the finished sourcebook; all other contributors and credited
playtesters will receive one copy.

I look forward to working with you.

Nope, they were native, but evolved from one of the nastier carnisaurs.
They needed losts of room.  They also excelled in biosciences, and were
able to take thousands of species with them as preserved fertilized ovum.

As an employee of that there department you mentioned, I can
answer that question - this was part of Giuliani\'s makeover; the
cops are supposed to look intimidating, and with the powder blue
shirts, they looked like Mr. Goodwrench or your local janitor,
not a cop that needs to be respected.  Also, food stains don\'t
show up as well on the dark blue as on the Goodwrench shirts
(although dandruff and jelly-donut powdered sugar are another
issue).

Most of the force went with it; there was a noticeable
improvement in morale and in "keeping spiffy" when the dark blue
came in.  It\'s even made a difference for the civilian members;
when the uniforms changed over, a lot of civilian MOS started
wearing more formal, businesslike, clothing to work.

ObDisclaimer: The New York City Police Department allows me to
have my own opinions.  Since they do, and I do, I don\'t post
theirs.  Besides, I pay for this account with my own money.

There is a cheaper solution:

a small core base with the fuel in drop tanks. A 5KT drop tank is 5MCr.

Unfortunately, you\'re not supposed to put 50 laser turrets on it. ;-)

Another benefit is that you only need a crew, bridge and such systems
according to the mass of the core ship. The drop tanks are not included
in the High Guard calculations.

Those "disposable tanks" are only disposed of if someone activates
the explosive bolts. It is perfectly possible to perform a successful
jump with one attached.

I liked the light blue shirts; especially the short sleeved summer uniform. 
It was comfortable, even with a ballistic vest underneath it...

I would have figured the PBA wouldn\'t have been happy, as all the police 
officers would have to have purchased new shirts. At a minimum of five (two 
summer, two winter, and one dress...), it\'s expensive, or has the city 
finally agreed to buy uniforms and weapons instead of just giving an 
inadequate uniform check. My first year, my equipment cost $3500 US dollars 
in 1986...

Ob Trav: Here\'s what I bought roughly, so you could use it for NPC\'s, or 
maybe in the ship\'s locker

weapons:

service revolver: $200 (now $400)
off duty   "             "             "

Uniforms:

Winter Dress Uniform (Coat and Trousers)

Summer Dress Uniform (Light Weight coat) Note: Full dress just used for 
funerals, parades, and promotion ceremonies

Dress Uniform shirt (Note: the shirt and trousers are used with both dress 
jackets) 
These were tailored....

Street Uniform:

Duty Jacket (neat coat- It had a removable dayglow orange inner liner that 
said POLICE on the back. You removed it for warm weather, and just wore the 
jacket shell). You skipped the whole thing in summer....

at least two pairs of uniform trousers (I bought four; two lightweight, two 
winter)

at least four pairs of uniform shirts (two winter longsleeve, two summer 
shortsleeve. I think I had three each)

dark blue or black socks

civilian underwear (added for completness...)

two pairs of uniform shoes (one pair of black patent leather, one pair of 
black sneakers. The patent leather get worn with duty or dress uniform; 
sneakers just for duty)

uniform hat (worn with duty or full dress. Note: I could have gotten a 
baseball cap for duty wear, but I hated them as unprofessional...)

dark blue wool sweater to cover the neck in winter (worn under duty jacket)

winter hat with earflaps (I hated this too, but wore it when I was on foot in 
the winter)

rain coat, and rain hat cover.

Uniform trousers and shirts are dry cleaned...

Accessories:

Body Armor (bullet resistent vest)

Black Beasketweave leather Pistol belt with:
belt, revolver holster, handcuffs and case (one pair required; most cops 
bought two), radio and holder, MACE (chemical spray) and holder, flashlight 
and holder, nightstick (baton/club) and holder, keychain holder, reload 
holder (contained two revolver speedloaders), rubber glove pouch.

concealed carry/off duty holsters for both revolvers
off duty ID and badge holder
black leather ticket and memo book holder
white gloves for parades
whistle
two boxes (100 rounds) of ammo (minimum every 6 months to requalify; I shot 
once a week).

Note: today substitute a semiautomatic pistol (Glock 19 for NY) for the 
revolver. Add three magazines to equipment list...

Hope this helps a GM...

Probably depends on the socio-political outlook:
The need for a gun is less urgent here as most people do not have guns, 
and violent crime is not as prominent in the news. Most of us feel perfectly 
safe without a gun.
Americans on the other hands, have always had guns, so the entire outlook
is different.
If everyone has them or could get them very easily (and waiting a week is
easy compared to our system) we would probable feel the need to arm
ourselves as well.

Please do us all a favor: 
1) Go out, get T4 : Starships. 
2) Look at it over and over again.
3) Now you know what NOT to do, write the book.

Seriously, try to base the book more on MT´s SOM by DGP in style.

i always hated guessing that one bit of information), more in text than in

I would wish for it to be a good read rather than a reference book

Thank you.  

Isn\'t it a shame the Traveller temperature range formulae are so difficult,
and based on stuff like orbits?

The GURPS approach might actually be better, for most purposes.

This is the same source I was looking at, except I decided to \'disbelieve\'
it for a moment.

It also mentions Soegz, the Vargr that became Archduke of Antares, was one
of her subordinates, and obviously a very important one.
 
Rebellion Sourcebook (IIRC) mentions that Dulinor\'s brother was some honcho
Admiral of the Illelish fleet.  While this may have been arranged as part
of Dulinor\'s plot, it may also suggest a situation where the civil and
military authorities are sometimes both controlled by the same noble
families.

In this case, it would be plausible for Arbellatra to be a relative, or
heir, of the Sector Duke of the Marches, or one of the other major Dukes. 
This suggests, incidentally, an Alkhalikoi (sp?) connection to the Marches,
or at least Deneb, which may still exist.

Political appointees of this sort aren\'t necessarily disasterous, as long
as they have good subordinates, like Soegz, and the good sense to follow
their advice, at least until the appointees get a bit of a grip on the
rudiments of strategy.  

> and of course, the Templars were involved somehow.

Well, if you think about the networks and intrigues that run through the
Imperial nobility, this comment isn\'t actually totally silly.  The Imperium
pretty much is run by unaccountable families, cliques and factions. 
There\'s not just one Conspiracy, there\'s lots!

with what has gone before...

When a black globe absorbs energy, it sends it to capacitors attached to
the BG generator.  Thus a world surrounded by one would send heat into the
BG and thus into the capacitors where it could be turned back into heat. 
Likewise with solar energy coming in from outside.  In fact, I can imagine
it being fairly hard to overload one of these things, as they\'ve got the
entire planet to act as a heat sink (I\'m thinking of a rockball world
with heat sinks running deep into the core). 

The big problem, of course, is building one this big.  Standard BGs are
cutting-edge TL-15/16 and these can cover only a ship.  Depending on the
principle of operation, making one bigger could be very difficult or
impossible. 

Someone else mentioned that turning a BG on while on the surface makes for
big problems because of energy absorbed from the atmosphere.  I\'ve often
wondered about this:  How much energy would the BG be absorbing under
various circumstances?  On the day-side of Mercury I can see things going
very badly, but what about a nice 20 C day on earth?  What about the dark
side of an airless rock?

I had an adventure once where a landed ship turned on its BG to repel
attackers.  Some got in before it came on and a very cool (forgive the
pun) battle ensued as the two sides duked it out inside the heat-sucking
BG. I described the atmosphere freezing to the globe and sheets of solid
oxy/nitro falling from the ceiling.  Not sure if that\'s realistic, but it
was picturesque... 

Another thing I\'ve wondered about:  What sorts of energy does a BG absorb?
If it absorbs kinetic/heat energy with perfect efficiency, then it
violates entropy, turning disorganized energy into organized energy in the
form of electricity stored in the capacitors.  If it doesn\'t absorb heat
with perfect efficiency, where does the stuff it doesn\'t absorb go?  Is it
deflected?  Is it converted into heat which radiates from the BG in all
directions?  Or what?

Just some thoughts...

And on that note, please have lot\'s and lot\'s of pictures.  All sorts of
them.  Deckplans, rendered shots (No amount of Jesse DeGraff\'s art is too
much...) line drawings, whatever.  I\'d really like to see at least one
exterior shot and one set of deckplans for each ship.  

The way I game, a ship description with no illustration is almost useless.
I like to be able to show my players what the vehicle looks like.

A minor nits to pick.  AK-47 type weapons are not illegal or banned.  Even
the full auto examples are not illegal.  There are rules regulating them.
Flash hiders, pistol grips, normal stocks, and bayonet lugs, all EVIL as
pronounced by the Clinton administration.  The semiauto clones have to
follow the Brady Law.  Further, 30rnd mags are not banned either, you just
can not manufacture or import them anymore.

ah, but the capacitor banks for the jump drive use Zuchai crystals, as
nothing else can hold such an amount of energy and release it
correctly.  To discourage use of such crystals for weapon capacitors
is to handwave that after discharging they require about a week for
the crystal structure to re-align before being capable of charging up
again.  So *maybe* one big shot a week *if* the rest of the weapon can
handle the power surge.....

How are you handling some of the inconsistencies in the modules presented
in GT?  Some of them have resisted attempts to reverse engineer, and will
thus not make sense next to alternately developed modules.  

My personal recommendation is to throw them out and redo from scratch, this
time carefully disclosing exactly what goes into each module.  I realize
you may not be allowed to do this by the powers that be....  OTOH, AR1 did
contradict  GT in several cases (the Vargr package is different, the costs
of Psionics are different...)  so maybe it\'s doable after all.  I realize
that this would involve duplicating a lot of work, but I for one would be
quite willing to help out.  

On that note, please feel free to use any of the modules posted on my web
site.  Also, I have a fairly good beam weapons module design spreadsheet,
and if you\'d like, I can e-mail it to you.  It\'s currently in Excel \'97
format, but I can try to convert to any other format you\'d like.

Separate question:  On your web site you have the request from the IN
author.  I\'ve worked up a GT conversion of AHL.  Do I send it to you, or to
the author directly?

From the few clips I\'ve seen of \'Seven Samurai\', it makes me want to learn 
Japanese so I can enjoy it in the original.

Did they ever release a dubbed or subtitled version of \'The Potempkin\'?

But will they appreciate the fact that you had better have some
high Soc to get promoted, and high Edu to even get commissioned?
Interesting when compared to Navy where Soc assists commission
effects promotion.

The implication is that high ranking Marines are well connected,
but high ranking Navy are well educated.  I would have expected
it to go the other way, based on the military people I know.

Book 1.

Books 4 and 5 get much closer, and sometimes exceed,
the 1.25 skills per year average built into T4 and T5beta.
I\'ll double check, but I think with those advanced systems,
you could conceiveably get 2 skills/year for 24 skills in
3 terms.

What this experiment showed me is that Traveller
Chargen has made continued steps towards balancing
the different careers.

I\'m still working on my Advanced Chargen for all T4/5
careers, from time to time.  Yes, even Entertainer.  ;-)

I think it might be more than a few decades. What do you mean when 
you say low acceleration? Say you get the comet up to 10% of the 
speed of light. It will take a decade to get 1 light year in. He was 
mentioning a 10 parsec rift. 32.6 light years. You would have 
to get one of those comets to within, say, 3 parsecs of the other side 
for a J3 ship to make it. That means the longest one will  be in place 
in no shorter than 228 years, not counting acceleration and
deceleration 
once in place. No matter how you cut it, the time will still end up
kind of 
long term.

I imagine you could rig the battledress suits as pretty effective combat
simulators.  Tell the computer to have everyone run in place instead of
actually moving and use the suit systems to display sim data.  Could be
really funny to watch, seeing ranks of battlesuited troops dive to the deck
for no apparent reason, but it could also be very effective.

The next step is to start practicing your close quarters skills in the
corridors, which I understand real Marines do actually do from time to
time.

(group more important than the individual, nonconformity shunned).  This
could lead to brutal hazing designed to beat a newbie into submission, or to
punish a nonconformist or a "boat-rocker".  The Japanese school system has
suffered such student hazings.  Vilani military hazing could be greatly
magnified if the mostly Vilani unit received some newbies from a world with
a non-Vilani culture.  "Vilani & Vargr" also states that the Vilani used the
most efficient means possible to achieve their goals, and in warfare this
meant nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.  This indicates a callous
disregard for sentient life, for anyone not perceived as part of the Vilani
"group".   The Vilani may relentlessly dehumanize any sentients other than
themselves!  This could lead to possibly fatal hazing.  Consider also the
propaganda which the Vilani must have created for themselves in order to
justify their oppression, exploitation, and conquest of other races,
especially those helpless against them during the Ziru Siirka period.  The
master race of a gigantic interstellar empire could not have been softies,
after beating down every other race with FTL and those worlds foolish enough
to resist.   Perhaps they have an ethnocentrism similar to that of ancient
China, a firm belief that thousands of years of wisdom, culture, scientific
advancements, and military victories made them inherently better than their
underdeveloped neighbors.

Consider also the level of incompetence and corruption which made the Terran
victory possible.  A monolithic empire, stagnant for a thousand years, with
officials bent on enriching themselves and spending even more on lavish,
jaded pleasures.  Below them, peasants and laborers toil ceaselessy for
generations to feed their masters.  The published OTU products depict the
Vilani as a harmonious business oriented group with their children learning
with them in the workplace, etc.  Reading between the lines I see a gigantic
pyramid of oppression, greed, and corruption, more along the lines of the
empire of Shaddam IV in Dune.  The workers at the bottom of the pyramid are
those whose children learn the profession their ancestors have slaved in for
centuries.  Squatting on the workers\' bent backs are the megacorporations
and corporate security forces.  Riding the megacorps, on top of it all, is
the Emperor of the Iridium Throne with his majority shares and enforcing his
will with his merciless Imperial Marines and planet nuking Battle Fleets.
The Vilani will definitely have a rich military tradition, and violent
hazing is most probably a part of it.

I in no way mean to enter into the gun debate on any level. However, I was
under the impression that the firearm was invented with offensive intent,
and later adapted to more mundane uses such as hunting. My basic point is,
the early innovators in firearm design weren\'t designing weapons for
self-defense. In fact, the early handcannons and matchlocks were huge and
very unwieldy, which I would think would make them impractical in a
self-defense role...

With that being said, I have an honest Traveller related question for the
list:

ObTrav:

Does anyone actually at any point find a use for low-tech weapons? I don\'t
mean swords, or a particular "novelty" item (such as a crossbow for stealthy
assassins).

With the wide variety of tech-levels, it seems to make sense to put in
muskets and the like, but is there a real need for them? I can imagine some
uses that I may incorporate in the future:

A world in which the only allowable weapons are ammo-light repeaters (such
as revolvers). The focus for shooters on the planet is a high degree of
accuracy and very careful shooting. In fact, in a G:T game a shootout might
be resolved with the Old West rules from Compendium II.

A world in which the only legal weapons are matchlock dueling pistols. The
weapons are amazingly expensive to maintain, and not terribly effective.
Disputes are often settled by duelling.

The real important question is who would ever use archaic weapons in the
Third Imperium? Can anyone think of some possible reasons that they\'d be
used?

Religious? I heard once that the Catholic Church had a dislike for black
powder weapons (they thought the bullets were guided by devils). I also
heard  that they had some distaste for rifled guns when they came along,
since it was said that the noise of a ricochet was actually the voice of a
demon.

Traditional? Maybe archaic weapons have a very specific ceremonial use. They
are expensive, beautiful and hand-crafted. Training is allowed only to
upper-classes, or specific classes. Maybe warriors are still trained in
their use much like Imperial Marines are trained with sabres? They serve
some ceremonial purposes?

It\'s just a question, \'cause there are plenty of archaic weapons in
different versions of Traveller. While it is easy to imagine their use in a
milieu such as TNE, I\'m trying to imagine some more "cultural quirks." These
might really help in CT games, since some of the skills can be really
bizarre. "What, I\'ve got skills in energy weapons and archaic firearms?
How\'d that happen?"

Actually, there was incredibly _strong_ patent protection, because the
inventor got the patent to the whole _idea_, not just the implementation,
and IIRC there was no expiry.

Imagine if Babbage\'s estate was owed royalties by everyone creating

Just as it is easier to shoot a gun well than shoot a bow well. (Training

How well does GURPS model this in character creation?  As I don\'t use the
GURPS system, I\'ve never bothered with analysing the CC rules.

Advice from my first VP:

Always carry a fresh cup of coffee when asking an intruder to leave. If
they pull a weapon and look like they\'ll use it, flick the coffee into
their eyes.  They usually disarm themselves after this.

Amazing chap. Never fussed, never hurried, yet was somehow there when bad
trouble was brewing. (No pun intended.)

Deaths with guns in that part of the world don\'t get in the news either. I
suspect the nationality is a bigger factor than the method.

Lyall Watson, in Dark Nature, mentions that while the stats for violent
death in England have been dropping steadily for centuries, people feel
less safe now than they did 50 years ago.

In Toronto, where I work, people are more worried than ever about violent
crime, and yet we have less violent crime now than we have for a long time.

An acquaintance of mine in the police force thinks that this is because we
get a lot of American TV, especially those \'live\' cop shows, and we hear
more crime stories from other places than we did before, so people are
hearing about more crimes than ever. And if you hear more about it, the
problem must be increasing, eh?

It\'s a perception thing. Sorta like life.

    'body' => 'This is how I handle weapons in starports. For the record, it generally
follows my personal beliefs about firearms.


Guns are legal, even military grade fusion guns. Any weapon may be
transported within the starport, providing that it is secured in
inoperative condition. (Which I define as taking at least a couple of
minutes to unlock/reassemble.)

All explosives, energy weapons and automatic-fire weapons must be secured,
unless carried by licensed guards.

All weapons, secured or not, must be registered with security. This is
fast, and usually cheap -- essentially taking records so that, if the
weapon is used in a crime, security has a record that they can use to help
track it down. This tends to discourage gratuitous use of weapons, and also
makes reporting a lost weapon really good idea.

Any starport establishment may ban weapons, at the manager\'s discretion. If
this bothers customers, they can always shop elsewhere.

Safety of the port and patrons are a primary concern. The starport manager
can always increase restrictions if necessary. Most will only do this if
there is a demonstrated need: more security costs money, which must come
from some other budget.

Some possible restrictions:
- - screamer-tagged guns (call security when fired, relay sight-picture)
- - weapon-carriers must wear prominent badge (to alert security)



In game terms, a mercenary unit could transport its assault rifles through
the starport, but only in secured cases. Combat knives and sidearms would
be legal, but probably frowned upon unless part of a uniform. Openly
displaying weapons in a culture where they are uncommon will draw the
attention of a lot of people, including security, which may not be a
problem if the players are being above-board about everything.

The Rampart\'s laser in BL (and Striker II evaluation) can shred the armor on 
any Imperial AFV except the front on the Heavy Grav Tank IIRC.  It does have 
USL grapples for space missiles.  Why waste em on grav vehicles when the 
laser has unlimited shots and is just as effective?

ObTrav:  We always read about lone battlecruisers guarding interdicted

weeks to get anywhere?  How does the Imperial Navy handle shore leave, when
they patrol, train in, and garrison subsectors filled with mostly
uninhabitable rockballs?  "All 700 of us are going to visit the one tiny bar
at the Way Station. Woohoo."  There can\'t be much of a recreation scene.  A
military the size of 3I\'s must have entire systems devoted to it as garrison
bases.  The depots are obvious, but there must be others for the Imperial
Army and Marines, as well as the rest of the Navy. Are there entire systems
that exist like parasites off the military?  An entire world of pawn shops
and strip joints?!  "Now entering the Itaewon system."  "Standby for
shoreleave at the Radcliff Downport."

I have never seen a Traveller deckplan with recreational facilities
sufficient to its crew.  If any former RL naval veterans can shed some light
what shipboard recreation facilities are normally present, it would be
appreciated.

If we knew more about what Imperial military personnel do in their off time
and about the places that exist to serve (and overcharge) them, it would
help in designing adventures.  Are they restricted to the starport?  Do they
have their own district to party in or can they mingle in the downport city?
Feel free to reply with anything you\'ve used in YTU.  I\'ve used a
tremendous, luxurious Shoreleave Arcology, built especially for imperial
military personnel that would let them play hard in recognition of the
months aboard ship.  No limits parties for as long as someone\'s buying the
beer.  live bands, pools, discos, as well as parks for troops to enjoy some
space and quiet after being cooped up with cabinmates for months on end.

I take your point, but the other thing is that if a crowd runs in all
directions from a guy with a sword, he is only going to be able to hit a
few of them (and unless he knows his weapon, he may no be able to do
killing damage all the time). Whereas the same guy with a fully-automatic
military-grade weapon can shoot many more of them, at his leisure. Remember
our own TML\'s "Sniper" thread: "Don\'t run, you\'ll just die tired". Also,
stabbing someone up-cloase-and-personal with a knife is different from
shooting them from afar. We\'ve made it too easy to kill people.

Anyway, _this_ is the line of thought I can\'t fathom:

1.   Yes, I can understand that it would be fun to use full autofire
weapons at a firing range; BUT
2.   No, I don\'t understand why a person would want to keep such a weapon
at home, rather than keep it safely locked up at said rifle range.
Convenience? Or do they seriously expect to use it against intruders (thus
demonstrating pre-meditated intent if they ever *did* shoot someone)? Or
are they expecting to use it to threaten their wife (as, unfortunately,
many domestic shootings in Oz have demonstrated)? Or (as some of the more
extremist groups are reported as arguing) is it to protect themselves
against the day the the Feds/UN come knocking down the door to stomp on the
individual freedoms accorded to the citizenry?? (Rampant paranoia or
what?!?)

Ooof, this is becoming an anti-gun rant, which is not its intent.

[At home, I keep a number of my grandfather\'s trophys he received from
various gun clubs in the 60\'s. He enjoyed the skill of shooting clay
pigeons with a shotgun, and was damn good at it. And he kept his weapons at
home. However, he taught me the basics of gun safety (I think Mark Cook
posted them here), such as "every gun is loaded", "do not point your gun at
something you don\'t want to destroy", etc. Pa even disliked kids playing
cops and robbers - he thought that such behaviour desensitised them to the
dangers of and responsibility for a weapon. Sound familiar?]

As I said, my puzzlement comes from the q: "why keep the thing at home?"
_Is_ the sole answer "for convenience"? Am I missing something?? Help!

ObTravRef: Something that others have commented on, is that it is
interesting that Law Level is _primarily_ tied to weapon restrictions. Why?
Marc and Loren, can you give us the definitive answer as to why you chose
to tie this particular marker to Law Level?

Pretty well, I think. Characters with average or above average IQ have a
bonus to their Guns skill (I think this would also apply to default use,
but I won\'t swear to that)  Even a second of aiming will give a gun user a
significant accuracy bonus, offset by fairly small range penalties at close
range.  At 7 yards, the range penalty would just match the accuracy bonus
of a typical pistol.  An extra second or two of aiming would add an
additional bonus to hit.  

Also, even the smallest gun does more damage than a large knife wielded by
a person of average strength.

Aaarh, feel free to ignore 90% of my last post. I\'m only up to #513 and now
realise that multiple people have requested to remove the "gun thread" from
the TML. Fair enough too.

...but I\'m still interested in getting a response from Marc or Loren about
linking Law Level to weapon control...

OOOoooohhh!  Color plates! Color Plates!

At the very least, Jesse needs the cover.
Loren, if you\'re listening, we need a full color Jesse cover!

Only thing I can think of is it might be useful to use an appendix,
similar to the one in 101 Starships, that shows the details on a
ship\'s creation so that you can see it matches the rules.

I would tend to agree that the Imperium, at least by 1100, would own a few
worlds directly. However, you might consider that this is right against the
original philosophy of only controlling the "space _between_ worlds".

Anyone with a reconciliation? Or should this have come out as part of the
Debate over a new Imperial Charter/Warrant?

Well as former USN serviceman, lets see the really big one is "Crossing The Line", ahh the fond memories of eating green eggs and purple pasta, wearing your clothes inside out, "Bull Nose Canons", blowing the seawater out of "Tie Downs" on the flight deck, the swish of the Shillelagh(sp), the smack of the Shillelagh upon "Wog" fantails, and wiggling down the "Chute".]

Crow Tacking is small taters, compared the "Crossing the Line" fun. I had fun doing Crow Tacking, I was 6\'4", 245lbs, the look of horror as I prepared the target area, lovingly making sure there were no creases in it, the full draw back, cracking of the knuckles as I made my fist as per karate teacher had instructed me, the focusing yell as the blow was incoming, then the look of surprise when I pulled the blow to only small tap. Then the strong but firm hand shake.<G> 

I only hit two individuals with a full force blows, one was Samoan of extreme muscle mass(He had a 5" 75lb projo dropped on him from the deck and caught it after it bounced? off his pects) I did not even cause him to shift his balance, the other was a cruel ass hole who truly believed in making bruises in Crow Tacking, I and other higher ranking Petty Officers had warned him to cease in bruising, he did not, so we convinced him to quit(I think it was Malu(sp) the Samoan that finally convinced him cease).<G>

It sounds like the USN is becoming PC, what a same, another set of traditions passes into the mist...

What

A dress code is the external expression of a corporate identity. It is
meant to create a sense of identity, and engender a feeling of unity &
solidarity.

In the best case, it is just the wrapping that overlays real underlying
unity that exists within an organisation or group. In its worst instance,
it is a superficial attempt to encorage conformity and unite a dispirate
bunch of people who wouldn\'t normally be seen dead together, while allowing
them to band together and laugh at other people who look different (think
of an inter-school sports fixture and you\'ll know what I mean). An
us-vs-them sort of thing.

At least, IMNSHO.  ;-)

I found it interesting when I went to the Joint Embassy School (later
Jakarta International School) in Indonesia. Based on the US system, it felt
more like a uni than a school - no dress code, for example. This meant that
everyone ended up wearing jeans and T-shirts, of course!!  ;-)  No dress
code? Don\'t make me laugh. People invent their _own_ dress codes, so they
don\'t appear different - or so that they do. What is "the Goth look" or the
"look" of the Trenchcoat Mafia but a form of dress code, adopted by the
members of a group to demonstrate their common bond?

ObTravRefs:

1.   Military uniforms ("You might be an idiot, but you are a MARINE, and
I\'ll be damned if we Marines will take crap from those S3 Scout buffoons in
the corner...");
2.   The Imperial fashion thread (Imperial AbFab: "Why daaaarling, is _that
what they\'re wearing on the Fringe these days? Why, that went out of
fashion in Core three years ago. You really should keep up with the
times...")
3.   Cultural clashes: Vargr garishness vs Vilani sleeve lengths, etc.
4.   Internal cultural differences, for example trying to spot whether that
Vargr you\'re dealing with is from the Rukh trade group, or Lair, or...

  Scoutships w/ escorts
TF2:
  Fuel ships, more fuel ship (and guess) even more fuel ships w/ escorts (and 
lots of supply ships)
TF3:
  Ships loaded with prefab "gas stations" w/ escorts

TF 1, 2, and 3 depart from base, after the first jump (2 psc) a gas station 
is built and ships carring its prefab turn back.

TF 1, 2, and 3 head twords closed star system, laying 1 gas station at the 
end of each jump prefab builders that "lay" a gas station turn back.  mean 
while imperial forces start resupplying the gas stations.

once a star system is found with a gas giant a fuel prosesing base is built 
and there is a place to build a base it is contructed and an imperial 
populashion is brought in to man it (this would be an Agri/Indurial/Starport 
base) the force resupplys and once resupplyed starts scouting everything 
(yes, I do mean everything, every hex), building gas stations as needed and 
other bases as needed.

Awareness of crime has increased greatly as well. Some things that are
crimes today just didn\'t get the press or were paid no attention to. To the
best of my knowledge, what are now illicit drugs were made illegal in the
1930s. As a result, there are no records of a real "drug problem" before
then. Organizations to protect kids from abusive parents and to follow up
these cases just *didn\'t* exist until the 40s, if my memory serves me well.
The way we view domestic abuse is completely different now than just 20
years ago or so. In certain areas of the country, racial hate crimes weren\'t
treated as crimes but as vigilante justice under the auspices of the law.
Many infant murders were written off as crib deaths.

Crime fighting techniques have gotten much better. Finger printing as a
method of identification was only accepted early this century. The FBI is
relatively young. Many more crimes went unsolved or even undetected before
people were able to take advantage of high speed communications. Forensic
medicine has come a very long way in the last 30 or 40 years. New techniques
have been compared and study. Some murders were written off as accidental
deaths due to the fact that the autopsy methods were very coarse and poor.

Awareness of child molestation (something that people in polite society
simply didn\'t talk about) has helped to convict many of these sick bastards.
I\'m sure there are a thousand more examples.

The point is, we remember a time when there were few child molestors,
because cops didn\'t actively pursue child molestors. We remember a time when
parents didn\'t kill their children, because we didn\'t *know* that they had
killed them. We remember a time when less girls were raped because there was
a time they\'d be spirited off to a convent, or taken out of school, or just
remained silent out of fear or shame. We remember a time that there was no
child or spousal abuse because there was a time that people approved of it
or simply ignored it. We remember a time when creepy serial killers didn\'t
prowl across the nation because we found bodies that no federal crime
organization could tie together into a unified whole.

Also, prior to a time when a federal organization got involved, there were
plenty of rich and influential people who most likely *literally* got away
with murder. Hell, it happened with Gacy to some extent, and that was just a
little while ago.

Janey just disappeared from town. What happened to her? Was she murdered
(the blue-haired old ladies all say, "Heavens no, not in this town!")? Did
she head off to New York or Hollywood (the blue-haired old ladies add, "She
*did* always like to sing and dance.")?

So, now, all these crimes seem *new* to us, because with increased awareness
it all seems so much worse than an earlier, simpler time.

Of course, a short media memory and a series of wars has helped to modify
our own memories a bit. You\'ve got a major war, like World War II that skews
all kinds of statistics and our collective remembrance. Although I don\'t
have any real statistics to back up my argument, but I imagine that when
most of your young, aggressive males are off fighting the Nazi menace, your
crime rate\'s going to drop a bit. Then, the 50s came along, and there was a
sudden and disturbing increase in juvenile delinquincy (it was the
ultra-violent comic books!). That was quickly overshadowed when the 60s came
along and exploded. The baby boom generation had hit their teen years, and
crime rates soared... Imagine that.

So it goes.

ObTrav: What is crimefighting like in the Imperium? What kind of devices do
stellar police agencies use? Do they have InstaSleuth kits with tiny robots
that scour the place for evidence?

How about rehabilitation? Is it the current toss \'em in a cell with more
walls and more guards mentality? Is it the "Escape From  New York"
mentality, where you just put them somewhere far away and leave them to fend
for themselves? Is it more of a "Clockwork Orange" thing, in which advances
in psychology and pharmacology work wonders in lower recedivism <sp?> rates?
After all, Leary did some promising research into the use of psychoactive
drugs to create a sort of "religious awakening" in cons which show a marked
increase in their return trips to jail.

What is the state of crime in the Imperium? Are there Vargr mobsters? Are
Vilani mobsters like the yakuza? How about the Aslan, is there room for
crime in their rigid system of honor?

In most Traveller campaigns I\'ve been in (running or just as a player),
the first place the characters head to when they dock at the starport is
the Starport Bar. It seems to be a universal in role-playing -- in fantasy
games, the characters always seem to wind up at the local inn. 

Next adventure I run where the characters are at a Class A starport on
a high-population, and they decide to split up with a "we\'ll meet in an
hour at the bar", I\'ll have each character wind up in a different bar.
The big starports would have more than one of them, right? :)

Although much of the discussion has been off topic, dealing with the events
of late, many of the ObTravs have been kicking butt. My creative juices have
been flowing in a Trav direction more frequently lately as a result.

It\'s probably just me though. Perhaps it was just a general jadedness on my
part with the territory the list had been going over lately. As anyone who
read my stuff probably already knows, I\'m much more interested in the
challenge of the interstellar version of Marilyn Manson than discussing
weapons technology and the like. If I can get some focus, expect to see more
on my site in the near future.

Again, the tanks are fairly flimsy, at least that\'s what the price tag for 
them suggests to me.

The lasers were for antimissile defense.

They\'re specifically designed for *spaceships*.  Warships are just a subset of 
spaceships.  <grin>

It does.  No way I\'d let a 400 ton station pack 50 turrets, or have those couple thousand tons worth of drop tanks just laying around.  IMTU, as I\'ve said before, drop tanks are ok, they\'re just not very strong.  They won\'t last forever like a regular tank would.

But drop tanks aren\'t as *durable* as regular tanks.  Drop tanks are 
throwaways.  They\'re designed to be used and dropped, not used for years and 
years and years.

> Unfortunately, you\'re not supposed to put 50 laser turrets on it. ;-)

Nope.  AAMOF, I was looking through \'Adventure Class Ships Vol 1\' when I 
bought it way back when \'in the days\', and noticed an overgunned boat.  500 
tons, 5 packed turrets *AND* a missile bay.  Totally unkosher by the rules.

Sure they are.  The Gazelle Close Escort is calc\'ed out as a 400 ton boat with 100 tons of drop tanks.  Performance is calc\'ed on that basis, and recalc\'ed for when the drop tanks are jettisoned.  This per T&D.  <grin>

The Gazelles did this.  But IMTU, & IMNSFBHO, the drop tanks are *fragile* compared to a starship hull.  IMTU, a Gazelle needs to replace its drop tankage at least every year, unless they get the 10 MCr long-duration tank set that\'s built to regular starship specs.  <grin>  Basically, I just calc\'ed the upgraded tanks like they were a regular ship hull.  They\'re still jettisonable, but at 10 MCr a pop, it\'s not likely they\'ll be ditched unless the boat was in a *big* hurry and needed that extra parsec of jump range.

Oliver Hazzard Perry FFG-7 Class Frigate:
	Mess Deck (20-30 feet)
	3 Crews Lounges (about 10-15 feet on each side)
	Chiefs Lounge (smaller)
	Wardroom (about the size two crew lounges, they officers also eat here)
	some exercise equipment squeezed in.
	I think it was 300 movies for closed circuit TV
	A ships store the size of a closet
	Seabag locker

Nimitz Class Carrier
	Forward and Aft Messdecks, with a First Class lounge in a walled
off part of the aft mess decks.
	A chiefs area
	I think 3 Officer Areas + I think the Captain and Admiral both had
their own areas, the Admiral had a area the size of a small house, complete
with a kitchen (downright obscene in size)!
	Chapel
	Library (gee for a crew of 5000 you\'d think they\'d have decent
library right?  It SUCKED!!!  The area with books was about 15x15\'  I\'ve a
better selection, and probably more books!  Needless to say, I had a locker
full of books.)
	A couple exercise areas
	The Aft Messdecks also had several Video Arcade Machines at about
$0.25, two junk food machines, and some Pop machines.
	CNN & one other news channel (Live), a Movie and a TV channel (taped)
	Two ships stores, but only 6 people allowed in at a time.

The thing that sucked the most about being in the Navy on a ship was the
lack of personal space.  I had a tiny standup locker, about 8 inches wide,
and a yard high, and another locker under my rack that was 6-8 inches deep.
If you were lucky you had someplace to keep your sea bag, the Carrier
didn\'t have a seabag locker.

I actually got a laptop in 1987 so I could have my own computer onboard
ship, now I believe personnel computers are no longer allowed.  A Gameboy
was a great thing.  Some people had Sega\'s or SuperNintendo\'s.  Cards and
Domino\'s are very popular, and a few other games can very occasionally be
seen on the mess decks.

The Frigate was great for hitting a port, most the only time we didn\'t pull
up to a dock was when there wasn\'t room.  On the Carrier, we only saw one
port in 3 years that we could pull into besides home port (we pulled in
there once each of the two cruises).  It is really a pain having to wait
for a liberty boat, espeically when you have to be back on board before the
end of liberty.  On a Carrier it can take hours of waiting in line just to
get off of the ship (of course in port you can wait over an hour in line to
eat).  If the water was to rough the liberty boats couldn\'t run, I missed
my trip to London thanks to that, never was able to get off of the ship
that day!

Mail Call on either was an amazing sight with the pile of mail taking up a
sizable chunk of a hanger on either ship.

You ever see John M. Ford\'s \'Road Show\', one of the wilder Amber Zones, first published in JTAS #23?  The characters become roadies for an amp rock band named Veedback for a one-year concert tour.  *EVERYBODY* (rabid fans, rock-hating vigilanties, ticket scalpers, video pirates, *pirate* pirates bent on kidnapping them for ransom) is going to be after the characters.  Veedback has the highes LRI (\'Lost Roadies Index\') of any band on the Rim concert circuit.  <grin>  Makes a long ticket on a Tech 6 swamp world look like prom night at East Tulare High.  <grin>  As John mentioned, rock and roll *NEVER* forgets!!!!!

One would think that \'Marine Country\' would also have gyms that break down for 
easy storage, but that still doesn\'t stop the problem of having trained 
killers sitting around going stir crazy.  The Foreign Legion used to call this 
\'le cafard\', \'the bug\', and claimed it killed more troops than combat.  I\'d 
say, and this is just a WAG, that the Imperium\'s Marines were tranked a bit to 
keep their aggression under wraps until absolutely needed, then given the 
antidote just before getting packed into the assault capsuals for their drop.  
Just my opinion...

Although....  one would expect to be able to run a modern (TL8) small city
off the normal power plant of a couple of commercial starships. Emergency
power for New Zealand\'s capital city, Wellington, in the event of a major
earthquake is planned to be provided by a pair of old frigates.

Definitely. Black globe capacitors are the obvious application, though it
could be the other way round, in that maybe the capacitors used in drop
tanks were derived from those found attached to the artifact black globes.

The problem, as I see it, is finding materiels or force field technology
capable of using and focusing all that energy, which (based on the premise)
is enough energy to rip space-time itself,  so it\'s going to be difficult to
find that technology.

However,  I suspect that if it\'s possible, gravity lenses and such would be
involved. Heck, they may even be involved in the jump drive usage itself.

You know, I\'m getting worried about this, I\'ve already ended up discussing
Glorantha on alt.games.whitewolf (as an Umbral realm Mage characters could
visit). At the time I made some off hand comment about a  Void Engineer Qui
LA  Machinae meeting a Vilani merchant, and now I\'m discussing RQ on the
TML.

We\'ll have to be careful or we\'ll be told off being OT.

This brings up a scenario hook I came up with for the Littleton situation,
which AFAIK fits all the released facts.

Firstly I apologize if this is considered insensitive, if you don\'t like
game discussion of recent news events that resulted in deaths please don\'t
read any more.

The set-up :

Several news reports stated the foloowing "facts" on the case :

1. The bomb disposal squad was amazed at the number and sophistication of
the bombs.  Speculation was that they had help,, because of the number and
positions of the bombs, and the fact that some of the designs had not been
seen before by the bomb squad members

2. Everyone is surprised the bombs didn\'t go off

3. Everyone is surprised that so few people got killed given the amount of
weaponry the pair were supposedly carrying.

4. There were large numbers of weapons and shells lying around, and some of
those were "sophisticated" military weapons.


Now, here\'s  what _really_ happened at Lyttleton :

The pair were encouraged to carry out the killings by an as yet undiscovered
colleague or colleagues (And ones who never _will be discovered now).  These
colleagues were in fact  agents in the employ of an enemy of the American
state. ( Take your pick, Slobodan Milosovich, Saddam Hussein, Loius
Farrakhan, Patricia Pulling... ) It was these people that set the
sophisticated bombs, sneaking in the back while the pair of dupes made all
the noise out front.

However, a black-ops counter-intelligence unit, ( "Yellow Rain" perhaps ? )
were aware of the plot. Unfortunately, they didn\'t get the go-ahead for an
internal wet operation until the attack had started. (in fact you can hear
the comms chartter now : "Damn it, Control, the hostile operation is go
_now_ ! We need that clearance _immediately_ before, _more_ people get
killed ! ")

So, after the terrorists were in the building, the unit gets the go ahead,
but are told the whole operation must be completely deniable and covert.
(It\'s too late for good press coverage, and Control doesn\'t want it known it
was their slow decision making that caused the deaths )

The terrorists are all killed quickly, and the two kids are executed in the
library before they are able to detonate any bombs or get all their targets,
any timers are professionaly disarmed, and the agent(s)  are taken for
interrogation, the wet squad slipping out of the area before the first SWAT
or police unit arrives, leaving any weapons they had actually fired, so that
the shell casings would match.

The characters get to investigate the incident because of "anomalies" in the
official reports. Blood stains in places where bodies weren\'t, several
unexplaind reports from students seeing "SWAT" officers in the building
before they actually arrived, and the stuff mentioned above, along with
anything else the wet squad couldn\'t cover up in the couple of minutes they
had between completing the operation and having to get out.

If you want to make it really obvious, make one of the SWAT team members
shown on TV unidentifiable by local officials.....a team member who stayed
behind because he was seen by students, and felt his best bet was to act as
if he was suposed to be there....

Admiral Hutara IIRC.  In the "real" universe, he declares for Dulinor 
following his return for Capital and brings the Ilelish fleet w/ him.  In G:T 
he got "retired" after someone played around w/ his head, apparently.  
Ilelish should be on the verge of exploding anyways, though it\'ll be very 
interesting to see what developments occur in G:T.

There definately is.  The Regency Sourcebook library data mentions how 
Arbellatra appointed the first Duke of Regina (an Aledon) in 629, the day 
following her own coronation as Empress.  Strephon and Norris share a middle 
name, too.

That\'s not hard to explain.  When a professional looks at a bomb made by a 
cunning amatuer, there\'s *bound* to be some design \'gotchas\' that they haddn\'t 
run into before.  There are *LOTS* of ways to build bombs.

Perhaps this is why gravity wells cause misjumps - the external gravity gradient
(the tide) acting on the ship causes variations is the transmission of the "Enter
jump space" signal going through the ship.  Of course this theory would suggest
that larger (i.e. more massive) ships would be more vulnerable to misjumps, which
is not supported by past canon, but which might explain the ubiquitous nature of
the 100 ton Scout ship.

I do hate this thread, but... "However, it\'s proper purpose is to kill in
self defence...?"

The history books I had read (and the basic history taught during training)
told me that firearms were designed to destroy (the larger bombards,
artillery, etc.) and to kill and to maim (hand guns; nowdays to include
support weapons I suppose?).  They were not developed for hunting, they were
developed to kill and maim a country\'s enemies, to inflict greater losses
upon that enemy than he can inflict upon you.  To give you the edge over
your enemy.  They were adopted because they were easier to use than bow and
melee weapons, requiring less training.  The object of a firearm is not so
much to make one equal, but to make one greater than one\'s enemy (otherwise
all MBT\'s would have the same armaments and armour if everyone really wanted
to be "equal?").

I am also pretty sure of this, that if I was some scumbag
mugging/raping/etc. someone while I was in possession of a fire arm, the
moment they reached for anything other than cash, wallet, watch, whatever,
as that gun they had hidden is coming up, my gun that is ready to use and
pointing at my victim, would be having the trigger squeezed about then -- as
an ex-assault troopie (QMI), I know how quickly one can squeeze off a round
when prepared, compared to one reading for a (snap)shot... add to that the
various emotions that can make you react without thinking (fear, anxiety and
the like) -- "I didn\'t want to kill him, why did he draw a gun for?"

And no, I am not anti-gun, but I am "anti-arming-idiots-freely-with-guns,"
but one man\'s idiot is another man\'s good friend... so how can it be done?

That\'s for the email Dan, yes - characters is exactly what I need from you. I 
will be generating initial situation reports (sitreps) for each of the 
factions/player groups this weekend. But the presence of identified 
characters will facilitate that greatly. I would like to have at least one, 
and possibly as many as three to six. I realistically do not see players 
effectively using more than three give or take a couple based on past 
experience with Star Trek pbems using this same format. (My experience using 
this format is both as a player and referee. Someone else pioneered it.) 

I would be very interested in player perceptions of their chosen agency or 
faction. I am using GURPS\' Behind the Claw as the primary reference source, 
then Universal World Profiles from MegaTraveller\'s Encyclopedia as well as 
the stats provided at the 
<A HREF="http://members.nova.org/~sol/core/">CORE</A> website. I am using as 
my descriptions of the actual political enities, the Classic Traveller Alien 
books (I have them all). However I intend to purchase all the GURPS Traveller 
materials I am so enthusiastic about what they are doing with the Traveller 
Universe. If you have Pocket Empires or Imperial Squadrons feel free to help 
with the research of your faction. I am very liberal with interpretation of 
data provided there is sufficient data to back any claims. However, as 
referee I insist on final approval before introduction in to the play 
environment to ensure fairness and overall playability of the campaign. But 
by all means if you want to assit in the research have at it! In the Star 
Trek pbems that I mentioned earlier, most of my enjoyment as a player was 
from the research and the writing of GURPS\' rules for the campaign....we 
started freeform but it became apparent to me we needed structure. Actually 
this is where my love of the GURPS system evolved. 

But the first step is identifying for me "who" your agents of influence are 
to be. Actual character construction is not as important as identification at 
this point. If you are pressed for time or simply want to see more before you 
invest time please email me with names, positions, and locations (world 
location as a minimum) for your initial character(s). 

I am using the shareware programs (predominately Mr. Bont\'s from his Felix 
website  
<A HREF="http://209.39.36.25/gurps/">The FELIX GURPS Page</A>) in direct 
support of this game. You can attach email files with your characters or 
transcribed copies in the email, using the GURPS CHARACTER ASSIST (GCA) or 
GURPS CHARACTER MAKER (GCM) programs. I am also using the 101 Starships, 101 
Vehicles, etc., from the  
<A HREF="http://www.bits.org.uk/">BITS (British Isles Traveller Support) 
Homepages
</A> page also. I am generating the maps using Mr. Bont\'s Astrogator program 
(from the FELIX GURPS page) and as stated earlier, the UWP data is being 
taken from the MegaTraveller era and is featured on at the  
<A HREF="http://members.nova.org/~sol/core/">CORE</A>  page.

Not a Mod 8.

you should be able to use more like a mod 4 or 5 for 5Kt (don\'t have The

The pros would probably favour the 1 iron for the combination of
striking power and controlability.
Amateurs tend towards medium irons which are shorter and more
controlable, unless they feel the need for reach, when they
swing wildly with a wood.

I would suspect the same applies on the golf course.

It wasn\'t religious, it was maintain-your-powerbase.  The Catholic Church 
didn\'t like black powder weapons for the same reason they had earlier 
fought against crossbows.  

It removed power from the landed & titled Nobles who had armor that
previous protected them weapons peasents use in attempts to stop the nobles
from taking their daughters for a bit of R&R.

One possibility is to move the Marine in Low Berths if they\'re not expecting
to do anything.

Unfortunately, Char Gen dose not seem to support this
(ave 3, max 13 weeks/term)
Oddly enough, a Navy character gets up to 24 weeks per term (ave 6.7).
Since most Navy characters are actively doing something on a ship,
this is presumably the Frozen Watch.

(figures from T4.1 draft)

(A "fun" thing to roll in your Navy character\'s advanced character
 generation - spend a year as a popsicle - no promotion, no skill. :-)

One assumes it would be entirely possible to copyright an item (or idea) on
one world, then attempt to do so on an expanding ring of worlds.  That is,
take the idea from world to world copyrighting it (depending upon the local
legislation for such things).  This would come under the auspices of the
local legal people for that company.  A communique from the head of R&D
(Rhylanor) to R&D (Regina) of Megacorp X directs him/her/it to patent an
item post-haste, for instance.

This could lead to the some interesting developments as people register
business names and/or patents in the hope that the owner of that
concept/name on another world will then come in and spend a bundle buying
the right to use the name.

I always figured that it was part of the engineers\' job to carry out

You\'d also have to handwave why I cannot have lots of small crystals
and discharge one at a time instead of all at once.

Them problem is not drop tanks, but the drop tank description that
says you transfer all the fuel, discard them and then jump.

Dropping them during jump transition would work, since you could
handwave that the capacitors just conduct the energy into jumpspace.
It also saves having to try to explain why you can\'t use a tanker with
a pipe or how the explosive bolts shred a fuel tank into unusable
fragments.

It\'s the delay I don\'t like.

On the Tech Level issue, I can accept that they are TL16
(or experimental TL15 in the same way as black globes).
Alternatively, I could accept that they are TL9.
(As *ALL* the ship design rules imply.)
What I find difficult to accept is that they are TL9 but not found
until someone does TL16 research.

Those "disposable tanks" are only disposed of if someone activates
the explosive bolts. It is perfectly possible to perform a successful
jump with one attached.

Certainly. I was just responding to Keven\'s assertion that cheapie fuel

Actually it was self defense...against armored opponets.  Guns in europe
were developed to defeat body armor, Knights in plate mail.  So was the
first crossbows.  A good suit of armor made the wearer very hard to kill
with muscle powered weapons.  I got this take on the developement of guns
from a book on midevil history.  It has some very interesting points on the
developement of weapon and armor in responce to other weapon and armor.  It
seem the \'arms race\' has been going on for a lot longer than most of us
think.  By the way the gun brought about the time of the musketeers.  With
armor no longer a garentee of safety people stoped wearing it prefering
speed.  With out armor heavy weapon were no longer needed and the days of
pistol and fencing sword came to be.

OB Traveller:  What would be the effect of the invention of a hand gun sized
weapon that could defeat any battledress?  How about a \'force sword\' that
could carve battledress like butter?  What would it be like to live in that
brief time of transition?

Several of the old traveller adventures deal with worlds with weapons
limitation the the PC have to deal with.  It once worked in favor of a
character on mine with blade-3.  Ha!  There was also a world that only
allowed duel pistols.  They had a very high law level but allowed dueling.
Very scary place.  You could get into a duel for almost anything.  We got
out quick!  Those people were wound to tight!

Anti-missile lasers are pretty much irrelevant if you can\'t move. An enemy

They\'re specifically designed for *spaceships*.  Warships are just a subset of spaceships.  <grin>

No matter. You can cheap out the gas station with my small station

It does.  No way I\'d let a 400 ton station pack 50 turrets, or have those couple thousand tons worth of drop tanks just laying around.  IMTU, as I\'ve said before, drop tanks are ok, they\'re just not very strong.  They won\'t last forever like a regular tank would.

I wouldn\'t put 50 turrets on a 400dtn station either. Maybe one or two,
to keep the random floating space debris away.

Tether the tanks together. So what if they need to be replaced every
couple of months? You\'ve got tankers coming in regularly, refurbishing
tanks will be the least of your expenses.

I would imagine that all of the different methods you describe can be
found in the Imperium, since different worlds would have their own ways
of punishing convicted criminals. The Imperium itself, for crimes offworld
or between worlds (eg, piracy, smuggling) maintains some prisons. Of
course, the punishment for piracy is a one-way trip out an airlock while
in space...

Vargr are more likely to be raiders and pirates than mobsters, but it
is feasible. Vilani mobsters, certainly. Aslan crime? Sure, but I can
see it organized akin to an Aslani clan, with a high-ranking female
looking after the money end of things...

Is there any source about what the state of music in the Imperium is 
in the early 12th Century (Imperial calendar)? There\'s the above reference
to "Amp Rock", but what else is there? This is obviously a Solomani influence.
What kind of music is generally associated with the Vilani? The Vargr?
The Aslan?

(In the G:T campaign I\'ve just started, the Vargr engineer (NPC) has a
fondness for Vargr opera... think of Klingon opera from Star Trek, but
off-key and with a lot more howling...)

I had some questions for others on the list who might be familiar 
with the MT mechanics.  In last night\'s gaming session, my players 
got into combat for the first time, and one of my new players had 
some major problems with the Interrupt mechanic used in MT\'s personal 
combat system.  He could not understand why, if he was conscious 
after his action had been interrupted, he could not complete his 
declared action.  I explained my perception of the rules, and the 
reasons behind it, but he was relatively undeterred.  However, it did 
get me to thinking about it, and I wanted to run something past the 
TML at large for input.

If a unit, after surviving being interrupted, is still 
conscious/active and still has the physical capacity to complete 
their action, should they be allowed to roll a Difficult, 
Determination task in order to continue their action under fire?

This stipulation might allow for the scenes where the guy gets 
shot, but still dives for the airlock mechanism and begins cycling 
the outer airlock, so his buddies can get in.  And similar such 
high-action sequences.

If not, what is the thought process behind not allowing interrupted 
actions to be completed after the interrupting action is completed?

Thanks in advance for your help and input into this request.

Not when you figure in the bonus for cutting or impaleing damage.  Also
usinga gun in close combat is probematic.  A knife does not have to reload
and can not jam.  It is also silent and does not require a background check

I believe your player is correct in their interpretation of the rules. Let
me explain:

Interrupting another unit, which has not yet taken its turn, allows the
interrupter to takes its turn before the other unit finishes its turn.

For example, If Joe is trying to run from behind one crate to another,
exposing himself briefly during his turn, he could be interrupted during
that move. Let\'s say Mike fires at Joe as he runs between the crates. If
Mike is successful in interrupting Joe, this means he gets to fire at him
while he is open. If Mike does enough damage from his shot, it could
incapacitate him. If Joe is still capable of running, he will be able to
finish his move.

Another example, Joe and Mike are involved in a duel. They both draw.
Whoever wins initiative gets the shot off first. But, if the other person
interrupts successfully, they can take their turn first. Regardless of
interrupts, if the first person hit is still standing, he can shoot back.

To summarize: Interrupts do not cancel the units action, it just inserts the
interrupters action ahead of that units action. If the interrupted unit
survives, it can continue its action.

Quote: pg68 MT Players Manual, first column, last paragraph, 4th sentance:
"If Aybee can put the NPC out of action before the NPC\'s turn resumes, the
NPC will be unable to do anything."

It\'s helpful to read the Interrupt Example from where that quote was taken.

I got this from the USNI Military Database. It should answer your question.
http://www.periscope.usni.com/demo/terms/t0000040.html

ABBREVIATION: APDS-T
TITLE: APDS-T -- ARMOR-PIERCING DISCARDING SABOT WITH TRACER

Armour-piercing ammunition used in tank cannon, the discarding-sabot round
permits the firing of a high-velocity sub- caliber round with greater
accuracy over longer ranges than conventional rounds.

After leaving the cannon barrel, the surrounding sabot falls away from the
core of the round, which is usually a small rod of very dense metal. This
gives the smaller round the higher initial velocity of a larger round and
thus increases its penetrating power over a greater distance.

The APDS-T has a tracer that allows the gunner to follow the round during
flight and correct targeting errors.

	There\'s been good research done that shows people\'s perceptions of the liklihood of various 
events is heavily influenced by what they hear from others and the media.  One study counted the 
number of references to (IIRC) auto accidents, heart attacks, violence, etc. on the local evening 
news and then asked people in that area to estimate the leading causes of death for people in 
their area.  They got a very high correlation to the deaths covered in news stories, but a very 
low one to the _actual_ leading causes of death.

- ---- begin quote ----

By RICK CALLAHAN Associated Press Writer 

A Central American vine that relies on bats for pollination attracts them by
using its flower petals like tiny satellite dishes to bounce the animals\'
sonar signals back at them, researchers
reported today.

The Mucuna vine is believed to be the first plant species found to use such
a mechanism.

<snip - DS>

Researchers found that each blossom of the Mucuna vine contains a special
petal with a concave acoustical ``mirror.\'\' The petal directs signals back
toward any nectar-feeding bat that chirps in its direction.

The discovery was made by Dagmar and Otto von Helversen, a husband-and-wife
team from the University of Erlangen in Germany. They reported their
findings in today\'s issue of the journal Nature..."

<snip - DS>

"...The von Helversens tested their theory by removing the acoustic guide
petals from some blossoms and stuffing others with cotton pads. They found
that 20 percent or less of those blossoms were visited by bats, compared
with about 75 percent of the untouched flowers.

The vine grows along creeks and in rain forests. Its short-lived
2-inch-long, whitish-green flowers are timed to open every half hour to an
hour.

The acoustic device rises into its reflective position only when the
night-blooming flowers are ripe for pollinating, thereby discouraging bats
from visiting a flower that isn\'t ready to give
up its pollen.

- ---- end quote ----

ObTrav:  With a little forethought, such devices could
be use to help bring home to players they aren\'t just
on Earth with a weird colored sky. Imagine, if you will,
such a series of plants which have adapted to reflect
*radar* or scatter thermal signatures. Such growth
can be used by a GM (or players) to hide a crashed
ship, foil terrorists/freedom fighters, protect an
Ancients site or PCs/NPCs on the run, etc.

It gets even better if the PCs discover the plant\'s
properties on their own as part of a scientific
expedition, making a name for themselves in the
scientific community and leading to additional
patron encounters.

Such little tidbits can lead to a lot of fun.

There. My Traveller contribution for the day.

So, yes, it _would_ be possible to power some (currently imaginary)
factor
XXX meson gun from the single discharge of your jump capacitors, but
trying

pile of
scrap metal where your meson gun used to be.

A nice GM might let you get one extra powerful shot out of your
destructing
meson, like a detonation laser, or he might not, ruling that the meson
cooking also takes out other systems. (i.e, the rest of the ship)

Yes, this allows the possibility of super powerful single shot weapon

Readers of the Lensmen series by EE Doc Smith will recognize these as
"Primaries."  When originally used, they were the final gasp of what are
essentially orbital monitors, and the single shot slagged the entire
monitor satellite.  It was later that the Space Patrol scientists were
able to design a switch that let them use all the power in one shot
without slagging the whole ship.  Of course it did slag the weapon, so
they were one shot items even then.
I might allow a single use of a Jump drive/spinal mount weapon in this
way, though I agree that it would completely destroy the ship (and not
allow survivors, or much more than a few molten droplets left of the
ship).

     I like this!

Jumping in the comparisson between BattleDress and Midevil armor...
That\'s a tough one to make, IMHO.  The Armor gave protection, but at a lack
of mobilty.
BD (as opposed to Combat Armor) allows the wearer to run at least as fast
as normal, and probably longer.  Add a grav belt, and you have major mobility.

There are man-portable weapons that will defeat Battledress.  A HEAP
RAM-grenade is probably the lightest.  BD does provide protection against
*most* small arms and shrapnel.  It does not mean you can give up the
concepts of cover and concealment.

Another advantage of BattleDress is that it makes you a much more effective
weapons platform.  The individual trooper can carry more and more powerful
weapons.  For example, a BD trooper could be carrying:
- - A PGMP (main weapon)
- - A Gauss PDF (for when you just want to take out the target, and not the
building behind it)
- - A forearm mounted laser carbine (mostly for target painting, but
effective against unarmored foes)
- - Two small tac missles or a RAM Grenade launcher.

Oh ya...and a Space Axe :-)

I am currently running a G:T game on IRC based somewhat on the Roadshow
mentioned above.  Not only are the PCs roadies, some are actualy
musicians!  The band plays a fusion of heavy metal, celtic, jazz, and some
villani classical thrown in for effect.  The name of the band, Tir Na nOg.

So far the adventures have involved finding and aprehending a hit man who
was hired to off the band\'s diva.  Finding an orphaned child who also
happens to be a telepath and of course getting the stage set for the next
gig on time.

I am looking for more players, so far we are down to only 2 as some
players had to bail due to RL.
We play Thursday nights at starting between 8:30-9 pm eastern.

Hmmm, Size 8= 8x1,600= 12,800 km, and earth is just around that

Every book I\'ve seen says 71%, so also that should be right. Where

A very good and interesting post. It is always fun to add weird stuff in
Traveller that is neither psionic nor Ancient.
I think Niven used similar plants in Ringworld. They reflected sunlight to
shoot down birds and insects and caused the characters some problems when
they were scooting along in their gravvehicles.

Wrong in both cases.  The website is chock full of inacurracies, but
then, since it belongs to Senator Diane Feinstein (a notorius anti-
gunner), that\'s not surprising.

In point of fact, Tec-9s, and their clones are readily available in
many gunstores today, and full-auto AK-47s can still be had for the
cost of a $200 Class III transfer (plus the purchase price of the
rifle.)  Since the *IMPORT* ban of May, 1986 took effect, the price
of Class III firearms has skyrocketed, as the supply is limited to
what is already in the U.S.  I should know, I own three of them myself.

navy.  The gun caliber is 20mm, and a \'ball\' round of ammunition would have
that caliber as well.  Our primary ammunition, however, is (was) a depleted
uranium \'penetrator\' that is significantly harder than the average round
that you feed through the barrel.

Since firing straight DU through the gun would quickly destroy the barrels,
especially at the speeds at which we fired, the DU portion of the penetrator
was fashioned to be subcaliber (10mm as I recall), and the difference was
made up with a plastic sabot.  This allows the lans in the barrel to bite
into the plastic and impart the spin to stabilize the rounds, but the
plastic effectively removes the metal to metal erosion and friction that a
normal round would cause - the only thing still eroding the barrel is the
expanding gases from the propellent - and increases the barrel life.  (In
the four years that I was out in the fleet, the only reason we would ever
have to replace a barrel was due to corrosion from the *outside*, and that
was more for cosmetic reasons than anything else.)

The sabot is designed to fall away from the sub-caliber penetrator (the
sabot is actually split into four pieces, and held in place at the crimp
where the cartridge is secured to the penetrator), which is why it is called
discarding sabot.

Now, having re-read the rules again... I see your point. It does say in the
UTP that "The interrupted units turn is considered spent. A failed interrupt
role doesn\'t count as a spent turn."

I can see where different situations can call for different rules. One thing
to consider is the UTP\'s are only examples. I think the referee needs to
make the call at the time of the event.

This conversation has sparked a new thought for me. If a living unit is hit,
shouldn\'t its turn be canceled. Considering that their are only 6 seconds
per combat round, if you get hit 3 seconds into the round, are you really
going to be able to stand their and fire back in the remaining 3 seconds? or
are you going to be rolling on the floor clutching your wounds?

This task could be used to determine if you can return fire in the same turn
you were hit. Not just for interrupts as you suggested. This idea would, of
course, include interrupts.

The only downside to this is extra rolls. I, personally, like to limit the
number of rolls necessary in combat.
But, then again, it might not be so bad when you consider that most living
targets will drop with one hit.

I\'m going to try this out in my next game to see how well it works.

Thanks for the idea, Jason.

You mean like the burger stand in Sydney which was called "Burger King", so

This is addressed in one of the MT errata. The correction to the rules says that
you are allowed to complete your turn after the interrupt is over (assuming, of
course, that you\'re still alive to do so).

But note that the only canon design does still have some substantial internal 
tankage of its own (excepting the JTAS one).  Supp7 and Supp 9 both have J2 
internal tankage IIRC.  

This is only a problem if *all* of the fuel is used instantaneously. Instead 
of having internal (or some significant portion) guzzled instantly, at the 
higher displacement, then transfering the drop tank fuel to internal tankage 
and \'completing\' the fuel usage (instantly or throughout the jump, according 
to YTUs jump theory), at lower displacement.  Someone wanna run the numbers 
(m3 of fuel)?  I\'ll do it eventually if noone else does...

It\'s correct.  Check the TL of the designs.  The Yacht and patrol cruiser are 
TL-15, the Broadsword is TL-12.  In stock TNE there isn\'t a TL-15 improvement 
on TL-14s Bonded Superdense, but it\'s twice as effective as TL-12 vanilla 
Superdense (thus half as thick for same protection).

Also note the accelerations.  Both are 4G and under FF&S rules need at least 
an AV or 40 to protect against micrometeorites, etc.  The Broadsword only has 
2G and needs 20.

Burst, not wear out.  They\'re flimsier, remember?  You can make something that can handle high pressure for a short period of time, but it\'ll fail if you *keep* it at high pressure for a longer period of time.

Which just shows that you *DON\'T* want cheepie tanks.  One good solid hit with 
a chunk of gravel and the tank *bursts*.

And besides, you *can* vaporise gravel with lasers.  It just takes some time 
to do it.

I still don\'t see it.  The tanks would be too flimsy.  My take on it is, if 
they were designed for long term applications, they\'d be made stronger, and if 
they were stronger, the rules would show they cost just as much as a normal 
hull does.  *OR* if they *were* that strong, hulls would be cheaper.

You mean, replacing.  Got a question for ya.  Figure you need to replace those 
cheepie tanks every 6 months due to bursts, pinholing, whatever.  How much 
would those cheepie tanks *cost* you over a 10-year period?  How much would a 
regular *hull metal* tank cost you?  Remember that the station is designed for 
an operational lifetime of *decades*, if not a century or two.  You *don\'t* 
need a TL15 gas station when a TL9 or 10 one will do.

I have always wondered why drop tanks are not recoverable?
When I first read this ruling I figured it was because the ship that 
dropped the tanks was now several parsects away and would have to buy 
more drop tanks in order to get back to the original set. Of course 
the more likely scenario is someone else comes along, salvages them 
and then resells them. This might account for the relatively cheap 
cost of drop tanks compared to starship hulls.

I always figured that this was the simplest/most logical/KISS 
explanation for MTU.
 
Also if a capacitor can\'t hold it\'s charge for very long then it\'s a 
very poor capacitor and should be replaced.

I\'m suddenly reminded of the mid-70s Doonsbury when Duke was Ambassador to
China.  He\'s been invited to the Peking Opera, when suddenly the sound of
machineguns fill the room.  Duke freaks and ducks, screaming "What the HELL

fire for the *overture*?"  "In art, as in life..." the guide smiles.

One of my favorite filksongs is "Spacers Home" by Duane Elms. Here\'s 
just a few of the best verses and the chorus (and remember, this is 
copyrighted by Duane Elms, from his songbook "At the Helm"...

	Space is long and dark and empty, quite a \'ways \'tween friend and
	friend,
	And you never know nobody when your journey\'s at an end.
	So the place you\'re gonna find me \'tween the times I have to
	roam\'s
	In the bar around the corner where they make you feel at home.

		Belly up to the bar friend, have another round.
		It\'s long, cold and lonely \'tween the times we hit the ground.
		One day I\'m gonna settle down, never more to roam,
		But for now the bar\'s the spacer\'s home so far away from home.
	
	Spaceport bars is common places. Here you\'ll find the common men.
	Some is rought as three day whiskers, some is quiet as hidden sin,
	Some is deadly as an adder, some is dumber than a stone,
	And when they\'re not chasin\' stardust they make spaceport bars
	their home.

Duane Elms writes some of the best filk. Try to find a copy of 
"Dawson\'s Christian" if you can...it forms one of the spacer\'s legends 
IMTU. And many filk songs are songs the PC\'s here being sung in 
spaceport bars.

Cool!  That\'s not in the errata I have so far.  I\'ve got the two 
parts put together by the TML.  One dated in April and the other in 
June, I don\'t remember the years at this time.  :(

I\'d love to see the errata you have.  Is there a means that I could 
get that information from you?  Thanks in advance, Erwin.

Thanks.  I\'ve already spoken with my gaming group over lunch, and 
they are very happy with the decision to allow interrupted turns to 
continue, providing you\'re still up, that is.  Makes much more sense 
to them, and to me.

No problem.  It\'s a privilege to be able to help a fellow Traveller 
out with ideas.  I get so many from the people on this list.  Please, 
let me know how it works out with your group.

This reminds me of the HERO System rule requiring Ego checks to act
offensively in a phase when you are hit.  (Optional rule, generally
only applied to NPCs.  Works to enforce a sense of caution in
Fantasy gamers, though.  :)

Unfortunately I don\'t have that errata as a separate document. A long time ago I
created Word copies of my MT rules and incorporated the errata into them. I did
this because my players couldn\'t find the rules to buy for themselves (we only
have one decent gaming store in Calgary, and it doesn\'t carry much Traveller).

After I incorporated the errata, I deleted the original document. I\'d offer you
my MT rules, but
a) I think that might violate a copyright somewhere
b) they now have some bits and pieces of T4 and T4.1 in them

Maybe I don\'t want "men" to be equal. Maybe I don\'t want some 19 year old
legal gun owner to blow my kid away because he used bad judgement and was
rude. Maybe I don\'t want a minority who disagrees with some public policy
that the majority has agreed to to be able to take up arms against us. Maybe
I don\'t trust "YOU" to be armed. I don\'t personally know all these honest
citizens who want to bear arms. How do **I** know that they are trust
worthy? Because they tell me so? Because you tell me so?

And that\'s the real problem. I know that I can be trusted with a firearm,
but can you be?  The gist of the argument is always between those who are
familiar with guns and comfortable with them, and those who are either
unfamiliar with them and would rather they didn\'t exist at all.  Also can be
spilt between those who don\'t trust government as an institution and those
who do. After all if it\'s MY government, MY army, MY police, what do **I**
need a gun for. On the other hand if it\'s SOMEONE else\'s government, SOMEONE
else\'s army, SOMEONE else\'s police it\'s a different story.

The answer? You\'re all right. Guns don\'t kill. People Kill. People kill
fewer victims without guns. Criminals won\'t turn in their guns. Parents are
responsible for the raising of their children and for their misdeeds. Some
children grow into monsters, no matter how they\'re raised. We can\'t keep
guns out of anybody\'s hands as long as we let gun manufacturers make so many
and sell ammunition and the equipment and chemicals needed for reloading.
Hunters who obey the law and know how to shoot should have a right to do so.
They pay enough for it.  No one should need a gun to protect themselves.
Nothing we do will prevent a heretofore law abiding citizen who decides to
go on a killing spree from find a way to do it. A gun can make it easier,
but anyone with intelligence and a library card can find another way to do
it.  The answer? I don\'t know. But we better figure something out as a
society or we\'ll never get off this planet.

Obtrav:My players know that they can only go so far if they\'re inside the
Imperium\'s boarders.  There\'s nothing like the threat of a regiment of
Marines dropping from orbit in GTL 12 Battle Dress with armor support to
ruin your whole day.

I was referring to the golf joke punchline that not even God can
hit anything with a 1 iron.

Ob. Trav.:

What would be the recreation sport of the high Soc travellers?
I can easily imagine that golf might survive.  But wouldn\'t there
be a more Traveller-ish game, perhaps originating among
Vilani nobility.  A game that is somewhat elitist, and doesn\'t
require any marked physical fitness that is leisurely.  The kind
of game where more business is done than in the boardroom.

Any ideas?  The harder I think about it, the more I think its
just good ol\' golf.

I\'m sorry but I can\'t follow you with the assumption.
The question is whether there even is Imperial Copyright.
If you agree that there is, then its superior to the copyright
laws of all member worlds.  Just as the Berne Treaty on
Copyrights applies to the US, and most of the world,
regardless of what the US laws actually say.

If there is no Imperial Copyright, then perhaps you can
copyright on each world, assuming they have a law
level and a government that supports copyright.

And "Astroburger" wouldn\'t be copyrightable.
Its a trademark, i.e, it identifies the source of the
good.  Copyrights apply to original works
of authorship, i.e, expression.  Trademarks and
copyrights are not the same things, regardless of
how often US federal judges confuse the theories
of the two.

My take on these was that they were only under dangerously high pressure

If pressure is a problem, fill \'em with water - the scout and military

Here\'s the T4 High Guard conversion I did.

Notes:
 - The email at the bottom is dead.
 - Its designed to be compatible with the T4.1/T5 beta material that
I have seen, so that Liason skill appears and that the Ranks don\'t
perfectly match is intended.

You mean, replacing.  Got a question for ya.  Figure you need to replace 
those cheepie tanks every 6 months due to bursts, pinholing, whatever.  
How much would those cheepie tanks *cost* you over a 10-year period?  
How much would a regular *hull metal* tank cost you?  Remember that the 
station is designed for an operational lifetime of *decades*, if not a century 
or two.  You *don\'t* need a TL15 gas station when a TL9 or 10 one will do.
>>>>>>>>>>>>
And me without my High Guard books to hand. :)

A hull will wear out in approximately 40 years. It will need to be returned for 
maintenance every year. It costs Cr100000 per ton, plus whatever it will cost 
in bridge, power, life support, etc.

A disposable tank needs to cost about Cr1250 per ton to match this,
but I\'m only counting the Cr100000/tn cost of starship-grade hull, not
the power, bridge, etc. requirements. I don\'t recall the cost of drop tanks,
but I\'m not sure drop tanks are the best choice for this anyway.

A fuel tank can be deployed that is not intended to carry fuel through
jump space. It will be filled by tankers at the site, and transported
empty (or even collapsed) back for refurbishment. I\'m thinking that
dismountable tanks may be the ticket here, but I don\'t recall the price
of them. They\'re rigid, so should last longer than 6-months.

If the GM doesn\'t want fuel stations, he can easily make them impractical.
That\'s a TU decision, what\'s to argue about?

and....

<<I\'m afraid I still can\'t quite wrap my mind around the concept about

From these two emails I am assuming that I am not doing a very good job of 
explaining what and how the campaign is supposed to be. :( 

First this is not a traditional Star Trek-like pbem or sim as commonly 
encountered on the Internet. Although it is possible that a player could play 
only one character as in most sims, it is expected that a player will run an 
actual network of characters. This is to maximize player participation in the 
campaign\'s development. To coin a term from a one of my family\'s favorite 
computer games, your actually playing the guiding spirit of your network of 
characters. Although my past experience has been in using this format that 
players will normally assume the persona of their most powerful character 
during the campaign. 

The actual campaign itself focuses on the interaction of networks of 
characters each controlled by a different player. The characters in these 
networks will interact in the play environment, collecting information, 
executing tasks, conducting missions as directed by the player. The 
activities of these characters within their networks will provide data back 
to the players in the form of emails from the narrator/referee and possiibly 
from interaction between the players to a lessor degree. Players will use 
this data to make decisions concerning their network and its objectives. 

Why networks of characters versus a single character? I decided to do this to 
allow the players maximum opportunity to collect information (ironic enlight 
of this letter) and interact in the environment since I am using monthly 
turns and following a plot timeline in sync with real time (1 month game time 
= 1 month real time) to facilitate the time lag created by the Traveller jump 
drives in interstellar communications. 
 
As far as rules of play, I thought I have mentioned before that the rules of 
play are the abstract combat rules featured in the GURPS COMPENDIUM II and 
the abstract combat system found in GURPS TRAVELLER: STARMERCS. Source 
material consists of all the Classic Traveller books, MegaTraveller, and any 
GURPS Traveller books currently published. In addition, inter-character 
action will be based entirely on my assessment of the character(s) in 
question\'s attributes and skills to accomplished in tasks identified by the 
players. I am looking at the ultimate goal or objective of the players rather 
than each independent skill tests. 

What this latest round of requests on my part was an attempt to do was to 
solicit the types of characters players were considering so that I could 
start organizing player information messages this weekend. It would be a 
great deal easier to write a message if I know the character type. Anyone who 
has player any of the versions of Traveller surly realizes the referee must 
know the types of characters he/she has to contend with before play can 
actually begin. 

What I envision future turns to consist of is a message from a player 
identifying his character(s), and what he/she intends for those characters to 
attempt with the timeframe of the game turn (1 month). I as the referee will 
then send a response message providing any information generated by the 
character activities, abstract combat results based on my analysis of all the 
turns, and any other relevant information I feel is appropriate base on game 
play. Then the whole cycle begins again. 

Is it any clearer?

The dark blue also comes in a lightweight short sleeve version
for summer, and there haven\'t been any complaints about them
being too hot with the vest underneath.

I don\'t know what the current annual uniform allowance is, but
they still issue a check.  However, I believe that the firearm
and vest are now issued while you\'re a cadet and are sent out to
field training (a squad or two of grey shirts with a sergeant
play cop at a precinct for a month or so).  Second vests or
firearms are out of your own pocket (including the uniform
allowance), and I believe that there was a one-time special
increase in the uniform allowance to permit the uniform
changeover without causing undue hardship.

The PBA supported the change.

>Ob Trav: Here\'s what I bought roughly, so you could use it for NPC\'s, or 
>maybe in the ship\'s locker

Pretty good list; the hat with the ear flaps seems to be gone,
and, as you mention, the nine has replaced the revolver.  The
uniforms are no longer mandatory dry cleaning, but they\'d better
look as though they were.

The baseball cap is only an option for bicycle patrol and some
special units (like the SWAT teams); everyone else uses the
traditional eight-pointed hat.

There are two choices for the sweater, either a British Special
Forces style or a turtleneck.  The turtleneck is held to be
warmer, but the BSF is considered more stylish.

I\'m not sure, but while the Glock is generally the nine of
choice, I believe that either the Sig-Sauer or the Ruger is also
an authorized choice; the other one (Sig or Ruger, whichever
isn\'t authorized) had some serious problems with the mechanism.

This list will cover the basics; different departments will have
different requirements (for example, most British constabularies
will not include the firearm, and an agency like the FBI will not
include the uniform).

Missiles on small vessels were not "really" allowed by the rules until late
in the T:TNE era.  For the Rampart to have missiles in MT (or CT) either
the rules must be "interpreted" or the COACC rules used (in MT).

The problem with a laser (especially the fixed forward mount of the
Rampart) is that if you can shoot him, he can shoot you.

Of course, the problem with missiles (smaller ones anyway) is that if you
can see it, you can generally shoot it down in the era of point defense
lasers.

The way to win a ground battle at high tech levels is either to overwhelm
missile defenses, or have better armor than the other guys weapons can
penetrate (generally indicating a significant TL advantage).  Sensors at
the ranges were talking about are probably very hard to jam or defeat, and
are proabbly pretty quick to get a lock.

The CT/MT/Striker Grav Tank model seems to have big honking piles of armor
and weapons playing hide and seek on a large scale battlefield, hoping not
to stumble over the stealthy infantry with their short range but capable
weapons.  I think that a rampart type fighter would need to keep to cover
in order to avoid getting zapped by, at worst, the second grav tank it
encounters.

My opinion is that the Rampart type would be employed to zap the infantry,
not the grav tanks.  VS infantry it would require a lot of smaller seeking
missiles, not anti-ship missiles.  Note that the rampart doesn\'t really
want to be in direct view of the Infantry either, but probably it would
take a lucky infantryman to mission kill the fighter (destroying it is
almost out of the question).

Just some thoughts.

Remember, this is a slogan rather than a constitutional provisions.
The Imperium does, as a default policy, let local worlds rule themselves.
However, event will lead to exceptions (depot worlds, worlds owned
by a noble, etc., recently conquered worlds, etc.)

Actually, I think that Strephon is Strephon Aledon Alkhalikoi,

On my site (which is linked in my sig, just keep going down) there\'s a
section on culture. In the section on culture, there is a piece called "Live
on Vland" about a Woodstock-like event on the Vilani homeworld. All of the
bands are Vilani and there are little bits about the popular culture of the
Vilani.

I\'ve also got a write-up on kaadmukim, or "interactive music," which even
allows a new method of DJing which is quite popular among the hipsters of
the Imperium.

The best part? Despite my heretical views, most of my articles are *Free of

Dunno about older systems, but under GT, the TL12 Rampart\'s Laser can never
penetrate most of a MBTs armor (Max damage: 5d100(2)=3000(2), so it can
punch through at most 6000 pts of DR, TL12 tank has DR 25,000 front, 10,000
body and turret, 5,000 cupola).  The only place it has a chance at is the
cupola.  OTOH, the Tank\'s main gun has a max range of only 50 miles in an
atmosphere, so it can probably never hit the Rampart, either...

The only thing to consider is, if their isn\'t a salvage ship near by to
collect the tanks, they will probably be lost in space. Consider, they are
already 100d away... and there\'s a lot of space out their. Another idea
could be that  a beacon was put on the tanks, that would make them easier to
recover... and I don\'t think it should make a significant change in the
price.

You idea is the only way I can see drop tanks being as *cheap* as they are.
I think the actual manufacture of dTanks is quiet expensive, but they recoop
their costs by re-renting the tanks. They could even pay independants to
recover the tanks... minor fee to make up for the costs of actually owning
and operating the recovery ships. Of course, in the higher traffic ports,
the companies would have their own recovery teams.

No, you\'re misinterpreting.

The size refers to the diameter of the planet in miles.  Earth is
7927 miles in diameter; that\'s within delta of 8000 miles, so
size 8.  

The atmosphere is standard (possibly verging on standard-tainted,
but...), so atmo 6.  

Close to 3/4 of the surface (not 60%) is covered with water, so
hydro 7.  

Population is billions, but less than ten billion, so pop 9.  

Government is balkanized, gov 7.  

Law level varies with location; pick it.  

Tech level is a little harder to describe; take it as given that
we\'re TL7 verging on TL8, with pockets down at TL4 or lower, and
research in some areas experimenting with high TL8 or TL9 or
higher.

A D starport offers unrefined fuel and limited services; I\'d say
that if the fuel requirement were eliminated, many international
airports could qualify as B or C equivalents on the basis of
services alone.  Jet fuel probably qualifies as unrefined; water
certainly does, so I\'d say that any international airport would
qualify at the D level.

This, alas, is the current mindset of a predominantly democratic, liberal
U.S. Government.  We trust *US* with guns, but we don\'t trust anyone else.
The problem with a free society is that everyone has to be equally free,
or no one truly is.  A government is designed (ideally) to serve the
population, not to be served by it.  Our founding fathers knew that
governments can become masters rather than servants.  That\'s why they
drafted the Bill of Rights to include the 2nd Amendment.  You say it\'s
YOUR government, YOUR army, and YOUR police.  Fine.  Give them an order,
but don\'t hold your breath waiting for it to be obeyed.  Police depts.
and armys are methods of expressing national policy (internally and
externally.)  That national policy should be an extension of the will
of the people.  Current events would suggest that this is becoming
less true every day.  (Everybody who really wants to be involved in
the war in Kosovo, raise your hands.)

Besides being a lot of fun, firearms are truly the ultimate "eqaulizer".
While you may bemoan the "19 year old legal gun owner" who shoots your
kid, how to you justify disarming the 75 year-old widow who needs to
defend herself in her home when three hoodlums break in and threaten
her with knives and crowbars?

When someone says, "Maybe I don\'t trust *YOU* to be armed", you demonstrate
exactly why everyone should *have* the right to keep and bare arms.  No
one individual, or small, select group of individuals, should have the

No problem whatsoever. Feel free to do so. That\'s the reason I typed it up.
In fact, I got my own creative juices flowing and I\'ve started a write-up on
crime fighting tools for my website.

I can see that.

Another question might be something like: What approaches do different
cultures favor? Are there Vargr "trials"? If so, what are they like? How
about the Vilani? How do they deal with their criminals?

>Vargr are more likely to be raiders and pirates than mobsters, but it
>is feasible.

There is actually some text on this in one of the TNE books. "The Regency
Sourcebook" I think. At least that\'s the one that makes the most sense. I
got the distinct flavor of the Irish mobs from these guys (they secretly
send money back home to help with the post-Virus reconstruction).

When I read the book "Donnie Brasco," I couldn\'t help feeling like I was
reading about *human* Vargr. Seriously. The New York mob in the 70s seems to
already be close to the Vargr mindset. I always imagined that a Vargr mob
would be something like that... with the fast forward button down.

>Vilani mobsters, certainly. Aslan crime? Sure, but I can
>see it organized akin to an Aslani clan, with a high-ranking female
>looking after the money end of things...


I\'ve always had the vision that Vilani crime was very Yakuza like, where
they enjoy a sort of semi-legit status. I imagine that they are often in the
employ of Vilani megacorps.

It\'s the Aslan that have always thrown me for a loop though. I haven\'t been
able to find a real "hook" to hang organized crime on. I can imagine what it
would be like, but not where it would fit in.

It may have been a "maintain your powerbase" idea at the high level, but
they used religious reasoning as a front, so my point still stands.

True. Even taking that into account, I was trying to get at a reason why all

unavailable.

There are millions of ObTravs that you can build off of the concept.

A religion believes in the holy, healing power of light. As such, laser
weapons are not only outlawed, they\'re actually seen as blasphemous and
obscene devices. After all, a laser perverts the holy effect of light.

A planet on which most of the human inhabitants are born with above average
eyesight. They fight duels at long range and find the use of scopes to be
*very* dishonorable. Possibly even punishable by death.

A planet with a severe crime problem takes a unique approach to weapons. All
legal guns have a very rapid rate of fire, but are all low penetration. They
often use plastic bullets or fragmenting pellets. Combats can be very
exciting "John Woo" style affairs with a very low degree of property damage.
Fatalities are relatively rare.

One planet markets weapons to their youth. It\'s not uncommon to see plastic
firearms in designer colors with cartoon characters on the grips.  Ammo can
be bought in the candy aisle.

You use low acceleration so that you can continually accelerate without
using all of your fuel to power the maneuvering drive. With continuous
acceleration I expect that a much more substantial velocity should be
possible:60% C or 70% C. A small amount of time dilation should be
insignificant. At 70% C you\'re talking maybe 45 years (not counting any time
dilation). You don\'t bother to decelerate. Every three years or so you just
sling out another comet.  Once you get on the other side you sling a few
back the other way.

Expensive? More so than most routes. But cheaper than tankers.

An uncontacted culture which has risen to a fairly high tech level, but
the idea of firearms has simply never happened. Nobody thought of it. Or
maybe the world\'s composition is such that the chemistry to create
firearms is impossible or very very difficult there.
State of the art bows (perhaps crossbows) are carried in every police grav

To be fair, let\'s let someone taking a random shot with that .22, rather
than putting it in a relatively safe location (although you could hit the
femoral and bleed out in seconds)  

My first response was a bit oversimplified.  Here\'s the detailed version.
Base damage for pistols is better (1d6+1 vs. 1d6-2, min 1).  However,
knives (and other blades) multiply damage penetrating armor (x1.5 for
swings, x2 for stabs), small pistols don\'t.  Also, bullet damage from any
limb wound is limited by a blowthrough rule, a .22 in the leg will almost
never kill you, but knife wounds are less limited.  

The overall calculation is that it will be easier to hit someone with the
pistol at really close range.  The damage done is going to depend on
several variables, and hit location is going to be critical.  (That\'s
pretty realistic, I think) 

Unless you\'ve actually looked at the rule, I\'d really hesitate to label it
a Murphy.  Don\'t blame me for a poor explanation. GURPS may overvalue guns
at low damage levels, but it\'s hardly unique in this regard.  In fact, I\'m
hard pressed to think of a system that doesn\'t.

I started plugging ships into my spreadsheet.  I get a 24% increase
in cargo/passenger space for a free trader.  My jump-4 ship got
a 183% increase.  Furthermore, without drop tanks the amount
of cargo goes steadily down and the price goes steadily up
so that, if you account for the fact that a faster ship can
deliver more cargo, you peak out at about J-2 as the most
optimal.  With drop tanks this all changes.  You cargo changes
a little and you price doesn\'t go up as fast as your speed, so
the most efficient is jump-6.  There realy is no reason why
all long distance cargos wouldn\'t go jump-6.  (Now I think
that J-4 X-boats aren\'t a problem with the existing traveller
universe, but in this case it would be).

I should be noted that 25% is easily enough to drive non-drop
tank ships out of business.

>Rather than spend time and energy debating why drop tanks *can\'t* work the
>way they\'re supposed to, why not figure out how they *can*?

I\'ll tell you my issue....

The problem is when we get into a situation where the player
reads the effect and says "great, I want to be able to use this
with collapable tanks".  You give him an arbitrary reason, that
doesn\'t follow from the described effect, why you can push
them away, but you can\'t pull them in.
Then he says, "well, can I use these capacitors with my weapons.
You give him an arbitrary reason, that doesn\'t follow from the
described effect, why you can use that energy for one purpose
and not for another.
Then he says, "Well, I want to set up a jump station so my
ships can jump w/out fuel".  You give him an arbitrary reason,
that doesn\'t follow from the described effect, why they
have to be disposable."
The he puts aside the other things he was thinking of doing
(like reducing jump drive cost and volume by moving the power
plant to the jump stations and just transmitting power) and
thinks, "if they didn\'t want ships to use so much fuel, then
why didn\'t they just design the background that way?"

Now you have alternative explination of how jump tanks work.
(like dropping them in jump space).  But these invalidate the
TNS entry as well, it seems really hokey that you can\'t jump
with anything nearby _except_ if it is a fuel tank, and, most
importantly, I believe that if you set up something fundamental
like needing a lot of fuel to jump and then later on have a
technology appear that get around this for one type of use, and
one type of use only, it just feels hokey and contrived (since
it is).

Hey, I\'ve got the same question, and I\'ve asked it before!

However, now I shall commence with the handwaves:

Compared to the Imperium, the Darrians are quite tiny. They may not have the
proper base of scientists and engineers to make the proper breakthroughs
again at the moment. They might be missing just one discipline or one
breakthrough. Most of the industrialized nations had problems building
"true" next generation infantry weapons from the 60s until very recently,
because they just didn\'t have the base of engineers and skilled machinists
that were shuffling around in prior decades. The advent of Computer Aided
Design and automated manufacturing has given new life to that particular
segment of the industry.

Actually, computers are an excellent example of that all around. Computers
have had an amazing impact all across the board. The face of
mass-communication has changed. The face of manufacturing and engineering
has changed. I\'m hard pressed to think of some market or industry where
computers have had little impact.

So, there might be a stumbling block that the Darrians have *forgotten* some
piece of technology or scientific discipline (or even just a philosophical
or mental discipline). Programmers from the former Soviet Union were sought
after for a time because they were much better at getting the most out of
their antiquated machines. The Americans lived in a culture where the next,
faster computer came out before they had to get creative to squeeze more
speed out. Maybe something like this is holding the Darrian\'s back. Maybe
they don\'t have good enough programmers to squeeze the kind of processing
power out of their machines that their ancestors could.

The Zhodani are another kettle of fish entirely. If I remember correctly,
they\'ve got a tendency to \'reprogram\' free-spirits and free-thinkers. Maybe
those very same impulses are the ones that set geniuses apart from the
average schmoe. I know that my electronics teacher was quite fond of the
monumental physics personalities. At the time when I took his class, he had
been reading a book on the concept of "januvian thinking." If I can remember
my conversations with him on the subject correctly, it described how their
approaches to problems were *vastly* different from other peoples\'. It might
be unorthodox thinking in that vein that the Zhodani find troubling and send
to get re-educated.

IMTU, *ANYTHING* inside the jump bubble goes with them.  One of my old groups 
that I GM\'ed took a chunk of a missile with them when they jumped.  It banged 
against the hull about 2 secs into the jump, making a loud noise, but not 
exploding.  Shook the party up a bit, but did no damage other than cosmetic, 
as the bubble cut off the missile\'s power supply that it needed to detonate.

They never did figure out what that thump was.  <grin>

Well, I was someone who once maintained that there wasn\'t a problem
with simply using all the fuel for energy for jump.  I must now
way that I think Ian is right.  (Though I do think that linking
the burning of fuel to the act of jumping, so you can burn the fuel
without either jumping or melting the reaction, works).

I think it is also unfair to call it a reducto ad absurdum argument.
The passage says it is burned for fuel.  It even says it can be
stored in capacitors (which can be used to power weapons).  He
is mearly pointing out the consequences of that.

Just goes to show how things kind differ from ship to ship. John F. Kennedy

Actually it doesn\'t.  In the GT design system, the cost of cargo
space is much lower than the cost of fuel tanks, as is the cost
of simple armor against micrometeorites.  When you take them
with you, they are, by necessity, only used once per jump (say
10 days).  If you leave them around, then other ships can use
them (and you might, if you got into vehicles) use cheaper tanks
since they don\'t represent a hazard to the ship while it is
travelling in system or in jump.

Lets look at system that is so marginal that it _only_ gets
Free Traders as it total shipping.  A Free Trader gets 24% more cargo,
but if you account for the drop in ship price, it gains
a 49% increase in revenue per $ invested in the ship.
That more than pays for the drop tanks hanging around.  If
you can get even one ship a day, then you save 90% of that
price.

Of course you have to deliver fuel to the tanks.
To make the tanks part of a tanker ships (you just pull
your fuel right from the ship), that adds 14 MCr to the
cost, amortizing over a 40 year period, that a thousand
credits a day.  (Salaries add a small amount to that).
If a Free trader is willing to include a 24% increase in cost
(which will we assume is just mortgage costs since they
are the biggest cost, about 3,722 Cr/day) then he is
willing to pay 930 Cr/day for tankers.  This means
that if you get 2 or more ships a day, you come out
ahead.  That puts us down around a BTN of 6.5.  You
would have to increase by an order of magnitude to
qualify as a minor route.  Almost every world will
have some drop tank service, even if it a tanker ship
waiting around.
[I am assuming that the 100Cr/ton cost for fuel at the
jump point only applies to ports with orbital components]

I understand that the log scale of Far Trader can handle this,
but it is a change from the default situation described and I\'m
not clear that a GM won\'t have to come up with a new distance
mod table (unless that isn\'t based on the assumption about the
average jump distance?) and a new cargo rate.

I didn\'t get the play around with his head part. I just figured that
Dulinor\'s plot was compromised.  INI or S3 took out Dulinor and his brother
who was a co-conspirator was "retired" in recognition of his long Imperial
service and because some of his subordinates (who might or might not have
been in on it) wouldn\'t stand for his just disappearing or having his ship
blow up. IN officers are just completely unreasonable about such things.

I don\'t think that you\'d be off base by placing a lost colony of Vilani in 
Five Sisters.  Vanejen, in the Rhylanor subsector, was described in "Research 
Station Gamma" as having originally been settled by Vilani c. -4000, just 
prior to the Interstellar Wars.  If they got to one side of the Marches, it 
wouldn\'t be stretching probability to place another colony on the opposite 
side.  The Vilani were at Jump 2 at that time, and could have traversed the 
space from Vanejen by several routes.  There would have been no interstellar 
states to bar their way, the Sword Worlds were uninhabited, and the Darrians 
were still primitives.  However, I doubt that such a world, effectively 
isolated from the rest of the Vilani Imperium would have been an official 
colony.  It would be more likey that it would have been settled by people who 
desired to escape the grasp of Imperial rule, for reasons of their own.

Hope this helps.  Just to be curious, what world is this?

1)	Does the Imperium control all starports in a system or just the best

an Imperial Starport, or would the STA boss simply pass \'em or would it be
up to him/her as circumstances dictate? 
3)	Would imperial marines be garrisoned at the ports as security, or
would it just be tendered by STA to a local security company (or do the STA
have their own security forces)?
4)	Would an imperial governor (do all imperial world\'s have them?) have
his/her/its residence at the port? If so, would he/she/it have a bunch of

	That\'s a good question.  I\'ve always assumed that the
sector/subsector
	system was a Vilani invention that\'s just been kept ever since by
	subsequent Imperia.  The library data entries for "astrogation" and

	I don\'t think they are (although the Vargr in Provence and Gvurrdon
	probably are because (1) it\'s easier to swipe an existing system
than to
	come up with one on their own and (2) they tend to interact more

	The local world is responsible for enforcing its own laws, so
exiting
	the starport means clearing the local world\'s customs -- which may
	include metal detectors, x-ray machines, strip searches,
interrogations,
	or whatever law level, tech level, starport class, and all of the
other
	circumstances indicate.  

	The Imperium is charged with enforcing law and order in the
starport. 
	Entering the starport involves clearing starport security.  What
that
	entails depends on the starport, its security needs, etc.

	There are several applications. Most notably, law level (which has
always 
	been the Traveller default when mentioning guns).  Course, the
Imperium nor 
	Reformation Coalition nor any other interstellar govt (maybe the
Zhos) have 
	the means, the will, or the way to really enforce it.  This is much
more 
	appropriate than the musings on the causes of the incident in
Littleton...  
	IMO.  YMMV.  You hear the argument "all too often" because it\'s
true.  :-)

	Anyone w/ a knife could\'ve done much worse w/ just blades and
perfectly legal 
	and mundane chemicals, with knowledge gained from the internet
(amongst other 
	places).  The knee-jerk reflex is to put restrictions on guns, not
that it 
	would\'ve stopped this trajedy (or any others, really), but that\'ll
make some 
	people feel good, regardless of the actual effectiveness, but like
most 
	legislation and public thought on this topic (gun control), is very
short 
	sighted and is very aptly summed up as paranoia.

	Indeed it would seem you\'re not acquainted with knives (and most
likely guns, 
	particularly handguns, too).  Do try to shed some light on how
ridiculous it 
	is. :-) 
	This should be entertaining...  You do have some practical
experience and 
	knowledge on what you speak, perhaps?  What do you base your opinion
on, 
	Chris?

	I knew how to do neat things w/ a knife long before I joined the
Marines.  
	I\'m kinda rusty, as I\'m in tanks, and if I ever get to the point
where I need 
	to use a knife, something is VERY wrong (even worse than if I\'d have
to use 
	the 9mm). 

	> If you must come up with an argument to justify your ownership and
love of
	> firearms, find a better one than this. Let\'s get serious, folks.

	I don\'t need to justify anything, much less here.  Those 2 wimps
could\'ve 
	easily killed 15 people with knives, homemade explosives with common

	materials, and any other number of methods that would\'ve been easily

	available to them.  Do you want me to list some?  It\'s very easy,
actually.  
	The thing I find surprising is that only 15 were killed, given all
the bombs 
	that were planted (especially the ones on the propane tanks), though
it seems 
	very few went off (did any?).

	Of course, the reflex response from "leadership" like the
President\'s is to 
	restrict 18 year olds from gun ownership and to put a waiting period
on 
	explosives (not that I think that would\'ve affected the bombs these
guys made 
	anyways, especially if they had the girlfriends buy them, but i\'m
not sure on 
	the exact specifications of their explosives... has it been released
yet?).  
	Nor would any of the proposed weapons restrictions (short of the
extreme 
	left-wing ambititions to ban them entirely) have stopped Littleton
from 
	happening.  Yeah, you can be drafted for war, but let\'s not allow
you to 
	drink or own a handgun (not that anything will stop an 18 year old
from doing 
	either, anways, right?)...

	Suppose the inventor -- or at least the patent owner -- is a
	megacorporation (which seems likely).  Megacorporations are very
	vigilant about their intellectual property, and have lawyers and
	investigators in every sector or even subsector who are in charge of
	just that.  (See the feature article on SuSAG, LIC, in JTAS.)  The
one
	who stole the idea is probably also a good-sized company.  So the
PCs
	might be engaged as independent contractors to engage in some
self-help
	against the other company, or to gather evidence, as the lawyers
	commence litigation.

back of
	>one and have power coming out of our ears ?

	OK, here\'s where I sketch the solution.

	For a start, it\'s not the jump drive that creates power from
hydrogen.
	because it\'s already been shown that the jump drive can take power
from
	_any_ ultra-high current source to power it, such as a black globe\'s
	capacitors.

	That large amount of  power must be discharged rapidly to warp
spacetime and
	kick the ship into jump space.
	(I\'m assuming maintenance of the jump field via the lanthanum grid
actually
	takes relatively little power, and coming out is more a factor of
the
	gravity well you hit, as per the rules allowing a ship to exit
J-space
	before it\'s destination if it hots a rogue stellar mass on it\'s
"path". )

	This implies a very high current "switch" of some sort needs to be
thrown
	when you\'re ready to jump.

	That switch, because of the amount of power involved, needs to go
from open
	circuit to closed in as short a time as possible, because for the
duration
	of the switching it will be soaking that entire potential
diffference.
	Taking that further, _unless_ you are going to discharge all that
power in
	one go, you need something capable of regulating the current
equivalent of
	your 3*10^21 MJ

	So, the reason you can\'t power a 20,000 EP R Meson from the jump
capacitors
	is because the technology to regulate current at those power levels
doesn\'t
	exist, only the binary off/on switching technology exists.  And we
can go
	further, and state that the  binary switching is "once-only", like a
	thyristor or SCR, i.e: we can\'t use pulse techniques to regulate it,
because
	we can\'t turn it off again.
	without removing all the power from it or slagging the switch

	So, yes, it _would_ be possible to power some (currently imaginary)
factor
	XXX meson gun from the single discharge of your jump capacitors, but
trying
	to power something as "small" as an R meson results only in a melted
pile of
	scrap metal where your meson gun used to be.

	A nice GM might let you get one extra powerful shot out of your
destructing
	meson, like a detonation laser, or he might not, ruling that the
meson
	cooking also takes out other systems. (i.e, the rest of the ship)

	Yes, this allows the possibility of super powerful single shot
weapon
	systems out there somewhere....

	But even that could be eliminated merely by stating that no-one\'s
been able
	to build a weapon (so far) tthat can use all that power without
slagging,
	and the only reason the jump drive can handle the power is that it
no longer
	exists in real space at the instant it activates and takes all the
	power.....

	This suggests that "timing problems" of mere nano-seconds between
activating
	the power feed switch and the jump unit could cause a huge secondary
	discharge into surrounding equipment resulting in catastrophic
system
	damage. (i.e: the ship blows up )

	Obviously, the two switches need to be tightly ganged...

	And yes, I now have this picture in my head of the ship\'s engineer
throwing
	one of those huge pole switches beloved of Frankenstien movies and
such
	(though nothing like that would be able to handle this sort of
current )
	<grin>

	Frankly, one of the reasons I like this idea is that it emphaizes
how
	_dangerous_ jump drives are, because of the amount of energy  you\'re
	throwing around.

One logical grouping is a battery. A battery can be:
  1) A single spinal mount
  2) A single bay (50 or 100 dtons)
  3) A collection of 1 to 10 turrets.

One of the criticisms of HG was that you could not mix and match - if you had a fusion 
bay, you could not have fusion turrets...etc...

Fusion or Plasma (one or the other, not both) turrets or bays (one or the other, not 
both).

Repulsors were focused anti-grav projectors mounted in bays designed to smack missiles 
around. Think of them as force beams, but only useful in deflecting small objects 
(missiles).

For the record, I am a huge HG fan - its my favorite system, even with its

When CIWS was first introduced to the Fleet, an interesting change had to done the sabots for CIWS, ie the black colored sabots were extremely hard to find as FOD on carrier\'s flight deck, solution the carrier mounted CIWS fired a bright orange colored sabot. 

How far did they get in the Mods for CIWS while you were in? I had only Mod 1\'s.

Earth\'s diameter is just under 8,000 miles -- therefore, size 8.
Meanwhile, about 70% of the earth\'s surface is water, therefore 
hydrographics = 7. As for a starport, sure we have one. A Class E
starport is basically a big flat open area with a sign saying "Land
Here", which we have. Otherwise, where would the Space Shuttle land?
But can the buildings and support facilities for the shuttle be taken
as sufficient for a class D port, or are we class E?

No, you don\'t. There is nothing to prevent you doing that if you wish.

But that isn\'t using your _jump_ capacitors to power something. That\'s using
a specialy constructed smaller capacity capacitor. If you reduce the size of
the capacitor to the level at which you can regulate the current flow, turn
it on and off, etc, then you have limited yourself to what conventional
power plants can do anyway, and there is no "super-weapon" problem, and no
real gain in doing it either.

I don\'t see the problem myself.

That is a possibility, but represents more unknowns, such as what happens to
the ship with effectively part of it\'s structure breaking through the jump
field ?  It may be safe, but it equally might not.

Though I agree that doing it this way would make it less possible to use the
energy for other purposes.

These last are not problems, IMO. Drop tanks don\'t _have_ to be disposable,
it\'s just that the ones Tukera was using were.
If you want a reason why a disposable drop tank can\'t just be re-used, the
"explosive bolts" don\'t have to shred the tank. they just need to stress it
enough to require a spaceworthines inspection.by the Imperial Aerospace
Authority or equivalent.

This means that while some sleazy tramp starship ( like a player\'s ship )
might try and reuse a "non-resable" drop tank, taking the risk of that
O-ring failure)  Tukera wouldn\'t, and neither under normal circumstances
would the military..

It also adds another plot possibilty. Everyone knows about the lucrative
trade in illict aircraft parts with faked IAA/FAA airworthiness certificates
I presume ? Hike the prices involved tostarship level, and you have a real
scam for a few "pirates" to run.
"Sure, they\'re new drop tanks. No way I\'d sell you used ones, IAA would sue
myu butt if I did. Anyway, it wouldn\'t have one of these here
Spaceworthiness Cetificates saying it\'s new otherwise, would it ?

Personally, I think using pipes is perfectly fine. The only problem is
whether a tanker is profitable enough to operate. For the military, a fleet
tender could perform the job, and they do now in RL. But how many commercial
ships in RL bother with the hassle of ship-to-ship refuelling ?  The
neccessary equipment, the neccessary pilot\'s ratings, the risk of an
accident....just isn\'t worth it.

If you want to get rid of drop tanks or tankers, I wouldn\'t argue over the
tanks themselves, I\'d bring a question to the Imperial equivalent of Ralph
Nader about whether the idea of these big capacitors sitting there with this
absolutely _huge_ amount of energy in them, straining to get out, requiring
just a few unlikley malfunctions in some redundant systems, based on some
poorly understood usage of recovered Ancients technology, is really all that
safe.

Compared to them capacitors, a nuclear power plant is a squib. And look at
how much protest and concern there was over nuclear powr plant safety !

I would suggest, at a minimum, if people are using "tankers" or the
equivalent concept, that due to the danger involved ( a malfunction could
result in discharge of the capacitors back into the facility)  is a crime to
charge one\'s jump capacitors within five million kilometres (or some other
arbitrary safe distance)  of an orbital facility or on the ground. This
neatly eliminates the idea of a ship charging it\'s capacitors directly from
fuel piped to it by an orbital or ground-based facility and therefore
requires the use of some sort of tanker.

>It\'s the delay I don\'t like.

Why ? (other than the dangers I mention above)

>On the Tech Level issue, I can accept that they are TL16
>(or experimental TL15 in the same way as black globes).
>Alternatively, I could accept that they are TL9.
>(As *ALL* the ship design rules imply.)

I think you misunderstand the situation. The construction of a drop tank is
TL8-9. It\'s only a tank with some quick release couplings and explosive
bolts, after all.  The construction of the high energy  _capacitors_ which
let you _use_ drop tanks is TL16.

The reference in JTAS-2 made it abundantly clear that it was easy to
construct drop -tanks, which is why they were being constructed locally. but
that only Core could construct the capacittors. Constructing the drop-tanks
just meant that the Spinward main could be serviced by drop-tank ships
coming from the Core.

It could be since Arbellatra Alkhalikoi (Regent 622-629, Empress 629-666)

Green Arrow is a DC comics hero. His schtick is that he\'s an expert archer.
He dresses up in a green neo-Robin Hood outfit and he has a number of arrows
that have special effects. He\'s got exploding arrows, arrows that spew
smoke, arrows that spew sleeping gas, arrows with climbing rope attached...

That is indeed the problem with the ban on assault weapons... (I have trouble 
explaining it to my wife). The politicians say (these weapons) were banned. 
What was banned was the manufacture, not possession or sale. That\'s what 
makes it so hard for many people to understand why (the kids in Littleton) 
could buy a TEC-9 if indeed it was banned.

Of course, this is probably the incremental strategy of the gun-banners. If 
enough people ask "If its banned, why is it still available?" and the next 
step becomes easier for the politicians.

BTW, the Brady Bill stopped 250,000 felons from buying guns, but the Justice 
Department has arrested only about 8 of them. Why weren\'t the other 249,992 
arrested?

The Vilani Empire was the first major interstellar empire to establish itself 
in this region of space; the effects of that Empire on worlds throughout this 
region are still evident in language and social structure.

The power of the Vilani Empire came from the economic benefits it could 
confer on its members. To protect that power, the Empire established a rigid 
structure of technology control laws (the Patent Laws) which discouraged any 
innovation not coming from the established industrial structure. Those few 
citizens who dabbled in invention risked bankruptcy for themselves and 
poverty for their children if their work did not pass the arcane requirements 
of the Patent Laws.

The Vilani Patent Laws actually covered all intellectual property: the broad 
range of patents, copyrights, and trademarks. 

The real purpose was to suppress the advance of technology (especially that 
which would possibly challenge the stranglehold of the First Imperium).

I\'ve been watching this thread with some interest.
Here\'s my Cr 0.02 :-

Construct an energy budget :-
1. illumination by primary and other bodies
2. heat dissipation by enclosed object

1. The \'solar constant\' is 1353W/square metre at 150 million km (1 AU).
It varies directly with luminosity, with the inverse square of distance
from the primary and inversely with atmospheric pressure (considering
insolation on the surface of the Earth, say).

Mercury, at an average distance of ~58 million km from the sun receives
(2.5)^2 = 6.25X as much insolation, or approx. 8200W/square metre.

Base reflected energy is given by insolation X albedo (reflectivity) ;
typical values are as follows (from the GT \'First In\' supplement) :-
Planet Type      Base Albedo
Stone World      0.02
Ice World        0.45
Sulfur World     0.80
Desert World     0.02
Ocean World
(less than 30%)  0.02
(30% - 59%)      0.10
(60% - 89%)      0.20
(90% or more)    0.28
Ammonia World    0.50
Subgiant         0.50

Reflected energy is going to be a very small component. Recall that this

will be the total energy radiated over a sphere of enormous area.

2. How much energy will be radiated into the BG from the inside?
All objects within the field with a temperature above absolute zero will

radiate heat.

For a spacecraft or other installation, use the peak power plant output
multiplied by some factor (how efficient do you think Trav power systems

are?) plus 90W per crew member (adult human sized ; 1.1W/kg mass
assuming human adult metabolic rates for other critters).

Planetary bodies radiate heat from the decay of various radioisotopes
(e.g. potassium in the mantle and core of the Earth). I don\'t have
figures for this \'geothermal component\'. I\'d use 10% of albedo as a
starting ballpark figure.

Charles also wrote :-

Black globes are \'opaque\' to electromagnetism and matter. Radiation is
initially absorbed by the field. Matter is reduced to showers of
elementary particles.

Gravitational interactions are *not* affected (unless you subscribe to
the \'black globe as pocket universe\' concept. \'Bobbles\', anyone?).

Energy released during such interactions is radiated into space or
stored in capacitors.

Radiation is the most likely route of energy dissipation, for
thermodynamic reasons. The black globe behaves like a black hole when
stuff is thrown at it. Some of the energy is stored in the capacitors
(exact fraction depends on TL).

Unfortunately, using this idea makes BGs much less \'stealthy\' than
described in canon.

Slight digression :-
As described in TNE\'s FF&S (an electron cloud), they sound like the
field used to cover New York in the James Blish short story \'The Box\' -
all the ozone that came off the field, and the electrical injuries
sustained by those that contacted it...

For the same reason the ship\'s bridge, fuel tanks, engineering, cargo,
staterooms, and everything else "right next to" the jump drive goes along
with the ship. The mechanism depends on your personal jump theory; the jump
grid believers will say drop tanks must have a grid on their surface
connected to the ship\'s jump grid; the jump coil crowd would say the tanks
have to be built inside the generated jump field.

How can the ship jump within 10 diameters of the drop tank? The same way it
can jump within 10 diameters of a grappled craft, sensor array, or
interstellar hydrogen atoms. Theories have included that the restriction
only applies to objects larger than the ship, that the danger is to the
outermost areas of the ship (like the jump tanks themselves), or that the
"10 diameter limit" is actually a simplification of a more complex rule.
Again, the handwave depends on YTU.

Why can\'t you carry other stuff with the drop tanks? You can, but it gets
destroyed along with the tanks.

Starships have been jumping with things "right next to" them since Book 1.
Jump tanks don\'t change anything. The reason for the "discard into jump
space" theory is to explain why jump tanks cannot be reused *without*
adding any more wacky jump drive behavior. The big flaw with the theory is
the  "ships eject tanks then jump" quote in JTAS 2.

Which might explain the reduction in Oberlindes Lines stock
when it was announced that the Tukera drop capable ships are on the way.

BTW, your calcs above depend on making the ship completely dependant on drop
tanks.
This might be acceptable on a safe Core route. But it would be a big risk
relying on this in the Spinward Marches.

>There realy is no reason why
>all long distance cargos wouldn\'t go jump-6.

Yes, there is actually.
Existing capital expenditure. (i.e: we can\'t afford a new ship now)
The fact that not all worlds are Jump-6 apart  The fact that not all worlds
have support for drop-tanks.

Perhaps the real costs of the capacitors used to allow drop-tanks are being
hidden as part of an attempt to break into the market.
Maybe every five thousand hours you have to replace those capacitors.

Or, perhaps as the raw materiels being used in these capacitors become more
in demand the price will increase (perhaps this has already happened) making
new drop-tank ships too expensive.

There are all sorts of reasons that can be used to explain this. Think about
why not all ships in the real world are not super tankers or container
ships, and why not all aircraft flights go between main cities.


>(Now I think
>that J-4 X-boats aren\'t a problem with the existing traveller

Which is why they\'re slowly being replaced by a J6 network. Rememember,
replacing the boat isn\'t the difficulty, it\'s the support services that
cost, and the political fallout if you remove a world from the network.

I wouldn\'t. I\'d say he can _use_ them.

But, a collapsible tank that you take with you doesn\'t give you anything
over internal tankage.
The reason you leave the drop tanks behind is that you don\'t have to jump
with the mass of the tanks that way.
Maybe a collapsible tank provides a slight reduction on mass over normal
tanks, but it wouldn\'t be much.

It might let you use cargo space for tankage if you wanted.

>Then he says, "well, can I use these capacitors with my weapons.

Or you give him a non-arbitrary reason that _does_ follow from the described
effect, such as the one I detailed recently, about the lack of materiels or
force technology capable of regulating such super high currents.

>Then he says, "Well, I want to set up a jump station so my

Or you don\'t. I\'d say you can use a "jump-station".  It\'s not that it\'s
physically impossible, but that it\'s non-profitable.
Playing with high energy is dangerous, one mistake and you can kiss good-bye
to your multi-billion credit jump station. And it may not be your mistake.
Some tramp trader comes through with an improperly synchronized switching
unit, and bang !

Them dangerous jump things should be done as far away from expensive
stations as possible.

Or say they do exist, then there\'s the economic argument. There\'s no way a
single ship can make a proftable run on the routes that supported such a
system, as the big companies would control the stations, (or at least get
larger volume discounts).
The only place a free trader could make money is _outside_ the main runs
where these stations don\'t exist.

>The he puts aside the other things he was thinking of doing

>plant to the jump stations and just transmitting power)

Which doesn\'t really help because the power plant is required for all the
_other_ things apart from jump, including maintaining the jump field and
life support. Remember, the high energy capacitors cannot be regulated, they
discharge in one large  burst.

You could install lower energy cpacitirs to provide this energy. but that
would be like using a glider for freight transportation or passenger
service.  One might then speculate on why there are only military and
recreational uses for gliders IRL.

Brings up a great idea though,. cheap military troop transports, no power
plant, injected into jump-space, rely on minimal maneuvering jets on the
other side, or pickup by a fleet tender. Also useful for bulk cargo runs.
Hey, I like this idea, one could have players investigate why the cargo pods
are going missing. Or have them ride a miitary "glider", and realize why no
pilot likes being such a sitting duck...

Still, there\'s the problem of the danger of feeding all that power in and
having it go boom.

You misunderstand the effect of drop tanks. It does _not_ get around the
amount of fuel you need to jump, you still need the same amount of fuel, it
just reduces the internal tankage requirements allowing smaller ships to
jump further.

It only becomes hokey and contrived if you try to limit the possibilities
for no good reason. This is the same in almost any game. You should never
say "such and such is impossible because..".  You say "Are you aware of the
problems with that approach ?"
Nothing is ever impossible, there are just good reasons why it isn\'t (or
hasn\'t been) done.

One good approach, if you\'re not the sort of person who come up with good
and consistent drawbacks on the fly, is the psycho-analyst approach. If your
players say "Why can\'t we do X?", respond with "Why do you think you can\'t
do X?". Be careful about being too obvious though, as then they\'ll just give
facetious answers. Often, with this approach, the players will convince
themselkves they don\'t realy want to try that, especially if you grin evily
when they mention a possible negative consequence.

I\'m a gridder.  IMTU, the grid forms a jump bubble a couple meters from the 
hull in the shape of the grid.

Not if it\'s fully contained inside the jump bubble.

You ditch the tanks.  If they clear the bubble, fine, they don\'t go for the ride.  If they don\'t *quite* clear it, some of it comes with and the rest is left behind.  Either way, who cares?

It could *help* explain why freight transport pretty much collapsed during the 
Rebellion, too.  I seem to recall a figure of interstellar trade being down on 
the order of 90%.

Correct.

The reason you leave the tanks behind, under HG, is because it lowers your 
total displacement, and the engines are calculated on displacement.  A bigger 
engine in a smaller ship will go farther.

> tanks, but it wouldn\'t be much.

Collapsable tankage doesn\'t gain you a thing, really.  If you\'re looking for 
maximum cargo space, strip out all but power plant fuel and use drop tanks / 
fueling stations / whatever.  But the first time somebody takes out your 
fueling station, you\'re *STUCK* until you can get some drop tanks shipped in.  
And in backwater systems, that could be a good long wait.

Cargo space you can\'t use costs you money.

IMTU, it\'s *possible* to have ships with just power plant fuel jump just off 
fueling stations, but the location of the campaign (Reavers\' Deep) *and* the 
era (ca 1123, late Rebellion period) preclude the ease of finding a working 
fueling station.  In the Deep, they\'re just not there, even in relatively 
civilised areas like Caledon.  The advantages are known, of course, but so are 
the downsides, and no Caledonian wants to be stuck anywhere, really.

The discharge just opens up the jump point.  The power plant keeps the bubble

That\'s basically my take on it.  I\'ve had characters get drop tanks to use on 
a one shot trip because they had to be someplace in under 3 weeks, while if 
they would have stuck to the normally accessible route, it would have taken a 
couple months or so.  They burned the drop tank fuel, ditched the tanks, and 
jumped into empty space, then did a 24 hr check on the drives and finished the 
jump.  They didn\'t hack away all their tankage because they knew there were 
limited possibilities of getting more drop tanks.

Cheapies are more vulnerable.  If you hit an armoured fuel station, broken

A hull will last more than 40 years.  You can concievably get 5 recipts of 
\'Free Trader\', which gives you a 40 year old ship that\'s totally paid off and 
still useable.  And *perfect* for rolling on the \'ship\'s quirks\' table

Bridge, power plant, life support, etc is *in addition to* the 100KCr/ton of a 
hull.  And that hull is *strong*, AF40 in Striker or MT.  There\'s no *way* you 
can convince me that a drop tank is that strong, which is what I base my 
opinions on.  If it *were* possible, hulls would be two orders of magnitude 
cheaper.

No clue, really.  In \'The Traveller Adventure\', a set of 50 ton dismountables 
is quoted as 50KCr, but IMNSFBHO, that\'s too low for a semipermenant fixture. 
500KCr is more in line, methinks.

Or have them be a corporate fueling point, and unless the characters happen to work for that corporation, they\'re SOL.

In our Mad Mike\'s Marauders game I had a black Moslem Solomani fighter pilot
known as "Hash" Mahommet who always had a toke "to calm his nerves" before
every combat op.

And doen\'t every Scout modify his hydroponics unit to grow marijuana ?
Or create a still ?

Our current Alternity game has two alcoholic characters in it, and don\'t

I don\'t see any conflict.  There are two kinds of worlds in the
Imperium:  (1) member states, which maintain their sovereignty subject
to the requirements of membership in the Imperium, and (2) worlds wholly
owned by the Imperium, which are simply Imperial installations.  

Remember, the Imperium also owns, or at least controls, starports, which
are often located on the surface of a member world.  Similarly, Imperial
naval and Scout bases are not located in space.  Ownership and control
of these installations is not an extension of Imperial power into the
governance of member worlds.  

The bottom line is that the phrase "controlling the \'space _between_
worlds\'" is just shorthand for a more complex concept.

(1)  I\'m sure that golf will sweep through the Ziru Sirka during the
latter part of the Interstellar Wars and the beginning of the Rule of
Man.  It\'s just too perfect a game for the Vilani.  By the time of the
founding of the Third Imperium, many Vilani will believe that it is
actually a Vilani game that has become popular among the Solomani.

(2)  X-Files variant:  Golf is a Vilani game.  A Vilani ship crashed off
the Orkney Islands in Pictish times.  The survivors were able to salvage
their golf clubs and manual.  After founding the Pictish culture and
making the bagpipe a more efficient weapon, they settled down to relax
and taught the Scots how to play golf.

It depends on the particular system.

Normally, the Imperial Starport Authority (SPA) and the local world
government cooperate on matters of pursuit, extradition, smuggling,
etc., but (1) Imperial policy may dictate different results and (2) the
SPA has considerable discretion.  

The only circumstance under which a citizen of an Imperial member state
can claim Imperial asylum is escape from slavery.

I don\'t remember, but there is an article on Starport Authority in the
Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society which will give the answer.

> 4)      Would an imperial governor (do all imperial world\'s have them?)

No.  Most member worlds of the Imperium are self-governing.  An Imperial
marquis may be appointed over a world and a count over two or three
worlds.  These Imperial nobles exercise vast powers over the worlds
assigned to them.  Only worlds of strategic importance to the Imperium
are under such direct Imperial control.  I suspect that most of these
are near the core of the Imperium.  

> have his/her/its residence at the port? 

An Imperial marquis in charge of an entire world would probably maintain
an estate somewhere on the world.  In addition, a marquis is normally
granted a fief on a very large scale for personal use.  

> If so, would he/she/it have a bunch of marines as guards?

(The following is definitely in my Traveller universe, and not addressed
in canon.)  Prior to Empress Arbellatra\'s reforms, the Imperial armed
forces were often raised by Imperial nobles and owed loyalty to them. 
The Emperors of the Flag were all admirals whose main power bases were
the personnel in their fleets, who owed them, not the Emperor, fealty as
vassals.  Arbellatra brought the Imperial naval and military forces into
the civil service model, with conscription, merit promotions, officer
academies, abolition of purchases and grants of commissions, etc.  Most
important, Arbellatra created a culture in which Imperial naval and
military personnel owed loyalty directly to the Emperor and the
Imperium, not to intermediate liege lords.

So, the answer to your question is, it depends on the time period.  In
the CT/MT/GT time frames, the Imperial noble of the levels indicated
would be responsible for his or her own guards.  The noble would have
the authority to call on the regular Imperial forces for assistance as
needed.

> 5)      Would the imperial navy have crew stationed at port batteries/screens?

Only in time of war, when starports are converted to naval facilities.

> 6)      Would people travelling in sub or small craft from port to elsewhere

Yes, you have to clear customs every time you enter the starport, and
every time you enter the member world from the starport.

The Imperium hardly restricts anything (at least by the CT era).  Aside
from nuclear weapons, which we\'ve been discussing recently, the only
other weapon that the Imperium prohibits, so far as I know, is a certain
Hiver warbot, individual possession of which is an Imperial High Crime.  

The Imperium\'s extremely laissez-faire attitude arises from its
perception of itself as far stronger than any internal threat -- and it
does what it must to keep itself that strong.  E.g., only the Imperium
has fleets of warships.  A given member state may raise a squadron or
two, but not enough to threaten the peace of the realm.  

In the scale of Imperial concerns, destruction related to weapons that
can only kill dozens of people at a time is just too small to worry
about.  That\'s in the jurisdiction of member states.  The Emperor has
much bigger fish to fry.

The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, of course, the Imperium
does regulate weapons possession on Imperial installations of any kind
- -- starports, Capital, research stations, naval/military/Scout
facilities, etc.

My PCs never seem to find drugs, except caffeine, alcohol, and aspirin
- -- but then I haven\'t run many mercenaries who would look for combat
drug or slow drug.

On the other hand, a campaign that I ran included drugs and drug dealing
as part of the Fifth Frontier War.  I called the drug "bubble".  It was
a psionic booster/inducer.  It stimulated the part of the brain that
produces psionic phenomena, so even untrained or apparently
zero-potential humans would experience various psionic effects.  It was
normally cut with a hallucinogen so that the users wouldn\'t be able to
separate the boosted psi from non-psi hallucinations, and with a
synthetic opiate to make it highly addictive.  

The Imperials assumed that the Zhodanis were behind its importation, for
the purpose of destabilizing the Spinward Marches in preparation for
invasion.  The Zhodanis assumed that the Imperials were using it to
destabilize Cronor subsector.  In fact, the Confederation of Arden was
behind it.  Arden, in cooperation with SuSAG, LIC, had developed the
drug as a psychological warfare weapon.  A rogue SuSAG manager saw an
opportunity to make a lot of money as the sole manufacturer of a highly
addictive drug, and engaged certain Ine Givar elements to sell it on the
most loyal Imperial worlds.  

Because of real world concerns, the campaign didn\'t get to the part
where the PCs are involved in any of several attempts (INI, Zhodani
intelligence, Ine Givar political wing, etc.) to take out the SuSAG
manager and the Arden manufacturing facility.

There is a misunderstanding here, I thought it was Vilani copyright laws
that kept the First Imperium static at GTL10 for ten millenia.

Solomani influence in the Second Imperium must have freed things up alot.
The Third Imperium probably implements something more like modern day Earth,
in Vilani terms that would probably make it look like an anarchy with
no proper concept of intellectual property.

Frank, you are edging close to the Great Piracy Debate.

Please dont go there.

Personally, I would argue the Marches are, as a heavily militarized
frontier, among the more secure places in the Imperium.

After all, there is a BatRon of Tigresses per fleet, and an average of a
fleet per subsector, right ?

Drop tanks result in substantial per parsec efficiency increases for jump-4
to -6 craft.

Drop ships actually have a smaller capital requirement *per dton of carried
cargo*, which makes them far easier to afford. The smaller capital costs
also make them less vulnerable to jumps in interest rates.

Even if only the Golden Routes (Trin-Mora for example) go to drop tanks
initially, there will be major knock on effects, as internal tankage ships
are forced away from the Golden Routes and onto secondary and tertiary routes.

That explains the mule train I saw on the way back from Goulburn.

Some technologies are so efficient as to be revolutionary. Drop tanks for
Traveller starships are such a technology.

The other thing to remember is that drop tank ships can be built as small
as any other freighter.

The infrastructure is cheap. Real cheap. It\'s shuttles carrying tanks.

Remember, you are using less of those expensive jump drives and so on per
dton of cargo moved.

Prove it. The numbers that have been kicked around indicate at least a 25%
jump in efficiency - and thats assuming amortisation of the shuttles and
tankage.

>Playing with high energy is dangerous, one mistake and you can kiss good-bye
>to your multi-billion credit jump station. 

You are talking tankage and hose, plus a small command module, a power
plant and a bunch of external grapples for shuttles. The whole thing would
be in the KCr 100 per dton range.

The model for ports, airports and petrol stations is a 3rd party owns them,
and various companies lease space and services.

I see no reason for jump tanks to be any different - it\'s just a matter of
shuttles to take and connect full tanks to the ships.

Ahhh, but they are now competing with all the corporate internal-tankage

Drop tanks dont do this. Drop tanks allow more payload to be moved, by not
requiring you to take all that empty tankage with you into jumpspace.

There is another explainiation. It seemed like a good idea at the time, and

If half a 3 dton jump drive is capacitors that can contain 3*10^21 joules,
then we should be able to build a much smaller capacitor that will still
hold quantities of energy that are quite reasonable by Ditzie\'s standards.

If the other half of the 3 dton jump drive turns 20 dtons of LHyd into that
much power, then again we should be able to scale that down to some extent.

Ummm, what we have done is enabled much bigger weapons in much smaller

You remind me of the scenario I\'ve always wanted to pull on some
"hack\'n slash" type gamers. It\'s based on a song. "One Tin Soldier"
(aka "theme to Billy Jack").

For those not familar with it...

We\'ve got a "kingdom on a mountain" and "the valley folk". Legend has
it that the mountain people have an incredibly valuable treasure buried
beneath a stone. 

So the valley people send a message demanding the treasure. The reply?
"With our brothers we will share,
 all the treasures of our mountain,
 all the riches buried there."

This pisses off the valley folk and they attack the mountain kingdom to
get the treasure that they "deserve". 

Finally they stand beside the stone, having slain all the mountain
people. 

"Now they stood beside the treasure,
 on the mountain dark and red.
 Turned the stone and looked beneath it.
 \'Peace on Earth\' was all it said..."

[at this point the reply from the mountain folks looks a *lot*
different, doesn\'t it?]

I\'ve run into *many* a gamer who\'d fall for the vallet people\'s cause,
hook, line and sinker. And the look on their faces when they realized
how badly they\'d let their greed sucker them into the massacre would be
priceless.

It ought to be doable in Traveller. Maybe make it a system with two
planets, though the original mountain vs valley bit works just as well
and is likely better suited to an average party.

Wiping out what amounts to a harmless religious community ought to give
them lots of "karma" to work off. Mostly in the form of a reputation
it\'ll take a *long* time to get rid of.

Can you *imagine* the sort of contact offers a merc unit would get
after word of something like this got around? <eg>

Subject: SEC: UNCLASSIFIED Imperial Starports

I got a few queries about Imperial starports. 

1)	Does the Imperium control all starports in a system or just the best
one on the mainworld? If they  control all, does this include F, G & H? 

Well, F,G and H are spaceports rather than starports. The whole issue of
\'what is a starport\' raises it\'s ugly head - if my factory doesnt mind Joe
Trader landing in the car park to minimise delays when picking up a load of
widgets, then is Arlbeth Manufacturing a starport ?

2)	Can someone who evades the local customs/police etc. claim asylum in
an Imperial Starport, or would the STA boss simply pass \'em or would it be
up to him/her as circumstances dictate?

They can claim asylum. Whether or not that helps is up to the Starport
Administrator, and how much they want to stay on the right side of the
planetary authorities.

3)	Would imperial marines be garrisoned at the ports as security, or
would it just be tendered by STA to a local security company (or do the STA
have their own security forces)?

Could be either.

4)	Would an imperial governor (do all imperial world\'s have them?) have
his/her/its residence at the port? If so, would he/she/it have a bunch of
marines as guards?

The world would probably govern itself. The Impertial Legate (or whatever)
may or may not stay within the starport.

5)	Would the imperial navy have crew stationed at port
batteries/screens?

Maybe :)

6)	Would people travelling in sub or small craft from port to elsewhere
on the planet, need to go through customs first?

Yes. How intensive this is depends on the Law Level and such.

You might want to look at G:T Far Trader.

Lets see, 3 million people at 5000 watts each. 15 000 megagwatts ... thats
a fair bit more than a 10 000 dton jump-3 ship needs to stay in jumpspace
(100x25x3, or 7500 megawatts).

Incidentally, 30 billion people at 50 000 watts each is 3x10^9x5*10^4, or
15x10^13 watts. Even if we jack their power demand up to half a megawatt
each, it\'s still only 1.5*10^15, or a lot less than the power a ten
megacredit type A \'jump drive qua power plant\' can put out.

Black globes are over-rated as a military technology in my opinion. If you
can cut the size of spinal mounts by improved capacitor technology, that
would be a real military advantage.

The problem is scaling down the technologies involved. If Zuchai crystals
are so good at storing energy, why cant we use them in other things ?

If *I* had to deal with Duke, I\'d make sure the "diplomatic pouch" went

A smart chief will ask him what kind of plasma it is. Then tell him he

You\'ve fallen victim to a myth. Medieval armor was designed to restrict
mobility as little as possible. And it generaly does a *great* job.
Also, the weight is generally *less* than a typical infantry combat
load and *much* better distributed. 

I can speak with some authority, having *worn* armor.

The biggest drawback is that it gets *hot* in there.

Sorry, but *somewhere* along the line air rifles will be invented. Such
were in use as *military* weapons during the Napoleonic era.

For vehicle mount weapons, steam cannons and centrifugal machine guns
are likely.

What high pressure? We are dealing with *liquid* Hydrogen. The pressure
won\'t be at all high. I\'m not sure what the vapor pressure of LH2 is,
but I bet it\'s only a few psi. So anything above that will suffice to
keep the hydrogen liquid.

And if these are "deep space" refueling points, the hydrogen will
*freeze* unless you install heaters! Anything left to itself will cool
down to 3 K, and hydrogen freezes at 14 K (it liquefies/boils at about
20.5 K)

Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Baikonur Cosmodrome. The ESA launch
site in Guyana. All have more than enough LH2 available. And at least
Kennedy has some *huge* runways, as well as lots of old launch stands
that could quickly be refurbished to handle some pretty large ships.

Not if it\'s designed properly and not filling "to the brim". You\'ll
punch a hole in the tank. But if it\'s a 100 or more meter sphere, made
of light materials, you\'ll have a hole a few cm across, and boiling LH2
escaping. Easily patched before you lose more than a few percent of the
contents. 

For that matter, the "ambient temp" is *below* the freezing point of
hydrogen. You can store it as huge balls of hydrogen ice. Damage *that*
significantly won\'t be easy.

And while destroying the facility *does* deny it to the enemy, it
doesn\'t really *help* your side much. *Capturing* it is a much better
idea. Boost everything to one side for a bit and change the transponder
frequencies and the other side won\'t find it easily, while your side
can.

Have fun when they discover that the locals either don\'t use alcohol
(so they wind up in something like a Middle Eastern "coffee shop", or
the locals consider alcohol *tame*, and they check the menu to find a
list of drugs they\'ve barely even *heard* of. :-)

Dig out whatever ship design system you have and design modules as if
they were sections of a ship. You don\'t need a drive, but at least a
bit of power and life support several hours to a day worth. And
airlocks or at least air-tight hatches where they connect to other
modules. You\'ll also want some "engineering" modules that contain
nothing but power or life support, or sensors, along with the required
controls. 

The modules are best transported by using a ship that normally handles
some sort of small craft or other ship about the same size.

So, for example, you could use the old "modular cutter" design. But I
think the best bet would be an old, retired or about to be retired
battle rider carrier (likely TL-10). That lets the modules be the size
of a battlerider, which is a lot more convenient than the smaller sizes
other ships can carry.

Heck, for a "deep space" refueling point like this, the "tanks" need be
nothing more than *big* plastic balloons. You\'re so far from a star
that you don\'t *need* to insulate them much. Likewise, space debris
will be pretty thin and *generally* slow moving. The faster stuff is
better dealt with (for the tanks) by keeping them relatively flimsy,
and just monitoring for punrures. You then patch tanks that get
punctured. 

This is also an *advantage* if you are attacked. It makes it *real*
easy to threaten to destroy the fuel supply. And with that gone, most
of the reason for attacking is gone. 

BTW, I don\'t *think* anyone would be this crazy, but setting of a nuke
in the middle of a huge tank of LH2 *would* cause some of the hydrogen
to fuse. Enough to make a *big* increase in yield, even though you\'d be
wasting most of it. 

For the *truly* crazy, you place a series of synchronized nukes around
the tank, and cause a much greater portion of it to fuse from the
implosion pressures and temp.

None. As pointed out elsewhere, a tank will radiate away heat until it
is in thermal equilibrium with it\'s surroundings. In interstellar
space, this is the 3 K cosmic background. 

Since hydrogen liquefies at 20.5 K, and freezes at 13 K, you can
practically do without tanks except for enough tankage to handle
refueling the max number of "in a hurry" ships you expect to handle.
You can store the reserves as hydrogen ice. Evaporation losses will be
low at these temps. And the gravel will just crater the ice balls. 

Just keep adding hydrogen to the iceball(s) and eventually you\'ll have
a small asteroid made of hydrogen ice.

Well, as you noted, tech levels *do* vary. Folks may use higher tech
weapons, but they can\'t *rely* on a weapon that can\'t be repaired or

Actually, it can be argued that blade weapons are useful in combat
aboard ship. There are areas where neither side *dares* risk a stray
shot hitting something vital. And a sword will damage a vac suit quite
nicely. In battle dress, a battle-ax type weapon might be better.

In free fall, again, edged weapons may have advantages. You don\'t have
the recoil kicking you all over the place, tough you still need to be
braced on *something* to swing at someone. Thrusts out to work ok,
though it\'ll be hard to do much damage if both attacker & defender are
floating free.

Zero-g fencing will be quite a sight to behold. :-)

Well, there\'s alway the equivalent of the SCA (Society for Creative
Anachronism). We do a lot of fighting with broadswords. 

In one of the Honor Harrington books, we discover that she learned to
shoot a 45 pistol from an uncle in the SCA (which by that time had
moved the "cutoff" data from 1600 to sometime after the 20th century).
This comes as a rude shock to some would be assassins. And later, it
proves fatal to a couple of duellists.

Another thought. I\'ve always been fond of the idea from some of
Norton\'s books (Star Guard, for example) and some of Pournelles ("King
David\'s Spaceship). 

In these, trade with a world is restricted by tech level. Sort of like
a *much* weaker version of the prime directive. This means that
mercenary units (in "Star Guard") specialize in various TLs of warfare.
Likewise, traders need to learn weapons that are acceptable to the TL
restrictions if they want to take them on world. 

This is *definitely* not the canon Imperium, but I think it works
better in some ways. For example, it explains the TL variances a lot
better. Stuff will still leak (in "King David\'s Spaceship" some folks
are put on trial for introducing the horse collar, but get away with
introducing some major improvements in sailing technology), but the
spread will be slower. 

It also makes players far more interested in lower tech weapons. A guy
with blade combat skill can use it almost anywhere. A guy with laser
pistol isn\'t going to be able to use it on a lot of worlds.

LOL

IIRC it means it\'s a spaceport and cannot build starships
(but neither can the equivalent type B starport)
I thought those codes were used for secondary installations
in the system, not the mainworld.

The energy densities in the capacitor are way higher than the normal
weapon accumulators, so it should mean smaller and lighter weapon
systems. I guess I need to do some sums before I can be certain.

But the Gazelle is TL14.
None of the design rules says that drop tanks require TL16 drives.
All we have is one TNS, which is not supported by the design rules.

IMTU drop tanks might be possible at TL16, but since it is set in M0,
it does not matter. If they do work, I\'d probably go with the used
during jump initiation.

I would also look at Heinlein\'s _Beyond This Horizon_, in which the
protagonist, Hamilton Felix, has an M1911A1 custom-made for him.  (In
his society, all gentlemen are assumed to be armed [usually with some
variation on a beam laser pistol], unless they are wearing "peace
brassards."  Brassarded men are generally assumed to be cowards. 
Duelling is openly accepted.)  Hamilton Felix discovers, quite
inadvertently, that the effects of shooting someone with a .45 cal
pistol (the noise, the blood, etc.) have quite a psychological impact on
would-be challengers, when compared to burning someone down neatly and
quietly with a beam weapon.

Sure you will. Just have more tanks.

Or, as Leonard pointed out, just have the tanker vent the stuff as ice
and build your own snowball asteroid.

This is doable, and canonical. It\'s not as cheap as dipping from a gas
giant, but it shouldn\'t be prohibitively expensive.

Actually it almost garrenties a hit by the tank unless the rampart is firing
from orbit directly down.  The curvature of the earth and ground
iregularities will limit LOS to about 35 miles under good curcumstances if
both tank and rampart are in the atmosphere.  I just came across this

She\'s a librarian so I have lots of choice in things to read while I wait.

That\'s a pretty decent size for the population of an aircraft carrier.
I wonder if they actually had a librarian to run the place? I\'ve always
had a fondness for the Navy, and I *am* a librarian in real life... 
(Then again, it would never work for me: I\'m not a US citizen, I\'m too 
old to enlist, and without my glasses/contacts I\'m blind as a post...)

:)

ObTrav: given the data-storage capabilities of the high TLs in Traveller,
a capital Navy ship should have stored the equivalent of a branch of a 
big-city public library combined with a Blockbuster Video outlet...
even a small scout/courier would have a decent selection of films,
music, and reading material to keep the crew amused during a Jump.

Has it been established in the G:T timeline that Dulinor\'s gig was blown

If the other half of the 3 dton jump drive turns 20 dtons of LHyd into that
much power, then again we should be able to scale that down to some extent.
>>>>>>>>>>>
The reduction in scale may reduce the performance in a non-linear
fashion. Where a 3dTn jump drive\'s capacitors can move gigajoules
of energy, a 1dTn driv\'s capacitor block may only be able to move kilojoules
or less.

There may even be thresholds. A Zuchai crystal lattice of size Y will
transfer X amount of energy with near-100% efficiency, but a crystal
lattice of size Y/2 will transfer X/2 amount of energy with near-0%
efficiency.

Over something flat, like the sea, you probably wouldn\'t even get 35 miles
if both were on the ground - Navy ships are quite a bit taller than grav
tanks.

As the altitude of the Rampart increases, it can see and be seen from
further away. At 30,000ft its probably over 100 miles.
Of course, it would be much easier for the vehicle on the ground to spot
the one in the air (all other things being equal) and I think that there
is general agreement that piloting a Rampart at 30,000ft over a hostile
battlefield isn\'t a long term career move.

But your principle is correct - the Rampart is either dead or in orbit.

remember, though, the cupola is the most exposed portion of the tank to the rampart (its on top) and is the best place for a mission kill (easier to disable the crew than a system). In Real Life infantry anti-tank rockets and the light weapons carried by many smaller vehicles are capable of a mission kill against a tank only at specific places.
(In the Persian Gulf an Iraqi tank (T-72) surprised an American tank (M1A1 Abrams) and nailed it on the front glacis with HEAP at about 120 meters range; it glanced off! The Abrams responded with APDSFSDU; instant kill. The moral? Pick your target.)

No, it\'s more like a BatRon of Tigresses per sector. Your main point is
correct, however, as there are a number of BatRons (just not Tigresses)
per fleet and TWO fleets per sector (though the second fleet, the
colonial one varies a lot in size).

>The bottom line is that the phrase "controlling the \'space _between_
>worlds\'" is just shorthand for a more complex concept.

I agree. Here is my take on the knotty question of Imperial authority versus
planetary autonomy:
 
In theory the structure of the Imperium is very simple: Each star system
constitutes a sovereignty governed in any way its inhabitants see fit. As
members of the Imperium these sovereignties have surrendered certain of
their rights to the Emperor; they agree to let him collect and administer
a certain percentage of their annual production, to obey a number of basic
laws (the Imperial High Laws), to let him tax certain activities, and to
leave foreign relations with non-Imperial states to him. The Emperor turns
over these rights to his vassals in return for fealthy and these vassals in
turn parcel them out to lesser vassals. Each star system thus have two
associated authorities: its own government administering system affairs and
an Imperial noble administering Imperial affairs.
        That\'s the theory. Human nature (and most alien natures too) being
what it is, it is no surprise that in practice exceptions abound. Indeed, it
could be said that the exceptions are the norm.
        MULTI-SYSTEM SOVEREIGNTIES: The Imperium frown on multi-system
sovereignties, but quite a number of these exist. In the early days of the
Imperium many pocket empires joined it as a unit. Whenever possible the
Imperium tries to break these up eventually, but a number still exists even
today. On occasion the Imperium has even been obliged to form some of its
own to meet exceptional political problems; the largest and most famous
examples are the Antarean and Solomani Autonomous regions. A more frequent
source of multi-system sovereignties are the planting of colonies by member
systems. Imperial policy favors the granting of full membership to colony
worlds that have grown big enough to make it on their own (which is why some
colonies are deliberately kept much smaller than optimum by their mother
worlds), but if a former colony prefers union with their mother world there
is not much the Imperium can do about it. Mega-corporations and the largest
sector-wide companies constitutes another kind of multi-system sovereignty.
        IMPERIAL WORLD LEADERS: The principle of having two different kinds
of leaders, system leaders and Imperial nobles, frequently run afoul of the
pride and ambition of powerful world leaders, especially if they are
hereditary rulers. It often becomes a political necessity to appoint them
Imperial nobles. Thus the Matriarch of Mora is both the head of the Moran
government and the Duchess of Mora Subsector. The reverse can also happen.
An unscrupulous Imperial noble assigned to a young, developing world is in a
very good position to acquire title to vast tracks of land. In some cases he
can end up owning, or at least running, the whole world.
	IMPERIALLY OWNED WORLDS: Over the years the Imperium have acquired
outright ownership of a lot of real estate including a number of whole
worlds. When that is the case, the noble assigned to it controls both its
internal and its Imperial affairs.

I\'ve run several Gurps games with charaters with \'addiction\' as a
disadvantage.  One I remember was a generally good ex military character
that turned real nasty without his stuff (combat adder drug).

One of the funniest was a smoking addict.  He played the part very well.  He
kept trap of the time sence his last smoke real closely add acted like he
had gone without.  The player had recently quit smoking himself and was in
effect poking fun at himself.

Also a \'Mary Jane\' smoker who could really play up \'munchies\'!  

Another funny one was a conpulsive partier.  The character was female and
had to sneek out of more that one strange situation the morning
after...though after a week or two in one location she had some good contacts...

 True and misleading. I carried a combat load of about 85 lbs (about 39 kilos) in the Persian Gulf, about 150 with my rucksack (about 69 kilos) - a lot more than my SCA plate armor (about 50 lbs. well distributed) (Granted, I carried a grenade launcher and ammo, so my weights were high....).
 OTOH, powered Battle Dress is going to still be a major improvement for the infantryman. You\'re \'immune\' to most small arms fire and small calibre shrapnel effects, you can ignore NBC attacks, you have constant, secure, silent comms with your comrades, you can breathe underwater for short periods, see in the dark, etc. Best of all, you can carry more/heavier weapons and ammo *without getting tired* from the weight. That is huge. Add in grav belts for high-speed mobility and you have a fast, lethal force that can hide rpetty well.

 I\'ve written up an \'H-Hour\' timeline for planetary assault by drop troops. An early stage of \'drop prep\' is to insert powered BD special forces troops by personal reentry kit; these troops then proceed, under cover, to key strategic sites. As the drop ships move into orbit, you have 2-man teams attack ky places and sow panic - imagine 2 men flying into the government center, gauss guns sweeping through the crowds as the head for the main chambers, where they start firing RAM grenades and placing explosives. At the same time, key communications, transport, and power centers are being hit the same way. Then you find out you have a full regiment of guys like that arriving, with more support following....
 Enough to make you join the Imperium.

In G:Space it\'s a semi-randomly generated thing.
One could use the "Base Mean Surface Temperature" tables from TNE: World
tamers handbook to get the 30 degrees avg temperature that is equivalent to
G:Space avg temp and climate type. This may require the generaion of some
extra parameters (like Orbital distane or eccentricity) if they are not
already known.

Yeah.  Exactly.  MT already has (broken IMO) provisions for it, but it\'s part 
of CTs level of abstraction that makes me play TNE.  :-)

Not if he zaps him from orbit.  And the rampart is a helluva lot faster than 
a grav tank (even a Trepida).  And the grav tank is probably armed w/ a high 
energy weapon.  It\'s the ol classic game of shoot while in your optimum 
range, but outside the enemy\'s.

Exactly.  That\'s why I think the Rampart will be using it\'s laser.  I\'m not 
sure bout Striker, but in Striker II the Rampart is presented as having a 
ground support role.  Such a platform isn\'t desired as a dedicated 
anti-infantry device.  It\'s ill suited for it, though should be relatively 
immune to anything that infantry might wield (save possibly tac missiles).

It\'s Aella.  I\'m not sure on the direct family relationship (at least in 
anything outside of something by DGP or possibly in the SMC, etc), but RSB 
says Arbellatra apointed the first Aledon as Duke of Regina the day after her 
coronation.

They also don\'t have to be fed, though I think FFS2 is kinda ridiculous in 
its food rules (gimme fauxflesh vats!).

IMO, it\'d be much better to have the good bulk of your trained assault forces 
in low berth up to a couple days before the final precipitation.  Give some 
time to stretch their legs and prepare their equipment, though. ;-)

some questions:

A 20% flicker rate: is it 20% on or 20% off?  

How fast does it flicker: several times a second, a minute, an hour?
technically, if it\'s on for 20 hours and then off for 80, that\'s still a
20% flicker..

How fast can it be turned on/off.  i.e., can you turn it on just as a
missile is about to impact and them immediately turn it off again?

I\'m mostly looking for canon sources, please cite where your info is from
(although conjecture is welcome too)

Thanks alot,

Well, 1st off, this book has only adventures, it\'s not really a sourcebook.
 I\'ve got this book, and rather like some of the adventures in it.  OTOH,
some are terrible...  It\'s probably worth getting if you want ready made
aventures, but that\'s about it.  Also, most of the adventures rely on being
M0, and are not readily adaptable (IMHO)
