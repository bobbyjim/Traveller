Actually, there\'s another problem (potential). You need to sanity check
the figures for the sail mass.

I just checked and plastics seem to be around 1.0 density. But you need
to aluminize the plastic. So let\'s go for a density of 2.0 and a
thickness of one atom or so (Al ions seems to have a radius of .39 to
.54 angstroms, so we\'ll go for 1 angstrom).

1 angstrom = 1e-10 m.

So, 1 square mile = 2.59e6 m^2. Which means that 1 sqare mile of 1
Angrstrom thick sail has a volume of 2.59e-4 m^3. with a specific
gravity of 2, that gives a mass of about 518 grams per square mile (Yow!).
Or 18.3 pounds, or 9.134e-3 tons/mi^2. 

Note that I seriously doubt this would work as a sail, even if
assembled using nanotech. And that I\'m ignoring the shroud lines and
any required "tensile fibers" (required to keep the sail from ripping
apart from the tensile stresses).

>>A 1-space (50T) sail is 250 square miles with GVE2.  Thrust is 0.66T.
>>Maximum area is 360,000 square miles (1440 modules).

And mass has to be above (way above!) 2.28 tons per space (250 mi^2).

>>A 1-space (490T) TL-8 sail is 15 square miles with a thrust of 0.038T (it
>>has marginally lower thrust); maximum area is 3,600 square miles (240

And it must mass above .137 tons per space (15 mi^2).

I did that in another message. Assuming essentially a couple of atoms
of aluminum as the thickness (since you *have* to coat the sail or it
won\'t reflect) and a density of 2.0 (figure the carbon and hydrogen of
the plastic account for part of the thickness). I got a figure of
9.14e-3 tons/mi^2 as our "minimum".

Not if it is designed properly. Missile warheads reenter *fast* and
survive. 

I\'d point out to the powers that be that the "slow down for re-entry"
only applies to anything that wants to *land*. Kinetic kill weapons,
and even "normal nukes"  *won\'t* bother slowing down, it makes it too
easy to nail them before they impact their targets.

There\'s a simple "rule of thumb" used in estimating damage from meteor
strikes and the like. 

At 3 km/sec, an impacting object releases energy equal to its mass in
TNT (ie a 100 kilo projectile impacting at 3 km/sec will make the same
sized hole as a 100 kilos of TNT). 

The energy goes up as the *square* of the velocity. Thus, a 12 km/sec
projectile will have *16* times the blast effects. So a 100 kilo
projectile is equivalent to 1.6 tonnes of TNT. 

I picked 12 km/sec for a reason. First, it\'s just a bit above escape
velocity (11 km/sec) and it is exactly 4 times the 3 km/sec figure
above, making calculations easy.

Why is being close to escape velocity important? Because not only is
escape velocity the speed to need to "escape to infinity (ie never
fall back), it\'s also the speed an object free-falling from infinity
would have at impact (if there was no atmosphere). 

The Earth\'s orbital velocity around 20-30 km/sec. At 30 km/sec our 100
kg projectile will release 100 times the energy it would at 3 km/sec.
Or about the energy of 10 *tons* of TNT.

Now consider that a 100 kg projectile like this, could simply be a
chunk of properly shaped stell with a ceramic or graphite coating to
ensure it survives to hit the ground. And it\'ll have a volume of 1/80th
of a cubic meter. Or a bit over 1/80th of a cubic yard. 

So let\'s consider one that\'s an entire cubic meter in volume. It\'ll
mass 7.8 tonnes. And again the impact energy will be *100* times that.
So we are talking about the equivalent of 780 tonnes of TNT. That\'s
over 3/4s of a kiloton!

I hadn\'t thought of the link between streetwise and bribery, but I would
still keep them seperate, allowing streetwise to default at a small penalty
to bribery. I agree it is not a complex skill, but I usually use some
gradiation in skill types, and would place bribery at the lowest, cheapest
rank. Consider also that it can be used not just to actually bribe someone,
but for determining if a bribe attempt is likely to be risky or readily
accepted, what type of incentive would be best (cash, contraband, favor,
etc.), to communicate to another that you are bribable, spot a bribe taking
place, etc.

As far as medical, I have long ago given up generalizing such a complex
field into a single skill. Anatomy, diagnostics, surgery, pharmaceuticals,
it\'s  a huge ball of interlocking disciplines. Perhaps R. O\'Conner can give
some pointers to help flesh out that area of game mechanics. Monitoring the
physical condition of characters during combat, hostile environments,
disease, etc. has always been a weak link in many systems. Most, IMHO.

Nope, litres per 100 kilometers so small number are better.

I don\'t know if it changed when the government sold off the railways
but the fact that the British Railways Transport Police had jurisdiction
over railway property meant that members of other police forces couldn\'t
arrest people on BR property.

Oh, and the London Underground has its own separate force as well.

As I said Scotland Yard (or New Scotland Yard) is the HQ  of  the
Met (London police) ... but they have dozens of individual police
stations across the capitol all reporting back to Scotland Yard.

There is no UK FBI equivalent although MI5 is  hoping  to  become
one (time will tell).

IIRC "Cracker" was set in London (as was Sherlock  Holmes\'  home,
and "The Bill") and given the  size  of  London  I  can  see  how
references to Scotland Yard (without references to  other  police
HQs) may be confusing.

I haven\'t noticed  any  change  (but  I\'m  not  always  the  most
observant).  I do know that the BR Revenue Protection  Squad  are
not police but *do* have arrest and \'statement taking\' powers.

Do any UK TMLers know if the Thames River Police is part  of  the

The "Death Cloud" was a Shadow weapon and IIRC  it  was  *not*  a

No need for us to arise at dawn (your dawn or mine?
hehe), when I said, "just a game," I didn\'t mean to
diminish its obvious importance in our other wise
bleak and aimless lives, merely that perhaps an
in-depth psychosocio-economic-political analysis (a
dialectic of the extremely unproleteriat, as it were),
is maybe a bit bloody much. There are philosophy
degrees, and there is roleplaying. For me, at least, I
find "fun" does not involve confusing the two.

Yep, and both sides were unhappy with her decision, if

Of course. But the same goes for other disciplines. As
testament to this I offer the recent postings re:
music skills. Everybody who knows anything about skill
"x" will inform you that it should be x:y and x:z and
x:a and x:b and so on... I\'m a chef, and I\'m sure I
could cogently argue that cooking different cuisines
counts as several different skills... which is pretty
funny considering that many systems don\'t even list it
as a skill! (what an insult!)

I just think you have to draw the line somewhere, else
you will have literally thousands of skills pretty
soon ("such as?" you cry, well, System Bash, anyone?
hehe) I prefer simplicity, myself. I\'ve found that
breaking down a skill too much doesn\'t materially
enhance the game. (Which isn\'t to insult those who\'ve
so well discussed bribery and music and so on, simply
to say that each gm finds their level)

I\'m sure that if we did enough research we could find several
examples of people changing in the opposite direction. As for 
me, I myself have read the Bible, "to see what all the shouting
was about". Guess what, I\'m still an athiest.

This\'ll be my last comment on the subject, as it is very far afield from
Traveller. I simply want to say here that not believing that the Bible is an
accurate historical document *does not* mean that one has a bias *against*
the text. Strauss, for example, was strongly biased toward the book, but had
little belief that it was accurate as a historical document. Bultmann was
similar. The allegorists of the 18th and 19th centuries believed in the
Bible as a history, but believed that those historical events were placed as
they were by God for the purpose of instructing man. Further, a belief in
the historicity of the Bible is not binary. There are many different shades
of such a belief, from those who believe that the Bible is a true and
accurate history from start to finish, to those who think that any
historical accuracy contained is sketchy, and not terribly important
compared to the "essential truths" that may or may not be found within.

One thing that\'s important to keep in mind that the very notion of a history
in antiquity was quite different from what would be called a history today.
Moral lessons and rules for living were frequently encoded within a
framework of a history.

PS: Personally, I think you\'re right on your interpretation of Theophilos.

Hm, I doubt it, as I don\'t see very many K\'kree lifting off-planet
in standard Saturn-type rocket boosters. Without discovering gravitics,
the K\'kree are pretty much planet bound. 

Every race is generally given some sort of explanation for why 
they\'d make the gigantic energy expenditure, as a race, to do
all that aerospace research and get off the planet. Hivers are
curious. The Vargr are desperate to prove how cool each of them 
are individually. The Vilani are empire builders. The Zhos grew
up with the knowledge of the Droyne and a second Droyne base
in orbit right around them. The Aslan, well, heck, if you\'ve
got free space travel, there\'s a lot of land out there to settle
(The Aslan desire to settle land is, in a wierd way, nearly sexual 
thus making them almost downright horny for extraterrestrial
exploration). The Solomani/Terrans have to to make sure we don\'t
get smucked by the Vilani (it\'s purely plot).

And the K\'kree? They want to fucking kill. Kill kill kill.

Scary proposition.

    'from' => 'Jason.Kemp@tdh.state.tx.us',
    'body' => 'Good morning, All,

Yesterday, I encountered an unusual thought exercise that immediately 
made me think of the various levels of expertise in the hard sciences 
here on the TML.  That being so, I figured I\'d share some of the 
preliminary thoughts.

What would happen if you could suddenly stop the world from spinning 
on its axis?  Assume that all physical laws remain intact, beyond the 
one exception that someone or something could stop the Earth, or a 
planet of your choice, from spinning.

First, the obvious answer that most people come up with is "Everybody 
falls down."  Yes, and so do buildings, vegetation, certain terrain 
types, etc.  Suddenly the world stops, but inertia keeps you going at 
an incredible rate.  (My best friend quoted something around 900 
miles per second, but I don\'t have the figures to back it up.  
That\'s one hell of a skinned knee.)

Contrary to some belief, people would not go flying off into space.
The rotational speed of the Earth, and I assume for most other
planets, generally does not exceed escape velocity for its gravity,
so when inertia kicks in, people go flying for a bit, then hit the
ground really hard and really fast.  (This point lead to a very
interesting discussion with a young lady who was sure that the
reason we have gravity was because the world was spinning. It took a
while to talk her out of that one, and I\'m not sure we were actually
successful.)

Inertia would also cause the oceans to swell heavily to the east
(for Earth,) and wash up onto the coasts on the east side of the
oceans in large waves.  Then, the water would slosh back, slamming
the western coasts with waves not quite as devastatingly high.  
Eventually, the oceans would settle back into their beds, but not 
before many of the larger aquatic life had died from the turbulence.

Creatures and/or technological devices in flight would be tossed, 
tumbling, through the air in the direction of the previous rotation 
of the planet as the atmosphere suddenly scoured the planet\'s 
surface, continuing to move that direction due to inertia as well.  
Assuming that aerodynamic flight could not be reestablished once the 
device starts flipping nose over tail, wing over wing, in a chaotic 
tumble, most of these devices would probably crash.  I\'m not sure how 
well gravitic devices could recover from the disorientation of being 
slammed by an atmosphere that was suddenly moving at the planet\'s 
former rotation speed while the planet has stopped.

Also, if one looks at the conservation of momentum, then as soon as 
the world stops spinning, the momentum must be transferred somewhere. 
 One of the effects of this would be the pushing of the planet 
outside it\'s former plane of orbit about its primary/star.  For 
Earth, that means that the world would start moving in a northerly 
direction, out of the plane it used to orbit in.  Someone on the 
south pole at the time the world\'s rotation was stopped would be 
launched into the air, as the world started moving north out of the 
plane of revolution at a high rate of speed, relatively.  Someone of 
the north pole would be slammed to the ground at a relatively high 
rate of speed, for much the same reason.  (This is according to my 
friend.  I personally have doubts on this point, at least as far 
as the person standing on either pole being so dramatically 
affected by the shift in direction of planet movement.)

Should anything survive the initial chaos, the world is now tidally 
locked, with all the incumbent changes in weather patterns as the 
differences in temperature that arise from being tidally locked 
around a primary star.  (You know, the sunny side gets hot, the shady 
side gets cold, and life sucks anywhere except at some band parallel 
to the "twilight band," depending on the ambient temperatures at a 
particular range from the "twilight band.")

ObTrav:  Perhaps a weapon that could do this was used in the Final
War of the Ancients 300,000 years ago. It would seem to me that this
would quickly destroy almost all complex life within the biosphere
of the planet in question.  Could this explain why there are so many
tidally locked worlds, relatively speaking, in the OTU? 

My apologies if you do not find this an interesting diversion or
thought exercise, at least momentarily.  I now return you to your 
regularly scheduled thread of choice, already in progress.

Just imagine, all this for just 0.02Cr,

GAH! Damn. I\'ll have to check my G:T book tonight to see what it says.

However, the "fact" that the Terrans copied Jump wasn\'t exactly stated
outright anywhere else either. I just find it interesting that once
they made it to the Asteroid belt, the Terrans just happened to discover
jump. Note that at last one moon of Jupiter and/or Saturn as well as
Pluto as interdicted Navy bases and have been so under all governments
that have occupied Terra. Note that the Terran discovery of Jump 3
was also crucial in their defeat of the Vilani... maybe the Terrans
found somethinf the VIlani had missed.

Yeah, but for some people, that *is* fun. For others, reading such things
also has entertainment value. Hell, even if I think that Tim may have gotten
his interpretation wrong, he\'s right. Traveller is an artifact of a specific
time in history, and reflects certain influences. The various people who
have contributed to the Third Imperium background over the years have been
drawing from a similar traditions.

One effect you\'ve missed. . .You\'d have to dissipate or oppose all of
the planet\'s rotational energy, and unless you\'ve somehow repealed
the laws of thermodynamics a fair amount of that energy is going to
end up as heat.  IIRC that would be enough to melt a large portion of
the planet\'s rock.  The oceans wouldn\'t just slosh, they\'d flash-boil.

Not quite.  Tidally locked worlds still rotate, they just do it in step
with their orbital motion.  Of course if you want to specify that the
world has been reduced to a tide-locked state from a state of
rotating every 24 hours or so, the effects would be almost the
same.

I\'ve just finished applying a rough _First In_ procedure to all 400 worlds
of the Solomani Rim.  An awful lot of those worlds are tide-locked, all
right, but that\'s because they\'re down in canon as maintaining Earthlike
conditions despite being in orbit around dim red dwarfs.  You don\'t
need Ancient weapons to tide-lock a world under those conditions.
Sitting too close to a star will do it in much less than a billion years.

Step One: Determine that a person is bribeable. Not everyone is, and
no one is under each and every situation. Quite a bit of background 
knowledge, experience, and subtle feeling out of the situation is
required. Streetwise might help, if the target is lower class or a
regular target of the lower classes...but what if the target is an Imperial
Governor?

Step Two: Determine what to bribe the individual with. Money?
How much money? Too much, and the person will get suspicious.
He\'ll think you\'ve actually done something much more serious than
you\'re trying to bribe your way out of, and he might think it too 
dangerous to let you get away with it. Too little, and he might be
insulted...perhaps even insulted enough to arrest you for attempted
bribery. And what if money isn\'t the right thing to bribe with?
Which would work better to bribe an Imperial Naval officer with,
a lump of cash or a promotion? John Christian Falkenberg once
"bribed" an opposing merc commander into giving him a ceasefire,
and instead of money offered him an opportunity to safely collect
up his wounded..."If I\'d bribed him with money, he\'d have tried to shoot
me...but offer him the lives of his men..." (Yes, I know this wouldn\'t
usually be handled with bribery skill, but I was using it as an example
of extremes.)

Step Three, of course, is to actually "Make the donation to the 
Police Officer\'s Widows and Orphans Fund".

That\'s not what Streetwise is, though. From the Traveller book:

"Streetwise: The individual is acquainted with the ways of local subcultures
(which tend to be the same everywhere in human society), and thus is capable
of dealing with strangers without alienating them. This skill is not the
same as alien contact experience.
    "Close-knit subcultures (such as some portions of the lower classes,
trade groups, and the underworld) generally reject contact with strangers or
unknown elements. Streetwise expertise allows contact for the purchasing or
selling contraband or stolen goods, and other shady or borderline
activities."

There\'s a referee example as well, but in the sake of brevity I\'m leaving it
out. I do have certain problems with the description of the skill as
presented, it doesn\'t look like it deals solely with the *criminal*
underground, but subcultures in general.

I take it that there\'s some effect to this world-stopper that stops the

atmosphere or anything upon it. Considering how heterogenous much

It would be bad to go from normally rotating to tidally locked all at once,
even without mile-high ocean waves and such.

SPI\'s _Freedom In The Galaxy_ had an orbital superweapon the
bad-guy Empire could use, called the Planetary Stabilizer. It could
instantly stop just the core (and maybe the mantle) of a planet from
rotating, throwing the crust of the planet into space as the thin crust
absorbed all that rotational velocity at once. Everything on the planet
dies, and everything in orbit (including the Planetary Stabilizer) gets
destroyed as well. As a bonus, the Imperial terraforming engineers
have a clean slate to work from, and it\'s probably in a habitable zone
of the star system to boot...once the orbit clears up a bit.

Agreed, but the most common *uses* of the skill I\'ve seen or heard
of deals with those who are, in some way, criminal. Whether they are
criminal because they are the bad guys, or because they\'ve been
criminalized by the rest of society is another matter. Your quote 
highlights the utility of the skill in knowing how to obtain contraband
goods or make shady deals as well.

Streetwise might be useful in making a deal with the stevedore gangs
in a low-class starport, while Admin skill would be used to deal with
a high-class starport executive. Bribery skill could be useful in either
case, as long as you have something to bribe with and your target
can be bribed.

(OT: I recall in TSR\'s "Gangbusters" prohibition-era rpg, there was a
chance (1 in 100? 1 in 36?) that any NPC would be totally honest,
and would not lie, accept a bribe or give in to criminal intimidation under
any circumstances. This could be a very serious problem for gangster
PC\'s, since getting such a person out of the way might require murder 
- - and a standard of the fiction being played was that while racketeers and 
smugglers might evade the forces of justice, these same forces would 
pursue a murderer with tireless dedication.)

Good point.  I had wondered about how much heat might be produced in
such an instant, but was caught up in the imagined special effects of
the empire state building shearing off and flying eastward at some
incredible speed, followed by huge super-tsunami waves destroying
both seaboards, that kind of thing.  You know, the basic cinematic
end of the world level of destruction.

Point conceded.  In the event of a true cessation of rotation, does 
that mean, then the the day now equals the sidereal year?  Still has 
nasty effects on the ecology and weather patterns, but after the 
melting of most of the planet\'s surface, what does it matter, right?

I\'d love to see this, but I can assume it\'s for the GT: Solomani Rim 
book you\'re working on, so I guess I\'ll just have to wait until it 
comes out.  :)

Looking forward to it with anticipation.

	This would be an example of approaches based on differences

	I\'m right with you here.  I try to work in minor differences
	in tech, novel approaches to using the same tech, etc.  It\'s
	just that if your neighbour has starships that are demonstrably
	superior in every way, I expect that eventually you will adopt
	that technology.  Just how much of a time lag there is may be
	subject to debate.

	I agree.  This should be the most fertile ground for 
	generating differences in starship designs.  Of course, even
	Imperial designs should vary considerably (Presumably 4 dtons
	is some sort of minimum for staterooms, but larger ones could
	be installed. If one wished to complicate the rules further,
	one could introduce drives that are cheeper but have lower
	performance, or some saving in tonnage for skipping grav=plates
	in the hallways).

	I am in complete agreement.

	Consumer goods are driven by a number of things, not least
	of which is standardization.  There is no doubt that this
	consideration would influence the use of technologies, but
	there are limits.  Can you imagine an airline insisting on
	using propeller-driven aircraft for transatlantic flights?
	At best, a very small market might be found for \'nostalgia\'
	flights, but jets are the way to go for long-distance
	travel.  The fact that prop planes are still practical for
	short hauls does not mitigate this.

Well, traditionally the background of Traveller is one in which the most
common subcultures will generally be things like organized crime
organizations and revolutionary groups, so it makes sense that these would
be the most common uses, especially to a game that has a strong focus on
merchant and mercenary style campaigns.

My rough calculations indicate a more "sedate" rate. On the equator,
the circumference of the Earth is 24854.848 miles, give or take. The 
Earth rotates once in about 23.933333333 hours. So I figure the 
speed at close to 1038.503398 miles an hour. 

Unless I am totally offbase. <g>

And as you move away from the equator, the speed will drop. At the 
poles, the effect would be almost negligible.

I am not so certain that craft in the air would be affected so badly.
The air around the craft would still be going the same rough speed 
in relation to the craft. The ground stopped, not the air or the craft.

The ground would whiz by though and flying objects would be a hazard.
That and mountains. <g> The effects would be more pronounced near 
the ground.

North? If it moves out of its orbit at all, which I will have to 
think about, I would expect that would change perpendicular to the 
actual plane of that orbit, ie the equator. Thus, no matter what 
direction, in or out, it would depend on where things were in the 
day/night rotation. I do not have any facts on if the rotation of 
the earth adds or subtracts from it\'s orbital period but I would 
feel safe in saying that it does not add/subtract enough to change 
the orbit very much at all. Everybody? Am I off base on this?

Shrug...400 lb/square mile, or .07 grams/square meter, or 7e-6 grams/square centimeter.  Assuming water density, 7 angstroms thick.

Considering such other GTL-9 abominations as monowire and construction foam (construction foam is fast-hardening foam that\'s firm enough to walk on.  It has a density, if inflated, of about .0005) it fits well enough with the GURPS technology.  Of course, both of these technologies might be unavailable in GT.

vary from each other: customs and regulations. Here are some examples
of ways I\'ve used to make ships different, from different regions,
species or organizations:

All vessels above 200dtns (or some other arbitrary limit) must have
sufficient lifeboats to carry all passengers and crew, or cannot be
licensed to carry passengers in Imperial(or other) space.

All jump-capable ships, even small ones, must be unstreamlined
to prevent their landing on planets[1], or because the particular variant
of jump drive technology used behaves badly when exposed to 
planetary landings[2]. (I have a 200dtn, jump-1 trading ship design that
carries a 95dtn shuttlecraft for when I was experimenting with this idea.)

Misjumps are to be feared. Only the most desperate crewman will serve
on a ship unless it has sufficient low berths/emergency low berths
available at all times to allow everyone to go into hibernation in the rare
case of a misjump to interstellar space or a fuelless system.

Passengers with criminal intent are a very serious threat to the safety
of a starship. Passenger areas are on seperate decks, and are widely
seperated from areas containing any important ship functions. There are
no vital areas a crewman needs to access during flight that require a 
crewman to enter the passenger areas, unless the crewman is specifically 
seeing to passenger needs. The passenger area probably also has 
it\'s own exterior access (airlock or small craft dock), so the passengers
can board and disembark from the ship without ever entering most of it.

No one boards a starship unless they are in the same service or company
as that operating the starship, or are there as allies of the starship
operators (such as contract employees or hired specialists). There is
virtually no distinction between passenger areas and crew areas, and
"passengers" are usually given appropriate shipboard duties during
the voyage.

While most starports have sufficient support craft, no serious merchant
vessel will place it\'s cargo handling ability entirely in the hands of each
planet\'s shuttle service. Nearly all merchant vessels will have their own
small craft, with at least some ability to transfer passengers and cargo
from orbit to planet. Your High Passengers want to disembark *now*, not 
when the local shuttle pilot strike is over. Also, if enough merchant
vessels have some small craft capability, it will help control the power of 
each planet\'s shuttle pilot groups to increase rates.

Some manufacturing, engineering or facilities limitation places a
maximum practical size on ships that can be landed - perhaps 1000dtns
or so. Even when the limitation is overcome, it may be some time
before shipbuilding customs or common landing facilities make larger,
landable ships a useful design philosophy.

Just some ideas...variations in design philosophy, rather than 
strictly the technology involved.

This made me think of another RPG that came out about ten years ago, TORG.
In the books that came out at the same time (I don\'t have the books any more
and the names escape me but it was a three book trilogy) one of the bad guys
was slowly (over about a months time) slowing down the earth\'s spin. The
effect was a slow but steady increase/decrease of temps, daylight/night
fall, and extreme weather. End result was a small ribbon in the twilight
zone that was not harm full to life. If anyone can remember the detials (the
books names, ect..), please jump in.

Throwing some of my own ideas into the mix:

A serious human tragedy due to poor safety features causes the local
interstellar polity to crack down on safety requirements for passenger
carrying ships. This could be a real problem for ship owning characters who
might have to foot the bill to add things like lifeboats, or to take out
things, like flammable panels in the passenger and crew compartments, or
install an extensive, and expensive, safety system of another sort.

A secondary form of interstellar travel can be added which is cheaper or
more fuel efficient than standard Jump Drives, but which is slower than even
Jump-1. Such a drive would not seriously impact the game world, but could be
used for local flavor as certain races might use such a design for bulk, low
priority shipping.

Jump Drives, in and of themselves, can be modified slightly. Add a few hours
to transit time to simulate cheap drives, knock a few off to simulate more
expensive, optimized drives. Similarly, fuel consumption can be varied, or
alternate methods of power generation for Jump Drives can be employed, like
the Annic Nova. A more detailed system for misjump calculation can be
employed, and the drives of different races, or companies, or polities might
have slightly different chances to misjump.

There might be some degree of difficulty in applying parts for a more
expensive or exotic version of Jump Drive. Canonically, it is said that the
Droyne make excellent hand crafter Jump Drives, while the first try of the
Hivers was inferior to "standard" drives. The same core technology may be
there with regard to jump drives, but the actual application could well be
different.

Apply drawbacks to technologies like reactionless thrusters and
contra-gravity. This might explain why certain races or cultures might
prefer another form of technology. There were some good ideas along these
lines in the original Fire, Fusion & Steel. One of the ones that I liked
quite a bit was "mass displacement" as a drawback / advantage for
contra-gravity.

Sadly no. These guys wear standard British Bobby uniforms with the 
usual body armour and can be seen carrying H&Ks. And they check the 
cars leaving Atomic Energy sites for stolen stationary etc.

Kind of scary.

So write in MT and port it to other versions by switching the tasks

Naaaah! Budget cuts have reduced the Indian raids to once a week, and
since the cows unionized, they sued us for poor working conditions, so
we had to pave the streets.

 The Traveller Community\'s problems with TNE seem to be either that the 
system is so different from previous that they can\'t/won\'t adjust, or that it 
introduces an element (Virus) that they cannot accept as "science" and 
cannot, therefore, support, use, or even like. I have no problem with either 
element, and actually prefer TNE marginally over the other choices 
("Marginal" due largely to the accessibility of the TNE rulebook; that thing 
is hard going due to layout and typeface issues)

 TNEs "Ships Book" was indeed Brilliant Lances, though several books (Guilded 
Lilly, World Tamer\'s, Regency Guide) have multiple ships described...

Real cops don\'t tend to get into those jurisdictional turf wars
either...and according to TeeVee all of California is balmy, Korea,
Africa, and most locations around the world look just like the hills
outside of LA, there\'s a singular rock formation on dozens of planets
and sites around the world (The rocks where Kirk fought the reptile
thing pop up in the damndest places), and if we are to go by Stargate
SG-1, unless the planet is reall, really weird, all planets are
Vancouver ;-)

Nope, none of the causes you mentioned would come to effect, because one 
thing would come first and nullify all others:

Boooooom!
If all the energy that is contained in the motion of the Earth were to be 
to be suddenly released,
it would cause a gigantic release of energy (heat), colloquially known as 
Boom! Scratch one planet.

Forget Near-C Rocks...


On the other hand, if you had a way of stopping the 
earth  non-mechanically, by removing it´s movement energy, the earth would 
just stop. It´would be tidally locked and lose it´s sherical shape and turn 
into an egg-shape with the thin end facing the sun.

  They got to their moon using their own tech first, then fought high-

No, you\'re *completely* wrong.  There are in fact *three* reasons a

Wouldn\'t that be Book *9*?  Book *8* was "Robots", IIRC.  And anyway, the

Hopefully without igniting any embers..

1) Virus.  This was just too much.  It took many players\' tolerance of
handwaving and shattered it.  It just did too many things, too well, to be
believed.

2) The Setting.  Many people loathed the Reformation Coalition setting,
especially the whole "Star Vikings" bit.  As written, Traveller had become
a sort of high-tech dungeon crawl for lostech goodies to sell at auction
crossed with CIA-esque overthrows of unpopular governments.  The time scale
was just to short.. 80 years?  For that level of destruction and fall back?
 Give me 150 to kill of a few generations of technicians, and maybe.

3) The Rules.  The GDW House Rules need to be buried deep, deep in the same
crypt as Dangerous Journeys.  I feel no shame in calling THR the worst
rules ever produced by GDW.  Combat (my area of interest) was an ungodly
mess.. try killing a PC with a hand gun.

There were some things I liked.. Fire, Fusion & Steel was a leap forward in
concept from the usual big book o\'equipment, and I really like BL/BR, but
the total package just failed.

Nope. the whole paragraphs fails due to the fact that anything flying
maintains its speed relative to the medium it is in: The air.No crashes,
unless in final approach at the time, or slammed into a mountain. Same with
gravitics. Safest place to be would be in the air.

[snip example of redirection]
Not neccessarily transfered into other momentum. If you stop the rotation
by applying energy to stop the rotation, you get heat, and/or light, and/or
other radiations, and/or velocity/vector changes.

Some of the reasons which have been expressed:
1) Many don\'t buy into virus... it is too far fetched.
2) Combat vs PC\'s: the rules as written speciy d6\'s for damage; you can\'t
kill the average PC with a .22LR that way. I\'ve tried upping toD10\'s; even
then, I had a Vargr PC survive 5 shots from an FGMP14 at point blank (1m),
and did remeber the fragmentation rules, too.
3) How NPC\'s are handled.
4) The effectivly total elimination of all the setting which had come before.
5) all them different kinds of dice (d6 and d20 required, d16 handy for
aging saves, d10 useful for damage and some of the tables).
6) FF&S has too much detail.

Me, count 1, 2, 3,4, and sort of 6.

  While we\'re on the subject (or at least close), would anyone care
to explain why SF games almost always assume that anti-matter is a
power supply system that doesn\'t need an ultimate source of fuel?

  I mean that presumably there\'s a honking big fusion reactor (or
other cheap power source) running as cost-efficient as possible a
conversion method, but AM itself as a resource is absurd, unless
you postulate that suddenly at TL x it becomes easy to obtain (?!).
</Steve>

As you point out, the problem is not using antimatter.  We could probably
assemble an AM-using plant today.  The problem is obtaining the fuel.  I
think the notion is that at some point you gain the capacity to magically
"flip" the charge of matter and thus obtain AM cheaply.  This violates
conservation of energy I think, but then that\'s why AM power is generally
in the "glittertech" domain.

The thing is that anything that can produce AM the "old-fashioned way"  is
going to be producing gobs of energy already, so you might as well use
that as your power-plant technology (unless there are limitations to use
aboard ships, such as size, radiation or whatever). 

One possibility is a dyson sphere[1] of close-orbitting solar power
satellites converting significant portions of a sun\'s output into AM.  In
this case, you\'ve got massive infrastructure producing AM, which is then
used in ships and other installations because of it\'s small size and high
efficiency.  This is akin to the situation with gasoline today.

[1] Note that I mean a Dyson sphere as originally conceived:  A bunch of
seperate structures, not a single solid structure.

The change from thrusters to HEPLaR and the importation of the T2K2
rules as well as the drastic change in background resulted in a vastly
different gaming environment. These changes also made it more
difficult to use materials from other versions of the game. In Contrast
CT,MT, and T4 ships and charecters can be ported to each other with
a minimum ammount of effort. Also when they did the meals section of
TNE they called the rations MRE\'s instead of the more generic term.
For some reason that really annoyed me.

In isolation I like TNE. I just like CT/MT more.

planet, including the people on the surface, the air and the water and so
on.  This would have little immediate effect.  Or you could stop just the
core, so that the exterior would continue a decelerate more slowly.  Or it
could be something that stops all the matter within a certain radius of
the rotational axis.  All of these would have nasty effects, but to
greater or lesser degrees and in different ways.

Actually, if you look at the rules section in Regency Sourcebook, no.
RSB\'s Author used coils.

But there is a non-dgp reference to hull grids; I just can\'t remeber where.

eventually will be guided to the source. He/she knows how to ask questions,
seems to fit into the environment and doesn\'t trigger alarms when asking

start out with bribing as the intended way of getting results. As anyone who

IYTU, how common is it to integrate the various emergency services?
(Police, Fire, Emergency Medical, Public Health)
</William>

In the smaller systems, they tend to be merged as one service with seperate operational branches and an overall bureacracy (payroll, admin services, IT, etc).  In those systems with a greater population, they usually get split up into operational areas around a common theme.  The greater the population, the more specialised the service.  At less than 100,000 sophonts (eg : Carmel), there\'s probably no seperate rescue organisation, but on, say, Pretoria, the civil authorities have a specialist undersea recsue service.

Coming from a place that\'s always had a seperate ambulance service, I\'ve been intrigued to observe places with a larger population that subsume the role as part of the fire services.

On p.67 in the sidebar: "Traveller canon has always avoided the 
question, but the present author has one fervently held opinion: Terran 
discovery of jump-drive was through their own efforts - it was not 
given, taken or acquired in any way other than through independent 
research." So, I guess it comes down to how canonical Loren\'s published 
opinion is.

Note that (according to GT, anyway) the Vilani discovered jump once 
they\'d reached the outer reaches of their solar system, too. IMO it\'s 
simply that you need to get outside the 100 diameter radius of your 
star before things will work properly. Inside and all you\'ve got is a 
exotic way of making lots of research dollars disappear.

AFAIK they were not canon in TNE. In fact IIRC Dave Nilsen (sp?) 
specifically went for a "jump bubble" generator, at least in part 
because it allows for externally carried craft.

I played a few games of Battle Rider, and enjoyed them immensely. It\'s 
fairly important to make sure that you use the corrected difficulty 
ratings, though (otherwise you get results that are way off compared 
with BL). With small to medium ships it reminded me of Star Cruiser, 
but with more conclusive results - in Star cruiser getting detected 
meant a missile salvo that may or may not actually do anything in 2 
turns, in BR it means someone puts a spinal PAW beam right through you.

This reminds me... once I noticed that, in the UWP listing for the 
Spinward Marches, in the MT Player\'s Manual, there was an extra world 
which was not in the map... anybody ever noticed? I don\'t have my 
books here to check now.

    'body' => '* Overview
The Imperium exists because of, and to maintain, interstellar trade.
Certain overarching standards are in place to ensure that trade between
the 11,000 member worlds can continue smoothly. These are enforced by
the Ministries of Commerce and Justice, through the Starports Authority
and the Imperial Navy, as well as ministerial personnel.
	Provision of health services is an essential adjunct to development and
therefore the fostering of trade.
	As the only Imperium-wide organisation with the necessary
infrastructure, the Medical Branch of the Imperial Navy has been charged
with other roles, beyond that of supporting its personnel and their
dependents. It :-
	- drafts disaster plans in consulation with local governments, leading
to the databasing of medical resources available in the area ;
	- compiles the section of the Imperial Data Package dealing with
pharmaceuticals (IDP-P) and medical instruments/therapeutic procedures
(IDP-MI/TP) ;
	- in consulation with local medical authorities, pharmaceutical
companies, the Technical Services Office of the IISS and the Navy\'s
Technical Branch, controls the addition to, or deletion of items from,
the IDP-P and IDP-MI/TP ; and
	- advises the Ministry of Commerce and the Starports Authority on
appropriate standards of handling, storage and transportation for
non-procedural items (the conduct of procedures being the province of
professional bodies and the occupational health and safety regulators).

* The IDP-P
"Pharmaceuticals" are defined as : "Those chemical compounds, tailored
organisms or nanotech constructs designed to produce a predictable,
specific effect or effects when administered to a given organism by the
route(s) and in the dosage range(s) specified."
	Agents are listed in alphabetical order, by system of action.
All have an approved IDP-P name ; the most common brand names and
manufacturers are then listed, as well as the Tech Level of
availability.
	The chemical structure of the compound, or hyperlinks to details of the
genetic sequence or ultrastructure of constructs, are then listed.
	Subsequently, all records contain the following fields :-
- - Origin of Agent
- - Pharmacodynamics (what the substance does to the organism)
- - Pharmacokinetics (what the organism does to the substance)
	Data is given in the categories above for all of the major races, and
most of the minor ones.
- - Known Adverse Reactions, Interactions, Precautions and
Contraindications to Use
- - Indications for Use
- - Dosage and Route of Administration
- - Presentation, Handling and Storage Data (including Materials Safety
Data).
- - Typical unit cost, in Imperial Credits

* The IDP-MI/TP
A "medical instrument" is defined as : "Any organism or artefact
primarily used to facilitate diagnosis, monitoring or therapy, that does
not fall into the definition of a \'pharmaceutical\'."

(So a scalpel is an instrument, whereas intravenous contrast agents are
pharmaceuticals).

Entries are divided into the following fields :-
- - Device name :- IDP standard, then eponymous or brand names with
manufacturer are listed. (Room for confusion exists. Robert\'s vs. Dever
retractors? DeBakey or Kielland\'s forceps? etc.)
- - Device type :- diagnostic, monitoring or therapeutic
- - Tech level of manufacture
- - Indications for use
- - Precautions and Contraindications to Use
This field also includes information about the sensitivity and
specificity of diagnostic and monitoring instruments. 
- - Presentation, Handling and Storage Data (including Materials Safety
Data).
- - Typical unit cost, in Imperial Credits

A "therapeutic procedure" is defined as : "Any course of action whose
primary purpose is to identify, limit the progression of, or cure,
pathological processes taking place within a patient, either with the
assistance of medical instruments or via the intercession of the
treating clinician(s) alone."

Entries are divided into the following fields :-
- - Procedure name, type and tech level are as per medical devices.
- - Material requirements (divided into a hierarchy of \'optimum safety\',
\'average risk\', \'emergency/field\').
- - The \'Indications\' section discusses the risk-benefit profile, as well
as the assembled evidence for or against the procedure. Evidence is
ranked according to the usual hierarchy of \'benefit proven via
meta-analysis of large randomised controlled trials\' through to \'on the
strength of a few case reports in the [relevant] literature\'.
- - Precautions and Contraindications

* Searching the IDP-P (-MI/TP)
Any reasonably sized starport (III/C+) should contain the relevant
databases (or the system\'s computer networks, if relations with the
Imperium are cordial).

* Illicit pharmaceuticals
Normally the Imperium does not intervene in the traffic of these
materials, except at the level of the local Starport Authority. Each of
these is advised by the government(s) of the system what items or
substances cannot cross the extrality line.
	However, the right to search and seizure where threats to the peace are
perceived to exist (e.g. bioweapons) is reserved by the various Imperial
agencies.

* Who Can and Can\'t Heal
Local medical authorities nominally regulate this, via licensing and
other requirements (exams, mandatory education, nepotism, bribes, etc.).
Through arranging reciprocal treaties with similar groups in
neighbouring systems, some uniformity of practice quality may exist
across subsectors, or even sectors.
	The latter situation is more likely, given the presence of the IN\'s
Medical Branch and the information it has compiled.

And remember that those jurisdictional turf wars are

of civil liberties and freedom from government
oppression, for which our ancestors gave their lives
200+ years ago in throwing off the yoke of the British
king and his unified police/army/navy state with its
Admiralty Courts and Stamp Taxes that you poor
benighted Canadians must suffer with even today ...

It doesn\'t violate conservation of energy, it violates conservation of baryon/lepton number.  In any case, that means you have a total-conversion engine, not an antimatter engine.  The assumption for antimatter power is presumably that you have a large generator plant somewhere which uses large amounts of power and does pair-creation of matter/antimatter and then separates the antimatter.

I think the idea is that antimatter is a compact way to store power; the antimatter power plant could be much smaller than some other conventional power plant.  Of course, given the power plants already in Traveller, it appears that the major weight is power conversion, not power creation, and thus antimatter wouldn\'t be much of a gain.

Essentially, Roger (spit) thinks that the DGP stuff is worth *far* more
than it really is, and is sitting on it.  Let me put it this way: for what
Sanger (spit) wants for the DGP rights, you could probably buy the D&D
franchise from WoTC.  So he sits, and we\'re cut off from some of the best
work ever done for Traveller.

     Has anyone ever applied Traveller to the ALIENS universe? Specifically
>ship design, space travel and the like.

The Alien itself showed up in an early Journal as the Reticulan Parasite.
Other than that, the Alien movies didn\'t provide much to go on.

We know that interstellar travel requires that passengers be in cold sleep
berths, and is ships in over-c can interact with the real universe (the
Nostromo diverts to investigate the Biker\'s distress call).  Robotic
technology is *way* ahead of the Imperium, able to produce artificial
humans that can fool observers for a long time.  I get the impression that
FTL travel is relatively (npi) slow.

It\'s in much earlier canon, too.  The Terrans invented
the jump drive more or less by accident while mining
the asteroid belt.  I think that the Solomani Alien
Module discusses it, as well as other GDW and DGP
materials.

Of course, the true story is that a Vilani ship
crashed near Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, and the
United States government spent a long time figuring
out how it worked.  After the United States took over
the United Nations through domination of the World
Trade Organization, it started a series of top-secret
probes into nearby space to find the Vilani and learn
their weaknesses.  Once it was sure that the Vilani
could be conquered, it allowed j-drive to be invented
by "miners in the asteroids", who were actually a
black ops team.  Then it was short road to war and
conquest of the Ziru Sirka.  The stars had been made
safe for Astroburger, Inc.!

Of course, the true true story is that some or all of
the preceding two stories is a Hiver manipulation
whose true purpose and intent will not be revealed for
some time.

Of course, the really true story is that the Hivers
are creations of Grandfather.

Of course, the underlying actual truth is that
Grandfather is a Hiver manipulation.

in Lunion/Strouden you\'re probably talking about an SDB fleet of  possibly

My guess is if there is a large naval force in the system, the SDB arm is
going to be subordinate to the bigger boys, with bigger ships.  So given the
above is true, Lunion/Strouden *might* have an Grand Admiral over the whole
fleet, and an Admiral for the SDB arm or maybe Vice-Admiral.

Jon, have you a copy of two documents from the Missouri Archives which
may partly offset this effect? Namely, Harold Hale\'s discussion post
from 1995 which attempts to assign Real Universe(TM) nearby stars to the

Ah, but every individual is optimizing their own priorities. The salesman
is optimizing his commission, the buyer is optimizing her satisfaction, the

As I\'ve said before, _I_ still have the legal right to copy DGP material,
because Roger Sanger hasn\'t bothered to inform me it\'s revoked. OTOH, the
reason he ignores me is that he owes me money, which means that all the
work I did for DGP after Starship Operator\'s Manual is actually mine;
assuming that others are in the same boat, I don\'t think that my
authorization would cover their work. Being in no position to check who
owns which article (ie who was paid for their work) I\'m probably better off
not copying.

The 12 million was an error, referring to the entire metropolitan
area.  The correct figure should have been 7 or 8 million, and
still is.  My home town was closer to 20,000 at the time (I was
using old figures, since checked) and is now close to 25,000.

As has become clear in our current discussion, there are actually
different missions - but those are not typically size-related.
This career is definitely for the \'municipal cop\', as contrasted
with the Highway Patrol, Parks Police, or other Law Enforcement
Agency.

The usage of \'Cop\' versus \'Officer\' was an artificial distinction
invented by me for the purpose of the article.  It\'s not unusual
to hear the real cops use terms like \'grunt\', \'brass\', \'boss\',
and the like to refer to UMOS (real terminology) that have
various ranks or assignments.

Needlessly complicated.  Just think about both the character of
the area and the needs of both the area and the Department.  A
city like New York is obviously going to be large, regardless of
anything else.  The municipal department of the Village of East
Backwater is going to be small, regardless, and the referee is
going to need to decide on the stuff between them.  That
paragraph was simply a rough at the way I would have made the
decision if I\'d actually needed to - but I tend to like complex.

Not true.  Again, consider character and needs.  On Vulcan, as
portrayed in ST:TOS, it\'s unlikely that the _Planetary_ police
would be a large department; they wouldn\'t need it.

Populations are off, but the illustration of the excessive
complexity is still valid.

Not true on the functional separation.  Or rather, possibly true
de jure, but the division is likely to exist de facto, even if
the Detective Bureau is a grand total of two cops - Joe Friday
and Bill Gannon.

Local conditions may change this - I could see a four-platoon
schedule on a world like DGP\'s Vland, with its 32-hour day.  Or,
if the species doesn\'t need a lot of sleep, two long platoons per
day may be sufficient.

Useful, but not necessary. It\'s entirely possible to erase the
distinction between squads and platoons, for example, and have a
large number of platoons with differing work schedules.
Organizations like the New York Fire Patrol (_not_ FDNY) do this,
with \'platoons\' working 24-hour shifts, and then having multiple
days off.  There\'s no reason that a LEA in a low-crime culture
couldn\'t use this kind of arrangement as well - and in fact,
early in its history, the New York Metropolitan Police (a
predecessor agency to today\'s NYPD) used a similar scheme.

As of the present writing, it seems that older departments have a
bias toward using cops for this; newer departments, or those
which have made a conscious effort (either voluntarily or under
duress) will have a higher percentage of civilian bureaucrats.

Other tables of organization are possible.  Look at the needs of
the area being policed.  This is NYC\'s, and it seems to me to be
generic enough to use almost anywhere - but I haven\'t seen the
entire world of policing.

Or not; depending on the needs of the department.

>RANKS AND TYPICAL TITLES (as used in the United States)

More correctly - "as used in New York City".  Other departments
use different tables; there _seems_ to be less variation below
the rank of Captain than above it.  As discussed, you can borrow
the table from another department, another service, or make up
your own entirely.

Not necessarily.  It turns out that small departments may have
E1; if several nearby small departments share an academy, E1s
will be prospective POs in what the NYPD calls \'Field Training\',
the next-to-last period of training.

The presence or absence of a Commissioner is strictly an issue of
politics.  You can have - or not - Commissioners at any level.

However, the "fact" that the Terrans copied Jump wasn\'t exactly stated
outright anywhere else either. I just find it interesting that once
they made it to the Asteroid belt, the Terrans just happened to discover
jump. Note that at last one moon of Jupiter and/or Saturn as well as
Pluto as interdicted Navy bases and have been so under all governments
that have occupied Terra. Note that the Terran discovery of Jump 3
was also crucial in their defeat of the Vilani... maybe the Terrans
found somethinf the VIlani had missed.

MT also refutes this. It was explicit that in order to successfully test Jump
Drive was to be _outside_ a strong gravity field. So in order to discover Jump,
you have to be off planet.

As well, Terrnas did not realised that Jump could be used for interstellar
travel. It was used for microjumping, and it took a lot of effort to use it to
go interstellar travel (supply caches et al).

Which is weird, because you can always carry 2 jumps worth of fuel on a J-1 ship, which is enough to reach alpha centauri or barnard\'s star.

Dass OK - the MT rules will be reasonably easily convertible to

from T4 to GURPS that won\'t be too far wrong.  Go ahead and write
it; I can guarantee it a good home.

ISTR that coal itself is naturally mildly radioactive, and typically 
piled in big heaps at power stations, in which case dust would be an 
issue. But it\'s a while since I did it so my memory may be fading.

What he\'s doing is sitting on the DGP stuff so that it\'s not

about licensing it so that _someone_else_ can get it back into

Actually, solar sails are also useful for "bulk cargo" transports. The
sort of stuff where you don\'t *care* how long it\'s been in transit as
long as loads show up regularly. Solar sails are sufficient to move
such between planets under control of an autopilot.

And unlike most other means of moving such cargos without human crews,
the low acceleration of solar sails is an *advantage*. It means that
it\'s not worth the effort to even *try* to hijack a cargo to use as
"deadfall ordinance" on a planet. It\'ll take so long to get there that
they *can\'t* miss the fact that there\'s something wrong, and they\'ll
have *plenty* of time to intercept the load.

(New) Scotland Yard is indeed the HQ of the Metropolitan Police (London),
but as a result has a lot of expertise in various areas of policing due to
the size of London, and through it\'s lengthy history.

It will often advise other regional Police Forces, if requested, as it has
many top experts in the more esoteric fields of criminology. It also has a
legacy in fiction dating back to Sherlock Holmes, as being the home of all
the \'top\' detectives.

This is probably due to authors in the 19thC and early 20thC having a London
bias, and also the fact that at this time Scotland Yard was one of the
foremost places world-wide in many early aspects of forensic detection, eg
Fingerprints etc.

Many well publicised crimes of the time involved both regional Police and
invited Experts from Scotland Yard in their solution.

AHA! That\'s where I\'ve gotten the impression that SY = FBI. There\'s been
a number of documentaries on the History channel, Discover, TLC, etc
where they discussed weird old crimes, several have been imprted from
the UK, and they showed detectuves from \'Scotland Yard\' running all over
England. That was it, then.

No, that last one\'s definitely not a reason, according to the fundamental,
family-friendly values of the OTU.  Not only is it not a reason, it\'s not

So\'s the armour. Apparently they were simply converted from previous

But the *physical* part (the superconducting "ring") is smaller.

Not really. It may have been such at one time, but it\'s definitely
*one* city now. East Portland, St. Johns, etc survive only as
neighborhood designations. 

We do have such oddities as the City of Maywood Park, where an area
about 6 blocks on a side incorporated so the could force the re-routing
of I-205 (which would have gone right thru the middle of their
neighborhood otherwise). 

Portland has annexed several smaller suburbs in the 20+ years I\'ve
lived here. And had a few others tell them to go to hell. There\'s even
a chunk of "unincorporated" territory that\'s successfully fought
annexation at least twice. Even though they are now *surrounded* by
Portland! 

Portland isn\'t going to expand much farther, except in a couple of
areas, simply because it\'s now up against former suburbs that are now
big enough to fight back. Gresham, Beaverton, Tigard, etc. 

The Police are definitely *Portland* police. The Sherriff\'s departments
are Multnomah county, Clacakmas county, and Washington County. Though
I\'m not sure if any of Portland is *in* Washington County. I\'d have to
check a map to be sure, but I think they finally "adjusted" the city &
county boundaries to be more rational. 

We *do* have an "agency" that spans the entire Metro area. But it
doesn\'t "do" police functions. Metro tends to go more for things like
land use regulations.

True enough. Unless (until?) you find large amounts of *natural*
antimatter, AM is "merely" the most efficient known method of *storing*
power. 

Actually, baring some major breakthroughs, it\'s not even that
*efficient*, not if you consider the amount of power it takes to *make*
a given amount of AM. It\'s just the most *concentrated* storage. 

In Traveller, we know of at least one source of "natural" AM.

Depending on your definition of \'smaller\', yes.  In terms of radius it\'s quite a bit larger.

using Bribery. Of course this Guard may be one of the previously mention

The smart play (if urgency is not essential), would be to use Streetwise to
find out more about the Guards, which ones are most susceptible to \'looking

perhaps a +1 or +2 DM on the bribery roll as you already know he\'s bribable
from the Streetwise.

I\'d say it depends on the number and size of the SDB\'s we\'re talking 
about. However Admiral would probably be the go, as I imagine they\'d 
have more than just the SDB\'s under their command (ie they\'d also have 
support ships, bases, etc).

In \'bananna republic\' style worlds they\'d always be an Admiral,the 
smaller the fleet, the higher the rank.

In short all the sensor and shooting tasks are one level harder or 
easier (I forget which) than they should be. Some where out there (The 
Missouri Archives?) there\'s a set of corrections, along with assorted 
enhancements, house rules, etc, etc by Merrick Burkhart (I think) for 
both BL and BR that are pretty complete. They\'re worth getting if you 
intend to use BL or BR.

Ah, I wish it existed. The feel is right, however, for many of the smaller
towns... those on roadgrids... And the portrayal of Bikers being laywers
and Doctors, well, that really was the case with a significant fraction of
the Hell\'s Angels in Fairbanks. The attitudes are right for southcentral
alaska, not southeast. The look is right, too. Alaskans who\'ve seen the
show either love it or hate it... it\'s "almost alaskan". And yes, Bush
pilots really do tend to be as flaky as Maggie...

Ob Trav: I wonder how much of peoples perceptions will be tainted by
fictionalized settlements. IMTU, most smaller worlds simply import
video-content en masse from the neighboring hi-pop worlds. Even if not a
cultural or governmental colony, areas too small for full spectrum
entertainment nets locally will be an "entertainment colony" of larger
areas. Which is why I like to create areas around high-pops with common
cultural facets from the imported entertainment.

Hmm... IMTU I use the following organization
System Navy: All ships in the System Navy Typically the one 4-Star. Large
system Navies might have a 5-star.
Fleet: 3 or more \'Rons Typically a VADM but may be an RADM.
Group: Occasional term for something bigger than a \'Ron and Smaller than a
Fleet. Typically a senior Commodore or a RADM
\'Ron: 12 Line Ships and their escorts, or 12 lines of smaller ships
Typically a Commodore\'s command
TaskForce: operational but not administrative unit comprise of 2-20 lines.
Typpically commanded by either a commodore from some staff unit or by the
senior Captain.
Line: For ships of the line (10KTd or more), one ship and it\'s assigned
escorts. For smaller ships in the 1-10KTd range, 2-4 ships. For Under 1KTd,
typically 5-12 ships. Typically commanded by a Captain.

SDB\'s typically are commanded by LCDR or CDR, the senior man in a line of
5-12 being a CDR and skipper of one of the boats. A Line of SDB\'s would
have a Captain. An SysDefRon, typically some 60-150 SDB\'s, is a Commodore\'s
command... maybe an RADM. Typically, however, IMTU you don\'t find
SysDefRons as other than admin units, and only a few worlds have the
capability for more than one... and said capability is often split with
Patrol Cutters.

In a very wealthy system (TLC+, Pop 9+), the system defense navy will have
a 4-star... and the several lines of SDB\'s are part of each of the DefRons.
Typical DefRon: 3 lines of SDB\'s, 3 of Patrol Cutters, 3 lines of CE\'s in
the 1-5KTd range, 2 lines of DD\'s, 1 line of a CL. So we have (1 CL + 2 DE)
+ 2(1DD + 2 CE)+ 3(3 CE) + 3 (5 PC) + 3(9 SDB) under a Commodore, maybe an
RADM.
Hmm... that\'s
1 CL
2 DD
13 CE
15 PC
27 SDB
as typical...

Why would you separate them out totally separate for a "Defense Fleet". By
keeping at least one mixed DefRon, you make the Ron non-deployable... and
as a system fleet, that helps prevent imperial activiation.

Since rotation is an *absolute* rather than a relative (that is,
unlike velocity, all observers will agree on your rate of rotation, as
adjusted for their time rate), "stopped" means stopped with respect to
the entire universe. 

Thus your your sidereal rotation period will be *zero*. Your year will
be the same as your solar day.

The circumference of the earth is about 24,000 miles. It takes 24 hours
to rotate once. So to a first approximation, the velocity at the
equator is about 1000 miles per *hour*. Still bad, but not as bad as
what you said above. 

At the poles, "nothing" will happen, because they aren\'t rotating. 

In between the velocity depends on (I think) the cosine of the
latitude. 

So we\'d have *supersonic* winds up to around 40 or 45 degrees latitude.

I\'m not sure *what* the oceans would be doing. 

BTW, if the "stop" effect isn\'t well focused, you might get the *crust*
of the planet skating around on the mantle. After all what\'s a dozen
miles out of a 4000 mile radius?

Rotational speed *can\'t* approach escape velocity. If it does, the
planet comes apart.

Give that at the equator the velocity difference is around 1000 mph,
they\'ll do a lot more than "swell". The question is *how much* more?

Nope. They continue along just fine *until* the turbulence caused by
the air moving over the ground reached whatever altitude they were at.
After all, if the *air* retains the old velocity, so does anything *in*
it.

True. But by the same reasoning, it\'d be transferred to whatever
produced the forces that *stopped* the planet. 

And it\'s the *angular* momentum that is being changed, not the linear
momentum. So the "stopper" would have to start *spinning* at a high
rate of speed. :-)

Nope. Nothing has changed the *orbit*, and the angular momentum of the
earth *around the sun* is a seperate entity from the angular momentum
of the earth about its axis.

Sorry, the vectors just plain *don\'t* work that way. He\'s confusing a
notational convention for angular momentum vectors (having them point
up or down along the axis of rotation) with the *actual* direction of
the angular momentum.

Actually, this isn\'t true. If you *completely* stopped the rotation,
then the planet is *not* "stopped with respect to the *sun*, but with
respect to the "fixed stars". So the length of the day and the length
of the year would be the same.

Given that on an earth-like world the velocity difference on the
majority of the planet are *supersonic*, it\'d pretty much wipe out
surface life and ocean life. You\'d still have the "deep rock" bacteria
as a reservior for life to spread from. But it\'d take a *long* time,
since they don\'t do well in oxygen atmospheres. Not that the oxygen in
the atmosphere will last long (a few hundred to a few thousand years as
the O2 reacts with all this leftover organic material). 

It\'s possible that various single cell organisms would survive, it
depends on how much *heat* gets generated by the friction as the
atmosphere and ocean come to rest. 


> Could this explain why there are so many tidally locked worlds,
> relatively speaking, in the OTU?

Nope. Because as I noted, it doesn\'t result in a tidally locked world.
It results in a "one-day planet" (to swipe a phrase). A planet with a
day as long as its year.

Well, consider that the oceans, etc are a *very* thin skin on a planet.
The deepest trench is only 7 miles deep, and the tallest mountian is
around 5 miles. That gives 12 miles as a range.

The radius of the planet is about 4000 miles. 12/4000 = .003. That\'s a
*minscule* fraction of the radius. 

Thus the "easy" answer is that they were off a trifle in setting the
radius of effect. :-)

If you\'re going to discuss the third item, at least in the OTU a lot of
the off-planet chicks are human anyway, it\'s their culture that\'ll be
different. It\'s left up to the imagination the mating practices of the
Vilani and Zhodani, not to mention the other human MINOR races.

Imagine the report from the initial human expedition to Barnard\'s Star...

"Yes sir, at least our male crew members were not without companionship
of the...ahem..."alien" humans. And our female crew members were,
surprised, to say the least, of the same."

This topic could EASILY become an off-list discussion! :) :)

I just checked my copy of Galactic, a software package no serious Traveller

In the Phoenix area there are multiple police departments- Phoenix,

Department, The "Department of Public Safety/Highway Patrol."  There is
also a military base with AP (Air Police) and other Federal assets which
have either "rent-a-cops" or federal police of various sorts.    Then you
can add in  the "Border Patrol" /INS (Immigration and Naturalization),
the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency), the FBI, and the ATF (Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms).

As far as the enforcement-Some of the cities have "photo-radar."  This is
vehicle they park alongside the road-it clocks your speed, takes a
picture of anyone speeding and mails you a ticket.  Other cities have
"red-light radar."  This is a setup which takes pictures of anyone
running red lights and mails you a ticket.  Some cities have both and
some have none.  In some locations the "left turn arrow" comes on before
the standard green light, in others it comes on after the green light.  

In some places there are stop lights on the on-ramps to the freeway, in
others there are not.  

Beyond traffic law, in Mesa at one point it was illegal to smoke
cigarettes anywhere where a non-smoker had to be exposed to the smoke in
order to enter a public building.  If I remember right the Fire
Department was responsible for writing the ticket-but I could be wrong.  

I guess that would be a balkanized law enforcement setup.  What a
nightmare for the crew of the Far Trader who rented a grav car to drive
to that important business meeting.

ISTR that coal itself is naturally mildly radioactive, and typically

Radon gas.  Gets into the lungs real easy and decays from there.  Also found, from memory, in granites (which contain lots of other stuff) and given of by some basalts (can\'t remember which ones).

I have finally been able to get some time to do some drawings for 102

Some real world data, folks.
	RTG driven pacemakers were proposed in the late 1960s. An occasional
few examples were built in the following decade.
	Improvements in the energy density of chemical batteries, plus better
understanding of the electrical requirements for a pacemaker (only
microampere currents are required), have led to the situation today,
where said batteries get electively changed every 2-4 years.
	Clinical expertise has also developed over years of long use to the
point where pacing is a last resort treatment. Cardiac disease severe
enough to mandate pacemaker placement is nasty. It is equivalent to
heart failure, which has a long term outlook comparable to many
malignancies (e.g. 5 year survival rates of about 20%).
	Some improvement on this grim statistic is being made as our
understanding of ischaemic heart disease and the best ways to prevent
and treat it grows.
	So on risk-benefit grounds, having a chunk of plutonium in your chest
is unlikely to shorten your life expectancy from radiation-induced
malignancy. In any case, such a power source hasn\'t been necessary for
at least a decade for this application.
	Pacemakers can be interfered with by other things, which will probably
be even more common than nuke dampers in tomorrow\'s built environment.
Any sufficiently powerful source of EM interference will
cause pacer failure, either via induced currents or heating(!). MR
scanners, diathermy machines and multi-watt radio transmitters are 
example troublemakers.

	Our VIP should have medical backup (either imported or provided by the
host) in order to provide prompt, competent resuscitation in the event
of pacemaker failure (ranging from resetting the pacer with a magnet to
external pacing to circulatory assist
devices and low berthing, etc.). Anything less would be criminally
stupid, especially for such a simple and common emergency.

My apologies to the lawyers on the list, but :-
Generally the problems laywers are asked to solve are not immediately
life-threatening, but are sufficiently complex to require many hours in
their solution (human nature being what it is).

Medicine, especially in my current area of employment, has lots of
problems that need fixing within an hour or two. In fact, most of them
need solution within five to ten minutes.

Interesting.  I was already familiar with Harold\'s "real stars list," and for
local color I intend to point out some of the more famous stars in the
capsule writeups I\'m doing.

I wasn\'t familiar with his algorithm for correcting the stellar types, but in
fact I have done something similar "on the fly."  I\'ve converted all Type IV
and Type VI stars to V, for example, and I\'ve turned some of the white
dwarf stars into main sequence members (mostly M-class).  I also turned
M9 V stars into M8 Vs.  None of this was done particularly systematically,
but as a first approximation the results don\'t look too bad.  If any of the
playtesters howl in protest I can always go back and hand-tweak a
couple dozen stars to fit a more reasonable distribution.

On the other hand, I don\'t have as much trouble with having Earthlike
worlds around the tinier M-class dwarfs.  What I\'ve been doing is deciding
on a planetary climate and then computing the orbital radius from that.
I\'m not limiting myself to the old Book 6 method of having the orbits fall
into the fixed Bode sequence.  Those Earthlike worlds near M8 V stars
just orbit *very close in*.

(Of course, I\'m glossing over the fact that tide-locking causes its own set
of problems, but this is Traveller, after all. . .)

There\'s one world in the sector circling a D-class primary, but that world
isn\'t particularly Earthlike anyway -- I plan on writing it up as a "cryo-
world" with an ambient temperature not far above absolute zero.  And
a population in the tens of millions, of course :-).

Well, they do need fuel, but the real bulk is the
containment, not the fuel. One gram of anti-matter
contacting one gram of matter will give 1.8 x 10^17
joules of energy, a lot! Antimatter is produced all
the time by natural decay, as in uranium ore deposits
(or thorium, radium, etc), just very very little, and
it doesn\'t last long, soon bumps into matter and zaps
it and the matter into a burst of gamma rays. Small
amounts (a few atoms) of antimatter have been stored
in our time, but they require huge magnetic fields. 

Anyhow, the point is that a very small amount of
antimatter will keep you going a long time; the
aforementioned one gram of antimatter would keep a 100
MW reactor going for 57 years! (assuming 100%
efficiency, even at 5% efficiency you still get a
whole year)
Who wants to worry about refuelling with a gram?

However, I do wonder about those containment fields,
what if they fail? This suggests either unimagined
technology or another reactor giving power for those
fields. Suposing that fails... I guess this is why
anti/matter reactors aren\'t yet on ships until very
high TLs?:)

Hi Luther,

Brilliant Lances is pretty good.  My only little complaint is that the
movement record keeping is a little hard to pick up quickly.  We can set
up a game when you and Glenn are done pulverizing the planet Mongo in

Sounds closer...

"Just remember that you\'re standing
On a planet that\'s evolving,
And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour.
It\'s orbiting at ninety miles a second,
So it\'s reckoned,
About a Sun that is the source of all our power.

Is this hyperbole? Are you serious, or guessing, or jesting? I mean, I love

I would hope that Doug was exaggerating just a little. After all, the D&D
franchise likely has a value in the tens of millions. As far as greed or
sheer stubborn pigheadedness goes, personally I\'m not going to really pass
judgement because I don\'t know enough of what\'s going on. He did burn Robert
Prior, who seems to be a rather good egg, and that, in itself, is a heinous
crime.

The value of the material has depreciated already because it\'s available to
so few people.

Nah,that\'s a disk drive alright, we had one just like it.
Heck, we left the cover unscrewed so we could just lift and give it a kick
during reboot.
Worked for years like that.

	As usual, the number of opinios about TNE equals or exceeds the 
	number of people talking about it. IMHO, :

	Bad things:

	The rules used 1d6 as damage dice, which allowed characters to 
	absorb huge amount of damage before dying.

	Skill system... well... I just did not like it. We began to use
	CORPS system after first few TNE sessions.

	Good things:

	Damage rules include penetration value, which makes it possible 
	to design various low-penetration and high-penetration 
	ammunition. (shaped charges, "bean bags", etc.)

	Armor and damage was based on one set of rules, so that the same 
	amount of damage could be applied against a starship, vehicle or 
	a living creature. It is possible to calculate the amount of 
	damage inflicted by a falling rock, ramming ship, etc.

	The reactionless thruster was replaced with fuel-consuming 
	rocket engine. This change made it more difficult to accelerate 
	ships into ridiculous speeds.

	FF&S technology rules allows the design of a wide variety of 
	equipment with some detail. (some portions of FF&S are still 
	oversimplified)

	Brilliant Lances has enough detail to make starship combat 
	interesting. Since normal character skills are used in combat 
	tasks, a high-skill PC can make difference in some situations.

	Starship combat is done on long ranges. Since it is possible to 	
	hit a starship-sized target within 4 light seconds (40 hex), 
	space combat resembles more submarine warfare than aircraft 
	dogfights.

	BL is very good, but requires much preparation. It is better

	BR is simplified version of BL, intended for large-scale

    'body' => 'I\'ve been poking around with one of the "bad penny" Traveller issues, the
star mapping system.  Certainly not one of the hot button issues, but one
that pops up on the list occasionally in various forms (a 3D mapping thread
appeared recently).  Every Ref who questions the artifice of the rectangular
A4 subsector hex maps may wonder if there isn\'t a "better" way.  Of course,
"better" depends entirely on what you value in a system.  In my opinion,
anyone wanting to run a Spinward Marches campaign, for example, would be
more than amply rewarded for accepting the old hex maps due to the wealth of
available source material in that setting.  It certainly never bothered me
in high school when I first played the game.  In those days, the paperwork
required to use a three dimensional system, or even a simple non-hex
determinate grid, was simply not worth the trouble.

In some ways, mapping is only an issue if you contemplate the Way of the
Heretic, and are starting with a relatively clean slate.  After looking at
the existing map data, I decided that for my own campaign, I would need to
redo most of a sector or two.  This opens the door to speculation about
other changes to the mapping scheme.  Also, the casual power of the software
at my fingertips today is quite a bit different than it was in 1980.

I am familiar with the practical problems with attempting 3D star mapping
for Traveller.  (Anyone who isn\'t should refer to the sidebar on page 47 of
GT:First In for a good summary.)  Still, the idea holds some fascination,
and has a certain \'cool factor\'.  Another way of thinking about this
problem, aside from geometric issues, is the degree to which real-world
astrography can be used.  When I create an Earth-like planetary setting
(i.e., a fantasy world), the first \'world builder\'s handbook\' I reach for is
a World Atlas.  There\'s nothing like using the real thing, at least in bits
and pieces.  I am sure I\'m not alone in this practice.  I wondered what the
results of applying Traveller jump travel to a \'real\' star map would be.

["Go for it!" says the little red guy with the fork on my shoulder.  "It\'ll
never work," says the bored cherub, opposite.  "A hopeless quagmire!"]

So I decided to at least explore the possibilities of a 3D TU, roughly based
on real astronomy data.  : P

What would be the real practical problems, rather than merely the speculated
ones that get discussed?  How \'dense\' would star travel be in this
environment?  Do stars naturally occur in J1-2 mains, and are there really
rifts or other distribution phenomena that might \'stretch\' out travel and
political boundaries?

Since I happen to have both tools and skills that can be applied toward
these questions, I am spending a little time on it.  Unless I get a Big Yawn
from the list, I\'ll share my results with the TML.  Anyone let me know if
I\'m reinventing the wheel here.
_____

Source Data

I\'m currently using the Hipparcos star catalog for my source data.  I have
only imported the data from hip_main.dat file, which contains 118,218
records.  A *very* few of these records lacked parallax data, and were
discarded.  The rest were plotted into a Cartesian coordinates table, with
Sol at 0,0,0.  A record was added for Sol at 0,0,0.  : )

A destinations child table was compiled from the main Cartesian reference
table.  Due to the projected processing time required for finding J1-6
destinations for every star in the catalog (well over 30 hours on my P300
server), I decided to limit myself (for now) to a sample set of data: all
the catalog stars within 60 parsecs of Sol.  This comes to 9946 records, a
very reasonable sample data set (just under 10% of the total catalog).
_____

Destination Counts

In order to get a feel for Traveller-style interstellar travel in this
setting, I am running queries against this database that count the available
destinations from each star in the sample.  These destination counts can
then be compared to those in the OTU (for amusement only - please, no
wagering!)  : P

For the purposes of this model, all stars are assumed to be useful refueling
points, and thus potential destinations for star travel.  (This is *not* an
assumtion I would make in an actual campaign.)
_____

Total Destinations at J6 or Less

Let\'s cut to the chase and see just how bad the destination-inflation is in
3D Traveller.  This result set is rather long, so I have snipped portions of
it for brevity.  There\'s enough here to get a feel for the data.  The first
result column is the count of destinations available to a star at Jump-6 or
less.  The second column is the number of stars to which the destination
count applies.  The third column is the percent of the total sample that the
star count makes up.

These numbers are pretty bad, as expected.  Can you image fueling up your
J-6 Yacht and having 112 possible jump destinations to choose from?  Yikes!

I\'ve already used a lot of bandwidth for a single post, so I\'ll stop here.
Remember - these numbers are for Jump-6.  If we limit the jump capability,
the results get much more interesting (and encouraging, ...and shorter,
too).  So, anyone interested in seeing this same table at max Jump-3?

IMHO

Stick with the Battle Rider movement system.

The one in BL manages to combine increased complexity with reduced realism.

The amount of effort gone into trying to make a turning circle system
emulate a vector movement system is amazing - especially the bit about
having 12 facings instead of 6 and then how your ship moves along hex edges...

I just can\'t figure out why they bothered.

Hi,

There was a Sourz class heavy fighter printed in an issue of
challenge (about issue 45 ish) complete with a picture and stats for
MT. I can\'t remeber what the displacement was though. I\'ll check over the 
weekend. I can scan it and mail it to you if you like.

Not really when you look at the actual circumstances of the invention. The
team that developed Jump drives were infact trying to produce maneuver
thrusters. It was as if the Terrans were trying to build a better mousetrap
and ended up with a spice rack. So the Terrans get this niffty new drive with
no real idea of how it actually works. So they don\'t understand the theory
behind the extremely complex calculations involved in plotting a course
through jump space and instead base their calcuations on some rough and
ready rules of thumb based on obsevational evidence. Hence these
calculations become hidiously inaccurate as range increases, drastically
limiting the range of the early Terran jump drives. Only when their equations
increased in accuracy were they able to get anything like sufficent range for
interstellar travel. IMTU I limit 1st generation J-drive to around 30 AU, and
2nd generation (the ones used to reach the stars) to about 1 LY. Only when
they contacted the Vilani did they realise that their equations were totally
stuffed and finally get things right.

While the M\'s do not have a lot of potential as habitable planets, they do have
a good change of having gas giants as fuel sources; very important in a
Traveller universe.

I did some work on the Gleise a while ago.  I believe in that data a jump 3
would get you pretty much anyware with patience, while a jump 1 was worthless.
The analysis I did was based around generating "clusters" of mutually accessable
stars for a given jump number, then determining how many seperate clusters the
database boiled down to.

I think that the idea of running traveller in 3D is really great.  3 dimensions
must have effects on trade and strategy which we miss entirely in 2D games.

That\'s the second time in two months that someone has quoted that song

I would be very interested in having the cartesian coordinates table.

I don\'t think that a table of destinations is the way to go for a
project like this. A far better idea would be to write a small program
that takes the coordinates table and lets you pick a star which to view.
Add in stars that can be reached with different jump ranges in different
colors in some kind of 3D-projection. Perhaps secondary (2 jumps)
destinations should be added as well.

This is what I\'ve been considering anyway. Such a program would not be
terribly hard to write, and it would be very nice. Styling it like an
actual navigation aid would help a lot as well  *grin*

Ideally, the same program would include UWP and star data as well, but
that would mean a lot of work.

<snip>

Since you get a LOT of possible destinations, I would suggest making
refueling points (gas giants) rather rare in such a campaign. Otherwise,
as you point out, high-tech ships will get ANYWHERE very quickly.

In order to make J-1 ships useable to any degree, I would suggest
allowing drop tanks *shudder*

Or perhaps just upscaling the jump ranges a bit, so that a J-1 ship can
get from Sol to Alpha Centauri in one jump.

Seeing the table at J-3 would help me deciding if such a campaign is
useable. Please mail it, either here or in private mail.

You must have seen a different set of Star Wars movies than
I did, then :-).  One of the things I liked about Star Wars
was the fact that the high-tech equipment was frequently dirty,
banged up, had access panels missing where some teenage garage
mechanic was working on it, etc.  It WASN\'T "gosh-wow" stuff to
the characters in the movie, it was just everyday machinery--
which is how it should be in a 20,000-plus-years-old starfaring
civilization.

I had a free trader captain with Liason-9 once. I rolled her up
from Book 8 Merchants, IIRC, and kept trying to get that last Legal-1
skill to qualify for her Captaincy--and term after term, I kept
rolling Liason instead! I was determined to have a free trader Captain
though, so I didn\'t give up no matter how old she got...

Exactly! I mean, can you really say something like

"discovered it by accident while mining the asteroid belt"

(which was most likely caused by the FInal War)? Sheesh!

Anyway, there is a certain amount of play here with regards
to how you interpert this little bit of canon.

Certain parts of the various Traveller books are obviously
meant to state absolute reality in the Traveller universe.
The amount of damamge from a shotgun, for example. Other
bits are obviously very much "in-game" and need to be 
interpreted as such. The description of events during the
rebellion, for instance. The description of these events
is meant to be subjective, biased and subject to interpretation.

Other bits are, however, much less clear.

Is the Terran discovery of jump drive meant to fall in 
the first category or the second? Obviously many of
you feel that it falls in the first - it\'s simply a statement 
of fact to help the ref understand the universe and set
the scene. I think it\'s in the second category - it\'s what
the characters, not the players, understand to be reality
and it\'s not necessarily 100% true. As a matter of fact,
I sincerely hope that no one runs a campaign where the
players know anything with 100% certainty. :)

While it may be true that you\'ll probably never invent
jump technology inside 100 diameters of a major stellar 
body, don\'t you find it a bit odd that in Imperial space
alone, out of the several dozen human races and the 
countless non-human races, only _2_ races actually
"invented" jump? While at the same time at least one 
other human race (and maybe other non-human races) actually
did copy jump drive off of an Ancient relic? What about
the infamous "black globe"? According to canon, the Imperium,
even at TL 15, in its most advanced research labs, can\'t
build the damn things - most of the black globe units
come from Ancient sites (there is a canon ref for this,
but I don\'t know it off the top of my head...).

And the fact that almost every race (except the Hivers 
and perhaps the K\'kree) had evidence of extensive Ancient
facilities on their homeworld? I mean, on Zhodane and
Vland there are basically gigantic buildings and broken
down Manga-style monster robots sitting there with gigantic
pictures of Grandfather on the side! Do you really believe
that hundreds of generations of humans just looked at these
artifacts and just said "eh, old junk - I think I\'ll go
mine some asteroids"????

Anyway, maybe I better stop before I start frothing at the 
mouth (again).

Well, this doesn\'t really refute it, per se. This statement can be true

This seems to only prove the fact that the Terrans had no frickin\' idea
how the damn thing worked - presumably if you designed something like
this, you\'d know how far it could go. (Though I am reminded of the 
warnings that trains should not go above 20 miles per hour for the
fear of "sucking people\'s breath away" or somesuch).

These numbers are pretty bad, as expected.  Can you image fueling up your

Yikes!
</Kurtis>

To make matters worse, you\'re probably missing a lot of stars in that
database.  At least that\'s the case with the one I\'ve tinkered with, the
Gliesse data.  The problem is that as distance from earth increases, you
get a selection bias towards bright stars and the most common stars
(little red M classes) are not detected.  The effect is quite steep, I
remember noticing that even at 50 ly, the stellar density in the Gliesse
data was significantly lower than that inside 25 ly.  

One solution to the "too many destinations" problem is to change jump from
parsec to lightyear units.  Jump-6 would then become only about Jump-2, if
you get my meaning.

Rob, why all the pussyfooting around? Roger is obviously not in a
"cash rich" position or he\'d pay you. If he can\'t afford to pay
you, I don\'t see how he\'s going to afford a lawyer. Copyright isn\'t
somthing that\'s enforced by the police, last time I checked. And to
top it off, if enough copyright violations occur, then he _can\'t_
sue you. These rights need to be policed by the holder (correct
me if I\'m wrong).

Photocopy as many books as you want. If Roger doesn\'t come after you
after the first few, then you have (what I believe is) a valid
legal defence.

For heaven\'s sake - come the New Year I resolve to find some time
to photocopy my DGP books until they fall apart from photodegredation.

Everybody on this list treats Roger Sanger like he\'s some sort of grenade
with the pin already half out. I seriously doubt he can scrape together
the postage to send me a registered letter to cease and desist.

If I\'m totally wrong on this one, I\'d love to have someone explain 
it to me.

I\'ve got the same conclusion.
IMTU (3D) I added one more parsec per jump. Jump 1 is 2 parsecs and jump 6 is 7 parsecs.
I\'ve converted the Gateway Campaign Data into a chview file.
One of my target was to save the jump-distances between the major systems. With I think good results.

    'body' => 'Kurtis\'s recent post on 3D mapping got me thinking about the issue of the
2D map in Traveller again.  The most appealing solution to this, IMO, is
to assume that the 2D maps represent "jump space" and that "real space" is
still 3D.  Some problems with this:

- -Canon discusses long-range STL colony ships that travel "coreward" from
earth to the Marches, suggesting a large-scale correspondence between jump
space and real space.

- -Canon also mentions several shorter-range phenomena, such as small
STL-based empires and the shock wave from the Darrian star-trigger, which
suggest a small-scale real-to-jump correspondence.

- -Mapping between 3D and 2D is complex, though there are (As I understand
it) and infinite number of solutions to the problem, mathematically.

So, what we need is a scheme that satisfies all these things and relates
2D jumpspace to 3D real space in a relatively simple manner.  A
possibility I was considering recently is that jump-space constitutes a
ripple-pattern with its origin at the galactic center. Picture a "rock
dropped in water" kind of ripple, but tighter, with a wave amplitude of
about 2 subsectors and a frequency of about 1 parsec.  Thus, you get a
picture of realspace by folding your sector maps up like an accordion
along the spinward-trailing lines between every odd subsector.  This would
only be the general pattern, there would be disruptions and "noise" in the
system (due to high-gravity objects like black holes perhaps).   

The advantage of this is that it allows jump space to move through normal
space and occupy all points in normal space.  It also explains why the
maps don\'t use directions like "galactic north" or "galactic south", as
these are relatively meaningless (since you\'re effectively travelling
coreward or rimward while travelling along these directions in realspace
anyway).  With regards to STL ships, these can travel by "cutting through" 
the maps, but still generally travel in the directions described.  It
works less well for short-range things, as the small STL empires should be
able to access worlds several parsecs away, but one can accept that they
"happened" to go after worlds along a plane in jump space.  Certainly this
requires less suspension of disbelief than a 2D star map.  The Darrian
disaster should also have affected worlds several subsectors over, though
one could shift cannon a little to say that either it did or that the
disaster only affected Darian itself, which then dragged their
civilization down with it by cultural and economic factors alone. 

So, any thoughts? Problems I haven\'t considered?

That\'s pretty close to how I run it -- a 400-ton tech-12 SDB is normally
commanded by a lieutenant; the jump shuttle, if present, is commanded by
a sublieutenant.  Most of the crew are ratings.  A 50-ship wing would be
led by a commander.  The planetary navy is led by an officer with a rank
no higher than commodore, as per High Guard; most planets have less than
one squadron-equivalent of ships.  The occasional rich high population
world may have multiple squadron-equivalents and several commodores, with
a senior commodore in charge.  The subsector (or "reserve" or "colonial")
fleet which is raised by the local duke is commanded by a fleet admiral;
it consists of squadrons on loan from planetary navies, and a cadre of
squadrons permanently under subsector command made up of surplus Imperial
ships.   

IMTU, the Imperium discourages planetary navies from having an admiral
rank -- it\'s considered a challenge to subsector authority.

The gist was that:

1) I capped jump ranges at about 9 light-years, and assumed that this
represented Jump-2.  I used a linear relationship between jump number
and range, so that jump-1 was 4.5 light-years.  That kept the expected
number of destinations reasonable (i.e. greater than zero, but less than
ten or so).

2) You won\'t get "mains" of jump-1 accessible stars.  With the range
assumptions I made above, though, you\'ll get "chains" of jump-2
accessible stars reaching in several directions outward from Sol.

Good question.  I think parts of Old Expanses were developed by "land
grant" in the CT days in one of the non-GDW sources.  It\'s possible
that someone dredged this up from there, and it might explain the 
whacked gov code.

    'body' => 'Hi there!

Sorry for the delay in replying, I am just in the
process of rendering unto the modern medium of
computer that which has been in scrap paper form for
some years. When it\'s pretty much proofread, I\'ll send
it on. I assume you\'ll be able to handle an excel file
or similar...

I\'ve not read the traditional traveller books. As I
alluded to in that post, I based it all on the rules
suggested in Gurps: Space. In fact, IMTUIIRT (In My
Traveller Universe It Isn\'t Really Traveller). I
wanted a different, grungier flavour to it all, more
like "Aliens" or "Outland."

The basic "science" works like this:

Two kinds of engines: reaction drives, requiring fuel,
and hyperdrives, requiring two big bursts of power,
one to enter hyperspace, one to leave it. These big
bursts are so big that capacitors are required, the
consequence being that most ships take a few hours to
get ready to jump, and because they need to recharge
can\'t use their h-drives to teleport just a few miles
(which would make space combats a nightmare!) The
calculations for a jump are complex, requiring several
hours on a computer, though they can be done ahead of
time, the last details at the last minute. 

H-space can only be entered far from a star\'s gravity
well, etc etc, thus there\'s a fair bit of travel time
involved in-system.

Average "speed" depends on the rating of the H-drive
(compared to the mass of the ship in real tons), but
most ships get 0.25 parsecs/day. Courier ships manage
ten times that, bulk freighters 0.05 parsecs/day.
Naval ships get 0.25 p/day because they don\'t give a
damn for expense, or the comfort of their crews (ie,
not much space left after engines, h-drives,
capacitors and reactors...)

Things in H-space cast a "shadow" in real space which
can be detected, and since H-space is not homogenous,
but there are easy paths and difficult paths (a bit
like wooded hills), and the ship\'s computer calculates
the "easy" path, ships tend to come out in roughly the
same area of space in each system. And so there exist
Inderdictor class Imperial Commonwealth ships which
can pull a "passing" ship out of h-space. Most
embarassing if you\'re smuggling arms to rebels.

I also use a 3-d starmap, just to keep things
interesting.

I would certainly be VERY interested in both the hip_main.dat file and 
the database you imported it into, if you don\'t mind sharing...
I would do my darndest to import it into access, if it is not an

I really am interested in the form your query took. What database

It grows on you.  The nicest thing is the writers have realized that even
in science-fiction, stories have to be about people.  The crew onboard
Moira is developed nicely and they grow in interesting directions.  And
they all have something to hide...

Not hard.. bloody near impossible.

Atlas was just that.  Maps of each sector of the Imperium.  On;y high-pop
worlds were named, no real information.. but it was fun to look at.

Anybody else photocopy all the maps and tape together a wall map of the

Atlas of the Imperium. GDW, about 84. On the cloneable list. It\'s just the
maps, it lacks the data.

Yes, it is hard to acquire.

Uh, last I heard, Sanger was asking high 6 figures to sell the materials
(all plus the incometed manuscripts), and was willing to pay 5% if
liscenced. MWM offered him high 4 figures, or asked 10% plus an initiation
fee (undisclosed) for the liscence.

Rodge seems to be a nice enough guy, but *CLUELESS* about the value of
money. And about typical buisiness practices. And Common Sense.

Not hard.. bloody near impossible.

Atlas was just that.  Maps of each sector of the Imperium.  On;y
high-pop
worlds were named, no real information.. but it was fun to look
at.

Anybody else photocopy all the maps and tape together a wall map
of the
Imperium?

I would love to be able to use this for a future game I plan on

possible to get a copy of your sorted data after you are finished?  This 
sounds like a *great* tool for future sci-fi GM\'s.  A destinations table 
(star X on this column and Star Y on this row means they are 52 LY away) 
and a map with earth at 0,0,0 would probably be the most useful tools I can 
think of right now.

If you can\'t tell, I\'d love to see the data for Jump 2 and 3. ;)

On humble request:  Please don\'t take the computer program route for 
exclusively displaying the data.  I am looking for something functional in 
a game.  I mean, I own a laptop, I just don\'t use it in my games.

There are an infinite number of solutions, but no solutions that don\'t result in locations which are very close together in 3d being extremely separated in 2d.

I\'d probably increase the scale to 2 parsecs, the real density of stars is well under .5/cubic parsec.  The problem here is that your \'ripple pattern\' may go all the way out from the core, but it\'s only taking a 16 parsec disk out of the galaxy.  If you go beyond that (rather narrow) disk, either jump drive becomes impossible, or you are suddenly on a who _new_ jump-space, which would be many thousands of parsecs away by jump routes (if we assume they meet at the core).

Oh, another problem I just thought of.  Jump to the edge of a \'ripple\'.  Take a week to cross (normal-space) into the next \'ripple\'.  Jump again, to the other edge of that ripple\'.  With a jump-1 drive, every 2 weeks you can move 32 parsecs.... (this also works for the problem above, letting you jump thousands of parsecs in a couple weeks).

You can resolve both problems by having big chunks of space which can\'t be jumped into, but this has its own weird problems.

Unfortunately, it doesn\'t occupy all points.  In addition, any sort of \'real-space to jump-space\' mapping is going to wind up with the problem that at real star densities you can fit the entire imperium in a box some 60 parsecs on a side, which suddenly means that there _are_ new frontiers, if you\'re willing to take a fairly short normal-space hop.

	This is pretty much how I use it.  I don\'t see paying someone

	Bribery.  When it is time to bribe someone, the roll may be

No apology needed.  There should be no dispute that
what you said is true.  A small amount of the legal
work that is done involves threats to life -- death
penalty work, some immigration/deportation cases, some
family law situations (spouse/child abuse).  A smaller
amount involves immediate threats.  So we tend to sit
and stew over problems, do research, talk to
colleagues, write letters and motions, etc.  So tv
totally mischaracterizes the length of time needed to
resolve legal issues.

And "need" is not a rhetorical device in those two
sentences.  If the problem isn\'t fixed, the person
with the problem may die or suffer some grievous
physical harm.  

Ob Traveller (you guys were waiting for the ob
Traveller, weren\'t you?):  I think tv is misleading
about the career of a space traveller.  Some problems
will have to be solved in minutes or an hour ("we have
major damage to life support systems"), but others
will take much longer ("if Ensign Smith makes a pass
at me one more time, I\'m going to report her ... or
accept it; I haven\'t decided").  We won\'t get rich
easily.  We won\'t all have cool spaceships.  Alien sex
partners will be plentiful, but they\'ll be really
weird.

game.

Julian Dibbell
I\'d like to see money grow on trees. Here\'s how it might work:

You would buy your money tree at a licensed nursery or other financial
institution. You could pot it and stand it in a sunlit hall, or you could
plant it in the backyard, as space and landscaping plans allowed. A money
tree would be an intricate and lovely thing.

The product of intense genetic engineering, the tree would bear fruit
according to precise, chemically coded commands released from a sealed
plant-food box buried in the midst of its root system. The box would have a
network connection to your bank, which would fund the tree at your request
by transferring money from your account to the food box. A logic chip inside
the box would translate dollar amounts into plant-food doses, stimulating
the tree to produce fruit proportionate in total biomass to the money vested
in it.

Once harvested, the fruit could be taken to any nearby genetic-assay machine
(found in bank lobbies, supermarket produce sections, etc.), which would
pulp it, analyze it for DNA markers identifying it as a financial instrument
backed by your bank, and convert it back into cash. Seedless and difficult
to clone, the fruit could also be offered directly to others in exchange for
goods and services. It would be legal tender for all debts, public and
private. It would be money, and it would grow on trees.

The money tree would also be an investment, of sorts. Food doses would be
calculated so that the value of the fruit when ripe would, with any luck,
exceed the amount transferred into the tree earlier in the year, perhaps by
as much as eight percent annualized. Typically, though, weeds, bugs, birds,
bad weather, or the like would limit returns to four or five percent (tree
bankers would make their cut on the spread between the maximum possible
return and the average actual return). Also, you\'d probably want to buy the
bank\'s insurance against blight, fruit rustlers, and other such
catastrophes, thus further cutting into your upside.

As an investment, therefore, the money tree would be no great shakes. As a
status symbol, however, it would shine. Its fruit would have a distinctive
look -- I imagine a smooth, intensely glossy skin, colored in deep, mottled
greens and yellows, with variations in hue and shape depending on the
denomination. There would be no mistaking a $100-a-gram tree (commonly known
as a Benjamin tree) from its $10-a-gram cousin (Monetaria sawbuckus), and of
course it would be 10 times as beautiful to behold.

The tree would thus instantly project its owner\'s wealth, but more than
that, it would project a stylishly organic relationship to that wealth. In
an age at last grown weary with the increasing speed and abstraction of its
money, the money tree would symbolize patient investment in things of
concrete, human value. It would stand in contradiction to the usual
connotations of money growing on trees, suggesting instead that money does
not come easy -- that its growth requires thoughtful nurturing, daily care,
and a thorough grounding in the earthy realities of physical existence. It
would be especially popular with derivatives traders, software moguls, and
others whose wealth in fact rests entirely on electronic blips and
lightning-fast turnarounds.

The money tree would be a great conversation piece. And many who might find
an outright gift of cash distasteful would accept its fruit with pleasure.
Recipients could tastefully display the fruit on mantelpieces and coffee
tables; they could savor its beguiling scent (said merely to hint at the
deliciousness of the flesh itself) as they carried it to the bank for
deposit.

And for the superrich, the money tree would open up a whole new dimension in
after-dinner entertainment. In ancient Mexico, where cocoa beans were
currency, chocolate was a drink enjoyed exclusively by the nobility; so too,
in a world where money trees were de rigueur, it would be the privilege of
postindustrial aristocracy to serve up slices of one\'s net worth with the
cheese and port.

Guests might be tempted, of course, to wrap up their dessert in a napkin and
slip it into a purse or pocket; but only the hopelessly gauche would
succumb. The proper guest would chew on the fruit lingeringly and,
especially if he or she had never tasted money before, with a look of
knowing appreciation. And if the flavor were in fact not all it was cracked
up to be -- well, who at the table would dare to say so?

I\'d forgotten all about that. We just used BR\'s system (which comes

All of this data, btw, is readily available online; these are known as
the Genie files, as in ancient times, B.C.I. (Before Common Internet)
they were available on the Genie information service.

IIRC, the Traveller archives at MPGN had them. I have a set at:

http://www.u.arizona.edu/~bjohnson/archives/sectors.zip

I have source code for a postscript subsector map generator, and
utilities to chop the sector files into something usable with the
mapping program at:

http://www.u.arizona.edu/~bjohnson/tprogs.html

Note: the Genie files are rough, there are a number of places where the
data must be cleaned up before importing it into various other usable
formats (such as Galactic). I printed out subsector maps of the Solomani
Rim and taped them together. A map that scale of the entire imperium
would have been huge!

Does this explain why lawyers bill by the hour?

TV also grossly mischaracterizes engineering. Instead of immmediately
reconfiguring the sensor array to zap the bad guys, we need to show the
creation of
specification documents, design reviews, the quality assurance process, and
so on. You certainly can\'t do this with the BEMs firing some sort of death
ray at you.

For the Traveller connection, consider how much software that a character,
or even a small team,
can produce within reasonable game constraints, say weeks to months. How
complex can it really get ? How good will his quality assurance process be?
Would you trust the functioning of your 100 ZCr ship to it, particularly if
you are the bank which owns the mortgage? Are there strict regulations
governing the adding/deleting/upgrading of ships\' software due to safety
concerns (f nothing else)?

My only problem is that I keep thinking: How would this have been handled in 
_Red Dwarf_?

Of course, _Red Dwarf_ is basically _The Odd Couple_ meets _Star Trek_.

"Jumpspace", Marc Miller, JTAS#24 pp. 34-38, mentions a "network of wiring"
that maintains the jump field around the ship. The same article discusses
lanthanum only as the material of which jump coils are constructed, not as
a hull grid.

William, what was the page reference in RSB? I hadn\'t noticed that
particular source of canonical information.

IIRC in MT from TL17 on jump drive use less and less fuel. I\'ve always 
assumed that they switch to AM for the drive, and thus as it gets more 
and more efficient the drive needs less and less fuel for the jump, 
until at TL20 odd all you\'re left with is that which is needed for the 
bubble. It\'s also possible that at TL17+ a better understanding of the 
whole jump-space/jump-drive thing is reached (typical Traveller - all 
the realy cool stuff is extra-imperial).

The Zhodani core expeditions also require a large-scale correspondence.

It would take an infinite 2d area to fill a 3d volume unless you have places
that aren\'t accessible in Jump space.  Assuming the 2d plane falls through
all the orbits of planets in a system, does that mean \'up\' off this plane
stops jump drive working?

Two possible problems:
1) What about the stars more than 2 subsectors \'up\' towards galactic north?
Are they accessible in Jump space?

2) This makes the distance to the galactic core much greater - again this
messes up the core expeditions.

There are an infinite number of solutions, but no solutions that don\'t
result in locations which are very close together in 3d being extremely
separated in 2d. 
</Anthony Jackson>

Yes, as I understand it you have a choice between consistent "medium
sized" differences or occasional discontinuities with very large
differences.  A thought occurs:  What about the Greater and Lesser
Rifts?  These could be discontinuities not in real space but in the
mapping between realspace and jump space.


<AJ>
well under .5/cubic parsec.  The problem here is that your \'ripple
pattern\' may go all the way out from the core, but it\'s only taking a 16
parsec disk out of the galaxy.  If you go beyond that (rather narrow)
disk, either jump drive becomes impossible, or you are suddenly on a who
_new_ jump-space, which would be many thousands of parsecs away by jump
routes (if we assume they meet at the core). 
</AJ>

Yes, I think this is an inescapable problem, unfortunately.  One could
posit a complex pattern whereby the ripples themselves ripple in the
orthogonal direction, but that\'s got its own difficulties.  I don\'t
personally have a problem with limiting the space that\'s accessible by
jump, though. 

<AJ>
Oh, another problem I just thought of.  Jump to the edge of a \'ripple\'. 
Take a week to cross (normal-space) into the next \'ripple\'.  Jump again,
to the other edge of that ripple\'.  With a jump-1 drive, every 2 weeks you
can move 32 parsecs.... (this also works for the problem above, letting
you jump thousands of parsecs in a couple weeks). 
</AJ>

Damn, hadn\'t thought of that.  One would have to postulate some fairly
small gaps between the ripples that were innaccessible to jump.  They
don\'t have to be huge, just big enough to make it faster to go "the long
way" by jump.  About .25 ly should do it. 

<AJ>
You can resolve both problems by having big chunks of space which can\'t be
jumped into, but this has its own weird problems.
</AJ>

Care to expand?  I\'m more willing to accept innacessible portions of real
space than a 2D universe.

<AJ>
\'real-space to jump-space\' mapping is going to wind up with the problem
that at real star densities you can fit the entire imperium in a box some
60 parsecs on a side, which suddenly means that there _are_ new frontiers,
if you\'re willing to take a fairly short normal-space hop. 
</AJ>

Unless those new areas are outside the area accessible by jump-space.  In
that case there would be little to recommend such areas.

No, I\'m thinking of a CT or MT source. I know that the tug in Supp 9 uses a
"Net" to haul cargo. The net is not essential except for jump. This
*IMPLIES* a grid of some kind, but is nowhere near explicit.

IMTU, there are several types of J-Drives, each with merits and flaws...
Standard Imperial (And everybody else by the time of the late 3I): Normal
book costs, performances, etc. Normal Drawbacks. Lanthanum Hull Grid,
Zucchai Crystals to initiate the jump proper, the J-Drive runs solely
during run-up, to pump near explosive-decompensation ammounts of energy
into the Z-crystals, which feed the grid. Note, I use MT...
Jn	0	1	2	3	4	5	6
Tjd	1%	2%	3%	4%	5%	6%	7%
Tjf	5%	10%	15%	20%	25%	30%	35%

Coil based: Major differences from SIJD are that the JDrive requires less
energy to initiate, but stays active throughout the jump. They take half
the energy (and thus half the time) to initiate a jump. (The coil
discharges the repellency field down to 1m fast... unless kept charged).
Also, J-Drive hits not only reduce max range, but increase misjump chance.
If drive damaged or fails or is turned off during jump, apply destroyed
mishap in 1d6x10 minutes unless jump exit occurs first.

Absolutely.  This is a good point.  I knew there was a low-end magnitude
filter, but I didn\'t know how much of an effect it would have.  It might be
useful to compare the Gleise near-Sol densities to the Hipparcos data.
Actually, if I get a better Traveller-esque fictional setting without the
extra M stars, this could work in my favor.  The ultimate goal is a good
gaming universe.

I\'m getting similar results, although I want to look at the J1 scenarios in
greater detail.

Exactly!  This is something I still need to work on.

See!  I knew somebody had to have tried this kind of thing before.  It
actually ended up being pretty easy to do, too.

Ouch.  I need to check for this.  Its not the missing stars that bother me
so much as the idea that star densities in MTU would vary dramatically due
to arbitrary Real World(tm) limits.  Hopefully, the filter that Les
mentioned will even out the Hipparcos catalog.  Perhaps this weekend I\'ll
write a destination average vs. distance from Sol query.

Well, people seem to be all over the map on jump adjustments.  I\'m reserving
judgement on tinkering with jump distances.

Hmm.  I haven\'t done the cluster/chain grouping numbers yet - that\'s a more
complex algorithm than the simple count statistics I\'m currently playing
with.  Ideally, what I\'d like to see for MTU would be lots of small J1
groupings that require J2 to break out of.  To my mind, the OTU is too
accessable as a whole via J1, but if there really aren\'t *any* Jump-1 mains,
that\'s far worse than too many.

Here is an anon FTP URL:
ftp://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/adc/archives/catalogs/1/1239/

I intially imported hip_main into Access 2000, but it seemed to be choking
on the table size.  A solveable problem, most likely, but since I also have
SQL Server 7.0 running on a network server, I just moved the data there.
Mucho better performance with tables this size.  FYI: the hip_main.dat file
is a 14 meg download.

I\'m willing to share my SQL source, but I want to make sure this is worth
pursuing further.  If I can generate a reasonable data set for gaming
purposes, I\'ll try to post some of the "how to" details on a web page or
something.

Galactic.  I intially derived the Equatorial numbers, then converted them to

I currently don\'t have half jump increments, but its not hard to do.
Perhaps for further granularity I could also generate some lightyear

put them up on a web page.  Let me refine these results a bit more.  : )

Microsoft SQL Server 7.0, but any SQL (structured query language) capable
database can easily do this kind of work.  Yes, its possible that I will try
to publish all the gory details via the web.  I get the impression there a
enough people intertested to make it worthwhile.  : )

Well, that\'s the rub right there.  A 3D star catalog involves a LOT of data.
Its certainly a problem I am thinking about.

Thanks for the feedback folks!  All I\'m doing right now is exploring the
problems and possibilities for a 3D Traveller game that meets my campaign
needs.  If I convince myself that this is \'doable\', I\'ll create a more
refined, formal database for gaming purposes.

Ahem. A recent reference - GT Alien Races 2: Aslan, K\'Kree and 
various c**p StarMaster escapees.
By David Thomas, Andy Slack and David Pulver

Line 1, p5, Chapter 1, The Aslan..... "The Aslan (who call themselves 
Fteirle)..."



CT Alien Module 1 also leaves the first contact by Turks open when on 
page 3 it says "The derivation of the word Aslan is unknown, but is 
sometimes credited to human explorers who first contacted the race."

It would take an infinite 2d area to fill a 3d volume unless you have
places that aren\'t accessible in Jump space.  Assuming the 2d plane falls
through all the orbits of planets in a system, does that mean \'up\' off
this plane stops jump drive working? 
</Mark Peace>

Sorry, I wasn\'t clear.  I don\'t mean that jump space is actually 2D, but
that it is a "thin sheet", about a parsec or two thick that runs through
normal space in a "crumpled" fashion.  Systems might conceivably lie on
the "edge" between two ripples, but this would be exceedingly rare, so one
can micro-jump throughout the same system without worrying about this.

<MP>
Two possible problems:
1) What about the stars more than 2 subsectors \'up\' towards galactic
north? Are they accessible in Jump space?
</MP>

This is a problem, and not one I see an easy solution to.  You can
increase the amplitude of the waves, but that just brings other problems.
If there are several "layers" of jump space, this has its own
difficulties.  But still, I\'m more wiling to take this sort of thing than
a flat universe.

<MP>
2) This makes the distance to the galactic core much greater - again this
messes up the core expeditions.
</MP>

True, but how far did the Zhodani get, anyway? My impression is that they
did not make it a significant fraction of the distance to the core, but I
may be mis-remembering.

Total Destinations at J3 or Less

Those Jump-6 numbers were pretty high, with an average of 20 destinations
per star.  J6 is pretty darn rare in the OTU though, with the balance of
even military craft at J3 or less.  High jump factors will offer huge
advantages in a 3D TU, but what are the Jump-3 totals like?  Again, the
first result column is the count of destinations available to a star at
Jump-3 or less.  The second column is the number of stars to which the
destination count applies.  The third column is the percent of the total
sample that the star count makes up.

Well this is looking much better.  75% of the sample has no more than 4
destinations at J3 or less, with an average of 4 destinations over the whole
sample.  This compares much more favorably with the OTU.
_____

Jump-1 Destinations

Now let\'s just look at the Jump-1 numbers exclusively:

Destinations Star Count  Percent
- ---- ---- ----
0            1            0.01
1            8547        85.93
2            1018        10.24
3            179          1.80
4            85           0.85
5            57           0.57
6            29           0.29
7            22           0.22
8            8            0.08

Notice, we only have one star that you can\'t go anywhere from at J1, but the
average number of destinations is only 1.  Also, exactly 8 stars with 8
destinations means they\'re all clustered together, right?  That could be
interesting.  Actually, these numbers make me question exactly how the
Hipparcos catalog lists binaries and multiples.  I thought they were broken
out into separate tables, and only the primaries are listed in hip_main.dat.
Can anyone please confirm/deny?
_____

Jump-2 Destinations

These are the numbers for Jump-2, exclusively (no J1 destinations counted):

Destinations Star Count  Percent
- ---- ---- ----
0            5618        56.49
1            2591        26.05
2            809          8.13
3            296          2.98
4            159          1.60
5            69           0.69
6            62           0.62
7            59           0.59
8            48           0.48
9            33           0.33
10           38           0.38
...
15           16           0.16
...
20           1            0.01
...
25           1            0.01

Youch!  Over half the sample lacks any J2 destination at all.  This knocks
the average down to 1.  Hmm.  This definitely needs more looking into - to
make sure its not a mistake, if nothing else.
_____

Jump-3 Destinations

These are the numbers for Jump-3, exclusively (no J1 or J2 destinations
counted):

Destinations Star Count  Percent
- ---- ---- ----
0            3395        34.13
1            2821        28.36
2            1545        15.53
3            744          7.48
4            372          3.74
5            245          2.46
6            168          1.69
7            105          1.06
8            74           0.74
9            70           0.70
10           72           0.72
...
15           38           0.38
...
20           9            0.09
...
25           3            0.03
26           3            0.03

This is better.  Still only an average of one Jump-3 destination overall.

Based on the responses I\'ve gotten, I\'ll continue to try and make sense of
these numbers.

dropped several major ideas and disagreed with him on several more, until I
eventually stopped recieveing emails from him, wheither because the project
died or I was just dropped was never explained.

Prior to that, however, I recommended a couple of freind to him as artists
(they did much of the art and layout for Basement Gmaes :Forge: Out of
Chaos). Rodger started to negotiate with them after seeing some art samples.
Eventually the negotiations broke down when my friends realized that he was
negotiating for TOTAL ownership of any art, solicited or blind submission,
includeing the samples he had already recieved, and that payment was to be
made ONLY upon the first publication of the art, no matter how long it might
sit in the files.

The bottom line was that he wanted them to do 100 + plus hours of solicited
work and whatever blind submissions they cared to send him, that would be
HIS upon reciept and that he wouldn\'t have to pay anything if/untill
publication. This with a track record of NEVER having published one thing
(new or purchased from DGP). Thier counter offer of a minimal payment on
reciept of solicited material and the balance due upon publication offended
him. Needless to say the deal fell through.

This was 1 or 2 years ago. To date Rodger (You know what goes here!) still
hasn\'t published anything. And has a number of outstanding debts to several
people for work done for DGP and solicited by himself anfter taking over
DGP.

Well, I\'m going for a DGP pen-and-ink look. I\'ve put up an example of my
first mostly-finished vehicle, a grav minibus. See:

and click on the "Ormatii" link at the bottom of the page. I\'ve also got a
very rough first attempt at a 3d modular cutter. I\'m still cutting my teeth

OK, I have been out for a while and (as I parsed my digests) figured this 
one would die quickly, however comma

There are many fine religious scholars out there approaching the bible from 
a number of angles. In my old department (Religion at the University of 
Michigan)a great deal of the Exodus story was being studied by a specialist 
in ancient Egyptian belief systems (looking for \'cross over\' during the 
Semitic residence in Egypt) and the Gospel of John was being studied by a 
Women\'s Studies doctoral candidate looking for evidence of the status of 
women in patriarchal cultures of the Second Temple aera and possible strides 
to improve their lot. The Chair of the Department was a prof of Archaeology 
and his assistant was a Comparitive Lit prof. And we (they and I) were 
managing the Anchor Bible Dictionary project, where each book of the bible 
was being studied by a specialist in that book, be they Christian, Jew, or 
Whatever. The Book of James (about 9 pages) is an 850 page volume.
So, the bible is probably the most studied work ever. To assume that 
everyone studying it is biased beyond objective reasoning fails the test of 
Occam\'s Razor.

ObTrav: A Scholar patron *really* wants a copy of the holy canon of an 
obscure world in an attempt to prove pre-Vilani interstellar contact. The 
characters arrive and learn that only someone who has undergone 30 days of 
complicated purification rituals (including dietary, behavior, and hygiene 
restrictions) can even touch the canon without serious backlash. And if you 
want to *buy* it!

A friend of mine who is an aerospace engineer with a major defense 
contractor said a fair amount of engineering work on nuclear missiles for 
subs was making them \'sailor-proof\' because guys who *knew* they contained a 
few pounds of glowing death would use inspection latches to open bottles, 
hide food next to safety switches, etc. He said the worst was a guy caught 
shorting wires to light a cigar!!!

When I was a warranty tech for computer hardware, Apple released a notice 
that hundreds of powerbooks had defective fasteners on the motherboards and 
they would shake loose; they included the fast way to see if it was the 
cause of a fault and fix it until the new motherboard came in. And all the 
techs took a secret glee in watching the faces of our customers as we took 
the recommended action - dropping that $5,000 sucker 3"-4" flat on a hard 
surface!

Yup. The "box" configuration.  It seemed like the best option.  I\'d use a

Several reasons. It\'s not that much money, for one thing, less than it
would cost me to pay a lawyer. Second, Joe and I had a verbal contract for
a lot of it, so proof would be tricky (although how to prove I wasn\'t paid
might be tricky anyway). Third, I\'m up here in Canada, he\'s in the US, and
that makes things even tricker. Finally, I\'m happier owning the works
myself and being able to resell them.

The fourth point helps the rest of you, because it means that some of the
DGP material may yet get reprinted.

Brilliant Lances isn\'t that tricky, once you figure it out. The rules are
just very poorly explained and organized: easily the worst GDW wrote in
that respect. When Shalom and I figured it out we were surprised how simple
it was.

As to the facings, they are important because your facing affects both what
weapons can bear and what systems get damaged when you are shot.

Personally, I prefer BL to BR (unless I have a large battel to play out).

Why not?  Because I don\'t believe that Roger owns the copyright to a lot of
the material in the books, unless I\'m the only author he didn\'t pay. (Which
may be possible, I suppose, as I did have a deferred payment agreement with
Joe Fugate.) While I don\'t mind copying the stuff that is legitimately DGP
material, I wouldn\'t want to copy stuff that belongs to someone else.


>For heaven\'s sake - come the New Year I resolve to find some time

In which case please don\'t copy any of the articles I wrote (except the
legal one copy for personal use).

That would be all the signed articles, and at least the grashfalt and cargo
container equipment sheets (I can\'t remember what else they published just
now, I\'ll have to go through my copies of the TD and MTJ for a complete
list).

The Sydkai, at least, is being reworked as a GT starship. I\'m starting with
the draft I sent Joe, and have updated it, as well as ignored the changes
that Joe made to the text.

Well, I did try to condense it ;) In order of cannones/votability:

Gunboat   GB-4206CF2-A40000-05000-0  Mcr 385.53std.
 all bear            2          4        Crew=12 TL=15
Fuel=96 Ep=48 Agility=6 Scoops n fplant  space left=77
Fills gunboat position on the Nolikian BR. Crew has
2 ton staterooms. The 77 tons left allows boat to be
configured for different roles as needed  i.e. SDB role
would have tons allocated to stores and a j-troop squad,
assault lander role would have tons allocated to 1-2
j-troop platoons (in couches) with assault capsules or
a grav tank.

Patrol boat PB-62469E2-000000-50204-0  Mcr 496.13std.
   all bear                     1  1  1   Crew=24 TL=15
Fuel=294 Ep=54 Agility=6 Scoops n fplant MJtroops=10
space left=24
Crew includes jtroops (14 crew+10Jtroops). Space left
allows for configuring (in this case, whether to include
some kind of vehicle, lander, or assault capsules for the
squad as well as stores for the ship). I went with 600tons
because 1. I wanted jump capability 2. I believed 6-g
was mandatory  3. I needed enough space for a Jtroop
squad with assault capsules and 4. in the event that 4518th
operated independently from the IN, having a PAW available
would be very useful.

Pcruiser PC-A2469G2-050000-80200-0    Mcr 1025.1 std.
  all bear               1         1  3      Crew=66 TL=15
Fuel=637 Ep=117 Agility=6 Scoops n fplant Mjtroops=34
KT 35type Pinnace=1 space left=32
Crew includes the 34 jtroops (32 navy+34jtroops). As above,
space left allows for configuring. The KT 35type Pinnace is
the 35 ton pinnace used on the Kinunir BC. While I decided
that the ship was somewhere in the 400-600 ton range, the
1500t vote got me to thinking about an annoyance I had
with Adv.1. There are not a lot of Kinunirs, yet there would
seem to be a need for a multi-role ship of that type. This
should be seen as an attempt to create a K2 ship with less
bells and whistles.

20000t doesnt work for me; ymmv. I havent decided on
ship names; maybe you guys can work that out ;) I would
not mind if you double checked the designs either.

A little bit more so.  The "jump range" in 2300AD was about 7.7 light-
years, and I found that a bit unsatisfactory.  With that range, the "arms"
are kind of thin, they tend to peter out at a certain distance from Sol,
and the path to some important nearby stars is very indirect.  Indeed, 
there are some good stars near Sol that are completely inaccessible
(61 Cygni and the Draconis-Cassiopeiae cluster, for instance).

Stretch the range out to 9 light-years and you get more direct access
to all the nearby stars, and the "arms" are thicker and more interconnected.
Better for the Traveller-like feel I was after.

Hull grids are mentioned in issue 24 of "The Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid
Society" in an article by MM,
Specifically it states:
"...Starship hull contain as an integral part of their structure a network
of wiring which maintains the jump field around the ship."

Incidentally the article also described jump coils. Starship required both
jump coils and the hull grid. At least they did when this was written.

It also brings to mind an old cartoon re Traveller ships, it may have been
Murphy\'s Rules which had all the Traveller ships rushing back to the nearest
starport and a caption along the lines of another imminent design rule
change.

Actually the United States was in a financial crises at the time as a result
of the United Nations taking the US to the international court at Hague and
having the country declared bankrupt over unpaid UN contributions.

Of course the liquidators had a few problems, but it was not until Turkey
purchased the White House and had it shipped piece by piece to Ankara that
the crises finally ended.

Well I prefer it and I have played every version of Traveller except Gurps,
(I do have a copy of this though) I liked the GDW house system, and indeed
the system is still in use, take a look at Dark Conspiracy 2nd Edition which
appears to use it.

In Perth at least it was T4 that virtually killed Traveller, the only
versions currently being played are TNE based.

You\'re wrong. *Trademarks* can be lost thru non-enforcement. But not
copyrights. Also, if the copyrights were properly registered *before*
the violation, the violator can be charges *punitive* damages, which
start at somethging like $100 per copy.

Among other things, if you happen to make enough copies that the *list*
price of all of them exceeds $1000, you are guilty of a *felony*.
Complete with large fine and prison term. That\'s due to a law passed a
few years back and aimed at folks pirating software. But as far as I
know it applies equally well to printed materials. 

So if you make too many copies, and Roger found out, you could wind up
facing *criminal* charges. 

Besides, you are overlooking an inmportant point. Like it or not, he
*does* own the copyright. So before doing anything too drastic, stop
and consider how you\'d feel if someone did that to *your* material.

I agree, although most of it went a hell of a lot more than just a few
metres, the Chatham Islands, which were covered  in a layer of ash 11cm
thick, are around 800km away.

That was the speed of just the "liquid flow", not the speed of the fragments
ejected into the atmosphere, in other words that was the speed of the stuff
still in contact with the ground !

The airborne stuff, including the superheated steam, exceeded the speed of
sound (i.e more than 1km/sec or some 3600 km/h )

I _think_ this was covered in the following reference, but as I no longer
have access to it, I can\'t confirm. It definitely has a pile of further info
on the largest eruption. ( the 181AD eruption was a _lot_ smaller )

Wilson, C.J.N., 1993, Stratigraphy, chronology, styles and dynamics of late
Quaternary eruptions from Taupo volcano New Zealand. Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.
London A343, 205-306.

Actually, anything that get\'s into the stratosphere can stay up there for a
very long time, even quite large bits of debris, due to the effects of the
air speed at that altitude, and the temperature inversion layers.

> It\'s the ash and similar tiny particles that count; figuring out the ratio
of ash

True, but it\'s also largely irrelvant, it\'s the amount of smaller particles
reaching the stratosphere that is importnat, not the overall amount of ash.

> and a direct comparison of material volumes isn\'t helpful.

It is helpful in that volcanoes are the only current evidence we have on the
effects of large amounts of ash in the stratosphere. In order to show that a
nuclear war is likley to cause a "nuclear winter", one has to show that it
is likely said nuclear war will inject _more_ ash into the stratosphere than
previous volcanic events.

Currently, the only direct evidence we have shows that in the case of
nuclear explosions only a very small amount of it ever gets into the
stratosphere, in fact in most of the atnospheric bursts carried out so far,
_no_ material other than steam reached the stratosphere.

While I agree there are a lot of variables, including the altitude of the
explosion, the nature of the ground, and the weather, there has yet to be
any real evidence that a nuclear war could create a "nuclear winter".

Cosmic scale events, such as asteroid impacts, have been shown to have
caused a "nuclear winter" effect, but they have much greater capacity for
injecting materiel into the stratosphere than nucleear weapons.

It\'s funny how Traveler is so representative of network television, killing
is fine on camera no matter how many or how gory, but sex has to be implied
or have those funny pixellated bits over it.

This, of course, explains all the problems with Traveller tech, it was
obviously designed by network executives not scientists.

Sorry, I have just seen a _serious_  article on the news anbout whether
_Hollywood_ has fulfilled it\'s promises, i.e, has Hollywood delivered all
the tech seen in 60\'s TV Shows ? Someone obviously thinks that\'s how
technolohgy is developed.

I can imagine it now :

"Sorry General, but Hollywood technology is thirty years ahead of military
technology, and we\'re not about to lose that edge, even if you _are_ being
invaded. It\'s your country at risk, not ours, the enemy wouldn\'t _dare_ to
try anything against us, our social engineering would destroy their entire
system of government in one box-office season."

While I am not a volcanologist, just a sedimentary geologist, what I suspect
is being referred to in the "liquid flow" is the "glowing cloud" of
suspended pyroclasic debris and hot gases. There is a French phrase for it
but "glowing cloud" is the literal translation.  There are density flows in
the deep ocean called tubidity flows that represent an analogous phenomenon.
The concept is fairly simple, a dense liquid suspended and flowing along a
solid surface within a less dense fluid.   In the case of volcanoes these
density flows are "glowing clouds" which represent a dense "gas" flowing
within the atmosphere down the slope of the volcano.   There is little or no
friction at the interfaces of the flow, especially at the leading edge.
Picture an "air hockey" puck and you can get an handle on the concept.
Regarding their velocity over the surface of the earth...    well I do not
have any examples I can cite but it is my understanding that they can be
quite rapid and utterly devastating.

The GLIESE data claims to contain all known stars within 25 parsecs of the
sun.  I\'ve plotted out the stellar density and it\'s constant upto 25 parsecs
and then drops off, so I\'d suggest only using the data within 25 parsecs.
(3405 of the 3804 stars in the data set I\'ve got are within this distance
anyway.)

Warning: The Gliese data lists binaries as separate stars so lots of stars
will appear to have other systems within Jump-1 range when it is only their
companion,

Ah!  I haven\'t read that yet, if ever.  But so far as I can tell,
"Fteirle" appears in DGP publications only prior to this, so shouldn\'t it
have been part of the "forbidden canon" for GURPS publication purposes?

No need for us to arise at dawn (your dawn or mine?
hehe), when I said, "just a game," <snip>
There are philosophy
degrees, and there is roleplaying. For me, at least, I
find "fun" does not involve confusing the two.
    Yes JUST A GAME, but we all play games in real life and our imagination. 
  RPGs form the link between the two as do all expressions of artistic 
endevour.  It is easy to pick on "the Marxist" (I just thought it was better 
to identify my sympathies so that those not interested could ignore the long 
treatise).  My objective is to highlight some of the deeper currents which 
run through contemporary society in the hope of advocating a more open 
gaming milieu.  As I have been actively playing Traveller since the days of 
CT and still find the open-endedness of that milieu to be invigourating.  
Cannon has to be taken lightly, to complement where the real fun is and that 
is in the act of playing itself.
    It would seem that many on the list are solely interested in collecting 
minute scraps of data and construct elabourate theories which will effect 
the whole milieu.  Yes, it is fun to uncover the "Secrets" which are buried 
within the text. For me it is it fun to analyze the text, ok?  And, you 
never know a synthesis out of these two tendencies may actually solve a 
"Secret".  Sorry that this was so long but as I said in the original it is 
amusing that some individuals who have not a complete handle on something 
will spout out and out nonsense composed of linking little bits of data.

For the last few years I\'ve been working as an administrative assistant in a

It is amazing to me that people who work in a clinical laboratory dealing
with all the permutations of the AIDS virus (San Francisco has always been
ground zero for new developments) and people who work with Dr. Prusiner, who
discovered the prion (cause of Mad Cow Disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob\'s Disease,

Grandpop made sure that he got all the kids and grandkids (he kept careful
count.)  Isolated installations survived, because soon after the last of
the Drayskyn died, Yaskodray pinched off his pocket universe.

The Droyne Warriors in TP were just that: Droyne.  (It would have more fun
if the stasis shells had collapsed and the players found themselves facing
a horde of H. erectus carrying disintegrators.. hmm.. may have to re-write
that for the next run..)

The show "Law & Order" handles this fairly well.. if you follow the dates
on the screen you see that the actual cases take weeks or months, we just
see the highlights.  The show is also a great source of plots.

*grin*  Unless you have my doctor.  He\'s so fed up with my body that unless
I can show him blood, in large amounts, he waits a week before ordering
anything.  Even then we\'ve discovered the universal cure: go see Dr.
Waltuch.  No matter what the complaint it clears up in the waiting room.

My point was that he _doesn\'t_ own the copyright to everything that DGP
published.

My work, for example (everything but Starship Operators Manual) was never
paid for. Joe and I had a contract, in which I would be paid in exchange
for the copyright. As I was never paid, DGP never got the copyright.

Do you actually have it filed in your name? If not, he could have 
filed for it and then he would until you challenged it. If it is 
in DGP\'s name, then it is his until you take it away from him. If he 
has, you aught to sue him for the rest of the copyrights as payment.

Well, this means there could be systems physically within the 3I (or any
other empire) that couldn\'t be reached by Jump.  STL ships from these
systems could arrive in the middle of the imperium without having to travel
through any imperial systems.  I\'m sure the 3I would have to send ships to
these systems etc.

This could all be very interesting but it dosn\'t really tie in with the OTU

dead or pinched off with Grandfather (or their own space). If any were out
and about, why wouldn\'t they have a little empire carved out for themselves?
I\'m sorry, but nothing the Imperial Navy has can deal with White Globes,
Disintegrators, Jump Projectors, Antimatter Missiles, and other toys...

Now in MTU, however, I\'ve got a group of six Droyne worlds that remember the
good \'ol days - that is, they never suffered the cultural slide back that
most Droyne suffered. They know the true history of the Droyne and such -
but without Grandfather or the Kiddies, they simply have little drive or
ability to maintain high technology - so they\'re only TL 13 (GTL 11) now.

I had a bunch of them, but I lost the files in a crash. Are they
collected somewhere? Perhaps Kenji keeps them somewhere... perhaps in a
bunker... in order to prepare for Y2K...

Well, not so long ago people were discussing the reliability of the 
US Postal Service. I\'m impressed - Don McKinney sent me two excellent 
condition Traveller products from his last auction on the 29th Nov, 
and they arrived on 2nd Dec - 4 days from the US to the UK seems good 
to me.

And BTW, thanks to Don - I\'m impressed with Dark Nebula!

I\'m not going into any damn bunker for Y2K!  I already missed some great
fun in Seattle this last week (meek, cautious, mossy rioters!) by moving
out to Puritanland.  Next public mayhem that happens, I expect to get my
damn front-row seat!  I\'m a Haaaahvad student, I *deserve* these things.

I don\'t have the designs any more, actually.  But never fear!  Some
clueless soul, obviously no reader of the TML, has sold me a copy of Fire,
Fusion, and Steel II!  Now I\'m redesigning all those favorites of
yesteryear -- the PMPP, the RoboReindeer, the TL-C Bong, the Foucault
Class Discursive Cruisers, the Lav Ship...

In fact, just while typing this email, I had an exceptionally sick thought
I\'m going to translate into Traveller hardware as soon as I get back to my
rooms.

I\'m having thought along these lines as well. My ISP is what I am using for
server space now, and they are a real ho-dunk operation. I use a Mac, and
they say they can\'t support CGI scripting unless I\'m using Win95 or NT. I
don\'t know if they know what they are talking about, but I\'m no better
informed myself. I have some forms and stuff I have been working on for
RPGs, and would like to get them up on my site. So I guess I should move it.

I find this *highly* suspect, given that said star is *Sol*. If it

No. I don\'t think so. Each of the 8 stars that are available as
destinations from 1 of those stars may have *fewer* (or more) stars
available as destinations.

It is a mistake. Since you aren\'t counting J-1 destinations you get
this sort of "artifact". You need to be searching for J-1 destinations,
J-2 *or less*, J-3 *or less*, etc. 

Another thing. Given the way Traveller maps things, you may hant to be
looking for "Less than J-1.5", "Less than J-2.5" etc.

Don\'t need to move, just point out to the little B*****ds that they DON\'T
know what they\'re talking about. The Scripts are stored and executed BY THE
SERVER. The results get retuned as a web-page OR a data file. If you can
put HTML up, you can write CGI scripts.

The wood-burning XBoat belongs in Space: 1889.  I think you should keep

I seem to vaguely recall reading somewhere that due to folks like
Roger, many writers and artists have a standard clause in their
contracts to the effect that if the work isn\'t published within some
period of time (2 years? 5 years?) it reverts to them.

I\'m not going into any damn bunker for Y2K!  I already missed some great
fun in Seattle this last week (meek, cautious, mossy rioters!) by moving
out to Puritanland.  Next public mayhem that happens, I expect to get my
damn front-row seat!  I\'m a Haaaahvad student, I *deserve* these things.

(Irony only on last sentence, s\'il vous plait).

I don\'t have the designs any more, actually.  But never fear!  Some
clueless soul, obviously no reader of the TML, has sold me a copy of Fire,
Fusion, and Steel II!  Now I\'m redesigning all those favorites of
yesteryear -- the PMPP, the RoboReindeer, the TL-C Bong, the Foucault
Class Discursive Cruisers, the Lav Ship...

In fact, just while typing this email, I had an exceptionally sick thought
I\'m going to translate into Traveller hardware as soon as I get back to my
rooms.

Finding reliable, stable, free web space is an ongoing / recurring problem
for many.  Providers start out bending over backward to please customers,
but they are bought or otherwise come to a point of changing policy, after
which they insist on pop-ups or banners or some such full of advertising.
Or the owner loses interest in providing the free services and abandons the
project altogether.

There is hope...

Downport.com was begun because of these very problems.  We were not certain
in the beginning (last March) that we would be able to do it right
ourselves, but we determined to try.  We started out with a small, paid
account with a large provider.  We have since upgraded to an account with
more space and features with a smaller provider who have proved quite
reliable and responsive.  The next step in the process will be to migrate to
in-house servers so that we can have unlimited space and usage, set up our
own user accounts, and offer mail, IRC and MUD servers.

The cost...

The biggest expense in this endeavor is time.  None of us have unlimited
amounts, certainly, and a labor of love like this can be allocated only so
much of it.  The monetary costs are not outrageous.  Some of the expenses
are recovered by having The Traveller Trader donate 10% of gross sales.  The
overage and hardware expenses are coming out-of-pocket so far.  We may try
to recover some of it later in the form of a set up fee for new accounts.
We\'d prefer to find a different way, but we do not want to place any ugly,
invasive advertising banners on the site.

The benefits...

The Big Picture (tm) goal is to have, for lack of a better metaphor, a big
Traveller Mall.  Though not actually tied together or interdependent, a
group of cooperating web sites can pool talent, eliminate some duplication
of effort, and provide a marginally organized and rich resource of Traveller
material.  They can flourish in a stable environment, not wasting time and
effort changing URLs every seven and two-thirds months.  And, finally, the
combined popularity of the "Mall" may provide an environment where a
Traveller microbusiness could profitably run and cover the expenses of the
entire community.

So far...

To date we have brought Freelance Traveller, HIWG, The Traveller Trader,
AM-V\'s design house, the Traveller Webring admin pages, portions of Rob
Eaglestone\'s material and our own considerable content together under the
Downport.com banner.  It has already proved fruitful.  We are excited to see
what the future holds.

Not really. But tech seen in Hollywood shows, especially ones set "just
a bit" in the future is a good reflection of what the average *person*
thinks future technology will be like. 

Also, keep in mind that every once in a while someone will sit down and
*think* about what would be the "best" way of doing something and
design the set or props of a show around their conclusions. The Bridge
set on the original Star Trek series got studied as a model for a
communications center because that sort of thought had gone into it. So
did the "diagnostic bed" in Sick Bay, complete with all the readouts.

I think you are working too hard.

What it sounds like it is saying is that if a minor route is "needed",
you should check and see if it is possible to get things there faster
by making the route a "stub" off of a feeder or x-boat route, or even
making a it a pair of stubs joining to said feeder or X-boat route.

Say a j1 to get to the "feeder" and another to get off of it.

Now consider that training for submariners is *designed* to weed out
"knob twiddlers", "button-pushers" and other sorts of folks who don\'t
know when to leave things alone. 

Yet they still have folks that try the above. I think my point can be
taken as proven. :-)

> Spacers are paranoid \'cuz out there Darwin can inflict collateral damage.

Oh, he can down here too. It\'s just harder. Read the Hornblower novels.
In one of them, Hornblower discovers a load of *bad* salt beef in the
supplies his ship is taking aboard. He has it condemned by the ship\'s
doctor and askks the supplies office what they want down, indicating
he\'ll gladly dump the beef over the side to make the barrels easier to
handle (being empty). When the man he\'s talking to basicly goes "No,
no! That\'s not necessary" Hornblower realizes that the SOB is planning
on passing it off on another ship, one that may not have time to check
it before they sail (and then wind up in the middle of nowhere with a
month less food than they thought they had). After all, the
quartmasters office won\'t get in trouble for *that* they can claim the
meat went bad *after* the ship sailed. 

Hornblower fixed the jerk though. He had a work party *burn* the word
CONDEMNED into both ends of the barrel and the sides. And too deeply to
be planed off. Not even the *greenest* captain in the Navy would accept
*those* barrels. :-)

Think of it this way. Imperial ships are clean because they have lots of
crew and troops on board. When not busy, they polish, they shine, they are
kept busy by officers.

The rebels stuff is dirty and beat up because they are undermanned and don\'t
have time to waste on spit and polish.

No, I seem to recall seeing it in another item - I want to say
that it was a T4 number, but I also seem to recall that it was a

of the Third Imperium, and I\'m not sure of the Fteirle-Human

My favourite is the slogan "It takes a hard man to make a tender chicken"
which became (in Spanish) "It takes a virile man to make a chicken
sexually excited".

American Express caused some laughs.  "Membership has its priviledges"
became "To be a member has its benefits" in spanish for the Mexican market.
Unfortunately, when they used the same spanish wording in some South
American countries, the word they used for "member" meant "the male member",
so their slogan became: "To be a penis has its benfits!"  Don\'t leave home
without it!

 The hullform I have now should work fine for the first one, though I was 
aiming for the second.  The long, flat wedge is a cursedly low volume per 
unit length config, so fitting it into one of the TNE/T4 configs is more than 
problematic...
 Can you provide a worksheet so I don\'t have to backwards engineer from the 
USP? Just component and tonnage is fine...

That is until the end of The Empire Strikes Back....the med frigate Luke
had his hand replacement on looked pretty spiffy to me! Figure word got
around that the Rebels blew up the Death Star, so they got a LOT of
recruits after that! And what about the Mon Calimari flagship in Return
of the Jedi? Same thing!

And did you hear the US Navy is considering getting rid of that

Interesting data, even if kinda skewed by Hipparcos sampling criteria.

If you\'re sharing, I\'d be interested in receiving a copy of your star list
with coordinates.  Are the stars named?  I seem to recall reading (on the
Starmap mailing list) that the Hipparcos data didn\'t include star names,
just catalogue numbers - and not the same numbers used in Gliese, IIRC.

Something to consider:  on top of the red dwarfs missing from the Hipparcos
data, there are probably lots of rogue brown dwarfs out there between the
stars, unobserved by current telescopes.  Some astronomers believe that
brown dwarfs make up a good portion of the "missing mass" of the universe.
They might outnumber red dwarfs by an order of magnitude.  Many of them
would be paired with companion stars, but some believe there will also be
large numbers of brown-dwarf singletons.

If you can jump to these dim infra-red stars (and why not?), then the
number of J-1 destinations for each system will increase dramatically.

[BTW: (shameless plug) There\'s a terrific hard-SF story, "Halo" by Karl
Schroeder, set on a frozen planet orbiting a brown dwarf; it\'s in _Northern
Suns: The New Anthology of Canadian Science Fiction_ (Tor hc, 1999), edited
by David Hartwell and --gosh-- me.]

I\'d love to use 3D star maps, but I don\'t have a laptop for running a
CHVIEW map during gameplay, and 3D maps on paper present too many practical
problems.  You can\'t cover a large area without the stars and labels
overlapping each other.  The \'deeper\' the map, the worse the problem
becomes; I doubt you could fit your entire 60-parsec Hipparcos list onto a
single map.  So a 3D map has to be limited to a relatively small region of
space (max 7 or 8 pc across?).  And say you have several 3D maps of
adjacent areas of space; figuring out routes between the maps becomes a
major headache.  It\'s a pain just to visualize the 3D relationships from a
2D map, let alone work out jump routes.

I wonder if a possible solution might not be a program that could generate
a separate map (preferably scalable, in postscript) for each and every
star?  Each map would show all stars within, say, 7 or 8 pc of the star,
with all Jump-6-or-less routes from that star delineated and distances
marked.  Or it could generate a distance table for each star, listing the
distances to its reachable neighbors.  This would save a lot of time
working out routes during game play.

Does this sound at all do-able?  If I were a programmer, I\'d try to write
it myself.

Thinking out loud,

Aargh! help! save me from the Bureaucratic Process!
must everything be discussed, debated, decide by
committee and quality assured? are there not things we
can just do? with the BEMs firing death rays at you,
you don\'t mess about with this rubbish, you just do
what needs to be done! it might stuff you up, but so
will convening the Quality Assurance Board Managers,
who will all be wasted by the BEM BFGs (along with
everybody else). In the spirit of the percussive
maintenance thread, and the "not breaking skills down
too much" thread, too much messing about with details
like this bogs everything down...

Anyhow, so what if the PCs screw up? Screw ups are
what make an adventure! If there is no risk of screw
ups, most of which are self-inflicted, then Traveller
really is "a game where you run around paying off your debts."

Of course! I think it\'s an excellent guide for GMs:

people will be just as dumb as we are now. Most
spacers will NOT have PhDs in Plasma Polarisation Warp
Engineering, or whatever.

Sometimes that exists, but it isn\'t really standard in the rpg game
industry -- I\'ve only ever seen it once, and that was when I wrote the
contract. Most game companies (for example, SJ Games) have standard
contracts that they don\'t like to change.  In addition, it sometimes _can_
take a while for a company to publish something, due to shifting
priorities. GURPS Book of the New Sun and
GURPS Space Atlas 4 are examples of books that were "sat on" for a couple
of years before they came out. The best thing to do is to get an advance
for the work, payable on submission of first draft.  This sort of
encourages the publisher to print it, since he has already put money into it.

No. I don\'t think so. Each of the 8 stars that are available as

I have a half-finished adventure set on that world lying around. Haven\'t
worked on it for a while. I should propably dig it out and finish it up.
In my version it is a hidden resort world that belonged to one of the
Kids. That\'s right. The whole system is hidden by an Ancient stealth
field. The only way to get there is to misjump inside the field.

>Eskayloyt, anyone? Nah, too large...<grin>
 
According to a post by Marc Miller on the TML several years ago, Eskaloyt
used to be in the Shionthy system and was rotated into a pocket universe 
by Grandfather (not the same PU as Grandfather\'s Universe).

Agreed, and that is how I am doing it, but it was specific in 
saying use jump 2 unless you can save a jump or more on a feeder 
and above or along an x-boat route. The question still remains 
whether the minor routes can go along a feeder or major route 
that has a jump 3 leg. As I said, I rather expect the answer 
to be that it can but want opinions on whether the minor routes 
can use the j-3 legs or not.

Thanks.

Nope. It\'s not Spanish for "no go". That would be "no va", and the accented

very popular urban legend, but its status as legend has been verified.

The Chevy Nova did fine in Spanish speaking markets.

they don\'t have much chrome but they do have LOTS of brass (door knobs,
pipes, plaques, control panels, etc., etc.) that needs to be polished.

Do keep in mind that the assumption that these stories make is absurd. Since
the dawn of the mass-market advertising campaign, multinational corporations
have relied heavily on local firms and expertise for advertising. They have
to, not just because of possible translation errors, but because it would be
too expensive not to.

Still, stories like these find a wide distribution in respectable

heard in a high-school history class to illustrate what happens when
cultures clash.

I\'m surprised that nobody\'s mentioned Coca-Cola and "bite the wax tadpole"

What I\'ve considered (for an area containing less than 100 stars) was
building a *model*. Make a based out of plastic or wood, drill holes at
the right spots and have the stars be beads on the end of carefully
measured lengths of piano wire. Glue the wires in place (and maybe add
labels attached to the wires, near the stars) and you\'ve got a *real*
3-D map. 

If you were crazy enough, you could add extra sections to expand it
horizontally. Expanding it vertically doesn\'t seem very practical.

Both of those sound like partial solutions. Just remember that you\'ll

Your right.., it is Sol.  I hadn\'t actually bothered to look at the Sol
destination results yet.  Here they are - if they\'re wrong, then I
definitely made a mistake with my cartesian coodinates:

J1dest      J2dest      J3dest      J4dest      J5dest      J6dest

Yep.  Just sloppy/wishful thinking in my part.  Still, the idea of a
discrete J1 cluster of 8 stars could be intestesting from a worldbuilder\'s
perspective.

Um...  <sarcasm deleted>  My intent was to show the \'J3 or less\' numbers
first, and then break that out into specific jump detail.  That was the
point.  The exclusive J1 & J3 numbers did not exhibit any such "artifact".
I still think its fishy given the plethora of J1 destinations.  It was my
gut feeling that either the J1 or J2 numbers had to be off, becuase they
don\'t make much sense combined..., and I now know why!

It turns out my J1 destination counts were royally screwed by a flaming f-up
on my part.  The algorithm that compiled the J1 destination counts neglected
to excluded the source star itself, inflating all the J1 counts by 1.  This
explains the ridiculous disparity between the J1 & J2 counts.  The numbers
for Sol did not reflect this error because I added those records with a
different query.  Thus the false uniqueness of Sol\'s lack of J1
destinations.  DOH.  Sigh.., a thousand lashes with a greasy wet noodle for
me!  : )  Sorry folks.

The bogus destination records are easily corrected (delete destinations
where source = destination).  Lo and behold, the corrected J1 numbers are
much more in line with the J2 counts.  I\'ll repost the result set in a
subsequent email.

This is a very good point.  I should have specifically pointed out one of my
assumptions in measuring jump factors was Jump-1 equals *exactly* one parsec
or less.  Thus, a displacement magnitude of 3.00000001 parsecs would yield a
jump requirement of J4.  This, again, points to a need for finer granularity
in my destination analysis.  This is exactly the sort of thing this test
database was created to vette.  Thanks.

star count makes up.

It looks to be a tough galaxy out there for those J1 merchants - this
(combined with the harsh J2 totals) is why fudging with the jump factors
seems to be a popular adjustment.  These are just gross counts though..,
what I really want to see are the numbers for J1 clusters/mains.  I\'ll try
to work on that later this week.

Don\'t forget, this is the same Navy that installed Win NT as the OS for
just about everything on one of its AEGIS cruisers (I forget which one).

Just imagine...

The Iranians have declared the Strait of Hormuz closed to ships not
flagged in Muslim countries.  To force the issue, USS AEGIS NT is
assigned to escort two Panamanian-flag oil tankers to Manama, Bahrain. 
The ESM det aboard AEGIS NT reports multiple SILKWORM anti-ship missile
seeker heads inbound, range 20 nautical miles and closing...

I dug my copy of MTJ4 out to check. The timeline does not go into 
detail, but when the Droashav invaded the Kirur system, the K\'Kree 
could not have been above TL 7. After defeating the Droashav on 
Kirur, the K\'Kree then attacked the main base on Kirrixur using TL 9 
equipment. Yes, I know page 48 says K\'Kree scientists were 
miraculously able to advance 2 tech levels in a mere 25 years, but 
remember this is in the *player information area*, and the paragraph 
above that one says "K\'Kree records are hazy at this point". Also 
note that the K\'Kree did not invent jump drive at this time.

The referee-only section mentions the Droashav were at least TL 9, 
with one exception; they did not have jump drive. This section also 
states they had bases on Kirur itself, which were overrun by the 
technologically inferior but numerically superior K\'Kree. Later the 
K\'Kree reach TL 9 themselves, with one exception; no jump drive.

So the situation is one where TL 9 aliens invade a lower tech planet 
and begin slaughtering its inhabitants.  But the natives win. The 
natives reach TL 9 and turn the tables on the invaders. Now I agree 
the book does not spell it out for you, but which do you think is 
more plausible:

A: The natives ignore all the grav craft, fusion reactors, and laser 
weapons lying around the aliens have been using to subjugate them and 
begin a crash research program. Starting from nothing, the previously 
technologically conservative natives are able to invent all the 
invaders\' technology, but not other technology at the same tech level 
which the invaders did not have.

B: The natives reverse-engineer the captured equipment.

The important point, which the player information does not mention, 
is that the K\'Kree didn\'t have to travel to their moon first. The 
Droashav had bases on Kirur with grav and fusion tech.

Easier item for useage... Generate the following table for each system

Systems (Random names, no real corelataions units in parsecs)
ID: Name	X	Y	Z
A: Pobis	6	8	2
B: Regnar	6	6	4
C: Dumquats	0	9	4
D: Delquats	0	7	3
E: Tellis	1	3	0
F: Bogus	2	1	5

Distance rounded nearest parsec.
Table A-E:B-F
	F	E	D	C	B
A	9	7	6	6	3
B	6	7	6	7
C	8	7	2
D	7	5
E	5


What you do is create the tables so that you have the next page (assuming
same sizes) gover another table. Realistically, such tables typically can
be put about 20 entries per side on A4/Letter portrait, more with smaller
point sizes.
A sample of the index assuming the above table is max size...
A-E:G-K, A-E:L-P, F-J:G-K, F-J:L-P, K-O:L-P

How you use the index is to look up the lower ID\'d point, then, within it\'s
range, the higher ID\'d point, regaurdless of origin or destination. I\'ve
not done this recently, but I once did this for the 2300 NSL, and it was
rounded to nearest 0.1LY. It can be done in Excell or nearly any other
spreadsheet which can hold the whole of the dataset. Mind you, you wind up
entering the data twice... once across and once down. A fairly simple C
program can do it, too.

These type tables are used in StarWars RPG... but they do not correlate
directly due to background assumptions there...

You may want to set your data display to autobold the results.
<pipedream>
Hmm... Sounds like time to do an HTML generator in C.... I don\'t have the
time to write and Debug.... but it would be a good project. You could use
the following struct
Struct SystemRecord
{	int ID;
	float X;
	float Y;
	float Z;
	int *nextPtr;
	int *prevPtr;
};
and just set your break points in iterative runs...
It does mean also creating an index by name, and an index by ID number.
Have the program generate the HTML tables as separate pages each as one
file out, then the index by name as a separate file, and the TOC page as a
third.
</pipedream>

While it doesn\'t actually map, it does give you a compressed but full
access listing. If done right, the index itself is a similar table....
	L-P	G-K	B-F
A-E	FNo3	FNo2	FNo1
F-J	FNo5	FNo4
K-O	FNo6

Dom was right - it was coal dust, not combustion gases that were the problem 
at Sellafield.  I remember an article in New Scientist on the subject.  The 
problem was due to coal dust settling on surfaces near the detectors, which 
gave off enough radiation to trigger the sensors.

The extra radioactive CO2 in air would never be concentrated enough to set 
off the sensors due to plume dispersion from the flue gas stacks.

(which stretches the idea a bit) but means that out of the main plane
of the galactic ecliptic stars get more distant - each layer is about
half as full as the next one nearer the ecliptic. With less than
jump-3, only the main ecliptic plane is worth mapping since the others
are pretty much un-navigable.

That\'s my notion anyway - and it lets me get on with just playing the
game.

<Mark Peace>
It would take an infinite 2d area to fill a 3d volume unless you have
places that aren\'t accessible in Jump space.  Assuming the 2d plane
falls
through all the orbits of planets in a system, does that mean \'up\' off
this plane stops jump drive working?
</Mark Peace>

Sorry, I wasn\'t clear.  I don\'t mean that jump space is actually 2D,
but
that it is a "thin sheet", about a parsec or two thick that runs
through
normal space in a "crumpled" fashion.  Systems might conceivably lie
on
the "edge" between two ripples, but this would be exceedingly rare, so
one
can micro-jump throughout the same system without worrying about this.

<MP>
Two possible problems:
1) What about the stars more than 2 subsectors \'up\' towards galactic
north? Are they accessible in Jump space?
</MP>

This is a problem, and not one I see an easy solution to.  You can
increase the amplitude of the waves, but that just brings other
problems.
If there are several "layers" of jump space, this has its own
difficulties.  But still, I\'m more wiling to take this sort of thing
than
a flat universe.

<MP>
2) This makes the distance to the galactic core much greater - again
this
messes up the core expeditions.
</MP>

True, but how far did the Zhodani get, anyway? My impression is that
they
did not make it a significant fraction of the distance to the core,
but I
may be mis-remembering.

Ahhh...the commonsense idiocy of the well-educated. In a place I used to
work for I was on the \'fire brigade\'. Originally, we were the folks who
were going to strap on Scott packs and go into labs looking for people
overcome by fumes. That is, until the foundations lawyers screamed "You\'re
polanning on doing WHATTTT?????!!!!!"

After that our job was to make sure our areas were clear of people in the
event of a fire alarm.

One morning, the fire alarm goes off...unexpectedly, I might add. I
trundle through our three labs anmd the common area, and there is one of
our PhD\'s, calmly making coffee. Why? So it would be ready when they came
back in.

Our lab, btw, was next to the very large room containing, on the average,
several hundred gallon bottles of solvents.

<sigh>

In another incident, here at the UA, roofers accidentally caught some wood
framework in a ventilation duct on fire. (They couldn\'t see it, they were
applying the heat to the outside, the wood was on the inside.)

I smelt smoke on the third floor, I went up to the fourth floor to
investigate, and discovered in one lab, people, coughing, eyes watering,
looking at the smoke pouring out of the vent in the ceiling, and wondering
what they should do.

Later during that delightful incident, we were standing outside the
building. There are fire trucks and firemen _everywhere_, the alarms and
strobe lights in the building are still going, and a couple of other grad
students walk past everyone, LOOK AT US, and walk up the stairs to the
entrance and walk in!

Not if they\'re running IIS, and to them CGI ==\'Front Page Extensions\'.
Then, of course, under the Microsoft World Domination Secret Memo, nothing
but Win systems are allowed to play.

Never underestimate the ignorance of NT Weenies. At this point, I\'m kinda
surprised that they even allowed him to connect with a Mac, since they
don\'t work with the Internet and all that...

(apologies and sympathies to all the real NT Weenies on the list, I\'ve
just run into too many of the really ignorant kind)

Anyway, now for the interesting bit:

This is an analysis of the number of Jump-1 (1 parsec) mains and the number
of stars on each.  In this case I\'ve deleted binary companions closer than
0.01 parsecs from the data.  Any more than that and I reckon Jump drive
would be used and I\'d treat them as separate systems.  This leaves 2960
systems within 25 parsecs of Earth.

           16           1

This is pretty poor for Jump-1.

Now how about 1.5 parsecs for Jump-1?

This is much better. Approx 1/3 of the systems don\'t have any jump-1
neighbours, but there are still some significant mains.

While doing "barracks maintenence" for the hundreth time that week, some
fellow privates and I were complaining about the time spent cleaning things
vs. the tine spent in infantry training.  "Well," said one guy
thoughtfully, "when the Soviets overrun West Germany we may not put up much
of a fight, but we\'ll leave them a nice well waxed and polished country!"

This is not true. You can make one-to-one mappings between 2D and 3D 
space without gaps or overlap. There was a big post about this a few 
months ago.

You can do that, but it isn\'t necessary. You can declare that jump 
space really is 2D, if you can accept jump distances and directions 
don\'t correspond to real 3D distances and directions. Note that canon 
says they do.

If you are going to say that jump space is a "thin sheet", you don\'t 
need to come up with any weird mapping or crumpling. Just declare 
that only systems near a flat plane are accessible by jump. The 
distances and directions in jump space are exactly the same as those 
in real space, only there are a lot of real space systems that aren\'t 
accessible by jump.

It wasn\'t the slogans that they used, it was the characters that made up the
name itself. In the 20s when Coca Cola was entering the market in China,
they had to sift through many possible character combinations to find the
right one to register as a trademark. They were trying to find a relatively
"neutral" combination, which was difficult, as the only character for "la"
translated into wax. However, Coke was a big hit while they were looking for
the right combinations, and local store owners made their own signs to
indicate that they had the soft drink. These translated into things like
"bite the wax tadpole" and other nonsense phrases.

It\'s important not to underestimate the intelligence of the Chinese here.
They understood these signs to read, phonetically, Coca Cola.

In the late 20s, Coke registered a specific set of characters as their
trademark. These characters can be translated, when together, as something
along the lines of "brings joy to your mouth". The folks at Coke are quite
proud of this fact, actually.

That\'s "robotic body" in GURPS Traveller, I think.

For a demonstration of the effect or lack of it of Y2K on a military force
at war, keep your eyes peeled on Russia.  Good chance their
counter-insurgency/police action won\'t be over by 2000...

Incidentally, I\'ve read that the Russian army force their is using a lot of
"kontract" soldiers -- volunteers drawn from ordinary units (not _quite_
mercs, exactly, as they are fighting for their own government) who are
offered up to 1000% higher pay in exchange for serving in the campaign.
Almost sounds like a Roman "donative" but on an individual rather than
military level.  ObTrav, has that occured in the Imperium or neighbors?
Sounds like something that might be seen during the Rebellion.

There are other reasons to change a name, though.  Remember, the story makes
the assumption that Spanish speaking people cannot differentiate between
Nova, which is actually a word in the Spanish language, and "no va", which
is a phrase that looks and sounds as different as is possible for these two
syllables.

The tale also has an oft repeated second part, which is the "fact" that the
Nova\'s name was changed to the Caribe in Spanish speaking markets. This has
been reported in marketing trade journals. The truth is that the Caribe was
made by Volkswagen.

Imagine the situation in reverse. In America, the is a furniture chain
called Seaman\'s Furniture. Nobody thinks that they sell furniture made by,
or for, sailors. Nobody thinks that Sony\'s name means "sew knee" or anything
of the sort, nor that one of their hottest selling products, the
Playstation, is a cable channel for dramatic presentations.

You haven\'t found those numbers because they\'re not there.  Yes, I found
*another* inflation error in my J1 calculations!  Double-DOH.  I apologize
to everyone following this thread for my bogus reports.  One\'s ego is
bruised.  : \\

I have rebuilt my destination table overnight, increasing the sample data to
all stars within 100 parsecs of Sol (23,073 stars).  I have some tests I
want to run against the new data before I make the mistake of posting any
more invalid reports.  The expanded and corrected table indicates that 90%
of the sample lacks *any* J1 destinations.  The maximum number of J1
destinations in the sample is 7.

  Sure. But a _real_ Spofulam would have realized the advantages of using

I\'m in need of technical advice. I\'m attempting to break down and
defining both
current and future communications technologies, including those that may
be
purely science fiction which might work well within the Traveller
setting.
The Communications skill within Traveller is, atleast for me, too broad,
too encompassing.
If one were to break down the communications technology discipline into
separate technical
areas of expertise or subspecialities what would be.

Looking through literature that I have available these technologies and
terminologies
keep showing up (I know basically what they are but I am unsure as to
exactly where they fit):

POTS, Satellite, Laser/Maser, Infrared, Microwave Radio, Copper Cable,
Wireless (Cellular),
Lightwave (Fiber Optics, SONET, FDDI), VHF/UHF, ELF, AM/FM, TV/Video

Government code \'M\' is a \'Tribal Government\' if using TNE, or one of the

The UWP appears in a TNE sector data file.
Maybe the answer can be found in the Star Vikings sourcebook.

You are mistaken. If the 2D area is infinitely thin (definition of 2D),
it would take an infinite area to fill a 3D space folded.

However, if you assume that the 2D plane has a certain thickness (>0),
then it can fill the 3D space.

I know I haven\'t looked at 8+ Digests and I\'m sure that someone else would
have been mentioned this, but as an Aussie growing up with our then one and
only Government TV channel, who can forget the visual splendor of that
infamous generic sci-fi location, the BBC quarry. Man I must have seen that
in twenty odd shows, Dr Who (every second episode it seemed) and Blake\'s
Seven being the prime contenders.

Indeed shown so much so that a good many of us could probably do up a map of
the entire area. I especially loved it when in the show the quarry wasn\'t an
alien planet but rather . . . a quarry! -  combined a crawling hand lurching
across the rubble. 

Ah the delights of a low budget. I especially enjoyed it when they needed to
shoot some machinery in the background and went into the BBC\'s basement
plant rooms (or the roof with London still in shot!). I wonder if Red Dwarf
pays homage to this (though they do sometimes paint the pipes et al red).

Off the top of my head, you\'re missing "primitive" communications
technologies which you may or may not wish to consider:

runners and messengers

homing pigeon networks:

These networks were an extremely common method for long distance
communication up until the introduction of the telegraph. However, pigeons
were still used in a military capacity after the invention of the telegraph.

Visual forms of communication:

Fire and smoke signals (the torch telegraph, etc)
Heliography (reflection of the rays of the sun [or moon] to signal)
Flags, kites and semaphore
Optical telegraphy

Aural forms of communication:
Stentors (shouters, wailers, etc. have been arranged in relay fashion)
Drums

There are many, many others. These are just off the top of my head.

Good thinking, but what about destination binaries? If you are at star A,
and stars B and C are within .1 parsecs of each other, won\'t your system
consider both to be valid destinations? And they could be a binary (or
trinary, given a star D.) Only way I see around it is to go through and
cluster all stars within .1 parsec and treat them as singular destinations.
Sounds like a heck of a lot of work.

On the other hand, First In seems to imply that companion stars can have
their own planetary systems. Depending on the orbital position of the main
worlds around either star, a single jump exit point may be equally
attractive to visit either world. but on other occassions you will need a
separate exit point for each world.

Just thinking, I wish you success in your endeavor. And keep posting, this
is very interesting.

He is not mistaken.

The number of points in a three dimensional space is of the same order
as the number of points in a two dimensional space and the same order
as the number of transendental numbers (which is the number of points
in a straight line).

Unless space is quantised, when the order is reduced to the same as the
number of integers (I think)

What was also proved is that this fact is unhelpful since it breaks
a key concept in canon - namely that there is a correspondance of
jump number and coordinates with actual distance and direction in
normal space.

The famous "Smart Ship Program" that was going to reduce crew and

It was the USS Yorktown. In September of 1997, while the ship was at sea,
someone entered a zero in the wrong field. The server ended up suffering a
buffer overflow and then crashed, shutting down the whole network. This
killed the ship\'s engines, leaving the ship dead in the water for two hours.

We have problems with our fire alarm going off where I work.  Either
the alarms are overly sensitive or some of our less studious
students enjoy getting out of class. Guess which it is? <g>

Anyway, I have to clear the computer labs upstairs when the alarms
go off.  "But I have to get this saved!"  "Just wait until the
printer stops." "If I smell smoke I\'ll leave." <g>

During the drills (and false alarms) students collect outside.
Those that weren\'t around when alarms went off, though, go strolling
through the building to get from next one over.  It *is* a shortcut,
of course.  Oh, and the alarm downstairs has started to go "buzz,
clunk, buzz, clunk."  You can\'t hear it inside the classrooms, so
students from upstairs go out on the alarms and those downstairs
stare at us though the windows...probably wondering what\'s going on.

Like Captain O\'Brien and the recent drill he called?  We had a naked

a Vacc Suit.  Say, isn\'t there a "Protection from harm while naked"
advantage in GURPS.  Maybe I should charge Cory some points, huh,
what do you think?  <g>

Nah, I\'m more of a cynic. <g>

Actually, Alex I have a question.  Just how do you rate a character
with all your specific skills?  You must allow *many* more levels
per year than the published versions or have very liberal defaults.
Otherwise you\'d end up with characters that can only work a VHF/UHF
Radio, repair a specific brand of gravitic module, and fire only
Luger 9mm pistols...and that could be very limiting. <g>

Back when I was a security guard, I worked at one of the 10,000 small chip
fab plants here in Silly Valley.  One evening, I smelled a *strong* acrid
odor coming from the locked fab floor.  (Geniuses who owned the place
decided the security didn\'t need a key.. )

Assuming the worst, I hit the alarm and start clearing the building.  By
this time there is a visible haze in the air.  I get to one office, where
this woman is sitting talking on the phone.  "Ma\'am, we have to evacuate
the building."

Icy stare.  "I\'m on the phone with *Europe.*

All this while alarms blare, fire engines are pulling up.. dogs and cats,
living in sin.

I reach over her desk and hang up.  "It\'ll be there tomorrow.  This
building I\'m not so sure about.  Are we going to walk, or be dragged out?"

Needless to say they fired me soon after.  It wasn\'t a fire, just our AC
pulling in fumes from an idling train nearby.

Perhaps K\'Kree science was ahead of their culture.  Many societies have
trouble embracing advances in technology.  If new breakthroughs were sitting
on a shelf or restricted to lab testing because their populace was resistant
to change then a sudden, necessary change in attitude brought about by
Contact would suddenly change the paradigm.  Experimental technology could
be quickly implemented and a new focus on the subject could concentrate
efforts to make the next breakthrough.  Sounds like a one-time thing, not
sustainable by any stretch.

Yes, this is a problem for many of us speaking alpabetical languages.  Many
cultures in the past (and, indeed, present) have used ideograms etc, and had
little problem distinguishing between a sensible, local, phrase, and an
imported loan word or personal name rendered phonetically. Just look at
heiroglyphics, no ancient egyptian really though Ramesses name meant Sun -
Water - Wheat Sheaf - Wheat Sheaf (or whatever...  it\'s late - I\'m drunk -
and I don\'t have the books to hand.... <g>).

	My opinion is if you are dealing with people this clueless, it\'s time
to move on. There is absolutely no reason why you should be trying to
host your website through an ISP who gives you bad information or won\'t
support the simplest operations. 

	I like my ISP ( http://www.together.net ), but since their in Vermont,
they may not be proper for you.

Doing so across a 2 TL gap is damn near miraculous!

I expect that they captured a lot of the enemy and "persuaded" them to
help.

Consider that the more likely option is just stuffing him into a
"rescue ball" and leaving him there. Rescue balls have large
transparent areas so that rescuers can tell if there\'s anybody inside,
and if they need help. 

By Traveller TLs they\'ll likely be made of plastics that won\'t pass UV
and the like, letting you make them almost *totally* transparent.

So until the end of the drill, you\'ll have "naked guy under glass" on
display. :-)

Heck, my ISP (Uswest.com, I got them solely because they are the only
local ISP I can pay easily, long story) supports Macs as well as PCs.
But they only support Windows on the PC side. I wanted to set up OS/2.
And their phone support is worthless. You hit a menu like this:

1. using Win95/98
2. using Win 3.1
3. Using Win NT
4. Using Mac

and that\'s *it*. No "other".  

I finally chose Win 3.1 (I think) and had to try to get across the idea
that I was setting up something *else*, and that *all* I needed was the
IP address of the DNS! *That* took awhile. Especially since I said
"Domain Name Server" which apparently the CS rep didn\'t know meant
"DNS". <sigh>

Yes, but the methods for doing so result in a *discontinuous* mapping.
You are declaring a 1-1 correspondence between *points* in the 2 "maps"
according to a ruule. But that rule doesn\'t preserve *adjacency*. 

It\'s *possible*, yes. But the resulting map isd not *practical*.

He said "map", not "fill". The concepts are not the same in
mathematics. 

You can declare a "rule" such that any identifiable point in 3d space
maps to a *unique* point in 2d space. But doing so causes adjacent 3d
points to be non-adjacent on the 2d map. But there\'s still a one-to-one
correspondence between points in 3d space and points in 2d space. That
satifisies the conditions of "being a map" *mathematically*.

You\'ll be pleased to know that one of the crew who didn\'t have his
suit with him..this was a drill on the tarmac..did precisely that.
He jumpped into a rescue ball and rolled it down the corridor toward
the airlock.  That blocked our "naked guy" from escaping back down
the corridor allowing him to be "saved" by being stuffed into a
suit.  Bruce, you want to tell \'em *why* you called the drill?  <g>

"Near" binaries have the stars within a few AU of each other, for
example, as I recall from an old Asimov science essay, if the Sol
system was a binary similar to Alpha Centauri A&B, the second star
would be in the orbit of Uranus(?). It\'d be *very* bright in the night
sky, but wouldn\'t appreciably affect the seasons. 

You *could* chose to come out of jump halfway between the stars, but
more likely you\'d come out near the *planet* you intended to visit. 

The *third* star in the Alpha Centauri system is Alpha Cenauri C,
better known as "Proxima Centauri" because it\'s so close to our system.
It\'s about half a light year (1/6 to 1/7 of a parsec) from the A/B
pair. Say around 30-35 *thousand* AU. 

Far companions are legitimate destinations as far as *I* am concerned.

Much simpler to geneer beetles. Specifically, go for a version of the
bombardier beetle that has a *much* harder/denser shell, and that
produces nitric acid and hydrazine in seperate storage sacs (hey, the
*real* ones produce something like 60-80% *hydrogen peroxide* in sacs,
given that, the other isn\'t really all that much harder). 

On impact the beetle will rupture the sacs, resulting in a nice
fireball effect. And yyoui can also airdrop the critters or just leave
themn laying around. When sufficiently annoyed, they\'ll squirt the sac
contents which upon reacting should have an effect similar to a *small*
grenade or incendiary. 

Stomping on one while wearing combat boots could cost you your foot.
but the odds are good that the *beetle* will survive. :-)

And the reaction from the blast should send the beetle flying at bullet
velocities. Thus the reinforced shell. If it hits a tree, it\'ll take a
while to dig itself out. If it hits a soft tisuue body (fruit, animal,
whatever) it can just eat it\'s way out. 

I expect it\'ll take them several days to recharge. Nice little "area
interdiction" critter.

For extra points make them fond of "organic wastes", but not very happy
about having fresh deposits dumped on them. Exploding slit trenches
anyone?

Plain Old Telephone Service. Either analog with a 300-3000 HZ
bandwidth, or digital, with a 64kbps channel carrying ??-4000 Hz audio
digitized at a sampling rate I\'d have to look up. 

> Satellite 

Can refer to orbiting communications relays *or* it can refer to
equipment packages well seperated from the phone exchange (Central
Office) that carry out many of the functions of the switching gear. 

As an example, a lot of small towns are non serviced by "satellite"
mini-switches. These handle the switching for calls inside the town
without needing to relay anything back to the central switch, but calls
leaving town go to the central switch and are passed on (possibly to
another "satellite" switch in the next town over). This prevents having
to dedicate an entire 10,000 numbers to a town that is unlikely to ever
have *1000* numbers in use, and avoids having to run cables for *every*
line (or a high speed trunk line) between the twon and the switch.
Instead, the trunk only needs to be able to handle the maximum number
of calls entering/leaving the town at once. 

Think of it as a sort of glofified PBX.

Here you have a bunch of communication "technologies" (delivery
systems, aka "hardware") mixed in with a bunch of communications
*protocols* (aka software/firmware). 

Laser, maser, IR, Microwave, copper cable, fiber optics are all ways of
moving a signal from point A to point B. "Point to Point Link technologies"

Cellular is a multi-point technology. 

ELF/HF/VHF/UHF are all "band designators" for radio transmission.

AM/FM/PM are modulation types, though to most folks AM refers to
"commercial broadcast radio" (In the US, in the 560 to 1600 kHz range),
and FM refers to "commercial broadcast radio" (in the US in the 88 to
108 MHz range).

TV is usually a broadcast commercial service in the VHF/UHF bands,
using 5 MHz bandwidth channels to carry visual and audio info. NTSC/PAL
and SECAM are the (currently) most popular "protocols" for encoding the
visual signals in TV. CCTV is "closed circuit TV"

I could go on, but the basic point is that you need to seperate the
*media* (what is "physically" carrying the signal), the protocol (how
the signal is "encoded" onto the media, and the *content* (what sort of
signal is being sent). 

Content is fairly simple. "text", sound, image. Morse code and teletype
are both simple "text". Fax is the simplest "image", and telephone is
about as simple as you can make "sound".

Media are fairly simple too. 
1. wire/cable
   a. copper wire
   b. optical fiber
2. EM signal
   a. Radio (ELF thru microwave)
   b. Light
   c. Gamma/X-ray?
3. other 
   a. sound pulses thru water
   b. meson beam pulses
   c. modulating gravity?
   d. ????

Protocols are just ways of getting content encoded appropriately for
media. And they can actually be pretty much *ignored* from the point of
view of both players and refs. The only time they might affect play is
if you had a situation where the ref *chose* to have the players run
into incompatible equipment. In which case either there had better be a
place where they can buy a protocol converter (like the ones you can by
so you can use a PAL VCR to display a PAL tape on an NTSC TV) or they\'d
better be willing to wait a *long* time while their electronics whiz
tries to get the specs on both protocols and *build* a converter. Which
should take weeks to months.

These are all "media" (ie "what is being used as a medium of
communication").

.1 parsec is ~20,000 AU. Making it a distance properly covered by jump.
Far companions (such as Proxima Centauri) deserve their own entry. :-)

I\'d be tempted to take it all the way down to .001. That\'s 200 AU
(well, 203, but why quibble).

Proxima Centauri is most likely not a companion to Alpha Centauri A&B
but a star travelling through the area and are this time close to 
the binarie star. It is phenomena like this that is thought to be
the force behind ejection of material from the Oort cloud, the 
source of the long period comets.

That sounds like something from an art exhibit (no doubt funded by the
NEA).  Instead of "Still Life With Woodpecker" (as in the Tom Robbins
novel), you have "Agitated Life With...."

Oh, yeah.  This is a family list.  Forget I said anything....

My input:

A communiucation system has to solve a few general problems including:

1. How are signals created, sent,and received
3. How management functions, like how point-to-point links are managed =
and how end-to-end links are managed

Part 1 is where the sci-fi stuff comes in. Meson beams, etc. You can =
basically send information by changing either the phase, frequency, or =
amplitude of a signal. The details of how this is done varies a lot from =
technology to technology, but the very same mathematics which governs =
one governs them all. If you understand the basics of electromagnetics, =
quantum mechanics (the Fourier analysis is rolled into this), =
statistics, etc, all of these technologies are very similar. So if you =
understand the workings of a TL9 *whatever* you can probably pick up the =
workings of a TL12 *whatever else* system without too much difficulty. =
Math is math, and Fourier Analysis is Fourier Analysis.

Part 2 are really part of the protocols used. The technology here is =

BTW, what is "phase modulation" (I assume that\'s what "PM" stands for),
and how does it work?  I understand amplitude and frequency modulation
(comes from having a SIGINTer as a roommate a few years back), but phase
modulation just doesn\'t ring any bells with me.

Sure there are, and legal procedures are not one of the things you\'re
going to do in response to BEM BFG fire.  Some things you do on a very
short time fuse, and some things you take some time to think about and
plan, and even engage in peer review or something similar.  That\'s true
both in real life (tm) and RPGs.  

A good example of doing quality assurance and drafting procedures in a
time-critical situation was shown in Apollo 13, when the ground people
had to make a rectangular air filter fit into a round filter slot and
then tell the astronauts what they did and how they did it.  I remember
the chief NASA engineer coming into the engineers\' meeting with a bunch
of gear and dropping it on the table and then saying, "OK, we have to
make this fit into this using only that in __ hours."  They actually
typed up a procedure and dictated it to the astronauts.

My, my you\'re well supported. The best (in other ways) ISP only

only support win and the Mac. Mind you at least my ISP has the DNS Ip

Innarestin\'.   Kurtis:  I *really* want to know which star this is that
appears at the bottom:   25 neighboring stars within a mere parsec radius!
Is there any way you can tell me it\'s name and/or Gliese catalogue number?
(I don\'t have the Hipparcos data.)

An artifact?  A statistical blip?  Or is it just situated in a particularly
dense region?  Does it also have a high number of J-2 destinations, etc?

Wonder what their night sky looks like...

And it occurs to me that if Sol really *is* unusual for having no other
stars within 1pc, maybe this explains why we haven\'t seen any aliens
dropping by recently?  Our neighbors are limited to Jump 1 and we\'re just
too far off the mains to bother with!  ;)

Why are you expanding your sample?  You know that the data are only
considered "complete" out to a certain range (25pc or something); beyond
that, a lot of stars are excluded.  So by increasing the sample out to
100pc, you\'re totally skewing your results downward.

The right answer is:

Neither.  A sergeant is an omnipresent force, the magnitude and
proximity of which is directly proportional to the degree to which the
unfortunate private has screwed up; as such, sergeants are neither
saluted nor painted.

Y\'know, that whole exchange might be an amusing color quote for GT:

Well, I may be putting myself at risk here, but...

I\'ll _gladly_ pay both US and Australian taxes on income gained under
the following conditions:

1.  That the Australian tax commissioner declares that, any contrary
evidence notwithstanding, I am the sole winner of the most recent
PowerBall multi-state lottery drawing that exceeded USD 100 million, and
that, therefore, the agencies that administer the PowerBall lottery must
pay me the prize money, as a lump sum, subject to all US and Australian
income taxes.

2.  That any monetary gain that I enjoy due to subsequent investment of
that portion of the lottery prize money remaining after US and
Australian taxes imposed on the original winnings is subject only to
taxation by the United States Federal government, and the state and
local governments in whose jurisdiction I reside.

After all, if the Australian tax commissioner can rewrite history to
suit that office\'s needs, then let the commissioner spread the benefits
around!  If the Australian tax commissioner\'s office lives up to its
obligations under the terms stated above, then I certainly will live up
to mine.  And all that revenue for Australia would come from Americans
playing an American lottery.  Sweet, isn\'t it?

Heck, I\'ll even make that agreement for _every_ time the PowerBall goes
over USD 100 million!  Think of all the revenue for the Australian
government, simply by invoking the tax commissioner\'s authority to
rewrite history!

Laissez les bon temps rouler!

(Of course, should the Australian tax commissioner decline my generous
offer, I am at little risk.  After all, while the commissioner\'s office
may attempt to _assess_ taxes on me as if I had, indeed, won said
PowerBall lottery, one _still_ cannot get blood from a turnip,
particularly a poor college-student turnip....)

I tend to consider that once the Minor or Feeder Route has merged into a
Main Route, then it can take as long a jump as it likes.  The Main can
either be a \'real\' Main (ie : a >= 10BTN) or one that has been upgraded due
to traffic volume.

So, yes, it can take a J3 or higher provided it\'s part of a Feeder or Main
Route.

It could also be Pulse Modulation (aka PCM - Pulse Code Modulation)

I think that\'s a binary pulse/no pulse system.

How to explain PM in a mail message ?

AM the sine wave peaks and troughs get bigger and smaller.
FM the sine wave peaks and troughs get closer together and father apart.

Now think of a sign wave going through cycles as above but with no AM or
FM modulation, a single tone.

Phase modulation would have the above pattern change.

Draw one sine wave, and then draw the inverse of the sine wave next to
it. So you would have a peak, a trough, a trough and then a peak. This
is a phase modulation.

How do you detect it ? You either run another signal next to it which
doesn\'t change (a carrier signal) and look for phase variance by
comparing the two. Or you have a local ocolator which matches the
frequency of the wave and measure the phase variance compared to that.

Hope this helps

You might want to reconsider. 0.1 parsec is a LONG distance. 
Anthing more than 10 AU is probably too far for anthing other 
than a jump, time wise. Even that is too far for slower ships.
10 AU will take 9 days for 1G, 6.3 for 2G, down to 3.7 for 6G.
For most ships, more than 10 AU means a jump. 0.1 parsec equals 
20626.5 AU. 

0.000049 parsec is just a tad over 10 AU.

Still too far. Depending on the speed the ships use, more than 7 
days travel time will make it a jump, and thus a worthwhile target.

My guess is that if the car was well designed and worked, there wasn\'t a
problem,
indeed the memorable name might even have helped.

On the other hand, if the Nova had serious reliability problems, the "no va"
tag would stick and the makers might as well give up.

No names, but it does carry some major catalog cross-identifications.

Actually I have cross indexed the names from the Yale Bright Star
against the draper numbers in both the Yale and Hipparcos, giving
Bayer/Flamsteed name against Hip number, if anyone can use that data.

PM can be Pulse Modulation also. :-)

But phase modulation is fairly simple (in theory). 1200 bps modems
use it.

You know what a sine wave looks like, right? Well, with phase
modulation you "displace" the wave "sideways". So instead of a peak,
you are crossing zero (that\'d be a 90 degree phase change). 

It\'s a lot easier to explain when you can draw diagrams.

When we had drills (and some actual alarms) you did one of two things:

A. If the machine would finish the current "cycle" on its own, then you
   just walked away.

B. For systems that\'d keep right on cycling until they ran out of stuff
   in the "input", you might take a moment to move something so it\'d
   "run out" quickly and shut down.

And in Clean rooms, you\'d use the emergency exits, even if that meant
that everyone in the room would have to change to a new bunny suit
before returning after the drill. 

Given that we *did* have a few nasties, this was a good thing and well
worth any ruined product. One of the more memorable incidents was when
something went wrong in the acid etch lab and the "scrubber" on the
exhaust failed. We started getting NOx fumes dumped into the outside
air (bad) and sucked into the air intakes for the rest of the plant
(*really* bad!). 

Another bad one was when something went wrong and they managed to spill
a few cubic meters of TCE. Seems some idiot was filling a tank from a
supply line (we had all sorts of things piped *all* over the plant) and
stepped away for a "second". His supervisor sounded the alarm when he
saw liquid running under the door of the room....

CT used jump coils to produce a spherical jump field  around  the
ship.  IIRC it was said (in the controversial A4: Leviathan) that
objects like antenea that weren\'t retracted  were  liable  to  be
sheared off.  In S9 the jump tug uses a net  wrapped  around  the
external cargo to extend the jump field beyond its normal sphere.
Evidently this  net  had  jump  field  repulsion  characteristics
similar to MT\'s jump grid idea.

Thus in CT a grid was only required in exceptional cases  as  the
non-grid field is a sphere.

(Additional: I remember reading somewhere that  the  CT  rational
for the 100d jump limit was that gravity distorted  this  sphere.
An extreme example would be a ship on the ground  activating  its
j-drive: the field created would be pulled into a splitter  shape
taking the j-drive, some hull plating, and part  of  the  landing
pad ... but leaving most of the ship behind!)

I have a copy too. It looks like a nice little game but I haven\'t had chance 
to play it yet.

The movement system is a bit different to "normal" traveller with ships only 
being able to travel along specified jump routes but they can make as many 
jumps per turn as they like until they reach an enemy ship or can\'t refuel.

The map system is good. Basically each player randomly selects a subsector 
map and adds it to the existing map until both homeworlds have been placed. 
So the map ends up different each time you play.

I had looked at producing some convertion rules for HG ships and allowing 
the player to build their own ships and changing the movement rules to allow 
ships to move in the normal traveller fashion but you may as well just use 
the HG/TCS rules for that.

I toyed with this idea for a while, and was going to write a 3D sector
viewer program (I have a very basic one for Dos which shows space near earth
out to about 10 light years, though the stellar Data I used is probably
incomplete). An Idea I had was to reduce the jump distances, and use
interstellar brown dwarfs for refuelling. Not all of these would be charted
given the difficulty in spotting them, giving ample locations for secret
deep space labs or pirate refuelling stations and the like. Incomplete maps
of an area would make invasion of an interstellar state by another a risky
business for the attacker, as the defending state would know the space much
better. Naval maps would be jealously guarded state secrets, and not
available to the civilian free trader. 

I keep meaning to go back and do the map program properly, complete with
sector / subsector generation, 3d viewer, and route calculator (given two
stars and a max jump of 2, what\'s the shortest route?). I doubt I ever will
find time though.

BBC Radio did a Blake\'s Seven audio play (available on  cassette)
called The Triple Crown Affair (or something like that).  At  one

military base ...

    Avon: "There it is."

IMTU, we make that assumption about *all* Droyne worlds. They simply
have no need for technology beyond TL9 or so, but if they really, 
really need it, there are drones whose job is to keep plans and 
processes for the more advanced stuff. Also, Droyne know basic TL9
tech, like jump drives, lasers, etc rather the way the Star Wars
universe does--it\'s so ingrained into their tech base for so long
(300,000 years? Or at least 75,000.) that any group of tech workers
can throw a jump drive together (given the necessary materials) the
way you could make a wheel.

(Anyone remember that in the Star Wars universe, blasters are
so ancient a tech that animal-riding barbarians seem to throw
them together with bailing wire and rocks?  Droyne tech is that
routine to them, too.)

I agree--and I think that what you have here is either 
(1) a Micro$oft-only ISP who is
blitheringly ignorant of the existance of Active Perl with IIS extensions,
which allows you to do Perl CGI scripts on WinNT servers, or (2) an ISP
who doesn\'t want to be bothered with the security issues of customer-
provided CGI scripts and is blowing you off with a lame excuse. Either
that, or they are using IIS with Front Page extensions unmodified
"out of the can", and are too ignorant to do anything other than insist
that you use FrontPage to publish your web pages and .ASP scripts.
Either way, your ISP sounds like a disaster waiting to be hacked.
Hope you can find a home somewhere else. All the ones I know of
that have really good people and policies are also pay sites,
unfortunately.

Yes, but "decease" doesn\'t convey the meaning "de-cease (stop stopping)

    'body' => 'Ah!  A new debate!  Did Grandfather wipe out ALL his kids,
and if not, where are they?

Our heroes, Maldaar and Skelli, Imperial Bureau of Investigation,
have stumbled upon an organ-smuggling cartel whose operations
involve harvesting the victims of the so-called Low Berth Syndrome
and shipping the carcasses to an interdicted Droyne world.  While
approaching the world and trying to figure out how to get on the
surface without being blown to bits in orbit, Maldaar snorts deriseively
when Skelli mentions the power Grandfather and the Ancients must
have had.

Maldaar:
"Well, the truth is, Grandfather is a myth cooked up by the Khazd
- -- a special projects arm of the Imperial-Zhodani-Darrian "Special
Assembly", itself an intersection of the most powerful Humaniti
industrialists and scientists in Known Space -- to mask the experiments
being done to human victims by certain political entities with certain
dark visions of a future race of uberhuman and oberhuman classes:
the Goverened (most of the people) and the Governors (the scientists,
industrialists, and military-political elements themselves).  All the so-
called evidence for the being known to us as Grandfather is planted
by these elements to direct us into thinking these devices and bases
were built in the distant past when really the work is only now starting
to bear fruit.  Black Globes are manufacturable, even by the Imperial
military\'s own press releases; what they\'re not saying is that they\'ve
known how to make them for a hundred years and have perfected
the technique.  The great Sighting off of Vilis in 1002 confirms that
there are a number of mercenary craft with these Black Globes, and
that\'s just 800-dton vessels by the way.  And don\'t forget the phantom
"Special Arm" of the Darrian navy.  They\'re telling us that this stuff is
1000 years old.  Isn\'t it more plausible to say that these ships are
simply state-of-the-art, special military technology whose existence
was leaked to the public in order to dispel possible concerns about
our governments hiding technology from us?  Our market-friendly,
sharing-is-good government can\'t be seen hiding anything that\'s
potentially beneficial: the megacorps and major worlds would revolt.
But now you can blame it on the Darrians\' secret police and their
crack squadrons.  Problem solved."

Skelli:
"What about Twilight\'s Peak?  Everyone\'s heard the rumors about
the far traders who found an intact base, complete with warrior
Droyne, neural disintegrators, and a planetary defense grid that
dissolved several Shivva cruisers?"

Maldaar:
"Skelli, you\'ve fallen into believing these rumors because they say
what they\'re told to say and we\'re trained to hear.  Why was the base
destroyed?  Why did the trideo images show a few hours of nothing?
How come the only substantial remains of this base is a crater filling
with metal-laced water?  These traders stumbled onto a government
operation of such sensitivity that the base had to be destroyed, the
traders implanted with false memories, and the Zhodani blamed just
to cover their trail.  That proves it was a psionics research base,
which shows that the Imperium isn\'t against psionics, it\'s just against
normal people developing the skills that would enable them to see
through the schemes of the Khazd."

Skelli:
"But they said it themselves, that the Droyne activated the auto-destruct.
And the planet has metallic dust which has been shown to have static
properties that well may have erased any footage shot."

Maldaar:
"It\'s a cover-up.  There were no Droyne.  You ever been on a Droyne
ship?  It looks like a bird cage.  Their repairs are done a few moments
before or after a part fails.  There\'s no way they could have invented
anything other than a mirror with little plastic beads to play with and a
beak sharpener."

Skelli:
"You\'re being rude.  And besides, research indicates that Grandafather
was a freak mutation with a hyperintelligent, hyperpsionic intellect.  Of
course he\'s nothing like the Droyne we know now."

Maldaar:
"That\'s because he never existed.  He was made up by a conspiracy
of powerful humans with the intent of galactic domination.  Look, if
Grandfather was such a hot dude, then why is there no real proof of
his existence?  Here, key over to your galactic dictionary and search
on Yaskoydray.  There it is.  NOW, do a search on the roots of that
name.  You won\'t find any.  No Yas, Yask, Yaskoy, and no Dray
or Ray.  All you have there is "Skoy", meaning "arrival", or "Koy",
which means "drive".  There is no Droyne name that doesn\'t have a
published meaning -- Droyne are particular about that -- and even if
Yaskoydray isn\'t his real name it would be the name given by Droyne
to try to explain him."

Skelli:
"Well I was told it means \'Grandfather\'.  Perhaps it\'s a long root."

Maldaar:
"It doesn\'t and it\'s not.  I suspect it is actually the code name for the
project that\'s being instigated under his name.  Check this out:
(Maldaar scribbles on his palm computer)
"Yaskoydray.  If you convert the Galanglic letters to numbers, with
\'a\' being 26 and \'z\' being 1, you get a sequence.  It doesn\'t look like
much at first, but I searched some physics databases at the University
of Regina and found that the combination matches a frequency used
in black globe research."

Skelli:
"Maldaar, they use a LOT of frequencies with research.  The probability
of any set of numbers matching a frequency must be close to 1..."

Maldaar:
"Which is what I thought too, so I cross referenced the Galanglic name
Yaskoydray with the Zhodani and Darrian names, and came up with
two *complementary* frequencies.  Add these three up and you get
a masking frequency used in stellar physics, particle acceleration,
energy storage, Imperial linear programming, you name it, it\'s there.
This is high-tech stuff, Skelli; it touches every part of our infrastructure.
Yaskoydray isn\'t a person, it\'s a *key*.  A key to a cover-up of
galactic proportions and significance, Skelli, and I\'m going to find out
what it is."

No, that\'s called "ruining the turnip in the attempt to get blood." 
While ruined turnips may well be the primary objective in some divorce
cases, at the end of the day, all one has to show for one\'s efforts is a
ruined turnip, and no blood.

The merits of the film per se have been discussed already here.  I
actually liked the film more the second time I saw it; maybe it\'s all the
lead in the drinking water around here.  But the interesting part was the
audience reaction to it.  The elite young minds of America and several
European countries, our world\'s future leaders, scientists, analysts,
financial whizzes, and military brass, thought it was a "really realistic"
(sic.) movie with a great plot, although they thought the acting was a bit
weak.  They were peevish with me for cheering on the bugs and consistently
referring to our heros as "the Nazi pigdogs".  They thought that the
future world order in the film was "really pretty reasonable" and "I\'d

I take comfort only from the fact that Citizens of the TML, regardless of
political viewpoint, are unlikely to take any comfort from this.

And many thanks to all those who\'ve chipped in with comments.  It\'s on

Actually, I\'m not sure about this.  I imagine it will be in SF (I thought
aficionados were supposed to balk at the term \'sci-fi\'?) *until* we\'re
doing it for real and see how \'fake\' banking fighters look.  Kind of like
how Buck Rogers spaceships looked ok at the time (I presume) and now look
hopelessly dated (or even classic Trek computers etc.).

Ditto this.  Once a large porportion of the population has travelled in
space and *know* how \'quiet\' it is (I\'m not sure this will be the case as I
suspect that like living aboard ship it will actually be quiet noisy at a
\'local\' level), then it will become very unfashionable to have whizzing
ships.  IMO.

Excepting episodes like Darmok, that\'s about it.  Farscape did at least try
to give a handwave with their microbes attaching to the brainstem, but I
definately felt the wind from the arms in motion.  :-)

IIRC "sci fi" is the favored term for science-lite space fantasy --
specifically in the video media -- like Star Trek, Star Wars, and Babylon
5. "Sf" is the term favored for "harder" science fiction, specifically in
the print media. [At least I think this is the case from the viewpoint of
one author (Mr. Asimov, in his book on writing) -- again, IIRC].

In a sense you\'re right.  You could take it right down to 0.0002 Parsecs.
(If I\'ve got the calculation right a 6G maneuver drive is then about as
quick as a Jump drive).  However, if you want to compare number of jump
destinations with the standard traveller maps then I\'d put it higher.  Upto
6000 AU (=0.03 Parsecs?) would count as the same system in Book 6.

Anyway, whichever I use I don\'t seem to get anywhere near as many binaries
as I thought so I\'ll have to have a look at the data and figure out whats
going on.

Another point:  What\'s the maximum range of Jump-1?  I would have tended to
assume 1.5 parsecs rather than 1.0.  (Otherwise a jump-1 ship couldn\'t
travel 2 parsecs in 2 jumps unless they were both exactly 1 parsec.)
However this doesn\'t tie in with the Solomani Rim data where Sol as no
Jump-1 neighbours - Alpha Cen is 1.3 parsecs I think.

The short answer to your question is "yes, minor routes can \'piggyback\' on J-3+ routes if doing so reduces the number of jumps needed to reach their destination."

The language on designating routes is rather tortured, I admit.  Part of the problem is that "routes" is used to refer to the amount of trade between two worlds, the path that trade takes, and the total level of traffic between two adjacent worlds.  Inevitably, this leads to confusion.  If there\'s ever a FT 2e, revamping the vocabulary will be a top priority.

I do like the media clips in the movie, and the whole psionic SS motif,
but I thought it seemed awfully ripped-off from the Babylon 5 series.
When I was shown the PsyCorps (sp?) public service announcement, I nearly
choked to death laughing.  

All the "I coulda gone to Harvard!" comments in the Starship Troopers film
went over well here, needless to say.  I thought that the film is a good
metaphor for grad student life here: swarms of chittering undergraduates
out to stab & rip you to bits, the occasional bloated brain-sucking
professor, and we\'re all fascist goons with good teeth and nice hair.

A disturbing number of us are going around singing or humming many of the
songs under our breath.  Which seminar to go to to suck up to profs?
"What Would Brian Boitano do?"  Wheedle out of doing work for a prof?  "La
Resistance lives on."  Get caught by a prof skipping on work and get
reamed?  "You\'re a ___ ____ing uncle-____er".  Etc.

ObTrav:  I desperately want to run a Trav campaign based on South Park.
Suggestions welcomed.

I think the situation is more akin to seeing "ItWontGo" ,
"WillNotWork" or "DoesNotWork" as an official automobile brand name.
Strange, hard to read, but intelligible and not exactly
confidence-inspiring.  :)

>meaning.

With all due respect, that\'s stretching it. Remember, what\'s at question in
this particular legend is specifically that Spanish speakers *saw* the word
Nova on cars and literally translated in as "no go" and this went on to hurt
its sales.

Not to sound too politically correct about it, but the story does make
certain assumptions about the intelligence of Mexicans, or Spanish, or
whoever the story happens to be told about at a given time. The same
assumption translated into an English speaking would be absurd. Nobody goes
to Walmart expecting to buy walls, even though when pronounced it may sound
like "wall mart".

It\'s even more absurd when you consider the fact that Nova is a word in the
Spanish language. You don\'t even have to speak Spanish, you just need to
look at the borrowed phrase "bossa nova".

Would a Spanish speaker make a pun concerning the name of the car? I don\'t
doubt it. Would Spanish speakers be dissuaded from buying a car because they
read the name literally? I seriously doubt that.

> > The Chevy Nova did fine in Spanish speaking markets.

"The truth is that the Chevrolet Nova\'s name didn\'t significantly affect its
sales: it sold well in both its primary Spanish-language markets, Mexico and
Venezuela. (Its Venezuelan sales figures actually surpassed GM\'s
expectations.)"

With all due respect, if you can cite a source other than "an interview for
a show on the history channel", such as approximate airdate, the nature of
the show, the name of the program itself (especially if it was one of their
regular shows such as History\'s Mysteries / In Search of History, Modern
Marvels, etc.). Alternately, the name of the PA person would be extremely
helpful.

I\'m not asking this to be picky, but in my time as an amateur folklorist,
I\'ve heard lots of people indicate that a story was indeed true because they
saw it on television. A popular legend that was circulating at the time I
was in high school, for example, was that Snapple (or Marlboro) supported
the Ku Klux Klan with millions of dollars. Frequently cited as a source was
an episode of Oprah Winfrey where the CEO of Snapple or Marlboro announced
this proudly to the world.

The SF / sci-fi debate is a hopeless quagmire, as far as I\'m concerned. Is
that debate still going on? I remember a time that calling something SF
meant that the speaker was trying to elevate whatever they were talking
about to a higer level than "sci-fi". I thought that the SF (speculative
fiction) movement sort of petered out, with the exception of heated
arguments about conventions?

For what it\'s worth, classic Buck Rogers ships aren\'t really terribly dated.
I mean, they have the same basic shape as modern rocket ships...

I sure as hell don\'t. But nearly everyone I\'ve talked to about Starship
Troopers FAILED to take in the REAL meaning of the movie. Damn media
touts it as a "Kill The Bugs" flick, when it\'s really a social
commentary about the state of our society and the general apathy amongst
the populace. In Heinlein\'s novel the apathy was even worse, and when
WWIII took place, the only people who could restore order were the
military. Hence the fascist society of citizens and civilians. The end
result being hundreds of fellow movie-goers coming out of the theater
with slackjaw and a stupored look on their faces as in, "Man, were they
all wrong about that movie!"

Wake up America, you\'re dreaming!

But everything comes around..

In 1993, Kirsten and I were sitting in the auditorium at the end of opening
ceremonies for ConFrancisco, that year\'s World Science Fiction Convention.
We who stayed had been promised an interesting development in space flight,
so the room was wall to wall NASA freaks.  As we had already seen Arthur C.
Clarke get eaten by the Sri Lankan Death Chihuahua, anything was possible.

This new break-through has called Delta Clipper Experimental, or DC-X.
After the project director gave us a quick history of project, the light
dimmed, and video tape rolled.

We saw a boxy little cone sitting in the desert, and heard the obligatory
countdown.  At liftoff, with very little fuss, the cone left the pad, went
up about 200 feet, and stopped.

Stopped!  Hung there.  As in the way that bricks don\'t hang there.  There
was this spaceship happily floating above the desert floor.  Doing things
that usually have you looking for the string or the bluescreen box, but it
got better..

After a few seconds of defying physics, the cone tilted a bit and started
drifting to the left.  Just like any other multi-ton balloon you\'ve ever
seen, until it obediently stopped at it\'s controller\'s whim.

Then it started to land, tail first, and God as my witness four little
spindly legs came out!  Don Stewart call your office!  Every 1950\'s skiffy
epic was avenged that day in the Nevada desert!  The DC-X comes down in as
little fuss as it ascended, and at that the crowd went nuts.  We were on
our feet cheering and clapping, demanding that they run the video again
(they did, nearly twenty times!) at which point Jerry Pournelle grabbed the
microphone and proclaimed:

"This is spaceflight the way GOD and ROBERT HEINLEIN *meant* it to be!"

Which sent us off again.  There wasn\'t a dry eye in the house as we watched
this two minute long tape.

I had the chance to speak with one of the McDonnell-Douglas reps, and he
asked my why we had had such an emotional reaction to what was in reality
just an initial test?  "Because it\'s real" was the best reply I could give
him.

So don\'t be so quick to discard those cliches of yesteryear.. Today I saw
an add for a cellphone you wear on your wrist...just like Dick Tracy\'s.

After watching the Brady Bunch as a yout\', I think South Park is probably a

Of course, the PCs themselves will use some different

And an officer who shoots his own men, when he could\'ve nailed the bug 
and gone and recovered his man. And they send their sigs to high ground 
with no security. Sigs may be a lower form of life, but they do have 
their uses (carrying heavy radios and soaking sniper fire, for

I\'m glad to know that someone else out there knows how
to keep time.  You know, I blame it on public schools (and
the advertsers).  It\'s just this sort of muddy thinking that
would lead to a *year* zero (0) in 3I.

Kyle replied:
well, our society just isn\'t too knowledgeable about
war and the military. Fair enough, it\'s not a pleasant
topic, the one being horrifying, the other boring.
Remember, this is the same western audience who
thought, "Saving Private Ryan" was a realistic war movie.

Since I don\'t make a habit of writing down pithy bits from TV shows... It
has re-aired in the past 60 days, it was about automobiles, and was made
within the past 3 years. (It referenced 1996 models). It wasn\'t In Search
of nor History\'s Mysteries. It mentioned ONLY the Mexican market with a
name change (not the rest of the spanish speaking markets). It aired in
prime time. It may have been Modern Marvels. It was one of the regular
series of shows.

If I see it again, I will jot the citation down.

Also note: some of the debunkers have overzealously labeled some things as
"Fakes" when they did occur. Many of them "debunk" a slightly exagerated or
mis-labeled bit, without knowing that the majority IS true, and without
trying to find the whole truth and debunk only those parts untrue. Net
Hoaxes have been going since the 80\'s, and debunkers have been making
mistakes on occasion since the 80\'s. I give the debunking sites no more
credit than I do any other sites on the web... unless they are part of a
major media organization, I give them little to none outside their own
company\'s lore.

Rather cynical, but undoubtably correct.  Look at the bright side of things,
all of us that are on "Y2K Disaster Watches" thanks to our jobs will be able

I don\'t mean to be rude, but did you consider the fact that it was *meant*
to be a black comedy in the first place? I mean, this was not a surprising
concept. Paul Verhoeven has built a career around extremely violent,
action-packed science-fiction black comedies. I\'m utterly confused by anyone
who expected this movie to be serious or in any way accurate.

This is not somebody who fumbled the ball here, this *is* the same guy who
did Total Recall and RoboCop, after all.

The bad Civil War era military tactics were bloody horrible.  I also lost 
it when the huge fleet transport vessel in the middle of open space 
couldn\'t spot a monstrously huge (i.e. much larger than the giant space 
ship) rock coming at them until they were almost run over by the damn thing.

The few redeeming features of the film were almost verbatim quotes from the 
book.  The "Moral Philosophy" stuff I was almost certain they wouldn\'t dare 
put it.  But then, it was a Verhoven film and he pretty much doesn\'t give a 
flying rat fornication about much.

I rented the DVD version in order to hear the Directory/Writer commentary 
soundtrack.  It was a busy weekend, so I didn\'t get through the whole 
thing, but I got the impression that while the film\'s writer had actually 
read the book (ok, so he actually came out and said he did), I\'m still not 
convinced the director did.  He had plenty of his own axes to grind in this 
film.

Another redeaming feature was Clancy Brown was Sergeant Zim.

With all due respect, maybe you should if you\'re going to cite them. I have
cited my sources in another post. More on that in a second.

Not "In Search of...", but "In Search of History," totally different show
with a totally different theme and context. It is now known as "History\'s
Mysteries" with little bits added.

It must have been Modern Marvels.

Good deal.

Yes, among them specifically is "the body under the motel room bed." There
are also grey areas with urban legends, where a proper starting date for a
legend is tough to come by, or where a similar event may be inspired by a
legend. The legend of the cement filled car is a perfect example.

In the case of Barbara Mikkelson, this is quite unlikely. If you want to go
to the San Fernando Valley Folklore Society\'s reference webpage and find
something there which is demonstrably false, be my guest... until then, I\'ll
be inclined to trust a scholarly source in my own area of expertise.

Please don\'t be insulted by this statement. Put yourself in my shoes:

You have a certain amount of knowledge about something. You can cite a
reference which is well known and well respected in a specific field. This
is something in a field which you have considerable interest in, and which
you have done your own independent research on.

Someone tells you, "It\'s true, I saw it on TV!", while calling into question
the credibility of the source you\'re citing, while showing no evidence he\'s
read any of the materials in question.

Fair enough. As I said, if you want to give me something that Barbara
Mikkelson has written which is demonstrably false, I would love to see it.
Until that time, I will treat  the SFVFS\'s Urban Legends Reference Pages as
I have since I discovered them: a valuable and accurate resource with regard
to folklore.

Kyle laughs and responds:
Not quite! But a veteran of fighting... and I know
that the one thing not shown in that movie, the one
thing that no movie will _ever_ show because it drives
a rusty salt-encrusted blad into the heart of all our
myths of our warrior past, is that most soldiers never
fire directly at the enemy. They do their damned best
to avoid it. 

Instead of eight guys fighting, you would have had
maybe two of them firing, another couple "Oh, I\'m just
loading magazines for him," another couple pointing
out targets, "quick, shoot him, Joe!", one patching up
wounds, and another one running messages. But in this
movie, they were all killers, except for the wimpy
translator, who only shot an unarmed man, and his not
killing was depicted as cowardice.

Guys pointing out targets or loading magazines
obviously are as morally reposnsible for the killing
as the firer, but it doesn\'t _feel_ the same. Believe
me.

It\'s not cowardice, but that\'s how audiences would
view it. Most men never fire, or just fire around the
enemy, to scare him off. If an officer is standing
right next to them, shouting, "shoot, damnit!" they
will, but as soon as he goes away...

This has been true for all armies through history, all
that we can study at all, or have records for. It\'s
just damned hard to look another human being in the
eyes and kill them. This is the real reason that
artillery and bombers and mines kill more people than
bullets: if all you;re doing is firing on a point on a
map, well, that\'s easy to live with. This is the real
reason muskets supplanted the longbow and the sword:
it\'s harder for a man to make the psychological
connection at a gut level between his gun and the
guy\'s wounds, than between a sword and his wounds. 

This is the real reason bayonet charges still work
sometimes: the thought that someone really is willing
to stick several inches of cold steel in your body is
quite chilling. Bullets and bombs are as deadly, but
somehow bayonets are more personal and chilling.

It\'s a very hard thing to do, to kill someone, and
most men in war do their damnedest to avoid - if
they\'re grunts. I\'ve not heard of any non-firers
amongst artillerymen, or mine-layers. 

Since people always ask for references, I refer those
interested to Col David Grossman\'s excellent work, "On
Killing", where he discusses exactly this military
problem, and how the (US) military has tried to
overcome it.

My own aussie military has not been so successful, I\'d
say. Bad for the army, good for humanity.

But non-firing will never be depicted in the movies
except as cowardice. Such men are not cowards, they\'re
simply human. They risk their lives to save comrades,
they just don\'t want to take other lives. That\'s
humanity, not cowardice. But this is rather too fine a
distinction to make for most film-makers (note I don\'t
say, "film-goers", I think makers underestimate the
intelligence of film-goers.)

The timeline didn\'t say when the Droashav invaded, but you are 
correct. They were probably TL 1 or even 0 at the time! Thanks for 
the page reference, I missed that.

Your remark about "archeological material" now seems prescient.

Ah yes, that was my favorite.

He looks up, seeing movement, apparently thinks nothing of it, and then
sends the radioman up to get better reception.

"Son, go up onto that ridge to get a better signal."

Many insane giggles were heard in our little theater at that.

Cripes, I felt violated after seeing that movie -- even moreso than
_Highlander 2_ or <shudder> _Sky Bandits_.

This is exactly the problem I have (or one of the problems) with Star Trek,
who the hell sends down their main officers to an unsecure planet to 
investigate some unknown phenomena, armed only with a hand phaser.

They just went through showin Space Above and Beyond here and for all
its shortcoming, I like the fact that these guys/girls go down to
planets, armed with real guns :-)

Many of us hoped that a movie called "Robert Heinlein\'s Starship Troopers"
would have more resemblance to the book than a few names and a sketched out
plot.  Ginny Heinlein tried to have The Master\'s name removed after seeing
a pre-release print.

Those eight guys were Rangers, American Commandos.  They were they best
that we had to offer, and in a situation like they found themselves in,
everybody would shoot.  They were also veterans already.. obviously the
sergeant had been in the war since \'42!

In that incredible first 20 minutes, you see that most of the troops are
cowering on the beach trying very hard to Be Somewhere Else.  That\'s what
leadership is about.  The motto of the US Infantry is "Follow Me!", and
it\'s also the order you give when everything else has gone to shit.  Go get
them.

by Timothy Collinson

The PCs are just entering town in slow moving evening rush hour traffic
when they witness a being assault another, hitting him full in the face and
leaving him stretched out on the side of the road having hit his head on
the ground.

1. The PCs drive on and do nothing.  Next day the local news carries
reports of the death of a being killed by an unknown assailant who attacked
him on the street in the rush hour.

2. The PCs drive on but another witness saw them see the events and got
their vehicle registration.  *Not* helping in such circumstances can carry
hefty penalties on this world.

3. The PCs stop to lend assistance but the assailant has already made
himself scarce and others are attending to the injured being.  Still, the
thought was there.

4. The PCs stop to lend assistance, any with medical skill can attend to
the stricken being, others can endeavour to apprehend the assailant and/or
his two friends.  After \'collaring\' the one who threw the punch, he will
violently make a run for it breaking the little finger of whoever has a
hold of him.  (This won\'t be realized for an hour or so and will take four
weeks in a stack splint [1] to heal).

5a. The PCs stop to lend assistance and are able to apprehend the assailant
after an exciting chase on foot.  The local law enforcers are glad of the
assistance.  The broken finger of (4) can be inflicted at the discretion of
the referee.

5b. The PCs stop to lend assistance and report what they\'ve seen to the
local law enforcers.  However, what they hadn\'t seen prior to the events
above was that the assailant had himself been attacked extremely violently
and his punch was his one act of self defence.

6. The PCs stop to lend assistance and are set on by *all* those at the
scene, including the being picking himself off the roadside, as they object
to outsiders interfering with a \'private\' matter.



OK, so this isn\'t the usual patron encounter but might be fun to add a bit
of color or to raise ethical issues in your role playing.  The reason it is
a little \'odd\' and doesn\'t give the referee the usual "here\'s all the
facts" is because, contrary to what the Readers\' Digest may say, life isn\'t
like that and this incident was inspired by real life.  In case anyone
cares my gamelife referee evidently rolled a \'4\'.

tc
I wouldn\'t recommend trying this at home


[1]  I saw the name of the splint when at the fracture clinic but failed to
make a note of it.  A quick search on the web turned up:
http://supports4u.com/finger.htm which looks like the thing, but no medical
knowledge should be presumed!

Perhaps the rock had just dropped out of warp or something.

Of course, heading away from the rock instead of towards it would have

(Like so much it was a shame because being forced to wait as the ship slowly

 were.)

With all due respect to Col. Grossman\'s work, it based on
flawed research. Grossman\'s work is based mainly on the
performance of the US army in the 2nd WW and Korea. And
(again) with all respect for the many US veterans on the list,
that is a case study in how to take 1st class manpower with
1st class equipment and train them to a fever pitch of
mediocrity. There was something terribly wrong with the US
infantry at the time, but it had absoletely nothing to do with
the actual men. It was simple incompetant handling of an
excellent resource by the US military. The basic underlying
problem (ie that soldiers are people not some mindless
manpower pool) was not addressed by the US military until
after Vietnam, by which stage the famous (and inaccurate)
1 in 10 will fire rule had entered their collective conciousness.

Process South Park through Futurama.  Then release the four-a**ed
mutants...

Starship Turkeys!

The turkeys will, of course, use near-C rocks, aka Kenny-killers.

Mr Anki was created by Vilani shulgilis to educate children on the
importance of having lots of fibre in their diets.  Given the usual sources
of dietary fibre in the Vilani diet, this was rather necessary.

Oh, and of course, South Park is in the Solomani Confederation.  I blame
the Imperium.

Hmmm... this is a bit embarrassing. Now that you mention it, I may well

Passed where? I\'m sure that violating copyright is illegal here too,
but I doubt that the penalties are the same in Canada as they are in
the US.

Well, yes, but part of my original premise is that Roger is too
poor and/or incompetent to adequately police the use of the work
he owns. And again, I\'m in Canada, which is by no means makes
me immune to prosecution, but it presents a logistical barrier
to alerting the authorities to my (not yet committed) heinous crimes.

Well, I\'m not totally ignorant of this. I work in the software
industry and I\'m quite familiar with copyright, IP rights and
the reality that the line between legal and illegal often gets 
blurred. Frankly, I am much more sympathetic to the fact that
Roger may not actually own some of the work he thinks he owns
(re: Rob Prior\'s message) than to the fact that he has legal
right to the materials.

I have little practical interest in any mass photocopying or any kind
of reproduction of DGP materials, for profit or not. But it
does bother me that people seem to treat Roger\'s (apparent)
ownership of DGP materials as sacred. I don\'t think there\'s
any reasonable objection to using \'Fteirle\' in a GURPS Traveller
pub (which has apparently already happened).

For example, is it really a copyright violation if the authors
of G:T Starships lift the section from SoM about the lanthanum
grid patterns being different for all the different races?
Lifting the passage verbatim is plagiarism, sure, but the 
idea? And using the same names for things - is that _illegal_?

My basic point is that I think people should feel free to 
use DGP materials as "canon source" that same way they use
GDW materials. I have no idea why people seem to think that
using ideas from DGP-published sources is somehow verboten
compared to non-DGP stuff. Even if it is illegal by the letter
of the law (which I\'m not fully convinced it is), I seriously
doubt anyone will get a subpoena and a court date for doing it.

"Only" a hand phaser? This is a weapon that has a "disintegrate" setting.
(They don\'t call it that, but that\'s effectively what it is.) Sounds rather
effective to me.

Of course, sending down the command staff, in reality, is a dumb way to
operate, but since the command staff are the central characters in the
show, the only alternatives would be to send characters no one knows and
cares about to the planet, or watch the command staff on the bridge during
an away mission... At least TNG came up with the concept of the "away team".

Well, her goes

	1. Fighters banking in space and also doing quite 
           reasonable rolls. Fightercombat is a mix between
           atmosphere rules and space rules.
	2. I still haven\'t figured out if everything happens
           in one star system or several and how they travel 
           between the systems. 
	3. Some of the astrphysics stuff is wrong. Dense
           asteroid belts for example. Allthough the 
           comet episode was quite good.
	4. Some tactics stuff. Admittedly I have never been 
           in the army, but some of the ground tactics stuff
           seems rather stupid. 

There was popably more, but those didn\'t question my suspended
disbelief :-)

But hell, I really liked that show. It was to me very Traveller like

The why not incorperate a few real military officers as main characters?
Have Worf and an leuitenant take a troop of soldiers on the \'away teams\'.
I don\'t disagree with the hand phaser being a capable weapon, but for 
jeavens sake, give the away team some armor, extra equipment, first aid
kits. Almost every episode they go down to a planet they get in deep
trouble, with only a hand phaser and hand held computer as their 
equipment, come on! Someday you would think that they would learned (if they
lived long enough :-) and were a little bit more carefule.

I also think that introducing some military characters would give interesting
topics to write about. Imagine a military educated infantry officer in 
heated discussion with Capt. Picard on the bridge over some officers being
held prisoner on the planet below. It would make the show more realistic
and add some spunk to it IMHO.

The 58th squadron travels to many different systems.  The pilot movie
specifically stated the use of wormholes to get from one system to another.
However, this reference was made only once and to my knowledge doesn\'t
appear in any other episodes.  There did not appear to be any discussions of
FTL drives so they may or may not exist.  OTOH, such  a discussion didn\'t
seem necessary to the stories told.  They got around to other planets and
that was that.

Great idea. My take at it (also inspired by real life...) will not

Your Passport, Please!

by Carlos Alos-Ferrer

The PCs have just landed without problems in an Imperial world, well 
below Average Stellar technology. The only oddity of this world is 
that they have their own native language with its own set of 
characters. Part of the population can\'t speak Galanglic, and still 
another part can speak but not read it (think of people who speak 
japanese but understand no kanji). After contacting a patron by 
phone or similar, they agree that an initial pre-payment 
will be delivered to them by local post so that it gets registered.

They receive the communication that the money is waiting for them to 
pick it at a local office and get there. Quite naturally, the clerk - 
who speaks galanglic with difficulty - asks them to identify 
themselves. When the PCs wave their Imperial ID cards, the clerk 
refuses to acknowledge them. "I can\'t read that," he says, "and if 
you are foreigners you must present your Planetary Pass to pick this 
up."

When the PCs ask what the Planetary Pass is. The clerk explains that 
it is the document that authorizes you to travel inside the world if 
you are a foreigner. Of course Imperial citizens do not *need* to 
have it (only non-Imperial ones), but still, without Planetary Pass, 
you can not pick this up.

1. The PCs just give up and contact the patron. The patron will 
reconsider the assignment, since his "trusted" team gave up in the 
face of such a minor difficulty. Besides, the patron cannot reclaim 
the money. It will go back to him only after two months.

2. The PCs try to argue that since they do not need to have a 
Planetary Pass, it is ridiculous to have a regulation forcing them to 
use it. The clerk answers that they cannot expect that he recognizes 
an ID card he cannot understand.

3. The PCs try to get to the clerk\'s boss. He simply confirms the 
clerk\'s view and explains that he cannot change the regulations.

4. The PCs ask how can they get a Planetary Pass. They are directed 
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where a clerk calmly explains 
them, as if they were ignorant children, that they do not need one 
since they are imperial citizens. Still, one can be done, but it will 
take several months as a message to perform routine checks on the 
PCs identity is sent to the subsector capital.

5. The PCs try to get a Certified Translator to make an authorized 
translation of their IDs, and they find it is expensive, but finally 
the clerk accepts it.

6. The PCs discover that, astoundingly, they can authorize a local to 
pick the money up in their name by simply signing the Communication 
and writing the local\'s name. Then all they have to do is to find a 
cooperative local.

Personally I thought "Saving Private Ryan" was a thoroughly boring movie; I 
remember old B&W WWII movies I saw as a kid that were _much_ better.

That explains a lot to me :-) I have never seen the pilot so this kind of bugged
me. It still does though. Does the fighters also travel through these wormholes?
Or is it only capital ships that are capable of this?

In the Star Trek original series episode "Devil in the Dark", the redshirts
were apparently under the command of a gray-haired senior security
officer. This "Chief Security Officer" role became very, very popular in
our game group\'s play of FASA\'s Star Trek RPG. S/he tended to
get quite a bit of screen time.

You could tell our last one had played Traveller...for physical fitness
and such, he insisted his redshirts become proficient with the Cutlass...

Uh, say what?  Did you read the book, or are you thinking of earlier works
such as Marshall\'s Men Against Fire?  Grossman\'s work and discussion of
firing rates et al does not focus on 2nd WW and Korea.

Actually, Grossman\'s hypothesis, in "On Killing," is the opposite of what
you indicate.  It is that the US Army drastically improved its training
methods from WWII and Korea and, by mid way to late Vietnam, had definitely
"got it right" in that respect.  He states that firing rates went UP
dramatically (from 20-30% to about 80-100%) by Vietnam and into the modern
day.  He indicates that US military performance in Vietnam, Somalia, etc.
(on the _tactical_ level) and similarly, British in Falklands (among other
examples), indicates that modern US-Western-NATO training methods are
working in this respect by conditioning soldiers to shoot.  How many are
actually using aimed fire against their opponents is another question, but
certainly a far greater number than WWII.

Grossman\'s man criticism post-Korea is not that US forces are inefficient
in firing, but that (for various reasons) psychological support provided to
the more efficient shooters and killers was lacking (for example, as a
result of individual rotations out of battle area rather than by-unit
rotations).  He also generalizes into discussions of violence in popular
culture and so on; a weakness in his book is a lack of detailed discussion
of police experience in this respect.  Nevertheless, characterizing his
research as "flawed" for the reasons you state does not seem to be accurate.

Well supported is sort of an oxymoron. Being in NZ you probably aren\'t

Maybe it\'s just me, but Traveller nobility seems to be a rather narrow topic 
for a 128 page book. And not a very interesting topic at that, either.

Hmmm.  Some of the things I\'d put in:

How many nobles are there?  How many barons, in particular?  How
many "honors" and "rank" nobles are there drifting around?  How many
knights or baronets?

What do nobles *do*?  Fleet command and oversight, offices in the
regional Imperial government, diplomacy, "one-man fire brigades,"
visiting the court of the Emperor or the local Archduke, sitting in the
Moot, being a tycoon, being a lazy wastrel. . .

Who do they interact with?  Their seneschal, their huscarles, their
other staff, planetary government officials, and so on.

What are noble fiefs really like?  How big, how much income do they
generate?  Maybe even some (not very detailed) rules on managing a fief
or other holdings, a la Far Trader.

How do nobles really interact with local governments?  What kinds of
relationships are common, and what are nobles expected to do to promote
Imperial interests on their home worlds?

Noble families!  Your run-of-the-mill PC doesn\'t have much family,
but a high nobleman *is* his family.  Maybe some rules such as appeared
in "Pocket Empires" for fleshing out your family connections. . .

Planetary nobility?  There must be aristocratic local governments that
tie in to the Imperial nobility without having Imperial rank themselves.

Politics!  What do nobles argue about?

Yachts -- what does your well-connected noble use to get around the
sector in?

Campaigns involving the nobility -- the noble as casual encounter,
the noble as patron, the Noble\'s A-Team campaign, the campaign
where everyone is a noble. . .

Lots of adventure seeds!

I might be interested in seeing some detailed noble characters worked
out at two pages a head, as in the "rogue\'s gallery" books, but not a
whole book of them.  There\'s too much else to talk about.

I got a copy of GURPS Space 3rd edition and was

their version of the Modular Ship Design system. I
found the fact that Sensors and Power Plants had been
broken out into their own categories to be such a
miniscule addition of complexity that I barely noticed
it. This modular system is excellent. I was wondering
if the various GT gearheads out there could advise me
on how to use THIS system to create ships for GT. I
know Jump Drives are quite different, but the sidebar
on the topic in GT gives relevant information. Perhaps
some "Traveller modules" for the GURPS Space system

Certainly. This should be included, along with a sample "normal" noble
or two. A great idea would be to include three or four nobles with
connections to each other, as the foundation of a political campaign.

At least one section of the book (10 pages or more) should be devoted to
life as a noble, both in the core and in the frontiers of the Imperium.

> What burning questions (about nobles) need to be addressed? 

Information about the different ranks of nobility (including their
obligations, powers etc) should be included. Also, descriptions (small
stories would work best) of various ceremonies (duels, declarations of
war, the making of a noble) would be a wonderful flavor addition.

In the Traveller universe, nobles run everything. Because of this, I assume
that the ambitions of nobles will provide the motivation for lots of
interesting adventures. Giving a detailed background for these guys will
make the adventures more interesting and meaningful. Knowing the power
structure of the Imperial nobility, for example, will immediately bring to
mind lots of interesting plots. What is the relationship between these guys
and the megacorporations? What deep dark secrets are generally known only to
the nobility? How much political manuevering is there within the nobility?
How dirty does it get? Is there an accepted code governing what type of
actions are acceptable and which are not? Do these guys take an active role
in government? In particular, detailing the nobles in a known area, say the
Spinward Marches, would add more depth to the setting.

J-Drive module: 3T, 10 MW, 1 space, 3 MCr.  A ship requires (J+1) modules per 100 spaces.  In addition, the ship will require (J*.1) tons of hydrogen fuel per space to jump.

Cabins: multiply volume by 4.  Bridges should probably have their volume doubled.  Neither is increased in cost or weight.

Drives: use TL-11 reactionless at TL-10.  use TL-10 reactionless or super reactionless at TL-9.  Use TL-11 super reactionless at TL-11+.  Use TL 13 contragravity at TL 9+.  Note that \'vectored\' thrust systems are half again heavier and more expensive than the systems in Space 3/e.

PAWS: the smallest PAW is SHv at TL-8, EHv at TL-9, Hv at TL-10, Md at TL-11, Lt at TL-12.

Meson Weapons: use PAW stats, but they start as SHv at TL-10, and base TL (for damage purposes) is 10.

Meson screens: use force screen stats, but multiply weight by .04 and power consumption by .2.

Not much else to it, really.

It can be. But there\'s also *analog* pulse *width* modulation. You get
an analog value between 0 & 1 by having pulses that *start* at regular
intervals (say 1.5 units) and have a duration that varies according to
the value being sent (say 0.1 units for 0 to 1.1 units for 1). 

Or you can have fixed width pulses with the *interval* between them
being the modulation. Again, this allows direct transmission of
*analog* values.  

Both of the above are frequently encountered in telemetry applications.

Digital pulse modulation tends to be similar to what\'s used to encode
data on hard disks:

"FM" aka "single density". This has clock pulses, with data encoded as
the presence or absence of a pulse halfway between clock pulses.

"MFM" (modified FM) aka "double density". There are no clock pulses.
Instead, the data pulses are compared against a local clock, and
special coding is used to ensure that no more than X 0 pulses occur in
a row (to prevent clock drift from garbling data). For disks, X is 4 or
5 if I recall correctly.

about a sort of \'Traveller\'ised En Guarde for  life  on  Capital?
(Its always been on my list of things to do but I never got round
to it.)

Ming the Merciless had to exercise considerable restraint after the coup
not to assume the title "General Doctor Minister President-for-Life".

"Shrug" The two biggest ISPs in NZ are wholely owned subsidaries of the 
two major telephone companies. The one I\'m with gets quite a lot of its 
business by running the local telephone/cable TV company\'s internet 
service.

It seems to be a depressingly common thing with sci-fi movies and TV 
series. They get made and then when the authors of the books they were 
\'based\' on and the science advisors who advised actually see the things 
they want nothing to do with them.

waters.  I hope you don\'t get sucked in!

Things I want to know about Nobles:

1.  Integration of Nobles into Imperial Worlds.  How do the
Nobles operate on worlds that have an implied or actual
non-noble government.  How are fiefs arranged.  Does the
Imperium require worlds to cede control over sections of a world
to set up a feif?  Does the Imperium create concessions (a Baron
rules the ground starport, and another Baron rules the lands for
100 klicks around the Scout Base, and a third noble hold the
patent to a gas giant refueling station).

2.  Inheritance Laws.  Clear up the distinction between Birth
Nobles and Honor Nobles.  Explain how Imperial law or custom
handles inheritance of titles and properties.  If a Duke has
three children, and the eldest is his title heir, what happens
to the others?  Are they now deemed to be at one lower noble
rank level?  Are they dispossessed?  How is property divided.
What sort of confirmation or right of refusal does the Emperor
exercise over the lower nobles.

3.  Nobles and the Local Law.  What power (if any) does a local
Imperial World have over a visiting noble?  Can a non-noble
court try a noble?

4.  Nobles and the Military.  The Domain Archdukes have ion the
past had influence and command over Imperial forces in their
Domain, but this power was lost during one of the post Civil War
reforms.  How much control does a planetary, subsector or sector
noble have over Imperial forces.  What about Household troops?
Any rules governing size and equipment for these guys?  Can the
Imperial military give commands to Household Troops?

5.  Noble Obligations.  Either real or traditional.  Are there
any?  Can a noble be impeached by a higher noble?  What are his
forms of redress?

6.  Knights.  How do they fit into all of the above statements?
Some sample Imperial Knightly Orders would be cool.

7.  Non-Imperial Nobles.  An Imperial member state happens to be
a Kingdom.  How the the King, the Dukes, the Barons and the
Knights of this world fit into the hierarchy of Imperial
Nobility?

Hope that was not too much - I am obviously a very curious
person.  I have my own answers to these questions in MY
Traveller Universe, but I would like to see the answers for an
Official Traveller Universe (or a semi-official GURPS Traveller
Universe!).

Oh to wake the naked guy up, of course. He was late for the morning

Same with S:TNG. Not that it every got really good IMO, but it went from
terrible to okay by third season.

Back to SAAB Problems:

1. It needed someone with military knowledge as an assistant director (or
maybe someone who had once read a book about the military, or who had
lived within a few miles of an army base or SOMETHING! :-) 

2. The banking fighters were okay.  They were semi-realistic with the
rolling ability and stuff, but why not go all the way and do vector
movement?

3. Some episodes were unwatchable due to bad acting and writing.  The
"Little tank that could" one was terrible and the "Flickering light as
psych weapon" one was beyond horrible. 

Having said that, I thought some episodes were brilliant: "Who Monitors
the Birds" was great!  I should\'ve been given some time to get its legs
under itself...

Lesson for SF TV writers:  Keep the number of characters small so you can
actually develop them a little!  Three main characters with 3 secondary
seems to be a winning formula (Think Kirk / Spock / McCoy with Scotty /
Sulu / Chekov).

B5 was just different, with major league politics, unsurpassed character

SA&B is what i envision Star Trek should have been like for the away team.
With people really getting scared when down on some hell hole with something
firing at you. 

Star Trek has its good points to. I like the ships, the feel of space travel.
ST makes it possible to dream yourself away. I didn\'t like the really bad

Are you guys kidding?  I\'ve been waiting for something like  this
since before the T4 version that never was ... back since  CT  in
fact.  And 128 pages  seems  short  to  do  justice  to  such  an
important aspect of the TU.

IMHO Traveller is 1 part Military, 1 part Merchant,  and  1  part
Noble.  We\'ve had plenty of military stuff  and  merchant  stuff,
but for Nobles its been mainly ad hoc articles.

Also, don\'t forget, the most common name for US West is US Pest, and this
is whether you\'re buying voice or data services from them.

This is a phone company that cannot guarantee that 911 works.

Scary real incident: a guy (who has been voiciferously compaining about
US Pest to the local regulatory agencies, btw) is working on his car. Car
falls off the jacks, pinning him under it. He reaches his cell phone,
dials 911. Repeatedly. 

Neighbor three blocks away cannot figure out why the Police are showing up
at their door, saying that 911 has been dialed from there. This happens
once _while_ the cops are there, talking to the homeowners, pohone in
plain sight, NOT BEING USED.  

Finally, the people happen to remember that
they get calls that are supposed to be for this neighbor, tell police to
check out _that_ address.

US Pest finally admits that there _might_ be some minor bug in their
phone system.

I think 128 pages will work out quite fine. I started Traveller with T4,
and got REALLY upset when Nobles never left the drawing board. There is
some material in M0: Campaign, but it isn\'t enough.

I just realized another thing I want to see in the book. A yatch or two
would be really nice. A description of a noble\'s estate (example, maps
and stuff) would also be really neat and a potential lifesaver for
referees.

So what is so interesting about nobles that they deserve their own book? I 
can see how some people may be interested (the kinds of people who like to 
play demi-gods in other campaigns), but I\'m not that kind of person. Now, if 
you included a fair amount of material on diplomatic missions (both inside 
and outside the Imperium), that might be interesting, but diplomacy doesn\'t 
really have that much to do with nobles (not any more than trading or war).

Despite the fact that I got GT: Far Trader, I find merchants boring as well 
as nobles. I liked GT: Star Mercs, but have no intention of running a purely 
mercenary/military campaign (just as boring). But a Scouts campaign ... ah, 
now there\'s something enteresting.

You can get court martialed for anything other than very minor offences (and 
maybe even for those). Despite opinions to the contrary, Star Fleet is 
_obviously_ a military organization.

Thanks for seeking our input, Loren.  

> What burning questions (about nobles) need to be addressed? 

I\'d like to see some coverage of the Imperium\'s political economy and
history.  How did the noble class arise?  What functions does the class
fulfil in the Imperium, how have those functions changed over time, and
what functions have been added or dropped historically?  What was the
role of the noble class in the Civil War?  Did Arbellatra\'s reforms
affect the noble class, and, if so, how?  How do the tensions between
local autonomy and central authority play out, and where do the nobles
fit?

> How much should be devoted to life at the Imperial court? 

Not much, although some background nuggets would add flavor.  

Here is my view on the historical development of the nobility (in answer
to one of the burning questions):

The noble class arose from the military and naval governors sent by the
conquering Terrans to manage parts of the collapsed Ziru Sirka.  Those
proconsuls, out of communication with the capital and on largely their
own for very long periods of time, decided to assume total control,
including control over their succession.  They accordingly followed
Terran models of hereditary nobility.  

No doubt there was communication among the Terran governors about
whether this was a good and defensible idea; it certainly constituted
mutiny to the extent that naval and military officers were assuming
total local control and passing on their power to their kin or chosen
successors, rather than retiring through military channels.  

So sometime during the Rule of Man, a noble class comprising Terran
naval and military officers (and probably some civilian appointees) came
into existence and imposed itself on the empire.  

Did the Vilani have a concept of a noble class that could accommodate
and assimilate this new development?

During the Long Night, the nobility acquired even more local control and
formed little empires of their own.  Many Vilani assumed Solomani names
and made themselves into nobles.  

When Cleon formed the Third Imperium, he had a pre-existing noble class
in the newly acquired territories that he could use.  He would offer
continuation of the status quo and support if they would offer fealty,
taxes, and troops.

I agree.  Although Wizards/Warriors are useful to newbies and for NPCs, I\'d 
much rather see a true sourcebook instead.  I _would_ like to see the 
stats/writeups for a sampling of "official" nobles (Strephon and Norris 
come to mind...) for use as NPCs, but I wouldn\'t make that the focus of the 
book.  Maybe a dozen at most, with some "important" canon nobles and some 
"generic" barons and knights.

Also potentially useful would be some noble templates.

>How much

Lots.  And not just at Imperial court, what\'s life at the Archducal court 
in the Marches like?  How about at the court of a sector Duke?  A local Baron?

>  What burning questions

How many nobles are there (both absolute and as a ratio to populace).  Are 
Imperial barons one to a planet or are there a dozen in every government 
building?  Just what positions require/grant noble title?

What, you mean like the spaceships in the Starship Troopers movie?  Where 
the ships are so closely packed that to avoid ground fire they dodge and 
crash into each other?  Remember, space is _really_ small!  It\'s only one

I already know what damage a Minuteman RV , a Davy Crocket missile and a

Why?

If the ship is regarded as a \'base\' rather than a \'vessel\' (reasonable
considering their size and missions) then what\'s wrong with family
housing?

I\'m working on a map/write-up for the world Velscur (1110 Egyrn/Trojan
Reach, X374379-3 Ni 302 Na F9 VI) and I have some questions. I\'m picturing
the world as approaching tidal lock, with a rotation period of several
decades.  This means the locals have to keep moving to remain in the
habitable zone, but they can manage it even with their primitive tech. 
So... 

1. How do I calculate temperatures on the surface of such a world?  I
tried the formulae in "Grand Survey" for tidally locked worlds (same as in
WBH, I believe) but they give me a "cold pole" temp of only -60 degrees
Celcius or so, if I\'m doing it right.  The formula says maximum cooling
due to night-time is (Base+273)  *.15 for this world, giving me something
like -50 (assuming a Base mean temp of around 10).  Add the latitude
change of about -20 and I\'ve got -70. If the planet\'s mean temp is 10 or
so, I get only -60 for the pole that\'s spent 50 years in darkness.  What
am I missing?

2. I want a mean temp that\'s low enough that the "twilight band" will be
uninhabitable.  Otherwise the inhabitants would just live at the north and
south poles.  What\'s a good distance for this from an F9 VI?  Can I assume
that the planet\'s mean temp will be found at the twilight band in general?
Something tells me there\'s going to be a sinusoidal relationship that I\'m
missing...

Any thoughts on these or other aspects of my idea are welcomed.

The joke is that "Follow Me!" is actually only the motto of the

A Court-Martial can be conviend for any breach of law or duty.  Getting a

I have had the honor of sitting in the pilot\'s seat of a C-141 in flight.
It is amazingly complex.  The number of dials, gauges, switches.. and this
is on a fairly modern cargo bird!

People with the Right Stuff are rare.. it\'s hard to make people pilots,
because we\'re not flying creatures.  So why waste pilots as riflemen when

It seems to me that Varian might also represent the Kenny-principle.

Since we all know that the Vilani are obsessed with their shugilii,
clearly Archduke Ishuggi is the Traveller avatar of Chef.

0.0001 parsec (20.6 AU) is a more "covenient" figure to work with. :-)
And I could argue that at 0.001 pc (206 AU) is still "in system".

parsecs  AU        light
- ----  ----  ----
0.00001    2.06     17.2 min
0.0001    20.6       2.86 hr
0.001    206         1.19 day
0.01       2.06 k   11.9 days
0.1       20.6 k   119 days 
1        206 k       3.26 years

So at 0.001 pc, you can still send a radio message and get a reply
faster than you can send a ship. At 0.01 pc, round trip time for a
radio signal is 23.8 days, which is well above the time for a jump out
and a jump back. 

So 7 light days is the point where it gets just as fast to jump a ship
as to send a radio signal. That\'s 1209.6 AU or 0.00586 pc (1/170 pc). 

So it looks like 0.005 or 0.001 pc for a "reasonable cutoff".

But as noted in another message, at 206 AU (sorry the 203 was a faulty
memory) the place is still faster to *communicate* with. Less than 3
days round trip time for a radio or lasercomm message.

Anybody have a downloadable database of *extragalactic* objects,
complete with positional co-ordinates? I\'d also be interested in
positional data for *bright* intragalactic objects and strong radio
sources. Basically, the sort of stuff you\'d use to determine your
position if you were *really* lost. As in "Are we sure what galaxy we
are in?"

If nothing else, generating a table of usable "beacon stars" that are
visible (or radio detectable) clear across "known space" would be nice.

BTW, as I pointed out in r.a.sf.s some time back, any sort of "jump"
drive with *real* range is just as apt to drop you out several
*megaparsecs* away as several parsecs. Which makes for some lovely
problems in navigation. 

The *only* SF story I\'ve ever read that used this idea was "The Galaxy
Primes" by E.E.Smith. And he sort of cheated to let them find their way
home. 

That could be an interesting thing to do to some players if you are
getting tired of the standard background. Have them test a "new"
concept in jump drives. Something that they inventor says is so
"obvious" he can\'t understand why no one ever tried it before. 

The answer is that most races *have* found it and tried it. And then
written it off as a bad idea when none of the test ships ever came
back. They never came back because until you can "calibrate" the drive,
it jumps you at *random*. And since it has a range big enough to hit
anywhere in the universe, random is *really* random.

If you want to be *really* realistic, have the first jump land them
somewhere in one of the Voids. Careful observations with the *good*
telescope they brought along (they expected to be lost, just not *this*
lost), will let them pick out the patterns of galaxies surrounding the
Void. The nearest ones may be only a *billion* parsecs away. They might
even be able to detect a few red dwarfs that are floating alone in the
Void. Still far out of normal jump range, much less being reachable
under normal drive ("No, we can\'t go into cold sleep to try for one,
there\'s no way the low berths will run for anything *close* to a
million years..." :-)

When that sinks in, the players are going to be *really* unhappy. Be
nice. Let the next jump take them near *something* they can refuel at. 
And then either there, or at the next jump let them discover a
civilization. It can even have humans, descendants of humans from other
human groups that invented and tested the drive millenia ago. As well
as species from far distant galaxies (ie you get to invent new races). 

BTW, this could explain why the Vilani never got past J2. They came up
with this drive instead, and after fooling with it for a few centuries
gave up.

In any case, it\'s a hell of a way to get folks into a new background. :-)

Personally, I would like to see some information on how the Imperial
government actually operates. Specifically, how Imperial feudalism works
with the incorporation of a thoroughly post-feudal military and a laissez
faire economic doctrine.

I wouldn\'t mind seeing what life in the Imperial court might be like, as
well. I\'m not a big fan of the idea of having a big book filled with NPCs.

    'body' => 'Most of Steven\'s suggestions for GT:Nobles have to do with order:

1. how a world or cluster is brought into the Imperial nobility.
2. how nobility is gained (types of nobility).
3. how nobility is organized within classes.
4. how nobility interacts between classes.

These are valid issues; however, what are you going to do
with the REST of the book?  Moreover, though these questions
are unanswered by \'canon\', I think knowing a \'definitive\' answer
does not improve the overall playability of Traveller.  So I tend
to not be so worried about unanswered quesions like those above.

What lights my fire is Adventure.  So what does a noble have
that is geared toward adventure?  I suggest that there are
a set of core ideas that the book could build itself around,
which can generate many a fruitful night of gaming.  Of course,
the book would concentrate on the noble as Adventurer rather
than Patron.


1. Sabotage.  Prestige is gained by sabotaging the unsabotageable
with one\'s own team, led by oneself.  Mission: Impossible.
("Just to show I can prevent it").

2. Defiance.  Power is concentrated: a noble can gain prestige
with open defiance of some strong opponent.  For example, the
very existence of the Federation of Arden is a defiance of Imperial
and Zhodani political, economic, and military power.  Obviously
connected with some noble houses somewhere, whose raw power
and connections enables them to do this. ("Just because we can")

3. The Gambit.  Nobles thrive on overcoming impossible odds,
even to the point of sacrificing safety for a chance of a more excellent
outcome.  Just so, then, will some nobles attempt impossible tasks
with as few competetive resources as possible.  Of course, what
resources they have will be the best Imperial Credits can buy.

4. The Hunt.  Call it "Scouts on drugs", where a noble decides to
play Scout and makes a beeline for some interdicted, uncharted,
or non-Imperial world in order to "discover something".


Add to this the complexity of dealing with contacts, favors, and
bureaucracy to line up all the ducks, and fire away!


For resources, Jens has the right idea: a yacht design and a sample
estate map would be useful.  By the bye, don\'t forget to make the
yacht a fine vessel, something nobles would WANT to pay big
bucks for.  And the best sensor package available for 200dtons, ok?

I thought she *succeeded*? Given the way copyright law works, it\'s
pretty simple for the copyright holder to pull *that* off. Preventing
it from being shown would be very difficult, and damned expensive. But
demanding that the remove reference to the "original idea" because
they\'ve screwed it over badly is pretty much a "gimmee".

It won\'t even take that. Just enough footage of *real* spacecraft going
by each other in utter silence. After all, it\'s not that the ships are
*quiet*, it\'s that you can\'t hear the noises from another ship onboard
your ship.

Try these on for size. In the episode that convinced *me* to quit
watching it, they took off from earth in their cute little "fighter
jet" clones, and rendezvoused with a carrier *near Jupiter*. 

Jupiter is 5.2 AU from the sun. Let\'s be nice and assume it and earth
are as close as they ever get and thus the trip is *only* 4.2 AU.
That\'s 630 million km. Boosting at 1 g until halfway, then turning
around and decelerating would take almost 6 *days*. No way are those
cockpits livable for *one* day, much less six.

To reduce the trip time to 1 day requires an acceleration of around 8.5
gees. Which is far too high to sustain for that long (remember, they
don\'t have inertial compensation). 

Next, we have them expecting an enemy attack that will pass near
Jupiter. So they hide in the Trojan asteroids. Unfortunately, the
Trojan asteriods are 5.2 AU away from Jupiter! Same orbit, but
leading/trailing by 60 degrees.

The Trojans may have a lot more asteroids per unit of volume than the
asteroid belt, but they *still* aren\'t as crowded as they showed.

They had Jupiter showing a visible disk from the Trojans. Sorry, it\'s
as far from them as from Earth.

They had the fighters boost to intercept trajectory and then coast to
intercept the enemy. Good idea, but again, the sheer *scale* means
they\'d be in the fighters way too long. 

Now, we have them headed more or less *at* the enemy "formation", with
velocities such that they were able to reach intercept in only hours.
Yet when the formations pass through each other, the ships are able to
keep firing at each other (visually!) for a minute or more!

And to top it off, the fighters are able to turn around and come back
for a second pass in only a minute or so. 

Oh yeah, the enemy force was moving at a speed that would let them
attack earth within "hours" of passing Jupiter.

In short, they had *no* idea of the distances involved, nor of the
velocities that those distances require. No sense of the *scale* of
space.

Nobels can be an interesting campaign setting, and solve some issues.

1. A Scandel at court campaign, drawing insparation on the Roman Senate, The Sun
King Court (al la Three Musketeers), and British Parlement. Mainly usable IMHO
as a freeform (live action) session. It will also outline the possable factions
in the Court (Hawkes , Doves, Expansionists, Pro and Anti Solomani et al)

2. Nobles in the Imperium.

What are the roles of Nobles. Are they judges, adminstrators or parasites using
taxes to fund their extravigent lifestyles. What are the rights and privliges of
nobels, and what are their responsabilities. Are they required to spend some
portion of their time at Core, or do they use Proxies?

3. Nobles as PC\'s. The diference between (using British system) Life and

Hey, now, to us electronic warfare types, sigs are far better alive than 
dead (\'keep talkin\', bubba, I just locked your TOC [tactical operations 
center]. BWA-HA-HA-HAAAAAAA!\'). My personal favorite trick when I couldn\'t 
nail their exact location was to have artillery fire a smoke round near 
where I knew a unit was hiding and then waiting for a report(them: "Sir, 
reporting enemy smoke round 500 meters to my south" Me: "adjust 5 north, he, 
time on target, fire for effect"). Bummer was, the radioman usually bought 
it, too. So, if they\'re talking leave them alone - one yap-happy radioman is 
worth 20 spies any day.

Not if they\'re talking on encrypted signals...which in Trav terms is a
given.

Heck, today, I think it\'s a given. I do know that my room mate in \'83 or
so was working on the software for the truck-based comms switches; all of
their signals were being encrypted continuously. Since Then I\'d assume
they\'ve extended that encryption all the way to the ends of the line.

Doug, you seem to me to be a bright guy, and I assume that you have had some
experience with watching film and television, as well as reading books.
So...

...why did you ever get your hopes up in the first place? ;)

First, a disclaimer: I\'ve never made it a secret that I think that Starship
Troopers was, at best, a mediocre book. I personally think that Heinlein has
written aesthetically and intellectually better books. I\'m not going to
comment on the aesthetics of the book nor am I going to comment on the
aesthetics of the movie. I\'m also not going to comment on the business of
the medium of print or the medium of film.

With that said, let me put this bluntly: Starship Troopers, as written,
would not translate into a "good" movie.

Keep in mind that I\'m not talking about box office receipts nor am I talking
about aesthetics here. Starship Troopers, the book, deals mainly with
abstract concepts (justice, freedom, and civic duty leap to mind), and how
those concepts relate to each other. The powered armor, the bugs, the
skinnies, the ships, these are all (as a GURPS book might say) "special
effects".

Film and television[1] have certain limitations which make both types of
media *terrible* at dealing with abstract concepts. At best, a movie like
The Thin Red Line is produced, in which case divergence from the source
material, in one way or another, is still *absolutely required* to get even
a *fraction* of the ideas in the book across.

To put it another, simpler, way: print and film / television are so
different that simple translation between them is not possible. Good books
are good books for completely different reasons than good movies are good
movies.

In other words, don\'t get your hopes up again! ;)

[1] I\'m including television for the simple reason that it is a known fact
among directors that their films will be released on video. It is obvious
from the way shots are set up in movies that this is something which
filmmakers take into account. If you don\'t believe me, rent out a
pan-and-scan (non-letterboxed) version of Ghostbusters, and any pan-and-scan
movie made after about 1990 or so. Pay careful attention to the extremely
annoying panning when all four Ghostbusters are on screen conversing, and
then look at the way more recent movies tend to clump all of the action or
conversation into a conveniently small area on the screen.

You are apparently unaware that "nova" is a word in Spanish. And it
doesn\'t mean anything *like* "won\'t go". New? Something like that.

Alas, too many people failed to grasp the concept that the DC-X was a
prototype and thus *intended* to be "tested to destruction". So when it
tipped over and burned after a landing, they thought it was a
*setback*. 

This led to lack of support for the larger DC-Y prototype, and to the
Delta Clipper being bypassed for the X-33 candidate. <sigh>

I hope that *someone*, somewhere can drag together the funding to get
the DC-Y built anyway, and to go from it to the actual Delta Clipper
vehicle. If only to keep NASA "honest". 

Hell, if I won one of those XXX million dollar lotteries, I\'d drop a
few million.

Heck, get Bill Gates to fund development so he\'ll have his own private
spaceship. Once he gets his, they can build more for other folks. 

Meanwhile, one of these days I\'ll dig up a copy of a *recent* set of
design rules and put numbers on my designs for a Scout and a Free
Trader based on the Delta Clipper VTOL spaceship design. 

The bridge will be under a hemisphere at the nose. Lots of visibility
when you are landed, except close to the ship. And a few cameras fix
that. Also nice for taking "star sights" in space, or for doing a 360
degree "heads up display" of where other ships are in relation to you. 

As I recall, there was enough room for *two* accesses, one via a
"ladder" and through a harch in the "center" of the bridge, the other
via a curved staircase/ramp that comes up near the edge.

Engineering will be cylinder in the center of the ship, going up from
the base. Holds and fuel will be arranged around it. Cabins will be on
the deck or decks between holds/engineering and the bridge. And there
will be some fuel storage on these decks also between the angle of the
hull and the walls of the corridors/living area. 

Probably two airlocks. One big one on the lowset deck, accessing the
hold (and air raft if carried), one on the iupper deck, for personnel
only. If you use thrusters, a third one in the "bottom" of the ship,
leading directly into engineering is possible.

Ah, yes - but they are still emitting a signal from a specific loction, 
friend. Tactically, that alone is a goldmine; location, speed and direction 
of movement, power of the transmitter. Analyze a wide spectrum and try to 
determine levels of command vis a vis radio traffic then determine tactical 
command units and strategic communications assets.... Ah, I love sigint. 
Just ask Black ICE.

Well, I\'d read the fine print in the NAFTA treaty before I got *too*

Lifting ideas is *usually* not actionable. Unless you can get a court
to agree that said ideas as expressed in *your* work as "derivative
works" from *his* work. 

And in a world where Lotus won that "look & feel" lawsuit, I\'d be

<snip>

Just to make it plain, I never paid to see that film.  The first time I saw
it all the way through was at a convention.  I had heard all the horrid
reports from the set.  No power armor, no political text at all.  Just
Verhooven, whose idea of a subtle statement is to only empty two mags into
a body, instead of four.

But if you are going to so completely destroy a man\'s book (not one of his
best, I\'ll agree, but one that was a big influence on my decision to join
the Army) with the casual air he gave it..  ick.

Ever see the "Unplanned Battle Damage Test" video?  A series of odd factors
led to a buildup of hydrogen on one side of the DC-X as it was readied for
a test.  When the engines lit, hydrogen did what it does best.

Of course, nobody in the control room knew about this until somebody stuck
his head in their trailer and told them "pieces of your spaceship are
falling off."

Hit the Big Red Panic Button!  DC-X immediate scans the ground for a level
spot, goes into descent mode, and locks its legs.  Perfect landing.   With
a pretty big hole in the side.  Damn, I love that ship...

Nuevo.  Pronounced differently from No Va.  It has three syllables.  Nova
is of course Latin for new.

You\'re making the assumption that television and film will attempt to
accurately reflect reality. Even common, every day objects, such as cars are
imbued with qualities that they don\'t have on television and in film. Sure,
if you\'re Stanley Kubrick you can get away with a more realistic view of
spacecraft, but there was little action outside the spaceship which it would
matter whether or not there was sound.

That\'s an entirely different notion than space combat scenes on film and
television. Silence doesn\'t add to the drama of space combat, just like cars
that just sit there after they crash into a bus don\'t add drama to a high
speed car chase The only way that space combat will ever be shot to be shown
without its own *vrooms* and *booms* is if a director has a musical score
made which highlights all of the *vrooms* and the *booms* on screen.

I would wager you that there will continue to be *vrooms* and *booms*, even
if space travel becomes so commonplace that the majority of people are
familiar with it.

I would wager that, but I won\'t, since I don\'t think either of us will live
long enough to see a day when space travel is that common...

Well, based on the formula you just gave, 273*Kelvin* + 10*Celcius* => 283K
* 0.15 = 42.45 Kelvin, or -230.55 Celcius. A tad chillier than your first
result... or have I missed something (I don\'t have WBH of GS...yet... to
check)

Me too!

I mean, amen.  Couldn\'t agree more.  However, if you\'re working on stuff
that may see print, it\'s perhaps a bit more to be expected that the
hypothetical publishers would be more cautious.  That\'s the problem with
the "Vilani Sourcebook" project that\'s been floating around on the
TravCult list.

Depends how you take DGP material, but the Primordials are detailed 
in the GDW supplement \'Knightfall\' and are a good potential 
\'Ancient\'. But perhaps they\'ve all gone beyond the Rim <B5>...

ISTR that the referee\'s section of the library data suggested that 
Yaskodray had kept careful count of his descendents, sorry, victims, 
but when AM bombs and planet busters are being used it\'s probable 
that one of them could have escaped without trace... Unless 
Grandfather warred with total surprise attacks...

The Atari STFM had the same recommendation (drop onto desk from 10 cm

Possibly, but it depends whether Marc etc generated the name first. 
Or does it fall under the names and \'concepts\' licence from GDW?  It 
doesn\'t appear to be in AM1.

Depends how long we\'ve been around ;-)

Another good Christmas present for Traveller/SF junkies is 
\'MagBlast!\' by Fantasy Flight Games - it\'s a self contained game 
where you each take an alien race from the Twilight Imperium 
universe, and blow the hell out of each other\'s fleet until you kill 
their flagship. Really simple, and supports up to 6 players, and 
*isn\'t* a CCG. Recommended for some great fun (it hooked the BITS 
team at GenCon 99).

The original was a low volume (compared to the 101s) print run as it 
was >80 pages in length (and a nightmare to fold). I know we sold the 
last two stock copies at GenCon UK 99, and that the new edition is in

At Close Quarters, 101 Patrons and The Traveller Bibliography (2nd 
Edition).

I have a copy, but it\'s my own.... contact me off list if you want to 
discuss this.

Dom

BTW - If you have a BITS edition of \'the Long Way Home\' without 
signatures it should be worth more *as there are only a couple in 
existance*. Everyone wanted signed copies!

It was in \'The Long Way Home\' in the \'Marks of Weakness\' scenario. 
P54 of the BITS edition. The Aslan are either referred to as 
\'Furballs\' (by the humans) or \'Fteirle\' (by themselves).

I saw it immediately after reading the book, and was impressed by the 
CGI and hated the adaption. I\'ve seen it since, but have disconnected 
the reasoning part of my brain before I watch it, which makes it nice 
eye candy.

Without the PoW sub-plot, why didn\'t they just nuke Lendathu from 
orbit in the film, and what happened to air support and armour?

Not only that -- I would like to see some noble families fleshed out. Not
single nobles as characters, but maybe several notable families described,
and one in detail.

The game rules are basically the same as those in the GDW Terran/Ziru 
Sirka wargame \'Imperium\', except the Imperium board is fixed and the 
game more cyclic (stop/start) to simulate the Interstellar wars.

Apparently, Imperium is about to be re-released - I can\'t remember 
who by though? Anyone on sfconsim-l remember who?

Wait for "SpaceDogs II". Set ten years after "SpaceDogs" our heroes

Well, the BITS Traveller Fun Tournament at GenCon UK 99 was \'Starship 
Marines in Battledress\', a blend of Starship Troopers, MiB, hints of 
South Park, a large twist of Famille Spofulam and Red Dwarf. Shame we 
can\'t print them and sell it...

You know there\'s a good reason for the year 0...

and in the UK, public schools are privately owned and run.

The nearest word I can find in my dictionary is \'novato\' which is 
inexperienced/beginner. Aren\'t there some native speakers on the list 
who could help? Carlos?

And the \'no va\' issue *is* the reason that Vauxhall UK\'s Marketeers

I used to know someone who worked as a tech for them. Up until recently
the techs had to work *mandatory* overtime. Average workweek was 60
hours. 

Why? Because to save money they\'d laid off most of the *original* tech
staff, and paying overtime is cheaper than providing benefits to new
employees. 

Of course, this overlooks little details like "burnout". 

The Oregon *and* Washington Public Utility Commissions (PUCs) are
getting on US West for poor service, including things like taking
months to install new lines or weeks to fixed bad lines.

Not really. Ming was a lot of things. But he wasn\'t *tacky*. And *that*

    COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS

    Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on
    studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests. Units are MKS unless
    otherwise noted; impact energy is sometimes expressed in nuclear bomb
    terms (kilotons TNT equivalent) due to the origin of the model.

    D = Sg Sp Kn W^(1/3.4)
	Crater diameter, meters. On Earth, if D > 3 km, the crater is
	assumed to collapse by a factor of 1.3 due to gravity.

    Sg = (ge/gt)^(1/6)
	Gravity correction factor cited for craters on the Moon. May hold
	true for other bodies. ge = 9.8 m/s^2 is Earth gravity, gt is
	gravity of the target body.

    Sp = (pa/pt)^(1/3.4)
	Density correction factor for target material relative to the Jangle
	U nuclear crater site. pa = 1.8e3 kg/m^3 (1.8 gm/cm^3) for alluvium,
	pt = density at the impact site. For reference, average rock on the
	continental shields has a density of 2.6e3 kg/m^3 (2.6 gm/cm^3).

    Kn = 74 m / (kiloton TNT equivalent)^(1/3.4)
	Empirically determined scaling factor from bomb yield to crater
	diameter at Jangle U.

    W = Ke / (4.185e12 joules/KT)
	Kinetic energy of asteroid, kilotons TNT equivalent.

    Ke = 1/2 m v^2
	Kinetic energy of asteroid, joules.

    v = impact velocity of asteroid, m/s.
	2e4 m/s (20 km/s) is common for an asteroid in an Earth-crossing
	orbit.

    m = 4/3 pi r^3 rho
	Mass of asteroid, kg.

    r = radius of asteroid, m

    rho = density of asteroid, kg/m^3
	3.3e3 kg/m^3 (3 gm/cm^3) is reasonable for a common S-type asteroid.

    For an example, let\'s work the body which created the 1.1 km diameter
    Barringer Meteor Crater in Arizona (in reality the model was run
    backwards from the known crater size to estimate the meteor size, but
    this is just to show how the math works):

	r = 40 m	    Meteor radius
	rho = 7.8e3 kg/m^3  Density of nickel-iron meteor
	v = 2e4 m/s	    Impact velocity characteristic of asteroids
				in Earth-crossing orbits
	pt = 2.3e3 kg/m^3   Density of Arizona at impact site

	Sg = 1		    No correction for impact on Earth
	Sp = (1.8/2.3)^(1/3.4) = .93
	m = 4/3 pi 40^3 7.8e3 = 2.61e8 kg
	Ke = 1/2 * 2.61e8 kg * (2e4 m/s)^2
	   = 5.22e16 joules
	W = 5.22e16 / 4.185e12 = 12,470 KT
	D = 1 * .93 * 74 * 12470^(1/3.4) = 1100 meters

    More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):

    Asteroid	    Number of Impact probability  Impact energy as multiple
    diameter (km)   Objects    (impacts/year)	    of Hiroshima bomb
    ----   ---- ----  ----
     10			10	 10e-8		    1e9 (1 billion)
      1		       1e3	 10e-6		    1e6 (1 million)
      0.1	       1e5	 10e-4		    1e3 (1 thousand)

    The Hiroshima explosion is assumed to be 13 kilotons.

    Finally, a back of the envelope rule is that an object moving at a speed
    of 3 km/s has kinetic energy equal to the explosive energy of an equal
    mass of TNT; thus a 10 ton asteroid moving at 30 km/sec would have an
    impact energy of (10 ton) (30 km/sec / 3 km/sec)^2 = 1 KT.

That\'s quite true, such units did have a higher rate
of firers than line infantry units - but still, it
wasn\'t 100%. They had a higher rate because they were
better trained, firing at silhouettes of men instead
of just targets, so that when they saw a figure,
they\'d fire.

The Army has learned to condition you to kill - but
not how to make you feel good about it afterwards.

If you read the Grossman book I referred you to,
you\'ll see that time in combat (like the sergeant you
mention) has no affect on whether you fire or not.
Also, neither does the situation, by which I presume
you mena that anyone will fire if their life depends
on it, if a screaming bayonet-weilding maniac is
charging towards you. You\'d think it\'s true, but it\'s
not. Many people would rather die than kill. Ask themn
before the battle, and they\'ll say, "of course I\'d
kill," but when faced by the reality, they\'re more
reluctant. I could give instances, but I\'ll settle for
a personal instance, and then leave it to the book,
which is far more scholarly and knowledgeable than I
could ever be.

Over in Somalia we had pretty scrict rules of
engagement, that we couldn\'t fire unless fired upon,
or unless they were pointing their weapons directly at
us and wouldn\'t put them down when called upon to stop
(ie just like cops). A section from my platoon was on
patrol and spotted a couple Somali lads fleeing from
the patrol, looking suspicious. As it was a crowded
market place the patrol couldn\'t pull out their
weapons and start shouting, so they approached the
men, the scout put his hand on one man\'s shoulder and
spun him around. The man shoved a Sterling
submachinegun into the Aussie\'s belly and pulled the
trigger. Click. It turned out later the round was
hardstruck (which happens to less than 1 in 100,000
rounds). Now the Aussie was perfectly justified within
the rules of engagement, aussie military and civilian
law, and basic common sense, in shooting this guy.
Instead, he buttstroked him with his rifle and
disarmed him.

"He was sensible, he used minimum force," you might
say. But bear in mind that this soldier\'s _training_
was to kill, and we went over there actually expecting
a conventional war, that\'s what we were briefed for.
But what this story demonstrates is that if given any
other option, most men will not kill.

Sorry to do anything to risk your pride in your
"elite" units, but I still think there would have been
a majority of non-firers. 

The proportion rose due to training methods from 10%
to 95% from WWII to Vietnam, and Grossman\'s thinking
is that this is the true cause of PTSD: not what has
been done to you, but what you have done.

ObTrav: this will be more so in the future, since the
intensity of operations will be greater, the
battlefiled larger, more dangerous, and louder than
before (the progression that has occurred throughout
the centuries). How does the Imperium treat its burned
out soldiers? Its retured soldiers? Once full-time
service appeared, nations ahd to provide pensions etc,
since a group of disgruntled ex-servicemen who only
know how to fight can be a problem....

I would have, too. I finally rented the damn thing, and was appalled.
Complete waste of money, IMHO. I wish they\'d had more Buffy videos to
rent, instead.  It inspired me to re-read "Starship Troopers" for the
first time in 15 years, so not a total loss, I guess.  I was really
p-o\'d after re-reading the book, because the movie seems to have been
a systematic attempt to destroy the book.  Dialog and themes and imagery
were subtly used to distort and twist the message of the book 180 degrees
to the opposite; it was too systematic to be directorial incompetence--
he was trying to trash the whole philosophy of the book, or at least
make sure no one would read it who had any sympathy for the ideas therein.
That film is evil.

_Jurassic Park_ will be the classic example of a movie that changed
a popular stereotype.  Pre-JP, almost all RPG supplements (and prolly
movies & TV) said things like "we know scientists think that dinosaurs
were really agile critters who didn\'t wallow in swamps, but the
traditional image is that they\'re slow behmoths that soak in swamps
like they were hot tubs, so we\'re writing up our dinosaurs with the
traditional abilities, because it will be more \'fun\' that way".

Post-JP, slow hot-tub wallowers look so damn fake, and would get
laughed out of any RPG session I was in.  (Slow, stupid dinosaurs
are more "fun" & "exciting" than being chased down by a pack of
ravenous raptors? Come again?) The public perception of
dinosaurs has changed, thanks to Jurassic Park.

It won\'t take real space travel, just a really good movie to 
change public perception.  Face it, spaceships didn\'t bank in
space or go "whoosh" until AFTER "Star Wars". (BTW, in the Star
Wars game, they have an explanation for that--the "whoosh" is
actually a sensor queue to the pilot that he\'s got other vehicles
in close proximity--apparently, in the Star Wars universe they\'ve
done some major work on using all 5 senses to overcome the "visual
overload" problem modern fighter pilots have...)

What the hell army were you shooting at? We\'d never have bothered using 
a radio for that. If your superior HQ is far enough away that you need 
a radio to talk to them they\'re no use to you unless they\'ve got a way 
of getting rid of whoever dropped the smoke on you. Some people have 
too much technology, that\'s their problem.

Not entirely. His exact, statistical evidence is based
on WWII/Korea, but apocryphal evidence from other wars
support his contention.

For example, the Prussian army tested its units\'
marksmanship in 1808. They found that a battalion
(1,000 men, then) would score 60% hits at 100 yards on
another battalion-sized target (ie a piece of wood 6
ft high and a couple hundred feet long). Since they
could fire a maximum of three round per minute each,
you\'d expect thus 1800 rounds per minute impacting on
the target battalion. And so, two battalions fighting
each-other should anhiliate each-other, or cause one
side to break and run, within a minute.

In fact, only one or two men every minute would fall
over.

"Well," you say, "men being fired on don\'t fire so
accurately, the noise of muskets, the scream of shot,
the cries of wounded and dying comrades all will make
you a worse shot." I agree. So, let\'s say the\'re only
one-tenth as good as on the firing range. No, let\'s
say they were drunk, too, and only 1% as good. Would
you agree with that? Is that too generous? You still
then get 18 shots per minute hitting... Instead, we
get at best one-tenth as many as that.

Yes, the training was off for WWII and Korea. Yes,
it\'s been improved now. What\'s happened is that armies
have faced the fact that it\'s difficult to persuade
men to kill, and have learned to train them to do it.
I\'d agree that modern-day Rangers do have almost 100%
firers. But other armies, not so many will fire,
because of their different training. This is why 100
rangers were able to hold off 1000 Somalis in 1994:
less than 100 of those Somalis were actually aiming at
the Americans.

There is something innate in man to make him fight,
but there is also something innate in man to make him
reluctant to kill.

Should this surprise anyone? Consider the rest of the animal kingdom, in
which animals routinely scuffle over territory, breeding rights, etc. These
contests are rarely fatal. We have inherited this tendency, just like other
animals have (even the French).

Back to Traveller, however, there is no guarantee that the other non-human
species have this tendency. Watch out.

AFAIK, the director of the movie was a well known RAH-hater and considered 
RAH to be a Nazi.  Why this guy was picked to make the movie, I have no 
idea....

I also tend to believe that intense fire support from the "littlebird"
gunships helped keep the Somalis at bay, especially in the dark, when the
Rangers lacked their night vision gear.  That is if we are speaking of the
same incident.

Also, Delta force was orginially run through several test operations to see
if they would "shoot" when the moment came.  This type of training annoyed
the Delta Troopers, but it was done due to a very valuable lesson learned at
the Munich Olympics (?).This was that even highly trained soldiers won\'t
always shoot.   One of the German Snipers did not take his shot. That was
what lead to the athletes\' deaths.

So, I tend to agree that no matter how highly trained or motivated you are,
typically you would prefer not to kill another human being.  Now training
and reflex may be able to cut back on this tendency, but over all, most
troops aren\'t all that thrilled about killing.

ObTrav again, a friend of mine and I both read Grossman and spent some time
discussion the applications to sf gaming. Some not-to-serious thoughts.  

Grossman and others point out the "non-firers" situation does not apply to
aircraft or vehicle crews, as they are bombing/shooting at very long range
and/or destroying "hardware" or "structures" rather than people they can
see. Grossman also points out that most serious "non-firing" occurs when
you can see the face of your enemy. This is one reason why, especially in
pre-gunpowder battles, fleeing troops are massacred: it is easier to run
through or shoot an opponent in the back. (Of course, he\'s not defending,
which is another reason...)

In Traveller, troops often wear full-body combat armor or battledress.
They may also be using HUDs and fighting at night with thermal imaging or
Light intensification gear, HUDs, etc.  In short, they are watching a video
game and firing at faceless humanoid targets.  Would this increase "shoot
to kill" rates?

Testable issue:   do firing rates increase when humanoid troops engage
non-humanoids or robots?  

Not-so-serious thought:  Grossman\'s work obviously explains the situation
in STAR WARS.  Imperial Stormtroopers do not want to kill rebels, who are
obviously human, wearing either civilian dress or ordinary military
uniforms and open helmets.  On the other hand, rebels can easily kill
stormtroopers, who they can perceive as "faceless".  Stormtrooper accuracy
improves markedly when they are facing obviously non-human jawas or big
sandcrawlers...  Most Imperial Stormtroopers are simply firing into the air.

Ob-GURPS Trav issue:  Grossman\'s "natural warriors" are those who have the
Combat Reflexes advantage.  Anyone else should have 1/2 Acc bonus at best.

Well, one could argue that point that Vehoeven runs *much* more deeply than
that. I won\'t, because it\'s far afield and I don\'t really think it\'ll change
your opinion of the movie.

I wouldn\'t call it casual at all. It was obviously very deliberate.

Sort of true. There is the matter of an interview he did for a Dutch
magazine in which the interviewer was apparently a Heinlein fan and was
indignant because she heard that Heinlein\'s work might be ruined. Verhoeven
responded in typical Verhoeven fashion, and eventually chased her away by
calling her (if I remember correctly) a Nazi lesbian. I think a translated
version of the interview was put up on the list during the initial American
release of Starship Troopers. I may be wrong, though.

One of the flashpoints in that interview was whether or not the book
presented a fascist ideology[1]. If I remember correctly, the interviewer
had become very indignant on this issue. Verhoeven trumped her by saying
that he grew up in Nazi occupied Holland and that he knew damn well what
fascism looks like. My memory may be poor, but that\'s how I remember it.

On the other hand, I have spoken with the fellow who did a series of
interviews for Starlog with the crew of the film, specifically with the
producer and screenwriter. They maintained that Verhoeven actually liked the
book.

This is purely anecdotal, your own mileage may vary.

[1] This is a point which bugs Heinlein fans to no end. Some will argue the
point that a fascist ideology was no represented, and perhaps they\'re right.
I\'m not going to tapdance on that alligator tonight. What is interesting
though is that some Heinlein fans will back away and say that "The Master"
is merely presenting an interesting society with no ideological claims. This
position is on rather shaky ground, as most people who have even a passing
familiarity with Heinlein\'s works can attest to.

There is a third option, though. This option is that the book is an
extremely complicated exercise in irony where the nature of the society is
one that is *supposed* to be unpalatable to a large degree to hammer home
the issue of classical civic duty. This could very well be the case, as
Heinlein, in other works, seems to be extremely interested in the concept of
civic duty.

So, Doug (the SME on this by reason of contract to write GT:GF):

Do people in M:1120 refer to Imperial Marines as "jarheads"?

If so, do Imperial Army NCOs admonish their subordinates that "Marines
aren\'t \'jarheads\'; you can _put_ things in jars"?

IIRC he (and certainly others) also point to the fact that crew served 
weapons, like vehicles don\'t have the non-firer problem, as their is 
more of a collective responisbilty.

Are you guys kidding?  I\'ve been waiting for something like  this
since before the T4 version that never was ... back since  CT  in
fact.  And 128 pages  seems  short  to  do  justice  to  such  an
important aspect of the TU.

IMHO Traveller is 1 part Military, 1 part Merchant,  and  1  part
Noble.  We\'ve had plenty of military stuff  and  merchant  stuff,
but for Nobles its been mainly ad hoc articles.

Given that the Enterprise (any version) is/was primarily an exploratory
vessel, not a warship, ther compliment of combat-trained soldiers would
be negligible. I\'m thinking a closer analogy would be the Horatio
Hornblower stories. In which the captain (unlike, say, Picard...) wasn\'t
afraid to get his hands dirty.

Then you\'d have to deal with all those who insist that Star Fleet was
not a military organization. (Yeah, right. If that\'s the case, why
do they run the place like it *was* a military, complete with an 
academy, courts-martial, admirals in charge, ship weapons up the wazoo,
etc...?)

I\'m not entirely disagreeing with you here. But sometimes what is the
most "realistic" is not what works best on film / tv.

For the record: I *loved* Starship Troopers -- both the book (which I
first read in high school, over 20 years ago) and the movie.

<snipped further information concerning the same point>

Okay, fair enough, and point taken. First a question, how accurately is this
model when applied to troops with special forces training, such as the ones
portrayed in Saving Private Ryan? Second a point, unless I saw a different
movie, there were very few sequences (the ending sequence specifically) when
the "resolution" of the film was sharp enough that the audience could really
see the members of the group fighting close up. The opening D-Day scene
didn\'t attain such a resolution until the end, when the Americans were
exterminating the Germans in trenches. From my own reading on the subject, I
came away with the impression that this is pretty much what did happen after
Americans began to break through. Until the last sequence, the combats we
see don\'t have the kind of resolution that detailing such a thing would be
required.

On the other hand, my take on Upham (the translator) was a little bit
different. Upham\'s character is way too complex to be summed up in the word
"coward".

I so totally disagree that film-makers underestimate the intelligence of
film-goers. On one hand, the medium itself doesn\'t *lend* itself to
intelligence, but I\'ve already stated that once tonight. On the other hand,
I have had too many personal experiences with the American movie-going
public.

When I went to see Starship Troopers, one man stood up and commented, about
ten minutes into the movie and with *great* surprise, that the film was a
"...futuristic jaun" (Jaun: "joint", loose translation: thing, undertaking
or movie).

When I took my father to see Saving Private Ryan, there was a group of young
men seated in front of us. During the D-Day scene, they kept screaming, "Get
those f***in\' Japs! Get the Japs!" (my apologies for my uncouth language, no
offense is meant to anyone). At the end, one commented to his friends,
"Didn\'t I tell you it was a realistic movie about Vietnam?"

I kid you not.

When the Star Wars Special Edition came around, a friend of mine witnessed
one man stand, scream that it was "...the same *damn* movie," and storm out
of the theater.

Neither do I. Too much detail on a topic that I hardly ever need to
use in a game setting -- and there\'s enough detail in the existing
books for me to use as a framework and make up the rest as I need.

A court-martial is a military court, a trial held for *any* transgression
of military law, be it the unwarranted destruction of the planet Gamma
Reticuli VII or being drunk on duty. The series JAG has one in just about
every episode.

This is in the same line as hearing the General Lee (the car on the Dukes
of Hazzard) squeal its tires on dirt roads -- it\'s an acoustic cue for the
audience. (Probably so was Steve McQueen upshifting the gears on his car
in the chase scene in Bullitt -- 16 times.)

Not true. There is a distinct "whoosh" sound as the Enterprise
zips by the screen in the opening credits of the original Star
Trek series.

Notice how he was all black except for the big bright yellow logo in the 
middle of his chest?  This is for a reason - it encourages bad guys to 
shoot at his chest, where he has body armor, instead of at his head where 
all he has is a rubber mask.....

In addition to all the great comments so far (I especially liked Jon
Zeigler\'s list -- hear, hear!):

Top Suggestion: Combine GT: Nobles and GT: Diplomacy/Espionage into a
single, larger volume (144+ pages). Call it "GT: Intrigue" or some such:
all the high-touch (and sometimes high-tech) means of manipulating friends
and enemies alike to do your bidding, and obtaining the information it
takes to do so. Cf. Poul Anderson\'s Dominic Flandry books -- now *there\'s*
a Nobles campaign!

Other ideas:

(1) Gentlemen and Gentlewomen -- the near-nobility: business tychoons,
high-ranking officials that don\'t rate titles, military officers. How do
they rate in the Imperium? What is their relationship with the nobility?

(2) Noble Orders (cf. Supplement 11, p. 35) -- how many are there? what are
they? what function(s) do they serve (social, political, military,
subversive)? 

(3) Nobles\' and Gentlemen\'s Clubs (cf. _Flashing Blades_ by FGU, pp.
34-36)-- social organizations for the nobility and nearly-nobility. How
does one join? rise through the organization? what assets are available for
members?

(4) The Traveller\'s Aid Society -- the most famous and widespread
gentleman\'s club in the Imperium. Organization, history, assets, economics,
dirty secrets, you name it.

(5) Imperial Courts and the Imperial system of law (since I see this as
pretty much the purview of the nobility). Jurisdiction, jurisprudence on an
Imperial level, High Crimes and Misdemeanors, manorial rights, etc. Also
includes "internal" Diplomacy -- diplomatic relations with the member
worlds of the Imperium.

(6) Code Duello -- or why are all these nobles carrying silver inlaid
revolvers?

(7) Imperial Bureaucracy! the *real* power in the Imperium, and the natural
enemy and prey of Nobles. How is the Imperial government structured? what
are the various ministries, and how do they fight^h^h^h^h^h interact with
one another? All the weird ministries: Ministry of Justice, Ministry of
Colonization, the Imperial Monetary Board <fnord>. I see one of the primary
functions of Imperial nobles is to keep the  Bureaucracy in check, by
having the power to jump "channels" with impunity and take charge where
necessary.

Not too asinine. After all, they have "seven year
missions," don\'t they?
This is currently a problem for recruiters in the
military: women\'s liberation. In the "good old days,"
men only were in the military, and their wives
wouldn\'t have careers other than as mothers, so they
just follwed their men around to postings to obscure
and unpleasant places. And despite stories of "Dear
John" letters, most women did wait faithfully back
home for their husbands and boyfriends until they
returned from the wars.
Women\'s Lib has changed this. Women have their own
careers, and so when it comes time for a soldier to be
re-posted, she says, "hey, this will screw up my
career," and all too often, either the marriage or the
military career will end.
This I think is the real reason they\'re opening many
more jobs to women in the military: maybe soldiers
will become like civilian professions, and often marry
within their profession. Right now, they\'re not, so
much. They\'re just leaving.
The military currently has no solution to this.
However if in the future there is an interstellar
navy, and they go out for tours of years, I can
certainly imagine that families will be taken along.
Yes, they are in greater danger than staying back
home, but if you are a gunner on deck 223 and your
wife or husband is an engineer on deck 416, I daresay
you\'ll fight damned hard.

Those of us who want to SLEEP with Han Solo.  Guys like that always want
princesses.  (I\'ve played a lot of noble female PC\'s, some sexy/dangerous
like a Bond girl, some Princess Leia-ish... all popular with other PC\'s and
NPC\'s alike.)

The fact that there *has* to be atmospheric circulation (ie *weather*,
and some "climate") or else all the atmosphere will wind up in a big
stack at the middle of darkside, melting away on one side and building
up on the other as the planet slowly rotates.

Actually, any such figures are going to be a *guess* since we don\'t
*have* a planet with anything *close* to those specs to work with.

The north and south poles won\'t be much different in temp from anyplace
else along the teminator. But if you make the terminator unihabitable
what are they going to use for food? You can\'t grow anything on the
dark side. 

I suppose it\'d work if you made only the "hot pole" habitable.

Jason Barnabas <cybernaut@netzero.net> added:

Each Noble is a potential Patron, so something else that
might be very useful would be to add some "missions"
that they might be interested in hiring PC\'s to handle.

These "Patron Encounters" could help to acquaint the
PCs with some of the background information that they
would have no other way of learning.

Okay, let\'s add in a little ethical issue to make it really spicy.
This is also based upon a Real World(tm) case.

Let\'s say that if they get the Planetary Pass, they must waive
some of thier rights as an Imperial Citizen in order to use it.
What\'s more, if they use it to recieve the payment from the
Patron, its use can be used to show that they waived thier
rights and they cannot reclaim them if anything goes wrong
with the encounter and they must seek legal remedies
against the Patron.

This world would have a circumferance of 12,637 to
17,692 km.  If the period were only 20 years, they would
only have to travel at an average of just over 2 km per
day to stay comfortable.  Shoot, mice could do that and
still have time to cause trouble.  This should be a snap
for a nomadic people.  If the period is actually 50 years
as indicated below, they would only have to cover  0.220
to 0.308 km per day.

My guess, and it\'s only a guess, because I do not have
the "Grand Survey" text in front of me is that you have
mis-read the case.  If you are subtracting the result of the
formula from the base temperature, then I don\'t see how
you came up with your figures.  If the formula you quoted
above is actually the night side temperature (which
seems more logical to me), the you are way off.  If your
base is 10 and the formula is (Base + 273) x 0.15, then
the result is 283 x 0.15 = 4.245 Kelvin.  That\'s over
269 degrees below zero on Mr. Celsius\'s scale.

___________________________________________
I suspect that 10 degrees is too high.  Earth\'s average
temperature is only 15.  People can survive at
temperatures that are very low or very high, perhaps -25
to 50 degrees C.  However; most of us are most
comfortable at 20-22.

Earth has an average temp of 288.15 K (15 degrees C).
If you know the output of a F9 VI in comparison to Sol, the
formula you need is:
        R ^ 2 * 288.15 = (Base + 273.15)
where   R is the radius of the orbit of the planet in
            question in AU\'s
        Base is the average temperature of the planet in
            degrees C

Or put another way, R = sqrt((Base + 273.15) / 288.15).

I can\'t tell you how to calculate the damage, but I can tell
you how to calculate the kinetic energy.  Perhaps you can
calculate from that.

E = m / 2 * v ^ 2

All I know is that our (Cornell University) paintball team routinely beats

With the exception of TV newscasters, who *isn\'t* controversial? I\'ve been
meaning to read "On Killing," because a significant portion of the book is
devoted to television, video games and violence, which is something of a pet
project of mine. What interested me the most after reading reviews was that
he seems to support the "socialization" argument, which is the third road
not often taken in that ongoing debate, which usually boils down to emotion
filled cries of "ban the guns!" or "ban the shows / games!". I don\'t want to
start that debate again, I just wanted to give a little insight into one of
the reasons I\'ve seen him get torn apart.

With that being said, during Columbine, Grossman took his 15 minutes of fame
to appear on TV to support the more direct "cause and effect" position.

So a question for the folks who have read Grossman: Does he take the
socialization route, or does he take the more direct "cause and effect"
route? I am putting some books on my Christmas wish list, and this one might
go on it.

postings. I will not make the excuse of "Everybody\'s* doing it," I will
merely flagellate myself with copies of Starship Troopers, both the book and
the film, while I *vroom* through space in my Chevy Nova.

With my soul cleansed of the worst of my transgressions, I will begin a new,
long, and considerably more on-topic post, in which I hope to continue some
ideas that have been brought up in other threads and tie some of them
together in strange ways.

Before I begin, I\'d like to dedicate this post to Glenn "cos 90" St-Germain,
as I keep neglecting to send him email in our chain of off-list
correspondence. My apologies Glenn.

Now, on with the geekocity, I\'ll begin by laying the groundwork:

Recently, I have been introduced to (and I have devoured) Neil Postman\'s
excellent "Amusing Ourselves to Death", which is an excellent book that
deals with the effect of television on society. It hardly breaks the surface
of this subject, but it is an interesting introduction. Postman puts forth
the theory that the dominant medium in a society decides the form that
public discourse, everywhere, will take. The dominant medium shapes that
society\'s epistemology; it decides how knowledge *itself* is attained,
perceived and used.

This is not exactly a new theory. Anyone who has taken a look at the changes
in, say, American politics between the 18th century and the present day has
had to at least suspect that this to be the case. Anyone who has had even a
little experience with McLuhan and his intellectual heirs probably has been
introduced to some version of this idea. This has turned into something of a
hot topic lately, and from what I understand, a large number of academic
types have been discussing, debating, analyzing and working over this very
concept.

A really coarse summary goes something like this:

In the beginning, the dominant medium of communication was speech. There are
certain things that speech is good for, and certain things that speech is
terrible for. Speech is not a fantastic medium for science, math and
philosophy, for example. Speech is a fantastic medium for persuasion,
polarized discussions, and engaging narratives. One of the examples that
Postman uses is our current understanding of pre-literate law: Two parties
are brought before the tribal chief, and he searches his internal library of
proverbs, and attempts to come up with one that fits the situation at hand.

Then, writing comes along, and changes everything. At this point, all kinds
of things are possible which were previously impossible: rudimentary
science, the codification of laws, mathematics. Although Postman doesn\'t use
this example specifically, it\'s obvious that a new understanding of law
emerges. Now, it\'s possible to have laws which are set in stone, literally,
and the very concept of law goes in a completely different direction: If a
party is guilty of x, the punishment is y.

With the advent of the printing press, things really begin to take off, for
a large number of reasons. Now it\'s possible to really get things rolling in
science, mathematics, philosophy, politics. One of the things that print is
really quite good at is reasoned discourse, and reasoned discourse appears
in spades. Hell, it ushers in the Enlightenment, aka the Age of Reason! To
continue with the law theme, print redefines law yet again: With the ability
to disseminate cases and decisions across a wide area, there\'s a strong
shift toward precedent in law (Glenn: is precedent the right concept, or am
I missing the mark here?)

Postman goes through three more stages, telegraphy, photography and radio
(at least to some degree) before arriving at television. It goes without
saying that television has redefined politics, education, religion, music,
everything. That\'s what a shift in epistomology does. Law, at least to some
degree, changes again. Postman, writing in 1984, didn\'t have the benefit of
hindsight with regard to Rodney King, O.J. Simpson and Bill Clinton.
However, I don\'t think he was surprised by the way that they were handled.
In the opinion of many, at least in those cases, the concept of law has been
redefined yet again toward emotivist public opinion.

I\'m not going to go into current events and opinion-mongering here beyond
saying that television is a *really* frightening change. The short version
is that our public discourse is taking the form of television commercials.
Even print media has been influenced greatly by television, in both form and
content.

(The above may apply in varying degrees to the various countries that fellow
Travellers call home. In other words, YMMV)

Yep, now you crotchety ol\' codgers who want to see Traveller return to the
style of the LBB\'s have an argument, at least on a philosophical level. Of
course the economic counter-argument is extremely compelling! Maybe wargames
were victims of this epistemological shift, who knows. Actually, now that I
think about it, the rise of collectable trading card games and story and
picture-heavy RPGs makes a hell of a lot of sense.

Still, I didn\'t type all that merely to spit out a punchline and offer
ersatz commentary on the state of gaming. In case anyone is willing to take
the bait:

What does public discourse in the Traveller universe look like? What is the
dominant medium? What changes might appear as a result? Is this general
decline in the political arena one of the reasons for the fall of the Second
Imperium, and for the rise of the nobility in the Third Imperium?

To shift gears a bit, toward the end of Eric Hobsbawm\'s "The Age of
Extremes: A History of the World, 1914-1991"[1] he comments that as the
century draws to a close, certain supra-national entities are appearing to
fill in where democratic leadership seems to be failing (the recent
headline-making World Trade Organization, for example, the IMF, even NAFTA
and the European Union have non-elected bodies which are capable of deciding
certain sorts of policies). Is this the same kind of idea that leads to the
rise of the new nobility in the Third Imperium?

To give my own take, and hopefully start something of a discussion on what I
hope others find interesting as well:

I think that this might be an interesting direction for those of you who
want to justify the Imperial nobility beyond the traditional Asimovian
rationale (which usually appears something like, "well, a system of nobility
is really very efficient"). Perhaps the Imperium is the direct descendant of
an organization along the lines of the WTO ( or maybe the um... ITO:
Intergalactic Trade Organization?).

Maybe, the Imperium only rules the space between the worlds. This tends to
change the concept of the Imperium in a number of ways (even though the
slogan itself *is* canon). Such organizations are already starting to rule
the trade space between sovereign nations on earth. Under this model, the
Imperium becomes extremely remote and extremely distant, to the point of
being nearly invisible, even to the majority of interstellar travellers.

Now that I think of it, that\'s an interesting take on the Imperium.

I\'m stumped on the epistemological concerns of new media, but it\'s largely
because Traveller has been "hands off" about what they are. The Xboat
system, in a sense, is a "new medium". It\'s kind of like a strange mixture
between the telegraph and "a slow boat to China". Holographic projection
pops up in canon frequently. Outside of Traveller, in sci-fi in general, has
holographic projection been superannuated by "virtual reality", either in
forms like Star Trek\'s holodeck, Gibson\'s matrix, or Sterling\'s net?

What might various science-fiction media be good at? What might they be bad
at? I would think that holography will be something like a super-TV, doing
what TV\'s good at better, and do what TV\'s bad at worse. Maybe not though. I
don\'t know, that\'s why I\'d like to see other people chime in.

Damn. It\'s late.

Greetings Loren,
	My ideas are as follows:
	1) A general over look for each level of Noble rank from top to
bottom. (Job description, support staff)
	2) An NPC or two for each level of Noble rank.
	3) A chapter on the Imperial moot and its role in the Imperium.
(Right of Assassination)
	4) Data files on major NPC Nobles (The Royal family, Lucan,
Margaret, Norris, The Archdukes, ect...)
	5) A chapter for races that has nobles (Zhodane, Aslan, ect...)
	6) The use of clones by high Nobles.
	7) The historical rise of the Nobles in the Imperium.
	8) Nobles in the Navy or any other Imperial service.
	9) The unreconized Nobility of worlds vs. the Imperial Nobles
(i.e.: "Sorry sir, but the rank of \'King\' is not a noble title, so please
go to the back of the line.")
	10) Security for the Nobility, both in space and on planet.
	11) The secret use of psionics by Nobles. (if any)
	12) Political sucking-up to higher ranks.

I hope this will help you.

Just in case you didn\'t know, "jarhead" as a nickname for marine comes
from long before jars had screw threads. It\'s from back when *mules*
were referred to as "jarheads"!

So it\'s in effect comparing the marines with mules and not seeing any
significant differences. :-)

In all fairness, Robin (Dick Grayson) used to be a circus performer,

"loved". \'Cause it ain\'t around anymore... :-(

We *need* the DC-Y (half-scale?) and if it gets built and tested we
need the full scale operational Delta Clipper. 

BTW, given Traveller reaction drives, I think DC-X style VTOL landers
would be useful for contested pickups and the like. Any mines in the
landing area get detonated before the ship touches down. :-)

For that matter, unless you armor the hell out of them, no way are heat
seeking missiles going to be a problem (any missile that is both man or
"jeep" portable *and* that can survive going thru a fusion or HEPLAR
exhaust *deserves* to hit. :-)

I\'m thinking of stuff like documentary footage and the like. Even

They could start by radically re-writing the rules about
"fraternization". As it is, you can only *maybe* get involved with
someone of the *same* rank, but in a *different* unit. That\'s *way* too
restrictive if you want to keep people in. 

It\'s going to (eventually) have to become "anyone not in the same chain
of command" (ie you can\'t date someone you might be giving orders to on
a regular basis).

Well, we have *one* historical datapoint: The Theban "Sacred Bands".
The units were composed of homosexual couples. When your "buddy" is
also your SO, you aren\'t very likely to break and run in front of him.

That\'s not true.  Watch the opening credits of the original Star Trek tv
show after the first season.  The Enterprise zips by and makes a
"whoosh".  Gene Roddenberry explained in The Making of Star Trek that
they didn\'t have a whoosh in the first season because in space there
wouldn\'t be any sound, but the audiences were expecting that when
something flew by quickly it would make a sound, so it was jarring not
to have it, so they put it into the second and third seasons.  

Battlestar Galactica fighters banked and rolled as if they were in
atmosphere.  Battlestar Galactica is about contemporaneous with Star
Wars; I\'m not sure which came first.

I\'ve removed "OT" from the subject line, because this subject is very
relevant to anyone involved in campaigns with infantry action.  Striker
and Mercenary, like most wargames, don\'t reflect the "something innate
in man to make him reluctant to kill" to which Kyle and others have
referred.  

I hope Doug Berry will add some comments about this in his Ground Forces
book.

This thread has changed both my playing and my refereeing.  Thanks.

Why refer to fiction?

Aren\'t the the voyages of Captain Cook on the Endevour perfect examples
of the Captain deciding that his mission was exploring on shore, not
watching from the ship.

Actually the best game is when the West Coast Eagles played the Ithklur

Another book worth reading on this subject is John Keegan\'s
Faces of Battle.  It covers not the tacttics of war, but what it might 
and should have been like in three battles: Argincourtt, Waterloo, 
and the Somme. (Bonus points for guess why these three).  He 
also gives a good historyogrphy(sp?) of Military History.  As well as 
a look at the future of the Battlefields.  His main thesis is to find 
out why men fight on a battlefield, instead of breaking. An Excellent
writer well worth reading most of what he does.  Was/is head of 
Military history/Science at Sandhurst I think.

It seems they receive a Gun, a Blade, perhaps a Mid Psg and a lump sum of Imperial Credits and go on to become Player Characters...

The ship\'s phasers also made a noise.  Oddly, it was a completely different
noise than the one heard on the bridge when the phasers were fired.

Outside the ship, it was along metallic whistle.  Inside, it was a single
short spitting noise.

I would like to see _some_ detailed characters.   In particular, I would
like to see some kind of factionalism within the nobility, with details of
faction heads and agents of theirs who can interact with Player Characters
as patrons.  For example, in the Spinward Marches, there could be rivalry
between Norris, and a faction around the Santanocheev family, or perhaps
the politics of the Ling Standard/Sternmetall Horizons rivalry could be
explored.  (The latter might be preferable, since it could be extended into
the Solomani Rim when that book comes out.)  Oh, and those pesky Tukera
people - total laser-meat.

It might actually be more useful to have details of life at subordinate
courts, rather than the Imperial one.  There wouldn\'t necessarily be all
that much difference, but it\'s rather more likely that Player Characters
would get involved with the Archducal court at Mora, or the equivalent in
the Solomani Rim (Dingir?) than the Imperial one at Capital.

Questions about Nobles?  How rich are they, really?  How do you meet them,
marry them, or become one of them?  After you do, who is going to try to
cut your throat, and why?

Oh, and why was that dimwit son of Baron hault-Oberlindes always needing to
be rescued?

More seriously - property and families are always good things for PCs to
have - it means they\'ve got something to lose, and they\'re a bit less
likely to disappear "off the map" - a problem that I often saw in the
Classic Traveller days, before "civilisation" started shrinking, and which
could be an issue in the GT setting too.

It\'s definitely 42 angels who can dance on a pinhead, and the pinhead
hasn\'t much choice about it - have you ever tried getting rid of an
infestation of angels?  (Insert plug for In Nomine here if you insist.... 
I\'ve never played it.)

Anyway, if it gives me lots of good excuses for PCs to shoot things, it\'s
fine.

  Striker (I) did, OTOH, have enchanting rules on how difficult it was
to get your troops to do _anything_ (vaguely like their later "coolness
under fire rules" for various RPG\'s?). This was pretty challenging (aka
aggravating) for wargamers new to serious (even if SF) miniatures rules.

I agree. Scouts use radios too much, company commanders use radios too much, 
and forward observers might as well just call me on a phone and *tell* me 
where they are. \'Course, I *liked* it that way.
In the Persian Gulf I was briefing the 6th Light Armor (French) and asked 
how long they thought they could speak on the radio before an enemy could 
fix their position. The concensus was 15 seconds. When I told them that in 
15 seconds the rounds would already be in the air, they thought I was 
kidding. During the war the tactical elements were pretty quiet, but their 
commanders and support were often on for 1+ minute at a time. And most 
armies aren\'t any better. Commanders get \'addicted\' to information very 
quickly, especially in high-stress situations like combat. Generals \'need\' 
to know what is happening in that critical battalion, company commanders 
\'must have\' artillery support right now, etc. If you leave them alone for a 
time, they do what they are trained to do - trust the equipment.
Then you kill them.
ObTrav: Imperial Intelligence probably has a whole lotta\' electronic warfare 
stuff, ranging from deep space listening arrays to detect old radio signals 
from solar systems 3-4 light years away to \'tramp far traders\' that actually 
have tons of electronics in their bay and an extendable antenna in their air 
raft berth

Postman... I\'m familiar with his work. A modern-day Luddite and 
technophobe. In one of his recent works (I don\'t remember which), he
claimed that the rate of technological change was disorienting to
people. (Sounds like he ripped off the idea from Alvin Toffler, but it
fits in with his general technology-is-evil views.) My response to that
was, if he can\'t keep up with the pace of technological change, he should
step aside and get out of the way of those of us who can.

Don\'t overestimate the collectible trading card game market. Back when
Magic: The Gathering was at its peak, one CCG fan insisted that CCGs would
displace RPGs the way RPGs displaced wargames. Hasn\'t happened. Won\'t happen.

The speed of communication will have an effect, no matter what the dominant
medium is. I would suspect that there will be variations in the dominant
media from place to place. Some high-tech cultures will be very much 
oriented to television, while other high-tech cultures will eschew TV
entirely, getting their information from their version of the Internet.

(Speaking of which, since I got my cable modem 3 years ago, I tend to watch
less TV...)

With 11,000 worlds in the Imperium, you\'ll find anything and everything if
you look long enough...

You\'re almost right. They didn\'t have the whoosh in the pilot episode,
"Where No Man Has Gone Before", and it was thought that it missed
something -- the whoosh was added for the regular production episodes, 
but is missing from the opening credits of that one episode. (Shatner\'s
narration "Space... the final frontier..." is also missing from that 
episode\'s opening credits.)

(Before anyone responds: yes, I know "Where No Man..." was the *second*
pilot. The first pilot, "The Cage", was itself not aired as a regular
series episode, but was edited into a two-parter "The Menagerie". The
second pilot aired as the third broadcast episode of the series.)

Star Wars. When Battlestar Galactica came out, it was widely regarded
as nothing more than a Star Wars ripoff.

Note that for that to do you any good, you need to know the velocity the
rock arrives with.

To first order, it arrives with roughly orbital velocity: 10 km/s. Punching
through
the atmosphere might cost ~1 km/s for a "non-streamlined" rock. The launching
ship could easily add 18 km/s by using its drive (5 minutes at 6 G) to adjust
trajectory before launch.

Then, to compare to nuclear weapons, recall that 1 kg of TNT is about
4x10^6 joules of energy. (note: I may be misremembering the exact number
and hope that someone will correct me if I am.)

A side bar in GF addresses this issue.  The Blade reward has become a
"parting gift" from the last unit.  The Gun reward is considered to be a
trophy or weapon that was lost.

Middle passages are travel vouchers intended to get the former service

Imperial Army NCOs avoid mentioning the Marines.  They find the whole

Star Wars by a year.  In fact, Battlestar Galactica used a piece of stock
footage from Star Wars!  When ever anybody launched a missile from a large
ship, they used a piece of film showing the rear end of a four-engined

The USMA at West Point doen\'t recruit football players.  It recruits future
Army officers.

I have just spent an extremely frustrating *hour* trying to track down a
quote from a Gerneral during the breakout that is enscribed near Army\'s

"I need an officer for a difficult, dangerous mission.  Get me a West Point

I thought it was based on imperium. But i\'ve never managed to get hold of 
copy of it. The multiplayer games network (www.mpgn.com) used to tun an 
online version of the game, but this seems to have disappeared from their 
list of games.

Dark Nebula could make an interesting PBeM game. At least with it\'s movement 
system it only takes a couple of turns until you encounter the enemy. With 
standard traveller movement it would take many turns until the players came 
into contact.

One important point that i haven\'t seen mention is that the forces in
WWII/Korea/Vietnam were largely made up of draftees or reservists.  An all
volunteer force, like the ones the Finns fielded against the Russians in
the Winter War, will have a much better rate of firing troops.  They want
to be there!

Since the Imperial Army is the cream of regular forces (yes, I realize that
scum is an equally appropriate metaphor), they won\'t have this problem as
much as historical forces.

Another factor is the realism of training.  The US Army\'s training methods
stress training the way you fight.  Systems like MILES and training grounds
like the NTC at Ft. Irwin have revolutionized the way soldiers learn their
tasks.

The Imperial Army and Marines have incredible resources (like the ability
to rent entire continents as live fire ranges) and the technology to insure
that training is as real as combat, less the deaths.

That\'s not exactly how it worked.  The axe was already poised for DC-XA
when they had the tip-over-and-fire due to a landing gear failure.  The
Lockheed-Martin X-33 had been selected as the SSTO candidate on July 2,
1996.  The accident with DC-XA occurred on July 31, 1996.  

It\'s been suggested X-33 won the NASA competition because LockMart was
providing more of their own resources toward the project, and because 
NASA liked some of its "sexy" technology (aerospike engines and so on).
The fact that DC-X was originally a BMDO project rather than a NASA 
project might not have helped it either.

X-33 was supposed to enter flight testing in March 1999, but that\'s been
pushed back to next summer.  Then they\'ll decide if that worked out, and
if approved, a full-scale "VentureStar" is supposed to fly in 2005.

Details of the Imperial court again would be good, but not too much.

Most of my traveller campaigns have been based around a small group of 
Travellers (the PC\'s), their ship and the adventures they have. Any 
supplements I buy should improve the game for the players within the frame 
work of this campaign. What I\'d like to buy is a book that expands and 
explains the role of a Noble within the "standard" traveller game.

A book that explains what benefits and penalties a Noble can expect during a 
game. Some work on explaining why a noble would want to go travelling would 
be useful some help in detailing the nobles family and responsiblity, and 
perhaps a system for generating the Nobles superior. A knight reports to a 
baron etc but who is the baron what are his motives. This superior could 
create a whole host of plot leads during the game as he used the PC\'s to 
help him achieve his aims.

In short the book should have an overview of the Noble system, if the book 
is to be Milieu specific then it should contain details of the current High 
Ranked Nobility, the bulk of the book should expand the game for a Noble PC, 
and perhaps at the back a Sample Yacht with deck plans, guided tour etc. and 
make it a true nobles plaything and not just a merchant ship with extra 
staterooms and a bigger jump drive, give it a dining room and a decent sized 
Galley not just a standard starship galley. It should be like the QE2 not 
the Isle of Wight ferry.

My apologies for suggesting that the ships would be \'quiet\' rather than

Well, I can\'t speak for any of his works beyond "Amusing Ourselves to

anecdotal evidence, that television is something to fear.

Personally, I suspect he\'s right on the mark.

I don\'t think that it\'s going to happen, but I\'d also have to compare the
number of new RPGers vs. the number of new CCGers. Here in the U.S., WotC
has a relatively strong television presence, and apparently WotC has been
sending people out into the wilds of America to teach kids to play the
Pokemon CCG.

	It can be persuasively argued that animals do not avoid
	killing each other, rather they avoid risk to themselves.
	Typically, escalating a confrontation between individuals
	increases the probability of injury or death.

	Very true.  Certainly any carnivores are likely to find it

Because ships, and not bases, can travel to dangerous places (of course, if 
the base is in a dangerous place, then families shouldn\'t be on it either).

You might ask: well, "safe" bases get raided -- true, but so do "safe" 
planets. I wouldn\'t put untrained personnel on a ship than has a high 
probability of encountering trouble.

Math. So you can calculate the difference in years correctly using 
normal figures. IIRC \'Zero\' is an Arabic invention hence the AD/BC 
switch over issues for the Roman Calendar. (ie the calendar goes 2BC 
1BC 1AD etc so you can get errors). This is vague memories so someone 
else feel free to chip in. It\'s also why the millennium changes on 31 
Dec 00 not 31 Dec 99.

We have public (private/independent) schools, state schools (ie 
funded by UK taxpayers) and Church schools (funded about 85% by 
taxpayers, 15% by religions).

What a great title.  It\'s even better than Four Arguments for the
Elimination of Television (by Gerry Mander (his real name), written in
the early 1970s).

You are missing the mark.  Precedent was widely used in European systems
before the development of the printing press.  (Even your hypothetical
of the tribal leader reviewing his internal library suggests that he may
have been thinking in part, "how did our ancestors handle this?")  The
court -- often a panel of noble judges -- would consider the situation
presented and confer among themselves about what the result had been in
similar cases in the past.  That is the essence of precedent.  It is a
concept intimately connected (historically, although not logically) to
the idea of judges making and developing the law.  

By the late 1700s, only Britain retained the concept of judge-made,
precedent-based law. I suspect that the rise of absolutist monarchies on
the continent (the result of continental monarchies\' victories in the
struggle with the nobles that the nobles and merchants won in the
English Civil War) has more to do with the decline in the power of
judges and the use of precedent than changes in technology.  Napoleon
instituted his Code Napoleon about 1800, and it has served as a model
for the civil law system in Europe (where he imposed it on whomever
France conquered) and much of the rest of the world to this day.  

The civil law system is typified by writing the rules in as much detail
as possible in a legal code, which rules are then applied to each
situation presented to the court, without regard to what other courts
have done in similar situations.  That really depends on an efficient
publication system to get copies of the code to all of the judges and
lawyers.

In the last 200 years, common law countries have been developing civil
codes, but keeping their reliance on judicial precedent to interpret
those codes.  The trend is definitely away from use of precedent,
however.  For example, administrative courts (like those of the SEC or
many state labor departments) don\'t rely on precedent set by other
administrative law judges.  

Today, much of the law in the United States at least is being put on the
internet. That is an important change, because it makes the text of the
law (both code and precedent) accessible to many more people than ever
before.  (Reason that is more accessible include the relative ease of
computer searching over index or key word research, and the physical
proximity of one\'s computer versus the law library.)

I don\'t think that the concept of law -- at least as actually practiced,
as opposed to perceived -- has changed significantly as a result of any
of these technologies.  None of them are well suited to reasoned
discourse, and that is still the essence of the modern practice of law. 
Sensational cases have always been with us, but they have only
tangential effects on the practice or development of the law.  Those
tangential effects are limited to legislative response to public
perception.  None of the cases you mentioned has had any effect on the
law itself.

This is really interesting problem, because, as you note,

In the Far Future -- which is the present day as far as the Ziru Sirka
is concerned (I think Vilani scouts got our recent Mars probes) --
communication within a star system is essentially instantaneous for huge
volumes of information.  On the other hand, communication within an
interstellar polity takes weeks.  How does this affect public
discourse?  I\'m not sure, and I have to go back to work.

How do people handle salvage rights?  For that matter, how do they work in the real world?

For example, our heroes come across a damaged, but basically intact ship adrift in the outer reaches of a remote system.  After checking
the ship for survivors they find it deserted.  Once they manage to get the power plant online, drives working and get the ship refuelled they
decide to leave a skeleton crew aboard, get her to civilisation and claim salvage rights. HOWEVER on further examination they discover this
multi-million credit Free Trader was financed with 30 years left to pay off.

The owner/operators are dead so does the ship belong to the bank? Is it like a mortgage where an insurance policy pays off the balance
of the finance leaving the ship to be inherited by the owners\\\' next of kin?  Or does it belong to the salvaging PCs?

I\\\'m guessing it\\\'s either insured and paid off, leaving the PCs with a legal claim to the ship which can be contested under Imperial
law by the next of kin, or title reverts to the bank, but they pay the salvagers a percentage of the market value of the ship.

How does it work in the real world, any legal eagles specialising in International Maritime Law on the list?  For that matter is this
covered by canon?

Just curious to find out before I run the scenario, because my guys WILL ask to keep it....

...until they find the guy just hanging on in emergency low berth with scant hours of battery power keeping him alive...*evil grin*

As a straight Intell guy (transfered from being a grunt) I spend quite 
a lot of time carrying one of those things at platoon or section level 
(the NZ Army still uses PRC-77s at about 20lbs), and we used to avoid 
talking as much as possible. We were generally quite successful as long 
as we could talk the company OCs out of requiring full SitReps every 
hour (and often on the hour). Sometimes I wonder about the mentality of 
people who become officers.

Hmm, I hadn\'t considered that the units might be Kelvin, but it seems odd
to mix units like that, no?  Anyway, I\'ll check tonite to see if that
works out.  Also, I\'m pretty sure the formula I gave was the effect of
nighttime cooling.  So the 42.45 degrees is subtracted from the base temp,
giving an even warmer cold pole at around -30 C.

<Leonard>
The fact that there *has* to be atmospheric circulation (ie *weather*,
and some "climate") or else all the atmosphere will wind up in a big
stack at the middle of darkside, melting away on one side and building
up on the other as the planet slowly rotates.

Actually, any such figures are going to be a *guess* since we don\'t
*have* a planet with anything *close* to those specs to work with.
</Leonard>

Yes, I know that.  But still, assuming that all other things are equal,
one would expect that the cold pole would be colder than earth\'s north
pole, no?  I mean consider if the earth became tidally locked, one would
expect the cold pole to be colder than the arctic/antarctic, right?  Of
course, this world is smaller, so convection might work more
efficiently...

<Leonard>
The north and south poles won\'t be much different in temp from anyplace
else along the teminator. But if you make the terminator unihabitable
what are they going to use for food? You can\'t grow anything on the
dark side.

I suppose it\'d work if you made only the "hot pole" habitable.
</Leonard>

Ya, that\'s what I\'m thinking.  Or maybe just a band between the hot pole
and the terminator.  The thing is that if the terminator is comfy, you
could just stay at the poles without having to worry about moving around
to stay in habitable areas.

Ya, the point is not to make it difficult for them or anything.  Just to
make it an aspect of their society.  I\'m thinking of things like "shoot,

generations leaving "standing stones" and so on for later generations to
find as they come around again.  It\'s also going to be a bit challenging

I\'ve just been reading up on medieval villages, and their justice 
system was based almost entirely on precedent. The jury would hear the 
case and make a ruling based on custom (ie what happened last time this 
came up), and make a ruling. If there was no precedent they would make 
a ruling based on what seemed reasonable to them (often this was 
confirmed in the records as being the will of the village as a whole), 
and this would then become one of the customs of the manor. I would 
suggest that precedent as a way of making law predates any other system.

I get min temp of -32C (or -60C with latitude modifiers.) using Grand
Survey.
(Reduction of (10+273)*0.15 = 42C).  This formula is the reduction and not
the minimum temperature as someone suggested.  This situation is no use
anyway because the dayside temp is very hot so you would have problems
explaining the hydrographics.

The relatively small drop is because of the atmosphere - For a vacuum world
the formula for temp. drop is (10+273)*0.80 which would give a minumim temp
of -216C which is probably what you were expecting.

My suggestion is to have a base temperature of -194C.  This gives a max
dayside temp of 4C, increased to 16C with latitude modifiers.  This makes
both the nightside and twilight area completely uninhabitable.

An alternative would be to have a world with a very long \'year\' in an very
eccentric orbit (or possibly the effect of a binary star - Helliconia
anyone?).  The population would then have to migrate from the equator (in
winter) to the poles (in summer).  I would be a lot more confident with the
temperature calculations in this case than for a tidally locked world and
you can even have a normal day.

Mark.

That is why MILES [laser tag add ons for weapons which work with blanks] is 
such a great system in the open lands, like at NTC, and stink so bad in the 
woods, because in the woods troops and small unit leaders may wrongly "learn" 
that a tree or bush is cover, not the correct classification of concealment, 
where as at NTC they correctly learn a rock or small hill is both.

Remember, you are pointing a gun at someone with intent to shoot.  That may
give untrained hacks the impression you can do that with any firearm.

Technopoly, by Neil Postman, starts with an explanation how literacy is the 
downfall of memorization.  Makes you wonder how you are supposed to read 
the book.  :)

Seriously, I never saw Postman\'s work as a sign that we should stop being 
literate and destroy our toasters, rather just an interesting read on the 
markers and influences of our society.  He might be absolutely correct, 
however I enjoy reading books and toasting bread.  Given the number of 
writers that theorize everything under the sun, I am sure that someone has 
written a counter argument to Postman, and a counter-counter argument to 
that guy, and. . .

True, but CCGs have seriously displaced where the money of roleplayers is 
going.  Wargames are still being played and created, but nothing like the 
scale how like they were before RPGs.  There definitely has been a vast 
shrinking of the roleplaying gaming "industry".  From the estimates I have 
heard, the industry is one twentieth the size it was ten years 
ago.  Personally, I am pointing my fingers at CRPGs, and not CCGs.

Of course, that doesn\'t stop me from playing Alpha Centauri.  So it goes.

Technology will seriously effect how information is transmitted.  Since 
there are a huge variety of tech levels in the Imperium, beyond Xboats, 
styles of communication will definately be a local or subsector phenomenon.

Planets V, W & X might have an immersive hologrid communications network 
that operates with a small fleet of Xboat-like communication couriers, 
Planet Y has telegraph and a postal service, while Planet Z has a system 
wide Internet ran via Windows5000 (Gov code is 1, unless Win5K crashes, and 
then it is a 0 until it reboots).

Ditto.  More time for the TML. ;)

<Mark>
reduction and not the minimum temperature as someone suggested.  This
situation is no use anyway because the dayside temp is very hot so you
would have problems explaining the hydrographics. 
</Mark>

Yep, true.  I only calculated for the pole, which was something like 700
degrees, IIRC.

<Mark>
The relatively small drop is because of the atmosphere - For a vacuum
world the formula for temp. drop is (10+273)*0.80 which would give a
minumim temp of -216C which is probably what you were expecting. 
</Mark>

Okay, I suspected that.  Seems a little over-powerful for convection
effects, but that\'s just my intuition.

<Mark>
My suggestion is to have a base temperature of -194C.  This gives a max
dayside temp of 4C, increased to 16C with latitude modifiers.  This makes
both the nightside and twilight area completely uninhabitable.
</Mark>

Ah, that\'s perfect!  Thanks muchly.  I may up the base to 170C or so, just
to make the hot pole itself "uncomfortable".  As for hydrographics, they
can always represent ice formations or even liquid nitrogen on the cold
side. 

<Mark>
An alternative would be to have a world with a very long \'year\' in an very
eccentric orbit (or possibly the effect of a binary star - Helliconia
anyone?).  The population would then have to migrate from the equator (in
winter) to the poles (in summer).  I would be a lot more confident with
the temperature calculations in this case than for a tidally locked world
and you can even have a normal day. 
</Mark>

Interesting, but one thing I like about the tidal lock is that these
people live in continuous day-light.  Individuals from different areas
might call each other "noon-landers" or "afternoons" or some such.  As for
confidence in temperature calcs, I realize this is all guesstimates (I
keep thinking about things like heat storage in the ground over long
periods, etc.) but I think it\'s a cool idea and wanted to have something a
little better than my own WAGs to go on.  Thanks again for your input.

IMHO, paintball falls in the same class of issues as first-person shooter 
video games and combat-oriented RPGs.  Some believe that they serve to 
harmlessly relieve stress, others think they desensetize and encourage 
violence.

As an avid Paintball player and general opponent of "anti-violence" 
censorship, I know where I stand on this issue, but I\'d rather not start 
this debate....

I used to be in the "paintball is way cool crowd" I heard somebody whom i
respect talk about hunting with his sons.  I think he described some kind of
training and then talked about how he refused to let them in paintball
because it taught them the wrong lessons about firearms.

Now i\'m awash in moral uncertainty.

That\'s a bad place to be.  You\'ll know you\'re really in trouble when you
start referring to pets as "companion animals" because the word "pet" is
demeaning to nonhuman animals.  It starts when you forget to capitalize I
and just goes downhill from there.  Next thing you know, you\'ll be part of
an angry mob blockading a hotel, unlawfully detaining innocent
civilians while yelling vile things into their faces, and claiming to be
"a peaceful protest".

This will be a limiting factor on the Imperial Army.  Even with tanks that
fly at 600mph and weapon ranges of over ten miles, the need to shield
communications from detection will shorten the front a unit can fight on.
The IA will live and die on its laser and meson com systems.

This makes for an obvious tactic: drop a lot of blackout and prism smoke.
The enemy can\'t send laser signals, and if he doesn\'t possess meson coms,
he\'s pretty screwed.  Now the Zhodani, they just make sure that one of
their "commissioned specialists" is riding along to provide uninterrupted
comms.

Oh, Rupert?  The prick-77 weighs about 20lbs at the *beginning* of the
movement.  After the first few miles, it starts to weigh on the order of
several tons.  As does the M-16, your helmet, your beard stubble...

*That\'s* the answer!  Bruce, the missing mass of the universe accumulates
in soldiers on road marches!  Woo-Hoo, Noble prize, here I come!

I\'ve noticed. Ever try an 81mm mortar barrel? We had to lug one up a

I sort of feel the same. Maybe some info on knightly orders could be
included. Or some secret and/or not-so-secret societies of nobles. And a
list of privilages and responsibilities for each Noble rank could be useful.
I think it might be best to concentrate on the lower end of nobility such as
Marquis and Barons, rather than the nigh-on deific Dukes and what-not.
Heraldry in the 3I, and crests and stuff would be fun too.

Did a 4.2" baseplate for a mile.  With every step I thanked God for making
me an 11-Bravo instead of 11-Charlie.  Charlies are the mortarmen.

Yep. That mortar tube made my C9 seem like a little tonka toy after 
about 100\' up the hill. It was winter and the exercise area is about 10 
miles from a volcano, and is covered in volcanic ash, which turns to 
this most amazing mud when it gets wet. It\'s solid when there\'s no 
pressure on it, making it hard to get off, but soft and sticky when you 
stand on it. Wonderful stuff.

I don\'t see comms as a limiting factor for high-tech troops. A combination
of even today\'s technology is pretty hard to beat (just not the man-portable
versions). If every MIB is communicating with a combination of stuff which
we understand today, like frequency hopping, direct-sequence spread
spectrum, etc, plus whatever stuff the advanced TLs bring, you will have a
very hard time stopping him from communicating. If you are ahead by a TL or
two, that\'s a different story. In that case, he will not have a prayer.

Obscuring line-of-sight comms may also be fairly difficult at advanced TLs.
Even today, we have systems (thermal imagers) which can see through smoke
and fog. (Ask the Iraqis how well these systems let you see through thick
black smoke.) With frequency-agile lasers at advanced TLs, you will be able
to adapt to any obscurants.

Exactly how do these prismatic aerosols work anyway? What is the effect
used? Is this even plausible? Are the effects caused by absorption?
Refraction? Scattering? Deus ex machina?

Think again. That was NOT stock footage from Star Wars! That was stock

My understanding is as follows:  

To accomplish a salvage, you have to find a ship with
no living thing aboard (the rule is a little strange
in the real world, where the ship\'s dog counts as a
living thing, but the rats and any plant life do not)
and bring it back to civilization.  

In my Traveller universe, "no living thing" means "no
living sophont."  The ship\'s dog, as much as I love
dogs, doesn\'t count.

As the salvager, you get a lien on the ship, equal to
some percentage of its current fair market value.  I
think it\'s 10% today.  The owner of the ship must pay
that to you in order to get the ship back.  

Who is the owner of the ship now?  It depends.

If a corporation owned it before whatever happened, it
still owns it.  If all of the shareholders of the
corporation were the crew, see below.

If an individual or a partnership owns it, and the
individual or partners are all crew (and therefore
dead), then their estates own it, and there will be
probate litigation somewhere (jurisdiction is the
subject of another treatise that I\'ve been working
on).  

If a partnership owns it, and one or more partners
survived, they own it by right of survivorship -- no
probate, title just passes automatically.  The same is
true if a married couple owned it and one spouse
survived.  Bear in mind that "survived" probably means
that person wasn\'t aboard at all before whatever
happened happened, and may show up a long time later
(and false claims are also an issue -- "yeah, the
owner aboard was my wife, yeah, that\'s the ticket, my
wife, so I own it").  

If the owner refuses to pay your salvage fee, you may
foreclose the lien, have the ship sold by the Imperial
admiralty authorities, and take your percentage of the
sale price -- but see infra regarding lien priority.

If the ship is under financing, the lender has a lien
on the ship.  I don\'t whether it has priority over the
salvage lien under contemporary or Imperial law. 
Let\'s suppose that it does (prior in time is prior in
right, ordinarily).  If you foreclose your junior
salvage lien and sell the vessel, the buyer takes it
subject to the lender\'s senior lien.  

If the salvage lien has priority, foreclosing it would
also foreclose the lender\'s lien, so the buyer would
have to pay it off as well.  That doesn\'t make good
economic sense, so the salvage lien probably does not
have priority.

Another factor to consider is valuation.  Someone will
have to appraise the vessel to determine its fair
market value and, thus, the value of the salvage lien.
The appraiser may be competent or incompetent, corrupt
or not corrupt.  The owner of the vessel will want as
low an appraisal as possible (unless they are seeking
refinancing, in which case they will want as high a
value as possible), but the salvagers will want a high
value.  It\'s an opportunity for role playing.

I don\'t specialize in maritime law (although many
years ago I did interview for a job doing it, and
thought it would have been fun).

Not so far as I recall.

I forgot to mention insurance.  If the ship had some
kind of loss insurance, that insurance was triggered
when the ship was missing for some period of time
stated in the policy, and the insurance company paid
the beneficiary of the policy, typically the owner. 
Who is the owner is set forth in my previous post.  

So now the insurance company steps into the shoes of
the owner when the salvagers bring the ship back to
civilization.  

An insurance company could be a patron, if it\'s
cheaper to send a few PCs to look for a ship than to
pay the claim.

Seems to me that the salvage value of a ship is balanced by
1) rendering a mandated service to a ship in distress
2) personal risk involved in the above

Space is big, and Traveller is an often nasty universe to play in.
If you find a derelict, that-which-caused-its-deriliction may well
still be on board.

If the ship has a lean on it, the lean holder takes the ship minus
a (large) percentage of the equity, which is the finder\'s fee.  If
the ship was owned by the deceased/missing, salvage rights apply
and the ship is theirs, including all on board which is not owned
by some other entity (freight springs to mind).

If the ship has a pathogen, parasite, or pirate on board, then
fun may commence.

This is how I interpreted the book, and why I thought the movie was a fine
adaptation. I can see how the two seem very different, but one must remember
that a book and a movie have very different ways of communicating. Take Bram
Stokers Dracula, both the book and the movie. There are major differences in
the two, but I felt the movie was very true to the *feeling* of the book. It
took me a few times watching it, as I had an emotional revulsion to certain
bits in the movie that initially seemed contrary to the book, but the
intended audience is in a very different time period. This, and the "show,
don\'t tell" nature of film media are the main reasons for changes between
the two. ST the book was very serious in tone, ST the movie was a farce,
bordering on slapstick at times. I can see that raising hackles on Heinlein
fans, and I was disoriented myself on my first viewing. But it had been some
time since I had read the book, so I was able to experience the movie as a
separate work.

Since odds are \'that-which-caused-its-deriliction\' involves severe mechanical malfunction, that\'s usually true.  Intact ships are rather unlikely salvage.

Maybe it\'s just me, but Traveller nobility seems to be a rather narrow topic
for a 128 page book. And not a very interesting topic at that, either.
A generous and sadistic GM,
Brandon Cope
 

Well hell, to each their own I say.

Personally I would like to see the following...

Typical Noble Hobbies
A detailed \'how to\' for court politics
Details of noble factions and background history
The difference between life and hereditary nobility as it applies to PCs.
How each look upon the other
The role of Legates, Governors Vs Planetary nobility
Planetary nobility Vs Imperial Nobility
The role of Nobility in government
How nobles earn their money (taxes, investments, commercial use of their
fief), typical income for each nobility level
Expectations for noble kiddies e.g. Naval Academy & navy for a couple of
terms, before taking up their heritage
Age of majority for inheritance for Nobility
The prevalence of Imperial Nobles in the imperial population
The powers of an Imperial Noble on the world where their title is derived
(legal immunity?, call out military powers? Figureheads?)
Inheritance rules (Male heir, equal between sexes?)
Expectations of nobility by imperial citizenry

Man I could go on but I\'ll stop now. Of you go Loren, me wanna see soon -
chop chop.

The only point I would add is that it\'s not clear what rights the Imperium
itself holds. In English common law (as I understand it) the Lord of the
Manor was entitled to take whatever washed up on his property. Since the
Imperium holds little real estate directly, but claims control of all
interplanetary and interstellar space, it may be that ships found derelict
and drifting belong first to the Imperium, while wrecks would fall under
planetary jurisdiction. It would be in the Emperor\'s interest to pay a
generous reward for salvage, though, because it discourages piracy.

"Salvage" actually covers any action taken to rescue a ship in distress,
even if the crew is still onboard. Depending on how difficult and dangerous
the assistance turns out to be, the salvors can be entitled to up to 50% of
the value of the salvaged vessel. The bottom line, though is: "No cure --
no pay."

Military vessels are immune to salvage liens.

"Annic Nova," JTAS #1, p. 30, says:

"...this ship is allowed in imperial commerce under the salvage laws
provided the ship is registered with imperial authorities (typical
registration fee: Cr100,000)."

That text was not included in Dbl Adv 1, however.

Adv. 13 (Signal GK), p. 46, adds:

"The Imperial Navigation Act of 103 requires all vessels, whether military
or civilian, to respond to the GK, SOS, or Mayday signals, provided such
response does not endanger the ship and crew of the responding vessel."

This subject comes up briefly in GT: Far Trader (pp. 60-61, 71 & 114) and
GT: Starports, and will be covered in considerable detail in the
forthcoming GT: Starships.

should have been given a chance.  Every SF show, it seems, needs a season to
work out the kinks.  I tried watching B5 the first season and was repulsed.
Started watching again in the 3rd one and was totally hooked!  Same with
S:TNG. Not that it every got really good IMO, but it went from terrible to
okay by third season.
Back to SAAB Problems:
1.	It needed someone with military knowledge as an assistant director
(or maybe someone who had once read a book about the military, or who had
lived within a few miles of an army base or SOMETHING! :-) 
2.	The banking fighters were okay.  They were semi-realistic with the
rolling ability and stuff, but why not go all the way and do vector
movement?
3.	Some episodes were unwatchable due to bad acting and writing.  The
"Little tank that could" one was terrible and the "Flickering light as psych
weapon" one was beyond horrible. 

Having said that, I thought some episodes were brilliant: "Who Monitors the
Birds" was great!  I should\'ve been given some time to get its legs under
itself...
Lesson for SF TV writers:  Keep the number of characters small so you can
actually develop them a little!  Three main characters with 3 secondary
seems to be a winning formula (Think Kirk / Spock / McCoy with Scotty / Sulu
/ Chekov).
Charles C.

RANT BEGINS

Bad Charles, naughty Charles. 

I loved everything EVERYTHING about that show. IMHO I thought it was close
to Trav as a show could be (apart from FTL and quick jumps). The writing was
just friggin\' superb - what else could you expect from Wong and Morgan (if
there were publicity pics of those two, there would be some sort of shrine
in their honour) and whatever writers they brought on board. 

It kicked the living poop out of anything else I have ever EVER seen in the
Sci Fi world. And as for Marines/Pilots, everyone knows that\'s a plot
device. You can\'t have a show with just pilots - that\'d be as boring as
hell. There has to be justification for them being on the ground and being a
combo trained force is good enough for me. Geez, look at ST. Teleporters?
Just a way to get the protagonists into the action without boring screen
time wasting link scenes.  I never hated the writing, not once. 

Plus I loved the idea of Tanks (Nipple Necks), the AI\'s and the whole secret
within a secret within a secret that M&W are so very good at using - a layer
off every couple of episodes.

So I\'ll be god damned before I see people slagging off this magnificent
program <grinny grin grin> . . . . and curse the near-sighted dicks at FOX
that let it die.  


RANT ENDS

Oh yeah, 5-6 characters can work and work well. IMO it did in SAAB. Each
character had excellent motivation or overlying stresses which came out time
and time again.

As for favourite episode - Cooper Hawke\'s origin. They way they interspersed
the present (where he was stalking chigs - no dialogue whatsoever) with the
flashbacks to his past, to date is the finest sci-fi episode of anything I
have ever seen.

Bravo - many hats into air.

Whether they feel the same about other races is of

Well, the most important point he makes is that the
methods the army uses to make it easier for men to
kill - desensitisation to blood, guts and suffering,
firing automatically when a "target" (person) appears,
making the targets appear human, instead of just
bullseyes - are all things that are happening to kids
with their movies, tv shows, and shoot \'em up video
games. In "Time Crisis" and so on, kids take a plastic
gun with a laser beam that goes "bang!" and has a
slight recoil when they pull the trigger, and fire
directly at figures as lifelike as the computers can
make it. In the army, we did something similar, where
there was a film from first-person perspective of a
grunt patrolling through the jungle, when you saw an
"enemy" you had to shoot him, your plastic gun with
its pretend recoil and laser beam shooting him down.

I\'ll note also that in these video games, censorship
regulations mean that the figures after ebign shot
evapourate. You\'re not allowed to show blood and guts
and screaming and guys taking hours to die, crying for
their mothers, crapping in their pants, etc. Thus, the
shooting is without unpleasant consequences.

As I see it, Grossman takes the socialisation view. Of
course, if there were no guns then no-one could be
killed with guns; whether this is practical, possible,
or desirable we\'ll leave aside, but simply put, if you
ain\'t got it, you can\'t use it. The retort that there
are still knives, baseball bats etc around so the
murder rate won\'t drop doesn\'t hold water, since
people, not just soldiers, find it easier to kill if
there is a physical distance between them and their
victim. Grossman points out that the simplest way to
kill a person is to stick your thumb in their eye and
slush it about through their brain, but that he\'s
never heard of anyone doing this.

But I think for him the socialisation is more
important. The means to kill are available to anybody
who is not a paraplegic, but the desire, and, in the
end, the "guts" to do so, are a different matter. And
these games and movies are giving our kids the "guts"
to kill.

The thing is not whether or not you can stop him talking, but whether

Ok, as I understand real world salvage laws, if you bring an
*abandoned* vessel into port or salvage the cargo, the owners have
first dibs at buying it from you. If you don\'t like the offer, you can
take the matter before an "admiralty court". They are likely to award
you the *market value* of the vessel and cargo, plus a reasonable
amount for what it cost you to salvage the ship/cargo. And there\'s
essentially no appeal.

So it behooves the owners to either make a *good* offer, or just let
you *have* the shp/cargo. They may offer you *somewhat* less than the
admiralty court would award on the basis of "we can give you this
*now*, rather than having to wait for the court decision". 

Players may go for this. On the other hand, they can also arrange to
have a lawyer or their "business agent" handle the matter for them.
They\'d give a deposition and be able to leave. If there are questions,
the court can usually put things on hold long enough for you to return
to that planet and clear things up. Just don\'t dawdle around getting
there. They understand about having to finish a cargo run. They won\'t
look kindly on the matter if they find out that you got word of the
problem, and *then* took a contract that sent you elsewhere.

It may also be possible to have local officials take a sworn statement
regarding whatever the court had questions about. But most of the time
they\'d rather question you themselves.

Now if the vessel you salvaged *wasn\'t* abandoned (for example, at
least one of the crew was aboard and alive) things get messier.
Basicly, this means that that crewmember is still acting as an "agent"
for the owners, and all you will get is an award for "assisting" in
getting the ship back to port. Again, smart ship owners don\'t try to be
miserly about such awards, because you can appeal them to the admiralty
court, and they generally hand out reasonable rewards. 

Finally, if the ship/cargo has been abandoned long enough (20 years? 50
years? 100 years? I don\'t recall), it belongs to whoever can salvage
it. 

> The owner/operators are dead so does the ship belong to the bank?

The bank owns the portion that wasn\'t paid for. In your example, 30
years out of 40 had been paid off, so we\'ll say that the bank owned
25%, the "owner" owned 75% (in actuality, mortages pay off more slowly
than that, until quite close to the end most of your payments go
against *interest*, not the principal).

Anyway, that gives bank 25%, heirs of the "owner(s)" 75%. 

> Is it like a mortgage where an insurance policy pays off the balance

Depends. If there\'s that sort of insurance, then the bank gets paid
off and the heirs "own" it, subject to the legitimate salvage claims
like I listed above. 

If it has a more common sort of insurance, the *insurance* company may
wind up owning the bank\'s share, and even that of the heirs. Especially
if they\'ve been paid by the insurance company for the loss. 

>  Or does it belong to the salvaging PCs?

Sort of. See my comments above.

disgust at their actions, also an adrenalin rush, the

I gotta agree with this. You may not be able to stop an opponent from
talking or hear what is being said, but you can triangulate his position and
drop ordinance on him till he can\'t talk. That is a very simple low tech

I don\'t think he is. *I* have no problem keeping up with the pace of 
technological change. People younger than me (I was born in 1962) largely
are even better at it. Heck, kids today *anticipate* the changes -- to 
them, technological change is part of the environment and always has 
been, so they see it as normal and react accordingly.

If they would have put out a Pokemon RPG (putting aside for the moment
that Pokemon doesn\'t lend itself to an RPG), it would also have done
well. Part of the success of the CCG is due to the fact that *anything*
associated with Pokemon is making money hand over fist. Part of it is
that CCGs are easier for the younger set (the ones into Pokemon in the
first place) than RPGs are. And card collecting seems to go with that
age group -- at that age, I collected hockey cards. Meanwhile, you don\'t
see a lot of adults playing the Pokemon CCG unless they\'re playing it
with their kids.

Still, my acquaintances\' point was that CCGs would replace/displace RPGs
entirely, the way RPGs did with tabletop wargames. (Same person who tried
to recruit me into CAR-PGa, thinking that my library science professional
background and my skill with the written word would be of benefit to her
association... she didn\'t take it well when I told her what I thought of
her group.) I wonder what she thinks now -- it\'s been several years since
we\'ve had contact. (She moved to Seattle to take a job with WotC, of all
things!)

One twentieth? Somehow that doesn\'t seem right. I say,
thank the CCGs, for they have done a service and taken
the Rule Lawyers from our games. Rule Lawyers never
roleplayed, they just wanted to know all the rules so
that they could prevent their set of statistics on the
character sheet all being reduced to zero. Rules
Lawyers for this reason were also a source of
munchkinism. But most of them have gone to CCGs, since
CCGs are nothing but rules, no imagination required.
For this reason, I always have a pack of cards, magic,
or whatever\'s the cheapest, in case some new player
turns out to be a Rules Lawyer or munchkin. I hand him
that (him ain\'t sexist, never met a female gamer who
was a rules lawyer or munchkin) and we\'re all happy.

If RPGs are declining so much, why are there so bloody
many? The dream of GURPS has been realised, you can
roleplay anything, even a cowboy hunting undead, for
god\'s sake.

There has been a decline, I agree, but not _that_ much.

I agree with you here, but only if we assume that thinking (more so than
others anyway) individuals are less physically strong. This assumption,
however, sounds pretty reasonable, at least if training time is taken
into account.

If, however, we have a race which fights on pure instinct, the situation
changes. Since they no longer need combat practice, the thinking types
will have an advantage over the less intelligent ones, even in combat.
They simply know when to pick a fight and how to stack the odds.

I think this concept would be an interesting one for an alien race. They
would probably use their own species more or less as slaves ("or I will
kill you"), and they would have absolutely NO COMPASSION WHATSOEVER.
Wonderful for an encounter at a starport. They would surely break some
rules (perhaps by killing someone), but what happens when someone tries
to imprison them for their crime? More important, who will do the dirty
work? Surely no local policeman, although there just *might* be some PCs
handy...

Easy. They felt a driving need to wipe out the horrible meat-eaters in
the sky. Therefore, no matter how much they hated it, they stuffed
themselves into cramped ships and took off.

Possibly further back; the giant weird-shaped composite fuel tank that\'s
a key component of X-33 failed catastrophically in tests recently.

On the other hand, it\'s more than likely that a DC-X based X-33 would
have had its own problems (noteably with weight growth and the engines,

(Note that whichever company/design one, it would have been called X-33.)

Fair enough. In the beginning of his second chapter Postman points out that
crap is what television is good at. On his line the junk on television is
not the problem, the problem is that television doesn\'t stick to junk.

I think that he\'d agree with you that 90% of everything is crap. Even though
he is clearly in favor of the printed word, he also points out that more
crap has been printed than televised. That\'s not the point.

Like I said, I haven\'t read the work that you\'ve written, I can only imagine
what his argument would be like from what I have read. I would suspect his
question is whether or not these people *are* reacting accordingly, and if
their reactions are beneficial to society as a whole.

Of course, he may have had a lobotomy between 1984 and now...

It depends on what locations would have picked it up. WotC\'s card
distribution, at least in America, is *much* wider than the distribution of,
say, TSR\'s product line. You\'d be hard pressed to find a comic book shop
that didn\'t stock CCGs, and trading cards are a huge business in the United
States right now. Accordingly, there are many card-only shops. The major toy
chains also have sections for trading cards of all sorts.

Of course. This was one fad which I didn\'t expect to take off as quickly as
it did.

That goes without saying. The only problem with that line of reasoning is
that ages for Pokemon fandom are literally all over the map. It seems like
the franchise is popular for kids from 5 or 6 to about 16, which is a really
strange demographic. That\'s really fascinating because it straddles three
toy age groups.

>And card collecting seems to go with
>that age group -- at that age, I collected hockey cards.

Incidentally, sports card collecting among kids in the use has been
declining at an astonishing rate. The prices for card packs have been going
up sharply since the early 90s. Card companies are trying all kinds of
things to lure kids back into the fold with little success.

I would disagree with that. It\'s frequently claimed that CCGs are pulling
money away from RPGs, but it\'s significant to note that the sales of RPGs
were in decline even before CCGs came on the scene.

The industry may be smaller, but I\'m not sure that the market is smaller.
TSR and White Wolf have both expanded their product lines in a big way in
the last few years. I think the cold, hard truth is that TSR (after the
purchase by WotC) and White Wolf have both been doing something right.

I don\'t think that it\'s CRPGs which are pulling from the market. I think
that it\'s just computer games in general. Computer games are capable of
offering many of the same sorts of things that RPGs do. The old-fashioned GM
has been replaced by the level designer. Computer games are hassle free.
Your average kid can come home from school, get on the net and play Quake
III or Unreal Tournament for a few hours, while RPGs require much more
structure, and much more hassle.

I\'d wager money that most of the people on this list, even though they
consider themselves roleplayers, aren\'t currently involved in a campaign.
That\'s not an attack on anybody, that\'s merely the reality of the situation.

I was watching a current affairs prog late night on tellie a few months agao
and the guests were an academic who had written a book on men in combat, the
other a COL from the US army, ex special forces. 

In regards to percentage hit ratios the COL remarked (to the effect of); "An
excellent in combat hit ratio is 40% for police or infantry. In a recent
school yard shooting spree, the two kids were getting rates of 80-90%"
<please don\'t flame on the numbers, it was some time ago>.

When asked of why these children had \'scored\' so highly, the COL put it down
to the ever increasing realism of combat simulators in arcades which had
given these children the ability to shoot at real people as they were so
much more like the targets in the game (as opposed to silhouettes). 

Pretty funky huh. 

There\'s a new arcade game out called sniper - a typical gun arcade box but
the weapon is a scoped rifle (you play a SWAT dude). Woah man there\'s some
issues with one of those suckers. 

Ob Traveller: In a high tech universe, said simulators would be hard to
distinguish from reality they\'d be that good. Hit rates would probably be
very high indeed.

What about PC\'s on an IISS mission to "Explore this system, lads."  Does the
PC in charge of the mission remain on board while the others go down and
deal with all the dangerous encounters?  Doesn\'t make for an exciting night
for the leader\'s player I\'d think if the session went for several hours and
the leader just sat there reading a Dragon mag or a comic?  For the same
reason, I think the away team in the ST universe contains senior officers,
similar rules?  But that\'s just me, it\'s not for realism as much as "fun?"

How can you have a semi-automatic "burst"? This I

Got ideas on that Mars probe, eh?

Here\'s a question thats confused me:  How would the 3I
characterize the difference between \'salvage rights\' and
\'prizes\'? Do the terms overlap, or are they meant to
distiguish between craft recovered by civilians vs. craft
recovered by the military?

are needed for instellar trade.

No-one seems to have agreed on even the order of
magnitude of citizens of the Imperium, but S. John
Ross in the article reckons a settled world with a
healthy economy will have a shipping traffic of two
tons (one export, one import, talking short tons, not
displacemt tons here) per person per year. 

Now I\'m figuring a few things here:
1) At least half the galctic paopulation lives on
"settled worlds with a healthy economy" (since mining
worlds, barren worlds and the like will have far elss
people)
2) There\'s at least 1 dton of ship for every 14 tons
(ie short tons) of cargo (that is, half the ship\'s
bulk is cargo
3) Less than 1% of such cargo is carried by PC-style
"free traders."

This gives us a formula for calcuating the tonnage of
PC-style ships in the Imperium:
Td = P/28/12 x 0.01 = p x 0.0233
   Td = Tonnage (dtons)
   P= Population
   /28 because of displ. tons to short tons
conversion, times 2 for import/export
   /12 because ships make on average one round trip a
month
   x 0.01 because only 1% of traffic is free trader
traffic

Even if you population is on the down estimate side,
(say, 650 billion: a hundred million per each of half
the 11,000 worlds, forgetting Alsan, Hivers etc) you
get pretty huge numbers of free traders running around
out there; divide this dtonnage number by, say, 500,
to get the number of ships. (You get from this 1300
million)

_This_ is why I say, mortgages don\'t work so well in

of debts on cars - so long as you don\'t mind leaving

people, of course, don\'t want to leave their home

Both the velocity loss due to atmosphere *and* the ship adding velocity

IMHO/IMTU:

The term "prizes" refers to ships and/or cargo _seized_ through
legitimate means.  Thus, military vessels engaged in commerce raiding,
privateers, patrol ships performing customs duties, and civilian vessels
that defeat would-be pirates all can claim their vanquished foes as
"prizes."  Neither the original owner of the prize ship or cargo, nor
any creditors of the prize ship\'s or cargo\'s owner, have any claim to
the prize.

Note that pirates often refer to their victims as "prizes."  This in no
way confers any legal rights to the pirates, as piracy is not a
"legitimate" activity.

"Salvage rights", OTOH, refers to the right of a civilian ship\'s captain
and crew to monetary gain in exchange for _finding_ a ship or cargo in
distress, and assisting that ship and/or cargo in reaching a safe port. 
The original owner of the ship or cargo, as well as any creditors of the
ship or cargo in question, may have rights, in accordance with Admiralty
law.  Generally speaking, special Admiralty courts will adjudicate and
enforce the rights of the various parties involved.

One of Marc Steigler\'s early books has a weapons system that uses that
sort of info to locate company, regimental or even battalion command
centers (forgive me if I got that ranking out of order). Then it pounds
them flat. 

Sort of an infantry version of the "kill the command tank" bit that

Which is why my idea of the "best" "simple invention that chages the
world beyond recognition" is a communications device that is
*inherently* untappable. You "tune" to a receiver, and if it is "free"
you connect and can exchange info. If someone else is connected, you
can\'t "connect" and in neither case can you determine *where* the
receiver is. Range, maybe. Bearing? Nope!

So you can\'t triangulate and you can\'t intercept. Nor can you "jam" a
unit unless they drop the link. So everybody\'d just leave it up. Or
leave it turned off until they needed it.

First it\'d drive "spooks" nuts, because they unless they actually
*locate* a spy\'s comm gear they can\'t tell if he\'s got any!

Next it\'d ELINT types crazy, because there\'d be no intercepts. 

Then comes the fun when folks start using it for stuff like remotely
piloted vehicles.

Or the stunt I\'ve described many a time. 

Pop into a system well out of the ecliptic, and several AU from any of
the planets. Monitor to your heart\'s content for 5 days or so, then
jump back to base with the info. 

As long as you vary the location, there\'s not a *damn* thing the
defenders can do about it. Even if they had *dozens* of ships out there
patrolling, the odds of any of them being close enough to make an
*unobserved* approach on the "spy ship" are quite literally
astronomical. 

You\'d even use military ships, with military crews (at least during
wartime). That way they can\'t even be treated as "spies" if they
somehow *do* get intercepted.

Yeah, but if it registers as a "near miss" from "Atomic Annie" you\'re
screwed anyway. :-)

On the other hand, at high TL\'s certain aspects of supply get truly
weird. 

For example, for a (non-Traveller) game long ago I postulated a hand
weapon that had an *antimatter* power cell. Picture a "pistol phaser"
that can put out a 100 MW beam for about a century. 

Sure, that\'s TL18 or higher. But it makes for *major* tactical changes
when "running out of ammo" isn\'t a consideration.

It was also handy being able to plug use the same power cell for
everything from pistols on up thru small craft! Open the power storage
area of an "air raft" or a "ship\'s boat" and here are a bunch of the
same cells you use in the pistol. There are a "bunch" because they are
*intended* as spares for portable equipment, and merely serve as a
*backup* to the power plant. They also allow transferring "fuel"
between the cells rather than having to transfer *power* (which is a
*lot* slower!)

Actually, I can see another possibile solution, if electronics keeps
getting smaller/cheaper, and computing power keeps on climbing for a while.

Just "seed" the area with disposable, short-ranged encrypted relays.
Actually "relay" is a bad term. More like an IP router. 

So you are only transmitting to the nearest router, which sends
packets to other routers according top whatever looks like the best
route that millisecond. After a few hops it hits the bigger routers at
and behind your lines. 

Between spread spectrum and low power, you\'d be lucky to pick up the
transmitters the *soldiers* are using from even a klick away. 

If the routers are small and cheap enough, you just lob them in along
with the "softening up" artillery barrage.

the 35 ton pinnace used on the Kinunir BC. While I decided
that the ship was somewhere in the 400-600 ton range, the
1500t vote got me to thinking about an annoyance I had
with Adv.1. There are not a lot of Kinunirs, yet there would
seem to be a need for a multi-role ship of that type. This

*those* people to the authorities. The updating is done using high TL
cryptography, so any sophisticated attempt to bypass the security will cost
more to mount than the ship is worth. There is some sort of grace period,
say 90 days, before the transponder stops functioning normally. Or the grace
period may be configurable, so that with permission (that is advance

envision this service being performed by a trusted third party, neither the

provides. Planetary? Imperial?

Just in case anyone is curious, a number of companies today are developing
the technology to use cryptographic techniques to limit access to goods or
services to paying customers.  You can create digital music which you need
to pay per listening for, and so forth. By advanced TLs, this will be a very
advanced technology. I assume that some of the really dangerous toys (FGMPs,
Battle Dress, nuclear weapons, etc) will have some sort of advanced
technology preventing unauthorized use. You can steal it, but you can\'t use
it.

You might even have civilian shipboard weapons locked up in a very secure
way, so that strict licensing requirements for their operation can be
enforced. For example, in peaceful regions of space it may be illegal to
have weapons unlocked. When you travel to the more dangerous places, you
apply for a license for the use of your weapons. A suitable government
representative performs the unlocking for you, which is only valid for a
preset interval.

Another application is to shipboard software. You use a cryptographic
technique of some sort to activate the software. This way you can\'t just
make a copy of that Predict-12 program for your friends to use.

Actually, the "size" of a Kelvin and a degree Celcius are
identical.  Converting from one scale to the other is a
matter of adding or subtracting 273.15 of those units.  I\'m
guessing that the author(s) of the text you are working
from rounded this down to 273 (a common practice for
approximations).  So, they aren\'t mixing them, the
addition of 273 is a conversion factor.  The result (4.245)
is a Kelvin measure, so you don\'t subtract it from the
base.  That would only give you a cold pole temp of less
than 6 deg. C.  I believe the correct temp would be
slightly less than -269 deg. C.

Not if there were much of an axial tilt.  Even as far south
as Cicilly, Alaska ( ;-) ) they have days (and nights) that
last for several weeks.  Can you imagine what it would be
like to have darkness for 3+ years at a stretch?  You would
not, probably could not, stay in that place "year round."

If you come across a ship that you proceed to

I believe that that piece of footage was a stock piece

I agree with you that if some player is going to have a boring time due
to some realistic rule that easily can be bent it should be bent. The problem
with Star Trek is that the impropable and unrealistic takes totally over.

I saw a ST episode a couple of weeks back were the Enterprise come upon this
apparently dead world that used to be the HQ of a armsselling race. An
away team is sent to investigate, Data, Riker and Tasha Yar. They get 
cut out from the Enterprise "beam me up"-escape route and attacked by
some kind of weapon that encases Riker in suspension. It\'s impossible
to beam out of there, there is some kind of weapon there that has attacked
the away team. Who do they send down to help? Not the 1st security team
lead by Worf in Battle dress and with heavy guns together with a med
team. No, no, no!!!! Send the captain and the cheif medical officer, both
unarmed. The captain wasn\'t wearing anything but his red suit! (And he 
didn\'t get killed either).

It might seem like fun to you, but that just broke the line for me as 
utterly incompetent and stupid. Are the writers of the show that brain-dead
that they couldn\'t write an episode about machines-taking-over-and-destroying-
its-makers without letting the crew seem like total fools and morons.

With all the modern technology available, I\'m surprised
that someone hasn\'t integrated a computer with voice
recognition software.  You talk to in the mic just like
normal, the computer digitally records your words and
sends it out at say 56 K.  Even with a redundant copy to
verify from, a two minute report would take less than a
10th of a second to transmit.  While there would be a lag
time of the same length as the time it takes you to say
your piece, I would imagine that the safety factor would
more than make up for the annoyance factor.  Well, it
would for me anyhow.

Or worse, money still owing on it. Unless, of course,
the ship\'s transponder, source of the IFF freqs and,
apparently, the "oh bugger we forgot to pay the
mortgage again" signal, or ship\'s licence plate
number, is housed, unless this has been blown out...
which raises another solution for PCs with too much
time and debt on their hands... forget breaking the
codes, rip out the transponder! No more code problem.
Of course that\'s a problem in the more lawful parts of
space, but hey, most PCs I\'ve seen don\'t mind sticking
to the more lawless parts... A bit like not having
your licence plate in NYC, as opposed to not having it
in Guatamala...

They are pulling money away from RPGs, however I don\'t think that CCGs are 
going to kill RPGs.  I just think that there is now another thing that a 
gamer would spend his money on, and thus the amount of money that is 
normally channeled into RPGs is reduced.

As for RPG sales being in decline, I absolutely agree with you.  Don\'t 
blame CCGs.  They are a factor, but it also falls on business/marketing 
decisions as well (just ask GDW on both counts).

The overall influx of money that goes into the market _is_ smaller than was 
before.  Is it temporary?  A sign of things to come, or just a statistical 
fluke?  Beats the heck out of me.  Regardless, a lot of companies that were 
on "the gravy train" and made money from their games no matter what crap 
they put out had to seriously readjust their business mentality.  The smart 
companies readjusted to the changing market, and have aggressively tried to 
retake the market.  Personally, I think WW, SJ Games, TSR and few others 
have their heads screwed on straight and are planning for the future, 
rather than milking the industry dry as it sinks like a stone.

I agree that CRPGs are not RPGS.  CCGs are a whole different animal all 
together.

What I am talking about is that all of those types of games are aiming for 
the disposable income of your average gamer.

A gamer only has so much to spend on, so if you want to pick up a "few" 
booster packs of the latest MtG set, most likely you will pass on picking 
up Far Trader until next month.  If you decide to spend you cash on Alpha 
Centauri, there is less going the direction of Pokemon.

If it\'s up to me to save the game industry, I\'m going to be asking for a 
raise. :)

Ironically, I know of several people who were very good roleplayers who 
switched to playing nothing but CCGs simply because all of their gaming 
buddies were also spending cash on CCGs, and not RPGs.  They didn\'t have to 
worry about the gamers flaking an cancelling at the last minute, what time 
the game started or ends, or if the plot was going to get boring or 
not.  Get anyone who plays the game together, pull out your decks, and you 
are set for about an hour or two.  The thing that made me stop buying CCGs 
wasn\'t the fact that there were wasn\'t roleplaying potential for it, rather 
if your buddy has more money invested in having the rare ultra cool cards, 
odds were against you winning.

Regardless, any chunk of the RPG market (including Rules Lawyers) who stop 
buying games and start up another hobby, hurts the industry.

It was clunky as all hell, but I could do that back when I first bought 
Champions.  On the other hand, Hero Games, is a company that seems to be on 
life support right now.

I personally believe that the industry is getting stronger.  It took 
several *serious* hits in the last few years, and things were shaken up 
pretty severely.  However, I don\'t believe that there are more *active* 
companies right now than there were in the past.  IMHO, the strongest 
companies are consolidating their hold of the industry and churning out 
tons and tons of supplements.  In between the big guys are a few companies 
making a decent showing, and a lot of fly by night operations that flare 
momentarily and then vanish into obscurity.  As far as I can tell, the 
entire market isn\'t even remotely the size it was during the late eighties 
or early nineties, however it is improving dramatically.

I think that there are a lot of games on the shelves, simply because to 
sell a game, you need to hook someone and then pump out supplement after 
supplement to feed their addiction and pay your bills.  Just take a look at 
how huge the White Wolf, TSR, SJ Games, and Palladium Games sections of 
your game store is compared to say, Holistic Design or Dream Pod 9.  A lot 
of supplements of a few companies, a smattering of rare games, products of 
terminally ill/dead companies and obscure games tend to fill up the 
retailers shelves.

The few major companies put out tons of material.  They are trying to win 
back the market by being aggressive.  Supplements = 
advertising.  Supplements don\'t sell as well as the core rulebooks, but the 
money you lose on them are made up by sales of the core rulebooks. Those 
major companies, like it or not, tend to be the lifeblood of the industry, 
since they draw the majority of the gamers into the store in the first 
place.  Retailers stock up on those supplements, even though they don\'t 
sell nearly as well as the core rulesbooks.  The end result is that you 
have huge shelf spaces taken up by Vampire Clanbooks, GURPS Genrebooks and 
AD&D\'s Complete Book of Fill-In-The-Blanks.  Most likely, some of those 
books will be sitting on those shelves for a long long time, simply because 
no one in your area has a desire to pick up the Euthanatos Tradition Book, 
while the Tzimisce Clanbook is flying off the shelves.

Medium sized companies make enough to pay the bills with a very small 
staff, and thus the rate new books that are released is significantly 
different compared to, say, SJ Games.  They have enough loyal customers to 
make a retailer stock them, however they don\'t fly off the shelves like the 
major companies.  DP9\'s Southern Republic Leaguebook is going to have a 
much longer shelf life than the Ravnos Clanbook will.  Where these games 
thrive the most is on the internet, and online stores, where Heavy Gear 
fans scattered over the globe can get the latest fix of life on Terra 
Nova.  Odds are their local game store doesn\'t have racks of DP9 books, and 
if they do, I bet they don\'t have racks of Fading Suns, or Star Trek, or ...

The smaller companies don\'t tend to put much out at all.  A book here, a 
book there.  The interest for a relatively small game isn\'t that 
stimulated, and so the books aren\'t flying off the shelves.  Thus, they 
make less money back, and it takes longer for them to put out another 
book.  Usually, when you see their book in the game store, it\'s the same 
book you saw last week.  Not only that, but the company might have gone out 
of business a few years ago, and the book is still sitting on the shelves.

With all that said, I believe that the sales of RPGs are steadily getting 
better and better.  The major companies have generally revamped their 
systems and poured new lifeblood into their books.  White Wolf, for 
example, has cut out a lot of the crap they did in their previous works, 
and focused on fine tuning their game system and stimulated the interest of 
players by making a more interesting and engaging setting.  Most players 
are flocking to the store to buy one of the major companies products, and 
then from their they branch out into other games.  Vampire fans become Mage 
fans, which become Fading Suns or Over the Edge fans.


>There has been a decline, I agree, but not _that_ much.

While I agree that 1/20th sounds pretty crazy, the people quoting it are 
the ones with their fingers on the pulse of the industry.  Now, since the 
sampling of how well games sell is not even remotely exact, I have no doubt 
that that figure is off a bit.  Game companies and distributors don\'t 
exactly share their financial data, and any sampling will be bound to be 
inaccurate.  How much, and in what direction, I have no clue.

Personally, I\'m not that suprised with that figure.  Remember Hero Games, 
Iron Crown, R. Talsorian or West End Games?  They aren\'t dead, but they 
certainly aren\'t moving very fast.  :(

Can we have a GT:Law instead of GT:Nobles ?  8-P

If that\'s a small treatise on salvage law (and I thank Glenn for his insight, no really, I learned something from that), then what can we expect on some of the other common starship concerns ?

A very good point.  Here in the uSA, most folks believe
the perception and don\'t bother to learn the truth.  The
united States Constitution is still the supreme law of the
land and each state has a constitution and that
constitution is still the supreme law of that state.  If you
understand our legal system, you will find that most of the
codes in fact do not apply to you unless you allow them
to.  Most of the codes are blatantly unconstitution, except
for one little thing.  Legally speaking, "shall" and "must"
means "may."  So, where the code says something like,
"In order to use public hiways and roads, a driver must be
licenced by the D.M.V."  What it really means is, "In order
to use public hiways and roads, a driver may be licenced
by the D.M.V."

I tried to explain to someone why I don\'t have a driver\'s
licence and he just wouldn\'t understand.  In spite of the
spin doctors press to the contrary, we still live in a
republic and those who are willing can still live as free
solvereigns.  The right to travel is still guarenteed by the
uS Constitution (9th Ammendment) and I still have the
right to travel without interferance by anyone, including
people in costume who claim to be public servants
provided I don\'t break the law (and I don\'t mean the
code, most of which does not apply to me anyway).

I tried to explain that getting a licence would obligate me
in ways that I didn\'t want to be obligated and that I could
avoid, just by not having a drivers licence.  I explained
that I didn\'t drive and he said that he had seen me driving.
I told him that legally speaking, I no longer drove, which is
a commercial activity, but he just couldn\'t or wouldn\'t
understand.  But, that okay, he doesn\'t have to as long as
I do.  And I guarentee you that the judges understand it
quite well.

Ob Trav:  I suggested adding a little ethical spice to a
senario offered a few days ago that is based upon this
very idea.

D\'oh!  Leave it to me to rant about something, and then notice you said 
something completely different when I reread what you really said.  I hope 
reply didn\'t generate any bad vibes.

I totally agree with your assessment of computer games.  I said CRPGs, but 
I should have said computers games in general.

I am involved in about four different campaigns that meet at least once a 
month, one of them meeting twice a month.  As for Traveller, I play it 
whenever I run a convention game (three to four times a year).  My current 
batch of players *hate/loathe* most sci fi games. :(

Come back over here, Kyle. There\'s effectively no retail outlet for 
rpgs in the lower North Island (that I know of, anyway). This means 
that those of us without Credit Cards have no cost effective way of 
buying new product.

RPGs may be thriving, but not here.

I am, but only once per fortnight. However most of us aren\'t at school 
any more. When I was at school we would play a couple of hours in the 
week, plus about 6 in the weekend, every school week. It\'s simple 
degeneracy in the modern youth, that\'s all :)

Could it simply be that those kids were not being shot at? Or that they 
had no empathy for others? Either (or both) of these reasons could 
equally well explain their high hit rate, as could the lack of 
effective evasion by their victims.

Here in Christchurch there are still two comic shops selling RPGs, but
they only stock \'mainstream\' games (Call of Cthulhu, D&D, Mage et al,
and GURPS). There was a shop that specialised in RPGs (Mind Games)
but that folded two years ago. However RPGs do seem to be fairly
healthy down here in the south.

There were a couple of \'macro maps\' showing system position in these

anywhere. Can anyone give me any leads?

Continuing on the issue of astrography, has anyone gone through and
corrected the existing stellar data (to match stars better with the

Is there a name for the system that is in hex 0933 of Delphi sector?

True if the map is for comunications rather than travel. You are right 
that your limit makes more sense for comunications but most 
traveller game maps would be more concerned with travel, IMHO.

Still, in either case, it is better than .1 parsec.

>the real world?

Assuming all ships in your Traveller Universe are registered with a central 
authority and have a Transponder. It should be possible to trace the legal 
owner of any vessel. If the owner was killed when whatever happened to the 
vessel happened then the vessel register should also contain the next of 
kin.

But what if theres outstanding finance?
If there was money outstanding on the vessel that has not been paid then the 
ship may have been reposessed by the bank in which case the ship register 
will have changed to show the banks ownership. If it hasn\'t been reposessed 
then the next of kin will inherit a large debt and a wrecked ship.

Insurance?
If you have found someone insane enough to insure a vessel, and they pay out 
on the policy, the ship now belongs to them and is probably listed on their 
accounts as an asset. But again they would now be listed as the legal owner 
on in the ship register.

So nearly all ships have a legal owner, so whats the point in salvaging. 
Well for some ships it may be impossible to trace the owners in which case 
the ship could become the property of the salvager after a period of time. 
Ships from outside the imperium are eligible for salvage (eg, the Annic Nova 
in DA1). Ships that the issurance companies eventually write off are 
salvageable and if your feeling kind you could allow the salvagers to take 
ownership of any cargo on recovered ships even if an owner is found.

This way the PC\'s can make some money out of salvage but not so much that 
they have fleets of ships.

There was a note from DGP in either TD or MTJ which  stated  that
they  not  only  had  no  intention  of  mapping  out  all  these
additional sectors in detail, but they felt that to do  so  would
limit  Referee\'s  freedom  to   invent   their   own   universes.
Consequently after generating these macro maps their data  (which
was positional only) was deliberatly thrown away.  (Of course you
can determine this data from the maps themselves.)

Yup.  And I was lucky  enough  to  attend  a  special  completely
uncensored screening of Hellraiser II, where I got  Clive  Barker
to sign my copy of the video of the first film.

Has anyone ever used \'the  box\'  in  their  Traveller  campaigns?

I have -- I know a female gamer who is also a munchkin. One
who has other unwelcome qualities. On two separate occasions,
two different games, she decided her character wasn\'t working
out the way she wanted, and asked the GM if she could change
characters. On both occasions, the new character was virtually
a clone of the original. On the second occasion, the GM flatly
refused to allow the new character, on those very grounds. She
left the game after throwing a hissy fit over the issue. Many of
the rest of us did the Dance of Joy when she was finally gone...
including the GM.

To be fair, of the several female gamers I\'ve known, she is the
only munchkin example, and I\'ve never known a female rules lawyer.

"Beneficial to society as a whole", from the perspective of what *he* deems

Interesting. Most teenagers around here see Pokemon as something for "little
kids", as if they\'re trying to show how cool and/or sophisticated they are
by distancing themselves from the phenomenon -- it gives them a tangible
focus for differentiating themselves from their younger peers.

My American contemporaries no doubt collected baseball cards at the time
I was collecting hockey cards.

As soon as they became a hot item for adults to collect, the card companies
reacted by making the cards for the adult collector audience, rather than
the kids. Prices also rose, since adults can afford more than the kids can.
As long as your primary market is the kids spending their allowance, you
keep prices low. (Pokemon can get away with high pricing for their cards,
since it\'s the parents who get cajoled into buying them...)

(Reminds me of a recent episode of South Park, which parodied the Pokemon
craze...)

Semi automatic.  THe weapon was not automatic, one trigger pull equals one
round.  However, the weapon was a gravity loader and did not require a pump
action.

Burst.  I fired three times in quick succession.  Technically not a burst as
one trigger pull did not fire three rounds.  However, i wanted to convey the
impression that i fired rapidly at the same target and not sprayed willy
nilly like some actor.

Cannonball splash.  You all jumped off a diving board and done a cannonball
into the water.  When the paintball hit it literally splashed in just such a
fashion with blaze orange color.

Glorious.  It was.  Does that mean i can\'t wait to get training and go into
a real shooting war?  F*** that, i never want to be on the same continent as
a war.  That said, i would serve my country if called upon ( despite being
too old ) but would probably be a Star Trek red shirt my only time under
fire.

Moral Dilemna.  When i first joined this tangent i said i wondered about a
sport ( paintball ) where you have to point a gun at somebody and pull a
trigger.  I am not comfortable with that and that\'s why i haven\'t played in
five years.  However, can a case be made that a paintball is so clearly
different from a regular firearm that it doesn\'t matter if i point it at
somebody and shoot him?  I don\'t know.  Barring an answer i won\'t play
again.

Now that i\'ve left the ranks of the lurkers i hope this answers some
questions.

Wait a minute. If Sunbeard steals my company\'s Patrol Cruiser, and

Far Trader?



I think the above needs to be amended to cover stolen property used
in the commission of a crime. Otherwise, you\'ll have another reason
we  won\'t be seeing mortgages on starships.

Here\'s a thought:
If the Captain of such a new ship breaks a bad smuggling law and his ship 
gets seized, does the bank lose all their interest in the ship as well?
Or does the mortgage contract have a clause that, if the Captain ever
uses his ship in a fashion that will get it seized, he is immediately 
considered to be in breach of contract, and *no longer* the legitimate
owner of the vessel? His possession of it could then be considered
illegitimate, and the seized ship ight have to be returned to the rightful
owner (the bank) as recovered stolen property used in the commission
of a crime, rather than retained by the seizing government. 

The bank would love this, but I could see some governments claiming that 
the bank had hired the Captain to do just this kind of thing. Especially
if the exact same Far Trader gets snagged two months from now, with
a different Captain, and the bank\'s lawyers primed and ready with the
same arguments.

	I like the Captain Cook model myself.  Sure there is risk to
	the officer who has cost a lot to train, but there is also
	a risk in letting a less-trained officer make first contact
	with a new civilization.  Of course, not all landing parties
	involve first contact, but the judgement of the senior
	officer aboard may be valuable in a lot of ways.

	Also remember that the captain may just want to see the world
	for her/himself (that may be why they signed up in the first
	place).  The captain may also be itching to get off the ship
	after long periods in relatively cramped quarters.  Every
	officer is different, of course, but unless regulations
	prohibit such actions some captains may insist on getting
	their hands dirty (some may even find a way around certain
	regulations).

	Finally, there is the fun factor.  Wherever possible, I like
	to have the PCs in charge.  If there is a commanding officer,
	I almost always want it to be a PC.  If that PC prefers to
	stay out of the action, that\'s OK, but if they want to go
	down with the first landing party, that\'s great.  I don\'t
	really think that a totally realistic universe would be all
	that fun to RPG in (see the Real World (tm)), so I don\'t mind
	allowing the PCs a little latitude in this regard.

Thus we have the 3-6 man crews on Scout Ships, Safari Ships,

small enough, and the "Captain" is also the security officer, air/raft
driver, third packbearer on the left or other role that requires him to 
get his hands dirty - too many hats, not enough people for him to
be just "Captain".

BZZZT...thankyew for playing.

Exhibit A: H. sapiens. Happily killing each other in numbers large and
small for millions of years, constantly inventing more and better ways of 
doing so. 

Now the dominant mammal on the planet.

(after the rat, of course, but the rats will always win. I\'m just happy
we don\'t lay eggs...that\'s how they got the dinosaurs.)

Question: How do you feel about fencing? As a sport, that is? And how is
paintball different in it\'s moral implications.

My, how topics wander.

ObTrav: MILES gear too unrealistic and easy to spoof? Maybe duels in the

bullets that perform like the real things yet have the ability to adjust
their velocity to make them safe during the critical moments before a hit.

Not if they\'re using frequency hopping, LOS systems (if they\'re

how to you intercept or track a laser beam?) compressed signals, etc.

> What, he argues *against* quality television shows???

It depends on what you mean by "quality". If you mean, say, shows that tell
a compelling story through picture and sound (what television is good at),
then no, he doesn\'t argue against quality television. In fact, he makes the
claim that television doesn\'t take that job seriously enough. If, on the
other hand, you mean "quality" in the sense of programs with marginal
educational content, or some sort of lasting informational content, then
yes, he does argue against quality television.

When people make claims that there is too much crap on television, they
usually mean that "good" programs will be educational in nature. In this
sense, Sesame Street would be good, while, say Power Rangers would be bad.
He\'s not arguing against a better Power Rangers, he\'s arguing against any
sort of Sesame Street at all.

That doesn\'t mean that he\'s arguing that kids shouldn\'t be educated, just
that giving them something which kind of resembles an education through a
series of unconnected, commercial length vignettes may not be such a great
idea. It is his argument that perhaps education should not be the domain of
*entertainment*, and specifically an entertainment medium in which short and
non-challenging segments are absolute requirements. To support

In the same vein, but on a different topic, he argues that the American
political process has been changed fundamentally, for the worse, by the
integration of television into the political process, for the same reason.
The coarse version of his argument is: Perhaps our candidates should not be
selected on the basis of how photogenic they are, or how well they can spit
out one-line soundbites.

This is the direction that television goes *naturally*, because this is what
television is best at.

> "Beneficial to society as a whole", from the perspective of what *he*
>deems valuable in a society, which may or may not be what others
>find valuable.

One can argue, convincingly, that the "game of marbles" style of politics
that has been standard in America since the advent of television is *not*
beneficial to society as a whole, as one example.

To move away from Postman now, I\'ll inject my own comments:

Your claim is that the youth of today are reacting appropriately to new
technologies as they appear. I hope that\'s a fair characterization. I would
disagree with this wholeheartedly. I\'m a *huge* movie buff. I go to see lots
of new movies. I suspect you\'ve gathered that much already from our offlist
correspondence. My moviegoing experience has changed since the advent of the
beeper, but even moreso since the advent of the cellphone. Now it\'s
extremely common to hear one or more people in the audience receive a
cellphone call or a page. It\'s also common for people nearby to call their
friends to tell them how cool the scene they just saw was, or how they got
suckered into going to see a terrible movie. Don\'t even get me started on
laser pointers... you haven\'t lived until you\'ve seen a stylized hand with
an extended middle finger superimposed over Keanu Reeves\'s face in The
Matrix, or a dinosaur head superimposed devouring Will Smith in Enemy of the
State. Then there is that growing segment of people, kids and older folks
alike, who treat the movie-going experience as if they were watching a
really big screen TV at home, chatting throughout the entire movie.

I\'ll admit, I haven\'t done a study on this or anything, but I do know that
even in my relatively short experience as a movie freak, that the experience
of going to the movies has deteriorated immensely as a result of the
inappropriate integration of technology into everyday life... even *if* you
remove the chatting in movie theaters, which may be controversial and it
might be argued was always with us. I would disagree, personally, simply
because there was a lot less of it when I was growing up.

Having been the recipient of email bombs sent by kids who don\'t like to have
their points argued against on Usenet (points which, coincidentally, smacked
of television slogan-mongering). Having been in a class where a student,
upon receiving a cellphone call, argued with the teacher that he was a
paying customer, and as such had some sort of moral right to receive calls
whenever they came in, whether or not those calls were distracting to the
class.

I will continue to maintain that there *are* inappropriate responses to
technology, and the ones I\'ve illustrated exist purely on a personal level.
I don\'t even want to begin to speculate on what the impact of these
technologies are on a broader level. For example, television networks have
been taking it upon themselves to define (or perhaps redefine) American
morality through commercial length snippets. In these little "morality"
commercials, you will frequently hear comments such as, "...violence is
*never* the solution to *any* problem." There are also frequent
exhortations, frequently aimed at children, to talk to a counselor or
therapist.

Which brings us back to the point that I raised in my first post on the
subject, the thread which resulted has now strayed off topic. I can bring it
back on topic, and indeed would like to. Unfortunately, in just over two
hours I will be battling (to the death, I might add) with Impressionism,
Expressionism, German Expressionism and Non-Objective Art in my Art History
final.

My interest is not purely academic, as I have the hefty sum of one American
dollar riding on whether or not Cezanne\'s "The Great Bathers" ends up
projected on the wall during our exam.

It could be argued that most toys for children, with the exception of *some*
action figures (and even then, not the accessories) must be bought by the
parents.

Ach, then maybe her job wasn\'t all that secure. One wonders *why* someone

on the editorial staff for an RPG.

This, unfortunately, does not mean that the alien race lacks any eagerness to kill humans.  If the alien race is sufficiently weird looking, I suspect the reverse might also prove true.

I can\'t think of any higher life form which fights purely on instinct.  I\'m not sure its even possible without \'uber-DNA\' or some other similar method of transferring skills between generations.  In any case, the problem is that a race which has a tendency to kill its own kind will probably wipe itself out, intelligent or not.

Of course, a race which had children in litters might be more violent, since killing off a few extra individuals is basically good in that case.  Perhaps a mutant form of hiver ;)

Yah, I was in for 4.5 years, and thought of becoming an MLB cox\'n, but got 
out before getting around to it. Served 2.5 years on the only buoy 
tender/icebreaker on Lake Superior, though. One nor\'easter coming across 
Superior was crashing wave over the parking lot of Split Rock Lighthouse 
(said parking lot was 90+ feet ABOVE the lake!). Worst seas I ever sailed on 
were 15-foot.

Remind me sometime to post my analysis on why Star Trek\'s Starfleet most 
resembles the Coast Guard more than any other current service.

What is a munchkin?

I\'ve known a very few obnoxious female gamers, but they were all obnoxious
because their partners had dragged them along and they didn\'t really want
to be there.  They weren\'t really gamers at all and they drove me nuts
because they tended to assume the same of me, except when I RAN the games.

This now goes into property forfiture laws, which usually work to the 
advantage of the government. So, in the above situation, the ship would 
_probably_ go to the government, even though they may recognize the mortgage 
contract as vaild.

Well, _I_ use it as a more insulting version of \'powergamer.\' I think it may 
also have some age connotations with it as well (a 14-year old is more 
likely to be referred as a munchkin than a 24-year old).

A munchkin is the player who sells the ship they get as mustering out
benefits to buy TL16 Battledress with a FGMP-16.

Then wears it _everywhere_.

A munchkin is the D&D Player that insists they can have a 90th level
Fighter/Mage/Cleric/Paladin character with +6(18) strength, intelligence,
and wisdom, a +6 sword and +6 armor.

A munchkin should _never_ be allowed to roll their own dice ;-)

Somewhere on the net is floating the great 4 classes of RPG player lists:
Munchkin, Role Player, Loonie and He-Man.

ie:

When the party faces a Red Dragon, 

The He-Man challenges it to single combat with daggers.
The Munchkin blows it away with their FGMP-16.
The Role Player engages it in a philosophical discussion of the nature of
Evil.
The Loonie asks it to barbeque a hot dog on a stick.

etc, etc...on and on for pages and pages.

Anyone have a current reference  or url?

Considering how much of the 3I government *is* corporate interests,
I\'m thinking we\'ll see the government and the interested bank
working things out. Of course, if the interested bank were Hortalez et Cie,
they\'d work out a much better resolution on their own behalf than if the
interested bank were "Mom & Pop\'s Starship Savings & Loan of Leedor".

Official of the Planet Pinata: "I\'m sorry, sir, but _Bareback Potemkin_ 
was seized during a normal customs enforcement sweep. I realize that 
your bank has an ownership claim on this vessel, but our planet\'s
laws on smuggling Comparative Sociology Tapes is quite clear
and direct. We are entirely within our rights under Imperial law to sustain 
these forfieture proceedings as well." 

Representative of Hortalez Et Cie: <Silently places mortgage papers
on the table for the Planet Pinanta\'s DownPort, UpPort, flotilla of 
Subsidized Merchants, and seven Atmosphere Processing Plants.
Each one has the clauses involving "conditions for payment on demand"
highlighted in yellow holo-ink...>

Now, how about when two private parties are involved, rather than a
bank vs a planetary (or Imperial) government? Sunbeard steals my ship,
you capture it when he attacks you, have you seized a prize that is
yours free and clear, or have you recovered my stolen property?

Close.  It doesn\'t matter (much) whether the
recovering party is civilian or military; rather, the
distinction hinges on the recovered ship.

A prize is ship captured during wartime.  Either a
civilian or a naval ship may be a prize.  

A salvage is a lost, derelict, or distressed ship that
has been recovered or rescued.  Only civilian ships
may become salvage; naval ships remain the property of
their government, free of lien, although most
governments will give a reward for recovery and
return.

If a civilian ship has become derelict, etc., because
of enemy action in wartime it will become a prize if
recovered by the enemy; salvage if recovered by a
non-belligerent; and what I call "quasi-salvage" if
recovered by its own side.  

If someone from the same side recovers the ship during
or conceivably after the war, they may not be entitled
to full salvage rights, or their rights may be
deferred until the end of hostilities, to the extent
that salvage rights conflict with war aims or
expedience.

> What is a munchkin?

A munchkin is the sort of gamer who thinks that roleplaying games are all
about gaining absurd amounts of power in the game world. The munchkin is a
close companion of the Monty Haul GM, who, not coincidentally, believes that
giving out power quickly, and in huge doses is the point of a roleplaying
game.

The only obnoxious female players I\'ve ever met (and both were part of the
same gaming circle) exist in a perverse symbiotic nature with obnoxious male
GMs. The situation is similar to the munchkin / Monty Haul one listed above,
but selective. In such a situation, the male GM heaps power and riches upon
his girlfriend or wife, and the female player expects this and gets surly
when things do not go her way.

Maybe; it depends.  If that the result, the law is
simply penalizing your company for letting a pirate
get control of the ship.  That\'s not necessarily a bad
result.  (Self-defense could be a legitimate means of
seizure, to use Black Ice\'s terms, so the merchant is
taking the patrol cruiser as a prize.)  

The bank\'s security interest in the ship and the loan
that it secures would be unaffected. 

It\'s more likely, however, that the merchant will be
deemed to have salvaged the patrol cruiser, and will
have a salvor\'s lien, but your company will still have
title.  That would happen in my Traveller universe,
where prizes may only be taken in wartime by
belligerents from belligerents.  Piracy is simply
criminal activity, not the making of war by a
sovereign against a sovereign, so no prizes may be
taken.

This reminds me of rhetoric that I\'ve read from 16th
and 17th Century pirates living in the Caribbean and
Madagascar.  Some considered themselves sovereign
states at war with the rest of the world, entitled to
take any ship as a prize.  That argument won\'t fly in
an Imperial Admiralty Court any better than it did in
the London admiralty court.

Worlds that seize ships without good reason will find
themselves de facto interdicted, and TAS at least will
give them a red zone classification.  Ships just won\'t
go there.  

Worlds that seize ships and don\'t provide some means
for the financing parties to get compensated will also
find themselves de facto interdicted, because the
banks won\'t lend to companies whose business plans
call for travel to that world.

The captain is not necessarily the owner, anyway -- 
it\'s usually some corporation like Al Morai or Tukera,
or even Jamison Factors -- and it doesn\'t make any
difference.  

The financing contract is between the owner and the
lender.  If the owner\'s employees (i.e., captain and
crew) become pirates, the owner still owes the lender.
 The contract probably does provide that, if the ship
is being used for the commission of a crime (and crime
may be defined quite specifically in the contract),
the borrower is in breach, the lender may declare all
payments due immediately, and take any lawful action
(including self-help) to repossess the ship.

Yep, I\'ve also met several.  These days at least 20% of gamers are female,
and they are often just as good or bad as male gamers. You\'ll find
considerably more women playing WW World of Darkness games than SF games
like Traveller, but that is also true for male gamers. 

On the larger point, in the early-mid 90s RPG were declining. This is no
longer true.  I make my living as a RPG freelance writer and these days
business is booming.  For the last two years RPG sales have been way up,
espeically wihin this last year.  With the upcoming release of 3rd edition
D&D and the big Hasbro marketing push which will accomany it, I think this
boom will continue and expand.

Reminds me of a crew of "adventurers" in Bruce Sterling\'s _Schismatrix_.
They were once an independent country, based on a large asteroid.
After several large misfortunes, the territory held by their country was 
reduced to a single interplanetary vessel, with a Big Gun. Now, piracy
was illegal, but declaring war was not...so they\'d come up to another
ship or asteroid installation, declare war, annex the territory and
levy taxes. Their legal procedure was quite detailed, but of course 
could only be used because they had a Big Gun on their ship.

I hadn\'t thought of having any of my Traveller "ethically challenged
merchants" do this. It makes for interesting color. "We welcome the
new citizens of the Republic of SunBeard, and are pleased that you
are so forthcoming in your financial support for your new government..."

I think the confusing part was when civilian ships were

exist. I think it was pretty clear that if you\'re at war
with the Senlis Foederate, and one of their DE\'s captures

You might, however, get it back with a treaty.

The property _probably_ reverts to the legal owner. However, if you had the 
chance to report the property stolen but didn\'t, the government may think 
that you lent the property and are now trying to keep yourself out of 
trouble. However, any damages to your property would probably be the legal 
responsibility of the thief, not anyone who legally defends themselves from 
actions taken by said thief (which means you better have good insurance).

I\'m speaking only from hear say but here goes...

Acording to what I understand about maritime law a ship can be claimed as
salvage if not in the possesion of \'some persons\' for a given period of
time.  After that time it is considered abandoned and is fair game to be
claimed by anyone.  Possesion is the tricky part.  If it is part on land
belonging to the ships owner it is in his possesion.  If on the land of a
third party the third party has claim to it after the time has expired.  If
on the high seas (space) or under them it\'s up for grabs BUT the first
person there can claim it for a curtain period of time without actually
moving it.

All of this can get real sticky if the salvage is in someones territorial
waters and wants to make an issue of it but if the finders get it out of
there fast enough most other countries will honor their claims.  Just don\'t
ever plan to return to that country!

Take this with a grain of salt though.  It\'s from a half remembered book on
treasure hunters trying to claim sunken treasure.  Many of them lost most or
all of the goods to the local government including our US of A and the IR of
S. (Grin)

The cover of the book, at least in the printing I have, is excellent as
well. There\'s a typical nuclear family, mother, father, toddler boy and
young girl who are all watching television without the benefit of heads.

It turns out that I was missing the mark in that portion of Postman\'s
argument as well. I looked over the chapter earlier... not that I missed the
mark in general, but that I missed the mark on the precedent issue.

It\'s possible, but somewhat dubious, as proverbs usually have their origins
in "everyday" sorts of experiences. I would think that it would be difficult
for prior judgements to take the form of proverbs.

Well, no, while they may not have an effect on the law itself, one could say
they have had an impact on law in general. After all, if in any one of those
cases a legal decision was "set up" in order to attain a specific result, no
matter what the goal, then the practice of law *has* changed.

What I\'m leaning toward, at least in theory, is that for the nobles in the
Imperium, discussions are written and sent back and forth. While it may be
acceptable to send a holovid as a Holiday greeting, it is a breech of
etiquette to send a holovid discussing anything of importance.

In this sense, entering into the ranks of the nobility means more than just
the right to add a prefix or suffix to one\'s name. It is a very direct
invitation to be part of learned debate in the Imperium.

I\'m even considering the use of a noble language, sort of like Latin in the
medieval period, but more like the French language during the Enlightenment.
Your own mileage may vary, of course, since I\'m diverging from standard
canon for my own Traveller universe.

The name wasn\'t supposed to be taken seriously. Just what I managed to come

I tried doing this for GT a while back, with some drastic simplifying
assumptions:

1) No energy lost on re-entry.

2) No energy _except_ gravitational potential energy. (Ie. just the energy
from dropping the rock, nothing added for orbital velocity, rotation of
location on planet, etc.)

I\'m not at all convinced I\'m right in these assumptions. (OK, I know they
are off, but I don\'t know if it\'s a significant inaccuracy or not.  The
most useful thing about this post (I think) is the formula for computing
damage, based on altitude and world information.

Leonard, feel free to improve the formula. I know you can do it :-)


============================

I\'ve been playing around with deadfall ordinance. I started out with the
assumption that DO is essentially a mass driver (electromag gun) that spits
out shells from orbit. I may be totally off base here, but figured that at
least I\'d start the ball rolling.

Quoting from Striker II (p.36):

"Bombs and missiles dropped from orbit are actually fired at the planetary
surface with a respectable initial velocity (in the order of 800 to 1200
km/h), but still take time to reach the planetary surface from high orbit."
[The actual delay is size code x 5 minutes.]

I designed a series of very short electromag guns (which seem to have the
right muzzle velocity, assuming that the KE damage from missiles and the KE
damage from shells is equivalent). I put the gun(s) in a bay, along with
two roomy crewstations and a power plant slice, and filled teh rest of the
bay with ammo. Here\'s what I got for a 250mm gun. (Note: I used tabs, so
you may have to play a bit with the formatting.)

250mm	EMass	LMass	Volume	Cost	Magazine
GTL9 (1 gun battery)	239	1,620	100	94.71	5531 rounds
GTL10 (4 gun battery)	200	2,019	100	21.33	6891 rounds
GTL11 (4 gun battery)	200	2,019	100	11.96	6891 rounds


The rounds themselves are, other than the solid shot, quite expensive. Cost
would be only 1/4 if these were regular rounds, not electromag. At GTL9 the
power plant slice is so large I can see the ships using conventional
cannons (just like in "Space Viking"!).

KE multiplier should be inserted into the following equation to determine
actual KE damage dice:

KE = KE Multiplier x Sqrt(ghR/(h+R))

where: g = gravity (Earth=1), h = altitude (miles), and R = planetary
radius (miles).

This models the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy, then uses
that velocity with the missile KE damage equation to get GURPS damage dice.
This approach ignores frictional braking (which would depend on atmosphere
anyway), but is probably a valid first approximation.

The basic load for an Imperial Army infantryman comes in at about 40lbs.
The basic weapon (4mm Gauss Rifle) has fairly heavy ammo, and they were
Combat Enviroment Suits.

We practice hunting and warfare since we\'re children
and always have.  So far as I know, that\'s true across
all cultures.  I don\'t see the harm.  Not recognizing
the difference between play/practice and the real
thing is harmful.

Interesting. One of my University acquaintances met a young lady from

This also illustrates a problem with retailers, especially in the UK. 
It is common for them not to have the rule books in stock. This means 
that although potential customers may have a look at the new 
sourcebooks, they may not buy as there is no system to support them. 
To use an analogy, you can\'t run the software without the OS....

Well, yes, a paintball gun *is* clearly different from a real gun, no two
ways about it. I\'ve seen some at least one response in this thread, which
tries to answer your question by posing the same question to fencing.

I\'m not going to take that route myself. The "answer", as it were, is very
simple:

It goes without saying that the end result of being shot with each type of
gun is quite different. Shooting someone, who is properly attired and
expecting the possibility that they might be splattered with paint, with a
paintball pellet poses no *real* moral dilemma. I\'m not trying to trivialize
your concerns, but the two are very different. Shooting somebody with a
bullet is hazardous to life and limb, while shooting somebody with a
paintball pellet is not really all that dangerous.

Back in digest 1440, Antony pointed out how the Australian Tax Commisioner is
able to ignore reality. I thought this was just a joke, so I looked up the
legislation (actually only a Bill, as it hasn\'t yet been passed).

The wording is verbatim, but the *context* was missing. Here it is:
==================
165-1 What this Division is about

This Division is to deter schemes to give entities benefits by reducing GST,
increasing refunds or altering the timing of payment of GST or refunds.

If the dominant purpose or a principal effect of a scheme is to give an entity
such a benefit, the Commissioner may negate the benefit an entity gets from the
scheme by declaring how much GST or refund would have been payable, and when it
would have been payable, apart from the scheme.

[snip]

165-55 Commissioner may disregard scheme in making declarations

For the purposes of making a declaration under this Subdivision, the
Commissioner may:

(a) treat a particular event that actually happened as not having happened;
and...
==================
etc etc [ie. declare the nature of the universe to be altered]

So he *can* change the gravitational constant of the universe, but only in
certain specific cases...  ;-)

IME, it\'s applied to those whose motto tends to be "I can do more

for their characters. They also tends to do 3 hour analyses of their GURPS
or Hero system characters looking for the ultimate point saving ballance.

I\'ve encountered but a very few of those... The "non-gaming SO" thrust into
the gaming role is much different from the munchkin... most of the ones
I\'ve met have been women, and they don\'t quite understand the rules, don\'t
really care, but will play if nursemaided enough; good stories will draw
them in. Let them play the wiscracking noble, or the party healer, or some
other supporting character who\'s likely to be protected, important, and not
a combat monster, and most of them will slowly start to roleplay. IME, it
takes about a year to get such a NGSO to become at least a part time gamer.

Coax them gently, and they tend to come around. The stubbornest I\'ve met,
however, was a man who was the non-gamer to his avid-gamer wife. He became
a rules lawyer from HELL. So bad, in fact, that no one wants to game with
him. And he\'ll only play AD&D 2nd, and only FR or DL settings, and won\'t
tolerate even the minorest of house rules, deviations from print, or
interpretations which conflict with his (unless backed up in Dragon).

Ob Trav, I find Traveller to be a wonderful means of training
roleplaying... the CT setting allows for much non-combat-oriented
adventuring. Lots of Noblesse Amour and intrigue will get most of the
romance reading gaming widows interested.

Here\'s something posted by Bruce from over two years ago:

I went to the alleged source, rec.games.frp.misc. and the consensus seems
to be that the term arose from the fact that the characters that most
seemed to display this behavior were the 10-13 year olds at the cons, and
the colloquial term \'munckin\' used to refer to little kids came to mean
these players and their 300th level paladins. Dates of origin seem to be
the late 70\'s.

But, by far the best answer comes from one Mark Campbell:

>Where did the RPG definition of Munchkin come from?

Munchkins, in their roles as protectors of the Yellow Brick Road, by
necessity develop a large number of useful skills. In fact, the
relentless training ritual of singing, dancing and skipping force the
small folk to develop perfect coordination and the best possible
cardi-vascular system. Consequently, all Munchkins have Dexterity and
Constitution ratings of 18.

The constant work the Munchkins do in picking flowers and replacing
yellow bricks that have faded to faint pastels also does its work to
chisel the muscles of these hardy folk. Lifting sometimes as many as two
or three bricks at a time, all Munchkins have a Strength score of 18.
Those who occasionally work out even further by practicing sword
fighting with dandylion stems actually exceed this score, and these
Munchkins have a Strength score of 18/00.

Munchkin life is not entirely a physical endeavor, however. There is, of
course, the Wizard to deal with. Being in such proximity to Oz--not to
mention all those Wicked Witches--requires sound judgement and a sharp
mind. Merely in order to survive such a lethal magical environment
requires all Munchkins above the age of four to have an Intelligence and
Wisdom of 18 each.

With their firm, chiseled bodies, the grace that comes from a lifetime
of dancing, a keen wit and impeccable judgment, Munchkins cannot help
but to be the envy of all other races. Still, their courage and senses
of humor make the Munchkins the most lovable race in the multiverse.
Therefore, all Munchkins have a Charisma (and Comliness, if this
optional rule is used) score of 18.

Munchkins as a race are, of course, the most highly developed beings
ever produced by the gods--in fact, each and every member of the race
borders on the divine itself. Their incredible aptitude in all areas
mean that they automatically gain every non-weapon proficiency the first
time they attempt a task. In fact, they never suffer a non-proficiency
penalty whether using a weapon or attempting a new skill for which they
previously had no proficiency slot.

Naturally, such a capable race cannot be held back to only one character
class. All Munchkins are Warrior/Priest/Wizard/Rogues, but use the Rogue
table to advance in levels for all classes. Lawful Good Munchkins are
usually Paladin/Specialty Priest/Evoker/Bards, while other Good Munkins
may be Ranger/Druid/Necromancer/Thiefs -- or anything else they want!

Because of the powerful aura which Munchkins posess, any being opposing
one automatically functions as if they are subject to a Protection from
[Good/Evil/Whatever] 10\' Radius spell. All attacks against Munchkins are
made at -2 to hit and damage, spells do -1 hit point per die, and
Munchkins are immune to any spells from the Illusion school.

In any adventuring party, the Munchkin will naturally be the party
leader, despite his small stature. In order to make up for this handicap
(being short), the Munchkin always gets first choice of any treasure
(particularly magic items) found by the party.

Munchkins are distantly related to dwarves, humans and oompa-loompas,
but of course they are far superior to any of these races.

IMTU, it all depends.

See, if you find a ship with no living sophonts, and tow it in, you can
claim it as a salvaged hull. You must re-register the vessel at your own
expense. you must establish the claim before the local admirality court.

If you defeat a ship which attacked you, and take it,you MAY get to claim
it as a prize. If you hold a letter of marque which applies, you probably
will. If you hold a repossession authorization for it, you definitely get
to claim it as a prize on behalf of the issuing title/lien holder.

If you attacked first, you may not claim it as prize unless you hold a repo
auth or a letter of marque; in either case, you must also have notified
them of your desire for their surrender BEFORE firing.

If you take a ship wich you did not fight, and it was operational but
unooccupied, the owners get 1 year to claim it, they you may ask for it to
be awarded to you.

If you assist a vessel in need and it turns out to still have any living
sophonts with valid legal claim to it, you may only secure a lien against
it for the cost of the rescue efforts, including standard charter rates.

All such claims go to the local admirality court, comprised of the local
noble or his representative subordinate noble, the planetary Navy\'s AiC or
his assigned subordinate, and an assigned jag officer from the IN, and if
they exists, the sector navy and subsecotr navy, plus one rep from the
IISS.

They review your claim, verify from all available records that you did not
deny or refuse succor, demand title from surviving owners aboard, violate
imperial laws of space traffic, or misrepresent your role or claim.

In the case of a vessel which has been stolen, but was taken as legitamate
prize, the 3 month probate on vessels IMTU applies; The lien holders or
owners may reclaim the ship within three months of it\'s recovery, assuming
the theft was within one year prior to recovery. If they do, they must pay
fair salvage value (10% of fair market value at time of theft) plus costs
(Charter fees plus food, fuel and ammo expenses) as a finder\'s fee. And the
theft report to the local admirality at point of discovery of the theft
must accompany such claims.

Also, onne may not strip a prize or salvage until the ship clears probate,
except to save lives.

This leads to the multiple roles of Pirates IMTU...  including skip
tracing, capturing stolen vessels, serving as starmercs (both defensive and
offensive), searching outsystems for salvage hulls, and when need be,
serving as legitamate merchants. IMTU, it is a valid career, more properly
known as a Corsair... but when times get too hard, and opportunity strikes,
well some will turn pirate. Definitely not a "Gentleman\'s Career", but also
not for the romantic swashbuckler, either. Hard-bitten, frequently dour and
grim, the average corsair officer is one part buisinessman, one part grim
optomist, and one part adrenaline junkie. Many go legit when the need for
adrenaline (or the ability to continue on the sporadic crew-shares) wanes.

This is a weaker assumption - almost all trajectories will retain a lot of its

To rephrase, in hopes of aiding clarity:

It\'s all relative, y\'see.  Too many people, seeing something that\'s NOT AS
stupid as the rest of what\'s on television, accept that as their standard
of "intelligent."  If one believes that television is not the best medium
for presenting educational or informative/news content, to do so anyway
reduces the level of discourse to what it *is* capable of (i.e.,
commercials and sound bites).

TV presents the *illusion* of real quality.  Much like the modern electoral
college presents the *illusion* of real choice.  (Oops, veering into
another rant.)

>I will continue to maintain that there *are* inappropriate responses to

>I don\'t even want to begin to speculate on what the impact of these
>technologies are on a broader level.

Earlier this year, I read an article in _Smithsonian_ magazine (there, I\'ve
defined my source, so caveat reader) on the Amish.  Like many people, I had
believed that their society had a simple blanket prohibition against all
technology invented after, say, 1900.  The truth is both more complex and
more interesting.

From memory:  any given technology is judged, and the decision made to
adopt it or not (and if so, in what form), based on criteria like:  will
this make a task *too* easy, devaluing the work and making the user lazy?
Will it result in an intrusion on one\'s privacy?  Will it damage the
cohesion of the family, or the community?

As an example, many Amish communities have a telephone shack, much like an
outhouse.  Thus, one goes to the shack with the specific purpose of making
or receiving a telephone call.  The shack has no heat and few concessions
to comfort, so one is not tempted to just sit there on the phone and
chatter about nothing.  And unwanted callers cannot metaphorically break
down your door and invite themselves in to sell you something, even during
dinner or prayer, as is the case for most of us with phones inside our
houses.  Having been woken up this morning by a telemarketer for MCI, I
must admit I see the appeal...

To bring this back on topic:  clearly, the Amish and other deliberately
"backward" societies believe that there ARE negative consequences to
blindly embracing every new gadget to come down the pike.  I suspect that
this debate will become more and more important in every society as
technology becomes more pervasive.  As cell-phones, telecommuting, on-line
shopping, etc continue to erode the boundaries of our daily activities,
concepts like "family time" and "vacation" are on the endangered-species
list.  We all have to draw the line somewhere.

IMTU, it varies from polity to polity, but in general the salvage
crew has *a* claim, but not necessarily the only or best claim to
the ship.  If the ship has an outstanding mortgage then the mortgage
holder (usually a bank) also has a claim.  If the ship is insured
and the insurance has paid off the mortgage and/or heirs then the
insurance company has a claim.  If the insurance has been paid off
and the insurance company has written the policy off their taxes,
then the ship belongs to the taxing government.  The case will wind
up in court, variously called Salvage Court, Claims Court, or
Maritime and Space Court.

In almost every case the PC\'s are going to end up with a percentage
of the ship\'s worth and not the ship itself.  The PC\'s aren\'t going
to get to keep the ship.  The only time the salvagers will get the
ship is when it isn\'t considered to be worth much.

This is during peacetime.

During war, if a ship is captured by a licensed privateer *and* that
side isn\'t soundly defeated <G> then the ship will be retitled and
retained by those that captured it.  In some cases this will be the
government that licensed the privateer, but in others it will be the
private parties themselves.  IMTU, that\'s the big reason someone
would want a Letter of Marque, the possibility of grabbing a few
ships.

In my PBEM, the Mae Lee started life as a merchant ship belonging to
a Zeristu megacorp.  It was captured by Akus Moby while he had a
Letter of Marque during the First Zeristu war, refitted and turned
into an exploratory trader.  The Zeristu corp have been trying
legally (and otherwise) to get their ship back for 30 plus years.
As long as it stays out of Zeristu space the odds are very slim they
will succeed...legally.  Of course, if they could get that ship back
into a Zeristu port then the weight of the law might shift. <g>

Is this a rhetorical question, or a serious request for a definition?

From the TML FAQ:

"Munchkin - Derogatory term referring to RPG players who is interested in
minimising their disadavantages, maximising their advantages and having the
coolest weapons and equipment. Role playing skills are not to the forefront
here."

>I\'ve known a very few obnoxious female gamers, but they were all obnoxious

This is not the case with the woman in question. She *loves* playing the
games. But her style of play and the way she creates characters is pretty
much consistent with the above definition. She also suffers from the 
complete and total inability to separate her characters from her own self.
So for example if someone, in character, says something to her (character)
that she (herself) doesn\'t like, she\'ll take it personally.

>They weren\'t really gamers at all and they drove me nuts
>because they tended to assume the same of me, except when I RAN the games.

I\'ve known several female gamers who actually liked the game. The one or two
I knew who were there just because their partners had "dragged them along"
and didn\'t want to be there -- what usually happened was that eventually
they and their male, game-loving, partners would disappear from the game.

This does not appear to have happened in Canada... I get the impression
that candidates down on your side of the border have to show what good
moral character thay have, by showing that they are stable family men.
Someone who is single, or divorced without being remarried, doesn\'t stand
a chance in many venues. Up here, we don\'t care. Our second-longest-serving
Prime Minister was a skirt-chasing bachelor when we first elected him, 
got married while in office, got *divorced* while in office, and we still
kept electing him. (Pierre Trudeau.)

Perhaps. As I don\'t understand US politics, I don\'t feel qualified to

Your example, however informative, was also completely irrelevant to
my point. By "appropriately", I did not mean to imply appropriate with
the respect to good manners in public. I go to movies a lot, and I have
never experienced the kinds of things you wrote about. Then again, 
Canadians *do* have a reputation for being more polite...

But my point was that the younger set aren\'t freaked out by advances
in technology. I manage an online bookstore -- I have (generally older)
people phoning me to place their order over the phone because they are
leery about doing so via the Web, despite the fact that with our system,
ordering online is *safer* because their credit card number is never seen
by human eyes (except their own) during the transaction -- not even we at
the store see it. Ever. I have relatives in their 50s and 60s who refuse
to learn how to use an ATM to do their banking -- my mother freely uses
one to withdraw cash, but will never, ever make a deposit that way.

On the other hand, the younger set, and the technophiles among those of
us over 30, have no problem following the latest advances, and even
anticipating them, and embrace them when they do get there.

In fact, the casual use of cell phones and laser pointers you mention
only proves *my* point, that they embrace it so well that it becomes
casual to them. The problem isn\'t the technology, it\'s just plain poor
manners.

That\'s just the touchy-feely, left-leaning, politically-correct media

and animation and high-tech stuff, immediately conclude that I\'m also
an Anime fan. Nope.)

I often wondered that myself. And her also being (formerly) one of the
high-ups in the Canadian arm of CAR-PGa, the pro-RPG advocacy group.
(Formerly, since when she moved out of Canada to the US she had to drop
her position within the Canadian arm of the organization, of course.)

Ah!  I do know an obnoxious female gamer that was never a drag-along then!

My best friend in college was just such a person.  She had these magic dice,
she\'d roll up almost all 18\'s and stuff, and if you gave everyone points
instead, she\'d still manage to get the perfect character.  But her character
was almost always a beautiful young female and she always fell in love with
the bad guy, unless the bad guy was a totally stupid, ugly brute, and then
she\'d make life hell for the other PC\'s if they tried to do in the bad guy.
Ugh!  She was my best friend and I couldn\'t throw her out of the games, but
she drove me NUTS!!!

She\'s the sort of person who would be sure that she could find the embers of
Anakin smouldering away inside of Darth\'s black armor.  And she\'d get the
whole party killed trying!  Oh, and she quit a few games in anger because
she didn\'t get her man...

Kiri ::shudders:: at all the dark memories.

She also got mad at me when she read my novel because the characters don\'t
all get complete justice and don\'t end up neatly paired off at the end.

>>They weren\'t really gamers at all and they drove me nuts because they
tended to assume the same of me, except when I RAN the games.
>>
>I\'ve known several female gamers who actually liked the game.
>
I\'ve known lots-- just not the women I was thinking of when I wrote about
the truly obnoxious female gamers.  The people I was thinking of were like
the girl who always came to my games and rolled up a character because her
girlfriend (yes I do mean lesbian partner) wanted her to.  She\'d roll up a
character and then she\'d either sit thru the game with earphones on
listening to ABBA and you\'d have to thunk her to get her attention in
combat-- or she\'d role play in the most ANNOYING way possible, i.e. her
character would always be a loony, a small child, or an animal and she would
do whatever she could to break things up and distract the party.

I was convinced this was her way of getting back at S, who was a very avid
gamer, for dragging her to all these games.  She also got very angry at me
because she liked Elfquest and she expected every game she played in to use
Elfquest elves-- and I didn\'t.  Don\'t.  Won\'t.  Richard Pini completely
offended me personally in the early 80\'s and I haven\'t looked at anything EQ
related since.

That usually happened.  But unfortunately, not with D-Ko (we nicknamed her
this after the bratty princess C-Ko in the anime "Project A-Ko", whom she
resembled and acted like, right down to the horrible cooking, terrible
screaming, and the being the love object of a number of women who should
have had better taste.)

   There is an interesting article in one of the Traveller Chronicle <10 by 
Andy Slack(?)  dealing with the extension of social standing from A-Z that 
way filling plenty of room for lots of noble ranks.  It is really a first 
class piece of writing.
    Plus, it would be interesting to explore the powers of the nobility more 
in a functional approach as representives of the Imperial government as 
opposed to that of a world government.  Give new life to the politics rules 
which basically talk about coalition building.  A more interventionist and 
action oriented High Nobility section would be more fun giving players a 
chance to play in the big leagues.  Thus, a solid reading of the Prince and 
Discourses would be in order.  Toghether with a thorough examination of life 
on Capital which I imagine more akin to Trantor than Washington as some 
Traveller literature seems to imply.
  So I cannot emphasize the TTC article enough...it would need some work to 
GURPize it but the intention is there.

Charles, thanks for correcting that error.  I posted the
same error twice.  If you see it again, I appologize.  My
point wasn\'t about the the decimal point, but the scales.
Let\'s face it whether you are speaking of -231 or - 269
deg. C, neither are survivable for long.

Of course, if the 0.15 is a *reduction*, then there is no
problem with scales.  Could someone post the hot pole
formula?

Yes, but _most_ people neversign up for the army, and
those that do, most never kill, either because their
job doesn\'t require it or they think they can get away
with it. As for killing in civilian life, well, most
people _don\'t_ murder one another for the hell of it,
or even when they have a pretty good reason. Add
together all the murders ever, all the people actually
killing war (whether soldiers, artillerymen, airmen,
whatever), and you still get less than 1% of the
population.

Granted, it doesn\'t take many to cause a lot of
misery, but the fact that most people never kill shows
there\'s some reluctance to do it. I don\'t mean to say
that life is a utopia of love-hippies, of course those
few, those happy few, cause lots of trouble and pain,
BUT - they\'re the minority. 

If I killed everyone who ever pissed me off, I would
either run out of friends and acquaintances, or be
killed myself. And if everybody else had a similar
lack of inhibitions, I daresay the population of my
fair city would decline fairly sharply.

That is, the killers would kill each-other off, and
we\'d run out of killers, pretty much. 

For these reasons I still contend that any
technological society will be dominated, numbers-wise,
by individuals reluctant to kill. Of course, those in
charge who don\'t have to shed the blood themselves may
lack such squeamishness...

In the earlier days of roleplaying, I would agree.  A club in Brisbane has a
couple of female rules lawyers who delight in bouncing off each other
(supporting each other that is) to make a GM\'s life hard.  I have not GM\'ed
them myself, but I left the campaign because of the disruption it often
caused.  And my daughter, not so much a rules lawyer, but a number
cruncher - "This works best with this kind of character having this level
Stats using weapons X, Y, and K, but only if you can obtain such and such
armour..."  Maybe it\'s an Aussie thing??  Maybe we have more "competent"
females gamers per capita that they act just like male gamers??

In the real world Australia, if a conman can sell a stolen vehicle to a
second hand motor dealer and they fail to determine it was stolen and it is
sold on to Walter Smith for $7999, and Walt drives the car home, and within
hours, the original owner sees it and reports it... the vehicle is seised by
the police, identification confirmed, and it is either returned to the owner
or the insurance company (if they have paid out on it)... Walt does NOT get
his $7999 back, nor any part of it.  Walt has no $7999 and no car to show
for it!  This could quite well be the way these issues on stolen vessels and
salvage claims work in the Imperium?

"Salvage" applies to abandoned vessels, and to crewed vessels in need
of assistance. Other posts have gone into salvage law extensively.

A "prize" is a vessel belonging to the enemy and taken by force of arms
by either a military vessel or a licensed privateer. The value of the
prizedetermined by selling it at auction (though it may be "bought in"
by the Navy). 

Everything below is from practices during the Naploeonic era, since
taking of prizes pretty much quit after that (and privateers became
illegal). To the best of my knowledge that last time anyone took a
prize was during WWII, when Commander Gallery and his men took a German
submarine as a prize (it\'s now on display in Chicago). They only did it
because we needed the codebooks and encryption gear.

The prize money goes 100% to a privateer operating alone. I believe
there\'s a standard formula for how the money gets divided between the
owners, officers and crew.

If a naval vessel made the capture, the admiral of the fleet gets a
cut. So do any vessels in sight at the time of the capture (it is
assumed their presence aided in the capture).

Again, there\'s a formula as to how the captain, officers and crew get
shares of the money. I think the British used something like 1/4th to
the captain, another 1/4th split among the officers, and another 1/4th
split among the crew. The remaining 1/4th was what the admiral and
"supporting ships" got. 

*Don\'t* use my figures. Look them up. Especially since there may be
versions that include adjusting shares according to rank and seniority.

The insurance company will pay the original owners. After all, once
word gets out that the ship has been seized by pirates, it\'s value to
the bank or to the heirs of the owner is essentially *nil*. For one
thing, getting it back intact is both unlikely and apt to take a *long*
time. 

The insurance company might have a claim against the ship. But
government policy could easily be that the insurance company gets to
"write off" the loss (a tax break) and the people who captured the
vessels back from the pirates get to keep it.

This costs the government little, doesn\'t really hurt the insurance
company (and also encourages people to *have* insurance!) and gives
folks another reason to fight back against pirates, in that if they
win, they get the value of whatever the pirates had.

Nope. Check the way customs laws work. The smuggling vessel is
*forfeit* if the "owners" were involved. Period. 

If the owners weren\'t involved, then the ship *usually* isn\'t seized.
But it\'s up to the government whose laws wewre violated.

Life isn\'t fair. If a government "nationalizes" the factories a company
built, the company is pretty much out of luck. Which is why banks are
kinda picky about *where* you are building when they go to loan you
money. 

Of course this backfires. Some banks went ahead and loaned money to
buld factories in country X, reasoning that since they\'d made large
loans to the government of X, they could use that as pressure.
Sometimes it just meant the country was *more* willing to write off the
loans, since nationalizing the factories got the bank mad at them
anyway. 

If the bank has the clout to get the country (planet) boycotted, then
the government will sometimes relent and pay the bank back. If the bank
can\'t bring enough pressure to bear, too bad.

And if they seize the ship, the bank is SOL. 

That\'s life. 

*Most* of the time countries don\'t want to get banks and big companies
upset at them. But not always.

This is one of those oft argumented questions with child psychologists.
I\'ll state now I am not qualified and for Chris, I can\'t provide links,
bibliographies, etc., but my wife has studied in her childcare work for the
last several years (always continuing with it!), has brought to light many
facets of "human nature."

One set of studies revolved about various childplay control by parents over
several years.  There was no way that mum was going to let little Johnny
play with guns, swords, etc. until he was over 8-years old (her arbitrary
setting), nor could he view violent content children shows.  While he was a
toddler, he was using sticks and his sister\'s Barbie dolls as knives and
guns!  By 5, his mother caved and allowed friends to gift him toy guns
because he played cowboys and indians, cops and robbers, and soldiers, etc.
off his own back.  The resulting theory was that it is a genetic thing with
males (and certain females that are born with an abundance of male hormones)
to learn quickly and accurately, hunting and killing skills for the care and
protection of their family.

Thus, little Johnny only sees guns in commercials and on the news, yet takes
instinctively to using them (it was amusing to see him bend Barbies legs and
arms perpendicular to her body and using it as an SMG... arms and legs as
pistol- and fore-grips!).  The theory also went on to say that in medieval
times, warring was natural and men could easily stand toe to toe and hack
each other down with swords and implements, as it was a more primal urge
that was propagated by the thinking of the time.  Now days, boys are losing
out to this because the touted idea is to be more human, and with better and
widespread education, the warriors of tomorrow are learning it is natural to
"not kill"... but this is only coming at an age where it can be taught with
maturity.  In the old days, men didn\'t have a clue about "their feminine
side" let alone practicing it.

Perhaps it\'s the times in which we live, with private instincts being
"unlearned" as we grow, then relearn\'t by those in military occupations?

Well, the only thing I can advise is to read "Amusing Ourselves..." before
thinking that he\'s completely out to lunch. On the subject of television, I
agree with him wholeheartedly. I haven\'t seen anything else by him, so I
can\'t say I agree with him in his views on other forms of technology.

I do think that his point on shows like Sesame Street is dead on. What
constitutes education should not be chosen based on what is easily
televisable. This means those things which can be taught in a short segment,
which is unconnected from other short segments, and which can be distilled
down to entertainment.

After all, what happens when you get to something like, grammar, or math at
the level above 2+2=4?

The next question is, of course, who *decided* that education should be in
that format? Did they put any thought into it at all?

More importantly they have to *look good on camera*, and they (or their
speechwriters) have to write soundbites which are full of sound and fury but
say little or nothing at all.

Clinton\'s support dropped little when it was discovered that he performed
certain transgressions and lied to the public. It\'s not so much a matter of
moral character. The man who will most likely be our next president was a
(semi) admitted cocaine abuser at one time.

I don\'t think that it is irrelevant, except in the fact that my examples
were on a personal level. I admitted that, and then said I wasn\'t really
going to speculate what effects things like cellphones might have on a
population.

> But my point was that the younger set aren\'t freaked out by

The younger set, at least in America, aren\'t freaked out by guns either.
That doesn\'t mean that many of the younger set don\'t die as a result of gun
violence. That\'s not to say I want to start a gun debate, far from it. The
point is: Just because a segment isn\'t freaked out by a certain form of
technology doesn\'t mean that they are immune to the effects that technology
may have on their culture.

Just because you like to drive doesn\'t mean that you might not be involved
in an automobile accident, or be run over by a car. You are talking about
something *completely* different than what Postman talks about in "Amusing
Ourselves to Death".

>I manage an online bookstore -- I have
<snip>
>but will never, ever make a deposit that way.

Again, I would maintain that you\'re talking about something entirely
different. For Postman the question would be, "What are the effects on
culture of being able to order anything in the world from anywhere that
there\'s a computer and a phone line, without so much as talking to another
human being?", or "What kind of effects might result when people can get
their money out, day or night, without so much as talking to a person?" If
the answers seemed benign, or beneficial, I don\'t think he\'d have a problem
with it.

See a few paragraphs above. If a technology has an effect on people, it\'s
going to have that effect regardless of whether or not you\'re fond of the
technology.

Like I said, the problem isn\'t whether or not they embrace it, the problem
is how the technology will impact society, or public life. I\'m not saying
that it\'s not just poor manners, I\'m also not saying that cellphones and
laser pointers cause people to act like asses. I am saying that the
introduction of laser pointers and cellphones into my moviegoing experience
has severely impacted it.

> Any kid who tried that up here would immediately have their

Fair enough. It sounds like the Canadian government is combating the effects
of the technology. In other words, they\'ve considered the option, and set a
course of action.

That\'s not really at odds with what Postman is saying.

No, it\'s not the *message* itself that I was concerned about, but I didn\'t
make myself clear, and I sort of went off into a little rant. The fact is
you can\'t teach morality like a commercial.

Well, I was commenting on the current situation, not the primordial past! ;)

That\'s awfully odd, not that she had to give up her position, but that she
was involved in such an organization.

Heck, now that I can afford to buy stuff again, I buy GURPS
"worldbooks" in spite of the fact that I don\'t think I\'ll switch over
to GURPS any time soon. But what the worldbooks do is give me stats on
favorite worlds that I might want to "swipe" something from IN A
CONSISTENT FORMAT.

So all I need to do is write *one* GURPS -> X conversion "table", and
then I can use it with *all* the GURPS stuff. 

This beats the heck out of the old days when I had to try converting
stuff like Alien Space, Space Marines, etc, etc into the system I was
using. 

Now if I can just locate copies of some of the ones that went "out of
print" during the period I couldn\'t afford gaming stuff...

There\'s a *standard* situation where finding an intact ship wouldn\'t be
outrageous. Being able to salvage it might be a problem though. 

I refer to the standard "misjump into an empty hex" scenario.

Do a good sensor search (trying to find a "dirty snowball" you can get
unrefined fuel from) and you may find another ship. One that\'s been
there a while. :-)

It\'s *not* good news, because it means *they* didn\'t find anything. But
it doesn\'t mean the situation is hopeless. They\'ve had time to do a lot
of drifting since they died...

Personally, I\'d be more inclined to bet that the difference is that the
kids *knew* they were shooting at people who were unarmed. They didn\'t
have to worry about them *shooting back*.

And after some period of time (100 years?) even the above claims to a
lost vessel are deemed to have lapsed. The bank collects from their
insurance if any, and the insurer writes it off as a loss.

Once this period has passed, then the ship and contents belong to
whoever can bring them into port. 

I *think* the "clock" doesn\'t start until the initial salvage attempts
are *abandoned* in the case of things like wrecks in known but
"inaccessible" locations. 

It\'s unlikely that any "known location" wrecks will last that long in
Traveller. What folks are going to find that\'s free of claims is wrecks
and lost (misjumped) ships where no one knew the location. 

And salvaging even a 100 year old ship could be a job and a half. By
the time you hit thousand year old ships and installations, it\'s going
to be *really* difficult just to *salvage* them. 

And a lot of cargoes aren\'t going to be worth much after that long.

An interesting point. There\'s a fun Ben Bova book
called, "Sam Gunn, Unlimited," about a rather
entrepenurial guy called, Sam Gunn (believe it or
not). One of his money making schemes is to pick up
all the old landers and probes on the moon from the
50s and 60s, and sell them off to the Smithsonian. The
US Government says, "no! mine! miiinnnne!" but anyway
he makes a load of cash...

An excellent book, illustrating just how much the govt
will ge in the way of private enterprise if it has the
chance. "But _we\'re_ the ones that explore space,"
they\'ll say. "But you\'re not doing it," the Sam Gunns
of the world will reply. Our future?

Y\'all may be interested to know this:

I suggested to my FLGS that "SJG may be the saviour of Traveller", since it is
the only company putting out Trav in any form with worldwide distribution.

They turned around and said, "Actually, Traveller may be the saviour of SJG",
since many SJG supplements sit on the shelves for a L-O-N-G time before being
bought, while the Trav stuff barely hits the shelves before it walks out the
door. They have sold out of all the G:T stock they have ever brought in within
the first 2-3 weeks (often sooner).

;-)

Comments, Keith?

Which supplements do your distributors say are most in demand?

That\'s sort of what I meant.

There\'s a lot of this "captain\'s duty is to their ship" stuff but
I think there\'s a very twentieth century feel to this - right now
captains have lots of back up and resources available anywhere in
the world at a few hours notice.

Anyway, the mission is different - exploration with no backup for
weeks (or months in Trav)

The captain\'s first duty is not to the ship - the ship is filled
with people who can get it home - it\'s to the mission.

Control of bits of the electromagnetic spectrum is going to be critical
in near and future-tech wars (until everyone relies on meson
communicators and remote gravitic or neutrino sensing, or psionics?).

	Mesoscale sensors, relying on aperture synthesis techniques, are
deployed above (geosync orbit?) and on the battlefield.
	The battlefield based sensors have a dual role - the obvious one and
also to provide a baseline radiofrequency spectrum for descendants of
systems like LockMart\'s \'Silent Sentry\'[1].
	Another possible avenue of attack is to target the enemy\'s electronics
(is it possible to perform TEMPEST type surveillance at a range of
several hundred metres, or even further?).
	Other possibilities include orbital infrared surveillance (low depth
ground penetrating systems are currently being evaluated), and
sophisticated optical sensors to track submarines by bioluminescence
from dinoflagellates disturbed by the vehicle\'s passage ; or, using
models of oceanic circulation to detect variances in wave patterns
caused by marine traffic(!).
	Use of such advanced \'sigint\' may partly explain the enormous fire
advantages higher-TL forces enjoy over their less well-equipped
counterparts.


[1] \'Silent Sentry\' relies on aircraft flying through an airspace
through which commercial TV, etc. are being broadcast - the reflected
signals can be used to localise things. Current test runs have
successfully detected objects less than 10m2 at up to 190km, with a 3m X
8m antenna.

<more snip>

Actually Gallery only thought we needed the codebooks et al.
In point of fact the Allies had the Enigma machine and the codes
from 1940 on. Gallery knew where the U-505 was because of
These codes. Had the germans found out that we had captured
a sub they would have known Enigma was compromised and
switched to a different code system thereby impeding our ability
to intercept german subs. Thereby resulting in more merchant ship
inkings( The ULTRA intercepts(enigma transmisions decoded
by the allies) played a pivotal role in ASW in the atlantic)

Final conclusion on the boarding of the U-505:
"10 out of 10 for style ; minus several billion for good thinking."
    (Douglas Adams HHGTG)

Gallery wrote a book about his wartime experiences including the
capture of the U-505. I don\'t recall the name of it but it\'s got a few
giggles in it.

The ObTrav. Do IN intelligence officers cringe whenever a hotshot
Cruiser captain drags a prize into base? Or is the time lag between
Losing a ship and finding out you\'ve lost the ship make it unlikely
that encryption procedures can be changed quickly enough? Or
do Navies asume that ciphers will be compromised quickly anyway
and change codes on a monthly or quicker basis? Is that even possible
considering distances and travel times?

That\'s what I expected. The tax law in the UK already has rules to the effect
that if a transaction is taxable, the taxman can ignore steps inserted into
the transaction whose only purpose is to reduce tax.

In the UK, yes - but only from a dealer[*].

Which is one of the many reasons why some second hand
car dealers try to pretend they are private car sellers.

[*] Walt could get his money back from an individual by
a civil action - if they can be found and their assets
located and Walt is patient. A dealer causing the problem
gives Walt lots of official "friends" to call in.

Doesn\'t this mean that the X-boat network _seriously_ reduces the time
necessary to send information across the Imperium, since the X-boats
receive data, jump and transmit data to the next X-boat (at least
that\'s how I remember it)?

Actually, if you had enough fuel for two jumps, a j-drive that could jump X.5
might give you an advantage over competitors that could jump X.

Apparently it\'s a bit more complex than this, because, whilst there were
accepted values, they were subject to negotiation before you sailed.

Part of your contract for accepting the commisson, as it were.

I believe that the pirate crews also took the proposed split into account
when electing a captain.

Yes. One of the things that made piracy so attractive, that is, besides the
fact that the British made use of press gangs and discipline was harsh, was
that in most cases, shares were distributed pretty much equally. It was
common for a captain to get 1, 1/2, or 2 shares and everyone else to get one
share. Some, like Blackbeard, offered a wage instead.

Hey, no problem! ;)

I only cited to give people a chance to do their own research on it, and
because Glenn had stated he had no reference for the discussion in question.
Then there was the incident with the show on the History Channel, and I
honestly wanted to know what show it was! It might shed light on the debate.

Incidentally, there\'s a book called "Demonic Males", and no, the book is not
hostile, but the title might indicate that to some. It\'s a collection of a
number of studies done in the field by primate psychologists. It focuses
specifically on males in primate societies and violence. It\'s an interesting
book. I forget the name of the author, but I checked for it on Amazon.com a
few months back and they had it in their files, so it should be easy to
find.

That\'s what regular school is for. Sesame Street is intended for the toddler
and Kindergarten set, and the concepts therein are supposedly there to help
establish the foundation of the basics: the alphabet, counting to 10, that
sort of thing. It isn\'t supposed to go above that level, and when the kid is
ready to go past that, he\'s supposedly beyond the intended audience for the
show anyway.

Wow. Our provincial premier looks like a wino. I personally think he\'s

What kind of effects might result when a librarian-turned-bookseller in

discussion via the written word transmitted electronically in a forum read
by dozens of people? :)

He finds bad points about it. I can see good points about it. Like being
able to take money out of my bank account when the bank is closed because
it is more convenient for me to do so. Or someone ordering a book they need
in the middle of the night and having it on my order screen the next
morning for me to process.

Speaking of which, if I don\'t get off this keyboard I won\'t make it to work
on time, so I\'ll have to come back to this message later. :-D

I remember it (just).  I thought it was 1980 or  1981.  IIRC  the
"junkyard owner" was a successful  salvage  industry  businessman
called Harry who was not above the odd scam here and  there.  The
other characters weren\'t his sons but an ex-astronaut now working
as a used car salesman, and an attractive female scienist who had
invented a rocket super-fuel (powerful enough for their rocket to
be a multi-use SSTO but too dangerous for NASA  to  use  even  on
unmanned launches).  I think they only went to the  moon  in  the
movie-length pilot episode, thereafter their rocket was  used  on
Earth as a sort of Thunderbird 1 type thing.

My local video store has loads of re-released 70\'s  and  80\'s  TV
(not this show unfortuneately) in their  nostalgia  section.  All
with  stickers  saying  "Relive  your  wasted  youth!"  ...  very
appropriate. ;-)

<snicker>

I used to play Hero system games (mostly Champions) a lot.  I could write
down point-optimised characters straight off the top of my head, because I
knew the rules, and had done the analysis in non-play time.

The resulting characters weren\'t quite the most powerful possible, because
I had tuned them down to make them roleplayable, rather than just being
combat monsters, but they were tough enough.  Of course, they did all tend
to look a lot like each other...

Knowing the combat rules helped, as did actually having been involved in
enough (gamed) combats to have developed some tactical skill.

Of course I can\'t do that with GURPS, but given that I would most likely be
playing GT, or something strange like Atomic Horror, I doubt it would
matter that much.  The munchkins would have their Scout/Commando
battledress, and I would simply attempt to avoid being in the area when
they get themselves killed....

I\'ve got a TNE game starting after New Year, the collapse of civilisation
as we know it permitting.  I\'ve been talking Traveller to the high-school
kids who will provide most of the group over the last month.  I\'ve been
getting all kinds of flashes of "Oops!  These people actually care about
the stats of the guns they will be using", and other things I rarely pay
much attention to.  

I may just kit them out with some standard gear supplied by their patron,
and not let them select their stuff.  That way, they will get lots of
spiffy ACRs and things (maybe even combat armour, or at least combat
environment suits), but I won\'t have to worry about them stressing over the
urgency of owning a gauss pistol, or wearing battledress everytime they
walk down the street.  

Of course, they won\'t be freelance adventurers, but will be picked agents
of the Generic Star Empire, so I will have them pretty tightly on a string
anyway.  This is to make it easy for me to introduce them to the setting,
and the scenarios I\'ve set up for them, which will lead on to them having
greater freedom to make decisions once they know what kind of decisions
they will need to make.

That fits my experience too.  The first book I did for SJG (non-Traveller) is
still selling, but slowly.  _First In_ is zipping along in comparison.  The
biggest problem with the GURPS approach is that any one worldbook
probably has only a limited market.  Traveller already has a big fan base,
though.

I suspect the most accurate statement is, Mr. Miller and SJG have set
up a relationship which is very beneficial for both of them.

I am involved in one game face to face (when I am in the US

So the used car dealer gets to keep the money? Or does he get to go to

The easiest way to do it is to scrounbge up an old Apple II with a 3.5"
drive, hook the 5 1/4 drive to that, then use the Apple II as the transfer
mechanism, since (up to System 8.5 (?)) the Mac OS will read ProDOS
floppies. I saw a IIc for $5 a while back...I\'m still kicking myself for
not picking it up for this purpose.

ONce upon a long time ago, Apple made a Apple II disk adapter for the LC
series (dunno if yours is one of the 6,439 different Performa models that
was a relabelled LCI/II/III, though I thought those wer all 4xx designated
models) These adapters occasionally pop up.

There was _also_, once upon a long time ago, Apple II clone boards that
fit into a PC-XT. I know those things existed because I had one at work.
It was a tricky pain to set up, but it worked...

Synthetic aperture is not particularly useful on objects which may be moving (it is dependent on knowledge of relative velocity).  It also only gives high resolution in one dimension.  Besides which, for sensors other than radar, starship-grade phased array sensors are plenty (a 10 meter thermograph has a resolution of about 40 centimeters from 200 kilometer low orbit, which is sufficient to pick up living beings).  Note that in a major conflict, sensor platforms in low orbit won\'t last very long, particularly if they use active sensors.

Properly shielded electronics aren\'t vulnerable to Tempest.

I suspect these are highly dependent on knowledge of the exact ecosystem of the world\'s oceans.

Maybe.  They\'d be sociopaths.  Quite possibly well-disciplined sociopaths, but sociopaths.

Is this a rhetorical question, or a serious request for a definition?

From the TML FAQ:

"Munchkin - Derogatory term referring to RPG players who is interested in
minimising their disadavantages, maximising their advantages and having the
coolest weapons and equipment. Role playing skills are not to the forefront
here."
- ----

That sounds more like a powergamer to me.

To my mind a munchkin differs from a powergamer in that a powergamer works
within the framework of the applicable rule system to create the most
powerful character they can. Munchkins will ignore rules they don\'t
like/understand.

Thus munchkins end up wielding +10 "Holy Vorpal Avengers of Sharpness"
Bastard Swords in both hands, or have several disadvantages in Gurps that
add up to 150pts (or more... *shudder*) at start etc.

Munckins also tend to be young or newbies, and usually progress to being
powergamers as they \'mature\' in game experience, as that tends to suit their
style of play.

Munchkins will take a \'broken\' ship or NPC design and use it to justify
their own interpretation of reality in the game. ie will point to the
character sheet of the \'young\' Conan in the back of Gurps:Conan, as an
example of a \'realistic\' starting character for a barbarian warrior, even
though at age 16 Conan is a 217.5pt character with 119 pts of
disadvantages... eeek! (note: by the time Conan is at the height of his
power, as King of Aquilonia, he\'s a 859.5pt character with 106pts of
disadvantages....).

A powergamer will stick to the rules (eg in Gurps no more than 40 pt\'s of
disadvantages unless you have only one for more than 40pts) but will aim to
become as powerful as Conan / Strephon / Darth Vader etc during the game.

        Hi, Doug!

        You\'re 100% right, and the distinction is *lost* on civvies
sometimes...  I used to paint-ball with a few lads in the Canadian
Militia...  all us Forces types would get creamed when up against a pure
civvies team...  why?  We\'d try not to take casualties;  we had a healthy
disinterest in getting "killed".  I distinctly remember one open feilds game
where three guys took a run a me and my winger...  he had a spot-sight on
his semi-auto and I had and SMG...  I got taken out and we wiped them out...
they figured removing the "SMG guy" right away was worth the risk...

        ...We all thought they were crazy...  However, at the end of the
match, they had the flag more times than we did.  <shrug>

I remember that show.  I loved it because it was a good
blend of Old School SF (he built the Salvage One from
junk in his back yard) and New School SF (about people,
not technology).  IIRC, the engine that powered Salvage
One ran on handwavium and the father was played by
Andy Griffith (the same guy who played Sherrif Taylor on
_Mayberry RFD_ and the title role in _Ben Matlock_).

Mine does... all of the above, including separate sections for Tribe 8,

Fading Suns is also there.

From my view-point, as a player/GM/collector in one of the strong bastions
of "Roleplaying Is Life" cities (Anchorage AK tends to NEED such
diversions).... About 1/3rd of the players have been LOST to CCG\'s. ABout
1/6 have been lost to Computer Games... (I just can\'t bring myself to call
it Roleplaying). The average age of people doing roleplaying is climbing
here. When I was a kid, the average was about 18; now the average age is
about 25,with more andd more over 40\'s, and somewhat fewer under 20\'s...
This is purely guestimation based upon local conventions, tournaments, etc.

I do know that many of the wargame companies that had one or two
"roleplaying products" (TFG, as case in point, AH for another) have dropped
off the face of the planet, at least as far as name recognition goes. AH
had RuneQuest 3rd, and TFtFV; TFG had Prime Directive, Crime Fighter, and
Delta Force RPGs. AH, as we all know, was bought by hasbro. TFG lost their
cash cow, ADB\'s Star Fleet Battles, and along with it went PD.

WOTC spent a lot of money consolidating the market. They found good ideas,
bought them. Ars Magica. Talislanta. TSR.

Almost everybody now plays one of the following, at least part time: D&D,
Palladium Games, GURPS, Hero, WW-Storyteller. Idicators of a market
correction. The market was getting too broad, and the die-off is a sign
that the industry is HEALTHY, since the companies that  died made room for
better ones, like DP9.

 Linking Trav to one of the Survivors of the industry die-off insures it
will survive. Much as *I* may think GURPS mechanics are Dated, annoying,
and counter intuitive, it has the 3rd largest representation in stores of
any line of RPG materials I\'ve seen; GT therefore is a guarantee of
Traveller surviving in some form for a long while.

Hmmm. Last friday, I wrapped a 6 month campaign, with weekly sessions of ~5
hours. The group (with only minor changes) had been running without more
than two weeks off at a shot, since about August 96, although we\'ve
switched systems every 3-6mo. I\'ll start up a new group around 2nd week of
January.

I\'d be willing to lay odds that the simple majority of the people on the
list haven\'t been involved with playing TRAVELLER in the past 6 months.
Then again, neither have I.

It also totally changes the feel of the setting (I\'ve tried it). I\'d
suggest avoiding it... but it is wonderfully written. It also is not
supportive of existing canon. Great for Heresy, though.

        Well, since I am playing a Captain in Derek Stanley\'s PBIRC TNE
_Nightrim_ game, I can comment.  I started out at the beginning of our
"Ghost Ship" adventure *trying* to be the "Captain Responsible" and sending
paw-picked Away Teams to investigate.  However, as both a player and
Vargr-character, this *sucked*.  So, after everyone else got a crack at
being hero, I insisted on going for a look-see myself....  
        The first Away Team was entirely based on who I could afford to
loose, and each subsequent mission to the derilict was composed of more
"important" people.  Its a good balance, particularly given the Vargr
penchant for leading one\'s pack from the spearhead.

        Just my Cr0.02.

Thanks for the stuff on salvage - as it turned out most of the PCs died, the rest blew the drive on the ship concerned and ran away....funny how these things turn out, eh?

..and so I want to pick your brains again - the great thing about this mailing list is that people seem to base their comments on experience (probably because posters who talk garbage will have the fact pointed out to them in excruciating detail.  With footnotes.  And possibly diagrams).  There also seem to be quite a few military or ex-military types, so you guys are the chaps I\\\'m after here.

I\\\'m kicking off a new campaign for a bunch of experienced gamers, but utter Traveller virgins (I\\\'m just lucky I guess...) and given the choice they decided to go for a military campaign so I\\\'m going to put them in an Imperial Marine squad during 5FW. 

SO on to my question....how much autonomy would an individual squad have?  Would a briefing go, \\"here\\\'s your objective, here\\\'s what we know
about it, go do it....) or would it be \\"on arrival here, split into 2 squads and.....?\\"   Would the NCO have plenty of leeway in tactical decisions, or would orders be very specific?

How did it work in the units you guys are/were in?

Thanks in advance,

iSteve.

	I suppose that, in that sense, all organisms have an \'anti-

	organisms do not typically attack everything in their
	environment (cats, trees, rocks, the air, the sun, etc.).
	Even the most ferocious critters (with, perhaps, the
	exception of rabid animals) restrain themselves unless they
	sense a prey/food/competitor/predator (ie. a \'trigger\').

	One might have to keep such troops in low berths until

I think it\'s Winston Churchill, to the effect of "the
English and Americans are one people divided by a
common language."  

Bob Hope, doing a gig on Diego Garcia in the 1960s,
commented that the British and American forces seemed
to get along very well despite the language barrier.

It would appear that the IMDB agrees with you. Salvage was a TV movie which
was a pilot for a show called Salvage 1. The internet movie database says
that there were 20 episodes.

In addition, there is a fan site at:

http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Launchpad/9782/salvage1.html

There is information there on the Salvage 1 mailing list, a rendered
Vulture, sound clips, pictures, an episode guide, and all the things that
one would expect from a fan site. It would seem that most of the series was
set on earth, and the capsule descriptions from the episode guide are
bizarre. I liked the following best:

"On their first authorized salvage job - an aerial survey of Antarctic
icebergs - Harry, Melanie and Skip make an unauthorized stop on a supposedly
uninhabited island to pick up valuable spider monkeys for a zoo. What they
find instead is a lone scientist and a giant man-ape."

>Can Walt recover his money from the dealer who

Sure, at least if the deal took place in the United
States.  Here, under the Uniform Commercial Code, the
seller of goods gives an implied warranty of title. 
That is, unless seller specifically discloses that
seller does not have or does not know if he has title
to the item, he is deemed to be promising that he does
have title. 

When it turns out that the car was stolen from some
third party, it becomes clear that the seller never
acquired title, so could never pass title to Walt.  So
the true owner gets his car back from Walt.  

Walt now has remedies against the seller.  He can sue
for damages for breach of contract, arguing that the
seller failed to perform on his promise to deliver
ownership as well as mere possession of the car.  In
the alternative, he can sue for rescission, an
equitable remedy that puts the parties back where they
were as if the contract had never been made; the
argument there is that the consideration for the
contract -- ownership of the car -- failed.  

In this case, there is no practical difference between
the two remedies.  Walt\'s damages for breach are the
purchase price.  Walt\'s remedy in rescission is to get
restitution of the purchase price.

That\'s game-playing versus simulation.  The military
people are simulating a battle, and the civilians are
playing a game.  Winning a battle is very different
than winning a game; you can say that they have
different victory conditions.  

For example, you win the game by getting possession of
the other side\'s flag more often than the other side
gets possession of yours.  You win a battle by (1)
achieving your tactical objective of getting
possession of the other side\'s flag, and (2) taking
few enough casualties that your side didn\'t break and
run and is not tactically compromised by lack of
manpower, and (3) not having so many of your side run
away that you\'re not tactically compromised.

My response boils down to, YMMV.  Remember that different games sell better 
or worse in different locations.  In the Bay Area, where I live, the sales 
of GURPS is definitely below average.  On the other hand, I have had a lot 
conversations with retailers across the country and quite a few of them 
said that GURPS is one of their most reliable and constant sellers.

The bottom line is this: ignoring the local scope and in the terms of raw 
sales, GURPS is usually in the top four systems when it comes to game 
products sold (next to AD&D, Vampire and Palladium).  GURPS has always been 
fluctuating around in the top ten, but in the last few years it has been 
solidly in the top five.  The "consistant three" (AD&D, Vampire, 
Palladium), even though they regularly change position between who sold 
more products, were almost always selling on the top three.  This year has 
seen GURPS take the #3 position and bump Palladium to #4.

My personal belief as to why GURPS is claiming more of the market is 
because the layout quality of the books have increased dramatically 
(without a reduction of the quality of the text) and the addition of 
Traveller *as a line* (rather than a conversion book) to the lineup.  Not 
only does GURPS Traveller pull in the "old school" CT diehards, but more 
importantly it gives a constant stream of products around a central 
setting.  Like I said before, selling a steady stream supplements is what 
helps pay the bills.  SJ Games had climbed up to the top five selling RPG 
lines without an officially supported game setting.  With the addition of 
the Traveller line, and potentially additional Technomancer books, I have 
no doubts that GURPS will stay in the top three position for a long time.


>Which supplements do your distributors say are most in demand?

Magic, Psionics, and the Tech books are big and consistent sellers.  We 
have also had tremendous success with books like Technomancer, Black Ops, 
and of course, Traveller.  Keep in mind that I don\'t really deal with 
distributors or pay that much attention to sales.  Our sales people could 
answer that question much better than a webmonkey like myself.  :)

I\'ve never been in the military, but I\'ve read some
good books, and if you want to read a good book about
a squad with a lot of autonomy, read Norman Mailer\'s
The Naked and the Dead, which is a
semi-autobiographical account of his experiences in a
recon squad in the Pacific during World War II.

[Delurk, click!]

    With the rise of reliable battlefield communications there is less and
less squad autonomy. Commanders can sit in orbit and watch close to real
time events unfold on their myriad displays and issue orders as needed (I\'m
assuming orbital superiority but similiar systems can be emplaced.) Also, it
costs a lot to send a unit out with its advanced equipment and warbot grunts
and the lethality of the individual soldier has gone through the roof. One
trooper may well have the firepower of an earlier tech levels squad so less
troops may in fact be sent. This gives the CO less troops to oversee and
intensifies his control. These are just a few factors among many but I
thought I\'d mention them.

I think this is called "growing the market". In some game stores, where
local GURPS interest is modest,
Traveller will pick up an additional market segment. (Our local game store
is an example). In others,
it will add to the existing GURPS market.

For me, GURPS Trav Aliens I is selling fairly decently -- better than
obscure worldbook stuff I did, like Reign of Steel, but not as good as the
semi-core generic tech books, like Bio-Tech or Robots.

_First In_ is not a worldbook, of course -- it\'s a sourcebook, and one with
a broad appeal far beyond Traveller, so it should do very well. I\'ve been
recommending it to my non-Trav sf gaming friends.

Consider yourself lucky that you are near a good store.  I am sure that 
plenty of other DP9 fans are jealous of you.

WotC killed most of the their RPG lines a couple years ago.  Everway, Ars

Games picked up Ars Magica and Pharos Press has the Talislanta license.

I would remove Hero from that list.  Champions was very popular in the

I have to agree, DP9 is a great company.  Pity only two game stores that I 
know of carries more than the basic books for it.

Also, get ready for D&D3.  Each book will be priced very low, with the 
intent to destroy smaller companies that can\'t afford to compete with the 
price of the new version of D&D.  When you average gamer sees Seven Seas 
for $30, and D&D3 to ~$20, talk a wild guess what is going to be bought on 
average.

I disagree with your comment on the mechanics of GURPS, but everything else 
I am in complete agreement with.

Not really. Some plankton analogues may fluoresce at specific
wavelengths when stimulated, just as Terran dinoflagellates do (observed
by poets, etc. writing about dolphins and the \'trails\' they made in the
water a *long* time ago e.g. the ancient Greeks).

Looking for current fluctuations just requires sufficient computing
power and appropriate sensors ; as you say, a typical starship should
have enough of both of these things.
(If it can be done *now*, with contemporary tech level gear and
ignorance about oceanography, it should be a snap at average Imperial
tech levels. 
	Recall that the U.S. government was trying to limit Chinese access to
key concepts and hardware that would enable them to build such a
surveillance network at about the same time as the security leak at LLNL
became public, earlier this year).

I think you can do it "backwards". You need to put a 3.5" drive on the
*Apple*. But I think you also have to be running ProDOS.

Failing that, you can try to locate a PC user who owns a CopyIIPC

3.5" Apple & Mac disks on our PCs.

As I recall...

GPE = 0.5 * M * (Ve(orbit) - Ve(surface))^2

Where Ve is escape velocity. Unless that\'s one *high* orbit, "surface
orbital velocity" is going to be much higher than that "difference of
escape velocities" used to figure GPE.

And "surface orbital velocity" is a good "first approximation" at
impact velocity for something launched at a ground target from orbit. 

More likely the object will impacy\\t at the velocity of the orbit it
started from *plus* the difference in escape velocity between that
altitude and the surface. 

Objects launched from something orbiting the *star* rather than the
planet will impact at (at least) the difference in orbital velocities
around the star plus the difference in *system* escape velocity for the
two orbits. If one object was orbiting in the opposite direction, then
you *add* the orbital velocities.

By current Aussie laws, it\'s the buyer that has to do the homework.  If the
dealer was caught with the stolen car, he would lose.  If it wasn\'t
discovered until Walt bought it, he has no recourse at all.  The Auto Clubs
around Australia have been "trying" to get this law changed for the last 10+
years, but apparently aren\'t trying whole heartedly.  My sister fell foul of
this law in the early/mid 80\'s... and currently, a police officer friend
(copper mate), a detective, nearly got caught, but he discovered the car was
stolen before he purchased it.

ObTrav: Here in Oz, there is a car buyer\'s ownership registry that is free
to dial into by prospective buyers to ensure the car they are buying is
freehold and not reported stolen, but people being what they are (often
lazy... errrr, I mean "to busy" to take the time), it isn\'t always used!
The registry has been in operation for about 10 years now, though I am not
sure if it is in all states, but it took years to implement at a local,
Continental-Island level... how difficult it would be to implement it across
sectors!!!

But a direct answer to your question of "Can Walt recover his money from the
dealer who didn\'t do his homework?" would be, "No."

It _wasn\'t_ handwavium [oh, the horror]!  It was Monohydrozine!

My experience is that "powergamers" work *within* the rules. Munchikins
work *in spite of* the rules. 

My knack for being able to remember even trivial rules well enough to
find them in a minute or less in rulebooks I\'m familiar with meant that
munchkins tended to not get started in my games. Or even games I was a
player in. Y\'see I had this bad habit of listening to a would-be
munchkin trying to tell the ref how XX says he can do this, and digging
out the appropriate rulebook/supplement and handing it to the GM while
pointing at the paragraph that says XX doesn\'t let the munichkin
do it that way. 

"Yes, I see that the rule *does* say XX. But I also see that it says
only left handed elves get that bonus. Since you are neither left
handed, nor an elf...."

The best solution to folks who get carried away with "powergaming"
(assuming they\'ve become a problem) is generally to expose them to some
players who *really* role play their characters. That usually gets to
them because it\'s obviously more fun and looks easier.

Given the way the one piece of his "fiction" I\'ve read ("Now Hear

Well, WWII drove home the lesson that you *have* to assume that the
*only* thing about your ciphers that the enemy *doesn\'t* know is the
current key. So nobody will be going after *equipment*, just the
storage media containing the code keys. 

These will be set up for easy self-destruct (try reading a CD that\'s
had a thermite charge set off on top of it :-). But it\'s still
*possible* to capture them as you want to wait until it\'s pretty
certain that you\'ll be taken before you destroy them. 

The size of the Imperium makes distributing code keys a real problem.
On the other hand, ship-to ship comm may be mostly by what Weber refers
to as "laser whiskers". This nor only means that you can get away with
fairly simple codes, but also that it\'s harder to spot you from comm
traffic. 

And then, of course, there\'s the question of whether or not public key
ciphers will endure the test of time. If they do, the situation changes
*greatly*. There\'s little *need* to change keys. All that capturing a
ship will give you is the ship\'s "private key" and those of the
officers and crew. Which means you can decode messages *to* them, and
fake messages *from* them. Which isn\'t really all that useful.

Not really. They assumed a "superfuel that couldn\'t possibly exist,

Of course, none of *those* gave them the chance of the ship going

I recall seeing a cartoon *somewhere* that had an officer "plastered"
to a jeep, with the remains of a basketball-sized paintball on his
chest. There was a tank on the opposite side of the panel. I think the
caption was "after testing, it was decided that paintball rounds for

No, we *figured out* how to do that before WWI.

We didn\'t actually do the *engineering* until the 60s. But we *could*
have had a man on the moon as early as the 30s if anyone had been
willing to pay for the testing and construction of the rockets.

This was one of the fields of my copper mate.  If the dealer purchased the
vehicle in good faith and the police cannot prove otherwise, he\'s just as
innocent as the next fella.  So he keeps the money.  However, if it\'s a case
of, "This is the 12th time one of Honest Harry\'s Used Cars has turned up
hot..." then I suspect the law may get suspicious.  Remember, I\'m not a
copper, a car dealer, or a lawyer.  I am just mentioning what I know
happened to my sister, nearly happened to a friend, and what has appeared on
various current affair shows (you know how they wheel the same stuff with a
different presenter out yearly?) and some newspapers.

You and I have different experiences with the same technology. The
most fundamental difference between you and me are our respective
nationalities. Same tech, different actions. So I don\'t think one can
blame the tech.

And she was a very fanatical member thereof -- not surprising, given that
she was one of the Canadian high-ups. Possibly even *the* key person in
Canada. I couldn\'t take an RPG advocacy group seriously because I don\'t
see the need for it -- society generally doesn\'t take the anti-gamer group
seriously...

Same here.  I\'m in several and GM a couple of PBEM\'s myself.  

It\'s quite possible the majority aren\'t playing right now, but they
could be if they really wanted to, by email if nothing else.

GURPS Greece.  And you all want to go out and buy a copy, if you don\'t
have one already.  It\'s useful for those, um, Hellenophile cultural 
revivialists
who colonized several worlds in, uh, Magyar sector.  Back during the
Rule of Man.  That\'s right. . .

Sorry Bruce, it was Andy, and the oh-so-dangerous fuel was
mono-hydrazine.  I thought the pilot movie was a hoot...if *only*
getting into orbit was something that could be done with a junk-yard
ship built from a cement mixer, a gas truck\'s tank and old tires.

The series was a disappointment.  I wanted a base on the moon, trips

I don\'t keep all old posts, just the ones I envision using sometime again
in the future.  I emailed the munchkin post to a bunch of friends, hoping
that one in particular would clue in and realize that there is more to role

Wasn\'t it a flatbed railroad car carrying a prototype car? Either way, the

The Differential Theory of US Armed Forces (Snake Model) upon
encountering a snake in the Area of Operations (AO) 

   1. Infantry: Snake smells them, leaves area. 

   2. Airborne: Lands on and kills the snake. 

   3. Armor: Runs over snake, laughs, and looks for more snakes. 

   4. Aviation: Has Global Positioning Satellite coordinates to snake.
      Can\'t find snake. Returns to base for refuel, crew rest and manicure. 

   5. Ranger: Plays with snake, then eats it. 

   6. Field Artillery: Kills snake with massive Time On Target barrage
      with three Forward Artillery Brigades in support. Kills several hundred
      civilians as unavoidable collateral damage. Mission is considered a
      success and all participants (i.e., cooks, mechanics and clerks) are
      awarded Silver Stars. 

   7. Special Forces: Makes contact with snake, ignores all State
      Department directives and Theater Commander Rules of
      Engagement by building rapport with snake and winning its heart and
      mind. Trains it to kill other snakes. Files enormous travel settlement
      upon return. 

   8. Combat Engineer: Studies snake. Prepares in-depth doctrinal
      thesis in obscure 5 series Field Manual about how to defeat snake
      using counter mobility assets. Complains that maneuver forces don\'t
      understand how to properly conduct doctrinal counter-snake ops. 

   9. Navy SEAL: Expends all ammunition and calls for naval gunfire
      support in failed attempt to kill snake. Snake bites SEAL and retreats
      to safety. Hollywood makes fantasy film in which SEALS kill Muslim
      extremist snakes. 

  10. Navy: Fires off 50 cruise missiles from various types of ships, kills
      snake and makes presentation to Senate Appropriations Committee
      on how Naval forces are the most cost-effective means of anti-snake
      force projection. 

  11. Marine: Kills snake by accident while looking for souvenirs. Local
      civilians demand removal of all US forces from Area of Operations. 

  12. Marine Recon: Follows snake, gets lost. 

  13. Combat Controllers: Guides snake elsewhere. 

  14. Para-Rescue Jumper: Wounds snake in initial encounter, then
      works feverishly to save snake\'s life. 

  15. Supply: (NOTICE: Your anti-snake equipment is on backorder.) 

  16. Transport pilot: Receives call for anti-snake equipment, delivers
      two weeks after due date. 

  17. F-15 pilot: Mis-identifies snake as enemy Mil-24 Hind helicopter
      and engages with missiles. Crew chief paints snake kill on aircraft. 

  18. F-16 pilot: Finds snake, drops two CBU-87 cluster bombs, and
      misses snake target, but get direct hit on Embassy 100 KM East of
      snake due to weather (Too Hot also Too Cold, Was Clear but too
      overcast, Too dry with Rain, Unlimited ceiling with low cloud cover
      etc.) Claims that purchasing multi-million dollar, high-tech
      snake-killing device will enable it in the future to kill all snakes and
      achieve a revolution in military affairs. 

   19. AH-64 Apache pilot: Unable to locate snake, snakes don\'t show
       well on infra-red. Infrared only operable in desert AO\'s without power
       lines or SAM\'s. 

   20. UH-60 Blackhawk pilot: Finds snake on fourth pass after snake
       builds bonfire, pops smoke, lays out VS 17 to mark Landing Zone.
       Rotor wash blows snake into fire. 

   21. B-52 pilot: Pulls ARCLIGHT mission on snake, kills snake and
       every other living thing within two miles of target. 

   22. Missile crew: Lays in target coordinates to snake in 20 seconds,
       but can\'t receive authorization from National Command Authority to
       use nuclear weapons. 

   23. Intelligence officer: Snake? What snake? Only four of 35
       indicators of snake activity are currently active. We assess the
       potential for snake activity as LOW. 

   24. Judge Advocate General (JAG): Snake declines to bite, citing
       grounds of professional courtesy.

Question: Why don\'t rules lawyers ever remember *those* particular rules? 
Selective memory, I would think. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I think it\'s appropriate for a player to take the rules as written,
until the GM tells her otherwise. Yes, the "GM has final say" rule
trumps any other text in the book, but a player can\'t make *any*
character or piece of equipment without being able to trust the 
applicable rules. Now, if the GM hasn\'t been clear about which
particular rules are applicable...

Writing that, I\'ve seen GM\'s who never even let a player *see* the
rulebook, much less allowed them to make something rule-tweaky with
it. "How can I get a faster starship?" <roll, roll, roll> - "You
ask Feldzarr the Engineer NPC, he says your ship is as fast as you
can get." "Why?" <roll, roll, roll> - "Your character blows his
Engineering roll, you don\'t know why."

It\'s a matter of expectations, of course. I recall seeing a Champions
(superhero RPG) campaign planning sheet, which gave new players a
combination of hard & fast character creation rules ("no one can
have defenses that make their hero perfectly immune to normal bullets")
and campaign expectations ("the heroes will be relatively unknown
vigilantes in a city where corruption and crime are rife, morality
of the stories will be in shades of grey..."). I really liked that
idea, and stole (er, "expanded") it for use with other kinds of
campaigns as well.

That assumes that stolen velssels have the information sent 
through the x-boat network and would be a good time frame 
in that light. However, while three months is enough to find out 
if it was stolen, it is not always enough time for the owners 
to get there to reclaim the property. That depends on how 
far away they are as well as how long ago the vessel was stolen 
and should be taken into account by the Admiralty in setting the 
probate time frame.

Also IMTU stolen propery is stolen property. If you find a 
ship in space with all hands dead and it turns out that the 
ship had been hijacked years ago then the ship is still stolen 
property and belongs to the original owners or their heirs, 
unless paid of by insurance. In that case, the insurance 
company owns it. The finders are still entitled to a prize 
fee of 10% of the vessels appraised value. If the old owners 
cannot pay, then the vessel must be sold and the prize paid. 
The remainder goes to the owners or their heirs. If the vessel 
had been stolen so long ago that no owner or heir can be found 
in a reasonable time, as determined by the Admiralty court, then 
it becomes the sole property of the finders.

In Eris\'s PbEM, the characters have inherited a ship that was 
seized years ago from a foreign government as a prize by a lawful 
privateer, if I remember correctly. That governemnt or the former 
tried to have the courts return it when we were claiming it. 
I bet the foreign government would see it as legal if the 
former owners "stole" it away from us later. 

So to sumarize, be careful where you travel in your new ship 
or you might have it taken away. <g>

Any guesses where we will *NOT* be going? <g>

Any guesses where the "big score" is going to be located?  No, I
wouldn\'t put it *inside* the territory of that foreign government
now would I?  <weg>

The McGuffin in my game for the first two years was "the ship."  Now
that they\'ve found it, there will have to be another McGuffin out
there to draw them on.  Frankly, I\'m not sure what that\'s going to
be, but there are plenty of "minor" plot threads that could develop
into something major. See, I\'m a big believer in setting up several
pushes and pulls, then letting the characters plot their own course,
and that includes NPC characters.  Let\'s see what have the
characters got to work with...

Why was Akus Moby murdered?  Did he have something, or know
something, that he couldn\'t be allowed to pass on, and if so where
is it now?  Does someone still want it...how much?

Why were the lawyers dragging their heels so much?  Were they in
league with the government, the Spacer\'s Guild, that loan shark
Pele \'Pickaxe\' Hiiki, someone else...or just incompetent?

What does the local intellegence agency want from them?  Is it in
their interest to play along, and could they *not* play along even
if they wanted not to?  How about these two new characters that have
joined them, are either of them agents? For whom?

Why was an unknown group trying to hijack the Mae Lee when they
arrived on the scene?  Why was a squadron of SDB\'s in just to right
spot to stop the hijacking?  Why did those hijackers *all* commit
suicide when the ship was boarded...or did they?

What happened to Colin David, the missing engineer?  His brother\'s
body was found, but not his.  And what\'s the deal with those
artifacts they found in David\'s duffle bag?  Do they have anything
to do with anything?

Wasn\'t it awfully unlucky that the ship\'s extremely hightech jump
sensor was reduced to a slagged wreak during the attack?  Is what
they found in forward engineering really the remains of that sensor
at all?  How will they know until they spend some time trying to
reconstruct it?

Do the PC\'s have the "Maltese Falcon" in their possession without
knowing it?  You know how many people want that black bird...

...and we haven\'t even scratched the surface of plots.  It\'ll be
interesting to see where the game goes from here.  <g>

Tank-scale (well, actually mecha-scale) paintball rounds appear in the
anime MACROSS PLUS.  It\'s an amusing bit, too:  two rival "test pilots" in
prototype giant robots/fighters are competing against each other in a
training exercise, set in a mockup of a city.  Their rifles carry paintball
loads.

At one point, an enemy mecha pops up with a friendly mecha held in front of
it, human-shield style.  The disciplined mecha-jock only hits the enemy\'s
head, while the "maverick" sprays paintballs over both enemy and hostage...
 Oops.

(To quote another movie that came out about the same time, on this side of
the Pacific:  "Take the hostage out of the equation.")

The guide at the THORP plant said that they couldn\'t build a small coal-

the sensors off.  The carbon itself shouldn\'t be radioactive (too many

I\'d have thought that \'Far Trader\' and possibly \'Star Mercs\' have 
similar chances of selling beyond the Traveller SF gaming segment? 
\'Far Trader\' is one of the best treatments of trade in SF that I\'ve 
seen beyond CJ Cherryh or Andre Norton\'s Solar Queen stuff.

Hmm. A CJ Cherryh Alliance/Union sourcebook for GURPS - now that I would buy!

That\'s rather different than current Admiralty law. If it\'s been "lost"
for long enough (say 100 years) then the rights of the original owners
have lapsed. And the wreck belongs to whoever finds it.

True. Though usually, it was someone trying to tell me (or the GM if I
was a player) that some rules clearly indicate as "optional" or
"unofficial" *had* to be used. 

Beyond that, *I* try to keep people aprised of "house rules". And I\'m
not too proud to start a game by telling the players "Ok, X is getting
to be a *real* problem. If it isn\'t toned down, it\'s going to really
screw up the campaign. So I\'ve altered the rules governing it a bit.
Here\'s the way it works now. Any questions?"

And that *usually* works. Sometimes folks will suggest handling the
problem a bit differently. Sometimes I\'ll agree. Sometimes I won\'t. But
once we are done discussing it *that\'s it*. We have a new rule. Only
somebody who wasn\'t at the session gets to argue about it. 

BTW, it\'s odd, but I can\'t *ever* recall the *players* telling a GM
that a rule  or power or gadget needed to be "toned down". Funny how
that works...:-)

I know a couple of people who can run a good *interesting* campaign
*without* a rulebook. Both are natural story tellers and really fair
about things. And they started doing this in the early 80s, long before
the "story teller" type games arrived on the scene.

Please define "pretty f*****g cold". I\'m going to be spending a week
in Vegas this coming March, and wouldn\'t mind knowing what kind of weather
to expect. :)

(My definition of "pretty f*****g cold": when it gets down to -40, as it

A couple of quick OT comments, before I get on to Traveller stuff:

Yuck.  I always liked playing bricks in Champions.  (Bricks are the tough,
strong guys, for those who don\'t know.)  I played other characters too,
but...  

I played other Hero games too, though, so I could cope with not being
bullet-proof, but still...

OK, with that out of my system:
Introducing new players to the OTU can be a bit of a worry.  There\'s a
whole lot of "stuff" out there, and it takes a long time to assimilate. 
Because I\'ve got my new game starting soon, I\'m trying to work out what is
necessary for people to know to make sensible decisions about character
generation, and so on.

How do people deal with that?  I don\'t really care what game you are
playing:  how do you go about introducing new people to a complex, and
unfamiliar setting?  I have to admit that I originally used to just wing
it, but the games I tended to run weren\'t particularly coherent, and this
time I\'m trying to focus on a small astrographical area and a very intense
power struggle.

(I should have been starting my game tomorrow, but the club (Brisbane
Independent Gamers - mostly a miniatures club) I\'m running it at has an
open day on, and I\'m going to be pushing panzers instead.)

Well, I was here and very active at the time--would that be the discussion over

or are you referring to the wider controversy over the desirability of the move

 Question: Why don\'t rules lawyers ever remember *those* particular rules?
 Selective memory, I would think.
 
 >>


Ummmmm.....guys?
May I point out that you are quoting a rule to justify your failure to follow 
the regular rules?
Finding and using loopholes, who is the better rules lawyer?

And what\'s wrong with lawyering? I had a character once who was a lawyer in 
D&D, there were no courts in the wildreness area we were in, so when ever we 
were attacked and captured one or more of them I would call for a court, we 
would select a party member as a judge, and I would present my case for 
killing or enslaving the attacker for his crime. In or near a village we 
would bring them for law. It was okay, but some of the group got tired of the 
procedure, so strangely the jurisdiction of the local towns grew out quite a 
bit.

He\'s got a point. I can generally tell which of my kids watched a lot of TV
when they were younger: they\'re the ones with shorter attention spans.
Sesame Street does tend to encourage snipping learning into small chunks.
It certainly hasn\'t lived up to the early promises made for educational TV.
(Which were made for movies, and which are being made now for computers and
the internet. Le plus ca change...)

Well, so far the majority of voters don\'t seem to care. The local Reform

You\'re in Edmonton, right?

Here in Toronto, we have a "no cell phones and pagers" regulation. The
school administration won\'t enforce it, because many of those phones are
encouraged by parents.

(The cell/page companies are pushing this as a way of talking to your kids.
Now you don\'t have to feel guilty about getting home late, because you sent
the kids a page telling them to order a pizza for supper.)

Here in wonderful Texas where I teach, we also have a NO cell phone or pager
policy.
It is very strictly enforced. Possession causes confiscation and the device
will only be returned to the parent  after a fee is paid to the campus
police. Of course for my particular part of the school district its not rich
parents trying to get in touch with kids, its fellow gang members paging
their buddies, which led to this policy

Sure, but coal has a *lot* of impurities (just ask anybody that\'s ever
used it for heat about all the slag you have to shovel out). And many
of those impurities contain harmless amounts of radioactive materials. 

But the emmision limits for nuclear plants are *so* strict that the
*natural* levels of radioactivity of things like coal (and especialy
the slag and "fly ash" produced by *burning* coal) is enough to set off
the alarms. 

We really are overly catious about some aspects of nuclear energy.

One thing that works is to use some "canned" scenarios from supplements
or magazines as a way to let people get familar with the system and
background. Sure, this means the first week or three will be devoted to
the scenario. But once they\'ve been through that, and you\'ve cleared up
any worries ("Yeah, I *know* the setup in the enemy HQ was *stupid*,
but that\'s the way the scenario was set up and I didn\'t want to waste
time rewriting everything. Don\'t worry, I\'ll be sneakier." :-) *then*
you can start them generating their characters.

Or let them borrow rule books between sessions of the "training
scenario" to let them try to design something and have you look it over
next session.

Actually, it\'s the source of a lot of arguments, because the rules
don\'t *say*, and Mark Miller gets a bit vague about details when we
ask. :-)

Personally, I say yes. You maintain your velocity as determined by
refernce to whatever object you used before the jump. Both magnitude
and direction.

Others say it keeps the vector *relative* to the local star. That is
you enter jump with a certain vector relative to the star you are
jumping from and leave jump with the same magnitude and direction
vector, but relative to the *destination* star. My question is, that\'s
fine for velocity towards or away from the star, but if you\'ve got any
"sideways" velocity, what determines what direction *it* is in? 

And then there are those who point out that the rules seem to suggest
that it\'s preferable to have a "low velocity" when entering jump, and
then say you enter jump at rest, and leave it at rest. And of course, I
come back with "at rest relative to *what*?"

Retaining your original vector does the least damage to physics, and
with a typical Traveller ship, it doesn\'t take all the long to kill
even 200 km/sec relative velocity carried over from the previous
system. 

It also gives a reason for ships to prefer certain "lanes" depending on
their planned destination. Make a run to jump such that it helps match
your velocity vector to that of your destination. That means that from
any given planet, and any given time, there\'s a "preferred" direction
to boost in on your way to the 100 diameter limit. Going in any other
direction means there will be a bigger mismatch in velocities when you
arrive and thus, higher fuel consumption.

It\'s not *critical*, but it makes a difference. Sort of like modern jet
airliners preferring altitudes where they\'ll have a tail wind over ones
where they\'ll have a headwind. It\'s not that they can\'t make the trip
even against a headwind. It\'s just that they\'ll save a *lot* of fuel if
they get the tailwind. :-)

In one of the Battletech equipment supplements they introduce the paint

bit that was interesting was that these types of people would settle their

    A few years ago I decided to go back to school and finish my formal

- -40 is just a bit chilly. When I was a lad in Saskatoon I just threw on
another lawyer of clothing and skied to school. No problem as long as you
dress and behave appropriately. Now -60 is cold.

Here in Hogtown people seem to feel that -10 is cold. Leaving aside the
whole question of Eastern decadence, a large part of the problem is that
people\'s clothing, buildings, and behaviour totally ignore the weather. No
heatlocks in the buildings, so there are lots of cold draughts. And no
perception on Bay Street that a dress suit and raincoat, or short skirt and
heels, aren\'t the most sensible clothing for subzero temperatures and icy
streets.

Which would be amusing if these weren\'t the same types who control our
economy. I feel so much better, knowing my future is partly in the hands of
someone without the sense to cover up when they get cold :-(

I\'m a huge fan of handouts. I like giving the players handouts, no matter
what game we\'re playing. To prepare them for a recent Traveller campaign, I
wrote up a movie review for an anti-Solomani action movie, and a piece on
the music scene (both are available at my site: http://www.pil.net/~semo ).
I also gave them other bits I had written, which are also on the site.

In my own experience, handouts work very well, especially handouts which
have little bearing on the rules, but which help to establish the
background. I\'m a handout nut though. In one traveller campaign five years
ago or so (geez, it\'s been that long?) I made a tape of a repeating distress
signal from an ancient alien ship, which worked extremely well at setting
the mood for the players during the session in which they encountered the
vessel.

Your own mileage may vary, of course.

That\'s a shame. I liked Elfquest back when it came out in the 80s.
It seems a pity to reject an author\'s works because you don\'t personally
like the author. I remember hearing that someone on the TML didn\'t read
Anne McCaffrey\'s works because they met her at a Con and were offended
by something she said. I prefer to separate the author (or actor\'s) 
personality from the quality of his/her works.  E.g., Alec Baldwin was
fun to watch as "The Shadow", but whenever he opens his mouth in public
about politics, he\'s an offensive idiot.

Wasn\'t that B-ko?  I thought C-Ko was the villainess who kept inventing
all these super-powered battlesuits to take on A-ko with.

Hmmm.

On a side note, I agree with Leonard. There does have to be some 
kind of time frame after which even stolen property becomes fair 
game. I believe he said 100 years. Sounds good to me.

We often did.  But she had to be the center of attention and sometimes we

roleplay 1:1 with her a lot to keep her satisfied.  It was hard to keep her

I have this problem... "I am willing to suspend my disbelief, but not to
hang it by the neck until dead."  (This is actually an ikaros quote, from my
second husband, the gay one who\'s now among my best friends...)

My novel is too long, complex, and twisted for all the loose ends to get
wrapped up completely, and I do like to write different stories about the
other characters after one story ends.  I also have justice, but not
complete justice... for instance, instead of having the rightful heir get
everything sie should have had to begin with from the usurper, sometimes
they go out and make a bigger haul on their very own.  She didn\'t always
like that.

It was Keven, and MZB.

Generally I agree with you, but EQ has a lot of other offensive associations
for me too... in terms of a club my first husband was part of, RP being such
an ass around women, etc.  It just links to a whole host of bad memories,
and then later I heard that they linked all their storylines to Barry Blair,
whose stuff I don\'t really care for, so there was no reason to go back.

No, THAT person (the villainess) was B-Ko.  We always wondered if she was
the daughter of Lex Luthor since the ending of the first A-ko show strongly
implied that A-ko was the daughter of Lois and Clark Kent.

I remember damn near *dieing* trying to hold in the laughter when I saw
those "family" scenes near the end. A-ko\'s mom ironing that costume,
and her dad sitting at the breakfast table in the blue suit with a red
tie. And wearing glasses.  Gee, I wonder when Clark got married and how
he wound up assigned to Japan. 

At least it "explained" A-ko\'s abilities. :-)

Hell, back when I was in Boy Scouts, we once got back from a winter
camping trip to find that it\'d hit -20 F while we were out camping.
It\'d been pretty calm so we\'d hardly even *noticed* that it was extra
cold!

I said PLAY, not PURCHASE. I know a lot of Champions 4th ed players (It\'s
easily more popular than GURPS locally, as far as numbers of players goes,
about 3:2 vs GURPS). What people PLAY is indicative of the market
correction. L5R, Deadlands, and others really are not THAT common to play...

One of the things that has been a problem with Hero\'s sales is that they
are aimed at GM\'s. In a typical Hero group, IME, one or two players have
the base book, and only the GM has anything more, for a group of 5-7
players.

GURPS, most of the players will have the base book (Same sized group,
abnout 3 copies plus the GM\'s copy), and many of the supplements have
materials very clearly presented to the players, but this is not so clearly
defined as in the Hero layouts.

AD&D2 (and soon D&D3) has a one-book for players, 3 for GM mentality; when
running events at boscos, I could count on every player having a PH. If I
was running Ravenloft, at least one would have the RL book. Similer for the
other settings.

Palladium sells. Mostly to munchkins. Many of whom really are under 16. For
many more, they are intellectually but not physically under 16. Most
Palladium groups I\'ve seen or heard of a re munchkins on parade, out on a
killing spree.

Hmmm. I\'ve been picking up gurps since MTM. I was an avid TFT player. GURPS
mechanics are firmly grounded in the early 80\'s. No real concessions to
standardized difficulties, a concept that began to flourish in the late
80\'s (CF StarWars, T2300/2300AD, T2K 1stEd, MT). Huge list of narrow
skills, vs the later approach of broader skills with specializations. 3d6
based mechanics, which finally started to cease being the industry standard
in the mid to late 80\'s, with the above system; almost every game from the
early 80\'s and late 70\'s uses the classic 3d6 or 3-18 attribute ranges;
Just to name a few that kept this standard: Mechwarrior (1e), Palladium,
The Arcanum, V&V, S&S, D&D, GURPS, Space Opera, Jorune, and even T2300, T2K
1e, Star Patrol, and almost anything by FGU...... Traveller was distinctive
by using 2d6 for attributes; later period games began getting away fromthe
3-18 model in the mid 80\'s: Talislanta (0-normed), Shadowrun (1-6 range for
humans), Ars Magica (0 normed), Mechwarrior 2e (1-6)[early 90\'s, IIRC],
Star Wars (ratings in Dice)[86-87], Torg (log based atts, 5-12, norm of 8).
The 90\'s have seen much more experimentation with attribute ranges and
basises, not to mention mechanics.

I\'m not saying the GURPS rules are unplayable, but I find them to show very
clearly their age of origin, plus they show their TFT roots. I also find
many of the bits in GURPS counter intuitive, but I find the same about
Mechwarrior 1st Ed, Palladium\'ss rifts-compatable series of games, Jorune,
and Space Opera. They are all games I found I needed to have the rules in
my lap to run the game (I don\'t play at tables, but in the living room).
Traveller, D&D, Star Wars, Ars Magica, and Storyteller, they are designed
so that the mechanics are easy to memorize, easy to run, and only 2-3 pages
of tables  MIGHT crop up in play.

Then again, I think the best effort I\'ve seen in the last 10 years on any
game was DragonLance Fifth Age. I love it as a GM. Slick, Well presented,
easy to teach and to run, and card based. Getting players to understand the
following has been the problem, though: "The cards are effectively like
having four dice, already rolled, sitting in frount of you, and getting to
choose which one you will use as it sits. Once used, you reroll it."

I\'ve shown him the door. The group he\'s in currently consists of a (Really
promising) 16 YO male, a nigh-40 gent who live with his mother (and is
behaviourally about 18-22), and the couple mentioned above. Occassionally,
someone else will join, and then leave in disgust. Anyone who knows the
couple knows better than to allow Ray into their group. I\'m about to try
and steal the other other two from Ray\'s group. (I\'d try to get his wife to

point....)

Really? Tell me more (either here or by e-mail if you don\'t think it would
interest others). What did you try? What went wrong? And why do you think it
isn\'t supportive of existing canon as a whole? I mean, I know it contradicts 
some canon, but that is because (IMO, of course) canon contradicts itself 
(Specifically, if you count Imperial nobles from the top down, you get 
10,000 or perhaps 100,000 peers, while if you count from the bottom up, you 
get tens or hundred of millions).

Take a look at the maritime salvage laws in the international treaties... A
ship is a ship, and, stolen or not, if taken while *abandoned* on the high
sees, may be claimed as salvage. It is advisable, however, not to reflag it
for the same country, so as to avoid THEIR salvage laws or property
reclamation laws.... IMTU, I assume that the interested parties in a
multi-million credit starship WILL spend the 1KCr for the message to
propagate to 16 months range. IMTU, the admiralty courts have a lot of
authority to re-posess ships. So you notify all the admiralty courts in
range within the time/distance range, and they will automatically assume
the claim as filed shoudl the ship turn up.

Since ship ownership is a matter very important for trade, so IMTU, the
laws regulating it are Reserved to the Imperium; local worlds may not
interfere (at least IMTU). Yes, a world need not allow you to register, but
once you find a world that will, and so do, it is in imperial matter. The
restriction on stolen ships recovery times is to force insurance companies
to either trace or pay off within 16 months. Admiralty courts which suspect
an individual is tryign to claim a ship he/she stole, well, they can refuse
the claim, and even return the ship elsewhere, or auction it off, and send
the proceeds to the last listed owner, etc.

According to TNE, yes. But I don\'t recall ever any of the rules mentioning
what that vector is in relation to. Several articles referenced this
tendancy also, without specifying frames of reference.

IMTU, that vector is rtained in relation to the two most gravitationally
significant bodies, in the manner of vector angle to ray S1->S2 at jump
out, and the vector at jump in will be the same in relation to ray
S1\'->S2\'. Note that S1 is the most significant gravity well, and S2 is the
second most significant. Generally, this will be the star and planet, or
planet and moon. IMTU, ships leaving Terra/Sol tend to choose where to jump
based upon lunal vs solar significance, and how it will affect their vector
at jump-in. Also, case in point problem If you jump from earth (S1= Earth,
S2=Luna) to mars orbit, S1 becomes mars, and S2 is Sol. However, if you
instead jump to mercury, S1 is sol, and S2 is Mercury. If however, you jump
from nearer Luna than earth,  you might get a reciprical course from what
you expect. also note that I use the orbital plane of the S1-S2 pair to
determine 3d referents; if you appear to hold S1 still, and S2 moves
clockwise around it, you\'re looking "Down". (Even if S2 is the orbital
center, as in a two body calculation either one may be the "Stable point"
for viewing.)


Some persons have it retain relative to the galaxay, but then the vectors
can become days of decelleration. to match with local system speeds.

Other persons base it upon the ecliptic and the star, others base it in
other ways.

here in alaska, they can get the dealer on selling stolen merchandise, in
itself a crime. Many places in the rest of the US have statutes covering
reciveing stolen property and selling stolen property.  Locally, Vehicles
must have a valid title IN HAND at time of sale. The actual transfer is the
signing of the back of the title (in the right spots), but it is not legal
until either the sold again (only room for 2 sales on an alaskan issued
title), or taken to DMV and a replacement title is issued to the recipient
signature on the back.

A dealer is only likely to take 1st signature titles, and they are supposed
to check id\'s. The state, upon title issue, checks for theft claims,
bank/mechanic/storage liens, etc, and won\'t issue if there is a known lien.

IMTU, ships have a more complex problem. Selling a ship takes action by the
local admiralty, the admirality court of the registation site, and possibly
of the new registration site, if it differs. Until they all agree, the
title is in probate. And any of them can take actions upon finding out
about liens against the ship or it\'s Sellers. So, unless you\'re buying new,
expect at least a few months lag time for probat to clear on PURCHASING a
ship.

Well, in my case, that depends on what you call "Traveller".

I have rarely used Traveler rules for roleplaying , as I don\'t like using
rules for roleplaying even with goood rules, and in general Traveler rules
are not good for actual playing (though they\'re great as a basis for
character creation, ship design and wargaming )

But I\'ve used the Traveller universe conntinually, right now we\'re doing a
hybrid of Jovian Chronicles*  and T2300, as the Pluto research station
finally finish building the first stuterwarp craft, and take the untested
ship out into instellar space to avoid it being captured by an Earther
strike force...

While at any time I  may not have played in the Traveller universe for last
two or three months, expand that to six months and I almost certainly have
donme something, if only a single convention scenario someone has asked me
to run.

*something all Traveller players should read, if only for great looking
ships. Jesse, if you ever get the chance consider doing one of the Jovian
Chronicles ships, I suspect it would be damn dificult, they aren\'t
smooth-hulled like Traveller ships, more like Bab5 EarthForce ships.

Fencing is a great sport!  It\'s also good to know that you only need remove
the
rubber ball from the end of the sword to use it as a real one if the need
ever
manifested itself (at least for the Epee).  It\'s also interesting to note
that most
cities, at least in the USA don\'t have ordinances against openly carrying
swords (course here in Florida, you can wear a revolver openly on your hip
and not be arrested as well.  Just don\'t pull the trigger.).

On a separate point, I understand that carrying an unconcealed weapon in
Florida is perfectly legal, but that if you \'brandish\' it you can be
charged.  This
isn\'t necessarily true, though.  We once had a very bad neighbor who openly
threatened their landlord with a pistol, which falls under the \'brandishing\'
law, and they weren\'t charged by the police.  The woman in question even
did this with the police there!  They said that they couldn\'t do anything
until she pulled the trigger.  After that incident I decided that if I heard
shooting
there again, I\'d simply start shooting back (there had been multiple
drive by shootings at that point).  It\'s also an interesting thing to point
out that in that town, at midnight of any holiday of note, say the 4th of
July or
New Years, that you would hear not just firecrackers but firearms as well.
One
night sticks in my mind in particular because of the distinctive sound of an
AK-47 going of in burst mode.  All I could think at the times this happened
was
f****** idiots!

So, yes Virginia there are reasons to keep your weapons oiled, and loaded
with
HydraShock rounds.

I\'ve used handouts as a prop in the past. Most recent example, the last
session of my Traveller campaign (now on hiatus until January), the plot
involved a missing woman who was being hunted by some Bad People. There
were posters with her picture and a reward, "Have you seen this woman?",
that sort of thing. So I made up a poster, complete with photo of the
woman (I used a pic of Angie Harmon from Law & Order), and handed it to
the players as an example of the posters they\'re seeing all over the
starport... It gave them something tangible for the plot hook.

Sounds like a Space Opera campaign I was in years and years and years ago
(circa 1982) -- one adventure, we the players found a derelict ship. When
we found the ship\'s log entries, the GM played a tape he and his roommate
(who was not in the game) had prepared, complete with appripriate background
sound effects (think of the background sounds on the bridge in the original
Star Trek series) -- and the sounds of explosions and people screaming and
whatnot when the ship was being attacked... It added something to the
ambience.

:-)  Well, if you\'ve been following DC Comics, Clark and Lois
finally did get married.  Since Clark is a senior reporter/editor
type person nowadays, maybe he gets a new job heading up the Japanese
bureau for one of the wire services.

Could happen.

Here in N\'Awlins, people start whining about the cold and wearing
coats when it gets below +50F. I grew up in Michigan, and spent
several years in Connecticut--to me, that\'s still T-shirt weather.

Ah! I see; to do romantic storylines, you have to have a fair amount
of cooperation between GM and player.  If the player won\'t cooperate,
bit of a problem.  A shame; romance is very hard to pull off in an RPG,
but to my mind, some of the most enjoyable and deepest roleplaying.

Hmm.. Personally, if the character goes out and makes good on his
own, and becomes a better person/grows/develops better than he would
have been if everything was handed to him on a silver platter, that
sounds like a better story to me.  Reminiscent of Louis L\'Amour stories..
(one of my favorite old-fashioned storytellers).

Just so you don\'t have a Michael Moorcock-style bloodbath at the
end of the story where you kill off everyone as a way of winding up
the series.  (Just re-read the Hawkmoon stories after about 15 years..
I was really pissed at him for killing d\'Averc at the end of "The
Runestaff"; it\'s a real downer.  MM wasn\'t quite as good a writer 
as I remembered him being when I read him as a teenager.  But then, 
I hadn\'t read Jack Vance\'s "Dying Earth" stories in those days, and 
didn\'t know what incredibly, superbly good was for that genre of fantasy.)

I guess I\'m failing aging rolls. I hadn\'t thought of that; it
would explain her skills at designing high-tech weapons and battlesuits,
and where she got the home super-weapon lab to work in. :-)

I\'d go further with newbies.  Give them pre-generated characters
with included background material, and run them through one, two or
more set piece scenarios.  Maybe after the first session have them
modify their character and after the second create one of their own
to try out.  The idea is to get them familar with the game setting,
mechanics and character creation before you lock them into a complex
and intense situation.

I teach adults.  I tell my students in their first class that if
they need to leave the room to take a call, go to the restroom, or
take care of other business then they should do so quietly not
disturbing the rest of the class and we\'ll discuss it after class or
during break.  So far I\'ve never had a real problem with cells or
pagers.  Most of the time the students are aplogetic, and somewhat
embarrassed, when they get a call, especially if it\'s not a silent
page/ring.

That\'s probably because (in the real world) your velocity is
*different* in different frames of reference. And it is conserved in
*all* of them. Really. 

Therefore if you use the *same* reference frame (ie the same *object*,
not "an object or objects of similar type" as you propose below), the
velocity vector will *automatically* be the same in all the *other*
reference frames.

Slight problem. There are *two* possible vectors that satisfy your
conditions in some cases. Consider two bodies of equal mass orbiting
about their common center of mass. And even in the cases where the
masses differ, something about your using the "orbital direction" to
define "up & down" bothers me.

Also, you need to define "gravitionally significant". Acceleration due
to gravity? Tidal force (the rate at which the accel *changes*)? Or
something else. 

In the first case S1 is Earth and S2 is the *Sun* (do the
calculations). In the second, S1 is Earth and S2 is the moon (most of
the time).

> Some persons have it retain relative to the galaxay, but then the vectors

Huh? That\'d be one *very* unusual star. *One* day of acceleration at 1
g is 864 km/sec. That\'s *way* outside the "normal" range for
relative velocities of stars. As I recall (Bruce, want to check this?)
"normal" values are 50 to 100 km/sec (with 100 km/sec) being *high*.

100 km/sec takes all of 2:46:40 (hh:mm:ss) to kill at 1 g. And consider
that the orbital velocity of Earth is around 30 km/sec.

To put this in perspective, here\'s a table of velocity versus time to
travel one parsec (ie how long before the star would be in a different
hex!) 

v (km/s)  years/parsec    (parsec=3.09e13 km, year=3.15e7 sec)
- ----  ----
100       9809
1000      981
10,000    98.1

So at 1000 km/sec (which only takes about a day to kill), a star will
have moved *several* hexes during the recorded history of the Traveller
universe!

At 100 km/sec, the motion is pretty trivial to kill (see above) and is
mostly significant in figuring jump coordinates, and (if you keep
*original* vectors) makes certain "run to jump" directions preferable
for certain destinations.

At 50 km/sec (a figure I seem to recall Bruce mentioning) it takes only
an hour or so at 1 g to kill the velocity difference. Assuming the
planet\'s motion in its orbit doesn\'t kill most of the difference during
part of the year)

"Single H" would be nice stuff. Bare hydrogen atoms (H+)

Mono-hydrazine would be *scary*. Hydrazine is (structurally): NH2NH2

             H    H

Basicly a pair of amine (NH2-) radicals linked together. 

So *mono*-hydrazine would be a bare amine group (NH2-), that\'d be
energetic all right. And even harder to keep stable than monatomic
hydrogen.

Yeah, but so are the Mri (Faded Sun trilogy), and a whole bunch of
other cultures/species all of which really need their *own* sourcebook.

Frankly, I\'m not sure I\'d classify the Union (they\'re the ones with
Azi, right?) as *human*. 

BTW, there\'s a filk song set in Cherryh\'s Union/Alliance universe that
as far as I know *isn\'t* based on a printed story. Alas, it\'s not
easily fitted to the Traveller universe. But I\'m going to have to try
anyway, if only as a song the players hear in a "spacer bar". 

It\'s a mother and her nearly grown child, alternating parts. They are
onboard a "small" ship. It was a sublight probe sent out to survey
systems for jump points. The crew had been in cold sleep, and the ship
was supposed to boost up to near c, then decelerate in the target area
and wake of the crew.

It woke them up all right. Only the computer had glitched and the ship
had never carried out the turnover manuever. Instead it\'d kept on
boosting. So the crew awoke to find a ship cruising along at a hair
under c, and no way to slow it down. 

They were able to survive for years (good recycling) and two of them
(the crew was two men and a woman) even had a kid. Over the years the
men died and the child has grown. Now it\'s just the mother and her son.
And the ship\'s systems are starting to fail and the mother is old and
tired. 

So the song is the mother going back over this (as a sort of lullaby no
less!), and the kid not really understanding all the references to
worlds and stars (to him, stars are something you see on a screen, the
ship is the world).

And in the last verse you find out that she\'s fed herself and her son a
painless poison...

This description really doesn\'t do it justice. It\'s a peaceful melody,
and that just makes the tragedy/horror sneak up on you better. 

Anybody that doesn\'t get choked up hearing this needs to be taken out
and buried. They\'re dead already. 

But it\'s a great example of "filk songs" as "legends that haven\'t
happened yet". 

Besides being a nice bit of background music (the whole tape it\'s on is
pretty good for Traveller, but I think it\'s out of print), it\'s
something that you could ask the players to listen to while you deal
with the latest unexpected curve they thru you (like jumping to the one
system you *hadn\'t* detailed :-)

For extra credit, after they\'ve heard it is a *great* time to misjump
them into an empty hex. Of course they\'ll *kill* you, but it\'ll be
worth it. :-)

Or you can file off the serial numbers and have it be speculation based
on the loss of an early pre-jump ship. Note that even if it\'s "about" a
"real" ship, there\'s no way to rescue them with anything short of
Grandfather\'s tech. And besides, as noted in the song, while that kid
was growing up at near c, folks at "normal" speeds have had enough time
for the human race to go extinct and new races to develop. 

AHA! (Inspiration strikes!)

*This* is how to have some of Grandfather\'s kids survive. He wote them
off after he saw that the ship didn\'t make turnover. 200,000 years for
the rest of the universe has been a decade or so for them... 

Only problem is that they\'ll be about 200,000 light years (something
over 61,000 parsecs) away.

Keep in mind the fact that van Vogt was one of Hubbard\'s more devoted

he\'d been ripped off. Anyway, while I don\'t know about Nexialism, I
*do* know that the other two were hardly van Vogt\'s ideas! He just read

B-Ko was the villainess. My favorite character in the series! (Love her

In A-Ko the Versus, she actually gets to team up with A-Ko and they form a

Barry Blair... didn\'t like his stuff either. Seemed somewhat distasteful to
me, somehow.

ObTrav, I once added elves to Traveller, although they were Poul Anderson
elves, and a genetically altered species created by misplaced
clone-grandaughter of Grandfather, left in suspended animation, trained in
Droyne invisibility, whose first experience of Imperial culture was being
rescued by a Virushi trader carrying a copy of Lord of the Rings he\'d
picked up in the Solomani Rim, but whatever. (I felt better after GDW gave
the Darrians pointy ears...)

Or, as an alternative, you could use high power lasers to supply power to
your individually shielded modules as well.  This technology is now in it\'s
infancy now, and may never be very efficient, but it does allow you to
supply
power to a device without worrying about EMP emissions.   As a matter of
fact you could even use the same fiber to carry both power and data.

And are they addressing the "Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex" problems

If you use lasers that are powered by radioactive materials, you get a
self lasing laser.  This wouldn\'t require any external power to run the
laser
which would in turn allow you to save mass and volume by leaving out the
Faraday cage.  Sure, these types of laser aren\'t weapons grade, but they
don\'t have to be.  They only have to provide a continuously running laser
and not a very powerfull one at that.

I can understand how our maritime salvage laws are different. Unlike 
in our world where, I suppose, they were negotiated between the 
different naval power in the Imperium they would be set out by 
a single government that is very trade concious. So the laws 
that apply in the space between worlds being that of the Imperium, 
I cannot see that they would fail to return the property that 
has been reported stolen. YMMV.

I agree, at this point, that the times should be restricted. All I 
was saying is that If it is known that the ship was stolen, even if 
it more than 16 months away, then the law should allow for enough 
time for the owner to get there. I would think that the fact a ship 
had been stolen would not be something the owner would pay for. It 
would be disminiated by the Imperium to all starports along the jump 
routes and then as ships went elsewhere, they would take it to 
the ports off the routes. Again, YMMV.

My copy has all seven issues. They\'re on the first CD. In the browse menu,
click the first button, the one that says issues 1 to 80 I think, it\'ll be
on the sub-menu that appears as TSR 1-7, or something similar.

If you\'re using the included browser, email me, and I will send you the
Traveller Bookmark file I made. All of the Traveller articles are included.
I haven\'t had enough time to bookmark all of the reviews and industry news
sections yet.

In Middle Eastern and African countries with large numbers of AK-47s readily
available,  it is an unusual New Year\'s eve in which no-one is injured by
bullets falling to the ground after having been fired into the air in
celebration.
